the game has started

uh

theme is

working in the game

let's

bring everything on screen

I cannot

um

okay

now

let me drink something

so I can't charge I can no longer flame

this is how it should be finally now we

can do it around for real

so I guess we can hear the button

so I forgot the headphones so the there

is

a game audio from the computer

yeah I got a bit distracted for the

other king or King

so let's let's do this around now

yeah everything is working

oh

one question I have for you is that

I guess I'll rescue this dragon in the

meantime

do I have to go to the exit of a level

or am I allowed to use exit level from

the menu thank you for releasing me

Spyro you cannot skip this Dragon son

then find the balloonist he'll transport

you to the next world

at the base animations are a bit weird

and the voice is very weird

so

you can decide for that

if you want

so for all enemies I basically have to

judge them

except for menu is okay soon

uh

okay what do you what about I think

if you want if you have an opinion

I want everyone to get a chance to say

what they think

let me see was that all of them

being scattered up some gems here in the

nice

system

so it is going to be a bit harder

because I actually have to eat them

and then I skip dragons

so

did I get all the noise here

the kind of works

extra lives I might need some extra

lives because

this might go

horrible

horribly or horrible

it's like my English

it's coming as well

let's just clear up this area

it's my

for me to get a bit used to not have a

flame I mean the bunny cannot Flame

this is very weird for bunnies to Flame

anyway so

but this I don't know is it

depending on the one

this also means that I actually don't

have a back button as well because the

back button is the

clay button

since I'm using a Xbox controller

oh there's nothing there

so

and then there's a few gems at the

balloonist

and then I have to charge to open the

chests as well

but those gems I can I can start with

the Town Square I think it sounds great

is a good starting level

so that's

18 more that should be outside the box

level and people doing this

so this is going to be interesting

where's my I want to move the window a

little

so

yes

so well

I mean everyone's house I need to judge

him as well need to charge everything

it's going to be

oh yeah

they have made it so

because you cannot

destroy the balls

and using charge them on the land like

that but you still get the gym

so

this works yeah sorry that's your life

now at least you didn't die

and these are going to be annoying as

well because

I guess that's a good timing actually

making it easier

I'll take some extra light thank you

and look at the cake it will say

thank you

no thank you

that's enough kick

otherwise I want some cake

no I rescued you are you happy

you know he would have there's me

the cake is so cool

yeah

that's

you mean the uh add it to the cake I see

I mean the cake itself is kind of

cool as well I guess

so

yes

I mean that could be a yes yeah

um

it was

okay let's see if I can get this one

because I usually get this one with

flame

that's this one

oh oh

I tried I don't think I'll get him

he would keep that egg

it will be very hard for me to get that

without Flame

so I guess that's the first roadblock

here

I did ignore some gems here

and knock the wall okay

so

and when they are at the edge like that

that's scary

and also I tried to make the uh a large

command work

and commands are done by writing

exclamation points

followed by the word in this case alert

which is the only command I've set up at

the moment

but I have no idea if it's actually

working because I have trouble getting

that

the mod that but to work that was such a

skill point for turning all the balls

upside down

and I cannot

going to Illinois so that's it's only

the 10th I'm missing and I'll take the

The Vortex because I was standing next

to it

so anything else interesting going on

so I don't have to tuck it talk about

gameplay all the time I don't know I can

talk about

well I guess I could talk about that KQ

is that we're cool

I guess

oh yeah sometimes in there too but let's

go to Stone Hill

oh yes so before

Stone Hill had those enemies in the

original PlayStation game you could not

charge the

um the

what are they called in English

yeah uh Sky currents that's not actually

what they are wait what are they uh they

kind of remind me of that they're kind

of like armors or some

I have no idea I need to look at them

anyway let's let's okay

you write a comments I like bunnies that

that is nice now we have the bunny

lovers all over the channel

it is you can charge

see I think it was a good idea to make

allow you to charge those

enemies because that allows you to

charge all enemies

in these two levels

Belinda

and we got someone on the hill

on The Not So Stone Hill

like we pick up the treasure extra lives

it's always good to have

and in this case

in the key because

yeah I don't like how they are here all

of this I think that's a bad design

um I guess it makes sense but

I was a bit confused first time I played

the game even though I played it a lot

from PlayStation I mean these have ear

holes too but yeah

is that that's not small

because they are one wooden so it's

the Assumption you can flame them is

a great day

I don't know what I'm talking about

let's collect some more gems

and rescue some more dragons

so the goal is to defeat in Aston Arc

that way I won the game because I

obviously cannot collect 100 that's

that's impossible so that cannot be my

girl

but I can't play some extra levels I

don't have to

you know straight soon as the North

so I guess I don't need to

collect

every level

I don't know but there you are yeah what

are they called not scarecrow because

that's completely fancy a Shepherd

that's the term

no it came to me

okay

I'm sure sure about that

are you lost

oh hello hi yeah that that sure was

funny

very funny getting beaten by a stick

oh I had a group of sheep

let's take them off yes

why not

so

up in this Tower we have another dragon

and a gym

team does

and then some gems on this platform

this is an interesting place

kinda feels like you're escaping the

level

I mean aside from the force field here

allowing you to not escape the level

that

yeah let's remove the fortune okay

this one should be easier to get because

I do need eggs otherwise I cannot

proceed

as I I don't think I pointed this out I

wanted to point it out but I got very

distracted by the other game that's

working but as you can see yeah Quantum

cannot open our mouths

as I speak

it's a smarty thing

[ __ ]

got it collected

treat

and other words

it's cute that's that's great to hear

I did the mouse myself it's not perfect

so

I'm not

like a great artist

so but I did my best

so

what about you Sparks

I don't think but as I said I don't need

100 of the level so I think this is good

enough

it looks nice yeah look at him beaky

pinky mouse as you open the mouth or is

it my mouth

let's just go home

I'm still not used to talking this much

shelf my voice gets a bit tired but

uh

I'll get better at it every time

but I like extra lights and also the

spiral head is replaced with ponpon

so these levels contains the first

enemies I cannot kill or destroy yeah

we're not killing him we're only

destroying them we are deleting them

they pump pump power

does have some power

and

it's also going to be a bit tricky let's

see so because your request the Flaming

blaming him from behind

I should maybe be able to sneak up like

this yeah there you go

now the question is if I can do that and

back my back

come on yeah there we go

which of course means I don't get those

yeah

but yeah

hello

um

classic awesome OG

which what I referring to

I mean this

Mickey

so welcome Mage mister

yeah please turn around

that can sneak up I need to film this

song

except for the little boost

so

I missed one

and I need to go to this one first

and this one is

highlighted

and chance okay here we go

this one requires flaming I don't have

Flame

bunnies cannot breathe fire

did you know that

in case there are yeah I guess I have to

keep track of a new viewers so

now that I just have to

figure it out

okay

big one is defending this

uh

I didn't do it

too much about the spider

the game has started stuttering a bit

that's not

I don't like that

you know I it's not snow I thought my

bunny head flame power

yeah I I mean I've never seen a bunny

use flame but that doesn't mean they

can't do it it's been they

shop since not reveal their secret power

oh that wasn't nice

don't hit me

I said don't hit me

then don't hit me

okay

uh someone did actually fly over here

which I'm never dumbing

because I've never had a reason to do

that

wait

you

that was interesting I didn't know they

can make gems fly

yeah I don't think I can do better than

this so let me tell him

and we got four watches now

uh hello everyone

feel free to write and chat if you want

dollars you or stay quiet if you want

but it's perfectly fine I'm just I watch

a

I respect any way you want to watch this

stream

so

as it said on the name of the stream the

challenge is to not use plane

so I've disabled the flame button so I

cannot even use it

so there's a bus in here I can not

defeat the bus so

I guess I'll just play for as long as I

can and then just leave the level

oh wait there's dogs in this level as

well which I cannot attack

yeah maybe I shouldn't do this level

because it's going to be hard but yeah I

shouldn't forget about your comments

that you wrote so let's

let's read

I need to get with my bunny and see if

it has flame power

uh well maybe your bunny doesn't want to

reveal such power

or yeah you need to be really good

friends with her with bunnies before

they reveal their Firepower

okay so far so good but these stops are

a bit scary

oh

ashamed I didn't defeat themselves

and stuff some enemies can

attack other enemies

no no no I got squished

and there's no father on this level

so I just have to survive for as long as

I can

I mean

it is the first spot so

it's not determined difficult it will so

yeah so here the level ends because yeah

culturally

charge the bus so yeah

not quick exit 11.

so that was four of the levels now

something I've looked forward to

the flight level

because the flight level

and this first level specifically has

three things after four you have the

flame

but you you don't have the flame it you

could charge it but charging makes you

stop Flying

so I'm really curious if I can get

everything

and I should probably yeah the airplanes

will probably be the hardest

the trains should be the Arches are of

course the easiest because I don't have

to do anything

but the trains should probably easier

okay let's see if I can take out

okay there we go

yeah this is working

oh can I just charge the front of the

screen

this is going well

no flame flight level

of course some things I can't do like uh

flaming lighthouses

because you have to blame those you're

gonna charge them

but

okay you cannot charge planes

so

I cannot complete this level 100

okay and let's restart and then I'll do

although I don't no I I want I want to

get three one at least

hmm

so

[Music]

um

let me try that again give me one a try

I I'll do it I'll do it

I'll share that thing

but uh the [ __ ] has sunk yeah

oh

the lurk is working

finally

I have I have succeeded in something

and yes thank you very much

and

hi Titi

Alice nice to see you around

see

that wasn't exit that was a one okay now

it's going terrible yeah I got all the

chests without Flame

I'm the great bunny

and that's a second and then I need to

gonna get the arches and the trains at

the same time

something like this

and then the second train is here

and then I finish up with the Arches and

that's a three in one

and I'm pretty happy with this

and three in one without playing

two more arches

and

I'll do some celebration loops around

this Arch here

okay that wasn't a celebration love that

was a crash last night yeah that's the

best I can do

a three in one with a fail celebration

Loop

okay again don't die now

thank you

I don't have the best hardware

it came around the game pretty well

it's it's a bit harder streaming at the

same time

passing because

100

I'm happy to get 100 some level

and let's move on to the peacekeepers

world in this world there will be even

more enemies that cannot be charged

the whole world should

know how much you have every enemy

chargeable so that's good

but that exit will not be fun

because I

always use flame to take it out quickly

now I actually have to do it properly

I mean I I assume you're supposed to

change it downward chart and he did

but I usually use flame too

which makes it easier to catch them

okay now let's

do this

right

I cannot use the Cannons because I don't

have Flame

I have said

dry Canyon let's go

so uh

Dino Flame

but when she continues and there was one

more detail I forgot to mention

I do have to Flame as an Orc both times

otherwise I cannot speak again so that

would be the exception

yeah

otherwise the game is impossible to

defeat

complete

and that's the only exception I'm going

to apply

to add three games

so I will use flame against bosses which

I have to defeat to progress the game

but boss is that it does not require

flame to be defeated I cannot use flame

which

I don't think there's any bus that

that you can hurt with charge

that wait wait there is one

this air actually I will get there when

we get there

yeah I almost want to take some of these

they sure are laughing

even before I shoot

I Stood Still and you miss me

yeah it should be able to charge Birds

this will be an interesting Discovery in

which anyways can't charge can't I

charge

okay

then hit

that all right I I didn't mean to search

it obviously I cannot charge it

I wanted to chat around you

okay let's take out this bird because

it's a bit annoying

and

let's just get this one

and look away now otherwise you'll see a

secret

because I'm

so

and now you can look again because I'm

not done

so here's the key

and then the key

goes

I slipped

oh yeah I also need to defeat that enemy

so

put it up

so

in the wide open area

on uh

the hot pot is trying to figure out what

the context for the comments are

because I guess I could apply it to many

situations yes this area oh yeah this is

a nice area

and you can

so

and walking into the wand

oh oh surprise attack

but he missed me it was pretty bad

surprise attack

did not help me there

and I died

add one to the death counter

I don't have a discounting

that's the closest I can do

okay game

why is it so laggy

I don't

I streamed this game before

okay I don't know what's happening

why is it so laggy

the computer giving up for himself

is is my anime

no no I don't want to be taking up that

much resources

but I cannot have not from Monday

yeah I I did again

my response I guess the animated font

one is

um picking up too much resources

it wasn't the reason for the original

game I was going to play

that was lagging with or without it okay

I can't get this I just started

um have fun it's only two so

please don't fall down

that's oh these are dangerously close

oh because I died I lost the key nice

I don't need that chest anyway

it's a stupid chest

but now I I'll add back one pon

at the next loading screen

surprise attack again

and I died

why can't I just stop

highlighting the

I guess that should be this

hey let's get out of here

I'm just dying on this level

oh that was close

so

I'm here bird

it's not not a nice bird

and that's when I can't get and I guess

that's all wait I do have to wait I have

the key what's going on

hi what's going on I have the key now

I am so confused

because I have the key because the game

was so nice to keep me back the key

excuse me I'll actually take my time to

unlock that chest

what did I get the key from

I had no idea what's going on

the game had a pump on it yeah it was my

pumpkin power that

that I think this that gave me the key

back well I guess that's that's all of

the level

so

oh yeah I can't press the back button

compressively about them the flame

button doesn't mix it

so

I want to just quickly

I can't control the game because I'm

just wants to add

let me back oh hello the very big one

with a very small Pom-Pom

she's not animating this time but she's

this with with us

um

thank you beautiful fun pump

I'm glad you like

I think she's beautiful okay I need to

get this before they get into the temps

because I cannot I cannot

yeah I had to I had to confirm I cannot

destroy the tents with charge

and these will run into the tents now

stop I got one

when I guess when I come back to this

level I can get the other two

or one more I guess let's go to Clifton

back to the an animating yeah

she's

happy to be here I wish I had a pumpkin

plushie I I wish I had a Pom-Pom plushie

that's not weird that's what you're

saying

that's the exact same

I don't know if am I supposed to read

comments in exactly it's written or

should I switch first and second person

Keith and freak for life which they had

a pumpkin blush

no that's what sounds weird

so

the big one of card Flame

no I cannot do anything about that

but let's collect some Treasures

now are they lying around Sonic around

and do the cleanup here

such a mess and then there is a thief

here it's already annoying to trying to

catch this sieve

and with flame

so I don't think I will be able to catch

it without Flame

but because

yeah I am

her assistant is that the term

uh I'll give it a shot I mean I'm

getting closer

I am getting closer

and I got many kids

goodbye dragon

let's continue

ah Dutch and and then I missed so

that wasn't right

I wanted to miss

and one of them drowned I mean they were

dead before they drowned

they sure laugh at that

they are up to no good

with that kind of laughter

so oh

this is going to be interesting

they're going to knock me off

though I guess yeah like that I had to

run on this side

please don't hit me I have a nice bunny

thank you for not hitting me that trips

that are my nice bunny

taste your love Heating

I want her to you so please don't hurt

me

did you try to eat me

I heard the sound

oh yeah I was supposed to

I assume you're supposed to land on that

thing

or something like that but oh yeah I

tried pressing the flame button I just

realized

yeah I ignored it because I can't flame

it

so now I had to get past these

oops again

thanks for the slap

yeah

I was I was acting a bit stupid so

obviously I cannot flame my rocket if I

don't have flame I'm just a bunny

right here can I even get past this

please don't hit me

I what did I say

just the bunny yeah

there is nothing strange with this bunny

it's just a normal perfect bunny

dressed up in a huge bow and a skirt

if it does not possess any

abilities that's a normal bunny

does not have

I think I said that correctly

this bunny has normal bunny abilities

all right see now there's one

yeah attack me

you failed

now and I do need rescue this

dragon

which will team a bit more and wins

just a normal bunny named fan phone and

looks really cute

I

that's correct

it's

it's a perfect normal bunny

and one

a bunny with oh yeah she got pink eyes

as well

the Japanese with pink eyes right

NASA just using our heads to destroy

metal frame

or chests I don't know what you want to

call them that's also perfectly normal

bunny ability

you can trust me that I'm a bunny expert

so I know

and then let's connect the treasure

around again

or as much trash as I can collect

and that's about it

it's something like over 100 of this

yeah I kind of miss 105

I guess I kind of run

save the whole levels

yeah although there was quite a lot of

enemies I couldn't

destroy so I guess it makes sense

it's very normal vulnerability

yeah I don't want it wait are you

already hiding in your tents come on

guys come out of there that's a cheating

and that's rescue this dragon

ah

oh yeah these are also hide that hiding

but I have actually yeah I have a way of

dealing with this

yeah we're going to not look at that and

work

and now we can deal with them

and then I need to somehow

get it to fire over here come on

did you do it now we missed

come on

okay can you shoot this thing please

thank you

how far can you should cat I mean

no there's nothing more to shoot I think

oh yeah wait there's some one water

is that do you want to shoot me oh yeah

you want to shoot me please

thank you

I never thought of breaking the chest

like wait how did you break them

I thought what other ways that I mean

honestly meant to using the Canon

yourself but I cannot use the cannon

because I'm just the bunny bunnies

cannot use cannons

come on

yeah yeah I don't think I can play for

this flight level because I can't access

it uh yeah well

oh well

by being the Canon Master yeah that's

that's the real life thing

let's confront this bus

but I had to let someone else do the job

for me

that's the life of a bunny I I said

bunny a lot

someone has a clip

We Gather a video of me saying bunny

oh that was stupid of me

so because I can defeat this enemy so

I'm not sure

why are you stood there today

so let's see how much

I think most no

hey what are you doing

lucky one two

one two three

strong button

and then I'll take this way around

otherwise I will put up the noun

this should be no problem without fire I

don't need five things I almost missed

the platform anyway

maybe I do need five minutes

although I cannot use the key because I

cannot reach the chest uh

Randall

whatever one drinks

yeah because I cannot charge this

where's the try

and the chest is up there and I cannot

reach it without defeating

that's the end of this level

okay so one more level

and which is down here

wait

throw those guys out

yeah they are

I got one more

still that one left

yeah and there are no cannons nearby so

I cannot use them

not that but let's go to this

ice skating

now next level

let that bow really glows in the sky

so I can do this level backwards

or

run towards because that's what they

call it right

I did it

the normal way last time so let's do it

backwards this time

yes oh yeah I forgot to say this you

look away

I went backwards yeah let's do it

backwards

your vote came in a bit too late but it

counted

no one wants to do lemon front ones

I love

I guess that's the way to get around

this

I do have to use a lot of rolls

yeah

okay stand up below

that was a good level

and then we go here

here are metallic big enemies

hey that's not that loud I touched that

plus this level has bats as father

where did it go

oh no why did I did that

that's wait can I let's charge yeah you

can't charge them

right now

but I only got one butterfly

another one

it got was malfunctioning

um

there you go

it's not nice to serve snowballs

but remember that

not so snowballs that were people who

aren't in

um

in on the game

oh

I I wanted to I am very funny

I wanted to take that other one

like that yes

I guess it wasn't it's too hard to get

the bats it's already tricky enough with

flame

ah Miss

bye

spots pets I might

bye

let's count that

was hey we just started that was

cheating

and what are you laughing at

what's this cheating that's just spawned

no

bear game

not playing Fair

plus I got the checkpoint after I

defeated it you should stay defeated

isn't that how gamers

ah I touched him

so let's continue up the level

another dragon

is laughing at you

it is in the knees

it's not nice

it's almost like they are even or

something

wait do I say okay so I need to jump to

chart them

there we go

sofa

well I can't fly around him but

I I can't fly around

Sunday smart times

okay that's the normal continuation that

okay now let's do this

like this now I did it

I haven't dyed this much in this part in

before

in uh

in one of these paragraphs

so this is kind of funny actually this

is giving me a

no no it sounds like him

I'm bragging I've played Spider too much

let's let's say that

I didn't mean to say it

but I mean

I did uh no death run and hopefully we

first came without buying some

anyway

Let's ignore

anything that sounds like I'm trying to

brag because I'm I'm not trying to

so I got the key

and now

to unlock that chest I had to do some

loops around here you're so confusing

thank you

you're pretty cool too like I'm sticking

around for so long and

chatting

you have written the most messages

that's pretty cool

thanks yeah you're welcome

I should never

come and count or something okay let's

see

I know

I think I don't know it's laughing at me

again

well I don't need those three gems I

still want to see how much I actually

can do

and I'm also hoping for uh suggestions

and ideas for how to improve

stream

not getting America shoot today

so I can have the animated Pom-Pom

you miss me

now it's my turn to laugh at you

looks like I'm back at start

when that's that lemon

returning to peacekeepers with my 2014

chats

and I only need one thousand two

hundreds to proceed to the next world

I

I want to get the lesson

I said I was going to do that

ow

these were the wrong buttons oops

yeah because these were ordered hiding

or I didn't see them

and do you

fail at

only idea I have

wait I thought you did the wrong way

it's way too quickly

I

hey come on

come on

okay doesn't work

oh and

I guess I won't do the flight level

I can't believe how fast you found so

much stolen treasure I mean it sounds

like the treasure life just

lying around everywhere

I need something more to drink

look at that back let's put upon

I guess it said it a bit too late

it's snow

we got the Big Thief there

and yeah yeah I'm not gonna catch up

with him but there is one technique that

you can use to

technique

same he doesn't say

the dragons reclaim yeah it doesn't

really say pronounce it

the way the original set

I want you to release the dragons

reclaim our treasures and

rainbows

run around the whole area

okay

I mean

here we go

oh yeah I cannot break this with that

delusion I have

been just

let me just get this swap

if you easily motion sick

that was another spinning

let's get rid of that one

he started laughing and then we realized

his mistake

don't laugh at a bunny

so I guess

release this dragon

and then use this super jar fruit okay

that didn't work that's fine I missed it

but I can use this soup search to

yeah

makes it quite easy

I can also use the supercharge to

get that one and that one

so I don't need to Flame them

normally and not a requirements but

so

um

well I guess I'll move on to Alpine at

least

and then

this is going to be a trick level

because there are huge enemies blocking

like

narrow paths

but we'll see how it goes

worst thing I get a game over

I guess that could be a part

in the part of the challenge to not get

the game out

wow I did oh I didn't know you ran

that was

surprise yeah that I know they I know

they do that

but

I mean

I guess I defeat them too quickly

there are still things in the game I

don't know about and I played it so much

guess I had traded enough

so I cannot get

oh that was nice nice

so let's let's keep

this same dragon

so

when I can defeat those

green ones

don't mind me I'm on your side I'll take

this one out and then I just

no no don't that's it I never attacked

you

we are on the same side we're friends

stop trying to attack me

but I'm not on your side

you can see you mess with it and

environment and I don't like that

I don't like

see this one isn't chasing me

so

see why I got confused before

oh thank you for opening

what's up that's everything oh

I missed it

and the

these stuff oh hello are you coming

am I here interrupting anything

no I'm just here to take your treasure

don't attack me

I haven't done anything to you I haven't

I haven't touched a single one of your

kind

and then they

please please let me through thank you

why are you so too territorium or baby

determines yeah can you move away so I

can exit thank you well they're swiping

at me I thought you were supposed to

squish me

I thought can I take that one out oh

yeah I can't

so that means I miss one but

yeah I don't think I should go back to

pick it up

I cannot take those I'm pretty sure that

will knock me off the pillars

so

it should be a thief somewhere here

it should be I don't know where it is

oh there it is

I guess he ran the whole lap without me

it was a bit eager to run away come on

Thief

I'm just a bunny

and it's faster charge speed to

compensate for lack of flame

yeah yeah this isn't working

and I don't think nothing like that

works I did

I feel like I'm not catching up

scratch that

I might be able to get the first one but

I am not doing it because

so

I should have picked up that goat I

decided to

you know at my house because that seem

to be anything hacking

used to without

to say what's with concentrating

like no there's nothing yeah

that's exit level

foreign

as much as actually

second level high case

I'm waiting

fly high

they just land on the ground again

those are going to be interesting to

defeat because I can not use the flame

power up

because

nice

that means

not that one down

because

as I mentioned the attack button is

disabled

the flame button action is specifically

why did I jump up in that one

please ignore me I'm just a happy bunny

okay I'm I'm I'm really struggling at

the moment

no come on please stand still I just

want to marry you

is that really too much to ask for

let's do this

yeah networked

and the second one perfect

and in this area I cannot die

because I got the helping fairies

and this area got a supercharge which

according to this dragon

I like it's

that him speak

ing

but they have to sign the devil so you

don't need to do that

I didn't know if that was in touch some

of them

just uh

you know that

no need for the super charge

and then you can I don't remember if you

can do this in the original

maybe you can do it and really I did

but yeah but let's see if I can get the

exit

uh

how are you supposed to take this I'm

okay am I supposed to run on this circle

here

I guess I guess so

thank you fairies you are wonderful

so

and then

I guess I'll just have to take damage

I was

in my

in municipality state

we didn't take damage for that one

got another thief they are everywhere

turning

and quit there on this police

oh yeah

you were laughing a lot here

there we go

so

I need a guilt an extra knife nice thank

you

I kind of need it I'm already designed

five times

no

all right oh I got to make knife I don't

need butterfly no

I haven't done this since I was a

smile shine

I almost stitched a little girl

I missed that one

there we go oh yeah wait I can't take

that out

now it's drugging English as well and

the cape

I can't uh yeah that one is stuck in it

and I can take out that

blue one with the stupid sharp as well

let's see if I can do that and also

that middle one that I missed

hello and then I need to remember that

there is stem

no or either two of them

I forgot about that

I I want to give it one more try

I don't have to

take them out

but it would be so fun if I could

self-imposed challenges you start to

return it

and now

they have

I guess it's more like they

yes they haven't read me a single time

and they

go

I call that a zigzag

now I call it a success there you go

that's

that's what they call it

no

let's just let's see it's free the ferry

I the fair doesn't help me but

let's make pumpkin pinch

might be a very good

it's going to be extra pink now she's

will use a flame

but I cannot not really use the plane

that was all the flame I had

but I got a kiss from rescuing the fairy

but I guess that's that

let's see

let's fill up the bridge

so

and back to the key

there done those two levels

and let's continue

that one

and this one up here

because this is a light level

and I think this one has a light houses

which I cannot

I think it has planes too so I guess I

only have to do that too in all

wait two enough

all in the one

so

three months so two in one

and she when I struggle with that too

much

so much

now I complete the level with a

different one

I can take the Rings I can take the

Arches and I and these are pretty simple

I only have to fly through them

and then the chests

is going to be

the weakest challenge

it's a change

it's a shame

they don't allow you to

charge the plates

well oh

that was close

why do I have so little time

I would like

I did it

Victor loops

that's a three in one

I did it first try it as well I'm happy

with that

yeah

you did it

I did it

I'm actually surprised at how

how well it went

a purple spring chests

so there's a key in there

yeah let's let's take care of that first

let's take the key

and unlock the chest

on your back

I wanted to Flame

yeah that's

going to be a struggle

it rarely I actually have

accidentally tried the flame

which is why I have disabled the button

it's just to make sure I don't do it

and there we go one extra life

and now back to that level

and we start Peach

I think it was called

here we go

although I should have used this

supercharge I could run quickly

so

there is something here

and then

if I'm not mistaken

I can play around here I'm here and I

cannot do much about that one

but I can steal his situation

or

or treasure but always but I made an

attention

that's

such a

big and beautiful beard I think

and then these are

signed to be made

I don't

that was

the most perfect timing

with me

that was fruit

that was

I'm just I'm just trying to I I don't

even try to attack them they just squish

me

like like I'm the bad guy

plumper hasn't done anything wrong

yeah what's the point of this area we

shift this now

Gems or anything there

it's just me or

or Instagram they're pixelated

maybe it was just me

really capture

so where am I now I'm ready

maybe I should have

taking those two in the reverse order

oh come on

and then they're laughing at me as well

I'm yet oh super shot you know what that

means

it's just cute bunny and has done

nothing wrong

if I am not murdering these blue

projectile is shooting

scenes

and because I have a silver charge

I can open this

and that means I might be able to open

things like these no matter these things

wait how

they okay

I mean at least this time actually it

did remove those

it removed it removed them from the

playing field

and with the super charge

to play all the way over here

connect the treasure

find an active

yeah run

all right let's fall down

that works too wait I missed some gems

I haven't seen the afternoon

okay

and then let's explore that other area

I guess my orb wasn't

quick enough to pick those up

I do like this side for some reason

um

here

okay perfect

I can see what I'm doing

open this stop missing them

I'm not that bad at taming

I usually don't have to rely on charging

this much

so

should I

I just want to try

I want to take out one more of those

enemies

I'm probably not going to be able to

turn around and follow her around that

thing

I mean I can try it actually

I actually I might be able to

but no I'm going to give it one more try

but I don't think I can find the jump to

get up the stairs properly

yeah I'm not going to be able to time

that at least I got that one which was

my girl because I'm happy with that

please stop

you have you have my age

come on

must be a better way to do this

look behind you

ah no

someone fell down behind you

um okay

um

okay okay

if you're going to be wait I had a

chance that no he's he's messing with me

[ __ ] uh navigating

stop it

okay I'm dying at the moment

I need help

and then I'll go to the exit

oh

imagine if that works

okay for

missing me what's up that's what I like

to see

behind it

huh

oh yeah

can you pick that up please uh

I lost it

no you don't

rescue I think someone's trying to hate

me

rescuing at the uh wait rescuing a

dragon makes invincible

Invincible Not Invisible

so

what do we have here

and me

and we signed no through it

we sucked actually don't know what it's

about

all right

I didn't have any

Health left not reigniting

yeah we are saying that because it's

this world

it's the right way of saying

rabbit

so

let's enter that level

can the fronting blower yeah it's

another bus which I cannot charge pretty

sure I can try

okay that's it

miss me

oh no

okay so they cannot

tricky these

enough that I need to pick them up but

I want to I wanted gems

come on

okay I need to be careful

because okay

oh you can

no okay

that was a bit weird

I

I didn't know he could

wait what

what why I cannot

why can I not charge these

okay

that's doubly weird

I didn't think I could charge the bus

and I can apparently not shut these two

are these two it's different in some way

I haven't looked that much into it

okay so I'm not going to try to charge

these

I can try to charge this one I guess

I mean thank you look pretty similar

even though why I can't charge them

and it's and it would be weird

because obviously they would use the

exact same

let me type and then you set the anime

type to be chargeable it's weird that I

wouldn't be able to charge specific

details

okay

yeah

I could take it later but no let's let's

make this a challenge No Hands left

and there we go

I made it

I'm pretty happy with that

360 gems

which means that's those four cheating

Druids

if for some reason are Untouchable I

have a 10 each

I should have flamed them

the game is Just cheating

and by that I mean I should flame them

because

if the game can cheat I can cheat

there you go

wait are you a dragon

I'd like to go to the beastmakers they

make being stupider

so evil it's the most evil thing

now planning in these pages

oh hello

chicken

let's see this one chicken

is

but I'm probably not going to be able to

say it

I'm sitting uh

I tried

I faint

I guess they set up that timing

and it's a pretty nice uh

like

it's a tutorial

but it's more like a dynamic it's not a

dynamic but I see

and kind of tutorial when they where

they show that the floor will hurt you

by hurting the chicken

someone can probably come up with a good

name for that kind of tutorial unless

there are these a tutorial

and then if the toy

in that case I would like to know what

it is

because it's a nice way of doing a

tutorial without

putting text on screen

or stopping gameplay

or directly telling the player okay

obviously I can't charge this

there we go

doing some

dodging

this bunny is a hijab

oh no

I got some hiccups I guess this was kind

of

similar type of tutorial

and there's skydiving not normally I

won't

and yeah

and I had to say it now because they put

that cross over the L making it up

Danish air again

all right

demonstration I think it's what it's

called yeah

I guess that's a

good name for it

and they do have

several of those moments to stop

shooting the button

I mean I'm killing you but

I think I'm not too too sure

reading and playing at the same time is

it's a skill I've been about every time

I mean it's a good thing

but at the same time I guess it doesn't

exactly specifically I cannot activate

this

you can see

Fire Snakes

I guess

oh my invoice

I guess they are snaking through the air

so

you don't shoot me so as I was going to

say a live demonstration doesn't exist

to me it doesn't seem like it's specific

space explicitly stating that you can

still play the game at the same time

which is what's the type of tutorial I

was talking

I guess they have to

I mean it's up to him whenever you want

to pronounce it

my name is pom pom that's if you were to

ask me how to say I would say ponpon

but sure people with different accents

they pronounce it differently but that's

just minusing I don't see I don't think

you would like say Pom-Pom in

I mean how else would you say Pony poem

Maybe yeah that would be weird

huh you miss me oh no

bubble electrocution

bye no it's just that

miss me

I'm touching

English is not my first language it's

not my French language either

so I'm not too sure how to say many

words in English

yeah sometimes

I mess up too

and sometimes I just kiss

it's just I'm sure I'll probably close

enough I hope

and here we got another rocket and it's

another fire stick

so it stays the same for all of these

it would be fun if they actually had

different names that I would ask

that I would be asking too much

it's not like they can't even make sure

Audrey is a chargeable so

so I think that's that level

so

and here's the code our skill points are

quite or what

oh is it a Don't touch don't yet

stabbed by the floor or something

which I technically didn't do because it

was the enemy that Zapped me while the

floor was snapping or something

I'm good at Spanish yeah uh I assume

you're a native Spanish speaking and

what's this for some reason

and I'm good at Swedish

for similar reasons

so let's see if I can do this but I do

that and then that yeah there we go

can I charge this no I cannot and now I

trap

yeah step as a six steps

do I have to start everything from the

beginning what about my chick fight

I'm sorry I had to die

I took too much damage

but there is one way to

kill one of these hey I didn't need your

wait

is that another way to kill them just

have them in charge of the level

and

no don't don't answer me in them

the

one I don't want to be in there

it's swampy disgusting water

am I and I'm a nice beautiful white

rabbit

I don't belong in that kind of water

I do wonder if I do the flying lemon

wine to fly

did I get all the house back I don't

know

it could be somewhere at work in the

game

okay

um can I charge the boats

no I cannot I had to check

but even if I could shout your boats I

don't think I will be able to actually

not fall into the water if I do

and I cannot charge the planes

I mean maybe I can charge the planes on

this level because that's how consists

of spiders

yeah but uh yeah so arches and

this is a pretty easy whatever

the first one I can do at two in one

there's other two so I have three and

one and then there was the one ceremony

man because I cannot even enter it

oh wait what am I supposed to do this

yeah I have to read your comments I

think

did it tight

and there we go

I did a victory leads keep the pan pan

clean and away from this warm Waters I'm

trying

but sometimes she found in when someone

pushes her in

maybe I get full health back because I

fell into the water and had to restart

the time try and maybe it resets the

health

I don't know if that's what specifically

the reason why why it would reset the

health but it reset the health I'm at

Full House again

my assumption was true

let's enter Misty bug

and then when I exit Mr Bug

and Mr badge and the hog

outside you could die

and be pretty happy with what I managed

today

white levels anyway I I'm

I'm I'm surprised how well it has gone

at least no chest has been standing on

top of water itself it has always had a

platform

no one is looking for food yeah

eat me are you miss me

oh no not these

I almost fell off

okay did I do it

I did it

I picked up all the gems

oh no nothing attack frogs

okay that actually went pretty well

because they are

very quick with our tongues

click click that and take it off the

complex

um

no not more of these

all right they like only these two

places these are

no it is one a sad place I've seen the

airplane

they are quite

I don't know it ate me

please don't touch me

I'm coming tonight I cannot do anything

about hug I have to kill you

and leave the hard color

now this yeah please

please jump off

oh no don't

that

that threw me off

and because I didn't pick up the track

and I had to start over from the

beginning

night as long as I can so they don't

trigger

and then I have to

knit around here

I cannot sound like those friends

let us go

it's goodbye

50 dragons I can defeat nothing right

now wait

six

sixty thousand chance I probably need

some one

cute sound wait

no that wasn't a cute sound

I was

gonna clip the clip there me making

froggy noises

what

I don't know how well they if it picks

up

it's this room

what

who I

what are you saying I don't speak frog

stata

come on fight me

okay I'll try

oh no I took damage oh no I took damage

again

that wasn't too bad

I mean I took damage twice but

and then one more

I couldn't have done it a bit better I

guess I'm pretty happy with that

can I mean worse

a kid of died

and I need to concert that area again

I collided with something

but it's a death

I will count it

okay one more try without colliding

within in an invisible wall

and invincible and invisible wall

invisible and Invincible circles similar

I mean it's a coincidence but

you're doing great thank you

I mean I it was the eighth time I died

but thank you

in the cafe

quartz

quite the hair

and this will be the third area with

these

Bush things

that's

uh he's only holding the knife with one

finger and a thumb

you missed me that's that's not allowed

you're allowed to miss me but you're not

allowed to

give me damage

if you miss me

that's against the rules

please don't touch me are they run quite

far

no no

what can I yes

um

she's

sleeping with the fishes

I I need to count this

nine that's

I'm typing that manually I don't have a

discounting

I do have to add on this counter

stupid Hawks

that

the igniting

the igniting okay

please be my stuff now

I don't like you

please

please stop doing things that makes me

dislike you yeah

can you

please stop push me thank you no no go

away

I I'm I'm just trying to

do this

please let me be

yes jump down jump down no

come on

come on down oh found out

to fall down please

please

oh not I don't want to fall down

okay okay how many times have it here

[Music]

I wanted to see if I can pick up that

ring box but I don't think I can

okay let's see

I hear a lot of deaths going out around

there down there

yeah no

no this isn't

it

okay okay this can work wait I I I'll do

this

your way

all right let me calm down

and then I approach

same time

okay

okay but now the other one didn't react

okay yeah

please stop please stop that's not nice

[Music]

you're doing cute I'm not doing cute I

just died again

this isn't going well

and uh

okay

please don't do anything now

what I believe

okay

no wrong side I'm sorry yeah it's it's I

have the gem it is mine you're not going

to get it back

and

it wasn't this I hear someone coming

you didn't catch me

okay

now the horrors are over back to normal

gameplay again

so

okay I guess I guess you were right I

could do it

I'll give you that one

so anything else going on

right

and then I can't do anything about those

so

back down to the girl

this is quite

The View

favorite

you see what I see

more gems

oh there they are now we just

not showing up for some reason

I can I'll take the safe route

it jumped down

it committed suicide

it was probably pushed off by another

one

it had enough

it felt bad for me

and then I jumped

now I did I did that

now that one is back again and

run

the quickest you have ever around

that's

that that's the past tense of run around

you are a quick bunny you can run

quickly

see now it died

and you can do it I could do it

bite me okay I'm not going to be able to

check that

for me to water

but that's like three hugs that I mean

two Hawks that have fallen into water

and after that dies or exiting the lemon

I think

I mean the last one I know but

I think it was two Hawks falling into

water and now to the best level of the

mountain everyone loves this level

actually most people the worst levels

for people in general are the flight

levels

so Treetops is only the fifth worst

level because people are still committed

committed to doing these people often

skip the flight levels

unless they actually truly going for 100

I've been there watching people stream

the games it's fun seeing people

what things they can do

oh yeah

that was quick oh well not quick enough

okay I should take

these parts first

I just missed me

and

it looks green in here for some reason

and now it's blue again

yes

the wrong direction

okay these are annoying

normally

yeah I need some extra life so can I

lost

seven of them on that previous level

or something

I don't think I've died that much in a

leveling

in a long time

and I will try to not die a single time

in this level

just to show how easy it is

and okay let's go I'm dropping I left

go

oh why are you selling so many all right

here too that explains why you yeah

you are throwing so many

easy peasy treats yeah it's it's an easy

level

nothing hard with this level

I haven't died yet

that shows how easy it is

I mean these ones aren't making it

easier

oh

can you please let me plan first can it

okay okay okay

I think I just died

it wasn't due to any platforming I think

if I could flame that one and now I'm

making excuses but I think it's pretty

fair to make excuses for that

did I no I didn't

yeah there we go

I'm surprised that word

I

not so easy PC3 tops I mean it's I blame

that enemy

fly fly

okay

um

um obsessed

so about not dying yeah the I kind of

feel that that at the game just prove

the otherwise yeah I know

that

okay okay now

I actually failed at the platforming

it was kind of that kind of test I was

talking about previously read

yay the game is rigged he told me

okay

and let's do some

what do you wear about that one

it's probably

I'll give that uh

is out of ten

it was pretty well executed

but the final jump must a complete

failure

ruining the whole thing oh a second

purple spring box

I think I call them different things

each time

so

yeah so I got here

Let's ignore I have died four times on

this level now that's it that hasn't

happened

and I've said I was going to die several

times

not so good

yeah oh yeah NADA oh wait I can use that

wrap to

get rid of these

but now now I've done the first path

now I will go back to the beginning

and do the second pass

which I'd have to do twice actually

because I first need to break open

and then I need to go get past get past

these once again

what you die in the game and never see

that

no I mean

hey

what what

no

no

[Music]

I it's not like I've died 18 times now

until something

wait I don't want to be here

I want to be somewhere else

I want

it goes right here

but in that case I do

not wake them up they're sleeping

I'm so sorry

sorry for what

they are still sleeping you haven't like

in the mouth

I got that one

I think I'm doing pretty well

I mean for not having a flame attack

yeah I want to see how well you lived

here on this level

without a flame attack

your attack was over

the Mr

big big thing

please don't why are they sleeping

because they're supposed to be waking up

by the uh

German Thief we are passing by here but

yeah it's not

okay

and then I jumped that I would die a lot

yeah

yeah

you would

hmm

well

do you I risk going for that one

or should I

yeah I should as soon as I see a

challenge

I need to go for it

the problem is I just have to go past

these I mean if I die at least I respond

at that dragon

you're missing me you missing me

yeah oh wait now they are awake

I'll touch this bunny okay you guys

actually spawn me

and you're laughing at me

you see email that's the most evil thing

you can do

foreign

what's that supposed to mean I'm cute

that the game probably yeah I haven't

seen you play it so

I guess you have to stream it yourself

then I'll watch

and

I took it

I call that a success

this is the second one but that's kind

of behind the building I don't think I

get it

okay maybe I will yeah yeah

time and date let me know

and I'll be there

that was a complete picture

and that's a 19th

all right I had death

copied cell

I have a second idea for getting rid of

one more enemy but that idea might

actually not work

but yeah it did not work

can we go to 20. no I think I've died

enough now

I don't want to die more

can we can we make this breakable by

super charge

it's a wooden post

so close yes so far I don't know I mean

I can do this one fine you'll see

you'll see

we'll eat your words there you go I did

it I don't think you can do this great

on a level yeah yeah show me show me

share me what you got

that's my challenge to you

and I'm still not at 20.

I mean I'm not

I'm at 19.

the reason why this look like that was

because they have white fur on them

because originally they have purple

skates and if you didn't know

you can do this

are you also laughing at me I haven't

had enough of people laughing at me I

don't like it when people laugh at me

and then you can do this path backwards

which I didn't get hit

I

thought I was going to miss it

and there we go

so much easier at that point I accepted

your challenge

I might die in the first level but I

won't give up okay if you actually die

in the first level

by just not having Flame

the first level that is being Artisan's

Homeworld

where you can only die in two places

being the waterfall

and the balloonists

uh yeah if you if you die

better

I could understand if it's kind of hard

yeah I guess I guess we could kind of

challenges like that

well see how many times I die we can

also see my completion percentage

I guess

I guess that's the first uh person who

completes the most to win if you

complete the same amount

um

you then look at

two times at least I guess

but there's no depth champion in the

game which is a problem

okay bus level

bus

level

these smaller ones

are armored

which means I cannot flame them what a

shame

if only I could flame them

be good to seeing they have put on

protection so they don't get flamed

hello

banana sewing

thing

I mean I guess they are supposed to be

what they call them orangutan

at least this one

that kind of

half steps between

or

because they constructed arrows so they

have some

higher

intelligence

I mean they're trying to kick me and I'm

not trying to hurt them so their

intelligence level is pretty low

aside from that

oh these are very shiny oh I found a key

so back here in this tunnel

so moving over here

and that's

those things now to actually continue

the level

I could take that path again and just

fly over this but nah

that's let's just casually walk past and

wait

what

what happened

did I get that one

every single exploded

do that one

did I want to see if I got that gem that

thing I missed

but you miss me

[Music]

I'm still confused about that saying

that run away but run away

that sounds like a name

and then the family

you are guarding yourself just fine here

Nana let me go passing if I don't

I don't want to fight with you

and this is the first and only boss I

can actually defeat without Flame

so let's defeat this bus without

plane and let's see how quickly I can

defeat this bus

I'm

let's go let's go

and there we go it has face one done

and I will just

pick up some chains

a lot of blue and yellow gems it's a bit

Swedish Thing

okay

where should I

do okay let's do this

oh no wrong timing

there we go that's phase two

garlic even more that is a green one

during the whole scene what such a

beautiful blue and yellow theme

so let's not skip that Let's ignore that

camera so mean

very close on fun fun

and then the final gems are

blue and yellow are nice colors yeah the

Swedish flag if you didn't know

flag

with a yellow cross

it's uh it's the Christian cross

and

the yellow cross it was supposed to be

gold

but it was decided to make it yellow

instead because putting gold on every

fly would be quite expensive

but considering our Modern Age

and considering this which flag was

um

not really redesigned but the colors

were redefined I guess that's how you

would say it in 1912 I think it was

a blue color was decided to be lighter

they should have at the same time they

find the yellow to actually be gold

they don't have to make the flags with

actual girl they can use

artificial girls

and yeah

it's my opinion

three Weavers I do like these ones

we have a city near where I live that

used to fly this Finish Line

oh

why is that

I could imagine a private individual

doing it but

you said the city was flying the flag so

it must be an official in some way

hey don't they play Swedish flag at the

Kia stories or something

which of course is not the city doing it

so it's not like official but you can

probably find them sir I haven't seen it

in London Sweden but I'm mean

I don't think they have to do this can

you can you make it smaller please

please

okay you made that one smaller

uh I but can you make this much money

I'll get I'll take care of that

in my moment

no I made it big can you stop making

these bigs make it small again please

please I'm okay

okay these you have to mix my otherwise

I can't shot them

oh no

[Music]

okay I got to 20 deaths are you happy

now

are you happy

yes sir okay I'm going to ignore you

stupid enemies I'm going to the dark

Passage

oh look

doing splints yeah the the ears aren't

animated that's because spider doesn't

have long ears so there's nothing to tie

these animations too

did you see it animates a bit if you do

carefully

something at least

but yeah it's kind of the best I could

do okay I can defeat every single enemy

on this level I think because

these are made small so

I didn't want to go in that direction

I don't want to jump at this that was

cheating it's cute you think her with

ears flapping is cute I

look at that the ears are is the best

feature of a bunny I think

that's why I like bunnies the most

so that was that party yes yeah

clapping ears are the best

that's probably why

my favorite

well that was close

my favorite dog breed is uh Spaniel

which I guess is a group of priests but

I think

so they all have like long ears

cocker spaniel being the currently most

well known man

but does it have to specific to be that

one

it's kind of like the

bunny of the Ducks

it was probably some other dog that is

more funny like

yes the cocker spaniels have a long ears

and some other dogs too

and I do like the kind of fluffiness of

them and how they

they have long and hanging down as well

yeah it's not

only long years that I like I like them

hanging as well

that's why ponpon has hanging is instead

of standing up

so that's some background behind fun Pon

she's deciding a way that I like it

what a surprise

you didn't know that did you

kindly surprised

cute

and she's made to be cute

okay this is

I

am happy about that

hey

hey that's cheating we can't use

you can't use uh homing that's what you

call them

yeah I was trying yes

not always remembering these words

because the English words are always so

strange like homing like it's

some sense it makes sense just because

it's going no it doesn't make sense

because it's not going home it's going

to its targets

that's that's why in maybe yeah that's

why in Swedish we call it Target seeking

but maybe that's something you can say

things too

somehow it kind of sounds

familiar

oh no

I mean I have Master rooms here to eat

so

yeah I'm not at that part I'm at this

spot

and that's a that's a trick you have to

remember

and you don't have to fly

immediately

as soon as you are like

at the top of your jump or something

we can actually

oh my

okay now I'm back okay you can actually

yeah

wait a bit fall down a bit and then

start flying which you kind of have to

do on this level

in a few places I mean at least if you

want to make it easier on yourself

I can see that Hefty

still

I'll take another mushroom please

fun game well that was the most generic

comment you could have read

when

the viewer account was up to six people

before I think it's done back back down

to two again

it was at six pretty long time

which was quite great to see

hopefully more people will show up

again

really free to write in the chat

you know me I tried to be genetic you

know be unique I mean you don't have to

bring anything be yourself

uh within reason and

write something

like I don't know

I'm my first son is a bunny because

bunnies are my favorite my bunnies are

my favorite because they have

the ability to not fire Rockets

and

okay I'll write something interesting

and that wasn't such an interesting

comment

I thought the rocket was up here but I

guess there are gems up here

okay

and it was nothing up here

okay

yeah I don't have to get into the girl

because I've skipped that before

but

I did it anyway

and I like bunnies because one is our

fluffy cute

I like long ears especially when they're

hanging down

I like short tames for some reason I

should really like long tails but I do I

think fluffy things like

long and thick actually nice but

but I do like the short and pointy thing

that pampone has

and

this and my

my Pon pun also has a short name

it's just outside views yeah

it doesn't show up on screen

and that's cute I'm happy you think so

and that was a bigger View

anyone who hasn't seen the full picture

show her

her paws her feet were outside the

picture you know no feet Peaks

no no feet picks up on

I don't know if one of the next sharing

I meant one of the feet

and look at this level this is a nice

lemon

and in this level we can defeat a lot of

enemies by simply charging them I like

it's got eyelashes

I mean for this one uh

it even

to me it's partly

platypus

uh

that wasn't that you but that was like

oh

okay I can't judge that that would be

fun

I don't know what I would do after I've

shot it to fall down die

okay these two parts I can go I can go

there or I can get there

there

um

I will take this word the way

because this way

I feel like this is like like a nice and

closer place

do not feed

not my parents

it's hard to get them very closely

come on camera work with me

she looks a bit worried she's actually

shaking I haven't seen that detail I

cannot just see that she's not holding

the wand correctly but I mean we can't

we can't beat that big a can we just

green eyes

they need food

let's see

like she stopped shaking

I don't know about that then that was

coming on

but she's free

and her leg was clipping through her

skirt but details

and here it is

The Majestic

red springboks you won't see this one

anyways

I've only seen two purples they they are

quite rare not very surprised the red

one

look at that

they have also added how the wings are

attached to the body that's quite a

detail

and I put now she's happy

they're being freed or in the ears

there now I left

you don't see you have to look at Paris

that close up

and after you rescue you see of them

they create a whirlwind and then they

start spinning quickly and disappear

that's what fairies do they disappear

Ed at all

fairies are always on your side orange

hair dull

skirt and I want my address

because the fires have dressed because

it's a friend I didn't see uh

I forgot to look yeah if it had Meats

so hard to see because the

body was quite big on that it was

cartoon sized

yeah that only gives an achievement it's

not a skill point

you

everything is cute in this game

oh I can't do this challenge

sure likes to look up her scared when it

is oh come on what uh what did you do

that for

I just want to print the fairies do you

have a problem with that

are you some kind of guard

like

no I can't even

there you go

one fairy rescued

okay this is going to be a bit trickier

than I

second fairy rescued

well I guess they're first and the third

and now for the final fairy

here it is

order cheese

I mean

and here's the key Chinese or that

a metal

container I could not open before

this looks like that supercharge Ram Mr

arrows on it

which makes it a superstar

and then we fly over here wait wires to

be suiting I have released the button

out there let's open his chest first

so that was a pail but not a test so

it's fine I just have to go back

I guess uh I just have to start flying

because flying stops charging and flying

allows you to also reach that place it

feels like flying and charging gets you

about the same distance

specifically I mean

to be charging and then Super shutting

the whole way or then or flying during

the peak of the soup shot seems to give

you get you the same distance

all right I tried to press the charge

the flame button I meant

and nothing happened how strange

did you missed me why are you

so happy

so incredible very happy

let's give that one you can get here

without the use of that that glittery

thing

I please don't fall down

glittery thing

sparkly scene

they're happy because of the enemies are

happy because of Pom-Pom

that seems a bit weird

shooties

you have to steep it for that

you miss me

still laughing

I don't uh

and you died

no

so that one goes up there and I think

that one goes there

well that's

that's

okay

no wait

this one goes

no I don't think it goes there but yeah

we'll see

I'm I think I'm wrong about that

stick about the previous statement I

think I think this one goes over there

so

so let's fly over here

which means I cannot go there there

unless no I cannot

I can die

I believe I can

22 days

so

I'm back here that's good because now I

can go the other way it was according to

my plan

the save me some time

now we get to 23

I I mean

I preferably not

but if I keep charging this much

probably

there you go

that's all the

all the

porcupines

and

that's not what it's called

all the

light pieces

that deposits

thank you fairies they are so kind

of

nicest people around this world

oh

mystery I mean in addition to Pumpkin of

course

pumpkin is the nicest of them all

because she's actually putting effort

into doing something

I mean I mean not to discredit the

actual effort the invested by creating

these magical swirlies to actually allow

me to get up to a higher platform but I

mean

if you compare how much that does for

the world and compared to how much

activity for the world is a slight

difference

not my match though

and the cute is funny I mean compared to

all other bunnies in this game

probably there aren't many bunnies

oh sides

I can't use this one

yeah that was a mistake

I was I was so excited to use that one

so I could make things smaller but I

forgot I can't use it

is it

I need

not get stuck behind it please thank you

I missed us

I guess that's what I get for being

greedy you miss me

on the towers

yeah let me just pick up some more

regents

I've had their flame different Snow

White that was it that was in home now

that was a

please stop and

know when it's stressful no no

it's too tight

so

I go into the Haunted Towers

uh now I can't do this lemon because

this level requires me to have

flame capabilities

oh no Pom-Pom oh yeah it is a shame

so I can open these no problem

and I can take a bomb to the face

apparently

and then I

but yeah

and then I can rescue this fairy

meet up purple dress and some nice hair

but then I can't really do anything like

I can't do anything about this one

because I can't explain

so

so yeah that's the your voice is kit oh

that's that's so awesome okay uh

it was white that's right it was a desk

it was an experimental death

it should kind and not count because I

wanted to see if I can continue the

level it's a fun level but I can't do it

not without Flame

I should also do a level do a run

without charging

but that is going to get a bit slow

because I have to walk away

so

so is that thing back

it looks like it

shoot it

thank you

but why isn't it shooting this one

I thought

I just increased my

yeah please

you miss me

extra health

okay

I know

but that means I also cannot access the

flight level because I I cannot get rid

of those

I can't get those two but then there's

that one

and that scene just refuses to shrink

them down for some reason

wait a minute why is there uh gem there

what

that was emo

eat me and pushed me down into the water

okay

but look at what we got here

looks like a boss

is there extra Health here

because I took some damage trying to get

that yeah but I've made some jumps here

oh that's good

thank you

oh yeah there are some extra Health in

in here

there I need two

three of them come on two of them do you

have to that took like five five tries

to catch

um mushroom

wow that was close that was quite not

sad if I took damage fasting that

happened

on the fronting Jack

or

as I thought it was he was called a

Jacques

I understand it's supposed to be jacked

and this is a nice thing

this is a big enemy so I cannot charge

it

but I'm logic but it also got methods I

can have flamed

that means it is chargeable

but it shouldn't be because it's a big

thing

hey hey that wasn't nice

I just want the conference check

the case in the Box

let's stop doing that

I told you off once

you don't do it again

that's the release

yes

[Music]

I missed

okay okay here we go

and then

okay

okay

okay

one more try

no

that wasn't so hard was it

took me long enough

a little bit hard

nah it was a little bit easy

and then I fly all the way over here

and fall into the lava

and but I didn't

okay three ignited saved me

you ignited saves me a lot

especially in the you know uh

most spiral

one abilities thingy yeah there's not a

reason for me to take that thing

because I cannot attack those

hey look up watch it you're getting in

the way

sparkly

it's one taking care of that's one taken

care of

so let's see I you can jump over here

right

so

then activate both

get out here

and get a key

and then choosing the jump back

like this

this lifting flat

someone someone is stuck

so back to the beginning of level time

to take the second pass

or the primary path

depending on how you want to look at it

and also one Pawn is kind of hiding the

key I guess

whenever you hold a key

I don't know what I'm placing the key

bottom right

I have a key

it's not showing us

which probably makes it so when I

mentioned the whole thing had the key

and it had a key in that

dry Canyon that was the way like

you couldn't really see if I had a key

or not I do still have the key right now

I can inform you about

but yeah I guess that's the problem with

placing pump on there but I mean

I'm funny so nice in the corner

I did want to but I wasn't planning on

playing today this inspired thing uh

I've cleaned plenty of playing but again

and I was wanted to make this spiral

game window to be in the hardware

and so there would be a

space

I don't know

this is a bit tricky

please please go away please ah please

don't hurt me

that is very fruit

so anyway I make the window narrower

yeah so

yeah

so I have a banner on the right where I

could put pom pom in a chat and

everything

without actually losing out of any game

content

because it would put therefore push

things like you need some extra Health

it's our life I meant yeah more towards

the left

yeah but okay let's let's see what

comment he wrote The Pumpkin looks very

cute today yeah he does she just

it looks away from the game and listen

like that

yeah

can play games without looking at the

game

so time to confront

Jack but that

I probably cannot

and let's see

nope I cannot

oh and

that's the that that

and that's the death level and that's

level over

she looks cool like you are

yeah I don't I wouldn't say Pom-Pom

looks cool

so I guess that reflects me

I don't think I look cool

time to get nasty as well

and the next to be about

time

well

yeah I was I said I was going to

um about this length in the

the stream so it's a good

I could be able to finish up this world

and

that would be the final part of the

Stream

so that sounds good

we don't get there

speeds of this run

you are a cool and smart well thank you

I don't know what to call it

what aspects of me

is cool

but

yeah

I'm also glad you think I'm smart

I like to say that my intelligence is is

a very specific area yes

so

I might appear Smart in certain topics

but then I appear stupid in other topics

my my knowledge is

narrow is that white Saints

me too

to hear us you're also smart

certain areas

let's see

in certain areas

like the brain

okay

with the help of these barrels this

shouldn't be too hard I think

yes

your your brain is very smart

I can do this look I did it

pretty easy

I think that was I mean I don't need

these gems but I said

see how much I think

and if I really want to

um

I mean I can't do this

maybe that's me other wait can I do

something about this no yeah oh yeah but

only once

so in that case I cannot kill them using

that method

and if there is no idea to try

oh yeah I did die I was excuse for us it

didn't look like exactly this way

yeah I better rescue this

dragon

Latin

and then I'll go back here

and pick up that red again

because I'm wasting my health

I'm destroying these wait wait a minute

could I use this all alone

bye

yeah I could have well that's a waste of

Health

well I

I usually don't play the game without

the fire attacks I usually don't have to

concede it as things

but yeah

as well

we got

blue so I got full house and leave the

other rat

so I can give back

come back for it

no there's a red here too

turrets everywhere

yeah I

quite I didn't need to do that I could

have just

eat

oh I'm a bit silly

but there was here

I can't

please recharge my head

is that that sounds

that's the correct term right

so

let's continue

that's

some new viewers here

that I'm doing this run as it said

without using the flame button and I

also

want to see how many times I can get to

have to sacrifice my health like that

is that interest

and then I never got here so I can get

my help back

silly yeah I guess

I guess it's a bit silly

missing

certain details

um

but it has been interesting with all

these discoveries I

haven't considered before

and have now forgotten about them yet so

we can see I cannot do this I can

apparently do

that but I cannot do that with the one

with the TNT because it doesn't put that

far so I should have kept one of those

yeah yeah thank you

wait

that wasn't necessary to do because

again

and now I cannot get through that now

we're just standing there

uh what a waste

okay

no it doesn't drink

would it be fun if I managed it

if it could fly that far

okay these

social

all right

they share what I should have done

not that and not that either

okay I'll consider that a complete

failure

not completely

unlike a lot of moments in this place

room

yeah

like that

and I would consider a bit of a failure

where I couldn't get these rice as well

and here's the key which I

don't need but

it's not cute

I need the other wrap as well

and that's the only way I can open those

oh yeah and now I got this

wish I can use on this one so I don't

have to pick up the key

whereas it doesn't show that I have the

key to my

my pun pun being in the face

second attempt game have keys

it's just those games show anything down

there

oh that happened

what

anyway this is the end of the level

I survived the barrel barrage

and I missed a five five

wait a minute

it must be that thing

no

it was too enemies I can't get wait I

mean powder in them is fine

I am confused

you did it you're awesome

I thank you

and if you don't rescue this dragon that

first hand won't open

it doesn't have to

do that

it only needs to prevent you from and

confrontingness in Ark before you rescue

that dragon

but I guess they are locked all the

heads I wonder if I would force myself

to complete this level

would it still open that's in our set

would it still be waiting for that train

okay this would be an interesting level

because there's a lot of

shooting

I don't have many extra lives because

I've died 25 times

change that to 26

when speaking of dying

um

okay

let me

let me

imagine you

I just want to get those balls

you recharge my health

quick enough

while you shouldn't have your weapon

loaded in

unless you are in an area where you can

safely use it

um

if you're in like a war like these

people are

like defending some kind of

dark place

should maybe have it loaded

I know

yeah I think this enemy is shooting too

quickly

should be a little bit

he is laughing a lot

there you go I got those you can't stop

me I stoled your treasure

he sure has fun

with that gun

with a gun

let's remove this Dragon so I can use

this supercharge

and with the super charge

um

yes gonna unpop anything here oh I

thought it was a small one

I made a mistake

mistakes were made

next

more mistakes were made

you can do it

as sure

I sure hope so

okay they can actually shoot through

this massage

that's actually adding

a bit of complexity

the goal is to reach that air strong

chest at the end

so

this excellent simple camera button but

starting this is an original

I

got to it

and then the eight event currency yes

should I get those other enemies as well

what was that purple

saying that oh it's

it's

was a light

house

a house with a light

because most houses don't have lights

start saying that flash singer

more details I haven't realized Marla

so

now

let me take a checkpoint

let me collect these gems

and now when this area is cleared

I can now

they can have the checkpoints

and I should be able to get the next

enemy I wanted to get

that's that enemy annoyed me and killed

me so I'm going to kill him

I think that's the only fact

yeah how about that

should I give it one more try

you are allowed to give me feedback

yes

because I am streaming for you my

okay I failed

my lovely viewers who are hearing

commenting which I do appreciate

cell and one more Trident I guess you

did technically didn't say I should try

it one more time but this time I will be

prepared

what him attacking me

and I was

come on

I one more

should I

try one more time or should I keep up on

that

I should I should go into that room

because there's trash in that room

so

let me use this supercharge

you can turn around here oh I was so

close

he had a knife

he stabbed me with a knife

okay

because he stabbed me I have to charging

team now

only fish

there we go

that's what you get for

and also without Flame

yeah I can't do anything about this

so

out of Health at the moment

kinda

I got him but then I died

oh so the only doctor I know about

Inspire is Dr Shemp

the professor might be a doctor

I don't know what they are

they are doctor's name

Annie please stand still so I can shoot

you with my head

I don't shoot with my hands but I want

to charge you with my head

with my head I I did charge them with my

bow the bow must cut means something

and juice

do let me know if I'm missing any

that's

it's like I've counted each step

I will donate go back and confirm

I wonder if I can do this

no I could not

that's worth a try

and you stop hitting me it's not fun

or what did I just tell you guys

I'm just a pawn upon like another

Pom-Pom I am bottom

that doesn't make me ah Pom-Pom then you

know what

I'm going to give it a second try

uh how about that you

Knocks

eating it like that did you because now

you're dead

so you don't have anything in the matter

let me just go back and pick up the

checkpoint again I'm I'm

do you would you consider this cheesing

and the the fair is laughing at me

or maybe she's laughing for me because

she's happy to give me a checkpoint

now you're okay

yeah I'm not doing okay but

so there we go

mm-hmm

I guess you were right I didn't believe

you I should believe in myself more

and that's that level

I could probably get more enemies using

charge more

but that's wasting a bit too much time

now

if time is for the big bad boss

a nasty noise

nasty ignore

okay let's do this

let's do the

foreign

8 250 gems that's not bad for not being

able to Flame

in the last level

that I am actually able to access

I will collect your trash and SD

cardio R2 nesting

uh come on

why do you have this

tell me about your key Thief

it might not be an active

that you are

yes as annoying as those are

not having the option to and yeah uh

just as a reminder I am allowed to Flame

nasty Network

because a master norc

it's such that bad

boy

yeah

he's such a bad guy I am allowed to use

the flame

and

just be sure yeah I can still use Flame

good

oh my yeah

I have the option to use playing

it's just a regular flame button doesn't

work

I do have a second airplane button

which

okay neat

the master

there you go and then just yeah exactly

just going to walk through here to make

sure I didn't miss any gems

other 179 kind of a strange number to

finish off this area with

so it does feel like you have missed the

gem somewhere but I went

I activate the key animation before he

hits me so your hit doesn't count

that's the game rooms

oh come on what's this

brain chests in our chains

how am I supposed to chase him again

I'm not there

yeah

I still kind of help reading your

previous camera that's you're not okay

that's not what he wrote but

he's fleeing

375 yeah that looks correct because a

nasty himself contains he will drop a

single 25 that means that you actually

leave the previous one with

odd number if you could remove a single

gem from one to the other area to fix

that

I guess they want it to be weird

for some reason okay

hey nasty I do have flame actually I'm

sorry he is running from the Pom-Pom

he's scared of a little bunny

this bunny is so mad and nasty Network

that she can't

view fire he's back here I don't know

got heat and I tried to press the wrong

flame button

there you go

your toast snorky

yeah skip this don't need this stuff

and there we go game completed in

three hours thread 33 minutes and 33

seconds actually that's the time

about two hours for the three minutes

and one six seconds in game time because

that is excluding

loading times meaning

that it was 50 minutes living

is that really true

maybe there's uh I think it does exclude

as soon as you touch and drag them it

stops the clock until you can start

moving again

and that is is more time the game is

post

it might also stop the clock every time

you open a uh just requiring a key

so there's probably a lot of moments

where it passes the game and therefore

there's such a huge difference plus the

loading times more into keeping it

weren't the best so

that's that

thank you for

staying with me

and I can still press the back button it

doesn't work

um

so thank you all for being here

I would oh yeah I forgot your last

comment I was kind of busy the feeling

last night

I will be too if that money were after

me yeah I mean yeah she was actually

chasing him so

you are so good at the Kim thank you I

might have played the game too much

so

and

yeah I didn't actually see or did get

alerted about the new followers but I

actually got you two new followers three

hours ago since with two like now I

should have mentioned that I also need

to fix something about that so I get

alerted about that

but uh yeah

better late than ever yeah I guess Boris

thank you art Fox Cleo and a mage Mister

for following three hours ago

I guess

clip can be made of that

um yeah

so I need a bunny plushie to break me

from the one pump you need a plan to

protect you from

so

what do we do now

I guess

we'll

do the second game on Sunday

in that case

apparently I guess I have become a

spiral screaming [ __ ]

I guess I cannot stream PlayStation 2

games I have to stream plays in one

games in that case that might work

I'll give that a shot someday

yes yes

I want one for myself

so

um thank you all for being here and

we don't have an ending screen so this

is my ending screen for the house

let's play this one in the middle

so

I don't have a funny plushie

I mean you only have one bunny

but anyway

that the stream will end now and we'll

probably hopefully show up on sunny

if you're not busy that's all up to you

you maybe have one panipati okay

I'm tired it's late I need to go to bed

the

good night

and I was sad on this

good night

doing all the both of you
