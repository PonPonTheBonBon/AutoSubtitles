foreign
I forgot about the time
but I'm seen to have an audition and is
there any audio
aside from my voice I mean
is the game playing any audio
okay
nice to see you here I see that you
found a very interesting team
game is silent yeah I was afraid of that
and there is a solution
um I can just simply capture the audio
from the
because now I'm capturing the video
straight from the capture card meaning
that the video should look much nicer
now
but that means I would still have to
start the separate software and capture
the audio that way I wanted to avoid
that
but it looks like I have to do that
anyway
so
why is this one like
hmm
I can hear you talking yeah that's good
game is silently exactly
and I think ghosts
like quite a big but
very interesting you you run the redeem
very interesting or anything else
already
okay
um for some reason nothing shows up in
this
window but this is weird
now the capture card doesn't even
they got booty yes the cool redeem uh
yeah
it's a
and now it works
okay
okay it says that
I thought you were before but I might be
wrong about that
it says that it is currently
but it says this status is capture
device I assume that is because it's
outputting to VLC it's not going to show
up in this software itself
and the software itself is not giving
any audio
though yep there's nothing there but
the game itself plays audio at the
moment because I can hear it my
headphones
I'm listening to it
yeah
there's definitely audio
I mean I can't play the game without the
audio
streamline currently obs
Dreamland custom money right
yeah the uh audio it's it has an audio
um
like
I'm sorry kitten I I've seen you I
I didn't know what to say
because I'm currently trying to solve
this audio issue
I'd rate I guess I'll just remove it and
add it again
I guess that's the solution
so I'll try that let me just
oh but I have an arch I could just add a
second I think
okay
can I yeah I should be able to copy over
that
can I rename these so I have to quickly
hit the new one every time
maybe I can rename them afterwards
so
it cannot only output a signal one at a
time is that the problem
that's going to be a problem
yeah and then I can't
okay let me create a
backup for all the filters which I will
pick the OBS generic camera
um
which I don't need
see have it show
like that
copy
over all the filters
delete
one I'm actually going to use
re-add that one
on the Fly and now the picture shows up
and it also shows that it's playing
audio
[Music]
so the audio is working now right
oh it works perfect but it seems that
audio is a bit off
for some reason
oh that's because I
yeah that's why
okay now the audience yeah that's a bit
annoying that I have to basically and
then I copy filter from the backup to
this one
again now the picture looks good
and there we go and then I just need to
balance the audio
is obvious like this
why is it so quiet
this one doesn't make any noise
yeah the game is really quiet
but yeah I said I was going to add a
hard command I forgot about it
I guess I'll just have to boost on You
by how much
I guess that much
it's a good volume
it's okay
it's the it's the thought that counts
[Music]
but I'll do it for you
yep yeah I need to note that down
ads hug
okay there's my notes this has Vault
here I see that months captivity have
done nothing to slow that electric
tongue of yours from incessantly wagging
it's just that it's also exciting
exhilarating and chanting and thralling
and yeah all right no more thesaurus for
you pal all of you please be quiet
it is suddenly encouraging that Spyder
has been able to free two of you to
allow this reunion but haven't we
forgotten someone yes yes of course
terrible precisely
now how do we proceed I Believe I Can
Help ignite us well young chaps and to
learn a few things about ice on tall
planes I suggest we adjourn to the
training room so that I can teach you
some more the legacy of the great ice
dragons of yore my ancestors who come
from the best of the best of this
somewhat bedraggled lineage is long and
storied with my help rescuing terador
should be a certain tear your pomposity
arrogance and pretentiousness is odious
to the extreme
shall we
okay let's get back there
I'm only back I got to drive home now
and and I work an hour away from home
and I'm working I
well I don't know when you when you
finished work eh all right I should
probably
yeah that's that's not the Run button
because they walk so slowly
saying oh you go oh you're going to
drive home now okay I thought you were
home
we shall
lights but
button Dragon you will learn the secrets
of ice
I'm doing my best
all right
maybe it's just
[Music]
a kid now it's more balanced
let's just yeah
[Music]
[Music]
beginner's luck aren't sir
yeah there wasn't a question about here
in the game was if they argued at least
hey oh I forgot I need to
days after the dummies
it's part of the priest that means
when they are in range one person
okay doing fights it's not
[Music]
just a little bit by like bunions more
and see
yeah I can see what you mean okay let me
just remove the P boost all together
let's see if it's better than
this is even shorter
no no no no that simply will not do
give me more time
over here
I mean
I guess the music isn't too light loud
hydrate okay after this because the time
let me see sure sure I mean I Stood
Still
do that
that's one more
okay that was pretty easy
it's not completely
can find success once in a while
this way oh mauve one
I'm gonna Pick Your Parts where you
should stand
ing here yeah that's good okay that's
not my face hold on trying to see did
you I shot okay
let me try them
oh project times
[Music]
right from all
right is that like nine of them come
here I didn't count
[Applause]
it one
two
was that two or three
I love it just can't
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
yes yes that's it yes
guess what's in too hard over here
all right in milk because
this time ice Fury
the gems
yeah
you don't really collect them in that
place okay so
it's just Powers up
[Music]
oh
yeah the red one gives you health the
green one gives you friends
does he have limited amount of press in
his game
do you want to give you
experience
and apparently during the practice
doesn't give you experience
and
purple charges these super thing
they need a faster statue
so what exactly are you saying igniters
yes your hypothesis is an intriguing one
mixing to the extreme huh he says he
doesn't know what he's talking about
dude I never know what he's saying what
I'm saying is that Cinder is harnessing
the guardian's power to unlock a portal
that must never be opened well what's
behind this portal that doesn't concern
that's enough volt here there's plenty
of time
plenty of time
plenty of time where we need more time
to have horrible things happen to us why
didn't we just stay in Tall Plains
oh I'm a big deal there quit complaining
Sparks maybe there's a tribe on
Munitions Forge you can save too yeah
but there's always something special
about the first tribe you save
you know
[Music]
okay dude I never know what he's saying
foreign
the locals who live underground have
been forced to mine the metals that the
cinder uses to forge our Army's weapons
but what are the locals called they're
called man response right I need to
write that down rumor has it the cinder
is whole
terrible or somewhere in the mines we
know she's using him to power the last
of the crystal she needs to open the
port free him before she gets the chance
boy is it big it's big but in no time
for sightseeing Sparks
time to get serious let's go ah
not again
I forgot about the place is called an or
the locals Acosta
well thank you for writing that before I
even
that that I forgot about it
wasn't enough power yeah there we go
there's some more blue I don't like you
see the first more there you go that was
enough to Power It Up
and then more of these
love it
I do like fine most the question is is
very good against these enemies
considering
while they're considering the place I
guess
I guess now
well
the rest for the Heat
these
[Music]
I think it's probably does this like
a good amount of damage
that's it
stopping away
saw something over here
okay doesn't matter if I destroy
anything I don't get anything from it
[Music]
so I'm supposed to progress there
but
I think push back across First Press
how
do you take damage from that
you're like something
they love us I must fight
foreign
[Music]
and they're not letting me escape
whatever should I yeah
[Music]
[Music]
I love the eyes
[Music]
but I'm after the ice to the max
okay
I don't feel like guys is that effective
after all
like the tree system but
oops some fell into the lava
okay
[Music]
what's up
how many are there
[Music]
is this emulated are you capturing it is
captured
my eyes in the quality looks much better
now
you can
yeah I guess if you look carefully you
can see the inflation
I guess he could emulate to if you
really like your entrance
and I have forgot to change the frame
rates off the stream oh well
can I get to go up here
I was kind of late with his stream too
what's that who's there
yeah that's why I was curious I
appreciate audio it is a pleasure though
don't carry this bench please
we are
and who are you
leader of the manual smells but I'm not
much of a leader anymore
which shouldn't be long if you would
help me free them perhaps there's
something I could do for you
I don't know we're here to rescue a big
friend of ours
is
[Music]
yes why because I know what he's been
kept in demands there are large level
cap where my own brother ex-humor turns
away we can help each other
which way did we go what should we do
next oh it's simple enough but we've got
to hurry but is it big he's getting more
unstable about a minute we must clear
these caves before we can help your
friend
and you're asking him for directions
wow talk about blind leading the blind
forget him oh yeah we're in
okay let's go through this and what's
difference between emulating and
capturing well
the obvious difference is emulating is
when emulating
the the playing the game on your
computer and capturing it's playing it
on
proper hardware and then capture the
picture and put it into your computer I
guess you could take it no
so in emulating you have a lot of tricks
you can do as well by original Hardware
you're limited to usually limited to
what it is
I can see the interlacing
has that old CRT effect
oh yeah I wonder if there is a filter I
could remove it if it's distracting
but do you want it look nice and clean
emulator looks better but playing it on
Origin Hardware it's different
yeah
emulated okay
well adapt this computer would be able
to even run the game properly
but if can you get better framework from
emulator
etc etc
I wouldn't mind doing like because I've
been playing a game
it's just like
a man wears man's a circuit attack the
crystalline person okay I mean
instructions before
kind of dark in here
Emoji Hardware is satisfying a place to
check in bags like that
this I wanted to yeah I wanted to play
another memory
just for the
I guess reliability
[Music]
or something
and let's uh this up it can become
better
you have to go from composite stage
micro market and capture his life
oh I
I just captured the composite
it seems to work fine I wouldn't mind
capturing the HMI but I can't really do
that
PS3
okay the wrong way and got coffees like
night time so it's late for me
I mean depends on where you live too
um
I got some explosions
is using the PS2 emulators using his PC
yeah basically yeah I want to explain it
emulating is playing it it's on the
hardware that is not meant for which I'm
100 accounts run it natively basically
since I'm using an original
as the first generation of PlayStation
3 which can
if it has like the PS2 built in it does
run it the hard way
if you do a later version of the PS3 you
can run the games it's really animation
is this a secret because it's because
sorry I was taking your crystals
[Applause]
if it was supposed to come here over at
least I don't know
I am not going the correct way
because I did find another one
thank you for
mining the crystals I need for us
or is it meant to be like a landing
techniques
I think it's a medium size
thank you
I have to play Sparrow sword on original
Hardware
[Music]
and
to a relation of Wii modes is not exact
ly I haven't tried to emanate any nuts
but sorry for that paper I hope you
don't need it
[Applause]
oh
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
it's a pain to get I mean I think the
pieces you have tried that before
I think
it sometimes works sometimes it doesn't
and you still need that sense about yeah
or something emulating Center violets I
really wanted
to be the best
so much fun
he's fine not good
[Music]
more leveling up
I'm going to fill out
Focus
this loose
dangerous
oh no
stay back
yeah
anything that emits infrared
and you basically need
for best
I don't know I don't remember if it's
like
[Music]
I want to get something
[Music]
yeah I think I went in a second now yeah
do you and that's on either side but I
think just one works
I'm back welcome back Julie
what are you eating
um
so let's Fire
[Music]
Let's head to the chest

[Music]
remember a second oh here
and this look oh there we go there is
the enemies
oh goodness it's part of the tech he's
his head
ah don't be sorry it's not your fault
just had to remove and re-amp this once
and then correct
I wish there was a wait for OBS to
refresh this voice kind of deleting it
and reacting it itself
and keeping all these settings
down into it
okay
I don't think they can survive
lava
foreign
all right okay
[Music]
yeah I don't think they survived it
I can't refresh browsy sources others
and yeah browsing sources works at least
[Music]
that's a good thing sometimes the
process sources doesn't want to work
at least
it doesn't sound refresh at all
now this place you call it is a bit
better than my previous streams I think
I hope I hope there's a noticeable
difference
okay
okay let's try this
[Music]
I guess it worked
eyes
where am I going now
there we go
oh see yeah just
kill yourself

level
how annoying
Wi-Fi
foreign
landed in the lava and now I've got my
gems
that
hello Lolly welcome
and
I don't know how to do it
have to do at the rate I've only been
never I almost never finished it
well cozy
playing some
Legend of Spider-Man it's the first game
getting close to the end
it's uh some more
so
now uh
hello
cinder's life

nice of them
and kitty core
did I have a kitten here so now we have
perfect
that's great
yeah the tricky part of nursing names
let's see
I'm trying to talking oh now I get this
platform
it
I got hit with the head straight after
raided why do your ads come
at a rate they should they shouldn't do
that
yeah I don't know what trains
so now it's raining
what were you playing
how's this thing going I mean it started
off terribly
but it was rather easy to fix
because I didn't get any audio from the
game I had to re-add the source and that
fixed it
now there's no more trains for some
reason
for that flying Beast is in there the
cinder is in this game
[Music]
he sure is pal he's all safe and sound I
know it's a really thick past stations
everyone will be ready
yeah do your part hey twitch twitch has
been fine
it's um
it was OBS being annoying
let's play Monster Hunter territory
yeah
it was oh yeah it's the it's the one
where you have the butterfly wings
that's it that's the decision I'm saying
um
welcome lady
I mean we're going to free the man we're
Smalls
it was badly okay
yeah the
the shout outs
Larry was playing nothing
oh yeah I fixed it shot that command
needs myself David Spade Sparks this is
really good
uh oh yes Sparks I have no experience
with the voice actors
yeah
so to me it's just one another voice
yeah I'm a butterfly was down there yes
the wings to play
[Music]
I watch the playing that game um
accused exactly how as he likes it
did I get the right foot I spotted his
house
price is a bit odd in this game
he gets for every game he gets weirder
and weirder
gonna get your food and food there and
this is the peak of his awareness and
rudeness
well I have I haven't played the other
language fighter games
I have played this one before I just
want to play Siri something uh
and then I will and then I'm going to
play the other two of course
it's interesting you know what it is
oh
yes I saw him in
on Thursday for the first time though oh
yes that's made me so upset
[Music]
yeah they have they have ruined Sparks
well he looks like that why is he an
[ __ ] I refuse to acknowledge Him
yeah this isn't sparse this is some
imposter to be fair this is like
reimagined fire because this is a
different different backstory
so it's not the original Sparks
I guess we can use that excuse that's
what Spy looks so weird too
I don't mind his personality
Sparks
oh yeah because
I guess it's not spoilage because it's
right at the start of the game
yeah it's completely separate from the
original trilogy
when am I supposed to be going
I've been talking and fighting
there's a door here maybe I should go
through it
maybe I need to do something
to make the door open these look
suspicious
what's that
oh you were captured sorry I didn't know
that was a cage let me rescue him
David yone is tourism technically yeah
exactly
I don't know which games are part of
which universe
you have these three first original
games are here stay no namaste
yeah enter the dragonfly that is the
horse game that should be the same
universe
oh yeah
yeah I just think I saw this before
[Music]
and here's fail I think he's part of the
same universe
The Darkest Timeline
okay
yes okay
I'll just destroy everything
they don't need that does this stuff
okay I can't
I can climb up on it
like I'm doing thing about it oh there's
another one
oh there's another case
now you have me I hope
now I have the strongest place
yeah now it trickies oh I see you two
crazy kids found each other
yeah in this case buying Sparks are
brothers
when you say be careful does that mean
try not to die I'm trying to do that
anyway Comics humor we must get all the
men wear smiles undergrounds
are the whole families together
you didn't sleep their heads behind
yes spiders adopted by Sparks family
this game has Sparks family but his
parents
maybe it's the only challenge
wait the man response are robots
you know
it's probably a reference there I don't
get
I'm feeling inexperienced
that's kind of cute
and
we can see that
yet no aspire's family or smart family
for them or anyone's family
original games
and brothers yeah
okay this one I did this why I can't
update it oh yeah now I should be able
to talk to me
nope
I need a bit more maybe I should
and back
there you go
updates
okay now I can upgrade it nope
[Music]
goodbye
yeah the this game you can upgrade
okay
[Music]
thank you
it's it gets more Hearts forming later
on now let you
we'll see whoops I'm about goodbye
I shouldn't remember the story
so
do I want to go
I want to do something about this one
because
no
yeah anything about that
you wanna see and how long it will take
me to take for me to get there as well
okay
I'm just cutting it up all this
and now
you now have the fury of
parishes and ending blizzard
I hope it's unending otherwise
I will be sad
I
think it's the uh
whatever on the period I think that
that's upgraded
I don't exactly know how this game works
it doesn't really explain things when
that was the whole explanation again
oh you're not dead
and now you did
I don't like how to survived
no house
[Music]
I played he
and so many times the stories
I played it to it like once with push so
I think I'm supposed to continue but I
like these I want the more of these
stories
I don't know if that's is the point of
destroying those this has a more
I guess they can't gain much
and then I connect me toes
I like gems and I played this game
I guess you're getting to experience
this game this way is that this way
let me get the confused of where I'm
supposed to kill
there you go
[Music]
I'm not looking at this
if I see the highest level makes them
bounce around
oh
[Music]
that's different from
if they respond can I
Farm okay lemons
[Music]
[Music]
it should be my
IMO stands for
[Music]
in my opinion yes
[Music]
it's
[Music]
um
something
[Music]
I think personally I think they're
fighting can get a bit to repetitive and
it doesn't really
I mean you could probably bury
but it doesn't
like push you to use different abilities
and you could basically rely on doing
your basic combo
oh that exploded something nice
and then we can do this in those
so you could argue that the original
spies can rip it if I only have two
attacks
but at least enemies by immediately so
[Applause]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
correct
I won't get dams from these
or gems from the water
[Music]
I
see him as she comes through there
and I'm not more of these
I do want to play
to play through every spider game
including
became boring Kings
you see how that kills
[Music]
why you should just be able to step on
those white people just
I can't match them
as much health
and you step on them but they don't die
you have to step on them
[Music]
can't
in person so this game this is a game I
have no it didn't give me Health it
doesn't give me breath
it doesn't give me 11.
oh yeah
[Music]
it's the same in general
maybe I should I
he doesn't have a housemate guarantee
okay let me check my application
oh
I'm going to have that
unless I can
[Music]
I don't know
what I just progress okay
what's the point of doing that
my first bar game was enter the
dragonfly never beat it
I have made a little stream because you
don't didn't want to work but since I
got the dogs the dog's life to work
and I could try the same
method for anti-track tie and perhaps
how it works
as well
I got the last level or class three that
my brother deleted my memory card the
whole memory card every other game
not on purpose though
yeah
I mean I accidentally removed the same
in this game so it happens
I only ever played watched bits of the
original trilities and now I'm playing
through them all the remastered version
that is
and I enjoy watching
and hit the place to him
face but
I want to say like for enjoying watching
you struggle but it's more like watching
you struggle first but then you overcome
and succeed
that's great to see
it's more fun to see someone actually
um
when when it's a Class A Challenge and
seeing people overcome the challenges
there are several streamers that
Face Place through the game without
anything
isn't as fun foreign
back in the day but I do have the really
nice chilia how is the reason how it's
really going for you
original
yeah you enjoy me watching me suffer
I mean the suffering is part of the
family
but also the success
you know I wonder if I'll be better
inspired now with materials and he must
be better I mean
and plus
you have shown that
the I would say there's a clear
difference
before and after
gyms
and Elsa after you get through uh fresh
that's awesome
and that's my TV experience with
I don't know if it had a spider though
but
I can't practice by after finishing the
Press crash
[Music]
yeah you're going back and forth
and and then I was just going to say
something else I forgot
and yeah I'll let you know
well you can you can help
where am I this looks like a place I
should go to
[Music]
that's something
let's go
how did the dynamite knuckle that does
suck
are you free now
Savage
first game still can't be nice in Orange
besides not to worry about you but then
I did Head Start exactly
oh yeah I've seen a few people
struggling doesn't work it's not like
the greatest boss battle
it is quite a challenge
so that's the three levels
quite with Max this one out before I get
the practice
so where am I supposed to go now
[Music]
because
yeah I was going to say that
I know what you said before but everyone
else haven't you can always tell
everyone else to experience but she did
I am probably supposed to go up here
all right
and then I did that timer is up
and then
I do want you have to be changed to be
arithmetic
someday
I've seen one streamer
hello
take that
is this on okay let's bring it
okay
[Applause]
how long until the bus
oh yeah oh yeah yeah that is also I
think I should do I've got forgot about
that
you just should have done sorry about
that
that doesn't work oh I'm pressing the
wrong button sorry
the question was
[Music]
how
well
was Battle three I will kiss
serious
want to see this or four plus this
I set it in 30 minutes but when I get to
the bus
and the I will
cut the timer short
no I didn't want to go there
please there we go
oh yeah and then I should have this one
open
now that's the prediction which I've got
this forgot
what is the bus
all right
yeah this is the bus
you've got a short time predicting at
least never this easy you get to see
them sometimes you're not going to get
an argument from me chief
[Music]
yeah okay this is the bus
the bus is a train conductor on a huge
train
s
okay that's the that's the boss
um
I should
I'll be back in like a minute or so give
me a short moment you get the time to do
the answering the prediction
but I am back
have you written anything
literally me
except I jumped the crash
yeah oh yeah I didn't I didn't remember
if you defeated National I assume you
didn't
in that case the fact that it's just
chasing stuff and trying not to fall off
the ledge no thank you
yeah I understand it
oh hydrate
and thus receding platforms those get me
every single time
at least it got that far
I'm back meow meow meow meow meow
hello kitten now and there's a
prediction going
how will it go from it defeating this
bus
place your bets
yeah okay
that was dehydrate
foreign
some predictions uh our people ready I
have a kitten puts their
I don't see it on my point it should
wait why doesn't it show up on my bed
that is weird
i s i mean it should show up I mean
do the prediction yeah have you both
invested
and for those
I don't know if
what is it yeah here is
how do I get
yeah I want to watch Pom-Pom yeah it
should be
basically at the top of the chat I can
see it but twitch is
the blank I don't know if that's because
I made it myself and not allowed to
predict
oh wait yeah yeah now remember wait yeah
okay yeah yeah if you press the uh
Channel points it's at the top of the
redeems that's another way of getting to
it
okay that's sort it out
can I place your bed place your bed some
Melody dead spiders will take the defeat
this bus Winner Takes all the loser
and we have tissues
uh don't don't think this is nice
you had to close and reopen yeah that's
why we have doing it I mean
great mate everyone ready
so I can close the predictions
before I begin
lasting last thing you have free to
vote whatever you want I take no issues
yeah you're about it
uh Julie are you going to vote or
are you staying out that's perfectly
fine
so I know that I can close it
I think there was something about not
being able to win as a mod and uh it's
only if a mod
um makes the prediction
yeah
and then we can do it pump fun but not
in one try though
that's not what you voted for okay let's
be
and let's begin then
and everyone
who haven't put in anything yet is
it's sorry it's fine it's fine I mean I
did perform very badly against the first
boss
well prediction
part is over time to defeat this boss
okay first part is three you have our
energy damage the bus
if that did some damage
okay that didn't do any damage
[ __ ] I got to run oh fish
all right
oh that's spicy I see
I see
and also one detail another detail is
shout at me
okay phase one is probably easy
but later faces probably will give me
a problem
but one one additional detail is that
it can indicate that one option which no
one has voted for wins
hey you're not allowed to do that
I will instead I will just refund very
much points
yes
expense
because otherwise everyone will be
losing that's not fun
but as late as long as there's at least
one you know that the The Winner Takes
like the wounds
[Music]
okay so now it doesn't want to be
running if you want
okay
now this one this was a four faces
okay okay now now it's getting a bit
Cafe now taking some damage
busted
come at me
trying to shoot stretch
ah now I get the attack again

I picked the correct result here
now you're rich
I'll go back to the temple for help
three thousand
splits
okay
everything back
okay
um
and that's the second time since
I've started streaming that just
disconnects

haven't still got messages through the
chat and everything but just
it just disconnected
so everyone everyone's in there let's
continue
oh that's um it switches down sometimes
I think I don't know it was gonna have
obvious I am on the protection yeah you
did I only died once
um
I should write like
something like that because I had
I'm headed so twitch doesn't
which is actually the twitch part that
is done
I guess to a channel being started them
once more
maybe see
if you have not done anything
I missed the friendly purple dragon
rescuing my friends
[Music]
amazingly yeah
watch out for the lava

they're gone Spyro there's nothing we
can do I don't care ignitis wouldn't
leave me
Spyro he's right I'm right oh my God

them in this mess and you're not ready
to face Cinder yet
time to fight will come but it is not
mal
tese
I guess you're right
let's go
I guess since they are sentences if
the old
and weak ignite I guess I didn't know
ignite this when it works it kinda
I don't know what you call it it's my
fault I failed ignitus when he needed me
most it's just that the sight of Cinder
so close just just made your heart stop
put ice in your veins scared the crud
out of you
yeah something like that
all Warriors feel fear at one time or
another Spiral there's no shame in that
yes it's a proven scientific fact that
the quotient between adrenaline and
trepidation Voltaire please I believe
our good friend here was trying to make
a point
thank you Cyril what I was going to say
is that all Warriors feel fear Spyro but
only the most Valiant Among Us can face
that fear and mess
from what I saw of you on Munitions
Forge you are one such Warrior
when I felt they trained and died once
now is the time to complete your
training
now is the time to face your fear
come
am I the only one still petrified
[Music]
oh come here
nice of you
nice of you
later they serve providing oh I don't
know if it cancels the ads
but very kind of beauty shy gift a
subscription at least now no more ads in
the future
welcome because I noticed that it
doesn't show that you are
and that you are level one bunny
because of your first mark
but I think you can choose whichever you
want to show but I mean if you if I
heard that one
press square to shoot the Earth
academics preparation
it's a good moment to have a heads I
guess
a little bit
a picture on us maybe I think
soon the ads should be over you can see
always be gracious in Victory Spyro

rubbish but we've got to get moving here
oh yeah I don't have anything you can
choose she happens to be right terrador
ignite if you click on the icon to the
left off
the Chatfield

which icon you want to show up as your
subscription

like an upgraded version certain that's
weird
built in twitch icon come on I'd give
anything to go with you young Warrior

the crystal platforms I mean I have been
defeating all the horses already did it
you have to tell me yes sure
all right continue with what I've been
doing so far
that's
super easy
[Music]
okay
place it active now
did you hear someone walking
oh there's there's one thing
why are you talking
we were up there fighting
her convenience that the security system
just allows you to continue by defeating
and yeah I mean
isn't that a security system should do
work defeated secured card and then
disappear the system shuts down
for like the gate open since
our art security system should work
wow
okay okay a big enemy
so I'm making progress
silent eyes or silent this if you want
nice work big guy now for the next one
oh sharp stuff
okay next spell
yeah they have to be careful with me
soon as they don't get stabbed
can I do this
I mean
he attacked me okay I can't do it
because they keep attacking me
okay
my security system I don't think you
want to be part of social security
system
but then for them to get through they
have to kill you
if you're the security guard guys
okay two big boys
can I
yes
not really
how are you supposed to fall down
please fall down
I'm standing on the edge
thank you
I mean you're dead already so

yeah I seem so
let me know what you think about that
outfit
okay I've got the new security system
that I placed when you get close
okay
okay that looks creepy
[Music]
that wasn't down
I mean
someone fell down anyway
because this enemies is too small to
have every airport to knock them down
so long that they because I'm not good
at it
and then die before I get to knock them
down
very nice
Jason spiders
it's a spider
it's a very nice outfit fun fun thank
you I
yeah
well I kind of plan without myself
I had a more app with ideas fun fun I do
have a bit of this I just don't have
money to pay the artists
I want the uh made outfit I also take
ideas too
and then
I guess there's like cosplaying as other
characters related to whichever game it
is
if only I was an artist and kids
kid I mean I could probably just give it
a try okay pick one come on
camera
I want you now
thank you that was easy
and now
I am supposed to defeat this thing okay
it's not it's not something that shuts
down
oh it's parking back what kind of
security system is this
[Music]
stop doing that
I defeat the laser spider
oh you want pamper this up as an Evie I
would like that
[Music]
doing this
outfit
yes Evie yeah I guess I should try to
draw
myself draw myself draw on my own
[Music]
goodbye
[Music]
goodbye
oh you take fall damage in this game
imagine taking fall damage
I mean if if he starts flying before
landing I guess you can avoid it
welcome welcome
nice to see you here too
playing some
Legend of Spyro or hopefully finished
England Spyro
and don't mind the outfit
why are you standing on such a smart
platform
this is
[Music]
ah it punched me
can't wait to turn on for that one
no there we go
oh wait okay Sparks pointed that way in
that case I go this way
but is that the way to continue actually
okay let me go back I changed my mind
I should have listened to you Sparks now
I do something happy
so what you are talking Sparks there's
nothing here
sometimes it points in the direction
he's going
like what thing you should interact with
or something
no uh okay I'll deal with you later I'll
take care
be careful each first
but I only got enough effective at the
moment
good
I'll put it on a queue I guess if I can
no
no
I guess I could shorter the timer too
but it is 30 minutes which quite a long
time
if I just has a starch
but I guess I should never be the timer
not much of a timer it's manually I used
it
you should gather some dark crystals
envelope would want them in here stay
yeah
yeah what's going on here let's party
okay yeah you get the outfits
Within
all right
remember it doesn't exist in this
universe and new girl does the unit ever
exists
of the night exist in November
up here
hopefully my appear up here
[Music]
Byron The Dark Crystal
yeah
it can only be one
Dragon girl in every game
no let's respond down here
another big one though
oh
a star
[Music]
I like the current outfit times yeah I
mean you get a lot of whatever those
points
the same
but if you want to activate like if you
I don't know
because if I do stream in three hours
that means that you get six outfits
during the whole stream
this one is different from the rest but
it cannot counter tightly
kind of level Collision is this
okay
[Music]
so I could shorten it to like half the
time
I I do think soccer means might be too
long
quite a long time
oh no
that's maybe
TV Fire stuff
let me know you see once he has a long
time as possible you could do a 10
minutes option for fewer coins
[Music]
this point of this
you don't seem to do anything
and explode and then nothing
hey
yes
half the time for half the coins
[Music]
50 minutes might be good
for 15 minutes
is waiting I need to compare to what
other
extreme HD but it also depends on the
side of course
nice
now I think
nothing can
change it's fun now
one thing
Miss cuts it
but there we go
second probably keep it like it is for
now
[Music]
I don't see anything
you're blocking the camera
I'm dying
behind it
finger
all right
oh dead already Okay
um
I need to concentrate oh it starts with
punching someone
okay and it shouldn't get too close then
like that
[Music]
okay there we go
here with this one
[Music]
no no no no
what you folks down there online
nope
you're getting better inspired get out
of there
other girls I said I must not
but I know
the enemy is healed
okay
I'll be sure to for us passion
oh no
and you're not going to have a potato
left
yeah I need to be on this one first
okay there we go
okay
that wasn't the Dodge
I just I wish I had a dedicated Touch
button
huh
let's say that now I got to pull again
okay
my my crystal
pretty much shot the area yeah exactly
and it's just
I'm vodka nuts and that'd be bad why and
due to damages
mostly
I don't know
why is that stuff
the camera doesn't pick any garbage okay
that would be very little damage
[Music]
okay hold on let me
[Music]
okay let's do this okay let's do this
that was all of them
foreign
was nothing
that does a lot of damage
it does damage
but it drains a lot better because
foreign
[Music]
yeah
it's partly Crystal parking electricity
what phenotype is that I left it Crystal
type
the kid is up uh
I
sorry I mean the background I didn't
mean to
Bohemian magic speech
laughs
lost touch that one has lost it
[Music]
okay I should probably
um
[Music]
does that make them slow
yeah that's a good idea
[Music]
so great balance taking care of but this
one
oh
foreign
of course
[Music]
you don't steal that one
[Music]
that's fun all right another one
foreign
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
foreign
[Music]
I guess I guess it worked
[Music]
[Music]
fall down
oh I died
those Red Wing must looks like something
you'd find in Monster Hunter oh
that sounds
interesting
he said that everything space without
the Sandra but
Maybe
oh I'm going up
lovely
I'm not finished now
[Music]
[Music]
too many people on it
[Music]
foreign
to that door I assume
I didn't mean since that one here
there's nothing here
anyway because it can fill it up really
quickly
but now it is more electric spiders
[Applause]
do you like ice
foreign
[Applause]
[Music]
maybe I should defeat them with
electricity
do anything here fire no
[Music]
yes
well bubbles or water
yeah what they should do that a lot of
damage to them
there you go there's some damage more
like the pack is quick but it wasn't too
much damage I mean the attack does do my
everything's wrong with what they said
there
they attacked us that there's a lot of
damage but without the drains a lot of
the energies
it seems at the same time
I don't really have a hard time dealing
one of them
[Music]
no don't chase me
anything
Deep Purple Tower is Concepts in this
area because of a few dinosaurs
another one
yeah
too many laser spiders
[Music]
thank you
Sims more
okay
okay another one defeated
then this is the last one
how many lace is quite exciting
I don't know
too many
just
[Music]
that feels I can attack you
oh thank you does that be dangerous for
me
[Music]
Windows Crystal appears quickly
mask making he don't even claim us
I think
I guess you can have masks more like
this
still doesn't matter ignite us needs us
I'm not complaining I'm just saying it
would be easier if she was smaller
a lot smaller
it is very high up
[Music]
so let's push these off
goodbye
and that's fine don't fall up kid
there you go
another big one
right here
and now I'm I'm trapped
you are with me
jump interrupt me
what's up
a bit more
yeah attacking them doesn't wrap their
attacks
they still continue doing backpacks
[Music]
oh I didn't mean to touch that
okay are we going to fight now
foreign
[Music]
[Music]

[Music]

goodbye

I will take a hydrate kill my pumpkin
this is unlike
here
he's still purple and shot because of
the rain
I was just a truck down here or
something
all right or something
[Music]
I was meant to do it yet
no not nothing more of the laser spiders
[Applause]
College
Merry Christmas
laser spiders
trying to attack this one pretty much
helps it's too much time he likes to
like to smell them
[Music]
[Applause]
yeah
at least some more laser spiders
yeah game games like they're not
candidates they're laser spiders
yeah that's more the game change the
name of them
one of the few elements that don't have
names and he just to keep shop what they
are
did I like to upgrade this thing again
nothing
um more lazy spiders
not working
thank you
thank you
I think
[Music]
foreign
I think I missed every single one of
those
it looks like more battling
oh oh yeah and big battle
s
killing your own kind
that doesn't seem smart
oh yeah of course closing Gates like
after soon
[Music]
okay I shouldn't maybe do something
about this cannon
looking
oh inspired today okay I got
okay
yeah it's okay to die he just said that
others names
yeah this can really need to support
having possible names sunscreen at the
same time
there's a crystal over here all the way
in the corner
nothing is good this area is clean
just moving on to more Bells
never seen this one
yeah
it's sad
yeah I don't know if you've got ads or
anything
it says that as positions
it is the legend I can't wait The Legend
of Spyro
but really I don't think this challenge
is possible on the PS1
[Music]
what colors
wow
[Music]
and a possible in the remake
that's what they're talking do you mean
they know
lame challenge no it's just you being
bad
No it should be possible and what's the
wet party do you have trouble with I
mean you should certainly be able to get
on the
did you get did you get this 6 000 gems
and costume as this one
Challenge on this Vietnam
I need 700 gems without the flying hand
oh you still don't have I mean
wait is there really not enough games
[Music]
that's interesting
so can I defeat these things
no I just need to avoid I'm gonna take
them I guess
uh possibly where I miss uh um have
another look yeah I'll put when I have
the time like if you have the time
tomorrow
I can
sing
there's anything
but yeah I did the challenge in the
united but it still feels like
about plenty of gems to that liners
shouldn't seeing
that was something and I'm glad you had
fun with it
and
well since
I'll do it yeah
since the other two games don't have any
requirements regarding gems to such
um
in those cases it says it should be
might be possible
yeah yeah
and
diamonds actually done with my PS4
you'd probably
wrong
this is time please oh another one
that's just iron these I think
they're not easy
stupid Stones I don't like you
yeah that's how I progress
silly give it a go anyways yeah that's
uh
listen
I'm really glad you actually did do it
and I'm going to try
your suggestions
to a challenge too
I'll do
to see when I get it where I could put
him right there
this would be on some Saturday Sunday
but I do feel
random games a kiss
okay rice and Fire
okay you are
trust me a lot of traffic signal
s
there we go
[Music]
e
[Music]
yeah not so uh I should also wake up
earlier tomorrow
let's sleep a little late
[Music]
okay this anime is fine why did it
um this is a sound effect on game appear
again now the sound effects
kinda I don't know
some sound effects
oh
okay
[Music]
yeah they
just killed their own fight yeah
I mean it does make it easier
[Music]
pretty quick and easy
can I continue
let me upgrade
you now have the fury of
Heat
it runs breath
of nature
yes this box this part these are my
these are my stuff
I guess just maxing out electricity now
the need to bet is least I mean yeah I
haven't talked it so I mean it's week
for that reason but
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
you got a big one this time
and I'm getting
hey attack me how many times
I got hit by Shockwave
that doesn't seem like
a Farm location
[Music]
got hit by this really slow punch
[Music]
okay there we go
then yes this one
which is
now what easier to deal with
it she probably got Mr Price oh no what
is this and mine
a Black Knight with purple
magic
electric King is this related to the Ice
King
okay so it yeah they seems to be really
dark so this is just a mini boss and not
like a full bus
coming okay
oh
okay
the pots for yeah
and it is the Ice King but
doesn't it mean I have to fight the
Earth's king and the Fire King as well
how is nothing
[Music]
[Music]
oh no he's yeah
so the ice cream tomato pie is the
electricity King is made of metal
King
this is
else
[Applause]
foreign
okay
speed
this is phase one again no it's
different
slept with a sword
what is that
a boss
we got stunned I was thinking did I die
with hands left
can I do this
one try
squished okay
give me hell
hi someone
[Music]
it didn't work
I guess that's worked as a Dodge I've
exactly what you're trying to do
too much breath still need to help
all right
[Music]
quick attack
I had no attacks left in the edge
well that worked the king is down the
King has been defeated
I really hope this is not earth or Fire
King now
um
[Music]
you did it yes I did it in one attempts
I'm really happy with that
and let's
um
[Music]
I actually don't know how to
had the properly response I'm not really
good with
instructions
okay
I wasn't really good at me I guess this
is
do it
let's be
just a single enemy right how did I
defeat the
boss that had like
three faces
twice the health bars
for example
it doesn't seem like a good idea
thank you
got that strongly
oh
almost left now
defeated by his own
[Music]
I'm silly
break all the crystal charts to allow
the elevator to proceed
doing this
ah okay
have a great distance that seems like
missing anything I'm doing this in this
game
in the short like spikes there's bikes
everywhere
okay so do you eat that
they're still here
[Applause]
first
[Music]
come on
you stop attacking
there it is then
I'm guessing news I've ever seen
because if you give me all the chance to
come down
I mean it's supposed to fall down
Thomas defeat by the way
yeah send away the Enemy at the time
yeah that's
that seems easy
why is it flashing
[Music]
I don't know why it's flashing
yeah it doesn't even give me any enemies
or anything so I don't even get the
point of it
but I also don't get the point of the
flashing
is that in the original game is there
something wrong with
this capture card I mean I understand
why you it just be flashing in this
situation
it was easy
try the other one
I really iron bad
[Music]
I love snake
and that's that
and then here's the spawn onesie
yes
I know right yeah there should be some
element music
okay are you showing here to break this
again I think I got that
sometimes it makes it very obvious what
you're supposed to do sometimes it can
be
50. I think this one is the most honest
our level
like that
I'm waiting not that the elevator is
moving while I'm leveling up anyway
let's level up anyway
now it starts flashing again it has
something to do with it mommy elevator
[Music]
slow elevated at least it's a short
before it stops
oh
oh interesting
I wasn't ready you attacked me too early
that's why I like a countdown but still
an elevates music no all you get is
that's the recipe
yeah even just trying to knock them down
kills them
okay here we go did they remaster these
games no sadly not
all right let's start oh no they are
protected I see this trip that enough I
would like if they did and uh maybe
more like
if they got a second like
19 19 somethings
like every master and everything
the controls
also option between using yeah
spiral traditional controls
or
controls
nope now you get all the answers here I
wish they did
anything
[Music]
because some because they have put the
flame button where this charge button is
foreign
wash the elevator time
[Music]
[Music]
they should remaster and make sparks not
ugly as soon
so I would imagine
[Music]
[Music]
stop doing that
oh right someone stepped off
doesn't that mean there's a lot of gems
down here
you can see me
oh another one
yeah he didn't see what happened to the
other one that I pushed down
yeah we should move a lot of gems down
there now
let's get toasty humps for some reason
bye
go down and see
I guess they are
unless oh yeah I wanted you to fly
spider
there's no level up anyway oh here we go
other than I have to wait for this
location
uh maybe that wasn't a good idea
so much head back
it's a way it's a quick way to get rid
of them but that's a lot of
a lot of slow elevator times so maybe
not last idea
music
finally the elevator moves fast when
it's going down yep
that's the only time it I mean
I mean yeah going down it can just let
it fall down for the
by the force of gravity but when it
moves up it has to actually push it up
and it's a heavy elevator
yeah if I stand close to it
there we go
yeah that's the next stop
okay
[Music]
now apparently
further remove the stick
slowly go oh I mean
the last seam of the stick the slower
the camera moves but as soon as you
release the stick it goes back
so what's
the position six should determine the
position of me
camera I don't know
you should get there by next question
I will see you next week
Careless Whisper place over there
elevators
the feet in there
yeah I was going through it anyways so
these careless side well this bike goes
to the
different teams just for my most likely
yeah
I've been thinking of doing some sound
routines
can I have to fit
okay that's the
Queen's picture thing
all right cutscene it's Paris is a
purple blush
okay
spiral what
I don't like this
feels like she's baiting us I'm getting
smarter
well at least Sparks like a admits being
stupid
trap
here before Cinder gets back
yeah see there's nothing here oh wait he
Clips through the floor
this is so big
time you learned how complicated life
can be very big
we missed Spire oh it did his fire
run Spyro
save yourself
but it's more slower
bring it
bring it I'll bring my all
right I don't get full health
great health
I'm sorry
stop attacking whatever you leave you
have
okay I need to I need a plan
[Music]
okay that doesn't work
does this work
snap
take damage
okay
okay your attack is way too long
I slept
okay can't
yeah I also forgot the uh
forgot the uh um
yeah
prediction for these battles but I'm
pretty sure I'll die more than four
times
I don't think we need a prediction
don't do that
[Music]
okay we can't we can't do this no
[Music]
that one
[Music]
oh no I was out of range
I was a problem inspired
probably let your spider is that
spider is so slow when it comes to
dodging I moved into that state
and yeah so yeah Aspire is too slow when
it comes to touching
and the build up on a pack of the
opponent is too quick
you have to
yeah so yeah
I should have picked up health
[Music]
I was out of range
foreign
[Music]
at least
come on I just got my health back
stop chasing me
uh
oh
okay okay
let me just see what's going on here
you think that's a nice voice wait a
spider voice pie and I sharp Woods yes
Queen summer is the I assume that's the
voice of Cindy yes he is
Boys by Chris Summers
seriously from Rugrats number five from
kind of names kids next door which I
personally have no experience with
because well I watched those in Swedish
the circle very Talent voice acting
incredible
the fire dragon guy sounds familiar too
the tail attack sounds like a weep I
guess it is a weep attack
is David Spade
I don't know what it is
no not Sparks the one who is captured
who touched by Sir I think it's scary
old man
can
you yeah let's just confirms that
and I was thinking you have to look at
that
I think I have the strength
I mean that I guess guessing is fine
it's easy to look at it's basically what
I mean because I she already created
everything somewhere
quiet until the Joker joins the party
isn't that
what thing
it's the first one getting a lot of
famous actors which I think is silly
foreign
I don't really buy a video game for
famous actors
it doesn't get silly like
because I have I've had people suggest
that I should watch something because
there's a certain famous person in it I
don't even know famous actors
so it means nothing to me
oh
and I'm
getting here
now she's hot
[Music]
it's in there please stop I'm just a
young dragon you're evil
and stop showing me your butt
some reads
why didn't I kept in a house
attack Nicholson
I know by the way why aren't you doing
anything you're standing there and
taking diamonds is it is quite a bit
because quite the hard shot apparently
because I felt bad outside and how hot
spiders move well like I don't get how
I'm supposed to play this game
in that case
I did together once
but then died
she's so fast and attack so quickly
I am less surprised about that one but
no that's excited then I got inside
shampoo boys are characters in red
versus blue oh
and that's far more obscure and inspired
it is which character did he
boys
some one of characters
can't stop them
[Music]
yeah I'm I'm having trouble with this
fight
[Music]
[Music]
am I supposed to do this
no apparently no foolproof
okay it doesn't work on that okay
is actually focused on me now
oh
[Music]
I just have to avoid
her mouth
and tail uh
that when I found them
this way you can do it
again I don't think I watched that much
they watch quite a lot of red version
blue but
waiting to freeze
I don't think
this is
I don't think that comments would be
spiral
you and Cinder share more than you know
it's time
I told you the truth
all of it
you see after I took your egg to the
Silver River
and returned to The Grotto to find out
her chaos she might save these fights
until tomorrow I bet for how long
with us both hours
we will accept one to be fair I've been
playing a half an hour over time
to prevent
the bird you are right about that needed
a dragon I forgot to check the camera
Spyro only one born in the year Dragon
could
have been so close to anything
finishing the game
I'm afraid so but if we come from the
same place why is she so so evil
monstrous big sexy oops did I say that
because Spyro after the night of the
raid
she was corrupted by the Dark Masters
poisonous powers
Twisted by his evil law
she's become the dark master
but why yeah of course the only Master
female dragon in the game should be made
from the portal of convexity yeah
considered sexy Havoc across the realms
and if Cinder gets there
he just might succeed
[Music]
I'm afraid
we might be too late
no I refuse to give up I'm going to stop
Cinder and the dark master
wait you uh you heard the dragon's fire
we said too late we'll get him next time
come on champ you did a great job and
let's let's take five no I'm ready now
okay
you're all right hello Clay welcome you
have to try it's only reason there how
much this game is
too sexy I mean they made
sex injury United so
[Laughter]
I guess you are correct about that why
they look after us all
they made they made the female
characters less sexy and they made the
male guys more sexy they're just trying
to balance it out okay
convexity
funny but unfortunately now it's about
the money
I mean
I think
this battle is that long unless I've
failed a lot so
I think I could
end the game not too long time
[Music]
honestly this is a whole world I'm gonna
see a whole lot more come on
it shouldn't be but it is it's just
now this is the cinder battle okay
in that case I can hopefully finish this
panel here and then the spiral Legends
pirate Adventure 2 begins
tomorrow in that case
it's a weird place
don't jump on this
it wasn't bounce
I wanted to be bouncy
they probably have to pay
the voice actors again they did every
dub
ignited so
what does this do it no no way
so if they did redo this game they will
probably
voice it
comedy
[Music]
I got up there I don't remember
pretty expensive but yeah
I could imagine that
one million dollars
what's this game but oh
[Music]
yeah this isn't going to work what I'm
supposed to do
that's somebody oh that's I'm not
supposed to do that
inspire you that
I didn't even get the center
okay I'm up here
well he tried but yeah no more defeating
isn't it
I'm not even supposed I'm not even sure
what I'm supposed to do
thank you
hello
kinda
[Music]
like
[Music]
those fish things are cool actually I go
there but then I don't get up
I mean
why can't he just fly
I don't really use that area
I can't reach like this area
I'm not sure if that helps
it's like that immediately because it
came from mechanics
yeah because he let's do it
he can't fly freely he has shown that
huh
yeah I'm not sure what I'm doing at the
moments
this feels like I'm going back to the
start
it didn't help anything
I think the path foreign
this is different
I guess this isn't the start it's just
the level is confusing
yeah this is the continuation
okay good I'm actually making progress
not the
clearest design
um
right that worked somehow
yeah the stuff was probably somewhere
okay
Linda I am here I know you can see
that's not how the platform looks like
Master returns
we're too late
yeah
consistent little fellow aren't you
this is where it really ends bring it
no mercy this time
I can't watch this
okay yes let's just continue
all right
Kim
happy
maybe I shouldn't stand on the side
closest to the
[Applause]
[Music]
it's very
late
I'm not supposed to be on this side
I just have to work it out how cute
each face because I don't have to
restart the whole battle unless you
change the rules
stop attacking spider
[Music]
that includes change the Inspire that's
not that loud run Spider Run
get away from the evil
dragon
okay
nice it phase two done
all right good that he stopped breathing
fire when he got to me
are you done
you want to come find
thank you
that was somebody to find how about that
uh uh it wasn't for president why are
you stop stop lying around leave
something
now he has got hurt but
you're going to take more damage if you
don't do anything
why are you running
why you have to do running
I had to be more fire
back in
I can survive fire
[Applause]
that's right
he's especially to society
yeah let's fight
what are you doing
and it moves back
thank you
okay if you did a fly one more time
you don't even try to hit me
what are you doing yeah
[Music]
okay push out for that
well I guess I did
try to die but who cares
succeeded the next phase
for now okay
[Music]
oh
I almost learned Deep Dark Tower
yep no it's time to unleash the true
Dragon within you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
she is just like me
smart weak and dude we gotta get out of
here now
I can't leave her behind
save her
what save the beast that's been trying
to kill us yeah that wasn't her fault
[Music]
now we can go right behind you buddy
[Music]
[Music]
mommy fluff my pillow
better spiral
not really ignite us more has seen this
trained every last bit of my strength I
can hardly lift my head yes it will take
some time for your powers to return
but they will in time young dragon
they will in time
Cinder ever since I failed the night of
the raid
I've dreamed of this day it wasn't just
you ignite us we all failed be that as
it may
we're together again now
thanks to Spyro
well done young dragon thanks ignite us
but we still don't know what's happened
to the dark master
no matter Spyro there will be time to
talk of the dark master later
now it's time to be grateful for your
success his success what about me just
cause a bunch of weird stuff doesn't fly
out of my mouth doesn't mean I didn't
help you now yeah you were a big help
Sparks no doubt about it
but just for the record a lot of weird
stuff does come out of that little mouth
of yours and what the heck is that
supposed to mean
you know I don't need this
I could have stayed
where I was appreciated but no
no I just had to help the poor help us
dragons rid the world of evil whatever
yes they're saying I get no thanks yes
and I thought voltear talked a lot I
left home too you know
yes yeah that's right the Llama people
he belongs to them than they are to you
and did I back away
why because I got moxie
I'm a tough cookie
I got class
I got a
I have a boyfriend there is
too early
[Music]
not even a thanks hey how you doing good
let me buy you a drink
we should go back to the swamp
mom will make it all good
Tommy always does
game
yeah so
[Music]
do you think
[Music]
that's I should share without the other
one
[Music]
but too far
so how are you
anything interesting going on
right it was better today it's two hours
earlier so I'm not tired Shaft or stream
getting tired at the end
with this extra hour of gameplay just to
finish the game
seconds starting next game with the next
stream instead of starting next game in
the middle of next stream
the battle didn't take that long
and less than an hour at least
yeah these
Lolly has created emotes
hydrate
oh the music changed
[Music]
having thanks to our partners spouses
and families who put up with us being
away while we weren't working on this
project
welcome to the world
yeah
[Music]
I assume
it's too fast to read but unless it
doesn't take too much
ah thank you
I I really like them
the sharing one is amazing
the
[Music]
SE girls one looks I like I like the way
it looks
[Music]
and there are like
I did think
it is cuffs one has very thick black
borders making it quite easy to read on
a small size it's probably the problem
is getting them to work in a small size
if I may come with a slight criticism
it's
it says that
this one I had I I know what it is now
after seeing it in large size or not but
I had had trouble seeing the wave in in
it
and
I don't know
[Music]
it is easier to tell what's going on
when you know it what it is
I guess as feedback
[Music]
hey
this yeah I guess the hand isn't as
obvious when it's in smaller scale
that's about it I think specs yeah I
mean it doesn't matter much I guess
it's always from name
Jessica yeah maybe oh here we go
[Music]
here we go
but I've got a bad feeling
me too
[Music]
I got the bad feeling
yeah yeah the ears
feeling up of the whole background
I think if maybe if the hand had a
secret outline like how the scuffed have
the guidelines I think that might help
seeing the hand
oh interviews
does it
oh swamp so this is like
New Game Plus
it doesn't have it
it's bedtime now bonus oh yeah it's the
end of the stream now
you know
[Music]
so
[Music]
thank you all for staying through this
through this
spiral Adventure
same thing tomorrow
same channel yeah
that of a spiral
the legend I was waiting
so
yeah I should
do this
you know anything but
using my headphones
if you hover over on the computer you
can see it's sick like the rest of yeah
I mean yeah at the I did look at it in a
large size and that's why I finally she
had released I might just be bad at
reading these pictures
so
that's a what I can provide
so let's do
the end of stream rate
I think
I'm not sure what else to say
let's visit randpian who visited these
three months
