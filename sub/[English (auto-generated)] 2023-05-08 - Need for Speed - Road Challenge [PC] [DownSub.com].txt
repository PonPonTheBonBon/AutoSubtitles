hello welcome
and
hello kitten nice to see you
I still have no idea how to introduce
the Stream
so
hi
hey hello nice to see you too
this game doesn't play any audio until
I'm
putting them Focus for some reason but
let me know if they are well the volume
of the game is good because it might be
too loud
Edge
or Edge
nice to see you here too
do you like bracing
so but now we did a game audio which I
hope you can hear let me know if it's
too loud if it's hard to hear what I'm
saying
with the mouse
well
let's
let's yeah they're like facing Caves
Great so this is a funny
um game I guess maybe
yeah I can hear it I'm great good
but the question was
but I guess I actually asked it but yeah
the question is more like is the Audi
volume good
skin can be a bit loud
anything here and give this America
let's create a Pom-Pom so you can play
okay
and you can I can afford two cars
so let's
it's the BMW is that
three
little down the patroni
or
the emergency studies
SLK T30
average 30 bucks Paul will make her card
pink
oh
did I make it Pink
yes
do you want
do you want to party I don't like her it
it makes the games quite
do you want to participate in
in
there we go now we can vote
60 Seconds
okay
another thing there's so much
information to
think about this cars The Game signed
that it takes
and yeah I can't make it Pink I should
probably make it Pink
I don't have enough room in my yard for
30 years
you don't
Mercedes plastic more balanced
that is true
but it has slow acceleration but it has
high top speed
it has higher handling
and game says it's overall better
okay everyone has voted uh in that case
it should cancel it automatically oh we
got the message here
promotion and now
in that case you just type
exactly
good good
job
did you also ban the user because
obviously if you come in like that you
that's an Instagram
just making sure it isn't actually
specified here but I can look at
others that's
it I didn't say that all right that's a
bit stupid but anyway everyone will do
for the same one let's pick that one and
start
so in this game you have money so we
start off with
187 500 crowns
because it's Swedish
and this car
oh my God it fits make it
which is set to Pink
on the cost 150 000.
this is nice again it's a cute pink I
never actually wanted on this new piece
so I can't find any questions
[Music]
[Music]
with the color tab it is a contact
yeah pink is cool
or do you think it's ugly or something
you don't like pink
yeah this is a nice thing look at this
now let's crash this
100
and that's it the car has been patching
so
you start in the European tour
and have a sweet track tournament
I understand you have money and when you
win or when you finish the tournament
you will get paid
according please nice car here it looks
a bit wonky big old games
a weird 3D graphics
if you don't mind that
[Music]
it's using the same text here I'm not
gonna be too stupid anyway
let's see how that
and then you have to
spend your own money
and as you race
your car will take damage
and then you have to pay three packs and
the Damage one
affect the performance of the car
and three zero let's go
though you cannot
Drive
and bumper cars
you actually have to take care of your
car
three two one go
[Music]
um
let me drive first and then we'll see
actually sit in cars when I drive
because you sit in my family right I
don't need the I should have if you
decide without because
that's up to me
yeah
these are veggies I cannot believe it
like this yeah
this is nice
to get more
it's it's just a game
demolition
[Music]
I have the damage of your parents
everyone's done
that's a small amount of Defense
this thing comes wrong
because
car insurance cover down she's sadly no
not okay you want to speak okay let's
see how it is
[Music]
replacing games
each other
[Music]
[Music]
your mic is a little bit quiet
competitive game on yeah I asked them
I don't I don't have a password yeah I
asked about that but everyone said it
was okay
I would love the game a bit more
hey
how much of this game is playing on you
so we'll try that yeah because it's
important to
and then I need to press continue as I'm
holding the
right thing
so
and then
skip
yeah last my mom has that last position
I'm so bad at chasing games I use the
plane if you speed up yeah I'm trying to
read when I'm trying this this is not a
good combination
it's a little bit on me implicitly It's
the final lap
now it's good yeah but if it was bad
before we didn't say anything yeah
reading and driving not a good
combination but
it adds a bit of difficulty
[Music]
yeah I want the
the substrate yeah
so I wanted to uh I do like racing games
I'm just checking back and forth here
there we go now I am first
I was drawing of the road
yeah
we break in the game now I will I should
probably
[Music]
yeah I get I get used to the in interior
again
[Music]
see if I can like this
[Music]
corners without
crashing
and as soon as I get to the code and
read the comments
yesterday
I don't leave stuff to us
nice
as you can see I'm going to take be a
bit careful here around this corner so I
don't crash and then I run straight into
that tree
that's not good for the car
[Music]
slap you've won the race how is that the
best left right
that text me and drag so no I'm not
texting are you seeing
I'm using a voice to text voice like
yeah like it's Beach taste what I don't
know dictation
upon what games are you good at aspire
and
I do want to
so and then yeah can reply you don't
have to have to repair
I would like to at least focus on
repairing the engine
and I said that
was that Scotland I think it says does
it say on the screen no it doesn't
but this should be Germany
you should add it
and I played the question racing a lot
yeah I'm not good at them and that
um
quite the arcade
now my brake light is broken
[Music]
what
is special
yeah I did that no flame challenge that
required some yes
and it does very must be loud if you can
hear them from inside the car driving
after five left
that's um
yeah the windows open let's say that
about birds yeah
that's looking a bit rough
that's
that it does
wasn't too careful on the last race
I don't know why the
nine so there's the gem of life
the science looks a bit squished
24.
I do like that the road signs and
markings
are actually correct depending which
country you're driving in so this is
Germany so this would be the European
size
and European Road markings
[Music]
of course
get the tape the car is holding together
it's not scraping on the ground at least
okay I think I've been driving on this
track the most about things
landline scrapping against the side of
the throat
another car approach
and the engine is
standing is fine so now
a little sharp down here
[Music]
final lap that's two laps
I think the windows broken after his
thing is that she had
[Music]
yeah
[Music]
okay I have any comments
if you think the car is still in good
driving condition after that
okay
I didn't think much damage from it
yeah 100 on this road I don't think so
you need more thing
yeah everybody
in real life that shit's damage the
correct point I love that feeling
it's not the best surface to try fast
across
[Music]
okay
so far you're driving skill is good
but eternally can use everything where I
could still do whatever yes
um I am using a stick on a controller to
turn oh oh
if I had a steering wheel my turning
would be better
and it would be nice if the game would
smoothen out the turning
think like
I'm scraping against the one
[Music]
these are some body damage just laughing
or whatever boy car
all right
that's your best lap you place first
things
first place uh yeah because I mean
the formed at the moment
but it's fine
it'll hold up
because the passengers such I don't need
it I'm just going
I don't know I don't need to know what's
behind me I'm going forward
so this must be France I think
and that left the wheel is three nine
two one what
did they
what happened to my controls
controls are
right
I just want to read race to the
controller
what
the game
the game can be a bit weird
give me a short moment it will take a
second a minute
I am
activities
wrong one uh
I'm basically
oh right
now
to make the game work
thank you
but does the game show up on screen
yes it does good
Alex
should save okay that's the same play
one that didn't lose everything now it
should save everything so I can just
continue from where I left off
so no less
it's nice with auto savings
get the flex tape
and you need to find that rear side view
mirror first so now it's working
three two one go
get meditative and some Open Dreams
[Music]
okay let me take for this car is holding
wealth together
unlike my sentence
but I mean okay it's not going to hold
up and together trying fast to do this
this
month Street I don't know streets where
is why is there a horse
there's a horse in my car
that must be a loud voice
so driving around
France
[Music]
which has
similar
I guess the game is basically isn't
exact same
exact same stuff from Germany
[Music]
sliding around too much
since the countries have
very similar signage
and that's the point of designs in
Europe
so even though they speak to completely
different languages the signs are the
same because the science doesn't don't
have any text on them
[Music]
the person speaking French and only
French can drive in Germany without
tissue
It's the final lap yeah I need to read
your text in your long taste I do
appreciate longer comments too
that's not what I'm trying
[Music]
all right stay on the road it's it's a
bit bumpy and since it's just the two
laps that's really quick so
shorter comments are easy to read I wish
there was a way to
for me to see the comments and drive at
the same time instant
because they are off to the side
placing them in the middle of the speed
never chat with each other at the moment
[Music]
but it's the half in there
I can't read that I mean I remember
driving home from Texas from California
then it's been a long time
I hit a snowstorm in the mountains
and a tree branch gets blown into the
driver's side of my car and took out the
mirror but
[Music]
that sounds bad
that must have been scary too
[Music]
too many manicures here
same thing happened to me
uh what I was done in Canada
turning around the speed of sound I hope
you didn't drive around this bit of some
um
many branches taking out 13 years
that's your best lap congratulations you
thank you first thank you
this embodied voice
on the score
everyone during the same congratulations
you have successfully completed this
circuit you
well thank you
Here Comes the Money
anytime now
here we go
now I have
the
honesty until the next circuit yeah I
should probably can't be there also I
must like presentable for the next
phrase I start by a truck stop brought
another mirror booked bought another
mirror
wait for nothing the kind or my car this
was too small so I also bought click
near Cape and just put that on yeah that
wouldn't go through and
foreign
English
inspection
yeah
of course thousand I have money for that
now the car is presentable for the next
race
that could join the body
the uh
can't take
but something I said before
I'll get good but have a fun stream
thank you lolly have
foreign
so that's
continue with the seconds
packets that's what they call them back
to Celtic runes I think I said Celtic
before
and maybe I didn't even delete them but
Celtic runes I mean the continuing
healthy greens this must be three two
and then go where to show this is
Scotland
[Music]
and now it is raining meaning that the
grip is worse
for me
the game doesn't
[Music]
seem it doesn't treat around the face
extension computers well I get tackled
that's not nice really am I oh and the
body didn't take damage from that
apparently
and it's dark too
without the other side
I mean I could use the
dashboard inside the car if it wasn't so
low quality
not that I really use the files on the
side of the fish
Chinese juices
in the game isn't too simulating
it's fun
this game
and like like C3
this game it's also easy at the start it
will get harder
but it doesn't have that
difficulty leave let's call it that
suddenly it became becomes really hard
this game is a much smoother ramp up
oops I hope no one needs that sign
but it does feel like to compensate that
the competition don't use the physics
engine they Drive slowly
thus make it easier
but yeah let's get through this European
tour
and
get some more difficult challenges
I think the next tour requires the next
um your car
uh a car of a higher class
there are four of them
I don't really know why they start on B
perhaps I just ran
into some stones but the car is fine
um and I'm turning more on the grass
than the last one perhaps and now that
was an accident
so so the game starts on B rank
and I took care of that sign team
and then it's a
and then double A and Triple H
thank you
okay I
[ __ ] keep track of the chat I think
because of changing the strings
yeah upon are you scared to play games
with blood and gore in it it's not
really I guess I would seek out to play
I would be fine playing such games
but it's not like if it's the goal of
the game let's see it can contain that
but
won the race not if like that's like me
point of the game
let's go continue
to good Adam that should be ones
and there were a few other things that
happened over took a month to fix and
five thousand dollars
that's a lot of money
multiplied by 10 for my currency that's
a big birthday
[Music]
if this house in Swedish crowns
I'll look back you gotta get food
might be like
soon enough
yeah it doesn't write out the timestamps
on the covers which I'll say that
we do this better
oh there's the horse again
horse gets scared my car starting by
what's welcome hi thanks now a rock
challenge it's a singing
I love this game Namaste nostalgia
love the music from
what is
oh okay wait do you know the names of
those two songs that they made or they
made multiple songs
[Music]
of the headlights are broken wait what
you mean by headlights broken
if the headlines are broken it will be
very hard to drive during the night
don't remember if the headlights can
break in this game
the visual effects on the car can break
maybe the headlights can't break in the
game
should I think they care then yeah you
have to be careful about that's the
driving night
message speaking of real life well in
real life you are saying it's not
European airlines
yeah headlight besides
on my car yeah probably but it's not
night driving so it doesn't matter for a
moment
foreign
he goes to inspection
that's my
yeah
okay long message
I apparently quickly there just ran
straight into that
I can't read the comments I just
getting a straighter rail then this is a
very
this this track of this track this track
is very wobbly
and I see the European name is raud
challenge yes it is
okay
like I can't I can say this
[Music]
sounds like burning hotspot
or burning outside again
please
Taylor
okay like this out okay
yeah you can get pulled over or a broken
headlight in your life yeah
I mean
you kind of need
make sense
whoop
I saved it
some songs I like account
ing shifter
and Calista okay both songs thank you
because there's a funny thing with the
songs
[Music]
because the problem with songs in video
games
there's a Hot Topic about this uh these
Corners if because I try to follow the
rule basically that if the game if the
music is made for the game I would
consider that part of the game and
consider I'm streaming the game I mean
I'm showing the graphics of the game and
the sound effects
so I would assume that I'm allowed to
play the music as part of the game
but some games have licensed music music
not made for the game
[Music]
yeah headlines is out
and when the music is licensed I cannot
play it and I'm gonna say let's but I
got two of the lights then so it's fine
and repair rest of the car
after the last race
Durham Road this is in England
and looks like a boot
so anyway so yeah so if the songs are
licensed
for the game
I cannot play them
but if they're not licensed three it's
fine too kinda go
gonna make many many
Rift because
yeah I have like Nostalgia Japanese
songs here
[Music]
right place please with my brother
are we the same person
I can do the police chases yeah
we did like different things yeah we did
like princess police chases with like
both the police stop in there
there is a stand driving traffic and
also
try to drive around the track by
following the traffic laws which does
not trigger the police foreign
[Music]
and that's what could also be any type
of challenge to
oops if the police starts chasing you
they have to stop but and then you
should get around the whole track
without gonna stop the business anyway
that's uh
anyway regarding music because there's
one notes so the music in this game are
made by different artists but as far as
I know it is made for the game
that I would consider it safe
to play
but
all the music Still cooperated by the
creators the
producers of the music and not not
corporates to EA
however one song
was listed in the credit as not for
broadcast
which is the song roll the dice
okay I don't know yeah
and since it that one was specifically
listed as not for broadcast I decided to
remove it from the game
as a necessity
or streaming and I replaced it with
another song from the game from the menu
[Music]
which I don't remember the name of
because it doesn't really
I think it's the song that plays me the
garage
it sounds like these throws aren't meant
to raise them I wonder why
80 that should be
miles per hour how much that is
in kilometers per hour I don't know
someone quickly comrade
80 seems like a
fast speed t-shirt
what
I should divide it by actually multiply
by 1.6
I cut them today
did you say speedometer and
it says that 50 miles per hour is 50
kilometers per hour
but that's an improper speedometer
well it sits
50 150 miles per hour it says 80 160 240
limits per hour that's not how it works
congratulations
successfully completed
you have been awarded to gold medal
money
we don't have to wait for this clean
congratulations you have successfully
completed this tier you have been
awarded the gold trophy you're ready to
challenge the next tier
oh
are they kind of tears his tours
I don't know
I think this is plus four honestly wrong
good game
Elsa why do they call it high stakes
torch shouldn't this big the road
challenge tour
and this game is called Road Challenge
I don't think I can show it anywhere
uh
let's see
a pun if you play Castlevania curse of
Darkness I would definitely help you out
of the math game
I would like to
wait yeah this is only B Class let's
repair the car
so and
there you go headlights highlights
the car is not broken anymore
but this time the entropy is 13
125 Swedish Crowns very odd numbers
yeah as far as I'm a worthy of
to do yes as far as I'm aware
they produce the music on the EA 40s
game yeah because when I tried to look
after music online all I get is
this game only I cannot find their music
being part of an album or something
I think it is safe I'm taking the risk
mysterious on the 14th okay it is
actually 120.
they were they were too lazy to
translate I guess but why everything
came in if the title is still in English
that's
the case in does it say no not loud not
the loading that but when it goes back
to the menu
now I think that yes says NFS that
doesn't say the name of the game
yeah that that is a strange thing when
it translates Titans
[Music]
three two one go
I mean that Road Challenge is quite uh
[Music]
generic title it's a challenge on the
road
oh here we go here we got some proper
headlights now I just shouldn't break
them
yeah
clipping through the car a little bit
doesn't mind that
so far so good
still European tracks will get some more
International tracks these are
international tracks I mean every track
for me is international but it's not a
Swedish track
I guess some national tracks with some
of you
so this is the German track so this
would be
someone's home track
there is a German flag on that no maybe
they don't have the German flag up
during the night and I don't remember
if this game does that with some games
to have a separate night and day track
even though
it is the exact same
everything is exactly yeah I think this
game actually has everything in eye
tracks even though everything is exactly
the same
or something I don't I don't remember
someone's flashing their head and height
names
I don't remember if that's a function
you can turn it off
and turn it on okay
my luckily there's actually lights on
this track
but you can see it
no
I really
hey pack
Racing for impact
oh
I got a comment I will let audition
support but I will try to read the track
read the comments
and my highlights broke sorry
I have to try without a lifestyle
have fun luckily it's more like and not
too dark
so it's still possible to see
if you like very late it's not like
middle of night
pressing there are tracks that are very
dark
can I activate that while driving
did it change the outfit let me know
because I can't see
yeah I really wish I had two screens
now I will get the uh
[Music]
good podcast I
think it's like it
okay let me let me
catch up in the comments because I got a
lot of cards out of seven
and it didn't change outfit okay that's
good to know
and let's see
so what other cars are in the game
a few I guess you can stay in the watch
I don't remember
this game has a lot of cars my personal
faves BMW E39 M5 that's a that's quite
nice
in Germany ah yes we have I'm just
experience call the game burning asphalt
call it
I mean at least the game title is in
German
uh hello
Sovereign
I saw that you followed a while ago
thank you for the follow
ing you're still here
and Company and glad I could catch one
of his streams I'm glad that you are
here and watching and hopefully enjoying
Hong Kong
I don't think you have headlights
anymore no
wait is this the same race track as
before but with more labs and during the
night and with more difficult uh
computers
yes M Vector there is a
like this
and there are more tracks but they come
it's actually
maybe this tournament has one of the new
tracks
because the second circuit introduced
well I guess the first circuit
introduced arm tracks
the second
packet introduced to Durham Road
then this
packet I think
because so far it's only been four
different tracks
think there was five tracks on this
I could be wrong
that's your best lap lap three no thank
you this important boys
[Music]
well
call this upside down
[Music]
I get pummeled by everyone
I mean
yeah probably our lights on the car is
broken so no one sees me okay it's not
that hard to see it the Moon is up so
they have a lot of moonlight
the device is very large yeah that was a
mistake
let's see if I can catch up I'm in the
first position this uh I do like that
the game has a full playlist
starter too often games have
that is quite Compact and actually
and it also shows the distance between
cars it's in seconds but
and for those curious about how seconds
works
in the in this game they don't do it but
I'm pretty sure they sell to it but in
real life you would basically
when the first car passes by I check my
to start a clock and then you check how
long it takes for every other car to
cross that checkpoint and that's the
distance you have to the next car in
seconds or
yeah as you only check the differences
then you have another checkpoints across
the track and that's how you get
I think numbers however I'm pretty sure
none of the games actually does this and
they instead measure the distance
between the cars
and then consider the speed of the cars
or something
to determine the time in seconds
because
oh no it's dark
yeah
but maybe this game doesn't do that
actually maybe the numbers are correct
it's easy to test
yeah
because for example if you if you are to
place driving with the distance between
each other and then you stop both cars
at the time between your car should
either stand still or increase
that doesn't matter but then if you
start moving forward with your car the
time should actually increase not
decrease because
it took you very long time to reach the
next checkpoint
foreign
but I'm pretty sure that timer will
decrease
[Music]
and proving that it is not based on time
it's actually based on distance
converted to your time
[Music]
and the same is if another proof
actually is also if you have
don't think you need from me I'm
I'm really valid
[Music]
yeah I think I lost this Trace
well anyway
[Music]
yeah another proof is that if you are
five seconds ahead of someone and then
you
fresh like run into one and stand still
it should take five a five seconds
before the
crashed towards the cup
I really wish crashed him right in the
field had a piece of I really wish they
do that maybe yeah let's just says
yeah
kenyak Park is a new track
yeah I have to repair this car I
completely
messed it up
it shouldn't really the matter how much
I broke in the car because if you go you
probably have to replace the whole panel
and that the cost regardless how my
structure panel is
foreign
so now it's the
French Trails backwards
[Music]
I do like okay
I do like when racing games do have
tracks backwards because
it's an easy way to add another track
and driving a track backwards is
actually different
I do approach the corners in a different
way
it's not that completely new track but
it does still add more confidence
it's better to have it than not have it
at least that's what I'm trying to say
[Music]
[Music]
fine bye hello kitten welcome back
we got some good food
[Music]
don't don't look at me running into the
mountain wall
yep it fits that's good huh
that was smooth and then now then
pound
Pacific
and the computer players we are named
sometimes
ir8
and I think that name is supposed to be
Diamond Eights
within the calculator
what does
dkm
1966 stands for
example
[Music]
attacking at the moment
that's fine
so what do you get to eat
yeah tell us
and what does the kitten eat
your eyes
[Music]
many of the suspensions
are breaking
this passes the car goes
I mean it's a b-class cars I guess it
doesn't have much of speed
oh I rate
it that's what it stands for
so what does
what does
dkm966
maybe it's a developer or something
and it's that person's initials
just like how my name in that case would
be e
and the rest of the secret anyway that
was a bad joke
for breakfast
that's all we have here in the town that
I mean I mean you could always make
something at home that's what I did
with the four kilometer deep out
okay
but
other major cities an hour away
about an hour and that's it sounds like
a kid
time to drive and eat breakfast
I haven't been there any just
I usually cook my own stuff yeah there
you go
became obviously Donkey Kong mastering
and Donkey Kong came out in 1966 as a
man
I usually cook but I'm super hungry
okay
that's that's why you super cooked of
course
it's just me is it can extra long enough
or it's playable but
it's not too strange the game
it's like really old game should be
designed
but nothing else running
just sometimes
still sad laps I do still have one molar
this
rather
easy to control even though it is laggy
so it's a
the world making
it runs pretty good on a Windows 10
completely
exactly nice
now I have nothing else running so
I'm not sure what that second is ah
[Music]
why is my phone so quiet hey whatever
why is everyone trying trust me why are
everyone in a path what is going on
I'm thinking
I'm trying to clean
[Music]
I think
streaming clients
is taking up that much performance
don't see any warning messages soon
that's when it was very approaching
[Music]
the first position is mine
Melissa grape
now it's it's the scream
we sure hunk a lot I guess this is
France
I don't know if that's the singing class
replaced first whoa
a place first no card and also after
passing the Finish Line your car
no longer takes damage I do wish this
was sorted after two that's great
[Music]
okay take the comments
crashing pump yeah I crashed a lot there
do I need to like
maybe I can
but how
wait Give me a
H here we go
because I do have this off now that's
not something there we go I need for
speed
I put it to have higher
eh
priority on the processor
maybe that will leave it
yeah this suspension is pretty broken
that's the purpose
I wasted so much money
playing the car
now I want to read
okay now here's yes that kid at Donkey
Kong that he mastered the game before it
came out
oh or he's a master born in 1966 meaning
that he was
we came out in 1980 it's like 14 years
old
mastering it
because when this game came out already
bump on looks like you're striking a bit
yeah yeah I was throwing a lot of that
face
fun for his help look like I it looks
like the I-80
I don't know what
that is
sorry we just noticed you're having a
hard time we didn't mean to change you
ah you made it price there we go that's
your fault
I ate it gets real crazy sometimes
you can do it pump on yeah they were
honking a lot in that face Maybe This
Time friends you can't
yeah when I get to the next
up
okay
[Music]
what's that
and Sweden is a sovereign state does
that mean that every
[Music]
Sweden is a sovereign state so is every
other sovereign state in Europe yes they
are
and several of these days are member
states of the European Union
and then there is a European World
network with Bean roads
and because those goes between
and different countries that pass in
different states that means that those
roads are interstate
[Music]
yeah
[Music]
now it is England
that's a specific thing for this track
probably in Durham is database called
that in England
but it's just a Durham Road so
Easter Road in it's a place or a road in
England called Durham in some way
like there was extra place in England
with that
name in C3 which I never lived at to see
if it looks like the real life this so
it might look very different now
the game is right around
yep
okay
yes that's a confirmation
so now it says
yeah we don't try to sleep
[Music]
[Music]
oh
actually this track
is much easier than I thought the rows
are quite wide here yep here there is a
Durham England
oh nice also there I'm North Carolina
well this is England not North Carolina
so
I'm sorry but
hmm nice
I just did that
I
must start okay
[Music]
that's cool yeah I want to have
similarities
maybe it's based on the real place or if
it's just the generic
time
you don't know that the game is a
specific thing that's it
I do know that because the game has
specified this being England okay
that's the thing
it doesn't say on the learning screen
but
um
well let me see if I can bring it up for
the next
track which is
probably active part which I think is
Canada
and I'm gonna see as you see if I can
see if this has the country
and then I can confirm the other tracks
as well why not
foreign
[Music]
and
that's really fresh
so good
that was in France
sometimes it likes a lot in sometimes
it feels like it's lagging more as the
track goes on
before
you break that
[Music]
car sound we do that
this isn't going great I'm only in
fourth position
the sign says 15 now we're trying to
destroy time
certainly they don't mean 50 miles per
hour through a town
it is a Canadian developer
is it possible that the the developer
thoughts that England used kilometers
for roads
I mean they should but
it's fresh
[Music]
okay I see you right now I will
on how many rows signs do you have taken
down can you count it for me
I haven't kept track what a few
luckily you only have to prepare for
damages on your own car you don't have
to pay for damages on the track that
would be something
around
yet
no not all of them
this is an insult
to my driving skills
I'm not that bad
I'm just taking down even more stuff
besides
from Vice test some fun design dinner
there's signs that I'm a kitten Canada
uses let me just yet I do know that
I hope I didn't say anything else
and I drove terribly
yeah
but England doesn't
okay
yeah I'm not going to win this
tournament
okay now it's uh kenyak Park so if you
press here
it's just Canada
the lyrics AC
and you can also see rules which are
kind of hard to see but there's four
laps forward
it's not mirrored which doesn't but
it's not night and enough weather so
let's
and also
if she can do
records
and I really don't have it
when one has some records
no they don't have that option here
I went
okay your two will come from
I'm failing this track
railing this
tournament
it's already quite a challenge my lead
and then my midst up and then I lose
ask the cars are damaged all the cars
are damaged yeah
so much conditions
let's know in Canada now you can see the
uh
yellow middle line
you'll also see that the road signs
have changed to the North American side
[Music]
but the distance is given in kilometers
because that's what can
foreign
does have a kind of an orange
hint to it
that's that's why you know it's in North
America
okay in next race our country many signs
you are thinking about yeah
it's
sausage
that'll be good start with the kids
try to read them in this traits
Canada but where everything moves and
the key
especially the keys
there's a lot of warning for dinners
however yeah
yeah I heard about the Canadian geese
being quite agree with it but luckily
there are no animals
okay
[Music]
I guess that would also be
okay that that was a bad idea
fun I guess driving and then you have to
watch out for a large bag walking across
the street or something where I'm loose
[Music]
because flashing lights but then you'll
never check train across that road
[Music]
turn on the lights only for the race
[Music]
since that's the starting line
Finish Line
[Music]
up
kenyak park is there a kindyak park in
real life
does it look like this
yeah you're not supposed
across the track by the nights are
flashing same on you go turn yourself in
it's a close track there's no traffic
there's a sign down I'm not sure if I
keep down especially the one we have
deer and raccoons
watch out from here
[Music]
on the Chain bunny
Jane
I'm in a car
now we need this race even our last time
some of others I'm not going to win the
tournament anyway for this circuit as
they call it
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
that's your best lap lap three
oh thank you it was pretty good luck I
think so even though the game runs like
15 frames per second that's
I guess that's the
easier thing but sometimes it's very
dismissed I actually don't know how many
French second is supposed to run it I
would get 60.
if that's something for this expansion
there's a train here
but luckily it doesn't cross you don't
have to go over the tracks
thanks parents
I entered that corner a bit too fast
but I did manage to get shoot through
the trees but uh yeah quality it wasn't
good
and then this whole left and not left he
goes through
yep that's two signs you know in like
one second
trees
oh my you don't mind me trying taking
down signs but
that's just something that accidentally
happened for science
it shouldn't be in my way
they are way too close to the side of
the road for their own safety you should
stand
several meters away the family behind
the barrier
yep let's get the suspension
foreign
placement
[Music]
keep that respected coin
[Music]
[Music]
I even move the signs thank you
this is at the track this is the
railroad
[Music]
yeah of course I
messed up Final in the final corners
yeah but that was in first and then I
lost lost it
congratulations you have successfully
completed this circuit you have been
awarded the bronze medal
well I guess that's not too bad
he's not a gun but
at least top three top three no not
three top three is at least
okay let's move on to next time this is
a
knockout style tournament
let's repair the car ten thousand yeah
something fresh car
S 2 signing these three only two I must
be more than two
really only two
next phrase
which is in Germany
let's enter this tournament so this is a
knockout meaning that the person who
comes the last in the race will be is
not allowed to enter the next race
so all you have to focus on is just not
going to last and and the other position
doesn't matter
that's what I counted two sides okay
what and
two people counting that's good
wasn't it too science I took down within
one second
[Music]
no I wouldn't crash
okay
not if it happens when it
had fun yeah I hope you have enough
fingers on your hands
[Music]
okay just because of that
how's that complete
see you in one second
I should follow these cars
we let the bonbon take with me and
I don't know some Chinese persons
thought that I would be a good driver
we did
ah oh yeah oh no my windows 30.
10 hour at 5am
and welcome
[Music]
rate my driving
can I be your
taxi driver
I've done the two laps right I'm
probably gonna need to
I would take something
I only need to ever take one
no the engine took damage
no
[Music]
it wasn't very very slight pump inside
the trip
changed suddenly
cruising along the
wet surface
try to stop her but the bun is too fast
yeah I'm I'm moving fast only six yeah
yeah it's only six drivers because
otherwise it would be a very long
tournament
it doesn't matter how far I had the
leader is yes next phrase will always
start to close together enemies
it's a second place pretty good I can
keep these
so far I've been driving into the World
Series
I bumped the one car if you want to kill
that it's I think I've taken down zero
signs
wait what's going on
thank you Joseph
describing
I don't know how this crime scene works
first I know it counts like a tier one
subscriptions
but it's different sometimes
I'm still
need like a month ago you know me
transferring his surprise for some
reason I guess the Internet isn't super
stable but I hope the stream is smooth
maybe the quantity drops
of course I'm not sure how the painting
work exactly I just said that
well thank you
[Music]
yeah we have most often have subscribed
just with tier one but
with prime you get a nice crown
and wrestling
yeah this was a easy
congratulations you
've been colliding off the finish line
does not count
so that means that Pico has been
eliminated
three
two okay so now we go to Dolphin Co we
should not be a new track and this one
is located in USA
I'm not sure what if it's the lowercase
we crash a car at one point wait did I
the camp the time I bumped down the car
or did I actually collide with a wall
because
I didn't maybe attach them or something
Neuroscience should I have like a sign
called at this point
and scientific yeah I don't have to be
here placing the sides
with Florida yeah they have specified
like if it's England or Scotland but
they have not specified where in the
United States Academy
it's raining
and I'm doing
this stretch I really have it for the
table
yeah this is what I care I should try
so I say as I'm starting please control
okay that was a crash
and that was a sign
and I didn't think that that sign at
least
or that sign
yeah nothing complete the technology
because I don't get the blame at that
point
[Music]
it doesn't look like Florida
well it's the uh Western parks
[Music]
maybe New England area
that was two more seconds
[Music]
[Music]
is in California
you found the place called that
but where was Kenya Park located maybe
his enemies
I've never been there
in Florida or dolphin covers
[Music]
yeah where's alarm
engineer's name
like Land Street or something
healthy Queens that's
activities of something Celtic
sounds like a fantasy place
[Music]
I know
is this a real trolls
and I
fetch that I guess
to relax
[Music]
because that that makes a huge
difference
even even pumping and more money
primaries
first place and now on the third place
that's that's what happened when I tried
everything that's good
[Music]
foreign
fell down
it was
coming I almost attacked from there
that wasn't my fault
oh you're happy to talk or or California
what are you talking about
this looks like the mountains
in the side had to go
[Music]
[Music]
that sign was bad
great left you placed second
thank you
this looks like mountains which I drove
through a snowstorm
tortoise has been eliminated
and my car is so broken at the moment
at least I got my mirrors
Pawn Crest 10 times
oh
that's
that's bad isn't it
like the Celtic Rings back to I forgot
to check but this
[Music]
is
one go
okay second position four races left
hmm
two two three two races has been
completed so
two races has been a really service has
been eliminated from the two previous
races
I love that kid and speaking
I don't think I took that sign down
I think that was the entertainment
I don't count signs these times oh
just counting the crashes
how we return are you going Kitty I will
I will hear from you next time
but I guess you'll you'll say money back
I wasn't counting anything last time oh
yeah how many signs last night
you can count them down with Tree Side
bump into a place here not keeping in
first position now
I'm broken car isn't it
erratic
yeah the dryness on these lines
[Music]
the game draws
another game on Smith
it's just that
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
okay let's see
not much left
right in here
I think it's really easy now
when I have quietly
so
girls a bit sometimes
first
print lap
thank you
so how many signs Mac and you have been
eliminated
in that case okay let's continue then
IAC Park and then we have snow Ridge we
saw another new track kiniak Park was
Canada
so where was kiniak Park located
on takedown no signs yeah that's how it
should be
three races left
troll
what one person who's trolling one
person with irate and then this sweet
sleepy pumpkin
will stay on the road please
as I touch the grass a bit there that
doesn't count I mean why don't we can go
outside okay
well maybe two
yeah at least one wheel has sailors
[Music]
I don't know yeah I know it's Canada but
so now you don't want to take home
science
you don't want to take down the only
insurance place I did
kind of but where in Canada okay can you
look out for the map or something
[Music]
it's still a job pickup locations
and very carefully that the other
drivers are checking out
[Music]
that was
try a bit more
aggressive
you can't take the lead again
that's uh almost losing it
[Music]
okay
you didn't say it wasn't great yet
I guess it wasn't fast enough or
something
I didn't touch anything I was on the
road and then it collided anything I
didn't take it out and then any signs as
far as I know
after you take damage
[Music]
it is actually complete
[Music]
I guess my computer is
refrigerated
streaming
I hope it works
and that's very laggy or anything
[Music]
else
yeah catching African we've got this
corner
nope I'm getting quite used to this car
but
this will be the last
race with this car
and then I have to buy a new one for the
next
next series
[Music]
great lap congratulations you placed
first
there we go great lap so that wasn't now
the troll has been eliminated we no
longer hear trucks here
and finally snow reach
which is
in United States
and just because it's now it doesn't
mean it's in Canada
one didn't care that all this race see I
did it well
why you drive good now because you can't
think
no if you're only too racist you
actually starts in the race side by side
which are these things should happen
when you re-races
not track it
three like Elaine playing
but I didn't take that consideration
it's a snowy mountains
this outcome many sex from girls up
yeah
okay
you have like only off the road like a
wheel of something
like that is that yeah
Okay so
this Spider-Man is cute
service this discount is roads I mean it
just do that effect but
there's a lot like the road
okay so now we reach take this
but this doesn't look like Texas but
you don't have pine trees in Texas
well
so it must be Wisconsin Wisconsin
[Music]
it's quite a long track actually
is that campus up first
that's partly of him
[Music]
left
[Music]
[Music]
but I think it looks like Colorado
[Music]
I didn't find a Snow Ridge Colorado
[Music]
a place that is always snowing United
States
[Music]
and that other driver is
you know it's close behind
he said don't have an Indian damage
oh
the step count is sides
and how many was that
[Music]
was an accident
[Music]
how many cramps
[Music]
oh no it started snowing no
I'm slow
I don't like it snow
ing what
now I'm driving a lot of food
in mind that
that's your best lap you've won the race
that doesn't count this afternoon
and irate has been eliminated that means
that kind of funny stuff
you've won The Knockout you have been
awarded the gold medal
fun fun is a real knockout I think
that's a expression of something hey
my alarms are not signs no worries oh
okay okay but I think I took one side
your side big mirror is gone it's it's
actually it's oh no
I'm probably Offroad for eight
seconds and 57 seconds to the next
circuit right there accuracy using it
okay
here's the thing
this
and this requires to risk your car with
a rabbit car
um
but you
but you can't like risk your own the car
so the next circuits not the next packet
the next door I'm Gonna Change tour can
I get to the tourist trivia
okay I can see it should be a
with a new car
so
they're not loose pun
yeah
we actually got
okay five course years
and there
because it was fun
I should do it again
although you know the top one that's
that's a bonus that doesn't count
I think that was sick
I should change that
and another can I have what all the cars
that's the next question
no I can't think of foreign cars so it
doesn't matter you can only afford a
project firebird and
The
Graduate camera
all right
yeah okay
and then
so I don't sound a little too high
money to afford
sadly
there you go now we can vote while I
prepare to hydrate
I don't know
that's basically the upstairs
yeah that's Class A which I will
purchased for the next tour
and then I can do risk the my b-class
card for that final race
oh project fiber that car is great for
making beer
runs from Texas
sort of like a made-up please take that
can
if all it was to change same
yeah there's not too many cars in this
game
I should I should maybe play uh for some
hotspot because that I had I think that
car had a car I think that game has
700 cars or something myself the one I
have
I'm back now okay and you can vote which
car I should buy next to proceed the
carrier with
some viewer interaction that's basically
commenting and voting
that's your
similarly they have the same
acceleration
the Camaro has slightly higher top speed
but not much
and
maybe between that out of the way
they have the same handling the fiber
has better braking but it does rate the
cameras slightly higher because it
considers how sweet better than breaking
yeah there we go that's the hydrate
and also you got like a bonus
a half hour for that outfit
old cars well yeah you got the chase it
got like a minute left or something
that makes sense actually that's because
I came up with you of course I need to
put
and then whatever
well uh it says six watches and six
votes so I guess they both goes to the
Firebird
all right
people are very quick to vote
[Music]
machines
which color is it I make it Pink again
maybe you should be like yeah
like a more like more like that maybe
I had a favorite oh and see
oh I didn't say when I did that
be like
something like that
when they the graphics in the game isn't
a bit I think
well that's basically almost all the
money but let's do it
and that was the Fanfare for purchasing
the car
so switching back to the beat because
that's the one I can use
should I empty the race with this
rocking car or should I repair it to
increase by odds of winning
it's only four thousand so I will
increase my odds of winning
enter the race with a broken car
[Music]
the firewall was blue in 1985 and the
camera was red behind me to see
entry fee
zero more like your own car
someone watches welcome everyone
also the set 6 Watcher and six votes but
I voted I don't think I count as a watch
here so advice I believe one person who
didn't vote
that's fine you don't have to build if
you don't want to
three two three
it's important to me because I only got
one chance messages
[Music]
[Music]
okay whoosh he says that's what it says
when I drive from you whoosh
hey don't scratch my car or my car
catching both my cars
hey you you're ruining my car by driving
down the signs
and then this car has zero damages so I
guess they're comfortable in the account
of light
that's that's really on cars
okay I need to concentrate on these
things otherwise
you cannot lose this race
boys
because I only got one chance I mean
otherwise I have to
race with the other car in the other
races
earn money buy a new b-class car and
then try this again
I only have two seconds
very highly training
[Music]
this a bit after I win this race
I will have two big
Class Cars
I want you to have things why
I guess if the other car is better than
this car
[Music]
with my team
I could use the other car for the
bronze tour what's that thing I can do
next week for them
in progress with the game first before I
feel forgot
[Music]
I don't know if you get a silver medal
for losing this face
suddenly we will get a Goldman for
winning
since there's only two drivers you
should kind of somewhere
I mean nobody can speak
it is it is actually possible if if the
second place gets a Sentimental then you
must get at least a bronze medal to
perceive it is possible that they made
it so that regardless if you really
received the class car you can't proceed
the game
logically speaking as that's actually
quite quite a cabin design
first if I don't win I see the medal in
that in that case that would just be
annoying
unbelievable one won the race
[Music]
nothing is possible
because I know you brought more than one
drinks but it's already not yet true
and let me first finish finish the
crossing line
I'm on the race and she didn't get a
crash or hit anything at all yeah
you have won this car okay
congratulations
you have won this
congratulations you have successfully
completed this tier you have been
awarded the bronze trophy you're ready
to challenge the next tier
oh heck
here I drive
really well
and then you call me out for hexing
very well done thank you sovereign
good
let's move on
two track tournaments retirement let's
just kill it in the water
so this should be uh oh it's open
actually
now I have much like SIM card
this one should be
what
I will use my new car
tonight yeah
joke nice working fancy yes yeah I
thought you went to
serious about that
when one thousand entropies yeah I could
pay that
I don't know
wrote that is perfect I mean I don't
know which it was a rotor or Rota
um
generally
[Music]
spanish-ish
[Music]
this
is spelled slightly different but it is
red
[Music]
a sign
everyone is starring outside right
wait
take all day
points left leg and a half minutes
like eight minutes or something
I mean that's the plan because
Patty
there's some people spending your time
thanks for like a Spider-Man and from
like 10 minutes
[Music]
[Music]
I managed to keep ahead of that time
got plenty of laps
left left
[Music]
the jump
[Music]
well if you're curious this Swedish word
is spelled with two T's
and instead of an o
is the Swedish or which is an a with a
circle
way to
time
I think he just moved to the side
[Music]
before position
that's true that's true
did I take down that sign up
to back your position
[Music]
okay very very pricing who is this irate
yeah this part this time must be ready
or something
[Music]
of it that would take you in the grass
[Music]
yeah I think the star from the trash
I had no idea
sense are you like a rat or something
like your persona or I hate lab
it's a bit much no I mean it's only two
tracks in this sort of tournament the
thick with the four tracks which foreign
[Music]
but haven't you spent like 16 minutes on
a track track
[Music]
yep that happens
great
laugh yeah it's picking up trash in the
pound my mouth oh you're a mouse okay
[Music]
wait I think for some reason I want to
remember
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
so it used to be very irony yes
[Music]
yeah
and also also the Swedish word for eight
is OCTA and therefore if you put orange
from in front of Base it becomes
which is Swedish rat which I just said
before
and so if you read that name that would
be Rosa which means means inside breath
it is more fun than I make
and since the names are the same regards
of this language you're playing the game
and so you can see played in Swedish his
name is basically inside Sprat
I see ya oh no wait I was that a crash
that's it behind her yeah it was
something temporary fine there's nothing
to worry about
I wonder if it was one of them
that's crazy which is fine so
it's a legendary
I did it I bumped the tree but I got
great laugh it wasn't great
tricky to play at like 15 seconds
to oh no they're confirming that the
crash happened
no crash happened it was nothing to see
don't look at the dam damaged numbers
that's just an illusion
[Music]
[Applause]
done for the back oh yes yes one of
those
bleeding fires they come and go as they
please
fire it will go out
I mean do you finally started because of
the crash that didn't happen and then it
disappeared when they when the car was
done
yeah
if I
think that the
I mean if your car gets damaged enough
I'm not sure if they will be fine
maybe that's just a question it's very
terrible crashes
sorry I meant you're making me irate
I can still have today so far as soon as
the first Finish Line
a half minutes so come comment that you
just say something
thank you that sounds like an awesome
very terribly that's your best laugh oh
okay
[Music]
oh yeah yes that must be love on link if
that was
completely mean no one's using the
blinkers in this race
on this close stretch
come anyway
why do you get irate
maybe so I rate it I pushed into the
wall
beep beep
beep
yeah
sometimes the signs just have to go they
should have picked put them down taking
them down the top side taking down the
signs before the rain started I'm pretty
sure this at least I've seen
sweet I've ever love everyone does it
it's basically a metal pole inserted in
that large
concrete
and then
what's the word I was looking for and
then that's the down into the ground
and I assume the end of that
bone has something to occur into the
seventh what is this so it's not pushed
down easy maybe this started success
I will move the Sizer far away from here
we were supposed to do that why we
didn't what didn't you do
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
dust cloud
anyway
yep no one has written something new to
me
well The Irate has taken second place
this isn't good
hello
[Music]
lap seven
[Music]
this isn't good we should not award such
an aggressive and high rate driver the
first position that he probably feels
really good at night
[Music]
he must do something
[Music]
there you go
I've been no longer in the first
position
the tortoise really stands out in there
the driver list
near me
they should probably have considered the
the Arceus colors like Tron maybe it's a
lighter shade
thank you
guys now
um
pay attention to this
10 frames per second
okay
best left it's the final lap
upstairs
let's see if I can
win this as well
yeah how many signs can you see
nothing oh there's a signal here too
I guess that sound exactly a bit further
in or out that is and also close
theater
for once
basically I will move them to the next
planet
and on Mars and it's not it's not a
distance I'm bothered about
is that you didn't move them all that
that's
terrible faces I think that's what
they're loose right
hello faces
[Music]
and here's a lot of slice
okay listen to the small town
foreign
congratulations you placed first
I didn't eat
I wanna race
[Music]
look at this car
look at this Firebirds
bumped from inside and at least the rear
lights brake lights Daylights are
working
that doesn't look good
so much better
now
for the second and final race when it's
thing
and it's I haven't been sleeping for two
and a half hours so
it won't be I think I shouldn't be able
to live another race two one go
but let's start with this race
don't be sad
thank you
[Music]
that's everything second place
first in second place please
I need to try to kill these tricks no
damages
I took that
wasn't good
[Music]
thank you
and be careful in this section
it's a tight section
letting the car do that yeah exactly
slow down before the jumps
foreign
[Music]
nothing else
it would be very different from the
previous race
[Music]
and you know what I said
Corner then
yeah
here's some horse ambiences
That Donkey Kong master is quite falling
behind quite a lot
horse ambience
[Music]
I rate this morning behind nice
oh it is good because
[Music]
don't know the points currently but I
should be able to come in second place
and still win the tournament as long as
it isn't High rate being infected
although in that case we can we will
come in
complete first place whatever that's
share the first place
and in that case boss should be a lot of
a girl
that's what works
[Music]
yeah this inspection is taking
quite the damage in this branch
that's the sound of your car's
horsepower oh
this car doesn't have horsepower
okay and how about that cheap
what what kind of
what does that represent
that didn't happen
[Music]
and she represents
the amazing
he represents speed
yeah
yeah what they said what
okay that was a crow
yes
every lab has a different element
[Music]
the colors are the parts magpie
eat instead of it
[Music]
if I want why is the ones quite
something happening to your voice
One Crown crown
[Music]
equals an attempted murder okay
okay
I was growing in
background
can I lived by yourself ran right into
the
area
divided
yeah this idea about
keeping the time keep
damages here
even ignoring the suspension that didn't
really
work out
fun fun is going too fast but I must
stay in the first place if I'm going
slower then other drives will catch up
and it goes so fast at the frame rate
[Music]
that was a pink but that's
and that was uh
chicken
s
it was a cup
but the species is called chicken so I
think that's
fine to say as well
a rooster
oh that's the attack
ing all the time for everything
but it's still a chicken right because
that's a species name
uh
what are you laughing at
yes yes
yeah a rooster is maybe some other
attributes
instead of taking a difference between a
[ __ ] and everything
thanks
he's a peacock not a tea rooster as far
as I am
yeah yeah that's the Swedish term for
the species
I think it's the same
Yeah because sometimes there are
technical differences
this is passovers therefore it's just
easy to say
chicken May chicken image chicken
baby chicken
yeah I'm not sure
it's apparently this computer should be
able to run this game without these
units and lots
scratching the paint
crook infused are the same okay
now
[Music]
and more damage to suspension
and that's the sound of electricity
final cancer
yep that was their friends
because I
that song is by the Swedish band Europe
one second
with that funkyo Master is falling by
not so good
I wasn't paying attention to anything
else I'm driving myself
[Music]
yeah I haven't
congratulations you placed first oh
thank you
peacock is male and pee hen is female
that is great and the P found you have
six
species
you have been awarded 165 000 Swedish
Crowns can't they say that that
doesn't want to read every number
give me the money
things
move on to the next circuit
class
why
not
[Music]
two laps
this is better let's go this class A
repair card
yes
repair on
the car is nice the headlines are
working
let's go let's go
I love that song All The Final Countdown
it's a green song
money money for pumpkin money
I don't remember last time release
with that song
is by the Swiss pants
and now I didn't this black mirrors
and they have for some reason managed to
mirror
the whole world
they have reconstructed the whole world
someone crashed into a tree so I had
crashed into the car
still has lots of things
oh well that happened
speaking of that song and also be sure
to find to be a neat thing even though
the track is mirrored
there's the German flag
the warning signs that tells you which
uh the warning about the right Corners
they are still correct but I mean
they're actually correct because they
although some signs are mirrored that's
why they are correct
but the speed limit signs and that
heightening sign are also still correct
because
they have been
mirror tickets
okay
what I wanted to say but distracted by
the signs but I like your attention to
these things
one
idea I had
was that I would play I do have rock
bands really specifically and with a lot
of songs however I mean
license
not made for the game foreign
so my idea
so
PC what game is next
[Music]
no problem what the game is next you
have this schedule but
because but yeah yeah I try to keep the
schedule up to date and the best thing I
do is on Twitch but I do have on the
server but why
[Music]
so I try to keep same game
so I do two streams in Paris with the
same game
only Tuesday will be this game
and this moment
and then I will continue this game with
everyone in 2017 tonight especially if I
give up basically I think people are
tired of it
before I completed
and then Wednesday is a break it's
Thursday Thursday
and Friday will be
I will try to play Legend of Spyro
and breaking the car
and then finally Saturday Sunday will be
a dog a dog's life
Arsenal in Swedish as it would live
a dog life
congratulations
Place third that wasn't good
but it was an arcade as far as I know so
tornado is gone
so what do you think of the tax plan
exact times will of course determine be
determined by your time zone
a birth according to you deceive you
know you're offset Monday Tuesday is 14
o'clock uh
Thursday Friday
it is 18 o'clock and finally Saturday
Sunday would be 12 o'clock
I think I got that right
is that correct
that's it obviously don't forget to
check the schedule to make sure you have
nice
on this card or and on which it will be
given in your time set assuming you have
set your computer to correct myself
and that that part is on me
ow meow yeah that's Polish
[Music]
something like that
is that the official title for the game
in Polish
foreign
[Music]
anything
because there is a Swedish cover and a
finished cover
okay I finished covered I don't remember
what it is
more than that stock inside
if someone were to say the word
would probably guess if it's not enough
[Music]
here's an interesting fact
and
fresh Bandicoot four it's about time has
two official translations one in
Japanese
and one in Polish
and they actually made a Japanese and
polish logo but as far as I know
if you change this game and then you
shop the game the logo in the game
doesn't change which I do think is a
shame
but this game is strengthening polish so
that's the same
thing
crash crash game translated polish
ah I'm just in control of the card
[Music]
maybe I should make sure this thing
how many signs now
is an interesting game
yeah it is someone wanted me to play it
and it is a platformer
it's like a platforming collector song
I don't know I don't know where I was
passed by the game but I do find one
thing interesting in the game is it's
like how they try to animate the dog
walking like a dog
[Music]
and there's nothing
I do it would be so nice if they could
just release
an updated version of the cake
mix up Adam
and they do have high quality modeling
which they use in marketing
so
all they should do is replace all the
balance with the high quality models and
just release that as the
a bit better
that's that that's what they could call
it bugs life a bit better
[Music]
troll has been eliminated and get rid of
that troll yes I said I should probably
repair this steering
and and then
how much money am I spending I want to
see how much money I've spent on this
current so when I went 300 000 I had
spent more money repairing the car
that is life I had fun with that game
when I was a child but now you don't
have fun with the game
we're back in the United States
and of course there's a donut okay
you can't look a bit to the side they
have to pull it to the side
[Music]
I don't have the game anymore oh
it is a weird game
um
worth having yes for this Wednesday
when you were a kid you had one oh my
voice is disappearing but as an adult
you don't have any
problems in second and he pushed him
into a wall and then he found the last
place well that's that's what you get
getting close to the Pom-Pom
he takes no excuse me
later I don't even remember
[Music]
[Music]
I think come and push me around
Maybe
so maybe I see I didn't take out that
sign maybe I didn't push troll into a
wall maybe Trump came and pushed me and
I pushed back and he drove in trouble
but I can't wait too much to play dog's
life yeah yeah I know I know you're
excited for it
so that would be fun
and I would be able to concentrate and
chat more
okay that's kind of in front of me doing
racing games but I guess trying to read
the shot while driving
that's life you can stand still
but I like racing games I guess there's
that issue that's
naked I was a cool kid
my hair was long and black
sisters
I would skateboard in town
yeah you're the cute little kid with
your skateboard and your long hair
and that's key points I think
that I barely used it so and then I
don't know where it went
keyboarding was inviting I wasn't really
I wasn't really good at it I'm gonna
work and when I wasn't really
comfortable standing on a skateboard
I think that's a good way to phrase it
therefore I didn't really try it
the tips of my hair was pink
and different colors
reading text when I'm trying
this is it which
pink and different colors when my
scissors start for changing
that they were pink and then they were
different colors from here is the shade
like this
if I got it right there
I had a skateboard no knew how to write
about it
[Music]
I could make it go and that's an easy
part
and make it turn
light the chicken and
[Music]
to make it stop
yeah another problem is that you don't
stop
so
I think I would be able to
okay let's fix this suspension this time
I think I should be able to finish this
knockout
I don't like how this dream goes red
still
I would
is the game really taking that much
performance around it's such an own
thing it's not been optimized go
it's easy but I stopped it is
[Music]
that's no fun
never skateboard again did you enjoy
your food due to skateboarding why was
it unrelated
oh there goes my headlights
this is this track isn't better I want
to remember the track to be much dark in
this I do remember kinyak park being
really dark
yeah but that's should we try that
strike take place in the forest
I mean last place this isn't good well
if I don't win this tournament
I'll definitely be finished before
the hour mark
since the girl was a three-hour stream
from
one hour to full hour
no hey nice yeah
should be prepared about this you had
your headlights but I had the headlights
I broke them early in the race
they probably installed new lamps at the
start of the race
but then I'm broken immediately
yeah we don't need to care about that
fun place
for some like expected down there
that's a I I only have to care about
getting ahead of making games so I can
get them in final race
and I didn't check which track it is
what is like Maniac art or like I don't
think so
because Durham Road is not my favorite
we go to England
[Music]
Generations
because I have physically existed inside
and
one two three four five six countries
and I'm using that very technical term
because I mean I kind of not
some sense it's not really visited the
country like
exploding country
but I have physically been inside six
countries so that's something
I have only been inside I never left
[Music]
me that's your best laugh you placed
second that's my favorite history
in that case you didn't let it started
race
foreign
yep
I do want to visit more countries
like
yeah we don't need that monkey
this is also track which is three lanes
three two one go that is not easy
feelings anyway
comment
[Music]
not actually concentrate on getting
heavy this is nothing right
it's an apology no condition
please
okay so far so good
I'm not getting ahead
I forgot about that
and this was that side
that's one sign
pass damage to the body and engine
enemy
as long as I'm ahead of that thing
mommy starts stretch music
[Music]
good time
yeah I think the game has problem with
having multiple cars because currently
it's just one opponent
and the game is running quite smooth
but when there's a lot of opponents
that's when it starts lagging
this is a shame
I'm going to reduce the graphical
quality on the card
having to reduce the graphical quality
of a game before 2000. I think it's
pretty 48000.
pass this Windows 10 computer on it
probably
[Music]
it's nice sometimes
these available places are one and
that would run better so
Atlanta is very cleanse
okay
now let's turn up the track onto the
train tracks train station that went no
it was kind of side because the error
was snowing
and that's the point you've got a
different translations
and
that's your best lap you've won the race
the car
that has been eliminated
you've won the knockout
been awarded
[Music]
the game went quiet
move on to the next circuit
that's too cold
and then I guess for like complete I
could improve that one yeah
to the gold as well
that is a three-hour stream if my
my calculations are correct
thank you all for coming by
and
now
any comments
foreign
I'm not really sure how well raising
games doesn't scream
but you seem to be somewhat interested
in racing games that's a good
thank you for streaming well thank you
for showing it up
it was a fun game at least you were able
to complete more than two tracks yeah
it's suddenly a better game than the C3
that's way too difficult
that I couldn't
uh I
so
did we
you know what
because
because Lolly showed up in
on stream
how fast we go and visit visit her
back
I don't think that you would expect
that would be fun
just to she's a bunny
I'm a bunny just copy that and
paste it in the chat
when when we go move over there
she's playing Animal Crossing New
Horizons
you all know about that game
I assume
and of course
which is very slow while I'm streaming
I don't I wonder if this computer being
slow or if it's just my internet being
slow
in there
but yes thank you all for coming and I
don't have anything more to add more
racing tomorrow
by on Thursday Friday and dog's life on
Saturday Sunday
I like this game thank you
and
we see you
