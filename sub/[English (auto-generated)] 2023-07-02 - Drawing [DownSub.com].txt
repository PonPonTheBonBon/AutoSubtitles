this moment

how to do that

foreign

This Server that seems almost easy

so yeah so make sure you check the

[Music]

but today is the second but next week on

no you got the first

you truly are different

yeah first is mine today

no one else gets to him

right in there but yeah you don't have

to wait three minutes we got it

foreign

[Music]

like

[Music]

and enough

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

okay

okay

obviously the button probably needs to

be hired

and then I probably have to

adjust the size of the characters

that's such things can be adjusted

afterwards that's not a problem

afterwards

okay okay

Style

foreign

laughs

I really need your headlights

someone

is someone doing that first

but

foreign

[Music]

laughs

foreign

[Music]

Surfer ends

that's a shame

found the source

okay that's lucky

this is a science picture

efforts of the card

a of the during the cards but yeah and

it's

like from the wrong side

kiss

oh

all right I'll do some rough sketching

foreign

[Music]

but that's

exactly but at this point

[Music]

has a good length again it's it's a long

story

[Music]

then back

[Music]

they might need to be

[Music]

more spacing

let's be like yeah

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

reference

if it's good reference question

yeah you don't need to work on the

bun

welcome

[Music]

I hope you have a good time here

we are drawing bunnies and and not funny

this is not a bunny this is some

Japanese bunnies

but there are some ones

is

the response foreign

um yeah I don't know I'm just

you know it's changed anything

it was to like

the characters like

is that in the back towards everything

you can do it the other way around you

can't see the back of the character

my mother finds pause Friday

[Music]

everything is very similar though

foreign

[Music]

is it I actually don't remember what

time you are in but

I'm glad he's stopping by

e

should I

I can I can like make it in message a

little

since it was decidable

about the year

coming play the string

[Music]

I feel a bit unorganized at the moment

but

[Music]

so that is

I compare like nine weeks this is my

chainmail so can't see her back yet

well I didn't mean the Lifter on the

back of the car units you like that

Okay so

[Music]

[Music]

nine yes

okay it must be like yeah

okay finish this one

yeah that's better

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

yeah that would make it a bit easier

I hope

it's safe with them

all right

foreign

[Music]

it usually streams for it varies

yeah it's very a lot like from two to

five hours

no and the other person is Shadow direct

go

actually it's going to be

asthma

yeah he can stay for like a few hours

one hours three hours it's but he he has

a very consistent as well so

however long we feel like streaming for

I guess

[Music]

the it's a game called the

an escape simulator they sure love

putting simulator name right but you

think it's it's worth having a different

name

but anyway it's it's like puzzle solving

game and that could be an interesting

first game

or for me

do you want 20 years so I guess yeah

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

yeah plinky

[Music]

looking at some

art

some dude make them quite pointy so I

guess that's fine

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

foreign

[Music]

but

I can make it bigger

[Music]

is with Hangouts

you may not even be here everyone but uh

like that

other advice

19.

that fits how the rest of the hair is

supposed to look

it's a bit stricky though but

if you want

[Music]

yeah I probably have to redraw that by

the way or the

um

[Music]

it's easy to tell us what's going on

there

Swift I I started to the right

because it looks like you swept its

teeth not to the left yes sorry I was

wrong

it's five to the left

as you have to turn left I'm stopped it

by our Direction

[Music]

oh

my God

and also

yes

and I mixed up the words I meant I meant

left

but I didn't say

[Music]

[Music]

anything else

the face

so like

let's see eyes because

I'm wearing this but maybe

I decided if she should yeah be picking

on your face if you should be careful

right she

it would be like the determined I guess

like she could be

amazing yeah

anything

I need to figure out how to make guys

here but yeah she could be like

and

yeah determine expression

can you have us

did they like a snout

my confidence in too much have one but

what's this one

and this this is flat here are some

obvious notes

[Music]

a sec

so I can

make something and of course knowing

that I yes yes I probably wouldn't be

always right

I mean

it's okay

like give give a hint

of one it's no problem

since you wanted like

covering everything so hard to see

what's going on

[Music]

yeah how is

how is the stripes on the hands game to

show if you guys never mind

[Music]

but if you can draw one and I don't know

well we'll see how it goes

even though it kind of looks much like a

cat but

yeah with the head hit her

and I kind of blocks the view of any

stripes down

we can have the stripes

if you want

to fight it down like between the eyes

I'm gonna make it more obvious

yeah hey

a very definite show yeah that is true

would be

pain

I should edited her picture TV

[Music]

[Music]

next world

how to draw a skunk tail without it

looking like a squirrel head

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

when I add the stripes that will help I

think my battery lasting

we'll see how it goes

this looks like an interesting character

more defined hips

highlights that works

[Music]

yeah maybe I should do like a clean up

at this point

see what's going on

79

and then Clips in

[Music]

foreign

sketch drive it's coming to haunt you

or haunt me maybe

I should have this thing

even

I never trust a sketch rabbit

[Music]

[Music]

should have made the most before drawing

those ropes and the scary boss is

SketchUp

no that would be terrible

[Music]

sometimes they

and it must quickly and sometimes very

slowly

but not many days left

technically streams but it's not

contain

I get Fuller remotes and at that point

it should also

the alt upgrade

like

upload the emails shouldn't require the

approval process

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

this is enough this is not final

yeah I need to figure out what kind of

eyes

it should be

I like that do you want like eyelashes

or something

eyebrows

I think girly stuff

and you have

but and that's what this time is

required building

the eyebrows

[Music]

[Music]

if you've seen soup

yeah her eyebrows will be on this on

this train

uh

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

eyebrows

it would be

[Music]

okay

that's okay

[Music]

I'll just catch

irritates me

I don't know

better

this became without the hair but

yeah the question is

it looks good without the hair

I mean I guess it still works but

foreign

that's what's important

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

foreign

[Music]

it's it's another character today

something

hello

thank you for the follow

hello hello

the art creation here

[Music]

um

[Music]

schedule

[Music]

[Music]

it looks like perfect

[Music]

yeah I said it looks too much like a

squirrel but it's not meant to be scared

[Music]

it's apparently I can only dress

Koreans

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

mostly trying I'm still knitting

drawings

[Music]

foreign

experience

experimenting that's the way I was

thinking a lot

I'm not addictive English speaking

if you prompted obvious

from the way I speak

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

and install it here

[Music]

and maybe I want to reference

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

probably not

that's why she should wear a dress or

something instead

it should be

[Music]

just a silly one

[Music]

being here for fun

[Music]

and I guess apply the sticks

[Music]

person is going to be blocked by the

armor anyway

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

that's the way

not to draw this sword

to use

[Music]

it

all right

[Music]

foreign

Hands by sword drawing Swords by hand

here's the sword

messy but

this way

someone sent me a picture of the sword

good good

thank you

[Music]

yeah I'm not

[Music]

duplicate these swords but

foreign

[Music]

I can try to make it a bit more even

all right

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

early entrance

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

exactly

me drawing hands

including power hands always Australian

hey never easy

[Music]

I might need to move house around

uh sure there shouldn't be a problem

[Music]

yeah that shouldn't be a problem

just speak

just speak aren't everything that sounds

my shadow and one more piece

that's what

[Music]

and then I'll just

flip it around

everything

[Music]

anything for your arms

and then drip them paste on arm

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

and now

[Music]

please

maybe maybe I should make this sword not

armed maybe I should still

a bit more like this

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

and then I move the sword instead

relax

[Music]

ing

now let me

watch adjustments

I see a chef friends

but the posts that they're gonna drop in

because I can't see anything in a person

says

I thought if someone had me so I didn't

suppose but it's like from behind and

everything comes up

I can't see what's going on

my name is

yeah if you can get both

no

no

foreign

let me

please

[Music]

maybe I shouldn't

have to sort up a bit

and yeah

yes we should have a better reference so

I can actually see what's going on

[Music]

do you think twice that was me

oh here we go yeah it's actually someone

different Mouse

it's so tiny skin

my

it doesn't make sense anywhere else in

it

interesting

pictures

237 pixels tall

to show a health person

well it's something at least

bikinis

Maybe

even if it's really tiny

furnace of course as this person is

right-handed and facing the wrong way so

if I do mirror it

is Lieutenant in that case and

that's determining from

the picture if I want to scan it wrong

but

it should be boring

okay I can do further adjustments

foreign

[Music]

no it wasn't

I disagree

but I didn't like it

it's

I mean I can undo

but

okay

[Music]

you don't like me

if you don't like the new position I can

always go back to your penis

yeah that that arm is going to be tricky

to work with

[Music]

but

foreign

[Music]

maybe that's worse

Maybe

you prefer the other position

because go back to it

thank you

foreign

this would be the head

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

foreign

[Music]

but if she likes bases if you

yes

Maybe

[Music]

[Music]

we'll see this because

[Music]

a different pose

yes I put this on a separate layer now

against copy the layers layer and

environment

[Music]

there's a completely other idea is to

basically

I would show The Sword not being in a

ready position to attack

[Music]

and

I like come closer

I'll use this sword

[Music]

since since I've covered today I can

experiment it's Mission simple

something more like

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

moment

yeah I see what I'm going through

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

there's no chance it would be

hello Rocket Man

thank you

hey have you seen him

some more

some more Arch

going on today

I'm just experimenting with

oh see at the moments

because I have an idea of what I want

but

that's neat

missionaries it's a different thing

that's

[Music]

a different challenge

essay

but

yeah the pose is a bit dark but I think

it's a piece of option between that

position

and the

sketch doesn't know

I think I know how to cut it I'm not

sure if it's a card I don't know what

guard means in this content

it's more like a taunt or something

[Music]

don't

[Music]

yeah it is

[Music]

if by an actual fighting pose no that's

no

although you could yeah I could see that

this one

and another one yet right

yeah I wasn't going for it and

again it doesn't give me another idea

for one

which is

[Music]

[Music]

let me I need to find

just a reference to

and approach everything for it

I can't see one

no that's that's good

only so so it isn't really my

area

[Music]

[Music]

it's me thank you

guys

18 gods

[Music]

and there was nothing that

I was like before

I mean

that's a sun option

try that

[Music]

[Music]

something

the post is almost everybody thank God

[Music]

picture

[Music]

I mean

it's a picture that's actually doing the

pose

but from

is it so tiny I have pictures so tiny

why am I supposed to

it's really the highest quality

uh it's even smaller than this

that

I need

[Music]

[Music]

but first it didn't look in

exciting very much

[Music]

let me continue to thank God for now and

see where I can go with it

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

that doesn't make sense

[Music]

a little bit more for it

so both hands can reach it

part of experimenting

[Music]

the hands are awkward as usual but

that's it

that is just how it ends up when I'm

drawing

yeah that's and that's best with posing

it's something

not ask you too much

foreign

[Music]

foreign

I mean

foreign

[Music]

words that's an option

it's actually three monsters

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

Patty

[Music]

I like the size of the whole character

[Music]

another layer isn't heard very slowly

deposition character designs for

language

[Music]

when yeah

the tricky part is to add the armor

I'm seeing system having even though

it's not that easy to draw

thank you

I'll draw a cute dress instead

[Music]

I made the dress

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

sorry this is

not exhausting

each other

I was a bit

more mentally exactly that I

right first anticipate it

stomach and then I didn't let that work

I'm gonna work on the shadow wolves now
