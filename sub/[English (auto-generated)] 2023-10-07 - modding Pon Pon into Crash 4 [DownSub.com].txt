Discord server I don't remember if you
on it
but so we are working on today hey f f
17
Princess am I fun 17 princess yeah you
can't put anything around an OTE because
twitch doesn't use colon like Discord
does p p do T posing that one they call
that one a posting even though
it it's not really an a POS we don't
really have a letter for
that I think there is a letter in like
Greek or something anyway this is the
outfit so
specifically someone who goes with the
name snack boy
games a naked ping for our
endowment yes
exactly totally what's going
on here we go someone wanted me to make
a
robot and I've thought that would
actually be kind of kind of
funny oh you
people it's cool
drawing yeah I
think I think it's
pretty like I like I like how it looks I
like the idea
and so that's what
the cement BL here it's actually a
television I use as a
reference or the head and uh probably be
larger and we got um follower login
1 what your
Ling thank you for follow
but this will just be a reference so I
will not
actually copy
it and I guess I should state that it is
Rh Creations who have made the TV as
well giving credits to
everyone but I will make my own head t s
for f
fun
oh starting off with a quick right here
hello funa robot polish word for labor
is a Robotnik oh
nice well I
mean
welcome what was it again
SP ah wait wait SPC that's like a
spectacle but you're a
spectacle I kind of got that at the end
of my stream
last time you were here well welcome
soona oh hey me again yes you
again eventually got it
yeah let's do the other shot at
you soon makes art now this time you
were playing C of th but you gotten so
far ahead of your art
making there have time to play some
games and today I'm making
art
I did Art too
o art and gaming
[Music]
now so let's oops inside the head let's
just copy something here I can
use and then I will turn this this
thing into whole
screen isn't
that the Wonder
with it's the
modeling so what I need is
uh I'm more I I would arue that I'm I
felt that a long time to I'm
with
[Music]
like and or like organic creature again
rather
than
H
items still to nice the hand which is
great but what was your art today maybe
I should take a
look you know cuz he was to kind to
raid
uh let's see if I can l in this
[Music]
time
[Music]
I'm still working on my
burger so well I've got them in my
Discord but they're not up post next all
right I post one for each day I think
yeah yeah yeah that that's how
but what will show you latest
then what do you say about
that that would be wait why did I show
the dates 12 hours again so that would
yesterday's
drawing tomorrow the next day is
Commander keing today was
yest wait
today this 12 hours
ago oh you posted like 12 hours ago
today yeah you from Australia right so
today for you has been a
while this the I really love that was
from un oh maybe we should take that one
instead because yes yes I never saw you
because I had to
go H I never saw you when it was
completely finished but I could see you
working it and it was really great so
let's show that one
instead
and let's switch our
here
yeah
and here we
go now we can make it in a b there we go
that's an artwor for
p p I don't
know here
is Instagram if you want to watch look
at more of the art but this is what art
looks like with a little little fo
and a huge
wall I love that one so much it's really
really great and all the particles and
everything add it yeah so much
detail start to help with some black
lines and now all
these r with well I would say kitsuna so
I will say psun but I do know that some
say kitsun a which I found a bit odd
it's that's not how it's should be
pronounced from the language it comes
from
but let mean know
like like how I
say Lolly de when she says Lolly do
just is just because I say you but I do
want to pronounce the names how are
supposed to be
pronounced like how the person s says it
someone
had work with pixels so
pixel I would say
like but I mean I can say it's
bigun if you want it's your
name
so I mean I I do prefer when people say
pon pon and not pon pon I'm not good at
saying out the
way but I mean I'm not picky I'm not
picky at
all
Pi yeah that that's that work that's
good name good nickname short and the
point
so so I want it to be
well
4x3 I assume would be a good
size cuz you
know wait if I do it 2x three that means
I
can Center it and then I can duplicate
and put it on other
side and Mar
them so this is 4 by three but a mistake
a lot of people does do is that uh
aspect ratio does not have a
size so I can make it as large as I
want there's a lot of a lot of places
where people make mistake
of bon
bon
zon P pawns I just call you Pawn I mean
there's a lot of people that call me
pawn
my so my name would be pon pon and
then and I'm the
bond but p is
[Music]
fine your name is very fun especially
why I read you orally a lot of people
like say that my name is funny
and that's nice to hear that you like
like my name and willing to even read me
just based on my
[Music]
name oh I so that got
a that supposed to be a
box but I do like your I like Pi soon is
not yeah say doesn't
matter um I do like your name it's it's
quite it's a it's a
clever clever combination of words there
PTO no not
edes D no she's inside the
Box put my
drink Haven okay let me finish my
[Music]
burger
[Music]
there we
go evening because it's cold here you
know
what it is a bit chilly in here but
that's a good thing because then the
computer can
not over
here so I'm
thinking that the edges on the screen be
something like
[Music]
that
maybe is that evil pon pon s map over
there what this one is a TV no no no
name me here yes this is
you but we can switch it out
for any thing
[Music]
here like good p
p actually I did
name yes I need to rename the previous
robots to
[Music]
yes there no
problem play on down on
F
hello hello
hello if I do
this the segments here should be the
same
she's not going real
here inside this
thing okay let's see
how for I
want I
think
s
and assume it should be smaller in
back I mean
the reference art wasn't too detailed on
that I I did get a second one and it's
same size all the way back but I
think just like this see that it should
get smaller
PR is robot you already made a robot F
no no it's it's what Bianca taken
replacing the
robot and then I moved ban to a
different outfit so I could have the
robot replace the robot po that's
[Music]
one
this is quite a
lch maybe it should be
smaller this D has clever use
of
gons
[Music]
so so as you can see here it's quite
straight from this direction but this
direction goes down this actually be
up
[Music]
that
okay
and if you look at the top of the model
it looks like a head shape buny
shot spell
right oh you mean this oh yeah it is
true this looks like a bunny you got a b
bunny ears and even a
pain that's a funny
coincidence it got like
a line here and I realize I don't have
the window
open I only do that for
a like a line here they take a photo of
a real
TV so they have the line here but they
don't have it on top of
it which I would Saye makes
sense well very closeing probably not of
because I assume the t is made of
multiple PS but you
don't it isn't really sh
that don't think I need to go that far
[Music]
but okay so what to have
[Music]
here so if I put the glass piece
here and
the the glass would be curved I
think I should go to the store to pick
up this we groceries that sounds like a
good idea should going through
that so if I add now
you like
that
this one is the
one if I do
that is getting
ah okay so this too far back
[Music]
okay okay I can
do oh no that was
no so you can snip
C come
on
anyway be back in a bit I don't think
I'll provide it I'm always
wrong D come
[Music]
[Music]
on hey um unless you want me I mean it
is
fun to be
honest when it works on that I should go
and put away the tape
plate
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I now I'm here
again okay okay see is fine let's see
9:30 here 9:30 or 63
your yeah I think saying it my time is
good because then everyone can see the
time hi hello spamming welcome back
[Music]
so
a lot of people writing to me while
[Music]
I'm okay so 163 yes you want was 2
minutes there we
go
and then I delete everything
[Music]
outside and delete the rest of this SP
and there we go now we
got a screen here that's
slly for
shooting maybe it's maybe it's too
little I can always
WR make it more
extreme yeah slightly I think it's
[Music]
good so maybe I should increase like 50%
so it's more
obvious now now it's pink we seeing
from
way
way
[Music]
back to screen
making so
the other side is basically
the what it stands on so it's mostly
flat when it does
go so I can have it go
up
just just a bit a
much like
that this piece I don't need
anymore and the
top
CU this whole piece here is supposed
to supposed to I'll do
it yeah but maybe having it go in like
this might give a better look maybe I
should go to this VI although it's hard
to see you too let's shade left
I
easier but I can move where on the
texture this
is that's dark
gray maybe should be more textured like
this hey there you go now you can see
what
going
[Music]
h
[Music]
[Music]
wind wind
[Music]
wind
[Music]
I'm just messing around and see what it
works yo
[Music]
the
now
it's screen
[Music]
like
[Music]
move that
down move down
to there's no backs side in
[Music]
anything
[Music]
right there we
[Music]
go
[Music]
oh that's not what I
[Music]
wanted
[Music]
it is
[Music]
very I was just thinking if I
should yes shrink it down like
this
[Music]
that run there
[Music]
[Music]
we
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
now
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
nice
[Music]
morning this green hair is going to be
glass is
Thea
[Music]
let but they might have the wrong type
of but there are
some there some of the outfits that do
have glass and I could reuse one of
those
so let's
see B
okay it's
time because they can reuse material
from each other like
that so do we
have it could be crash outfit like that
because that one has a monol which might
be what I'm looking
for there's also
crash what a crash
I Vis
like yeah all all the ones Coco has have
tinted
glass I should either go with that
one or that one let's
see
oh think
[Music]
some got not signing do not shown
L okay one more
[Music]
try
it might be what I'm looking for let
see so I can set back for my CH
correctly
him shouldn't take this that
just there
[Music]
go
soing to to
robots yeah there we go that's the one
I'm looking for
so in addition to this material I will
add one new that's
called Fresh recti
glass because it will act like well
glass okay first have can
I there we
go if I like Shan
Smo again now
shiny there we
go
I've course then on the inside
[Music]
here there's going to
be the actual
[Music]
screen the actual a s that will hold the
um
detection actually never looked deep
looked
into CRT screen should as far as I know
the reason why it's curved is because
inside here I should
actually
I should actually set a cur inside
instead
which will hold the
[Music]
picture
okay hi there how's it going hello
J it's going well I'm making a computer
head that is because I'm using this as
my reference
[Music]
mind my youer sck Bo
games so and I thought it was so cute I
wanted to make
[Music]
it
so back to
[Music]
history so I'm trying to make
the
[Music]
green but I guess it's kind of made now
[Music]
so I guess because this outfit will
change
everything there won't be a single thing
on this out using something from stard
F which means I can make a completely
new
fixture time do
anyway
I think I made
them quite large cuz you can always
scale them by May don't need to scale
them p is an important
cas
[Music]
so here why is so much
[Music]
small now it's too
[Music]
big there we
go so what we need for this outfit
is a bunch of fet
We need c e FC
FW m n and
R too
many let's go here and call this
monitor that will make
me
and then unwrapping this
thing so I need to decide my name seems
should
go
there you go that made me
good oh look it's the chil
out hey why didn't have to rotate the
whole
thing
and what is
what this is a top wrong
selection the top is
yes why is it all
tilted
I guess I just have
to do that
instead
[Music]
so this is the back
[Music]
side the monitor is going to be a
separate separate texture that will
show Bon's face and I was thinking about
that texture should
have let me touch the not do textures
here
[Music]
and
[Music]
yeah and then I will have the
texture because they're
touching
[Music]
if I
do
[Music]
that but I will I will make the
[Music]
uh the screen have different uh
animation so
[Music]
there
and so the face will do any actually
have Expressions that are cycled
through since there is a filter for that
[Music]
I shouldn't have done this until I'm
satisfied with the shape of the Hat do
you feel like I'm satisfied with shape
of the Hat am I
[Music]
though
[Music]
[Music]
hello
Rosie what are you making
today I
am making a
screen
okay I making this this one that someone
D for me
hello who want me
[Music]
to
my anyway so games did this drawing for
me and I thought found
it an interesting so I wanted to make it
an actual 3D
model oh that's kid yeah it's a very
nice
drawing just had to make it a 3D moment
be
fun just try try my
best head screen exactly so it's going
to show a picture of
uh the the picture on it is going to be
Pon P's face but more like retro
monochrome
sty
I hope you don't mind I add to a bunny
video releas
oh you're collecting funny
MERS have to cre a big list of funny
streamers I've been thinking about
myself like imagine a
website where you have a list
of all vtubers I guess doesn't
specifically have to be that but
uh there are all ways of doing it too H
where
you where simply Le what like species
everybody's country they from and then
you can kind of find what you want to
live
for last stream they had you know
they're
acting
there you
go yes I watch a lot of bunny
stream no oh no oops I'm happy to be one
of
those one of the special one that you
watch after a slight change I I
found here we
go that sounds
nice yeah so you can find active
streamers of different animals if you
want to watch a certain
animal and also
like
oops try to put on my sh
but
shirt I'm we address don't way I wasn't
L but yeah you could have like
a gender too if you want which it could
be useful if like want to
find which would include if the person
is transgender or six gender so you can
find like transgender people want like
find help
which is nice
to obviously only if they public about
it
obviously but that could also be nice to
have find like
people similar to
you better then you need to host the
website some don't want to syn it but we
do have
preferences
like I was a bunch of different I mean
sure I like
bues
but but I do watch a bunch of different
[Music]
Els that was the corner I used there I
should remember use the same color on
the monitor monitor being color the same
because it's like gray it shows the
stuff
easier so what I need is the same
roughness it's going to be a bit
[Music]
shiny but it's not metallic I don't
think yeah I need
[Music]
that inside there we
go
okay currently there's nothing on the
outfit but so I need the B there for C
robot anyway
and
then
metal and
roughness we going to be Sol color for
the
moment
that's
let me leave things
[Music]
added on
here more
here now the
SE
m
r and yeah finally
end
[Music]
all right quickly make it like rest will
be S
color nothing
[Music]
fancy there we
go that chain
smooth I think this looks
good so there a glass in front of this
see but yeah there's going to be an
inside which is this part
here I know the glass doesn't matter
actually only the inside
matters because the
inside
yeah that's great because now it's on
this side
go okay let me try
to make everything
again so this will be this
screen H need the science
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
for
so I
think what I want to do
is cuz the whole texture
is
496 so I do that eight8 size is fin
one this SI maybe that's good
size
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
B now think of
[Music]
me that
167 confused
so it's going to be
there
might
it wa 7
mov
that's what should be I export
this and inside of this game should be
some pattern to
it
and
that's supposed to look like yeah I'm
not sure what I
know
finway
does
matter the color that is for moment
but I'll make
it that
[Music]
color I get
dark and then I make a stri and
Crossing or
something
yeah time together this strap should be
I don't
know
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
huh
maybe I should
have okay let's see how it looks
first
I there go
maybe actually it doesn't
look but it has to be copied over
[Music]
to
[Music]
there not metallic I don't have to do
anything
C it would not be rough at on say it's
going to be a
white
that could
[Music]
see it being a normal that for
though that's
play
[Music]
like
that I think the
time an hour again oh
my you got
another in sports way
n
so right
here crazy
breath wait a
[Music]
minute
I need this pattern it's a very strong
pattern so let's a there you
go and then same
that I
know so let's see I uped the roughness
yeah now the inside is not rough at all
and I
this
different see
anything
man trans
can
[Music]
there we go I
[Music]
guess it's my
[Music]
monitor
I'll see if I can do
and I'll put a face on
this I guess this will
be cuz I have
[Music]
to so there will be one in front which
will act as the which will have the
animating stuff which will be a complet
yeah
but
when you turn into an
angel only the
uh body will turn into an
angent only the body
material for will duplicate
this and create a new one one
here and this will be be the uh robot
that is
the
face which have the animation but I one
one to carry over to the angel effect to
the one behind would be displayed
instead which could be a a shut
[Music]
down so let's see if I can do
you oh no that's
[Music]
creepy let's start with something easy
like the
[Music]
ear okay let's call
this
[Music]
monitor this like this my
gu
[Music]
what why they sign they they will be
kind of like te drop
[Music]
designs just floating
[Music]
[Music]
behind
1 2 3 4 5
[Music]
6
[Music]
work just be the a no connection to hand
anything
[Music]
[Music]
I like
that
[Music]
I'm me is
[Music]
[Music]
this
[Music]
[Music]
oh don't have some
sickness like
[Music]
that and
[Music]
then
[Music]
it will be an edge to them before you
get the
inside and I do want an even
amount that's
not now a
decision the person made here was that
the inside of the air should be blue not
think which is an interesting decision
and I never question
[Music]
that because you would imagine Pon
having pink not
blue but
artist in Sabo games probably had a
reason for that
decision
[Music]
that that's more like
[Music]
it dang
[Music]
CH Point like that it's something I'm
not too much
of
[Music]
y
[Music]
hello jellyfish

here
of course then I need to decide more
exactly what shade of blue it should
[Music]
be I guess I take like the shade of pink
and then you shift it might give me a
good
blue a complimentary blue
sh
there we
go that's the
[Music]
shape
so this is the pink I use
for the bow
[Music]
normally so that's I should probably use
for the pink parts of the
[Music]
outfit
maybe that BL that's actually not a good
bad
BL you know what
let's
complimentary
[Music]
colors yes
[Music]
so copy
this actually it gives this
color as the complimentary
color nice and
[Music]
teal
[Music]
[Music]
I think I like that blue actually so I
use
[Music]
it so now this one be the inside let's
do
some slight trickery
meting I don't know for me so I want to
export this
first the order doesn't
actually I will export
this and on the metal what I will
do is so I will make it just a slightly
B metal that gives it a going to give it
a slightly
[Music]
effect export at and then it export
it robot me export
[Music]
yes and for the roughness
[Music]
here I'm actually going to make more
rough than no less rough in more shiny
than the general shiny because Shin is
pure
shiny it sles this like
rough which I
think
yeah because allows me to make things
even
shinier if need it
so yeah one more thing I should should
do
[Music]
this is
the
something no
[Music]
isn't wait why is this one
red it isn't red some reason it's red
we
anyway
[Music]
I will make a normal map of
[Music]
two we basically just make the
SC so we have this
ear with ear white as
[Music]
well but then I will make a
line two pixel
line on the
edge line like
that this will create an
[Music]
indentation that means that uh when I
generate the
[Music]
normal
map and H for
high now if you go to noral
map
yes
scen this is change
[Music]
my
yeah
then
exporting
now we can update the normal
map
[Music]
H robot here we
go there we go now I test this Eng here
I
wanted was using the
wrong
material this ede is
[Music]
purely B
reflection you the middle part is more
reflecting we go and bit more metallic
now it is a bit different style to monor
gu in the way that's even before I even
apply the
blue color to it there we go now it's
blue like a
[Music]
mirror but I will apply
mirror because these ear they should be
two of
them let's make a back just
should ears make a back up in case I
want to go back almost call them X
up X are things I'm not use anymore and
then make ures that at the
[Music]
bottom that might
[Music]
be more
like
me
[Music]
here there we
go the monitor has ears and as requested
by the artist
the
the different parts should be
[Music]
floating M do makes certain things
easier so I don't have to deal
with deal with a bunch of
stuff
so this one will follow the head
100% for the ears should probably follow
something oh that's
a m
[Music]
numbers
[Music]
so now follow half one
[Music]
half that means if I able to pose
here wait the mirror should come before
anim there we go
look like it follows the
hands and the
ears the monitor is
align next than effect of the
gloss yeah we'll
see I crash does
[Music]
it there's one more thing it it's the
bow but I
see
[Music]
I need to R this and
ask games or ask
[Music]
[Music]
more
[Music]
i k
[Music]
show
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so so in the meantime I will do the rest
of the bonding so one part would be the
chest chest and the upper body and lower
body so I we copy this part
first and then according to the the
tricky
part because
now is day what is there any information
about
that
[Music]
I would say
he consider the person goes with Sack
Boy and refers to people as S boys and S
girls that was it
here I think
that's a fair
conclusion um yes so the drawing he
made I can show it again because it's so
nice it's more of a rough idea of what
you look like even though the the design
is quite simple too but when it comes to
more specific details like the bow uh oh
Tak a break from work to do a
n numing the bunny
wa thinking yeah it's going it's going
back
well
yeah I hope I hope work treats you well
and yeah I'm doing progress
on yes say
that this is more of a rough a rough
idea it's not
to like like the things I am curious
about is for example because of
[Music]
course
yeah yeah B basically what I'm curious
about is because there's like double
lines there if it is intended to
[Music]
be because it's on both sides and if
it's intended to be some design behind
[Music]
that however there's a double line that
to but more like not int 10
because
yeah so so so the exact details are hard
to determine
but I I guess it's more all so
that I am a bit more free to design it a
bit more how I
want as
[Music]
well but yeah but
like so
so
it should be smooth there and it
shouldn't be any neck should just be
flat on
top and things like
[Music]
that but I I did my
best after all the artwork was
only meant to give a rough idea how was
was supposed to be wasn't supposed to be
the
perfect
like cop not meant to copy exactly for
the
cinema I can be Pi
sometimes
[Music]
think an important aspect of me is the
uh I like to be
honest just one of
my I if you to be honest with me too but
it's possible it is possible to be
honest while also being
[Music]
nice
not
[Music]
that
playing but yeah it's going all right
I'm making good progress on this I'm
happy about
that and I'm liking how it turns out so
far and to the sign so
far
but yeah when I saw the drawing first I
was so excited like this is definitely
something I want to
make hello roxies you found a
star you found yourself
you are the
star what does the study it gives you
attention
aing I really need I really want like a
PO emote of pom pom but of course the
joke is there's no pop pets just a
so what I missed since I was last was
here and you were
[Music]
[Music]
grammar and whatever H I
think I don't know but I did at least
what I consider complete I would
probably some more details on the
Monitor and the
[Music]
ears and now I'm
making the
chest justest
casie
this
my interesting it doesn't move those
independently of each other even though
it
was
blend is inconsistent
[Music]
right
oh oh yeah that was the mistake I
made got set of B
mod yo
nice I'm happy you like it it's going to
be so some so amazing SE
animated I really hope
the the
sign why is it amazing
to that
way oh yeah I
am I am turning the B
lowly that was a
small
do you're do half an hour too early you
have to you will time out for
30 some egg eat
hydrate and check
welcome
and W that time
out Ed out by the bunny bun what an
honor
don't ask me why I call myself the
bunny I don't think I call myself that
before bunny
bun
[Music]
Tex
Mickey
[Music]
p p tell me a funny joke I want to go
fer than the ones I was telling the
other day yeah you said you were
ling a lot
by a spontaneous J made
once I really wish I could hear how much
you were lost
I and I wish
too if you if you you really find it
that funny I wish I was
there okay apparently I'm Different joke
she was saying how PA's listening to and
are very polite because when you ask
them a question they say thank
you I was watching a cartoon in
poish
and and they often said in that show
F and sometimes
just which of course is than thanks in
[Music]
Swedish so this is the
pie and the and the head will just float
above
it cuz these pieces are
floating forever in Polish word Tu means
yes and it's pronounced similar to the
sish T course I can't do much of a
pronunciation difference because I have
poish I basically the Swedish
is
[Music]
talk
so I'm trying to
S good luck
and watch out she's
sinking something like
that
we
but yeah I could switch over to the
material it's supposed to be
robot there go I look it's
shiny like H painted
metal I was going to say licorice that's
not
oh what do you call a dear with no
eyes a blind
there no
idea didn't you already do that
joke I'm pretty sure it was a Tuesday as
well
it's not the week isn't isn't even over
yet it's already recycling
jokes hello
sh I don't even been here
but and I still like to say say hello
when people haven't written you know
mind so to be sure how long it goes was
it since you lost WR something it's been
over half an hour I think that's fair
hello don't feel any pleasure to write
anything you are allowed to spend as
much time as you want here no
pressure I had people being like
um like oh I don't want to write
something if
I I is like I'm going I'm not I don't
want to write something if not going to
like stick around anyway
like don't don't think like that it's
it's fine it's
fine even if you want a single message
and Le leaves immediately it's in L if
you if you write something
anyway and that goes for anyone looking
at the
moment and if you don't feel like
writing that's prob fine too I want
everyone to
I've been laging hello again yeah that's
that's that's
nice I did the drino elephant joke and I
think a whole some egg did the fish with
no I'm Prett no I'm pretty sure there
was it no
idea in the in there to it might not
have been you though
but i s it
[Music]
was maybe it was something
like
Benny maybe it's was
PNY
anyway
no suppos to spit it
twice measure once split twice now
wait and for those who weren't here for
it what you call a combination between
an insurance and an
elephant doing a l as well but I here en
jooy the
CH that's nice to hear
it that's a very weird way of calling a
combination between S and F
but Elo Elo
Elo I don't remember it the I joke I
heard that one at work the other day I
told them the jokes that you didn't want
to read still got a lot of them if you
wanted to know I you try to play
something
here it almost sounds like this because
I don't enjoy that type of joke as if
for find that no I
would I don't think that's what he said
fun
[Music]
like they appreciated my
humor
when I mean
sure I gu I guess I've been
criticizing your
humor I would join in and make a pun
about the wind but it
blows there you
go perfect
perfect I feel like I'm not as
expressive as other people when it comes
like laughing and
stuff it's just who I am my
case but there go
funs yeah I wish I could be more
expressive like some other people
here burst out laughing on
[Music]
stream but would I would be the T little
[Music]
bu see I didn't miss like that no
but that's what he said
man I'm I'm reading in between the
[Music]
lines there you go missing up please H
are you making this part it identical
next I mean I know I could just Mir it
yeah Miss like
your thank you I know there is a mirror
mode like I can't even that and then I
can
[Music]
who and then I can't just and this
side and then it will look the same
other
thing I definitely is the mirror no
mirror mod I know there's a mirror
modified too but but I got like U map
and everything here oops I guess I have
to
anyway cuz this is
a pretty
[Music]
bad
okay
let's have to do the U mapping
anyway let's delete half
[Music]
the here we
[Music]
go apply modifier
mirror and there we
go
I wasn't being serious when I said they
appreciate
thing but they didn't appreciate your
joke it was supposed to be taken as
another
joke I didn't get that
joke also selecting hop is easier in the
Wii I mean that was I think I wented
pretty it was quick and
easy don't Fe Swedish
noises I look I can edit one half the
other half with
[Music]
copy so
anyway I think I need to smooth lot this
part or
something
our Tex
smoes it's a step in the right
direction I might might need to one a
way to clean up these lines a b more let
me see if I can do it
first oh it looks fine kind of fine here
not off this
maybe
I think something
else I don't know why but it's being so
shiny it's where you why it's going to
be a robot it's going to be like metal

it
shorter Fe back make it sh make it
sh
pump like
spinach to be fair it was quite a while
I had it
last ni and so
maybe yeah I'm not sure why
it's oh no see because
there now was kind of kind of neat
looking how will you be strong to the
Finish If You Don't Eat Your
Spinach me I do eat other
[Music]
stuff spinach isn't like only the

letters hips
I know what I call this
[Music]
part
I oh are
[Music]
you I'm St to the Finish cuz I eat me
spinach I'm
[Music]
man now why does it look like this
spider like like it starts
here and then it goes around
here and then it goes and then end
there this are perfect lip
Stu so that was that part but that's
what kind what I meant with the
drawing drawing drawing
drawing cuz yeah because it seems to be
like this is a pink part that it should
be like gr part but it's because there's
pink here I I consider if I sh add or
not because there's no pink here so
maybe I should skip this pink what I'm
assume is that it's supposed to be like
the outline of the dress
I mean she could have like it appear
like a beginning then that's
[Music]
fine yeah then
[Music]
up
there yeah now it's a second now I can
leave one
more now just need to figure out how W
it should be
compared like we
can maybe it's fine like this maybe I
can that maybe this this is
fine
butor
[Music]
SP by the way papy was based on an
actual passion of Frank
Rocky fan was born in
Poland I heard about that
[Music]
before
[Music]
I was also born in
Europe
of course I mentioned a few times
before of course you
have
I wouldn't have been the same if I
didn't know about
that or if I happen to forget about
[Music]
it change smoo no wait vertex
smooth that's what I want
the shrink which
I it's pretty
smooth I don't feel like it
could
there another
thing I was thinking a way of doing this
that doesn't resol
in tiny tiny one
[Music]
guns since
way I when I SM like
that might be
[Music]
fun
[Music]
interesting
[Music]
music
[Music]
this is like a dark spot
[Music]
thing
think
something interesting music yeah just
some random random
songs on that website someone
suggested but I wasn't sure about
um
I was was going to be allowed
to do with the what I there was that
Miss but it was
fine cuz I don't want the vult to be
different probably have to do that at
some point but
well does this work it's not perfect
but I
know what is
this what what is
this here we
go I wonder this should be try
to
anyway it it
works now question is if it should be
this tone or that
[Music]
Tor like it could be this turn or delete
that r why I get this this maybe maybe
that's should maybe I should
take maybe
maybe
okay there should be
inside nice SP a
robot yeah look at this
butt
the camera will be behind there
throughout the game play
so you are going to get good views of
her
butt I've heard a drill
but
not sure what oh is
it all right yes I
see yeah I'm not to exact the sh sure
where I will put this
seam I could put this seam like around
like
[Music]

[Music]
seam

for bye-bye have a good sleep have a
good l
haven't been able to watch the stars as
much as just
yet but they are both very very
nice I've
[Music]
been so
a how's it
going
I'm trying to see if I
can but I need to find a place
[Music]
there you seeing the edge of the texture
really
[Music]
mag it a very ni
[Music]
strength let's see this should be the
back this is the
front see turn oh no I didn't mean to
join them if I turn
this where
setting if I turn this under
[Music]
80°
these two I should be able
to overlap like that the perfect overlap
like it should be exact the same same
[Music]
CH
and
oh
now now you should be using metc rule
rers as a ruler
only as
rulers
[Music]
but but my rule is the king calls the
[Music]
16 unless he
has
unless he has resigned
or naturally or in
unnaturally
[Music]
inally pass on the crown naturally
or or on not
[Music]
natur
very way to trans
it you know the meme Americans will me
without extract the metric system Sly
there's a lot of people who
[Music]
do like
how and people are people like insist
that
uh
that's some fields are only measured in
metric well that isn't the case like if
I like I wanted
to let's
see going see which this there
is so that one and this I like when it
comes to pipes some insist of still Ines
there even in Europe but I don't my pipe
is 19
mm I think I haven't measured in a while
now it's only if I remember
number because I got a
new and
[Music]
the
oops the shower foret whatever it's
called and it broke like where the it
was a long time ago
though when you put the
hose and I just couldn't put another H
it was just completely
broken and the whole f it was and old I
guess there is another ter I
just which is more like technical
turn
and what a holy
thing and
[Music]
uh
yeah they call it an Armature I
think anyway
and but I wasn't sure if I confused that
with because I'm using Armature when do
the just that being confus by
with yeah it has a 190
mm
pip
on
or for
the
h so I just had to get
something because I
wanted so I got a hose so so the the the
one Armature has 19
mm connector which I could put
the a shower hose on because it had the
same size
and then uh I wanted to have a quick
release to put on the card house to
install install there so I need
it need Stu
that as so far as know 90 mm is standard
for shower H so I didn't really need to
care about the size I just get a shower
house because I got a new one because
the old one was also getting more that
so I just bought those two I didn't
really have to SN about the size of it
and it just fit but when I did the quick
release for switching out
the the shower hose for a garden house
that I had to make sure about the right
size make sure the products and
everything syst using inches but the
actual technical size of it is in
millimeters the inch is just ah name of
the size it's technically not in inches
that's why it has 90 mm because that is
90 mm in
is very close to uh 3/4 so it's like a
3/4
pipe cuz 18 mm
is
well too small and 20
is 19 is the closest to get this is very
very close but it is not 3/4 in it is 19
mm and that is a technical difference as
so 3/4 is the incorrect name because
it's not
[Music]
theis and if someone would say that well
it's easier to say 3/4 in 3/4 instead of
saying 19 mm in that case you can Saye
19 because everything when it comes to
sizes like that should be measured in
MIM anyway
anyway but
yeah yeah I exped that so now I should
go over
to p r
about
sling I mean the pro they they did L
both both Inches and mm so it wasn't
like in like that but but it was still
the interest that was the primary unit
would you
like oh oh swim it
sorry
[Music]
sorry you have to remember at Le
something that get it
automatic or shower is
broken
oh in what way is it
broken one of my favorite hairl large
Boulder the size of a small Boulder
blocking her
own someone said that that's probably a
mistake they probably didn't mean a
small Boulder they probably mean
something like a small car or
something which would make more
sense or like some other SES but they
had Boulder on the mine and worth B
again
then people some people do argue like
yeah but humans are better to like
relate sizes to other sizes yeah
but
[Music]
but sure you can give an example but at
least G the actual size is well there
another problem with
G one one size when it comes to length
that is so often
used I should probably
that and watching like
science Discovery Shanel is using the
length of empire state buildings I've
never seen it in my life I don't know
how large it is I don't yeah I don't
even know how large it is someone can
tell me but I forget in about an
hour anyways it doesn't
matter like it's it's not like an
international unit of
length
so really not
helping and so
on okay uh export this
now
sorry sorry I'm messing around with the
picture I
I why the V doesn't shut so the water
keeps running can't shut it off at the
shower have
to water line to it
are you able to get a new armor
CH is this some Reon sing
or is it a special one is really
expensive to
replace cuz that could also
[Music]
make
[Music]
okay sizes large pole size of seven
washing
machine
closure how difference are washing
machines in size I mean I do have like
my washing machine
especially with these like cars cars can
vary a lot in
size like I have a kind of large car but
that's a large car for like European
Standard I know some countries
have large cars which
[Music]
like is normal size to them
the same with Bridges
like and some places have large bridges
as their
standard what I would consider
large it happened today or last night
when I was at work okay so it was very
recent it wasn't like a
it's still annoying of course but it's
not
like an issue that has been going on for
a months or something and it haven't
been able
to replace it for some
[Music]
reason so yeah it's still annoying I
will not deny
[Music]
that would you consider my car large I
don't like I haven't really considered a
science of your cars CLE
same where is car and e s for
[Music]
something
okay let's see this is the metal
part normal
roughness y WR that's
done
oh right
sorry don't seem export to any color let
me do that
quick maybe I did but I'm did it again I
just be safe you go that's
pink bit met time to it but it will
change and than
you look at
that it will be pink so she doesn't look
naked or something like didn't
know would you consider my car large I
would read that one but
whatever
um I guess
I
guess I guess I should consider what
what the length of my car is and and
then compared to
that
over almost 5 m in length that's a long
car how long is my car
[Music]
okay actually my car
is more towards 4
me,
300 there we go
I got some ESAT for my
[Music]
car
[Music]
oh
my that was more quick s
gaming so your car is how much
longer uh
lightly wider but I'll bit
lower so I guess it wouldn't appear like
large
in that case lengthwise is is I guess is
the biggest difference
[Music]
[Music]
there okay so I assume
different parts here are yeah so if I
were
to show a post with this
one
yeah that's because these points don't
don't have anything to
follow but the whole but even if they
do is these
parts
there you
go anyway so when animation happens the
whole part will skew and
stuff but the I assume the part should
appear solid like a solid
pie so I need to find
which I got spines here
to I guess spine four
maybe
maybe half spine
4 half spine three SQ whatever that
sounds
for and because every
point is going to follow these
I think that's one wish I could see
like um because every point is following
the exactly the same it's going to look
solid here we got
like pis is the
only
non I prob it's the best option
here
just assume it should follow
like maybe
he okay what how about this half
pis a quarter left he a quarter right
he and I should have done that I ni to
CFE
[Music]
this means that it would be
affected half by Heap and half
by and it might give the theci effect
let's
see
yeah I mean yeah they're going to be
upset each other like
[Music]
that that's to be
[Music]
expected that's the time I was looking
for CU this an animation
second I can't play like
full that's playing pretty good
actually as you can see it's not playing
full speed though can't really do that
it's a beit slow
computer but
yeah this the pieces are floating and
just moving independent of each other
but they are solid pieces so they won't
like Bend or
anything maybe it should follow
um that
I don't
know hi po
girl nice to see
you some reason that's some sarcastic I
did not mean this is nice to see
okay I mean it so there we go that might
be a better to
follow whoa snow motion
animation can I the animation just
please because I'm
me yeah 24 FPS that's like the default
no it's
not now it's playing 15 and now I can't
hold the
15 I'm streaming in 15 at the moment
just to save
performance
yeah it's a robot
side close the side
P with a computer
forehead looks pretty good I
think other pieces are
solid following the body of course not
perfectly CU it's
right
yeah and then I will put a face on here
too hi hi
hello oh look I got a transparent piece
of glass in front of the screen very
hard to see but yeah this is shininess
this is a piece of glass this is not the
strap thing on inside
so
now see so now glass is here and the
screen is
there
[Music]
W kind
know should I make next part
what is next part I should
[Music]
make let's
see
[Music]
is just solid nothing here how are they
floating I don't know magic or
[Music]
something now to make the
pet and here's what I like it's it's a
large lump of
metal
metal and
uh and then leg
Lego I would assume this is solid piece
[Music]
but but that might just be where it has
to need need some bending going on which
might
[Music]
weird
it fits on here
okay bikini I
guess
[Music]
so how many pieces is this one
um
no
that's
CLE 12
sides so p is
nice and
round okay so
I thank
you
amate
like not see an
amate no it does
where
another I'm very
confused I me this is exist when I come
see
not sure what's going on at the
[Music]
moment so the feet are going to be
like a solid piece
of and
my
oh they mean to sending me a simar coin
[Music]
oh the P has Ed
process oh
my it is
happening the son of a corn is on its
[Music]
way okay
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
interesting
[Music]
they are getting winded
[Music]
welome let's take care of
[Music]
that
[Music]
making this a b chicken and
I
[Music]
n
[Music]
H okay not exactly what I wanted I
[Music]
mean okay and worked
[Music]
out
so too
much all legs
yep to much much she
said
[Music]
yeah I mean it looks better in a drawing
than I what I can
do not exactly getting the shape right
I'm noting it's just too
[Music]
[Music]
t maybe that's B
[Music]
I need to be like
[Music]
that that's that's not
[Music]
great
[Music]
[Music]
and
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
[Music]
o
[Music]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
there be that's wi
[Music]
is
[Music]
actually going
to do
this
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I can't pressing
CT
[Music]
[Music]
but it does also show that the
as it goes
[Music]
down like the
[Music]
larous
so maybe
it's small P something like
[Music]
[Music]
that well here's
the
[Music]
so
[Music]
[Music]
well here's the Sleep Shop's
answer
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
that's
right
now
this should be split
[Music]
somewhere
[Music]
look like
anyway well I guess guess it
[Music]
does even as a robot one com
show
po p
every no no it's fine like
that
watch and they should
be on
[Music]
this there we
[Music]
go look FY doesn't
[Music]
it
[Music]
I can s
this
no
ni why doesn't why doesn't they need
this oh I
see but for some reason need one
there
no there's another one
here no okay
[Music]
go
[Music]
[Music]
there we
go
[Music]
about
[Music]
this
[Music]
next
t
[Music]
[Music]
no don't look at F and robot on the
way
that's really cool
cool Okay this not one
somewhere it's messing with me not
there
this what's come
[Music]
now let me disappeared
[Music]
problem is that
this need to animated and I really wish
the Armature would show
[Music]
up
the hide option is
not
oh
yeah I'm very confused in the
[Music]
moment like it says that it has bones
and joints s don't show moment so
weird
[Music]
Shing shaking yeah I'm B confusing
mod
If someone knows how blending
works for they can accepting
help as this is very way to
me
cuz it would help I mean
show
it's but
still
[Music]
C so I can make it like
that this but a
[Music]
SP
so
[Music]
w
robot
underwe
yep yeah I'm so confused in moment
because I I just I I I don't know I
don't know where the armatur is is
really really prevents me from Maring at
moment
cuz this in the this one works something
happen that
broke I just don't know what it
is still exist it's
ni
[Music]
I can put another
one I not sure what that one isn't
showing it's like gold this one show
this do have different things going on
here
though
pH
[Music]
okay
I think I can see some yeah
[Music]
[Music]
but
[Music]
[Music]
I guess it should
[Music]
be side left or
something fire
left
why I'm getting confused what this is
that why isn't just side left you should
that should exist
St left
apparently that doesn't
exist
[Music]
weird that's
weird go now this one isn't following
the the other
arure try had to load because the other
one didn't want to show up for some
reason
[Music]
problems and this is car which I assume
is the lower half that's the other one I
guess so car
left guess St doesn't exist as
B
iron left
not maybe they do just that no it just
don't exist so
weird so
[Music]
weird
[Music]
no
[Music]
and beh half of
[Music]
those this quarter of that and half of
[Music]
that I
me
complet three ques on one
qu cuz now when I rotate this
bone I guess it's what's going
[Music]
On's oh
[Music]
w
[Music]
looks like I forgot to set
that there we go that's more like
[Music]
it now I can
bend
of course you cannot get that that would
make too much sense with B but I
[Music]
mean I don't know how I would do
this does food exist oh yeah it does
something that exist
here
[Music]
now would come in
[Music]
W
[Music]
so switch back this to the other
one
whoa
of course now
they now the pieces bends and
[Music]
stuff what else I supposed to
[Music]
do
[Music]
there you
[Music]
go
[Music]
wrapped let's wave it
[Music]
up
[Music]
so Let's Straighten these P
[Music]
up I think that should on R mode try to
make pieces straight instead of
[Music]
rotate have an arm it's trying to be
more efficient with how to place
everything but I'm like an unwrap mode
that's
like less efficient less smart and
just make the pieza more
accurate how what it should look
like
[Music]
[Music]
like
that
like this
much but I don't think this anything
else I'm going to add the arms but what
else is to add the
[Music]
[Music]
bow
[Music]
what
[Music]
one one didn't come
[Music]
alone
[Music]
[Music]
excuse me
I we got
some sherro
[Music]
oh no
[Music]
o
o it I did my best I hope you phon are
well hello bread bun bun oh bun bun are
you a bunny made of bread
what is bun as a reference to it being
bread and nothing with bunnies because
I'm a bunnies you know I got bunnies on
my
head hey hey I really some with Shi
that's refreshing well um I'm not
familiar with try I couldn't even
determine what
the SCP I was recognizing the script but
I can't remember
was
so but I gave with this best my
best I hope
[Music]
you you could see I was cheating
at
anyway I I hope you are having a good
time while I'm making a robot
[Music]
here
so how did you find me
should I called you bread or bun buan
maybe call you ban ban might be a bit
confusing with Bon I mean depending on
how people pronounce it you know and so
Brett your name is
Brett yeah he here's here's the robot
and I guess you could say this is a
robot but I
mean what leg that moment and then I
will do the
arms move over here to the picture oh so
bright maybe I should turn on the light
again cuz I said it's close getting
closer
to and I don't I do have natural light
com in but amount of natural light is
slowly lowering
dwindling
[Music]
[Music]
robots pon pon is striking a
[Music]
[Music]
PS
so
so your first attempt of is actually
correct there not in all place is more
common in
the dialect and I just found you by
recommendation yeah yeah I could
imagine dial differences
course didn't even consider
that uh but yes I'm
[Music]
happy I'm happy I got got
[Music]
it in some in some
way did my
[Music]
best
[Music]
so
[Music]
some reason I want to remember
oio oio from
something and I can't I
like I don't really have
any con connections to sh okay but maybe
whatever was using it used
[Music]
there or something completely different
this I'm worried on another language
that happens to be
[Music]
[Music]
same
[Music]
[Music]
I mean this part should be the dark
green part the metal
part oh wait I
oh I oh I see I
see and now that I looking more into
H there are a few ways of saying that
word
oio
that's all of the ones I could find
pration might not have been perfect
but
yeah so this one should
be do I have
a is there any outfit with well in this
case Coco because I have extracted all
outfits with Coco Not Crash isely Coco
that contains like metal in that ve but
is wrong robot let me check out the
[Music]
robot and Coco
skins
robot and then I open the robot
here yeah here's like robot
gray let's take this
part
oh it's
like
100 there we go like that
[Music]
color
[Music]
[Music]
oh
so
there
yeah and so
I I miss you second minut got stuck on
your first by the way I hope you things
are going wellday m is very cute so far
I'm I'm glad you find that model to be
cute I
like I like cute
things which is why I'm a bunny bunnies
are naturally very
[Music]
cute
so I hope my good funny
I don't know cherro but I do know
it's I don't know how to even read
that
yeah
yeah e
a
so this will be in my
[Music]
to
[Music]
so and we save
this and then to go
[Music]
here one there go we can see that I have
the wrong
set there we
go so the Fe being this shiny might be
not the correct
and so the next
part
is to check the oops metallic value of
them so we go back oh I don't go back
here and check what metallic value is
used
here one it's kind of high
66
so sing
that then I should check the roughness
[Music]
value and I assume this is going to be
more rough
than
interesting different roughness
mes I mean that's still a great languish
to i'
say it's it's is
interesting this is
76 maybe I try some six first
because it's less rough than the rest of
the body which is what man
is
okay so metallic updates changes value
there
roughness more
rough is it how I imagine it I don't
know
quite shiny
still let
me let me
try a different roughness
menu and and up it there you go maybe
that's more more like
it a scene
here nahu is certainly a bit easier to
learn thanks to the abundance of
speakers and teams yeah definitely when
it comes to language learning there is
many reasons outside of when people talk
when people talk about the difficulty of
learning a language they seem to only
focus on like like grammar and stuff but
there's so many other factors that DET
difficulty of learning a language as are
I would say I could say they would have
a big effect but it could
have
thanks and that
includes the the options you have when
when it comes to learning
language oh a new
follow hello you like you like me talk
about langes
that
is oh my that is my
thing
stop it's
contining and that
includes yeah how available is the
language for you to learn in the first
place are there Tools
around all the speak
around it's certainly an IND interestly
I like
it and for the tools and stuff available
how good are they for example if you're
doing a a du lingual course for dualingo
is a very easy and accessible tool to
use to learn a language which I'm not
saying it's good I'm not saying it's the
best but it's an easy way to Le like to
get going with like H if you just
curious about language you can still
learn it through
your
and if the language is on du linguage
certainly it is just another to you can
use NAU is on gingo but cherro is not if
I remember correctly so that's a that's
one
difference are others to too of course
unfortunately course is severely limited
yes that's the next thing some are
limited some are
terrible H some are like if you're
learning Spanish or French those are
well developed German is quite well
developed but other languages are
terrible it depends Swedish isn't that
bad but there are some languages that
are
terrible and
so and that's just that's just one
aspect of learning langu
language there are other aspects
too pish is supposedly one of the
hardest languages that yeah but I don't
like the term hardest
languages but it really depends on what
your perspective
is and when people are talking about
hardest languages always show the same
thing it is the the it is the research
done for how long they they educate us
diplomats in a language before can speak
it well enough um and that's
specifically used diplomats not that it
would change from
like uh other English speaking countries
but it's for English
speakers if you have someone speaking a
language that is has more in common with
finish it certainly would be
easier reality Ro supposedly I guess
there's that it is very certain not see
it all especially for awareness
yeah definitely at Le
something know that just wish to where
spoken phrases to help me with yeah that
definitely would have wish should lack a
lot of
pronunciation H isn't the language
quite straightforward with it spelling
so this shouldn't be too hard to add
pronunciation to
diary and
uh so
Japanese so it's Japanese for
here
well so the actual difficulty of
learning language the first step is the
tools
available as we established so
far and the next
thing is your own
motivation if you don't want to learn
the language or if you want if you
you're not interested in learning it is
it's going to be very difficult to learn
language like how Swedish is a an
obligatory language to learn in
Finland which I don't feel is very
necessary
H but since SP usually don't care they
don't really learn it and that well at
least and so that's it doesn't mean that
Swedish is harder to learn in
English it just means
that it's really your motivation really
makes
difference it is there but it's very
hard to
see
hardest part of learning a language is
actually motivation sure yeah it could
be the hardest language in the world but
so long as you're passionate about it
you probably not going to find it to too
just interesting they are certainly
harder language you can probably make
languages objectively harder
for factors I would say would be
uh IR irregularities
and
uh and what was the and larger uh like
less use search of
uh the same words in for example
compounds and such or using the same
word with with multiple meanings that
you have to learn many more different
words
je is pretty much waste of
time so I would
say um that would make the language
objectively harder to
learn but if a language has a lot of uh
cases like in finish I wouldn't say
that's objectively harder that's just a
different way of approaching
grammar but if the way the words
but if the way the words inflect for the
different cases is in a in irregular
way then then you introduce irregularity
making the language harder but it's not
the cases that makes it
harder you know I find the nor langues
are fny buch there are interesting
aspects of the nor
languages one interesting aspect I find
find about the Norse Norse languages is
how def form is a
suffix because the other Germanic
languages or most of them uh as well as
Romans languages the definite is an
article that goes before
everything
but but not the Norse
languages in this cases is a suffix that
goes at the
end
and then point is quite easy my wish was
my grand F that wanted Rec my Heritage
yeah I would say that you approv that
languages aren't really hard or
easy it it really like even if you try I
mean even if you would say polish is
objectively harder or harder for an
English speaker to learn in general even
if you use either of cases it really is
the motivation that is the most the
biggest Factor here and another example
I like to use is that H one of the
complaints usually English speakers have
about um a lot of other languages is uh
the uses of gender usually sometimes
completely incorrect reasoning
but but still I could see that as a case
for being annoyed by the language but if
you are very strongly against this
aspect of a language it's going to be
harder to learn
language
so yeah but motivation start problem
with learning everything it's kind of
unnecessary to say I wouldn't say
that I think it's
necessary especially when people talk
about U like learning languages in
general we kind of
like motivation the Le being
factor and shouldn't be ignored if if
you're going to talk about how how hard
something is that I think you should
still
imtion object
[Music]
motivation I think that's but that's my
opinion for this is said to be the most
difficult slav language to learn even
all the slab are learning and Slavic
language in general said to be very
difficult to learn come from a
non-slavic language as
English
one I I guess you can make
like
uh like for an English speaker you can
do some kind of research of how
difficult it some languages becomes
[Music]
also motivation is kind of definitely
subjective I
mean I'm not sure what you mean by
that or here said English fact you might
not know did you know that English
actually has a broad language I don't
sure I don't know what a broad language
is
I'm
not that experience with brother
language yeah someone else doesn't know
what the brother language is 1 2 3 4 6 7
9 10 12 13 why is
13 I got to ignore that and make it
20 that language is going to go grown up
alongside from a recent common ancestor
language
oh oh like like a lot of languages have
uh but you usually don't find that with
English so English doesn't really
have there's no like common wellknown
languages for English that
are like mutually
intelligible and
like a lot of other
languages I assume that's the topic
here there is one yes uh which is what
you just talking
about he like Swedish and norian or
polish andian or
asan
he Spanish and French like that being
Scots a language of Scotland which
depending on who you El either came out
from northan Old English or nor the
dialect of Middle
English yeah heard about
squs not confus with Scottish English of
course it's
uh trying to figure out
her
[Music]
[Music]
there's like bait among where is
and language I mean I
think I think Linguistics has already
aren't debating about
that because in linguistics there's a
synal dialectal continum so if you the
way even classifying Lang things as a
languages or dialects isn't
really you can't really do
that the only
H because
uh the uh Serbian and catian are
considered separate languages because
they are separate countries and they're
claiming their own language as their own
language while in China you have a lot
of and dialects that are speaking spoken
so different from each other that they
can't even understand each other but
they are considered dialects because
China has said so so what is considered
language is
politics so I'm not
sure so you can't really put any
linguistic reason for why iing is a
language or not it's all politics it's
not all politics but the reason why Pol
and I was assume the the same thing
reason why polish is a language is
because Poland exists as a country the
reason why salesian
salesian isn't the language because
salesia isn't a country or kashubia
isn't a country idid but if they were
the likelihood that those would be
consider considered languages by people
it would be much
High Scots actually comes up in s
languages yish I mean
yish yeah is because the term language
has yeah so I wouldn't say linguists are
debating that because it's not
really
linguistically I mean you can create a
St for example to speakers of
this need to understand it and no
because you as mentioned you have the
you have
the dialectal continum you can have one
speaker who understands another speaker
who understands a third speaker but a
third speaker do not understand the
first speaker and now we have a
paradox
[Music]
yeah I understand this Evolution and
everything that happen so show
yeah yeah there we go which country is
Catalan spoken H in the Catalan country
it's spoken in
Spain but I'm not saying that every
language
and that is cons that is commonly
considered language has its own country
but the main reason why you have a
difference between country between
languages and and dialects is is those
that are considered languages often have
their own
country and that
does but Cataline is I
presume
so much different
from uh
Spanish I don't know I mean I I'm not C
Spanish speaking
so it also can there's the but but also
another is I just forgot to
mention
uh yeah looking just looking at this
table and calan is quite different from
Spanish in certain certain
ways uh but and it doesn't really need
to be its own country it could be a
smaller like
Catalan is it's is a what was it called
autonomous region within Spain and they
recognize Catalan as its own language
and uh there you go political reason
again
and so unless I guess
uh salesia is H cesia is that a region
by the
way vus
Salia
Salia
Sila so many options there's no Standard
English way pronouncing
it it's a historical region it's not
even a region
nowadays well that could explain why
it's not really commonly
considered like if it's a language or
not if
sinia was or
shilia was a country or no no an
official region with in Poland or
something it's mainly
Poland and they had official that that
as their official language it come yeah
yeah
yeah this is going into a lot of details
now and one other common distinguishing
between langages whether or not each
separate language does actually have
their own literary form different from
another yeah yeah yeah that's true
that's part of the reason the nor
language are considered different not
entire
reason for sure well I think you could
have come up with a better example
because the north languages are
different because they're different
countries but I mean that that like not
the reason but that's our reason H is
there a I think that
that's
um I need a better example that within
the same country I mean still a fair
reason if you have different
organization that standardizes the
spelling and writing form of their
own language let's say call it that H it
would be usually consider
language yeah but if there isn't one for
example when it comes to all the way
spoken in German me I like take by
Bavarian for example I was speaking to
someone who spoke Bavarian there is no
standard form of writing it they just
write German but they but they permanent
pronounce it in
bararan therefore it's not really
considered a language so that's a good
point cian and K Shuan both have their
own alphabet separate from polish
well I guess they might have a standard
I spaming
maybe and therefore could be
considered by that
reason well apparently they had two
different sty ways of SP spelling maybe
there's
[Music]
like
the St sters
alphabet and the
slab slabic
[Music]
cor but then the question is people who
actually
speak H this way do they actually write
it that way or do they just write polish
but speak that way like they do in
[Music]
Germany but just look comparing wor some
the wor are quite difference I could see
why you could consider language yeah and
that's fine I could see I could
consider I the one
designing but yeah I it is listed on
Wikipedia's language not that Wikipedia
is the one that but yeah with its own
alphabet its own like
spelling to did they check I want to
check [ __ ] by the way did they have
uh language back
and do they have any form
of doesn't it doesn't right here that
they have
any organization that makes official
spelling
or because that does
help while writing a language according
to your own dialect can become a
standard some way that's the case that's
got right now when that is high there is
much Scotland should go independent just
so they can make
scoty I I mean they
K like I
mean then just like Scotland do they
consider official languages English
Scots Scottish G British sign Nam okay
so they con just got official namage
there
then on off
[Music]
in
[Music]
but this was
[Music]
interesting
so maybe I should just copy with the
finger here
for interesting
conversation
[Music]
yeah it is interesting I like talking
about
[Music]
languages
I TR once uh when someone said
that the
uh Romani ways of speaking let's use
that vague phrase here are separate
languages not a
dial and
uh I I try to say something like like if
it's a language not that's doesn't
really
like
it's it's mostly politics
like they usually consider separate
languages when they are official
languages of different
countries but try to be different
regions and like
that and then the person said but there
is but uh Romania doesn't have its own
country yeah
exactly that's kind of that's kind of
what has a factor in the whole
thing but yeah organizations
standardized sp there go course kind of
need
the the right thing how simply how far
the sounds can shift between St like
normally makes
the
unvoiced
sound but in one very popess dialect
makes the freaking F sound so like
having
the W H represent that would be
OD I mean some write p h and it makes an
F sound so I W to make an F sound I
mean you can have like oh W makes
the wh Makes the UN voice W sound
Buton what's an on voice W
sound is that the difference between W
without H and W with h
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and so I'm just not seeing I'm see if I
can get his hands working
here there's a difference
not in most Vish but story was the
difference
between which and when which and
wi which and witch and
witch sound like
witch which and
witch now sound like an emphasis
difference oh
well okay so I don't just like I said
it's not the one that's why they have
different
spellings so are you saying that um in
the Scot dialect that would the one
would be witch and the second would be
pitch
and I think this yeah yeah and I I don't
see the issue with just spelling it that
still wh make an F sound in that dialect
but makes a w sound in other Scots
dialects and that's the one reason for
spelling wh because it makes both
sense and that's a way to make unified
spelling that takes other dialects into
account
which
sure they could spell it with f instead
of w but then the other Scots dialect
should not spell it with either they
should spell without AG I mean if that's
the
I mean to be
honest SC didn't take Engish spelling on
in Mass because Eng spelling is C yes
yes I mean definitely if you spell it
more fanatically how you speak it it's
so much
better
and when I suggest a very simple
spelling change that doesn't affect a
lot of people but sh will make spelling
a bit more consistent like how about
every time it makes an F sound you just
spell it with an
F that's how do it in Swedish the word
photo but in Swedish is pronounced photo
but still it's the same word it's
spelled almost the same it's just that
it's spelled with an F instead no with
an
f and there you go very easy and if
someone were to
spell it like that and you would read it
out in English you would read as photo
so and you can just see the pH little
fancy
spell just like how can it does
he wait now CLA complain much
man like you can spend hiccup this
way but people decided some people
decided now we shouldn't spell it that
way and and I in the same reason I think
photo should also
change like hiup makes
a makes a p sound at end so why not
spell
p and that's my same reason I have I
know course of
[Music]
course I'm glad the only an American who
spy thank God for Mar web but you don't
spell photo with a f are
you you hypocrite
come
see but you most likely
not at least we made it slightly better
[Music]
now
overall it's just it's your bad in a
different
way Engish spelling is bad overall
and like oh we have like this bring up
you have the O Ur ending you're like oh
we remove the
U okay fine fine it has the unvoiced no
not unvoiced it's a what's it called the
schw sound follow with r at the end
there and sure sure but then you have
the same spelling same vow sound that o
but that one oh
that's I don't know if bread buns bread
bun bun if bread have have or
not so so so
so
tough thorough
s so
there we
go think it makes more sense like in
context to read those words like I
isolated I'm not as good with those
[Music]
words so I don't know I was talking to
friend so I guess I have to
wait so yeah that's my
reasoning you go to change oh you are
say
one like where was
the there they are wrong
button yeah should they are these I I
think I think
guessing
edges yeah this place is more longer
segments than a
s oh yeah I need to add
the
go
fact okay maybe I don't have
it I don't know you have to tell me you
have no indication of
that if you're subscribed or to have
turo it was short it was supposed to be
3 minutes but maybe it was enough yeah
so as I think good good good hello
welcome back okay good to know that you
have
uh so yeah yeah I message and so was
saying that the O is ending there with
the thew sound for the vowel which say
the o r in American spelling which I'm
fine with but then you have the OU like
the ID I'm fine with and then you have
the OU s ending which has the same um
vowel sound but with a different
consonant at the end but that one is not
changed so that creates an
inconsistency
which I mean yeah sure BR British
spelling has
inconsistencies American spelling has
other inconsistencies and then share a
bunch of inconsistencies and
it's like for
example uh
and the word defense was
changed uh because of some reason why I
don't
know H for pronunciation resen sure if
that's the case well in that case you
should also change the spelling
of H this
word because it's the same sound it's
the is the same series of letters and
that just adds an inconsistency that's
just which are find
silly but yeah that's why I can't say
that American spelling is better some
things are easier to
spell and
then I'm not going to say Bri good ide
people whatever they
want so
anyway fun fact the reason that oh you
in English makes the sound it does in
words like house is because hisor that
was the ooh sound in
book and that's how you wrote the ooh
sound in French I yeah that makes
sense who's
otherwise I thought it was like from
German
house oh did I miss this
one
apparently oh no I need something wrong
here no I need to go back I
need I removed the wrong
line anytime
now there you
go
yeah that one should be removed but
maybe that's one that's the one I should
keep yeah because that's 2 two two
three one three yeah
that's now it's correct good thing I
notice
that
defense defense remove
offense
main oh it was
offense
I guess I said defense and not
defense you're you're right about that
but then you need a way to spell the
difference between the and
the
defense
defense yeah yeah yeah here we go
no I've heard the argument that the
reason why people should spell it pH in
photo is because it comes from Greek
which by the way does not spell pH for
photo they spell f for photo anyway
hello yeah no I mean yeah whatever they
don't have pH they have
F anyway um but then spelling defense
which and which with an S even though it
comes from fence which is spelled with a
c so yeah offense yeah there we go
off
offense offense there we
[Music]
offense
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
these hands is going to be
tricky but that would be pronounced
offense wait what would that pronounce
offense it it has an S at the end
shouldn't be unvoiced
offense oh no wait you're you're talking
about jet
spelling yeah can have the spelling
of no I mean you sp it my way but you
added a different and
how so now you confus me because that's
not how English works as far as got it
is cats but dogs and that's because now
I'm us meing yeah
yeah I get that because the e at the end
makes the S yeah so unvocalized
[Music]
okay I I think it's called voiced and
not vocalized but I could be wrong H you
mean voiced or voed
um un voice this the S sound voice this
the
sound yes so you meant
spelling is that you wrote it with two
FS that's i s you in my spelling and the
s in C is on un voiced because T is a
yeah exactly and
so therefore my spinning should be the
one that should use offense
[Music]
offense to figure out how to do these
fingers and I'm getting confused and the
sum too where where is the main like
joint in the
S I guess it's still stream so I can
remove
like
things
[Music]
think yeah this seems to be the
case
there you
go but then is voiced oh wait yeah
you're right and it's
Mo voice if not the E which wait does e
silence the
moistness
I guess you have to spell
it
um
well I
guess I have I have the spending
then
offense there we
go because the the French letter C with
the hook makes the letter sound the S
sound no shop is run out so so yeah you
meant you meant my spelling name I just
forgot about the whole what the r
English that was
like he makes it un
moist I really thought about
that oh you could argue that from that
case you shouldn't talk about I mean or
like come up with spelling spish that's
why I'm trying
to I don't know I don't know what I'm
talking
about I mean it's not like I'm going to
make a change I'm just
talking oh no it's soft out distance
between those I don't want
that I do
individual no it does not do
that I have to soften them one by
one why is there is there soft sof does
not anyone
know is there a sof mode where I can do
like soften this keep
[Music]
volume oh it still still want do
that yeah so
yeah
[Music]
[Music]
okay I'm actually not sure I should do
the hand I kind of kind of stump at the
moment because I mean as I said the
drwing is quite a simplified version of
what the outf you look
like so
uh how exactly the hands connect like
how the fingers works and such not the E
to tell
[Music]
here
so I appreciate dra that
it's a k drawing
still this defin this is definitely hand
shap not wait what
does what does the robot Coco hands
looks
like I had some extra SES there they are
actually segmented in different parts
[Music]
but okay let
me
moment a liquid and
then if I import
the robot
C I
understand let's
see Coco
skins
robot
what
why
specifically robots
missing
weird
but
it's not
here there I'm not really sure what's
going
on okay so the specific musle I need is
G for some
reason
[Music]
[Music]
so
remember which one I have to locate to
the
[Music]
[Music]
next
this yeah this was definitely not
planned B more prepared
but Lins okay characters
player
loo content
Mees
SK Xbox
[Music]
go now it should appear
[Music]
here
yep
let's put it in this designated
folder I find it in the
future there we
go
boom no pictures but that doesn't matter
this is what hand looks
like so it's
actually Sly and this robot also got
floating
Parts I wanted that was the
inspiration SW
CH
up I was so busy looking for this same
Mall
hello
spetti activate that's is quite tiny
stinky cheese bones no I mean it's it's
a robot wow howdy
hello swey sweee how's it
going nice to see you more people here
always nice to seeing you people you
might not be a new person you might have
been around here for a long time time
but I do check now but you guys want
come
anyway
so yeah this is how they do the fingers
so the joints with here thinking about
maybe potentially using some
like but yeah this is what the hand
looks
like chunk of
chees sticky
cheese I like every now and then how cu
the money
yeah sometimes I like someone right the
first time and then they actually been
here for quite a while but I appreciate
you stucking up in the chat revealing
yourself e the morning
is going to go better I guess um I strug
that bit with a hand here as it's
supposed to be like a robot hand and
I'll like organic hand but is very
organic hand at the moment like the rest
of the model at the moment it does not
belong
here okay what do
youan yes I mean sure I could do
[Music]
that that's why
do like
[Music]
this
but I like hi this part keep this like
that more come back
oh you find one that the
[Music]
glasses let's let's ask twitch to let uh
the emotes uploader choose the position
of the
glasses also the left facing right
facing or so
[Music]
on the only useful one is the one that's
the
direction there
[Music]
go it's
[Music]
uh that' be nice being able
to point yeah and if they don't want to
like allow the user to set it because
you would expect the position to be the
same for everyone you can have the emote
uploaded just adjust the to positions as
up some
something and of course being able to
flip every emote that you have available
not just the one not just the tier one
emotes which is a bit
[Music]
silly what are you
doing what are you doing with that
[Music]
hand
[Music]
anyway and like yeah yeah so I come back
hand like
that but I don't
think it it's
good so
see the easy of
course a very simple way of doing a hand
sure is not looking
good
it
[Music]
maybe unless the fingers are like
supposed to float as well cuz everything
else is
[Music]
floating cuz I can't just remember this
part and that wind float in front of
the front of the
[Music]
hand that's not what artwork say but we
can make
changes since artwork is more like an
idea
yeah more specific
same which to mentioned
[Music]
tep oh
yeah we get
it
[Music]
follow H you followed some sometime is
moding tough it really depends on what
you want to
mod if you
model texture replacement and sound
replacement really H depends on how
everything's coded in the game of course
are the easier
ones of course when it comes to like
voice acting you actually need someone
can voice or
like
and what and what in it you want
to what what you want one what do you
want one yeah are you are you interested
ining
a I start the
why ask H model replacement is car a lot
of work of course and of course you if
you're going to make something breath
you also need more on top of that on
hats shouldn't be too hard I think that
should actually be yeah if you just want
to add a hat to
ca yeah if it's an unreal game it's very
easy to mod there are a lot of tools for
that
of course if you're making some adding
some new stuff to it you have
[Music]
to
um if you're adding something new to the
mod there that us needs its own textur
so you need to P Textures in
one
and when you do add this kind of stuff
and when you want to add new textures to
your model there are few things you need
to take into consideration depending
which game it
is it um it could be interesting to know
even for even if someone here isn't
going to mod we're talking about mods
now interesting fact and when it comes
to spiral re night trilogy and and crash
four because the material holds the
texture and what you call a
material each of these polygons can hold
one material there are probably cases
where you can do multiple materials but
for the sake of easy to do modding they
can hold one material and one material
can display one
texture they can display more textures
too but for the sake of Simplicity they
can only display more TT
and
so that
means that if you want a separate
texture a completely new texture you
have to make it a separate
material which I will do for the screen
here I will make this so the glass here
is
actually is a layer of glass in front me
okay the glass will be uh separate
a material because that would be same
material as use
for visor and stuff in Crash
for and then there are two layers here
there's a there's one of this black
behind look very carefully here you can
see that there are
two SL is separated to avoid any
flickering or something think the back
one will be part of the actual uh base
material is for whole body if the one in
front is going to be a separate material
and I'm making it a separate material so
that it can display um a face that will
be
animated that reminds me of C
from
maybe I can see what you
mean
that
sounds yeah the face is not going to be
animated to anything that happens it's
just going to be I have an animation
that's it keeps going well it's fine
enough maybe I should just maybe the
fingers should float if I do
like you
know I don't know the feets are not
floating but a lot of other stuff are
floating like
I don't know it's an easy way of doing
it in case but I don't know if it's
good so as I was going to so with that
information both spy spire reignited and
crash
4 um they have one base material for the
whole body and then they have other
materials too in special
cases if um but you have to use the same
texture as for for example for Spice
body that is the same material the same
texture if you want your sing you're
adding like a hat to for specifically in
case of spiral to change texture based
on the power up being used if you go if
you're using a separate material for
your hat which allows you to use a
separate
texture and your hat is not going to
change based on power
up due to optimization reason one
material is best to most due to how the
game works you can only use like one but
problem is of course that the spal body
texture is using up the whole texture so
you need to leave space for the hand in
some way one way of doing that is for
example the two horns are separate you
can make the two horns used the exact
same material the same part of the
texture making the other horn free space
for your
hat and then you can have your head
change appearance like texture based on
power in production I'm studying at
maybe can teach me
[Music]
something and
but it is fine to use a separate
material for your hat if you I'm using
your hat as an example here
always so um
yeah and for crash
4 there is why you probably want to use
the same
material as for the body is because when
you die with the angel
effect uh the angel will will only apply
to the body material every other
material will be turn
invisible in invisible yeah so if your
hat is a separate material the Hat will
disappear
and when it comes to the crash 4 body
textures those are very annoying to try
to add something new to and I've tried
and it takes a lot of work to freak out
space What
where technically in game like crash or
SP this day would be
F
from yeah but I mostly speaking about
moding in the case in case of modding in
in
spal if you want it to change based on
power up you have to use the same
material and texture as Spice body and
in Crash 4 if you want the angel effect
to happen to your s you add you must use
the same body matal and texture as the
body is
using
yeah so yeah that's based
[Music]
on unless you like go to into the game
and modify texture but that's a lot of
[Music]
work isn't it wild that in the '90s a
game being developed for year was
consider couldn't the game develop for
yes most consider the development
nowadays depending
on I'm I'm trying to think hasn't a case
for that or maybe it's just people being
patient it's unre engine right yes in
uh Spyro reignited and crash for are H
engine crash and S try is a custom
[Music]
engine and it's not to Spa when I
play it also caes me enough be able
to mod it which is a
[Music]
[Music]
sh I don't I don't know if this is a
good
[Music]
idea a game that being deved for 4 years
now is standard if not fast while re it
was considered development help because
games us want to
turn I guess I haven't yeah I haven't
most considered that
[Music]
nowadays can
I I was I was
up oh wait oh yeah that's
why the game maybe I should
actually
yeah I was
more followed game development more in
the
past nowadays I'm mostly playing retro
games on
stream for anyone new here I I do stream
games
to eh then adding hat with material to
change with the power should be
relatively
simply
for the developer yes but I'm not really
sure oh there's a SM option here but I'm
not really sure sure what you mean if
you meant like moding
wise cuz if you know how to do that I
would like to
know
[Music]
I'm not denying that thep the could
use like of course the same for C but of
course they should have multiple
materials switch over to the Eng
it's just that they decided to not
develop the game that way so now when
you're making mods you have to follow
the rooms St set up or change the game
code but I mean that's outside of what I
can
[Music]
do
I really don't like since epic
is don't
wait I really don't like and Legend
since epic is in my opinion trying to
make
one
oh
well but if they have done the game with
no it should be rela simply what do even
I mean if you are experienced with unre
engine and can help me because there are
some things I really need help with um
modding wise and if you are experienced
with that I would love love your help so
I can actually complete the mod that I'm
working on I'm getting I do get help for
someone else with this is mod but uh
he's quite
busy with work and stuff and is unable
to like help me much I do really
appreciate everything he has helped me
with so far and mod is almost
working
and and I respect all the time that he
takes all the times in needs of of
course but at the same time that doesn't
make them more complete obiously and but
of course that's why I'm not like
pressing to help me with the mod which
means that the mod is just not being
developed I have experience with unity
but I if you
want I mean I guess I could like show
you yeah I could send
you like how it's because it's because
the mod itself is set up in noes
and it
should like um so the mod is modifying
game
behavior and it shouldn't be too
much hopefully to follow one that's
[Music]
com it for would be
amazing it's a mod that I wanted to have
for such a long time and it's so close
to actually working just kid right now
[Music]
I'm yes
I guess you could say impatient but uh
yeah I'm really trying to so that's why
I'm afraid of even writing a
message to him about the mod
because I I'm afraid I'm just going to
come off with
impatient like I'm going to say the
wrong thing or
[Music]
something cuz I do want to be
respectful
since obviously his life's com for my
[Music]
mod especially since he has provided
with all the have for free so
far I don't really have the economy to
pay anyway
so this
my
and I wouldn't be surprised if other
people on the Discord server who would
be interested in the
mod could probably say what mod
is instead of keeping
something cuz it's not a secret
mod
uh there go that's
the there you go I'm not sure if that's
good but it's
something oh wait that's not how it's
supposed to
be there we
go take that one as
well
how did I I didn't like
that so this one
is like
that okay it doesn't look too good it's
working
but could have
better after a certain amount of time
it's no longer being patient I mean
I guess you're right but at the same
time I don't want to come up
as
nagging because I said he's doing it for
free and there's no no established
contract where anything
so and I also don't want him to like
drop the whole project as
well cuz I'm too
impatient
know H can you s my way on the to work
yeah yeah yeah I was thinking of doing
that
definitely I
appreciate definitely appreciate
it
uh although
the question then is I'm not sure guess
it technically isn't
required but if
help help I I said it that way help
because it is a mod for Spyro
reigned I'm not going to play I'm not
planning on starting a new mod for Scrat
4 until I'm done with
this
eh
so if you have fire reigned on your
computer that defly helps like testing
stuff I do see what I can do besides
screens yeah of course you take you you
prioritize your life first before
performing that's
that's and you definitely don't need res
for
anything and I don't oh
well well
well you might still be able to see
[Music]
something
H swingy which is dance
party we are
sing fun eating sugar and become a
hyperactive not so hyperactive on on
screenshot you to the frame rate but
definitely the
your
depending on if it's done with noes I
said it should be able to make the lad
yeah it's noes so that should
be oh there we go there's that there's
it I really need to fix the uh because
if you do the other way on if you put an
emote
first
like that and then you ping
someone h p or tag someone it does show
it does the replay thing on on screen
but it shows it up in
pink I need to fix that I made made it
myself but but the chassing
[Music]
and but is fishes are funny but I will
fix
them some fishes if you try to use emoji
so not emotes and there are some issues
with
[Music]
that so it's done with no I said it is
not I told you it's
not
[Music]
[Music]
oh look I think I recognize that
heart no not heart the flag on the heart
it's very very it's a very strong color
though there you go that's the not my
emote
but someone
[Music]
else okay there
was sing
error yeah I guess I'm not
the so clear spoken as I should have
been is this hand good I mean it's not
like an organic hand but I guess that's
not the
point so many
fingers
oh
W someone's
doing a very interesting
downstairs some
funny with the tongue oh
my oh
my I also have other nice noise in my
hand noises oh yeah
you you mean like people are making
noise in the background make it a bit
harder to
hear understandable
but understand I'm
Bond let's do the overs side UND side
something like that
actually don't
know actually don't know if that's a
good
win I'm doing
it I guess it's
one me
could merge the finish
together I actually don't need them to
be
[Music]
separate WT wait what's this that stand
for voice chat and two stream
[Music]
one time eat some chips
oh Reaper
chips might that be
it
are you watching other streams from
watching my stream oh
[Music]
no is perfectly
fine oh this is this is quickly becoming
a m of
[Music]
lines
[Music]
don't know I think
[Music]
so
[Music]
wait I could probably use do
[Music]
things
say this definitely
not yeah going too too
[Music]
Missy
[Music]
is that c
away when I got the M jum done
small
[Music]
Miss like spider
webs already got his fingers all
filed
chips they can't answer what type of
ships sells are
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
here's some hot
fries wait is said it now I'm getting
confused
I using chips to mean
fries I did buy some Carana cheese puff
oh right that's
cheese they could
be chips too
right of any kind of chips I you would
call
[Music]
[Music]
them the turn name
of War Thunder oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
that's right I should have remember
[Music]
that that makes sense
man I
I hope you send me some Carol Carolina
re
chips so I
can try
them
[Music]
going
[Music]
see the green
reaper there a green reaper is that what
that Reaper isn't
[Music]
green
of course you'll either like them or
think they're way too spicy I'll
probably think they're way too
spicy I should eat them on
[Music]
camera no promise
[Music]
then finally
oh then last Point left who fingers has
been merged into one no as soon as I'm
[Music]
done let's see let's just straighten it
out first
[Music]
okay seems one Str
[Music]
enough and you think jalapenos are
spices so wor about you trying
one nah it's fine it's
fine I I'll survive
[Music]
what can be
spicy youing our poor little
[Music]
onion I can't handle some
spiciness yeah I think I think feeding a
bunny some spices spices would may be
considered
abusive even though it would be
interesting to see what the reaction
would
be for science you
know I if it this for Science and actual
science it's actually okay to
do as why read watch Swit animal testing
is okay but
only if you're using a reasonable amount
of animals or
testing and I guess the testing has to
be really
too discover scale
2,000
1,500,000 so
and Pen are 2
kilos what was it SC is the name right
so it would
be
penos 2K
scin caner
pepper H Mar five
Mega
SC
boom there you go now now we Define it
as a unit with
prefixes now I Define the symbol let's
use the
symbol the S uh SC
because uh to make it more distinct so
not just the capital
S and this part now it should be Capal s
because it a name that it was a
[Music]
name I think it was by someone named
SC
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I'm going look a heart because
heing of course then there the
thumb and the
thumb I another [ __ ] I even taste the
spice from ban Peppers aren't even
[ __ ] that
face
now you need to increase the
spiciness I'm getting addicted to
spiciness I supposed to go
[Music]
there here is
some I
guess and then there's the
arm guess doesn't really need
[Music]
SP and then
[Music]
right
defitely
H this should
be
Ro wait where is it to
robot
Rob
[Music]
interesting that's
finey set the wrong number on
the how of them
[Music]
[Music]
this can be even smaller and then like
it there

big then this one need freaking some I
guess
[Music]

editor without the
launching after it's
[Music]
[Music]
been
[Music]
and not much
[Music]
coming I just want people sitting

[Music]
see yeah
and then just download
the
419
version I'll take pictures all right I
have to take my brother and his wife to
the airport they're going to Hawaii haw
I

ring of fire solar eclipse we getting on
the
for yeah this ring a fire solar clipse
this sounds interesting I'll take
picture and post them on the server for
anyone who wants to see
the oh no
spoilers what you post them for people
want who wants to see not post them for
people who don't want to
see I'm
considerate
same good
same so now I can know then new
one wait oh yeah yeah I did just didn't
see
PR
I'm and after
next um yes
that's solar eclipses total solar eclip
is like event but it happens in the
locations on
[Music]
on but everyone has a chance to see one
but if you can travel you can see one
basically every
[Music]
year when did I did that but I can do
this instead I'm bit
it plus to take okay I'm
losing
[Music]
HD remember to same should I have for
that I think I save quite often so don't
feel like I need it because I just
[Music]
saved I can see
again plus that program I want save this
one but of course it's good save when
you're own
too save early save
often yeah I try to have the the
problem I've
had mentally I guess is that I'm I want
to save
uh after being done with some thing but
of course if something breaks while I'm
doing the thing which has
happened crashes while I'm doing the
thing that's not so
great but
[Music]
um that's why I try
to try just ignore that I have to
complete the thing out same
[Music]
[Music]
anyway I meant that thing that can be
trick to
overcome there you go that's so much
better
okay I made a slight updates to
the
you and now they online good same
same good as coder it happens to me
often to same every day I modified that
from my Mot drink to drink what don't
drink never
drink
[Music]
dehydrate I never drink only
[Music]
dehydrate there we go
[Music]
this will be to Norm map
basic
[Music]
and but I do feel like I
should make those
grooves
R and
[Music]
deeper it show up
here might be it needs to be
deeper okay
[Music]
export see now is showing up
here
[Music]
[Music]
nice know they can call
[Music]
it yeah thing is on
exactly perfect but
G part should
actually Oop There go there we go there
we
go segmented fingers or
something it has that
here actually kind of in see this
time but I think maybe it should be
winding
yeah the great part should probably go
[Music]
out and that's not
[Music]
tring
so I should
[Music]
probably
[Music]
go down me
here I'm kind of surprised by your
response to my mot you don't want me to
drink water early
after of course not why would you drink
water if you drink water often you're
just going
to he
[Music]
often and you can't that
can't and if you drink early well
suddenly I get off of bed
[Music]
first I'm
SP open
second
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so go something I don't know maybe this
is good wonder if I should make it Point
[Music]
me yes you
are I'm silly I'm not
though I M on
[Music]
[Music]
games
[Music]
I don't know
that's a see kid
Bon I want to be a s kit
B I hope I'm successful
happent
and that's
noted to
be
hot oh yeah you do think p p is
hot which is
[Music]
fine I mean
I I can
understand
[Music]
nice
sing I what
means there you
go that's that's my best hand I
basically recreated the hand
part
[Music]
before it's not much different but I
don't know I didn't know if it was
necessary to thing but I did it and I
don't know how much different it
is of course now I just need to that
part
I have certain body types I think are
hot and P into on what what kind of body
type does p p
[Music]
have sexy body type I
[Music]
mean rabot
[Music]
hand I guess it's a rabot hand
[Music]
a hot one
apparently can't want from
[Music]
that well yeah yeah I guess that is
[Music]
true
[Music]
any hot one and if you really
[Music]
see get the get the p p FL she's
[Music]
hot yes she keeps you warm when you s
anything
[Music]
hey m m Focus
[Music]
marketing okay
now update
update update boom that looks
fine yeah
really I'm really thinking that these
lines are great
here here two should like be double
lines or maybe something like
that
I guess it depends on the
[Music]
temperature regardless of temperature
pon pon will try to keep you hot cuz
she's hot in more than
one how the heated
system so I
think is not up
[Music]
here there we
go
what did that keep
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
here
oh there you
go
[Music]
[Music]
get
[Music]
now it will be
flexible which of
course a bit weird
[Music]
but
I think anything think something like
this intersect B in that's perfectly
fine andway it
disappeared I no this this
one messing around
here there
go that something
good
we got the new follow
away
W kex is that how you want CeX
banjo hi hello
welcome hope you like the arch going on
here very
welcome happy to see people around here
unless you been Ling around quiet which
is perfectly fine
too I have an
O what is your
o
like animal
appearance
personality fun is basically my
personality feel free to
share information about your if you
like H can I send it to you
is I
mean if you want
to if like if you if you're on like if
youve sent it to someone on like Discord
I guess you could just uh send that link
by copy The
Source otherwi if you POS like Twitter
Instagram
Dart
[Music]
that's fun facts oh
hello and you prob being here is still
allow to say
hello fun fact here because to me I
imagine like I'm
sitting I'm sitting at my computer Maybe
talking to someone like hey text here
and then you come like you've been in
the room but then you come here and and
start talking which is perfectly fine
but that's why I like to say
hello anyway anyway fun fact there is a
group of languages in the Pacific
Northwest so that would
be the northwest of the Pacific Ocean
like those land masses
there mostly Canada H think
geographically uh all the stalish
languages not
station uh where some words can have no
vows at
all uh
which I think there are are some
languages that has that
for
certain functions but for what I've ass
they kind of merge together with the
next word as a prefix of some
sort H
anyway uh is one extreme case of a
language
called it's even somewhat
common but like it would happen
I've call on Twitter
oh
Twitter yeah
bar but I can take a
look
uh no B like no spoken or written no one
smoking because there are cases as I
said the
uh work there are languages where you
have words that just doesn't contain any
mounts
and which I think the Polish W or is the
like or something like
that in those
cases
uh
preposition
the not in position in on
Lo yeah just the
or I guess it just works as
H just merge this with the other words
or something like that because when
spoken you can merge the words
together if you take the
word s
[Music]
this
one then you can
say in and you
get chungle so it's a it's a separate
word which is only a single consonant
and no vowels but it's kind of but as
spoken so works as pref spoken but
hello
wait
chel are you from
[Music]
Netherlands H I know polish words but no
yeah a classic word
in V is this one which is
pronounced well as we almost large carot
that is a lot of it's a very nice card
very Mr Bubbles have a large carrot and
you large
carrot thank you for Shing a large
carrot now it's behind P's head P can
hide there it is very
tou we can find
this I mean to be F that is a very long
word
without
[Music]
y that's my best attempt at
it he had he had had in his possession
uh on SP
plants
yep it's sh is
there so I give with that it has quite a
Massy word without
[Music]
any bounce in
[Music]
it thank you for
following that's saying oh
oh where is this Windows been open there
you what a [ __ ] C good old poish
poly synthesis not Pol poly synthesis in
American language is letting a lot of
meaning in a single
word yeah
yeah there are
some but is quite the
impressive okay let's Mar
this impressive word
impressive okay let's see if I can make
these parts properly
animated and so this part controls oops
not that one that one controls arm and
that is upper arm
left okay so so this will
be
upper arm left uper
arm of course that one doesn't
exist and then
I
one
assign see and then it should this
should be three three
quter
[Music]
half and 1 qu and then the next part is
this one the lower arm which is lower
arm left what a Cy

wondering selected fold to status and
other yeah that I know but
[Music]
yeah why can't I there that's that's
[Music]

mods on time that actually might help
about it so I can sh it with
you that might be a good
here I am not s about that
[Music]
it would help yeah I can
[Music]
imagine so I I should do

last
okay watch better there that's a good
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
one
[Music]
I is near singing from in my
[Music]
opinion

[Music]
connect leanan doesn't say much just
here to redeem
redeems and then
Lees come see the stream
[Music]

I this
[Music]

[Music]
[Music]
h
[Music]
[Music]
then
same name the same
[Music]

please
[Music]
thean is hiding in the shadows
lurking waiting for the best moment to
strike on
unsuspecting
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
have doing
this and a get
It looks
interesting for
[Music]
sure oh you are hot bun bun put into
oven and bean
[Music]
B
baby that push you up to 150
[Music]
wo
only 850
more so
your bun bun
emot
yay thank
you very kind
of there that's the bun bun OT that's
what everyone wants
right
trying to see if I can do
[Music]
this it's crap
me
make the shape a bit more
[Music]
interesting but yeah that was that was a
surprise and I
said oh no
like I do want something connected
something that should happen
when you make a p to make it more
exciting that's
just this speak more
[Music]
often
[Music]
nothing I hope everyone has a good
time
[Music]
getting me S to
marus
I and then I just need to make sure it
works with the
s h
[Music]
maybe I should just do
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
that
[Music]
I case if this doesn't work out I have
the
back the back
[Music]
again
[Music]
[Music]
like
[Music]
things
[Music]
oh
[Music]
my I'm
going I'm doing a lot of sinking
[Music]
a lot up looking around the model and
thinking how I
should do
[Music]
this yeah definitely I I should have I
connect
okay
let's do
[Music]
this should probably connected to
one see that's that's what I had to do
[Music]
[Music]
that
so
and back
[Music]
here not
that okay now that I've done
this maybe I can
just
[Music]
something textures are going to be czy
[Music]
but yeah just need to figure out how
I do
different there's a nice
care I was see
[Music]
but
[Music]
[Music]
up maybe
[Music]
maybe
hands now just this these part not
really sure how I
[Music]
do um experiment around and see what
they can
find I can make it like one
day different now
second I should just make it more wider
overall
[Music]
and this old
[Music]
[Music]
part maybe that's not a bad
idea
it
is out of is kind of
[Music]
Bing
that might
[Music]
more let's see
here don't work that
work
okay
[Music]
kind of lost its shape a bit here
[Music]
but like this
SP
just think that's not this
is
one
[Music]
yeah
this
is it's starting to look
like
[Music]
[Music]
something
[Music]
try
[Music]
where's
[Music]
Shake okay now seeting St
[Music]
so oh yeah and then this is
[Music]
connected I would say
[Music]
this
and would be better in
PR it's definitely
bul but
[Music]
it's yeah see with the correct col
place
how
I this isn't than
me did I do this no I haven't done rest
that's
why that's
[Music]
funny
there that's
good when it comes to this
hand what thing
between
[Music]
so guess everything
here
everything here and
here a bon and the princess the bunny
princess probably something definitely
bunny
princess
[Music]
[Music]
somewhere
y
yep
so this one should not have the
hand and this one should not off the
[Music]
hand
okay it's not
perfect okay and
say this one is half the hand this one
is
quarter this one take three
quar which would make
the
more
what oh yeah this is very tight here
that's
[Music]
why
H yeah currently looks like this
mess
let's change
that
[Music]
wish
doong together
[Music]
okay uhoh that's why I find
it
and let
[Music]
see
[Music]
this up Mak TT easier especially like
this why like
this
attach a
[Music]
NE
[Music]
mhm
my stuff still
there
what is
that
oh and should be
here
soing
up every
piece hey I got plenty of space
here so problem is it if you said it but
is this a robot or yourself like a robot
I
mean I Haven never stated that because
I'm not sure it was necessary to state
that but I mean I mean in
[Music]
cas
oh now
I'm using this sport for too
long oh he f one of me that's um right
the his name manag to
[Music]
catch
[Music]
H I guess um that was
interesting

be able to use the account follow I
guess you
can check and follow us account I don't
know if the US question chat but
apparently
follow I'm
happy I just want to see what I usern
name FIFA would stream but apparently
something that's
that would twitch like Reser not Reser
but say
like
[Music]
yeah we're going to
Game On
Top we're going to give such usern names
to the
companies that have those names because
that just makes
sense and while some people will
argue
well first got it have it but
same time at is my community views can
go
[Music]
to I another account called Microsoft
and just it just being Microsoft account
that you
[Music]
know
[Music]
very if in opinion I'm
saying gu so robot or just the best
robot can't go either way so many
followers today yeah sure what's going
on here I'm appreciate every
follower so
[Music]
[Music]
um well I would assume it's just a robot
version of considering like holding gaps
and stuff he would p p wouldn't be able
to dress actually look like
[Music]
that will be kind of
impossible there that BL yeah I have
to I need to move that
line I also need to do come up something
for the connection between the hand and
the arm cuz I like I like the way it
looks
while in the rest position but animated
it's
right which isn't too great
like break here I need to come up
something for
that but this position is
fine now it does have l here I want the
line to be
here so what I would
[Music]
do
now there
go
[Music]
like
that
[Music]
there and with
that I know where to place the
line I have currently 260 followers and
that's amazing I'm getting very close to
my
goal like I want to achieve like a goal
is set to 300
but you
know I wouldn't mind like 17 more
followers that's a lot
though
200
7 like would be
[Music]
like and I'm happy
with I'm happy I'm happy for everyone
enjoying the
[Music]
content
change
[Music]
here
[Music]
like
that oh
sorry
H
uh with two screens I'm planning off on
off off and on with two screens during
uh
watch streams I was thinking of just
screen is
[Music]
having
uh screen yeah showing hold the whole
second screen where I only put whatever
I want to show
screen still not fully comfortable hit
you know in case something decides to
pop up on the second
screen that's a
problem
at least it will change the views for me
so I don't have to TW manually forget me
sometimes
yeah of that
yeah screen screen screen screen
screen yeah second screen
sometimes sometimes I do say the word
out boom so now this seems it's kind of
hard to
see yeah it's there that like I do like
the design better
now but just this part I guess I guess I
can
use
get one p
p guess I can just do like
[Music]
oops
[Music]
all
[Music]
right
[Music]
okay
train
okay do
that like
that
okay maybe I should just because I had
that
before
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
that's mess up the UI
but I mean UV not
UI
[Music]
I did
that this this
is
and
yeah it's
like good enough I
guess I could do that and
[Music]
then want to cheat on do
that
Che the means I didn't need to expand
below there
but
shiny I'm sorry I'm playing Red Dead
Redemption I'm driving a c and acent to
squish the
rabbit

f
[Music]
yeah
[Music]
I guess you need to make

[Music]
lines
[Music]
[Music]
I wonder it looks I
set like

[Music]
able it's
missing it
incorrectly missing
see
tomor
correctly poster check good
good there we go my posture has been
checked
looking get so far and only see a pi
okay like this
yeah unless there's a massive delay at
the moment which it might
[Music]
be cuz you can determine delay by how
long it takes for your message oops I WR
how long it takes for your message from
when you send your
message message and when it appears on
screen cuz when it appears on screen
that's when it techn has arrived at
me or
like that's the moment in history that
it arrives at
me give me give me give me give me no
delay that's good that's
good no no noticeable that's
good just just found it funny thing it
looks good after switch away
from because you use the timing of
it I mean
I like pineapple or pizza but I wouldn't
take like the whole thing and put it on
a pizza like that that's
[Music]
s there you that's that's OPP I
think
[Music]
yeah
there you go the timer is not up
[Music]
yet looking
pizza and I do want to show
like I do I do some some people have
like shoulders head maybe a bit more I
do wish to like show more of my
[Music]
moments I need show up most of
it and then I can have the uh end screen
have
like showing specifically for
that put in 3D btle that
[Music]
is
so yeah so now I have to fix
[Music]
this mixing over
here sing over
here yeah and
then this that one no long
[Music]
please
something them without detection it will
be shown in in large size not full size
though cuzz that wouldn't F four of them

here oh I didn't I forgot one
this there you
go floody
hell it
is our robot version
of going to be one of the available
outfits or crash for where pon pon is
going to be playable replacing
Coco I do have some normal you know I
don't think you seen like the normal P
Pon
the it doesn't have the texure
oh there go
now this one is that is it because
I not
nor I think it's cool how people make
their own name and
stuff I yeah I made some of my own
here's my
family was this supp
show oh no it's a bu
again I
[Music]
[Music]
it's okay show this this
part was like the
rest so
[Music]
weird oh I do have backups of these F
anyway so they are in The Other
Place guess I can't more
[Music]
annoying
honestly only just woke up
ah is it a good time for you to wake
up are you waking up in time
like that feeling that you're working up
at a good
time see that's good I'm working on that
myself so the model is basically almost
complete so there was a
uh just to add more detail to the UND
side of the
[Music]
fot so I should go on and do
that so this
part the request was to add
the
some pants in
here nothing too much but
let's just add something
here
wa I should rather make this a
mask so I hope you have a good
morning watching
some one F in the
[Music]
morning bro my eyes are Wasing the magic
of art being shown here I hope you're
not saying
that uh it's too bright I'm just
basically working on White at the
moment
because that could be a for
Reas wait I could just click there and
then click here why did I do
that siling
me I'm so
[Music]
silly this song has a sound in the
background someone I forgot to put on
the seat
belt someone heard that sound like this
is a good sound
look I'm not much of an artist best I
can do is color
well it's still
art don't don't discredit your your
ability to
color which which a a great right to
have there are many things to
Art and I wouldn't say I was start great
M everything I know is
learned if I can learn it you can
learn so if I put this add add and of
this
subract
should get an interesting like this this
a bit too much okay um let me than
it best I can do is stick figures I
think you've done better than
that okay I think the biggest issue when
people are drawing if I may
uh go with
some one two three four five com with
some uh
critique General critique of everyone's
art at the same time it is that people
when people draw paper for
example uh it's that they uh try to draw
the final outline
immediately without any form of guides
or anything
[Music]
this is why when you look
up I think it's also because of how to
draw like how to draw
our there's like two two
versions let's take the the this
example from
how to draw a bunny by cool to be
[Music]
kids let
just now we're going to teach some
art Now give me the
credits they have they
have
so
I'm using it for uh
teing there we go when I something when
for example look up this stuff you get
like a guide like this how to draw a
bunny this I would argue is a terrible
art guide because it basically tells you
to draw the final outline
immediately and um how are you supposed
to know where everything should
go you could follow this going to draw a
bun exactly in this specific H that's
not going to help you much if you want
to draw like multiple drawings of
bunnies and your own
[Music]
bunnies
so I'm sure if I'm going to find the
proper uh guide for it but I can show
how I made my emote of
me P pon pon as a bunny it's a small
previe so I'm show it down
here I can make it larger but I mean
it's not high
resolution kind of
blurry I made I made it in three
steps so the first one is basically a
lot of circles
everywhere and then I did a rough sketch
of where I think I should put the lines
and and then I made the final drawing
sketch sketch can't hurt you sketchit
back if you want to start being an
artist do best art you can
and I mean like yeah do do your best and
just don't think too much about
it
and if you don't like how to draw a
rabbit it's every guide is to
terrible CU every guy is basically
saying draw the final artwork without
any form of planning or
anything now I
think I think you should
like have an
idea like
this I think think
uh because that was like I'm not sure if
I drawn uh rabbit like that before so
could argue that that was my very first
attempt to draw a rabbit like that and I
think it turned out pretty
good not not to
brag but I'm happy with how it turned
out without really any
his dream drawing
[Music]
rabbit too
much maybe something like this let's try
it so there there's some Su oh no my
horse just squished a skunk that's
fine
a don't squish
animals regardless if they are stinky
like a
skun
so now I have
generated the normal
map I can put it
here and here we go this nor map will
create the effect of 3D without there
actually being in
3D so we look at how it looks on mod
line kind of dark here
so do like
CL doesn't have much
but I guess that's the best you
can okay let me switch over and update
St 3 2 1 go there I be delay okay I
actually didn't expect it to go that far
out to the edge I expected a bit more in
the midle but that's no problem I can
always adjust that
like somewhere
between good okay
[Music]
um
[Music]
yeah go all the way up H not what I
was anyway and if you do it wrong you
just go back here and try
in it Mak the
shape after the edge
let me try
[Music]
this
F
oops
yeah
hope I hope that could be of any
help
[Music]
[Music]
want like
that a Shar
[Music]
[Music]
guys
huh
nothing
place there
[Music]
[Music]
f so with this
gu able
to
there you go that's
what
like
that then this in
here and everything
black make the smaller one and there we
go that's
say that's one is smaller
now
okay
over and
now it should be
better
generating a new nor
map that and
now should should be B
yeah and now after all that
work oh yeah there
go that's more like it now it has this
3d
effect without actually being
3
[Music]
eat some black
[Music]
meat
[Music]
that's it looks so
shiny
I'm pretty happy with this it's
just amazing
missing this should maybe I don't know
should it be a like a bow on top of the
head
because the reference artwork there it
is there is a
bow but how exactly it looks I don't
know because this is the only I have
it so I don't exactly know how I would
uh make that work in
3D I just have to come up for
something cuz I do have like this
B which doesn't so show up reasons why
is what is going
on why is nothing
sh body show is a
problem
[Music]
this is to show that if you correct
inside should be
[Music]
friend the blue side will be shown the
red side
[Music]
willway
no
mesh lost all
mesh just like
that what's a
[Music]
problem that's that's the problem we
need I guess I guess this just have to
be
what
happens so
weird cuz the f f size is large you
still canot have the mhes
[Music]
just but
[Music]
we I can't about can import it like that
it still exists
but but yeah
weird like sure I could add like a
regular headphon like this but I don't
think that really fits the style kind of
stands
[Music]
out
[Music]
right yeah funun
[Music]
fun program
confusing
[Music]
it's a female computer you
[Music]
know yeah may maybe something this
ni
[Music]

[Music]
that all the way over
[Music]

what it looks
like
[Music]
yeah what if you my on side oh is it
don't mind

this p in
[Music]
between and fin
understand
[Music]
on P the Bon bu TV
show was the ex space
it's
funny watch that show would even be I
mean aside from you know pon
pon being the
starring some for the show P always wear
a different outfit every
episode and of course also changing
outfit during the episode if required by
like for the story to make
sense if a story takes place in a
different day you obvious have to go a
different
[Music]
[Music]
country
[Music]
but
yeah Slice of Life say nothing nothing
special something special
always live will be Beach
[Music]
episodes y TI start forgetting Swit I

choice
that
to
there that all about
attached
looing I keep
back just in
case this one is set up
take on
these minut I set it to be wrong
material it should be this
one it just very nice
thing

[Music]
face
[Music]
I got one picture of what the face could
look like but
um not copy
cor thank
[Music]
you
[Music]
[Music]
so now I should
[Music]
this
[Music]
make sure off something
face very neutral face but I mean as a
reference
this have to be accurate anyway just
give idea should
be say
there I got got this stuff
quite how are you going to do facial
expressions it's basically not going to
be any like I want I want animation of
course of course and
um
which color is it
this
[Music]
uh so what I'm going to do is having me
uh kind of like
a my frame
animation
and H
Sprite I want do c the motion and stuff
like
that but yeah frame by frame
animation wait shouldn't they like inst
of what what I could
[Music]
do it's having like because this
is maybe my was bad I was thinking about
like doing like pixels or
something but I'm my just not look good
because it might be just B blurry and
not look
bad
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
this this not on
[Music]
[Music]
even
yeah it's going to have a set animation
and then it's going to set through the
animation
there a for
that and then I'll just cuz I plan to
do say take the
same oh yeah yeah it would be 8 * 8
expression
so that
many there be 64 Expressions you know
specific order and then I just have slow
playback on
it you could like switch especially like
every second every other
second and if it does that it will take
128 seconds to complete the full
animation which
is 2
minutes no blinking hard I completed
blink
so is going to suck oh wait what
what what are you talking
about the it
suck this from of
a
could have Mard all way yeah you must be
said something say definitely and suck
you mean I'm going to suck
something and what I'm going
suck I

MS what's the
hair
have this
to I might add
today C
[Music]
this
[Music]
okay I probably need see white more on
the
face e
[Music]
something maybe something for
now this isn't robot this is
robot
face she she has a
[Music]
face so if you really want good effect
here you take
this you take the whole screen you go
to this e it stands for
Mission make everything black because
nothing should
it that's what this me
[Music]
but the home
screen chest
expression take go and then export that
[Music]
as
e
e and now
opening
CER can duplicate
this open
E add it to
emission and yeah blender doesn't really
show emission other than just it being
[Music]
bright doesn't show any like glue or
anything
just
I want
yeah I guess the only me
is not
[Music]
that
[Music]
there that's a
GL
yeah now let's see kind
like like apple
is something I I can't read let me give
me a
m i know how to read these letters oh it
doesn't
[Music]
sayot and crab apple is this which I
got the forest basically I think the
word for watermelon trans like T bad
reference to
their
face yep there's a face
[Music]
now
things okay I guess that doesn't turn
out that
bad a k face fun is amazing I could like
make this okay if I'm going to show a
quick
hly if it's actually done for
me this
one if it's actually going to be
pixelated I will do properly
but as an
example it take like I don't
know like that and then
yeah maybe there too few pixels let's
[Music]
see there we
go there some
pixels going back here and
updating
I I gu
it's I mean sure I can I can do it
pixelated obviously and they get like
this I will do like properly pixel in
that case I think yeah I think it could
work okay what's the resolution of
that's screen with that amount ofation
yeah there you go do do you prefer it
with pixelation of without that you're
I'm listening to the
community let just let me know what you
think
but as said
H if I'm going to do it pixelated I'm
actually going
to like do it
properly not not just scaling down
existing mixing and here is without
pix I think I like it yeah I think
pixels would be
better yeah this this looks way too
clean
[Music]
many
pixels like
that definitely better with pixels I
from distance you're not going see it's
maybe the pance should be even
larger is is about getting name
correct finally good good sweet
spot okay
and more fix L okay that's that's must
be distance
how large is that stand like yeah yeah
you should be able to see it being
pixelated especially in cut scenes when
zo in on our
face not that this place going to
animate alongside the C scenes that's
not going to be
possible because a simple model cannot
access like the
required what is required to animate
properly
yeah I'll do things like this if I do
eight which I do now it's blurry get
close but I have a trick for that too it
should
go like four lines like this so every
four
L and but then
yeah for
the
because I said they are two layers
here there we go and I sh exactly the
same
thing and the front one is actually
going to use a different
material with its own texture which is
what it's going to do the animated thing
but and the reason why I have two layers
is because when you die from becoming an
angel the custom material is not going
to be included therefore the material
behind is going to be used for the angel
so I could have a custom face
specifically shown for the angent which
I will
do but that would be a static picture
but
yeah and that would be only phase that
will actually react to what's happening
due to a limitation to all the materials
right
so going get
good good good oh RIT
stupped the rabbits stop it and then
they went
on
so
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yeah
[Music]
