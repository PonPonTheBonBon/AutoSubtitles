hello hello
good timing
so the game is actually running quite
well
[Music]
so
let's start a new adventure
is slow at everything
select the icon there's no interesting
icons
I don't remember
I could be wrong but don't you unlock
more icons
maybe that was the inside game
would it make sense to have all icons at
start
if you want anything else to inspired
definitely much better speed it's just a
float you scaredy cat
look happy don't they spiral well it's
not every day that a dragon gets his
dragonfly
[Music]
uh right Sparks all right Sparks I don't
understand what you're saying
the animations are so nice looking
we meet again
who are you little shorty nobody invited
you this is an invitation this is slow
downs but very good
what do we want this time boss
you're not hired for your brains your
dinosaurian landmass
thinking and I will send you back to the
place I found you unemployed in molten
crater begging for work from nasty North
now back to what I was saying
well what do I want this time I am glad
that you asked purple Pest and I will be
happy to demonstrate since I've had
enough to do with Dragons I thought
perhaps dragonfly
this
am I supposed looking different from
everyone else
well that wasn't supposed to happen but
you see without the power of dragonflies
the dragons are nothing soon the dragon
homelands will be mine
that little lizard totally stole all the
dragonflies even Sparks is gone
don't worry I think I know where to
start follow me
[Music]
marks I thought I lost
okay
why is parks in here
[Music]
that was close Sparks listen that was
close by they could only speak
whoa what'd you do that for
eign
Dragon runes to use them since the spell
scattered them in different parts of the
Dragon realms
cool come on Sparks let's get going
we've got a lot of work ahead
could even save some polygons by doing
it correctly
and now they wasted polygons by doing it
incorrectly
I think that's an issue's scene
they got it correct in the like on
PlayStation one because they couldn't
so the game is running 3K
but it has its moments of slowdowns
uh I don't know if games actually rather
quickly or not
Spirit over there with this room he'll
be able to combine Dragon magic with my
magic and Grant you bubble breath to
catch dragonflies they're shy and we'll
probably run away
I'm shy I wouldn't run away from anyone
use your L1 button to switch back and
forth between fire and bubble breath
dedicated Fire Emblem rest button
and also since I can't enable this oh
since we left it
I don't know is the game running fast or
not
I mean sometimes it definitely feels
that does so they get cutscene also
so the uh that's not slowing down as
much and I definitely feel like game is
running okay
but one must
all right all right so much tutorial
yeah
so much tutorial
Queen
Elizabeth
okay yes I know it's I know what to say
Bianca has told me what to do
so which one of the collected yeah the
game is still done that's running
I'm I'm still trying to make this game
around I'm giving it
all I can do but
all right
I'm really trying to make the game work
even the loading screen is slow
yeah it's it's possible that I just need
to
board playing this game it was running
fine before
oh well I guess I guess I won't be
playing this game I guess I guess the
game just just refuses them
so
I had completed this game before 100
percent
and
so yeah I know it's possible but I know
it's possible
I know it's something I can't complete
but I really wanted to complete every
Aspire game on stream
it's slightly annoying if this is still
going to be the only game I'm not going
to be able to complete
but I guess I guess that's just how it's
going to be I'm not going to be able to
complete this game
it it just won't let me complete it
well
I guess I'll just have to move over to
the next game
which would be yeah
a hairstyle
I guess I just have to skip this King
completely
or when I have a computer that is more
powerful played on the emulation because
apparently playing it on Regional
Hardware is not working
I don't want to do ablation I want to
play the Norwegian Hardware but
but yeah if this is going to happen it's
not going to be plus one
so
so well let me move over to the
pause screen while I resolve
and switch game
[Music]
[Music]
it will just take
[Music]
a short
[Music]
never mind yeah wait I should have
foreign
[Music]
no
[Music]
it's annoying
[Music]
this is the head
[Music]
all right um
[Music]
is spamming me with three minutes
and it was a quick restart of the stream
because I
forget city that is simply correct the
things which I had to start restart the
Stream
hey sorry about that
and
you only get
it no worries I will I will move over to
play I hear steam instead so I will
switch information here
look uh Heroes name
any
in this case I don't have to change
your style as it
hi it's the cute bun bun
I am
I'm a little sad that I can't play a
hairstyle
oh wait wrong game that's the that's the
one I'm going to play I wanted to say
that I can't play
uh enter the dragonfly
because I wanted to complete every
spider game not five percent finish the
story of every spider game on stream
I want that as one of my goats
but
but
your dragonfly just refuses to run
properly
[Music]
yeah worst case I guess I'll see if I
can get it to run on the
on my
uh Nintendo console
foreign
do I even
I don't even know if I have a controller
to use for the game
so it might actually I might actually
not be able to run it anyway on
on that one and
I don't have any Xbox
the use I don't even I don't think it
came out on Xbox I think it was
PlayStation 2 and GameCube
and now here's Taylor's
listening to a GameCube and Xbox
welcome here is a waving ponpon
waving you welcome with the little winch
the elephant
you should
just wait
I do have it on my list too uh the idea
of a leaking on phone licking but
um
it's neat to see emails to have a
leaking one was worried I was late no no
and you're not you're not late
uh still waiting I don't have like
do you have the countdown page but
yeah this is definitely not my streaming
page this is just app uh
what do you call it information page
the other yeah that's the leaking one
and then he has put a Pom-Pom
do you have
on the chair 100 bits
and you had to see 900 more or how is it
oh
you get like
yeah I think you get what I want yeah no
yeah in one side because no one has
done whatever so 900 more bits and then
you unlock a pun pun and then you can
start licking the bonbon
and you will have that slot unlocked
whatever I connect the twitch the image
of that slot will change depending on
whichever is the uh because I will fill
out the followers slots first with the
most popular ones because
I want to be nice I guess
we'll see
oh I want to discuss which should be in
followers or not and then I would fill
out the subscriber slots and then the
remaining ones will be able to beat once
though you get a few bonus if you donate
bits
