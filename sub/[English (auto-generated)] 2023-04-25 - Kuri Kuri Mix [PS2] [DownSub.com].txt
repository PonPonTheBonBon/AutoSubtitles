foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I guess we'll just continue here

this is just the Arctic World left

I have made minor adjustments

I hope the audio for the game should now

sync up ugly

search it

well yeah

yeah it happened when it happens in Game

and notice it was out of sync a bit so

hopefully it's corrected

it's me yes it's me

sounds good and yeah and also done here

died some

a noise cancel effect on the microphone

as well hopefully that sounds annoying

noise in the background

oh

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

okay

[Music]

it says it can be interacted with

it

okay okay

I see so

we think it's meant for cream to get

launched by this

[Music]

but

[Music]

now I would make that happen that's the

big question I'm still

infinite yourself

there's something over there so that's

not the same

let's go back and check

oh I see now I see I I I'm definitely

miss something

[Music]

thank you no pink pink

[Music]

the water

so what was a try

[Music]

there's a thing in the way

not me cream

go into

go into the Austria Island

[Music]

it's kind of slippery so there's a thing

here as well

there's a thing here

oh I see

and then

[Music]

standing behind the pillar okay now your

voice sounds beautiful and nice I thank

you I am it is very nice to hear

whatever you think so since I've been

worried about what time always sounds

like

me

I'm able to stand here

because I am clean

[Music]

oh I didn't think you that actually

[Music]

oh oh you cannot live on those

[Music]

systems

[Music]

oh

and in this

hard is it to

get into a building really

okay cream then it's fine

[Music]

[Music]

yeah this split screen thing doesn't

make it easier

foreign

[Music]

okay I got more time now

so without making too many mistakes

[Music]

some platforms that aren't sleepy

are you supposed to jump to get Steve

[Music]

oh yeah five six and then

and I missed

even this thing is slippery

I missed again

sorry cookie cookie your sister

I

forgot his name yeah

and I was turning and now you just

squished

sorry just not you got a lot of cold

water is there

old showers filled baths

[Music]

I hope you don't mind

[Music]

that means I have to kill you emerging

penguins

they attack me

[Music]

School

[Music]

okay

[Music]

maybe it wasn't

[Music]

all right let's continue and should

ignore that

move it out of the way

we go

no

[ __ ]

avoid the pick it up

avoid making these mistakes

this time

there is something wrong here what

[Music]

all right

now this time

let's Journey

there you go good timing

[Music]

it's not cut

only one okay

so

this looks to hold up the eyes

if you remove these

which the person who put this here in

the first place probably don't like just

looks like a heavy ice block they don't

want

there is uh there is an edge there now

there's a cream can always walk past it

but shouldn't it be part of the puzzle

to remove the mini correctly

you did it just yeah just not getting

cleaned

okay A bit too many penguins here

[Music]

everybody

not

[Music]

okay okay

[Music]

yeah I'm not sure what I'm doing

let's see how it is

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

wait what ugly stuff

[Music]

sometimes during this Belmonts sometimes

like when this knocks into that that's

one race is for some reason

this is awesome do they have timers

think so

can you stand up

[Music]

okay so far

[Music]

I guess that wasn't the hardest question

to stay out of the water

understood

okay

all right

maybe that is more some

bonus later on

[Music]

[Music]

a personal case

it's nice

okay now I got

no need stuff everywhere

by turning this

oh excuse me

[Music]

can I

okay interesting

oh

[Music]

let's pick this one

and something tells me that's other two

are secret

smaller

[Music]

I don't know what this gift is I didn't

know there was gift things

okay next level

welcome everyone

[Music]

part just like

[Music]

just playing some

if they're moving the same way that

could make things easier

[Music]

hopefully that thing is nice and I don't

Humanity no wait I need this awesome

okay

okay

[Music]

[Music]

let's continue

I wanted to get that thank you

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

thank you

I can't wait to do this

[Music]

practice

going in the wrong direction as you

should this isn't the easiest control

um

here's the code

I thought I lost the wrong direction

okay let's reversing though

[Music]

okay it worked

what I didn't name ice house is called

igloo igloo

remember eclipse

[Music]

foreign

this is reverse okay

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

and yeah this should be the end

[Music]

so no more on our belts

that was such tricky

this button moves does this thing

[Music]

let's see

I see

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

all right

theme has switched down

yeah interested

is

thank you now I know they're called

sea glass I don't know

but something like that the bunnies are

so strong they can

they are kind of strong actually

okay

boss battle

I don't remember them sleeping though

thank you

[Applause]

good thing

I know

Sub-Zero Beast polar Teddy

oh I see

myself

[Music]

nice sound

[Music]

Best Link is

when I can see it

[Music]

or visit

it's rolling I guess

oh no

not really special

okay

for some reason

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

hello

kids what happens

this isn't too easy

[Music]

thank you

okay I'll just have to continue

let's throw this thing around don't you

hey how did I take damage

at least that's what time it made sense

very sorts of swing with the defender

from the funny state penguins

I like that it's faces they had it makes

strange faces

yeah they have the

protective rings

this first one basically hits

by not touching it again

but let's see how

I thought that was a big one

and then the penguins come

pick it up more quickly

[Music]

I missed it

but another thing

and that sounds actually having it gives

us less it lands on top of it again

okay so far so good

[Music]

[Music]

okay

pick up my space

[Music]

defeated

[Music]

the final hit wasn't really necessary no

really quick scene

so all the regular levels are done or

another idea

[Music]

thank you

honey oh no don't go into it

oh wow what happened to chestnuts don't

go into it yourself

the chickens are free from the

wait the chickens were never

opponents

anyway

that was a weird thing let's go to the

humble world

it's not even

something

a single world

cute bunnies they make at least cream

like white phrases just that isn't

really okay

so yeah

[Music]

it's already winning

I guess that worked

[Music]

okay

[Music]

such a strange level

Kenny too

stop attacking things thank you

it's thank you for dying

[Music]

I hate them is

part of this

okay that blows it away

what's the point of that I mean I don't

have any

time left to really

continue but

and then he comes back

very interesting wow I got that that's

okay let's see

a message okay

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

let me just

can you

see like

[Music]

I look at that later

[Music]

laughs

with people like this

[Music]

okay here we go

that's how spec

s just stand there

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

and we're supposed to grab

like that

they were supposed to I did that so much

better than last time okay

well where did you come from

a bird

well it came back

now

I mean I guess I guess a bird makes

sense

okay

yeah

as I expected these levels were going to

be a bit

all right

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

okay

[Music]

okay

[Music]

[Music]

because all these elements are moving

and I will wind them actually

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

this thing

[Music]

it's actually small but I see the girl

I just need to get the chestnut over

[Music]

foreign

stage one clear

these these are like a bonus area or is

this the next area of the game

Army's next World which you unlock after

you completing all the other words

okay interesting stuff

let me reach

oh

it should be a full world with

all four levels in the boss

okay you can do that

let's keep it the whole level

I'm not sure what the point of that was

but

sure

oh flying machine

[Music]

thank you

I think I'm better yeah what am I

supposed to do here

I can't go hurry

[Music]

not exactly go down below let me suck

here

can we go around it

or I can go back okay

[Music]

oh I see a bomb

all right

trying to figure out what control side

and okay

let's do that again

now that I figure out what controls are

[Music]

my favorite thing looks fine

it's great

[Music]

please

[Music]

[Music]

I need to press and grab also

okay

crying a bit too much here

okay I grabbed it

I just threw it badly

did it work it's a bit

different

I guess it worked

you can just grab another one

oh I see

[Music]

[Music]

let's try to bomb the Cannons but

I didn't work

[Music]

yeah

I'm using tight

[Music]

yeah

not the easiest way

hello would

welcome

um and the door is the bus yeah the door

is the bus in this level

it's like a minibus clean system they

Cannon

it's all you have to do

the minibus door

so

[Music]

I should at least be like in business

for a second

please picture performed

all right and let's try this

[Music]

quite a big heart box honestly it

doesn't make things easier either

however it doesn't count for picking up

props apparently

[Music]

[Music]

okay

I just need that very approach

I mean that shouldn't have hit

but I shouldn't have hit

yeah they

it

is

too easy

but I made a few changes to chat

not really too noticeable it's minor

changes

[Music]

but yeah

okay I need to know how far this price

[Music]

okay Sally grab

it

if you're not sure I'm supposed to avoid

this video

[Music]

all right

[Music]

I took damage I said I tried to pick up

the bomb yeah how's it going I also

never saw this game before I didn't play

I played this game

and last Tuesday

now I'm trying to finish it up and it's

the last World

well maybe there's another one I love

this one but

this last world is quite a challenge

and as you can see I control both

characters at the same time

oh can I control it and of course

they're okay

[Music]

yeah I have no idea

I have no idea I was supposed to avoid

these things

they fly straight into the wall

that causes no damage

[Music]

oh yeah that didn't count

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

bus

it's gone and that was only stage two

there we go now inside this thing

one rabbit passed I was scared to say

but he died

okay done

okay

then these blades

one slice done

oh no he took damage from a shard

and why why are the characters attacking

cream

why does she deserve this

Chestnut didn't get anyone attacking

okay got some kind of

Anna I don't like this

okay let's cool it down with some water

or kill it no you just got no no

it's fine

oh I was gonna say oh now he got a

one that's this one cream

so I try to pick that up I took damage

you lose oh

no

stop attacking the bunnies

they haven't done anything wrong

and they are invading I guess but

we have

twice this

oh oh I see

that please find cups okay I see

[Music]

okay this looks like another pass battle

now the rules are reversed

uh it's it's this one again

come here

not any come closer go closer

[Music]

but that didn't count

please stop close enough

okay

[Music]

yeah kind of losing time

uh I thought that worked apparently not

they killed it

oh that's evil there's so much going on

it's quite good

it is quite chaotic

and it's obviously

earlier worlds are easier to manage than

day difference but

yeah sliced bunnies

they look like nice places inside

now I

stepped if I

yes apparently I can't kill this bye

[Music]

like that okay apparently making them

follow with us

yeah apparently making a photo which I'm

confused

running out of time

okay there's some lie in this bag

that's yeah

[Applause]

I want to get up here

I need some

[Music]

a lot

water

hey I was in the middle of my channel

okay I don't actually need to get rid of

these I only need to pick up these

guys

yeah they that went worse

because I took too much damage from

[Music]

okay about this starting

[Music]

but I can't even concentrate them

anything but I just had

there you go

seems like this should be easier

hey I'm making mistakes now

for some reason

it was easier to depose at the same time

I'm done I'm at time

sure okay

sure reach fire with us

okay now I got plenty of time

[Applause]

so the water has nothing to do with it

it's just

okay apparently that's 3D Plucky

did not looks like deported at all

it's so difficult it is quite a

challenge

[Music]

would like to see other people try

I mean I mean two people at the same

time exactly fancy

[Music]

yeah

I was I was busy attacking

[Music]

wait why didn't that counts

is it because I landed on

it's just all the time ahead okay Buzz

Bell time

foreign

and why don't I get extra time from that

bus

but wait do you have to play Both Sides

yeah that's what makes the game more fun

and that's fantastic challenge try to

say that before I guess I

I'm not the best of explaining stuff

why

[Music]

a funny poses

at that time

oh they sure reached

run little bunnies

just had to make less mistakes

so here is a thing on top of the farm

and that's

prevents it from working and that thing

knocks it down

apparently

[Music]

this part just takes such time

and maybe I can jump up

[Music]

I got outside

Monster High

[Music]

this works

about to pick up the clock first

and don't press the button

[Music]

as they move on their own

and this boss battle is harder because

you don't get extra time

wow how can you reach that part

must make you smiling

[Music]

my name is

next step back recipe is foreign

just step forward thank you

foreign

has three lives like last time but it

looks to be bigger

and stuff in the beginning

fairly easy serious my kids

yeah it probably requires on six so it's

hard to get it all the way into the edge

let's discipline to the scan

okay I can't land on it

yeah I mean this possible is a bit

impossible and you hear how it's made

so this would probably take a while

that's so cool but I can imagine

confusion at least the controller is

divided in both characters so you

controls the beach if we use half and

they are I was going to say always on

their own side of the screen but in this

case they aren't

[Music]

I tried to remember which button because

which character I mean that's

[Music]

since they are on each side of

controller you control each with your

each hand that kind of helps

not like the kids with the nicest device

make when they move

they have kind of interesting watch

noise

that

okay apparently that doesn't work

[Music]

sometimes the time is correct sometimes

after you taking damage you can just

walk forward

okay

yeah I don't have no idea how I should

sound defeat that boss

American thing better at that part

I mean

with this one even stop me if I tried to

kill all the function or something

[Applause]

thank you

about clocks okay let's see

I don't think that

okay now I'm thinking I'm not the best

yeah these blue ones are harder because

they are doing the overhead swing

[Music]

ers

[Music]

this is

okay see instead of only attacking it

three times you have to attack it six

times you don't get any extra time after

each time you hit it

um

and you have to and it's not just the

boss battle and you also have to work

spell

[Music]

[Music]

I mean I guess I guess the game should

decrease in difficulty but I mean

everything reason I think

if he walks down all the way and then do

the attack but still not

far enough down to be hit with that

thing

what am I supposed to do if they

still can't just do that pack

I mean I guess I have an idea but

he can't do it I don't know you can do

it

[Music]

I guess I guess I I will continue to try

but maybe

possible write something

[Music]

I should be able to do that just

depending on the main one

sure it makes it easier

ah come on

come on

come on

I went to the CFR for our campus

[Music]

that file I can't reach far

foreign

oh

yeah

I guess that worked

got plenty of time but this this bus is

going to be hard

because it's made of rocks

some ideas of how she did this

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

yeah

I mean

I forgot

okay

okay I have

how she saw this

[Music]

[Music]

where's

too far down instead

of course

I've defeat about the clock should stop

good

I got one thing I left

[Music]

because

the game has to cheat a little bit as

well

fighting a Golem Too Close wait too

close

[Music]

yeah it's a green version of the

previous column

oh wow oh I I see what's going on oh

yeah

uh a new face state

it can apparently not follow this level

I didn't pick that up

okay

[Music]

let's see what this should do there

okay this feels like

it tastes like a bad challenge

[Music]

okay

get it I just need to keep track of

take care

I like this

okay see if I did this

then I'll do this

[Music]

that didn't work

I got this give me a few more attempts

and I'll do it

good

Ness

there you go

okay can I land on this one first no

[Music]

[Music]

okay

okay open the doors

bunnies are coming

oh oh

maybe maybe I don't want to walk in here

oh

okay

okay

that's that's how you want it

okay

squishy welcome

hi hi

so

look at this

confusing

I don't remember if you were here

last Tuesday

when I used to play this game

I just have to

control both characters at the same time

that's not issue

I see it doesn't matter which I started

[Music]

there you go

and I guess I'll try to

stay to the edge here although in that

case I'm missing the

timers but it cares about timers if

means I don't take damage

that seems

don't have to delete them right

mechanistan

no not the blue ones

it would actually be funny

if they actually did cross

sides there because that would be a bit

confusing

oh no tiny columns

oh

too much to keep track of

wow bunnies

Bunny's attacking bunnies

I hope you are well

nice yes

yeah

I'm really not good at this

and I definitely feel

[Music]

happy to see you

I need to find my words

[Music]

that is fun to see people you recognize

show up

foreign

place in

Naruto okay I was thinking because

I usually stream in 30.

and plus activities the

bandwidth

and such

[Music]

but I don't remember if this game runs

in

this game [ __ ] running 50 or or 25

because I'm currently streaming

wow

Destiny remember just headed back to

satis or when I play

inspire

onion bunny fighting

so people behind people

like

someone squishy likes

this is

these bunnies are very squishy

animations

it is hard to

since I'm playing the game on my TV and

then I have this chat on the computer

I cannot see the chat while I'm playing

but also considering the game is our

family meets

should focus on

Team level

until I do that

and then I'll check if there are any

chat messages

while I play Spyro or

when I play games on the computer I have

the chat

right next here the game

so you can see any messages all right

that's fine

when it started crumbling

I keep missing that platform

it is a bit hard to see more Shadows

over the nothing but there is no

platform

laughs

I've made it easy

oh

that must be easy you can do it yeah I I

did it I did last time now I should be

able to do it again myself

[Music]

okay I need to move a bit first which

isn't right

because that's the next problem uh

playing 3D games one activity screen

oh that's close

oh that was a bit too far too

with the wrong character

or many more trades but hopefully just

now I stepped off the platform so I

didn't

so I didn't get the initial jump

immediately

oh yeah I forgot I'm supposed to learn

on that smile I'm

all right

none of the other level had it so you

lose everything if you fall I need to

stop jumping so early

like the museum

I think

and the music starts when I started

level that doesn't help

here we go no mistakes

[Music]

I must make a mistake

he can't take damage on the edge

can I get it

should I please

laughs

I would like to move before you do the

next attack

[Music]

some additional ones I need to drink

it's nice and the vocals of the pot it

has teeth

[Music]

but any timing just make noise whenever

um

I guess they make

noise

[Music]

it would be nice if they did a bit

different sounds it's slight variations

okay I lost the

money

why does chest not always follow me

[Music]

okay

if one more try

now now

there you go that's how it is

jump too early again

foreign

[Music]

like a happy

[Music]

Hardware

and the arguably

have a nursery

oh come on

because in that case I could

because I could imagine that the picture

quality isn't the best

foreign

Ty is scientists

capture cards

which then knows the picture in the

software

and then

I'm just taking the picture from that

software

the the output it gives on the window

and Screen there

[Music]

yeah but that means that

in the

if the window

giving the

picture in the window isn't

displayed for perfectly

thank you

I tried to measure everything so it

should be displayed like Pixel Perfect

it's hard to measure something

oh

thank you

okay now the Chill Spot close it and

then there's important

I have to do

I mean a bus paddle

with two characters at the same time

oh

my name is

way too much health

they have more Health than a boss

how many times did I jump on them

am I supposed to do something else

this is

[Music]

thank you

and while adding bunnies in the first

place I mean I'm playing Spanish I

didn't expect bunnies to be enemies to

bunnies

[Music]

who's currently is the part of me I

haven't seen anything media

[Music]

okay let's test ignore those timers

all right

yeah I have no idea how to get past that

part they put you up against the most

powerful animals the bunny

or a mini bus

not just anybody a green bunny a few of

them that you have the defeat using two

separate characters

of course I use both characters for

every boss battle but but normally I'm

gonna have to bother dealing with one

bus

yeah

I'm duplicating

the six of them in the same time

[Music]

at least they didn't attack like there

was only one of them attacking so I

guess my

[Music]

fish bugs all over again

I mean

the fish was something annoying because

it was hard to not only steer but also

pick up bombs

so I saw the hard part was actually I

came the bus in this case

guess it's

three hour stream is just going to be me

in this level this is the third level

I should say

okay let's see

I think that and I can check which level

it is

and I think this is the third

let's say first

sorry

I think this was the third no this was a

force okay so it's a fourth and last

level and then it's boss battle

foreign

and that didn't work again

it's it's it's placed so far away I have

to

um

[Music]

if it gets really close to the edge

before I jump

even make the jump

[Music]

I wonder if there's an easier pass to

get the trust me and delete this

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

and like that I skipped past all those

annoying ones

if I land in France

I know

the bus

okay so I don't take that much I guess

standing

supposed to

because it probably is also that I

cannot attack them while they make an

attack because they are high up in their

eyes I cannot read them so

thank you

[Music]

I'll do this it has been nice

[Music]

I need to be such a relief when I

overcome this challenge

[Music]

according to my second objective

[Music]

I think I forgot to press the button

I need to jump I forgot to jump

[Music]

now I'm messing up

another

I made another change to the chat as

well that is if a person follows that

will actually show up as an event in the

chat

it happens I stopped

[Music]

I follow myself and

as far as I can tell if I'm following

and then following again it doesn't tell

because twitch has taken that into

consideration that

say this you have more passion than I do

yeah I

I've had some people say that I have a

hard time giving up

um

it really depends on what kind of

challenge it is

[Music]

I usually don't give up that easy

two hours

and as I'm not like I'm not still on

this uh

within one hour 40 minutes I've not been

on this level all that time but

I've been on this level

and I'm I'm still trying to get a day

that

wrong path again that I keep failing on

um

unless the jumps out of sync

all right

and that's that's again

when you walked out in the edge

therefore it is

foreign

sometimes

the games that are nice

let's make some more Korean let's play

next is so that if you walk out in the

air

still have a chance

to make the initial ground jump

a thing that as far as I know is called

coyote

um

[Music]

funny time

should I like

I know yeah it doesn't want to activate

it

please

instant Japanese

I cannot jump over that stable thing

behind this too tall

I can't even read the chat again

you got this and

I'm sure I hope I tried to do one at a

time there

and so I can just concentrate on the

other one I'm not sure if that's going

to work out I'll try that again

I just need to figure out when to attack

you can do it you're smart and cool I'm

not sure if I'm the one should put some

sunglasses

I'd be saying the k word

and the

keywords over and over and over by now

when I had been doing something right

now

[Music]

yeah maybe

Maybe

[Music]

I just need to find a way to make that

money agency so I cannot can I still

approach it at one time I need to

activate it because same time

and again again that that happens a bit

too after now

and then I

just need to find the best moment to do

at home I don't even know how many heat

points I have it sounds like I [ __ ]

Street

I should do that Within

timing

[Music]

like that

[Music]

okay there you go

about sorted quickly this control is too

small and it's an official Sonic

no come on

come on

attack

[Applause]

I got so tight way too many times there

two watches left everyone is leaving

[Music]

tea time

okay

I need to count

[Music]

and then I walked off the platform this

time

I'm not leaving to University watching

this game even and I I still keep this

house in here

this time

that let's see

[Music]

that was a failure I don't think I've

ever failed on that

before

um

okay now let's see

I do wish I had more

um

[Music]

who fell down first

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

speed running the game yeah so

before saving time

30 seconds

see damages

five times

I cannot do that because I thought I can

remember

um

[Music]

and it's stuck getting stuck again

two

three

and there was no timer yet to be kept

okay so I need to jump on it five times

okay

no

I will never leave I will be here so

sport

the

through this no matter what it is

and I will try to stream in three hours

so it's it will take three hours

and I do appreciate that it's very nice

that you are here

yes

[Music]

it gives me motivation to continue

and I will defeat these bunnies I

managed to get one so far

but I have to really defeat it again

with five hit points that is a lot

so 10 in total

I decided not to shame today oh okay

today that I could get here I mean you

should do as you want

all right what is the motivation for

this rapid experience

they need to get the moon back the moon

has been lost

that was the intro

I think I made a clip of the intro

when I was really in the intro

oh yeah

there was no joke there

I jumped too early

all right

all right

[Music]

like that

one or two seconds last time

okay

so I got your diet

through things

could you not please

I almost

I think one

two

three four

I

one

two

hello

me

or

five that's pretty easy now

how much is that

that was all I did it

it took only two minutes

I don't know how long that took but I

did it

though someone stole the mood I don't

remember if someone stole the Moon

but the moon disappeared in some way

it's possible no wait wait a minute let

me

[Music]

I wanted to

meet there was no option to quit

because I have to say bye everyone can

come back again those three other

watches you

it disappeared okay

[Music]

since I got past that level now

it is rambling the chickens are there

with their signs

the floor is

on our cream is dying

he died

okay

cream didn't die she survived

now they're flying

and music disappeared

Overlord the Moon

okay

but they were supposed to rescue the man

why is the moon the dark Overlord

yeah we finally come home

[Music]

okay

how about that I was running as fast as

I could

oh the Moon is blue

[Music]

I mean he's running around I'm confused

yeah

and that's

woof she wait how can you be three

people talking in the chat while there's

only two watches

with three challenge wrong about the

what number watches

thank you

oh pretty much out

let me watch My Shoes oh you can

actually

moved him I didn't know that

that is pretty good to know

actually he landed on it

ah that does make it easier

um yeah

I didn't get any time

I need to defeat the boss within 120

Minutes minutes I wish

and 120 seconds without taking damage

because I mean every time we take at

least 30 seconds

[Music]

oh

okay this is something right

okay I think I have an idea how far we

should do that if it looks creepy the

moon lastly creepy

okay

good night can you zoom out the camera a

bit so I can see both characters

[Music]

[Music]

okay

[Music]

that two more hits

I'm writing the eye

like that

there you go

hey what are you doing

you're not allowed to do this

foreign

this is this is cheating

[Music]

okay

I have an idea what to do I just need to

do better here

[Music]

first shot in the moon's Moon

I was going to say you did it but then

that happens yeah

then the moon started cheating

Chestnut he's the one attacking you and

then I'll walk himself

[Music]

taking cream all the time before

I lost that I didn't see it

I haven't dreamed should quickly

good

here we go uh

uh slow

projectile

[Music]

I can't determine

generate everything

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

okay

[Music]

yeah I don't really know what I'm

supposed to do there

I'm supposed to jump on them maybe

thank you

okay

wait

I mean you can do that

how am I supposed to do that if you

attack

immediately like that

wait I guess he spawns at hands but

still

no I didn't hear that thing

I did but I need to start seeing it that

hasn't done since the very first bus

battle

very strange bus indeed

[Music]

thank you rabbits rabbit rabbit

oh

then I need to stop again again

how am I supposed to avoid that

spawns instantly I guess I'm interested

in stuff I have the Cannons but but

still

apparently on the spot at the cannons

this place feels like cheating

rabbits

[Music]

okay and then I should apply the Cannons

it's not gonna start

but now you spawn up there okay who are

you going perfect

cookie I mean just

his name is

[Music]

okay

and then

oh

yeah

I picked the cream okay

sure

you're here again

here we go

[Music]

a bit better than the last time

it really needs to pass the clock as

soon as the bus is defeated

[Music]

can I

[Music]

thank you

guys

I see God

I was going to be clever back yeah I

could I could use the

status for something no I couldn't

no I try to be clever I wait

I'm glamor

okay but now at least I know I know what

I'm supposed to do

and avoid cannons when the bus is

cheating

[Music]

and then hopefully

[Music]

because Chestnut is already spanning

foreign

[Music]

like that like that is

I don't think so because that's what

made it to die

[Music]

okay

[Music]

snacks okay

it worked I just

attack you again

[Music]

and I can't interact with the status

all right

oh

I think I know what needs to happen when

he split

I still had to figure it out I will see

if I can do something

because I think it had something to do

these things

yes

just

the the reaction time I need before I

can start moving is very very short

what's in the middle what

since when does that happen before

[Music]

where can I stand without a boss

cheating

at the statues I guess

okay and then I need to know

I'm so close to that section

[Music]

is

just jump down in the middle of

something yeah

thank you

now I got plenty of time

there on the wrong side switch sides

[Music]

okay we can guess yeah

I think you have to time

there is a picking sound

yourself and see they sing

the idea was that I had to jump

because

uh

yeah

second can't wait let's see if I'm ready

let's see if that uh Excel as far as I

can tell I can't find a way to interact

with the statues that is

[ __ ]

and

otherwise it's that I have to jump on

the them certain amount of time like

with rabbits probably not five times

again that's that's such cheating I

can't avoid that

[Music]

is

oh

yeah

wrong way

[Music]

[Music]

huh

amazing

that that's a highlight

s

[Music]

is very quickly

this is this idea by jumping on them

but

[Music]

funniest actors here

foreign

and

lucky shot yeah I just you know

so

I guess I'm just supposed to shoot

um

jump on them I can't shoot I don't have

any shoes with

oh

I didn't know that was a thing

and again he's trying to cheat

[Music]

but yeah yeah

but

while that is nice I kind of want

um

[Music]

he's only attractive but you're not

holding a cannon I mean it makes sense

that's like the one holding the academy

but

um

cheating

yes

[Music]

I think once more thank you

why can't last one get destroyed so do

it

[Music]

the last one is drawing I guess it's

supposed to be used for something

[Music]

come on can I start moving it before I

take damage again

because there's no interact with it

so

the working the last one get destroyed

thank you

yeah

jumping on them please

and I

barely getting the time to move before I

get attacked again

well there goes my theory yes

boy I can destroy Allah

they have four statues but I can only

seem to be able to disarm in Phase One

and therefore

let's pick the wrong Cannon I forgot

which point

it's very difficult it's quite a

challenge but I mean it's defeated the

green bunnies

and the Moon is more difficult in green

valleys

oh

that sounds like a weird scene

you're already going to attack

okay

I can't understand the changing name to

cookie because when sometimes it cannot

use the names the same

okay

for what I want to see cooking but I

would say cookie instead of chestnuts

just not just starting the case up guess

that

right now

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

it's like testing

[Music]

oh

hello moon we're gonna take this this

time

[Music]

[Music]

it was

ah you can actually start all of them

okay even though I try to destroy the

last one like two times

oh wait it's not defeated

is that

okay here we go ah take me this attack

please please select the pink one in

that kind of stands out

here we go

I'm switching them up

[Music]

[Music]

my guess is that I need to jump on two

of them

jump just jumping on one of them is

already really difficult if they are

quickly they move and that they damage

you if you touch them

yeah

and I still don't know how to defeat it

engage full moon

I don't know what the name or is because

it's a black man okay yeah I guess

possibly man

anyway and it's uh it's

really difficult

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

can I give up that because now it's a

bit silly

um

that was turned

[Music]

I can't just let them

[Music]

[Music]

instead of statue

[Music]

come on

[Music]

it's my prince thank you

okay

well

that's right

[Music]

[Music]

yeah

it's not like jumping on the same one

multiple times because it only has this

scene I know

I need to make all of them busy they're

dizzy

for such a short time and it's already

difficult to jump on one of them

so

and

[Music]

yeah I had no idea how I should do this

so I'm out of ideas

[Music]

I don't see because it it has health

I myself

supposed to interact with

am I supposed to jump okay am I supposed

to jump with both of them on the same

one when sorry jump on it once with one

of them and then

okay I got another India I just I I'm so

confused

[Music]

this is getting great

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

please

[Music]

right right

oh

okay

that's all I had today

okay

[Music]

what's that what was that I need the

aimed for me

that that was cheating

oh yeah you saw the option when I jumped

on it

uh yeah I noticed that uh this time

I missed it last time

that's the solution okay

but then that other one came and just

turned

come on

Emma

I mean

foreign

[Music]

okay

I thought

yeah

yeah I was so confused Starbucks today

[Music]

okay but now I

have a solution

yeah yeah I need to shoot it quickly

and in that case

[Music]

and this is good I just need to figure

out who it's chasing first oh

stuck

that went terribly

as usual

we have kids

okay that one is

if you interact with stuff was a little

bit easier

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

I don't have it

I can't get kids

okay so that was

that's not to get this part that was

close enough to get back as well

okay okay

[Music]

is trying to do the first phase battery

so I can actually do the second phase

oh how

like how how accurate do I need to be

thank you

oh come on come on

that's what I was thinking

and myself supposed to have to jump on

the one while it's what

okay

yeah I mean

they did pass through each other quite a

lot there so

I think

that wasn't the case and how would this

defeat the last one in that case

oh that did count so

many limos

[Music]

it requires a lot from you to do this

[Music]

okay you cannot do that

[Music]

and I basically I have to wait wait

Lotus

his face because this face is what I

need I just need to do this face better

and not walk into it

[Music]

just like that

[Music]

okay

exactly

[Music]

okay so switch places

now I got plenty of time

[Music]

face three

ah

it's inflating

[Music]

everything turned black

oh save yes please

is there another level because it wasn't

really anything here

[Music]

Chestnut and cream have recaptured the

moon at last

You Stand The Mysterious messenger

reappears and speaks

Festival celebration

but my brain here is wait New York is

not done yet and this is still speaking

it is on the next night with the moon

glowing in the sky that the rabbit Clan

begins their time on festival and

something more than

make sure that it does not run off and

spoil the festival again oh no

they're gone

and they continue to fulfill this sacred

responsibility even to this day the

rabbits in the man that's what it is

[Music]

credits you did it

if I should counter States

that's

not history

[Music]

yeah so that took two hours 40 minutes

plus the three hours about three hours

in the first one you can probably cut

some minutes from that

it's a four and a half hours to complete

the game

well Michael wants to complete the game

for this stream so

[Music]

I haven't been here

thank you foreign

[Music]

I have not completed that game before so

now I can

while I do still have the possibility

this is the collect if I want to collect

100 but

yes I could do that some random stream

in the future if people are interested

it's not ass it's exciting as actually

like

[Music]

collecting possibilities at least does

not require defeating any major bosses

[Music]

you never gave up

and I think that's cool about you

I mean the

yesterday I did give up anyway

foreign

[Music]

Festival

we did it

yeah let's give this so that's the

Moon thing it's been the versus mode
