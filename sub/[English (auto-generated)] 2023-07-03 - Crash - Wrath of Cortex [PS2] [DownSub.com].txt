down

let's eat tonight

oh views nice nice so that makes sense I

haven't

done all preparations I need to play in

my audience I can hear the game

like that

tonight

doesn't mean that

so

so I have two levels left

do you find the power up nothing like

that

the um

my mistake

oh and he switches page quite quickly

and I can and that's 12 yes

and I can see how the

I don't know what

elements that came with you know any any

YouTubers

lucky person

[Music]

I'm here we're gonna do this is the time

turns too well I mean

I think I need to do Independence

things I need that for

probably the final gem election class

three I don't remember this is basically

class three but

extra content

don't forget about the first redeem

time trials okay

how much delay is there

yeah because I could just test it now

well I haven't started playing it as

still playing I don't think anyone

but I mean it's you and someone else

if they have ads

but

okay let's see

us is like

centimeteroseconds

let me try it here

it kind of hard to measure the day

and it's basically like 500 milliseconds

let me reduce the delay here

like that

and of course the audio is all messed up

again

notice the audio change

makes no sense

the audio shouldn't be affected by um

I said I really need a new setup

foreign

might be quieter than otherwise but I

don't know

but you need to get the rest of those

gems of course

of course

the most of those stamps are the extra

levels which I will get after getting

surgery so you have to do the 20 trans

first anyway

I mean the audio should just be

underneath the more in sync so I don't

speak I have a or behind the action

anyway then now I have everything set up

I got a bit late today

oh extra levels

for several reasons

create Balls of Fire

[Music]

bombs

all right it was it was climbing it

wasn't double jumping my bad

of course you can't use the bazook up

here that would be something

I'll never hurry him

no hurry at all

but but that's a quick way of dealing

with that I got a lot of lives I don't

think I need to collect like all the

fruits

the news is about one day

there's a dark lemonade

as a this is a proof that how

how slow this game is

compare this animation to how it was in

my swing

they're like

foreign

[Music]

they don't need that bouncing

they could actually make the bonus

Harder by not having anything

let's argue

perfect everything

I like this

is right away it starts

let me change to

the distinct one which is gonna I still

haven't made crash once but maybe it's

better to make it more difficult but I

said they could make it more bit

difficult by not having it there

so they made it easier

well at least this is trash

or

oh no not this

not this thing

yeah I'm not really sure I'm supposed to

country shooting

okay I can't shoot it from a distance

without this

I'm running into everything

I jumped on it

I'm excited what he said oh yeah my

my English might not always

be the clearest

for some reason started shooting oh

that's right thing

you should be able to hold down the

basuke button to enable this mode too

but what do I know

because it's the same

emails

Oh I thought it was in a different

location

checkpoint

oh and it comes again

here comes the explosions

[Music]

here

here comes the

whoa

hello

she's practicing your name

welcome

and and read this had your Pepsi Max

stick up please but I didn't have one

don't you remember me saying it

thank you

welcome welcome

I'm still not used to raids so I'm on Mr

Heat

so

I'll do my best

I am ponpon

currently playing

Wrath of Cortex the original force game

until they read convicts

and is no longer part of the official

Crash Bandicoot lower

this means that Crash Bandicoot never

used

what is this called Texas skeleton

there we go I'm away from that

um I I should

actually

welcome everyone that's awesome I'm

still learning

welcome remastered

it's it's a it's a It's tricky to learn

to say some names like should it be

remastered

yeah yeah

I appreciate

hey how's it going I'll

it's it it's going

dead

it's going

oh ah

I mean I'm using this not so fun mix it

that's really hard to aim it

this game can be fun but it also has a

very annoying things too too

power armor mix it yeah makes it yeah

we

can call Irene

close enough reception is hard

definitely

and that

I have

oh no that was bad timing me

talking these of course I need to

oh I can't I can't move closer and

further away from the camera I'm

actually stuck

well slightly but

okay I need to

wait where's my aim the aim is gone the

game the game is buggy at the moment

yeah

I still want to work

okay now now it works

I'm playing on a P3

so

if there's any issues with a game

running on the PS3 so this is the PS2

game on the P3

and

there you go I made it the person if

it's

a personal gate quarries

this as excessive

I don't know what what you're trying to

say

probably from Aliens

well said I got it when she comes with

that man that's perfectly fine and I'm

saying thank you for reading

I hope you had fun drawing I think it

said

bye bye

have fun

I'm

quite I'm also an introvert also but I'm

really trying

yeah oh I fell off

so I have a good stream fun thank you I

hope you I hope your stream was good

I like to

all right

I was not paying attention

I like to look back at

dark here so it's hard to see

no it's not now

I categorize

I see

you spent you spelled it categorized

with a G there so I'm not a convenient

person I would categorize this as

exercise now I can read it

I can't guys make sales workers that

have computer

deciding that their legs and arms what

they

dislikes here let's see

it is perfectly fine I understand

okay

I can also learn to

be better to decide to decide for his

it's it's it's also funds I mean

if you say

I was thinking like from your name with

the

for some reason I got an Italian feel

from that

I was thinking is that some

Italians spelling Maybe

but maybe we're thinking it

I can't spell in words

yeah sometimes I have a problem spelling

some English words

but that must lead to English spelling

I am not been diagnosed with

dyslexia at least

in central Ford there are segments where

he is a maxit

and the boss has constant arguments

which he can see because he insists are

calling power armor

well I don't know the technical

differences

crash you've been a naughty boy now

that's going to end

you've been a naughty class

is partly

finish oh yeah I could see that too

so you're done

so the one lemon left

so and then

and then I'm soon

to face off against cortex and then I'm

just going to try to 100 in

hey

oh yeah you use a square to shoot with

the uh suit as I'm going to call it now

but you use Circle to shoot

oh okay thank you for the following

I I asked the reason I would not call

this power armor is that it's not

armored yeah that is true he still takes

damage just as normal

and it doesn't even give him one hit

points of protection and then he loses

it he just dies

this is not an armor in any way

oh

let's let's make this easy

still pressing the wrong shoot button

they have put invisible ones in

currently

that can shift

I only call it power armor because I was

referencing instrument flooring

oh

he's saying strawberry game I should

came series I should try

it apparently I could not slide on the

dance

this could be a level annoyingly where

you have to shoot every Metro I know

it's Nitro

I think

what do you think about the D5 5090

first I don't know which one that is

if you don't know look it up okay should

we take a quick looking at Pokemon

how do I

if my talking man that's what her spell

Pokemon

Oh Oh you mean this one

let me

foreign

I have considered because if you try to

look up Pokemon or something on

Bulbapedia for example it it doesn't say

how it's pronounced

so I one idea I had was to go through

every single Pokemon episode

and

note how they pronounce

the each Pokemon of course

I want to go through every Pokemon

episode just to see if the princess

pronunciation changes

because that would also be interesting

and then at some point first four kids

was dabbing it but then later

Pokemon took took over and

manage the dabbing themselves that could

also change the pronunciation

and then basically just adding the

pronunciation to googlepedia

when it comes to languages

that's that's language stuff

foreign

that's

no I wasted life during the other life

that shouldn't count

I just I

just hydrated but I can hide it again

and also let's change outfit

okay coming in

makes the app

I'm going to make the

what the wet wetter wetter

water

there we go

okay let's get rid of this

I guess that's not

no

hey let's let's get up this so I can be

safe and then there's a walk off the

platform that was

that was stupid

I have this silly tag on my channel I

don't have a stupid bag

I'm trying to imagine Spanish words with

your accent

okay write me a Spanish sentence

and I'll read it out

especially sentence that is indeed of

course

he can confirm

I mean

obviously it's not enough

like

okay can I do this

nope

nope nope

I just wow

right into that

thank you

Espanol

is

wait a minute

foreign

that's my Spanish

actually there is one level in class

three that's

uh

right when I got you telling me

okay

weren't so weird

no worse than normal

there you go

do you like my Spanish

do I even have anything I did

well

hey

that didn't happen

midnight

okay so my idea was that I'll go here

take a pick up the gem and then die

all right I'm off to bed is oh my Thirty

that's

you're a plate

good night Siri I'm happy you stayed

here I'm happy for you follow

in Polish My Scene yes

that's my polish pronunciation

let's see if I can do this

hey see ya bye bye

I think it need to be more careful yeah

candidate

cow

and then I can make it a bit safer

like that

I should have made it a bit safer

and I like making that

primary attempts will this take

[ __ ]

be a bit smarter

since I have the best and

everyone who gets to this level must

have been shooting

no

it must have partly been designed around

it

there we go

perfect

oh no

are you we need to try finish sentence

yeah sure I can do that as long as it

doesn't say anything

a little weird here

this is a new power up in this game

completely useless use like three times

throughout the whole game

there you go stupid boxes

finish okay

um

that's my finish

out

we are protected by dancing

there you go now I just need to focus on

this one

no

judge my pronunciation

not much for being safe this is just a

Green Path and I'm dying so much but I'm

getting far farther and further

each time

that is good

now I'm just continue

did it collide with the platform

yeah indeed

wow

sometimes you can see yeah how do you

like my finish

okay

a jump too high

I really try to be careful there but

this is a bit

too high

to be honest it was pretty good so it

sounded very hot yeah I mean

yeah I don't I don't know finish like

intonation

emphasis and everything could be wrong

and also really it's the first time okay

that's my second attempt

foreign

yes

I never finished

foreign

Swedish also has some kind of word

I don't remember what

it's not the word you should use

that is the common switch vertices draw

okay

but

it is a little bit damage from that

another word you could wait

you're apparently not allowed to stop on

us

doesn't mean

I wanted the stock team

reposition my feelings

smoke is the Polish word for Dragon

and in Spanish it's something like el

dragon

foreign

again

good thing they have still

boxes here please don't jump

but I still didn't make this sound as if

they were jumping

okay this is how far I got last time and

I think the platform is up there

smoky in polarized in Polish is purified

Smoky is plural for the policy right

fresh looking smooth and singing

all right what

now I was just standing slightly too far

away

I wish it like

it could stop on it

okay

seriously

making cute

like

why did I have to sleep off platforms

they make the platform look bigger with

the blue edges but those apparently not

part of the platform

annoying

here we just wear multiple dragons so

crashes too well shifted

no I just I don't know if I'm going to

jump

public animal

but this I need to get rid of

it okay

I died at those over at those things too

twice now first thanks for falling off

the platform

let's see if I can do it

now I know what not to do

so let's see if I can

do what I'm supposed to do

okay so I'm gonna studying no it's

actually close enough

go

again I did it again

I have selected discuss like game design

for example if you make a platform that

if you stand on it you will slip off but

you're meant to stand on the platform

like there's no reason for why you sh

like game TV is why you should sleep off

the edge

having an edge that you sleep because it

sounds like sleepy slippers as a

slippery slope

and it's just an element that will

annoying thing is and it shouldn't have

as part of the game

anyway

that is a kiss

I didn't know this was

it's

uh it's a

DPS third person shooting

I always show the shooting

apparently the signs are certainly

because you can

just have a spot

they yeah it's just annoying it

it is like that

even is not having two details

there you go yes

oh this is

say sorry rocking man I didn't even

realize you over here

playing Crash of DP

wow I was walking to the side how did I

get damage this game is so bad

I can't wait to be killed down with this

level

okay I am here now

I can

and detention area is angled

yeah I mean yeah I said they should just

not have it okay

I would just do that then

you know what

I will take out YouTube

when you go further she might just be me

missy

and like this this speed is moving when

you just

want to move one

it doesn't matter if I used to stick but

I guess

stick is

well

um I I just don't want to jump every

time immediately but I end this this get

a minimum

if that was close

and then get these two

here we go oh is this one I said it was

going to be like

no all five other gems

can I get I got the gym now to finish

the level normally

okay

and I'll check that

I I I buy crash colors crash of DDT

I get the feel they wanted to angle the

size so it's more stylized and might

have used the same modern as the hip-hop

might have been why should she keep the

more simple box

like it pops that would also I hope to

play yeah yeah exactly the the actual

ground Heat box you just extend across

blue one

the edges

yeah

I mean

I do I do feel like this game

is more style over gameplay

I feel like they've sacrificed a lot of

I just wanted

okay

just want to make sure

because they're very a lot of elements

there

um

there's also the potential answer of

them wanting working hours

I mean yeah I guess

well

I wasn't prepared for that one

let's shoot that thing

oh yeah I can't

yeah 100 fights 55 out of 155

I got it I got everything

nice

[Music]

I think I got every Gem and Crystal now

on the

25 first levels

so let's try and try the boss

the final boss

not only have you collected all the

crystals in record time

me be the first ones to congratulate you

by pummeling your sad Bandicoot frame

into a oh

uh yeah I want to fight you crunch

I don't think I will be allowed to I'm

great

well well

where's that

oh wait

we had

I see I remember how to do this

that's a hydrate

yeah let's

let's put on some more as athletic for

this

and then you shoot him

and then he gets mad

and punches cortex the point is there no

Health party

oops

the one I shouldn't have walked into ah

don't shoot him again I shot him

why does he get so tired of pressing

buttons

there you go

oh

let me ask you to comments hey

man

might cause both that and make it a

little bit more difficult at some of the

artists actually ones I mean I don't

mind like smaller platforms at least

by the way your categories are oh oops

are probably the title and everything

yeah because I got late

uh

it is Art actually

done hey thanks for letting me know

I mean he does

long jumps to press the oh yeah he does

he does do quite some long jumps to

press those buttons but yeah that that

it is it is a really strong jump he does

let me stream

is it

is there any point he jumps

between those two fathers furthest

but I found aestheticity

where are these two

but he gets tired after a while

standing there

[Music]

[Music]

okay

time to win this

yes

go go pumpkin

oh take it easy with eyes

but

I realized too late

and I press the jump but too late

I was very close to me get out of that

one

okay

so this is the Earth's power

and then there's the ice power

what's the last mask

and I'm

against the wind power yes

this is the pioneer

there is

eyes

and what I can

the only one the reason why I forgot the

last one is because the last wind power

doesn't really fit the type of attack

that is made

which we'll see now this is wind

this is this isn't really wind a wind

that has lasers

well almost walked into that one

thank you

is that on

nope

boy

is that on no

way

that's on

[Music]

what's another one

nice yes

what kind of defeat was that

it shoots

crunch a few times punches

may have collected all the crystals but

he doesn't have the gems with the gems

we can Resurrect The Masks one last time

and destroy

spider what are you talking about the

American last person went

thank you

it must swear they

I I saw them they were attacking me hmm

no high pouch as and Sandra commonly

understood yeah that's true that could

be that could be Sunday what exactly you

seen

I'm trying to think what was the

what was the boss span

the wind boss battle

the Earth one where I remember

and the water one

the fire yeah the fire this one which

was very similar to the ass

in that post Fire and Ice seems to have

rocks that are on fire

and uh

and then

yeah they win one was a large Monster

shooting

lasers Lightnings I guess like lightning

it is lightning yeah

it was shooting a lot of weird things

nine is typically associated with that

yeah

this is another

come

a completionist that's a nice this is

not a completion is anything yep

do we want to watch the credits no other

things

I have plastic minutes no you don't

answer I found this kit button

all is well

so

yes that was yesterday

regular

25 crystals

now

body times

let's just hopefully be really quick

because it's time to change

so I will just rush through everything

[Music]

but basically describing what the

temperature is

no I wanted that one

no I want that one too

I think that one is one

not much time I wasted on that

foreign

box in my way

okay

that went pretty well

I'd say

like that yes

I did that

jump up jump to the wrong one

I press I press the slide nothing

happened

okay

I didn't expect

to be fair I do think for this being a

the very first level of Crash it is

actually kinda

it is kind of difficult

oh I jumped away

that yeah that but that's another option

and and music doesn't you

again no slide

even twice today

and

this time I'll do it now I have

everything planned out

I should

sometimes that time I might not have

again

no slight sometimes it doesn't do a

slight

and this is supposed to be I am running

running on Jenny

play season three

with proper backwards compatible with

PlayStation team

there's not like

emulation issues or anything

others sometimes

a game of trouble remembering in

Malaysian and genuine Hardware

yeah

that give me anything nope

strong way

I got it I got it

hopefully future level doesn't require

that money in the hits

like this level should hopefully just be

quick

and easy

[Music]

oh there it is

I'm gonna shoot all right I don't press

the [ __ ] button

which one is

how close do I need to be before it

starts hitting

all right just I didn't realize that

this this level actually has

the primers like that I don't see first

she has that

serious science

and also that they take the opponents

take more than one hits to shoot them

foreign

and almost one second

let's build

that was easy let's sound effective

right here machine can

um yeah

[Music]

hopefully more levels go by like quickly

like bamboo seeds

which is an interesting lemon there

yeah I think this one should be really

quick because

and just go full speeds

nice nice start

it's a time oh

I missed the one I need it

we are fly away so did I just miss it

no way that wasn't there

that's why I ever played this level

let's see if I can remember feet

all right all right I missed so many

times

thank you

now let's see

these are the paths with

the the explosions this pass instead has

now

don't mix the gold

but

it's so hard to tell if that's blue or

white

it's like it's like a color between

[Music]

wow do I need to be that much quicker

yeah because I basically need girls

the blue the blue in this game so it's

so white so

I guess if it's hard to tell it is white

no experiment

but if it's clearly White

it's white or salty

okay start

I'll wake up a bit in the start and then

go

really

foreign

boxes after that scene

oh yeah that's how you do it uh but I

barely got any speed

uh now I'm I missed the sleeve I took

the one

keep me thinking

foreign

[Music]

how can I be so much

in the 35 seconds

that's so quick

you must be able to skip like this

oh yeah

and of course it was the three is fine

and

which

must be another landscape

let me sleep hey it's segment speed

what's this

now

and honest I can't take that I've always

said five seconds security

but

thank you

damn practice

don't even do it

oh come on come on

this one

come out hours

do we do any goals to

because that case I think you have a

better time with upscape parts in them

yeah

foreign

yes

but somewhere this

is this this one part of the level

that's like

this is this one what

what is this part for

foreign

and then I keep forgetting like that one

and I'm starting to learn where this

stuff is

that this seems like serious be a trick

to this I miss out on a lot of the timer

stops

we have it's because there is a

suspicious platform and I'm thinking is

this like a

major levels the major skip back in

there or something

this is this

this runs terrible at the moment

because it is very suspicious

like

it doesn't leave them away

yeah and you can't get them yeah no

matter what time so what's the point of

this area

anyway I had that icing

sunset for me

I don't need to bother about that thing

then

you'd seem to get tired of my mind

okay

just need to remember where

these things are

keeping that

was the timing with that one is always

so I can I should have checked that one

I forgot about that

thank you

then try to get in the middle and then

all right together

right side and then lost all the speed

and he said five seconds

and then on right side and then

on the right side

I'm at left side right side I went

around the dancing I got a bad timing

but

okay I kinda have it

just need to do it

seven next Surplus

I'm very close to getting this thing

I don't know we should first restarting

that

there's nothing that really shows me

which position is in when I start

annoying

and then again

okay this run is terrible

let me ask check what's up here

okay so I might need to get that

question is just is it worth the waiting

for it

it's a slightly just missing

even though it's not too great

always missing that one

thank you

okay

here we go

come out

okay I'll I'll see

oh

enough's gone off anyway

I've got two seconds

man remember that one

but it's always says five seconds now

but

it's a

personal best at least

35 seconds that's

hey

hey

thank you

it was so nicely drawn by

and they go to

bye

meditation about page

and I think they made it a very nice and

cute bunny I'm very happy with the

results

and they can even do different outfits

oh I can't be stuck on this level

anyway it's not like secret boost button

I can place like inspire

D okay

now the time is back

once

then let me step one

oh this is

I'm gonna miss that one

and let me see the list

okay living stage

yeah

yeah I don't think I'm not I'm going to

get this code

so I always go off because you have to

be for flat there must be some other

solution I this can't be the solution

certainly funky because sure I'm missing

a few boxes but

but is it really

it's really eight seconds of box is

amazing

because if I can't get built I'm I'm

comforted I can't complete the game

and if I can't complete the game

yeah

and also there is the way you can't see

what the position of this is kind of

ruining the whole time

okay

now I'm missing everything

yeah I'm trying to be fast now just to

see and what's the end time I get and I

will count then once I missed I missed

three seconds so far

and see if I've subtract those just that

big nothing 35 seconds so if I were to

do it properly and get things

I guess five seconds

let's skip this okay that's that's the

stopping

ah come on

I didn't mean to skip that but that was

two seconds because

that's

I know so five plus five ten seconds

totally

yeah and then I have to wait for DC

there is another way but

[Music]

and then I missed that but

I guess it's uh it's uh I'll pass it

like 47 or something so subtract 10

seconds that's 37 so sure if I get like

every single box

including a good timing with the uh

the military lift

it might be possible

considering it's in different position

every time you start it's not it doesn't

have a specific start position

or rather it continues from where it

left off

and

turn it to check how some other person

got the black and I'm only seven

maybe I have to do that

take a visit to YouTube

just to see how they

they did it

okay

maybe I just need to be inhuman

foreign

yes and I missed it too

now okay so it is possible I'm so it is

possible everybody say I'm planning no

mistakes and they always need to sync up

yesterday exactly so if I just wasn't

that sloppy at the end

that this will work

okay I can do it

I can do this

I wanted to get like

maybe I need to get hired

starting speed like half the clock

I said I still must time that

keep missing that one

thank you

yeah I don't remember gold another level

speaking this

This Heart

it sounds like it's a platinum time

and Platinum Platinum

Yep this isn't a good night

do you think they think my name is made

this

I don't see this thing

but that that's the really that that is

the part that really confused me a bit

because suddenly they must have tested

this game

maybe they haven't maybe that's the

issue and they must have therefore

because they have developer times from

time to run haven't they like started

this level and then realized

the way you can't see where it's which

position the elevator is when you start

a time trial is very annoying shouldn't

we do something about that nah let's not

do something about that that's just part

of the fun

thank you

come on

well this is a practice run

this is a messed up man

it just works

it works is yeah I mean

I keep missing that it must become

okay I'm very very stuck come on my

Instagram

oh I need to bounce over it did I just

miss it

this this one is in sync every time

that I keep

so I stopped messing up on that one

then I need to leave this one right

like that

uh no speed

no don't miss any yeah I'm missing

everything now

um

there's this past too but it's probably

not clicking

time test accidents

I started such as one take long how it's

going still on the same level yeah just

this this level is too hard they should

put it 40 seconds never gotten it now I

see yeah get like

question you have had the Todd Howard

sound nope

nope I quit I assume that was question

but question if y'all if only you could

make a clip of that

of what

and my team

you can make it

I missed it

this is going terribly and I'm expecting

I'm a territory Howard

how the challenge sign when it's been

away

it was wicked to fall down any busting

stuff

which button to restart

actually but when you said it won't take

long or maybe a month

I made one

it was way too annoying

because the video editor I have it does

not

for some reason except

the eclipse

a campus app

uh just that is summer crash games you

can't spray some this one I can

keeping that

at least there's invisible walls they

could have put action once there and why

did I skip that one

like

the uh

platform that lives goes up next to

they could just put a wall there and

then on the side of the elevator but you

have to wait to go down

you can just put that one on the

elevator something making it an LG

anyway

the sign aside

I'm missing everything

now

keep doing that

actually probably said

I already read that one

um

sure I could

it may be

if

it accepts accepts the whole video in

the editor I could do it

but

yeah if it doesn't

I can't bother

I got a lot of videos

look at me I am trying I am trying this

is exciting I hope it's exciting

pressing up

okay this

train timing

and then I need to go nope

foreign

okay stop bouncing uh keep missing

things

I keep missing everything now and I'm

running stairs okay there is one idea I

could do that I could do the level the

level

we skip that

I just need to land on the ramp

so I have

the momentum

oh nice just

just

oh that was close

it wasn't quick that's

weird question

like how is

I guess my this speed it takes for me to

consider that is different each time

and then I nope that was a bad landing

laughs

let me just have to wait for this thing

to chest over

35 seconds

no it's still not the best way here but

it is good I just I just need

to pay less

and just

just need to fail yes

I just need to feel this I say

yeah I felt like it was possible but

it's nothing feeling it's not possible

anymore

thank you

bad timing with that

I'm feeling a bit

not nice at least it's time to add

something to go there

perfect timing

okay let's try to where's my Center mess

up

look at that

ah

it feels like I'm never miss those boxes

and this time I missed both

I guess I got

too excited

yeah I'm now missing everything

of course I get a good time with that

one also

foreign

but yeah but I just

if I go really really quickly there

I might

I might be able to skip the whole jump

as jump yeah

yeah instead of landing on the ramp up I

might be able to Land close to the top

so I don't have to go up the

oh crap

because that man that that might

actually be an option because this is my

best time so I it is very very close

36 36 it's a one and a half second

clicking

I can if I just didn't mess up on just a

single one of the two of those boxing

it is it I would have had it at that

point

yeah

yeah

sure sure let's do that then

then when I get to that point I just

send it

now it was it was a good wonderful ones

apparently said a lot of level looks the

same so

many where I should

do what can we tricky

foreign

a bit of a wrong direction I didn't want

to go up f okay and I missed the three

I mean it can

work

just need to do it a little bit better

like that

foreign

[Music]

because they have decided to have which

I mentioned before but

they have

convex with sticks meaning that your

finger cannot rest

like

this

stick on it

they have this rubber thing on top of it

just give you extra grip

to compensate for the band sign

but

that's just

that doesn't fix the issue that just try

to find a solution instead of actually

fixing the issue

and I do prefer the Xbox controller

because they have corn mix sticks

meaning that you think there's some goes

into the sticks

they have tried to do that with

depression or I think would have they

still convex but they have put a bit of

an edge to it but again

trying to trying to find ads

hey

trying to find the uh what did I call it

again

instead of fixing the actual problem

they just add something another thing to

it

I think yeah

it'd be nice if they just fixed the

issue decorations then

it doesn't matter I'm using this is

controlling and whatever they do with

the next controllers and it's not going

to be

unless

the controller

is backwards compatible

oh I keep missing

okay here's this area I can sleep

practicing this

but

we're going the wrong direction

I'm doing so badly at the moment hey

just glue right here

right a rifle tricky on it

I mean

sure I could he I mean it's just not

sure what what you what's what that

thing is but the idea of putting

something that makes the gift better

that that is the solution

drill on top of it to make it

intended

oh

so

how long have been on this level now

sure I take that

this is what I was killing for it

oh

I've heard it is

the Hammond

oh

I mean yeah I'm not like

I don't know guns weapons

I don't even know if you got music right

there I don't know weaponry

I think I know what you mean but

it there is a chance that I don't

[Music]

know I can't

Batman

oh that's Peter still missed it

I don't think it's worth picking up I

missed it too

yeah if I got that too

and I miss the feeling

that wouldn't help

first time so thanks

bad timing

supposedly yeah

the Singapore

to make guns go boom

let's put

on the tree game

basically what do you have an Xbox

controller

that because I think

because I play some [ __ ] shifters and

once I remember when moving over to the

Xbox when they introduce

the

three years and that was an interesting

illusion

I remember that's being the button you

pressed for shooting

comparative previous games Amazons

always

joking try to connect it to gaming

I'm not gonna clean that one

this is a bad time it's now if I try to

take that one I don't get elevated

yes anyway let's see suppose near

monitor military service does teach

about some things

a tradition

foreign

I promise

I'm Gonna Miss A Team

let me start to

and I missed a second team and I've left

the level okay I was joking

I'll get it this time

I mean obviously I need a good lipstick

Those runs don't count

knows that I'll send my control

we could just restart that on that tune

they made it so

nice bounce the lift was on the ground

and starting moving up when you went on

top of it that would be nice see

when you pick up the timer it forces the

elevator to be in a specific position

that would work too

a child

we tried

and I missed

in my pain

could also try to go slowly

so instead of trying to

foreign

and then when I get it

we can celebrate

like I can

like I'm only planned for streaming for

three hours but I mean I have no

problems too much longer

there's some more day

yes so y'all can go see some more lemons

finish this game

foreign

it should force the both elevators to be

in a specific position

and but yeah that's it

not say that would up should apply to

every lemon every question really

anything that has what did they run

around it I mean function

or stem

have them skip to a position as soon as

they pick up the clock

notes about the clock thinking forcing

foreign

this level is mean to me

another service

12 minutes ago

I have hydrated now

this game also has a

an oversight

that yeah affect later lemons

in an annoying way

is that when you start the time trial

in the original game press three and in

the beginning

yeah

you lose the mask because of course you

need to start museums in this game you

don't

you can enter with

double mask and then start the time

trial and keep that

and obvious oversight

come on I was going so slow

oh

enemies system one but

okay this is quickly

[Music]

oh

so bad

and then it goes like that slow and I

still miss it

okay

yeah if the elevator always starts from

the same position at least

okay

because that was the whole discussion

about

one of them yeah

it was speed running regarding

I don't remember body shots

infinite I think

because you get random powerapps

and there's basically one power up early

in the game

that needs to be a specific one

we run to be the fastest

and

there was a discussion regarding about

modeling the game so you are forced to

get that specific power up as the first

power up because if you don't get that

power up

and the run is over and you have to

restart and instead of having to redo

the whole intro every time and get the

wrong man I have to restart

yeah you should just Mount the game

to get that as your first option

because it's just just such a waste of

time otherwise it's the art but

obviously counter argument is that that

beating

and that's not fair

being without it in my opinion

playing this game and getting torted by

the elevators I understand in one modern

arguments

because all other runs are just thrown

away

and this is such a waste of time it's

not a skilly thing

it just uh the game didn't give me 16 so

I have to restart

sure you can tell you that

every Power Up should be modded in that

case or something I don't know

so I've been thinking about this game

considering how you can

take to mask and at the start of every

time

that the game should be modded

so when you pick up the timer

instead of setting your mask to zero

like the previous King does it sets you

must continue it basically gives you two

months

and his friend is so sloppy I think I

need the the boxes at the top of the

elevator

they're basically have to

go through this

I need a good

I mean we I send it behind after it

yeah

[Music]

you can do it I can't do it I've been

here probably an hour now

that's crazy

I can't do it I'm not going to be able

to complete this game 100 because this

requirement for this level is just too

high I can't do it

this is this is the third level in the

whole game and these difficulties way

too high all of a sudden

the first two super easy this one

extremely hard

I'm Not Dead

honestly

crash four it's about time that is we

did spiritual timing trials those are

easier

this lemon

the level is easy this the time I need

to get

I'll drop the stick

at the moment

I missed it

and it might just be what I need

I got it

I didn't need that too I got it anyway

finally

finally I don't know how long that took

two hours but now that's right I went on

my stream at least one away

yeah you had to go 10 seconds faster for

the next level I'm not going to do that

how are you supposed to get 25s it's

such a strongly getting 35 seconds you

know

and everyone having ads

who missed it but uh

I need to take a very very short fake

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

well I did it

as ads I'm sorry for missing things

final but

[Music]

here we go

you're just eating a

this level is probably gonna be much

easier

[Music]

but a little snake in front of a whole

tomato

ES

and then

[Music]

whoever decided that it should take 25

seconds to get the Platinum really the

surface

that sounds terrible

yeah this level has been so much I mean

they can get into this

oh my

okay

back to the normal game

[Music]

Elsa when I did the two first you know

didn't even remember to run oh

it doesn't make me favorite oh it wasn't

bad

I don't remember

you fight

ran into first time

which is the latest power up

and

what

I missed that

all right so I'm pretty happy with being

able to get

girls without running oh

no get out of the way I'm

I'm running here

now

[Applause]

maybe I can

box in the way

does it count if the

Dragon fix it

nope

that I need to destroy them before it

can't

which my boxes get out of the way

no I missed it

[Music]

let's stuck behind the BAM

this one uh other level that's gonna

dark

get out of the way

hey

and it should hit at the most

inconvenient moments stuck in the bumper

to punch I guess what time it is

I mean

it sounds better than

Wings shouldn't it happen in the nice

moments not not many more than stuck

thank you

in traffic

[Music]

no don't get stuck behind the bad bad

I don't have time to say

the name of the item

That's how little you should get stuck

behind them

no

no don't get stuck again

no run straight to the neck

line destroy it

so is this possible that TNT won't count

I think

but that counts

okay

for the 40 seconds let's chat with me

because

I just need cheese it's not faint at the

end there

this should be doable

I think this is more about managing to

actually reach the end of the level

more than

getting a quick time

so if I just get

I think that's that's really the

difference

I complete these levels

so quickly that it is gone

whenever my history completed

but

I see the two and then I want to spin it

but I forget that it's over above again

my pattern

it's in a chicken party just get into

the girl more than okay

keep jumping

jumping at the wrong one

there you go

might need a head friend I just ran into

that one too

no see now I need to jump into that one

the one thing I shouldn't jump into

oh it actually starts to

oh yeah

I see

does it like

it doesn't seem to take good

yeah anyway

and then I wonder if it tries to take

into context the

situations

yeah yeah message was that's

allowed because he was using a bad word

specifically uh

okay I have set the up of the box to

though for my steps it doesn't like my

stuff yeah

but yeah if he is

if you use anything it's fine

misogynistic

or racist

so that therefore it's a bit

oh I just need one more second to do

that just need to stick I just need to

avoid just be losing too and try to keep

that funny friend didn't work while

using it from you don't have to keep it

family friendly this is an adult Channel

um

and after using a foreign language

uh

okay

it doesn't really make the time in front

I don't think

I mean I don't know

I got stuck behind it hey I put a base

for my life you don't have to apologize

and it was approved

the only thing the only reason why

the the reason why I set the outputs

that way is because I don't mind

like

so if there's any any swaying sexual or

stuff it's set to low

meaning that

you you it's fine if you do it

yeah I don't mind it because I said this

is a little Channel

uh it's just don't go way too far with

it

what do you think too a way too too much

yeah

a reasonable amount Maybe

and and it it's more proportionally to

how much you should do too so

comment all right come on there's too

many of them

you can have like one comment which has

more of it if you don't use it that much

outside of that

yeah

kitchen is like behind that

run trash

run like your life depends on it

yes see if I just get in the girl I get

the girl

so

but I have put the uh Miss Sony stick

and the racist stuff at High

because well I don't want he hate speech

that's okay

[Music]

and it specifically sunny and stuff but

but yeah that's

oh should I take another

one

let's take this one

why don't I have the

wait

we have it so I didn't wait

oh I should have taken the other way and

that way both had three seconds

foreign

crash

watch out

this is such a level where you can skip

everything

oh boy there you go that's what I want

well now let's let's

reality

hey crash those little crashing well

depending on who plays there could be a

lot of crashing

okay yes I'm supposed to take that one I

just need to watch out for the stuff

there you go

let's

maybe that path is lost during time

travel

and then I wanted to see

oh yeah it is definitely there's

definitely more there I just need to

watch our stuff first

okay

I don't have to angle it

and it's to the side like that

no

oh that wasn't to the side that was

above why can't I did you put it on the

bottom then to trick me of course

and then they got lots of fruits and and

start each time I start

tricky ones trying to fool me and I

succeeded

there we go

okay let's see okay there is a lot of

crashing when I play crash here slides

band it's like slight man

that one is like on the track

okay

let's go

uh I wanted to jump on the one behind

but it's fine

run crash run

it's okay

I want that now Jump On It

ah

I was almost out of it

but now

I failed

why are you standing here throwing those

things

into it under one minute

discount

are you able to play the Gameboy Advance

crash titles would they not run from it

I mean

I'll find a way

you guys not too far from

beautiful platinum everybody say because

this is all the same

I buy the same for that other thing the

other level I got to go hold on finally

that's five of them

I'm going to

now we can continue the next area

see no problem doing the other level

it's just that one boom Bolly level bone

but it caused me a lot of trouble okay

okay

yeah I wanted to play every crash game

every spider game so in

ITA was the best start ever including

the handheld so on the schedule

currently

I will

I will finish

Inspire hairstyle 100 sorry to see we

use time

it on Wednesday I will finish that game

we get 100 percent

Wednesday would become my

finished games 100 today or something

so if I don't finish crash

Raza cortex

100 percent

foreign

well I did it

I was gonna say did I have a mask I

can't see I put on their head one but

now I must be out of masks

it's a bit scary

so I don't like driving towards the

camera

yep

out of masks

that's about a little somebody jumped

the cap and I'm not competing Christ

next

slide button didn't work

but then it did work ah don't come out

with that

well I had a terrible around already

let's see what are these nothing

set asset SS shown

I start to start with the regular mask

but I really shouldn't be

now I had two masks so I just need to

keep it for this side one

second there we go

getting myself a chicken mask

the big game

okay I need that one two

foreign

boxes

I always feels like that

there we go did it again is it it's

because it's downhill

uh

I got them again

we got them again

same mistake again

I think it was the same thing again okay

no more drying

we're running

and here's the end oh don't get stuck

behind the box

run crash run

there you go girls please thank you

okay watch out for the unicorns yeah

they have one one so

[Music]

easy gold moving on to the next lemon

so yeah

this will be the very first game boy

game I would play on stream

but I'll see what I'll do it

how I should do that

do you view mines

okay

Trini

that's the hidden mask I should remember

I really like how it can get stuck and

stuff

wait I was supposed to go up

foreign

seconds back

they're using the same design for the

one you should go down in but you're not

supposed to go down in that one

it was three seconds

thank you

foreign

yeah

this might be the quickest way to move

forward plus it's an attack so

first parties when that happens I was

going to say when the attack ends

and I happen to be in front of an enemy

ah I moved up my

missing more boxes than last time

I guess that's a quick way to get

through

and this one actually fine

thanks

foreign

that one

what that one is white right

oh yeah yeah sorry of course is of

course he wanted to swimsuit in a lemon

look at that look

I I take it but that was not a good run

foreign

between events

horses with spear sips on the heads yep

that's

I don't know what level good afternoon

hello welcome welcome I'm happy happy to

see you here

always good to see you here

should spam calls interrupting my nerves

some stupid spam cars Interruption yeah

I haven't gotten a Spam call probably

since last year I don't know

it was so weird

because they haven't paid for the use of

my phone has not been saying maybe

yeah I mean yeah

yeah

so

but no one is knocked on my door and not

tried to send me anything I need

foreign

yeah I kind of feel like but because

considering it that's yeah I fully

understand that

I believe a plasma yeah I don't know I I

have no idea how I managed to get that

it wasn't even a good run and yeah Coke

11.

it is the code I think the swimsuit

works but it's level two

and Coca connector around it's the only

power-ups you can use

all right can ignore this one

okay maybe I shouldn't ignore the first

one I I didn't expect a box this early

to be a timing

fish

a stupid red fish which I don't know

what's

it's probably a coin

come on fish

but yeah

regarding the restart restarting

timer and such boy

oh wait I'm supposed to do this yeah

that would also apply to

jump the jumping fish and stuff

oh wait don't ignore that one

no that was

a stupid fish always this stupid fish

uh hello astral

I hate when coach jumps and bite my

ankles

[Music]

yeah

but I assuming the seam of December that

would koi

but

I don't know fish species so I can't say

for certain

I think

and that is

another gameplay difference between

crash and

because I mentioned that to one person

and that

I actually can't come on champion

how I don't like having crash you can

take damage from walking into the

enemies

it's mostly trash

it's about time when you use the slow-mo

mode

wow

without them actually doing the attack

yeah to still take damage from them

the person said that that's that's just

how it works in video games and that she

had a double Jam I could do this

but no it doesn't work like that inspire

inspire you can touch enemies without

taking damage only if they attack you

you take damage

foreign

well in that case they're crayfish my

mom has a crayfish

koi fish tuna fish

I mean yeah it had tuna in Swedish is

tone face which contains the word fish

which means fish

tone I actually don't know it's probably

a cognate with English tuna but it also

in is

the same as the switch where tone

well it's the same a it's a Hispanic

pronunciation

eh

which means tone

fish

running

foreign

[Music]

a bit more

don't get stuck on the geometry

uh this is Bishop is maybe the fish

didn't attack me then they can go and

jump somewhere else

you can tune a piano but you can't tune

fish

what do you want to say

why do you write tuna

you can't tune up it I see what the

I destroyed those in the wrong order

I see what you did there I just said it

wrong

how silly of me

oh that's defined

we can tune a guitar and you can tune a

piano but you can't tune a fish

that is answering

kitten is hiding in the burner Barrel

again

the kitten is just looking out

to see what's going on

upon is getting destroyed by time trials

[Music]

good

morning

it will be quicker to waste a mask and

destroy the TNT but

why would waste uh well

and then that happened

I would waste a mask which I just did

I don't like that platform because if I

run off it I'm in the air and therefore

can't jump

I want to play between each attack no

it's wrong box

um

your chest likes to tell her that shits

thank you sometimes their jokes are the

best jokes

sometimes yeah

if I run run past them

awesome bye

so

I mean

I'm out for puns I'm fun fun and

apparently don't jump high enough for

that

wow

all right

man I ran into that one

oh

bounce stuff like that one

[Music]

hey there we go

okay what's the point of Supply if you

can just jump oh wait

no

it's a good stuck again what is with

this level

I went to the pet shop to buy a bird

cage I asked the associate if this one

contained a nickel or not Associates

said no it has no nickel I said so it's

a Nicholas Cage

the office

I only finished the original trilogy

never finished the PS3 question

well I will do that

I will do

what choice

there is a challenge

[Music]

missing the windows I just I only

complete this level I'm very close with

you again

just

need to stop inhaling and the level

geometry change needs to stop finding me

as well

75

what do you call a fish wearing a bow

tie sophisticated

the fish sticking I see

I am enjoying them through you just like

the spider game yeah you can see you can

see how they

I mean I

you can also see how tricky they can be

so yeah I mean

but I needed time trams to get to do

extra lemons

let's say I do the extra levels but

since I got a lot of people here

um

easiest is just check this schedule on

Twitch if you are on desktop it's just

it's just the

current URL

push.tv slash

and then you just put slash and schedule

that will and then if you check Sunday

there should be yeah

I keep slipping up

they might be um

and

they should be a stream

they would have been our stream uh I

might do a live stream I'm not sure

about that one

and but but that one is short day and

then

it's a stream after that one which will

be a collab

and

and it's also it does appears if you go

team

my Discord

under the schedule challenge Channel The

Challenge

that it should be listed there as well

so it will be on Sunday

it will be 16 o'clock UTC

if you know you're upset

you can calculate it

so that would be 17 Western and the

Europe UK time

18 Central 19 Eastern

nice jumping

other times around the world

yeah I don't know okay

because I don't know what the

offset is

oh I'm gonna do that

I got a rabbit pickup line oh you are

irresistible right are you trying to

compliment me

yeah I need a hydrates also the swimsuit

time is over even the

there's a lot of work jumping into what

hey

in this level

come on come on Pom-Pom you can do it

but yeah the

fish was about to jump down

[Music]

the ears is quite a big part of Pom-Pom

so

understandable that her ears

speaks to you

you don't really do that

okay come on koi fish

I saw you land therefore saved me to

jump

and land there

don't jump

on that jump on that

jumping that no double jump okay

come on

hey

attack but no it just bounced off

because that's apparently a scene

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

if you have girl you can send it to me

because it's it's made in carrots

it's the uh

yeah nice keeping stock and geometry

and this in this this this bunny likes

percentages

and not carrots

[Music]

hey

are really cute you're really cute early

kids

should be called erish

him

which

I wish someone was was available as a

place

we have fun fun with some company to

um

[Music]

plushies

those Es are going to be nice blanket

I saw the attack

thank you

[Music]

you know what

because I keep failing at

this level constantly let's start with a

mask instead

because I'm allowed to do that I wasn't

allowed to jump into the water this time

shouldn't it I thought it was supposed

to same

um

there we go

apparently I can't stop it too

this game only allows you to start with

one let's change that in in the remake

it would get stuck behind the chat and

that is yeah

that's why I want to go with him a bit

girl

you jump too far but would be adorable

yeah and that one's like

uh

you can change your outfit

to becoming a dress and a swimsuit Maybe

and the sports way

[Music]

[Music]

wasting a bit of time there but at least

I'm getting the complete lemon

let me get this one

not jump on me

it sounds like this game actually starts

the timing

which a remake doesn't it which I find

out

remix

by

okay there is some invisible wall you're

not allowed to jump on that thing until

you make a high jump over

he didn't detect

and a cheerleader outfit yes that that

would be amazing

hey let's fund that which company can

make it and it should be a large one

pump I'm singing like

I'm thinking

a hundred centimeters on

would be like big cuddly size

it makes it also

I don't know

okay yeah you might even be able to just

buy clothes from the store to give her a

nice one

why can I jump down that one I said

and why does the I haven't considered

that before but the timer crates changes

from wooden traits to metal crates

but despite being a metal face you can

distort them like them or when it rates

keep doing that

I certainly can't be because making it

more legal maybe maybe that is a reason

to make no Riddle but because they have

boxes with question marks on and boxes

with lights on and they do have a

actual wooden design for The Masks which

doesn't have these

that happened

[Music]

75

that happens too

and of course test happens when

I lost them anymore

why are you blushing me a Rocket Man

wouldn't

do you want that wonton place

flashing

start getting stuck there

and I lost the mask again

[Music]

land it

[Music]

foreign

well finally and I got gold yes I like

God the time creates looks like question

blocks from Super Mario

I guess so let's pick the random email

she didn't know this was a blushing one

all right

now you're blushing

you like the idea of

here's a good one too

he liked the idea of having a fun Pon

blessing

that's something feeling I have a bad

feeling about this one

she will come with her nice pink dress

okay where's the

wow there it was

okay

okay

thank you

yeah if if the things went suicidal in

this level this would be much easier

and

how am I supposed to get this one and

this is like straight into me that's not

really crazy

this one

I don't remember how many times have she

cheated

that was enough

[Music]

do you go

girls please

it's nothing White

that wasn't even a good shot

aside when I first failed that was the

first time I completed I mean I guess

that was

I'll take it I better go and save again

I was gonna say this is going to be on 9

11. it is an annoying level but then

when I do that

and then I joined you that

all right this is

the one

if I picked up some time boxes during

the Run

how did wait

well

thank you

headphone cable has managed to get

entangled

yeah I should probably

it stopped it got stuck in something

okay so I go down

and then I'm basically shoot

with two water left um under the water

level in the same

Amigo apparently come on what's up with

the bridge for that one

[Music]

thank you

you need to make sure I can there we go

a tiny tiny fish is destroy the whole

thing it doesn't make any sense what's

the point of this scene

foreign

thank you

this is nice they can't shoot today

thank you

that's wrong hey

start today

well

that was this one

I had to avoid it

I wasn't even touching that one

how about making hitboxes activity

models

okay

did I see it or maybe that is a

possibility

would see

I get I get that using like box

Collision or something is cheap way

performance wise

but

it just makes it such a worse gaming

experience

got another watches today

I'm surprised

when it wasn't rain of course but

but I think it was like down to end or

something but now it's up to 15. then

welcome everyone

no hello Astron welcome

and yes I know I'm a horrible person

making such a junk nah

you're in fact

okay maybe we are what

we haven't even gotten fast yeah this is

not yeah no remember this is not like a

full under what level it's just

underwater first section

and then it's on land they just have to

guess 30 seconds

foreign

I really want to see the collisions

and stuff

wait a minute

I don't have a mask

wait is there a mask before

wait I did have a bus because I had it

from the previous Island

now

but because I keep getting destroyed

just pay some lives

to get that mask

I got some to spray

oh yeah swimsuit it's a good it's a good

one

foreign

they just couldn't handle pressure

yeah I think that's that's exactly

where's my oh yeah I have a mask let me

explain

I didn't hear sound funny

and then when you're watching pump on

streams you can bring your Quantum Flash

okay

and then there's this one

okay now I had to issue but in that case

you get to keep this mask which is a

good thing

now I had two masks

yeah is this kind of lemon

now

ah I miss it again

can I slide down there yes

all right I got the last pack

landing on the method

another cake

wanna fish have to watch me

I was what's with that one

let me through

you can have a surprisingly short level

it just took took one minute seven

seconds to get through the whole lemon

plus time stops

oops

but look at this it's a blue one that

means I have two level seven six

oh my

God that means I had to do at least the

one minute exactly

[Music]

the relax has happened

he unlocked the relay

yeah once it's really like to be a scene

because it was a funny idea

the question is should we have free

unlocked

uh yeah no starting

I mean is this quick if you just take

damage for me to kiss but

I had to move all the way up to the edge

how should I do this quick game

well I did miss a few boxes I guess

I got that one

Don't Shoot Me

can I see I see you can stack one

three seconds that helps

what

I missed some of those

let me start sweet as well this might

help

[ __ ] okay don't take

I don't know just

rush through that there you go under one

minute that is gold

yeah that doesn't look like water it was

electrified

[Music]

well at least there's no time to have

some bosses there would be something

plus it's a two channels to have time

chance

but these 10 of them

cortex PP what

excuse me

is this this is another ball rolling one

hopefully the timer isn't best

[Music]

no it wasn't good

cute

mask

wait does

wait is there nobody Set Me Down

yes there are

I missed the one I wanted

no

no inside it

that's how I did

foreign

if

no Java jump I should have done it on

the teeth pounds

it's this was a piece of water

and this looks like a torture it's

actually it's Russia actually pretty

nice

but I just realized one thing

it's pretty nice seven

probably pick up something

we can do this without losing too many

lives

but yeah this is another change in this

game is that it doesn't seem to remember

how many times he died with a pi

checkpoint

uh

so you get the

mask

this

but next time I enter this level it's

not going to remember that but the

previous game indeed

take it

don't leave it behind

keep

not jumping

that's actually

oh yeah that works

oh good timing once

that's that's bad

then I try to keep like that

I need to get ah

please

no

yeah can you go up today thank you

I have I have somewhere TV

oh sorry uh I didn't bring a full

message because it has a design break

and then puts a single word in the next

line

this looks like a tortured chamber is

what you wrote that however is something

I might agreement

it looks like a combination of traps and

touching

it's and that's that's what they do in

the country

on 50.

okay yeah I can just thumb down

that's so close to kill you

yeah uh my

uh

what's kind of yeah the controls up

there I don't need sometimes

and wait a minute this is can I campus

restart and just keep the mask

that

that's definitely interesting

hmm

can I I might be able to get over there

with the

wait a minute

it's my mask

so if you press restart

clear sometimes I've died

what a terrible game this is

I've ever said this game is terrible

like why him like this

oh bye

I guess I just have to dab don't press

restart if you don't throw during this

treatment

just pounce on it

thank you

go

hurry hurry don't get that Captain Nick

oh my gosh

then bounce um

when I move on

move in thank you

uh

whether I ignore those but that might be

fine

look at this

I know it does without my [ __ ] okay

look at this one

if it's all the white

come to the same

foreign

[Music]

the benefit of immediately see this game

has cocoa faces

you just take some while to get this

Mass

Ive

when games put enemies before

talk

so when you try to get a clock you die

if you don't pay attention

yeah

double mask

perfect

I just save it once

you know attack happens

well I died

and I get to keep a mask here

well that was silly I lost the mask

between the time first time

and I it's so dark in there seconds

yeah it's it's that

before you can give it a second attack

you can't find it

timing so long

let's take a happy

attack Point early if I attack now it

breaks

yeah I didn't mean to do that missed

time tiny

grandchildren

tricky

he fell off

that's it no attack that time

I'm joking

okay how was it now

yeah there we go

okay

through the gate

and

to it again

it's a good time

it is a good time

yeah hey gracious pushes Coco out of the

way it still stink rally Kim

takes it for himself

but it saved that one too

it's gonna going pretty well at the

moment

[Music]

my best time I'm not going for platinum

hey someone said that the times of these

levels aren't really they had really

cons uh

tested them well enough so they the

times I kind of random that's why they

are surrounded to to like 10 seconds

and why some levels are so easy to get

laughing at two this one get out of my

way

that's it

can you just

live

why aren't why are the boxes normal

this makes no sense

they don't contain anything but why are

they accepted timed boxes them like

why are the other boxes online

and and I remember not to slide too far

like question mark box that should exist

yeah this this lemon is being

can you just get out of my way

I'm trying to get a good time here nice

jumper like

and I got an extra life during a tank

trail that doesn't make any sometimes

yeah can can the time I stop when I

cross the finish line

and I take that

single try no that's just a completely

they definitely didn't test the type

that hamster bar maybe that's but that's

the thing when I'm in yeah there we go

when I mentioned the uh how how would

they get frustrated about not knowing

the position of the elevator in that

level when I start a time trial they

clearly haven't done any time trends

they just still set the times and then

just

and push the game out

okay

put something I didn't know

yay celebrations

I'm 40 minutes over time

but

it's going so well at the moment

okay this one should hopefully not be as

a stranger other one as I've gotten

Latina on every single one in this world

so far

now oh I miss those

come on question is basically to take

out the name is annoying

oops

at least yeah

yeah

that's a good thing welcome leaky fights

and uh did you did you sit through my

torture before

but

happy to see you here

you still like the name

fine

I am alive

yeah I just falling down that that

amount

yeah

I don't think that I

must sing this

kind of lemon

a little bit longer

get out of my way

are you not going to move on that

not great card

I think the prime minimum

if it comes I will stand there and look

straight to me

that's that's my

Then I then I feel like I've done my end

of the deal

I did that again and again the question

marks practice on this lemon tea yeah I

was like anything

you're welcome

appreciate some good listenings

okay I mean that that was pretty quick I

didn't get the boxes but

instead of slowly going soon I'm

connecting the boxes I went quickly too

and

I will keep more tourists oh yeah that's

the ramp

and that's nothing

okay I kind of need to play

those ships are

nowhere not to go

all right yeah that's how you do it

I guess there's that much

find boxes on that thing anyway

and then I

you know see missing that one okay at

least oh no

I panicked

okay I see how I should do this

vegetables stuck in this level fine

I miss those again

okay

it's a bounced up anyway

there you go

then I should go up here

well it was killed

now

I think it's stuck I wanted

what don't not eat that one

oh

I didn't want that

can it

there we go that's what I wanted

can I get the

yes

yes

looking at Panic books yeah straight

into the lava five feet

get a pizza anyway

traps probably

keep the Bandicoot out

bandicoots first who has for some reason

decided

I got pushed down that for some reason

decided to go with the ball

I don't know what I'm saying

but I really should go like this

not like that

doing everything

like this

I'm not like that

definitely not my thing

so you can be sure anything

okay

no no

if this was golf this would be amazing I

mean that's not the end of being

obviously

so that was actually timer like

I've gotten in there

oh

no uh there we go

I only get it give me a few more

attempts out I'll get it

don't even know

the level itself is kind of tricky I

guess that's why the previous spawn

level has such

a short time

because it didn't really have any

dangers and stuff

so you would just go full speed

throughout 11 without worrying

nothing that's stopping

but this level has a lot of dangers

in this stuff

no I got it's a bit stuck inside

sometimes he

sometimes it's easy to move sometimes

really slowly

and I get that of course

if you see moving in One Direction

trying to unless I mean stuff was slow

down but I was like

you have to slowing down I meant to say

but yeah

obviously

if it's it's if there's a hill we have

to climb up but that's also slow

but sometimes it just feels like it's

flat ground it's probably a simple

background that's probably why

oh

I didn't think that those were dangerous

and going to destroy you because

they kill you outside the ball but

this time there minor inconvenience

oh

okay let me get the trust here

and avoiding those

and this time the nuts gets great

let's go

and I'm going to ignore that ramp

yeah

and this time I should not fall down

because

it needs to be again up here to get out

of here

and now here we go there it is I just

randomly fell into it

wait

it's hard to see the color it is kind of

blue

way to have to retrieve this I mean I

did miss a lot

yeah explains this is fortified

uh six cents away from girls yeah

Crusher said

but I can't do it it's just they just

need to be a slightly faster

[Music]

slightly slightly faster

and like yeah one extra time box or

something I mean it was kind of fast

anyway but

the problem was that I kind of fell into

the goal at the very end

that was kind of lucky you're getting

into it

okay

and now that's the one I knew

it shocked in the eye

what

Pakistan

45 seconds special

foreign

box I need it I need the timing

I need the timers

[Music]

come on let's get out of the way

we have somewhere to be

about it

I missed it again

foreign

perfectly landed inside that one

there was another thing

I mean I could take the time and then

run against us let's waste the line

is there a place I can get a lot of

knives because that's crazy trash one I

think it's like certain lives in one

location

just in case I need stuck more nice

out of the weights you mine

well he missed it the other way around

this time

not honestly an enemy starts once I

guess

you didn't see much from that

another

and I can have okay

foreign

yes

this time I got it

and then I missed that and then I must

play daily jumps

I will get it I will get it

I still can't read the wrap you know

well I guess

you have to stream on your own so you

can speak Arabic

and polish

foreign

get that one

this is

he just says I'm hungry I'm hungry too

I will eat after this but

but fine I wanted to go to this first

let's it is going to be an epic

epic final at 11. can I get the girls

it's going to be so nice when I get it

and it feels so good and I miss those

things

and I'll just get that one

doesn't look that great at the moment

and I managed to miss that one too

somehow

imagine is that one one two

which is a correct sentence

I think it's a quick sentence

missing everything now

that means you can write I'm hungry in

Swedish

well I didn't die

and that's what kills okay now yes

nine through this

can I get to see that in another way

because it's it's like acts he gets

activated a second

right moment that happens

yog and angry

it is just replace the Y

with the IG because that's gonna

if you take the word sunny and then in

swing this is

kind of like

the the words ending with why in English

is IG in Swedish

obviously sunny sunny and Slick the

difference between more than that but

Hungary and hungry that's basically the

only difference between those things

type of pronunciation

no

okay

no no no no no no no

y'all guys

easy

foreign

yes

I mean some other crates instead

I missed that one too

oh I got headphone there

oh can I jump across there

I mean

if I get a terrible time I can can I

jump like this

and then those control left the ball

there

yeah

connect me through okay

that one and stay missing that one

I think that

and nope I missed it oh careful now

here we go

it's just that one okay so it was a huge

loss

here we go no don't stop stop stop stop

I need you to continue

[Music]

but I have it now I have it

I'm very close

to getting under 45 seconds

come on come on

foreign

[Music]

okay

sloppy

let's do it

Okay so

get through here that was pretty smooth

ly that's perfect let me see those but I

got that one is fine and I got that one

so

it does compensation I can get so far

foreign

that one

looks like I can't get sick if I don't

get the first one

that's not true but

miss both that was the three seconds

yeah it's not going that way

and colliding that one

and in this case I'll try that jump idea

ahead oh and that must be smooth

just basically done

and then I just

yeah okay yeah so I can get across one I

just can't get the curse

the next one because I don't have to

speak but you see me sometime and it

might just be the time I need to say

because I need to save six 20 seconds

that's

half about a half decisions

and 60.

milliseconds

he came on her accounting 70 seconds and

Swedish we say use the words 100

and thousands

which I still do the same in English

yep and yeah that was not cute okay

I got that but I didn't get it

so in Swedish you would say

that would be six hundreds

and I would enjoy eight seconds

you wouldn't count to anything else in

Arch like that

and

you could ask it

anything Wisconsin in

between this month you could say that as

62 Sunday night

60 thousands but as far as I know in

English it's much more common to speak

in milliseconds

they would say 60 milliseconds

but the problem with this is that people

look at the clock here in this game and

then say Oh it's that was just six

milliseconds from the gold no it wasn't

about 60 minutes

it was 670 seconds

and I and yeah just let's just normalize

70 seconds

then the Emily about two syllables so

it's not like more

I am missing everything

thank you

yeah I shouldn't you should I shouldn't

try to go that fast it doesn't matter I

said I was going to do this but

I'm not

let me concentrate again

speaking of concentrate

foreign

forgot about those

you'll get it eventually

it

playstyle cats

and an extra life scene

it's nice when you put these boxes and

fruits before the clock

so you can

now

keep missing it

yeah I should go behind it like this

there we go

now I just

need to avoid that

perfect

hit wrong one but sure

okay

this is so close so close to just

getting across there and getting

out

something after but I feel like what

comes after that is pretty simple

because as soon as I clear

that area

everything else from the policeman

so deeply symptoms

I got that

I will go here

and that one yes

oh no no ah okay

I wanted to get

no

yes

that's what I wanted

I will get it I don't get it give me

just

a few more attempts and I'll get it I'm

not I'm not far from gaming

so close

I fear my skills with skills in building

up nothing speaking English though but I

think

keep my English speaking snakes are

awesome really

and my

speaking in general

I do think I a bit more clear now and

then when I started streaming

uh

didn't get that one

okay there we go

device

and yeah I got that one but I missed

those funny ones

such a priest for one no

no there we go

since I had to wait for this thing

anyway

to go back and check that one

yeah it's just

a Big Easy set of small town

and then it was basically as this and

then there's no one

here you go

and that was the worst time

it was the worst time

how far you've I've had

um I mean it's this is the

some level all these times but it

doesn't

this is the third area

then and then there's two more to get

times done it's always the power levels

that are the hardest kids time zone

and then

after I get these Rallys I can get the

extra levels and then I'm done

everything else aside from the times

I have often not the of its first 35

levels

it's just a type chance

there you go

no no no stop stop stop

foreign

there we go

some good stuff

man I'm almost some bad stuff

oh that was close

I said as soon as I get through this the

remainder of the level which is

basically no more level

yeah it's easy

yeah I should have just

there's a live box

and then I have to wait for this thing

no no no

stupid platforms

that's bad tiny with that thing anyway

but

I said I'll see what happens

see

yeah well it goes this time this is the

Run

this is the hand gets

attacked

I'm very close to doing Ethan

no

let's see you'll see I get this

it's going to be celebration

I will I will comment on when I get

through

each part of getting through I guess

you can hear how close I am

I don't even know what you should call

this pieces

stupid penguin

Third ramp about the three

and then it got attacked as a

little no questions

and then the ramp three was that one

so the moving platforms

with final

you shoot them

a lot of those guess who did a lot of

fire pits

Mr one that's fine

and now these moving platform that I

have to wait for

don't have time hey I could just stay on

that one and wait until it gets to the

other one but I don't have time for that

that's not a good time

so I have

to do that again

I mean that was an interesting pass

as a table part

um

sweaty

foreign

country code for Afghanistan

but yes those platforms are really slow

you can't beautiful

returns this time

to do

to the last shooting place no

okay

last thing a time because there's two

digitizens

tiny

penguin one

missing the times on the level

okay

AF is Afghanistan AF isn't and there is

uh the country codes are

case insensitive usually the country

close everything up case but our case is

where you direct them in lowercase

and for example in top domains

and writing country code interval case

is still valid

and off

11

okay you know what to switch

then we're not having ads can stick

around

hey

because I wanted I wanted to hold off on

the ends so I could complete the lemon

and on so everyone could be here

but

I will probably complete it during kids

and like last time

the last time it was a big problem with

just doing anything with short enough

time and here while

it's about just

fighting eleven

sorry I'm doing this because I didn't

get fast enough time

most of the failures are not new to slow

kind because I failed it up

okay

there we go I got stuck

now why are you shooting all the way up

there

you probably always shut up there but

but still

don't shoot where I am

I wanted that one

just everywhere except where I am

nope

went so slow but still missed it

shoot okay second thing I died

yes God soon

Fire Pizza

okay there's actually things like that

too but like

kind of does it

kept that one

onto the moving platforms

and there we go that's what I wanted got

to see the moving platforms now it's

just the final stretch for everyone who

has been looking away

how's the time to look

no fire pit

and also that timer will get very close

to 45 seconds I think I get 45 seconds

last time I said quite a tricky time to

get

foreign

[Music]

overestimated

our quick place would be how could I

would be

there was some food no problem

never seen water no problem

ball levels

and I keep missing those but I need

those I can't get under 45 seconds if I

don't get things

so as I over I still haven't been able

to compete slime

badly

and I guess this just is going to be

another one of those one hour time

chance

anywhere but they

are so nice ranty I mean was it

fantastic but it was nice

this

why why do I keep missing those

his level adds another 10 years of

playing diarrhea

yeah it's not 35 seconds 45 seconds this

time

thank you

let's change the physics of the game

after that in the times

yeah this PlayStation control is

terrible team

PlayStation controllers in general are

terrible and

I am

because it's not only that it's also the

placement of the stick like I get that

Xbox controller are unsymmetrical but

some much more convenient to have the

thumb in the rest position which is up

and not down

okay

and like the original dual shock they

they made they made the original

controller without sticks and then they

just threw two sticks on there and just

a hand

without much thought

and then

yeah we just kept that design

while Microsoft for every

console

spends a long time

researching and redesigning the

controllers

tonight

they make them close those Microsoft's

and Nintendo redesigns their controllers

Nintendo's is going very experimental

with with the controllers

Microsoft focuses on

how accurate controllers again to me

and arguably aside from build quality of

the Xbox One controller it's it is the

best controller I've used

but of course it doesn't work in the

PlayStation 3.

so if I want to kill down lately

I once hated the placement on the left

something replacing controls yeah

thank you

they have other qualities that are great

with PlayStation

and

but it's not controllers it's not

customer service it's not

and

other aspects

it's the whole

although it was just a story but

the uh

when sonnets

known a person that

yeah if you're going to report to your

bank about that these purchases are

fraudulents we're going to ban your

account

and but these purses are fraudulent and

I have to report them to my bank

it's like

it is it's one thing it's a person makes

up if a person makes a purchase and then

report it to the bank and then

do a second purchase and report that

then and continue like that

that's everything

purchases are

reveal thanks

it's a traffic

and I don't feel

thank you

it's not sleep

yes many more situations when it comes

to Sony and customer service

is the one I remember now

uh keep me here

now okay just one one single one day

just just to see but he was done

shooting but he just had to drop a

single one there

of course I do play Crash game most

limited yeah d-pad

multiple rounding though but

yeah so having the d-pads in the top

left is more convenient for those

moments I would like beyond that

and I can wear that one now
