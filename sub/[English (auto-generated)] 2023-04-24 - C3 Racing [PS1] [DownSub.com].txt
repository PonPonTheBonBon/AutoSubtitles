no welcome
I'm still not used to streaming but one
day so yeah
I need to make sure the audio volume of
this game
there it is
n't too loud
you're kind of echoing why am I echoing
there should only be one source
but I've tried to uh
reduce
let's let's make sure that everything is
in order first then
because the
I'm not sure why that would be the case
I need to listen back to the stream
itself and see what it sounds like
foreign
not sure
um
the stream doesn't want to show up for
me
so the stream doesn't quite sure for me
as far as I can tell it doesn't let go
to my
so and I'm not sure what there is a
cutie about it okay now that the
it's fine fine
it's better that
it makes me aware of potential issues
then
no one's not saying nothing so
let's begin
infographics infograms
or they now they're the pop
I don't remember if they are dead
because
few techniques are they
I should have looked this up beforehand
so
I am
I hope the audio levels are good
okay
let's
how long is this intro
it's been quite a while ago I played
this game last
and I
remember the intro was not too long but
quite long considering the
Simplicity of the game
so let's game C3 racing it's a French
game so it was the French but still puts
English at the top
oh yeah I've never
made sure after that correct
the memory card
so
that
I don't think I have anything to set up
here so let's simply begin
in the simple arcade mode
so it's uh
basic
racing game
I don't play this game to two series you
can
adjust the
I wait for the game too loud so I can
see what see what it's called
the car setup okay they didn't
yeah you can adjust all this stuff I'm
not too much into cars
a different I do still enjoy playing
some of the
bike racing games
without enough in the cars to actually
understanding all these this stuff
foreign
so
all right
black borders on this screen
okay I guess
I I guess it's fine it's not too
distracting I hope otherwise I could
okay it's actually annoying me a bit
it's not hard to remove I just do this
no pre not free
a early stream adjustments
so every morning this
black borders
and then enlarge it a bit more there you
go that's big and beautiful
now let's begin the first race
this is a
I do prefer
sitting inside car oh the car the game
is quite quiet actually let me increase
the game volume
okay quite quiet
fairly quiet
okay I set it to Max it's still really
quiet I guess the engine noise isn't
that important
so
so this is more of a simulator racing
game
so it's not
that car behaves like this
so it's not like obviously nothing like
Mario Kart and racing games like that
so as far as I can tell
they are trying to make it realistic but
because it's playing it's a Playstation
One game
obviously the simulation is not going to
be accurate
and that's kind of what I like
oh why are you stopping
and no realistic collections or anything
so I
enjoyed the more casual kind of
simulation game
so I guess it's still kind of an arcade
but it's not arcade
this is a slight bit of music in the
background that's you can barely hear
because I played some
I mean in Need for Speed where you have
the
nitrous oxide is that what it's called
I'm a coffee standards
where's panic
body have
but basically a boost
and I said
yeah fishy like that there's nothing
like that in this game it's just
it's just driving staring
winning races
casual fund
neolab records
and I didn't even I even crashed in rain
in the lab
[Music]
I'm a bit bad at staying on the track
I'm talking more outside the tracking on
it so so this is one of the games I did
play growing up so I do have some
nostalgic
Nostalgia for a game I've never actually
complete the game so that's one thing I
do want to do
so why not stream it at the same time
so one of these phrases takes like at
least at the start takes like three
minutes
one and a half minutes per lap two laps
it's very short like that but that's
also I think
we could argue is more artake or take
arcade
is there an adjective arcade archaic
new lab record yeah that was a battery
left and then the previous one
and that's the labs are very short
two laps three laps that's more like you
need for speed
and not like 20 30 laps
and that's the arcade in that
no you can enter actually nothing this
is not like arcade you can actually
enter eight letters
so now I can write write out the
following
so let's continue
so which I didn't look at so you have
all these different countries around the
world you can miss it like Brazil Peru
United States Norway China
I don't think China
is that maybe that the point feels a bit
too high it is supposed to be
air at the Great Wall
which has as far as now is in the
northern China
anyway Indonesia which I never can
pronounce and Africa that's that's a
good country
I'm not sure why they didn't specify
which country it is it's not like
it's east of
it's like Central African Republic
maybe that's what it meant and it's
shorten it to Africa
it's kind of close to
Kenya as well
it got the falls in the picture so
waterfall is there waterfall it goes by
and the other stage name is Rome that's
not a country ID
so
and then each track has three variants
when you win
as you win the race you can proceed to
the next track
well let's continue
the second race
is on the same track but backwards
which does
I flipped the car
anyway back on the race
I flipped the car
before crossing the start starting line
yeah that kind of shows the uh
lack of simulation
the cars are a bit too light I feel
but these
AI drivers are quite easy at start
they are very easy at start they will be
much harder in late races
could have just been me being bad but
in a real race I wouldn't catch up to
them this easily
and also the lack of
head damage means that you can Collide
it down races there's a thing I do
prefer
car damage since it
forces you to not just drive into
everything
because I have tried to play simulation
more realistic card games online with
strangers
the problem is that they drive
and drive Insurance everything because
I think those public lobbies don't use
collection
and in that case the best thing is to
just
when everyone is slowing down to take
the corner
it's not much longer than in this game
not yet at least
whenever one is slowing down you just
Ram into everyone and you start to slow
down your car and you don't take any
damage so
and you might even push someone off the
track
and I don't like playing games and
racing games that way
and the computer is not playing the
racing game that way either
so having
collision damage
enabled would prevent this
from that kind of behavior
of course it would also hurt the play
they drive into
so the best thing I would say is to have
some kind of
other other
maybe it's a bit too punishing
I like the
typify
in that case have some kind of limited
um
limited punishment if you're driving to
someone else
for a short time your
I don't know
anyway this
erase is soon over
but if I crashed horribly at the start
and you press start and it kind of hit
replay
but I'm
willing to play
new Caravan well okay let's move on the
next guy
vary the cars a bit
I'm willing to play like Need for Speed
as well
so now is during the night and this game
doesn't remember that I wanted to
is the front view of the car
which I've been playing with
right
other than most people don't use this
View
but I basically use this View my whole
life
and prefer it
I even prefer having this kind of view
in non-racing games though of course I
don't have this View
when playing Mario Kart is not really an
option
[Applause]
oh no
and also I was going to mention because
there is a lot of water in this level
it is stimulating in that sense that if
you fall off the track it's game over
one more try
although it's not simulating in that
sense you can actually retry
it would be way too punishing if you
have to
restart everything
but the same room actually applies to
the computer players
if they fall into the water they are
also out of the race
which I do have a memory of
in one level in a later level
when I was young and wasn't good at this
game and couldn't catch up to the cars
and and you basically started
and of course you start at the end of
the
last position
and then
six which is sixth place or only five AI
computer place
so
as I was going to say was
then I'm at the last position cannot
catch up to them but at some point the
position will change so I'm certainly at
fifth position
and even fourth position because in some
research fall off the track
and also this third track
is the same direction as the first track
but
the layout is slightly different
so on
[Music]
six places
okay now I'm messing up a bit too much
this is still the first
track
sorry wait
first country is that how you could call
it first region because they aren't out
of the Mountain Country
first region Star Trek
and I'm still already failed twice
I need a fake
I get no I need to focus here
okay
pass the water section
that bush actually had Collision
and there we are the leader
100 meters away
I wonder if that distance is accurate
as in if you were to measure
how long it considers 100 meters to be
how long are these cars
how
is the speed accurate
[Music]
okay now I'm going to be a bit careful
as
and then I draw into the grass
we still have a unlimited lead currently
so
can be a bit careful
there you go
what the section is over and now I can
almost dropping that bush again
and now I should
not fall into the water
I promise I'll do my best
yeah here I did that section
on the first track when you go there
there are blocks that prevent you from
falling down
already when you run into those blocks
they can fall down so
but in the Star Trek when it's light and
hard to see already they don't have
those blocks there so
and there we go
winner
took a three tries but I didn't
I could like I guess at least my
at least my failures
so
let me quickly
okay and it does use separate memory
cards per game
wait in that case uh
well
can you format it then
there we go
it has been said good it works and now
it has been completed
three tracks completed
now we have
unlocked Indonesia but let's start with
Peru
let's continue with Peru
which is a track without water at least
if
there are water there but it's
unaccessible
I think the second track has water this
other one definitely has
but I don't think you drive close to the
water so it should not be an issue
unless I misremember
we'll see
I have so far shown a tendency to fail
it's only two times
wow
making a failing
come on
no need to catch up with them
and the number above should be to the
next card and not the lady
and I wish it's taught me the little
distance
it's about 100 meters between
ours
except the red and orange I don't know
the plants
what do you call it
of these cars
the car I'm driving yes
that's the source I know
oh yeah the blue one is a
Renault Clio
and yeah
did catch up with them
is that these are the races
the game is
I guess the tracks are split into two
categories the
I don't remember what's that called so
there's
wait I think they're called amateur and
Pro
so the pro
tracks
have different cars and
you do three laps instead and the AI is
much tougher
and doing a mistake in that
kind of race wind
and definitely make you lose
at least a big mistake like that
so far it goes well
here's a little town hopefully no one is
walking across the street they haven't
put up any form of barriers or anything
foreign
and crashed this is a bit of punishment
I feel like after you crash
the car doesn't want to accelerate for
half a second or so
which I do feel is a bit too little of a
punishment
of course if if they were damaged to a
car like I mentioned before in that case
you wouldn't want to collide with
animals
there we go
let's continue Peru number two
new car
show
a 2006.
0
maybe that's more close to it this time
it's foggy
and I think it's backwards as well
I don't remember
and I quite healing
and
the start is in a different location
because it's right outside the village
this retros
and houses are quite the
official
look
at someone might recognize this game
because it has been released in other
regions under different names
as far as I know it's only been released
as two different games
so in United Kingdom
another force me to take this one not
sure why this is necessary but sure
in that Kingdom it was released
more like an update to the game so I
should rather play that one
which is called let's see if I remember
max power racing
which
added more cars
I think that's the only change made
otherwise the game should be the same I
think
oh yeah you can but it's blocked off so
you cannot access the water anyway
no risk of falling in
okay there was no watch on the second
track
so and then it was also released in
North America under the name
which I don't remember
and
[Music]
it had some weird name
back
TTR hardcore
XT
so I'm gonna
as far as I know that's a game series
but they basically took this game may
change it to it
so what I did was
to replace all the cars with pickups
and they replaced every mention of car
with truck
but I guess I'm driving outside this
place now
so instead of
yeah
juice car it's juice Trucking instead of
car setup is a track setup and so on
and then they also
rebranded all the tracks so instead of
they being different countries around
the world
plus African room and they are different
U.S states
so that's
which of course
doesn't like
too much sense since these tracks were
made with the different countries in
mind
like this Peru track has these
one
[Music]
I I guess there isn't much Peru to this
track
and there are other trees some kind of
tree to find in Peru
and then you have that Village I'm up
ahead
maybe I'm only thinking of this being
Prairie like because I play this game I
try to think of
butter
media which features Peru
it needs to be like January in Peru
it's not a river
let's move on to Renault
how do you pronounce that mejon
anyway let's continue
so the like the Africa track for example
that one has
trees which you can find in Africa
so that would make sense to have for a
track United States so what they did was
they remove the trees
as far as I've checked under both tracks
They are identical
the only difference between them is that
the trees are missing
to remove a bit of the African feel
so
foreign
but I do play the
see-through racing because that's the
original game
I wouldn't mind playing
max power raising
princess tries to stay true to original
and I Faith again
which is also why I play
on Tuesday last Tuesday and this Tuesday
like onto this building a bit Peru like
and they didn't change that
North American release
anyway
I play
kurukuri mix on Tuesdays
at least last year's and this Tuesday
I'm probably going to complete it this
Tuesday so I need to find some other
games to play next
but
I do play the European version because
that's what that's the one that stays
more true to the
I have attituded Japanese original
this track should have water you can
fall into
oh oh yeah here here's the water
I forgot about that but yeah to the
right here is the water
and I lost everything on that so
plus the game
I'm lying on my side
and that's in that case they have no
problem replacing car but if you fall
into the water in that case you cannot
replace the car
with a magic
so but it's not only
and that they have basically rebranded
all the tracks and barely made any
changes to them
which isn't
I mean
continue to eat
I mean I respect other people's opinions
but to me
and I think it comes off as a bit of a
bad taste that they have to change every
International Drive to be places in
United States
why can't couldn't they just let it be
different tracks around the world
it's still the same tracks so
with the same textures and everything
but of course it's not only that they
have
they have also they're also running the
game at uh when this game runs at 25.
and so they have in so of course they
have changed it so it runs at 30.
because that's the frame rate they have
but they haven't adjusted the game so it
actually runs properly at setting
they have just sped up the game so it's
running too fast
which I don't enjoy either
so okay that should lead my opinions
regarded
and that wasn't track
and I was wondering
another fail
let's add it to the list
and let's try again
and welcome new Watchers I don't know
who you are you're free to lurk if you
want
you are free to write in the
comments you're free to make fun of my
driving if you want
we are here to have fun
I'm only playing this mostly
at a casual level
it is quite an inaccurate came out of
the way
but it's fun
for it's a bit of inaccuracies
and
this game will allows you to use either
kilometers per hour or miles per hour as
your
parameter is that good for speedometer I
don't know
I'm not the native English speaker if
that's not obvious
so
they still do that have that in the
North American version but
regardless of which you need to pick in
season racing at the top it will always
count in
about a kilometers
I do find that a bit odds they should
have changed so that reflects which
units you have selected
but if you're driving in miles per hour
you should measure the distance to next
car in March
but it did change that in the North
American version
so instead of it saying kilometers it
says Mars
and that's all they changed they didn't
change how it calculates distance
so it still measures in
well kilometers but they claim it to be
minus
but as I questioned before I wonder how
accurate it is in the first place anyway
yeah I actually slow down a bit I'm
driving on the side
on the hilly sides
cannot be good for the car
a reaction been destroyed by that
hey
you're not allowed pass me
I'm supposed to win this race
am I already defeately raised once
now let's try
to not feel it
this time
and I think this
lab is also backwards
yeah it's this background because it
could go through that's an alarm section
first and then you go to
split the track
it's the other way around on the first
track
or is the first track the reverse track
because
the second and third tracks
are in the same direction and therefore
holds the majority
but the first strike is the first break
so
I must miss that
wow
where am I
mommy is trying
driving blindly
at a high speeds 100
okay I should have slowed down there
whatever
needs 200 okay this goes well
[Music]
that should be about here we go
that's two two countries completed
I should save again
saving complete
now I left Brazil but let's go to
Indonesia because I unlocked that one
first new car let's see
foreign
jumping on the sides
at this level the level
this track does not have water
I don't remember if the second track has
but the Star Trek has water it's almost
like there's the trend here
yeah
and I have so far fallen into the water
at least once on every third track
but at least I could
see that I've reduced the number of
Mistakes by one each time so this time
I Should Fall Down zero times
and then when I do Brazil I Should Fall
Down minus one times
somehow
can you get out of the way I'm trying to
drive it I'm trying to win here
if you may
are these houses in the nation
oh yeah scraping against that Stonewall
did nothing to the car
it wasn't like the Versa
a part of the world sticking out and
would have demolish the car
can't give you a little push
now
first place
at the start of the second life let's
see if I can keep this up
the more challenging parts will come
later
the more exciting parts
I wonder if I can because I planned to
do this
dream for three hours I wonder if I can
complete the
amateur tracks
and then I wanted to see try to stream
again on Wednesday
and then do the Pro Tracks
um Wednesday but considering that those
tracks are harder I would probably not
be able to complete them I would
probably fail a lot of times
but each track is interior at least
how
I'm currently fading
here you go I
managed to
overtake
take it over delete
should have some
someone from each country to
see if they think that the track does a
good representation of the country
Corolla
foreign
and see if I can avoid it
I think
the Water is easier to avoid in the
sidetrack
which I should hopefully not fall down
stereotypes but I'm probably jinxing it
and we'll fall down a lot
and if I say that I will think it does
that
nullify my jinxing
is that our request
get out of the way I want to win
maybe not by driving into the water
okay
it's quite a cloudy backdrop
got a detail better I really don't know
how detailed
the backgrounds are in
I should have like a racing suit on my
phone
oh
first let's go
oh hello
Tiffany
yeah I'm first place
and
and the first step
and it's your first message everything
is first
do you know this game
the the other is it has no chance
against this
the bunny
she's
she's a quick little bunny Elsa there's
no water on this track yeah I never
got to say that
quite obvious after the first lap
see snap doesn't
the layout of the track doesn't change
between labs
but there is actually another racing
game I played on PlayStation one where
the layout actually does change
I think it does it does some kind of
three different track per
location and it also has locations all
around the world
and
and I think the first track is the first
layout second track is the second layout
and the third track
goes between the first and the second
layout
or something like that I don't remember
I haven't played that game in years so
maybe I should
adding some variety to the platform
games are played
badly
how did this beat across the Finish Line
there
but I came in first it's
I Found You by scrolling through the
Casual attack yeah I'm doing a bit of
casual gaming here
um I'm from Canada oh nice this
to have people from around the world
this game only came out in Europe
apparently yeah this specific list three
specific version of it
is only Europe there is
actually a North American version of the
game
do you play a lot racing games this is
actually the first racing stream I do
but I wouldn't mind playing more games
if you have interest in certain games
like I do want to play 37 Need for Speed
high stakes as it's called in Canada
it's a Canadian developed game uh an
honest Road challenge in Europe and I do
like that game because you you
basically have money you purchase a car
and race of course and as your car takes
damage which means that you have to
drive carefully and not collide with
everything
you have to pay for the repairs
and then you win money from the races
and can buy new cars I do like
that game and I should play it
so but as I was going to say about this
game which actually did came out in
North America but it was renamed to her
name which I cannot remember trr
hardcore
something TR
hello hello x50
I like Need for Speed
Hot Pursuit a lot
I haven't played that one I think
I wanted to try out every new Speed game
I play the second Hot Pursuit
and I'm apparently playing on the ground
but I played Underground 2.
and no I don't remember if they came up
like
uh Hi how are you it's going good
um I think
try to do some early morning stream
I'm from Europe so it's 11 o'clock
currently so
it's raining for an hour now
[Applause]
yeah I should say if you go to the C3
racing Wikipedia page is you it should
say
somewhere in the article about the North
American release
here's five am yeah that's um
six hours
difference okay really early in the
morning now I'm crashing
oh yeah I forgot the rear view mirror it
should be
so I can see what's behind me
and I forgot that last thing you have to
enable manually for some reason
so yeah
but I do prefer playing
the version of the game that is most
accurate original and this is the
original French cutout thing
while the North American version
if someone can bother to go to Wikipedia
and check the actual name of it
um
and that one replaced all the cars with
pickup trucks
I don't know
maybe they aren't specific pickup trucks
but
tracks in some form
um
my English weight I wanted to go through
these Corners first my English is not my
first language
so forgive me if my English is not
perfect that's fine my English is not
perfect either I'm not
I'm not a native English speaker idea
so if you
you're free to
say which country you're from you don't
have to I'm from Sweden
um no yeah TNN that was it
but Motorsports I forgot
and then it was a hardcore TR I remember
the TR I remember the hardcore I forgot
the TNN it's such a weird name
and then one day I can't remember it
yeah I have pasted the accepted
which I can read
a later when I get into the girl
because
I'm from Chile welcome and so
I hope
I don't speak too quickly
or anything
I yeah I don't know how well because I
want to
I want everyone to feel
and also if my English is
pronounced good enough now let's see in
North America the game was received and
renamed as TNN Motorsports hardcore TR
my publishes their ASC games
which features different cars but had
similar tracks as far as I know it's the
same tracks and relocated location
within the United States yes and menus
to see through
racing but
ah
ignoring the parenthesis part but had
similar tracks and menus to season
racing it's not the same
it's not similar tracks it's the exact
same tracks it's the exact same menus
is
mark
oh yeah that's why it went into the
middle because I haven't done Brazil yet
it
everything is the same
they have almost the same they have done
minor changes like in the Peru track
I don't think they made a single change
maybe they did something I missed but I
think I want to share the tracks
some of the tracks and in the African
track as Africa spread the country and
they
removed the trees that were African
I don't know what trees they were but
they looked African
to that's the extent of their modifying
of the tracks
I don't like the edges of the track
because like it's
like it's it would be fun
if it was in Chile and it has street
cars
uh
I don't know what you mean by street
cars
if you don't mind
explaining it
yeah sadly there is no Chile tracks
there are two tracks in South America
which
I've heard that SATA America is often
forgotten
so that's it's quite nice to do actually
two tracks
it's quite a dark track as well
so
some later tracks like
the East one track that is Rome which
apparently is also a country
has the Colosseum
so
I would assume they have changed that
I would like to know which
I have considered oh now I'm driving
wrong here
considered
going
what wait the rear meter is back
so it was gone in the previous track I
guess because
reasons oh yeah I think it was a nice
track and on night tracks possible Fork
tracks it doesn't have the rear winner
because not only wouldn't you be able to
see anything because you don't have
lights backwards
it might be you're quite sorry
it might require too much performance to
do the light calculations
am I I'm losing my voice
now back
oh nice attack on there
uh yeah doing the light calculations
might require too much performance to
have two views because the revenue
basically needs a second camera
so anyway I need to concentrate because
I need to catch up with that card it's
less than 100 meters away at least
and then I'll get to the comments in a
bit
because this is close to the end of the
track and yeah that was
that would result in a disqualification
in a real race but this is not the real
race
this is a casual race
I do try to avoid doing such things that
was an accident
but it's not against the dreams
and it's not like the competitors aren't
attacking me they cannot push me aside
sometimes too
so I guess that's just fine and they
tackle each other as well so
let me explain you
in Chile they grab [ __ ] boxes
I need something to drink
I cannot speak
this is my eighth average dream
so I hope to get better speaking over
time
I deciding it should get more experience
anyway
they grab sheet boxes that looks like
cars and they modify them to appoint
this sound like a race car going at 50.
okay
I don't want to ask more but
because he came quite a nice explanation
here but
what are you drinking
um
it's actually soda
I normally don't drink it I only drink
it on the Stream
so
buy sheet boxes do you mean like broken
down cars
I mean you say that looks like cars
so
it sounds like they aren't cars
okay so I'm interested that's that's why
I'm asking
um
because I haven't heard about this
before this is
together
my initial reaction is basically
trying to face this
cars that are so broken down but they at
least it looks like cars I guess and
then they fix them so they at least run
but they
trim them in such a way that they sound
like race cars I guess broken down cars
okay yeah made up cars oh even
the thing that they can hear okay so
they basically make cars of whatever
they find okay
it sounds kind of interesting
yeah it would actually be fun to have a
game based on that scene
that cartoon into me so that's not my
fault and again another track without a
really mean her
because of the [ __ ] it would just be
white looking back I should be able to
look back visit this person no
um
is this button though
there's the button I found it
there you can see
I was looking back and then the car
reversed into me
normally in Chile
normally wait
I read that wrong normally in Chile
my time was supposed to read this
and normally in Chile are normal cars
um but the guys that do this don't use
new cars now I assume they don't
all right take care of it I'm trying my
best hit
or cars that are in good condition
that's the point of it yeah
and it does make me think of the race in
kind of race they have in there
in Finland
where I think
the basic premise of the whole race is
that you can take whatever car you want
to race with
uh but
Adam one is allowed to buy your car for
a 400 Euro
so you don't want to use your a car that
is worth more than that because then
you'll get
lose it
so they can use
not the greatest cars
because 400 euros isn't isn't a lot for
a car I think it was foreign
again
at least I was and scraping along along
the ground for that long oh
thank you for your follower x50 can I
call the x50 I will get your comments
in a bit because I'm actually using this
race
it's first place on our place
because it's there
because it's basically arcade mode of
the game this is a championship you have
clear and points and after raising other
races you
count up the points and then determine
the winner
but in our arcade mode you must come
first place or you won't proceed
but
um
doesn't look like I'm going to get into
first place because this looks like to
get close today there's the water
section here
can I jump with the car already I
and here is the end of 11.
now wait
and here's the end of the level
that way
this isn't going great I'll give up
there was no end of the level you just
continue with more and more care I I
didn't remember the level apparently
okay let's see later the point of it is
to have a better [ __ ] box it's fun
though I can imagine it's fun it sounds
fun
I mean I wouldn't use it as my regular
car I guess
but it definitely sounds like a fun
video game
and I would
I would love to
have such skin
um
I should
I mean I can't do this as well and then
read the comment as well but that's not
as fun
it was
one time I decided to participate oh you
that's that's cool
and I won oh that's that's amazing
with a made-up card
and the motor was
12 chainsaws and engines put in line
okay that's that's definitely a made-up
card
the funny thing about it is that I have
a real car yeah I would imagine you have
a real car
I just wanted to participate yeah I
assume
and there are some things like I
mentioned in the Finnish race with the
400 Euro
you have to sell the car if someone's
bought it
and
so you don't want to take uh you
wouldn't take one to take your own car
of course because you want to keep the
car and you don't want to bring a good
car because it's probably worth more
than that so there's probably some
incentives to why you wouldn't bring
like a good fast and
well card that would actually win the
race
because they're probably elements in the
race that
will discourage such a thing
a lot of people just don't do it because
that's not in the spirit of the race
which could also be a reason
doing that
I mean my real car would have won but
that would not be in the point yeah yeah
whatever hours most experience is if
there's anything in the race that
discourages it or it's just that people
don't do it just for the spirit of it
because one of the reasons I could
imagine is if
if it's during the race there is a risk
of collisions and stuff
you don't want and if you just use
a so-called sheet box you don't have to
worry about collisions because I mean
it's
yes the car you threw together for the
race itself
and in that case you can use this to
throw together another car
in that case you wouldn't want to bring
a real car because you don't want that
one to get beaten up
is there
it would be like cheating yeah
is there any like
yeah yeah
eating it again to play with friends
yeah but uh is there like a money
involved in it or do is it just
a normal if there's no money in it in
that case and yeah I could see people
not doing it
but other other I want to consider other
types of
competitions there are pro there are
certainly
if it's not normally I could yeah I
could see it
in that case no one would bother doing
it
how much fellow that
yeah but it sounds interesting
I'm over on analyzing everything
that's me
but because I really like to know more
about stuff
but one day is Monday There Are Rules
yeah
that makes sense
makes makes perfect sense
characters here is get to the girl first
twice
this is the second track I think why is
it so hard
I mean partly distracted by his chat
which is perfectly fine do you write as
much as you want I encourage that
the game was too easy before so
okay how many
turns on it yeah so I must
a bit too early on my
last time I failed I should rather
restart before crossing the Finish Line
because otherwise I had to wait for the
menu to loads which isn't too
slow
I guess
I don't need to press next race or I
just skip doing the track two for now
problem is it doesn't show it and I go
straight to Rome
I don't have any more cars now and then
yeah remember is on by default
because for real races
literally
I literally have cards for it or real
races I mean I have
kind of the study
I keep it means Mini Cooper
uh BMW
I should be BMV because German and that
troop I don't know I'm a trooper I don't
I do know about this other
but it is not the point yeah yeah
and one comma three later
anyway
so this is Rome
and for some reason it's night on the
first right
it's usually it's on the circuit
I thought I was going to collide with
that wall
like I see
the one was angled
the Collision of the one was angled I do
like the I don't like how dark this
track is
but I do like the
aesthetic of it I think
wrong way
yeah can you move after the way
okay look
oh that was terrible
the trooper is like one of the most
triple
we will drive
and like it's better than Land Rovers
yeah and
which might be a good thing to know I
don't know much about cars even though I
do
played racing games I do I do like
racing games but I have very little
experience with cars I know about brands
do column brands
I don't even know how the terminology
so
I mean yeah four-wheel drive
it has the driving on four wheels I
think like that
and I know about Land Rovers but yeah
I'm doing my best
so like this
car tuning I don't know I'm losing my
voice again
I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on what goes
on with my voice
anyway
this cartooning but I'm so inexperienced
with the cartooning that I don't know
how to tune the car I should probably
tune the car for more because there's
basically the I think they call it like
final gear
no I actually don't remember it's gone
because I'm trying terribly let's talk
because that's that's allowed like hey
I'm funny too much behind can we restart
the race
when a trip is a weird case because it
isn't
Isuzu
and a Chevrolet
at the same time
I don't know what an Isuzu is
that's my cause I'm learning about new
stuff here
I need to I want to look up more stuff
about this actually I want to
I want to write this down
maybe I've heard about Isuzu before kind
of sounds like
is an old brand of cars
I'm too young okay here we go so I can
do with this close gearing or far
gearing
the clothes gearing should make the the
gears closer meaning quicker
acceleration but lower top speed far
gearing should be
a further distance between his gear make
slower acceleration but higher top speed
is kinda
did
Basics if I understood it correctly here
and there you can basically select this
females and that's the only thing I like
to modify the car setup
and since this race has a lot of turns
and sharp Corners I should rather have
cookie acceleration so I can get out of
the corners quickly
and also water on the first track I
think this is the first track with water
on the
the first reaching with the water on the
first trick
push you aside
and then there's Connections in the
tunnel quite a dangerous tunnel
because you know the crashes that are
happening and also to consider is speed
you approach the tunnel and it's quite
narrow and then you drive straight into
the seven wall
yeah that I don't think they would do
that in a real race
they like these curves they do remind me
of the Spiral one
and that's the north bus panel which has
curves like that too
but inspire you go up the curves and
here you get down the cares
the escapes
yeah this track requires a lot of
that was buyed by Chevrolet ah
it's not part of Chevrolet
I see
a lot of those Brands make precious by
other brands
and then the General Motors only half of
the brands
so
crashing someone can I catch up to those
other cars
well I have to go see her yeah it's been
fun chatting with you have a nice day
and maybe
I'll see you around in the future
more racing on Wednesday
only I have the sketchy also
there we have you
liftoff
secondary wait how could the second
credit card
flies higher on the second bounce than
the first bounce
and how the physics are in some great in
this game but
this seems a bit ridiculous I'm going to
check you know
they came the wrong way no I'm
just turned around a bit early
maybe they should disable it the wrong
way message in that corner
yeah driving through this doesn't seem
safe either
yeah I am not catching up with these
other cars
I want here's to come see them
very big
yeah this isn't going great
well
[Music]
so
yeah that was a loss
foreign
wait a minute what's the car setup
it remembers
should I try that
I guess it's worth it right
so far
why are you slowing down
that doesn't seem like yeah
at least it felt like the car was living
down
I don't know how many
hey locking my way
trying to pass it okay now it's actually
going to see
like this well I'm gonna flip the car
again
because that's my specialty
so I don't want to be here down to 50
which is still quite fast
yeah I don't know how accurate this
speedometer is a bit Harmony
I don't know how to pronounce these
so
continue to these curves
oh I got some experience
driving on the road track so now it's
going easy
four seconds slower than in lab report I
think that means
and what are these things in the side on
the right side
nice
oh nice okay as I was trying to get off
the edge I flipped the car
because the thing on the side when I was
young I thought it was kind of uh
they call it stand
audience
place for audience to sit
but I don't think that's what it is
I think it's some kind of
thing found in Brazil
and there we go that's a win
and what's holding up this bridge is
just a very thin Bridge
with no support
it's even a bit curved going between
those two cliffs
and then people drive
six cars across it oh that's quite the
water
doesn't seem safe at all
Bijou 306 GTI 6.
and crazy numbers and letters
foreign
oh it's raining
wait
I should check your sound
I could increase the
music 11.
see I don't know how well the game is
kind of quiet
I don't know if these applied to All of
Me
games
so if I should boost the audio bit
but you're free to comment if I should
make things louder or more quiet
although I do know this quite team
air noise I did use some filter before
but
here we go if I apply this one
does that sound better let me know
when I do this
and I can look back on the recording
myself later
see if it's if it makes any difference
or if it makes my voice sound weird
my voice is weird already
so the
track two was reverse because I think
this thing whatever it is
which they put ads on
to me it looks like a very
culturally culture important thing or
something I don't know I didn't know I
was describe
and then they put pads on it
welcome cat Rollins
I think that's your name
Rollins that's up to you
on YouTube
what do you mean by e
[Music]
conomy hi
hi
you you wrote a funny first message
you got my attention
[Music]
and it's nice to find a new people here
I'm just casually playing a racing game
that's too serious
and it has gone great on previous tracks
but as I get to later tracks it is I
think
okay
the AI is driving better
they are not Collision all right there's
no damage or anything I just
but they like to tackle me as well I
guess that's kind of the spirit of the
race
I tried to avoid it but
it happens
okay 100 meters left that one I should
be able to catch up
there we go it's slowing down for this
corner
how are you it's going great
when aside from the parts where
I'm still very near to streaming so
but it does make me feel better happier
screaming meeting
strangers
getting to know people
and just having people write
they're funny comments
it's like e
e
that is a funny comment
that that is
the highlights of it
that's that sounds kind of tragic if
that's the highlight of
oh thank you for the follow
nice day
so now I completed the bottom row
the the countries
Brazil Peru Indonesia and Africa
they have unified it's the year
I don't know when this game came out
so all right shine so China
is the second class
wait how many dresses
one two three four five
it's the first class and one two three
four five the second class
so I didn't want to complete
so this is the last car
that's the first guy
and as far as I know they
so with this car I should hopefully be
able to win this race I got
I think third last time
as far as I know the kind of sticky
about or something so it's very simple
and I don't know much about cartooning
so
as far as I know that should improve the
acceleration in exchange for top speed
but this car track is very heavy
I have corners and stuff so I need
explanation over up speed
so hopefully that should do it
yeah I would say this car is better than
previous card definitely I'm already in
first place
and I'm
colliding this tunnel opening
up
stay on the track
there you go
nice and easy
the cone is for me to complete this game
not like that that's not how you
complete the game
we have a collection
s
in one spot
they complete this game for the first
time in my life
played it since I was young
never been good at it enough enough good
good enough to actually win it
but
I should change that now
I'm gonna be 30.
cool I think yeah I'm not going to
collide with everything
okay catching up but I do have the date
I don't think I've added it
last time I tried this track
it doesn't happen I think all three
tracks aren't right
no I've never seen this track only time
I think
or one of the variants is lit up and I
have seen it in daylight
room is forever
shrouded in darkness
to never see the light of day
I don't think that's how the expression
is meant
I don't know I don't speak English as my
native language so
if I say anything weird you can let me
know
it's probably because I don't know it's
fluid
and also if I do say something that's
concentrated
not is suitable to say I guess that's a
way to describe it the left window too
so I know
I don't have any
bad intentions it's probably due to me
speaking Swedish as my native language
since I'm Swedish
there might be some
cognate with English that has a
completely different meaning in English
and I'm not used to it
or something
anyway
so far
it goes well
[Music]
and I hope this dream around smooth as
well
I've kind of thought was that
the computer takes over the car and Rams
it into the wall
my beautiful car that is indestructible
okay that actually went much
I think I forgot the same so I have a
better no no I did say
oh same anyway
all right the
show up on the stream as well a bit
cropped out because there's a few black
borders
good boxes
you have placed boxes on the track
if you're going to have a speed race
like this where you have
intentionally put up signs telling you
which direction to go in and closed up
are all in the other roads
why would you leave crates on the track
and that seems that seems something
dangerous
okay
it was a bit weird but anyway I got to
do it that's the important part
I'm training more on the wild than on
the street
this isn't street racing This Is War
racing
not to get through this
art which I
which was easier with the other card
but I guess it's due to the speed and
speed of this car that's it because we
are
I do play with analog controls so
so thick turning are you trying to make
small adjustments
thank you
so far
going
not bad but they are very close behind
on the hammer lifters
compared to all the tracks where I can
get 500
Elite
and let's see there's a crates
I think in the way
I don't know how heavy they are or if
they feel like not what happened I think
they are quite Heaven if you drive into
venue right now stop
but you can push them I think
because
that's silly of me
foreign
for the next League
and I flipped the car
[Music]
and they got these Italian light banners
which is uh well they are
or some other stripes when it's done in
like a symmetrical Stripes but when you
hang the
Italian flag down
and the order is from top to bottom
green white red
they did get that quick
because if they're done the other way
around red white green that would be the
Hungarian outside
but they do have
good attention to DK
very very quick 3D streets
it's awesome as
a dangerous race right yeah
Drive rather fast to
their own buildings
we know
there you go
something like a drink
and on to the next race rum
track three
foreign
foreign
do you want to unlock like a bonus card
for completing all the tracks but
I guess not
I guess to his style I want to see if
there's any form of bonus for completing
all the first
epic tracks
I'm using different terms every time I
mean at some point I should have used
the correct term
tier one Championship Cars thank you
[Music]
where's the track oh here it is I hope
it's not really an open word so
some parts of the device can be quite
wide
[Music]
watch out
[Music]
foreign
tracks are the easy ones because I
struggled a bit with this track for this
location
but the following five locations will be
a challenge
because the first
issue is that I have to
let me go backwards
why didn't take me so long to realize
that
um this place is kind of iconic so
so I have to restart on unlocking cars
because there are new cars
and apparently this gives give out the
cards for free or something
oh
I didn't see the dark purple wall
against the Blackness of the night
I think they should put up some kind of
reflector scene there so I can see the
edge of the building
seems like a reasonable thing to do
or like you put up a sign in front of
the building
the like spawning narrow path
driving to the wall of the building
please
wait why am I in second position
actually hit attention yeah I have
realized I'm in second position I
thought I was in first position
but apparently I have a car in front of
me
less than 100 meters or something ah I
saw
besides colliding with the wall
you like pass me an excursions
did I forget that I wasn't I thought I
was in the first position and now I'm
not you must have passed me at some
point
and I didn't realize it
and there it is
when you get past
oh that was terrible
yes I don't think I crashed
it's
when I'm flashing now
yeah I mean now yeah let's restart
one more try
I guess I jinx myself fighting
about how easy it was
and I guess the game wanted to
finish me for it
okay now concentration time
in America
because
get out of the way
I see a
car in front that thing
why are they so
[Music]
difficulty
they're very easy on the previous track
makes it basically the same cards
I mean it was the same cars in the
the first track eh
it's well so
especially when they take the corners so
wide
running almost up to the wall
before they turn
300 meters
stay on the track
you can run this marks with green lines
follow the green line
but I did collide with that purple mode
now I remember
maybe the past me at that point
and I just didn't pay attention
because zombies talking about
getting a warning signs
[Music]
and let me decide I should catch it
now
now
I'm gonna go bro okay
oh there we go hello car and yes
no no I should not collide with that
purple more
I will collide the purple one
of the Colosseum
look at the third track here the second
track didn't have water the third track
he doesn't have water he's the first
shark that has water rum is kind of a
weird level compared to the rest
because the first strike is also during
the night which is only applied to this
side track or the previous
locations
but yeah as I remember all three tracks
in Rome are during the night
I crashed in the tunnel
but I blocked away for the car
when the car when your car is being
replaced
it's intangible
yeah so that AI card could have driven
this through my car
think about it when I crashed
but I decided enough to presentation
it let me keep the lead
I'm not something
I appreciate that oh that was it okay
that was good
oh now it just Rams me from this side it
is that the revenge
I was prepared for the corner I didn't
pay attention that was the finish line
so there we go that's all there is an
amateur says
and I got nothing
when I got to play the game
I appreciate that it's still using life
so UK that is a difficult track China
that's the difficult track
well I guess I'll move on so there are
loads the new cards
and you only start with buying car
and like the amateur series we start
with two cars
okay
um
well the difficult level has been
increased
Pro
I think they're called amateur Pro
why did my ending no it's gone
this is in China because you can tell
that from the Chinese
Great Wall
and this
is
my voice
something
here we go here's the
Great Wall
wow wow why is the ground so slippery
it looks like
bye bye bye all right
bye bye
have a
nice
continuation yeah I don't know where
you're from if it's night day
I'm doing terrible
and that and then I fell into this
bye bye cata Rollins
I do like the name
it's morning uh so you're in
somewhere
on the American continent
yeah
I do like the cats part of me
a cat named Rollins
you didn't prefer me to if it was
rolling so Rollins
but it's fine
[Music]
oh a car being in the wrong way
your car is standing still now it stands
still even more
it's a shame you can't change color of
the car
I wish I wouldn't be surprised since the
vertex colors
so it shouldn't even be hard to change
because as far as no wait maybe the art
takes yourself cars
and there are the lights are they are
textures and cars in that case it's not
included like the hood and the door has
pictures
but the rest of the car is just vertex
color
and I fell down in the water again
that's two more dnfs okay
here we go
Greenways I should win this race
I'll show you but I think I have to win
two tracks
before I get a new car
let's change it back there
close games
it need to help
too fast
it's not
[Music]
sorry
to the ground
nobody
pointer
Mass
passed away yeah that driver is dead
but still driving perfectly nervous
[Music]
so slippery
it's not been this slippery
in the other tracks which has been
blessings and gravel
I'm not sure why
I mean it makes sense that it is
slippery
but in that case
I'm not sure where
we go
ballistic wire trans dnfs because the
losses
I wanted to count the losses but I
forgot
and now I don't know how many times I've
lost
and also I didn't count dnfs when I quit
the race
me she's technically on the NFS one
okay this isn't
this isn't going well can I do something
more here
and why have I lost my voice sounds and
okay
let me
drop my controller
oh we got a new viewer welcome let me
and read what you wrote
hey what the voice changes are you what
I'm not using a voice changer
is it sounding that weird let me check
um okay and how does this sound
okay
how does this sound it sounds perfectly
normal to me I'm not using a voice
changing
I'm sorry I take it back using some very
sweet
no it's no worries uh
I was just surprised
it's quite a
H thank you for the follow
um
all right I was scared to drink for my
I don't even know how to pronounce your
name
I need GT
that's my first attempt
so um
I want to see if I can level it yeah
height of the car or something I don't
know if that helps
I missed messing around and seeing what
works
so um
it was a funny comment I think
but I do know about the uh there's a
voice changer that
I've done that it kind of feels better
this with a lower right height
and I just can't remember what the name
of the voice change is it has a very
generic name
which another stream is using because he
has the redeems
and I do wish to get to 50 followers so
I can start
using Channel points I'm very thankful
for your follow
that's one step closer 250
was now
39 Oh that's increased a lot recently
but I thought I think two followers
don't count
the Zona 37 that counts towards
everything Asian but anyway back to the
voice uh two of the dream teams or yeah
theater rooms one is to increase the
pitch and the other is to lower the
pitch
and
yeah I guess that's basically
and I was
a few years how that would affect me
much like what happens if I do the
increased pitch voice changing
yeah I don't I'm I'm already kind of and
I'm
not
uncomfortable it wouldn't be the exactly
correct thing but I have been
self-conscious about my speaking
it's not really about my voice I'm
actually fine with how I sound
which I know isn't normal I'm strange
it's mostly my accent I've been worrying
about
like her that I would come up with
something
like
I was going to use the term stupid but
that's not the timer that is for them
that was the first thing that came to
mind that's not the correct term
um
because I feel like I had that I
obviously have an accent that is not
native uh foreign I think it's called
it's not really good time because
I'm trying to think of times now
non-native accent there we go
but it's not like uh so I'm Swedish but
I don't feel like it's overly Swedish
like other
British people
so it's kind of like this uncanny valley
of accent
that that's more of what I was looking
for
and that's the part that kind of makes
me
uh
self-conscious I guess
so yeah it was very hard for me to start
speaking online
but I had some friends
help me like
watch my first stream so
and helped me get started so then
certainly very thankful for that
and now I'm just
speaking freely
then playing this game terrible oh I'm
fifth place but I have not been able to
catch up within our cars that means that
one of them fell into rewarded
now
if the other four could also fall down
in the water that would be nice
why is this truck so difficult
maybe I should do the UK track anyway
[Music]
and I do want the ease it
mm-hmm
yeah I don't need to continue
do you want to quit
um
I wonder if is it every second race I
win that I like a car which is
specifically this second track of a
location that unlocks the car
damping yeah I don't know what all this
stuff does
the car height has helped or not it
feels like it has helped
yeah I think
um
reach the
why is this so hard
being able to beat these tracks before
oh yeah close killing because this
okay
um
let's go back to normal
[Music]
thank you
and I don't there is also a championship
mode but I don't know if unlocking the
cars unlocks them in most modes
because otherwise I could
do that
unlock some cars and then go back to
Arcade and finish it off
but
it would be that
see this methods are doing it but
and I don't even know it works
you must not sure if this game is meant
to take place in one day but considering
that
airplane flying by I assume so
and I assume this upper path is quicker
than the double path that's enough as
water slowing it out that does not
but then I slipped off the track and got
slowed down but I'm not pizza
in the end doesn't matter
yeah they kinda
dry faster than me
I know it breaks my scars are cute
so
let's see if I can no I'm trying too
much after it so
and that's going to be nice
especially with the Cardiff softing
around like that
and that's
I'm just not good at this I'm not able
to do this
yeah the car I had this is
driving away and I had no chance of
catching up
foreign
further does that help
I wish I could have two different
tunings for me
asphalt section and the gravel section
now the opponent's cars are just just
faster than my car am I supposed to
catch up
okay
thank you
[Music]
just crashing through like that
I'm accuracy to them many times I guess
it's fine
[Music]
and onto the ground section
it is going better
and this time
yes under the right height
no idea I'm just guessing
it also depends on the physics engine of
being more than reality because it
doesn't seem like everything but
intimate with the catch up with him I
don't think I will win probably have to
do a lot of modification
I was thinking about
as an aggressive steering or something
because it turns a bit too aggressively
like this is the grip and everything
problems using a stick to steering I did
try to push the stick just a little bit
make it small corrections but it turns
away too much
[Music]
oh it goes well but that's the
purple car is in second place so there's
another area
here I'm driving half the time in the
cars and I'll find my breath
okay I guess we'll take the number five
off okay
[Music]
getting stuck on the edge
polygons are so big
but the ankles are Sharp
[Music]
first place that's quite Improvement
but yeah I'm not going to catch up
especially when it turns faster so let's
do further adjustments let's try to
reduce the steering or something I don't
know
it's sitting smooth there is the same
smoothly I don't know what it does let's
see what it does
okay uh let's let's
one more try
that doesn't really count this
a proper test
I don't drive him worse
don't
being a difference otherwise then or
more than I'm driving terribly
I'm driving worse than before but that
doesn't mean the car is performed worse
than before
I do see Sparks Fly and okay this is the
hand just try so terribly now
I mean I could try aggressive steering
see how that feels
okay so far
put lighting what can't get
got away from the lawn
is that coming on
I came out let's see
I see a lot of crashing happening up
here let's see if I can get around these
cars
thank you now again again as soon as I
pass the last car in that Collision they
have to tack on these some kind of
some kind of rule they have and then
they are passing
I think that I was in second position
oh
you know so I'm not sure why they can so
easily get ah they're already gotten
stuck over there I guess that's my
chance of winning if they
crash somewhere
because the crashes are random
foreign
last position
uh
and I drive into that someone is sending
me a message on the phone
I'm busy
it was sent email a message to me okay
from spring length where spring length
break line break bias
yeah ratio final ratio close
normal phone
wait others see that controls this
so I could just put it on normal and
then adjust it down here instead
oh it's very fine
I'll say whatever
so if I put it on the very lowest
it is very low slow excavation
in the first game
[Applause]
and then it starts losing speed as soon
as it gets to the second year okay that
was a fun test
obviously
so I can introduce that a bit
okay I see so I can use foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I guess
I guess
[Music]
so cute
and then I'm tackled
everything was going so well
okay
about Lori standing outside
outstanding in the field
it makes me think this that one of the
blue cars has crashed over there
and then I
maybe I should take the lower path even
though there's water
needs to be easy
another crash when I crashed too
trashed on my own
they crashed together I assumed it just
together
why does our touch much
there isn't much difference between
a light Mount smelling the sticky a
small amount
thanks for tackle
oh my this isn't going great
e welcome back oh my god I've always
been here we didn't see you went away
no you said you went away yes you said
so welcome back
welcome back and
watch me find these ways again but I'm
trying
I am keeping my best
and what's with the E by the way e
is that noise
if you have care when you're saying
something right now or something
[Music]
[Music]
well again you put my attention so
unless that's kind of a thing in some
part of twitch I haven't seen it
but you can just write one letter like
that
what is this your thing
could be that too
yeah
um
I am doing
why did I care for one set of road to
the other side I am doing terrible
400 meters behind already
when it's only 400 meters I do think
there's some kind of rubber banding
I mean I should take the lower stock
I mean I just don't want to do
yeah I just need to stay on the road if
I do that it's going to get better
18 seconds just now
I don't like how they're using a colon
for these are small places
that's not how you use a column
sorry when the time is counting I can
see that
it's the 10 seconds
but when it gives me the final time and
still using columns
I mean obviously it's not hours minutes
and seconds but it's still takes me it
takes me a moment to realize what it's
actually sense
so
I should at least win one of these races
before this before it's been three hours
perfect
I mean it's
[Music]
come on
I mean
please
[Music]
[Music]
stay on her own now
come on
here we go
[Music]
new lab record oh
really
in that case I have a quick race because
I think this
I don't remember how this does if you
choose to restart if you remember the
record
and then I get to insert the record one
eye
yeah that's it
but I don't do much
hello kitten welcome in
fast pump on and when it's going so fast
she runs off the road
I'm only in fourth place but only the
first place counts
so I have constantly the before yeah as
when I said that this game is going to
get more difficult when you got to 32
seconds
face I guess second league
it's getting pretty difficult before
because the first I could easily get
first places but as soon as I get to
this league
in barely
called worthless
you're losing it and running interesting
stuff
thank you for little
so yeah
doing great no I'm not doing it I mean
I'm doing like
in the game I'm doing horrible
last I fell from the fourth to fifth
position that's not great
being the stone wall I guess and even
though I was turning slow I mean
relatively slow and this piece of
base in his skin just means weird and I
still managed to lie down sorry slide
Glide and slide off the road I mean
Instagram account but still
I'm okay at these type of games oh
I would like to see it play
how lucky
yeah obviously I'm okay with these games
too that's why I'm losing
that's the this game when you get to the
second phase the second half of game is
Stephanie
they gotta race over
28 cents seconds to snow for a record
it is not nice
by the way it is
well what it would be nice to have court
layouts that he could easily put a
quarter layout here but the benefits of
having it in a practical order is that
on as a word
for my name has all the letters in a row
which is nice
but a lot of
that's that's a whole Topic in itself
on-screen keyboards on the PlayStation
one
yeah
maybe I should go back to China
since this was UK I'm not doing great
there maybe maybe I can do better
in China
um drink
one more try
when I got by
just want to win
UK or China
those are the only two tricks available
because I've already completed a lot of
tracks
oh they're crushing
one car
you guys
and also since it's a place in one game
it's not widescreen so I got some
Place foreign
I would like her to animate but I mean
we're pushing the limits of the
universities
we are already in second place
oh bye
it is possible that
because
and skipping his hair now I could
explain
I'm really sorry to give you you know
the basic rules but
if you fall into the water you're out of
the race there's no recovery from that
so if you as the player fall into water
it's over for you and you lose the race
if the computer falls in the water they
are out of the race
meaning that if my position
all of a sudden switches to one
or first is quite firm that means that
the leader actually fell into water
and died
I mean
just to the opponent fun and it's fun to
fall into the water and buy it's really
fun
and it's three laps so
but I do like the game I do think it's a
bit brutally hard here and I mean the
difficulty Spike going to the second
phase of the game is a bit too harsh
but aside from that I do find the game
to be a bit fun because it
it's kind of an assimilation in the
sense of do you just drive a car
so it doesn't have like any
bonuses and things like that it doesn't
do like you cannot use
power slides to go faster on Corners you
don't have any boost you charge up like
you need for speed
something like that it's just it's just
driving
oh no
oh thank you
but it is on the PlayStation one so the
installation accuracy is not great
the it's still got this archaic feel
it's okay because word I know our cake
is a word but that's nothing
um
or maybe it is and so she has got quite
the 156 engine going on as well
but that kind of what makes it fun to
play
but second place I mean it's quite
wait it's really nice
still in the second place
forget about this car
corner
yeah can I get the card protein please
I'm not good at that
um yeah curve would be the cognitive to
the Swedish word used on racing tracks
while Corner would be the actual term
used
for car racing
and now it's corner but sometimes I take
care you can do it I'm I'm I am really
trying
but
yeah it is a tough challenge
yeah um
I'm not going to Ministries but I can
give it another chance
and see
if I can do better and also another
earthquake arcadic feel to this game is
that when you start a race I will start
in the last position
and have to work yourself up
proper racing game would have some kind
of qualification round
to determine which position you will
have
or in the case of a Forza Horizon
for summer sports that's the game
damn
in that game
you start in the order of performance of
the car so high higher performance they
have some
calculated performance value
the higher performance your car have if
further forward you've been stacked
which has the benefit of cars being
performing better
ahead of course performing words
they will get into that position lightly
so why not stop in that position it
makes sense but the problem is that you
as the player get some kind of penalty
so your performance value is lower
so you don't start in your correct
position you start a bit lower than the
computer players they're kind of
cheating a bit
so you still start at the last position
at the start of the race and like in
early races but as you improve your car
and you start further ahead if your car
is out performing the other cars
I'm also good at the forcing multiple
games yeah those are inserted in this
game
I mean it's easier to drive the car in
the first place
I am definitely staying on the road more
than in this game and a lot of off the
road in this game
but I have
to do other racing games I want to try
one is Motorsport that's not the theme
of the game and it's about the racer
that's the name of the game
it's kind of weird race because it's a
it's it's a motorbike motorcycle
racing game
and so they took the most motor
motorcycle and then put on racer to it
but
um cars have Motors too
the name is ambiguous
but it's a motorcycle racing game at
least
and that's another racing game I haven't
completed
and for some reason I'm wearing turban
now
so I'll give it a one try
at the ordinary racing game I want to
try which I do find the most fun to play
is Need for Speed
Road Challenge I was known as high
stakes
because I think it's the fourth gaming
series because it has a carrier mode
when you start with a sum of money
and then you
[Music]
and
buy a car
then you compete in races where you earn
money depending which position you end
up in
and then
the cars take damage so you cannot just
drive a
colliding with everything you have to be
careful not colliding stuff because as
your car takes damaged it would perform
worse and then after the race
or between raises you have the option to
repair the car
and it will cost more than more damages
which I guess
colliding in the candles I can get past
them let's let's see what they do right
I might play a racing game in the future
yeah I would like to see that but you
have to
have something to speak
and
[Music]
so
like you should be able to use your
phone
I assume you have
unless you use the phone no I mean
you must have a computer streaming from
because you do stream
um
but yeah so you should be able to they
should likely be an app you can
basically
yeah because I've used an app that
allows me to use the phone as a webcam
but it must definitely a app you can use
the phone
a microphone
sure it might not be the best audio but
that doesn't matter
but I mean it's not the phone doesn't
have too bad audio
I've heard some from recordings and
artists give it enough
it's good enough for streaming and and
then you can apply some depending on
what streaming service you're using you
should be able to add something like
noise reduction
to improve the audio quality feather
as I do not have oh you have a mic now
even voice the next and great we
actually got a problem like him great
you can still apply the noise reduction
which I have done now
I hope my ID voice my voice I hope today
isn't that constant noise in the
background no more but I speak at least
reduced
that's what I could hear from my voice
from my phone
goodbye game over
it sounds good fine but I will be able
to listen back to this on my computer
the words
eh should I try again
not in second place the first time I
went back to the track and then and then
the two words
because I mean
yeah I do prefer watching streams when
you have someone speaking
because otherwise I mean otherwise it's
just gameplay yeah I'm sure the streamer
is playing with
a part of what I find fun with streaming
is just the connection between the
streamer and the Watchers something you
don't have on YouTube
and
yeah basically watching a stream without
a microphone is
well the Washington without the
microphone that's what they usually do
you're watching a streamer without a
microphones almost like watching a
YouTube video
[Music]
like you can't play
without a voices
anyway
I mean sure you still have the internet
and still have
in you can still write in the comments
yeah this is going great right
yeah quick restart
and
the
treatment can still write in the comment
section I mean that's that's happened
before
I don't know it just doesn't feel insane
well I forgot about the corner again
I will try racing game whenever yeah
your game is done it should be seen okay
I mean that makes sense
I have
free games going on at the same time
right now
oh if I had some extra time left I
decided to do
is some extra streams
and I've gotten three new followers
in these screams that's great amazing
I'm very sneakable for the people
yeah
so now it's tilted up
I thought it said 39 hours before
someone remember following which is
perfectly fine I mean if you don't want
to follow anymore that's fine
[Music]
what color did you at least wait to
unfollow until after late
oh well it's fine it's fine
it's your father which is what he wants
to do with it
anyway
[Music]
so
yeah when I reach
for disappeared I wonder why well
the corner but the red car also forgot
about the corner
yeah this isn't going great
um it's fun to try an anime
so
yeah I think I think this game is beyond
my abilities so maybe I should try a
different
on Wednesday I was going to play this
computer this game because that because
I'm not able to like progress better on
this point I don't I don't think I
should continue I think I should give up
I'm not normally the person to give up
on games
but I mean
I I've tried this lemon for probably
least 40 minutes now I think
and I think if I if I get stuck at the
same point in the game I mean it's maybe
the game is beyond my abilities and I
could get back to it late points
I have seen the game
and let's game over
um batting o'clock three hours into the
stream a perfect timing
so
I guess that's that
that's sad I guess that was what I
originally originally said that I would
do the first five or was it six
the first six tracks of the
SE certified
the first five tracks of the amateur
says
and then I will do the professional
series uh one on Wednesday but
considering I'm
why doesn't it select the question UK
and China I'm stuck at these two levels
I cannot progress and I guess this is
the end of the game for me
oh well let's see I try not to give up
on games
the card game I always gave up but on
but my friend told me don't give up on
it but this really depends on if you
still make any progress at all
like for example
I try to encourage people when I watch
them play Spyro
to uh
yesterday circuits
yeah
to and not give up on the
flight levels that's what it was going
for there we go Africa I had the fastest
lap time on track one to not give up on
the flight levels and try again you can
see yourself making progress as you
because you have
32 things to pick up or destroy and the
level
and you can see that you are making
progress to more and more things you do
collect
but the problem here is that I have 140
minutes basically made no progress at
all
so I would say
it really depends on the situation if
you are going to give up or not
and I think in my case
thus I think my stream is getting a bit
boring
so
yeah but um
so I said I was going to click now so
thank you for showing up
and
said should I do I read I mean I've done
that every time now
well this only to watch now Hello Kitty
welcome thank you
yeah
it's fun when you shut up and I knew you
were busy and it had the time show up at
the start of it
it's fine that you've only been able to
show up anyway
and I don't know who this second person
is maybe it's never still lurking
so
I don't know with these two watches
let's go over to Shadow Darko who I
followed very recently who also have two
Watchers so I guess that's fine and
who is currently playing
Spyro
so
why not
easy to just copy the read message which
is just
and they read That's all let's copy and
then when you get into the other channel
just paste it
I would
assume it's C so
it's not explicitly stated
now I will
I don't know it's a female character
that's a female looking character so
that's what I
went on
it's always good to always State what
genders you want to be prefer to be
refer to as
so anyway let's move over there oh I got
a lot of watches officer welcome
everyone we're the stream is over and
we'll
going our way to Shadow darker now see
you there and
currently trying to defeat ripto so it's
a good moment
the channel
foreign
