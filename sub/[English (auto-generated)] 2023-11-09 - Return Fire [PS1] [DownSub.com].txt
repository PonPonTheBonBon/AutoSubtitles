aggressive all of a

sudden okay can you can you stop with

quietly

mostly working my

garden but I did take some breaks and

back at was was going

go well how are you doing doing fine I'm

happier that I can actually get some

progress done with

my at

game that I actually can

play and don't have to like

being really really bad

at which has been a Ste these last

days that might be bad of a game I just

need to know how how to

play okay taking a lot of damage

now okay I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm moving

yeah it is and I hope you made some

progress in your

game I don't know the game

free I got my when I yeah I know I did

see here I just didn't say

go so

much stuff

anyway there we

go so many

Towers

okay let's

see now I can't remove

it oh I'm

sorry I guess I wasn't allowed to remove

it

uh let's see oh yeah I got four

Milestones

ooh to reach the middle part of the game

almost half right

there I got my yeah yeah blank time to

blankies time to

relax

jump into bed put on a blanket I don't

know if that's saying this

stuff guess he don't put on the blank I

don't

know well this is a safe path I

guess

I will continue

here what

this soldiers I can

uh these things go

who a bit too close there they got a bit

upset

could take care of this one

too

boom and

now another one of these comes

boom I'm

gun time to Mo

back that does sound nice to being after

the stream streaming can be tiring

sometimes but it's nice

to get to talk to nice people like

hesome

egg you might recognize whome

egg remember the pretty going on

everyone long time is it

left 6 minutes

okay 6 minutes left to put in your

points now this Val number that has been

PR for will

win they will always be a

winner

okay so

we trying to reach that

Tower someone is shooting

me stop trying to shoot me thank

you let REM

moove oh no no another one of

those get out of here God damn we

see thank

you to REM

move clean up the pass then these things

are trying to shoot

me

okay

nice no more worry about

those is that one strange sh

me almost no

worry I'm lying down the bed while

watching yeah yeah this is true and

don't forget pon

pon I'm trying to be nice as best as I

can nice people everywhere we're here to

have a nice okay so I'm going around and

then guess I'll just loop around the

[Music]

whole the whole

Cloud the whole mushroom top

there and yeah that's my plan

I think it's a good

plan so let's see in this are oh a tower

of

ocean

okay

so bring around

here so many buildings

okay it's a bit hard

to get

around and these

are

th oh they're bouncing into each

otherly that doesn't destroy

them okay I'm going to remove a bunch bu

of these buildings just because I

want you can you

stop

pleas I'm trying

to clean up your base making it nice and

clean

he there we

go a problem

with I reach

far so problem with trying to go up

there is the

uh tow

there so

I do hope the to on left side doesn't

cause me any

issues I want to

see I have a little bunny flashy

watching with

me you

should post photos of your little bunny

plushing on the

server I like seeing bunny plushing

I should be a but oh wait that was

idea I that many many times but I can't

help mention it because I like the idea

so

much small

but so moving up

up up

up

it's much safer now can I go

here

nope there was a

one

oh where see the flag buildings

now almost there

this okay let's take care of

these these towers here

oops almost

dead okay I'm I'm H

home it was a good

run and that that's what

[Music]

counts pun ding a tank

I'm wearing her sports

outfit because it can get quite hot in a

tank therefore it's a good idea

to wear something

more I guess revealing you could

say look a bunny

plusy outfit idea having F fun wearing a

Christmas tree shaped

dress like a dress with a Christmas tree

p on

it

yay more sport

way when the timer is up it will switch

over to the spb from the spb

okay I'll get to that

after take care of

these G with

those no and

then there

go not really since if uh shell pish the

hall it

will SC the sharen all around

what wait wait wait what are we talking

about

now I think I think I missed the context

here so many min here probably have to

bring up the

helicopter

but there are too

many who who way too many Towers

here really bring after him

okay must make it safe

okay better the F show

up was doing such a nice job cleaning up

the

area

[Music]

Okay

so back to uh what you were talking

about

here

so petty bunny tummy soft pets bunny

tummy softly pets bunny

tummy yeah I

would I would make a routin for that

when I got to go over to 3D and have a

hand touching the bunny

tummy h i was commenting on having

revealing clothing an armored

vehicle oh but

but it's hot in the tank she needs to

veing

closing then that's less closing they'll

have to clean out from a wound in such

an

event if it's hot in Attack the attack

needs enough great

nah there has put sunless close

Okay a SP bra and a nice

skirt all wait I was supposed to bring

up the helicopter and well guess I'll

remove more of the powers

first

stop shooting me what have I done I mean

I said from infiltrating the base

but that's going into too much

D okay another another one of

these oh already very

damaged I think this should be safe for

a helicopter

now we sure I

could get rid of that one

too okay let's see if I can get out of

here without dying to

mines there's a flank building

there

okay let me

[Music]

see yeah tanks do not have air

conditioning that's how sleevess

Shad got the name tank

top apparently Indian

soldiers have gotten

temperature past unconsciousness in

T90

no

uh I

think the we call you to in heat

management of the tank and producer try

to fix this

and yeah maybe it shouldn't get that

hot

and wear

uh and pon pon exposing her T is

probably not going to do

[Music]

[Music]

much

come on why didn't that

[Music]

explode what I'm

sorry

sorry getting to first the

tower okay um

I'm

believeing I think I did good

there the main reason this was that

didn't being USR attack and it was being

used I guess that's a

point there a with different amount of

heat yeah fly thing yeah they can easily

overpower the H

helicopter if you don't take care of

them

early and I F I felt I was going to f

that but I managed to do

it and that's what C

so now let's

see if I can destroy some flag

buildings I'll take a take a left around

this going this

way there

one being guarded by

Tower using

already but I just came

here

okay

so just going through here A

B There we go that's that

one no another one missed

it there we go

so that

one that

one not close

enough

two F

since maybe time to go

home three of

them EAS

now this ain't

good

come

on can I restuck

somewhere okay now it's I need the G

car I the

tank guess uh H although it's quite a

quite far quite a lot left there

but

concerned oh

no thank

T next tank

time tank number two

time there's a place the active stock up

on munition but I'm not sure if there's

another place up here quite far down

that

onear

to yeah I don't I don't know if there's

one closer

by

okay stupid buildings in the

way on much I want to shoot the

time

okay how far up do I have to

go oh flying

see all right with this tank it's basing

possible

[Music]

shooties oops shot the few

dude should I go home or not I don't

know

stupid okay nice go

oh let's go home now

then go around not

mine still too many

mines

probably

[Music]

do I need aing

[Music]

maybe like these two places here to

restock and a third there but not all

the way up where the flag buildings are

and I do know there's a two one down

here too

but but I'm working my way up

there

yeah heavy tank D time for light

tank Think Tank time time for little

tank

thank can't do

it just have

to navigate on the Mind

here

no one

more and there's the flag buing up

there oh another M

there

okay oh both trees went

away how easy to take so much damage

with this tank and then I had to return

home

and I guess I should bring out the

helicopters I remove those

mines I don't have to worry about

them

[Music]

should her up F to get

home the home is not far at least it's

not like a massive

level have done wor

levels

much wor lamels than this

one but only have like

one of each type he not

helpy wait that's not the one going

[Music]

for and I missed

it it was these I was going

for okay let's see where's the first one

[Music]

[Music]

here

[Music]

then

there's danger up ahead no time to move

back here we

go move along

the

the wall of

[Music]

towers so they don't shoot down the

helicopter that would be

unfortunate and back to the

tank not much left left until I reach

that flly

building

and I wonder if I can attack those other

flag buildings without having to go

through the

whole massive uh array of

towers although going through them might

be not not like driving

through destroy them one by one might be

still

be

then I have to be careful because they

can be mines but the radar does not say

there's any mines just

here so much safer

now so much

[Music]

safer

go

right we

are buing in the

way okay let's Mo

that reach

you I guess we remove that too

there up there is the

flank so the question

is it it's better to go

through this

array of towers or

okay I'm kind of wasted all my B

on I done good progress

there that me just strategize a bit

more there a long way up

here definitely need

to f up

brush bunny ears

oh do me like petting or using a

brush and do you mean your bunny or pon

pon oh using a

brush that sounds fun

okay yeah I don't think I want to go

through there right so I go through

those the cluster of three there

instead and then I can

attack and if attack

them from

S I don't have to go through

everything that does sound like a

smarter

idea and this might be a rather quick

map quick for considering the other

Maps they been here for like 45

minutes

so guess I take that

way so it's like up

here what what

well

those that

[Music]

one

huh you mean to attack attack the

G love you trying to get through

here sometimes you feel like I'm

actually shooting the

trees but it goes through the

trees

okay maybe attacking From

Below is it exactly an

option I might need to use

the yeah I would I would need to use the

helicopter for that but should I risk

it oh no oh no this isn't

good oh missed

it yeah I just can't hit it and I'm mind

there just can't hit

it and I'm out of no that was a complete

by

oh run tank run

run there we go shes me Shades me let

play Quicken than me

no tank

r that



okay I didn't mean to shoot it down

like I gu now more of

them like they are impossible to

 okay so right with like a one HP

but they are so hard to shoot for some

reason and I don't know

why don't know

why okay I can't really get across the

water there so I guess I just have to

approach them from the other way and

also I only have two Jeeps he

sleep s the sexy

bun

well this was a waste of one of

those me I'm going to have a nap still B

feel free to take a nap if you want

to nothing feel sad about

it you

can listen to my beau beautiful voice is

she going to bed or

something

so of Lu you got this oh oh man I'm I

messed up a bit

here here it comes

oh I hit it one first try so

weird feel like I hit those much easier

at the

start when I first played

this but time went on I become worse at

hitting

them

specifically with the with the smaller

tank well I guess I just have to be

careful to do a lot of back and

forth

anyway just Place take C on and have a

good

day have a good sleep nap or

so you hold

some

so is ready is

ready I don't know if the music is

though I really a bedtime

story although I'm not so good at

coming up with

stories I don't don't have anything to

read from

so oh

ANS thattime story I know a bedtime

story I don't trust stories from you you

what you

mean

strength

okay way too

many towers and buildings and

stuff

[Music]

Here Comes St ring

that and I can't

you

how am I supposed to shoot

it

finally so hard to

Sho and I don't get

why

[Music]

anyway once there was an ugly

barnacle Who you calling ugly it was so

ugly I should got that

too everyone died the end that doesn't

sound like a nice

story

there was a little rabbit known as

on she liked

pink but she was a white

rabbit so she decided to put on a nice

pink

dress

I don't

know okay first

off

destroy this one there we go that one's

gone now we

then Mo up

here

don't shoot me don't shoot

me okay

so oh another

one and then this

one oh wi I guess it's time to go home

then oh

it

whoops I shouldn't have come

there I did not get rid of those to

so that was an awkward

[Music]

moment moving home hopefully I survive

this

I'm being very careful

now what color

dress would she wear if she had been a

pink

bunny that's a good

question that I don't

know

maybe a dress sming her eye

color maybe a Blue Dress light blue

dress okay let's

see pink bunny in a like

dress that do look

nice maybe I should make a version of

pum like

that

okay come

on just got

here

I keep missing the

power oh hello Two

Towers there just three towers but

whatever oh there have four

Towers okay I actually don't know where

to go so I will stop oh I I'm supposed

to

go I was on the right

PA I'm going the wrong

way

well there we go now we're right

way got a bit confused there with the

layout but

now better fuel up a lot and I see that

seem

coming too

often I got one of

them and the other one

nice

nice make aeem die p p pink I mean I

guess that's okay I should continue down

there and then continue

up I guess that's not a terrible idea to

like change pon pon Fair

color

p p

p found a star

Ro is wife the

[Music]

story I'm moving through this Labyrinth

here

so I should continue down

here

Tower another

Tower and that is

Highway then there's you

I don't care about you

Towers care about you though

so excuse me I'm not I'm not dealing

with you at the

moment okay this is a bit too many time

waste

whoops I'm going oh

seen you

before I've been lurking

around oh it's nice to find more

bunny so I hope I hope everything went

fine yeah was

good I can't find the correct

words I guess my

English collection of words is too

restrictive no need to get food yeah of

course of course do get food do get

rest stay as long as you want

but feel free to go if you need to the

usual

AB enough pressure to

say I appreciate it

still but I appreciate people just

coming by even if it's a short

time

so

let's

see it's a ter

shooting want taking half

damage oh it's this

turn and so that was that building not

much foring

now oh no

okay oh no I'm dead I'm dead

now and this thing is off me

too or I managed to destroy okay I

cannot get hit by anything

now that will destroy the whole time I

need to get home

again that attack went terrible I mean I

made progress I mean that

count that's what's

important

it wasn't for nothing but it was yesn't

yesn't wasn't to

efficient going to come

[Music]

back so

moving

yeah I I never present myself during

rids you know it's usually how want to

do

so I am pon pon I am a bunny but that

might have been

obious I am from

Sweden I want to speak English as my

second

language I sometimes struggle with it

but most of the time it's it's

fine I've had a a lot of focus playing

PlayStation One games in recent

recently so I got that

one but then I have to work my way up

there because I need to reach

day the building p is to the north

work it be wait

what like I guess the unfortunate part

of naming myself pon pon is that some

might abbreviate it as

PP and

um well I guess I

guess yeah it's

funny since I am a trans woman so

I guess it's applicable in some

sense your transform I didn't

know can I remove this

one that one makes never a bit

easy

Papa happy oh h i

to with the pun welcome nice to see you

here PP the

[Music]

BB yes I PE

[Music]

be and I am a piece ful tank trying to

establish

peacefulness by

attacking

everything I don't know what the green

team is supposed to be

but oh no you

don't

nice well than is the

way there

go okay I think that was

good not M massive progress but progress

none this and that's what

counts I just remove

these

you can't annoy me anyway back to what

you were saying Pap wolf might sound

offensive but I wouldn't have guessed it

when I first met you I'm not sure how

that would

Beany don't

worry and honestly that's what some

people have said that

like you don't even sound like

a

there is

some and there there like sometimes I

like listen to some streamers and like I

can hear a

certain a certain way this

sound that reminds me of

well myself practicing my

voice not going through

that I don't know how to describe

it this the transform

sound and then just actually and then I

read like an attacks or something

that they

are

that you with friend my comp says oh you

don't sound as offensive

hey I could see that be because I've

heard

like yes I have heard that argument

before

uh if there is a native speaker of the

language but they are uh from like the

their ethnicity isn't really

native H the main example would be a

black person in United States that's

like why I heard it before and said oh

your English is so good or something

like that that can come out come off as

offense because they that person can

have lived in United States their whole

life but at least something like that I

understood

it so but I understand also that uh

you're being careful and I I can respect

that

too uh but I don't think you have to be

because I don't expect you to say

anything

uh uh

like I I wouldn't expect you to be a

mean person if if that like if you if

you would say something that would uh

who like comoss is offensive I wouldn't

consider that as intentional that makes

sense and

honestly personally when especially when

it comes to like trans people I cannot

speak for every trans obviously but one

one of the things I've

uh heard from other trans people is that

when you pass as the while the gend

you're trying to

be and one of them beinging that your

voice

sounds uh well as the gender you're

trying to

be that that's it's a great feeling and

I I really like it when people say that

I do sound feminine especially when they

didn't wasn't even sure I wasn't a woman

like I wasn't a woman I am a woman that

wasn't friend that was the word I was

looking for uh

I'm offensive to myself

now there was a not a trans woman I kind

of missed the word

there TR yeah I'm going wrong

way H and that's that's a great feeling

because then I pass as a woman and

that's what I want to

do obviously I can I said I can speak

for every trans

person but in general like get that

feeling that and it also makes

sense that makes sense makes sense H and

I'll guess your comments I kind of need

to find a safe way home

here

uh

where I need all right

let's Okay and then I need to keep care

of these

things

where are

you oh it's gone good okay

so yeah it's very contextual yeah

exactly uh I have been accused of being

insensitive before a TR

better I mean it

happens well you are a beautiful lady

thank you like it's there is a

difference yeah wish I try to say like

uh intent and if

something and yeah and I could I could

probably say the same myself I'm I'm

quite I could be quite blunt about

certain things and

can be

like

insensitive I kind of get

that and I guess it's Al it's also

helped me that I have not H presented

myself at trans from the

start is something I decided to do later

on so when you're playing so when you

playing a

Escape I don't

know I consider that it's not on my list

of suggested

games but I could add it if I'm going to

just go through my idea of of completing

every

every every PS1 game is not happening

but uh I sh the other

one

but there is the still the idea of uh

playing through every PS1

game uh and yeah so I

will don't shoot me

me you're so

evil it's like there's some the enemy or

something okay I I leave I leave I got

like

one shot left on that before I can

destroy it but I made prog I made PR

that's what

count

okay

so

well I'm going to put it on your list I

don't is the suggested games uh open for

one to write it I don't remember what I

said it to but uh either case it can be

suggested anyway there and then I will

add it at

least if you can write it in

there uh it's not open

okay yeah I kind of wanted that Chann to

me and I should remove games I wonder

have I any games on it that have played

I have at least like two spy games which

I crossed out because can beat

them or run them no no I couldn't run

them that was

it Shadow Legacy and

[Music]

uh and and dragon

FL what is it meaning I've tried playing

them but I just don't have anything to

run them on at the

moment

but I will run

them when I

can

so okay so I'm making good progress

there I'm getting close to that

one appropriate you have them crushed to

through onion

yeah because H I will play them I just

can't play them right now that's

basically what it means

there's no legend or

anything oh yeah there's

a a lot of games I should

play the question is what should I play

on Monday Tuesday I did say Rayman

question if I should go with

that what if I should go with another

game H

[Music]

keep no I don't think I

can waste a bunch of bullets

so moving for another

attack go think the the tanks mowi

through

water as tanks

do

how many mines

here

try I

know why why do they come so

often I remember one is on way

well yes this one like one yep one hit

point

left still I still don't see the flag on

r

and there's no place to fill up

the

annoying really want to fill up my

bullets cuz I had to travel so far back

and I'm basically traveling all the way

back to the base and then I could just

enter the base and repair the

tank instead

also running up the

F not

good C pushing the tank his seems I need

to refu it next

time

yeah getting very low few

now there should be a place to fill up

fuel down

[Music]

here here it

is

okay good I survived that why do they

come so

quickly some reason I can't shoot them

some here we

go so thre this over go back to

base okay I

am that one is far in but I'm getting

closer need a claw biting P Pon OT

yeah I'm very nervous pon

pon BL see coming pass in this level

sometimes not always there's in case

where bring three

four and sometimes they show up like

immediately when I

refuel like

here I don't think that was immediate

but and sometimes they take their time

before I show up like I can feel like

half the tank before they decide to show

up

and it's very

varied but it doesn't seem to be

consistent within the level

l

so I need a place to

refuel when I'm all the way up

here

[Music]

but is on this there there's one it's

blown up but I guess you can say there

was

one oh well that def makes things

harder

you stop

shooting here we

go and one

this oh I'm another one

here one another one of

things and it's ATT is almost destroyed

already okay

now

boom that's how we deal with

it okay that was a

I mean I destroy

oh well yep okay it had three hit buts

left okay there's one

there which could come in quite

handy why is still like one Tower Two

Towers did it but I know still going

this

way I'm not supposed to go that

way I'm supposed to go this

way anyway go

go go go go go I'm

going there's one there too

so I guess I could secure that

area there we

go there comes one and there comes the

second

[Music]

just

at least those are easy to take care of

go go

go there we

go so there is like

oh I'm getting a bit sweaty here I said

like it's been 45 like 45 minutes and 11

that's been too long now it's been like

hour 30

minutes I'm still not

done oh I this is going to take a

wind and it

comes

Boom at least you only have to shoot him

once but

still wish they were a bit more easy to

shoot because they do deal a lot of

damage they actually do as much damage

as the towers do but they shoot so

quickly yeah of course much much easier

to take down than a

tower in the sense of uh you have to

shoot it

once but that's still quite annoying to

even

hit oh thank you tower for shooting that

one

down well I guess I don't have that one

either and

I guess wait this tow Miss should be as

strong as tank bullets and well maybe a

tank bullet shoots down one in one

shot

maybe maybe I'm mising

that

oops okay I

see the flag building on the

radar now I have to D

me there we

[Music]

go

there's one at the

bottom no another

fllying oh I got

it I'm was so close to

that

now let's see if I can even make it

back if I and hopefully not run out the

F if the tower went

so we need to shoot down the fuel places

yeah I don't think I have enough fuel to

get back

okay not taking the wrong path this

[Music]

time oh wait there's one here

okay don't get stuck

to

oh don't have time for

this think this tank is

dead okay this

is

y i really I shot like

ah the uh heavy tank thing would

definitely have shot it there but not

the weak

one in

anticipation and I just going get

it I don't need

it

come on shoot

it come on

sh well I guess I have to with the

helicopter oh

[Music]

my that feels a bit impossible

that is what I

[Music]

have

so

oh they're shooting me from that nice

okay let's

[Music]

[Music]

see

[Music]

so not too

F Okay

so

oh me f

[Music]

that with that

[Music]

secured I should be able to fly north of

that thing and reach the FL building not

knowing that the helicopter has so

little

f

hopefully I get this to

work but we'll see I got like one chance

of doing

it

Frank and there's one other flag

building

there

now we see if this

[Music]

works

okay I think I hit it oh fuel a lot of

[Music]

fuel okay so F back

[Music]

home next time will be bullish

rain

and that should hopefully destroy the

[Music]

building come

[Music]

on come

on

going I use safe stat to uh restart

every Fair attempt sure but that's just

[Music]

[Music]

cheating I have to do this

[Music]

properly

[Music]

no

yes get out of here no I'm not going the

right

way

nice now I need

I shoting too far

well don't way

again okay

good one of the two dy I still got the

one me get refunded or is that part of

time saying it

complete

when I don't get the uh time spent until

I get my soon or does the time start

over well that's not established

um well the game does not track how long

it has taken if you get a game

over the time in the game does

restart

so I don't know how we should do it in

[Music]

the one if no agreement can be

made come up

with guess that means

refund

wa

[Music]

[Music]

Okay

so okay so far it actually went pretty

well so okay so time it well I mean

that's how the game does it

so doesn't mean that the prediction has

to do

it but I guess you could say that what's

the timer to complete the level from the

last latest start of the game until

actually complete the first

time

this this I need to

access one of

the

that didn't go as planned

but plan is I will follow the chain of

towers and then I will destroy them and

if a flag happens to

be because there's a flag all the way to

left and right here as well just to be

extra annoying you

know

no

okay oh oh that was closed up who my I

can't mop this controls

there that was close to

game

he I got the hard part then I

guess I hit the building not the

mine

okay

H the building not the

[Music]

mine I make the people evacuate which is

safer for the

people the

uh helicopter is really quick moving

back and

forth people people is leaving the

stream this is getting too nervous for

people to

watch

okay I'm moving I'm

moving there we go finally

D

okay I need no way to follow that chain

I mean I don't need to follow the chain

but it certainly makes it easy for the

Jeep if the flag is down

there plus I can

like the towers are just

ever so slightly too close

together okay moving moving

[Music]

on right in front of it okay

[Music]

so that is my current

[Music]

plan

follow the Shain of

tow down to the

flank

Bo so

way

no

[Music]

AIDS hey I'm not outside okay there's

only one flag building

okay don't have to oh no

that's

it yep came

out when those comes it gets very hard

to deal with

them and then I had to move into land

because

one Marine

came

no only got one chance here that the

flag appears up here

anyway but how I

will

okay how about

attacking and there's not

flag how about attacking the building

that's next there oh

my oh

my there's no point I'm trying the

second

I game

over so much for

that I'll try

again I was like 1 hour 6 5 minutes for

nothing um

ATT H there was a lot of towers it

started welcome back everyone who has ad

I died I have to

restart

and thank you for destroing the tree for

me okay I will I will take

out

there we

go I'll take out the flag over

here oh no he at least those are easy to

deal with

now boom so easy so much

easier don't that's that

one

boom

well yeah I guess the timer starts

otherwise you can just add 1 hour 55

minutes to it but I guess no one had an

objection for start of time it's

basically how long will it take for me

to complete level when I start level

from the

start based on how long

I the first time I complete level and

actually complete the

level yeah I maybe that's why I I don't

know playing the wrong object

over no I didn't mean shoot back sorry

about that

people sorry about destroying your house

here know to

leave I guess that's life when it comes

to

War I mean peaceful

making

okay maybe maybe the towers

are as strong as the missile Vehicles it

still feels like they have to shoot

another Tower five times for

destroyed yeah yeah that should still be

there

two missiles and a tank bullet destroys

the tower two missiles and enemy missile

destroys the tower

team than it for princess pon

pon okay I'm pretty close this one this

one is pretty easy

to to get to if I don't have to deal use

a

helicopter

okay let's

see see they have to shoot their own

Tower a lot before it gets

destroyed there

finally anyway let's just do this

building and Mo on

come

on yes B

CH well one flag being

destroyed

these we arms heavy for Princess P PL of

spaghetti Bing each other should destroy

them yeah that would be nice if they

actually bump sh took

damage okay that one's done then I had

to go the other

way

yep okay I need to move

oh no more of

these now let's give

up it it died way too

quickly I cannot continue without

it

not Afters destroying one flag

building that would be a bit too

quick Lo it

okay let's go the other side

first

oh those towers still Shoot

Me Maybe I need to take care of them

then you are to get taken care

of

because you tell to start

misbehaving

hello but

again welcome welcome it is tank

time

no um bad thing

man not not

one can

you another

one and another

one

yay yeah I shut

them that was a lot of

them too many of

them we too

many

and here they

come hey com St

flying why so many I don't know they

went crazy it's like some in Texas

flying things on the

mosquitoes they are the

mosquitos

mosquitos

running into

water okay

so guess

so

okay

thank

you

okay I actually need to use the B

soon team is f

minutes

okay

oh I'm back

in minutes and 5

Seconds I said five

minutes now it's so

flashy

back to the

game

remember redeems for

outfits I wash your pors obiously who do

you think I

am was the

time

m

okay let's win this

map of course that mean that will only

complete one map this stream but uh if I

spend two hours on my map and fail it uh

yeah guess that's to be

expected

there we go

okay no they all

Me Mine

there you there it

is maybe I should keep that don't go

straight into the

mine T

mes hello hell hello welcome

to Dooms Day that's the name of level

it's uh quite a level it was my Dooms

Day because I fa

it but it is now my mission to not fail

it

and let's

see thank you to for helping me

out all right there we

go and there is the flag

really look like that me was going to

miss okay I'm moving I'm

moving

boom I'm moving I'm moving oh hey where

did you come

from

there you

go I'm close though to destroying that

flag and then I had to destroy the flag

to the

I my mission is to

oh yes you have a cute little bunny

plushy what are you going to name you

little bunny

flhy oh I don't remember how how you

said

that

care that C's

gone

no flying

roing okay now I'm in

trouble

yep I'm never going to be able to throw

that FL building to the left sometimes

it just feels like the tank explodes too

early yeah this this this one is going

to

B things m is going to take

forever why is realize the map is shaped

like a mushroom cloud did you do that

now

well I guess I guess we have different

sense of pattern recognition

and

already I mean I don't need it so close

to the base anyway but but

still

w

I hope every level in this secret world

is it going to be like

this

trying to figure out why it was called

doomsday

when

boom

okay I'm not doing so well I'm doing

quite terly at least I should be able to

be do this map I don't want to end the

stream without finishing this

map

no it missed me well at least I'm close

here

and as soon as they enter the base

they're

gone don't think exactly they take a bit

of time before they despawn

but they gun when you come up

again which of course makes no sense but

we shouldn't they be outside waiting

sh

so nice

progress just want to get rid of the

left one and right one so I can move on

from this and move

north to get back to where I was before

i

p

one

then

is

no moving

on

Miss land right in front of the

tank okay may

men f

f

but I mean as soon as I destroy the flag

balloon to the left here to the West I

don't need to go back here

anymore then I'm

done

he passing still

casually don't mind

me

there go another one and another

one

boom

okay so

now I'm yet again close to the

flag no good

there shouldn't be too hard to reach a

flag

she must have found a secret for them to

be seem

like found where they hide the measuring

bananas

bananas who mes with bananas anyway they

are so

uneven and do you follow the curve of

the

banana

or is it like not the

care am I making this more complete than

is

okay I think out this St the tower s

basically now we need

to just destroy the flag building that's

all I need and then I'm done

wait to left side and it will be the

very first time ever I destroy that

building yeah the tow is in front like

between me and flly are

destroyed

so now let's

see there is the building

there we go building has been

destroyed it did not contain a flag what

a

surprise you might have find the flag in

the very first flag being

destroyed I mean with the exception of

if the sh a single flag

building building destroy the

now I only need to work my way to the

east No

Flag there was no flag in that

building that was

s

when is it had to be in m just

there

okay so since I destroyed all of

that

okay I made progress

but it didn't go as well as I hoped but

I I

survived that's what

counts as long as I hit with single

missile and come back to the base I have

actually made

progress obviously get more hits in is

preferable but progress is

this

so much destruction at the same

time no it

turned there you go no it didn't

turn go go go t t go go go

hey don't shoot

me sneaking the

water

the flying thing didn't like

that okay let's go back and repair the

ATT

thank making it nice and

repain to many flying R things

definitely I don't get why it say so

many well the Tower is thr on the

tower nice

nice go fly building

right

but no flag has to be

expected hey what is this fly see come

from

so I got

on wait

flank now there must be WS I hope yeah

there not the

fling do up

north now have to do

you're not cleaning

again I don't know why there so many of

them

who have I

angered

is

now destroy the

knce then I who's angry maybe F Sho

see maybe the green base is angry for

once

okay

maybe I can remove some of the mines

going to

beate

on there

[Music]

go mine's taking

care

oh I be should in pain

but what is done is

done

still shooting

me there we

are don't like the placement of that

mind

[Music]

this m I didn't like

[Music]

just in case in case I decid to go down

there why not to

mind has annoyed me so many

[Music]

times I don't like it stupid face

showing up on your

pineapple pizza te p

p okay uh nice and

safe until I come up

here

yep now it's not safe

anymore stop

stop

boom run run run run run run

run wait stop

shooting he took pity in me you didn't

even cost my pineapple how am I supposed

to eat these

yeah like a whole pineapple on my

pizza p

app

he sorry sorry I'll move

on okay too

often run run run run run run run

run

so I

do making some progress I look the dress

is

back the dress the

dress the dress is

back

when I shoot those small buildings with

the tank have people escaping but when I

shoot the small buildings with

missile

and I was I am aware just whis in two

different ways there but for it h there

are no people escaping so I guess they

were trapped in a rub Rubble

Rubble yeah is

cing doesn't really work because it's

supposed to be four

syons yeah I should I should sing that

song

Koke someone has to remind me what

the in a pink

helicopter shoot at the

tower and don't shoot the

thing can I take care you before you

shoot too

much

what what song I Ros a helicopter I

should don't know much called was a

helicopter

maybe since that's the

main main thing in the

song me in a pink

helicopter licking sugar getting

hyperactive Isn't it nice when

I emot are working they're probably

still wrong I mean twitch is probably

still sending wrong you they man you

have to fix

it which didn't even respond to my

message I sent them on Twitch

Twitter about twitch on

Twitter

oops but I don't think that was an

important

one

and know

[Music]

ruding but I still have it so let's

continue

off this

area this that that what I don't exactly

need

no

stop

that oh that was

close

well the St two flag so far so I made

some

PR but

yeah didn't need to work myself up

here

for

[Music]

so in

STS p

p well you wouldn't

do p

p always

eats too many sugar I don't think that's

how yeah I think get it whatever is

man

many

H and much is

what I why the camera is

correct

h

I hand

comments

here comes the

Drone I don't exactly remember how it

goes

but

boom I haven't learned the word for much

H it is m

do you know how to spell

m

oh make it that simple

yep just

modified like

ta like thank you

much think thank you very much I

mean

thanks well yeah yeah thank well H is

more like thank you yeah so thank you so

much I'm not really sure what you mean

by modifying

vers but it's still the same in English

just

like I eat too

much that's Val English

right Y

at

burit it works

same that's

simple you're

welcome

what make it a

lot oh that was follow my tank like 2

seconds

yeah

oops it

has it is

gone and you wouldn't say p pun

eats to a lot of suar yeah I mean

yes but you would say one point too much

I'm sh too much but yeah that's because

you

know the meaning

now and I would assume much and make it

our cognet because they are very

similar the CH sound could as well be a

cur

sound

mck but um

yeah but I guess it would be a covering

the a lot meaning as

well well I mean it would be more of h a

lot

of in the case of a lot of sugar they

call

cover everything like

that

one

p8 a lot of sugar

P too much

sug P okay it's

okay okay why why make the sentence

completely different just because you

want to add up too

much I guess you say p eats some eats

much

sugar and I don't know if I mentioned it

on stream as I usually

say I don't know if I mentioned this on

stream but yeah I

usually I shouldn't comment on it so

much but I have several time comment on

commented on the

whole that it should be called Spade not

shovel H but in English you can of use

shovel as a generic term for boats uh in

Swedish H you kind of have the reverse

effect or I don't you call it reverse

but it's the other word the other way

around that's the way I would

explain so the switch word for Spade is

Spa there you might recognize the

similarities

there and the switch word for uh shovel

Isel that one I think is also cognant

it's just harder to not

this is just the F sound and the V

sound are related and the C Sound and

the sh sound are also

related so if you

changel

to uh

shivel it it gets very close to

shov I'm playing it very safe at the

moment anyway

so like in English you can use

shovel as the Casual

term H but you cannot do that in Swedish

however the Swedish word SP which I said

means Spade is the one that people use

as a generic

term

so and there we

go

boom I might want to take care of those

mines

I'm cleaning up a lot at

moment why are people standing in next

to the

tower they went into the tower Mak sense

not sure how do

that

no no wait there is a flag out there how

dare

they well looks like I have a flag to

get my

handsome they really want to do that

like ah you thought you got all of

the destroyed all the flag and was no

flag anywhere H because it's outside

here out of

munition this time there's no M use this

one

[Music]

so I think I should go up there and like

try to shoot it we'll see

if

and pon pon lecking the outside of the

popn

conon

container in English you have the word

carton I think which is a cardboard

container and then you have cardboard

which is the material briish does not

make a distinction between those

two

yeah I kind of reach out

there but what I can do is destroy some

of the

towers I can approach with the

helicopter

instead I

think wa that's a lot of building

Towers oh no I can't reach them oh no

this is going to be

annoying

TR everything at the

moment okay

so there's a to right here

a lot of T

here oh thank you for cleaning up for

me

when that's going to be a bit

annoying cuz I need because I said like

H looks like there

FL there but no there is no there is

there's a FL there oh I should get do

it those turn out

there

uh probably exist to create a no fly

zone I mean

yeah also no deep

down but I'm going up the wrong one

but

I don't this we is too

damaged too many mines

too too many

mines so much destruction at the

moment so yeah I need to go up that one

and hopefully I can go straight

up

p p lies the soup but is so Hur her face

begins to change

colors I mean there is like the one on

dude would also

work it's so hot her face turns red and

she's

shocked she like oh why I didn't expect

it to be that

hot

yeah there we go especially with the

sweat as

well I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm backing

off

I might need to bring in a helicopter

here when a house explodes is

Burns good thing the people got out of

there without getting

burned one PS the soup and then get

hyperactive it's going to to be a long

long stream

today the M don't show up on helicop

camera camera

rad luck they do show up on me

view people

oh went too far

noise hey who shot

me oh is she shaking because she can't

find a drink the cool

it that the next one shaking pon pon

have pon pon watched the film no I

actually

haven't should I play through the FNA

games I did

watch Mark play play through those when

I came out and it looks kind of tedious

hon

no

but I do like the like

um

um did the sign uh

behind uh and I

in that it does not use jump scare as

just a scare thing to make the game

Scary H I mean you could arue game is

scary

but but it's using jump scares as uh

punishment for losing and I think that's

a clever way of doing

it

therefore you would be afraid of losing

because of the jump scare

but the jum SC scary but

know and if you don't pay attention the

jump scare can come out come out of

nowhere basically can I I think that's

very clever game

design taking something that's normally

seen as quite a

cheap form of horror

yeah

and turning into something that's

actually part of the game

thing night Fred

yes I always prefer not staying five

night

day although it's only night because

you're night

guard

so there we go hopefully this isn't the

right

way

I was going to say is there another flag

no it

isn't just see wait why is

it different though no it look like that

right because on the map they are Green

Dots with brown pixels

around uh but maybe on right there they

have dark green around

them

because on the big map you can't see the

dark from Pixel around it but that's

because there's are other things around

the flag building it's going of kind of

a limitation of the map that they're

using to kind of hide them you see

everyone has brown not that one because

they have placed them because those

brown PX are lower priority and are

overridden by by towers and

walls maybe least at least Towers I

don't know about

walls head head type exclamation point

pronoun again is for tell me tell you

what my pronounce are what I prefer be

preferred to

as and then it gives you a l so you can

set your

own so it shows up to the top right

right when you write the

message nope I can't think get the C but

I

can do the things from here at

least oh no not

you and maybe I'm able

to shoot the fly

buing yes I was able to shoot it and no

fly

unit I no

another another flying R

thing there missed it I

one there we

go okay now d starty three flag m

progress see they destroy their own

building nicely

done pop pon pon

ponor burger for pon pon pon Burger

pancakes pon pon

pancakes pineapple pizza for pon pon

Papple

Pizza time to end the flying

thing I think you should send the emotes

separately so they show up and

large it's more fun that

way don't even remember how far I got

with

the before I lost the tank last

time

deep heavy

tank if I continue like this I lose it

yeah okay there's a bit too many mines

here

and I don't know if I said mines or

mines

[Music]

but maybe that was the tank I should

have know but I got one up there so it's

good it's all good I will secure it cuz

this time there's no mines FR it or

something what do we have here we have

pon pon with a dagger pon pon having a

trumpet wrong way

around not sure I didn't flip it and Pon

playing a

saxophone but she's like yeah but I can

blow in it but you know I can't control

it because my PS are too

short

having a drawing F pun playing the

saxophone you know

what that wouldn't work due to how

twitch is built I'm

sorry okay here here's an idea I could

do because as I mentioned there are have

I don't know if I mentioned it uh but on

Twitch

don't ask me why he said like

that they

are and it's not twitch I meant in emoji

there's something

some which is what can say egg call the

egg

glue the Emoji

glue and

uh miss

it

I

guitar

going it's a guy star

okay anyway glue it is technically a

zero with

Joiner you might not

whatever but anyway so to make certain

emojis that don't have their own code

points such as Polar Bear mention before

you take

the uh Emoji for

bear and then you take the emoji for

snow put a zero Sher in

between and then you get a polar bear

obviously normally polar bear would

exist as a SE

emoji on the keyboard but it will output

that sequence for

you I

know I

should

uh

now I should just secure this area

with with the helicopter reming those

mines I don't accidentally run into them

one

day but yeah this means that what I

could do is making custom emojis and

support them in on the on screen chat

they wouldn't show up in the twitch chat

but they would be possible to put in the

on screen chat obviously it wouldn't be

convenient to write

it I didn't need to do that but

um

so we could use a

different kind of symbol to combine

stuff violin

oh what a flute

oh

rabbit a video

camera uh an old school video

cam what should

it right dis like the

mines

that the only one survived

that people

died don't have

them the D

mindes wait how did that one survive

that makes no

sense cuz they do trigger each

other

then there's

[Music]

things no come

on there we go oh no oh

no there okay I'm to Nots

test anymore I should just go home

[Music]

now yeah did not t

my this it looks like I have cleared off

all the

mines when when I get into the tank I

will see on the radar if I miss

any they want P def P bunny Stu for

camera but she's not

listening yes stands

there like yes take pictures of me I'm

so

beautiful there's a mine far to

east that one is not to any

worry oh yeah so deciding for what easy

to access symbol could be used and then

you basically put a sequence St

like an emoji plus feral pon pon and

then there's a custom feral pon pon

using whatever the Emoji was

featuring

okay let's get rid of

these don't like the mines but can't do

much about

that

all end of that one I

guess i' say that was a success with

boming

run

[Music]

yeah F pon pon is just a fair

bunny like don't expect her to do like

non bunny

stuff she just don't understand what you

want if you hand

her I don't know a plate of pancakes she

just going to be

confused

only Le there oh look he's sad someone

has drenched her pancakes with some

gooey stuff and then put

a

another thing on top of everything

ruined her beautiful pancakes she wanted

some Rasberry jam and some whipped cream

instead G stuff yes G

stuff

that means it's more like sticky stuff

than gooey stuff

too stop attacking

me can you stop attacking me

team

I'm pushing it a bit too far

now maybe I should answer with a

helicopter

now H well hey if

it's I wouldn't be surprised if it is

you know cuz it's a

Twitter emoji from United

States

and anyway uh yeah gooey stuff is fair

okay okay I was thinking otherwise it

was

like uh sugar

based

Tre sa

based yeah I prefer jam and whipped

cream on my

pancakes I also prefer my pancake

scer basically what

I guess you might call CPS but they're

still made like the same way so I mean

they still still will fall under the

category of

Pancakes just made

s but that's creps but when I have

creers

creeps I don't know how it would be c c

CPS

CP and but uh

because whatever up

CP I say that like

that is when I try look up recipe that

one is made with by like water instead

of

milk being a bit different in recipe

wise I was supposed to move up with the

helicopter here but as gu I can clear

off more Towers

before

I think some people call like Brits do

call the cineon pancakes as well

and okay enough pushing it I need to get

rid of some mines here that's what I

supposed to

be

e

water who would do that I don't know

that was a recipe I

found using the weekly ones you got some

subscription

yay well obviously got the subscription

to that channel that the emot comes

from I got like

sft like in a short amount of time or

like at this very

moment I me which it

is yeah for M Mage M core and P

enemy I don't know the first one

is mar Mage I think it was with of each

other yeah H well least have to be

within 30 days of each other if we going

use them at same time

but yeah

short

Spa but how many do you have in

total didn't destroy I would prefer to

destroy

that okay can't get better

there and this is what

okay I justy M

now moving

[Music]

back I'm pretending like nothing has

[Music]

happened well everything here

destroyed

boom boom there we go

[Music]

Precision aiming three marrow Mage one

is a doding m

wait I only got three M but I have five

Subs in total

oh

more wait where's the other two H let's

see let me guess one one is pon pon or

is the other one Benny

420

B no is it h wait

wait uh Rocket

Man any Z not three okay that makes more

sense yeah the one I checked

before when he sent sing dancing and

singing I check and Mage yeah roet that

Rocket Man p p Mage core

and I got a few more not too B now they

are gifts like I paid for them un like

you who actually have paid

for which I really appreciate that you

have paying for

the fun fun sub subscription on your

own oh didn't destroyed enough there we

go no die

to

okay this part is

yeah now we

just pushing through this whole thing

here oh one

more here we

go I almost destroyed the tank thing the

thing fuel

tank doesn't matter too much

but okay

whatever whatever oh no I got one shot

left here it goes nothing and it went

nothing

man M holding to

get

this should be a place to ref in here

restock

no no take me than

they

finally can just another one spawning as

well whoa I got two rockets from

that

amazing

[Music]

nervousing so

good I will try to be

good should I I can continue up

there how many Subs like every sub I

have is a subscription except except for

pon

pon I have pon pon which is myself so

that's automa that's of one two three 4

5 6 7 oh only seven give

subet but I

am a bit more active on other streams

too which is also helping me

like get people to come to my

and there are probably people who gives

me sub because I they like they know me

from

streaming so I guess is is exactly

comparable not that much

compe

and there's a flag

building now it's almost shooting the

fing

almost but not

really

know sing

again

no get me out of

here I

went trying to get out of there didn't

go was

planned hey at least I made good

progress I think mine are all random

gifts so they weren't Target yeah I got

random gifts too I I think that's most

of the time I get a

subscription actually I don't know

sometimes I get a

targeted targeted

[Music]

gift

[Music]

[Music]

and of

course oh no now why it's flying so

quickly in a direction I don't want it

to

F there we

go of course and and then

the one get targeted keeps up that I

got the whole

misunderstanding about it which

me which LEDs to me being banned from

that

channel despite the person it was

recording G sub not because I got it but

it was something different I'm misunder

understanding but the person who give

gave me the gift sub

is he's not bothered by the whole thing

like I understand it was a mistake

but I'm still banned from it

Channel really I mean and I still think

the channel owner doesn't know it

but

they

uh they like it when I show up like um

other

streams but I don't share like I don't

watch many streams that they watch so

rarely see them

but so it it would be fun to like when

I'm like a big

streamer yeah I'm still B I'm still BN

from your

channel and I have no means of

contacting them and the mod of that

channel does not want to unun me so

there's

that

I was and then I mentioned that I was

previously banned on another Channel

which was uh due to me

mentioning

um destroy

this I didn't me my own age they had

that channel has rule against mentioning

your age there's a few channels I have

that guess fine I I don't mention my age

anyway H but I did mention uh

the age

restrictions and then

they uh and then I got banned from a by

a mod because they consider me to be

unreached and I I had no proof of being

not but I got

unbanned I don't know if it makes it

more fun that it's uh Pro trans

stream there's a lot of like LBT Plus

safe spaces and like that and that's

that's common but it's R to at least for

me to find like a

strongly I don't think that person is

trans but but a person who is strongly

proor Banning having a banned a trans

person

for being having an ambiguous age like

everyone else has there so don't me age

but

if like oh so

weird and also wait you got banned for

something you didn't well I did do

something that I shouldn't have

done I do think a permanent ban is a bit

too

har especially since the reaction about

the mod afterwards were like yeah I

guess I guess it wasn't that harmful or

something like but yeah we're not going

to

B the streamer is nice

though and none of them is going to hear

this anyway so actually actually the

streamer in question that I'm banned

from has actually been on at least one

of my

streams which Mak the te better and I

don't know it was before or after I was

banned if it was after I was banned

actually don't think I don't think you

can like go and chat on a on a new on a

stream you you Bann on a user you Bann I

mean that wouldn't you probably get a

message like you ban is user you can no

longer chat on this so it must have been

before I got banned but that doesn't

make sense that actually doesn't make

sense because

comes the Drone it comes the

Drone that's one of

them because I think I was banned on the

very firstam I watched

them that now it was

easy and I don't think they had a reason

to show up on my stream if I didn't

wasn't on their stream and and I think I

made a good impression of them on them

because they likeed see me oh

well but I can't send them a message H

because you know being banned on on

Twitch I cannot send them a message on H

Discord because I'm banned from that

Discord

server

um this is very hard for for

uh

they they very they're very hard on

their bands H

for so

here I should probably send a friend

request on Discord to that streamer I

just need to figure out what

the username is but I could probably ask

a person who knows knows I I had I know

a person who knows that person who I

asked if they could help me like tell

them

like going on and that when I told that

person I got banned that person was

really surprised because to even get

banned according to the person I

know

uh H you must be doing something really

bad cuz they they don't ban people that

easily

which makes it even

funny what do you do to get ban on so

many channels I have only got well I

could be ban on more channels you don't

get a message about it to be fair but

it's only two channels I know I got

better what I said the first one I told

that I was talking about uh age

restriction in Sweden and they consider

the mod consider that meaning that I

a which clearly I can't know about don't

hate if I'm not under AG or something I

don't

know another another one but I guess I

could it's okay it was

like H the streamer said I can tell the

story so you know the situation the

streamer said that uh like oh no

like don't go wasting your money and

give things SS or like things sub it's

something like that it's okay you don't

need to do that and then and then

someone gave me one of the targeted

Cs and I was like oh no don't do

that and then person and the person

gifting was like yeah but if you don't

want gifts you can disable being able to

be gifted which is a function in twitch

H ads no you not get everyone not

having ads now don't get the

story H

sorry if I'm ignoring the kbx the game

master what was your name again

kbx calling KB

[Music]

I should have

wa up sling this oh

nice but that didn't get me

banned I did

say and that and of thing I regret

saying was that I am going to

about

it I shouldn't have said

that I meant it as a

joke but clearly didn't get across

however after that incident I did uh go

to the person who gifted me the sub to

went to one of their streams and just I

was s that I was sorry for what I did

and

[Music]

the and they were did fine with

everything they they didn't care about

it

like and uh

then I had a good time over there on

their Stream So anyways uh yeah it's kbx

do have ADD at the moment H other if so

I wait reading your messages I mean

obviously you cannot answer it's more

like if you answer I can R myess now if

not I will wait until

answer I knew I heard it from somewhere

The Voice playing in my head wait

what what are we talking about

now oh this is

not I sorry you confusing at the

moment going to have to go back in the

chat have to go back in the chat that

for that one yeah I was asking if I had

if you had ads but yes I can go back to

in the chat to your

messages I assume the oops I'm supposed

to go here I assume your ads are

over so uh oops you have to put the CD

in your PS1 what do you mean

now

I'm sorry I I don't get what you what

you're saying about

that hope this stream is fine as far as

I've seen this

fine I know start the wrong thing

here oh no no I didn't that that was

easy

no oh no Shields

down no

no don't want to miss with you

now get me to

here okay I'm in a bad spot at the

moment okay got rid of

one have the other one following me

stop

me good now I'm

safe okay I'm very close to getting

those two FL at least one

fling so anyway let's go back to the

chant that was a very stressful

situation H go yes h i was referencing

Lego

Island but in the actual code he

says H uh your

PC instead of

PS1 but I said PS1 since you're playing

a PS1 okay I'm Lego Island I know that's

a game I never played it I did not get

the

reference but thanks for

trying

okay so I'm very close to those two flag

bus I remember our first computer

couldn't handle Mega Island I did like

one frame second voice skips with repeat

while loaded the

next it was like ex

after time and so I was supp to spent

hours playing well well

yeah good

time it was probably terly optimized as

well that was a tricky part of

optimizing

games PCS I mean it's still a bit of

trick part optimize

games but games do run quite well on

computer

they have found a lot of solutions to

make games run

well so now

[Music]

to destroy this tree that I we need

more okay

destroy that

one and move on move out move out move

out

quickly this is it's quick

enough don't get

stuck okay mission

complete of one of two buildings I do

have destroyed order building as

well but

perhaps I should use the helicopter for

that

this what about roll

out

well

then so

yeah that was my story about how I got

banned from my chan which I'm still ban

at not talking not taking No gra from

flying today yeah for some Reas

better yeah but today mean this round

because the previous one I kind of

failed do F things I mean I still lost

the big tank to one of them after taking

heav damage from

other okay let's see I mean yeah this

just a single line of towers I should be

able to do it because I destroyed so

much with the

tank wait a

minute I didn't mean to

shoot go go go go it's just one thing

more I should take yeah contr I was

think yeah I can just fly up there and

attack it no there is too many

Towers there's still too while there's

few Towers but like there's way too much

towers like sou of it

so still not an option to take the

helicopter

so I will still use the tank and I will

attack

that skip the helicop

you well in that case be right back oh

okay don't care about the tank I get it

tank

sucks they

destroy it there we go got

destroyed don't TR Havey

second

not

mine not mine mine

though I building

destroyed there we go so now that means

I'm done up

here and I need to do

here comes the

Drone okay I've done that too many times

today

[Music]

actually I don't know if

uh I can see I'm trying to think of when

I was

banned H twitch does tell me when I sent

the because if you get banned you

allowed to send one request of getting

unbanned which I think is

fair and because you only left stand one

you really have to make sure your

message is

proper would be nice if you you

know if you could send like I I don't

think it's a perfect system because you

should rather be allowed to when you get

banned you should be allowed to send one

message if the mod gives you a reply to

that message then you should be allowed

to I don't think mod can reply to it

which is a problem yeah but a mod can

send you a private message

though which I don't think they should

have to anyway and when and mod should

instead be allowed to reply to the meion

and when they do make a reply you should

be allowed to do one replay back you

cannot spam something like that and uh

and

then if the mod have had enough of you

they can just not reply to you in that

that as a mod you should not reply stop

replying to us because then you haven't

replied and letting the ti game um

so this is a PR I've seen like people

like a person like stop replying to me

they

say yeah it's just CU they have like a

see see like like

online comments you have two people like

messing back and forth and then one

person just random say stop and stop

replying to

me if you

just stop replying to that person maybe

they will get st stop replying to you

yeah

whoops I should not have done that

should not have done

that another

one

for

what there we

go for what reason was another one oh

hello you're

[Music]

back

there we go I still have a lot ofs left

yes I

am you are back and you have a back made

that joke many times

too and yes I

do thank you for confirming that that

was unsure cuz it's not like I've seen

your back

so so I need to be

more there's a FL building here is

destroying even though it's not a

northest flag building at the

moment

[Music]

the helicopter destroying these mines

got too many of

them oh there we

go to is

everywhere okay there's a fewel

no don't let don't don't do this to

me

I leave I

leave and also if I check the radar of

this tank they do have

brown edges on that on the FL building

there was something weird with that

other flag

building which did not have brown pixels

on

it he yiran welcome I you stream for a

while hello pony the

bunny nice to see you Hi how are

you I'm doing well

yourself yeah I'm I'm also doing well I

have been able to be productive as

well with everything I have to take care

of the

house I'm happy about

that I got a hang

over where it sounds like you probably

had a good time before that hang

overing must have been a good time last

night y exactly my

thoughts I want it was

oh special

occasion oh is the

nice middle of the week party

that's em what kind of drink yeah that's

a now now we need to ask you all the

questions I can of drink what was

thecas

when I destroying these

mines oh oh

no yay out of

here just clean up a bit

here making a bit easier for than gets

through I don't see the harm in doing

that

okay out of munition I guess that's a

sign for me to go

home so let's see h n I just had darts

as all but I drink cor nor ni so like

just uh get together with

friends those she a type of me I should

drink Kinder I have no I'm not I don't

drink myself I I don't know not know

am familiar

with but thank you for stopping by

here spending your time with pon pon the

bon bon

or

Pony the pony

Bon I'm no

pony or

Pony I'm a

bun and uh and at this moment I do not

have a made outfit but I will have that

in the future

but I guess putting pon pon in a m Das

it isn't going to be the same the same

as putting a hero in a made

outf I have a feeling that there's a

slight

difference I'm destroying everything

here this

Stu

yeah there are some fls in

here

nice already destroy

well starting to run after

bullets going actually taking quite some

damage

so I think sounds like a good idea to go

back uh let's see what you're talking

about

now sh

Shina I haven't heard of it oh Shina B

yeah yeah I should write the whole thing

I I miss that part

and uh but I don't have e either

I right now

trombone wait I would a sad

from no I

think H but what guy have yeah I mean

Alive anyway yeah go go go yeah I think

I did that

one I mean I destroyed a few Towers it

didn't like didn't make much progress in

that run

uh I probably should look at the map

again and just see where I should go

I kind of lost track of where I'm

supposed to

go and it would be nice to be done with

this I've been streaming for quite a

while at the moment so I usually stream

for 3 hours I'm going for four 4 hours

and like

minutes okay I am I'm I'm soon getting

those two the flag buildings

destroyed and that's going to be a good

time cuz I don't have many flag

buildings left to

destroy an insect came and annoying

distracted me so I

was

hello just po say I hope you have a

great

stream oh yeah you hope that sorry

remember droing comment you hope that I

have a great stream from now even been

streaming for like 4 hours but anyway no

on but I've been on for 4

hours I'm just messing with you uh but

thank you for pupp really means notot to

had must been a good

nap very nice

KN yeah you should probably have that

had had that for when I guess it was

yesterday but there was a

lot need to

exix was a fun

time you have a lot of great people that

you

know

build up oh no I'm dead I'm

dead okay I'm not dead but I was almost

dead I'm going to be dead if I get stuck

at

everything oh no don't shoot

me don't shoot

me I'm like dead after one hit or

something can I stop getting stuck in

everything I'm so just trying to get

around

here

I a SLE that on yet wait yet for what

what I mean I assume you slept last time

you were

sleeping I mean yes it's not the time

amount

to I'm criticizing your message it's so

weird everything wants to hug the

peaceful tank I mean everyone wants to

hug a peaceful

P

right especially if you change pon pon

outfit someone haven't redeemed an

outfit in a long time that's what I'm

trying to

say would you rather hug Pon pom wearing

a sports sports we or the swim

seit

that's a good question

right spy oh so

can hug her bunny

tummy I guess find

swimsuit the uh kind of material is

usually made of isn't like as kind

as the sports

of I guess the dress would actually be a

better

option play fluffy bunny

back back wait how are

you I guess there's a bit of

[Music]

back

okay I need to destroy this uh one

more and

then

yes pushing a bit more

forward to the last

one oh no

okay there we go oh no now they're

coming they are coming for

me okay time to go home I'm better damag

than

moment I'm almost at the flag next flag

building so one run and I should be able

to get

the get to

it hopefully just one more run and then

I have this three flag buildings in the

middle in the

middle and hopefully the flag just

doesn't spawn there I'm about to

actually succeed this

time had a failed run last

time I wasn't happy about

it

[Music]

but that and uh the problem with having

a fail run is that you take so long time

playing s Maps like this one so failing

it after you made good progress is um

not

fun yeah I have like so close I'm so

close wonder if I should bring in the

helicopter destroy the mines or if I

just

should go with the tank I think I made a

decision y just take it slow careful got

to

be close to to two hours oh yeah you

want me to take it so slow that you'll

be the

winner you be the

winner I know what it sound

like I think it's close to 2 hours

already have you uh predicted the

longest

time cuz in that case you you will win

as soon as this enters

your uh your

Zone not specifically the the hour

option but the longest of the on that

are it I hope

that's about

that now stop it

wait where's the

FL wait I'm already taking so much

damage oh no I'm messing up I'm messing

up oh no I need to destroy this I it

will destroy

me

W taking so much damage already okay I

did not do it this

run maybe I should just enter with the

helicopter

anyway in a pink

helicopter I flying home to you in a

pink helicopter I don't remember l and L

also in Swedish

so was around 1830 when you restarted

the map I did restart like four

times but yeah my vote is the highest

time at 2 hours well then long as it's

within 7

minutes and 30 seconds was it like that

cuz there's like steps of five 15 minut

s yeah let's send with helicop

helicopter let's go let's go oh it's

glitching a bit I don't know why it's

glitching on this

map Brown not

pink go go go go go

go

go p

helicop

p helicop

[Music]

p Arabic when I can't

[Music]

that

I did

it I

succeeded in my

helicop

[Music]

mission don't destroy the their ts

because that's

my

success it says Brown

okay if you if you put the IPA I can

pronounce it

too I think you said it was said

something like another

[Music]

word you should be able to find the IPA

for that on wi

name there's a lot

of FL being left actually

that's s for

dripping well not dripping that's what

the drop r is more like you call that I

don't know what English word is when you

have a like a

water flowing I guess

flow that was

weird why did the shadow become bigger

when

the became

smaller

let me through okay whatever

whatever being like

[Music]

[Music]

that I think the helicopter run was

actually pretty successful there maybe I

should do another one

[Music]

no one WR in comments

anymore very am i m

it yeah I should be able to get like the

other

ones they barely any Tower mostly a lump

of towers in the middle there but they

fling are on the

side sorry do

it this one I should just do like

this oh shot next oh wait it might not

even be that building where's this

building here there we go that was the

building

oh

[Music]

well I have suffered a lot of damage

need to the

[Music]

Bas then I'll go for the other ones on

other

side

[Music]

ah okay Miss SP it's actually that bo

[Music]

bo that was what

was I'm

[Music]

guess it's not applicable to

me I am a

white the

[Music]

bunny

oh okay there's actually quite a few hey

what okay it wasn't

late lag has been

found

jeep jeep time Jeep

time anyway I was going to say I am a

white babit in Spanish your

soy wa

yes

yesan there we go I was I was trying to

remember what bunny
