game so I have the stuff

[Applause]

required I'm I'm just doing it for

though my ears are very

sensitive let's make one and see how it

looks yeah who's who's drawing a panda

with fny

ears I think you could find one on the

internet some kind of Panda bunny

hybrid Bone Yard this is going to be

tricky

but I did get to do the force World last

time I did

this

so I'm pretty happy with

that it was now defeated cortex

but

close who that was about to be a

mistake let me to

so I bet it there we go that's the

second

mask

now I just need to keep it so I can get

a

thir I Tred to do Crush one without

dying at least Crush one has more mod

making it easier that way but Crush one

is a hard

game because I exact same mistake

multiple

times

the exact same mistake not a piece of M

right

nope Who

who okay let's go jump over

there jump over

here

no he didn't work down if it

crash that was a

warmup the

real

oh you can't you can't quit you have to

actually press you actually have to

press

quit pon pon I'm your biggest

fan oh hello biggest fan and want the

hugs and the

kisses and the

letes if

you're I I assume you want to should I I

mean I don't have to do them in the

morning unless unless that was the thing

I said

before I might

have so you would be in support of a p p

plushy that you can hug and kiss and rub

your face

on

any initial initial CL would probably be

something like baral Pon

P before the

[Music]

real doing a Kickstarter

[Music]

fory

so we this one

up oh yeah then I should probably do the

water level because then I can get

another mask

there oh it's golden now and animated

yeah come

now

hurry hurry

[Music]

hurry well green crates green boxes we

have to wash off for

them and then I have to fall down

before have to actually fall

down

and then I go to the water

level maybe I should do

the this gives me a chance for am wait

there's M here yes that means I don't

have to bother about

the oh that actually killed him shark

that must been on the last frame or

something

okay this one I missed last

time and then there's this

thing and the fish

thing

and then shoot everything that moves and

doesn't

move everything that moves and don't

move CH stuff that doesn't

move

no

weird

Graphics I do know that you can take a

shortcut okay let it get down there then

going around

it and then shoot

everything

[Applause]

oh I mean you can't get a Third Mask

anyway but I wanted the Third Mask

anyway you can't you can't have three

masks on one if I had picked that up

is that not

allowed you're chewing on a

bone yeah was not bad it's a bone

apparently bone or specifically chew on

Bones it's very

naughty how D you she want B

inv they hate when I Che on the bone yes

definit for some

reason can pop

through

like

me it's beenin running

[Music]

time I just need to reach

exit doesn't matter what I

get that

[Applause]

point

I think this was not the optimal way of

doing it but it

[Music]

worked and that's what's

important and

go they hi the bone

chewing

[Music]

the third level and then I only got the

first level left to do I'm do I'm doing

invisible then it does not then then the

light does not see

you

[Music]

the light can see me

now okay here we

go there we

go reaching the of level no mistakes now

please

wh I

got

well okay was

fine tomb

time now when this level is

done midnight round

run and then it's only the

motorcycle

left the banner says great w in

Chinese

[Music]

but it

does it doesn't say in Chinese

though but it's written in

Chinese

good okay

let

that

they have

some oops to oh that was

close could to nervous

there jumped a little

early and now they're

doing weird shapes

here no I touched the tail of it oh what

a waste of a

mask

what a

waste well I only took damage once so

it's okay I really want zero times

but I got a head out now have get

stream thank you for stopping by Red for

such a late stream

even though I can't I don't remember

which time you're working should

remember but too many people to

[Music]

remember hog

ride

so can I do this I think this one is the

easier

one or got a

star look I'm playing

Spyro I was playing Spyro I Tred no

damage run

Spyro couldn't complete the first world

before I take

damage I didn't G it multile Tri

there

no at least I

tried yeah just scraping the side of the

car with his legs like

that

oh

[Applause]

wa

Crystal

and

Crystal that's that's

the well time for the boss no mistakes

this time did I take a damage from this

boss last

time I do not remember if I

need

but I hope I I hope I don't do it this

time maybe I

did no I was I was definitely close

once I think this is

enough nothing left

almost I tried to do down

everything and when you do a new set of

these

appears so much but having a funny Dr or

something I don't

[Music]

know

no see I have to remove more of him

yeah this kind of sliding does not make

[Music]

sense sneaky

go go p

p you thrashed me mateing no worries but

you'll soon be up against much

worse like

what when I have like last time someone

don't remember who said that entropy

could be

trouble

whoops that

wasn't meant to

happen

wait why didn't they get removed

from why did they get removed from the

on screen

chat covered by P

anyway you're supposed to get

your yeah but today acly yeah because

there's no

confirmation

when I press wrong button to

skip that's why you didn't

skip

okay come

on that you didn't oh I stood on the box

kind

of magic magic

Bing

okay Sly I've um lost my mask

really yeah I mean it happened it wasn't

obviously obviously it wasn't

intentional but you you're still here

and everything so it's like no harm

done who I stepped on the edge

day okay I need to be careful

here oh there we

go not anymore

nah I did the unban him as soon as I as

quickly as I

could

what's with the bouncy boxes anyway it's

not like they can expect you to stand

there and bounce on them while while

that thing is chasing

you so I mean yeah when if you're banned

and twitch doesn't allow you to write

any there's a message set saying that

you're

Bann

oh I don't know what

never deep tremble it's not too tremble

if you don't go for red

gem it's when you go for the red gem

that

it's eight

something I now I completed the LEL

without dying but game should consider

that I've took damage

B way

Mas come some maskless run and basically

no heat

run

oh d go that's start taking care

of where is this level of

these run run run run run can't really

run under the water

but what no it was

here like the next one I

think

oh no come on I wasn't even touching the

fish game is cheating I will game

away any I'm trying too hard of a

challenge at the

moment is a pass run possible excluding

B zies should I do that

instead let's switch over part because I

fail this CH like two times today

and yeah let's let's R some ads while I

set things

up like 5 minutes until add

anyway uh

paf run

pacifist

um why does it say part I forgot to

change the

game I saw that change the

game uh I'm pretty sure I pressed the

game and pressed update and it said that

it does update and then it like switch

by to expire or something I don't know

what

happened Uka Uka is

free wor it cannot be evil great evil oh

yeah so so what's what's like the

pacifist run

so but you cortex you have fa not

destroying a single

enemy but I'm allowed to destroy boxes

right Bic from deep inside my it said

crash when I got here yeah

and but maybe it was about set the crash

anyway it was just for some

reason my patience there is now no other

power boxes yes I'm allowed to destroy

boxes I'm allowed to destroy boxes we've

had a few

unfortunate but

like failed but since you're bumbling TR

to think and need to need to make the

rules

here to

ens yeah the SS are down I can clear

those off the least this is why every

want this to be automatic will make sure

that you do it right after many so now

they will be for 30 minutes has been

freed from his underground prison well I

need to go to work now okay there to

protect Millennium Miss malice now oh my

famous trash B good game hello

PE guess the ass are over for some

people then so yeah let's um byy

Aran thank you for stopping

bye so PR run

then can I do it without killing a

single enemy but that's

yeah but what like like bombs

like like objects

that are out to kill

me H but aren't actually

[Music]

enemies

like like this this is a goat obviously

I can't kill the goat because it's a

living

being living

[Music]

being oh look I can use checkpoints

[Music]

now the frog has to leave

the guy's bringing the sword for some

weird reason get to

live I mean I could do the bonus

but waste of

time now if I'm taking all boxes maybe I

should go back and do

the the bonus come out

Cas come here

CR

was he has 30 back that I thought it

would

[Music]

be

okay pretty short a simple

bonus

Bess be right back

you can call me

b okay now start time I walk past this

Cod

okay here from me

[Music]

soon

pey

lucky want to say like K Ley or

something

[Music]

whoop do more no I missed some

[Applause]

boxes then it was no for me to I must

boxes looking back at the Bo and seeing

which boxes I

missed this is just going

at the start it's not going to be much

different what happens if I run into an

enemy and take damage do I have to

self-destruct to reset it back to before

meaning that I don't need

masks sharet leave I let bomb leave too

I'm I am that peaceful so that bombs

leave as

well

okay can I ignore some boxes

already

okay let me

[Applause]

through

don't okay I'm not sure if you can

okay now I want e of

me okay I want to see if I can get past

that get past that shark

and now I don't have any mask so now I

can go maybe I can get a second

checkpoint

here so I

aha you

can yeah yeah for proper paist run I

should probably not use masks

because that

wouldn't that would be cheating that

would be

killing single FR h

okay this one is not helping me

much I mean I can shoot stuff that

aren't are his

boxes be kind to the

boxes that a

challenge

well no me it's just a

bomb not a living organism it doesn't

count I I I I don't count

it

oan is not here he can't say

anything I say bums Stone count

ni Kitty

cor

hello ignore that one

though

welcome I hope you have a good

day okay me turning around to avoid the

shark made me go into the shark

nicely

done yeah I don't I'm not sure if I can

get past that shark

without killing

it or does that one make a sound without

actually attacking I think it makes a

sound to alert a player that is

there oops how is the K this B girl oh

have I been classified as a cutest SP

again you know

I'm just thinking but because you might

perhaps I don't know know another bunny

girl and

um and no I didn't want this okay I said

I could destroy bombs

so so I will destroy that

bomb I always hate those

shots they are they aren't too hard to

deal with I guess but um if if my goal

is to not kill

anything they

sure yeah they they they do follow you

very quickly there but they are very

quick so I can

definitely they they have been annoying

me for in some some sometimes so

I as you turn around he moves towards

can't I get another checkpoint at this

point

so yeah it's as you're moving

towards

ni towards the side I guess and then the

shark is moving towards you it can

appear on screen very

quickly that yeah I can see yeah that

that's actually

annoying you can get a very short time

to

react okay

Swing Swing Swing Swing Swing Swing

Swing Swing no

no and then then his fish just swims

away like it's

nothing okay I'm messing up I'm messing

up everything at the moment

this is the second level in the game by

the

way doing a sort of pacifist run off the

game

is someone challenged me to do it

someone I know and who was in the chat

and then had to go which makes it better

because challenge me to do something and

then just

leave

does not elaborate

further no why why did it just being

pushed to to the side like that what why

did that

happen everything in this level is

annoying I'll take it back everything is

annoying no far the shark is probably

the least annoying part

though no I just do something with crash

controls under water

like could it could they could could

have been fine but I think they messed

up the

controls okay no more extra lives this

is

it

I mean a game over is in the end of the

run

but I mean some ways you

could they it is

but that case I would have picked up

more of the

boxes okay where are you

shark

okay

go

oh get is

here swing s

Swing Swing Swing s s s s swing s

yes I did

it with no extra lives left I did

it I managed I managed to do it under

pressure I was under some pressure

there okay this one I'm completely

without without killing a single

enemy just going to pick up some boas

and Ries

to get

some extra

lives like

that to make the

L I don't know if they put extra extra

lives if you have died a

[Music]

lot wait what was that

quiet why didn't I

hear why why didn't I hear that one

is just some random extra

stream

but thank welcome thank youy it's I

would play as C in every level if I if I

were allowed

to I believe in you so the the goal here

is to uh not kill any enemies so thank

you for being me someone challenged me

to complete this without

killing and I'm

currently and doing the level is in

order so it's three levels without

killing anything and swim water level

was the most annoying

what want to pick up some foods but oh

that was

a that was a Dan that was a

m sorry about that bird I I didn't mean

to to b m you like

that talking about how I should hard and

then I just murdered the bir didn't

happen I just went back

carrot and what's a golden carrot aside

from a carrot in

Gold take but you got this I I'll I'll

I'm doing well so

see oh no I'm missing

too there two% of an

[Music]

external why don't you need the foods

behind just pick them

red gem the other one has the yellow gem

get the box box

gem

the other one you

don't yeah so this was the one you don't

need the Jem to get the box

gem well I forgot to switch

gem on to the last one I think this one

I usually don't I mean you can't really

kill enemies in this

level man I miss the G these games and

give the G is going to give me

something

maybe maybe that's

something maybe you should try I'd love

to watch you play some trash and

possibly also spal p One

games that would be

fun

W whoops no one died so it's okay but I

did miss a

box as long as no no one dies it's

fine

the the The Cannonball didn't even get

destroyed I expected that to happen the

bird did not die the bird just flew

away the bird was disappointed about the

Box through

here

and

H but then I I need

the simulator

emulator and that sounds like a lot of

work and brain power when I could always

[Music]

have it's it requires something GRE

but

didn't be too

h

no

[Music]

swim for all

purposes I do own that PlayStation one

so

and the game I have the dis in a

is next

level oh the outfit redeems are

over that mean that pon pon is back in a

pink

dress I could do a pass run of Spyro as

living

organisms this Lev you Cann walk

here not you want allow

that what they

do you to grab your upgrade or C what

like destroying

[Music]

them that's no no a

frog 20

cards if that makes sense does that make

sense as an exp

[Music]

explanation piz spr that if your H is

made out of

pizza I'd like to see

it if this block if this box didn't

exist or if it could be activated by

this you could complete this by not

activating Both exclamation mark

boxes

more grease

for never mind stuff you like you like

it

greasy what if you had a greasy Pizza in

Dem give me this snake haven't killed

someone have

I can I can I sometimes can I forget

that I'm not supposed to kill anyone

you

know you're like you kind of kind of

forget that's a thing you don't want to

forget that you're not supposed to kill

someone

but be so annoying when it

happens oh I don't like any one of

them I have a snake

oh how about a coincidence

I want a bow a big snaky oh he want like

a huge snake so what's the name of this

[Music]

snake he snakey

boy

okay this time I can I don't have any

annoying minions deal with

she a b Pyon name

whisper are you listening to whisper

whisper can

I oh you can't can

out know can canot do something

like okay I actually

done oh

wait yeah it's like

that something like

that

do whisper beat

box beat boxing

snake thank you oh no I'm stuck okay I

got

that maybe she can be I've never

asked yeah that's

fair it's not really something you would

ask a

snake

whoops I didn't expect

that outr them crash oh he need outr

them nicely

done

no well that was

close

ah well it sounds like you need to ask

her snake who

we well

well and when you do you need to need to

show that on camera in case she starts

Beast boxing you

know

whoop my three wishes are a root bear

seller second be a billionaire but wait

how

is it is it like an evil genius that

technically gives you what you want but

it backfires because it's it's

technically true but but the genie tries

to screw you

over and finally free the genie from the

lamb might worries but you'll soon be up

against much worse because

because imagine getting like being a

billionaire

in Iranian real or how much is

that so

um I'll be sure to ask when she's not

sleeping so far so good

Dynamite n b like being rich and I'll

buy anything you want

sweet well

um

well it would be nice having a lot of

money to just

spend W look at

that wait did I kill something

already boom okay there H

[Music]

gone I supposed to get past this oh that

was

fine it's fine gu didn't

die so far so

good okay I'm not I'm going to let the

egg be because otherwise I risk killing

the thing inside

it oh

no

speaking of

killing oh yeah I see I assume you meant

being

rich

but but

like you know me I like to joke about

things so

like you become a billionaire bit but

you don't become rich because you have a

billion in a

currency that's not worth a lot of

money and then you have to exchange

it

yeah H

the yeah that's why that's exactly why I

want to make the p I'm plusy so everyone

can get to hug their own p p as much as

they

[Music]

want and then there's the bone B wait

this is it no this is the yellow gem I

can't get I can't get the box gem

anyway okay not killing

birds bird killing is not allowed in

this game in this round in this

challenge this part is not made for like

double jumping you can use double jump

but it's like single jumps are fine

love

you I'm happy having such a good time

here okay so I'm going to do this and

this probably will take me a few tries

so because ads are going to play anyway

those who ask let's me let's gets to see

see me do this faing it over and over

other if you have like an or if you have

a CBO or if

you you feel like pay

for but it's fine

um see you in 3

minutes this is when I beat it the first

time

yeah because if I'm going to take the

let me let me focus on the boxes

then that take me 3 minutes

to and then I do like the

real

nice can I getting some

whoo getting some practice

now and I would say that you're not

drong so when I do the real the real

attempt of getting first it wouldn't be

like a first

attemp

and there we

go that's all those

boxes I'm going to keep up with this

car rather not drive past the

car

wait okay I'm driving plast the

car wait it's not I'm confusing

levels I am I'm confusing this level

with another

[Music]

level hey getting the 25 boxes wasn't

that

[Music]

hard

up and the ad should be over now so I

didn't I didn't

[Music]

win should be like 30

seconds let's see crash

down

who such a weird dance

oh I just realized that

thing just for because I always have the

a mod here handling

the oh yeah yeah it did

the it it did the shout out sing but it

didn't do this shout out s I'll do this

shout out

thingi it's wor it's wor watching

Zi okay time to do this track then I

haven't won this

yet so everyone who has ads didn't miss

anything other than me getting the Box G

but I guess you can look back oh no that

wasn't a good

start let me start

over is PE clet R I'm having a good time

with you I'm glad you

do and I do wish everyone have good

time there we go that's a good

start wa such a different SC

Stu

I don't know if it's quick to go on the

inside like

this but I can use the UNL stick get a

bit smoo

turning

come

on using anal stick on Place control the

most

celling does have some acceleration

which is the case for the stick t

come on get out of the way I'm trying to

win this

race oh that was

close can't to see I'm trying to win oh

you're trying to win too oh

well he

that CU I'm the one only out to

me cuz I'm a bunny get a bunny no you're

winning how dare

you so

close

[Music]

go let's put

some fun fun shars

okay that that was just a warmup now

it's for

real no I've been going for 3

hours and it's closing in on

midnight watch as the clock reaches

midnight that's when it switched over to

a bunch of

zeros I Le an under stream P midnight

once as

well

isn't it exciting to see

this to see it goes from 2359

to

Z was that five SER four I could have

seconds but I don't think that's

necessary

today I guess it would help to see the

stream

delay not quick second

no missed the whole

ramp and then I fell down the

hole hips kind going to pay for that

sign

okay I'm going to sneak around

here oh no I'm not going to win this

time for some reason for some reason I

have such trouble winning this

race I think it's

easier we make but which I might have

called reignited

before might

have but some for some reason this one

the other the third one I don't think I

struggle

with but this one I don't know what it

is it's something this one that I

stragon

with

well I didn't mean to bump the

ramp how is

see

no

Jude is not going to that one at the

moment don't the bumping that

happens getting

bumped all over the

place oh oh wait kind that second place

thing

oh oh that was close to

getting off the track which would make a

force reset onto the track

again get out of the

way it looks like I'm going to win his

time there we go

this must be a win would be weird if I

didn't win now and soon pass me

there and that was like three attempts

or

something for some reason I struggle on

that

one skill issue

[Music]

certainly well back

to this

one back to not killing

enemies so

so try toit

that like like it's

friendch

are you watching

[Music]

moreen

[Music]

okay one of these have a gen about

it oh no not one I think these levels

are not more no these levels are not

more annoy than underwater

levels

[Applause]

sping on that where is the other

underwat

level wait how am I supposed to get past

here yeah I don't think I can get past

this this enemy I think that enemy has

to

die yeah I Le i t outside or something

yeah you have to kill that

enemy oh wait what happened he

just his grip on

it like a

fool there you

go

yeah since since it doesn't even reach

the platform this is another enemy I

have to

kill

can I

get this one can be a bit

tricky to move so

quickly I don't think I

[Music]

can now I should be to do this I just

need to there we

go tricky but not too tricky for pon

pon I think I can get

the I think I can get the gem on this

one I could be wrong

there I mean I could try to% the

[Music]

game

there

go no it's the most optimal collection

of but it

worked

[Music]

another one of

these run run

run get in here without dying that's get

challeng yeah I don't think I will do

like at full 100% sh of this game that

would take too much

effort

too much efforts for

me least these are easier to deal

[Music]

like oh yeah here's the one there play

one flying

M what a genie about

it I yeah there you

go can

I

no oh I can't do this without killing

the

[Music]

monkey

[Music]

and then I killed the uh s

man

what there

you that jumped away from an

explosion

so I have to activate this when it monke

is away from

it no what and the animation is cut out

there that was

weird now come

on I didn't mean to jump on jump on the

silly

guy does he store those in

his poofy Tres I don't even know

what those things are called there

probably

some fancy

term oh

no

yep

wait the monkey doesn't even move to the

sides that was easy to get

around this one shouldn't be too hard to

get yeah just oh the bo

who two enemies that have to die

May their souls rest in

peace we

[Music]

will

remember yeah it's a deep

[Music]

trouble Under Pressure put me under

pressure deep trouble is going to give

me some deep

trouble

will I go for the Box gem no because

that would require me to go for

the go for the purple gem as

well and I don't feel like 100% in this

wait there's shark here how am I

supposed to get past this

shark yeah I don't think you can get

past this

truck

I think this is another level where I

have

to no I did it

the shark did not have to be

sacrificed oh no another place with

shark like

this um how I supposed to get past this

track

then oh like that okay

okay that was a difficult shark to get

around speaking of annoying

sharks that was probably the least

annoying

shark oh

oh TR I because I

there H yeah another easy

shark sharks come

[Music]

easy there's one

here okay there is

like a vehle

here problem with using

it is that I don't know what enemies I'm

killing with

it

I wanted you to S up I want go

up I mean I

can use this I

guess I just might have to make sure I

don't kill an any or

something k p this sharks

here

it's going to be

tricky so maybe I shouldn't bring that

with

me it's a bit heavy and

slow just single airing

this no no I was so close so

close so close as getting

pause

might okay that was too late I need to

move up

but not so

uh I just need to do I we need to move

up late but not too

late that was too late oh that was too

early when I moved up into the shark

above so I need to move up a bit later I

wonder how prise

then someone could do like a heat heat

box analysis or

something

can I get

like another checkpoint here or

something when it's not far ahead but

same some

time no that was too late that felt that

felt that I had

it

I think that's the last major obstacle I

have to get past and then I will

complete

[Music]

11

no why did you turn so

early can I go above the two sharks not

even interact with

them

like like go under him I some

sharks oh yeah I could just go over the

shark well that was

easy why make it more complicated than

than it

is

okay oh no I got a mask I don't want

that okay

so but the upper Shar though move up

which means it have to

be

no

no okay so I need to why did I make it

so

easy yeah like that

easy well I guess no enemies died so

it's fine

no no

you're

no why are you doing

this

oops should I go for a

gem yeah I'm not sure how I was supposed

to do that if I keep keep the mask it's

easier

but

then I have to go through this

part come

on careful I tried to be

careful I I to

be I try to be very

careful

okay

D

sh long as the fishes hand is

fine

there we

go there we go

no getting sucked back into

it

okay

good good

good

nice

nice check my

please okay then I had to remember that

there is a snake

here

that doesn't it seem easier to activate

that in the

OR okay I'm actually surprised I got

this

[Laughter]

far

no shark

shark okay

um

okay there's a shark here but yeah I

yeah I cannot get past that shark I

basically have to kill that

shark like that's a really really nrow

tunnel I do not see it being possible to

get through there

without without some

yeah I I have to do

that I hope I have M

up I mean I get a purple gem

but yeah me the boook I know red gam not

purle

Jam I was wrong this whole time it's a

red Jam I missed one box some box

somewhere you know it it was probably

one with

that the water thing so much time spent

and I didn't even get the box

[Music]

him so such

sadness big big

sness

so much for 100%

game I mean it was possible it's just

that one shark that has

to be

dead okay this is another level I should

be able to get the box G on cuz this

seam doesn't have an

inite good love you too oh hello

[Music]

care those green boxes might be green

like you but I do not recommend you

touching

[Music]

them you don't go see crash touching

orange boxes oh

wa

ni is doing

[Applause]

that come on go you can do it you could

do

it there you

[Music]

go more of

[Applause]

these

one there we go many attempts

[Music]

[Applause]

lat so far I think every enemy is

[Music]

[Music]

line there's one frog that might

die I think it was this level

I'm

sorry didn't mean to attack you at least

the enemy didn't die but he lost his

robe okay all of his

clothing but still alive so that's

good that's all that counts

right

and then jump over

this we get to

this I can take care of

this

[Music]

ah H everything I think everything PR

bonus not enough for one extra life but

very

close let me see if I

can

w

and jump

near gu P pun does not kill her

enemies murder is not necessary to solve

a

conflict

she's walking around

[Music]

everything walking

[Music]

around walking on the level geometry

with the that's kind of what working

[Music]

on taking stuff over

time how I getting more and more

tight the viewer count

ready really chips between like 10 years

and now you're on my time you little

skunk I'm not a

thing to come out

of those spinky

things so let's do the

bonus and there's

one another box I don't know how
