and now it finds the picture and the
audio a bit of a messy way of doing it I
would like a new capture card it works
but
but yeah
that you have to mess around a bit to
make it work that's it
that's the annoying part
it seems to have cropped picture
perfectly almost
yeah because I played game before
oh
so it's
perfectly crooked and is it should be
[Music]
there again that's the pictures on
screen
are you happy now
[Music]
foreign
no Daisy
must rescue my Daisy but wow
Hey Jake how's it hanging come on I'll
race to the top of the hill Oh Brother
people are so insensitive but I need to
get back in shape if I'm gonna look for
Daisy hold on to your pants here I come
okay
what's the
name volume like
foreign
place
so
[Music]
yeah how did I do this
[Music]
maybe stuff around
[Music]
[Music]
taxi standing yeah I expected it to say
anything
I started the game
and then here and you didn't
when the dog is sitting dog is lying
down
it started the game when you're not
saying anything
the dog isn't sitting what are you
talking about
what are you talking about
[Music]
must play with ball
let's do this
[Music]
I can do better than that
I need to find the correct position
I have to finding it correctness
Jake shoots he scores two more to go
I think I have to stand bite me that was
almost in
basically I have to
I have yeah he's not easy to control I
must say
[Music]
there you go oh yes sorry
Jordan one more to go I mean this is ah
so close
I mean this is our phone to collect so
oh yes sniff my butt this dog is bad
oh
yeah
I mean yeah this is Unbound correct so I
mean
how long how long would it take to even
do this glitch
right I think I said
because I actually don't know I
I don't really feel like placing the
whole game
to be honest
[Music]
okay
foreign
[Music]
settings can I
load from here now I have to quit
and after I quit
let's see quitting
let's honest semi stuff but I don't
think so yeah quickly and starting game
takes a long time
[Music]
but that's why I'm there's a hundreds
and five pounds the other one has 127
because I did the build at least twice
I'll probably take up the hill property
Captain so I'm just a kit yeah
yeah I want to see how long this takes
that took quite a long time
and then I had to run back on probably
yeah
so yeah yeah this will take it way too
long
it's not worth it
foreign
[Music]
thing and now I'm back now must play
with ball
sit
and share that
it's a glitch
ing
Jake shoots he scores two more to go
he's quite flexible I must say
and
[Music]
necessarily I can do better than that
yeah I didn't even throw it
let's face it I suck big time
yeah yeah I mean
I can like
need to actually also
managed to do this challenge this time
as well I can do better than that
okay
don't forget Spanish I will forget this
valuation
foreign
yes Jakey boy rules a four-legged
Michael Jordan one more to go
bones that's what it's all about
and now it's still
you know only collected a single burn
or is it
17.55 okay
[Music]
let's measure how long it takes I mean
that I collected that for entirely
because
basically missing half the shots
it should shake if just saving on their
own words because it might
because in that case I don't have to
restart game
oh
it is worth a try at least that would
also the saturations
[Music]
only one of these filters that's
[Music]
funny
14 44 45
[Applause]
[Music]
yeah I don't think this will count we'll
see if you see
well it raised it
Jake is not saying anything so I assume
this is
n't but that was certainly much easier
and two and a half minutes
so yeah because I suck definitely
but even if you count like three minutes
to
[Music]
for each bone and I need
88 bones
well that's a quick calculation 88 times
three minutes divided by 60 is four and
a half hours
that's nothing
and you need 888 because the other two
other bones you need will be applied for
necessary yeah
oh my God
oh sorry Jake
[Applause]
[Music]
it happens
my car is
the same way with ball
I think the position of the ball that's
interesting
and now he sent me nine for the bomb
let's face this I suck big time
and and I missed that one again it's
like a replay
of everything
I'm living in an endless Hill
Jake shoots he scores two more to go
doing the same thing over and over
oh yes Jakey boy ruled the four-legged
Michael Jordan one more to go
bones who could live without him
they bones yeah this is going to sneak
out forever is there something more fun
which is not the complete this game hey
guys
sure
that's your characters
you just did that I I calculated by
three hours three minutes
oh
[ __ ]
all right I mean I have seatbelts now so
you can do like
a calculation based on that how quick
this will be
yeah this will take hours
so
yeah he's too happy
they should do something else
[Music]
let's continue until you come up with a
better idea
[Music]
a bit of this Challenge from time to
time
and then eventually I will have 88
points
originally when he has to wake up next
time
[Music]
that was quite funny there's some ass
beat running strategy
foreign
[Music]
must play with ball
he must be tall
[Music]
yeah I'm getting ready take shoots he
scores two more to go
oh yes Jakey boy rules the four-legged
Michael Jordan one more to go
I can do better than that
beat the game without using smelling I
am
can't you see it
oh yes sniff my butt this dog is bad
all right the ball is in there I can
just remember where the ball is
but I mean it taking three hours to do
this Challenge and three hours theater
whole game
it's the same thing
right
[Applause]
we have to take about the same length
now I need a pattern here
this was a fun idea but I need a better
idea
[Music]
I got four pants
only one on the bed bed
s with one on the paper
anyway
[Music]
speed running jumping
and so far there
I know the a game that I would call it
Theory I'm telling this game I don't
have a thing
they must play with ball I have several
games
[Music]
a cute there's actually one game I could
play now
he scores two more to go I just need to
know remember the name of the game is I
don't have the money oh yes Jakey boy
rules the four-legged Michael Jordan one
more to go I want someone who wants to
donate
oh yeah yes sniff my butt this dog is
bad
I mean five bones from the same
from the same challenge this that's
pretty good I'm saying
about doing anything else
it's actually been less than three hours
actually
it will actually be less than three
hours actually yeah that's that's what
you wrote
you to say so okay let me see what other
games called
I can find it let's see lucky
story
oh wait I know
[Music]
I just need to remember the name of
these things
[Music]
and I'm terrible with names so that's
not a quick combination
it was one of the new ones I started
following
there you go
I remember
don't feel bad if I don't remember your
name it's
[Music]
terrible
okay I got it I got the title and of the
game
just be quiet
is it available on Steam
and for how much
once team is starting so
let me continue
is my wasting time thing
because it looks actually like a quite
interesting game
it's kind of a puzzle platformer of some
sort
so
I think it would be great
and I think that's like a
smaller
okay it's not that I'm not going to be
completing the hours but it's not like
like here say say for example A Dog's
Life
it's more of a story on Gummy story
I don't want to like starts that kind of
game like that I could actually
so again more like Need for Speed I
could do but I'm actually doing a Need
for Speed so
its theme has almost launched
knotty piece
must play with ball
which I don't know
Jake shoots he scores two more to go
the four-legged Michael Jordan one more
to go
is there a quick action to be honest
but no I I have distracted by everything
then I go to the store
[Music]
oh no not the bees not the bees
and then my search
for the title there is the game
and it costs 20 years it is a nice
looking game so I kind of
this then 150 20 50.
[Music]
yeah I can actually get the second game
cleared it in the patches and actually I
can say one cent by getting a bundle
with another cake
yes the bundle is unsafe
oh
I guess be it being abundant it cannot
stay out of it but
I'd say no
it's like both games cost the same
and then
the bundle is half the price of both
games so yeah you probably want to get
the other for free and I sent back
foreign
[Music]
if I had the 20 Euro to spend I could
get it
and that would be great
[Music]
[Music]
there you have steam I do have steam
that's why I got a spider
[Music]
um
let me just fetch my steam credentials
Jake wakes up
[Music]
s-t-e-r-m level Swedish
well m is supposed to get his s t e r m
s t e a m
[Music]
H early there's a pain in it
anyway
team account is
must play with ball
[Music]
he scores two more to go
oh yes Jakey boy rules the four-legged
Michael Jordan one more to go
Simply the Best
only take could run faster
one two three four five six seven eight
nine so technically
[Music]
I still don't have enough balance to
pretend I got everyone of this very
interesting
[Music]
and I say strange I understand there's
just a single save point in every
yeah
for every area it makes sense like you
have the local dog
and then at the local dog of this area
is supposed to be Jade because there's
no other dog however that's absurd but
but that's the uh the daisy stockhouse
yeah it doesn't have its own
and this is kind of the local dog in
this island who has been Kingdom I guess
I guess both are local dogs here
but why doesn't they JK I mean they
could have two dog houses
so anyway
let me log into steam
the username
paste his name
copy past e password use password I'm
sorry if I have ignore any messages
squeak squeak squeak squeak on you in
the bath
yeah you haven't turned into a mouse all
of a sudden
[Music]
logging in oh is that login I was going
to say how long is this 20. sometimes
it's unfair
[Music]
can access
okay I have my Steam account
can I place the
oh yeah so I can play Spyro
[Music]
okay I see I see
[Music]
because I started as
this starts with my Pom-Pom like pumpkin
Persona before I started streaming
but it's still a quite a recent persona
and my
Steam games are on my previous Persona
which has
student sales today which has no
connection to
[Music]
go
I will in the future purchase all the
game for money Persona I did ask
steam if I could like move over to
purchase of something but no they
couldn't do that it was a shame
but as far as I can tell as long as I
can log into both account on Steam but I
can still access them on my new account
I must play with balls that's convenient
that I can do that
so it's so it's not actually going to be
a problem
Jake shoots he scores two more to go
so that's good
oh yes Jakey boy rules the four-legged
Michael Jordan one more to go
so how about that I switched over to
playing that
all the game
hustle platformer game
they take your strange
guys
can I like start
now I can probably not do it from here
because
now because
damn damn damn damn damn damn damn
I want to point out that it is currently
running
original hardware and I'm taking running
a digital copy of the game
yeah
for the sake of convenience and to not
why am I still doing this I'm stupid
I at least wanted a kid
so that's the that but um
yeah I don't have money
[Music]
I should have like uh
[Music]
donate money to
come from the bonbon
either by providing a steam gift card or
by
sending money to
patreon I think that should work
if if you want I want I would love if I
could like
[Music]
to do that
provide like
English 10.
because about that because what I don't
understand
why with ball
is that you put
transmission camera hey
you paint okay
he scores two more times
[Music]
if you're going to push it if someone's
going to Personal Steam gift card it's
not going only
oh yes Jakey boy rules the four-legged
Michael Jordan I think they put that
restriction on that because this health
system was abused you can
only use the gift card within the same
region can I use it yeah
origin
but
[Music]
ah so close
that's too close
yeah I saw someone living that I would
need a list of regions that can buy a
gift card
for me on Steam
so uh Europe region one
and buys gift cards
Europe region two cannot as far as I
know
[Music]
here we have an example of adding
Dynamic shadows and and
this is a big Shadow so they have
already calculated where to go and that
bird was using a dynamic Shadow which is
on the Fly
and as we can determine the big chat
room is incorrect
[Music]
I actually need to read up on this
because this is actually
steam gift card can you can you buy it
wait you can buy wait not not that you
buy it you can't
on Steam you can buy a game as a game
okay
uh Steam
[Music]
and give gift gift game regions
different region
a read jurisdiction some steam let's see
let's quite
steam store purchases uh
let me also read the chat in case if I
write something do you products I
purchased on my Steam account have any
reason restriction well if you purchase
yourself you shouldn't in most cases
there are no region restriction
directed on the steam store however
Pearl expression as gifts
may have related restrictions see the
gift sections for more yes
steam gifts our steam gifts really
restricted gifts purchase in certain
regions can be redeemed on the in those
regions when you purchase a gift you
will be not the notified objector of
Andrew's digital might will be placed on
the gift
an example of a gift person in Russia
and the countries that gives chemistry
is shown below
oh oh yeah okay so in this example this
is a person purchase person purchasing
in Russia
and a
that's excuse me
I can't bring it up on screen actually
wanted to delete it no I didn't
thank you
not like clear
give Pleasures for Borderlands deep
Breezy you can only be added to the gift
receptions Library if they are in the
following countries
and I'm sure defense Russian Federation
instead of expression whatever
email my gift to this person uh so all
you have to do
is basically if you if someone were to
gift want to give me a game
you you basically have to make sure that
I don't actually not know how it would
say in this case
because the whole EU should be a single
gift region so it might say European
Union well it might say you're you one
or it might at least every single
European Union
member state
hello Clyde welcome the well I know
these game category of this stream is
bit weird it's kind of a special event
I'm currently looking at uh
potential
gift giving
and the idea was to do some kind of a
channel Point Casino sing
come up with ideas we do some challenge
either that I'm challenged to do
something
I hope you don't have ads or anything
let me know if you have ads I mean
so yeah so that's the
well
maybe I should go to the store and check
what happens if I select the gift again
yeah it is to see because if a game has
the because as far as I know the reason
why they have gift region restrictions
of of gifts is because different regions
have different prices
so you cannot purchase through a VPN or
some
third
is party who has purchased account on
Steam purchasing game and then sell it
online so I give code that's basically
how they worked
and allowing you to purchase games for
cheap
and I think they still do that but they
now they're doing that by buying games
on sale and then gifting out gay codes
later
so you can get a game or cheaper on sale
however there are issues by doing it
that way because there are risk for like
and that they will take I've heard but
that's probably just
Scare Tactics for to avoid people doing
this and that they can take away your
purchase because it is considered
illegitimate or something
but I'm not sure
if they would actually do that
foreign
that is
anyway back to what I was going to do
hey
if I choose
not good
or I can't purchase as a gift because I
have not this
okay okay
well yeah
okay so if you don't yeah when you
create a new Steam account you actually
have to purchase for according to steam
uh for at least five
U.S dollars and and then from that point
your account is considered active you
can still
I mean you still have an account you can
make purchase for less but you're
restricted for a gifting and friends and
stuff
but they
I don't exactly know why because I don't
think other services does that but that
does mean that I can't even see what
would happen if I try to do the gift
because it doesn't even allow me
oh well
very funny strange stream
but they're feel free to chat if you now
so you can't press up to go to the
bottom you have to press them it goes
through the whole list
well said feel free to attending the
point of today's stream was that people
should come up with different
challenges
for me to attempt alternatively just
other
[Music]
random chance guesses and then we make
predictions and then you bet Channel
points
and
that's it
that's the that's the
Dutch the core of today's stream so far
no one has come up with a challenge yet
they're free to be the first
about it
so yeah I should do like a single point
redeem
unless I'm actually not set that serum
then you just did redeem must question
with ball
it's that request YouTube input a text
which is basically the
redeem and the redness the challenge
scores two more to go
this game has some graphic images
oh yes sniff my butt this dog is bad
so anyway
what time
doing at the moment in dog's life is a
glitch where you can repeatedly pick up
the same bone
an infinite amount of times
I actually don't know if you can pick it
up and infant sometimes I'm not going to
try because I don't have infinite amount
of time
because it's a very simple process
but it is interesting that I managed to
get 10 Bones from a single challenge
and nothing else nothing smell or
anything
just just interesting
so let me
let me do that thing I said I was going
to do
right there here and then I go to
redeems
[Music]
and then I add a redeem
[Music]
a picture should we have a
chess piece and that seems like a good
one
then we set it to apparently at least
one point
and then we say
um
this challenge or something or
make a prediction
a
write art
challenge
and optionally which
options to include
and if I redeem and if a challenge isn't
going to be made I will simply refund it
but it's just a single point anyway so
no restrictions there you go
now
you should be able to find a new redeem
let's make a prediction
then just fill it out and
and that's it
and there's only nine dollars in this
level and I have 10.
I have currently more bones than should
be possible
isn't that amazing I say no
okay Jake
it's a pessimist
I thought it was amazing
foreign
rules the four-legged Michael Jordan one
more to go
oh
but this dog is bad neck 11 bounce
yep
this is allaher a single place service
that's a single smell 11 bones but it's
only one on the paper
amazing
I've been taking too long I think
something like half a half an hour to
get 11 Burns
I mean I'm being distracted by other
stuff too
and 11 bones is just 1 8 of the weight
to the 88 that means but I mean I don't
have to complete it today
because I think I can work on
at later points
I can do it off screen too
but it doesn't kind of bushy
[Music]
so
I don't have any fancy
UI or anything
well let's do something easier
DC then flip a coin
touch
I didn't ask you the flip it
foreign
I have hydrated
I will flip the coin
multiple times until either heads or
tails have reach
three
plus that
is the example of a prediction
and if you predict one of them and no
one predicts the other I will just
cancel the prediction as usual
because yeah at least I need someone to
[Music]
seconds
[Music]
only got three watches but
there's still three people there have
the option to be part of it unless you
are in one of the restricted
restricted features
each one of them is Sweden so
there are of course ways around that
making a prediction is not the same as
actually taking part of the prediction
if anyone's curious about that there's
one
and I got a message
maybe check the message of the job in
his pants
and other stuff it's in must play with
ball
[Music]
another response
come on Jake
[Music]
foreign
he scores two more to go
I only got more than two more inches
why that
much morning Tim oh yes Jakey boy ruled
the four-legged Michael Jordan one more
to go
oh yes sniff my butt this dog is bad
your butt
oh he scraped his belly on that one
chick
you think he's a cartoon and dinner
additional features
this this channel is really taking just
now so that's fine that's a fine
reference to make
just so you know I have changed series
you can always press the Cog wheel and
press
as dreamers solar challenge so whatever
it's gone
and that's the first scene that says 18
plants if you're not 18 you're not
supposed to be watching
that's basically how it works the most
chance
sound and speech why is that the same
I need to press
okay we can we can listen to a different
language
oh that's
how does Jake sound like in different
languages
it doesn't like it like yet one is
interesting you're going it's going to
click prediction
[Music]
I also where is kitten it was supposed
to be back now
[Music]
let's switch to Dutch I mean that was
the first language in list so
let me read the name of the place which
is there bird that I
was probably not correct
that was the best
I have of Dutch oh that fish blue
don't let the bees are saying why didn't
you look at this look at this
yeah
it's dutch Jake
Street and I scored knocked matron
[Music]
oh yes Jake is the best Michael Jordan
opioid
oh it been so hot that the flabberg
I can't judge the voice acting
a tiny fish
yeah yes there was a flying fish it just
flew up in the eye
Jake landed on it it got scared or
something I don't know
they do jump on their own they might be
just being timing
well
[Music]
um
yeah I guess that's the prediction was a
failure here
[Music]
am I supposed to press this button
releasing Watchers
[Music]
and also
this snoring is the same not strange
stay not straight I did
right there okay let's see what's the
next language once I
okay
wait that wasn't
how do I confirm
is that for me
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
Bello
[Music]
Jake marker
[Music]
Lenovo Michael Jordan
foreign
[Music]
so let's
go and see
it's about
um
animations in these games are so weird
again
he got stuck but somehow if the
animation got stuck but he continued
anything
it was weird
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
English it's a smart screen in Dutch
but
in French It also says 69.
that's nice of them
[Music]
thank you
14 pounds from a single challenge I'm
kind of happy with her Target
Anthony
I'm wasting time
[Music]
thank you
next let's check out the next language
Italian but this one says my skin since
minus one
over there
and also the Dog House says dog in
regardless of language because this game
like most games
don't actually change textures
[Applause]
when you
switch language a lot of games are like
that there are there are exceptions
[Music]
but most languages don't change textures
which makes it awkward when some
pictures
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
ending
when he's not playing the actual music
because he doesn't have the batteries
irregular level music is playing as
normal
but you can still hear him play
let's continue seeing this
language Adventure
[Music]
language
and German
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay let me go through a thing here
before I continue
all right
[Music]
and I need to do this first
[Music]

[Music]
thank you
[Music]
