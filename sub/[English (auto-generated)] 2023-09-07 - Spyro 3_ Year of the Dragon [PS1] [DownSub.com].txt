Hey where's the

picture there it is I'm not sure

why such time for it to appear on

screen that was

weird that was quite

weird that's just how obious is

sometimes I don't like about play games

is that we doesn't actually

make Sor I have gotten the

uh I forgot the let me let me fix the

you

[Music]

here we go the echo

dampening

equipment also known as hellow in a

cardboard

box was

yeah here we

go H yes oh now I can hear you yeah yeah

yeah I completely forgot to fix that

it's not the first

time apparently Sparks worlds is a

completely separate World from the rest

of the they did not do that in reunited

they consider Sparks worlds to be the

same as these

worlds and they considered the BS

level wait they actually show

the LEL

[Music]

names I think yeah in Sp to they

show

and and they show dashes for levels you

have not visited here they show the full

name of the

level I was going to say it's a sock

that

nope that wouldn't exactly reduce the

echo I

think

so I rescued everyone except the p

and so as should go and rescue the

whoops been a while since I played this

game like six days so so I missed the

gem last

gem but not last

egg didn't I maybe I didn't pick up this

egg

not not same as the

crunchy leg is in this

one apparently this is a change in R you

actually have to walk up to it andite it

just F the black and then you add it EG

there you go that's last EG now we can

go visit P level

complete bambo

teras

bambo bamboo

TS oh no the P pandas are

naked

Spyro rhox have been harassing us all

day the workers haven't been able to

harvest the bamboo needed for the whirly

gig to take you to evening Lake wait why

do I need bamboo for that is it for me

to

[Music]

eat and also

why wa can

you wa how close do you mean

oh

okay okay I just want to

see I'm just out of

range okay this isn't going to work

definitely

reignited oh

hello

look at

panda look at P make panda

[Music]

yeah is this meant to be

bamboo and also they turn that into a

cut scene Reed here you don't lose

control after rescue the P there some

interesting changes they made they also

made

he is no longer

flying oh yeah and the these have

collisions in reignited too there's so

many

differences play reignited so much

haven't played this in

years oh the graphics is better but

doesn't pushing that Boulder was hard

work but as soon as I've caught my

breath I'll return to collecting

bamboo

bamboo

[Music]

Bamboo conting the

[Music]

gem

boom can't I speak to this

panace

[Music]

not cuz the distance between the panda

and the Rhino is so great

that because again in

red if you get close to the

panda uh you too close to rinh the RH

stop you sneezed on me why is this

sneezing so much why are you standing

here the thre is

gone

this set has been

removed wait can

[Music]

I please be careful those Rockets are

dangerous

anyway

this oh you wanted run to the fire and

behind you and yeah I want to see like

he so much harder to do in this game and

compar

reunited a suspicious crack in a wall

extra

lives

talk to me Panda I don't care if you're

being chased by a r KN that's not my

problem exactly but it's is inter

because you can talk to them in Dr

accident and then they say

like get out of my way that's

D and they have tried to basically

recreate every line of dialogue so is

that a dialogue that exists in the game

that they just you are able to access in

reg it but very tricky to to access in

this game

or is that something they made up but

now I have to start over

over

because apparently they are not generous

enough to give me a checkpoint after

resuing all the panas in this

area there we

go that's what I wanted from the

start

[Music]

Madison drown butterflies those were in

jars so they they were

fine

white very very big

teeth okay so this pan is stand

here in Dr again if you just if you

remove that Ox thing that is close by it

moves over even though the O isn't

really blocking isn't really in the

way I

guess that wasn't the whole that wasn't

the point from the the original game

that o wasn't really in the

[Music]

way there go now I have a

[Music]

checkpoint H because let's see if that

works too if I if I leave that

one what happen with the

rocket do you see

that see it doesn't seem to be able

to this doesn't seem

to okay it does work it's just very hard

to do cuz even though you aim it

correctly after a short

while it's it it goes crazy it doesn't

seem to hit

anything what

bunny Sports word because I'm moving

around so much I

guess hey Cy

bunny

hello well cutee bunny to you as well

wait swim down SPID I'm pressing the

button to swim to to die hey Sparks why

are not picking up the gems what's wrong

with you oh now I

did that was

weird hello bunny y we have

bunny Bandits no wa bunny

mates fell of bunny bunnies together

strong helping each other out being

friendly and other things why are you

hiding behind

[Music]

you spikes is drying so he can want pick

up game but he's in a bubble it's

fine a lot of waves can you hurt pan

apparently you can oh I was trying to WR

costume we would be honored if you would

accept this as a token of our

appreciation sure I'll take this token

to to Tom that Tom means empty in

Swedish oh the Emer oh the emergency

esape Bridge why

woulding his bubble popped I didn't see

that run away Panda you get away from

this grace

[Music]

place

okay back

here oh look Bly to all exp to all

Explorers there is no yet here and there

was it was just a me as far as you

know signed the sourcers sign signed by

the

[Music]

sourcers I think that's a

[Music]

sign

and uh and after you rescue

Bentley he then goes around and change

all these signs to say that you have to

because he he has to you first have to

play his level before he's actually

available but he takes the time and go

around and replace every bentle sign

there is with his own sign saying that

you have to complete this level first

and then after you complete this level

because he's apparently busy he can't

this level he then goes around and plays

every sign again and saying that you're

welcome in that's a lot of a lot of work

for him to do for being so

busy that's especially specific uh

yeah wait waa wao you're going the wrong

way that's not the way you're supposed

to go you're you're breaking the

rules oh you're going this way

sure okay this this

uh didn't go as

planned bumo

Everywhere You

[Music]

Out

you

[Music]

out than than

the sure is

Qui and disa IM Escape

Bridge

Dam come here

safe

oh can't you

someday we'll be going at this for

hours there you

go

be

yep

quite there you go I think they should

get the jar

first

celebration the jar is here

point the J is there I think this change

the camera angle really nice making it a

bit more ambiguous with

this this is more fun to be

honest I think yeah I think the camera

is more zoomed in

in

Point making it so you have

you you see less of where it

[Music]

is so clearly clearly fling or charging

it doesn't break it you clear they must

do a head

bash anyway that's oh s you got in the

way wait do you say

that thank you ever so much much for

opening the emergency Bridge spiral well

you're welcome but I wasn't the one

opening it dooby dooby

dooo well uh that was

awkward it's like an AI voice oh you

want me to

say well I say that then doy doy

do yeah I think I think they captur that

a bit better than reignited that is more

of a

[Music]

or something let's head on over to the

worly

gig yeah they're speaking kind of like

yeah like

AI let's head over to the world

G I guess that's what you get with bad

acting next area oh boss well I forgot

about B sorry about that completely

forgot about that

actually you know what I will leave the

bus area and do another worthless fool I

ask you to carry out one simple task and

you fail me I should have known better

than to rely on a child I think that's

don't worry about

it okay after this I will leave the BS

area and then I will go and do the

flying level without the dragons the

Magic in this world will wither away

without magic I'll die and so will your

ever so slim chance of becoming a

sorceress Bianca is say frozen Now watch

how a real dispatches her

enemies how would you like some Dragon

for

lunch I why I had

[Music]

Scooby you

I know he didn't say that though I think

it's a

she I I think lingling is a

lady I about with no points cuz yeah I'm

sorry you have to use a

VPN okay I'm leave the B

area because I got other damage to do

anyway so

so you get more time to

vot even though you have no point to

vote with you still you still believe I

once I appreciate the

honesty

[Music]

country

Speedway can they do something like you

get double the points for like a certain

amount of

time if you're correct if you're wrong

you get no points for that amount of

[Music]

time yeah spks no one must listen to

your voice

the it's GE listen to them p p p wait

trumpet

song Here's a

hint hello

viini

Viper

VI hello hello and I also hello Mi yeah

m is here m is

here

hey see I can do this without flame W

don't stop

[Music]

spider no don't stop spider

[Music]

they're not protesting no why did you

jump why why did you

jump he just went

up he just went up into the air for some

reason every time you stumble with my

name okay just right is fine for like

the fif time but I like to say your full

name I'd like to say everyone's full

name on on Twitch like at least at least

once every time you show up that's like

my

greeing I know it's

weird and it would be very weird in real

[Music]

life I did

[Music]

all is definitely harder in this

game but I will do it no I missed it

okay I whatever I'll do it normally

[Music]

now but I kind of prove that that

Dam yes that

happened okay I guess I'm not doing it

normally

[Music]

then

I was going to say okay I'm not I'm not

doing it normally I will do it immorally

but I wasn't doing the opposite of

[Music]

normal oh no I missed

one I guess I'll just have to run and

get

one

I would have been done by now if I if I

didn't miss that

one there you go I did

[Music]

it

celebration

Okay g

g they gave in and gave me an egg

okay let's find

Hunter I got some sheep to

kill winkle winkle winkle winkle see

it's fun here

Spyro this there are sheep saers and

space you're not going I canot believe

it we got

to if you yes strap on Hunter let's do

it

look out cows here I

come oh there we go that's a shoot

button complet wa that count this some

quite the power in this laser when it

makes them fly away so

hard

they make no celebration for being

rescued how sad it's so funny when they

Ste W wo are they

attacking didn't think they

would it's definitely much easier to

shoot in this end than Rite that's a

huge difference oops I think I think the

lace is

quicker it's kind of slow but it

definitely is quicker and it jite they

also seem to be

Invincible until you get close enough to

them to they where they become active

and

shootable

cuz you can definitely not shoot it that

early I

think look at these textureless

[Music]

polygons

that sound effect when they die I did

it we got the last one just before he

abducted this egg looks more like he was

going to

shoot Roberto a cow oh where did the

bubble come from why is this an air

bubble okay raise the B planes first it

was butterflies now it's by I mean first

was but flies and now it's now it's

bisexual planes okay you know I'll give

up I

start I

[Music]

bisexual a b bunny is going to win

against some B

planes that was not attack

button

I'm funny I'm

[Music]

die why why you you crying right

[Music]

right we have to have fun and be happy

not

cry

[Music]

that wasn't the one I

wanted no side

[Music]

Fair

because which I haven't realized before

but again which I talk about every time

I play this game

inited and someone pointed out that that

very fa that particular fa with the

arrow is really large compared to how

large f are

[Music]

normally and I'm thinking that's because

whenever play testing the Remake they

know this people have struggled seeing

the fire or something see or like

confusing where they should go maybe the

fa

Mission anyway where's the where is the

plane first

position It's the final lap now

so

[Music]

I must catch it oh there it

[Music]

is go for the first

plane first plane oh

wait I I touched

it def not cheating using

[Music]

missiles oh I got

it

well okay I'll soon reach the

go this is Two

Face the face use Magics they would cast

an En large B

on that sounds

great

whoa I got an

egg shamp but not a doctor shamp a shamp

a girl's

name I would want to play The Challenge

quck do I have to go no you can

fly there's still time left on the

prediction because I forgot one thing in

the first

world I should have rescued and played

the sergeant bird level

first and then I should have gone back

to the first world and done the sergeant

bird part of that

level and and then when I go and defeat

the boss let's see how well that goes

like when I attempt

that I will then rescue Bentley and then

go back and do the

b

l do not remove memory card me removes

memory card of course I don't like

technology to tell me what to do well it

didn't tell you what to do it told you

what not to

do but yeah yeah yeah only only if it

says please you will listen otherwise

you can do the quite the opposite of

what it tells you to

do we said please do not remove Mar oh

that's fine hello Spyro I'm just hello

bird let's let's get it

going hello wait does this thing does it

probably

doesn't cuz apparently Rite if you're

not mistaken when you again Reed W he

moves quite quickly if you add all these

hands

then Luna n that's a g thing

right why is that model again it's

basically the only beam and dragon model

that does not have a bow wasn't touching

the B appar it didn't even take damage

bad just not cause

damage let me grab

that hey Birds then I'll kill me will

respawn anyways it's

[Music]

fine and

then okay whoops now say got the

burn

no out yeah he's not my favorite

character

there we

go I guess I'll continue

here was this just the other entrance to

the same area I

think

yeah well then let's move

out

yeah basically because I I'm not a fan

of military theme

stuff just don't like

[Music]

it I don't

know some

seems some seems I just

boring

watch out BS coming

through there you where was

I yeah

here

it

you bur but you don't M you don't

murder you will just

[Music]

respond which one I have not put back

the head on

yet

F yeah take take this egg as a sign of

your honorary membership in the lodge oh

thank you yeah they missing this trigger

apparently in United you have to if you

connect Ryan if you well that's

never

go if you add all the heads without

speaking to him you don't get EG you

have you had then have to speak to

him and then he says his line and then

and then it will trigger the egg it's a

bit silly there you go now I think I'm

done with

everything I hope everyone has

voted well it doesn't seem like there's

going to be a prediction because no one

has made a counter vote if there's not a

counter vote to the current vote it's

not going to be a prediction because

this not going to be any

wi I mean it's iay

i i i i the

um will fail once and get one to two

deaths and whoever everyone has aved one

to two will get their portion back and

nothing else or any of the other options

would win and then I will just refund

everyone

so I guess there no predictions

then you get my coins back where or no

no either you get your coins back or you

get your Co either you win your coins

back or you get your coin coins refunded

that's your two

options all

right do a quick counter

offer counter

be

sorcerers would attack you here so I

flew in to help out it seems my rocket

she

yeah says red dragon 690

last boss batt so he does not

have so does not have

any believe that I'll do it well which

is understandable I I I I understand

it I I did that last b l

b who would who would trust me at this

point that's why season of flame is

great she can squish enemies under her

butt you say so let's go back and do the

two

levels oh yeah we got at least three

people voting good good good good I do

like

that so where was I going I was going to

the hand the

level watch out

bunnies one next

[Music]

yes I'm going go grab a

drink yeah is quite while the most you

got plenty of

time I don't think the enemies are

complaining they're dead yeah I mean yes

fine they are dead so they can't

complain

anyway moving on to the B

level welcome a mosted dragon

sign sign by

Ben

What a fine day for a bit of a walk yes

she just going to casually walk up to

the top of the mountain with any

obstruction that want think I saw some

rhox run up to the top of that hill with

an oh the rhinox here I thought that was

going to have a casual walk up the

mountain without any obstruction at

all sadly oh you can destroy that

rocket but sadly that was not the case

so you cannot spin the be ground

rocks even though they look ball shaped

and you were just thought that if you

get something ballshit thrown at you you

should spin it and it will bounce back

but apparently not in this level

because even though they just establish

the roots they are going to break them

immediately isn't that typical of Spyro

I think that's that's quite common in

spy two and

three they do love to break establish

R SP one is so yeah and then this thing

comes and then you can do that with

it there also quite a size difference

between that one in this game and B KN

in this

one by one was so simple that div was

barely rules to break in the first place

I do not that

one let's let's see this

bounc WOW w wow how did it bounce higher

than it starting point that doesn't make

any

sense I know

you can't defeat all the crabs on the

course and still beat me in a race want

to give it a shot I mean that that's s

another Fat race out there I thought I

thought you wanted a real

race I thought you wanted that real race

then you call then you come with this

challenge about well you have to win

against me but you have to also defeat

all the crabs while I don't have to do

that and spider crashes into a

one oh come

oh what no oh I I that's I

[Music]

did

[Music]

than

you sheesh I can't believe you beat me

you must have been practicing the whole

time I thought you were looking for eggs

then why are you putting up me up to

this geneses or refuse to give me the

eggs unless you aen unless I'll beat

you Hunter is the worst character in

Spire even worse than Moneybags at least

moneybag would give me an in exchange

for

money he wouldn't put me through these

stupid

challenges how start with Rocky boost by

Spar doesn't that Che thing yeah and spy

Spy and Hunter require spy to take out

all the RS while he doesn't have

to that's

cheating I can't tell this P version

this level of playing the music from the

bonus

level also playing the game in 25 friend

second but maybe you can tell that I

mean some people apparently

can

some people are crazy like

that ow come on I almost did it there we

go that's why I

want be right

back yeah don't be a crooked

back yeah I don't get why the songs are

different between two

[Music]

versions this is not this isn't the Sha

[Music]

music CU that gen It Don't Fit this

level well I guess it

say

uh I guess it's say broadcasting now

going to reject that

red well that was

Weir all of a sudden he just decided to

disconnect I mean it has happened

before not the first time it has

happened I have connection just that for

some reason

just he just doesn't stand it say twitch

anymore I don't know why he does

that here we

go more

first oh I accidentally got that

one

they stop being in the air I can see it

in the

distance there's stoping in the

air they fly a certain

distance there we go

finally I think that's one

[Music]

Birds

[Music]

and of course I'm going to show as now

because hope the

disconnect anyway as long as everyone is

still here that's the most

important damn I saw that oh

let me help these here Waters used to be

my favorite diving spot wait you dive

here do you mean di in using the

submarine the U

booat turn

around might have turn around

that makes sense

but

Diamond

just as is into this water doesn't seem

safe

go that doesn't wait why did it

l

is this thing mini

submarines sub

mining

subing

it's not a lot some can I shoot

this I know I can charge it as SP

but that way I don't have to charge it I

can

just go byy it and get a

gem te Sparks can pick up the gem if the

gem is loose but he can't pick it up if

it's inside the bom that is might seem

here not yet at

least

Waters and he I

want well this okay that boat just

crashed into

he

[Music]

thank you two more we do have to tumor

they are

[Music]

tumors

when did you turn

around doesn't make any sense and the

balls I destroyed it came back as

balls first turning around allowed me to

chase you if you didn't turn around and

came at me that would make it harder for

me to shoot you because I hold this

waiting period to

aim the last one is

[Music]

hiding

going

T I can't see

anything like I can't keep up there we

go like you goes quicker than I can and

if I try try to take a shortcut the

camera

breaks

I find

any they are running around they driving

the submarines and only their underwear

as you do as you know

Dragon celebration number two this means

I can go into the water as much as I

want and no

one no one can stop me hey Sparks are

you going to try to grab this thank

you it that's your single job on this

adventure while iide from the level is

dedicated to I

[Music]

guess Plus spks have longer range on his

gem collecting and he still doesn't

collect some of his

gems he's he's a bit lazy

sometimes like Sparks why don't you

collect this I don't feel like it he

would sound more

like shiny jams in the potion

water is that is that a song

Titan

might as well

be no no I

know well I mean it could

[Music]

be wait how many songs there

are in the PO

you poisonous

water I I'll accept that as

a as a acceptable

violence I think I got the only gems in

now this one is not going to do it this

one

though when I said it was an AEG it

wasn't an

[Music]

ache there you

go now I can pick it up Jem finding

finding ability

exactly I can do it without

it so

let's and let's go and pick out those

missing 60

gems I can move on to the next

level

[Music]

oh

no that wasn't 60

gems I'm still missing 49 gems what can

49 gems

[Music]

behind 49

gems feel like I've been to both bonus

areas and clear them

his

[Music]

rings I don't hear

it

[Music]

oops where are those 49 it's not 49 gems

it's only 305

GS

I think I found

[Music]

him whoa oh no no spider you're going to

die spider

died Spyro has suffered the illness of

death it's a terminal

illness let's get out of

[Music]

here but he died collecting all the gems

so it's not a complete

loss well yeah good thing keep the gems

and don't lose

them and then I need to

do p speed

way this is another level the

hunter swimsuit for the honey Speedway

sounds

good I'm not going to swim in the honey

just so yours so yes there's no

misunderstanding here

[Music]

now is what honey spinway not honey comb

spinway Sparks get

here

stuff can't even get the name of the lon

CR oh that's swim me the honey

nope no swimming in the

honey oh look

Hunter

H sorry for that Force

pun why isn't Hunter inside

the

temple I guess it's not worse being

inside

it

what look at those

smes freaky

smes move out the

way why are you driving boats in the

honey don't you know how unsanitary that

[Music]

is yeah I would say the Speedways in

spicy are so much easier than previous

ones cuz you know how much I messed

[Music]

up ring ring ring ring Yi we want

another no I want another Xbox you did

nothing

Chris they're going to Sease up their

boat

motor well now the it's it's motors made

to run in Honey

obviously obviously they're not

stupid except they are Spyro there's a

really big sheep UFO around here okay

let's let's go let's go

it's one of those honey the motor is

designed to run through

honey

Sor yeah think the other side of the

boat would been destroyed by

that good by hter no one's going to me

you look out Spyro he's not not even

going to comment on that just got

kidnapped but

ah ah minor

inconvenience

oops I'm going to run in into everything

apparently apparently I'm running into

everything Hunter's going to get loboiz

and up his highy

obviously there you

go

imagine jumping like this in the

boat just floating in

there

oh the boat just came up I mean the did

you see that nobody outraces a

cheatah and

Hunter S that look s like a girl's name

maybe that is a

again cuz it rainbow wings and pink

thing but uh but Hunter have you

forgotten that I won over you in

skateboarding I outran

you I mean using a form of Transport

but I mean in this case it was a UFO

versus a boat not a sheep versus a

cheetah but apparently that count as a

that counted as a sheep against a

cheetah so Hunter and spider on

skateboard countes a dragon versus a

cheah too I me Lally

speaking right up he B but lucky for

him there's not much there to be L lotm

yeah he's safe he can't be

lobotomized it would be illogical to

even be able to do so such a

thing

it's activating this ASD

can

use which is used to blow up that

[Music]

thing and here it

comes

boom

[Music]

eess yeah I'm not really sure how they s

they must have the rockets explode that

scene first and then they added the fire

power up and kind of forgot about the

rocket that's the only thing doesn't

make sense to

[Music]

me head

pets but like the Jem just fall down

there and reignited it come straight to

I'm going to use

it I'm going to play this level my

[Music]

way

[Music]

excuse

me you you can't use to you can't use

the fireball on big enemies

apparently pretty sure you can they must

have forgotten

that I get that cat oh what okay cat

didn't die until the cat came on the

screen

again well that was

interesting and then it doesn't open

until you get close to

it okay the game doesn't break at

least but it had some interesting

effects

oops Health

finally I was wondering where Health

was oh right it's red and green it's all

Christmas

thing oh there's a Pur here how did this

come in

[Music]

here w

[Music]

w

interesting

[Music]

what lots of gems I do like

[Music]

gems

oh hi

Spyro isn't Prince azriel just the

dreamiest the other fairies and wizards

won't let us get married so we're going

toope by the way azreel says you can

have this egg if you don't tell anyone

where we

went I don't even know where you're

going so sure Sakura I can take it oh

look it's a girl

[Music]

dragon

is a flying yeah if you going to

teleport away I can definitely not tell

where you went so trust me I'm not going

to tell all the fa where you

went wait should shouldn't be a magical

drawer

here so I have no idea where you

[Music]

went very semi here okay

work yeah now

this now there

is there's a whole bonus level

here it's a

very very very and apparently you can

walk to side but look according to

Legends there's a Golden Goose at the

top of this here Mountain I want to be

the first person to the top so

I I mean it is a tower not a

[Music]

mountain I wonder if the pink bouncy one

is a pink

bom and I wonder if the yellow Unbound

is a yellow un

bom wait why didn't this

work is is so close

how accurate do you need to

pee

wait okay okay that didn't

work and she's dressed as Princess Peach

I don't think she was

really maybe she was I didn't get that

feeling at

least so empty

okay

pick it up pick it up pick it up pick it

[Music]

up nope that did not

work I need the Bing

bouns there we go that's a good

balance I think you only need to use

flame one not twice in the soul

[Music]

puzzle do thing I do get the feeling

that they want you to have this flipped

around

[Music]

and

then we like you do the same solution as

in United but the way you nav like the

way you use the

SE it's like difference I found this egg

on the way up here oh thank you thank

you for sharing it with me just like

that

sh it's a girl Dragon because there's a

bow I've say it every time great so but

but if every girl dragon has a

b just saying it because it's

[Music]

true what is

that up

spidal why didn't that

grow there you

go that wasn't so hard was

it must sh

[Music]

scene sure is magical

mushrooms don't swallow those Bean

[Music]

spiral oh I

[Music]

miss ow you can't you bounce you bounce

really high

okay well you do have to use flame three

times because there's two places you use

flame but you use it technically three

times because this was the thir time but

the second place use it

in

but that's just DET

thingss and I like DET

thingss this is one of the levels you

can't complete with your with the no CL

challenge cuz

well you can't fly on the

flowers specific with this part you can

do most of

this no wait you can't even speit I

forgot about that you can't even speit

the seed yeah that's the

Bas yeah I forgot about the forget about

the

whole okay using flame to switch them

around you can't

even you can't even spit

them don't swallow those beans by his at

I found the legendary Golden Goose you

can have another one of its eggs for a

souvenir okay I'll take a golden goose

egg

Chuck let's see this what's this that

doesn't look like a Golden

Goose that's the ugliest Goose I've ever

seen if you say so you are also the

ugliest go I ever

seen

[Music]

no

go has

been that was why they haven't they put

anything behind here they could have put

like life jar or

something you got like double time on

the swim seat

I was so mesmerized by this

[Music]

level oh no did J move

back but I didn't see the jar work like

that I S of remember where it was I mean

I only remember there and didn't move it

further I think so wasn't that big of

L okay this cat is much harder in see

now I'm going to do this bonus and back

that is much harder to reignite it

because it only attacks when you

approaches and here appar attacks when

stand on I'd like to stay in chat but

I'm late for a uh an engagement with a

fairy friend of mine she's just a friend

you understand understand it's a

strictly platonic relationship it's

certainly not a violation of military

protocol

whatsoever what what are you giving me

that look

for this proba always has the same

look where is the Shea LEL you where

native English speaker I don't know how

oh here here's the

gy there we go now I found the

[Music]

old hello just cat nice to see

that take all the time you

need that of course goes that of course

goes for both Raiders and non-

Raiders if you need to leave that's

perfectly fine respect

that even if someone just comes by for

us for a few seconds that's that's still

nice nice to see people saying hello

toy by hand to sey right for not seeing

him before pushing random buttons on the

ground I mean SP is pushing all kinds of

random buttons

so oh there it

is every but you see as a spire you

should

push as they do things for

you

and let's go to the firework

Factory let's fire some fireworks wait

how long have been going on for I

started 16 it's almost 19 so almost gone

for 3 hours well I was so close to the

boss so I should probably oh I got that

gem let's start so I should probably

wait how many levels do I have

left yeah and then it's just Frozen

altars and then I have uh and I do like

the music in fro Frozen

altars she's

strong oh hello it's good to see you

that naughty sorceress has stolen the

professor's rocket plans and I'm on a

secret mission to find them okay see

secret mission

time

a I think I hit the wrong person

there Spy War Factory 10 10 minutes to 3

hours yes see it's 10 10 to 3 hours

that's I had the clock on screen I start

at

16 so

I have been considering

adding

uh yeah the these enemies do

respawn I have considered adding a timer

that counts how long I have been

streaming

for oh just sad you don't fall into the

lava that been

fun yeah I just don't

know like visually how I put everything

I don't think my stream is very like

visually amazing as many other streams

it

just it just

that quite not too advanced looking chat

it's just some bunnies scrolling in the

empty space for the background because

this is not a wi screen game and then

you SM model that doesn't even move when

I speak

because this computer is fairly weak so

it starts to lag when I play certain

games with the model

animated and to ensure some consistency

throughout my stream I just don't have

any any stream being

animated W they should fly all over the

place

here secret mission not secret I'm sorry

I'm sorry this say secret mission with

spy I'm just the

rabit I'm a sweet rabit I'm just going

on a secret mission or an

egg going for the

egg

noodles that does m or female

Dr let's get another

firework oh

no come on turn around

Spyro I

died this isn't D's T you should be able

to turn around yes

fine yeah I'll take this path

then apparently that's so much for

taking that

path let's get this

rocket there's a rocket here wow

what

boom so much work when I didn't have to

do it at this I one lot of Health for

nothing I didn't aim there but

sure you probably didn't feel anything

though was

quick you

survived

since the baby dragons have names when

they have I wonder if SPID name SPID

names them on the

spot on based on the spots of the age I

don't know I know what you mean

um that maybe that's why they have so

terrible

names it looks like you'll have to use

this cannon to get across here simply

climb a board as for me I just have to

free my mind yes free your mind I want

to jump like

that it lands on other side and get a

bit squishy I went over

rocket that's why they have so t heav b

names Spire is not good with coming of

names like oh this this is a Chinese

based I think

level therefore we going to name these

dragon

noodles because of

course stop doing that it

hurts take this

rocket

and

aim in the

heal

boom Al don't this get destroyed in one

hit in very

United here they require two hits an

interesting

change wait I shouldn't have gone here I

should have unlocked your can

anyway rhinos got blown yeah that's

that's oh look it's him uhoh you have to

use this combo power up to take out

these fire wagons yes these fire

wagons let's go fight

wagons come on F wagons they they're

quite thing here did they they did make

them sicker

inited probably to make it easier to hit

them

that was easy to see

[Music]

too

oh no tricky one went up to went to the

side oh I'm hitting the red

one tricky

one enough do yet to

get

we go two more hits or Z one more hits I

mean z z more hits

now let's go in a

second

now don't turn around one more

hit Oh yay I got it have this I fished

it out of the M lava

oh thank you for doing it Evan but

clearly you didn't want to give me it

until I got rid of the Dragons but I

guess you're not a dragon or like

helping Spyro like I guess I guess it

makes sense that you want me to help you

so you can help

me I mean it's still kind of F I mean it

is a baby dragon we still talking about

like the form of kidnapping here

[Music]

no those the boss enemies from the

speedway level season of ice I think it

was it like no the the ones in the boss

level Speedway levels if like they they

are like

that

yeah I still Haven to complete SE I'm a

failing other people have

so possibil to I'm just

[Music]

was in the rocket well in it is generous

great and give you a

N I was going to say I

want well there we go

I hope the stream everything's

working is struggling as

usual I'm

back

excellent yeah OBS is not having a good

day it's it's either OBS or it's twitch

because if you got my chat messages my

internet is working fine well you could

argue that twitch is working fine but

maybe not streaming to Twitch I don't

know what's going

on oh come on you it up pick it up

Spyro be a good

Dragon OBS really don't want you to

stream today apparently

not that's a rude software get connected

twice

and then I don't know how to spell

reconnecting by the

way it said that my spelling was

wrong SP shouldn't be eating fireworks

he he just putting them in his mouth but

to be fair you shouldn't put fireworks

even though this this doesn't even look

like firework you shouldn't put a

firework in your

mouth that does seem like a bad idea

this is a bright

room another one oh we got a rock here

good but it was a strong

explosion what

no the IPS you spell reconnecting

correctly reconnect

correctly Recon correct

me sorry I'm trying to make a p

without come on why did I take damage

what's confused

me oh

Sho I I didn't expect it come from that

way I expecting come from the other way

around

rescue the eggs SP you just don't

understand if we don't bring dragons

back to this world soon all our magic

will be lost the dragons used to live

here yes this was their original home

but a long long time ago the Sorceress

banished them to the other side of the

world she didn't realize the dragons

were the source of all our

magic maybe I could convince the dragons

to come back if you let me

go I'm sorry I

can't if let me

go wink

wink

I'm sure getting a lot of messes at

moment I have to check that when I'm

done cuz I don't have much left to

do who repair the

one oh look oh a naked W

thing I got eaten oh look an egg

[Music]

Jonah wow

nice get me out of

[Music]

difference the amazing inside of the

W but people really no I didn't want to

enter I didn't want to

enter

uh yeah here we go here's some

t

paid points

towards it's not amazing amount of

points I guess but this is the 2 half

thousand

so welcome to Frozen alar Spyro on

behalf of the ice fairies I want to

Grant you a special power for as long as

you stay in our

world she's very

blue and then she stands there and then

she

disappears and the funny thing is they

have even included that detail in

raining

I don't know

why why that detail was so important to

replicate look I have a

laser I left

[Music]

some they explode like

balloons since this this thing just melt

it does

not

um explode like it doesn't Rite it

change you can actually PL went straight

through you can just leave like

reason

stand

[Music]

on I got I got it what do you say now

I don't know why but I feel really

cold yeah the point is you're supposed

F I didn't even enter

Port let's go battle that boss

now I want I want to go behind it okay

no

go do the

[Music]

B so you see the

like in this portal you see the levels

back because at least in the first game

before it started fing into

black it had a seamless transition where

you saw the background and then the like

level showed up with the same background

it was very neat ah

flame but um the exit port on is also

used in the level's background so it's

seamlessly work Spyro and boldly go

where no dragon has gone before four

well at least not in a thousand years at

any

rate course this peach by the way just

not like

Peach let's see how many attempts it

will take wait did I have full health I

think I had full health well if I don't

have full health I will kill myself wait

didn't we s this no

wait that's it not headed up I'm going

to create a mon to all

monsters and I'm going to send it out to

destroy all the dragons even the little

hatchlings yes yes it will smash them

and crush them them SM yes smear them

and smoosh them and crack them and

crease them but uh won't that kill

them it doesn't matter as long as I can

still collect their

wings wings all this time you've only

wanted them for their wings of course

you ignorant girl I need them for a

spell so I can live

forever that rocket ship now yes not

exactly it's a rocket ship drag is

rocket there's a rocket

ship you said just keeping them in our

world was enough you never said you had

to kill them I don't have to kill them

it just stops them from wriggling so so

much you're terrible I can't believe I

ever listened to

you point the rests I'll take care of

her as soon as I finish off that dragon

now where was I ah

yes

Triangular boobs of L cross in the first

team right

that

Bianca anyway let's see if I have full

health and then I'll do it otherwise

I'll S I got full health good this might

be our last stand

Spyro plans to use this monster to

destroy every iota of her opposition

beginning with the two of us alas there

is no time for ruminating a battle

awaits us I will endeavor to assist you

by means of a steady provision of

combustible

projectiles I don't think they're

combustible but I oh yeah
