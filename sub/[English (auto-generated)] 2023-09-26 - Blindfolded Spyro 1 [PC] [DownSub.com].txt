well too late now so let's see if we can
enter
uh okay I
[Music]
hear this should be stereo wait the
headphones are
broken going I'm going to
be
one one
there may this my
Tero I should have non broken headphones
I forgot that my headphones are broken
so they can actually not play in serious
I can actually not locate things with
my so that's the was oversight of
mine
so I'm going
to wait
wait you're not car
Swedish
broken headphones yeah when did your
headphones break it was actually a while
ago I am close to the
port yeah I did it I was close to portal
I just didn't know how
close so now we only have S mon
exactly I wish that wasn't the case
but but I said I'm willing to play like
the game in Swedish and do like explain
how Swedish works and word meanss and
stuff hope there is no cheating going on
here no there isn't you saw I was
playing it was
terrible so this is Stone H right see if
I just run forward there we
go and
then that's a
[Music]
one it's still a
one on
[Music]
funny where is okay I'm
confusing that was was annoying
okay yeah
so that's why I wanted the where am
I I should have like
seen getting some
gems I could
only
know I am yeah I wasn't I wasn't sure
how terrible this was going to be but
this is going
[Music]
terribly have no idea where that
[Music]
am I'm here
walking here
[Music]
dragon and
here h
I hear
[Music]
something yeah I don't know oh there we
go
finally which which dragon is this after
you've freed all the dragons it's the
one the fancy Vortex thing it'll take
you back to The Artisan home but first
let me okay let's keep this Dragon
but where is the
there we
go and that's the extra
[Music]
life I might need some extra life here
[Music]
so actually you want V HS I warmer
colder I might need
that actually actually at this point I
might not even need veings I mean I
might need actually prop
instructions look God yeah it it's
impossible it would be a bit easier if I
didn't have you know broken headphones I
hav the thing is I haven't really s
about the broken because I haven't
really needed to use the stereo you can
do
that's those walls are get appro same
don't
[Music]
what basically need to use the dash or
rush to see where the walls
are there we go that's up that's
something what you say the word if you
want the H I'll assume not something
it's
yeah yes I stand that
um
[Music]
so
yeah let's
pause I don't know what else I can do in
this level I wish I
could that's another I'm actually
picking stuff up I'm actually surprised
that
went
come
on where am
I I might need some help to where
am as far as I know I'm am am I am
inside the building between the start
and the uh the goal the exit
Vortex and I'm trying your going s the x
is still left
you think okay I
might is it back exit back to start or
exit to the
go I can't see right oh all right I
should probably enable the map should I
en the map to
know I wonder what comp in the
one he X his ex rest of L not the EXP
okay
oh behind you now okay there's there is
a wait map is the map
enabled she can't see that wasn't behind
me can't see what are you thinking
Panda no my ears I can still feel my
ears you know even if I'm blind at the
moment
where am I now I guess another
wall no map okay I said I can enable the
map if you do you want should I enable
the
map so you can like tell where I'm
facing Somewhere In level and then we
try to basically work
together this is rotating camera because
the game is still
acting
come on there we go I'm trying
to no bad Panda no
Shing you don't know how sorry I that
see
message is L this much you don't know
how to play
though
uh
I should have load the graphic settings
I
think I would have but I am watching
people struggle at games that's probf
fine why does he came having so much in
moment
okay
so
I should be able to enable the
map there we
go that's the map
right yes okay now the map should appear
at some point when it is loaded
[Music]
now
good R careful it's full of skunk stink
don't ask how I got hit I have my soures
oh I have a sun seed
okay map is loaded wa you talk passive
camera I mean maybe that's good
too wait did I talk the passive camera
or did I open the map or did I do
both but I see my boths but it's fine I
can use passive camera that might might
be better for this kind of
mode oh yeah
[Music]
okay I'm guess I
won so I do
that here we go not going around I
[Music]
think
so let's see H I should I should uh try
to pick up the key how about
that so I should I should go towards the
exits towards the
vortex so which way should I
go crash three whenever you find this
[Music]
boring okay that was camera
again I keep forgetting that I wish the
most wasn't that good set yeah I
think why is it lagging so
much I wanted to
uh the quality of the stream just so it
can run a bit bad
sorry we distractive okay I understand
well if you go for you the rest of the
level
okay for not right
okay
[Music]
forward but I'm still against get the
one more right left one left now now
confusing what to
[Music]
say right yeah this a different right
[Music]
left I every on say right he's say
left turn left okay now it's
left
left
okay I hope I man
[Music]
next okay this is
impossible yeah I don't think this
works got a camera left okay like
[Music]
this I'm so lost I haven't se the
reaction G this B since I used my
you know what and let's leave this level
by the way wa how many options down for
exit
lemon you got on the corner exit to the
left I'll go away for five minutes and
come back to walk simulator one
option
okay that's um I got
stuck
let's find a better
level
two why are you lying to me
J I can hear that this is the correct
option
[Music]
so and don't ask prodctions I uh I
noticed
[Music]
that I'm going
somewhere
I'm I fell in
water wait is
this okay okay okay okay okay
okay I I'm not going to be able to open
the
portal but I
found this is uh this
is
oh this is outside this sun
FL I should be

[Music]
again running
around got
something everything you know like is
why right is left apparently right is

here
Dragon the
one turn around for Dragon okay okay if
I look okay where's the
dragon is it in me or is it
like outside view not fun like watching
p in
right like this
direction
or is more
right turn
right did I turn
right yeah forward for
Dragon
[Music]
camera should be align
with turn turn right that I wish you
could be more specific like in which if
like I mean that rock is interesting got
to turn didn't care I went left again
wait how did turn
left
[Music]
don't like
this I think it should be more specific
with how many degrees right I me like
talking 90° to the right or like no like
3:00 have go for
okay not
[Music]
next okay where's the dragon now then
okay stop I stop I
[Music]
sto turn
around thank you for this hello Rion yes
you're doing a very silly stream here
where I'm basically going blind and
following some much's direction in chat
I hear the dragon jump wait jump I can
jump doesn't help
[Music]
much jump forward this wa
what why would I jump forward but
I did I got to
the this is interesting I even fun to
watch back
[Music]
watch was that a
0 turn or was that too
little because got sometimes trying to
move I it's amazing wait with the
uh the uh my my
PNG
[Music]
uhuh
[Music]
uh-huh I
hear oh oh oh
stop went too far for it I hear the
dragon
wait
fell off the
ramp
again wait which ramp are we going
because the only oh where am
I the only thing I know about ramp to
get to a dragon that one I collected
right
[Music]
away okay like
that now you said
[Music]
hey Spyro press the jump button twice to
Glide and and don't be afraid afraid of
what here falling from high mountain
peaks plummeting into
got okay thank you for the
help
okay so now I should be facing towards
the I see now I see which ramp you're
talking about now I should be facing
towards the gate opening
[Music]
right where am I
going seem to be able to run
far okay that did not work as
planned
[Music]
what we're talking
about big opening with this what
inside you were charge down after the r
yes yes I was going to
[Music]
work okay okay okay where's R now
[Music]
next so like
here
[Music]
here
wish I could reach like the dragon
platform
second yeah
[Music]
many
[Music]
pafic
okay this
[Music]
isn't okay I'm on the ramp now
[Music]
right so is the that case
the
um yes I'm there perfect
perect facing towards the uh gate open
[Music]
now I
wonder like this oh
oh okay okay okay I'm I'm close now so I
can't actually activate the uh because
I'm not close enough to the platform to
activate the menu but I can't zoom in on
the camera
anymore am very close to the dragon
platform at the
moment this is so
[Music]
[ __ ] so now I Cann and mov away from
the from the pl platform from the
dragon where
that come
here where left wait wait am I leaving
therea but I want
no I wanted to do Vortex I wanted to cut
down Square this is the wrong way in
that
[Music]
case why I wanted to
[Music]
go
yeah
how no I'm not at the balloon am
I I need to the wrong door wait Rocket
Man are you sure I'm at the balloonist
then I'm mean yeah I'm in a tunnel right
now I can hear that from The
Sound how did I really go across the
whole level from from from Stone Hill
all the way down to
[Music]
balloon I consider you wrong but I'm
surprised I didn't know I was there
[Music]
wait wait no no
what that was a
dragon right wasn't that the dragon
platform I'm at at the
moment no what's this I'm us
now wait what's
what's I think
something have the map where am I on the
map wait I don't even know which
direction map this
is standing against that
one okay now I'm
not maybe I am at the
bu a lay on chest now yeah I assume
so I can't go to the balloon is yet
because I only got like three dragons I
need more
first my are
on yeah so I need I can't be at balloon
yet but how is this 20 second
[Music]
delay yeah it probably adds up because
the whole stream too
much yeah I don't think I don't think
this is a great way of doing
[Music]
this cool flash do that again The
Artisan's boss is through a portal in
the dragon so I got
here
yeah just just send a check
message and then see how
[Music]
long oh yeah the game is
laggy when I've been going for this game
for like a half hour now
so yeah I don't think I will do this if
I had like a computer that doesn't lag
and cause a massive delay on the stream
and this this challenge could actually
work and also steer headphones test
message so how about should we give up
on this channel for now and move on to
crash 3 instead because that in that
case I will actually see what I'm
[Music]
doing does that sound good
15 seconds
L yeah the delay has probably added on
works for me
okay I'm moving the
camera sounds like a plan
good let's uh bring up the screen
again oh wait I managed to get up on
the on the this again
I I I guess I haven't realized how far
how quickly you move across the map yeah
if I do a bit more practice and get more
used to how how how SPID moves and
everything okay it's lagging massively
at the
[Music]
moment so yeah that's quick
game f it's lagging so bad at the
moment
okay there we
go we're all all about to lose our minds
trying to guide you where your friend
didn't want to go why so much lag today
did smoo yeah it's probably because I
was trying to run the game I usually
play PS1 games lately and that game just
just caused massive
delays
so so I guess we'll
uh move on to crash three instead
then I just restart the
stream
uh crash three no
powerups let's
see what crash War this is also
called run anything in the backr no
really where I said I'm usually playing
like Playstation One game em it now
now wait what did it reset to
fire
worked there we
go so you're playing insane C or OG no
it will be insane because that's where
you can utilize this glitch okay let me
just restart the stream and fix the
delay uh if you don't see the stream
come back just uh fresh let's
let's
