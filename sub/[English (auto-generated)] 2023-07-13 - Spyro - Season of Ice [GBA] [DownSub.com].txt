now now it just turns microphone I'm not
sure what why that was weird
now I hope you can hear me
who will come water I still have year
round
I'm still missing oh yeah yeah I didn't
get any last
uh thing to pick up in the spring home
because I accidentally entered the Roman
City
I started doing some workout film thing
that's fine
because I'm here
I hope I can entertain you
while you do new work
the drama city is so far the only one I
have entered so far it's so poor
on this menu
I got 11
limes okay so back to this one I should
pick up the last
Berry
which I will be able to by finding these
flowers which I should kill
I I go and visit this spring fairy
Homeworld and then I just come here and
killed it
flowers
because apparently
that will release a fairy
I have no idea how this works
thank you
what the logic between burning flowers
and recipes
[Music]
and it means
steal that part off
okay
oh they got another
I mean it's been now three of them
foreign
it's never too late
that's the romacita accidentally ended
you're correct
they lost track of many I've counted so
far anyway
yeah if if the if the view can just look
a bit more ahead of sprayer
this game would be a little easier
they were facing this direction up
doesn't need to be maybe but only this
amount it could be this amount instead
of time
I'm gonna turn this it can just beat
here
it it would just be better
that's like one
five
I don't know if it's been fine but
that's my guess
my guess would be like a
six
no bunnies
foreign
[Music]
maybe that was seven or eight
if it doesn't it has been
thanks firewood
that's right thanks Maya I never thought
anyone would find me
performance
oh
it doesn't have it
I see
it only has one palette loaded for a
fairy
and when you have two face on screen
it's prioritizing one already
but for some that's my white guess here
but for some reason
despite it just the face the first look
identical just that they have different
colors so I would assume that they would
be the identical Sprites with two
different palettes so when they are
using the wrong palette they will look
identical to each other apparently not
I didn't expect it
because I don't think anywhere in the
game there are two things that goes
together I didn't want it to challenge
it again
uh well I will count to eight things
I am done with this place
[Music]
that's the second time I accidentally
entered Roman City
I'm back at the start of the home runs
wait a minute
if I'm not mistaken a river
I mean I really splitting like this
isn't
making sense right River splits the
river marriage is not splits right
well you could probably have a situation
in order to speed
as I mean there are cases where in which
these splits when you have an island and
they love it
you haven't mistaken normally they don't
speak or something I don't know I'm not
even expert
oh is that enough for the arc what age
I'm going to wait with the speedway the
last
okay
oh yeah it was actual age so apparently
this should be a space age or like a
Galaxy age Speedway as well
okay let's go
hi hi hello Elizabeth
do you like the very large emote display
on screen
change the size so it's not too long ago
oh no it's the fireflies from but why
would they have
everything evolved from having
lighthouses with
a
sandals was the one I was looking
forward to actually have an iPhone
why but this isn't the high schools
I don't know we are so glad to see you
my crew and I have been up for the days
trying to get it to Twilight Phillips
turned on in the factory so the workers
can start working
in here
I don't know
I'll do my best
yeah nothing that is big
up
yeah
it's the
it's a 720 stream
and the email is this balance for
112 size so these are my yeah
the eight of those there's one
oh
that's one
but I need to get eight without dying
so let's continue here
I prefer
not being separate platforms due to the
nature of the game but
oh well because you have to can I even
get there
with my kids
yeah all right it's practice
unbox with light motion
what does this mean three
what's that okay
the presumably I go up on this thing and
fly away
see how that feels
enemy
about his Swedish word biende
after doing that
boy I think
so from on top of this
maybe not so far south
I'm going to call the directions
there we go
each shirt was cold in there thanks
so what should I do with this
thank you for following Elizabeth
[Music]
okay Amazon I'm sure one night is turned
on now
more things to count to
and
there's something there
it's quite far away
and I reach that no that's a platform
that I can't finish
a bit too far away I might need to go
around
wasn't from here yes
let me see nice things
let's go the other way
oh my
I guess quite high up here but
I don't see any way I can find it
oh I haven't been here
[Music]
so let's explore this
[Music]
you can
in 18 years fly
can I fly over there
yes
oh
doing that I told you this time
ah
that's it all inside with with a welcome
thank you the only message okay
depending ones oh
[Music]
that's the place I haven't been to yet
no
I'm supposed to get back now
[Music]
this is
foreign
I'll try
okay there you go I did it
you're such a good dragon
yeah but it's a good Dragon not that bad
dragon
[Music]
oh
you can see
why is this fine
and I don't know how many enemies there
are there's an extra life
six I think
I'm gonna strike
another thing
purple is my favorite color but you're
dressed in all blue
your skin is blue even though it isn't
shouldn't be what's the picture isn't
blue blue wings blue dress blue hair
hey
you're welcome foreign
I went for me
another spider Adventure
nope stop doing that
and take damage there's a lot of sheep
in this lemon
oh there's a key that I need to bring
on the way home
another night
[Music]
and more nights but this is the top of
11. by the top of the world I was doing
enough mirror for my mom
she's babysitting and need me to wash
the kids once she went to the store I
think
so kind of you to have bones
no
one
that means I have
a hero of those spinny things now
foreign
dragon
is that one well it's a place of 11 I
haven't been to yet this is the age of
11.
the lights are still on
I've been up here no I haven't
been there I assumably Last Enemy
got more
foreign
what do I have to lose
[Music]
and being two there's the key again
we should bring the keyhole
have that done
oh I haven't been there
how do I get there that's the question
okay let's see
presumably up there
don't be inside let's just
get back home
my resume
start
and unlock that chest
no it was not here
okay this was not a place to go to
where did I find that place again
thank you
again
[Music]
if I have been there
I didn't expect something again
okay this is the start
um
this place has the same easy as the
coming back for this level oh yeah so
we're going to have
the same music on the long
jumpy to these levels
keeps dying It's like because it's so
hard and heavy this is the place I think
I'd have invented about me
next time
it's confusing no it keeps confusing
[Music]
but my goal is to complete it this game
can't beat me
I can beat it
where's the key
now I just need to find my way back home
but going back
so tricky
I always always managed to hit the one
not the platform I need to go to
and you'll complete this game too I
think you can
I I'm making good progress I need to
stop making same mistakes
but yeah I really I just remember that
it's the
it's a nice response she said with weird
things for the game to do
did you find two extra lives close
together
but like close to the start
you could die and recollect us an
infinite amount of time
that's what I wanted
so
here
where was she supposed to go easy lives
yeah
it's annoying with these levels there's
so much on screen
foreign
levels around not being able to see
where you're going
nice
[Music]
either I often be
guessed already so this this one place
in the level I've not been here
this should be uh
one
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
okay
where is the card on this one
one
that was the Run button that was not the
look button
foreign
let me pick
another design I guess but it's fine
like this design as it's cute and I like
it keep
s oh there's a place that I've been to
okay let's go there
and that's another thing I'm not
dressing yet that's a nice thing yeah
yeah right that wasn't that was the
wrong expression uh yes
I do think so myself
okay seriously now I just keep sleeping
off the 11.
oh
all right
make a mistake after a steak
okay that was almost not making it
okay how do you define an enemy
no but there's one
that's a piece of land there
and also around here
that's the ferry
[Music]
what the hell for Dragon
makes this actually say stuff
let's see some face
it's not The Last Enemy
but am I
see this might be the last Light
yes
when I was smile it's Arlo thanks now
that the factory is only off the workers
can start getting ready for the holiday
Rush
and I can go home and get some sleep
those late nights have turned me into an
insomniac
we've already writes Insomniac with a
capital letter
you rescued Elizabeth
's important
69 face
you're refreshing someone again
uh there we go oh I got five left and
then there's all those
things
spinny things I need
that's right
okay
so let's let's do this
I think this should be eight spinner
things
so one
sometimes
and
it's about to see you
one
thing
against the last one
and uh
hiding
hand size
[Music]
foreign
okay go go yeah let's see if I can get
rest
that's probably the spider can
that this is how far I can see
that's basically our first time you can
fly
do I go up
like this now I can probably fly further
and I can see they can see like the
lights
there
can definitely fly far further
but what I can see
that's really not helpful
let's get my house back let's do
three
[Music]
I'm gonna see if I can find
more four
need lights
it's a four that's halfway and there's
another one let's see if I can get to it
they're here
nope
okay nope
so
let's make this side maybe it's easy
from here
definitely
[Music]
not
now
I
foreign
almost
yeah got that one
one way
I don't know if it's eight
you can see that one
where were you looking hmm
foreign
can you hear me now
knock that to bunny that's for sure
obviously
yeah the bun is not distracting
maybe that's why I'm making so many
mistakes
how am I supposed to get from here
and I can't get there but it's not help
me now I'm just back here
ah
I don't find my way back
oh here we go
foreign
definitely very confusing
I got that oh there it is eight
yeah
I kind of name is that thank you spider
I was afraid no one would find me inside
that
machine
and what
but I think this level is done now it is
but I can now exit 11.
yay
100
and I think I have
[Music]
a country draw so many
gems on screen at the same time or
something that tread okay let me
attention
so
yeah seven thousand I got 4 500 moment
yeah it says that you can say thousand
five hundred that's because I paid 1 000
in total to Moneybags
so
which one lives they have I suggests
falling out of space back because he's a
piggy bank yeah
because the Sparks level the speedway
and time machines are Aqua age what's
the name of it
so I just need to find the time machine
this is okay
something
stand up it's very loud
that would be fun
The Voice like

where I can
I'm constructing my new time machine
just when I was getting ready to make my
final adjustments still trying to show
that at the auto shop perhaps someone
enters a time machine and they just
appeared here from the past please see
what you can do about them
but you're not going to talk about
oh
metal opponents nice
the first opponent you have to charge
foreign
you have a time machine
nice
like two kind of scenes
look at this level are funny
[Music]
nice
it's a little machine I used to keep
track of passage of time I call it a
clutch
but is it a machine
it's a cocktail machine
I'm not saying it is
mechanical machine okay
oh
I'm tired
I may be a winter fairy

if I just do the video
Okay click the button too early
again
yes we don't knock me down after I get
done yeah

the sad one to still working
[Music]
oh
I press through that button too many
times
okay
you can forgetting I can't explain this
which I can play in every single other
at me in the game
[Music]
okay here's one
I don't remember
mm-hmm
I think pencils usually left member
I don't know maybe you do have um E flat
English

check that oh they had eyelash a few
years ago in harmony
but it is starting to melt let's melt it
cemented illness his glasses
what's the
got to keep you key
this is importance
is this place
just fine because
then I can do this thing again the
preface is now in a stable time here

go oh yes it's a stable timing
it's not gonna kill
next
[Music]
oh Cookie yeah it's it was cold in there
thanks for taking the chill off spider
wow wow wow
that was a massive nice bite
all of a sudden I've never been here
it is a platform there
thank you
I don't let's do this again
went to Hannah Marsh to find his hair
because he gets definitely like this by
our health and find his Tire Machines
making his practice Yeah
oh I didn't
I haven't really paid attention to the
door of this game this should we make it
that can pay attention to the normal
foreign
s are so annoying
let's see where I can go
but check here I see this platform can I
go to it I have no idea
should I go there I have no idea because
I don't even see myself
oh there it is
anymore at least
anytime study
starting more
11 more
[Music]
yay
they wore off the keys over
and I I need to get up there somehow
how
how am I supposed to get up next
I mean I can't climb up the teeth can I
so I need to find a small platform
somewhere to fly over there
like this one yeah it's only this one
this one is pretty high up
nope
not high enough
and then I have to start over start over
I I got the wrong solution
and therefore I have to start all over
again with writing and ALDI fancy stuff
I mean set 11 is
but like how do I know
did I just do it wrong or something
I think it changed my life back
yeah I mean doing it wrong
I'm not inspired now I can work in peace
I'll tell you a little secret if this
time machine works correctly I'll be
able to go back and find some of the
hair I lost I guess I might need this
bottle of hat on again there's nothing
in here
be an easy way to see height difference
yeah
definitely
nine more gems
buying more examples is like a prime
somewhere that I mean
I thought I need to get all the pencil
heads too
there it is
that was lucky now you just need to get
all the pencils
let's count them one
and let me know if I count them around
[Music]
and then as you go up here because here
I've got more of them
I mean what's with the line
is that one in Japanese
realize it might be
two
three
it's a Japanese one

way okay in that case I don't need to
worry yes please

then
yeah hi hello welcome rocket man
how's it going with yes
maybe I'm supposed to go there from this
place
am I wrong I have to start all over
external important
and fine
as I heard the next game season of lame
is better because I improved a lot of
things a lot of the mistakes I learned
from making this game
I'll wait to be done with this game
[Music]
there's there's another one
[Music]
person you'll be fine yes
I apologize for not showing up she lost
tea I was working there I don't know
if you are not allowed to technology no
I did not know if you're busy you're
busy
I've been able to show up to every
stream you might
it's only fake
feel any pressure okay this place
five seconds
seven now one more
time already
I can only be the one on the rabbit yeah
see I mean it should be seven now right
no pain
yeah I'm sure I got it
all right let's see if I find another
one
this this is the start of thing where I
stick to quite a while to explain the
first one
let's
store this area
that's the sound they make
what does the rabbit say whoop whoop
and
afterwards discussions
yeah exactly huge dream anyway
I don't think it's melting I think it's
burning
where is it
where's the last time
awesome
my name is my status drawing of business
back here now it was a drawing of his
time machine
this is now
this is just this platform
Champion chip washer
feels like I've gone in a circle now
so this is
apparent pencil
so
like
where hands
am I not in yet
at least
I guess I need to check it's more like
intern 9 11.
foreign
so
now
a bit confused at the moment
s
oh there it is
[Music]
found it
wow spiral
so every level in this regular level in
this world done only two more
money Banks I have to pay
and then I need to get the money back
for money bags I want to take them to do
that
[Music]
inspired two Hunters takes their money
from money bags
inspired 3 spider attacks money back
with the money back suggests selling
a dragon egg
in the
spinal and the design flyer I don't know
because I can keep kept on crashing
or playing Germany
ah Spyro I see Sparks is back for
another venture into a bug too
previous success was almost impressive
but of course there must be a sensible
exchange of change to make this
profitable
Char 800. all those gems going up from
your pocket to mine is pure music too
much
money bags
spark 7 Speedway yep
beautiful Speedway
huh
[Music]
[Music]
definitely
the same thing diagonal
because
you take extra house that sounds good
looking
what time is behind me
hello
[Music]
okay moving along
19.
foreign
like why they have the place one where
is this phone that's not fair
foreign
[Music]
man
nice
to take out
another
[Music]
Okay so
yeah
[Music]
thank you stories
the coaching these foreign
yeah
are you considering the size difference
drinking
[Music]
nice too
The Green Door chocolate
where's the magenta key
oh yeah this is the one that generates
the shoes
I'm gonna destroy it
thank you
thank you
you see that stupid thing should be gone
thank you thank you sorry
900
green tea
again
[Music]
thank you
oh it's 100
what's this rest on his known
[Music]
that was beautiful or something
now
that's my green power
[Music]
but that's something
[Music]
well get away from me
stop being literally on top of me
finally here is easy rock scene
is that that sounds sense that's um
okay
[Music]
yeah I'm not the fan of the power up
system in spark levels you can lose
everything but do you like how you can
stack it but I don't like how you can't
stack in multiple different types
word and don't have a choice if you want
to replace it
foreign
which can be tricky sometimes
Speedway
is going to be fun
please it's going to be the most fun of
One
[Music]
this is
uh
yep nothing different
first is
and the whole thing you don't get your
second when you pick up a gem
you know the gems or replacing the plus
one seconds wait how did I get the Gem
but not too ring how does that make
sense
[Music]
[Music]
you can't pick up gems if I do damage or
something
thank you
I'm gonna say they give you a lot of
time this is the normal
this is the bus already
is this just a mini bus
es oh that's going to be fun
the regular bus inside
this this is a mini persistence
now
well I got some of the gems
ain't that inspired their balloons
especially and stop being hurt by
buddies they popped on him and scares
him he's he's definitely scary cat
okay
[Music]
plus one now
[Music]
openings
[Music]
hello
come on no
I guess such is the time to try to pick
them up
to very low draw distance
[Music]
foreign
miss the shots
and
you know it
hey
this is so annoying it
has so much he has
[Music]
been
put so much time when I was in real boss
and isn't this kind of bus again
and this is that
one second and
you you rescue Joe
wait are these Tibetans
as much as saying that's the last bit
when I ready to joined message
one of the others have children this is
only one versus other two yeah I still
have to redo this because I didn't get
all the
the bubbles
[Music]
yeah this seems to be an easier Speedway
except those yellow fish
[Music]
that's one of them I think it's three
they're missing
family
yeah nothing says one more thing
[Music]
is
like
you didn't leave my hand so much I need
to get up this one please
something okay do you get the plasticity
for the main boss itself
sounds so nice
[Music]
yeah yes
[Music]
come on
and then the boss
y boss gives mines
which doesn't make them more annoying
too 38 seconds left
the last gem
shouldn't be too hard to do this on hard
probably a quite a few of them
flying fish bus but
it doesn't seem it's not long
either
which is nice well that was far away
[Music]
do you have a minimum distance they're
allowed to have been from
now to be fair
[Music]
you know if you're going to randomize
stuff you need to put up some
restriction for how random it can be
so it's still within a reasonable
fairness
[Music]
thank you
oh come on
yeah that's so quickly no
the question is for the red one had
taken more than one second to disappear
because in that case I saved time but
running into other it would be better to
shoot it but
it's ready to run into it then nothing
more than one second
attached to this boss
yeah it's one
piece of it disappears
that is starting to move erratically
and Tennis it's so quick
it's avoiding come on
this is a cheating
I did it I did
oh that was so close
and I didn't want right there
this was moving so quick there
I believe it I'm amazed that I did that
in one try
I did feel easier and it was definitely
easier
even though the game tries to cheater at
the end
I need to move away from the portal
because before I can bring this up so
that's everything
every very Mesquite
nice more expire everything is good
enough fairies to help me fix the portal
a handbag that's why I'm still not
standing back
I think I know where my Spellbook might
be after
after I find it I'll meet you in the
next fairy home oh another one
summer very home because
thank you Damien
admissible excuse for the dragons
ruining my plans
and just headache she tried me made
you see the red one
when I finish with those fairies I get
rid of this extra head I'll find that
incompetently do socialist Bianca but
make her telling me what went wrong
which is this crazy SpongeBob face I
think I think I know what a spider bug
is
it was something along those lines
let me take away perfect and also I want
to play playing a very soon anyways
not static Speedway was that annoying as
last one but
a short day
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
me
I don't know if I'm doing a different
voice it's not like I keep any of the
other characters consistent
foreign
[Music]
but if I split up body in multiple parts
and
[Music]
yes
a nice time oh yeah because
everyone watching around with one piece
swimsuits in the summer
maybe I should
and anyway and then I do the different
body parts and of course and then I do
the difficult parts
for the different outfits as well so
and then it will just swap out all the
body parts
or the both parts of a difference it's
easy
[Music]

on top of this basket but
oh like but it's the shadow that looks
like sorry and oh yeah I can't I can do
that
make me a sneak peek at 11 Dusty trains
Star Park there's nothing level oh it's

how I did
[Music]

I wonder if it's like different object
or something
oh hello Bianca but I was looking for a
granddaughter's one what a good find it
I did find my spell books though but it
doesn't look like it will have you'll
need to find all 99 fairies before I can
access enough magic to open this
portable I think it would take you took
render oh yeah that's what they did
on Paris
you basically have to almost completely
game 100 there is 100 because it gets
the last family at grander's place

very happy and then
friends

been doing

time because otherwise you won't get
berries
[Music]
that is nothing
is
a stand on himself but he already upside
down and something went terribly wrong
whatever it was it made him really angry
yeah
yeah me I think
that's what I had a lot to say
sure you don't need all the exams but
you'll get all the gems anyway yes
getting out of here no I mean I could
have just left some gems behind
underneath
I don't get a fan for collecting your
gym so

the started I want to know
game

option for that

[Music]
like another one here
[Music]
pretty good surprise
[Music]
this is the boss fight
[Music]
again
[Music]
there's some cats
[Music]
yep
excuse me
[Music]
I guess if you want to think that's
amazing
[Music]
and I go to all the gym is this person
now yes
[Music]
I've made
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay
[Music]
one is the red ones are here
seeking
[Music]
[Music]
now
[Music]
[Music]
armored today's thing
[Music]
ah
fit two stop cheating
I think that like have
no enemies allowed to spawn in a certain
videos you know
if you respawn
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
now you can work the n11 using the
airplane to do the silent level name and
in darkness and press the a button that
exercise with this one
[Music]
I did it
but can I visit unvisited levels
otherwise that that's that's completely
useless
you're ready to try again on who am I to
comment on the foolishness of
dragonflies why would I why would I
continuously even make it
nope I had to visit the level once and
since I completed 1100 after visiting
them once this function is completely
useless
[Music]
okay where is that lemon
[Music]
earlier though
no I mean
it the point of that is just to have
like a
finishing up again finalize the gems and
friends it's not always been completely
useless for me because you still have to
find the Portal at least once
[Music]
that's important
what is this button
not secret portal is supposed to say
what foreign it is
ah
so this is the dusty trains it doesn't
tell me
[Music]
okay one
oh look
it's a skunk
nerve skip every spiral I am very glad
you see yeah a whole king of Outlaw
rhinox wrote it found just a bit ago and
they've been downright ordinary how
about getting done
foreign
if you'd give me a hand with these
rhinites sorry I don't have hands
[Music]
okay
[Music]
this is the top of the diamond
it's not consistency
[Music]
for that stuff see you
guns
[Music]
oh I got that I don't think that's how
it's supposed to be second
[Music]
and I can jump
yeah I don't think when you do the flame
attack it doesn't really take any kind
of heights
[Music]
it does try to block me from doing it
but if you can't make the animation
happen
I guess
it does in that case
name
because the whole game runs in TV
there's no height to it
[Music]
what kind of no hand kind of height
is trying to find out three or three
haven't even found the chest
[Music]
another one of these
attracts
this is like a useless track yeah
boy
[Music]
stop doing that
all of you
[Music]
fine
[Music]
thank you
I see
I think my house
[Music]
oh
being a gym was from the animation
before
[Music]
if that's disrespective start
[Music]
Ed on these guys then
thank you
[Music]
again
[Music]
next time you see a rhino spider give
him a good plane on the butt for me
[Music]
um
oh
[Music]
thanks
yeah I like Lambs like this there's a
lot of jumping but
platforms are much larger
[Music]
there yeah I flamed this but
[Music]
where is the lock chest
I think there
[Music]
but it's probably not a race platform
this is that the left edge of the game
11.
I don't see anything down here
is that but how do you know it's not a
race platform
[Music]
that's the scene
now there is a race platform that I can
see
how do I get down there
seeing the way to get out I could just
guess
but is there a way for me to get down
there
we're talking
[Music]
here we go
[Music]
down here without kissing
[Music]
around again
[Music]
thank you
[Applause]
okay here's a platform

somewhere
anime
there's Sparks locator ability that's

beat Wayne
the most
loved Speedway of the Moon
Speedway
you know Speedway or
not a stupid one
hmm
[Music]
I'm going to just speak you don't speak
to them if you're running because that's
a nice feature
what's up here yes
again it doesn't tell me about their
names
it has became broken
I don't hear this the most difficult
level but I know you'll finish that
movie I I ain't nothing to you
oh no
I don't know
thank you

so they haven't covered up in something
like this yeah we get hit once this game
only
staying away from me

excuse me
oh he's another one
oh my they're everywhere
and that's these small things have
no no nothing
crap
you can really see which one is supposed
to give me James
there's a snipe
distance well
you still have to keep it from all that
otherwise have to wait
[Music]
[Music]
huh
good
morning
doesn't stand out so when
there was another snitch
foreign
[Music]
two years these are so hard
and I'm really all over the place
names
okay I guess they're doing two Loops it
just makes it confusing versus two years
now
what sound that looks like they had gems
yeah the haircut it's three different
Reds awareness again then so I'd like to
see you
because there's certain inserts the ones
giving you chance was supposed to be
playing
[Music]
okay
once more
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
but
I got I'm not going to sound good
association with this animation
that means everyone again
another
[Music]
[Music]
okay
[Music]
another team
but still not the one with James
they had completed
anyway
it was something
anything yet
[Music]
[Music]
you can get a lot of time though
that's actually very open
for the time against actually shoot
itself
it's not often
thank you
hang up
okay
Mustard Seed mustard seed
that doesn't sound like a nice frame
name
one or two left gems to pick up
and there we go
it's one of them
in little ways
I'm gonna arrange my shorts
in this less time to react to again
experience
ah come on
[Music]
that one of those
that again miss one of the gems
okay so it's one of those I think he
hasn't passed January
it was that great Spanish thing
[Music]
please
I'm not cheating anything
wow wow wow take it easy
doesn't matter
I still gets the gem and that's what's
important
notice I just I just need that last DM
sorry because I don't have to check
then it must be one of those nine things
okay
no love to save me yeah they are very
similarly
then there are like orange and brown
these are brown Orange
and I'm gonna paint
there it is
[Music]
easy
thank you
foreign
Mustard Seed and now she did a hard one
let's see how much time I get one minute
an extension with the yellow ones I
think
well now they come
thank you
um
oh come on
come on
oh
no not that one let's make that one
comes as a surprise and then
nice right
[Music]
here
yeah
this is probably one of those that I
just can't thank me and I always did you
[Music]
okay
the question is
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
you have to do that because that's the
last fight I got everything that's not
many
I got everything
that one
can pack meow meow
everything except that one
it went
[Music]
and of course not sound
is whoever this phone is
thank you
thank you friends nice
this is
this is so hard
I feel like I think one chance to get
them and then they move in front
and then I craft Captain anymore and
then start to take basically attacking
like I'm reducing more time on this than
I
think okay
[Music]
[Music]
like
it's hard to determine when when I need
to move out of the week
I take some time off next week makes me
laugh
before I can notice after next week
yeah that sounds good yeah you probably
wish it
take
rest if you're going to work very hard
and I'm just being like this level is
particularly
um
what you have to do
just seems to for some reason
just
this section is what weighs the most
amount of time
because yeah
thank you
because you have to shoot these small
ones so many times and then even one
second from
maybe there was us after 50 seconds
before this
make sure we use three seconds really
but I was like a 50 seconds if I started
that segment
and then I was down
when I started this with like 19 seconds
17 seconds because you're using hard
times and again please
[Music]
that's my that's the problem with this
family
getting time
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
and then it's almost like quickly
more nice
things to do any
one
I don't have time to do this now anyway
it's been three hours already
I'll take care of that next time
[Music]
because some people who can help me yeah
I guess that would be for tomorrow
the the whole stream tomorrow would be
eleven
I'm looking forward to that
should we go and visit in yellow
if Finnish streamer
uh who's playing
both of the out of Evie
playing in there
is a Finnish coupling I think
playing cards of llama said
[Music]
and say hello
it's funny I was watching her straw
this morning
before I started streaming
[Music]
otherwise I don't know more more spider
tomorrow and then I hope they finish the
game tomorrow so I don't have to deal
with the game anymore
[Music]
then I'm done with the game
[Music]
so
and let
there's that Speedway then was exactly
the boss should probably be easily
despiteable is the real prosperity
and a bonus yeah I don't know what the
bonus level is this is this dragonfly X
so it's probably not Speedway
and even if it's a Speedway it's
probably
[Music]
trying to fly Speedway in that case and
it should probably be fine
anyway let's let's let's share our hair
on
all right
you're gaming
[Music]
