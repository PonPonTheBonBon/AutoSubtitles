welcome everyone okay so the audio
quality isn't the best in the game I
tried to lower it do let me know if I
should lower it more this problem with
flash games the uh quality isn't the
best L you
name nice to see you
here a fair
[Music]
thingy
let's see maybe it's h yes it's h so
let's
say rabbit we need more crimes well I
guess you could argue I'm doing more
crimes in return fire so
anyway some p p left okay let's start it
will begin with a
very
very whatever it's going to start with
an intro of the game
the humans comes and destroy the forest
and now they have to
seek the paradise and that's that's the
story do the paradise
Meadows is this game titled A
playu I think
so
so wait how do
I Okay click on it I said spected
welcome
toties platform with a Twist oh what's
the twist AR keys well I will use a and
d to move hit the ire W to jump the Keys
open doors but you could have guessed
that
yeah
who Old School flash
platformer
here we
go we's see this game contains
[Music]
some level one
complete top
rank let's move on can I use the
keyboard now yes now now it
works sometimes teamwork is needed to
reach the end if sacrifices have to be
made well it's for the great recuit I
suppose
run against block the fish
D no I can't reach it well I
guess I guess I just have to push this
and oh
no oh no hello
AST zero death yes one death this time
it had to be
[Music]
made it was just a
raccoon his Sparks are Archy if only you
could find something to bridge un
jumpable gaps something stepping stone
like I don't know my brain is the same
so much
chest okay let's
first get the key
where's the
spikes oh is it after
I oh yeah
oops
oh
okay okay this is
I
okay okay no probably have to retry this
LEL everyone is is
[Music]
ding there we
go okay I didn't have let have to let
that
many everyone is
ding well I guess moving on cute it's
cutest
okay sound
is the level itself that provides the
answer I'd explain it but I'm far too
cute to understand physics okay well
this is the one I can touch
for my
bunny can I reach this oh don't
get who
yeah I'm not sure if I can get
more well okay I should be able to get
all four
I I could try to I wish it told me here
what rank I got on every level oh wait
it does I'm blind
no it does tell me it was not this
obvious
don't worry they they die for the great
to Good Love is Like GL water that makes
me ow if you're running low on animals
you can be play Early Liv ear
back yes course like
the oh
no this doesn't
good who
nice nope I
wi that didn't have to
happen sometimes sacrifices has to be
made earlier earlier
what
are
you when moving
on according to this game's manual
where's the manual the flash key you can
press shift to the per
sepu I don't know what that means but it
sounds awesome it sounds really awesome
doesn't
it R run run
[Music]
oh TR wa I made
it doesn't wait how am I supposed
to oh because I'm just supposed to do
this and using the death of this Char
this this little an
well
hey oh I
see
wait there we
go no
[Music]
no
one I guess there's only one way out of
this using the
sword yeah I can feel we get out of
there
without the final one
eh what is glowing glow wait
what what is glow water that makes me go
out no Lava is glow water that makes me
go
out it said you can relay relay earlier
levels are you tired of something
or or did they really write it as relay
earlier
levels oh oh I see I see and the
automatic outfit change is not set up
let
me
[Music]
what yeah R has some
Co L wait the L is not working well
thank you for Ling not sure why because
the B shoting works
then it was really Rous earlier ear lier
okay
uh anyway Let's
uh start that
up and see if it
works I'll let you know when it it's
it's ready so oh wait the restarting
level has no penalty to the players so
if you get stuck and it's bound to
happen at some point well thank you for
the
confidence click
restart uh
okay uh it's uh starting up very
slowly well that was fine oh wait
what so wait what okay let's let's just
start
uhhuh
taada quick as a
fox anyway they outfit redeems should
work
now welcome ear liar and pawn has ear is
it
done wait who here doesn't have ears
before me
ask what you mean was
Quicky did you hear about the elephant
who chased a man riding a bicycle of
course you didn't elephants C TR
bicycles and that's true I did actually
not hear about
that wait a
minute oh so I should reach the red key
to let out the
boulder
see okay I'm apparently not good at
this nope I'm terrible at this cuz I'm
collecting with the with the platform
above there we go this is how you do it
easy and then that one should push out
the
[Music]
key and but
dead
dead at least no bunny has died that
must matter that that's what matters
right well some sacrifices yes has to be
made Hello fixies I need a petting
redeem I do want to make a petting
redeem when I have the 3D model
and I'm going to add pet redeems and
you're going to be able to pet many
places of f
fun many places remember if you run out
of animals completing an ear lier level
with with less deaths will add to your
animal
Aral oh that was silly of me Tred to
jump over it but I
guess but I still need that key so I
guess I should uh
bring out the
sword oh this PL is bit
sleeper no no no
no oh yeah it still works still high
enough they can jump pretty high in
these
animals I'm not sure about this one oh I
can climb
over wait what's the point of this
not sure what the point of that
is oh I can die just once
interesting I
look this game is so quick I can
probably have to prce get a pref
COR says ear Li yes I did see it this
time my feets sure are tired from all
this walking maybe our new home will be
fun be fun of flowers and rainbows yes
it's not full of flowers and rainbow
just fun of flowers and rainbows
wait how am I supposed to get that
key
okay
so well let's try
this there we go now I got some
platforms w oh that was
close now oh it
bounced super raccoon bouncing got
another
raccoon and one unnecessary test
there I could improve
that ah yeah I see you press a to go
back press D to go forward I had to
press left to go back okay let's see I
can I can do this without we just single
that there see it's a bunny now now I
can't
die that didn't happen Okay okay now I
have to kill the
bunny but I got another bunny so it's
okay the bunny is
pink bouncy raccoons yeah is the physics
in this game can be a bit weird but
what's with what's with the
red door
there it is yeah it is something with
the N it's just High full distance
results in
bounds I guess I have to remember that
there we go rank
a
yay there's another
one
okay
see run run run run run run oh almost
now I can reach
this and
then push push push push push oh push it
more there we go oh no goodbye
bunny oh another wait was supposed to do
this oh no that was
unnecessary come
on so many
unnecessary let push it push it the
skeleton that was
terrible anyway moving on
on the ear as long as not one of these
animals here
okay run run run run run
run guess yeah I thought
so funny
time seems I don't even know how that
thing goes but bunny
time bun bunny
whoa who no there's no
acorns
okay all of these levels were made in
the level if you play armor game at yeah
the armor games does not have this game
available anymore so
you can find a link in the page don't
ask me what that means though don't
worry it doesn't work anymore anyway
so is this one of those I have to kill
one right in the let's kill the be bear
the bear all right pushed
[Music]
it let's just stting let's kill the
bunny
there we
go oh wait
this
well
no
okay surprisingly there is no lemings
what a m ofunity right yeah that's they
should have had some lemings
no
he
oh
[Music]
oh they are
quite
stick oh I
see so I don't need to sacrifice anyone
wait there only one death though
whatever I probably go back and do every
perfect run on each of later
than wait a minute what's going on here
do I need to
pick the red
[Music]
one
no
there is actually a dark story behind
the M that lemings will run off
caves okay it takes too long for
those
so here we
go
not
really the elephant sacrificed itself to
let the other animals move
on hi I didn't know you're streaming
today hello F again it's a secret stream
today it was an unplanned
one so I cannot go there because was
um is lava it does not
leave death behind it
wait it does not leave death
[Music]
behind but to get
the run run
run yeah not exactly how I wanted to
land but it worked it worked out
anyway oh a bit inside the lava but it's
okay the game isn't that picky which is
good
thing
well
yeah very
quickly long story short the docmentary
that made a claim they were just tossing
the poor lemons of the cliff Instead
This thing is going
crazy I'm must say for a group of right
T Forest friends we share an odd bunch I
mean what kind of elephant lives in a
forest a cute one of course
crushing well that's a bit awkward uh to
suggest to crush the
elephant let's
go
[Music]
well I wonder if should go back
and before I do the final
levels let's get cuz game is so short
let's go perfect score
here this probably one of the harder
levels oh no I have to kill the pink
[Music]
bunny Okay pink bunny you can do
it no we can't okay it did says three
deaths
so
no
okay I have to do it in a maximum of
three
[Music]
minuts
so I can do
this
one
two and and
thir
okay whoa perfect
score that means that get back three
animals
okay wait how many are allowed to die in
this
[Music]
level okay wait what did I get up oh it
was because after okay so one has to
die
[Music]
okay what's this supposed
to I see I see it didn't move oh fell
off it it got stuck last time sorry this
makes it so much
easier yeah I think that was suppos new
pow print don't know what that means oh
it's because I get a rank on every level
there
probably so I just have to do this and
then
one pink
bunny okay didn't I have to kill one
here
sword straight through the head not more
beat at
all here go move
move
move I forgot about that
part oh yeah because I killed to let's
see what the game
says yes wait I killed three oh yeah I
only have to kill
two okay let's
see right into the I to okay so I should
be able to
get but it blue kid lands down
there
I tried to jump but it didn't
work oh no wait don't move don't move
yet I need
you
okay ah look at
that and then kind of comes back
here but I don't think I can use this to
reach yeah because I can't keep this
because through this trunk I can't kill
one
more that's no
problem new po print that's a rank on
every level two
level so what was special with this
LEL I kind kind of have to kill one
here okay if I wait with the
oh I don't even have
to H
I
can't the
is good
themselves oh wait I do still need red
key otherwise I can't can't get to the
acorn
okay I don't know if this is the correct
solution I don't know why they did wrong
last
time let do death okay so I only have to
die
[Music]
once okay let's
see wrong
way I must be able to read it but I
don't see how I can read it
as far as I can see here I I must die
because I cannot I cannot wait I can I
just need to be better at the
game okay so basically the exact same
thing just don't die at the at the start
there okay I
see
I see I
[Music]
see
B
okay get red key don't fall down and
rest ex
it sometimes you build up a part for
every animal to follow along that makes
sense like this this
level
just have to kill one of them but in
other levels they only like one reach
five death still be
ranking
so oh yeah it was
the I'm
stuck I mean I
with but
I wanted the elephant to
survive elephant has to die all
elephants have to die
has that's that's what the game
said and then kill the pink
bunny sadly the pink bunny had to
die
no I got
it yeah there we go that's how only you
see that platform hitting
the Doesn't Kill Them All imagine that
just everyone just dies you get
a didn't I get a PO for this I maybe I
missed the
message okay so I can actually do this
to solve it
properly oops ignore that that did not
happen
um
no this level is very
tricky no moving the wrong way there we
go and then and then move back well yeah
this works and this is
fine there we go and then I can reach
this and then it's like a there we
go zero this and it's said one that's
even better that should be an S
rank okay I should be able to do this
without dying
there we
go I will pick up those keys first come
on don't move
away there we go thinkink bunny does it
the way the group turn St STS GG's thank
you sweaty socks new P print yeah there
we go I
just missed that message last time there
we go now I have the maximum number of
animals which is quite not many like 16
out of it started with 30 of them that
means 14 has already died that's almost
help half of
them I hope your I hope our new home is
nicer than our old one yeah the old one
was cut down I mean what do you mean
before it was cut down presumably
andless chainsaw okay you mean after it
was cut down
okay yeah I do hope it's
less let's cut
down let's change
sword come on there we
go wa two red
Keys
okay oh and then I have to use the other
red key
to to open it
again doesn't matter which order it pick
the red key
in clever I'm not see not sure if I've
seen that in a game before but buttons
sure but
[Music]
Keys oh D another excellent
score should
have I'm better than the game Who
knowing this game so far new home is
going to be worse chain old one nah how
many animals can you you fit in an empty
box just the one then it isn't empty
anymore but I'll get my
cat kind of contraption is
this oops that didn't happen
okay oh I I need to stop doing that
bunny bunny is the best
one we
go wa
nice see I said I told you bunny is the
best
one take the driver seat bunny time to
drive no you got stuck stupid bunny come
on
bunny
[Music]
oh
stupid
thing is
moving what is this how am I supposed to
get it going okay let's
restart here a bit tricky to get
okay
okay I don't know what I'm supposed to
do
here okay I can't get
cled stuck
again yeah something am
missing
what's the point with
this oh it closes there I
see I'm
rude okay what happens if I don't pick
the acorn I mean I don't think
I I would change and I think there's
something I'm missing with this game or
okay
um that time it worked but animal
died maybe I should just take the key
and just not press
anything nope it work works if the
animal is not sitting on it okay
so let's try to take the key and
then somehow not be on
it okay wait for me okay so it does work
I just have to be prepared to get the
back onto
it what a tricky this
is okay go go go go go wait why is it
stuck go go go go drive this is as fast
as you can
do come
on
okay I don't think I can get up on on it
again
no Okay
so
can I go
here yes but I die I
do so I guess you could say I can't give
there what a weird
level oh I still
don't
funny
The Bunny and the lion are the main
characters I don't think they have any
[Music]
names I guess I could check the game
find
since come
on so close
what pink one has very sick
eyelashes and so does the
elephant come
on
no almost had
it it was it was about to go over pink
bunes cute it's a very cute
bunny pink bunny is
dead while bear has very small
eyelashes
okay
no I really
try
and obviously eyelashes signifies as
male or
female
[Music]
um so
close
pink
bunny the best one fail
failed go go go go it's very
tricky and I assume you can complete
this with sness or can I
qu
I guess I'm stuck on this
level yes the F pun P that's kind
of these animals are quite
feral ah this level is
impossible is there something I'm
missing
[Music]
I come so far I just can't figure out
the
vehicle yeah
I'm I'm trying different techniques
this almost feels like you have to
exploit the physics engine to get this
work I think I know say
when oops oh I probably have to
sacrifice two animals here yeah
probably why they have
the I probably only to have the sacrif
the
one okay then want two but I guess it
should try one you know get a better
score than the game has
because I'm better than the
game nice in the
middle I I forgot about the sacrifice
part of the
game there we go only one
sacrifice cuz I'm better than
game
you can you can probably still do it
with zero death you probably just have
to be very precise with that jump
there the roof is kind of too low did
you know that you can silence the game
Sound by clicking the little button down
there well if you havn't noticed it by
this point the music have been rocking
right yeah I kind of know about it I
just didn't feel like
muting because that would be
boring
okay by
bear bear by bear I just can't say bear
correctly no I need
I come on come on I need a pinky
pinky okay don't do anything stupid in
our
platform wa and also one death instead
of two yet another S
rank I really should be like a bonus in
that case people probably think you can
get an rank on every level maybe
not we're the the end of the journey now
hey you had fun I hope so cuz otherwise
my friend died for I wa I thought they
died because he wanted to get to
the paradise
Meadows and that will make me cck cute
animal tears not any ugly ones right oh
I supposed to do like a timing base
thing
here
okay
[Music]
I don't
know okay kill the
lion in the
jungle the lion dies tonight okay H the
I can't do it without killing someone
okay I have to R then
wait how am I supposed to get
[Music]
through
what
wait wait what's going on
here
okay
[Music]
okay so
somehow wait a
minute okay okay but it
doesn't
okay you should
somehow
get yeah I'm not sure how did this last
time
[Music]
this thing is stuck here and then
somehow I should get this one to
point yeah I have no idea how that
should
work
yeah and then I should somehow push this
down so I
can get up there without one
dying that almost me
impossible since you should be able to
complete level with
[Music]
Dy
anyway let's move over to last
level the metal
Paradise
oh look he got the
key okay now let's not just have every
everyone
die as I say as everyone is
dying
[Music]
get him out of
here I
went I'll do one
sacrifice I didn't what three
NS is it from this is probably level I
didn't best on I didn't even read a
message Welcome To Paradise
Meadows no
B thanks for
playing by the generic text more made by
up by anony
11
drawn M SW Michael SW I guess he thanks
to
aing programmer of the amazing box to
the physics engine and skate head for
forting it to action
SK there we go that's
game so still haven't completed
100% CU it's still this level I just
don't
understand
just somehow need to can I I'm allow to
look up a walk
[Music]
through gu that that ball moves really
slowly just oh
no
oh okay I might still be able to make a
move
nice yay no worker
needed I just accidentally did
[Music]
it new PR there there we go game is 100%
complete
whoa got more ear a rank of a on every
level in each world to win a for world 1
2 3 4 5
ort V stor games the game doesn't work
there so I cannot do that view the wait
I view the credits I didn't click
here oh we
got all these people and these people
new there we go that I can't get that H
but anyway pleas beat the last level six
friends left
to beat the last level with at least
friends
left I have
1 let me try that
again I should have jumped up there and
oh as a playing nice no
oh nice nice nice
no there we go okay good good
good no all
right I the ads
are distracted me
[Music]
no come on hit
it annoying I came I manant to get up
but then
I then I messed up I get got up and then
I messed
up come
on
come on come
[Music]
on
no okay I should be able
is distracted by ads and the B is dead
too I don't know
why because the B should say the whole
thing about ass bunny you can do
it the B can oh
I knew it would hit the ground
there
oh the Bon couldn't do
it there you go that's what I
wanted
I finally got up and then up on
the bunny can do
it come on now
bunny I had a chance but then I
accidentally BN just can't
back come on kute bunny
I walked up that platform I want to move
early so I can get the movement of the
platforms
to possibly knock the
platform got pushed into the
spikes
Mony
no come on hit
it why the right one moving so much more
than the left one
ah no
oh so
close now did last time didn't hit it
when I didn't want it to
be come on come
on I just want to get up from here so I
can complete level with Z
this
somehow complete level two friends left
does not
count
two cuz I'm pretty sure I just died once
in this level if I died twice I a bad
memory there we
[Music]
go see platform can't stand stand on
it
finally whoa there we go St it when it's
three part three like new
pint now get again why didn't did Count
last
time did I accidentally write more than
12 instead of more and equal you you
can't skip this
apparently if someone want that
screenshot of the sad bunny I
can I can post it on the
server I can I can post each of these
comic frames from the
[Music]
is
anyway aome J beat the last level with
at least 18 frames left had yourself on
but how am I supposed to do that's
fantastic J beat last with at least 25
friends left please just go outside the
sun is shining and there's other things
they
do okay these are performance prints I
don't think they count to 100% they're
like extra thing is is like the
Platinum relics in
Crash that was a quick
game yeah I said it was going to be a
short stream so like an hour long stream
I think that's a good
amount than you touch gr if
complet and yeah Call of Duty did that
too when you get the highest multiplayer
rank it tells you get some
sun H yeah it was
the world at war yeah because you
basically have to reduce some of the
other ones I think I did pretty good
down here which you apparently you
should be able to do like this one with
just one two yeah you can probably do
two this something but you can only have
five death in total yeah I'm not going
to do
that and I feel
satisfied world of war was I do I have
considered playing through like
every every uh Call of Duty game
so oh sorry s socks you did redeem a
hydr 47 minutes
ago I consider that game 100%
completed will someone is does someone
disagree then I won't
listen was I just wanted to do something
quick and short
today like I haven't like this was
supposed to be my week off and
[Music]
um and yeah yeah I just felt
H empty without
some streaming I just wanted to do
something think that was fun I I'm glad
you liked it and and I never played that
game before I've seen someone play it
before but not played it
myself so it was fun to actually play
through it and I also so like actually
like probably completed except the
performance not counting the performance
I did the par I did what it came to
do left now okay let's do a quick raid
and shall we
[Music]
visit I don't know who we should
visit we could visit Panda
Al do you think he will be surprised to
get a rate from me at this
