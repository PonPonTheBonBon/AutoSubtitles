surprise
history
let's see let's see if it works we go in
this picture
it's already working oh yeah it says I
hope
let me know if there's anything from
Computer Entertainment to Europe
presents
production
I can hear you
why are you doing with software
isn't really the same
energy in the voice as the previous
games
it's very
first record was Thailand I think so
[Music]
like I don't know it's just
sounded weird this game is taller than
the other king
so let's
[Music]
do some early stream
cropping
[Music]
there we go
and I wish not play
demo now
they go and then
perfect
more more resolution
so
welcome and what panic what what
happened
[Music]
so let's
start
with Adventure against I want the
adventure who should I play as shouldn't
it be uh what what does this start down
here
how about Coco
[Music]
yeah
this crazy choice right
yes how many times must you be told
cannot defeat
wisdom it is I who is the strongest
that will ultimately prevail this
bickering candle on no longer we must
resolve this once and for all time
for once evil brother I agree with you
we shall settle this argument remember
the Ancients would not allow it there
can be No Malice between us
then
against evil your players against mine
very well
summon the teams
wait a contest yeah not like
why not have a fight between and also
they speak right quite Crush
welcome
you and your friends
okay
and may the best player win
this is not a fair contest you have too
many players
if your confidence in evil is so great
you can win with equal sides
you must surrender to of your team very
well choose
let the games begin
I actually don't know
but if I take means
Coke is very tall in this game
so anyway
this is crash bash
spin
[Music]
so this is the first game Coco can do
the spin attack them
and then she won't be able to do the
Spin Attack until in Century
right
they might be there might be another
game between where Coco can spin she can
do that like the spin kick in Russell
cortic but that's not like the crash
spin
yeah
all right let's see the game starts
quickly
place for me oh yes that's starting up
quickly
let me
I I need to pick
and I feel like I've used a lot of this
many times not
so
I might need to do more designs
objective
all right object you use your ship to
deflect the balls away from your goal
The Wind by being the last player
standing but you're sitting
as John welcome it is it is it is crash
bash or as someone suggested a loco Coco
wait that was the wrong order Coco Loco
and I wish you like the crash package oh
we'll see how it is
flexible with the Sheep person holding
inclusive ship speed instead of you know
using the stick for a higher
first to give the balls an extra cake
okay I don't even use this thickness
thing
okay let's see how this goes then
starting out
it's probably cortex
when
it is the first level so
I don't expect too much
oh that one
when I have a quite quite a lead at the
moment so it's it's fine
[Music]
oh
what are you laughing at cortex you're
you're losing it
yeah it's actually
no I moved another day the physics is
between
[Music]
oh that cutting his gun
oh
that's a bad idea
[Music]
I reacted to snow today
basically there we go and basically just
did Charlie
yeah but this is just the first win
three two one
minutes on the stove and there's still a
beach Prime
14 minutes I know I like cooking
um it's really slow
as long as I keep the feet in
oh nice
let's get rid of the corner ounces
so many balls
what it is called marbles Maybe
nice to save it
[Music]
whoa
community
no that is my girl
can I protects us out
this is the balls have a hard time to
get removed from the field
balls balls everywhere
oh he's starting off goodness
and when the second player is out
there's even more balls that's kind of
counting Escape
when the game is basically playing
itself at the moment okay
wins for doing nothing
[Music]
nice I gave it a boost
oh I saved it
[Music]
okay what this is almost out again it's
not like I'm wanting to
out but
[Music]
the tricky part is when the balls knock
themselves
okay and they can all of a sudden
exchange Direction
okay two there we go
well well nice there we go
I guess maybe that's the trophy should I
go for all the trophies first or should
I go through the same game three times
and that's your choice
because you got additional things done
okay
[Music]
so if I should like go through all the
trophies on each first
then do this second and then the third
like a second round and a third round or
should I go through after we have the
same game mode immediately
okay you want to just
basically so you should do the same same
game out three times in a row or should
I
vary it up
switch it around nice baby
you're probably more beneficial for me
to do the same one over and over because
I get more history but
some more variation could be good for
the stream I guess sure if it's
providers with more kinky
all right to be fair the second and
third are on their singing around my
this trophies requires a
verse 23
I was going to be best off but there's
no better stuff when they have four
planes
charging the other place knocked them
off the ice oh yeah this one this is the
game that was on the demo of the game
collect power amps by entering the beam
win by being the last player standing
but we're sitting he's shot in the
players
not thousand meters empty by Falling
pushing to the a in an empress
repeatedly okay
that's the way today
lightning
that's why it's all the players and
collected lighting from other places
[Music]
but I mean
I'm still having to do the honest to
this so if you want more gameplay
if I mean the game
I should do the other two
all right take it no I didn't
no one takes it
what happens if timer is that
sure is pasta
[Music]
I did that wrong
oh there we go I didn't even need it
yeah
well that's a one out of three I guess I
miss assistant then oh well it's in it
now I mean I can always change there's
much part of the game time
[Music]
um this is not so good
ah
there we go it went fine
[Music]
around hopefully
[Music]
oh my God
that's it Chase continue
oops
[Music]
I went
thank you
great AI
you don't always go for a player anyways
[Music]
it doesn't want to fall off
oh
foreign
[Music]
the trophy is mine
okay I see Muslims two game modes on the
game man I don't remember
[Music]
this one and like the Pogo
let's continue
put it in a minute too because there's
only two you only need to win once
I guess I'll do it
when a second runner
second way around I'll do it to other
modes of each of these
both of seventh same time
to turn squares into your color breaks
they especially craze turn your squares
into points
win by having the highest score when
time Runs Out
I moved into next Square press to find
me sign
start with design
I'm just gonna hold rows it's like
Speedy boot boots to move faster
remember break the special case of 20
years crazy points
they have they must have done some
game testing and notice that people
didn't really get that part
[Music]
here you go
oh
okay I need to
there we go uh why are the boxes all the
way over there oh here we go I can't
find them
my box it flew out away
we're not going still gauge for me
doing my way
the box is mine
[Music]
oh
[Music]
when I do still have the lead as far as
I can see
what
another program
there you go over 100 points
this game looks scary kids it can be
chaotic at moments yay
thank you
good points
I should probably go for
boost or something
talking about it
he's evil
it replaces your power
that bullying Focus
[Music]
nice again boxes spawns on top of me
[Music]
I guess I have a hundred points again
let me get shot to also lose to power up
with me
well
I didn't get any extra points I was
foreign
a good question is always playing one
yellow
they could have gone with
[Music]
like
colors based on the play
I don't know what color cortex would be
yellow
because I'm on my way or I collected
that
[Music]
cortex isn't getting any anything
on my way
no
uh thieves
foreign
[Music]
boiling process I think
well
oh
[Music]
my three mini games
and then there's connective mode
[Music]
same thing yes
press x button same
okay my name is p o m
space p-o-n
hopefully it's written to completely
let's check
what if it's just Pom-Pom correctly
how nice of the games left me spaces
this is the last last one of the
trophies and he can actually have a
space in your name yeah
which doesn't allow it Discord doesn't
allow for username but the display name
at least
[Music]
because it's Pom-Pom with the swings
if you need to pick up and so crazy as
your opponents when buying the last
standing or this time we are standing
when having the most health run time
around
first circles we got friends first again
to throw first
squares press across to jump
don't get crazy TNT counts down and
picked or kick to pick it up
foot sister kids
okay that's a lot of rooms
opponents
[Music]
yeah I don't think spinning
I can't pick them up
okay cool thanks to someone you and me
now
why are you nasty oh
he has more help for me
that's not good
no
[Music]
stop that
where's most health I don't know
thank you
um take my invisibility oh he sure can't
throw that fine
um I am using
but I collect myself fruits that I could
win in the end anyway
hydrate
so
why are the gems green enough I don't
know the white silver
do it
you're probably let them then fight each
other a bit
I'm avoiding you don't affect me
now
let's do a strike in the face
you must have a headache from that
there you go
I exploded these pictures and he takes
damage from it
some strategy
okay
drama celebration
okay so if you attack them if you take
damage
there's like one fruit of damage
thank you
what's in there
okay
any house
attacking me
the suicides
welcome PC it is it is crash bash now
and
king of Dreams take out
I got all the trophies
this is now my beauty
should just collect everything at first
so I could just
[Music]
continue
so now I just do the two challenges here
because that would be two games
what series really plays through when
you're about there's a lot of things to
go through so crash and spirals no I
don't know okay depends you go with the
others against you that's not fair
but I only need one once
[Music]
we're considering how good that was
before
I mean I don't even need to do anything
this yeah letting them
fall in anyway
[Music]
okay
and so far I'm not even that a single
one of them
and as I said I let one in okay that's
one
[Music]
okay
they're basically down to my amount
no it's
no
okay oh no I can't touch this but it
doesn't wrong I'm gonna say
guitar in anyway
okay cortex is done
there is
not much
[Music]
the auction isn't stanked against me if
they just let them in but why is it
green and I'm still wear white
how are you hello
oh yeah yes
simply time
I'm doing it okay
I'm starting to feel better now
compared to before
basically
hello hi again hi
and you must win without the use of the
extra kick Arena and stuff like that you
use it that often
and I usually don't need all right now
oh no they're reflecting at me
well
Collision wasn't the odd stack yeah no
don't stand against me
and
get that yeah
no I moved away from them now he's
playing stupid
I got it there's some audience here
I'm getting nervous
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
that's right
[Music]
birthday
well more people share that yeah it's
nice welcome everyone
uh here's the air hockey game again yep
but a slightly different views
I can't do the
thing
himself foreign
just need to keep oh
now stop doing that
that's so mean
all right now
oh I think
[Music]
but I think I'm in
my same
now I can say take
it yes a bit more concentration now
if I couldn't win that he is in a single
try
oh nice
almost everyone is out
and there's one of them
in Aquatics
and you have the hitching night sounds
it's you had two now I don't have
anything left
we have one left and there we go I mean
well
shouldn't shouldn't take pink could we
still be the first one you win
or anything
[Music]
uh
I can change the name if I want to I
guess that's an easy one function
very safe
so let's do the polar thing again and
see what the difference are
let's say like I still offer to like
doing all three modes on a mini game
right that way as well
if people are fine with that
when by defeating the other players in
the allotted time oh is that all just oh
it's shorter timing
okay someone became small this can
actually be
it's a it's a regular people anyway
what's up
[Music]
oh he's small
no
[Music]
weird noises
no
you
need to fall off no I don't need to
borrow
excuse me
all right
time
um okay this is going to be tricky
I know we speak
that everyone fight cortex
are you supposed to can I avoid stupid
one I guess but
he wasn't really fighting back
missing it it's still slippery no one
got it he knows what it was
[Music]
no
look what is the beginning of me
[Music]
I'm wasting time
no
[Music]
oh my this is this is tricky
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
no
[Music]
one
I mean
I will I will try I can't promise that
is funny quite a few attempts
let's take him out
don't take me out
go
crazy
[Music]
[Music]
give me something
[Music]
no he's supposed to be Peach
ah
[Music]
and yeah
Nick's been someone just five
[Music]
perfectly terrible Kitty
yeah this isn't good
sometimes 2019 line
foreign
[Music]
what's up
thanks like
[Music]
what's mean no
[Music]
whatever it is
never mixed it
it's not going to be enough time for
this
if it's if it doesn't
no it doesn't
three two one okay I need something some
idea hey
[Music]
what's up Mickey
[Music]
it's too hard to fall off people
[Music]
[Music]
okay
[Music]
see he's not even he he's corrected this
[Music]
okay
and that's me ah so close
I thought I had a list yet
all of a sudden
but sure I can try to use this but it's
such a waste of time
and I'm really really great at kicking
others
[Music]
oh you go straight for it
[Music]
okay this might be it
if I managed to meet him then
that is
nope
finally
no
I had been it
three Peter buckets
make the monkey in this extinguished
that was not because this time you know
what I mean
next thing that's the word
[Music]
extinguished distinguished
just fall off
I want to see you have to do
[Music]
no [ __ ] off with it
okay I'll take it
and it works it worked finally oh it's
so many it have so many attempts
yay
so many attempts at least you only need
to win once
imagine it was a win three times
in that case that one would be
impossible
find them on
avoid the energy balls as they will
knock you across the eyes another thing
that I think this is the mode that
actually wasn't demo
and they won't knock you across the eyes
what they would do is
basically the electricity power up that
one
they're giving up
okay
my name is
if I could avoid
[Music]
I wonder if
oh nice
come here
no
[Music]
next is following me
okay oh you almost got anything
[Music]
huh let's see if I can use this
I can use it I mean
that wasn't I I didn't plan on that
but it worked
I'll take it
that would technically be my fifth twin
if you want to count the wings
on that one
okay and let's see how the program
changes
peanut butter okay great
it works in your face but yeah
I'm surprised it worked win by being the
first to decrease your score this year
in a lot of time so basically reach well
in my case 81st 60 for the computers
because apparently the game wants to
cheat
we can't make good computers so they
just have to do less than you let's just
[Music]
such as how things work
a bit harder to control
foreign
so much easier than the other one
nice one it's not easy oh and hydrate I
can hide it
laughs
I can't hajit it's been a professional
okay let's see what last one is then
this one might be annoying
nonsense
crates throwing you see challenge this
one let's see what's those two all right
win the game without touching the
poisonous mushrooms you cannot just
touch them at all
but it's a normal game otherwise okay
and I can shoot the mushroom
good to know
what's up
one and just
playing as normal
but oh there is there is one I'll get
down to my way
but uh it spawns right there
and I see him the completed planes never
touch the mushrooms but I stand
because they are stupid
all right just ignoring this okay
not get that my way
look I need those
why are the box is another side of the
theme
finally he can cut one here
foreign
[Music]
I pressed up too late I saw it and I
tried to press back
and this game isn't completely unfair it
is yeah this is that
okay can I be much more
don't let cortex get any oh he got
points
promise
I got they missed me rather
okay
no
how do you prefer being closely with the
cameras you see
now
I need
I need some form of box
oh
there we go there's a part of me
give me a box
finally
rarely have a lead I need to hunt more
and they're only 10 points more
okay oh there we go
but if you get the speed power up
that means you can't pick up another one
and much easier
what how much I was jumping that's my
friends
okay
and this person boxes around me
oh all the squares I've got it I haven't
I'm losing them
okay I'm getting yep
oh
on it
nope
but I do have a sufficient lead no oh
that didn't count
I guess this machine had to pull this
one hit
you should have to hit you toast
mushrooms yeah
no boxes only mushrooms
so so it has a spawning animation if you
hit during the circle you kill the
mushroom but then it has the appearance
animation and if you land on it at that
point
a the mushroom response is very normal
but you don't get hit by it
and then after that
pain
weird choice that way that it has that
middle
eh
win by defeat in the other players in a
lot I know another one of these
second being
basically must be aggressing
foreign
give me
there's so much else there
when Alice I lost it all hands this time
but that can make sense if I'm more
aggressive
[Music]
excuse me
I was married
so much health
do it time
I almost done eating okay I hope it
tastes one
okay
how did I get something I was too far
away from that one
okay okay
A bit more hands left can you stop
me
so it's so dry spinning boxes that I
mean I'm not thinking about that
I'm not kid that's doing that
yeah it's so hard
aim
everyone died
and I thought that was close I fell on
my lap that wouldn't have been a good
time
now that that will be that quicker
all right I can also spin in this mode
we should make examples
[Music]
[Music]
this is such a nice way
foreign
yeah
thank you
what it says
oh this is going to be tricky
basically defeated within a certain
amount of time that's just a tricky one
any of spinning boxes
it would work here for me
if if the opponent wasn't
this basically my goal is to defeat all
of them if they just when it will
Invincible for us but at the time
and to balance or like today means but
it was shorted to balance it out
surprise aggressive cortex what have I
done
fancy created cocoa they're already out
to murder
that was
[Music]
text from the back I have cheats
see you against one come on
okay no attack cortex attack cortex
she got this one I mean
at some point
with all this Randomness I will hit it
why didn't I get hit by that
with stress
well unless it was close enough for only
me to get a hit but it really looks like
a hit
in the middle that means most online it
should be hit
excuse me
foreign
good random placement of stuff with the
opponents attacking each other more than
me and
and then we
and then find one of these first world
and then there's a one second
question but where is the idols rest
what that's not rooms that's just a
record what
that's cool
okay
you get the board game and then you read
the real book and the CSS play where
okay but
how do you play
everyone died
this one
no one's attacking
this koala okay
[Music]
sometimes
excuse me so much
[Music]
three two everyone's eyes
I don't even think I was saying at me
and continue
[Music]
no
I just have to
go
I did try to because the I don't know
whatever
is some strong Nature's
me
because that's right
I basically try to gather knife why I
like this
the opponents
okay
there's not much happiness
no
something right it's tyrant
everyone died
so I just had walked away from there I
might have one of that actually
[Music]
okay I need
no
[Music]
I mean I have three of them attacking me
technically
so much house nest
it sounds like cooking
oh
that's right that's right
[Music]
getting your hands
you hit already
that was a creaky one go
in the area of the stones exploding so
big
[Music]
about a huge block of stone into my face
thank you
foreign
[Music]
why is everyone attacking me
okay now exist
now now it's more understandable
sounds
good
only my knife is waste
spending so much I have some mistakes
oh my
God
protection
washing dishes
[Music]
I'm getting bombarded with boxes
bye bye
Young
Randy have any husband again
[Music]
it's usually one of them having so much
more hustling
foreign
all right
they finally he we're 56 less against
left this one was very easy awesome
this was an easy challenge
accutated everything looking at the
screen
which is something I do want to do with
spiral saying that this through that one
without looking at skin
the first fire
does that sound interesting
[Music]
how would you even label that
because I've seen some
you have completed the challenges that
have been set for you in this world room
to progress to the next set of games you
must defeat the mighty Papu Papu
why
so yeah
so I've seen blind playthrough or
something like this at the time but
that's because if Finance did that that
means that you don't know the game
um
and I'm doing a semi-blind please switch
to this game I guess
if you eat purple purple and his minions
okay
huh
oh come on
okay let me guess
okay okay it's enough weight
regular box
[Music]
yeah
I didn't say that now
I'm gonna do some TNT anyway
oh
such big ranges
that stay away from the boxes
drop that
penis
wow
I'm going away
all right take this
eight bits
what do you have
oh sorry
I'll take it
so I guess this is the
[Music]
okay so I have to enter Warframe to you
from here which is appearance
warp selector and then crashed you
beach ball
that's a scene
beach ball
let's go to the beach and play some more
yes you ship to the the deflectables
away from your gold
oh this one does work differently person
holds for us to to attract balls to your
sheep to make yourself attracted to
balls
what I do
but I didn't want bonus everything
really is to Fireballs at your opponents
oh I can I can't find both experience
and otherwise it's the same the One
external this time
foreign
[Music]
challenge is
[Music]
no
and decrease the challenge is to do this
without
[Music]
gonna do this no I can't
[Music]
I'm going to leave Bitcoin ah thousand
kids
[Music]
is it time for how long you can hold it
that's
[Music]
and then there's the timer restarts and
when you release it or if the if it
needs a little loads
okay
meter showing
of course this is that that's not good
so I basically have to rely on these two
to defeat each other
[Music]
because I'm not counting
shoot away oh oh wow that was a quick
one
yeah you're like that
yeah if you shoot them you guys just
gonna shoot him straight at your own
goal
[Music]
oh wow wow
yep yeah
do that
balls yeah balls are everywhere
when I won the first one
as this ground doesn't tell
apps I train
[Music]
what how am I lost anyway
[Music]
nicely done
you can't stack them on top of each
other it kind of makes sense there are
physical balls
how about that
huh
[Music]
okay so so yeah sure cortex is defeated
you can still
get them on the on the edge of my team
and then I can shoot them up I well I do
that
[Music]
but
if I don't manage to get it on the
corner
wait I do think actually if you hold it
long enough is it it's going to release
them and make them run slowly
[Music]
the speed of that one
let's watch the boss
now
yeah like that
I like that yeah
next thing else I can do that oh cortex
is defeated
it looks like he's actually the one
going surviving this time
[Music]
no
no
maybe he isn't
or maybe he's
boss
[Music]
there you go
thank you I'm giving cortex bones
it is working
maybe I should try the other way around
this time I'll do the all the challenges
for this one and then we'll see how that
goes
then I move on to the next mini game
there we go that was a nice pass
I think they delivered to myself
well no
no
I'm just going on myself again
[Music]
when you got everything soon oh that
does not have to be six White
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I don't know I was gonna say because the
balls are into my Netflix to each other
however eh
yeah that's not something
and make a remake for this of this game
and make more accurate physics
but it will be something if the balls
were magnificent stuck to each other and
became a Super Ball
thank you
I just keep messing up
[Music]
otherwise yeah instead of stopping both
of them
instead of just choosing which one to
stop and there's nothing running and I
love to change it and apparently
the game continues
press the X buttons
beautiful
the one with least
left they must have swings or something
okay
my squad is nothing so much it has
really fun every day
[Music]
it's not so fun now
[Music]
okay
[Music]
come on
no oh thank you
anyways
I'm not leaving
yes if I
[Music]
so if I do get rid of the koala
[Music]
the monkey thing
might defeat itself
[Music]
yep that was one
[Music]
nope
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
to destroy the enemy he must destroy
himself why what
I don't think that was relevant
hmm
it sounds like
it sounds like a Kamikaze message
which I think yeah very accurate code
damnation the video girl defend your
goal of the future depending all the way
to the odds against again
not much creativity
[Music]
so the same thing but I just have to be
better at the game
I don't even need to be good at the game
[Music]
they aren't even defending
20 trying to defend
speaking of not trying to defend
[ __ ]
[Music]
I'm going to defeat the cortex
with pause
oops I gave you that one
[Music]
I have balls
and I'm going to feed you that
I can't speed there you go
there we go another one
last last two thirds of life now
oh I didn't what kind of physics was
that cortex
you're the scientist here okay
[Music]
explain that physics
now now it's starting to defend it's a
bit too late now
[Music]
[Music]
now I just need to survive
one of these defenses destroy each other
[Music]
nice
laughs
[Music]
wait I'm destroying myself at the moment
[Music]
passing it back and forth between me and
the Royal and the light score and never
too late
no no no today
I'm happy out here astrology
keep me company
so that was all of this falling nowadays
I have one more
this must be you cannotch if you can't
use the magnetic ability you can only
use the kickability good luck
because that's that's the level of
creativity of this game
your opponents will have
intermittent Shields what
can I speak English
it was not that I expected
oh
so
seal is [ __ ] me from scoring
because that's fine
where's my sheet
so
I mean you can still have that plan no
when they die
no no
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
no no
nice
and I said the way it takes a second of
the processing line until he actually is
going
that way they can't really make sure
that it actually went in but it takes it
takes a second or so before before it
starts Counting
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
very nice I
love that one
I'll get all of those now
[Music]
and now I got no nothing
I am
first place currently together with
cortex I'm actually first place with
that okay okay no
no
she's going
[Music]
drop the
detailed
[Music]
cortex and now you have a professionally
now YouTube well well kind of physics
cheat is that
all right let's test for him oh I didn't
think that oh
what happened
[Music]
cancer
this is cheating
she's active on your final opponent
but I did win pick two trains but I did
I am doing now
now we don't need to see the beach balls
anymore
I'm not sure what it was very
copper and Metal
I'm not sure where the beach part comes
into that
see the code was like wait where's the
destroy myself but I didn't get that
so this is tilt panic
or is it this one that was part of the
demo because it's the tilting one
see I think something like that
destroyed himself
[Music]
adjust no Shields I have to go
okay Greg you'll be in my mind
till you're always in line with it
office
have a nice
only five percent
nope
thank you I mean also beware of my
office you're gonna saw that one
I have this one I haven't it's the
beginning
which I see
but they might be gonna do something
else
yeah shouldn't be enough to you know
getting ready to keep it yeah
I don't know
just have it tilt down like that so if
they have another one of those defeat
all their enemies within one minute
three two in that case I could just use
the electricity if I managed again
here we go again
so I need this one
no no
um
well I
I only need one win
so that's enough cortex so he can't win
yeah
what is the water still not nothing
why did I keep missing this
one
and why is it quality why isn't it
I guess it's Crash bandico it's not
plenty crash
tiny one now
down there you go finally I win
this one like the water assisted tilting
the arena more than actually doing
anything
it doesn't like attack anyone
that was easy now
and there's some water or something on
the preview picture too
now let's see what this challenge is
when by defeating the other place you
know yeah 30 seconds online
because one minute was enough
[Music]
yeah this is 30 minutes
thank you
all right
oh so close
yeah it's gonna need
[Music]
no
three two one go
knocks out immediately three two okay
[Music]
no my way
[Music]
go
[Music]
oh wait I shouldn't have this
[Music]
isn't working I need the electricity
I basically have to wait more
whenever the electricity decides to show
up and then I must also keep it
oh
yeah
there we go
well
that can happen too
[Music]
and that was nothing
yes no I can't start I can jump after
there you go
son
[Music]
it's pretty easy when you actually
managed to get it
another green chance there's a lot of
green gems in this one I thought it was
fun
but I guess it can be more than one
Emerald
oh
hey
yeah you have to take what he means
place by doing it here
celebration
Beware of the storm
prepare for a bumpy ride oh it looks
very stormy
so it's like
[Music]
okay that's one
oh yeah
now I speak Coco
big beach
now you decides of cook you always so
big before Oh
[Music]
the bumpiness comes into place
I don't know it doesn't seem to do
anything just seems like
stormy background and that's it
the modifiers is doing a background
[Music]
what I seems to be a very biggest need
in particular
yep
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
does it really change much honestly
there's a lot of
more like air leave something
right hey
okay
this isn't happening though
you fail
because it plasma is irritating to
quickly I can't use that in my advantage
and that's a shame
off to 11.
Adina
it stops lightning about much yeah
but I mean
first Arena lighting to eat really yeah
[Music]
it's basically as if the platform was
still due to how quickly it rotates
[Music]
oh big
come on a giant
why did you have to pick cactus that are
such a large size difference
oh wait you can have this back by the
way
hahaha
and and and I have a waist landing on
the
platform didn't affect the platform as
well but there you go okay Stefan
instead that's a win
perfect see that one is created I wish I
could see it from here something that's
it's fine
okay okay
oh
I wins three rewards more Pogo objective
and circle areas with your color
capture the center and add the squares
to your score the edges of the Arena
count as squares of that color when by
having the highest score when the type
Runs Out
and electric Sun beam is the
let's do this
I think
in every direction
that's dangerous okay this is my way
[Music]
okay come on because we move
foreign
thank you very just
because over 200 points
twice once this one getting so many
views that's cheating
[Music]
foreign hey
[Music]
my speech means species
[Music]
Big Cheese
get out of the ways
thank you
not sure next time
[Music]
I mean
someone has yeah
this is my husband's favorite game
hello hello
it's gonna be fun you can be stupid too
it's
[Music]
all right
[Music]
shoes eyesight shoes
makes me go so fast
now I just try I was so close against my
points
now pretty
kept destroying
trying to get points
[Music]
I'm gonna get your points
when I got
over 159 so that's good enough
I mean it's not Donkey Kong let's see
yeah
it's a monkey
combined with something
thank you
donkeys
I was like yeah
like part monkey party kangaroo
oh yeah
win by being the first exclusive scored
the series
I have so much points dude
basically just get 1050 points
yeah thank you for stopping
I'm going the wrong way
thank you
[Music]
okay okay now
oh I just got the shoes and everything
yep
oh excuse I'll take those
shoes nice
get out of my way
perfect
it was
important
and the final challenge
let's see score the most points in one
oh okay so doesn't matter
I just have to do one massive
okay did that win
[Music]
oh
nothing can beat 25 I don't think they
would be 25.
so all I need to do is basically
stop them from getting in front
when I get 26 now
now this is okay I guess it's so amazing
[Music]
I think he's he's like it
basically
I can't okay how many points I guess as
long as it says
there you go
and POI monkey kangaroo thing didn't
even yet
I can sing on a plan
policy is nine the smallest is foreign
well I should say more consistently
no to be on safe side
[Music]
so
[Music]
face splash
more free
half of the challenge is done for this
area
can you bring uh slightly Hardy
oh explicit crazy story big oh
be careful not to fold
win by being the last standing or having
the most health when time Runs Out same
boots to move faster
avoid tease or you're moving slow motion
give immunity against explosions
plus antenna player okay
more stuff
so much more stuff
I just did that
no one saw that that didn't happen
how strange I've never been here before
if you hold an explosion it doesn't
count
oh but if you drop them
oh my
God
unfortunately has the most health okay
what happened
I destroyed the floor but not believe
myself
that's happened
foreign
explodes
right and this cortex isn't real this
time
I'm assuming you film
I did
fell off
oh my
how am I supposed to mean this
[Applause]
three two one go
no
I'm just up to
be passing
thank you that's everything
cocoa wing
I just need to make sure that koalas
oh it's nice he's dead
foreign
good
oh my
God
is it cortex
you can't do it
and
what is the mistake now pick that up
yeah okay
running out the wings
foreign
okay so much for that
now it's a corner that's
another win three wins and the Coco gets
the
trophies
I must forget what it was called
that one was quite tricky
kept falling off the damage
so next one
win by defeating the other players in
the world okay another one actions
okay I guess it's time
thank you
now
[Music]
I spawn on me that's cheating
oh God I said too much hands left
foreign
that's how it did
hahaha
show a professional
yep single attempts of course
last and
almonds
as challenge
hey
win without the wheels to pick up the
crates
foreign
no
why did the ground get destroyed when it
fell on me but it doesn't when I saw it
on others
that's just that's fair
foreign
Ty always has been
uh
see that was pretty easy
thanks to the game at quite a different
Spanish is done I like it's a fox
no why I won let's see what's to know
I won the game
destroy all of your opponent's tanks
because they have more than one
win by being the last standing
or having the most health
where they started with the fire
Mayweather drop lines
extra mice very weird looking mine
three two one go
oh you can
[Music]
thank you
excuse me
oh it's cortex mine
[Music]
which one
I mean
that was kind of tricky
[Music]
I should more than one because she's one
dick and she's like five
that's not fair is it
thank you
excuse me yeah look at look at how much
he's shooting how is this far
[Music]
[Music]
Why did Why Can't This reverse
but does it matter it's still bad
because it's better to have like five of
them all over the devil hitting everyone
constantly that I'm having one strong
one that doesn't hit anyone
thank you
monkey kangaroo scene came out and
getting cut out of the pictures
because they are everywhere
thank you
may I take each other please
all right
expensive
my mind the budget
okay
one-on-one is moving certainly easy
could they have done that a bit better
[Music]
okay
oh oh my
okay stuck
for 50 seconds
foreign
[Music]
please
shut himself
oh perfect and that's a fine I didn't
even
I didn't even do the final hit
but I'll take it
what a strange game mode
probably the worst one so far I mean I
can't have the slightest it's like the
least amount of control of this game
mode
the biggest issue is that the opponent
being able to shoot multiple times but
anyway meanwhat is
apparently win as it is
you
[Music]
if everyone attacks me then it's three
versus one this is going to be very hard
yeah
definitely bad uh yeah myself
all right I forgot about this one
perfect
let's try yourself Mr Hammer oh
how funny
the the corner count did apply that and
he lost
okay find the one I have something good
now
and don't let me do any more tanks from
this here on a for which
there are larger map maybe if you can
type things they're probably not going
to have a large map
three two okay
myself
[Music]
so much
I know I might take myself
come on
yeah I decided for me that's not funny
[Music]
thank you
oh my
hey it's not easy
[Music]
you failed
I feign
what is your phrase
wait that's it
[Music]
attack
the monkey
but it's basically always have a shot
2018 fire
to me
you failed hello
oh
that doesn't sound good kitten I hope
you're resting
I'm getting better soon
that doesn't sound cute
oh peanuts pain
all of a sudden okay I'll take it I hope
you're not feeling too terrible at least
be anything
yes
finally done
[Music]
that's that's kinda okay
that's
happy
but you're not like
feeling awful I don't know what to say
you are progressing very well more
challenges lie ahead in the next warp
room show us you are worthy of them by
defeating the mechanical bears
eating a well
I hope my stream can't make you feel
better
defeat the polar bus and his army of
mechanical deaths
[Music]
oh I see
[Music]
oh then I guess I'm inside
okay
all right
that's not fair I mean you'd always use
that one
kiss me get out of my way
next
[Music]

well I won

one through three

please message too
[Music]
they sure love their balls the ball is
some symbolism
balls everywhere and this is the ball
game
crash bashing and balls
heels bones
you used to ship to this reflect the
balls away from your code oh yeah yeah
the weather for engines attack oh oh
engines here when by Pink the last place
standing okay
collect the force fields from your
corner post use it to prom balls away
from your own names
nice
oh
awesome
come on

and how long is this impacted for
[Music]
well I guess

I was like there but it is
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
you can't win boys
take many bones Engineers
yeah it is not going to continue when
I'm losing that much
oh one more training
single player
they really need a quick restart option
but unless you actually get it for one
win they don't really need to count wins
for the computers
[Music]
well soon
no
try to react to that one
[Music]
I get that
seems like the corner isn't reacting
[Music]
more expensive shorts
they're probably all the same night
mines feels much shorter than the rest
[Music]
tonight
keep
letting them through
okay
oh my
God and it means again
um
I need my dress back
[Music]
follow
along
that's easy
[Music]
let me know
[Music]
but
excuse me
questions
maybe you should never miss me
now
uh
striking
oh
[Music]
all right
pretty much away from me
no it's no reaction
[Music]
now it's mine
Hey Kevin too many balls for you to
handle
if that's even your real name
too much
perfect

a little wrong way
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]

Bandicoot
[Music]
good
now you just need to let them let's run
yes
that was that was close
this is my attention that was close
did you survive a rocket man or was that
too much for you to handle
amazing oh I don't still have two more
challenges maybe I should say that that
was too close I don't want to redo that
party thoughts
dancing to the music
so many cheering pumpkins
defend your car with the Arts against it
this one this time the proportions are
smaller
it was already hard enough for to do it
normally but at least I only happening
once
they're not they're not that true
normally they might be no it might be
some cases
where they are
no
again
[Music]
so
[Music]
I keep moving away when it's when it
goes straight for my gun
yeah I did it again and that's why this
is reacting
one do you tell me
oops
here on this one no this is these
challenge
actually basically this exact same thing
but I just wanted to win once and I have
a five
five
lives left up
and it's not going that big
oh nice
doing it you should find that and I'm
listening
oh nice safe
no not so nicely
foreign
[Music]
Good Times
okay supporting this out at least
a second you don't have that quick
reaction time
[Music]
it was hard enough to just win at all
it must be the fine fine don't lose
yeah that's starting I'm cute
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
definitely
[Music]
[Music]
all right that's funny
[Music]

but I'm also doing kids
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
and not you you're doing well well I'm
trying to do good too
[Music]
and I'm actually on the good side
oh my what is this
there you go
with the shield you can't stop those
cortex
now I had two messages
you need to stop
[Music]
[Applause]
doing the measure how long they are
active for they probably aren't active
for long just that the computers are
thinking reacting right and you come up
comes up and so they're basically
activating reactivating them
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
now
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
all right
[Music]

things
all right
oh oh you're cursed and it's my fault
oops

get these balls away from me
all right corners
[Music]
okay the monkey's gone no yes yes
he was to focus on getting the shield
singing repellent repulsing Hoops
intensifies finally
mirror thing I think
finally after uh
I'll save this again
let's see let's see what the final thing
is
maybe it's maybe it's not a stupid one
and actually uh
an easy one
I can give it like one attempt and see
how it goes
slap
four minutes left of my normal streaming
time
[Music]
that's totally fine
and this is at least it's like 10 of
them straight to my God it was three so
it's uh it's uh that cruel but it's but
still
foreign
oh
[Music]
I don't know how many Friday night
yeah
don't you know how to count
but that's fine
maybe something you should practice
yeah it takes you know
Sam's Sierra's a good number whoa
[Music]
what kind of physics was that that's not
a bouncing works
[Music]
I might not have oh okay I might not
have seen many ball bouncing in my life
but
seriously
yeah I guess this is my name enemy
I guess
I mean that was nice thing they said
more often
that video with physics doesn't play
wow oh
I think it's been
three hours now
well that was fun I got to see two words
and
they're challenging the last one and
more
bashing of Crash next week then
pumpkin
Saturday the orange pumpkin
stream screen
but there yes as you can see
two days from now this time the time it
is right now on your clock that is when
the stream is going to start on the 27th
so yeah check what your time is and
remember that
so you don't miss it
and then
yes
okay anything else amazing
forget me about
that
the tea posting coffee that's the cocoa
um and which one
I remember she was twin sanity
when
after the
um
13 race
thing between says yeah it's probably
yes yeah I see it was Twinsanity and
then they added same out with the Titan
racing because it was her new outfit
and for every game and her outfits kept
changing I mean sure crashed I would be
changed as well but it was basically
blue shorts
in different designs but purpose outfits
changed more drastically
and for every design change my Google
her shirt became shorter
when
anyway
it is Tuesday
do you know what that means
I don't even know what that means
now it means
this means it's Splat cheers day
if you like split Splat huge things
I like Splat Tuesdays
[Music]
because
normally she'd been streaming for
[Music]
um
when I was social versus two more hours
[Music]
I think
so let's go and
hear her on when she's just received by
doing this fight
[Music]
and um yeah that's that's it I
I guess I should remember this command
or something I got to just go I got a
YouTube channel with the videos and
and um
and that's it
oh that's the uh
hello to you yesterday that's the Coco
um
is it based on
[Music]

anyway
[Music]
[Music]
