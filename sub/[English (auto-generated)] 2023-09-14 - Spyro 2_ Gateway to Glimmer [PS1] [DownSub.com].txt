I can't spell leave my apparently

and

the girl the title should be updated

and there we go

you see now what's in the picture I know

I know but like

Sheila was saying didn't really have any

other page to herself

because the thing is which I did

throwing

I'm not getting my messages

but then I equipped the

I don't know

uh so I guess it didn't count this

I need to just quickly check if it

wasn't

anything important I had to do now I'll

get back to the house messages when I'm

done streaming

sorry

yeah so yeah I don't need to speak to

you so I presume because I quit during

the credits

wait it didn't even say me connecting

all these gems here why

so it didn't save

when you enter the password

I thought it auto saved when I entered

foreign

don't be so lazy

all right spinal

[Music]

is everything there we go yes

[Music]

anyway I guess I have to defeat last

night that's not rich though again

if

games

like yeah because apparently it did not

saying first off it did not say that I

it has not said because I entered the

bus terminal which that seems like a

huge oversight

Spyro

spam

and then

yeah I already got hit

and

wait

nice

so we can finally eat

yeah

because even

trying to pick up these words is tricky

yeah girl

there we go

now I got even stun luck

come on

oh my

Beetle yeah I know how to read that now

ouch

if you get him a stun look

this one isn't so terrible

I guess it's not a proper stunt luck but

I guess I knocked him in place thanks

he's done he's I guess

I haven't managed to run between

oh

there guys I've been scenes because the

camera is focused on drip too because it

probably makes sense but

it makes it kind of tricky if you know

it is turn around

if I didn't get hit by again okay

well

and he's next to spider with Thomas

okay I'm I'm out of nice

on my

sure can

sure can hit me easily huh

can you run into that one good okay

he said

he said bunch

he had it

a short dance

thank you

[Music]

turn around why this is

I hear stain

that's right

come on

there you go

okay

hang in there

oh wait this was right there us see now

now I'm just doing good

it's dropping straight onto me

another Monday

all right dropping one next team

I did see that Hunter

nope I stuck

hey it's not easy when when my biggest

enemy is something

I don't want to spin the case

now I'm doing is the voice type is

character inspired universe

he's worse than money bags

very much sure Moneybags tried to sell a

dragon egg for profit

sure it's it's one of

The Inspired species but that's like the

biggest crime is done or something but

prior to hunting I I don't know

I imagine this every time but

that's my shower

that's just how much I dislike County

so hard to hit him

and he is distracted when he gets lost

in

so when I run for the same orb you have

a bigger chance of getting it

because it gets too occupied it's

trying to

there we go

and there's another one oh he barely got

any helps left

there we go he got negative house

Mickey it's here hydrate okay that

sounds like you Daddy let's let's

hydrate

someone has been bad teaching my Crone

so that's why

I hope you are

much better now

and we see

I got it I know

okay how is this case

come on

there we go

I was basically touching he's not really

like

whoops

no no

hey

hey papa how's it going tell everybody

I'm Lucy

and what is this a hairstyle this bike

is spinning on a spot

um

this is just one problem

but as I said I want to do this game man

now

you can't do all this against points too

um

one of the skill points is defeating

crypto all three faces without making

any damage

armies all right you can't just have one

romance on top

oh

no

here you go react with very slowly no

name is

no damage against the enemy boss

and I have done that in reunited but

realized it is easier

foreign

at that point I have three stacks if I

went going for it

and by restart that is die because this

is no restart option

thank you

it's so much health

finally

I am getting better at this so

just how well I can do this face

why does it have real palace

okay this face is much easier than in

red this was it's harder

not the faces are easier

okay yeah getting to the two first

spaces without taking them and like I

could get so now I did this second and

third spaces without any damage so doing

the first without them should

if I'm a bit more careful it should be

possible for me to do

I don't know how to start shopping

networks right in front of

yeah

and like and we kind of did this last

time but

yeah it's the the gems straight through

to cook in Germany

thank you enough

Dragon World and I've still got a

vacation to take I needed more than I

should turn red and

I have a stupid thing

hunting did something

oh my very

I mean

for helping us wow

the Sparks can you grab them

let me just type in the new coordinates

and why are you tapping his pen

come with me and then someone has some

headphones

Dragon Shores if you want to visit well

okay come on Sparks we've got a lot of

vacation to catch up on

there we go

getting credits let's speed to it

dropped

1 300 frames

wow there's a lot of friends

but like

four times three hundred see how it is

10 seconds of footage so 46 of footage

being dropped

uh yeah

that's all the credits

AF

have you tasted me wait does he have a

belt but no

no clothes I guess there's clothes

by the way if you win 10 tokens you can

visit our theater yes I will win 10

tokens

grass everywhere

I've stepped up let's let's go

let's go

that was a heavy ball it sounds like

it's gonna be sand or something

film

um when I exploded when hit the wall

what a strange baseball

well I have no experience with baseballs

in real life to be fine

hey that was pretty funny wasn't it yeah

I guess

spiral talking

let's do some

boom

yay got it

this is pretty easy isn't it yeah it's

pretty easy you can't you can't skip

this last token

you don't eat

we don't

why am I using my noise

well okay

he sure makes a lot of noise

okay I guess I guess it doesn't

but I guess it doesn't work I can do

this

I missed I missed that shot

I missed the second one too

okay so apparently the ball is spawning

in front of spiders it's going behind it

and it goes up pretty far

many as you should just be able to stand

like him

then right here and then

do a very short jump there you go

inside the chef was cooking channels

where do you store them

I Don't Wanna Know

and he will he tried to cook girls he

was something that's fun

he sounds like he's dying he's afraid of

dying

thank you

bring anything

more

anything

I need it nice shooting here's a token

I'll take a token

yeah let's go

oh

they don't want to be shot

they are very

it doesn't they don't look like they are

participating

[Music]

he's a token

yeah ready for the next round

these however they they love taunting

they have no problem being shot

I mean they're showing their butts to me

and I'm shitty but that's because

you didn't have time to dinner

yes I'm stealing all your tokens will be

a set for the next person coming to this

place

and this is what Sprite wanted to do

only

from the very start

free free

give but you can ride as many times as

you'd like

this sounds very suspicious when you

phrase it like that but sure let's go

my friend I left two fans together

can have fun taking care of a baby

I'm talking

they love being shot in the butt

uh

there's a lot of fun saying

as promised here's your one tote thank

you

yeah they really wanted people to ride

these things so they encourage them with

tokens

oh look this one got two phones

oh my

oh yeah

[Music]

oh I'm with my own phone

give me one tea can be a good woman

boom

my this one

someone left a bank on track that seems

very very

oh no this one this one comes straight

at me

this seems very irresponsible to the

babies on the track to be honest

and who was there first then they put a

balloon the someone placed these

balloons here while there were babies on

the track what did someone place the

baby there

after the balloons were already there

that's a big question

watch out for the baby he even knows

there are babies on the track

these days

watch out for their babies

don't don't kill any babies

wait I need I need to jump into some of

these okay

trying to paint pay attention

these are heavy cart

oh I jumped over it even though it looks

like a camera

[Music]

well I was almost dead in the baby's

face

I mean

someone left the baby on the track and

this time almost around the baby over

myself

I guess all right come on

oh

I I oh there was a baby there baby died

for another

you mean it hurts spiral her to baby

yeah wait

you you want you want me put two phones

I mean if if you were to give me two

like full-size phone plushies

that would be pretty neat

should I hit this thing at the track

travel Charlie no no there's no trouble

here

my Champion account is out there it's a

crowded track okay actually I didn't

mention the baby

it's very nice then

that is to jump for wait how am I

supposed to jump for that but when it's

what it won't come stay

wait what are you so excited about that

yeah

maybe I should get it on the way around

okay

hey

okay you can get it by that it's very

weirdly placed to be honest

oh

you need to jump with that

it's hard to tell if I need to jump or

not

if only could give balloon two different

colors or something

like green balloons is supposed to just

run into blue balloons you're supposed

to jump after

that was a big jump

S I learned another baby

okay

can I stop being bad at this

like wait I was pressing the direction

like it's like waiting around the corner

when Inspire coming

one on it

and it's not a baby

here we go

another danger zone again um

I need to remember that baby

now now in the second

we'll remove the rope from the ones that

you don't need to jump yeah yeah yeah

that's that's a good idea

if they really want them to be visually

similar

you could do that

see we are better game designers than

games

thank you

okay then it's just that one

this one well

I mean this is for playing on the tracks

but who who who was the guardian of

these babies

and you're on a roll there's a cannon

installed on your car for this run and

you'll have to shoot balloons too are

you gonna give it a try

are you gonna give it a try

during the Third Run yeah

what you said it only time

seems very responsible for everyone

involved but now we got a cannon

you're going to

I guess I'll do I want to play it on the

game but this that was the game I'm

going to play whenever I'm done with

this game it does have this explosion

sound

so that's going to be interesting here

okay can I get it from this direction

yes

okay

and I'm done so far

oops you can definitely see

Ing and then in real life I think

require more Precision ignited here you

can spam it a bit more

but you can't spam it too quickly so

it's a little bit tricky

oh missed again ah the library then

how much money okay I need 3D coming not

so much money does Spy I get for all the

times he got hurt on this ride now he's

he's willingly getting hurt apparently

hello Miriam Gabrielle Miriam we are

here again it's been a while I'm happy

to see you so I haven't responded with

two minutes but I kind of behind on the

comments

there is a Tomb Raider remastered yes

there is but why or how does that affect

me

because hitting other coasters which

they know are there seems a bit

neglectful yeah why are they running

because it's against each other

I can't say how excited I am

are you gonna play it on stream

you're gonna stream it

I can wait six months for release okay

you wanna you're gonna stream it in six

months

oh it doesn't come out for another six

months

Lara in HD pump on act as classic as you

should be

oh it's a yeah yeah yeah

that's on on the on the Valentine's Day

even

no I I quit for six months

HD Lara but still with pointy boobs

they should have add that like a cheat

code they should be the high quality

through the model but with pointed boots

anyways keep shooting Journey

I need it now pointy boobs he has turkey

the teeth what

pointy boobs

it's weird when they intentionally

disappointed

there we go finally

all the red balloons I think

which is uh the Disney show Kim Possible

where the main character named King

possible

it has pointy boobs for some reason why

all other female characters has normal

rounded boobs

I don't know why they just

like that

I can't get a question give me the token

I collected everything in no I don't

know

open the door

thank you

oh a full cutscene

you don't get

yeah everyone

[Music]

yeah you got this

never mind

do you can see here

no it's hard to see

anyway

my phone you don't

know so

needle boobs you know how I feel about

Laura you want to marry Laura would you

like

wait

wait they're not going to give me a list

of levels that have skill points

oh my this game

okay

[Applause]

some skill points are easier with these

yeah yeah since yeah I can use this

this is a this is a gift to me and I'm

about to use it to get skill points

and this this homework

and

in this game this is the only home one

with a portion like this I think

yeah I think across spray one two and

three this is the only portal that acts

as a level portal that goes to our

homework

Inspirations we have kinda returned home

photons that are kind of like label

photos but they aren't really there's an

interesting random Factor

and right now and I don't have the

option to Warped tournament

because I need to go to

Taco towers and yeah I know I yeah I

don't have an option

Warrior Towers

you know what I mean

Summit Forest

open it up it's a good day every knee

we are all the Blessed then crash 4.1

outfit at the Laura Laura Croft yes

um I've always filled out all slots

however I should according to another

model be able to add even more outfits

so I will add it to the list

and on outfits I'm gonna add it in these

notes Laura Croft

as an outfit idea

if I add Lara Croft as an outfit it

would be an outfit unlock from the start

in that case it would be like a bonus

outfit

in that case Benny kind of have to play

Crash whatever

and plays Tomb Raider in secret yeah

yeah

so you got me there I mean I mean I

I've been doing

uh no those Nomads pistols only every

spot I have every day every every team

ready game

I I I just didn't want you to know that

but now that you have revealed my secret

fair enough I can't really mean it now

you got me

all right at least it should be easier

to do the uh with the Bell now I mean

technically

because because I have constants to play

now

did you see the character in Spyro Tara

laughed no it was okay her name was only

Tara but yes

yeah because liquid reverse Tara lofty

becomes a lot of tough

and I asked a joke she should also have

large

I have angled boobs you you want yeah

yeah you want pon pon to have like

pointy boobs

no I still have to

there we go

soniccraft go to scene from creams

creams

no I think I think qualific remain the

same

yes

I think I think I mean more of more

obvious that is

but I guess I guess

um

Benny needs to rate the Laura Croft

outfit in that case

to make sure it's up to

ft standard

uh-huh okay good morning

what

basically it's

wait does it does it destroy when it

collects water

really

that's a bit stupid

they don't attack me when I'm in like

this

it's not until I swim down is it

wait what happened with my attack he

didn't attack he didn't do anything he

just stood there

what

a funny looking I don't want to speak to

you because I'm tired from

I mean I

he did this game

as much as I want fun version that is

your six pointed boobs would be funny

so maybe make it your team

no it's it's the

um the Pom-Pom multi crash four but I

mean having fun

because I want to have one phone as a

3D model on stream

and I will make custom outfits as well

and I guess Laura craft outfit could be

one of them

if no data

and it'll be an obvious inserted cheese

yeah yeah

please make it making an obvious insert

if I am wondering why

I hate this metal sharks

yeah but I just want to shoot them

there we go

wasn't so hard was it

easy easy easy

sorry about that

yeah you haven't you haven't designated

position you spotlight or something

anyway now I can help me

because one of the thing you should do

is destroy more seaweed

which is so much

so much easier with his power

oh well I didn't want to shoot you

you kind of got in the way

do you think so yeah

what

foreign

that one

that one

okay let me can't have you

I don't know what what it is when you're

inside watching it's got some kind of

the RC

but still a fire power up no no what

what did I think Orleans said it how

it's not superheated water or something

that turns into a some kind of project

thing

are there more seaweed in this level

because I don't oh yeah there is

there is

yeah I'm sorry

here we go

under this one no way

they are on every 11

. hopefully not inside the towers

that would be annoying

this is clear

I haven't got there's plenty of seaweed

the weed of the sea

there you go

but it doesn't say stop points you just

place the melody

dreaming

okay

that one is got

dark as

as many

skill point in this game though I think

okay

I need to

like what kind of one and

there goes all over the windmills I did

and skills bad line plans

anyway first off is Colossus with the

we need to get the perfect score

where's Colossus is one of the first

levels

how did that meet

his oh my large I thought it was a big

area of effect but it missed anyway you

wanna

it's one of the yeah it's 11 here

there's Colossus

all right yes I have

I have to do hundreds no work nope

okay and the whips warp inspiration

sorry about that you did not disturb me

but I wanted to disturb you

are now a minute oh come on Mitch why

don't you tell me about ants beforehand

if you make me look behind

it's just that when asked plays when

there's a

and there's a raid going

it's just it just makes me look greasy

oh a large amount of people let's play

ads for him not I don't I don't try to

do that

honest it just happens I just

accidentally happened

which just didn't tell me that was not

upcoming ends

I should be able to do this

game doesn't show me what I'm doing

foreign

okay

there we go that's 11.

89 enemies that huge thing oh no it

didn't didn't die until you looked at it

there's a painting that's also how the

skin works

there we go

America

okay so against the second match I need

a perfect score I can't let a single

goal in but it's very hard to do

considering

while considering the my goalie is is is

on the

considering

come on spider hey when it's hard to

pick up the perk in the first place

the two my my goalie is on the upper

opponent opposite team

and my goal is passing the park

and three I don't know let's add another

thing that is amazing Oh look The Girl

is good

all right three my goalie sucks is

defending the code

[Music]

watch me die I want to die unless you

watch me yeah that's

that's so much when you're not looking

at enemies they are not in action yeah

let's see the boss bosses are always

something

[Music]

thank you

I mean this is a valley I mean

ignoring the part I put in the parking

mouth

is certainly another Valley moon but if

you have if you lead in the park and

just push it into the goal and not

actually shooting that should still be a

valid Zone

oh

my God

well done have this where are you done

I only have these

okay now

I just can't let any Fancy in

can't even shoot him

so

one girl

is

if you if you have the book on your

stick and you put the stick into your

mouth

[Applause]

[Music]

you have there is certain illegal move

to enter in and take the golden point

it might be

right

you're passing the park back and forth

is the bucket

oh thank you

there we go three guns

three girls three girls

I think also it's illegal to shoot

fireballs

but

I could be wrong about that

how about that

I mean technically I don't think the

rulebook says anything about shooting

Fireballs though

[Applause]

hey crochet

foreign

[Applause]

[Music]

hello Marco

so I'm done here

what's the what's the next challenge

they have for me

right your heels let's go meet some

phones you like phones don't you

hmm

it's a mark Marco Mouse emotes

Marquee mode monkey mode

Autumn planes America Mouse is a cute

mouse

quick

beep

that's that's the bunny sound

but yeah I don't think there are any

rules against breaking fire against your

opponent yeah I don't think I think yeah

I wouldn't be surprised if there's no

specific rule that says that

beating a large Fireball that knocks out

your opponent

is an illegal mode

however

maybe maybe because

um according to the rules in

international lock at least if you make

an attack link that causes the opponent

to bleed that's an automatic finding

penalty

um

however it might I don't know it I don't

know if you specifically a tackle or if

it's like

anything you do to an opponent

[Music]

s

hello goodbye

[Music]

and this is easy

but for some reason this I like it can

break I don't think they can break in

300 though

pink pink pink pink

pink pink pink

and you didn't die from seeing one of

those

Dubai

I was surprised I didn't know how to

speak anyway

okay is one of these is a line

oops I got the other one too

okay now

let's give you some of things

estimated

sorry yeah let's just get rid of all of

these because I'm annoyed at them

I don't need to get rid of them but you

know

they are big and ugly

and that's all that matters yeah

so I need to do three laps okay

yeah I'm breathing fire and breaking

fire it's not breaking fine what can

some kind of English expression that I

just didn't know about

oh thank you

I hope you find Pom-Pom kit I try to

make a kit I'll go back to this form

this is my form today

and turn fare

more bulge wait

do you know that's what

pressed into pancake

another time to stuck again let's Point

them for him yet I 20K points nothing

yeah I know I know Benny

be quite many

don't mention the points

like no no but

no seriously I

I know I don't have any themes but

I don't really have anything oh wow

I don't really have any redeems to make

at the moment I'm going to make

yeah I need to speak to you so you don't

I accidentally triggered it

but uh yeah I don't mean anything mean

to you Benny but

um

yes I'm

I'm going through a tough time at the

moment

and which is why I have scaled down

certain uh certain features on them on

the on the on the stream and that's why

a lot of the redeems are missing

and then

oh I'm waiting my okay

I'll go take that out on the beach

and

I said balls

it may be gamble it's fun and addictive

so can you can it so you can camel

points you don't get to see

and what would you

okay let's let's say let's say this then

do you want to gamble

let's Gamble

[Music]

here is the

uh here's the first Gamble

and

how many

failed perfect runs against

all bosses

let's count count up all bosses in

together

because the process will be pretty easy

with this with with this power up but I

can still make mistakes

so here we go

so the tool is basically I have to

defeat all three buses those are three

separate uh three separate skill points

but this this prediction is about all

three so I'll count them together

and I have the fireball power up an

infinite amount of time infinite use and

the Fireball the fireball power can be

used against bosses

um

so um yeah

how many times will I fail to do the

perfect a perfect run is not taking any

damage from the point I start start them

to start the fight I can I get it

picking up uh killing a sheep and

getting butterfly does not count and

they are measuring if you're taking

damage

and

these ease yeah I have I hope I'll do it

with ease

okay hold on

there's the prediction instincts are

only a point if you want

anything can be easy

okay

but I'm only a bunny oven

who knows how many mistakes everything

this was still count

did it now let's see haven't left said

done I think I've done two laps

that might have just been one I think

that was two

okay that was the only one this is two

and now when I run across that seeing

the uh

the skill points should appear

I'm gonna be good at this

and still points there we go that's the

skill point

Tana

now we can exit this level

yay tattoo attempts

hey

all right they have Kennedys in the

wrong order

because I missed uh

why is that thing I was supposed to do

in

the first world

so back to the first one

[Music]

of my price the second one you people

are crazy

[Music]

18455 but points were were perfect

perfect run

5.80 points for just doing one or two

mistakes

thousand points ensues to find mistakes

this is going to be interesting

[Music]

a single person needs other people are

free to join as well

no one has said six plus points yet and

of course for anyone curious I'm saying

it every time if no one wins a

prediction this goes for every single

prediction I make I will simply return

on point because I don't want to throw

away at once but if but if there's at

least one person who can win the points

and then that person will win the points

thank you

I wanna destroy it I want to destroy it

um apparently this can be stand by you

okay take care Knight you are my points

in your hands yeah you'll you'll I'll

let you know

I'll write it on this Discord server

opportunistic 10 points yeah yeah

because they put the amount the points

only determines how much you will win

against other people who go to the same

thing as new

so if you vote one point or a million

points it's the same

if you're alone

of course it's more fun if you add more

points of course

lowest amount you can vote is one

I know

not everyone might know

but I guess I was speaking to you

I don't believe in gambling and constant

care for it

how do you not believe in gambling

gambling exists

gambling with real money I understand

that you you don't want this but it is a

big Point big money it's random points

that yeah that are generated while

you're watching

that you can't spend in a story

you can't sell them for real money

I mean technically I guess I

I guess technically I could have a

redeem which you can redeem

everything you can redeem

uh what where are you where when you

redeem it I'll send money to you

but

yeah I don't see why I would do that

that seem a bit silly

actually delays it can because I can't

get between one and ten points yeah

it is fun though it's about one point

let's still win everything which I've

done

there we go that was the only entity

can I do this

no it's taking too long

and I can't press I'll be that many

support status

I mean if you don't like anything

[Music]

commenting

the points to real money man that might

not be

[Music]

it might be against the ruins

but what if I reward you with a with a

coupon and this coupon you can convert

you can give back to me and I will hand

you much

but for some reason I've seen the skill

points in

I really feel like the skill points in

because I've done all the skill points

in reunited for some reason I feel like

they're different here than they are in

the United I don't know why

this is the Japanese gambling all over

again

I don't know what that refers to

[Music]

it's just Adam I must remind them about

the festival that was wasn't allowed to

sell water

so what they did was to sell peanuts a

single peanut and with the peanut you

get a water included

which you could argue is still selling

the water because you

because the water was not free

so

wait how am I supposed to

[Music]

wait it's not

what am I supposed to do

oh

these sweets

oh he's trying to eat me oh you did he

bite me

wait what am I

since they have cheap history cameras

okay

but can you can you gamble from Japan

okay so there is one animation when you

knock this so I should basically lock

every tree

or Cannon

I can do that

I think

oh yeah I need to

work there you go

I hear Japanese

it might have a facilities where you go

use crane games get prices you can sell

next door

oh but I mean you can at least keep

those because I was thinking about that

too

how you could um

how I could give you an item and that's

and then

and then you could sell off the item and

get money

but I need that selling of the item

that's okay work but

I guess in this case

yeah

in this case they are buying back the

items to use in the next train game

so

so I made an animation playing out for

every tree

but maybe I need to also knock

three up here but yeah here's a

non-monkey tree

are there more non-monkey trees yes

there's another one yeah I definitely

these three definitely looks different

oh there's another one it's a good point

no yes

well I got the skin point because I am

self-skinned

okay you can't press up

he gives people fun and if

oh my

on pontiffs

[Music]

and then there is a

yeah definitely then well I'm climbing

then is this lemon

oh

where I needed to destroy every cagedy

oh no

cactus

is through all the characters

[Music]

now I can use fire against you oh your

head flew up I'm sorry about that

anymore

oh that's a threesome animation

but

didn't like this I mean I'm gonna

destroy the car

yeah I should have a

stop laughing at me

what if I'm invincible and having

Fireball well

you can't reach me from them dead

that's me some more crack this up here

point

point

oink practice

point

hmm

no nice spider

no survives by oh that was close

to dying

now I'm in mean spot and with a [ __ ]

Tower

I'm dangerous now

now I was hoping to find like a cactus

in here I guess it makes sense to listen

one but

you never know where this

things likes to live

How can I

yeah

Mr [ __ ] distance

oh

I'm stupid

[Music]

daddy today

bulge music

she said bulge

maybe someone is at the start

right bunny that's funny playing yes

Dragon there we go I miss one and stuff

you get the fried bunny when you play it

reignited with the Pom-Pom mod I want to

do custom animations for not going to

require a lot of work but

it would be fun so I can have the ears

move

apologize no no

a sink can bulge in many different ways

it does not have to be something lewd

[Music]

[Music]

oh yeah I need to do the Speedways

so

in my PC with this power update

I I need to do this in one minute 15

seconds

at least at most I meant

[Music]

you only knew others can't say

not wrong but I am leaved I'm a fan for

me this is an 18 plus Channel

we can be a bit

raunchy or whatever you think I certain

degree

you don't do overboard

they can we can make jokes just don't

don't get to

descriptive

if that makes sense

we are missing bags

while they are here

oh I'm doing so bad

and then my concept is cheating

here we go

and this part

no spider what are you doing

I'm doing so bad

I just shoot

just shoot yeah I need to start over

[Music]

but you don't draw my lead energy out

yeah

no

I'm a soda game

what yeah yeah you're

it's only sometimes there might be

so much through testing

but yeah I'm

I am to be very more cute than I believe

I'm actually cute I don't even thinking

I mean that wasn't the most efficient

way of doing it but a little quicker

than last time I must say I think

they can't do this but maybe I should do

this way oh I'm sorry it's fine

you'll do it oh God I'm missing so much

[Music]

so bad

yeah

nice

for your time best time

wow that was that slow last time what

time let's say I wanted now

1 15.

it sounds interesting

dude's thumb is beautiful

okay it's a definition to be like a

thick and Squishy

yeah I don't

like him

this kind of speed I was wearing they

basically don't give me an option to

experiment but

they don't they don't let me choose what

to start with because it basically teach

me

to where's the one thing

we're starting

yeah now

um so now wait I'm doing

this doesn't matter which one attack I

forgot about that

foreign

no I have to get one minute 15 seconds

so yes I had to beat this time but

specifically one minute 15 seconds

and here's what that has a Beat

um

I mean lots of physics that's not a

truth of your bounce missing

wow you bounce too much

right that doesn't work

well I didn't mean to go to town

yeah just I just can't get that one

[Applause]

yeah see you have to take the birds

first otherwise that seems closed

they really really don't allow you to

just do it your own way

I'm happy range I just want to do a

different way but I'm not allowed to

me I think I missed the birds

with everything I was cheating

there you go

where Mr bird

yeah I know it's bad I'm missing yeah

yeah it's saying the camera if you can

distracted by Mr Burns anyway

that's it forgot about that birds

I think I got that bad

yeah I'm gonna get this bread

now it's possible to get best times

I know I know it's I can't do it in one

minute 15 seconds because

doing anything

okay that was like I've seen snowing

I bet I had good taste it when yeah I

was spending way too much time on

okay

well I did it in one minute 12 seconds

but I missed the gate

so it didn't count

when I got the parents

wear last evening

okay can I

remember the gate this time

maybe you're supposed to go this way I'm

mixing everything I'm so bad at this

better

I'm so that was terrible

just listen to the bunch of Champions

for today date

please just watch it below so why are

they so

bring me some rice

okay yeah I don't think they're dying

coming honest they're getting

hit by five like I guess in that case

yeah that

nice I missed

okay

what are you turning around spider this

isn't the hair stain okay it turns kind

of whatever he wants

applies by the fly

okay here we go well I did it start to

give you thanks for my TV

well I did it under one minute and 15

seconds

[Music]

let's go to the next Speed Run Speedway

[Music]

it's a party in the chat

celebrating cheating

shaking for some reason because

shivering

Rave with RGB

celebrating

and it's just a bunny that has had

enough of the celebrity

oh

explain why this is icy Speedway

which is also one minute 15 seconds this

one should be easy

I have them first and I'm ruining their

lives

all right I keep missing these

I'm not doing so well at the moment

all right

come on crash into nothing

this is bangers it's really United

we can't see anything the camera is

pointing down

[Music]

why where's the rest of the gate

more stressed of the gates

[Music]

I didn't complete this before but now

I'm confused

this is easier to

be easy to see

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

what's up

foreign

[Applause]

please

there we go that takes two of them

[Music]

we're gonna take all day as you like

well I got everything it's just it's a

and it's better time it's yeah

definitely this way the front spy run

yeah I'm doing very I mean miss

everything

maybe I should just shoot him

maybe I shouldn't shoot them because I

feel my my is isn't what

my stuff why is that what's so hard

again

foreign

okay so I guess I need to take out them

in the air first whenever easy

to take care of this innocence

wow that worked

perfect

I'm surprised that worked

no oh man

oh

I was doing so well

yeah okay so we go around one what

happened

finally

[Music]

finally I'm doing that so terribly

all right

I didn't make a noise that wasn't

chewing

so 15 seconds to get that one of these

first thing is left

[Applause]

which would have made five more attacks

ever since September

but it was quick here by two seconds but

yeah

yeah so if I just don't do like the laps

yeah as you can see

it's anytime anytime now

not this way

no I still miss them

oh yeah I still miss them

I'm just disturbing not hitting them

yeah

I lost

um

awful login I'm just doing so tired of

me

no come here

don't get away from me

oh there's one

amazing

[Music]

[Applause]

and time seven

[Applause]

that was the worst today

[Music]

no that wasn't hate that panty

there you go

oh I don't think so man

thank you

all right I don't care about you

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

a bit annoying but I missed another one

the same ones

all right keep up

my attachment and

yes I I

sometimes I miss them

when I feel like

always stomach

anyway

[Music]

right yeah it definitely goes better now

thank you

not

[Music]

and then I don't know which way I should

go maybe it's fine come on come on

oh yeah that was a waste of time

[Applause]

oh man my hand is that around when I hit

this physical lighting with everything

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Applause]

whoa I did it uh when it comes to the

top of the arch so I almost missed that

one again

oh I did it

mainly attempts

oh

[Music]

[Music]

two more spin the waist and then I can

do the bosses

[Music]

lifting many attempts

I was a disappointment to myself right

moments where I should have gotten it

but

I've done it but I faint

not not bus yet

Speedway is

can

[Music]

Ocean Speedway

so this is one minute and 10 seconds

[Music]

yeah I don't think I was supposed to go

this way

or was it

no I don't think I'm supposed friends

definitely not that means that much

thank you

and keep missing me

performance oh nice they can send my

homie

oh there it is

20 seconds just now

wait

all right it's ten one minute 10 seconds

that was quick game when I messed up

I messed up so much when I try this one

remember I'm supposed to whoa

whoa

foreign

this is a thing

if I end up here

the man is supposed to go

let's jump back here okay I see

one of those kids

let's see if I can do that again

how many more skill points it's um to

Speedways and then it's bosses

[Music]

right

so I guess that a secret gain which

there is such an amazing game

it's something I would play

and on

no jump away

tomorrow I did say this in the past that

I don't want to start like a new game

only second

payoff

of like this double bass supreme but

let's ignore it

and we've gone back on that I

restriction

shoot the boat why am I missing the

boats

why am I so tired

this this is slow

apparently but really really good box

all right

oh this oh my how have I been quick yet

is how much

I was gonna say my cars I misread that

is yes

I am a regular bunny today and I'm

failing this isn't Speedway

fine

hello water bunny

hello Waterbury

come from

here we go now I got some Temple here

let's tell me about some really hard to

eat

I made me think about it I remember

still missing the boat

so I got 20 seconds to do the Arches I'm

a completely wrong place when I finish

the boats

about 15 seconds left

while I got into for 10 of the 20

seconds I got two arches

it's been it's been 15 seconds I've got

four arches

and it's only one second left and there

you go how long do I have

this is this bad this company correct

way of doing it

anything I'm installing creatures and

money to have a different route and

you're here as well stop following me

so water keeps track of it

what the next show to keep reading check

yeah I'm

I'm not sure

I'm at this table editing boats

[Music]

I don't know why I'm so terrible

yeah the problem is builds I'm I'm off

one actually thinking about

I am off already here

stuff on me you Stone can't wait but if

red was here before you how is way too

yeah red was here like very very early

on

so how is it random one following me

foreign

donkey

yeah it kind of reminds me of someone

telling that

they were being followed by some car

well they didn't pay much attention to

it but then I don't know how they got in

conversation with that car the driver

but the driver is complaining that they

were

and following

this person who was behind them now

every time hurts

some people can't win any

obviously

in this case it's not a joke

this week now apparently because due to

me missing passing number one

I'm now messing up everyone

I should do this in one minute 10 10

seconds or whatever and oh I got that

one for anyone joining yeah I fail at

the one I wanted anything seconds this

is very very hard and this is the first

speed wing

parking the driving yes driving at a

reported that they were they wasn't

trying to be what's behind them

throughout

a longer period and then the driver

would be complained that driver a was

following Darby

even the driver B was going the same way

as was behind or anything

because I start ignoring it

stop going great

because yeah he doesn't make no sense

without cleaning services

come on

now I am

well I did it

only six 30 seconds to spy

well I did it

I found a way of roughed it

was only a single Speedway left and then

it's the Boss Rush

let's go

yeah I think here no nothing here are

the bottoms

winter Tundra

for the final Speedway and these are

those in one minute 10 seconds but

hopefully it's easy

because I'm working and lurking and

working but you have to write a message

then water it doesn't count if you don't

write a message

I'm starborn the impossible level

wait I was supposed to go in here

yeah

instead one

yeah

and if you are truly lurking you would

have participated in the prediction

okay one one minute 10 seconds

oh come on

yeah I like Pinkberry but I understand

I've done these pink slime

and then I

I ran around and do the parents

oh

and then I do

because

oh

no no come on

stop

here there we go

if I didn't miss that one to do it like

55 seconds or something another quite a

good record

and and last time I got one minute ten

seconds something just above the

required time

I already knew what they would show

himself eventually he waited Patiently I

wish

of course of course what they would show

up on the bunny stream why wouldn't he

water has uh obligation if that's the

word to show up on each pontoon stream

at some point

okay let's do the bus rush now are you

ready

let's count the faint attempts of doing

perfect runs

that's what their prediction is about

fail perfect runs against all bosses is

the prediction

okay impatiently consistency

consists constantly con consistent and

didn't think

I'm sitting here squirming waiting

she was so excited when he finally

showed them

so you could say you're you're stalking

me Vine

[Music]

and when it finally got to stay Stayed

you you were so happy

Crush dungeon let's do this

let's see how many fail attempts I will

have

oh let's go

whoa okay that's it what I like about

spider is that the Bell does not begin

until I start moving

and

apparently you can only see that

animation once

all right you want this one

wait I was gonna say wait but then you

take time with you and that so we take

damage

this boss is the only boss you don't

deal with damage to

oh that was close

foreign

I think

yes

and then I started chasing too

yeah I'm going to slam at some point

I'm so close

there you go

one more

I don't want to get in now

well well now I hate to avoid this

go on there you go

wow skin points okay

boss one zero face

The Voice play runs he's not even

looking where he's going

yeah yeah he's gonna he points his head

down so he has his voice forward

[Music]

okay

yeah I think I wrote One bosses since

one in action right

I think I made it very clearly doesn't

know

this was a Boss Rush

once more

it will be too much it's more in them

but

or do you want to see me do it again

[Music]

um

yes

let's go to the next one

well let's have a look this this one's

pretty easy now

when I brought once more and one crochet

one hit many okay okay

all right please let's go

damn that

oh the Bears are coming I think it was

too

see your face

yeah I knew that still wouldn't be zero

that would be weird if I didn't get zero

on that one

it's in the thing with cheating

and finally and because

fin finally drifted was by this one

is the one that can cause many issues

so let's hope for the best

ripta's Arena even though it's not trip

to Serena

who owned this place before I mean Laura

said that she was like

it out of her castle or something maybe

that memory that's

uh on this place

no yeah there you go

and there's no one thing

so that's not an option and

one only sorry about that body bags only

with some evicted oh yeah but Laura said

something of being evicted too

yeah this doesn't know something

here we go

more careful this time and now it's it's

this again and this this round this is

another

is another one of teeth

[Music]

oh there we go moving on here

oh okay I got the fire power up here

[Music]

well that was close it hit the camera

I'm getting used to a few things

oh no whoa that one also clicked the

camera

when you see okay this is

come on come on come on yay

I got it I hear the sound that means I

did not get hit one fan until 10.

well this is

points running do you want to find them

so I guess he did spend them now

well there we go

red congratulations

you won

how do you feel

you get your

5480 points back how many points in his

name in token we got 18 000 manifest

Fire Plus

1000 plus 10. so you will win your

points back plus an additional 19 465.

here we reach now in

one to two fades

be sure that one to two faces connect

it's easy correct

yeah we don't need liquids again let's

give the credits yeah this time I can

because everyone didn't see me

Patrick yes who mine does a lot of work

but I really thought hitting lips I

think

you know what

let's go and hit crypto anyway

wait

yeah yeah hitting ripped is I think

It's the final thing I have to do

so let's go and

hit the rift away

which is in some Forest but

in the summer forest living organisms

dismissed

all right you forgot to save

it's all the same email

oh yes I see something good again

without saying no no I still have one

more and one more skill point

I didn't go for it because that would

ruin the Run of course

and after the video boss I was put into

winter anyway

so I went though

[Music]

I can't run come on how much I'm gonna

fail there

[Music]

I'm not going to quit the game without

saving points

you

flash Okay so

in this Barrel

in this ball I could have stated that

okay for the first round I'm going to

hit rip do not doing the challenge let

me do that so I can get these skill

points but then I don't remember that

was a thing

often

here we go

anyway I can leave this area now

thank you

I got one

discount points I think I got one of

them

this should be

um

Let's uh let's check

how many skill points there are in the

game first

and they should be

16 so let's see if I have 16.

I think

let's turn to asking points

one that is against the level is

one two three four five six seven eight

nine ten

and it tells them it would be 16. well

done and now we've got the epilogue

Group found a new life at this Society

wings

I mean

I know he has like a con he's he's like

inventor and has made like constructive

wings and I guess that's what it really

looks like his hands

are melting into the wings

there you go that proves that I have now

complete the spider when it technically

in the proves by three because I only

talk early but

I did one goes through all these skill

points so I had completed this part two

was probably three to 100 properly now

and I'm happy about that

[Music]

Mr Fiesta name yep

and this no

[Music]

it sure is a name and um

Sparks is blue wait when did I take

damage

[Music]

well

I've been going for three hours and like

20 minutes

23 minutes 24 minutes

so I think that's good enough for today

that means I would play the new game

tomorrow

don't ask me why I'm still keeping it

secret

I will continue today now just because I

did it it's not it's not a fantastic

game it's probably very obscure game

that no one heard about it and um

[Music]

it was a noise system

you want to visit

okay problems is going to start doing

art now and we don't have one watching

so I think it would be really nice to

like show up at the start of the stream

you know getting up getting a jump start

at the start of the stream I think

that's a very nice thing to do

I like it when it happens to me the

whole problem was appreciated

well son I enjoyed watching see

something in Swedish

I don't know it's a bit it's a bit weird

right now because in my situation

nothing against you but

um

when is let me quickly just check the

now what yeah and let me quickly check

the schedule

uh four prongos

because it would be nice to not raid at

this startup screen but

oh it's technically scheduled for

another

it's scheduled to not start by another

35 minutes I don't think it's going to

be a 35 minutes

that countdown before it starts

um

I have no idea

so um

now the art team seems to like

started random times it doesn't seem to

be any

[Music]

specific time it starts at

that they give some problem to

promise yeah that's a plan

uh

you know it's like five minutes of

startup time uh how long has been like

two three minutes so it's like two

minutes left

I estimated

to be honest

no I said I was going to create problems

started

let's go let's go let's go do the

cheering do animals what do we do

what do you think what do you want to do

I don't know

I like the hype ones

[Music]

I like that one for this time but you

can choose whichever you want and I like

the height one

I mean this is just art

I haven't switched

that no switch screen sorry already

uh economics to

yeah I don't have anything you want to

say here progress recognized the way

they think you thank you very I hope you

have a great night but when it's

interesting thank you everyone thank you

so much fairly yes and we'll continue

talking on this survey

we can always use the exclamation points

Discord that you make Adventure

let's go

thank you
