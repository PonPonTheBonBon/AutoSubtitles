Hello

friends it

is it is i p

p let's

see all everything set up

[Music]

correctly

don't

[Music]

pranking

when does an

expectance may I

should we set it up

correctly

think that should work hopefully she up

on screen but I just go and get my

drink

so is that

working oh it's the a not

on where's the AUD there you go now now

the audio is

on great start of the

stream okay let's start the in

through this is the challenge where I'm

not F otherwise I cannot pick up a game

great start of

thing not prediction what do you want to

predict bu bu

at ukah ukah is free no it's it cannot

be evil great evil has come ass from

dying Oh you mean like none have D to

fail to break hookah even once but you

cortex you have failed me okay start

great Uka it was that infernal Bandicoot

from deep inside my temple present how

far can I get before I die instructions

to follow but you lost the gems you lost

the crystals and I have lost my patience

there is now no other power source left

on this planet I no we've had a few

unfortunate setbacks and failed but

since your bumbling has managed to set

me free I am

feeling

still way for us to amass the power

needing to enslave this miserable planet

and this time this time the great ukah

will make sure that you do it right

after many eons my evil twin ukah ukah

has been freed from his underground

prison long ago I locked him there to

protect the world from his malice now

free once again he must be

sto I don't know what to

do children ukauka and cortex plan to

use this time did you get to gather

crystals that lay scattered across time

I have brought you here to recover the

crystals before they do so to open the

time portal simply stand on a button and

then jump into the portal Good

Luck Good

Luck well I

mean I can't have people doing

prediction when I'm doing the

challenge

let's do the S because that's a long

process for some

reason I put this

thing

my lunch was a bit late

though now I finish my

lunch well then that's

um same the game before I done anything

p o

n p o

n

done there you

go p

p and a pie of the work room which you

will never ever see how it

is

oh

that's all levels I closed out and the

prediction work

wa yeah yeah sometimes it's like that

you probably have to restart the uh

stream or the whole app with prediction

is started however no one else is

predicting at the moment so I guess I

mean I said I'm not going to do the

challenge I don't like to do like the

challenge while the prediction while

people can submit

stuff we do have six watches what this

eight just a second

if people are not interested in taking

part of the

addiction

then I'll just continue without

it like I know red has taking part of it

and but no one else has therefore either

red wins and get all of his points back

or he loses but no one else wins that

way all points are

returned it's as if there's no

prediction you

know I

it video monster okay I'll do Hy rate

take part of the prediction otherwise I

will close

it otherwise I will delete

it so I can begin the

game it's been 5 minutes of the

prediction so far so but thank thank you

masterer

for doing it I should yeah yeah I should

add

um that red dragon has got the first

now breaking Oran streak of

one red thought his streak of one there

go now we got some people that the wrong

window oops anyway hello

hello okay that's

it no more predictions

let's

go so the

village wasn't it the no it was a turtle

Forest is the first level in Crash 2

crash crash crash Why luck in my mud I'm

I have a mask helping me too we will

find out which one is more powerful soon

enough cortex I'm not mocking in

anyone's mod I don't even know how to

mock let's have a let's have put up a

sign that says no

mocking okay R of the challenge is

pretty

easy if I die in a level that means that

I can no longer off to that point pick

up gems it's following the crash one

rules not exactly but

almost in CR run you can die if you pick

on let's do last set up if I pick up

something before I before I die why

can't I just jump on this a few

times if I pick up something before I

die the first time in the level I I get

to keep it it kind of follows how Crush

one does with the uh keys but because in

crush

one uh the keys does not require you to

be alive until you reach them as far as

I

know and you get the bo Dam the level I

could make it harder by having to rule

that I have to not die if I to even exit

the level something like

that I think that's maybe too

[Music]

much I still have to not die to get the

box gems I still kind of have to

complete level not die I inan that

sense this game introduce the counter

for how many boxes there are in total I

like crash

two pick up every single

fruit there go there's 73 of them unless

there

randomized it runs as it says not like

levels because if I have to do a level

again it countes as another run

hopefully I should not have to redo this

level okay bo bo

bo there you go that's all of

them finally I know I missing I need I

need my knes should get some knes at the

start of the game I can reach

99 here we go that's I got it without

dying disappeared in a puff of

smoke oh

[Applause]

no I lost the

mask that was close that was one run one

R you

[Music]

that means that I'm in

the one H in one two range at

moment do the L in order I mean that

seems the most

Fair unun master the gem

together thank

you actually I'm

beat a beat experience in the crash

games

no oh stupid attack not attacking the

shock you can spin without moving

forward

good good good cuz I don't want to

intentionally die

[Music]

obviously there's a shark here there it

is almost by

it

okay

doing doing the red Jam in this game is

going to be a

challenge

boom

okay what the that's St oh missed

it ah missed

it something bling I

Shar there we

go not the biggest fan of water levels

they

are where is it there it is aha don't

catch me then let it float down so you

can go around

it

yes now I can shoot

you oh why can't I get the

Contin this sure likes to move

forward he going to shoot like

crazy

okay I got

it

oh yeah take a

mask let's destroy that so it doesn't

destroy

me P Pon killed an innocent shark they

aren't inent if they have the intention

of eating me they aren not

[Music]

inent or do you want me to like die by

them first here we

go got another gem that's two runs still

in the one two

range I'm kind of more experienced with

this game then crash

[Music]

too oh no Orient

Express this the first time we get to

play as

Coco Cocos has the following moves walk

jump that's it you can't do anything any

other but you can look at your inventory

but anything

else why does it show this on screen

when I'm trying to

play and the B here I say chin I would

say Chinese they do not say Chinese they

say great

one are you saying pon pon doesn't want

to be eaten I don't want to be eatan

[Music]

see if I can do this in one

run

cuz I assume I shouldn't like

intentionally

die alter do not I I'll not

intentionally

[Music]

die but that means I have to do a lot of

runs in this level you

know there's a problem with this kind of

challenge but I'll I'll just do one run

don't worry I'll do

it okay sure what you could say that's

why I should do levels instead of runs

that's

fair

well and that's a fair reason but then I

but then is that I shouldn't redo a

level because that risk me not

increasing the level counter yeah but

still risking

dying so I get this

now easy way to do this but not problem

look at this that's only about

this

wao no problem put

Pon or ponon if you

want

I'm not that fat I don't we at

all and P pon pon coko does not

celebrate she just walks away in

silence I think she has one line of

dialogue and cortex one tiny get

crystals and bring them to Big Coliseum

in Rome crash leave them for tiny or

crash it

crash cash get

crushed going all the way to

Rome if I wish time you told me place

but not time this is a this is a time

machine with teleportation P I need to

know

which I know the location colos room I

do not however know this

time he is somewhere in room but I don't

and he's

somewh there you go now got that joking

here

good

good another mask thank

you

I don't

need do H I think I needed red gem to

get box box this

Amo I can get these 40 lives

but oh I forgot to write three runs

oops this means I don't need to do the

bonus but I might need extra lives I'll

do the bonus with extra lives

cuz I could skip a bonus because you

know bonuses don't count St all right

three runs now so I

don't forget

that that means I'm now in the 35

range

wa you can't move on each but you cannot

do any moves you can't spin you can't

duck Crouch

I okay activate that I have not died yet

so I can pick up

that there we go I think I can reach it

anyway

but I think a bonus is located here in

the next Dino

level Dino

level tou the

cross oh yeah this one has nice yeah she

stand and bounce on

it oh who those are green don't touch

the green

boxes oh you got the gam anyway

okay so the red red pass does not have

boxes okay so it's the hell PES okay

apparently I don't know everything about

this

game and I played through this game like

twice on the

stream and I'm still still messing up

but that was four

mons this is play some boxes SP back

here

and I think I mentioned

it when I played this with the no

powerups run that they should flip the

red and yellow and make the yellow white

unless this is a standard in boting or

something because

red is on the right and white is on the

left when it comes to reflectors in

Europe sure it's yellow not white here

but

still

well good thing I had a

mask oh I should be to get that box at

least I don't need to worry about the

bomb anymore more there we

go oh yeah there we go now I can

go the waves does not make it

[Music]

easy oh

k

I got it without

[Music]

dying no no run into two

pumps not this bad at the Devil

okay done so much better when I play the

remake

is this level going to be the level of p

on N I'll do

this

no

what one over

turning

a why do I keep missing that

box

[Music]

I

need how many got around that

[Applause]

pH oh

[Music]

Waves okay time to do the boss

then this is 11

right crash coo store the pretty

crystals tiny take them back in

Gladiator Arena who did I still steal

them from they were just out there in

the open one of them was like out there

in the

ocean I mean someone probably own it

but I don't know It's

Tricky who owns them

I can hand them back just let me know

who else then cortex is not one of them

who owns

them can I argue he originally

stolen okay to many

tigers

now you can't Sease The Boss by not even

fighting the Tigers but what fun than

[Applause]

that all right it C through the

tagy I why do I keep calling them

TIG yay standing on

him

weird hit

Bo yeah we knew

that ah yes Tigers the T

naturaled I mean

maybe in case someone does not count the

B well done children by defeating T you

have unlocked the I'm not next time

travel area go back to the center of

this time twister and Save save your

progress if you wish from there you will

see that the gate to the second time

travel area is now open to the second

time travel

area he

speaks everyone else speaks full speed

except h a not

okay well

done go back to the time travel area and

and I can't I can't not do

his well

done and G

win I don't know why I started reading L

names I when I didn't do that from why

you continue to be a thorn in our side

what where was I tiny was a good fellow

he hated everyone and everything but a

good heart nonetheless please be more

reasonable with my minions next

[Music]

time well I mean if we don't fight in

the first place that would you

know okay level

six

bam not sure what you need the upgrade

and then get these but I guess the

upgrade does like inform you about the

existence of the

move

[Music]

boom take the mask just in

case

boom I was spinning

what this and it

happen is this that I'm going to die

in I don't for one boss

so at Le technically six rounds

already Mage exploded on you ah and not

in a fun way

ah yes I see the Mage noticed that he

was had no chance to get crash so he in

his last effort he decided to

[Applause]

explode I was watching a YouTuber who

said that that crash 4 introduced a new

move but that inste next the box and

spin and you break the bottom box yes

that's a completely new moving crash 4

never seen before

[Music]

here's another

Mage hey I'm going to ignore you

[Music]

now wa W swing careful around the green

box

then

[Music]

okay I'll take

[Music]

this no don't run away I wanted you to

be

exploded oh I did that

again really oh

[Music]

no that was close Okay I'm going to

ignore you

again

oh the b gets refunded and know I win

yeah no one predicted anything higher

than

fine oops pwn did it again and run into

go yeah I keep doing it I keep on doing

it let see okay this game has the same

issue as crash

too fair

enough you stand this way press the

other direction is SL the wrong way I

think it fixed in remake if that was the

[Music]

thing there always been an

isue noise well don't land on that

thing here we

go boom

boom I do need to activate the other one

otherwise I don't get that

box but if it didn't exist I could have

just not activated it that would have

been more

fun is a good thing they have made sure

the zeros cannot be confused with o

because you know so I have 30 lives not

three lives and an oh at the

end cut it without

dying I almost dead can I not die by the

Cod

please

boom

gem okay this is definitely six rounds

even if you don't count the boss so now

I can safely say that the the prediction

is

over and no one

wins you all

[Music]

lose you are all Lo

losers good luck next

time yeah because of lives would

definitely be too many lives what I

didn't play so

so well yeah yeah you're

right stolen oh stolen points every

points was

returned your points will

return told me that do you want to

delete it and return the

points if you still on the app the app

is very bad at telling you when you get

points for example the you get the chest

every 15 minutes with the extra points

the app shows the wrong amount of points

you get from that you still get the

proper amount of points it just tells

you the wrong

[Music]

amount so it's possible that they told

you the wrong amount or not

anything the thief just getting them

back don't

worry

you red you are a

[Music]

villain accusing pon pon of stft

there was no Seft in the first

place you shall be punished for accusing

the princess of such a

[Music]

[Music]

thing my lips I died

you know what that

means would be kind of interesting if

you could save the ungiven points until

someone W and they get all the commity

point that would be

fine they should under this

function delete it and give a refund or

delete it and store it for the next

prediction

oops well I didn't die that count as

[Music]

death did I hear you say punish for

kissing the princess get char No I said

accusing the

princess and a this is not going to be

the

[Applause]

punishment now I need to gather my knes

again I'm a silly

inside really mean

W just high enough to can get up with a

SL

[Music]

[Applause]

J

come with

you

wait I need to start to sink and then I

did everything wrong

I

[Applause]

accidentally get to take the

gem but I

[Applause]

didn't I'm at the bonus I'm going to get

back don't

worry I get up here

[Music]

nope don't

worry

[Music]

there we go that's what I

wanted a 3X no maybe 3 or I mean that

was maybe of

course what was going be very

CL yes was it was the exact amount I

needed n it will be

hilarious oh light Spike from

nowhere yeah I think I've only missed

one of the crystals in one crash two

level in the

remake oh forgot about that

enemy oh well start

over

and that enemy found it

hilarious this lemon is sure G me a

challenge at

moment P

where oh speaking

of p no Weare pants unless you count

under

pants yeah I'm going be fun to replace

crash with pon pon

here and then having having the whole

dress shatter without

Enemy No I was plastic come on come

[Applause]

on

otherwise at least the lower part of the

this if that would be easier considering

the animation stuff I mean we would not

know if those best far

to maybe pon pon pants has already been

shreded and that's why she's only

wearing a dress and now I'm

scared

I need to stop

dying there we

go supposed to be the wrong day just

going see where I

[Music]

was F has no pains

left

pon pon has no pants never

[Applause]

has someone probably want to see pon pon

wearing like yoga pants or

[Music]

something

sh

uned yeah sadly there is no such

animation in Crash War where I'm

currently putting pon pon into so sadly

that's not going to

happen oh look I'm doing

this

who the game is

buggy o spin

turn Spa it too

early then I'm not going to get

[Applause]

I'm going get one extra life bless oh

no there we go that's three of them

instead of

four I mean

yes I wonder who would like to see pun

on in

yourap smiley face double smiley face

one on each side of the

message it does load something there it

wasn't loading

[Music]

[Applause]

Sone okay maybe I should not forget

about this

enemy okay there was one additional rule

which I

said

and then I will not use the Bazooka

either because it just makes it too

[Music]

easy

certainly no one here would definitely

[Music]

nothing h

r I'm trying to get the

boxes and Wing at the same

time cuz there's only 30 up there it's

one

more I mean 10

more oh didn't

nine

eight 7

six

five 4

three 2

1 here can I win

now I mean

three

tuned

oh I didn't win I got the

G

okay plus

take hydrate which I just did but

okay yes that's you sent

Hy it's something at

least

win now I don't need to care about the

boxes the boxes means nothing to

me they do give me first me Snak the

kniv

but

no didn't mean to hit

it yeah

went I mean once

place

whoops that's I

wi he's that's the slide it in and then

just in a single frame he has flipped

around wo

Crystal Next Level tomb

time well just add whatever outfit you

want to see p in the list of outfit the

name

hello gave me orders to bring the

crystals to them during the ice ages so

give me the goods and shove off or I'll

roast you your teeth moves weirdly but

okay so somewhere is the ice age but

somewhere is the it's the one I did not

get an answer for where should I go like

the ice AG is not a location it's a

time this this these minions are really

bad at giving

instructions how hard should it

be I guess I mean yeah sure I did ask

for the loc for the time last time but I

want the time and location how

well we'll see if the third bus is

better at

it cuz these bosses seems

incompetent

sorry sorry

I'm

typing this is an interesting

one

oops

oops okay you cannot F on

TNTs oh

you my fruit oh they still

there don't mind what I

said they go two actually

nice

one

two and like halfway to the

next when I had that before I went into

the

bonus oh I wanted to

try works with a double

jump oh

it's wait why is the controller not

working

what now

working that was

me

good Mak left back

wo I said crush

one you travel

around on a location on on some islands

crash to introduce teleportation so you

can travel to to very very varied

locations because Crush one has like a

consistent seam of jungle and machine

and

stuff but with Crush 2 with the

teleportation now we can visit many

different locations around the

world do

that but it's still like modern time

was supposed to be modern times in like

1998 or

something or 1997 I don't

[Music]

remember who see that's how you do

it the chase the

game left again Fun Life falling into

hes it seems

nah I don't like

it I will activate this this time and

now is Crash three which you do

not only through space but you can also

travel through life time because it's a

time machine but which can also shift

location too not a pure time

machine and not to spoil crash for too

much but it's like the very first PR

prise of the game so I don't think it's

like a

spoiler too much of a spoiler I

guess after the

uh this doesn't move into the wall they

squish together oh

yeah anyway but that game has Dimension

hopping or whatever you want to call it

so it

changes location

time and

dimension I'm still standing on the

platform

apparently so the question is if they

were to make crash five what what's the

next thing they would what's the next

Dimension uh which I guess it's called

even though Dimension is one of the

dimensions

first first space then then I add the

time to it and then add the dimensions

to it what's the what's the next thing

Crush five should

add why can't I jump there we go that's

all I

wanted and wow P cancel

spoil SPO is over 20y old game what no I

meant crash Bo it's about time that's

from like not 20 years

ago one the text passed what what are

you talking

about I think you were speaking of crush

too I was I'm wondering what you're

speaking of

crash one no travel travel on food no

machine crash two machine that drums use

space crash three space and time crash

four space time and dimension crash five

yeah what's the next

thing midnight

run

well said I can't die I said before I

should die to get all boxes but come die

because you

know that's against the DRS I'm not

allowed to

die no I missed

[Music]

it

oh

practic just level I know what to

expect like this one oh yeah see that's

why I have to practice

it

seems like a fair easy

level

I could have pick up the cryst I

just we got the

M you expect to mention SPO spoiling

crash two I seem to remember no I said

crash

4 CR for is about

time I can't do this without time with

D D D

[Music]

D oh I failed to pick up

that life

box just one right here to

[Music]

start there we

go got it

[Music]

not exactly sure how I should do that

other

place this one up

here

jump no I want to get one in that

case what I have to St because I got a

checkpoint

anyway I think

I think every everything else in level

one fine it's just that thing that

I oops now I lost the M that's not

good lack of a m that's not good

Benny but

nice hello Benny this level is pretty

simple

doing this game 100% is

easy it's SCE nice night nothing

happening Coco does not want to do

anything than to walk and

jump can I can I

at least at least there is

Jump let's complete crash three or PS1

with Coco your moves is to walk and

jump wonder if she can even jump over

gaps okay I cannot run jump I cannot

just jump can

I okay canot just run I oh that was

weird I can't

run and then jump as I'm falling

down no more mistakes

now so I can get to the

jam no that was a

mistake

oh where

weing we need the

jokes party I guess I guess you can make

jokes in that

case appropriate

jokes you're free

to someone is having a party

[Music]

he was that

like maybe he got tired and went to bed

dying

to sorry for cing this is because Ben is

uh tummy

bunny those three guys are on vacation

and they find a t full of beautiful

women of which one of them is pon pon I

don't think pon pon must be a part of

this joke actually one of them is not F

this game I will not use the

Bazooka that's

ni I can't

it

wow take that for me thank you

yeah I need the yellow

Jem one of them pon pon takes no it's no

no no one of them is not P I changed my

mind it was because it said beautiful

women and I like Pon is a beautiful

woman but then I realized it was a orian

joke so I changed my mind deep trouble

now I can do this deep trouble without

uh dying getting to

JM oh this is like this is the hardest

one to get without dying a s in

game I mean there is the

first the first

um and the first city level futuristic

city

level uh I was going to say future T but

that level is not part of this game

G tomorrow is the Second City level what

was the first one

called don't

remember uh hello rocket man I'm doing

The Challenge on Crash

three

so how would you do Rocket Man Would it

kind of be fun to watch you play through

two and three with this challenge you

can play the

uh PC version if you want you don't need

to play the PS1

version I think the PC version is

slightly

easier I don't

know H Crush two is like Cas two is

definitely easier with this challenge

because you

can it's it's more convenient and let's

use that turn instead because in

crash in the original piece one crash

two you cannot start a l you cannot like

get two pity mask at the

start of a level by dying 10 times we

can only get one

mask but if you start if you have a mask

on you already as you enter the level

you will get H start with two masks

because P Mas is added on top of your

regular m h so if you want to start with

double M kind of have to finish the

level I'm making sure you have a level

uh uh Mo with you as you

do

anyway this level GE CES a lot of my

attention so I will

uh very focused on

level hope that's understandable I'll

get you coming

and after I the red gam or

die think I got

everything

no not going to take any risks

here

kill

damage there we go get rid of

you I think I left one

here come on I missed

it die die die die

die here we

go okay let

me three remember it's like yesterday

yeah it's a it's one I'm very familiar

with the they start spending time with

them sexy time even until the master of

the tent shows up and sees what's going

on last CH to be in the joke

funun angry says I am the master of this

tent and this are my women for your

punishment you will be punished in a

matter the match is your occup oh

no for as your punishment you will be

punished what's the challenge yeah yeah

if I die I cannot pick up if I die in a

level unless I unless I respawn at the

start of level I can at after that point

no longer pick up Gems or

crystals but if I already picked

something up I can bring it to the end

the challenge is to get pon pon to laugh

at joke yeah good luck with that take me

out my jokes are py

he turns to the first man want your

professional I please Ober then I will

sh

you

okay but but the police officer does not

have a

gun as H one you're missing the

joke no I'm not second man sa saying I

am a fir fighter then will burn of youi

but that's but the fire fire fire

you should like wash it with water he

turns to the thir man ask what is your

profession and S get a look on his face

and says I'm a lollipop this

man then we will take then we'll put

your dick into the machine that makes

lollipop and that's game

away all that waiting and then I faing

girlfriends that would be a nice set

of girlfriends to have

right

there we

go he throws the machine off as cuz it's

all of a sudden wants to

explode okay I need to remember to kill

that that that thing that's at

the split path

because I don't want to get killed by it

again run run

run would they be okay with it h when

there are different version of H so main

me thanks

oh now I'm messing

up so like if they were to be jealous of

themselves where why is

it why is it sport where p

s are you with sport is not up

yet

anyway up then yeah I wish I had a cute

feature that is a feature of mix it up

as proven by another streamer so doing

that

for I mean I could probably let mix it

up around and doing outfit changes

one to be

honest cuz I'm not playing like games on

the computer it's just the issue when

I'm doing

like you want a hydrate okay I'll

hydrate under

water here we go

k i not

howed so can I not fail this

time let's watch where that

is H I didn't know how long ago it was

redeemed yes

uh 11 minutes

again oh

no okay so I need to kill the thing that

is

here there it

is Boom gone with you don't want to get

it by you again

already done that

mistake okay I don't need to care about

that I think I got it we

see we'll see about it when I come

back

down the need to explosion is kind of

neat no come on don't need this

anymore I should probably faced the

other the

que come on let's get

stuck there we go

oh so now I don't have to worry about

this thing unless it respawns for some

reason

B noral welcome

everyone welcome and also got some just

I just missed the

thing oh my loud I just miss the I I'm

sorry it's by

S I did it one try anyways it wasn't too

exciting I

gu I'm

sorry hello Pon you trashed me might

yeah

that was a that was a

SC I'm doing the challenge so uh if I

die I welcome everyone and also let me

let me know

how I'm watching Bic and normally I

don't know which I should call it for

short but uh you can let let me know how

it went after I left so or if you want

to tell everyone here how you've been

doing on your stream that's fine

too cuz I'm it's always

interesting bonal

SW

yeah welcome

back or should I say welcome back to

socks

instead we canot do this I'm very

concentrated on this level because this

is a very tricky level and there we go

got that one and got that

one without dying so so how's it going

bionic anomally I was going

readers and also he wrote his full shout

out that works too it's as so and Shout

out our Alias each other so that

[Music]

works one day Pon will get the jokes I

get the jokes I mean I do get them and

just just same because that was the red

jam and kind of tricky to

get should I do

like

bionic hello

Bion bionic not Bion

bionic is C secretly a bionic

game bionic

Anomaly by

anomal I triy to make a joke there but i

f

bionical anomal there we go hey I made

blue screen as soon as I hit shade

wow if you have already retrieved a

level's Crystal I know the game you

played clock when you enter for the

second floating clock but um yeah I see

saw that the game gave a bit of trouble

but

seems Seems like the game the computer

is giving me some trouble too

that's not

nice

well the timing of that one is so weird

should I wait at it or

something wa to show up some the good I

think in like question marks it probably

has some fruit nothing human extra life

for yeah it's just a question

mark

well looking for the r sham

anyway so funny when you can stand on

box Crush dances like me in the club I

want to see you in the club dancing like

that I like your your

joke bionic Nomicon B

Nomicon yeah wasted a bit of time for a

bit but made some progress at the

end oh yeah the it doesn't say like do

you manually save or does it auto save

does it not save

often has it crashed multiple

times it's not like I'm going to play

the game

anyway I guess that could be something

to

be well good thing to know when you

plays some games that can give you some

so this G this level is meant to have

the double jump and but I think I still

did this level without double jump I did

a slight jump instead and I think it was

properly playable there is a b of me

doing this whole game what every level

though with the powerups

and I

like someone who can choose to reveal

himself if they want to whoopsy that's

not so was a

jump that means I have to

TD when I where comment was B I thought

you were just going to pick up the power

apps and just not use them but no no I

ski the whole

boss the Polish stream I was watching

earlier is still at oh I mean some

people are streaming for hours or hours

if you spin T crates you get extra lives

oh thank you for the tips rocket man I

didn't know

that but I do think you need to do the

uh you need to power up to the spin

before you can do

that lots of Auto saves actually any

time you TR I lose basically nothing

that well that's good

that's the that's the fix of they knew

the game crashed patiently so the way to

fixing that just having being save

often so when it crashes you don't lose

much I mean it is a good way because you

never know when a game crashes or the

player accidentally closes the game that

can happen or something else that's

going to

happen power outdate or anything un

unexpected the semi often is still a

good

idea always here to help oh yeah I

supposed to switch over to the swimsuit

on this non swimsuit level I was

supposed to switch 5 minutes ago I

one let me

off really has to move those last

millimeters before it can release

me okay this I do have a mask let's not

waste it

on one of

those things

[Music]

again those

things well I don't need to spin those

because those are not boxes and I don't

get anything from

them well almost did it

again oops I almost did it again

I so actually I should not take the

checkpoint H so I can so if I die I

respawn at the start of level and it

does not count as

dying wa I got it

auto save won't prevent you from

accidentally deleting the save you meant

to load it

oh press a to delete the

save without any form of

confirmation I do the level kind of out

of

order I play do through this game so

many times

so let's let's mix it

up to check

okay let's mix things

up accient kind of sound that

is that was my attempt at miming the

sound oh got a box but it was no timer

on

I'm missing every mosque I don't need

MKS where I'm going I need no mask oh no

why did you run on that one you right

through the other

one so I'm not sure what would happen

there no don't bounce on

[Music]

it

that

one gold

please oh

and him excuse

me

27 okay I do need to Blue

better not wrong

Lon instead of numbers that should use

the init initials for the level so this

is the OE

[Music]

level

okay I I'll show you I can I can get

gold Mr

Box why me both boxes I Me 3 seconds

[Music]

now I got that

one okay can I get over that one there

we

go there we go how about that want to

get out of my bed for one

second there I got gold I I H

yeah if they just have split it up like

at F or

something or at h f for H then Pawn

would be on what single line instead of

two but

no that the best you got

no but it's the best I need

I don't need better than gold because

gold is only that counts for

100% time TI still time turn is

replacement for crash

once don't reach the end of the level

without

dying Miss so this I already got the

have to

do

without which I guess was a

pomies take

that ah yes I got

[Music]

it I miss this oh why do I miss so many

number

boxes

no I miss 4 seconds

[Music]

oh I missed so many so many

[Music]

now when I got to

one that was easier in to

[Music]

uh sa

fire so you're running time as you clear

levels but only the one that doesn't

require Sprint so basically Coco level

and car levels that

don't cuz I don't have Sprint

yet oh no yeah it's all those boxes I

mean all of those time

boxes hi

[Music]

Mom SP black tickle there we go welcome

spal I'm not new Mom unless you unless

you want want

the bunny mommy you want the bunny

mommy bunny

Mommy and not that kind of mommy

though same

but bunny

mmy

let think this way that's a

shortcut that's a

shortcut out of the way oh I miss 4

seconds

again 4 seconds

again

oh oh that was a tiny jump I still clear

the

bomb this is

better

[Music]

but they're not good enough I need those

4

seconds

may I say yes g l team is a

bang you are allowed to say

that yeah dummy bunny mommy would be

Co on I not

[Music]

mommy unless I mean what do you want me

to do for you

you

know I would be your dummy um bunny

mommy problem is it doesn't really work

if you want to do like the same vs like

a dummy I can be a dummy mommy bunny

bunny mommy see I said it wrong over

that's a dummy I

am people you're people I'm just keep

messing up

[Music]

dumy

funny Mommy here we

go Fe rookie man you're feeble excuse

you I'm the dummy

mommy but I'm the dummy bunny mommy but

hello I mean hi uh baby bear

got hello say hi

hi you're the dmy

mommy

Barry

no okay okay I can't you like this I

need

to evil would make a great dummy bunny

M

[Music]

probably she would be the D dummy Bunny

at least the mommy part I don't

know I prefer the other kind of

a oh look at that gra thing does that

even show up correctly in the

chat it does show up

[Music]

correctly kind of I don't know just I

mean I see

a see it's being like a sleeping okay I

4 seconds because I was looking at

sleeping cat

yikes

okay I'm missing messing up

now it does it does kind of show I'm not

sure if the the top part is broken but

the bottom part is working for some

reason oh the top part is broken for no

I don't know the cat is working at this

why line Brees working as far as I know

you're not allowed to put line breakes

in

twitch oh yeah so if evil Pawn is DB

good pwn would be be sub then oh yeah

because they're complete opposite

right

right so if so good Pawn is yeah female

that means evil Pawn is a

male oh you speak Braille I don't you

you don't speak

Braille Braille is a script you can

write languages in like the Latin script

you don't speak Latin script

[Music]

I know it's a joke

but but you know me I can't take

CHS okay I only get those 4

seconds

that one was nothing I got Z seconds

from that

[Music]

blank there we go

easy start it with

ease we

[Music]

go another

one

oops hit the edge

day oh I got the three at least but then

I messed up on the

[Music]

rest oh I got it oh I thought it was 57

seconds but it's 59 58

something B

Go Bump Bump for bumps s the

square it's actually six pumps per uh

character in uh brain unless you doing

like Japanese bra probably also to

Chinese brain oh wait I got one level

left where you have

U 12 bumps in one

character yeah I hear they're

only

I'd imagine both pawns would still be

female like both good and evil pwn is

still bunny yeah yeah but that that way

if evil that yeah but it was it was joke

on how evil if evil pwn is dumb that

would make good Pawn sub but that

doesn't mean like they're not opposite

of J like

that nice I me noise I

think BL is like the Alpha version of

Mor Cod yeah yeah alphabetic Mor codes I

guess that makes sense Pokemon RSE e

made you learn

brain

RC Ruby Sapphire

Emerald does this work in this

game come on

yes no there was one there I didn't see

it team m

there is an idea to

play Pokemon on

stream I have no experience playing

Pokemon

though my goal is to

beat game using nice waste of time

there beat the game using a cute

team

can I can I can name the Pokemon after

the people in

chat Hi

Five we could go with like voting for

which Pokemon to use or or I just pick a

cute one and name that one pon pon and

pretend pon pon is the Pokemon that

leads

team okay this time I'll pay attention

to

you what get me that

[Music]

time come on Crash swing swim like your

life depends

on oh didn't

destroy

oh oh

in we should be able I mean St he should

be able to sneak around there but not

when he mess

up hurry crash hurry hurry hurry

gold

and I without dying I

mean I need to mess up a few

times I think that should be the Tim

before this

it only had rers never got to experience

anything but to grow

on the yeah Pokemon Ruby only allowed

you to use grow down as your Pokémon and

nothing

else pon pon evolves into evil pon pon

with

moons why

moons but if we will p p face she gets

turned

back oh oh ANS s everyone who has to

suffer to the ANS oops add one more

typing of

them so that's three I should be able to

this is the that one

level the picture of this

level yeah I see what it is first time I

looked at it it looks like oh look at

those those pine trees in the background

now those are boxes and some Green Hills

behind really made made it look like

pine

trees I had Sapphire I never had a

Pokemon game of my no wait I do I have

Pokemon of the

xmy

anyway it's an idea to play through

every Pokemon game from start to finish

not I

mean what would 100% be I mean what's

all the

Collectibles that the game actually

counts far know like the first game has

all

Pokemon and the

uh the badges I guess are the only thing

that game counts badges need to be able

to like finish the main

story which I guess kind of like how

every Pokemon game works at least the

first some of

them of every single

Pokemon then there is the

Pokedex which would be the oh

no I might not get gold

my might not get

gold no no not

gold let's see what go is like 40

seconds

maybe can do that so much

better honestly I don't know what would

be Ghost type of lution stone but I

remember

Moonstone H Moonstone you Evol the

Jigglypuff which which which is like

which is one

The Jig and Jigglypuff which I do have

plushies of evolves into jiggly tff

Wiggly tff I mean h which is a bunny

like a bunny version of

jig so it's kind of fting like

that but uh I'm not sure if there's any

stone that would evolve you into a ghost

Tye unless you speaking up like a brick

guess that's the usual

joke can any Pokemon G by a break

anyway I forgot take what time I need it

no don't load no I'm missing it

oh I messed up

[Applause]

again 43 seconds and 8 CCS I wasn't

worse no wrong can't sh time

now how far did you get in that first

hour anyway oh I

they I I stopped after getting the red

Jem to to the T 41 4 I'm so

close so I'm not I've done defeated like

two bosses so far go get a gr

grade blocking

what the Swit sound like I can't

recognize this if I hear it there's of

course

the fake finish

accent know that people like to

reference like weish chef but and but

that does not sound like a Swedish

accent that's like that's like someone

sometime and

to make that

accent someone who barely heard the

accent tries to me with the

accent

that b

that like make it as at Sprite that's

always facing you around

[Music]

Sprite

go missed 4 seconds got two pumps missed

4

3D with a two Sprite one will cost you

two polygons with textures on now we can

pick up the with how

many um seven oh I'm far

from now I should

the

back to the

L but this time

again this time I don't need to rush

I think this is the

uh the area you do the other Coco level

which is called hot

cocoa because Coco is hot I

[Music]

mean

yes like a missing box is on the side of

level or something how wide it is

there's only 100

77

76

75 74

73 72

71

77 69 funny number

68

67 66

65 p i mean if you if you were to

replace KOCO with Pon in this

game certainly the LEL name has to be

ched but H Coco is obviously a reference

to what hot COC

which a

see

but you can change it to sexy bunny

lemon when I gu I just have to get with

that one once

more no M they're very

they're very stingy about M aren't

[Music]

they there you

go I should travel to the end of the

level get to the green exclamation point

box the removing all the all all all the

all the all the green boxes and then do

level

properly that be spe

[Music]

zo still no

mask could just offer 10 extra lives

there is a few 14 in this game to get

double M get

started can

I

no not two of these again oh I got close

[Music]

who okay how much you left now seven

more okay I can this 7

six very late rabbit s yeah you forgot

that one

when

54 what this B around thank thank you

for the stre or I guess the the

acknowledgement of being that I'm a hot

bun and that's the gem no

this

yay hotest

one okay I can leave this you

know I think I completed everything I

can do for now so where's the

platform

um yeah that

happened does make me wonder uh if the

um po CR switch glitch which works in um

on this platform too not sure why it's

no longer showing up

then hopefully it's still

working otherwise I'm kind of locked out

of the

game but I said if if I have any issue

with the safe file I can just redo the

game without the challenge because s you

pesky little rats aren't going to back

off eh continue to gather PS and see

what I do see what I

do H I said H I only need to get that

jam more Crystal Once In The Challenge

and then if I need to like recreate a

save file I can just collect those

stuff without doing the challenge

because I've already done The Challenge

on it since it's a self-imposed

challenge of

all crash lost the plan from somewhere

yeah as he he as he was traveling back

he he kind of lost

it he didn't he didn't know when he

dropped

it that's why you shouldn't have Loose H

stuff on you when you're on the

right wa that's not what it sounds

like

sound

[Music]

effect yeah I think yeah

yeah nicey party

today like Cur like 34 watch

this Ione is here for the crash

game with add a challenge and it's just

not just not only FY crash three

it's it's the crash three without a

challenge does this still work in this

game no I think the animation is

different so it doesn't

work no for some Reon they introduced

that uh oversight in the

remake so doing this game without

powerups is even

harder that one 1 2 3 4

5 let's do this be on safe

side replace all sound effects with

random pit of Arrow

there is the idea of doing

uh for me to replace every sound in like

Spyro Reit Trilogy uh with my own

[Music]

voice

H this one should not lead to boxes

I should be able to complete the

level get the box jam and then go back

and do the this

rout I'm pretty

sure I'm

correct I've been wrong before

eh when I was playing CR

the first crash on Game Boy advanced

when I say that they had an original one

original track the one I called out for

being original and the jungle music is

actually the jungle music crash too that

[Music]

was that shows how much I know crash too

I don't recognize the

music

bam and also in

uh return fire when they have the

Iranian flag when they

speak is it Iranian or Iranian Iranian

where they

speak uh

passion which which also uses the Arabic

R

and that is not Persian that is actually

Arabic for some reason they using

Iranian flag that might been a

mistake after checking what the text

actually says it's Arabic not

Persian wait this was the L one I was

doing you get that uh

purle yay I got the box again without

fing and now to do the death

r that should not count this

Dy but we'll

see it does count this dying crash too

which I feel silly

unless we playing remake that in that

way fixed it that could a good thing to

know I still didn't count it as dying

for my challenge because that would just

be

silly sadly I had to count it as I know

I don't pick that one

up I still had to count it as D my

challenge because otherwise I couldn't

enter the death route in the first place

so I had no

choice

whoops okay now it's at

this which game had the r script return

fire I mean you're

silly so would hit

him

that's one thing it would be a really

silly mod can pon pon vocalize

everything all music all sound

effects doing SP

flame

some I will listen back to the sound

effect and then I will try to MIM

again

thank

you where was the re skip level no it's

the tutorial the information page the

only place in the game where is text I

mean I said level

names the tutorial thing I watched the

very first time I play the game I

checked that

paint or I also pointed out how they

had a US flag and a UK flag but the

English versions are exactly the same

and using the UK no us

spelling of uh like armored and

[Music]

temper

[Music]

that's yeah it would be interesting to

do some the

music should be able to jump over that

[Music]

F that

happened

disappointed bunny is

disappointed

disappointed some athletic way

for black clothing for for a warm level

doesn't seem like a good combination

but I guess there was no options for

like white sport

[Music]

way okay I should probably not pick up

the pick

Point Excuse Me

game

night time it's kind of

cold yeah could

be really depends

like where I'm from the night can still

be kind of hot in the evening on the

night wait the night came out even Jun

night I mean yeah

can I stop Mak

[Music]

meist can't leave that

one oh in Texas night time will be hot

as day yeah some places are have

hot have hot

night well jumped

over almost jumped over the

game no that

wasn't

ah why did I do

that can't pick this

up I didn't mean to jump over the boxes

I'm going to jump on them so I can get

up

here

wa

well I do like

that it's not too easy to make like a

double jump I think the timing when you

no longer can do a double jump happens a

bit too early should probably be a bit

later I mean

like no limit on how late you can do a

double jump I don't think is a good idea

I think the limit crash three has is too

early

oh see n lives it's 7

[Music]

now 69 funny

number okay wait down things

now no more

mistakes fruit H

close

close

Okay H 69 find the

number there we

go

a

youer theight wasn't gone

yet she came oh she Nine Lives

again

how

rude oh 70

[Music]

lives there that's can do

JP there you go

come go let me

[Music]

through I need to do that

oh

almost stepping off it

[Applause]

again much get further and further along

this

level one day I might reach that

purple but I I have to collect so many

fruits on the way I like almost getting

up to like I have more fruits now than

last time I was

here

and now I got

71

go

okay

that's that's bad I go rid of the evil

Genie even with be in the

way

[Music]

and there we go there's purple Jam whoa

did it I did it I got the

gem where's the

celebration

purple

gem purple gem I can

use in this game you can walk on

these in the remake you can not really

work on these

wait apparently you can get stuck oh

platform is

back only place you can really walk it's

like

yeah it's really easy to apparently get

stuck on them to get up on them in this

game there was a purple route

somewhere was in this level so I can get

both gems

jimmies

gastic does mean a bunch of backtracking

but can do

this

I hope I didn't skip any boxes because

I'm trying to get the all

boxes I miss that

button

wait I'm confused what am I doing at

[Music]

moment

[Music]

oh ni it's exploded my

box didn't do that last

time H

73

so what he why 69 is such a nice

number this behind here I think

yes oh

no how am I supposed to backpacks Rel

this and

this

way too much to back

s oh I lost that

one cuz it reconnects here yeah there's

the platform conect well let's see how

this goes then disc

go wait a minute didn't I need that one

to reach this N I got the double jump

now there's no problem can do

this who

whoa speeding

away

okay can Vibes yeah you think I can do

this

yeah

maybe oh that was close but too

close Okay Okay the platform is

here there we

[Music]

go then it stops and then it just jump

over like

that

wait a

minute

boom wait what was what was it with this

Gap right

closed no I don't know there was nothing

there was the other door I was thinking

of anyway I might get

back well the scare part is

over the new scare part is here

here because I have to get through this

without

dying go go go because it's symmetrical

well

well say

so I do like it

[Music]

symmetrical maybe I can go through I

don't

know okay I need get rid of

that climb from pon pon here where are

you going

finda

no didn't attack me for doing on

camera

there we

[Music]

go oh two more

boxes one almost oh there they

are one more zero more

taada

gem without

dying double the

gems

runan how grab you're running to grab

andun back on the here it it is quite

the difference between my where I am

toian

town I would say it's almost like

physically impossible to run between the

two locations

but you're a plan am I to

judge Next Level

erace I go for first place

and

and all

boxes only for spe yes I have some Need

for Speed on this

L to get that first

place oh I got

it even though it's trying to try to

throw me me off

what I miss mess that up I got two of

them oh no more

boxes oh almost knocked me down the

hill

oh no try to knock me off the

track yeah there you

go represents

the is

accuracy

okay I can't rest

start guess I just have to reach exit

and up 11 to get the start

option move out of the

way

terrible

terrible you don't get the option to

restart okay I couldn't remember if that

was an option that was something added

to the

remake

I should just concentrate on winning to

get that over it or I should concentrate

on boxes maybe I'll take the boxes

first then I get that out of the way so

I don't have to get annoyed by the

boxes that seems like a good idea 22

let's count

21 i c in

Swedish sh cool then he can have some

Swedish

memories another

done next done

on this is easy

no told whoops too many boxes at

once

eight is

something wait how

left

I got

confused did I get that

no course

[Music]

not oh well

restart

restart people one after

another I'm not doing that

bad

I'm

crying I'm down to 29

watches I mean it doesn't

matter I think the max I had at once was

41 and one of one of the achievements is

having 50 at same time obviously it's

than to the two

raid but

still it

counts watch this I watch

this now I should got all of them

eight left

[Music]

seven it was not that

one than is oh

and is this

one imag me last

time

and missing

five there's this

for and then I just need one

more and there you

go that's one of

them

now

four and one

more I got a jam and I was count I did

it without dying you can't die in this

never one

[Music]

so so now should now I can just focus on

winning then I should do the time

ch

oops well actually should May to do

[Music]

this I wanted like going up the ramp and

then Landing does

uh is a longer route than just going

next to me but I do wonder if because we

seem to like speed up for it because

it's the game play game play because the

game they don't use real physics I

wonder if going over Ram doesn't make

quick but if it's quicker just got next

to

RS

of go unless you have to go over R to he

skip

out

oh I didn't get

fruits how D

they I

fies yeah this thing is in the way

this is

thing can't get through

it I

think well bouncing up the

track blow over the

hle yeah it's going

thir I mean

three you on carrot are you teasing me

with

carrots Panda off

bamboo

Max no this Panda

no no this Pand does not eat bamboo this

Panda only eats

Carrots

go around the cars

with with the 2D

Wheels

no

oh boned panda on

head now bonking with bamboo

scks

just because panda is a panda doesn't

mean panda eat

B no no

yeah this is going terribly

again my

brain who need a brain

anyway m is me playing

press this isn't even part of the

challenge this is just me trying to do

level

normally no boost at

start okay cining with I'm probably

don't make it

quicker ding More

diner

there we

go one car

left

we go zero cars

left whoa I was going AC C

headone get thing I didn't fell in fall

in F

in

go go p p p p Shing on pom

P we okay let's do the time

challenge

let's see how it

goes did you know if you do this in this

game it does take a long time but as you

can see you arm moved back each

time

slightly you can deter by the

line

and if you move back enough you should

be able to see the the sign see now you

kind of see the sign

here do here

sound a weird crashing

sound yeah it says start

appar it says start

apparently anyway wasting so much time

means that it shouldn't be an annoying

part in my

way it should just be a whoops feature

she just not have

any CL in the

way sneak through there nice I guess

that's was a sneaking through

it I think this the

gitl I'm basically using thepad when I'm

playing

trash plus I'm using a PlayStation

controller a PlayStation 3 controller

very

specifically so my th is kind of resting

where the dead is I do prefer the Xbox

layout like um Quality wise the

PlayStation control is good I just don't

like the layout of the stick I

understand the Symmetry like d-pad and

face buttons on op uper and the sticks

below

but the difference between the

PlayStation controller and Xbox

controller was that the PlayStation

PlayStation controller added the sticks

as like an after

thought uh and even even the play three

got caught up with play eight that

completely ruined my

run anyway even the PlayStation 3

controller is basically the PlayStation

One controller they didn't they haven't

really deigned this how it

looks and it wasn't on Play 4 they

decided to actually redesign the

controller like like

H maybe you don't Maybe the controller

perfect first first time

around it's a good controller but it has

yeah the controller sticks on play are

Place terribly for the primary movement

stick

yeah it's perfectly fine if you play

like d-pad based games because now you

have the d-pad for like the nice place

when you rest some so I wouldn't mind

having like a play contr and an Xbox

controller but of course the issue with

the Xbox controller I have well first

off the the 360 controller I have is a

thir party and The Dead Zone on it is

terrible this is huge and making the as

in

um and when I move it slightly it goes

from zero to Max basic it it's it's

terrible the part controller is an

official controller but then I actually

bought an official

eh Xbox One controller but the

uh but it also has issues because it

can't the wireless isn't working or like

the the wireless is working the batter

is not working but it's putting new

batteries in it it does not work it

doesn't do anything

battery seeing on it is broken and if I

use like the port for the cable is also

terrible do like the controller

otherwise like layout wise the the

resistance in the stick I like how

little resistance is there

is buttons feel nice the price and

everything the only issue I have is that

the cable doesn't doesn't really connect

properly and the batteries are not

working so I can I cannot use it with or

that cable it just doesn't

work

so build quality that way is an issue

with controller which I have not had an

issue with PlayStation

controller and so they have different

issu different issues I have

[Applause]

with can't named Annie in my room and

she's making

noise are you okay

Annie Annie are you

okay I'm still messing

up oh no I got the disapprove look on

the F Pon P what have I

[Music]

done cars are cheating starting so far

ahead I do still believe that you should

have

like before you select the lbel what you

choose if you want to do time tral or

not and if you do time Tri on a race

like this it removes the other

drivers you can argue that they are kind

of like

uh supposed to

be like in the way

but considering what I did first time I

did time wait that wait for them to

drive away and then basically do the

track without them in the

way as you you still have that option

but you must wait and I think that's a

Terri

design and even if they don't want you

to choose you want to do turn turn

before selecting level they could have

done it so just like the fruits

disappear when you start time turn they

can just remove all the vehicles when

you start time turn because the only

reason Vehicles aren't here I mean you

can arue they are supposed to be

hindrance too

but the main reason for the vehicles is

the uh the getting the crystal for first

Bas which you must do before you can do

time train

anyway just

my

suggestions obviously the Remake didn't

do it because the it's based on the

original game take wo wo wo

wo

that was close I'm going oh I'm getting

about the same time I'm getting worse

time p p of judgment I fa

again

bainer oh this one is the tricky one

getting good time

on this is going to take an hour oh no

more judgment triple judgment for three

fails and getting so

[Music]

judged no keep missing that if I get

that one I

can I guess I'm close to getting

the oh got sled off the whole thing

slid was sliding so far up the hitting

that

one leaning off

move car Mo

way you sure working a up car in

those

stations Benzene

stations

[Music]

slide slide

slide oh and then I hit that one

instead

[Music]

oh come

on

yes I mean

might it

work oh

nice using it to break but

still this is even worst time why am I

doing worse than

worse no need time that's how bad it

is hey

everybody hey

Kelly

it is every

bunny hello every

bunny I should remember that as my intro

to my

streams like Hello everybody no no I

said the hello everybody and goodbye

everybody that's that's what I should

say probably was taking a long time

before oh nice I passed right through

those two that's what I have been trying

to do

that's been what I'm trying to

do bit focused on the

trying you know don't fix and try oh

I'll be that going to ruin everything

now I'm not texting there I'm just

speaking

what's this leg on

Sweden basically SW Sweden is kind of

don't don't like to make things illegal

I guess it is okay to use your phone

while driving as long as it doesn't

impair your driving

skins TR skills you are driving

down if you're trying fine still using

your phone that's

okay

there's a bunch of things that are

anyway anyway come on come on this why

is this time so much good than the other

times everyone knows where is the best

there we go finally took a few times

hello everybody bunny I'm glad I thought

of it oh yeah that's very

[Music]

creative so did I

get eight not even close hey I got a

special level I can do

here it or should I end

stream I am having fun though so you

know cuz it's been

hours over time yeah don't this

level yeah I I was going for hot coco

but maybe

now now that I think of it maybe I

shouldn't cuz it will take

me yeah I well I guess I'm not doing the

level

10 yeah it's been like 40 minutes over

time and I do have stuff I actually do

need to

do so I guess I have

to than

Queen but it's been fun it has been

fun I was think

yeah I mean it is if I might change my

time change my mind okay s me if I might

change my mind again I do have a lot of

people here watching anime so maybe I

should do have

time for an exception

I but anyone's is chatting anyways it

doesn't matter let's do a big r

instead anyway

uh thank you everyone who has been here

yeah I remember my links this time my

links is the

patreon where you can patronize

can was at

Discord you want to visit the Polish

streamer I guess we could do

that it's not like like there are people

who uh I wouldn't mind reading but I

have more chances of reading them I

guess we could visit a Polish but they

speaking polish it gets a bit awkward

you

know you

know it probably should be like everyone

here speaks English so

if I think but unless to speak English I

said if they speak English

fine K I know she I mean I have options

you other wayse but

um well given with yeah I actually got a

suggest before about
