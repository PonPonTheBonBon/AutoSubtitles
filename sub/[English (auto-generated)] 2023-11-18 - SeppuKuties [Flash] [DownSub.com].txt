[Music]

okay there we

go good see I said something for some

reason it didn't recognize the

microphone but now it is so welcome

everyone not sure what went wrong

there and I even had the uh audio mixer

right in front of me and still didn't

see anything

wrong I'm a bit silly so I did play this

game

before so and uh is that

[Music]

working yeah know because it didn't l

in

oh because it had an update I have to do

the update I need to remember to do the

update so yeah so in this

game I do have

[Music]

the these two

left all right 18 and 25 currently I

have

1 so is going to be

hard because you start with 30 and the

outfit R should work now you start with

30 so basically only can let five die

and one of the ones I want to try is

like this

one and AC really doesn't matter at this

point

because

um I only need to focus on this what

happens if I get less

than the required

amount there we go

that's how we do

[Music]

it because if

I there something need I can't I cannot

die on this level oh I'm a pink

bunny now he going to force me to kind

of pink bunny yeah what happens if I

don't pick up

everything we're not going to get an A

rank but it's not like going to override

this but if I already got an A

rank is there of this I could so now I

got 14 of this I could

improve like this one I think I could

improve

Boop uh the yeah try the R by the way if

you if you

like yeah

hey so

[Music]

somehow this

[Music]

thing oh that was too short pink

bunny

ah well three died

again

that didn't work H I need to get that

one closer sh I don't think I can do

better

[Music]

thenar

hello

so like if I put it there

whoa it didn't mean for it to fly no I

didn't mean to restart again didn't mean

to for to fly that

[Music]

far when do I have to go and get that

one okay

so and

then like that pink

[Music]

bunny o i did

it I don't think I can do better than

that

getting when does

the

yay pink bunny is the best

character

the pink B is very cute

because yeah I don't see any way I would

be able to

[Music]

because because if I

get because I can stand here and get

because I need the key to open that as

soon as I peek it I cannot go from there

to

there wait actually actually I have an

idea I have an

idea

okay let me first measure

something how far here can I

be

nope so all the way over there okay that

gives me an

idea

okay there's one more thing I could

[Music]

do

is by standing here and do

off there we go Theon is replacing

raccoon there we

go and only won

this so now I'm getting out worst

ranking but I hope that doesn't replace

it no it doesn't so rank so I don't have

to care care about

acorns since I got an A ranking here

everything I only need to focus on this

I okay so yeah I could do that but I

don't think I could do even

very so I'm allowed five deaths

this and that's one

already it is one but I don't see how I

would

can just as soon as I touch this

one this one is

dead and now one is dead and I can't

improve that that almost feels like a

forced one but so early two of them I

don't like

that wait did one of them died on this

one

that the

necessar okay that wasn't necessary oh

pink

bunny no more pink bu oh pink

bunny pink bunny should be my new

Avatar

no for some reason I get the animal you

get is completely

random we got the pink see no it's not a

pink bunny anymore pink bunny three

three times in a

row no it's

moved the game knows we like the P

funny where's the cheese

Cod why am I so terrible at this I don't

even know where oh I see where no no I

don't oh yeah that's where

okay I P money so can I get out of there

quick

enough

no so much being funny at

moment you should I redeemed to make pon

pon turn into this pink

bunny yes like

that so now what I need to to just focus

on

getting yeah

[Music]

serus cutting your head beautiful bunny

I should have like a hand I can

put all I get so far say carrot pet pet

pet the car is my

poter so two deaths I don't know how to

improve but I guess I could ask you if

you have some we didn't work on this for

a long time trying to improve this one

how many times did they wait zero

two yeah two death on this one oh yeah

yeah yeah I see because one Des is here

and the Other Des is

here and I don't know if I can prove

those how would I fix

that no not that

one sometimes it doesn't cooperate with

me real bunny hours

hello yes this the bunny hours playing

as a fox Sly cannot switch character I

want to play as the pink

bunny edit every every character is a

pink

py I don't see how I would be able to

get this

key and without

dying and maybe I can

any because this one I can't get oops if

not if I do that

heck I'm might be able to get this with

just one

this

no cuz the thing

is oh no I I I know what I'm supposed to

suppos to do I think I

know I think I know how I supposed to do

this no so CL oh wait wait that might

work that might

work that might work I hope the Collis

and everything is the same for every

character so there's two ideas I have

one idea

is

what I didn't know that was the thing

do you even need the red

key uh yeah I

mean I don't see how else I would

progress the level but I'm up for ideas

of because yeah it lows this thing so I

can get through here it was a good

question there

yeah I

might okay the no come

on okay so I have an idea if I can make

this

work oh wait I need to start this

thing it's timing

based come

on come

on oh now now you want to move thank you

and now when I'm ready it's

just didn't go as I wanted it

to okay

okay there we

[Music]

go how about those

things because I'm wondering if you can

use not if you can use knock the blue

key off the platform without the red or

green

Keys okay one is okay yeah it's just

that I I don't see how I would reach

that

thing this is how you reach

it

so

picky all it doesn't count there we

go obviously much worse

but yeah but it's just that it's an

interesting idea but I'm really not sure

how I would

get across this one like the green key

doesn't

doesn't require a death anyway so that

doesn't matter it's the red key that

requires a des but I don't see how I

would be able to progress this level

without the red

key so so far I'm not being able to

figure out those three deaths death and

and I only have two deaths left on the

rest of the levels oh I got

18 do I actually need to beat the left

for count I I'll it when have

25

so this one I should be able to do right

can I gu no wait how did I die on this

level oh it's

because it's because the platform opens

up isn't

it yeah and it's very

quick

and I need a Green Key because otherwise

I cannot get over up

here

so I try to

jump and I guess if I'm quick enough to

jump I might be able to do

it at this just not fall

damage

yeah there we

go that's how you do

it

that's don't fall oh it

is yeah it wasn't one of those spiky

ones who that's a perfect

oh no it's this

one we I struggled so much figuring

out how I was oh yeah

yeah so I can do

that but maybe I can exploit the physics

engine in

yeah there we

go all right this first then

is at least there's no fall damage that

would be awful pink bunny is the best

bunny it's the only one no wa the white

bunny name Pon p is the best Bunny

always name it

pink bunny second best there are pink

bunny did

everything P bunny is disappointed who

why did you call the pink bunny the best

bunny so can I do this without

dying need the red okay okay first off

the red key does

this can I get to that key without dying

I don't see that being possible and

there's spikes

there wait um oh oh yeah

yeah this is so

did this is yeah yeah there we

go wait and then need continue pushing

this

[Music]

well but then it's about falling down

without

dying

wh don't rotate like

that

who I'm not the best

okay fall

asleep is that a

threat I do have a lot of s death after

this one which is very

convenient so there's this one wait

three

deaths three deaths

three

died died with a capital

KN

H nope I should be able to die pink

bunny no

no no no no no no

no come on pink bunny you're strong you

can do

this it's

working as soon as that top one falls

down the bunny is

dead nope

okay

come

[Music]

on okay oh yeah okay it should perhaps

work I just need to time it better to

jump over those good thing is that one

thing at the start there we go that's

how I do

it that's what I wanted to

do oh no don't get stuck like this there

we

go

no where's

that straight in the

face

I want it to get

stuck there we go that's what I wanted

to

do okay I can I think you're supposed to

be able to

no okay let's me let me practice

this okay I don't think there is a way

to

[Music]

no I I think I have to make one this

here by doing

that

yeah so much dead bodies

here why is their tongue separate is

that a tongue or is there something else

looks like a tongue from this

SK look at these dead

bunnies look at them dead bunnies yeah I

think I have so like have one this

here annoying

but

who what's worse getting squished by the

balls or getting trapped and never being

able to

escape you're getting B you you get a

better view of the completion screen

wait what wait what are

you no wait what am I

doing OB was doing something weird what

do you mean by better VI the comp

the dead body saying you get a closer

view I still don't know what you're

talking

about okay now I'm failing at

this

nope now I SI sport beautiful dress the

[Music]

dress thank you for

reading and look I'm playing as a pink

bunny my perfect moment welcome

everyone shout out to Neville

Nevel

seven obvious question are six other

Revelations I haven't asked seven stand

for

something welcome welcome everyone I

hope you had a good stream and and uh

you had um a good

stream how was it going and so let's see

if I can do this without letting this

bunny die oh the bunny died so yes I I'm

a I'm bunny I've been

on this is a tricky

game but yes let's see how is it all

going I'm

doing I'm doing a very late night stream

here because

I'm I don't

know

T let's say I was

bored doing some there we go that's how

you supp do

it yeah you kind of

have

yeah and then I basically have to let it

die and there we

go so my goal is to only letting five of

them die in the to the whole

game um I've already let one two three

and four I so I have to two of these I

have to

improve what is it's like a challenging

fail it is uh yes this is a

SE I

guess and um

yes I can watch the very cute intro

here the humans coming the for the the

PO animals home so they are now

going to the paradise Mets why doesn't

it say how

many died

here so that's my

goal making as little as possible to die

because well going back

here the goal is 25 having 25 left over

I have 23 two more to improve him oh

dear what a g yeah you also have a a a

spe special command called seppuku I

think and you can bring out your sword

and

just oh that's a waste of Al

but so it's wait it's one of

these it's like this one I should be

able to do this without dying at once

so and this one is the one you kind of

have to exploit the physics engine to

make it

work 25 30 lives in this

level yeah like

this yeah yeah come on come on oh so

close a pink

PNY so

uh

yes or something that can

happen the physics engine this game is

kind of

weird it's using I don't remember what

this was

called it's one of the

um can

of I've heard about it before I never

used it myself though haven't done much

I haven't done my own games though come

on

oh some

oh what Lu what do you mean by

that okay I I need to I need to do this

very I'm actually surprised that well on

the other

[Music]

levs I wonder if I can and like

constantly jump on

it okay and that was just teral the

elephant is too heavy I hope there's no

physics difference between the

animals I assume they're the

same H jumping quickly is

hard no I don't know to playing on

keyboard this is the only game so far on

stream I used the keyboard I I forgot to

jump

off it's a new eism instead of the

Polish k word I'll just say kakaka

what's wrong with the Polish

game you can say the Swedish word which

is

Kura

oh I

don't you s suddenly you should be able

to do this without cuz I can't put like

a dead body in

there which is how I complet this one

before with one n but I want really want

to complete with the

this uh yeah this looks like a lot of

fun yeah it was fun

H thank you for

following doing the game like properly I

it's been it's been fun it's like a an

hour long game so it's a it's a nice

quick game to stream you want to do

something if you want to challenge

yourself we going for the only five

deaths total in the

game that's a tricky one cuz you have

uh 30 of them in

total

yeah I'm not sure if I okay then because

otherwise I have to like do this without

dying wait I should be able to do this

without dying why why did I die on this

level okay wait oh because I can't get

up here wait do I need

to wait is this one a level I have to

die on because no

wait

nice

wait how much oh yeah yeah

this okay this is a level you don't have

to die

on

well you just need to know how to

explain

[Music]

well okay so it's just one of these I

have to

improve so do I need to die on this

level wait why did I die on this level

I don't

see like I do

this oh it was it to get the key I

think yeah I think it was to get the

key yeah I don't see how I

should yeah and then it's

open I'm not sure if I can can do this

one one

without uh without dying so it's either

this one or trying to exploit the

vehicle

caring unless unless if I'm like quick

enough to

open open and close

it so it can B bounce over to the other

place but how should I be quick enough

to do

that and sorry for missing comments why

isn't it it's supposed to S send me a oh

wait I know

why is this changing the

volume no no completely lower the

volume

of the

game anyway this should allow me to hear

com because I have a sound that should

play when I hear the comments when the

comment come in I don't miss the

comments also I want to say I love the

design of your OC thank you

h i I didn't draw it I as it says in the

credit I

contacted which I promise to say let's

see I can

I had to remember the name every

time

um Violet Echoes on ink bunny well it

says in the

credits and then I got the very cute

bunny and I'm very happy for the

design yeah I'm definitely not

especially if I fall down yeah I don't

think I can do this without dying at

least

once I'm not exactly sure how I'm

supposed to do

that really don't see how I'm supposed

to that would be if I jump really late

and then

somehow yeah like that would

work you can't quickly turn around me

jump well not quickly but

can I assum in I should jump out pick it

up and jump back it's almost like I was

able to do it last time I just just need

to

um no I

didn't I decided to

um switch Focus so I completely lost

that

one I want more

try problem with

[Music]

running the game I'm using

keyboard and then accidentally pressing

the wrong

thing okay yeah you mean like that yeah

there we

go I guess that was a good

suggestion how long is it left on sport

for 3

minutes Nev relation

star you are a

star so with

25 let me check yeah it doesn't give me

so I have to do the

final my final

level spoiler for the

ending and I have to do it without dying

which I know works because I've done

it but it's quite a

challenge it

casual yeah do doing this level that

dying is very tricky cuz you have

to there we go there we go that's what

you

need well no stop stop hitting

it

no hydrate I need a hydrate

oh yeah what's up clothes thank you for

the hyd what should I call it

Peak

okay one more

try oh I should probably not

have it's no no come

on

it's yeah probably start at this point I

needed to

have flip it around oh no I should have

been prepared for

that okay pink bunny

time oh no bad

timing there we go

no let me up on it no

oh perfect it reset itself now it's I

want to stand on this bikes no I can't

that would make it very

easy oh no I should have seen that I saw

too

late here we go that's how you do it no

no i s off

it

you're welcome

H oh thank second best bunny best bunny

okay okay the pink bunny is the second

pink bunny is the best character in this

game but pink bunny is the second best

bunny

of

F pon pon getting jealous oh no I switch

out to S

it come on come on come on oh I was so

close before two times even and then I

missed it

up first time I tried to be careful but

I'm managed to mess it up

anyway oh I walked

into

they explode like

balloons there we

go okay oh

no okay oh now I hit the

ground

oh I will defeat this level this I will

not let this level defeat

me no you're supposed to hit it there we

go oh it's e ground

again I need a good timing here there we

go there we go and

then no I did then I hit that

thing the thing it was hanging from So

Close oh there no I H the ground

again pink bunny flip up you got this

you beat it I know I beat it but I beat

it twice before without dying oh now I'm

slipping off

everything I know I will do

it thank for

encouragement oh I fell

down not not it was certainly easier I'm

I'm probably nervous or what what do you

call it too many people watching me at

the

moment this in the CLA or something

maybe no all right I'm going have pu I

get some food you take care

reling also you need to send me a pick

of chy I'd love to draw her I have yeah

I should probably do that I do have uh

most on my about page is the most of the

character if you don't need a feat I

would love to see a drawing if you if

you want

to that that would be

amazing and of

course obviously crazy and

everything and if I can sh off it sh it

on

stream but have a have

a

good rest of your day and thank you so

much for

raing oh I'm pressing wrong buttons

now now now I be a deat it now I'm not

nervous about Neville

watching

see oh one was messing up anyway no I

messed up no no I saved it I saved

it I almost messed up with game in okay

it's it's slowing down there we go oh

there we go look at this and now it's

just easy PA like this is really easy

so perfect I did

it kind the first try of the Never So

Ling wa new print or

what and there Paradise Metals is no

more

is the perfect ending for the

game yay you're still

here the perfect

[Music]

ending the rainbow was just the

[Music]

building oh here we go this box

2D there we go every po

print okay sure you have the this P

print

but I can confirm that the game does not

run on Armor Games website so I have

technically visited their website but

yeah it's it's basically checking if you

run a game

from does that demon show up no it

doesn't so everything game is 100%

complete how long did that take an hour

43 minutes actually I'm with

that Armor Games Yes

uh it's it's one of those developing

Flash game that's I mean this game is

from 2008 this is a flash

game and if you go to the Builder which

does not work by the way because you

have

to it probably it runs uh

uh yeah head over to the to the level

edit armor games this are like a

separate

um separate game that you can do the

editor in and then you can paste the

code

here but every time you go back it

randomizes the menu so you can do it

until you get a bunny there's no until

you get a

bunny and when watch try

there and then no the bunny is not even

there we go finally after my

TR so yeah the first time I did this I

refreshed it until I got the

bunny I could have the bunny on the

first Stream So now well I guess that's

that's it I don't see anything more to

do and I'm pretty happy with the

everything I got here

so

well I guess I guess I guess that's all

if there's nothing else I'm

forgetting uh and the music in the game

can be a bit repetitive I don't have any

other like flash games at the

moment I considered like getting more

flash games to

play if that's uh

so that's

um if if other people have suggestions

for other flash games there are all the

flash games I'm looking

for

um

um
