foreign

first and only here

has really sound too

let's continue

on already quarter City game

already it feels like you got now

received skills main Guild Hall

so where I

so yeah every land has eight things to

collect

and then one of the

and then there's this quest which is

Click

this is connected

things seven things

[Music]

and then there is are the hearts there's

the 12 of them

and their ability items which are part

of as well

and then there are

Four Keys which I assume is going to be

in eight pieces because I got half a key

it's compared to be half a key

a single half like a single instance of

property

and then bonus items which are funny

especially items like Magic Rainbow Dust

which one of the baby dragons had which

they should probably not have

yeah

which I got

almost half the gems already but not the

thing

you got 27 there is no decimal here for

some reason I got like a quarter three

game but not that single heart again

so anyways sorry for not reading

comments you're gonna go into where my

previous stuff right I'm on time today

yeah this is the screen sorry me and you

were kind of late yesterday I think you

said that you wanted to come in time

yesterday but

but of course hey you come and go as you

wish

so how are you today I'll let you feel a

bit more energetic than yesterday

hey

hello dreams which I think is possible

to be

because you cry

that might be why I said Grimes because

if I if I say like

ones that was a joke because you had a

one in your name

but anyway greens

are doing I'm doing fine

that is good

I'm not sure why the timer counts while

the game is paused excuse me just

spawned

so in this game is kind of different

from the usual spine games

because this game doesn't have like

individual levels separated by portals

in multiple homewards this seems to

these are instead

um I'm just working and flaming and

these are instead the multiple areas

connected to each other

for some reason I get uh

I get getting a Raymond feel of this

world

because I mean there is a paint

World England

oh it's this time I get up here you want

that answers that question

I don't know another money Banks

does he want does he let me hear

something

and

um okay sure

this is I think I see something is there

explore went

yes

so all right kitten you're here early

I mean

the beating noise okay I'm on lunch

break now oh yeah well maybe I guess

maybe it's not an early lunch break it's

just I used to drink two hours later

today

compared to Monday Tuesday

and Foxy Roxy here on

do you want to be called foxy Roxy or

Gerard Gerard I guess these two I've

seen this

foreign

apparently

in ancient mine

right now this is nice all right agents

one through eight have been captured by

groundhogs I must save them and I must

save them

they are signs oh

to crawl press it down and left or right

on the control pad

helps to keep out of sight

ah

okay but what does this side say sneak

up on rhinox and press the B button to

replace them with tummies don't get

spotted ah yes you replace enemies with

dummies

you just uh

yes yes yes they were

simply replaced

what

he saw that happening

oops

okay

I guess don't

left that guard see it happening

I am of course crawling doesn't help me

not get spotted okay I see I see

whatever it is

well I guess foxy sounds good I'm

thinking Roxy

but

okay so I'm basically have to

foreign

apparently I can't work with it

you know it's like metal case solid

fairly

there you go that was kind of stuff

he's the steamer seems to pick something

different so yeah I guess

oh there were two they were and they

were in the one

[Music]

and of course it has to be a stealth

level

I'm just gonna try to figure out how

this works

oh I jumped too early

and the Diamonds obviously looks exactly

like the rhinox they are replaced by

Nike

how like if you're looking in the other

way I'm not I don't know

thank you

another question there's nothing here so

I I figure this puzzle out

kitten is lacking

thank you for liking it's a very

important note there baby CDF and assume

g i j

wait

which way are we looking

and there's a mirror now

can you spell checkpoint please

I can apparently hang in there but

what's what's this

rambling hoop hold the arm but any part

books with the combat that got are two

buttons for I see

oh this smooth Amy

ah

and that might come in handy

okay

so

be quick enough

you can capture them

apparently can't go over there

let's go to a pad down to crouch here

when you told me the head right behind

large office and join us won't see okay

oh

how do I know if I'm killing them is he

oh

can I can I suck out the cameras one as

a p i

was calling here

yes that works

cameras

foreign

the vacuuming

yeah I guess another kind of green tea I

see linky

it has a it has a nice like

aesthetically I think I think the game

looks fine

oh it still gives me the Raymond feel

is it made no

very much this is not

okay I cannot

[Music]

there we go

is that a checkpoint fairy

many checkpoints

oh yeah I'm supposed to hide behind

these

large pencil

don't fall down

honey

these are they

oh

[Music]

no you're not saying anything

[Music]

thank God she's sleeping

and why is every agent the same except

agent line

I have to start over now I have this

checkpoint there okay

okay

the vacuum is that

as a pocket Dimension inside or it's

gonna be very cramped and see those

Rhino they must be quite heavy too

can you break up here

foreign

[Music]

it's just enough this night

um

all right good it's if it's a checkpoint

do you see nothing right next now this

one is just looking straight and the

wall it's not going to see anything

it's this

one whatever it is I'm not going to

touch it

come on

repeat monkey

a bit of that one

because

straight into

okay ham

thank you I'm not even touching that but

then it's just this

morning I was watching the paint on the

wall dry

probably there's a lot of paint here so

[Music]

like

okay it's worth this time

but

I need to do it again

huh what

stupid

I camera

I wanted the WM but no

well I'm sorry for trying game

foreign

s

wasted an extra pixel on these

[Music]

Cooks

how am I supposed to see the camera

I'll do two of them

nothing suspicious it's just a dummy it

was always here

don't mind it

Roxy's hiding

independable now

huh

you can't you can't do it in the air

while listening

[Music]

you can do it in the eye

but it's only sometimes apparently

apparently not when I need to use it in

there in that case it doesn't work

unless you can't do it when you when

you're doing it that will jump

oh and

so I had to redo this whole thing

it is hot like

ah this is going to be one long eleven

I can't see which way the camera is

looking

well I guess I can use the look feature

but

he didn't

like fix changes

hey agent 9 11.

[Music]

I know you guys like it probably but you

see it will take a while

it's quite an annoying level

he can do it

as you said

celebrations like

they jump at the end isn't enough and

then I have to

barely see the camera

[Music]

okay there we go

rescue you getting a checkpoint

identified us

more away

[Music]

I probably need to get this from here

fat

now I can get a white key

and then continue

okay so this is

hmm

oh

work from that is okay

so I have to stand up here then

okay that camera will be high

okay look at the cute box

with a big chain

and I got the Keystone because it's

showing goes there

um I

yeah the controllers in this game is

terrible

and it just isn't it just isn't enough

to reach over sometimes

I don't

really care how this whole system works

all right

oh no he hit me like I

the game wasn't giving me any other

instructions of how to do this thing I'm

doing

what the game wants me to do

give me just

passed into science

and also you need to double jump but you

can apparently not do it often

I mean it's probably easier to just do

that

no apparently

[Music]

okay you can't do examples jump

there we go you used to see

come on

how strange Ian came is strange

he's in

oh come on

never trapped onto that thing before

I guess it's back to gameplay the

developers never tested

yeah that was exactly the one I wanted

to

wait what's the white key for

don't just drop you do a double jump

well I guess I got to keep the

e and this thing is

how am I

I don't know at least it's not this

problem yeah

I'm so excited to see why

sometimes there's always fine sometimes

they don't

the game is a bit consistent

oh there's a checkpoint here again

do a little dance

for me fairy

okay

get back to the better the same level

but this is what it means that this

actually doesn't mean there or I'll be

in the blue key for that

I don't remember what's that

this one

so when they walk that's making the

noise

this area

so

moving on back to the start where they

were

[Music]

okay

with this nice

is meant

it's nice when he lands doesn't want to

spike I mean

the place here for some reason

[Music]

when

that thing is sleeping it makes that

noise oh so the white key is a blue key

okay

I was gonna say is the water alone no

let me go

it looks very white

that's something it's just me I thought

it was my kitty baby because I said so

but anyway

[Music]

if you you're the last agent

thanks

to get to spiral could you take it to

her dinner like how how did you like

who gave it to you and told you inspire

needs it I think

no problem I give it to spice to give it

he to give to him when I get back to

them

I'll give it to Sparks to give

to him when I get back to the event okay

well I have confusing sentence

because you didn't know spiders here

yeah

like how do you how the he know that

agent 9 is able to hand over the key

to this is wrong way to spider in the

first place

maybe oh hydrate

hey

maybe they know that a United has better

connection to

to to inspiring an agent at eight

and every agent wants me it looks

exactly the same agenda is the

difference one

let's

I think it's not an uncommon thing

in Media

or you have like the main character

number something and then which has a

second look and then and because that

character has a high number like Engine

line that means that there are previous

agents so one through eight

and

they look exactly identical to each

other

there's all the agents here spikes Upon

A keyhop you can give the spider

thanks again

I don't know

this is one of what appears to be some

kind of chest key

we have both halves of this key so we

can open red chests now

it appears to be some kind of key to our

chest we can open chests now

oh

I'm living here

no Alan again

uh let's see what the money Banks want

to lose spiral see if you can guess what

I'm thinking

and he just happened

across an item of some kind and you'll

sell it to us

you're a clever little dragonfly but

using 600 gems so I will give you a

wonderful item that I'm found

give him 600 gems oh no are we sure this

item looks like it could be some of some

importance and that's exactly what why

I'm selling it here

and then the

characteristic manufacturing element and

a wonderful I'm not certain that you

will enjoy this contraption

this is a transporting device with

padded threads it looks like it can

carry lots of weight it's a part of the

machine we need to find very very

librarian who doesn't have a name

apparently

well no thanks money Banks

no wait I didn't want to go in there

now I want attitude

you can't hit me out of here

[Music]

why is that saying oh this ahead it's a

it's one of the square

and someone here didn't recognize it at

first we don't have those around here

I've seen it in media that's why I

didn't recognize it at first

trying to unfamiliar

when

I guess I'm down here

I wasn't even supposed to go here

so

anyway

a quick game quick this game

what happens with Quick Escape

alright it's a fairy book thing

yeah I assume they bring me here yes

pretty useful

wait we already spoke about that

and we already spoke about that

[Music]

wait all right it was it was over here

oh Spyro have you forgotten how to swim

no we haven't spoke about that

nope

okay if you didn't see

that didn't reach I was hoping for the

best day

there we go now land disappeared so now

there we go banana cinnamona

yeah her little greens

as I mentioned that it just didn't work

when I started the game it just tells me

there are missing fights

and they told me to do the repair thing

I did and I think it did not fix the

issue

keep falling into the new

so even if I wanted to I'm saying that I

don't want to but

I also like

I would like a bit more more like

more more of a a heads up like before

like not like

24 hours before it will happen and I was

informed about it like some hours ago

foreign

we need some help

what can we do for you

[Music]

rhinos

is interfering with the banana plants

could you clear them out for us

maybe your super flame breath Henry jump

Spiro I don't think remember more voices

I use them whatever many more

I guess this monkey thing is standing in

the window

sure

yeah they wait

are there any more of these but there's

one up there okay

well

okay shut it

oh wait okay take care

oh

if I'm going to look

it answers okay but that's bad

by the way

[Music]

that's another one of these

[Music]

I assume this one takes me

over here

[Music]

that's one relax ship

she was too cool already

heat it up

seriously

I went down here

seeing MCA

okay

very relaxing sheep

not so relaxed now are you

almost falling into the goo

the booger

I didn't mean to play me a sheep yeah I

got annoying

but I do like like the sheep in this

game actually

what's this

windows on the sheet on the sheet on the

bananas to keep them cool

there's one button

there's a second button somewhere

little sheep

it's brand I've been seeing you here

always against senior spiders here I

need your help

actually I was going to ask ask you for

help we need to get it hard

oh now you mentioned in spy room that

took your mind

can we help each other right next to the

ingredients for our banana fertilizer to

keep our bananas growing at all we need

we've been using a heart of the banana

Savannah sure it's a huge solo these

Hearts can do anything

got it we find your ingredients and you

give us the heart

yeah this is

exactly here's a list of these seven

ingredients we need them all make

because it's always seven

this game has as you might have noticed

there's a lot of fetch quests

and some of the things you have to do

sure it's like these fresh quests

um I think I actually don't I haven't

completed a single first Quest yet I

think

I wouldn't be surprised if a fetch Quest

If I complete the first Quest that it's

going to lead me it'll give me an item

[Music]

oh no every first Quest is the heart

okay

[Music]

in that case every fresh case leads to a

heart however

as as discipline shows the hearts

themselves is a whole fetch quest in

itself as well

[Music]

so it's a double

Duty practice quest game

so here's the place I'm going into if I

can find a second button

oh there it is

I found this

so I got some light this time okay

Inspire refresh Quest yeah this is well

I guess calling this game Adventure is

pretty name because it's a whole fresh

Quest Adventure

[Music]

now I also need these Keys which is not

reading again that's much of a fish

fetch quests

and then do them French it looks fun I

mean yeah it is the length thing

[Music]

okay how do I get up here

[Music]

oh

[Music]

I know okay let's see if I just go into

this

now

is taking me back here

no wait I haven't been here

because that was probably not

when this place they are not the same

if this one is confusing

[Music]

and now there's another one oh this is

going to be confusing

oh yeah and then if I flame this one

[Music]

I actually don't know how this system

works

[Music]

who needs me

that I've seen allowance

on now

I want to close it

closed it

[Music]

girl

ah another

eat these grapes they are hard to find

according to Bianca

it's one of the plants Bianca needs for

his spell

yeah she's doing really magic one that

all that

[Music]

bro City

this is the one and I've nail file is

well crafted and has the initial empty

engraved on it I guess it has it's one

of the master themes man monster master

[Music]

I guess he would say master

[Music]

so that's what events ones are

[Music]

[Music]

these were these cell confusing

[Music]

foreign

and where they go I don't know now I'm

here

yeah I don't know how this one works

we were playing this one this is going

to change to this one

oh my

God

I knocked the whole

with the Sheep

[Music]

oh water

thank you

it was a scene I could Flame

the closest it

that opens it again

[Music]

I don't need now these two are connected

but how do I get up

here

no nothing is raining

and that flower thing looks way too

happy about spidery if I didn't get

warmth

[Music]

one of the monkeys said something about

that yesterday

[Music]

scenes

[Music]

um self-confused

[Music]

it let me down

foreign

[Music]

was connected

yeah that's how I do it

yes I just realized

now I don't know how it works

[Music]

also I probably can't wait in here

[Music]

but if I if I do this thing

[Music]

yay

[Music]

one thing

[Music]

that wasn't shooting fire

[Music]

I'm pretty sure that wasn't shooting

fine

anyway let's see

this one goes here that means that is

it's wrong at the moment

[Music]

so I need to change it

by flaming that one that's

a flame it it tickles

and then I go into this one and it is

here yes

and this is the time when it looks like

a breast means oh I guess

[Music]

by the way the sound makes when it

appears it's kind of

and uh

wavering

and what let me pressing the button

I think now I can go in there

is it going to reset on one of the

Buenas

old bars as stairs that's when you know

someone is rich

well he hopefully he doesn't see Inspire

taking all this stuff the security

cameras everywhere

foreign

[Music]

looks extremely valuable okay

so it's not a gem but it is extremely

valuable

this is gonna come in handy what is it

so I get I guess when he when spark says

that this could come in handy that means

that it is for a fetch Quest

I have not yet found

[Music]

no yeah you just remember how much of

them but when I have not been yet

[Music]

there's one more of those

[Music]

it's

seasonalize all over again

largely extremely valuable and inside

someone else in the world so let's take

it yep

I mean these money back involved so I

mean

so you know

[Music]

tricks the cat oh well

welcome welcome

salutation pun

[Music]

ish spying game

hey sorry as well for all his friends in

this game but I cannot stand this game

it's just takes away a lot of things

that make spider won't spread well yeah

I know I gotta kind of scared this game

as

the spider game that isn't really expiry

game but it's not like bad

it is different it's kind of like

not as much as a hero's tale that's

another Inspire game there's nothing

else but a game

it works I guess

it's playable yes what is this point

oh there it is

all right that's fine it's too boring I

mean it's not exercising it's like a 3D

spider so if they could remake this as a

proper Sweetness by and maybe remake the

levels a bit more

an extra 3D that would be nice

and last it right now we spinous the

damage the good news okay let's see if I

can get there

[Music]

nope not that way

oh

[Music]

okay

punish it with some flames

so is this the great place

you say it does a lot of hard work here

maybe you can use this old manual I

found I have no use for it

wait what's that spark voice maybe it

was this is the user manual for the

professor's Library maintenance machine

it's part of a machine we need from out

here okay it's not even a part of the

machine it's just a mind you know

so

that means I got only three things left

then one of the best thing is very old

nauseous it's fine so far

[Music]

I'm head worse meaning

[Music]

like

I get this like the chest but I'm going

to see uh I'm gonna kiss I can get

a little bit before Oh so I don't really

need to pack tracker

[Music]

yeah I wish I could press a button to

speak to him instead

oh yeah Elsa

[Music]

I had to do this any questions

why can't Quick Escape or not like I

don't know

fairy shrine

the voice is really helps bringing each

time

I wish I could remember and keep their

voices more consistent but I guess it's

fine

[Music]

I guess the inking spring

[Music]

so let's see

thanks

yes yes

okay this is ice

that's not my damn

oh

okay

I guess this is how they get across

or more of needs

is by the cat I borrowed from those

rabbits he's supposed to make you fly

but that shellfish smell won the ever

moons I'll never get up to that ledge

for that

oh and I

don't get up there so I guess I'm going

here the underground pass

need some consistency me

I have this is one of characters I don't

have to remember their voice

welcome Raiders again

did not die

let's see that's welcome

welcome title Tommy welcome Nishi hello

welcome Factory

in here I'm driving it's a very heavy

bunny for yourself yeah I'm anywhere

before I have more people see the

hatchet's still here

don't keep worrying

don't you worry Don't welcome everyone

all right

hey

present myself I guess

I don't have rain smell yes yeah right

about this

I am from I am playing three spider in

crash games at the moment

and I will

I do want to 100 them but

I am some games

yeah

are asking too much

so um

yeah that's about me

so how

does the word for you after me she

[Music]

I hope you had a good good stream I was

about to say right

me just having a comfy time watching

videos

okay that sounds comfy it's always a

coffee time with me see

yeah

and it's kind of things

it's not

I think I can charge them yes China

so

okay on way up there you go no problem

the Sheep okay yeah this is a princess

butt slam

even though he uses his horns

he didn't learn it from a kangaroo and

apparently

in the previous game did some butt

slamming

though I guess that's where it comes

from

okay

it makes sense I usually eat after

spring too I can fully understandable

yeah how long did you stream or just

kidding it's curious

[Music]

that doesn't change that you need it of

course that's it doesn't make the

mistake

how much I was a film scene wrong thing

[Music]

camera

sorry thing

[Music]

ah

thank you thank you for following Tommy

I'm not always following them

how dare you

need an online

I could watch these things for hours

this index Frozen fix it I hope it comes

in handy so

another cell if you might not recognize

this inspiring game

on Gameboy Advance which instance in the

title spiral Adventure

which would be the international title

by way do I need another Hedgehog

oh

I see I see

and attack the Rhinos as it was called

in North America

is an isometric game

that kind of tries to do its own thing

about Spyro

you kind of still have the gem I mean

yeah you still play a Spyro you still

have the gem collecting

but

it's more instead of individual levels

in in a Homeworld

um

it eats every level is connected kinda

if you play it we're seeing a hero state

or kind of any

I was going to say open world game it's

not the exactly an open world game still

at separate levels

but it's not a classic Spyro

and then you meet characters and all of

them

basically and it's uh YouTube go on the

fetch stuff for them

or in this case the story stuff I do

stuff for enemies

and it's a game just full of match

quests

[Music]

work off the chest

how can uh

you know

lose the Hedgehog I wish I can use on

this one

speaking of

oh that was the wrong thing

uh come on go ahead hit that spider you

can do it

it wasn't the one but there's just a

pink one I don't have the pinky

I don't have the pinky

I don't have the red key though

oh this is there this is a right this

nightclub is so big it could only be

Bentleys

it's some of Bentley's climbing here

so what

oh yeah I see what I need to do this so

all these um

patch quests will each give me

a heart

for some reason they've changed it

in the original spiral

I swear blue

but then they change them to purple

there's another in the second Assad

again I'm not sure why but

those this graceful rhinox have left the

earth that is amount you look ready to

fall apart but has splashing then I want

to get rid of them

when

it's

colder head bashing or something it

might make sense

allergy no

I didn't mean to do that

there you go oh

okay you want me to destroy more of them

okay

wait is that Sheila

why don't even inspironment

adventuring again

Sheila we need to get the heart from

your land to stop this horrible rhinox

took all of our our artifacts so now we

keep the heart in the museum

if we can find artifacts and return them

to museum I'll give you the heart

I do my best Sheila

[Music]

another another fetch Quest

to get the heart and the heart is part

of another fetch Queen

yeah Sheila let's let's not just stop

but you you can't you can't you can't be

like okay can we get the heart first

stop crypto and then we can go and put

artifacts

I mean

you don't trust Spyro

that's it that's kind of a problem it's

like

quests in games in general

it's one thing if you meet an unknown

person like yeah sure

I could

trade if you do something for me

you did it for me and I give you the

stuff but this is Sheena she knows

SpongeBob

did I clear out this area

foreign

and also

this is my basically every

thank you baby except Sheila because in

my head Canon Sheila is a trans woman

she does not have a pouch

she was born without one because

he was a sign made at Birth

but now everyone is

respectful accepting her as a trans

woman

as a woman in general

yeah

there's a note here read it

Shayla

did I clear out this area no I did not

I felt like um

not doing it I felt like I missed

something

who also has a baby

I think

maybe I miss remembering I made machine

in Taiwan

I ran fine indeed this Rose has an odor

only a kangaroo that appreciate yeah

because kangaroo is a smelly

it's one of the plants Bianca needs when

I smell

nice graphics

anyway

yeah I don't I don't

I don't need to speak you I have a

yeah

I don't even remember what it was fast

now

pointing out Spyro here's a ball I found

container powder scented like bananas

needs powder makes my ass why is it just

it's a new taste sweet it's one of the

fertilizing ingredients we need to find

for the monkey marker

yeah she doesn't have

baby

but I don't think she has a pouch either

no

maybe she's powerless as well maybe

she's zones or a trans woman

tree down there

there's a bit of land

is so flat

so I can't get up on a high enough to

get over here

I wanted to jump

I EXP

oo

I'm sorry

wait I've been here

I've not been here

yeah I've been here

well

thank you yeah yeah it's it's

where was it

I mean what's it

okay

wait all the very dusty books

oh

[Music]

yeah I read that from the old in 30

before and then I'm gonna make a joke

oh then dirty just like kangaroos Okay

so

in a solid now anything

there you go

that was too easy

this is a metal awarded to those who

exhibit an outstanding degree of other

it's one of such Birds missing medals

it was this all there was here

I guess but apparently you can probably

look around the area you can get up here

but yeah this is a really small area

no one area for a small

there's another one here

no one

where was I going now

wait

oh yeah there's a tree or so before

I am

maybe it's

yeah I think I went down

but she got a baby she clear that's a

pound

you don't need the baby to help out but

at least it makes it clear that there is

a pouch

yeah wait a minute

is there any other place here

this is blowing as well

and also nice that you don't have to

activate those each time but you have

like this each time

and I think it didn't explore this whole

area for me so there are more places to

go here

I think I remember Sparks imagine

smelling kangaroo is many examiner book

maybe when he first got yeah it was

maybe he didn't mention smelly can use

he only mentioned smelly books

and then

I made it she made the kangaroo

excuse me

oh yeah and then it was you

about you

Yvette what the animal is this

cheetah

friend of

winter

yeah let's try it

nice and let's let's eat

a dream no no it doesn't work

yeah that works

and it's gonna

flashes on these on the stream it dashes

I mean by Parts but in in

in action actually for me I guess eight

flashes out

but yeah I didn't go in here

dingo or maybe

it's mentioned before here

oh yeah

one of us in here too

oh does it have a game for me to play

hello spiral viewing my match would cost

you 2 000 gems suck it isn't free

yeah I'm not made of money

perhaps another time then

no

I guess it's a one-time fee hopefully

and I guess I have to pay you money bags

I hope I get the money back marvelous

just go right through that door there

it's

hmm

I guess I can't find right more than

this

this is the reason I see more Italian is

fun

let's see

getting back

where is my double gem

all right

um

let's go over here

we'll be right back there okay

okay

[Music]

here

[Music]

now we're in doors here

I didn't mean to step you off me

how did I get back

raising some other place I'm missing no

I

no

I am utterly confused

yeah that's the religion thing

his effect of being invisible

no

why don't you jump

in a plastic jump button

and there's no

okay I can't jump out like that it's

just

can I require you some precision

another checkpoint very nice before I

need to do this annoying jump

didn't remember it

okay Lottery midday

[Music]

to give to him when I get back to the

event

such grammar yeah you don't need to

sneak anymore you can just run where's

the Run button

don't need to sneak

foreign

I guess he would say half

without a DC

he's one half of one appears to be some

kind of chest key

we see a pink one

so back here and

he's used to Whirlwind to confuse this

cat

and then we leave the cast to this

often

until it gets on

confused

[Music]

no I don't run away kitten

what

[Music]

I'm here confusing me

yeah this girl is the ones are yellow

ones are very hard to see I want to pick

up this this is the Master Emerald

to do it

[Music]

count

ing wow wow wow he's standing what do

you think you're going come here

and you're like

stand on that

like a good kitten

there's a button here

foreign

so I didn't have to go around the whole

thing

this is an abstract premium black cloth

the colors glow in the sun this could

come in handy I want more paintings

pain teams

paint the things

[Music]

I need you again kitten

this is where they call these kittens

no they are calling kitten

when

[Music]

you know

yeah it was here was

no there's your stone here

okay I keep pressing

um

back sure is a cliff Community this game

don't have a use for this at my whatever

let's take it anyway I mean it does get

his job because you know how many

how many GMCs picks up everybody

from everyone

yeah I didn't mean to run into a wall

that kept

again

I can't just kidding this kid is gonna

get so confused why does my face hurt

why do I stand against a woman

[Music]

this laser fence is not causing any

damage

but a spinny maintenance

I guess that's fine if we hit

Bianca police say this is a money tree

must be out of Seasons if there's no

money on it I mean except for uh I guess

that's not money

there's some green thing on it but it's

not money

it's one of the plants Bianca needs for

a spell

thank you then

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

piece of paper but not money yep

it's some kind of

decorative thing

yeah money in this morning are

must be gems but whoever made our art

assets for this game are confused that's

why you enjoy this Splendor that is my

not just to Humble up though about

I'm looking for hearts if you have a

heart which adopt and no way no chance I

will lend you the heart for my Mansion

though say threes on 500 gems

and what else oh you don't have enough

gems so I don't be cutting deals not

items like this okay so this this is

what this kind of what I mean

all of the characters like

oh he ripped this Taco to take over the

world but I need you to do these favors

for me but money back is like

it's you could still argue that it's a

favor yeah you need to do a favor to

give him money

but he's not going to put spiders

through any kind of challenges or

anything it's just it seems hunting like

oh you have to beat me in this game when

I wonder why it's like yeah money and

I'll give it to you

yeah

can you drink

so

Plus

plus there's a difference money Banks

takes advantage of crypto messing around

in the world and he and like one of my

money of it

he's just a businessman making doing

business

ruins the world we're quite aspire to go

through different

trials and stuff multiple of them

and including things

like training Hunter's own pets

it's so hard you can keep inspiring the

things by needs to stop crypto witch

hunter what's the cause of

there is sick this is a slight

difference there

didn't Hunters did Moneybags sell the

bomb stripped one year

this is a businessman during business

in the world and Rift was kinda

taken over the world without the bombs

anyway so

hmm

only if it is

told me that

nothing inside that one even though it

was kinda alive let's go back to the

this one hello

because a hunter is all about being cool

I don't think management would let me

well maybe we could replace him with

seven really clumy things

I don't think these questions need any

more tune

the prep those Vice missing comma and

sure thing Hunter

missing confidence

Quest accepted

the more bombs then

I'm just going to

come on Spyro

foreign

I don't think I can yeah

no especially after that happened

well I don't know it actually works

and uh I'll check that area

oh it looks like someone else needs help

me Prosperity doesn't know that guy's

name he just called him Reese as a

nickname it's just coins coins not

approaches exactly it's just like

Annie's one

okay

yeah I didn't need that much exercise

so are you

I don't stop then

okay I guess not

I guess that worked

am I going to use these for

yes

just a massive coincidence

now this isn't the place I want to

this is the place I wake up

I need to clear out this area first

oh

um bird froze

working a bit of extra weight why don't

why not exercising

we use one thousand gems someone who

know this process or whatever it is

I guess but what's really more

I've had to collecting any other Hearts

thinking something

don't forget to have here it was just me

here's your thing

[Music]

these are dangerous expensives clearly

for professionals only it's one of the

massive themes Tunes

I guess so

so yeah we need to put it here

and then

we need

oh no no yeah

I'm done for the day okay so are you

going to stop expecting his thoughts

what kind of walls are these

oh yeah that's the other place I'm going

to next

is these cheetahs are weird

I know you can do it

I think Maya I thought I was never gonna

be able to get up that thing well I mean

I I guess you could just stop it running

and then you fly off it

you know grab both sides and then you

lift your legs and now

I don't know it's easier it seems to be

an easy way to get off that thing

this is

going to know it says one of the harder

points to find

is one of our plans for Bianca and his

first spell oh you don't see

this is the last plan let's give it to

them to Bianca first pound oh that's

nice

no more plants

wants

what was my body doing find some greedy

things that I thought you wanted to go

with things don't be really things

popcorn

all right you can't even wait

there we go

long enough

I don't think I can walk anymore

this is like the third one in a row

that says that you're not going to

exercise anymore

and they continue exercising

what's with these cheetahs

I I don't get him

almost thought her name was trees

and what streets what's three trees I

mean her name was Trish but

it was sweet

I sadly got my money's worth this time

oh my God YouTube I guess that maybe

that's been it's not

speed you can't choose normally

and sheep in a way

oh look it's Kitty

I'm probably either thanks Mario okay

you're like the fourth person though

unless that's your breather

all right there we go

and beauty

I'm trying to buy the workout thanks

Spyro

what's up okay

versus not affected by wind attacks

let's put it there

a lot of hundreds weights here

this is a character with [ __ ] oh I

wanted a lot of a lot of characters what

would you

I mean like

wouldn't you like the other name

gliding pass it's so one hip

health

okay

it's flame all day right now is while

avoiding the Rhine of mine there's

another one of these

no

apparently not

pen nuts

getting rid of those

wanna try again it was kind of hard

actually but I don't have the bombs

why they laughing

anything that thing I would say

dependent knots

unless they give me Gems or something

I hope not

playing right back from C

I'm working out

is it working out

because it's a place

we're working out

Birds nothing but lightning yes five

times a week then I think

fire camera name to him

apparently

that should just avoid them okay don't

make it slightly harder

team yeah it makes sense that something

flying would be affected with strong

winds at the same time they probably

used to strong winds

and maybe maybe

it's in real life what do they do when

they start

lightning thing

when the sky is lightning

I really dislike the flying in this

hello

that's

medium

I love Miriam

or gambian I mean this

is fine

I see you're back

snake but my

Garden once

but like I was cleaning up it was dark I

couldn't see really

I haven't seen it since though

I don't know where it went

oh that was close

why is there an accounting

[Music]

and punk funny is wearing her exercise

outfit because this is the move up fire

why is it so bad moving up

they really love when a storm approaches

but it takes shelter than this it makes

it nice thing what kind of snake a corn

snake

this gym has a weird floor plan yeah

it does

what's with all this watching this is

like a cool swimming pool area

you go here to practice swinging

I guess there's shiny outfits double s

swimsuits

okay

yeah right there

outfit

by the time

there might be differences actually

but what I've blamed it

multiple times

the views are small I think it's very

soon in it's very limited imbalances of

the edges point point one point one one

oh I see him in the water

quality of the graphics in this game

and it's really the heart is quality

it's not like a beautiful snake uh

when I saw

these Serpentine bone

all white and blue eyes for me it was a

love it's very sad

born

get rid of all the enemies

foreign

material is that because those are not

large those are heavy those have a lot

of mess to them but they are not large

I can't [ __ ] up the key apparently

well against that sucks

good job

foreign

[Music]

like I'm not here

did react

points how often these agents get

captured it's probably the time to be

discharge them yeah

sorry I'm confusing myself

[Music]

just

causing myself

with a lemon

what is this one doing

I just understand

you honest this was short

thank you

The Red Door that's been there yeah I

know that

oh yes I it was just that when I went

into the first one I don't remember the

whole climbing session but that was just

what you want here

so

no guards just got done

now knowing Garden this one

I must just have some well

demanded on

of these speech I could see that

I wish I had a

this is one hair what appears to be some

kind of chest key

this one actually is going to be a funky

but I mean

the idea of the one two I want things

no that's not exactly

he's a small cuphead made of bronze

Explorer Guild it has intricate carvings

on it but it's just a heart and it feels

a bit heavier than it should maybe

because it's cold it's dark and Nails

we need to get this to the professor

[Music]
