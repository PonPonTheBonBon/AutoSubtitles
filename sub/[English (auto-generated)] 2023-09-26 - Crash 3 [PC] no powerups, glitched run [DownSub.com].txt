okay the stream should be back and you

should have a little delay

hopefully but of course I can't promise

anything no I re that one you can't get

to I reject that one

too you already got fun of

this

so when do I have

the let's switch over to

FR there's some picture and there's some

audio

there WR

many

is quite he very

quite and I I guess SP L to and I no one

empty what do game constantly triy to

control my

mouse No No it should be good

one

so you thank

yes iming Blast from the Past it's Crash

Bandicoot warped for it's Crash

Bandicoot

warped okay I'm going to show you some

cool tricks because I'm going to play SU

crash 3 without any

powerups now when I'm playing this game

H I've noticed that my my voice gets out

all

Stuy that's outside my control that's

just how specifically when I run this

game that causes it so I'm sorry if my

voice is terrible let keep the intro

because we're here for the game and not

the cut

scenes cut scenes okay the first step is

easy pick up

coco p say anyone who visits the bner B

clean up after yourselves works hard

keeping the bur Barrel clean and I

appreciate you helping me keep it that

way yes please do

that so first step pick up Coco because

she needs to be picked up step to switch

to Coco step play the

game and so playing this game with our

powerups uh requires a lot of skills so

let's see how tough these levels will be

without

power I know these power levels are play

without power

crash why must you always mck in my

mud I have a mask helping me too we will

find out which one is more powerful soon

enough so you got my is fun looking back

at that blinded virus stream because

I CU actually managed to do a bit stuff

despite being

so

[Music]

blind okay I got my

shocate there we go Prince mittens

is so how far do you think I go in the

game without before I

die the must have fun yeah it was kind

of it was

interesting

okay okay I got that far before I

di

I don't know if you want count that

death

but oh

[Music]

I I am now

hydrated I

miss let me from

me I want to do

that oh

this is related the lowest graphic

settings g keyboard Graphics off off is

even start FPS off low off off off off

yes L

settings so

as I should probably Pi up some extra

knes

I can't drink an entire full of water in

a single work day well I almost walked

into

that 4

[Music]

hours I will be back in a few minutes

okay let me pick up some

uh more lives I think the 1 L per hour

okay so 4 Hour work only for workday

that's like half

time realize how

much work things

like kitten M the

kitten prin

[Music]

me oh that's lag yeah I wish I had a

better

computer please find my new

[Music]

computer please give me motivation to

clean again as I can send my

house come

[Music]

on when you work your temperature

exceeding

45 C

you drink a lot of water makes

sense that makes perfect

sense okay so far well not so good

because

apparently I'm not doing that good

without power

up despite this being the first everel

before you even get any

powerups there yeah that's some

right wait

nothing gem I even got a

gem just a

heup oh didn't you get he

cups see I got the gem that was power

what's happened I went to the toilet and

everything

changed everything does change when you

go to the

toilet you know like a new

man

okay due to massive delays and

the in the Stream because my computer

was strugling so much with running the

game

and fin have play Crash

now really should have made like a

swimsuit

Coco a cute one piece swimsuit nice with

the bikini too but I would assume she

one piece swi

it

deep no

no we're deep we're not that deep this

is quite shallow at the moment we'll get

deeper

so checkpoint good

can't okay yeah oh

yes I'll see if I can get the gem on

this one

too

and you don't get PowerUp in these

levels so this level should be

unchanged then goes for any Coco

exus how do you get relics with no

crash Dash H well apparently the speedr

runners do not use the crash Dash to get

the to to even do the speed

running I'm I mean obviously because

they have unlock crash guys but but also

apparently the speed running technique

should quick quick than crash of course

I'm not good Ed

it that's

a you should be able to get that but I'm

I'm bad at this extra deep

yeah I'm going deep very deep

now all youing the restroom stalls at

work certain changes

never you're never the same

yeah changes it every time you go

in

[Music]

going get

stuck go

Jem yeah I don't want to go in those

places

then anyway I'd love to stay in chat but

I got to go but if you're still on lat

when I

return much love to

everyone we'll see how long I will be

streaming have roet whatever you have to

do so you're going for all gems I guess

I see how much I can

do thank youmen for being

here don't ask CR for hat H that

g Co exclusive level

lat hold run for top speed control suff

is

though

s you can you can watch your Coco you

can slide you can spin this you couldn't

do in the reason

game

it's a

TIG

K the camera Stu there it's

like that's what the P

say that's what the bunny say I'm tilted

it bunny trust

me that's that's the sound bunnies make

this chat is going crazy yeah he out SC

okay you guys have to read the chat

now it's the tiger Scot I like this

music

nice she's the buny girl

girl that yeah that's that's a very cute

funny

growling

two okay oh you mean this yes that was

just death number two again on a level

where you don't even have power ups you

can't even use power ups okay this is an

intentional

[Music]

this

oh come

on

yeah the game isn't running that stable

and the computer is quite a trouble

around game come

on so I have so far accidentally died uh

two

times and intentionally di like

10 it's

not doing so good I wonder how much it

STS on

stream it stutters so much for me at the

moment that game this oh come

on oh why why doesn't why doesn't the

compu like this

uh L very right than

animal and the first game was the

worst but this this this isn't too

much there we

go at least to accidental death that's

the problem with a the scrollers you

kind of have to intentionally die if you

want to

[Music]

gem but it is what it is sometimes you

just have to die if you want

gems

that's the lesson of for

Life obviously wait did I count

intentional I mean it's too too non inen

you can't count intentional separately I

guess

and then I guess it's a good thing that

cats have nine di obviously not that

c

[Music]

Kitty as soon as I complete the five

levels I'm going to do the

trick and Cort tin get crystals byebye

bring them and bring them to

me like can you pass by earning the red

gem elsewhere I guess we'll go back

in probably because it has to load more

of the level faster than levels without

an maybe doesn't it load the whole level

right away look count to intentional

death me

too cuz I'm

still I guess the animal is going quick

but

feel like one was doing Dam much quicker

than when you

walking at

Le how such a large gap there that was

not the intention of

this

there you go I got across

it

bar so no checkpoint that means that it

will stay up there not sure what it

prevents it from moving on

but for some reason it doesn't want to

move

on

[Music]

wee one thing I hate about growing my

hair out is getting random hair stuck in

my mouth

yeah I know about

that the red gem I need that

one oh now I come to use the Bazooka to

destroy nro

boxes that means I

I will have to use the mask to destroy

the ones I have to

destroy B I need some extra

knes I'm kind of running out of them I

only got

14 then we get a head in the back of his

throat and can't anything about

it haven't been that bad for me at

least

one

more oh you can stand that

good would be a shame if I fell off

immediately I mean you can't die on this

level

but little jump yeah got two extra lives

good good

let have

[Music]

that there you go that was the

time wait I'm going the wrong way this

was the wrong

bonus the bonus platform almost

gone bar is the wor

something

when I can't read

polish I haven't polished my polish

SK now that

segment I probably still not get the gem

or do I cuz I don't remember the red P

boxes maybe it doesn't because I have so

many of them

already yeah and it's only eight more

boxes I might actually yeah

plus one need box

now six

more there oh then we got four of

them H so two

more this is not easy because the game

is is

lagging I'm doing this without power up

plus

lag M why is everything

wrong okay another

this this this is why I haven't been

playing oh that was some

lag massive lag

it's

oh for whatever reason the bonus coins

coins you get when the icon turns green

has only been giving me 12 instead of

60 feel like that for a couple of

weeks I see which one you're talking

about

and

no I mean it says when you get the

uh uh 60 bonus you all for get that 12

at the same

time how am I supposed to get all of

that maybe I only need to get the green

one

guess I'll try to only go for the one

and see if I can remember that

though just pause

things there you go that was some lag

Adventure

yeah the compet not like to run

SP is it is it who well that's this wi

word yes if if that's how many times

I've died I don't

know people are writing to me on

the on this

Discord time

now

there we go finally that that's that's

[Music]

took luckily loading screen does not

count to our speeding I think making

skin wngs final one oh I forgot how it

was spelled but I apparently remember

correctly yes it's

the sound which is spelled

SJ well sometimes

not but sometimes it

does like in the

word which also has the

sound but that's

not H is H as spell s

this is also a level where you don't use

powerups I think that's why they put

these levels at the

early uh the swimming level the the

riding tiger level and the g ski

level because these levels are the ones

you can't use uh PowerUp team and

because you don't have any power ups in

the first

world that's a perfect way to waste

those waste

now but you don't really have power ups

uh when you reach the second area as

well because the the first Power you get

is

uh is

the uh Bop being stronger it's not

really

anges do

because you kind of already do it if you

couldn't do the Bell flop in the first

place and that's how we unlocked it that

would actually be

[Music]

interesting but I will skip the power up

regard this of how useless it

is as as

the a sneaking

ability still need the sneaking ability

but it's definitely not a power up it's

a power up you can only use in specific

moments and not nowhere

else it doesn't even work uh whenever

you want it only work in the specific

moments they have designed for

it there we

[Music]

go I was thinking might have

been that would be

Sho SHO T TJ makes a sh sound and that

one pron the same way

that's that's what what the word you try

to

spell if you add um a V at the end you

get sh which means

SE up flop cop her butt like sheing she

something

[Music]

yes at do a ramp stomp World

celebration to

do there we

go now I should go in here

so it doesn't really matter where I save

it I do have extra saves just in case

you know

what you know

what I will uh make back of

things and then w w w Mo over and then I

will overr St one cuz I make the copy of

it

now so I should go in

here no don't do it I I made a copy of

it already I said it copy this and got

it back up so how the way you act and

this by using this and it's a very very

very easy method first thing you

do because when you interact with this

you get this many Zooms in and

everything

so what you do is you walk up then you

do that but but you have to get the menu

to pop up at the same

time and I'm not perfect at that there

we go now it did not zoom in as you

could see

now oh the camera is actually not

behaving as it's the camera is supposed

to be

Frozen and then you have to switch Coco

for the camera to unlock and then you

switch back to crash for the camera to

and

then Perfection is a miss and then you

do

this oh wait I oh no wait I didn't I did

the wrong

glitch oh

great

great this was one I was supposed to

[Music]

do oh

perfect perfect because I was supposed

to go in there can I see

um can I do do it one more time I hope

so

yes oh

no now I'm playing blind

again on

yes BL blind run of Crash crash oh

hello stole the

pretty not going to face off I need take

them back in Gladiator

Arena we're not going to the Gladiator

Arena we going to hog

right actually I need to exit and save

before I do

something wait what

happened what

happened um I can't ex it before it

dance there you go I need to go but

might and

say hopefully I didn't correctly what

what happened something

happened this should work on Console

too but it is a a few steps you have to

go through to do that I need

speed okay I still still have Coco

good

that means I can uh

save

because it is still technically

closed let's

continue we level

six H it is said that that's the easiest

gate clip to do I just did the wrong uh

glitch first the the one I did first was

meant to be used for different to get to

the other

Gates but now I did a quick one because

by using the glitch you're allowed to

you can slide off the platform that

takes you to the other area and uh get

into the behind the second gate you're

of course not meant

to wait can I still do this oh I can

without the power up um yeah see my

powerups my list of power is

[Music]

blank cheatting wait isn't the

cheating this is this is tough how you

play the

game see I don't even need the power up

b or rump St H you can still destroy

those metal crates any

what's the point of the first

Power that

frog got to see the power of Cocos

but if you couldn't destroy those crates

that would make it more

interesting well at least I can still

get the Gem this

level oh and did that way to get through

the through through gate one or gate two

rather I want call to for simp sake did

it look easy or

complicated I would say that I did it h

because it's quite a few steps and I've

seen even obviously speedr Runners are

oness uh because they're trying to

speedrun and obviously you are more

likely to fa at it and but really

thought it was going to be much more

difficult especially when I'm doing it

on

stream

but

Shea's well it sounds like you need a

Sheila plushy with a big but oop

side one

Sho one sh two

Sho wait what's

an if if you put an r instead of first T

that'sa that's a

p ETA spends with an e instead of a that

would be well that's a number

one I think you meant of which

is the

different see

right oh FR

died look at CoCo

glitching glitching all over the

platform yeah the game isn't running so

great on this computer it's running

but

me

yeah this is the challenge I wanted to

do all all this time and now I can do it

because um thanks to speed

running I know how to do it

now that's how he speeds through things

okay I remember the wrong

priation yeah

EA will will be EA in my di it that

that's the pronunciation of the first

number but as used as a noun instead of

a

numeral and uh yeah it would be a bad

name for the letter for the number I

meant if it was the same as another

[Music]

number did I get

everything yeah I

[Music]

need I didn't compute the sound of O and

I didn't remember how yeah yeah I got I

got

that and need to remember correctly the

a sound it has like two

sounds it has proper a sound which is

different from a

a

e which is used in other dialects in

Swedish not

mine my D only uses that sound when it

comes before an R sound is very weird

how that

works hang

High when that first one is what I

remembered well yeah you can plus the

letters have the long a and long e they

sound very different but the short e and

the short e are like the same in

myal unless it's ahead of an R sound

because then it's a and

a so there's a

difference oh come

on too

[Music]

early that's now this

where's my best two

[Music]

c here we

[Music]

go

around

swords like

crazy so I can remember when to use a

versus a or o versus uh yeah they have

different

sounds oh it's very easy to here

oh

oh I

mean accept the letter O can make the

same sound as a one that a bit

annoying to be a bit more consistent

there Bic

thing you here should be a

bonus I see I can't pronounce them for

oh no but I can

hear

[Applause]

we wa I did

[Music]

it ni like me when I get a lot of fruits

I get the

next

there you

go

yay every

box one extra knife and 72% of an extra

knife 1, more coins until I have 100,000

oh that's a lot of

[Music]

coins oh I miss some

boxes I miss some boxes how silly of me

do I get the old boxes yeah I think the

bonus extra alternative entrance that

this level

has what it lags I got stuck on that

thing and I was think it only has nro

boxes

so should be able to use the green

exclamation thing at the end there

and here we go oh don't close

yeah there was like this dud

here yeah there's the yellow

gem and because this one could contain n

this one doesn't but it could yeah you

should preferbly activate it first there

we go every

every that means that the Jem is

mine

C coins let you R the tummy bunny the

bunny

tummy I said you wanted the bunny belly

I guess you like the like bun bunny

belly has the Elation but bunny tummy

has the

rhyme and if you try to combine them you

get bunny

bunny bunny bunny bunny bun

or bunny

tny wow her laptop turned into

a a power Crystal a master Crystal only

the clear gems are slave crystals or

slave gems I me hint win first place in

order to earn the power Crystal oh oh

hint this is what they have to do to

progress as the game thank you for the

hint hint this is the actual goal of

this

level hint to defeat the boss to win

against the

Boss look no power

[Music]

ups so I said H since this is level

uh oh when I guess noow gem now I take

care of the L at Le is not

the that other level you know in in rest

of Cortex which is called the r of

Cortex but some like to say R of the

cortex which sounds funny

and he's not an cortex he's the cortex

well I think he a

lot yeah that that one where the car was

sliding all over the

place yeah this is a lost no power

Crystal no Clear

G Bunny bum would be a very

diff different area of the bunny body I

don't know oh bum is but right

and no you you are not allowed to rob

the the bunny's bum Need for Speed level

got to beat W is watch me this is is the

first place crash crashed into a cop car

and wasn't arrested this was a Swedish

cop okay oh no it isn't it's clearly not

Sweden but it was Swedish police officer

who had moved to well United States

which this clearly is based

on considering the signage and

other buildings and

stu okay can I get all the

[Music]

[Music]

boxes I don't know how

this they actually lost

well all boxes

got now I just have to

win oh missed

it well I can pick up the gem at

least

don't it's

[Music]

something yeah inish bomb is but I mean

I wouldn't be up opposed to robing the p

p me no but I almost kind of post it you

know it's a sensitive

area yay I got the

gem win win now I have to win again

though because I didn't win

yet whenever it's

downloading

[Music]

I wish you could

like press the

um and that U because you can only

switch character when you are able to

control the

character but it would be nice to be

able to really switch character at any

point and then the character switch

happens when out of automatically when

you are able to control C if that makes

[Music]

sense meaning that when you enter level

as crash and comes out the crash and

crash does his whole uh showing off all

the Collectibles he's got and then you

can press the character switch button

and then you see that it switch to

crash if you try to address Coco first

is and then it would just wouldn't

switch over to Coco when he's done just

an

idea it would suddenly have speed

Rish come on I barely touch that

part I should have scraped off it he

should have damaged his

leg I keep missing

[Music]

that oh so

close Okay let if I this is the

first

motorcycle

race hint humans are vable to

bullets what is

it

okay one more

try can I restart no they really should

have a restart op

for these

[Music]

levels they should have rest every level

for that

matter they added it in Crash four such

a terrible option because if you just to

restart it clears the level off the

memory and then it just has to and it

just reloads the whole

level

but if you do a Time fail and you die it

just starts

immediately and this game does the same

[Music]

thing you if you start the time to you

can at any point just restart the race

restart the time F and everything is

reset immediately but if you don't come

first and choose to try

again does

the there we

go it it has a long loading period

because it clears the whole level of of

memory but anyway I won and that's what

matters hint bunnies will take over the

world it is prophesized that bunnies

will take over the

world yeah yes you wait I'll take over

the

world oh I got 36 subscribers at the

moment well thank you lot for

subscribing

why why is it why does oh yeah yeah I

was going to say why does it say that

you have given out 38 gift Subs when I

got 36 subscrib that means that you're

basically g a subscription to everyone

who subscribed at the moment and I think

that's basically what we've

done tomb

time good ey mate good ey mate the name

and Uka UK and cortex gave me orders to

bring the crystals to them during the

yeah who

okay who

cares it's so weird what he's the only

one has an Australian

accent across all all of these

Australian

characters well time to start hunting

ponnies why would you H what what's

wrong with

PES where we already have our princess

yeah I'm your princess I hope I hope I'm

doing a good as a

princess I know I'm not really wearing a

princess dress but honestly you people

probably prefer when I'm not even

wearing a dress in the fre

space

subscribers that keep subs from me only

one who isn't is jto

oops I was a bit blow oh more crash

hello Roxy yes I'm doing trash three

without

powerups another gi gi up to so yeah H

says progress there below there is

supposed to be the uh Power RS as you

can see I have no power reps but I got

eight power crystals you can't do that

I'm the normal game play so I'm doing a

bit of special gam playay at the

moment that

now so now Roxy is

subscribe I hope you happy

roxies didn't

want thanks

for okay I need to make a bit quicker

here

oops SM I knew that yeah less you we the

more some of us like yeah I knew it I

it so for

the

yeah that's why one of the outfits

options for the ponon mod will be

underwear but it will be the hardest one

to unlock you have to deserve

it you have the P one in skeleton thr up

her underwear unlocked from the start

but that's not the same thing as you

know the whole pom

pom

you're

welcome AR Min is so nice and kind

giving gift Subs to

everyone to random people

[Music]

to the

people guess if you do give them

no burning mush wait who's that sorry B

mush if you've been here

before I can't remember every name there

some of the name like think I recognize

but I haven't seen them on this chest

for a long time well this might

encourage him to come back like uh uh

rankon I do respect her being busy all

my respect to that yeah but she did show

up when she got the G

start going to dve me insane if the

total number isn't an even

number I start8 now oh I see you you

actually wait have you used stop on the

because I don't see I didn't count 20

gift Subs I was bit confused about

that yeah I do need 12

more for the final emote

slot and then I just had to

draw watch sure we can switch to that I

hope that

worked that's a p in

Sp with turn

I'm I showing sadly no T tmy WS yet I

would have

that thank you you're welcome I hope you

hope you enjoyed the

too and that's why we're here right I

enjoyed

[Music]

the hey I can do this now I don't trust

myself maybe if I double jump or

something go get

you let's see do I get a gem on this one

or do I need a special

gem must

tummy I know it's this

very

oh oh yeah can I get across

that almost as I can't do

that very tempting yeah I hope I really

hope I can get

the B tummy to look so nice on this 3

Model I guess it does look nice on

me there we go

I should rather restore this off the

checkpoint so every time I die I can re

pick them up and get

more come

on I I I know I miss the Box anyway so

what

what does the bo

M I'm not getting every box

[Music]

anyway yeah I'm missing like 20 b this

this that one B I skip and 20 more boxes

somewhere

so yeah I need that gem to get into that

area

but singing yeah that's me got a lot of

people here hope everyone has a good

time watching me this with this glitch

run was this the 10th

level what is the ninth

level

10th level was mean that I

yes go

level Coco is such an interesting name I

gu crash and

Coco and let's try here and let's see

how many intentional death have do this

time probably none but you

know it's dark it's already dark I don't

need it to be

[Music]

dark oh W that was

close course would be an intentional

this would be an accidental

this

whoops he got um hold T to his

head I got

it

whoops oh good it activated which is

annoying when me and it activates the

checkpoint that's I thing they I was

going to add it in this game but I'm

pretty sure they they didn't like add it

it just happens that PO is still active

object that can activate

boxes they kind of forgot that that's a

that's a

thing and then test it

thoroughly

you see those banners I'm probably yeah

we got a banner here see this Banner

here with the Chinese text on

it you know what this Chinese text says

it says Great

Wall which refers to the Great Wall of

China since it's Chinese written in

Chinese in China it's therefore just

says the Great Wall it wouldn't say

Great Wall of China because it's while

you're in

just like how in Sweden we don't call it

Swedish meatballs which just call it

meatballs we don't call it Swedish Fish

we call it pastel

fish because we can't just call it fish

because fish is something

else Miss music again good there we go I

completed 10 more five levels 10 more

levels in total 10 levels in total well

celebration BCE okay let's exit this

area

point and let's enter the next

area you know what that

means another one let me try the

checkpoint

yeah K kitty k Kitty let's see if we can

do

this yeah this is how it should

behave I can't uh camera doesn't follow

crash until you switch coca then camera

moves quick and

then I do

this

that

uh it didn't work

though can of kind of landed

outside as long as it works that that

what matters

there you go and now I should enter this

one and I will argue this is the hardest

one to enter so

first you do that Swit the Coco and I

P one more

try go switch

Coco perfect and then I go in here

switch back to

crash do

that swi to

Coco switch the

crash switch to Coco and

then this is the tricky

part I move to the par I have to try one

more

time oh the sish fish gummy cand I love

those yeah those those are not called

called Swedish fish in Sweden that's swe

so no need to call them

swe okay come on there we go kind of yes

it's def the thing is Coco can move

through walls crash cannot crash can

jump Koko cannot I me coko can normally

jump but not in this

thing so I have to switch between them

to do different action and I and I need

and I can't move to because C can move

through walls she can actually move

there we go she can actually move off

the level which will cause oh that's

which can result in h dying you can

actually die using

this in The Warp Zone warp

room and now I just no

no well I guess

I

whatever I said this is the hardest one

um go

now soon as I get get in there I have

the hardest more them done obviously the

four the the fourth the fourth area is

easier than the third area because I

have to go through the fourth area to

access the third

area is just this part that is

annoying come on I can do

this there we

go and then I do that there we

go for some reason the camera does not

follow along in

here don't know why and there's Next

Level

Dynomite and those UI elements are also

not tied to the camera right right now

you've gone and done it them crystals

are mine I'm not going to Face Off you

he speaks like I'm going to meet

him I'm kind of going to the quite

opposite the opposite

area you did cheat not this isn't

cheating what you're talking

about I don't know what you're talking

about this is perfectly normal gam play

okay this is how you play the

game

so this is um a problem because uh I

can't reach this box now because this

one require double jump I can't double

jump I got no

power so I can't get the gem on this

one so oh

well SM here did

yeah at least the hardest uh place to

get into is

done the uh fourth one which I passed to

get in here even is

easier and I would say the easiest is

the fifth one going to see how it gets

easy and easier

but course to take sure

h

now I got T

je I'm sitting up

straight

but hey

Ro think comp

basically

overheating over heating up the like the

table stand some so if I move it colder

SP watch it it feels very

but that does mean I have to move

it from time to

time

h i piing this up for

extra

life I not going to get

the

[Music]

we

[Music]

[ __ ] Roxy one come

come I could do the bonus item now I

don't

know oh this jump down just too late

[Music]

keep from the

way he I was going to say this

uh oh no those Chumps I almost made so

you you can't do them

almost but I'm going to show you that

you don't need the

powerups because that was one of my

arguments that I feel like this game

would just been better without all the

powerups powerups makes the game too

easy the

uh the

where so doing this without power apps

has a bit of challenge

having a bad computer better can run

game has chall too I know I keep

mentioning

but but it is a bit tricky if like the

videos although it says I have no drop

fres interesting

enough it is a when it started and jumps

keeps forward quite a few

frames but I didn't even touch the lava

that or magma or whatever you want call

it am I supposed to do this give Dragon

B that have Curr or you give up

that so yeah this isn't going as great

as I

[Music]

hope

come on there we

go there we go yes there we go I think I

need the yellow gem on to get the boxes

box gem on this anyway but I need the

double gem to even get the first box the

so ignoring that you need a double jump

to get the first box I wouldn't call it

that really a platform challenge it's

just that they have intentionally done

that to show that you have a dou

jump which I think is a good design in

the game

but of course the problem is I can't

reach it maybe there is a way to reach

it maybe the

uh read your text then Jurassic part is

frightening in the dark all the

dinosaurs are running

wild someone let T up the P I'm afraid

this

seems har me cuz this shirt don't act

like Bary and they think that I dinner

not their

friends I I don't really remember how

exactly this song goes oh no

trouble oh

no swim through time I

guess does someone want to redeem a

swimsuit you got it

right there we go that's the swing

SE this one I wonder this level will be

without powerups and for anyone not sure

what I mean is that we don't have

powerups

in but I destroy this here we go it has

been

destroyed sounds like you remember hit

from the other day I mean I've heard it

um before

it I'm I'm not completely unfamiliar

with

ah apparently there is a very easy way

to get the red gem easy within quotes

because you can glitch yourself through

the ground at some point and

then he got sucked into that oh I didn't

even get a

checkpoint didn't even get a

checkpoint anyway you can glitch through

the ground and then you can access the

area of the red gem below there the

speed runers used this technique to

quickly access the um the uh exit portal

of

the for the red

gem problem is that that I won't be able

to get the Gem if I do that and I would

also not the speed runs aren't all yeah

and the camera does not follow me along

down there that's also a problem and

speed Runners don't go for a red jum

anyway because is only

nor there's nothing

here ites

matter and I long lost count of the

death

I'm

oh go

win the way you sucked into his mouth

when you touch it I got checkpoint I

guess who who is nice

you can see

SL I kill you too you didn't leave me

last time I just feel

like okay

there is

the so that's

spny and I have to activate the question

mark lock and get back

there that's going to be fun I

can't I can't attack that

one p is hot wo

wo oh

my bad

crash do you think do you think P looks

nice in that s [ __ ] does it fit

her from off her body

well I I do think it looks really nice

and F

so there's a st's going on with

this this face D

so very K

me I'm happy to think

so make sure I'm CLE out down

here when I

proceed wish I could destroy

this oh I activated this one okay then I

just need to get back

somehow we

go

this a speed running technique to do

doing

this if you get good Rhythm you could

move quicker H I should have left this

uh anyway it shouldn't be too hard I

think there you

go I should have killed this thing and

this is back here I can activate

this and watch the

fireworks and now I can actually access

this and get a checkpoint luckily they

have placed a checkpoint

there

pe oh no the dress is trying to slip

away

W yeah green ones oh more of

them what did this come

from oh I was trying

to stat

reaction that attacked it attacked

it

okay the dress is G me problems at the

moment let me let me fix

that there we go

now wait I'm i l here no one will see me

anyway

but I prefer it being on me properly

Crush really let him go

go

yeah H he has been very before no it

wasn't

done so close being

done

con there's a thing in

way there we go and then get rid of

you then I just let everything

explode give me of sharks I don't they

don't eat me oh

no and hopefully yes here we go and this

one I got the

clearer th power crystal and a red gem

woo sooner or later my metabolism is

going to crash and I'm going to become

very fat with the way I eat oh maybe I

should consider what you're eating

this a suggestion you don't have

to you can eat whatever you

want I say suggest that you

should it's quite chocolate M like

[Music]

one

[Music]

got the

same there we

go there is 12 right

yes is fun I guess so but you

know be

mindful

you pesky little rats aren't going to

back off eh just you continue to gather

crystals and see what I do we see what

you do I won't be able to see what you

do because I'm not even going to face

off against

you I ate 1 kg slam of beef roast for

breakfast today that's a

lot that is a

lot

1 kg is about

2 oh you only pay 2 lb for 1 kg of meat

that's good

price there yeah that was some

interesting

moving so still no

powerups

and just give me a short

[Music]

moment there we

go there a camera on to follow along

or well don't B me

away now it's covering the chat I can't

clear jump this level let me try that

again looks like I'm not going to get

over

that I can get up three boxes not

four that be the idea P wear her ears as

talk that's an interest no gem no shiny

that's an that's an interesting idea P

covering her

to uh upper body with oh come

on it

worked there we

go you can get that FL just very very

tricky come on we can't do it there we

go stood on

air

[Music]

no that I that's complet

wrong who and

nothing premature

celebration

no

you bring shame to your

people come on

now there we

go a bit tricky to

do that is it

possible but I still can't to do that in

the uh dino level because

[Music]

um and that one has a box on top of it

that one is fine

box I'm going to pick up n this B for

now see

this oh oh you can do

that

okay

okay I'm sorry about the celebration

what's wrong with me

[Music]

yay pish just messing your head up I'm

sorry I'm

sorry

Jem I didn't mean

to I'm trying to be a nice p

p wait what

[Music]

you wait yeah this one doesn't have

boxes on it right

this only ends in a purple

gem yeah I don't see any boxes I think

this is one is

boxes no boxes no

boxes so I just get to the end and then

I

[Music]

die that M zigzags the who can't

jum

just

being if I'm adorable does that mean I

was

adored no boxes no boxes no

boxes

come on yay

yay

W did you get the right type of box I

don't know CU box can mean a lot of

things what's the Swedish word for

Bo yay I got it and now let's continue

regular

level I want to do a double jump there

it didn't

work

oh that must have

[Music]

hurt this witch word for box

is can you

spell oop po set not really nox P yeah

that's a that's a bag such as a plastic

bag or paper bag that kind of

bag not when it comes to a bag like uh

fashion I guess you that's by this

accessory

and luta is one word for boxing sweet is

finished probably take a for sish word

L just because it's very

similar or it might not be from Swedish

word it might be from the same word that

Swedish got it word from and I don't

know where Swedish got it word

from L yeah there you go now you got it

correctly that means that you should be

able to write the plural form of

L without me even pronouncing

it h

is the main

word

oh now I got all the gems see see what

you can do without power

WS the only thing that causes me issue

is the Box placements of some of the

boxes they only need to change

those no don't don't thing you're

missing now is the definite form of the

singular here we

go Crystal Clear gem purple

[Music]

gem

Road

crash and I'm guessing it's and L

exactly that is

connect

[Music]

oops forgot to start anyway let's pick

up all this

[Music]

L I want these crazy bright orange

boxes someone has just dropped off on

the road here we Rec the

[Music]

hazard

where's the Box this one not one

hand since I'm not going to win this

race

anyway I'm just going for the Box

[Music]

this to tack

him

attack in traffic is very

R if I remember correctly yeah wait a

minute all right it

worked do matter right if it

worked I got eight more

[Music]

boxes

10

should be one

here

than this time I police

car we go

fine

put it to

one why is the last

box there it is I see

it I almost Miss missed it I took it

with the

head crash head crashed into the box

whoa got the

gem so sub means more yes I think I did

get 3 five Subs last time I think that

means another emot SL that was why I had

the yeah I think I got 25 last time so I

said it to 35 H yeah so 35 is another

emot slot and 50 is the final emot slot

they're very stingy about those but I

still want to write again the request of

twitch to just expand because they

really need to do that because they have

quite the

competition plus uh people's usage of SE

part services and

such which I'm not asking them to block

or anything like that I'm

just uh I'm just asking uh because what

what happens is that pretty much use the

third part of services that streamer are

paying these services to get more emote

slots then encourages users to install

extensions to use these emot slots in

these emotes instead of subscribe in

which means that twitch is losing out on

money

on so that's a bad thing for twitch

there now let's

win so there's an incentive for twitch

to expand the game

[Music]

spots and I should definitely expand the

tier two and three emot slots because

currently I got a single tier two and a

single three tier three OTE slots so you

don't really get anything from from

subscribing for the higher subscriber

subscription here they really should

expand those lots as well to encourage

people to pay to pay for the higher

subscription in other cases for example

the

[Music]

uh the streamer W wixie Vixie who has a

secondary Channel which which is Al

affiliate or is

is what am I doing

is it's his partner but uh the second

channel is only

affiliate which has more emot slots so

if you pay two subscriptions you get

even you pay for a second subscription

on the second Channel you get even more

subscription

slots but it's just more convenient for

the users if they could just pay for a

tier 2 subscription instead of a two

tier one subscription of two different

channels that's just how I was

thinking

yeah even though I kind

of didn't know what I was doing that for

a moment I still

winning

Mak sense I have so honestly you should

have like 10 of those oh yeah yeah like

you get like five

follower emote slots I think you should

have more follower emot slots and in the

end even if you have a lot of emote

slots you don't have to use them up even

even if you have I think you should have

like 10 follow emote slots even if you

have that you don't need to fill them

out because it is the streamer who

choose chooses where to put emotes a

streamer could just not use a single

follower emote and just encouraging

everyone to pay for

subscription I

mean but the stream is very restrictive

at the moment quite annoying anyway if I

I will ask for help to write together

that one and

then well you crashed a few parties

before I never expected you to make it

this

far if you don't turn back I will F A

Thousand Years of suffering on

you so

yeah you talking

about

exactly and that was for two and

three wait what was for two and three

and the cat SC into rabbits the

takeovers

become oh yeah yeah cuz you yeah yeah

because

um wait why did the

AR everything turn into bunnies that's

not how I thought it

worked okay now I actually confused how

that thing

works guys i s

the oh and I'm not sure how this works

anymore

I know using

emotes I mean I'm not using

emoies is a bit buggy in my on screen

CH but I and but it seem to be very

buggy Well

w i can get this

than that's how you speed run

is and and how you can walk in the cross

there really allows you to skip a lot of

level yeah those are just mean

Xboxes

point

oops too far away there we

go 95 very close and ex you go here six

up D

it

that

good I guess putting it in a complex P

confus just use the first em n there's

some complex pattern to how it what emot

going to replace every em with and the

um the code is just wrong I need to fix

it I just not bother to fixing

[Music]

it

see what why do you need double jump

before you can use this do this bonus

anyway

okay yeah yeah

yeah

food chain caterpillar eats be car

carrot eat

Caterpillar e carrot be PNY wait a

minute cars don't eat caterpillar and

bees don't eat bunnies something is

wrong with that

one no I miss

[Music]

one I can move these there we

go there you go that's how I

want each of

these

perfect

[Music]

oh

[Music]

no I just have to be quick

then there we

go cuz we double jump you can I'm on it

and you don't have that time

limit that's how food chains works now

uh oh okay I mean if you say so you will

never

lie

[Music]

oops

[Music]

right

[Music]

checkpoint contain

an wa gem power

[Music]

Crystal damn everything

now missing six boxes the some of St

would be this green one oh I keep on

okay let's see if I can do this

wa wa

Dam got everything I

need is it going pretty well doesn't

does

it

don't

you were not say so that's not how

spelling you

were I still don't know what say so I

never looked up there we

go power

Crystal Clear gem let's move over to the

next

area he yeah let

same do anything stupid you know CU

since I can't mess up the

game all already I wonder how hard is

this is to get into this area like I've

not done that already to get into the

third

area first I need to activate this thing

which takes a few

attempts uh there we go suppos let's say

some means

incorrect is

thing and also it means a stand in

finish here we

[Music]

go I'm ready can you

see did you follow

along did you catch the whole process

how you do

this

uhoh last time

yeah come come on you going to this

Crush oh no there

go I need to stand like somewhere

here

yes who follows in here so I'm not

actually level

16 you know what's the second one yeah

it's the spin spin spin ah you little

Vermin are way too stupid to understand

what you're getting yourselves into this

time you've done

it done what oh no I skipped the boss

pal and I'm messing around with the game

in a way I shouldn't and the person who

who is responsible for the whole time

toing is getting very

upset

stand like in Jo joo's Bizarre

Adventure no okay a stand back in a

stand when you put stuff

on yay but I don't think I can get the

gem in this

one was it boxes here I don't

remember stand like standing oh but not

as stand but two

stand and now

whatever no I miss

one

[Music]

wa

goodbye

oh this are

quick stand like stand like

okay that's what I

wanted I can do this I can do this trust

me I can do

this there we go just took

P now see supposed to

jump also can refer to something else

being

hard hard like like in solid or like

hard in as in

difficult I guess hard like not give way

hard like difficult hard like

concrete nothing nothing the material

concrete but as in in something being

complete hard like resist for

uh like when you see something

exciting

okay like fum yes that makes

you say

so I see I see yeah I understand I

understand and that's that's

a that's that's that's definitely a good

moment

[Music]

she looks pretty good in

that pretty sure this area was on the

other side in PS

one I try to

[Music]

be

oops I

died

it

happens but I didn't lose a life because

it was in a

[Music]

bonus

well what's the opposite of a d because

I like he man that D TNT that cast down

that cast down to one and then it says

zero I'm pretty sure wouldn't be a SI

texture but it says Z and it just

doesn't explode so you have to spin

[Music]

it that would actually be kind of funny

wait is

there

what that

happened okay

[Music]

and there's a box up there I don't think

I can reach that

[Music]

box why does that work sometimes but not

sometimes I guess I'll just ignore it

then I'll just ignore

[Music]

it Head Pants yeah I need some head

pants cu the game isy

[Music]

evil yes I got

it

yeah I'm not getting that one

though I really don't think the

explosions explosions should go through

both L

more that's it's me I guess cuz they

could like programmed the explosion area

plus the boxes aren't moving

around you need some

B understandable maybe I should really

the uh

what that's not give B reps though but

you know you got you get to

te you like

that

and it makes might make you to say

[Applause]

so and that's

fun that that didn't

work T trate

why okay in that case you might have to

leave the stream and come back you might

have glitched

I refreshing the uh not refreshing the

stream because that's enough bying and

uning but refreshing that that would

refresh the whole redeem menu and

everything there we go now it works yeah

it's just it work yes it is good good

there is

bunny

tummy now you can tickle

it

okay tickle the

tummy tummy

Tickler tick bunny

tummy yeah I want yeah this should be a

redeem for tickling it it should be a

redem for petting it we should be

cuz that would be like an animated hand

I could make like a basic 3d hand I

guess I guess I could have like

different street hands depending on who

is doing doing the redeem

maybe that would be also fun let's say

because I got into this area now bye bye

blinks

so it wouldn't be too much uh but having

like different textures on the hand

depending on who it

is so they can have like their character

could I could probably have a some

different and that's some

[Music]

stuttering oh yeah I need

boxes

having some different

hands that would actually be kind of

fun

sh

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

right is this last

one yes got the

D and that's the last that I got the

C

who I guess you would you would have

like a skun

handan I don't know what you would

have but a skun would just be like a

black hand I guess bluffy of course like

f

texture I don't know what what Janet

says andone doesn't have to be an animal

I can have like a human hand and robot

hand format H

the so I want to switch to as the model

which I might have mentioned and then

they should be a

I'm a more cybor yes going have like a

cyborg

hand so uh so you should be able to do

like

um head

pads tummy tickle and whatever else you

want

fresh we meet again I'm actually Co now

and Dr cortex want me to teach you a

lesson you look strange no one talk to

you anymore lost follow yellow arrow at

the top of the screen which isn't yellow

orange I think cuz it was yellow in the

original game but now it's

orange

well yeah SK look at the yellow AR at

the top of screen I mean it's yellow at

I guess was no you keep yellow on your

right red on your

left

wait

yes which I'm not mistaken I could be

wrong uh when in in United States on the

side when you have those I think

reflector something uh you have those

that are white on the right side and red

on the yellow on the yellow side on the

left

side you should so you should

yeah

well one in Europe there's not app to

every European country I think Sweden

has white on both sides but they have

different symbols on the reflectors but

in sever European countries they have

red on the right side and white on the

left side because that that

uh reflect uh because they vors that

reflects the uh the lights of the cars

you should follow you should be in the

same Lane as the cars with red lights

though you have the red reflectors on

your

side

while you should not be in the lane

where the car has the white lights so

the white reflectors are on that

[Music]

side anyway so yeah so when when you do

head

pets tummy tickle whatever else there

should be

bonking H it should check who is doing

the redeem and then it should use a

different hand for

that but it will be different 3D models

with different textures hopefully I can

do something like that that would be

really nice that will have like a a a f

hand a human hand I guess a cyborg

hand I could do some special three

moment

for uh

yeah active active users here active

Chatters but uh that doesn't not mean

that it's really

one but it will really reused for

whoever

has somehow that would look

similar I'm done I could send you mine

yeah I'm not going to do it anytime soon

though cuz that would be after I do the

the actual three

first that would be like the last thing

I do

probably but certainly would be fun to

do I wouldn't mind seeing your

character but yeah and at first I need a

new computer and then I need to make the

p p spe the

mod and then I can do the

hands after I and then I will start with

a generic hand which appli to everyone

who has who is not programmed

yet and I yeah yeah I I understand that

you meant that you would send back

I I assume I like your character sheet

or something is a part of your character

sheet or some drawing of your character

showing what your hand is supposed to

look

like or a put of your real life hand who

knows I mean I also need to make my hand

that's going to take oh I see I see so

yeah okay so first you have to make your

hand and then send it I see I hope

hopefully I miss that one

no I mean I need to make the actual hand

yeah I got I got him

now yep now you do here I I was behind

the chat a

bit playing in C I try I think

I'm chat at moment really depends on how

quick you chat can chance can't

chance sometimes chat is very quick

I'm playing WT and

chatting War Thunder oh there you

go yeah it should it should be um

do

which Thunder not thunder so

yes I had to

confirm but doesn't it include one of

those that's

bad but the closest one is this one so

War something this not the one

[Music]

oh

yeah what war some

there

WC

that

one I actually wanted to use the uh

sorn symbol but I apparently does seem

does not seem to be part of this

keyboard but I I do have te with the SL

through which I'm using as a substitute

for the set

Thorn okay let's see if I can do

this just remind you no power

but I do you got two color

gems I got of course I also don't go by

super because that's not what you have

when you first

things wait I don't I don't yeah this is

Lev why does this one not work

sometimes I can't check my

PR

the

[Music]

uh

boom yeah I think I need a yeah this one

requires an alternative entrance I think

too no m is not I don't

remember actually grinding

with Swedish finish Vehicles ooh wait

send a hand I don't think that's don't

cut off your hand please yeah I mean

don't don't send you no jet is going to

make a hand first

and I guess has one or zero hands I need

to make make

another I've already cut up one hand I

need to make a new one to send off ow

oops wait we got cuz I don't have this

spin power up how is that going to work

on a spin thing that forces you to spin

how does it's not going to

work yeah here you go this one forces

you to do like a massive spin how's this

this one going to work oh he's just

doing it he's just doing a regular

SP you're still very very Floy you still

have

you still have the

effect effect apply don't don't spin

okay so that's not going to be a problem

oops that's a problem but that's not

going to be a problem because I can

sniping so this one I can't

do

wait this one I can get to but not in

the that fin

[Music]

level there you go oh

through yeah that one it's going to be

tricky wait I'm not sure if I can get

the boxes on this level no I can't get

the boxes on this level anyway so I'm

not doing

this

yeah oh why this see more

hi

thing now the float was

broken the float was broken and I'm

broken come on

it

Point yeah it's definely that that bonus

does not contain like 40 boxes or

whatever it is y I did it I Le complet

bones

honestly I don't care if I make mistakes

while I'm right even l so when I'm

actually trying fly a FL B I mean it

makes sense yeah I didn't think you

cared so much about it anyway I

mean it's not too

important

and I just said you playing a

game number 19 so

about that optimistic that that make

sense

powerups it's the two the two kinds of

English

all kindness well if can't use this you

person makes

mistakes but then they're like why it's

I should know Swedish yeah because you

finish Happ

[Music]

Swedish I know English Spanish and

Polish Al that doesn't include my coding

languages yeah I don't they don't really

speak those languages but they kind of

fall on a different kind of C language

but is still is still

know I just know how to code in

JavaScript jasp is usually One Word by

the way otherwise because yava is a

different language and it makes it clear

split up the

start no I couldn't I couldn't do the

bonus in this there's five boxes in the

bonus I can't pick up and so I can't get

there's the area I can't access because

I don't have

the double jump super spins in me

no shining I

know I'm sorry if there be such a

disappointment hello B I'm not going to

fight

you time to glitch on to this final

Fifth and final

area so there are some gems I can't

get this area so step one safe so I

don't have to start I'm glad that I

haven't fail using one of these

G no that wasn't switch this

okay oh first try

nice how about how about

that okay and this is how you do

it

along

well Stars aren't really for shining

yeah they're burning they

burning

see that's a that so and now the game is

broken

so I must restart

it so I actually paint I took it one

step too

far was that a premature celebration

again

Oran did you

yes that was the that was the very thing

I said that

I I do something a smashing blast from

the

past yesi

you're always by vicarious Visions

always prettyat surely celebrating how

you yeah

Le it's Crash

Bandicoot it's Crash Bandicoot does it

load the last file that I saved or

something I

not last f i loed War I don't know

what's wrong with

me there we

go y it remembers

everything first try again I'm getting

good at

this

no the game is

broken I broke it I

mean I'm pretty sure

yeah it's not working as it

should that was

me and didn't what what's wrong

now okay one more

TR

that was weird it did not break as it as

as it should

have Dam we

go

wait wasn't supposed to do

that it might I might work

though

now

that that was a we motion does it still

work yes it

does but the camera is buged it's

usually buged here but it's

fine there we

go yeah this is that's the correct level

the usually follows along into that area

so so you want to go a few rounds when

this is over we'll see who is

obsolete I intally left you I didn't do

the by B against

you w yeah I did this time you can

celebrate so now I'm doing this level

without just to remember remind everyone

I don't have a same

power

but yeah he's not outside from

res he's okay you check that you could

check imgb

or crash B Wiki or something about the

voice

voices fre

me

W

no checked

okay you

checked I wasn't close enough for

that there go that's what I wanted

[Music]

down I'm buing no you y this

checkpoint

okay that one and that

one oh no wait can I even get

everything

do I have the no don't I need the green

yeah I need the green

champ so I can't do this level anyway I

can't get the I need to find green

J before I can get all the boxes on this

and it going to be annoying to get all

the boxes because I have to jump out and

land on those question explanation mark

Point boxes and I don't I don't have to

do it just once but

twice I least if it was just once I

could just retry it until I get it but I

have to do it

[Music]

twice unless I can find out I got

checkpoint or something because in that

case I only have to do one get

checkpoint and then I can focus on

another and that might be what I have to

do

yeah and and

greena W

nice got skip the

bonus I got to pick up some boxes okay I

know your

boxes yeah I

need

okay that worked but wasn't what I tried

to

do p

boxes P boxes pones you want some

[Music]

PES Bing

Magness

[Music]

bam

bam yeah I'm far from getting boxes here

I need green jamer box

bikini yeah and yeah you've seen the

bikini P Pon has it's it's quite

bikini and that's another reason for the

3D model pon pon because I can make as

many outfits as I want cuz it I'm I'm

not I can draw you've seen my you might

have seen how I draw I just don't draw

as good as the artist who made my pom

pon model so if I try to make my own

clothes it just look

terrible the pink P

yes the triangle

bikini TR

TR

train

train bigy

angle Landing from a jump with constant

the a boost yeah I know St okay let's do

this let's do this it's a nice bikini

I'm happy like

it Yep this one

already let's

restart and my joke was that you'd make

the bikini top to be box it stops and

somehow make the button

work box es I mean the crash boxing

spicy yeah the triangle bikini is a bit

spicy in is nice and spicy bikini and

then you see me being tracked and

everything and move around when R the

bikini and of course a when you choose

to activate the and my gra just

disappears leing

[Music]

again

[Music]

fine 4 One 42 one

Zer there we

go now I can win

ni

W now you can s Cate probably

properly well I did it I got all the

boxes and not too many

attempts

celebration it is quite a late stream

today but yeah want to try something

different you

know

[Music]

uh here we go time this is the Flaming

passion here's a green Jem oh yeah yeah

this this I think I know how to get this

one the special gam lies at the end of

the death rout I'm going to be someone

wrote to me so cover

CH I'm going to be tired at work tonight

I mean you are free to go to bed you

know what's your excuse well I was

watching a very cute bunny streamer who

is who has like and and as you watching

you gain like points you can use and

then have her like where wear a one

piece swimsuit instead of a regular

dress as well as like a sport dra and a

nice skirt you can see her tummy and you

know I was Bing

that well I mean that's understandable

so to drink some C

history

yeah oh that one

[Music]

died

W here we go can I do it this time

yay that

thing no I saw this Shadow only is like

that Che point I don't have to go back

too far wait a minute there's a death r

on this one I just start

anyway to restart anyway let me get some

back Chate should

be can by these

points

and here was open it would be

downloadings I can just press for

to

oh

that

[Music]

oh

[Music]

mind back with my no wait mind drink

this

[Music]

out let me prepare my drink it's

[Music]

well

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

now I got my chocolate and

my is apple

juice

yay

H H is impatient

yeah H is a bit

impatient

[Music]

pleas jeez and let me let me just

quickly check what was my you

[Music]

know to make sure people aring stream

stuff oh oh my

people are writing strange stuff and

people seem to be in agreement over the

uh the death fall animation

of the pon mod cuz when you fall to your

death and scratching

Coco their shoes for flyer but Pon isn't

wearing any shoes except very very rare

outfits oops so therefore having SHO

Supply up would not make much

sense I guess the three options

were have pon pon feet fly up being

severed worn off from the body could be

quite

gruesome but I guess it could be made in

a com comedic way

to see Daddy no it's not it's not

it's not alcoholic it's just H it's just

use Press app

something and so and the SE the feet

would work with uh most

outfits and it would uh not make too

much sense with like outfits with uh

with the like skin

Types on CU how did it even get TN off

in the first place and but um I mean I

guess I'll take that back pleas D

probably weaken

body if the b gets ripped off the suit

ripped off the suit certainly still be

on

the and if it's a shoe or something

maybe the shoe fell off that happens

maybe the socks can fall off too I guess

I guess it could fall I guess it okay

I'll take it back maybe maybe it makes

sense but basically every outfit

and the one that it does not work on is

evil pon pon because evil P has black

fur and if feet will be white

F

oops app

use yes wait I can again I

sticky I did had T of yeah

and option two would be a bow but I

would replace one shoe I'm not really

sure what the second shoe would

replace this one does not work with many

outfits because it would be a pink bow

it very few outfits has a pink bow a lot

ofies have

bows there's not pink

po the turn

is having her underwear yes just

replace luckily the the two shoes are

two separate object I can replace one

one with her bra and the other with her

panties so when she dies her underwe

like that would be quite com

comical but I can also understand that

they could be could be seen as kind of

suggested uh but it's not like you see

her wearing

comical okay there we go

okay and this one will work with almost

every outfit the only ones that want

work with is are like this the swimsuit

bikini and

the the

uh Bon

suit God I thought it was

over I thought it was over I ear

still work put underwe and then we got

for op them by

yto half of fur there pieces of

faur but do note that

the the shoes are only two

objects so so I can't make it

like I could imine like Coco falling C

pon pon falling down and then you have

like a bunch of f flying

up PO a cloud of fur that could be funny

looking yeah two toughs of fur yeah it

has be two tough of fur but not exactly

sure I I like to would probably picture

of what that would look like

I can

imagine

[Music]

what and the tox of fire would work just

the same as the feet H it would work

with every

outfit uh except for evil ponon who

having black and the top fire will be

white so

I guess you could argue it wouldn't work

with skeleton either because the B is

transparent but it's

fine how pushed through the checkpoint

that was

interesting here we

go W I jumped too far this time try to

compensate another time is

bad game production com

compromises I mean yeah sometimes you

have to make compromises this time

timing

[Music]

up there you go fin I'm not taking

any I might SE this same 14 there we

go

I was going to say didn't I pick that up

before but I did I just restarted

level there we go I don't think I got

this far

before taking see little mistakes this

is a no death

run two separate pieces of power that's

my

rainbow

well oh I can't get that

there wa did see see see this level is

not designed to double jump because with

double jump you can skip this platform

but now when I don't have double jump I

actually have

to time it according to when it throws

like this level is not the sign with

double jump in

mind yeah because that's that's the

feeling I get when I'm playing through

this game this game was designed without

powerups and then they added the boxes

and with the

boxes uh you have to uh do the correct

thing to get the use the power ups to

get but the regular

whoops at least I got to do the death

round now that's

fine but with a but with the regular

level you don't need any power apps and

in fact the power apps allows you to

skip parts of the

level is just you know doing the whole

level rainbow imply that is always the

same ah that just change this color I'm

sorry I don't understand I'm

sorry is po Pawn or what is

po that's run plat yes I got to the

platform after doing a no death run up

to

it and now

it's

you and this one I should because this

one should let me back to the level that

can't take the checkpoints on this

one I got the checkpoint that's

fine now it has enough bow oh I see I

see I see bow now would makes sense how

the seeing on your hand this my dlex

distur me from no oh oh yeah yeah yeah

yeah yeah B and P are visually similar I

see I see the

mistake the correct letter is the one

bottom center of your keyboard there we

go now now we can SP

B it's kind fun

enough it is really written like the

weapon

yep because it's the same

they pronounce the same at least

something that's logical in English they

pronounce the same they're written the

same yeah bow can be the weapon or the

hand or they could be a bow as well or

it could be a bow which when you do a

gesture or a bow which is part of a shi

I think and uh it's also like the sound

of a

dog bow

noted it means a lot of things

yeah I don't like the time with that

one yeah now I'm back

here but it's Yer bow it isn't

pronounced

like bow oh right y's bow

sorry uh

it's not a

bow this s word for bow I mean bow

isog in Finish we call it RTI I wonder

if that's from the Swedish word

ret it's r with ow no actually does oh

the r says it R with oh I see oh

well I show that I know how to it I just

sometimes say say it wrong ah checkpoint

finally where is my

Booka hey's problem

now this part contains

um wait why do I miss so many

[Music]

boxes oh because they are

here for about but is I need to destroy

these and

these can I do

that and maybe do

that okay

so is is going to be

tricky oh I can't go up there okay I

activate the bonus so I get the

checkpoint I need to waste aniz that's

two I think

three

four and five we do have pack and lot of

words in need Hey where's

[Music]

my

thanks is

fine

all right thought I had the

[Music]

mask anyway it should be enough to get

the

[Music]

double yeah I think I mentioned Hy

[Music]

before which was a Don I don't know if

that's a common

word now this

is1 kind of hard to see if it's two this

is level

two now I can do the

[Music]

bonus so it's one mask I need to destroy

two sets of oh can I even get up

there see the laptop one

only no I can't even get up there that

was a waste of time

I can try it again I guess just to be

sure it takes so long that I and start

playing

now I can't get

[Music]

[Applause]

up another level where I can't get

the

dam I got the green Jam

though

yay okay there's one

issue that is that when I complete every

level here I can only face I can not

replay this level

anymore I have to face off

cortex to to continue I wouldn't say

that that it would be a

problem that I that I could could defeat

cortex because cortex the power up I get

from cortex is the Sprint power up but

since that's just a button press I just

don't press the button the reason why I

don't want the double jump power up and

the and the super spe power up the super

spin power up is because those power ups

can is very easily toci accidentally

do and of course the more worthless

power up is

the improve

the what

slam but

[Music]

um bar

differ but I still don't have that

power what is that setting

for no that

was

what Me

Dance come

on run away

go there's another

one there slow

never another one I'm not so at

this why are this many of fires on the

ground oh it must be these small ples

oh I see I see yeah yeah they stay on

ground going thing I'm not sh shut down

like I could see anything I got

smoking oh yeah I already

got

[Music]

we do have te words I read that and

celebration yeah I think I read

that need I need new comments plus

something I completed

level which means that

um and technically I I could just have

defeated engine because you get B but

that's also just a button press I can

just not press the

button because I think when you

defeat

cortex it

um make resets like it opens up every

gate check him navigate freely

it makes things easier to

naig

yeah so let

me do this crash Co remember it is not

only Dr cortex that we battle beware of

ukah ukah my children he is a far more

dangerous enemy than anyone can imagine

I'm not even facing off cortex right now

is that really no yeah yeah yeah yeah

that's the message you get before you

face up cortex and cortex has a message

before you face up against

him color can you pass by all of the

color gems I don't have all of them yes

yet

but I'm not far from having one of them

look at this four after five if one I

get by doing some time

CH

wa and I will not use the Sprint I said

from is is like the the one power up I

have to unlock to like make make

naviga because because the other levels

I don't know if you get the another

they

anything I think

that's

no I leave the

popcorn next

now like and that's not

it

no let try

that

no I think this is supposed to boost it

point

but I don't think see

it

hey you destroy my boss how dare

you yeah I can't take that P

yet

W no that was that was butt

slam

let's see how he this with

me go go go I'm

going my goest

go I haven't go as much as do I go in

here

[Music]

[Music]

oh

[Music]

oh there a Gap there it's a

gap

go why get gold when PS are much

more yeah yeah yeah exactly I should get

the p

gsob 11 yeah itob me on that

[Music]

one

wonder what you supposed

[Music]

[Music]

to I get it I get

it I guess you're supposed to be used

like oh he almost fell off the

platform yeah just the brightness on the

freshlight this is

Chey Chey

I'm so good at this game so I don't need

[Music]

sh dang

it all right all see you're good I am I

need

[Music]

it oh she's still fall up why why is

can't like locked onto the

[Music]

platform when how can it how can the

performance of the comp make

the

[Music]

we there not what no

no

beautiful oh no my dress is looking away

again maybe I shouldn't wear this dress

she just describes to be

no unless it's

slippery you don't see anything don't

worry

guessing I don't have like a camera

showing

myself see me sitting there and then

like the the strap s off maybe people

actually would would want to see

that but it's not like you would see

anything

like the shoulder

start

[Music]

oh no you see my bash over

there wait a

minute I think I skipped that

11 oh yeah I didn't doing

that okay let's save for

now

let me Che we get in here pretty

easy cuz if I go in

here okay so that's some winess okay so

because I completed the next level this

is reset back

normal so um let me see if I can get

gold crash Coco if you have already

retrieved a level's Crystal yeah I know

I

know the him takes face in you know you

can't press to skap this right no it's

because I pressed the button you have to

press the button

twice look

funny frash

COC now this is there some technique to

this but I don't know the

[Music]

technique know the

[Music]

teque no

[Music]

no

no moving the wrong

way yeah don't oh there we

go work

there I just need to find which

technique

okay can I press

p no that's that's nothing is a crash

board can just press the buttons

yet best time okay so I

can't get

uh ready

we have this

pies CL

side

here we go oh one one and a half

seconds these are still

closed okay I probably I probably should

like yeah defeat qu then so I

can get uh all the doors opens and then

I

can

seconds show up H this CL

again show have my gate clipping

[Music]

skills here we

go

yay then hopefully I I don't hold up the

11 this

time was this

L where I need the

Crystal and when I defeat cortex all

gate should be open but no power except

this point but I can't

Sprint I just have to find whichever

levels I can get levels where Sprint

isn't available in normally I think

like this

level okay let's

win and also I mean if if the powerups

didn't exist in the game so yeah so yeah

so you only have to adjust some of the

boxes everything is do except for box

it this game was designed without powers

in mind I'm going to make that

definit I'm going to I'm going to rely

on that I'm going to use this as proof

to say that the game was designed

without powerups in

mind it's only the boxes I'm not able to

get and like two special areas when you

have to use power to aess those are

special areas and it's only to access

the special areas it's not even to play

stream the special

Aries CU I don't know if you need power

in power in speci been able toit

[Music]

them to no don't attack for me oh how

rude

oh now I missed the Boost

pad

level man

Mano yay one hit

point no powerups

knew you were going to miss me pretty

much you're calling out that you music

so I mean if I'm right I'm

right thank you for flying oh H him I

CeX you missed

me oh

hello shoot

me oh he missed

me shoot me again oh he missed

me how about again

oh um wasn't even standing still

in

y

wa w w w w in the Ora game this port

closes so you can't accidentally fall

down because you can just jump down and

[Music]

die to run faster hold down the dark

button I read button while running again

this port supposed to

close so I got that

poweram but I'm not going to use it

defeated defeated

again we didn't watch the CR before not

to my Rocket

Man yep Die end I have to rest start all

over I actually watched the stream I

actually fall down in that and had to

start had to start over the whole

thing don't remember who and maybe I

shouldn't

say

for

S

who get power up too

yeah oh you were there

too here we

go one power

up and now the game should build

open I think that

back apparently the openness of the

gates is based on

the which boss you

defeat that's a bit

awkward well I can leave this time

turn

okay I they should just hold around to

put off speed and then line break

control suffers though that no quality

sh

there teamat

Dy that's not time get

[Music]

that's

not time

[Music]

[Music]

Str Mak

nice okay let's actually started this

time

again

[Music]

again how hard is to pick that

[Music]

up very

hard that here ni again

[Music]

apparently I can't start the time

challenge

level there we go that's what I

wanted yeah you got

that good to have picked it

up there we go now put some

protection oh no oh was say

[Applause]

[Music]

no I think that was a good

[Music]

run

I guess I left the audience to

judge I could have done it B but I think

it was

pretty there we go that's what I wanted

to

do that was level

two that's the

sound the T get crashing

[Music]

why do I

keep

missing more

time yeah

[Music]

yeah oh no noow frame

ratees I chose start not

15 15 oh scra one 15 is for miss

[Applause]

[Music]

it 50 for

Dra oh I gu take this

[Music]

B

wa stop the

timer wait why did you say

that why does the camera check so much

what's this going on let go see I can

get gold without this spring power

up

[Music]

the T it does not need a power up the

Sprints it be kind of funny if the tig

could use Sprint until they get

power

yeah I'm pretty happy with that

like I managed to

uh next how I manag to defeat

the beat every level without a single

power up

I'm sure

I doesn't count

okay cuz I'm not using

it so

apparently

you don't don't get a good time if you

skip boes boxes apparently as you turn

and just speeds

up that mean mean meaning that you

constantly

turn

fine look back and

forth it goes quickly oh come on let me

see me see work is doesn't sh your

time he I got

it

[Music]

[Music]

oh I didn't even get

gold even though I didn't tried out that

trick not far from getting

good go because I only want to unlock

all

levels I think I'm kind of done with

this

game so I should thr it to something

else like I don't know I don't

know I am

no

joke I don't have any other

[Music]

game now I was quite far away from there

so these are still

lck well this is are

broken and

broken sa

finally well

um yeah I

know

kind of forgot what I was supposed to do

there just

keep for some reason I

forgot because I didn't

before active

that I don't think this

wrong

wa oh wait I I

say

y she can't

jump

yeah I could go for the cuz it's a

yellow gem I don't have this one should

have

red

so I can do the red gem

here and then I can try skip

again going to mess mess skip

up I know I'm sprinting I'm not allowed

to

Sprint Sprint does not

exist I just wish there was a mod that

can just disable the power

[Music]

completely don't need boxes anyway

[Music]

[Music]

because

oh yeah I'll take

this

well kind when I have a good

PC

and

switching and I could

also say because that was a idea I get

that first before I play Crash 4 because

think CR this computer is not going to

go well H I will actually be able to

play that game uh on a good computer on

I actually going to be able to play the

game properly that's what I'm trying to

say cuz I cuz I only I have played it on

my other computer which wasn't that good

either but just didn't wa this

never is something

different

to have something that's not a

[Music]

good I can chase it like that

but can

it

who that was

cl

okay right this one this

one there we go that actually pretty

simple fish yeah exactly I could play

that one too on a good computer but yeah

because when I play Crash I have play

Crash 4 how completed almost fully

there's two or if you want three

Collectibles I have not got H but I

could uh just play it well I would play

it from the start on the stream of

course and go for everything and

uh and I would be able to play it and

the game pering well because I did have

some performance while I playing it

played fine

but but I have not played on this

computer this computer should be able to

run it better I think than my other

computer

but it kind of kind of VAR sometimes it

does VAR sometimes it doesn't

wores but um not one streaming at the

same

time nice

nice okay can I get two these

now

on apparently

not no not me nothing

[Music]

me there we

go unlock the

camera do the

trick that was

compl H one more time there we

go

go and yeah this is the m second two on

arm no not my

arm my fluffy arm that will puts a lot

of fur in your

mouth that's the C of chewing on my arm

on my fluffy

very wait where is more up ahead I

guess this I didn't remember where it

was I was confused

first there's

not what's the

[Music]

me can't why

I'm no biting the

princess then is so D oh forgot that but

just that one oh the police cars are St

this

time how

nice

[Music]

I hope and I think I think I get the

[Music]

Sapphire yeah but it's fine it's

fine but it does mean I get access

to the I with the cam camera I can see

[Music]

Stu what's that mean don't P of's eye

oh that time he beat a cortex and fell

into the pit before the level

completed oh yeah it was there was

rocket man who did that that's a dark

time we don't talk about yeah I try to

figure out like yeah because I know I

know the the doing a rocket man is doing

a time tral and dying just at the end

especially on slippery

climb um I think it would also be work

for

um when you do a gem run on that too

because you

know

and there go that one does not that that

one would require you to start over all

over again

anyy and I guess he did that and I

didn't think man did that and so I tried

to remember who was who it was that was

also one of the reason I didn't want to

say who it was because I couldn't

remember because I didn't think Rocket

Man did that I didn't believe Rocket Man

would do that again

again but I guess he was the one who did

it I

can't for some reason for some reason I

still want to remember another person me

as

well

for some reason I want to remember two

people do

[Applause]

[Music]

me cuz for some reason I want to

remember it was a female streamer

so could be

wrong I'm missing

everything my computer is missing the

frames who where are the

frames

little tiger yeah but like

that that was

crazy that was

crazy no the frames are gone again

oh I got it nice nice

no so I need to do a jump I just

[Music]

can't do that kind of not the boost up

[Music]

me I need to do a jump I did it

again y got any more of them

yeah I I would like to ask for a few

more

frames however this uh OBS is not

claiming any drop frames it's just that

the game isn't ring them there enough

rames to prop drop because they didn't

exist in the first

[Music]

place

it claims only 16 frames total being

dropped

but yeah you can come on that was just

scraping the side of that should been

loud

[Music]

right

I wish I wish you could just like I

don't know choose to play time instead

of

like what was kind of time with

that you you choose at the start of the

the uh before you start you enable time

TR think that would be better instead of

trying

to

and and then in another like thing the

time starts when you when time starts

running there I think that's one of them

always both but one is better than

Z oh

one I was running on top of the box

that's not how the game is supposed to

work game is

cheating well SC the side should be

allowed as long as you don't think

clipping your little toe on the cor have

t doesn't hurt obviously doesn't hurt

I've never done that oh look at

that

yay

[Music]

here and you

know the tiger got F the brushing got F

against the side of

the and I didn't mean like clip the

corner of it I mean I mean like scraping

along the side of it I got eight more

again I'm not sure I dropped them to

three before it was a while ago when I

said was three

but it doesn't it usually doesn't vary

that much it like obviously started zero

but then it climbs and I I usually

get around the not that really really

VAR of gam what time of day is and so

but like below 10 somewhere like

that I don't get many viewers I mean

it's still a lot of viewers compared to

some some streamers they get a lot of

viewers

10 is still a lot of viewers for just me

playing a sum game but

um but yeah that will not deny

that what time is it tomb

time

time oh now it's down to six very so

much I'm so confused well you got the

time up there says 23 36 ready until it

St midnight I'm streaming across midn

I'm streaming across two different

days okay do you think I can do this a

second

time show off my skills oh no I just

switching come on why are you spping

up oh yeah and this time he landed on

it must be

there

no come on there we

go Coco yes

good good

and fall down back

crash and there we

go I mean I could do those levels while

I'm in here but you

know I would still have to go back and

enable the uh clipping method if I going

to then move over to the side

things okay this is how you play the

game

right yeah and still no idea why the

camera does not follow along here but

whatever whatever do we have we have

high

time uh Road crash that's a that's an e

one get time long as I don't have to use

the Run

Buton definitely way to play

exactly this should work on all consoles

so if you want to try this on on your

own you can do that it is fun to

actually be able to do it this might not

much to explore and when if you fail you

will fall off the level you will die you

might respawn that's always happen and

yeah you will lose life and due to using

the glitch in the first place you kind

of locked yourself out of H some of the

functions so you can for example not

enable the glitch again so you're yeah

kind of locked out you should still be

able to pick one of the levels because

that seems to reset

[Music]

everything oh yeah and there's a level

there one I should get my Relic

Rel could try you know the the the the

bonus level the whole extra level in

this game in the remake

the future T cuz I'm not done that

level but I mean I when I did that level

I kind of forgot about all the powerups

I have so I canot do it without power

up what everything doing so far oh did I

miss

[Music]

one colliding with

me that is rude

so go too far off the

road I think that's just a one I

stey

what D I lost the

power was right corner after that anyway

so I guess I wouldn't be able to keep

it

W that was

close

finish whoa what time is

this oh don't run into me gold again how

rude again I'm going to destroy going

destroy this

motorcycle that in that

one there you go PA

P oh again I'm going to explode you know

like the Min Games 2

340 definitely the intended way to play

I agree with

you what mean do you want to try this I

can get you through it if you want did

you have this game I don't even

remember oh yeah yeah you have this game

you played the first game now I

remember you play yeah because I yeah I

want see you play the first game not the

second or third game that's why I

couldn't remember CU you play the first

game you f am I playing am playing this

game in a twoo su

way I mean this this button here with

the starting and the face on top of each

Chan is definitely how it

should you don't have to worry it's not

like breaking the game you want to play

the first game so far because that's

like that that's a I remember that you

you shouldn't do strange things to the

game because you might break the game

that makes no

sense you might make the game broken so

you can never play it again but that's

not how games

[Music]

work and it was said like when I was

playing this base games which makes I I

can't understand like no way you can

have a game break itself if a digital

copy of it so you have to re download

the game actually manage to break the

files themselves that could

happen but you can always

just do that fix a lot of

services why

what I collided with this

kind the time oh it I had the time

challenge AC now I remember but that was

allowed in the original game cuz I had

the time to active so I could press

restart but yeah they disabled that in

this game but they have not disabled the

bar

animation that was why I was so

confused why would if they use C on the

p and then

[Music]

they there you go now I can run

over here we go here's another level I

can get the iric in hot cocoa because

Coco is hot I

mean if she could wear

swim I mean she should definitely wear a

swimsuit when she's like on the

thing

[Music]

he I'm

just cuz she's now she's walk with her

clothes on see Coco this is why you

should wear

swimsuit something they should have done

today in the first game but I should

realized that wait that's the thing we

should do in this game and and after

giving her a swimsuit they should also

make her available in the otherb

levels

okay maybe

[Music]

I I'm

smart make my

logic coming

them

no for some reason I saw the bombs moved

but it seems to

be this is an interesting L I couldn't

go for

it damn but I don't think I have to

prove that you can do this level without

power ABS you

know oh my oh my I'm not doing so good

am

I does oh wait than

he I'm should to go this way can't move

bombs move in and then they move all

out I can get all of the

boxes wait wa wa wa way too quickly

[Music]

then

now I have

[Music]

punch yeah this is this is taking a few

attempts there we go that that's what I

wanted

sorry yeah this is not going as I

help why am I doing

this I thought I went see that perfectly

before but now now I'm

strugling that's what I

wanted that's what I

wanted

here we

[Music]

go it's

not amazing

but I think this is good

enough yeah and

then

[Music]

whoa whoa

whoa I activate the

TNT but

luckily no harm

done no I missed

it no wait oh suppos to go under there

gu with M frustration things I'm running

L coins I only have

,5

when yeah I complet thing sounds like

you need more of them only

1,476 more don't know please yeah why

can't you trade Co probably because that

could Ed I guess we could trade car

coins

but

technically cuz we can set up

uh

donation donation

prediction one is like put put points

here to give to Rocket Man and Rocket

Man put your point here doesn't matter

how much point there put there and then

I just make sure that it's a single

person who has put the points towards

the Rocket Man one and that it is Rocket

Man before I can accept it if someone

else does it put try to put that I can

just cancel it sure rocket getting his

points but at least no one else can

steal

point there a way you can do

donations quite the hassle but take this

away

okay can't do

this W good go around this

island that

helps and this time I not accidentally

enable figure that

who that was scary

[Music]

this I see saw something hiding

Okay saw something

happened no I was pushed out by the Oh

I died anyway yeah I did pick this one I

test two buttons but then now Pi it or

one I Al accidentally press the

underwear

it's because you didn't start S yeah

like switching to S the middle of it

really work way especially when I had to

press the button try to do it that great

moment okay that SL

me yeah yeah that that

that the bunny is not as angry as C

is because kooku is pretty angry so this

this s will last past

midnight 7 minutes left are excited when

it's not going get special it's more

special to do is like like uh yeah I got

e it is more special to do it when it

switches from summertime to Standard

[Music]

and then just comes then goes in between

me and the B how dare do

that no this do

best

fine no bounced away

this if I if I don't get this Relic due

to missing 4 seconds that's

why don't cat me off this time thank you

bomb being so kind you not to explode me

oh I missed another two seconds what

what's

happening that was

close there you go that's I didn't get

that last ni I guess I got that two

seconds back

okay thank you did I take more oh no I'm

going wrong inside of this

island this is definitely taking more

than two

seconds 5 minutes to my night there we

go that's the song

tile he just the first time I was

streaming across the

midnight first time ever the clock in

the corner is of course on my computer's

time which isn't exactly universal

time plus 2 hours of

course but it should be

pretty but of course then you have delay

on your side you see the minute take

over a bit after w W what happened there

not going to be a good day at work well

I still think you should go to bed you

know for you

[Music]

s

[Music]

oh where well I didn't mean it like

[Music]

that I will be up playing or will be in

bed with someone

else 3 minutes left you don't say F

yeah I can't plus plus like just just to

we even though you know I'm kind of I

like being like you know

suggestive what do you call making and

and and stuff like that I do want I

should probably make it clear that that

I do have a

boyfriend is not what

mean that's what

mean

um so yeah

I I don't know now made it public

going me

[Music]

here oh I exploded again but I said I'm

not against doing like this this kind of

joke just

we just be open opening about

everything oh no there we go and then I

should run around this side

of did again got about that oh

[Music]

my

sometimes it feels like you pushed out

quite far from those islands like the

colous isn't really accurate to what

they look

like that was pretty quick I'd say oh

very close to

midnight ready from

is less than 1 minute left and a moment

now should have seconds to played

but they not no I bounced away from

boxes again oh and

now excitement

build I don't remember when it switched

over to

59

all right that

again now there we go now say

woohoo oh Miss Missing

everybody

St

[Music]

Nast

oh I got it and then I CR with happy New

Year don't you mean like happy new

[Music]

day but now it's

27 and

Wednesday could have like the date I had

a date before when I started

streaming I got like space I got plenty

of space there something new more

there can day weekday can to have like

same Wednesday or something but like

abbreviation Wednesday

guys okay this is a terrible run I will

actually restart this one I'm using like

so many boxes she's

gone happy new day there

go it's been one minute P me night this

my this is my first across midnight

dream in my time zone of course

cuz that's kind of what

counts I've got a few things that that

is across me that the some time

Z but anyone who streams at least 1 hour

is very likely to do it I mean everyone

kind of does

it I think you can stream

for

whoops I don't think you can stream for

more than 1 hour and

not having me night

some well to be friend it's one time

zone that does not have any inhabitants

which isus

20 but you can go for one 1 hour 59

minutes 51 59 seconds and not have

anyone have

me that would be such a weird s to as

your

theme of your

stream

always streaming L for 2 hours and it's

always the same time every time he

streams because it's never across

anyone's time so Time s me Ni no I got

pushed out

again

po oh I keep forgetting and getting

pushed out and I I miss the box and I

have to compensate for

it

I didn't move to too far I got this I

got the for po hope close doing it too

because that's the box is right up ahead

is where I

from get getting pushed there we go

getting pushed up on the island but I

just need to remember

that

need to

remember hopefully don't get TI by this

song CU we have been playing for quite a

while

now

first time that

happened oh am I ever going to have to

beic on this

level am I

ever my phone's about to go dead yeah

that's just a sign that you need to cook

the

bed well you were here across the

midnight so I guess that

count I give me a

special moment thing for

that now I'm taking quite a different

route now but it just happened because I

kind of went the wrong way up there 11

it just

happened

do get a different timing with this

B oh no h turn around turn around turn

around quick go go quick

[Music]

quick go got that box

too that means I should have a complet

Time

I didn't see good timing c will not

being bounced out of the C

now there we go and now straight to

go 7 Seconds minute I'm in and 29

seconds let's

go I got killed after many many

attempts go go

go I don't need to do that

again don't bounce off the sandar yes I

did actually remember this this

time and that's the swing timer is

almost up great

timing 50 minutes they took 50 minutes

or 40 minutes

since this SW must

me but now it's also Qui that

be yeah getting like The Relic on the

other

levels without

[Music]

Sprint like I can do

things

oh someone didn't the swi

again I try to find a special gem I

don't need to because I'm going for the

time at least it's not R of

Cortex SP the time in that one is

something this up

first

[Music]

wait

that's might have been able to do

that

yeah can probably keep taking damage

thing come

how the uh damaging hit box appears as

soon as yeah

here none less than you being

here I've been going for 4 and a half

hours apparently this stream then I did

the other

stream when I did start

19

and that's 5 minutes before midnight so

that's 5 hours and a bit

more 5 hours and 40 minutes of streaming

and then was like a 5 minutes camp that

a

count I mean the countdown counts

but

well that was a boring joke I'm sorry

for

that I should be ashamed for that boring

junk

but since it's been like five and a half

hours one five and

quarter I should go you

said give me a

moment I will be back after my short

break

there we

go I am
