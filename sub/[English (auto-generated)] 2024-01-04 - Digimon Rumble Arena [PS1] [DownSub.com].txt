sure how it takes that time s to show

up AR I hope it

doesn't equ bunch I can't really hear

what it sounds like

Stampede I could just get a

pillow

like

that and

now it should be better I think I hope

okay so the goal is

just go through single play without

losing are you going to play with huh

which one and I also don't want

to wait didn't I do

that no I actually did lose once

but let's let's actually do like a

proper I'm with

you not using the boss character I press

a not

start that why didn't

proceed and

they outfit redeems should be working

hopefully hopefully no guarantee there

okay

whoa the

bastard the Bain thing you don't have

cannot lose a

single and not a single

round you pressing the wrong

way didn't mean to jump over it

but

dig ball dig

volution taking it careful

here I can't go through those

okay who who whoa whoa whoa no

stop there we

go oh

crap

there you

go hey that was great you

win ready and then I will use Devolution

the second

round dig

volution okay that attack is quite slow

it has a cool

down D

he he

fantastic you

so no losses so

far this problem is the boss but I

should have some experience and I think

I won against the boss without

dying

with so I just have to repeat

that ready Rumble

stop shaling

yourself Contin this

only

okay I still have no idea how to

grab okay I know what the input is

supposed to be

but like that that's how you're supposed

to do it

but but sometimes just doesn't

work like

that oh there go

well we did it Matt you

win ready

Rumble

it fighting

my blue blast whatever that is with your

fire dig volution

I was shooting the too

early dig

volution

battle

do it in the

air how about that come five

combo not using a cheating character for

I

can

Evolution

okay

eat how do you like them you win okay so

far I guess well but I have to be

careful the challenges will become more

difficult

those are the rules of okay I might love

to lose this one I'll still try to win

though but it would be silly if you're

not allowed to lose

this ready

Rumble no I missed

everything I'm missing every

Star

the BS yet oh no it's just

Warman when I need a battle before the

boss this must be the last battle

right need to keep track if I'm batt

s oh or is

it is it well after you not lose a

single round and reach this and then you

have to defeat this

boss maybe that's why this Boss shows up

when you manage to get here without

losing a

around but then I get destroyed by this

B

dig dig

volution

ow

oh get hit but

yes oops

minus

yes wa stand still

I is confusing to

me actually find

this hey that was great you

win it's not the ice level that's

why okay don't use that

cancel dig

volution

no

ow yeah it's not the ice level so that

attack is not as dangerous as it could

be oh attack

yes no my car

oh I take this oh

nice the way the way the opponent

flies oh I missed

it there you

go

yes no don't K me I tried to try to do

like come on where where's my

attack

okay ow that was way too

quick don't remember how I managed to

destroy this bus with gon last

time cuz I don't think I got a game over

against this

boss yeah

that's game over though took hard to put

it together before I could actually

this yeah it comes in separate parts

there well game over that was a

failure where's the highest

score

that's also criticism I have for the for

the

game is that when you choose to continue

the score is reset to zero but you

really shouldn't clear your previous

score should should keep your previous

score

what are you going to play with huh

which

one I really need to figure out how how

am I supposed

to I need you need basic the perfect

run one perfect round go through want

this hey but I was in the middle of an

attack and I must far up in the

a dig dig

volution he smacking

around

now dig

dig I think someone tripped and fell

into hey you're not supposed to jump

over

e h

just some

missiles time to make breakfast with leg

armor

ready now and what are you going to

make hey the opponent has a huge

shield and

a and it's a heat shield

digu

no you fall down thing

again

no I was P into

lava was this battle not over

yet I walk

that there we

go put put the corpse in lava so you

don't have to see I did it you

win

yeah make breakfast while wearing leg

armor I should put on first plate and

spers too just to be extra protective

never know at breakfast will to making

carara that's a good

breakfast yeah wait for shield too oh

yeah you give her Shield while making

carbon

that's what they have when they make

it made made cabara back in the medieval

days full set of

armor that's how we knew

it's

M

tasty don't I don't know what

happened apparently they've had Cara

back in the room and

days with with Spears and shields

BL

here hey how how is you're allowed to

just fly through through

my through my missile and destroy it but

your your laser is not

destroyed ah do

this oh

no

Johnny no don't

eat getting destroy at

moment dig

digivolution do your attack get stronger

do you does defense increase or

do you just get a different set of

attacks this arm is fun listening to

the I guess guess show that

Benny in coming here with the potato

party yes I'm doing the final final

challenge of this

game I need

to to

do do around one round of single play

without losing single

round and it's pretty

tricky come

on

how don't mind the B laser appearing

here yes there we

go

ow

no oh

nice

canol

yes stupid missiles missing I guess they

are missiles not

Hiles

Hiles oh stop

that I should kept it by the way hey I

guess his knees are now safe from taking

arrows wa even if sh needs that's

good I wouldn't say pon pon because well

you like

them those knees are not

protected because I now have full leg

armor

nice only in

you

ah

that why they all to shield in middle of

the jab

combo

well well don't do that on that platform

then

no no oh

no oh I'll take that wait who got you

got the

chocolate I take that that's mine that

means that attack

strong so you wait sorry nice no

AR yes I can continue to be an adventure

no guard Duty for

meu they going to leave your life out we

arm you need to be

safe basic

safety sounds

metallic

this character is very

metal yeah you win

yeah I hope the picture quality is

good and

stre it say zero frames lost so that's

good

I could just do this challenge with like

reapermon guess but that's no

fun and I don't get why you can't do

this with the Vault

Digimon

like now I actually don't get

it you can't play as the

forms which means that you stay as EV

Vault and instead of evolving you do

your Ultra instead because you can

play as the bonus characters including

the

boss

so it's not like they trying to force

you to play as a character has must B

so I need to start making breakfast but

I keep I thought you were making

breakfast bring your phone with

you

ready oh it's it's good nice

level terrible

Worm but terrible I mean

terrible BL BL BL BL

BL

oh

no

digu I do

damage and fell into the water

because stop that no you're you're

destroying

me because I bulli you when you were a

worm okay

computer did that my phone is the

distraction

oh that was great win but you mean

what's on your phone ready Rumble

perhaps is p Pon distracting dig

volution now I didn't change the

design wrong

way oh

same design as last time but it's a long

time I've I've washed it clothes so it's

okay I'm going to have to find a time to

put on all of my arm legs yes and then

share it on the

Ser why you spaming it's not like I'm

spaming oh

wait it works yes I said that it it does

work thing

what bunny time yeah because it's it's

the bunny time it'sing

part now it's the SP way okay now

it's ow ow no no no okay I'm getting

completely destroyed here I'm I'm

getting

distracted us this worm

time time to bully the

worm it's almost easier when I wasn't I

was probably struggling with put putting

this armor together when he

said

okay missile to the

Head winning anding you lost at least I

don't have to fight that black War G on

that level as long as it's not that

level is

fine

but yeah

um you did start put on your armor early

but

yes no worries if if

now if I redeem doesn't work I do refund

it I do have

the list

of when people make makes redeems they

are they show

up so I can make refunds immediately

required

your and now I got two screens I have

one screen with only streaming

information and one stream screen with

the game I'm playing

oops second

stream okay do you want to feel my

missiles no I didn't mean to

jump okay you did

something there we

go I wasn't sure what bus bus this is no

boss Matt we styling it's a

b i after was busy trying to line armor

up to set the P so it stays in place

that's okay yeah You'

been

busy important

stuff watch

out Evol did

volution when you Evol so

the yeah the computer did the wrong

thing there should have evoled and then

jumped up because what this game does is

that you get two jumps it does not

matter how you get into the air you just

have two

jumps

mean mean that if you fall into the air

get knocked into the air or whatever you

can you still have two

jumps

it does not work like Smash Bros when

you have one ground jump and one air

jump and this counter is reset when you

evolve no I want

this evolve if you're not sure that you

so if you're trying to get back on stage

you're using your two jumps you then

evolve which makes you stop in the air

to do the evolving and then you can do

two more

jumps hey that was great you can make a

total of four jumps in

the luckily the

poine knee was already fitted to the

geve lower leg but I had to attach the C

size to the

PO

passing he goes a new challenge

here yes then that means that this

should be the

last

stage and that I have not lost a single

round so

far we going straight to this battle and

not load Poon in the first place

but we like to judge how this game

should

work

yeah no Lee

me

destroy no fighting Patman P Pon Paton

is

gone

no I want

that I want stay

belonging

who stop jumping around so

much

okay now you hit

me

yes I'm still in

lead it does still slight damage I can't

still do this until I

mean but then I will keep the Evolution

for the next

round oh rude hunting G

like you win oh oh blade spare wait

that's not exactly the correct name so

metal wolf ball and his ultimate attack

is roughing

yes thing is metal wolf

claw which doesn't make sense because

it's a

laser but I guess they are calling the

te's claws because a claw attack is

biting but again it's a laser not teeth

and

so and then is

this I don't know what that's supposed

to

be

both

horn can make it horn attack horn

attack iiy I tried to force the joke

there but it didn't work

okay

smir you know what I try to

do oh

dude

oh he stood

up

ow

no for

aall oh no not

toon no for some reason that doesn't

work oh

yes oo look at that you just need to

repeat

that did I win you

win you see

surprised

and then and

run win you

win oh okay good go away from

me

yes come on that's the tea

thing did do

any we eat some blue

Blaster you only need one more oh one

more no oh no

no cheating

again

yep

yep I lost the

round that means I lost the challenge

because the computer is cheating hi how

you doing well I was doing well until I

lost poer

cheat no what they you

doing that's not

nice

hey you

see maybe I should stand even

closer but still I lost round I wonder

if it count because I did lose

after still it's no game over at

least s I'm able to do this

challenge I just need to not get cheated

on wish I look it's four puns P pon pon

pon P pon pon

pon didn't count I don't

know probably

not probably have to this

again 59 minutes wait shouldn't have

mean ads are playing or did the ads

play I completely missed

it no it did not count so I have to do

it again cuz computer was just cheating

I'm you yes

sport pon pon need an athletic

outfit this challenge

well one more

try but that means I'm can almost

complete it now I actually need to

complete it of

your sports were have scar those short

go skirt yes here you go did I win you

which does mean that pon pon can't

do we

go p p has a SC as it shows on icon but

ion get

small

that means that Pon can't do a bit can't

exaggerated things I don't

know maybe that's what people want P to

do

some crazy

stuffff

oh I wanted

it I mean I need it

least does that mean unlock the final

K

celebration

Arena not sure why he just can't go to

the main menu

but look fin unlocked although it looks

better if you go

to this screen

instead look every characters unlocked

now 100% of the game

who what if my favorite Digimon is not

included

yes

well yeah I don't think there's any

anything else for me to do because I

think I unlocked everything

now what are you going to play with huh

which and as far as I can see

go

yeah as far as I can see I've unlocked

every single

character I don't have

a wait can

I I

could do

like

uh

Tri

do like

that watch way after this it I to reach

that okay I got my carbon ready so what

you can

do is that if if one person picks a

character you can also pick the

character normally can't

you can do it goon I'm with you

goon let's pick a calm level like

this out relationship so that mean

wait what's

happening head sleep he can sleep there

one white head sleep look

Rumble look at this character look at

this

recalling yeah probably have to all I

don't have

okay let's just P punch

you okay not getting that much

evolving

oh yeah I don't have the button table I

let

me make sure I have all the buttons set

up so I can do

the there we

go there we go now I

can

now we

can something says about that already

GI I not sure what you mean looks

perfectly normal look perfectly normal

look at this kind a kind of

golden bright

gold now to cook the G

while bowling the water whaton are you

going to play with huh which one um

there we go that's very

PR let's I think Pon is

pink Pon you're the best you can do it

Pon at least I have two different lines

for play one and play two

pamon but what do you mean Panda what's

happening

did

you look pink pink

Pon

okay quick if I see that

jump

there you

go pink pamon one shot

first everyone is first I'm I'm both

characters look

gold

right even

wore

ow

well yeah terrible

attack right now back

nothing

happened look it's it's pink with green

eyes it's like

Jigglypuff Pawn

shorts oh

no don't look at the pawn

Shorts play

huh okay you want to see alternative r

on because can normally went press it

does not allow you but if you press the

secret button you can pick the same

over yes walk all over him because

Randon is a him the Sprite isn't

actually fully mirrored which is most

noticeable on the

Belt which is interesting that they

actually have a left and right

Sprite instead of just a mirrored

one

I think theway redeem is on our cool

down because it hasn't beenail for a

long time no it's just regenerate to

keep redeeming it oh look red an

orange

orange

o oh wait

no there

gotion I've even refresh stream to see

if

just what happens if you do

this well that was

interesting anyway I don't think there's

anything else to

do H yeah on desktop or web specifically

you do have

the uh actually want see got

too he you have the cool down

timer get ready time to

play I can actually step back there's

one more thing you can do which I forgot

that I should

do got

on in P hair yeah that TFT of hair do

had hide under it

small well this isn't a huge color

difference the ears are more

pink ni a green

too but on

the on the icons there isn't a huge

difference yeah becomes a

fish it's East Asian

Dragon a green

one

yeah

green purple

color

pink are you

play well I don't yeah this was like one

and half s i yeah I didn't prepare to do

like cuz I really thought this this was

going to take forever

today and I just want to see and I'm

kind of also testing how streaming is

going and everything that like that and

I basically don't have anything on this

computer ready to play

it well there's one thing though I could

try

um oh have

not shortcut here

apparently

interesting

interesting cuz I

could no I don't have it h downloaded in

the first place okay

right so it's not going to

work it's not even going to work I was

yeah so it's probably right now I don't

have still fun though yeah have Happ you

had

fun that's what we have for having

fun and looking at pon pon in different

outfits right

yeah I

mean technically I could copy it over

from the other computer then I have to

start the other

computer how

about how about we decide instead

instead of

actually playing anything more let's say

that this is this the end of stream but

let's

decide

so oh the there's a steam sale for

another three and a half

hours

anyway so what I was

thinking is that we

could

uh does it show up on stream yes look at

that

is there

uh I was thinking this

actually h d we go

perfect so because Tuesdays would be my

day off the options

are Sunday

Monday this Tex is

huge where's like T size there's no Tex

size oh here we go here

T there we

go H Wednesday

Thursday Friday Saturday right

set okay

Sunday Monday thday

Wednesday test it no yeah it was just

random

letters there we go

perfect

so I do still have some games to

do so I could do

spiral

like I should do uh Digimon I do have

Digimon to do I have Z to I have

crash typing P's

head I have so I got I still got

Spyro dragon fly and a Shadow

Legacy have

trash basically

every P2

game oh Spyro yes I do have two more

Spyro games I still haven't completed I

still need to do

those uh yeah yeah and uh I also have

the um Legend of Spyro as well now it's

cing the chat there we go

so I could do that on Sunday I start

with enter drag play then do shad legsy

and then I go to the Legend of Spyro

because I assume the Game Boy Advance

and the Nintendo DS versions of L SP are

not just going to be ports of the Consol

version they're going to be I would

assume the same story but play quite

different and Friday Saturday I do I

yeah I can do like Digimon Rumble Arena

too I don't have

any yeah there we

go any

comments is this

good I could

and that will be starting this

Sunday and I I have a few things I need

to do today before they close the place

I need to go

to so I guess ending a bit earli is fine

I mean I can

Doone no I want everyone to be

like be able to say what they think

there's no music in back

I do have it like I don't I have it on

the

screen not I don't have any background

music this screen because the generic

background music it's not generic

is randomly picked looks good to me well

no one else is saying things I guess

I'll go with this

then well then

good this is the he the background music

and then I

will well update this this is currently

going on this Sunday so I'll just put

Sunday first and or I put Wednesday

first not for yeah but I want like

regular a

regular a regular schedule so people

know when I start so I don't just

randomly start you

know and maybe cute p p sadly there's no

bum I mean yeah this SC is kind of

covering

it I could place pon pon slightly higher

you have plenty of space for the chat

still I made the text it

is yeah it's 1080p

now it's not really important that you

can read the on screen chat you can

still do

it uh if you want if you look like uh

not live if you're live you have the

twitch chat anyway it doesn't matter

it's so you can look back at previous me

messages as well as knowing that your

message actually got

through kind of that's why I have the

chance

not really important to be able to read

I

guess

but I'm I'm listening to people's

opinions regarding things

so

so we could go and

visit I am Bailey bear how about

that she is currently she's doing a

collab and normally I don't read

cols but very calm they're

notal

fine I think be

fine bye P haven't seen her any yeah

let's let's go and TR and send some

random funun

notes if you not subscriber if you're

not subscriber you can always

pay H it is 100 points and you can pick

any of the subscriber emotes and use one

of

those all up to you whichever you want

to

use slow mode is enabled that means

every 5 Seconds you have have to wait 5

seconds for a message so that is not

much there's quite a few people in

chatting this quite it's calm actually I
