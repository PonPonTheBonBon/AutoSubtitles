hello welcome spray time yes
the free haircuts
hello kitten
it is indeed spare time
it enters
I hear Style
it's the game
with Embassy the Dragon
yeah it's good I can hear this sound
why is it playing
ads again
[Music]
but then it starts playing it twice
he wasn't supposed to play the ads I
went
[Music]
and
I still have since the bed I don't
know
yeah I didn't mean to press that button
anyway now I can see the screen I also
went ahead and did that one thing that I
was said I was said I was going to the
Earth okay
it wet
you give me a headache
need to have destroy a total of 20
deductions to remove the dark BuzzFeed
and gain access
but
it does sound play too early
there are your place as soon as you hit
it but then it doesn't animate for a
while
it looks really weird so somewhere here
is that you can't
run like if you hold it down and then
you jump
this stops in it
uh this game is so weird
[Music]
but I win
and we just do it
[Music]
and as soon as I get
I still have some
Japanese game even though it's weird
it's been one of my ongoing
I guess jokes
but as the same time wishes for them to
remake
and
[Music]
to the dragonfly and a hairstyle
but not only
but in that case they should also fix
the controls
and so
don't mind the double jump I mean of
course she's going to give thumb jump
but why do you have to
what do you
all right that's handy
oh yeah I need to destroy it I see what
grab my hands
excuse me I'm just going to destroy this
yeah that was the problem I had last
time
didn't destroy that thing
it should have changed me being able to
do this part
uh however
[Music]
sorry if I make him in your headache
but yeah
so you basically have
it
yeah yeah like yeah hi hello so what I
would change if would control wise
because I like to discuss
that stuff
and I would
jump would remain same they really need
to switch back playing and charge
really not sure why those were flipped
foreign
[Applause]
[Music]
and then you have to do this
double jump
or you can do the head bash thing
and when you do that double jump you
have to press the blame or charge really
depend on
again just clip straight through it this
is something amazing
lipping stick yeah
I also prepare for that
was I was at it
foreign
States
that's why she physically last one she
just wants to swing all day
that is much
I mean
I was certainly explain some things
they'll get funny
and that last one yep I don't know
what's wrong with it
[Applause]
hopefully
Amber can show up and
we
tell me why
nope that didn't work
because he is yeah and then yes and went
back to controls my I might put my mind
it's something else depressed triangle
yeah that was completely jump
you press triangle dude
I want to too far ahead
take me through the sticks in this game
finally
anyway triangle is the windshield
which I don't think is going to be used
that much
except for that specific level
let's Journey
so that one is some triangle but that
only works if you're standing on the
ground I can't do anything I can't do it
in the water
but
other triangles really should be zoomed
in
as that's what has been in previous
games and in doing that too
now
doesn't even have a track it falls nope
that was sincerely
so I will put the wing sheet on another
button
so when you press yeah when you press
the left
L2 left stringy
and It Centers the camera and reunited
um
that
come on
that's so close
I guess that could be swing Shield
the only final thing is the mirror
let's stay
left and right bumper and one
and one R1
those are rolling buttons
I don't know what I'm supposed to do I'm
really I'm really not sure what I'm
supposed to do
then look up a guide to something
I'm really confused at the moment
just be cute yeah that would fix my
problem
let's go straight through that certainly
should
count
tonight
[Music]
be too early
foreign
Costa remains
uh oh
swing
[Music]
any help in the coastal remains
[Music]
thank you
yeah I mean because it remains where all
the accounts
are I mean this one can I think with a
big Target on the side of the watching
I guess it is a big Target inside of the
walls in here and that's him
[Applause]
what am I supposed to be in here
yeah oh yeah that's why I was confused
foreign
well I know a coach she's so you don't
have to collect another 10 dark
no I don't need what it didn't help it
didn't help me
how do I do the power swing that's that
that's that's
it is it only me you have any issues of
this
micro Precision jumps I guess
I guess it's just me having issues with
this no one else is even this is
apparently not a common issue say it's
like the first thing that pops up on
Google or anything
just someone not knowing where they are
supposed to go
yikes you went straight through that one
is he getting banged or something
I'm so confused
why isn't the Epic
I am confused
and now I'm just
yeah you can just jump up and clip
through because
no issue can I just I guess I have to
maybe wait for it to stop then it seems
like it only goes through what it's
moving
I mean this thing is this thing I'm
jumping here
maybe maybe that is true
in that case I have to jump
now that's what I suddenly it was hard
to tell but I think I landed on it
before I stopped
I can't wait for it to stop
okay it was definitely stopped when I
got to I don't have to jump slightly
before it stops
because it's a smoothie very quickly
foreign
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
that that's the race car and drive and
buy meow
that's so weird it's like it's not there
yeah yeah
it doesn't exists
yeah yeah sleeping soon it doesn't exist
is this a common issue
this is some is this something
there are more close swings here but I'm
certainly not gonna jump into those
until then because I can't this is
clearly placed here outside of meat
it's a kitty sounds
like a race car
yeah
it's amazing with him
nice
enemies inside the walls
I'm way nuts
I'll just kill some enemies
no one more they're here not only
something
because every style I've definitely
restarted the game now so
that's certainly
sure I didn't kill that enemy but
certainly that's not the issue
okay that's
because all these other ones are
perfectly fine
this last one being here
I don't think I can ignore it because I
can't do a double jump jump after
getting onto it
oh I think that can
this is the biggest
biggest struggle he
so far this is 10 things right so far
the biggest challenge
yeah I'll try that because that's that's
the only thing I can think of at the
moment is try to
put the cheesecake time
a trip
we yeah that
why do you want that to me I keep
finally I mean I can't place a market
but
uh
you can do it but I really went now
[Music]
a sweet bun
one of the round buns with
whipped cream between
[Music]
oh
[Music]
yeah
no let's make a clip by clipping through
the stick yeah
that's what that's what he meant
[Applause]
thank you
that's it tonight
what's going on this morning
okay now it's just me singing
there you go
and if I can do that why can't they give
the last one
yummy water
this is silly
foreign
broken
because there's one that called
uh after
this
okay you know what
okay
this is 23 minutes now
okay you know what
let's do this
you have an idea
what is silence the game
and
finally now let's see
oh yeah that way I got that work is
perfectly knowing she first attempt no
issue at all but when I tried it's just
impossible today
yeah this is foreign
it doesn't work
I'm confused
at the highest point
yeah
that doesn't explain why I'm clipping
through the bone
the very very precise for the last one
he gets off
got so far I don't know it is
and then it says no in this last Jam
must be very precise
Counting
nope
nope just clip straight through
[Music]
that was kind of the amount of trains
you're taking across but I skipped that
like the face
no
there wasn't even the pain so I was
going for it
person did not fail a single time to get
to the last card
which I
oh
I failed millions of times now I lost
count
I don't know
I was a confused welcome to the stream
that is broken due to a symbol simple
foreign
this one a lot of times
well well
I can't I guess that worked see I can I
can do that I can jump off and land on
it multiple times but I cannot land on
this one okay and did those amazing
Trace but but not do this one
there we go that's how he can do it
stupid game
I did whoa
and did you see how I did it
uh
yay
did you see did you see how I did it
it's how stupid that was
and I need to hydrate
and I thought
yeah she's sitting I was gonna say
he looks like she's sleeping through the
camera
and I saw it and
okay and it's at Andrew dragonfly was a
buggy game
[Music]
trying to reach that from here do I have
to go to those
no
okay I can't do that cute
good kids
how about the other ones
protective there's no point for me to
open this because that would mean I had
to go back up here
that seems like a sand here
same for those
so
it was the
obviously if the gems are still there
when I came back come back
[Music]
because I'm not going to do the post me
again
I can go back
it's not a handystand stay
which helps me
looks like it's James this this band
s are still there
it means I can't picture
kids
okay let's see if I can do this again
I'll give it one attempt to get those
gems
okay that was my thing
no more attempts to make I'm going to be
made
but anyway I got the two uh dark gems so
now I can face off again spots I
that should be a clip
Maybe
me successfully doing it with stupid
made it made the chip
I need to get back to
[Music]
okay I had to clip I prefer a chip yeah
can you make it cheap I want the machine
foreign
defense
the depots
and the purple class are gone
and into the dark cave
I had a funny creepy I like my bags in
this game
no way
across your water
[Music]
ah what's it too
I didn't see like I was supposed to go
that way
this doesn't look watery now
oh did that platform come from where did
Spider come from
[Music]
ah you must be Spyro
you're larger than I expect
huh normally people I'd fight say I'm
smaller than they expected you know
they're trying to psych me out oh not
many people usually don't say that and
don't sing a single
opponent I said that's a spider
you'll be fine
so that kind of joke doesn't make any
sense
making it very obvious
okay let's fight
I Must Fall Down
okay you can't
knock back causes damage not by getting
a stone in here I mean
foreign
lasers
not sure why she's hiding while the
laces
it doesn't get hit by
then he basically stand oh the way over
here and you're safe
at the stupid boss
[Music]
what a nice pass I mean what a nice bus
detail
a lot nicer than the other games
he actually
provides you with useful stuff better
than creating blocks inside Oh you mean
like that
yeah
I guess you technically correct about
that
bring yourself boys to pay him to get on
lunch
The Unlucky chests that's for some
reason Sparks can't you know
you haven't been defeated why do they
keep saying that they are defeated they
are not defeated they still undefeated
okay can someone
I am confused
is this the second boss I think this is
the second bus I got electricity from
first one and this one is going to give
me
probably considering it's a water temple
or I mean a water tube
oops what is
speed running strategy
that's that's she's speeding up the game
a bit
yeah
she's spitting
wow
who said that you were let's do that
oops
oops
against the Science teaching point
Patrick
what
and of course when you land in the water
you get in a
infinite Loop of taking damage
of course of course that's fair
with this boss is disgusting
nice voice for the boss do you like your
voice
[Music]
and that's how we did
the twice is nice
and see
you don't have that kind of noise
I can also speak
as
bit fire
foreign
[Music]
yeah I think lazy Turks are the most
disgusting part
[Music]
okay that's nasty
again still haven't been defeated once
and you keep saying keep saying this
German schmann
watch butterflies
three of them
are around
maybe we should stop spitting puking
growing up if there's
okay speed running stretch
yeah
okay
whoops
that wasn't speed running
yeah
that guy that causes death
it shouldn't stand on the pledge from a
camera and I forgot about that right
oh and I guess I lost the butterflies
now so no more of that
[Music]
and the bus needs to go to the doctor
yeah
perhaps I didn't mean to do that
foreign
[Music]
then
oh
they had defeated my SP he's my CT
I mean but oh the camera switched that
collection on something
cheating
the amount of items stops his toes is
enough so she's
in front of dancing
and the amounts itself there is a lot
yes there is spawn positions it would be
random
happened I can't believe I was defeated
by a pygmy pip squeak so tiny and now
you have to cheat it yes
it's basically over acting when it says
overreacting my gratitude
I look at your family that is playing I
know cheating
nothing to move some objects soft
puzzles and slow down some enemies you
can also use it to add water to
dehydrated Foods
my left things is fun
not
ah nice
it has become water now
but there's nothing down here
it is water
yes basically I use water and these
things
cannot defeat and miss it
press the right selection buttons like
what's the best
okay I will use the water brush when I
see him
let me get there first
okay
all right I can stand there
okay spider is probably it's like some
water beam
spider wants to let him move once again
bespoke and learn more than four moves
should I will be the latest learn what
he only has three moves at the moment
it just was out to learn
oh hello
well
that's a shame
[Music]
what else
since I defeated pause my favorite
wallet no I need this one I can
I have the money
when you want to buy something you can
choose how many you want to buy but you
can only buy one nation you can only buy
one
[Music]
the other thing what was it in water
place
was it right in here right
I think
I think it was in here
then
wait a minute
they're in here
this thing no
foreign
Ty
and
headbutt nah
what he's saying he does fly that's like
saying there's double jump as a moon
another nice Pokemon
good type courage
to lose their own place isn't right yeah
I think so
what did that continue soon that's the
moment
is first the right place
I'm trying to just be me misremembering
if you've got money yeah this is
definitely the wrong place
definitely wrong place anyways it's on
the map is this area
yeah wait a minute
I see
I see what I'm supposed
seriously seriously
I guess I can't get back got back here
perfect stock is what the green cycle of
this reminds me of it took me a while
but I remember
yeah I really
yeah yeah really
yeah I guess I guess so but that reminds
me of other games
he's like
it's the same name
okay let's see
excuse me
[Music]
this is the place I want to pick out
because there's this thing up there
there we go
range
[Applause]
[Music]
I got it

and get back get to the next round
and the next Ram is probably going to be
more fun than this I don't know this
room is kind of boring
next drill is going to be more fun
next round I see Wilderness I don't know
I like I I like I like it I see too fast
yeah what is this it loading remind me
of

something complex that those brainless
narcs would never figure out but I
better Dragon of your skill and
intellect would do it in no time
okay okay cut to the chase what do I
need to do
and just activate
this area
nothing complex at all
maybe the Norks could have figured that
one out but they would have never been
fast enough to do it
do you want to give it a go Spyro
no my temperature can't give me go
where are all these
this is the first tip
if yeah okay there's one in here
one behind the fence
nothing

Ice Crystal

I'm here okay okay
that's the difference
ah snowman it's a workability I can't
understand that's just like
great guacamole
I've never played working mode
work your moon
it's always easy if they start attacking
one one do a better time
I know they are taking two games at the
same time
I shouldn't have said anything
uh-huh I destroy these finally talking
yeah
well done thank you
do I get an eight from that
thank you spiral
agadag is a reward
oh thank you I said I warned he keeping

I'm getting attacked from above
because I mentioned that they should
attacking groups I know it's going
terribly at the moment

probably found the egg but but but she
said I got it as a reward
but shouldn't be like oh you you're a
dragon he is yeah it's a dragon

finding a baby human and you're like oh
thank you humor for doing this touch me
here is a baby he was
strange things

this size
and luckily they only show up and the
eskimos only show up in those three
spots

out again
that was strange
oh this is fun
I'm huge
please stop doing that
[Music]
go
okay let's pay attention to the TNT

oh
six plants interesting
so if we kill a worker working with some
item that item would explode if the
worker dies
that seems crazy
yeah yeah it's 36 hours straight what's
up wait is that a six hour stream
what this is
what do you mean by 36 hour stream is
that something you'd think
now
wow this was rap
I can't even pick them up
assistant this is a bad reward
challenge with pumpkin
I like I I did an 11 hour stream when
on my birthday from ponton's birthday
I'll certainly do that
again
you don't even have to explain
a little
light
amount of water what is this thing
oh it happens turkey oh I like him
I'll take that
we could uh yeah I actually want to make
longer streams too for special events
that's I'm certainly on board of doing
that
I mean that mean
all right there's something
maybe all of these are gems
[Music]
anyway
and you spent the first two hours on
after
seeing not realizing you might just
turned out it wasn't even connected
and whiskey
the amphibious reaction was I thought
you wanted me to be quiet
I mean I guess
but not really
oops
I mean it's not your fault it was my
fault
it was when I was gonna test the game I
realized wait a minute
I have been connected to my channel
and I was just speaking to everyone and
then I was hearing me it was greeting
everyone welcome I've seen nice things
I was giving compliments and everything
and I felt in my day
it looks like you need to set some
rabbits on fire no you don't I don't I
got full health now
basically
just
trying to get full Hairspray
[Music]
[Music]
eleven thousand

[Applause]
poor blink hated by everyone
[Music]
laughs
[Music]
oh and now I've been waiting nope not
even the professor

he just thinks he's cool and that
everyone enjoys this company but
reality no
definitely not
foreign
kitten doesn't even know who blink is
it's not sad it's blink
it can't be sad it's impossible for it
to be sad

all right
bunnies

[Music]
in the way from there
foreign
checkpoint
a little maturity a lot of stuff

blink 11 but Hub world
I'll be honest he will explain is it the
character of this game yeah they can't
character thing I have to pay attention
I love that
it didn't even know this is Blink
he is even put a B on his cap just so
everyone should know he's blink but he's
so forgotten forgettable and
love that not even a be on his cap could
help him from getting
forgotten
that is so sad
excuse me
who did that
a huge pain
he's sorry for shooting you if you're
going to blame but you were probably
blame
you can imagine like three times before
you actually died

I still have to
do you have a few steps again

nice for you just to come by and I did
show up on your stream today by the way

surviving outfit
oh
[Music]
foreign
[Music]

so three more Dark Crystal things
oh there's one
two more
really about this one
and of course the last one you said
no James okay
[Music]
12 minutes
on a single level
and that doesn't even count the probably
20 minutes to spend on it before
[Music]
but you know I'm always willing to go
back at any time and explore just for
fun
and you can get back if you want to do
it for fun I'm enjoy
when I get back yes for fun
you don't know what you're talking about
wow
I wasn't prepared for that
[Music]
yay celebrations I did it again
wait a minute
Crunchies again
whoops ID thank you
I was supposed to go to the other hand
yeah
nice clippings to the ground
okay I was supposed to go up here
because I think I didn't go in there
next exactly
[Music]
okay time to change this I
don't know not this
near
that timing must have happened
hey no checkpoint
no checkpoints
foreign
[Music]
thank you
okay
kinda knowing there's such a point here
but I feel like this is something you're
going to say that a lot
there we go
ICT
fancy
because I need that
spot over here
okay
well that's annoying
but
oh what is this place
I've seen oh here we go
Fred tell me to stop you
[ __ ] I've beaten bigger baddies than you
all I have to do is run around you if
you a few times while I think
times
[Applause]
it's me Sparks
Parks I think he knows that
right there's some fire
right I see yeah Harry oh no they got
Spyro we have to rescue him before it's
too late but what if it's already too
late
relax buddy Spyro's still alive I know
because if he weren't we'd be going back
to a previous save I rock
hey rocks
yeah
exactly spider was dead it could just
reload last checkpoint
obviously
it's up
what
I hunted by how you trapped yourself
[Music]
it's not my old pal Hunter
went in this park
oh hey Bentley yeah I'm just passing
through I'm on a mission to rescue Spyro
he's kind of got himself captured how
you doing
some yetis from the neighborhood chased
me out of my house but I don't want to
bore you honey you're busy looking for
Spyro oh cool okay then
um are you sure you're okay Bentley I
could go in there with my bows and
arrows and get rid of them for you oh
would you old pal both and ass my cave
is through there and you'll have to
climb the wall to reach it
but you've got to be careful there's
quite a few bad guys and they're very
tough
if you get rid of all the yetis I'll
give you a reward
s
Champion also if you guys
if he has to climb
how does
how does Bentley get in there
this magic climb every time he goes home
or have the invading yetis
made it so you have to climb
by removing the bridge or something
well
shot through the eye
foreign
I hope he doesn't care
wow wow excuse me
oh nice
hey
he was rushing me
oh our chest let's see what's Bentley's
hiding in here
a few chance
otherwise
[Music]
another good idea to place those in the
middle of the past I mean
yeah
[Music]
my bedroom
let's see what you have in the bedroom
an Amber egg Bentley why do you have
Amber egg in your room

best photo reference penalty probably is
walks home but yeah let's use break

life savings whatever I was built his

most of the skills you will need however
there is one more skill you must have if
you are to face red well some place to
go have you
have the ability to wall kick from one
wall to the other however they must be
close enough to achieve any real height
in order to all kick you must jump onto
the wall and jump again after contact
Spyro you must remember that only
certain wall types will allow you to
perform the wall kick you must learn
their telltale signs none of your add
icting things yeah this
[Music]
surface
[Music]
[Music]
dude puzzles with it
I don't like green places where I had to
use it was or maybe it's a bad very
restrictive okay
foreign
[Music]
large Gadget is now available
you can see a spider
spider colored embe
[Music]
anyway
foreign
let's do this
[Applause]
a very specific game
oh wait
it was running straight across the
character
okay I should be more careful
if I get a new one yeah
everybody became the purple dragon
yep
the mp2 is
then she can leave perfect Dragon stuff
[Music]
sometimes Superstar things are good
all right how does how does the
shipshine not instantly defeated
thank you
[Music]
it's Spyro if you've got money to spend
time
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
foreign
excuse me sir I'm trying to get to that
door
but at least that in the way when I have
the ships super shot
[Music]
all right
okay so you can't if you subscribe
you know
when I'm only done it we're starting by
11 but
still
I guess that's probably end this stream
as well
me struggling with another sergeant bear
level
thank you
oh well let's do this
no shall I attack the enemy or is this
just a drill
what's that means oh wait I guess there
are enemies in the 11th sometimes
yet these numbers
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
I wasn't prepared for it right now
welcome
welcome and Raiders
hello Miss Kitty toy
nice to see you all
right
um
currently playing through Spyro a
hairstyle on the PlayStation 2.
and then it
[Music]
if you don't like the flying levels in
the original trilogy you're not going to
like this 9 levels
but I am going to Hope yeah I'm not
doing circulated at the moment
and we decided I should oh it's only
four sips
I have decided that she completed the
scheme 100.
and I think that was a terrible mistake
that's the
other son
[Music]
you see if summer season catch uh
talking with me science
rings
let's take that
[Music]
is search for the
business he up here
okay good to know
those islands
yeah I'm not doing okay that you hate
like is this island part of the course
I don't know
oh God yeah
[Music]
these
are
these are some at some levels relatively
yeah I've already done the what I've
understood the hardest
level already
so
I have for that
at least you can dying like if it hits
by these things you can say momentarily
stunning
a little bit annoying
um yeah
can you get it
that wasn't me
I'll take care of the Ring soon
where did you come from
[Music]
me I got on those
and I got all those
so there's just one more Thief somewhere
and run your arch somewhere
yeah
yeah
most people say they are
let's say the flying levels like
is this no this isn't part of 11 okay
good to know
there's nothing behind there I said
check last time
all right up here okay
but that was just one Arch
it should be two more
no
where can two more arches please
all right yeah yeah I just
struggling that
that's that's what I do
so
um oh yeah I didn't do the
all right that this is going to happen
Alicia
I didn't do this part this part
that's me
[Music]
yeah you did a monster prom
o imagine that
instead of Monster Hunter it's monster
prom I don't know what monster promise
this is the second time I missed this
one
I'm doing this
[Music]
you can tell how
your stream went
and maybe something about the game too
if it is a game
it's a dating Sim oh
that's the one
with monsters I got this
that makes sense
and
it's wearing a safe work oh easy
oh
is it only like yeah
your text or is it visual too I managed
to get a secret ending for the cat that
was going for oh that sounds nice
but this might be one of the ones that I
missed yeah these two must have been the
ones I have not gotten last time I think
I found them
now I just need to
excuse me
you're not allowed to survive with
science
now and then there's this last Arch
and then I just need to find one more
Thief
and there's Thief
and the remaining Birds
which might be this way
so tell me there's one more here
oh there it is
it just spawns in
shortestness in this yay I did it
[Music]
oh yay
the artist is before but the content is
the language and themes
[Music]
I think I can survive that
if I were to show up
at some point
on you a dragon egg
oh thank you Sergeant bird finally I did
it go and see if I can win you a late
term
yeah you have to do it one more time
and this time everything is spread out
so you have less time without this time
you understand sometimes here you
actually give you more time now
everything is in different vacations
so
yeah
one more
it is
[Music]
the boosts under the pitch I should see
if I can remember that
just anything so in order
she probably picked up the business part
and I'll get you
to the text is still the comments after
oh there was that wasn't the one I was
going for
sure
so this is the large Arch
but then it needs to be to
I think I up here yes
yes both of them thank you
so one more Thief is it up here again
yes
a two more ships actually
oh no that's it
oh yes
oh that was for some reason a very easy
all right okay I'm happy with that
let's just say the secret ending I got
involved with me having an experience
with multiple version
oh oh
[Music]
I'm experience
that's uh that's how I interface it
at the same time
but yeah the art is itself hurt anything
the first time I'm surprised and outside
and then the game has no that's it
that's do you want to play that again
for fun oh no definitely not
just for fun
do you want to touch it oh oh you're
trying to attack me
do you do you want to torture yourself
again for fun
what dragon character is this this is
empty
empty dragon
that's why I titled the game everybody
right yeah just the stream it's of
course it's still conspire
it's one of character actually meet once
in the game
well I guess you could say you meet her
once two times but two times once I
don't know however we face that
[Applause]
the distance makes me so long
anyway let's continue
in one part of the game you meet her
twice that's there we go
this escapes are really easy
now struggle with them
yeah
I'll take those
it's Amber in game cheat yes when you
get
how much do I have
what do you get all the Ember eight
so I see my shoes
since I'm working on a mod
is it
lightning strikes outside but no rain
and now it's flashing outside
you know where the weird stuff is going
out on hey I was distracted from the
game so yeah
when you get all those you unlock
everybody is at
like the game causes the next day at
least open the door from outside
and then yeah I had a Sunday it's it's
lightning strikes
let's go
wait
where am I
where is this place
and yeah and the game has a map too
this is done
this isn't where I'm supposed to go to
progressively okay
I guess I'll take this
oh I'm back
[Music]
oh
okay I
so this is
foreign
area
[Music]
time to go back
I wasn't done here
I have
I have another nice Fox to me
the cheat was discovered 17 years after
the game's release originally it was
gonna be given away in some McDonald's
crossover event that never happened
like
yeah you're supposed to be able to open
it from both means why let's keep the
door open
yeah so this isn't the oh it's ran out
this is where I'm supposed to go
[Music]
nothing there
we have to meet a nice [ __ ]
[Music]
f f
approxy lady
more furries inspire me
[Music]
I take that
I'm nicely placed
great
[Music]
okay
here we go there she is
[Music]
I am the ice princess
because it's freezing in here please
light the boilers that are scattered
around the Citadel
I've been working on that besides pizza
because it's freezing
but when it's when I make it hot again
what what is she then and what's her
name she's just ice princess
and cutscenes will have spiral instead
of Amber
that's it
it's an in-game cheats that
unlike in between United States will
have Spike with
where it will have
well in my case ponton in every
unless it's prevented
which is like most cutscenes sadly
okay
he's a cute Fox
I miss this one
oh is this is this the level with the
fox Queen well she's not a queen she's
just a princess because because
it's a pretty title
like me I'm the princess
the princess here
okay let's destroying some things
oh do I need to destroy
I mean I can't walk over there and pick
up the James normally
you have to go over and pick up your
games
but like
maybe you get the gems immediately
because
and if they were to leave the gems on
the ground leave to be it would be too
much geometry for it
but it came to handle or something
I thought I have no doubts of the place
into being able to handle that's it
[Music]
you should be able to destroy them
right
check guys
Japanese
Island
what am I
where's these things
oh no
and not these things
but I got a checkpoint
really move
and
right all right yeah exactly
[Music]
it's like you're waiting for me like
this is a good height no it wasn't
this is a good title well it wasn't
on the whole swing sticks
false wings
yeah
I'm not a fan of these
I wonder why
well I got the age
as I'm almost
oh
let's take this one where does this girl
yay I actually did it
it was another part of the game I was
stuck at but
really long time
by the time way behind due to those pole
swings
not working properly
Kevin you show up
he's he's the here's oh he's they are
here still expert and
he's the one oh hello
I am back
and he was
I think he was the one who discovered
the secret sheet that
never was officially released
but that is cleared out
have fun lacking
and this is
very in this game
but that's much later
that will not be this stream
so from here I should be able to enter
that one
or I like him
from here I should be able to get a peep
I have plenty nuts I will goodbye again
[Music]
I don't want to be here
foreign
[Music]
again
to me
I don't care about you
yeah it's down here
I'm so rich certain one's August 32
something
yeah it's the last spoiler I hope
and then they [ __ ]
ice cream princess now I call it Queen
yeah come here
wait these birds are just for health
they do look a slightly different from
what
so many light gems
I'll take it out for me
okay he's
let's go back and meet
the
well I guess she's a fox princess now
but I appreciate his name will still be
listed as Ice Princess
one size princess always Ice Princess
so it works right
always oh
she has so many bunnies
[Music]
one is everywhere is at least your
bunnies
that's much better I guess I won't need
this portable heater anymore
[Music]
is that what it is
At Last I can take a warm bath now if
you don't mind I'm sure you'll have more
important things to do
once you take your bath and I go and do
all this stuff I guess
all right
well since it's
119 here
as as can be seen by the beautiful clock
in the corner
that's it was suicide
wait is this this area
[Music]
don't don't move down together
I wanted to go back to the
[Music]
stack there we go
graduate yes and
I want to get back to
I guess this is an easy way of doing it
hydrate
I'm taking care of these easier
okay
oh wait I'm running around in circles
my favorite
[Music]
favorite
so when it's game is using spiral as far
as I've understood for what Amber has
said is when it's using the uh
cutscene model and I assume all other
cases where the model is built into
something so in this case I assume it's
used in the cutscene model during the
interpretation
it's a shame they didn't replace it with
well Amber model but maybe
it's not rigged the same way so it would
break during cutscenes
I don't know but it's been three hours
and I'm very happy happy for everyone
who has been here it makes me happy
that so many people are joining my
streams
and our energy and they are entertained
by me
and I will continue
my
journey of completing every spider thing
the case I'm going to complete every
spot I came to 100
if possible
if that's the correct thing you even
possible practice
Legend of Spyro yeah I'm probably not
going to complete that 100 because it's
not really the level to level kind of
game that spark games usually are
unlike yeah
and crash games
[Music]
no I'm probably just going to complete
me
[Music]
the original trilogy aspiring crash
which I have complete 100
because
otherwise it's just going to be too much
[Music]
but anyway
foreign
[Music]
who has been visiting my streams a few
times
he is currently playing Crash
[Music]
is driving insane his title is
perfecting
he is a Scottish
if I'm not mistaken
I think that's part of his test
I'm much very little of his dreams I do
want to watch more
but knowing it's been going on for about
a week that's something I should check
because
[Music]
doesn't say
[Music]
it's been going on for one hour so maybe
he's actually
ending his stream now
oops I will
timing
okay
[Music]
uh oh oh well
let's visit a pumpkin unicorn instead
she's funny
yes dream was great today thank you
I didn't
I'll do the old way
companion cards she's playing Garden
witch life which I'm not
kill it at all
why does it
why does it do that
oh it's a bit close okay let's see
twitch is being weird as usual
it's so
thank you I think you're all for being
here makes me happy
tomorrow will be art stream and I will
continue the community drawing which I
have been calling it titano artists I
would call it and finish up the line I
think thank you thank you for reading
then
I'm still not disturbating I'll probably
get the hang of it so so yeah our
comfortinity finish the line art and
coloring the drawing of water Bunny and
ponpon and then I will add the kitten I
think
next I'm not also draw the kind of
Channel anime figures
of some kind
let me see how that goes hopefully well
see how far I get tomorrow
thank you everyone
be very happy
for a new sport
and
time to read
