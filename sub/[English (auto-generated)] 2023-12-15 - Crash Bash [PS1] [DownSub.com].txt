time to start

then I

realized I forgot to start the software

that

house the outfit changes so don't for

change just yet let's go so this is

where I'm trying to befe why is the uh

subscription message

broken on screen hello thank you for

subscribing uh for

your the starting the fifth

month

oop hi fun how is

K I am what are the controls

again oh there there it

is wait what was the challenge

again

oh yeah yeah yeah this thing was always

shooting at me that was the

thing

no come

on

oh this is always shooting

like oh I was first at

it

like when it starts shooting it's always

shooting in the same location

W so I do think the AA

is

harder in this

I need to remember the speed up

option oh come

on nothing oh there we

go

uh too many

balls oh no I was above the side yeah

I'm losing this is first though so it's

fine oh there we go you

fail not

terrible one of

those situations where you could rather

easily make impossible

yeah come

on oh and I dropped it

and there's no

like

comp it should probably for the sake

of doing it quick have like safe

state that can use the yes

reset 3 2 one

go now of course it was

anite

oh

shoot

no I'm Mo to the

side oh come

on ah you're

not

no they are going they going after me

that's the

problem

finally I got

it

w it's not going that terrible

now oh come

on I need

that

oh

no

nice they're not going perfect

but droing too many

balls I didn't see that one what

happened oh Har mean is

back

yeah 3 2 1

go not the winner

yet starting off by losing

one see they're just attacking me

everyone is attacking

me W it's a bit too

quick

and their reaction time are very quick

yeah they're only only intentionally

steering them towards

me maybe not one

piee often it feels like they cing

towards

me

nice

yeah I'm do things so quickly at the

moment

bounces off it and yeah that that was

worth so

far oh the panda the moon panda is on

left now switch games and L

okay appreciate the

lury just drop it

already oh Str behav

here there we

go come

on

no ST it towards

me no it bounced off it the previous one

didn't was because I

KN oh

nice

no no

stop drop

it now I'm dropping

everything

oh come

on every single Ball come on drop

it

no I was in such a lead at the start and

just failed everything P brain doesn't

have power to process all the

trajectories

exactly why is it not

working I drop that one I why is it

working I haven't pressed log in yet why

do I have to press

login and now that food is seen the oven

got the wa about an hour and a half and

currently breing some tea at Le you got

some time to wait for it to start up

okay

the might work

now 3 2 one p is calling all the balls

see I don't know what happened at the

end I just completely messed everything

up

go I'm pressing the wrong

button that doesn't

help

oh

okay okay the the co is gone

almost oh

yes cortex don't defend yourself against

those no I was so close I reacted a bit

too slow there I was next to

it

a

oh how did that manage

to

no no oh I defend against

it no the callner was almost

gone it work good good good hello

P girl I don't know should call you P

girl just for the come on that's just

cheating I'm doing the the the hardest

crash game of more crash

bash but the confu is cheating all the

time look at

this

like I let so many balls

in the reaction time of the computer

sorry oh the computer didn't go for that

one so I managed to

get

no and then when I get it this really

short

no why did I move to the side

there slightly too far

Sam couldn't block

it

oh

oh oh

shoot well I lost a

net

oh how am I supposed to react to

this to many balls

everywhere my phone better would

probably cut that before dinner's ready

oh

well you can always put it on charge I

guess you really need that longer cable

or something maybe that's something you

should invest

in like more places

to

oh aha The Shield is mine feel is more

important that they closer to the

end

is really short when I have it but

that's probably a

placebo

oh no no I missed the ball and The

Shield

there we

go now the score looks

better no oh I managed to oh I dropped

one

anyway oh come

on and I keep forgetting that after

the that scene is done I you go after

Shield but we did get that Bui so that's

good no stupid Shield is ruin for

me say I forgot to CH

again two of them at the same time I oh

come on the ball bounced up the

ball

no

what

no no there we go f probably

closest all right

um I don't have a charge in the kitchen

and no cable long have fure table beside

well then maybe maybe that's something

to invest in

um I wonder why pin is not in this case

pin

pinstripe getting smash into in Crash

how he cute P doing I mean there's a lot

of stuff going

on I'll be doing that after I move

currently I'm going through a lot

because they had to go and put that

awful through that no one likes in the

game that sucks yeah the character sucks

no one

likes stupid game I forget if reru in

this

game I think isn't pin strip a boss or

something maybe or maybe only boss is a

made

up up is a boss in

the crash team racing at

least where there's no teams

so I'm not sure what the the type is

supposed to

mean

no

oh come

on it's been a while since I played this

game so I don't remember

the

pop

uh let's see nothing

okay oh too many BS

everywhere I to I tried to defend myself

but that just resulted me I TR to%

against both

balls and no I was

first

oh no I want to be first again I'm not

too far from it

but it probably go yeah it should be on

the there we

go the crash Wiki should probably say

which character are in this

game oh no I wanted to

Shield

probably have to get the

shield Dro two

of if I had like twice this

man or like 10 more

maybe

course aha I got

shield no stupid Shield B bounc it into

my

go

okay don't give me the

balls I dropped

one okay qu is not too far away from

being

out oh I need a shield yeah call is

gone oh no my shield disappeared didn't

pick it up quickly

enough portex is gone I'm

gone you

fail had to two

left and I would have won that but no

yeah that that was so

close making too many mistakes

too yeah Mak

sense pun try to catch both bones but

got

nothing

I have too many balls of my own I mean

anyway in about five minutes my team

will be ready the r goddess

pleas and there is no RNG

goddess oh and exciting news my SW is

finally

sent not so exciting it in two weeks but

to way month since I ordered it well at

least you get me soon P was so close

o

flash

man come on stop attacking me they only

going after

me hey that b just disappeared

that b

disappeared Oh wrong

position we go continue doing that no

that's attacking me that's not

allowed don't attack the cute

bunny my shield I was B protecting my

go no I'm dropping

everything come

on how

dud even the balls against

me they're

everywhere

yeah you

fail oh well one more try 2 1 so

close oh excuse

me

well didn't go as planned

oh didn't drop a single ball

there

amazing oh my

shield yes there we go even though I did

terrible I'm getting

closer

no come

on no I dropped the ball

anyway no I'm with the wrong

way no my

shield

attacked from everywhere who I have no

idea if there correct way to say

that that would be

great how's that oh I was not too close

enough

I'm not even sure what you're asking

about

no my

SC

no oh drop both again oh Shield mine no

I dropped it

anyway

machines

perfect let's keep it like this

no it won kind of

win you fail see

I take many many

attempts oh is it correct yes it's

correct what

does okay now it's acting we

again maybe it's just the cable being

broken it looks

fine sometimes just inputting

random

inputting random

stuff

oh how is this level possible if there

how

okay sound sounds more like you were

saying some kind of 3 expression 1 go

how could this happen how is it possible

B starting up by dropping

one great

start

and other the three are already

let

many

anyway I would say it as add it and

SM I would use just the

expression that would be easy to te imp

possible

oh and that Shield was

delayed

oh come on that's just cheating that's

not how the balls Just

Bounce it's gold B fine there and

then you

fail 3 2

oh

he's basically see Against

One but have been so close so it is I

should be able to defeat this level

eventually you just need some random

luck I gu

no yep drop three out of three see and

sometimes the computer doesn't even go

for sh I don't know

why

no come

on many blls oh on that was a

cheating the physics engine is against

me too

he hit the ball it just bounces

backwards that's not supposed to

happen well one more

ball that oh this time the S was on my

side oh Rel is gone no my cloth is gone

the closer G

too

look they got new underwear I mean don't

look oh I dropped

it Lost first my five hour later

yeah can you take only one more ball why

no I I won't take any

balls

oh

oh flowers no don't look like

it on I want that

Shield

oh

sh falling on the other

side that was that stupid bounce

again three of the three last Feel have

spawn on the other side not that I get

the shield oh now it's Spa on these

sides stupid monkey got it

again

okay let me

no stop

that W

poon he is mine to drop two

balls NOP that was the last

B ah so close not too close I don't

speak English should have told me not to

look in

Polish I don't know how to say that

so

oh a drop two

this

think the most annoying part is there is

no quick

restart excellent cut the

shield try to get defend myself against

three three balls let all three in

oh come

on like sometimes when I hit it from the

side it moves forward as I expect them

to I mean like sure it's not physic it

doesn't follow the laws of physics when

it does that but that's kind of part of

the video game but sometimes it moves

down which I guess makes more sense

considering the angle of it

but considering it one breaks the

physics so the game

is not as unfair with defending because

only hitting with the very front of the

thing would be very annoying I you fail

yeah I mean that went terribly anyway 3

2

1 do not look it's prly invitation to

look

no to say I hate Ru in

Polish yeah

B

okay that challenge is a pain have you

tried yourself do you have experience

with

this or does this look like pain this is

definitely

pain

all

TR

no the boun it's all over the place

until it I mean that's just because all

of them are good at defending and that

is all up to me to defend

myself

no come on move the side there we go hey

why did the last one move slightly

different

no

all got

k no my

CH stop

it stop

it

yeah problem with Vortex disappearing

is it's basically that kind of makes it

so he's always

defending every single B and that's

going to be a

trouble it's easier when the KOA

disappeared

first almost look like face three that

one

uh have that quick reaction

time

oh

no sometimes it send out one chest as it

disappears and that one goes straight

up

no I didn't pick it up in

time Che at

this i s up to who says them to

KOA who then sends them into my goal and

just one after the

next one

go well swi

it

and then after that I'm down to the

scene come

on

no

machine and I dropped the ball

anyway I went all over the

place

nice okay that was went that was

good that

went no no

no

now uh let's all for

balling

marbles fail aluminium marbles or

something I don't know 3 2 1

go no I didn't want to do that there we

go

you for the

shield I do like that qu has a lot of

points still although it will be me

against all the shields

people have played with my balls in

bikinis okay if you say

so not really uh you fail I

think I think you you admitted something

I have some experience with it too

cff come on bounce that one game is it

cheating

that s flower is not so secret

anymore yeah keep pill fight me I'm

trying oan I'm

trying

I don't think anyone else has done a

prediction so I don't think the

prediction is valid

any hello everyone yeah I've been trying

during the ad break and nothing still

not been able to

win nothing of value Miss

why could Naughty Dog puts engine on 's

team but no they had to put a stupid

monkey that is not a crash band food

land I mean for

real wait what was put on the good side

for this game even making it even

worse you

fail is it is it wait who are the four

Good Guys The four bad gu wait who are

the four bad

guys

exactly the cooc and crash Ru and one

more

character that are on the good

side when when aqu says like well you

had to too

many on your side you must convert to

over to convert probably not correct to

fight for the good side like

but but if they're

still on the bad side why would they

help

you maybe that that's the problem really

is supposed to be on the good side but

he's the he's the worst because

obviously doesn't want to

help I don't remember what the all the

forgettable effect was

oh come

on wait is a good guy no he's a bad guy

but he's he's on good

side that's the that's the weird

story there there two good guys coko and

frash and then there's four and six bad

guys which has to fight on good side

which they obviously wouldn't

do there we

go thank you how not the truck thinking

you meanu the gorilla thing is

name it's a nice start

okay let me to E

I will take a quick look at the

uh oh no wait

yeah tiny tiger was the other character

that went over to that to fight for the

good

side now real Ru is on the bad side the

evil

side it's it's a tin tiger and dingodile

I guess dingodile did go with a good

side

eventually like off the

C the could characters like

TOA you

fail i

i two I was I was wrong there three

three bad guys

H oh I don't know what game he's from

he's he's from Crash

B this game doesn't have games

yeah why am I dropping

everything he's from he's from the

game

ah terrible

terrible everything is

terrible 5% battery remaining on my

phone and 20 minutes on tire for

breakfast well I guess you have to put

your phone on charge and get a longer

charging

cable

go we

go I didn't know that Shield would

appear on this

side

no no my

shield my dresses my

shield have constant

Shields

oh come

on

this bounces are so

stupid I have half the points of just

one of

them yeah I'll take that

back P to H everyone just want the BS at

yeah you know it not charging I need

those well bring the charg with

you like a normal person so a bad result

I'll be out as well sometimes

later a charging can't cost that

much

oh she is

fine well it's stupid I played that

scene once but she's

CRA kep playing my mom's favorite

character C is like the only them

character in the game

so

another reason to put T in the game to

put second female character in the

game so the m is

dead that was

hard aluminum

bones my mom played as C and I play CeX

because you're EV

no cuz you're an evil

scientist now come

on look at that they're working together

it's almost almost like they're all on

the same team 2 one go

there we go really got one

B one oh I

missed KOA

not got another got a Bard now everyone

got two balls but C only got

one come on

there we

go Forex sure likes to

laugh he's practicing his evil

laugh

no I got

shield no come on I touch that oh come

on I'm doing terrible

now

SE

no why sending the deals on the other

side I need the

shields

no oh of course it bounced like that why

wouldn't

it I pretty much one match

yeah they're not bully on each other's

team they do still attack each other

sometimes but they do try to attack me

often

oops okay

no I defend myself against

that

no can wait for

me

no no see that was an

attack I mean C is good

I

guess I mean it doesn't we this uh

thing he has quite experience doing

it all right so they oh wasn't been out

range

day

no 5% B

remaining yeah this

isos

especially when it bounce into my

go see I got past two of the bosses

easily except me and my mom never got to

the

and the seros collecting the power

crystals and the gems for not easy to

get yeah I know that's what I'm trying

to do at the

moment p is so experienced receiving BS

yeah I guess that's a way to say that

I'm bad at this game

mode ah I see you got past two of the

bosses yeah yeah I

have I think that's two bosses that

managed

it so now try

to do this

which is

Lefty probably one of the hardest

challenges in the

game oh okay now I'm left to many B

scene

again

no

okay turn balls and all the balls onent

me

at least you only have to win this once

when you get the trophy you have to win

have three

wins sure we was easy

yep but I want 100% game but I guess

that's not going to

happen

why I should yeah I'm lost this

anyway fin I should go put my phone on

charger I'll see if you're

still breakfast I take my show be back

up up we'll see we'll

see your not hoty fled yeah wait I'm not

hottable that's that's when you're

horrible with with

hotness no no moving too

quick just want

to in front of

it was so

close come

on come on what's with the bouncing this

game a

cheap

oh going move a bit close to

there yeah I'm lost this one as well I'm

charging my phone too yeah I'm charging

my phone

too I'm not using my phone

anyway oh this is an impossible

challenge okay there so we go

no come

on

oh

oh

no

for me that this too quick reaction

time

anyway

so let's try this again

again

go I will I will do

this

having been close

twice I keep making

mistakes

hey why did that ball appear

after engine

appeared what what was that the game is

Just cheating I mean so making it hard

enough it's not make it easy when game

is is

cheating B is bouncing

corly

man they going un

scene

no

Machin I really is

measure if the time is really shorter

when I have the shield compared to the

computer I need that

sh that came

over I wasn't doing that well but I mean

you're cheating by being so distracted

distracting that

dorable I can distract opponent by doing

a magic

trick which currently involves

flowers

oh come

on oh come

on oh almosta in

time

okay

nice

oh the computer has slightly better

reaction time than

me just in after I can't get

him

If Only They had cheat Cates I don't

want to use cheat go when I play the

game just just make that

clear I mean I am I have methods to play

to cheating game I can I could play the

game slower so I have better reaction

time which could be an interesting like

video to make when I play the game like

hop speed or

something

oh and then I speed it up to full speed

and it looks like my reaction are

s my reaction being is

good reaction time is short maybe T

thing

I have a cheat code book it's called

cheat code

explosion No it should be cheat code

book have a cheat code book it's called

cheat

cook well I lost this

one I will man a cookie

fun fact I'm actually thinking of making

my game give people with slow Reaction

Time Slow Time ability early in

game

well would be nice but some custom

customizing the difficulty like

that it's not cortex I want to take

out oh

oh I'm letting all the balls

in ah Shield

no my

shield

oh

I'm letting all the ball

now as I usually

do somehow I did not die

first but other has like head 13 points

left 13 Health

points no chance

I'm

to come

on I just

disappears

ah

I left the team

anyway

everything

everything

yeah can't de with all these balls no I

can't you

word I've lost two to a stupid

bounce 2 one

bounce like like it's like it's magnetic

and follows the scene it goes

down down on the machine oh I was so

close to touching

it whatever

shoot quickly this is taking too

long where's the uh Adaptive

Difficulty well I've only been going at

this for 1 and a half

hours should I check

the

prediction uh we got yeah I can throw

away the

prediction you get the

refunds refunds for

everyone one and a half hours of playing

with BS yeah add the 3our stream I did

on this one to that

D ah swimsuit the swimsuit is cute I

recommend try playing r search for

rip I think you mentioned that before

yeah I was supposed to add that

to it's the my list of

uh games un know I did that

already I'll get back to playing play

two games after I move

what oh

oh where's my last

Buton don't have

one

was

huh

uhuh

no another

one oh

already I

failed start every every Force ball

coming out yeah every Force ball not

everyone it was my favorite game when I

was

little when I

little

well wor I can't try it

out you should PS one by the way P

two

I'm not sure where I got PS2 from but

yes I going say that that ball bounced

weirdly but it was a new ball

this one game on PS1 I want to play and

I considered playing it but the suit

goal is on PS2 and I want to play

like the sequel

after

so

I'll probably do that when I can

play these two

again

oops try to defend myself against that

whoa whoa whoa whoo take it easy too

fail well eight points left for

opponents 3 2 one when you try it out I

can help you out I know the G from the

back of my head well I will let you know

if I need

help I like to try to Fig stuff out on

my own no I mean looking at some of my

stream sometimes not because sometimes

games do not make sense and I'm just

confused and annoyed by

it i' better enough to

be but sometimes games are

terrible sometimes they are

terrible like this game this is a

terrible

game 3 2 one

go oh

sh feel

to St I guess I didn't drop us B at Star

I

guess still work in that the Dr

one I forgot about still for every every

time every time I forgot about have the

Shi up

here of engine has

disappeared there we go there it

is

no PR Dage appeared much later

this time I was busy defending

myself we just make come on come

on just make it a bit harder to get the

shield after get

oh no wrong

one oh come

on

no my shield I need

it it's very hard when when the ball

bounces down and not up I want it to

bounce

up it's been long since I played but

still remember levels I do remember

there was that

training was a training in the game

one as long as the game is clear what

the controls

are like this game does this game makes

clear how R are

work and I mostly understand how the

balls move around sometimes I'm very

confused about how they

move

they feel like

I have another

Choice B has too much fliff in her kit

head yeah a lot the flip no

brain

taking taking every till I

with

this no come

stuff I don't know how

to

something B is used toing B

she's not used to denying

them to many

BS I'm getting I'm getting too many

balls on me I can't I can't handle

it

fun but as going to play in like one

minute go not that I'm going to win

doing that

but lot first on so if let's just end

just play I will at least that gives me

money you know it supports me if you if

you want

to stay for

that then it will be 57 minutes of non

Ed 3 minutes at hour that's not much I

would say 1

go oh get over

here no stupid

bounce no my

Shields

uh it's been 2 hours maybe maybe I

should start using safe States I'll do

it

after I I'm not going to defeat this

otherwise best I can

do I would still have to like actually

succeed in the challenge he just

that it's a combination of my best

efforts instead of just a single

attempt

if that makes

sense koala is gone that doesn't Happ

much

I still have

1 no my

shield no Dro it

fail I I still try one more 2 one go

Tech not been 2 hours yes

yet he need is kill P

yes sure that was kute

early no I'm dropping every single ball

what is

this okay I have a SE

now

no no I dropped it you fail

H okay it's been two hours

now let's do

this I'm try to go through

multiple because it go goes through

multiple

faces if I do is there like

a CU this game really it's really

instead is it like

uh

um there oh wish was a quicky way of

doing

this okay if

I yeah and then I figure out where I

shooting

there then I can see if I can improve

that

you gave it I try probably total of six

hours or

something I say that was pretty

terrible why is there know like a

quick good quick shortcut I can

use there we

go that was much

better

that's drop

one I'm still in the lead

so dropped one though

but

okay annoying I have

to

quite the process yesterday the

last okay that's

fine only could do

this okay now I'm starting to

drop

okay I went too quick on that I know

where will

show oh is cheating

now it takes way too long to just

no h okay seriously he's he's still know

like hot Keys here we

go there we

go Z Cy KY

starts

almost everywhere get rid of

them I wonder if I

can win through this

state okay that was a terrible attempt

let's try again okay this time I def

that

one okay I dropped two of them come

on I even though it was one less I come

on oh I better than nothing I got the

Shi and

everything good good step

too The

Shield get in up the balls

no yeah I'm down to

D try

this

no now gu we have the

balls

okay okay it's shooting towards me good

and okay something from

here

okay I could try that again because now

because I never

sh that was that was

worse that was also

wor that was worse even

worse well I didn't get a shield at

least there we

go we

go even though even though I'm using

this I I feel like I a great

lead is that good nah let's try it one

more

time

now

I watch Sho this

Cor

I I'll say this

as I second St for

this

me training

him come

on there we go perfect finally you

St double negative yeah I did win using

sa days but I will did it

finally after like six hours of trying

and many save States

lately

continue now my dress how dare you you

don't have had

redeem so the stealing my dress is is to

redeem to Fat

me this is close I'm not sure if it is

because you're looking at my

underwear

okay so basically stand controls 3 2 one

go I

guess it is different in that you want

to stre I

guess no it's drinking the thing

wi is part just three at anyway

so 3 2 1 go and this is a much quicker

game mode

too

what

wins does not sound like he's saying

Ru that's not how you say

ru

he going after

me

oh oh come

on no none them are going to

he running around I

can't be like that when they're fighting

me

oh

WS what cordex was supposed to

win 3 2 1

tries

wao I won the

challenge

now I can do the next one let's see what

this

is cuz now now I need to win once win by

defeating the other place in the okay oh

25

seconds

that's that's going to be

hard he probably going another one of

these impossible

challenges what like they didn't try to

recover from the AG

that would at least make it

easier there we

go I guess it's work

anyway I thought that would be much much

harder but it worked out

anyway

well one

more wi without the ability to save

yourself falling kind of not having that

ability anyway because I'm terrible at

it you

fail okay I need to be a bit more

careful 2 1

go ah someone's

tiny

1 like

yeah half the time you become immobile

advantage we get rid of

them would be a trick

to take cortex it's only you and

me hey you moved over

it ah

yay you win tiny pun C off look at that

that's a way to win we we're staring at

each other for a while before getting

going that was

fun very same now made made some good

progress there was smell Panic now it's

for El

loo at least this game a bit

easier tiny pon pon ping ping and CLE a

with your color to capture the center

break the special crates to turn your

squares into

points Al I can do so like both game mod

at once win by having the highest score

when the time runs

out

and remember just break it oh but you

said I can en

circle now you need to decide what you

Sor

yeah

oh okay so in circle only fills the area

it doesn't do point I

see get out of the

way oops I land

light

get out of the way

cortex I think I think the TNT

might just going

to Tri Area

this 3times

three got oh shooting diagonally is that

an

option there we go I have over 100

points oh no

exploded elepant bottom logo what bottom

logo my my

underwear my clothes my dress at least

my at least underwear get to say

on hey my

squares turn into

TNT oh

I need I need an exclamation point

nice I know I'm supposed to in circle

areas

but thanks to much

effort

we go now I second

it my

way yeah it definitely know by three

area again got over 100

points okay someone has a too

much oh

no I'm back how's the best bun bun Bean

oh a new pattern oh no don't look red

look there was a there was a

secret

and Just

Smiles

oh oh I like

this

well just picking up the boxes I mean

you can Proby can can the

way they even try to make Ana it's could

get destroyed very

quickly whoa over 100 points

no don't don't

peek

I didn't even realize my dress

was it was so

quick he came in

and coming stilling Dr and and not

leaving

luckily I'm going now I'm you'll be

taking a dress with me win by being the

first to decrease your score to zero and

I have like 50% more than they

have because since when was this game

fair yeah if I try to make an area oh

look I made an

area

oh no no I thought I was safe

but

no okay I'm no I didn't I didn't realize

how little

point

you

fail

H didn't realize how little points the

call I

had

no

good

nice

this can this

shoes get out of my

way this one might be a

tricky

because if I also pick up the boxes

more and that that also means that they

have less boxes to pick

up and they're going to just draw over

their own lines back and forth or like

each other

lines

no get out the way whoa that was close 3

seconds left C seven points but I'm just

manage to to

EIT

okay final challenge of this

level avoid

reproduce

attacks so I guess I instantly lose if I

touch one of

those

I also assume that the computer will

never touch

go keep

meing you fail

how much damage does it TNT

the how did that not fake after the

thing

There You

Go

fail 3 2 one

go guess that

worked

oh TT

nice no stay

there there we

go wa 10 seconds

left that's a

success

metal Fox that doesn't sound good that

sounds like the tank

game and the tank game is the

worst okay the the ball game is the

worst the tank game is the second

waste destroy all of your opponent's

tanks win by being

yeah 3

2

cortex

wins yeah

know 3 2 one this was pretty

fun you say

so

oh oh I didn't try

to

okay yeah I don't know how to do the

tank I'll be I to make some food

okay everyone is

going I appreciate that everyone who

decides to stay stay

here I appreciate everyone who doesn't

stay here too I appreciate everyone who

just come by for a short

moment oh hello

C

oh

there you

go I let them deal with each

other happy Friday pon pon

hello CU your papa now need to get used

to that oh yeah you can shoot yourself

in this game mode increase the

um

why can't I move all a

sudden can pause but I can't

move okay now I can

move

weird he has more Health than me you can

shoot multiple

times I need to basically make him shoot

himself

oh like that that's my only chance of

winning no I think

this

there you have

wins don't have any health like shooting

yourself is I

think what makes the

game

well

oh

hey your

D one tank mistake tanks AR

closer doing I see

means

D I mean yeah you are

right

the problem is

thatu can shoot like three times oh I

actually won well I can only shoot

once but I guess Koko has stronger power

in it shots but but do that matter if

you can only shoot once and

miss

so basic trick them into shifting

themselves

okay win by defeating the other players

in the okay 3 2 one

go

you fail

I tra to I TR

to now moving

there

H okay I guess it works when they kill

themselves yes some random luck until

I try try a try

again everyone pumped themselves

yep the play playable area is so small

the tanks are very slow

but avoid the falling m 3 2 1 just a

regular

oh falling like that I

see

you fail they dropped it straight onto

me go oh

dude you

fail yeah I got H my two Min or

something no I

shot

ah safe

like how they they they're all all off

to me but they also want to

win Dash is

this what kind of Doty R yay yeah and

then some

random match they started taking it's

each other themselves oh yeah it was

this

one p says my name

of the set number of laps is possible to

win by being the first over the finish

line or to play who is lead when the

time Runs

what oh thank for the

bounce no not like

that oh wrong

way get out of the way I'm trying to

Boosty

the easiest game code let's see what two

two tricks they're trying to

implement well I guess you need a

chewing

toy I don't know what you can chew

on she want a car

it when by defeating the other players

in them I was going to say it's going to

be like the cheating

oh I'm

just I have to win I have to do 10 laps

in one

minut one lap

per seconds that's going to

hard I

managed

no I'm out the Boost no

no have to reach

go time up

no a little B nibbles on Pawn I guess

depend what part of pwn are you nibbling

on if I dare to ask

it

oh

oh keep managing to hit their opponent

o s that way

away out the

Boost

no again final lap in 5 seconds

no

Kong Kong won manag the

left

there if I see explode exploding I'm

sorry don't be here

forever he's never going

away well hello rocket

man let's go with

some

reason

sudden

I'm back with my food

better after defeating the

monkey

you replace monkey with pon pon I made

homemade pizza oo I want to make

homemade

pizza I don't remember what I said I

wanted to put on the

pizza

come on

cortex wait cortex are good all of a

sudden one lap in 3

seconds

nope knock backs in whatever but I think

the idea is stay on the track but I am

on the track I think I'm doing pretty

well when when it comes to on track

staying just that sometimes I turn a bit

too

much or it gets knocked off but I mean

that's not my

fault

okay okay I guess I did drive off

once give be

fine oh out of fuel how to boost

them it's de fuel keep now come on

cortex blocking your

way one lap in 2 seconds can I do it no

up I'm not too far from completing

this someone went a bit too too fast

into two

furious

good back

cortex you managed to stay on the track

okay no how dare

you

way no I got tacked wait how did that

work

okay managed to do three eight

laps if you were doing well then this

wouldn't be me four Millions attempt I'm

not trying that many

times I want to see you do this

Challenge and see how good you are

well Oh's going the wrong

way

no one left in 5 seconds

no KOA did eight

lefts the BS has have two left yep

cheating me when I see fail yay wait why

are you celebrating F I have to start

over go no I don't good

at least it gave

me game was kindness nice for

once stop

this excuse me

yes there we go now you missed

yourself one is easier to deal

with

yay you

win good thing

checkpointed that's unfair you died you

should have restarted at the start

made your sad face you want me to

fail how dare

you is this uh oh

wait time at three time to go to

four Once More

Room

it's going to be another ball level are

you

ready Sky

balls it's more enjoyable when you fade

oh Rocket Man look how nice of

here

oh no ball level again yeah it's like

one on every

world this is a very different team

though use your ship to deflect the

balls away from your goal Beware of the

falling

engines win by being the last place

that 3 2 one

go wo wo wo wo

hey what is

this did it say fading engine not foring

engine that would make more

sense am I supposed to be aware be aware

of that

though

well I dropped the first ball so much

easier than the other

one no not

ball I got two balls I

mean

three I let Three Bs to by the

way

for but what would happen when I when I

plan

defeated what's what's the crystal

challenge going to be have the engine on

your side constantly failing have the

whole have the whole thing

tilted against you and you start with

like 10

point

and the opponents have 20 and you should

win okay they still have electricity a

bent

line

W one

one this go

this Coco oh yeah I forgot to check when

she walked again

oops Oho I mean same three characters

every time it wouldn't be more fun if

they bu a bit but I I guess I think the

characters picked are determined by

which character you

pick pretty determined it's not

random every time we play as Coco it's

going to be these three characters whoop

at least the CPS are playing against

each other as well yeah well come on

that face through me or

something and again

against each CPU is playing against

itself as

well see kind of wish ways tilting

sometimes because it's already at an

angle you can kind of see the whole

thing not doing so well

now at least it's

a not

so

yes I like

that no balls my

way do so go

to no and only let one more ball

through and it was that fun

no wait I have more points where did I

get points

from do I get points for defeating

enemies

maybe the C challenge the are my

function everyone gets 30 Burns that

would don't to play to play because the

gamees like that now pon has all the

balls for herself yes oh my balls all my

balls

don't touch my

balls no

no give your balls to

pun yes

let me take all your

balls

no

oh come

and cortex one on each of

them one there you go cortex let's one

two there you

go wa another

wind

2is is funny

he

just

let's just let me send all the balls

through your

gos

cuz everyone has start with 20 points

that's a total of 80 points so 80

balls require to for everyone to reach

here oh press is back no more tummy for

you

oh no my dress is

gone this is the worst thing that could

have

happened my deepest secret has been

revealed we can that though have

you one my T is p okay that was that was

easy oh no there's there's not four

things

okay let's see what this is then I guess

it's just I have less points than

everyone else try to

win like every every one of

these defend your go with ODS again

exactly 2 1

go

exactly starting off

bad

got this isn't the crystal

challenge I guess the crystal chall

wouldn't be different amount of

points man I wouldn't be surprised if

it's like that the only the engines on

your side will be failing and so it will

only tilt towards your side every

time I'm missing the

bones thing

over

no no no you

fail C he

left

go

okay no stop do doing that just

cheating no another

one he just avoided that one like I

do

okay looks good so

normal

match

can't

who just one

point yes you

yay thank you drink I'm actually out of

water if you don't

mind because I don't know how long I

would probably stream for long today

because

of

reasons

because because of

reasons um so I

will drup the minute ads uh yeah you

don't get ads I if you subscribe and I

will FL the

water give

me

here we go I back those two black

one

so P all right you're not subscribing

anymore

fornite if

only uh let's

see yeah because

um like I think I mentioned that I have

no problem with having a fortnite

costume if I get like royalties from

that well let's see I got 47 th000

points Channel points

on Greg Channel points out of

75,000 I'm almost

there almost so close now I can do

the and I guess I can go and

save

saing

saing we actually not be 57 minutes rest

it will be

like Po it would be like

um 65 minutes

me I'm think as slightly

early

and the ads will it's not like the ads

play 57 minutes after I play them they

play

like somewhere into like 5 minutes

before like at 55 minutes or something

like that the as

play somewhere between 15 and 55 anyway

it's over let's continue with the next

challenge which I assume it's just I

have everyone is supposed to reach a

number of points and I have to reach

more points than the computers because

they they can't make tricky computers

so with my being the first to decrease

your score this year I in a lot of that

yes 2 1 they actually have computers

have 90 points instead of the eight of

the previous

challenge see ah too

late get out of the way

Forex

Miss oh

shoes let's start

forward probably need shoes I cannot use

the P because you can override the

shoes no I got

shot oh he in the corner

nice no shum One Step too

far for cortex he's not oh he got the

first it's a very first purple box and

he got one

point no I got

shot do like that you can actually land

on your

own that the Box counts first before you

land okay that took one try I

think

remake make them all start at

70 Crystal time what's this I think what

I said was if I land on my own Square

it's game

over so I should not use missiles

because that's a risk the only way to

color Square by stealing them from your

other play no this is this is

horrible

how how am I supposed to because then I

need to steal them wait there we

go but then I is going to override them

see I got one point

who the demon PL is

this oh I can lock them no I can't lock

them because it's moving

around like it's moving quickly I

am now I can't I can't even lock

them we going to take those boxes

anyway even if I get Z points at least

they don't get any

points

come on now they doing it to

me oh he had

nothing

you fail I mean I it wasn't that far

away but this this seems a bit

brutal least I'm allowed to step on my

own

squares no he cashed to

me

I didn't even get to keep this

Square no you're not allowed to take

that not exactly sure where the

p

oh oh I fle through by

everyone we

go now I just need a purple

box oh yeah and then I get hit and then

lose everything

no I mean yeah I lose everything because

they

still this is going to be

hard you

fail 3 2 1

go no I didn't shoot that

way

wow two

points oh I accidentally picked up P I

guess by removing my

missiles oh I got hit and lost my

missiles

no it turned

around it was smart no

stop and holding P does not defend

yourself against

Miss which at least

would would give it at least one use

no

turn

trying you fail yeah C with 89 points

this is this is going to be the tricky

one me why did I is a good first time

around yeah as soon as I shoot someone I

really need to get a purple box as soon

as I

can everyone only a missile give me a

missile

now he's removing all my

yellow

don't jump besides

me hey now so set

up you

fail okay cortex is just having too many

points

there oh I picked up the missile after

and before I got

shot oh

points

no I should

have oh that moved away from

me

okay take

my yellow

circles there you

go

no

it's I just catch

the you

said

you

fail well second place is not

bad I guess

it's go going to be possible but it just

needs a bit of a lock where everything

land oh I moved

away

no come on you're in my

way one

point

there should show slightly

L there we go my

points wow one point

again oh I question okay

I'll after this round I'll give it the

attention he

needs regard I win or

lose let's see and I'll also get to the

comments if there is any oh I was close

cuz this game mode probably requires a

lot of probably I see it does require a

lot of

concentration come on come

on it probably wasn't enough money but

oh that end just before I

land no was no more comments okay what

is the hardest part of trans

for I mean that's a very open

question

I wouldn't

say like trying to rank every

Everything

2 I

mean cuz there's there's so

many different things

that yeah are tricking in different

ways

no my box

so so oh

no oh all my all my potential points

gone he

so

oh

there you

go he's stealing all

them come on come on they're keep

they're like intentionally blocking me

from getting

down no I didn't I didn't want to move

up so yeah if

you

um I guess it I guess there's no easy

answer to that

question there so many so many so many

things

that many

there was a

was another question do you have trans

friends yeah okay that was that do easy

easier question to answer

yes I I know some trans people

that

uh talk to quite a

bit and I would

say I would

be

friends I hope they see me as a

friends

oh I my too so

yeah at least one more

point

oh you

fail

now youing the question that's good yeah

I just wish to

theion yeah I I guess that would be the

answer for the I can't see what is the

hardest part I guess I guess the hardest

part would

be for people to recognize me as a woman

and that's for like various reasons like

people say they accept him as a woman

but that doesn't mean that they

actually see me

like

they that that they just can't see me as

a woman or subconsciously

can't

which which can be determined by how

people phrase

things Y no

point them no

mind you mean the people

wait

I mean it's like people I

know just they don't mean

anything bad it's

just 3 2 1 go it's means don't care what

they think

okay I

mean

not too B about

it

oh I wish it was the uh missile that

flew in all

directions

nice maybe not the best one

Sho oh go three points

why does he why does have so many

points now we have more

points oh invincibility frames I did not

get

anything

no thought it was

quick yeah this is a

loss yep

that's

yeah one more

try oh he

moves hey look at

that but then they're deleting all my

Pio

circles but beautiful for yellow sets

Vortex no he ruined

it

go no don't moov

it one

point

of course of course and then he picks

that up okay game

over

didn't mean to do that but I gu got one

point you

fail yeah I mean there was already I

knew that was not going to

work

oh nice no oh I didn't take it oh come

on

no no I got two points at

least

no per

it

oh

nope oh come

on it flew through him you fa it went

well but then then I miss everything up

3 2 1

go

R my come on why like someone like they

have higher prority than

me no I reacted too

slow I have to oh I can go

there no blocking my oh not going the

way I

wanted

no

yeah I should have picked that

up one point I

moved you fa

I know what's new all is failing 2 one

go dress is

back that does not mean to re the dress

oh come

on

that was

something yeah this is

lot

how many more hours I don't

know this is not

scheduled

you yeah that was worse 100 points how

much

2

go head open Brain

inside

not allowed to take that okay I need

that attack the W here you

go

or

no that

me oh come

on where are missiles

oh two

points come

on the computers definitely have like

high priority or

something jumping forward to the scare

and then he stops at the square and then

the computer jumps in front I guess to

Compu B like a

frame know but it's feel like like you

have to stop and wait because the

computer should have it's the computer

already decided in advance to go to that

square if you're not allowed to go to

it

nope

no my

Square my my purple

box my purple

box there you

go it need to close

but don't want them to take the M oh

just landed

right

that's the one I was going

for

work well I got

she

oh this is going

to this is going to be a

challenge it's like as soon as there are

yellow squares on the field they go all

all out to cover

them

nope have four

points you landed on the box before oh

no my rest is

gone the flowers

are

oh

nice

no threw everything away I

SW where the purple boxes I mean I see

them oh come on every time before I'm

going to cat them in

you fail

oh wa anyway Swing Swing time

now I didn't mean to move her I just

want to shoot

her

here you

go

no wow Zer

points no he do everything

away hey they're working

together I mean I they working together

do stupid

decisions both are they both are equally

yeah I

just I just need to more missiles up

here around

me

go so it's kind of I do have to rely on

RNG as well and also aim but that's okay

too much for

me so now they're going all out to

remove those yellow circles yep all

yellow second are

G oh yellow suers need to remove those

immediately

do does not make things

easy okay I guess I'm not getting out

that

n

that now now you have more specific

question that might be EAS to

answer let's

see

oh I mean that was

terrible is it hard for TR people to

date in

Sweden well I don't know I would assume

it's hard for Trans people to date in

general

like I would

assume but I could be wrong about

that

yeah it's easy to date bisexuals I have

not Tred tried like that I already like

yeah I have no experience

anything ien heard really about seem

more than

like d lucky forever I always thought SW

was more open except in people more

groups well I

mean it

appears to be that but but I

mean I mean just be

let

yeah I mean just because a person is uh

more accepting that doesn't mean that

they're going to change who they are

attracted

to that

sense you

fail yeah this is this is going to take

forever have been

close hey I I guess I landed on the box

before

I I mean this now it goes there and

I now it's sto

it I guess I'm not getting that

one he decided to go to that

square where is my

missile I'm picking up

the there you go nope I picked up a p

which does nothing for

me want to hit

someone yeah I need a better

aim that's my current is

Shue just in general not forting oh

yes you day

things I have

yeah I have not open up publicly about

being trans where I live

I will move back to stockh home to my

parents and see I will see how that

goes yeah don't think going to get that

SP I should probably picked up that

purple box

anyway oh yeah just just place the

purple

boxes right in front of them enemy sells

too why

not

hey purple

boxes Oh no I got hit to mve back

oh yeah again

again feel like we were jumping side by

side but he had order somehow occupy

that squ I want to go to so I could no

longer move forward

he

qu wait why did it

what oh

ow

okay need attack on the wrong

row yeah this is a

loss why is there a quick option to Y

start

still as terrible as

you you

fail

3 2 1

go

well now come

on and then I that up

uh and I get

nothing nice finally something

good no I want to go to oh come

on yeah he manag to pick up both

no why

does I didn't want to go down one exra

step it's like they re desing a square

one square

ahead you fail I

mean when you when you start jumping to

the next Square it's your square and no

one else can jump to that square that

makes sense but it feels like they they

are reserving another Square

forward because it feels like I'm

standing side by side by someone and and

then I can't jump forward because the

one next to me is going to jump one step

forward and then jump in front of

me like like it's two steps ahead

of probably not what's happening but it

really feels like

it on oh come

on

missed nice let's

go

oh

oh

I should have seen that I was

concentrating something

different

oh there very

iive oh

not you

fail 2 this is going to get tricky

go

W one

point wow two

points let me so far away get tricky not

been

yeah it's been trick oh eight

points it's already been

tricking oh come on I want to move

there

more

points qu has

like 85 points

oh oh IGN

it you fail I was having less points

anyway but that was a

weir go oh more hydrate

more going the wrong

way yeah they really need a restart

option there

okay

maybe I need

to take my posture so I

can how long does this take it's a

minute long

match

I really take the chance when I'm not

allowed to jump on my own

squares 2 one

go

no yes oh it's my lucky

day okay I didn't mean to attack you but

I guess it worked

out oh I need

this no don't go that way no

no you're not

that get out of my

way no I missed

him there we

go

well I won I don't know

how I I guess I guess hydrating and

posture checking

helped was quit and started over and

then just

won just like that

well let's see if this works this should

be just a regular game

mode it's basic it's basically the

trophy it just had two wins in a row

against the bit trickier oppon oh look

crash is here 2 one

go some normal game

play

there give it P treat

me no

nice oh nice too I didn't even need

e

okay I guess I can't override lock

squares with lock

squares it was right

try

no I won you win a bit easy finally yeah

finally I have so many

tries

go and back to the game play I

oops squ into the

corner I'm going to go to

bed have fun I'm I'm doing my best

scen

but maybe J likes it when

my cloes randomly disappear but I'm

unaware of

it like they are attacking all of my

squares working

together

like they are on a

te well they were said to be like the

best

Quest on this

level probably know each other quite

well

and team up against some a new one like

me no I did that wrong it just to jump

to the right and get that box but I

didn't react quick enough how how does

how does an opponent always have

slightly more point to me every

time yeah nice your reaction is usually

pretty cute I mean that's F that's

F I guess you are for a

reaction

oh just yes jumping around minding my

own

business I gu

see

those SES are

mine

no well you could see I removed all my

squares before you could sto steal

them

you fail 100

points 3 2 always so much

challenge

no everything everyone else sorry i'

been gone for so now don't be sorry I've

been really busy at work and working ACH

things too that's not exciting

don't be sorry he perfectly fine if you

busy I respect everyone having being

busy 3 2 1 go

maybe

corner 3 2 so

something exciting going

on well I

didn't F if you

don't answer the question regarding

which what lunch you

have I

one I have managed to defeat that l with

the help of save states but I only use

Save States on a single

level that's

it you

fail okay that that 2 1

go now why are you two shooting at

me

F

fck you

fa they're attacking me okay I need to

hide in the

Yes

W yeah the tank now I just need to win

the regular mode but instead of just

winning three times I need to win

two times in a row instead of three

times

row before but the computer is going to

be up 2 one hard

go harder

being attacking me only I

guess

go go where this

requirement

then here's a challenge avoid getting

sludge in your engines okay that's going

to be a

challenge

doesn't

time up

16 I'm still confused about H hover

boost allowed you to move freely in any

direction but like

what I'm pretty sure I can move freely

in any direction as it is at the

moment

unless they mean like oh that was a

comination

okay

where are

the there it

is but I didn't get

it I picked up seven balloons in 90

seconds three

quarters

ah yeah means that I'm no longer

affected by the

Spy not say that

instead time up yeah think this is this

is one go prob too tricky for

me

yeah

my excuse me just here kicking

me I tried to beat them and someone

change the color of

think

now I need now

fromo I think it's I think it's have 96

not Happ

so two qus of time has

passed and now

5 I only destroyed 11

balloons time up it's probably a bit too

tricky I probably have to come back to

this game some at some later

point

I've been going for almost 8

hours so I

think I think it's fair to

sa play more later I have more days I'm

going to stream um let's switch to the

more quiet

thing and no there is where Street

scen

so I'm going to have more time streaming

the coming day uh so I'm going to

stream have time to stream so because

I'm basically done with the house I just

need to wait for a few things to be

resolved before I can actually

move uh and so I'm going to stream in

the

meantime it s fair right robbed robbed

for

what

didn't it

Tre not disabl anything it should still

Tre thanks for stream mean I can refund

it if you

want I can refund one of the sports

for cuz he didn't play in

full and switch

because this one you got one another

okay

so someone suggested as uh uh

streamer who's playing Pokemon SC

violets not specifically for the game

play Oh My but it's

uh Let's

do let's let's do

bner I think would be funny

let's let's yeah you pick any

emote prob one of mine because they have

bunnies if you don't if you're not a

subscriber you can just pay 150 points

something whatever is 100 points and

then pick any

any any emotes you

want this something like that boom yeah

that one works too

yes something like

that or yeah if you have it it's even

better and then we go and visit Sunny

XD speaking

of good the question was if I had any

trans friend I haven't get to know him

enough like I wouldn't call his friends

just stream and I

watch but

he's transgender I mean he's one of the

first tags so I guess that's

fitting I I think he's he he's an eeve

and he's very cute so I

think and this can be funny can be loud

to I guess that's

a and he doesn't like to be called fun

me you should play Tomb ra one day the

or yes I have like three people

suggesting me I should do that I should

do like a proper tomam

Raider uh

stream go go through all the games

but let's go and visit stunny the

Eevee

so let's let's

go be

nice oops too

early
