okay hello

back to spiral

and trying to

hello kitten

back

to doing this thing again

this large amount of enemies that shows

up

bright Sun

expire show what you got

he can do it that's the spirit

I can't do it

uh I've got more

basically

deal with that one at a time

I'm going to slow down but

here we go

no it's only one

oh it's easy

happens

flashing I would assume it would be

spawn but

I don't know what's the point of it's

flashing

yeah

fashion quite that way

okay let's do this

hi I'm awake lunch so I'll be taking off

shortly and can't hear anything due to

the radio in the truck so

why do you need a radio in the truck I

mean like

attracting

do you

thank you

they're stuck

but they didn't seem to attack me so

okay this is the wrong one

Melody attack

okay I have to test by her you're going

to die

okay now you're definitely going to die

you need help

quickly

okay

[Music]

it's probably enough

that's rid of that one oh I need to

squish it

foreign

yep

okay then they would slow down twice

there

when I tried to use slow down but it

just didn't want to activate

so

and it

okay here we go

you know these

[Music]

excuse me oh I didn't make easy twice

foreign

let me try this one more time

I probably don't even have to do it but

I should be able to do this anyway

maybe I need to do it to trigger

something with that belt

the first two it would be easier

okay there we go all right smelling me

foreign

[Music]

again

don't miss do it again

there we go

okay I did it

well

well luckily I'm not too much driving so

I can watch right now

celebrations

I did it

let's attack yourself

there's like

pound

s

it is right now

okay you smell myself very annoying

I had something easier to use against

you all

like that

honestly

words

I guess

all right let's take care of you

oh if I'm down through the level I would

and that was easy

I'll be back I need to check the work

again

for damage you are stuck you need to fly

now where I read I might return oh

yeah that sounds important yeah you

better do that

and it's more important than this stream

excuse me

okay

yeah I don't know if it's your own

people or something you're attacking you

but okay I see a shadow

uh I didn't get like a cutscene does

that mean a checkpoint no it does not

mean a checkpoint

of course it has not been a checkpoint

you have to go through this whole thing

without dying once

yeah it certainly makes it harder than

the previous game

why are you running

I attacked me from behind but I'm

pulling 159 oh

are there more here

thank you

too much

damage

sir and

thank you

yeah I'm not ready yet

it's about sick but

enough now

soon maybe

quite a bit about exactly where you

should stand to blame that thing

yeah I can do this

excuse me I didn't want to thank you

okay that

foreign

um okay

okay so what I need

no not more slow motion I need more

energy

like that

and then

yeah I need my health

and then with slow motion

here we go

one two thousands transpire run

and now

what's more slow motion these are so

hard to deal with

yeah

okay done

so

that's that

with no checkpoints

foreign

[Music]

what are you doing

what is this

one at a time

oh it's not a lot of life

I remember the boat parts from the

previous game both levels are always

stiff yeah it's basically this game is

doing what maybe both levels so

difficult

by not having a checkpoint

basically I have to start to help

everything when you guys

I don't know what this does but it seems

fast

I don't know it seems it seems to put us

in some way up then

exactly

let's take care of this last one

we have Siege stealing ghosts

you start a profession

and then I'll probably go down from here

okay another spider is down there in

that cutscene

all right okay

now as far as back up here again okay

I'll go down

foreign

take care of most of them

I like all of them

foreign

thank you

and here's the continuation like we're

getting these guys a few stuff

let's have to check my

stories things

now let's

oh yeah there you got something

at restaurant now oh

yeah you can watch without the Audio I

guess

there's also an option just the same way

and that's good thing you have these

subtitles

all right

one step ahead of you buddy

yeah

hey who are you calling jump

astounding the amount of trouble you've

managed to call

you've only brought it on yourself

that's not the application

okay I'm doing badly already

foreign

[Music]

thank you

oh good it puts you here yeah

we kind of rude if they didn't

right that was just get stuck

that was the rules

thank you

I don't know what happens to the day

and also you can't skip the cats

it gets good start

good continuation

oh

yeah

foreign

laughs

ah

well I'll continue

come on I finally this game is cheating

so much

over there

nice means I guess it's it's working

[Music]

all right

all right sorry

yeah you can't do it

I'm actually he's fire instead

all right

nothing can slow down as much as

I find that doesn't have teeth

this doesn't go into the second phase

not attack him I guess that worked

all right

foreign

because I

approached him it's the

it stopped the uh

nothing left on the wood malfunction

because that makes perfect sense

all right

this area the python is so small

foreign

put magic here

foreign

[Music]

thank you

yeah this is quite tricky

whoa

especially when that's just cheating

[Music]

okay

oh is that shitty

foreign

foreign

[Music]

behind it

cool

ways

no motion

them the how is that even possible you

can't just let them get away we're going

after them right

wait

did I just say that

actually my

should come after me he wanted a map

did he take the map

did I miss that part

did you forgot they were after them

I'll keep me a good hit

[Music]

London

no it's floating

okay now it's definitely floating

let's fly down here is that what you

want me to do

foreign

yay

what is that practice

I have something here

apparently this is an anime

foreign

[Music]

yeah I can do that

problem

[Music]

okay

thank you

now

there are these

I think he's first

sorry for that

okay excuse my factory first

the other transplant

Dash we saw

Nissan

you just jump on this thing

apparently

because these boats are magical

all right Tony

that's too magical it couldn't take me

all the way I had to switch both

but

excuse me if I'm fighting others here

okay

there's a cannon here

I think the cat is meant to shoot let's

do that

yeah I don't think it

needs to be a broken property pack

I think it will make a hole in the boat

anyway

let's just push it straight here

apparently that's that was not allowed

come on

finally

thank you

lights

it on fire and explosions

oh does this one containers even oh

another color

foreign

what's up

that's that

[Music]

I'm at my house and time together

thank you for releasing me from that

area

this looks familiar

nothing

I closed it

how desperately

and I can't steal this throw it down

when they are affected by this thing

but yes teams

seems like they're taking less damage or

something

painted

ah it's one more here

let's do it for the leveling up

okay let's fight

amarora magic patch

foreign

[Music]

when the game told me to follow Sparks I

can't really follow Sparks when he

doesn't show me where to go

it came more like a general funnel spark

to get around these boats but I want to

have to do it once

and then he gave up why is that because

I didn't

so

fast enough

I'm going to another fight

let's do this

don't land in the boat and between

I'm just next to the box right yeah

you're like

right now

all right

another tissue I guess it's not a big

ass test

let's see blue

they have really been

stingy about this video Once

oh yeah there's another one

you're supposed to take their belts from

them

oh no that's doesn't blow off the boat

that sounded awesome

wants to be defeated

thank you

not for that one I expected but let's

try again

you might need to meet

but it doesn't

uh uh I see

[Music]

I see

what's going on here

I got the ghost

and we know where it goes don't like

fire

those are weak to fire

excuse me

thank you

right

oh

I assume I should take that and go up

[Music]

can you thank you

I need to ask you if you could jump down

on me

he was so excited that I didn't

I was I wasn't even able to ask me to

jump down before he just fell down and

die

because

a classic green one inside it

but that was destroyed

we put something here it looks like

you're trying to

interesting

I'm taking care of

okay I need to take care of this thing

okay there you go perfect

foreign

energy

that can use it on this one

and take out this one as well

like that

goodbye

there's others my energy

livestock dragon

and that's why I should continue

[Music]

this one is it's really too much now is

it

foreign

anyway

[Music]

where to now

is that

the big believer calls the boats I mean

a lot of times it's about

and came on sale not sure why that was

necessary

where is it

getting about

all right

really

and if I die I have to restart the whole

fight

I think I have the strength

string

oh but I have to call the belt again

because that was an exciting cut scene

yeah I thought the boat was moving but

it was camera panning or rotating

indestructible

foreign

[Music]

foreign

that's

[Music]

come on I'm sure you'll get it this time

that will just be at this Saturday

like that

easy

yeah couldn't you stop here or something

I could I get a plan hour

where are they both parked there

oh credits watch out parents you're

getting

hacked

okay I guess I'm done with this

way much more

[Music]

more

of his flying things hey come on you

can't attack me like within one second

about starting

okay I moved into that one

okay

which one does wait

but this fire hurts you

such consistency in this world

and nothing secret here no

this time you could just park next to

the boat unless I thankful plank really

necessary to inspiring to have

okay

huh FaceTime

because that's a great way of dealing

with him he's throwing it out okay

I should manually save yes be on the

safe side you never know about this game

no message before it's being people

okay

but I see I it just starts us

saying so I can jump out in this boat

and then

I can jump over to this box

I wonder if this is

not sure what I'm supposed to shoot

that's why I think that's not meant to

be used

I didn't expect an explosion for using

ice

no Hunter

okay

no that thing is burning

okay

so many pets

it's for a second hell there's nothing

to load account with

back welcome kitten you're doing great

I am making progress

so that is good

but um

I had another boat

all right if you set this the way back

yeah this is the weight but

what's up because

because I changed that one thing maybe I

should go back

foreign

animation

That was supposed to do that

drinks no thanks for you

oh it's a chair

foreign

The Horizon

here we go

yeah I don't want to find out

all right so it is faster okay I see

all right

maybe I can make more sense of it this

time

Cherry welcome cherry

I hope you enjoy

Legend of spider

or are familiar with it maybe

all right

um

experimenting

trying to figure things out

oh that's nice

that's it I said that thing is that

I see

I did

yeah now I see what I missed last time

I'll take care

thank you

I want to take care

of this Diva first

I don't know why it just felt like the

first

the rap spider don't go up the event

that's the other

does this mean about this running

forward

oh

okay I've used that one

foreign

did it unlock any new path

no

sorry

open ID

is just meant to be a condensation

that's not any options

thank you

[Music]

I don't know if I can bring it away

top he just fell down

well that's not an option

uh this one here

he didn't even think this area was

accessible

that God that was what confused me

but looks like I missed something but I

didn't

but I want to find the ghost oh yeah are

you coming down at some oh you might

need five stars

[Music]

oh cool

[Music]

okay then respond on the ground again

nope

how does it

yes

questions

not

what I guess

foreign

thank you

very hard boats

all right level up

no I need I need help

he can see that kitty

foreign

so this is the continuation

everything

I knew you could do it

that's great

there's some positivity

this is okay

foreign

one day they will contain something

important

problem

where are we going now

oh no not again

I'm already fought you and I already won

can't you accept your defeat

and you just don't know when to quit

then you don't know us very well I quit

all the time if you were the one fleeing

sorry I thought it was going to sound

cooler

foreign

[Music]

okay

give me ammo

foreign

you can't do it I know you can do it

okay what's going on now

okay that didn't that's bad

okay this isn't good

no that's

yep

I don't have an idea look out world what

does she do today

oh

oh a change of outfits

[Music]

all right

oh my cute outfit yeah

pretty cute outfit isn't it

oh

okay

no it's a horrible timing

[Music]

okay so I have an idea of how we should

do this next part

I can do it once so

okay here we go

it should be maximum

I have one that you picked it yeah I

mean

come on you can't attack me during a

cutscene that's just cheeky but I guess

that's that's what this game is

constant cheating all the time it sounds

like they haven't trusted his skin

ah come on

all right time

walk the plank

no

what about the map

that felt good

enough free flights again not the birds

I don't know maybe the birds just

I was like bam and he was all

which reminds me where are we going now

I didn't get a very long look at the map

but there's got to be some sort of

landmark sure I'll just keep my eyes

peeled for the flashing sign that says

spooky Moon Tampa

no

he's Tommy here just pulling over to go

to the bathroom

do you need to pull hour over in there

oh

more storyboardy

so one thing when I use this style for

when it was basically a story being told

it's actually borax but if it's just

going

what's going on at the moment that just

they didn't bother animating it that's

basically it

to me that's that's how it appears to me

especially since the years I started for

someone telling a story

something's not right

why is it so dark here

can you hear me

I'm sure I want to know what

a flash of lightning is

what you must learn to control your own

emotions if you are to tame the free

spirit of electricity

control your emotions to control the

powers

energy to charge through your body and

anticipate its movement

then

unleash it

willingly

very impressed

this is accentuated by your impulsive

nature

trust your instincts

the elements

it has expressed right to select

electricity element in the future

pressing hard Square then release it to

shoot an effective orb the longer you

hold the button down the further it will

go

let's start again

okay

useful Maybe

really depends on how strong it is

press and hold

triangle Titus virus electric Whirlwind

the most spiral around with the left

hollow stick

where did they go oh there they are

they spin around until they die the lip

Glide up in the air

I was doing this thing again

right

they sound when they fart is cute

if you want to hear something maybe I

have an idea for the game I should play

you can charge crystal balls switches

which magic if you breathe the right

kind of magic onto them I have so far

never seen a single Crystal

switch thingy in any of the levels

okay

I thought I was about

yes I I can't

hit that one

I see

I should

oh

welcome radius

I am still not you just used to to raise

um

like this my inexperience

welcome

hello hello

Let's uh

right

they have this function

and hopefully it works

it doesn't seem like it's working

oh it's working just very slow

it's awesome it's fine

although it doesn't say

anything

so welcome uh

yeah this

as title says is the second Legend of

Spyro but uh

what are you playing

when I try to see if I can time this

all right

yeah they just get a working out well

hello

just cat yeah

that's how you treated

nice to see how to

right there

followers

I'm still

well it looks like it's got junkie and

pasta oh yeah yeah he's in his dream

world again

yeah

so

or playing a

the uh

well yeah if you're playing music you

take things I was playing something too

[Music]

or maybe it could have been art or

something what were you doing here

that's one of the general question

since you didn't tell me

uh

[Music]

they're done with this dream sequence

I also Aspire is currently drowning

okay I've completed your test what do I

do next

how can I find you

are you there great now the voice inside

my head is ignoring me

maybe I'll just take a peek

maybe maybe you're dead

[Music]

oh

someone's walking Center

that's probably someone's dream

hated this level

three seconds

I'm not a fan of dream sequences

and if not you will have the honor of

being the first to perishbody back

I'm going to get something to eat with

me back okay

let me know when you're back

[Music]

okay have a good time y'all are you

going

now very nice of you to trade

and I'm

very happy even if that's it if I I'm

really bad it is um

at expressing feelings and such

Turtle monster goodbye goodbye thanks

for everything

what happened well let's see you've been

you've been hearing voices in your head

and they've let us all along

running to find a place to wind down on

the island

oh

yes kit

how nice of you

huh

take care of my father thanks for the

soup oh goody

I do like me some spirity

I wouldn't say the legend of spice the

best potato but

but I do want to finish this uh game

because I haven't done that this is

I haven't had enough such time I think

but this is my very first place here but

I really need to get something new so

yeah

go and take her

news

you might need it

okay

oh it's moving on South

oh

this is very yellow

a lot of

my finger

the fantasy suspicious

but this doesn't matter

next thing probably was playing Dark

Souls using only a soup ladle as a

weapon ah it's pretty funny but also

very impressive that he actually managed

purpose

Dark Souls 2 specific yeah yeah I have

seen some of it

I did I think it was dark souls I was

watching someone

to doing a left-handed challenge

as

wish

oops

you can't put the weapons in either hand

but this cape is not meant to have a

weapon in his left hand

now

but

not even using a weapon that is even

trickiest

this is supposed to be switches

not that

I want to try this

with them here wait I haven't left the

gym sequence

guys look angry all right you want this

right here we go

alrighty she's up a lot of energy

it could be useful so let's upgrade it

only one level

this is

so something something

these are this week in Us in the dream

sequence

the ship level can't be used as an open

it just doesn't do much damage

that's as far as Santa comes it can

basically use anything as a weapon

anything you can hold

like I've heard that you can use Shields

As Weapons too

some of these like uh T1 wielding

Shields

Academy

yeah

yeah it didn't sound like the strongest

Google or bad thing

oh yeah yeah running on those doesn't go

well

yes that's it

no down time instead

doing double jumpings I have

more time to land

this is that area

because this is certainly the

continuation let me let me go back

this might be a stupid idea but

yeah there's actually some Shields that

are these weapons oh

well that makes it if they are

actually working as Weapons doing

meant to

yeah I have very little experience with

the game

maybe I'm able to get there with that

thing

let's try to land in the middle yep

there you go

perfect

so far

oh

no no no

I can't stand that

[Music]

looks like you found like green mask

thingy

yeah

died too so

but um actually I didn't see it because

I was focused on the other thing

that

I can't do that

and certainly much better now than him

or I cannot see anything must hit flat

okay

let me uh

I did get that thing so

let me see if I can get it my very first

green mask as well

not doing this at least

oh

okay

foreign

spiral did have the

okay the question has this thing

you can basically attack

attack

but

I find it too hard to dodge and yeah

since you can

basically stop them from attacking by

attacking them

I find it easiest to just constantly

attack instead of trying to dodge

including buses because it's much easier

to

just stay away from a bus and some

bosses

are designed for you to stay away so

they use a range attack which you then

punish them for it

and I I could be wrong but I think the

bosses are designed so you should not

stand close to them and Dodge because

they are using quite white attacks that

you can't

Dodge and still stay close

and

in my experience they have this whole

Dutch are you meant to go with that

are you actually supposed to go around

that way

did you say that from my green mask

somewhere

bye-bye oh actually I have I didn't

realize that

yeah apparently I have

so I went straight to the end of that

thing in third spot okay

and that's in it all right accomplished

about the timer

or the

my outfit by a center themed outfit

this is

how about the breakouts

you can release that thing

I want the battle it

let's do this properly

damage from that

that's a bit rude

okay

oh come on

I I did this last time

when I realized it was a second path

nice nice jump in there

went in the wrong direction

that's more like it

I mean I've been using a jet engine to

fly or something just being out

I think

yes I said it was flying with magic or

something

let me guess if I touch these

I think that was okay I was hoping

something else would happen

nope I just take damage

I don't know

I think it's now in here right quick

or not

Frozen

[Music]

oh

well

I'm not ready

please be kind

foreign

thing

I think I wish I had more green mask

thingies but alas

doing this thing again

what if I should choose something else

against it like eyes

it's nice

my eyes is polar powered

and I can level them up halfway

I'm supposed to learn this

okay no problem

okay ours doesn't seem to do much for

them

thank you

all right

I can't yes he's staying already

I just didn't slow them down which is

very useful

okay you're going to work it wake up I

said let's push this into place

you guys see what I have to do to open

this door

let's make sure

oh yes

let's take some pills

welcome back

[Music]

welcome

yeah and you wake up

wake up

some other legs

thank you

Google the spine declaring you don't

seem so Cleary

all right yeah

no you died by that

I cannot hear anything to deal with this

thing

[Music]

now play the fun this is like opposite

of snow

okay okay let's stop okay

[Applause]

well I kind of worked

oh there was some

um I guess it's good to save it on it

she probably don't jump down there

[Music]

I assume you're doing great in this game

yeah

I'm doing okay let's let's

call it that

I'm doing

enough to progress this game is harder

than previous

or two simple reasons

when you die you have to restart

everything resets as the last checkpoint

which like every game that's almost

no

no I'm hearing voices what is that no

it's electricity and Fire

nope

[Music]

this is the very first time I'm going to

touch switches with my patches which is

oh no we got we got some spiders

I'm not sure if there's Financial

foreign

because

now

don't do that because this looks like

electricity

if I should Place enough

okay please stop distracting me when I'm

picking this out

the country they do that

okay

[Music]

you can charge crystal ball switches

with magic if you breathe the right kind

of smelly but try wait wait are they

excuse about

thing is active now I see I see that

oh oh

I see I see

I see what I'm supposed to do

I'm not I'm not that stupid

which is I I just stumbled upon that

thank you I only got talked about

crystal balls switches like twice

short latch on hey come here

magic spiders come here

can you move closer

shrub is not a thing I would call this

thing okay

so while this is gonna be hard

this is yellow

now in fact it

says red now

it's not green is it

okay the right one I assume is green uh

you can't see because my face is in the

way

they write my assume is green and the

last one I assume is blue I also check

that hello welcome

yeah let's do it you're smart

now I was stupid okay so this one is

going to work here yeah see this one is

green

I mean if you get close maybe it looks

green but such a bad color and I think

and this one is blue

it's active now

so it's only

this one I have to act in uh yeah yeah

I did it

welcome Matthew yes more Legend of

Spider-Man

oh yeah I can do this so just charge up

a bit

okay or not

where's my house there's no house in

here

oh well

yes I continue with half heads

why is there a flying book

s don't like fire right

why is it come here

this looks interesting

isn't this

Inspire stream

with the select

more challenges to complete let me say

here are four

challenges for you to complete after

succeeding all four

this is a crush

Crush to work portal

loading loading

okay

oh they close the door behind me

give me some enemies

there they are oh yellow

can I switch no I'm forced this fires

okay

I had a feeling that I was forced to

inspire

d

okay that's why you're going to die

I don't take damage from that

[Music]

quick

they knocked into her

lights are there while he's technically

I try not to die again well thank you

for the tip and technically died he had

so little Health left so just falling

from that distance killed him

now he was already dead

he was waiting to learn to make you die

from him

limbo here is fake

the other things

it's a good night please either

[Music]

mint to move you closer

[Applause]

because apparently these balls

I need to jump a bit

that one I didn't expect that to happen

so this these switches are seeing a

lease now they need to erase replace

these magic defense

I'm gonna be lurking I said while I make

food but I hope dream is going well

it's this stream is actually going

really well I have not had any issues

and I'm

and I'm actually

getting the hang of how to make the

capture card work it's certainly not

just Italian thing

straight down

but uh

thank you

I don't know

when you fall down there you go thank

you

and see you too nice

yeah

but of course sometimes

I've got the both internet's disconnect

and the power cutouts kinda out outside

my control

but

aside from that

why does this book show

or ads I should post it

yeah

those are strong

that was half of my half remaining life

it did take quite damage

there can I to me there can I kiss the

fire thingies

why did you do that

I think I have the strength to go on

that's kind of how I checkpoint works

okay

down

bad dog down

just go down already stop shielding

yourself

put down

no don't hit me just die already

okay

spider diet

this is the second game in the new

series

the second game yes

it's the Legend of Spyro which is from

2000 so

I think it was two thousand

no not 2000s

later than 2000

it's two thousand something

and yeah

new it's the uh

latest series Skylanders

technically

a spiral

I think they

stopped being or inspired western part

of it they kind of

tenants consider spiral

like

foreign

uh no this is this is hard

where is my why is my good powers

2016 yeah

this is Magic Sparks

so yeah 2006

which is online

wasn't there just a single yearbook

between it

yeah

yeah it was this there was the second

file of the first Trilogy that came out

in 2000

where is

if you're ever into two

thank you

I'm going to stream 30 years I'll let

you know

okay

but yeah it makes sense 2006 2007.

that's the last episode 2008 or

something but

maybe maybe the second microwave

2009 seconds

and the third one is some PlayStation 3

which I am playing on

uh so that one will have better grab it

the first one I know really is Sarah

with your sexy you're doing 60 seconds

2007 the third one 2008. yeah but yeah I

thought it was not like that a single

year to finish

foreign

I'm dying

I'm going to prove you that you are not

undying you are currently dying

your kids actually nothing because

have trouble attacking you

there we go now he's dying

things back to dying that's your new

name

what's this Harry Potter

what's this wasn't this a level

apparently

I know it's about lighting lighting here

yeah it wasn't

thank you

anyway what's the desired level in the

first Harry Potter Decision One

oh so I am supposed to like this

interesting

oh and then go out okay

[Music]

let's then

[Music]

say

all right let's do it okay

I was supposed to light the candles so

the book comes up let's keep giving

it's okay we can try it yeah turn the

cans on

step on the book

I want to count it now okay they can't

we don't have to wait for cancer for

this to like expires floating again

yeah I I get a certain kind of wine but

I can't fly

we don't have time for that

how many are they

yeah

oh thank you

why this is

this is a

rest position

oh there it is

going to burn out again

what excuse me

um goodbye

okay okay

I got the screaming sorry about the

screaming

why are you just bad at landing on

platform for being a flying dragon

that's not exactly sure how he can cry

from falling because he didn't have

swimming please

die

they're here

to figure out how to deal with them but

I did saw something interesting

and it's not those it's this part I see

a green mask

for the remaining because they're four

on the ring four are going to be part of

the

it does increase it did increase the

green meter not by much but it's nice to

have a bit more

okay

skeletal uh no this this cat does not

have any from the skeleton

there is no Skellington in this front

where there has it why do they have some

incorrect name

what what are you what are you doing

no motion because that's cool they're

not annoying everything has happened

this this attack this this move is

supposed to break through his hands

I was told by the game that it was

supposed to

okay in the first game

that thing could not break through

Shields as far as I know

okay

but then in the second game we got a

tutorial that said that oh if the

shielding do that attack so you can

break through the shields which worked

in the start of the game but now it's

not working

out should I upgrade this one or this

one

that one is boring

blame is so fast that's after this

because I'm can I stream with the Flames

are you soon anyway

more

you're going to do this

okay

what what are you

um

okay I tried let's move on

didn't know what that was

looks like a butterfly maybe they went

back to the old skin style yeah in the

middle of the game that's that's a good

design decision

it would actually not surprise me

wait I'm not supposed to

do something here

there's so many strange decisions in

this sense

like

damn am I supposed to do

because it's it doesn't have a health

bar

okay be back in a bit

I guess that up here but

it has

it

yeah

spiders interperson Burns in his body no

I have no idea what I'm supposed to do

this thing

charge it

try that

no that doesn't seem to be doing it

either

in these states but it's using up energy

no it's not working right there

I don't know what I'm supposed to do

with that

because this door is closed

but I don't see uh

else

supposed to do

[Music]

this looks like a platform I'm supposed

to stand on

how do I get up

what's with this thing

I always used every move I can sync up

on that thing but nothing works

they have clothes start don't worry

of course of course

so that's how you get up

looks like a button the little moves

yeah I tried news I had bashing on it

but that didn't work

but it's just supposed to step on it

oh

it's moving way too fast

probably says space down to

if I was playing as Empire

this

no you can't stand on an idea

oh you are supposed to do that

yeah I try that a lot

and nothing seems to work but

yeah I was gonna say that was a piny

thing I have to press it again that

would be quite like

to know the platform is active

oh sorry that's from

nice transition I can't even land on it

and have like a drawing effect nope just

cut away glad you got it yeah it was a

beautiful cheesy

oh my spirit but with a single health

bar

yeah if you try

yeah I didn't want to do that

I guess I'll try again

look out world

generates this way too quickly

[Music]

okay

you can continue doing this

that's inspired decisively that of

course

it's working but

there's no head

so I let's see how much damage this does

a punch

there you go it worked

I did it

after using that

oh I see I'm going to battle those other

three in this area arena too I assume

and this one is going to go up

to the

which one I'm going to choose next you

didn't eat

then we break the stones

let's do the green one

into the the Crash Bandicoot work

you didn't celebration

that was the fire

now

on the 2D nature

okay they want me to do this

you see

they can be tough

back

relax three of them this is like

is it getting

yeah I didn't have any hush left so

dying might have been let's do it been a

good option with me

all right miss one

foreign

do this the second time

or if it's always three in this area and

this is actually harder

oh

since I

am

everything

fantastic

I see two doors

make up on both

two buttons exactly they're adding one

is

or I'm supposed to do this

and there's some energy but I don't need

energy

like let's do this

nothing all right

nothing

I got it

I want to fly out there anyway

okay if you don't want to open this one

Oh Come Back

yeah

Japanese China happy yeah

you jump on it it needs to be kind of

accurate

[Music]

thank you

yeah he didn't understand

foreign

I was kind of Lucky with the previous

one

no this isn't funny

this is currently the frustrating part

of the level of the game

especially this is yeah they'll be too

fast

in this way

ah it got stuck

I had been here to bed I'm sorry to fall

asleep yeah that sounds good

do you jump on that okay I did jump on

the last time Grandpa didn't seem too

much thanks for this team it has been

nice place to wind down bye friends

thank you

thank you for showing up and uh

and suggesting the rate as well

yeah

bye bye and good night

Elsa the next slide over them

doesn't help

a lot of hearts

you say

an awkward in social situations

that's me

okay

Maybe

I'm supposed to jump on them

maybe you're right about that maybe that

but I did learn that one kind of this

looks difficult to see so fast they are

fast uh I can't keep yeah apparently

have a specific I was sleeping again

if

that's me I know I like these things

let me deal with you first

guy

okay

I only want to

or animal

it could be so care about this one

okay

why didn't it attack it attacks connect

there you go

apparently this works

right here

thank you

all has seen

okay

you're not stupid

empties

here they come

oh you can jump on it

of course

but I'm hearing mistakes

silly mistakes

[Applause]

good morning

but no these aren't running buttons

luckily

where's this first girl

okay you can't stand on that

it's fine you can't jump

no not like that oh it's these branches

and species

what am I supposed to get up on the

brushes in the first place

the tricky that I walked under it that's

how badly so

this has behind this

let's take some help okay

nope

then use things to get up on it

maybe I'm stupid again missing something

rubbish

yeah I'm just sleeping this is so

serious

yeah all right there it goes okay

let me bring you there

Energies just started with that

maybe I'm stupid

it's in the back the other one

and also why does this picture stopped

me in there

all right screen I'm gonna go into the

slow motion

it seems a bit silly

I'm not sure why you're supposed to

why they have such a short time around

that's what I want to say

nothing it's supposed to

no

you did it I sure did and then I died

why don't you try shooting some magic

out of your face if you can't

stop being time is manicure

how about that

that's some skins

I want to fight these

[Music]

I don't want to but

so

oh is this all

right well this time I was just have to

land on it

was this really all that green area had

to offered

crusty green square too

that's fine

foreign

[Music]

sometimes I took damage from that

okay

and

yeah

when is when his shield breaks it's just

yeah why not Tuesday I'd better be a bit

more careful why not use the club in

that case

it seems like a good option

right

oh

my God

okay one time I'm actually supposed to

just works

he has a club so he's going to use close

range attacks if I go close

I got to use it and I'm gonna stay

damage

himself

and if you think I'm supposed to dodge

that okay

um it's not going to happen that's not

how this game

hey

I'm sure you'll get it I'll I'll Dodge

it uh one two three okay I mean it was

against

it

Dodge

yeah you're just going to do that today

it's not that wasn't even a touch

[Music]

it's okay we can try again it's not okay

this game is silly

nothing like this I can touch

that attack

but that attack

I'm supposed to dodge that one

even if it's a timing thing I should

have got to the right timing at some

point I guess I'm sure you'll get it nah

I I really don't see how I suppose about

this one

I'm so confused

that's not even a touch

button

now it's actually about this year

and then I guess that's one which I have

no idea how to touch

what's yeah yeah I guess I'll keep

trying but I'm not quite picked anything

with this

and attack him does not interrupt that

attack and again he stopped touching and

start flying instead

what's the other option is nope then the

best time

foreign

all right

[Music]

[Music]

I mean I do have the time

jackass am I supposed

I mean I can't use it to react to these

shoes

mm-hmm

no not even in slow motion can you touch

that attack

to remember my training so I

I'm not I'm not sure what I'm supposed

to do

it's something I'm missing

yeah that's like it didn't even connect

she's in Smash Bros

welcome I struggling with the earthquake

and speaking

hydrate not nothing

nothing about me

and of course hydrate

come on I'm sure you'll get it it's

getting dark in here

whoa

I don't know this is the closest I've

been to defeating this one it's okay we

can try again

thank you Sam yes

randomly

because this time he decides it

to attack this attack a lot

which is amazing

so that's why this this round is going

really terrible it is

trying to move away from there

okay I need to rotate towards left then

because that apparently went there

trying

thank you

yeah

okay

all right he lost his Club

okay

there's the uh iced tea

I should do that

I mean stupid again

[Music]

this this

that wasn't the quick attack mistake

oh it was to stop

meow meow you're back okay I got the

statue now here we go

thank you

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

come over again

I know you're not doing anything

I mean sometimes

foreign

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

if this enemy would actually learn

they will continue

to doing that tax that actually don't

get it stuck

I don't I didn't want to do that

foreign

there you go

this was actually possible

when you know how to do it then that's

stupid

whoa

see you after four Spirits has been

defeated

too much sharing

okay that was a long pass battle give me

five

that took like half an hour if it means

Maybe

okay since

okay now it has been fully shot up

I will do the ice version first so I can

get more to upgrade wait

but it's probably not going to be enough

to upgrade this Sunday or more level

more

finally

the power that's uh actually

oh of course

well

yeah yeah using

T anything anything to you

get energy doesn't seem like a smart

engine

yeah

I didn't have much health left I wish

you could like recover myself

this

a lot of this stuff

excuse me

foreign

[Music]

oh

okay let's put it here

practice it like that

oh one of three

oh no

oh this is an orange mask thing

well how much do I have four or five

lights

buyer fell into water wait there

I had to start all the way from back

here

how annoying

that one

the ice is pretty powerful

how do you see makes cute noises

no problem do you like these sounds

why not

way too hard to activate

good to be able to hear your commentary

Again by the way you couldn't hear

anything while you're riding the track

oh

well you missed

I got a fourth mask

I

don't have any

yeah this seems to be something there

oh

look make me laugh

I'm gonna take me down take me down

oh you actually actually going down

potato

we've expected

I can do this

I'm out of power

and other energy

thank you

that's all those and then it says this

one

the daily

and there you go

and now I should try to hit this thing

okay all right see now I'm getting to

hang up where I should stand

I've been able to hear since the Earth's

Elemental thing oh

oh you've been spying on me

yeah I got she's got three watches which

I assume is and

Lonnie

it's

that she was making food

bye

well all the Raiders have left

sister to

read this

who

in this place take the book I was

looking around

I'm supposed to no it's supposed to say

at some point get up there

this

third thing I should enable

you're doing great thank you

but right now I'm confused

but because they were so late for them

they went which makes sense

I'm currently just jumping around and

seeing if there's any strange platforms

you're not

why am I supposed to go anywhere

because down there I can't go into very

bright

this second opening that airport

stuff about me

I can't even land on the tree stuff

[Music]

I'm sorry I completely missed that your

last course outfit

sorry kitten I was way too focused on

the boss battle or something

I must have asked you that started but

actually

apparently

foreign

come here

you need to be over here

when you come to me

all right turn to a nice Crystal

hello it landed

Perfect Since thanks

get back to this place

yeah I don't think anything

up with the double key

this place

to this place

come on what

you are

supposed to be frozen

you are here

Can it can you please move

please

okay can I see what this does okay he

turns that light on and there's like

books in the air as well

thank you goodbye

excuse me

nice

there you go

I get that

guess not

I said wasn't worth it

okay as I said there are books up there

because I can't reach

this one is enabled

which I guess you can see

the Disney pattern on it

I guess this is as close as I can get it

um

go for a swim enemy

what what am I supposed to do

can jump onto the book again but

the book started moving absolutely as

soon as I landed them

that's us by a position it's a piece of

delay

okay I'm going wait

is this what I should shoot

no

that's enough

let me copy this one

this is the creation

apparently it was that one

without anyone

[Music]

wait that was that secret no it wasn't

secret health

it's a nice outfit I didn't know this is

why that tone yeah I said that

um

yeah it is a nice outfit

a nice sports bra and skirt so it's

going to do some exercising

it's supposed to be

okay now there we go

and here sticks okay

is it me or does it feel get shorter

shorter sorry I might be distracted

well just stand up

Ice Spirit

yeah give me full house I need to start

a pal

frog attack

there we go

[Music]

why don't you take anything

[Music]

wrong attack

wrong attack

long attack

this looks like no it was wrong attack

I can't even do the correct attach

Ed

hydrate

was redeemed

supported with the correct part of the

tradition

um

thank you

nope it was the wrong one

questions

wasn't that the correct attack

the exciting part of waiting for the

Boston is they correct all right

supposed to start it let's start a

position

there we go

okay I'm supposed to do it back like

that

there you go

yeah the eyes is a bit more powerful

since it's located plus plus ice it plus

it still hasn't died yet

that's the eyes

well at least it counts as the boss

being dead

which is the important part

yeah

that's don't fall behind

hooray yeah I could probably have done

it in like one attempt if I forget got

full healthy for about

interesting

okay you can't like this anyway one one

remaining

doing a bit over time but I got one

thing left

but I don't know how much anticipant is

that was obviously intentional

the Chevrolet country just resets your

house and Mana Magic

okay

that was mistake

why don't you try shooting some magic

out here what did you what did you just

see I did wait

what

yeah that's a painting oh

oh I see

okay

this first way like this thing

thank you

okay I'm not allowed to have the camp

why

all right this is the time

jump is so low I didn't realize it

wasn't

anime

not today's one

ah hello

and

tits I'll do that

but

that was possibly easy to pick up

oh hello

all right do something

goodbye

seriously you're not going to give it

more things like that

yes I have

to feed them they're all the way then

we go

I guess that one

there you go

that way

[Music]

yeah I think it's dead

that means that spider should show off

now and here they are

[Applause]

you now it's easy

[Music]

wow

two done

and the last one let's bring it over

there

come on

I can't wind it in that time

even damaged to pinched him

but that thing he didn't actually

probably didn't see our limits

that one is the same but

let's run away

not to run away

thank you

another one

foreign

like that yeah

everything else before postponent

wouldn't be nice

person just like just depressed because

this one feels

the shortest of them what is it girl

oh there we are

I didn't want to do that

I didn't want to do that

and then time ran out

now you keep spiders and achieve the

kids they're annoying

an annoyance isn't kids

foreign

buttons

[Music]

yeah

are you having

heavy uh screen stream delay which of

course can determine on your own by

seeing how long it takes the messages

show up on screen

all right

okay that does something

foreign

attack in electricity

experience with electricity

where are you going

no obviously yeah too far

yes work after 11 right

I went

oh well

that was the easiest of them all

so

it's past three hours now should I

continue the game later is there more

the face of malifor or something after

this or

so should I continue it next week or am

I done with the game now

you did it because you can't because

um

the last game when you were supposed to

Face of Cinder you had a whole you had

you had the whole level to go through

before you faced off Cindy

uh I mean this could have been the part

where you prepared the face of value for

whatever these things

but they never said anything they said

it in the previous game

so I'm going to assume there is more to

the game I'm obviously not going to look

it up

next week yeah since it is Friday

that will be

next week on Thursday

and then

I guess I will continue

then yeah

uh I will probably it really depends on

how much more to the game there is after

Pete

and yeah it depends on how much more

there is after this point

if it's just pricing of metaphor

in that case

I would probably be done on Thursday

other I have three hours if to complete

the game on Thursdays I might be able to

complete it on Thursday otherwise I do

have to Friday as well to do the game

but if I do complete on Thursday then

Friday will be the third key

on the PS3

so

and stuff here

yeah

that's right and in three two comments

thanks for staying thank you for coming

by thanks for watching

nice it's fine

I mean I'm making up my words it is a

nice day

know that people are actually

in some way watching this dream

and I actually want to I never I'm not

sure if I ever did that I want to read a

person called Dom Dynamite

did I trade done done right there any

time before

yeah

that was probably not enough

why did my rate go

because he must he was uh

the whole reason why I got into twitch

and streaming in the first place

wait what's happening

I used to train command yes only follow

and subscribers can chat wait did

someone change this this I think all of

a sudden

I mean everyone here everyone watching

currency are subscribers but that

shouldn't be a case why did that change

and

yes I don't know

and the message will be late

you know he knows your companies because

I got to know like

a reason why I

that was he started was because he

played Spyro with my Pom-Pom mod and

then I decided to watch history from AC

streams at midnight for me

so I can't really watch it that often

and he's a really nice and funny person

now do you love watching his dreams it's

just so hard for me to do that

so this will be fun

but

the same

foreign
