welcome

to your rabbit stampede

a classic

I hope everything is

all right welcome with him in I see you

first

I got 143 cards so far

of 200.

but I got I did write in the

hello

I did write a notification that I would

get the remaining cards but I do have to

play

first

and

yep

this one shows that there's card here

unless I did this one and already got

the card

I don't remember

no wait maybe I did this one already

there's not something I hear you but not

the game let me check that

it should be audio

but the audio is very quiet you're right

I see

the only level was uh lowered

now there's only you from the game

so I only got this car then because I

think I did that

and here we go

that's done at least I can jump up here

so when I got to this world uh

in Spyro I said that I recognized it

but no one I wonder this I got here with

a crash

okay let's do this

[Music]

all right

mm-hmm

[Music]

you need to do this to jump up

okay

[Music]

I forgot to buy

more juice today

I'm almost out of juice I like it up and

yeah this is my

the remaining

a bit of stuttering changing the outfits

there

oh

it's only three boxes well I forgot oh

it's just enough to get across

working that

is

supposed to go up there

doesn't seem

maybe I was

[Music]

hopefully not

because it was a long stash without box

test so maybe I was supposed to cut

there

okay

well

[Music]

when I'm outside by smart smart and do a

long jump over it I instead jump tonight

so it's so much for being smart

there you go that was empireing

[Music]

they're not here

[Music]

I need like a

when a hydrate is redeemed there's a

timer before you carrying it again

for some reason doesn't show up on my

wife

or nobody cannot determine if

it's a single use or

or not it doesn't it doesn't distinguish

this

but me picking out the 108 options from

the redeems that you redeem it it's a

lot of work

because I've been thinking when I when I

hydrate on my own

then I just press a button to set the

timer so it can't be redeemed

for a short one

I don't know it's just okay

yeah I guess you're not supposed to get

that there

is there an unboxes here for me too

great

yeah

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

concentration now

boom

too long

okay now

but I do highly appreciate the

the

take your time well as much time as this

build for me

I did somewhere between

a bear not beer not bad but bad

[Music]

oh

thank you for your follow

Mr austin84

you're welcome

I hope you enjoy

the Retro Gaming here

I usually don't like I shouldn't say

usually

it's not that I'm mostly playing retro

games is I'm also think of history at

two games at the moment I'm mostly going

to the um

fresh and inspired series of games

so anyway I guess I guess that

it's a lot of older games

[Music]

and I guess

I think I guess PlayStation 3 games are

old games dress your kings but

I don't know

[Music]

I wasn't doing that at least I got to do

it

[Music]

stupid scientist

s

oh talk to that to me

Evil game

There It Is Well

[Music]

celebration I bought the beer over the

weekend haven't opened it yet

[Music]

I'm no beer person or a better person

[Music]

when it firepoint can I get up here no

well I can jump

on that

bonus Christmas when I do need to smash

and crates

the strong only crates

[Music]

[Music]

dancing be

thank you

now

[Music]

mostly useless

[Music]

I hope I don't need it you know I need

to get the update

Hulk smashron says fresh smash

three four five

[Music]

no wait it's still broke

he he screams before it lands on him

that means he he knows it's coming

oh this game you can actually another

walk into one of those

[Music]

quantity

or fine

oh come on why can't I have like one

mask or something no it's purple next

fire

[Music]

continue

[Music]

okay

there we go

one two three four five

now

[Music]

wow

yeah I really don't like double jump

yeah

it's just that's amazing

I guess I guess it's saved my day

but it's doing it for me today

you must be really quick on this

kind of

I think

[Music]

[Music]

let me just complete this level okay

[Music]

thank you

just just not enough time

[Music]

I'm close but

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

yeah you're getting there

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

laughs

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

does that first box change color on each

attempt apparently

I mean

kind of always obviously hey but yes

I mean

[Music]

now we can jump on it

okay

okay nice getting stuck there

[Music]

yeah what I have to probably do is

really the double jump really messes

what happens is I could be much quicker

if it wasn't for example jump

the thing is

I need to decide if I'm going to make a

big jump or not before like as I maybe

jump watch the box I must determine that

before

I leave the ground

it's not out

[Music]

yeah and I made a mistake there

okay I just want to make sure what's in

this scene thing

[Music]

and that

is not how

the majority of cash game works

like

[Music]

I'm sorry to have a problem Oh my

[Music]

what's with my voice today

[Music]

because in a country club

and I was all my jeans

[Music]

ah

I'm never going to learn it

[Music]

I have to decide if I need to make a big

jump or a small jump

off the crate before I even

make the jump

and I threw out my

life painting crash that's not how crash

works

that's how this game works and it just

doesn't work for me it does my brain

isn't programmed to do to handle this

apparently you can't even do that anyway

that's the first question is called

crash plants yeah I don't get the point

of it it doesn't do anything

[Music]

now don't jump on it

is it I keep forgetting

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

point I know how I could speed up things

[Music]

I should probably not take the route

I really don't care how it gets me

this hitbox is too large

yeah it's something like that that she

did

[Music]

not spending too much time jumping on

the boxes when I should jump around the

boxes

there you go that's what I'm supposed to

do

and then I get stuck inside okay

[Music]

with more fine fine tuning

I can do this

now I need name and reach standpoints

[Music]

[Music]

when

it's not an easy one

[Music]

and I'm still losing my voice

[Music]

whoa

[Music]

thank you

I'm gonna say anything

and not jump too early

[Music]

hello

[Music]

there you go

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

yeah

but an answer means that

[Music]

I can't and

oh

[Music]

I mean it's worked

thank you

even though I messed it up

[Music]

technically

[Music]

oh no not this

and this is only got one difficulty

[Music]

[Music]

while inspiring game has three

difficulties

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

faux

Punjabi language

the enemies are moving really quickly

[Music]

and I was a bit tricky

[Music]

yeah let's see it's enough

that was immediately

here we go

[Music]

oh

[Music]

can I take it no

care of the scientists

now

[Music]

okay now I just sneaking up outside

yep

anyway father this would be same with a

bit quicker components

if you don't like a medium speed or

something

no I can't bounce my stance

can bounce first and then destroy the

scientists

[Music]

there we go

[Music]

I can't win let me get something to

things upstairs

[Music]

thank you

foreign

okay

look like something at their point it

kind of you can't avoid it but

[Music]

it's basically what city spine level has

but despite level just

wait

why should they crash there with the

habits

it must really crashed out in the

headaches because by 11 wasn't all

discoming

[Music]

he has to handle it

game is cheating

but I am allowed to let them go

did I did someone shoot me or something

what happened

certainly it's not the crying me to like

get 100 here

this one's machines are very tricky okay

laughs

especially when there are so many at the

same time

no I think it's chocolate yeah

it shocked me that's why then I couldn't

see it shooting it was so quick

foreign

[Music]

but not

as many as I did

[Music]

no I got shot

[Music]

I didn't have to react quickly when you

shoot

foreign

[Music]

yeah

I don't see the blue one shooting you

see yellow and red shooting

the green ones aren't shooting or

anything

[Music]

sure it's a sensitive thing

have it explodes but you are having one

of these touches

everything sorry

well I almost run into that one

[Music]

at least it's inspired I need to

completely just once

I'm doing better

One machines

goodbye

[Music]

if any

[Music]

one

[Music]

hit the pants oh yeah I need some

headbands after this

[Music]

a yellow one came I didn't trust it

foreign

[Music]

too many

so however many are let's do minus one

that's how many I'm not allowed let's

see

shots are not allowed to pass through

shoes

or at least the game is playing like

that

come on

come on WOW

I just had to shoot one more as soon as

she should join 25 the rest of them just

die

now

I could start or another one

[Music]

another one

this video

actually I think it's too way too many

but it's not a good run that

it is

delay

thank you

and there we go the rest of them that's

the haze

foreign

[Music]

boxes so

[Music]

people interested one

[Music]

did I already do this one

[Music]

okay welcome chicks that cat

you've been

coming through my childhood inspiring

crash together

yes

[Music]

um

every game

[Music]

[Music]

one two three

and

one two three

fine

oh

I'm missing everything

[Music]

a trick 11.

and I don't even know if I did this one

already

and so

[Music]

one two three four five I should save my

thumb down two three four

five

[Music]

oh

wrong side

not really no but I know now

I think I remember this one or at least

yeah that's that's

the thing I I remember

something like this

but I don't remember it was specifically

this one or not

now

um

I don't remember so many TNTs though

[Music]

since there's a question mark and not uh

and a gem sorry it's like I must have

not gotten the gym

[Music]

I think that's true that I've not gotten

the geminist

I almost missed it

oh no

[Music]

when it's a falling animation or

anything

[Music]

crash Cuts black

[Music]

there's got black pants Chris rocking

them black khakis from Walmart

so thank you for marking your joke as a

joke

I don't get it though but

nah you got purple paint

hi Candy

all right or should it be there

I get it

[Music]

no

what sometimes the extra jump is

disappears

I'm annoyed I'm annoyed when it just

appears when it shouldn't when I don't

want it to be there but sometimes the

days just no top jump just doesn't do me

double jump

[Music]

game is acting a bit weird

your heart

[Music]

[Music]

there we go

well

can I barely pick that one up

perfect

everything

hello

Carpet Fresh

[Music]

wait a minute

[Music]

but it said that that card was supposed

to be in one of the shops not just lying

on the ground

anyway time to get to that

embosso room or

was it over here

yes

[Music]

face chain someone made a mistake yeah

it's the hair

thank you for uh

[Music]

you are finishing it though and you too

cortex

oh spoiling treasure I can't believe you

all made it this far no it's like a

certain voice again no matter this is

wild dance

repetitive for the Phoenix this time I

mean it

okay

quite anything

um

he's the same boss battleless inspired

guys actually has

hit points

we need

hopefully we won't be hearing from those

two again

what if the case ever arrives he can

count on means marks the handbags great

a pretty dragon like you is a great

asset as a friend

right scratch

[Music]

there we go

exactly

[Music]

I mean it's the exact same but spiders

inspired

[Music]

but I didn't even see what happened

well at first it has some kind of Rocket

thing

boosters

and you destroy both

then it brings out the machine gun

and then after you destroy it it brings

out like two

giant arms

with three segments each

but because the game has such Jam

a long invincibility after you take

damage

you can just take damage and then you

can basically freely shoot the arms

which I did but because one of the

issues that the at the end of the arms

there you have the saw blades

and the saw blades blocks all attacks

so it can't it can't even shoot the arms

[Music]

you can't entropy

now

[Music]

I wasn't here for that one well

that was it and after you destroyed

those two it was a final kinda attack

and then it

it just flies away because it you you

destroy the ship and I just and then

leave

but for now

as you gather the remaining cards

and this is how the game works

[Music]

this is like

the stack there are

kind of like three tanks in this shop

there's a blue green and yellow card

[Music]

and as long as I win and there are thick

blue Carson is so every time I win a

blue crash card I will get a new blue

flash card until I get all view cash

cards and then they will start repeating

the worst one

[Music]

okay there we go another Blue Cross card

and that's the gem red

[Music]

every time I've been too hard

all right

another

yeah this is like a good place to stock

up on

[Music]

because you're not costed to fight the

spin

a bunch of fruit yep

[Music]

[Music]

now I got a lot of plants

more blue cards

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

for blue ones this it is the gems purple

green and blue left

but I need a green card

how much is this

okay that much okay might have been

completely wrong

[Music]

on the green but I got it they weren't

sure what it

I think it but

[Music]

as long as you win more than you spend I

see me right it's good yes

hey you never changed the sportswear I

did no I didn't what then you're right I

didn't

I didn't know

all right do let me know if I miss

after all

I'm only human no

and the worst green the worst color

[Music]

it's on the line but I got Orange

foreign

on the line again and I got blue

[Music]

I said okay

as far as we can determined by this what

we see here with the colors

that's just a picture completely

unrelated to what you actually don't get

rewarded

[Music]

so it's kinda aligned with the uh

[Music]

whether you're watching it but it's not

perfectly online so it's sometimes when

it gets to the lines wrong

can I win some cards

cards

finally

next up oh yeah good

that is Gem purple

so that's only green and blue left

humans

all right you're right

foreign

or not

who knows

come on

so close

now I couldn't spin it harder

give me the cards oh stop

[Music]

give me the cash don't give me Foods

wow I want to

please

how much is this this much

[Music]

nope a little more

oh no I lost

he lost

come on now give me

and now I actually have one big mama

okay this is like not maybe not that

much

and yes

that is

great oh you know what that means

[Music]

that means that there are two stacks

with blue cards

I have depleted one of the blue Stacks

but there is a second blue stack

swimsuit but I just changed the Xbox One

hello Grace

coming in here with my confusing

swimsuit request and you have to wait

for that one

[Music]

I make batterings and cards for crash

crash course while eating chocolate

[Music]

myself

how is life and a lot is going on at the

moment

so

what

[Music]

this one isn't even on the list

[Music]

okay

getting all the cards is going to be

tricky now

[Music]

I got a yellow one I take the yellow

[Music]

come on we have a two thousand

two thousand Olympus now

there we go a yellow one

hover back this one

[Music]

um

it's all good stuff well

ish

good is

[Music]

gem green yes that's the order stack

but I don't know which stack it is at

the moment

[Music]

I was going for

I still have one blue card left to win

you mean

game

there you go

there we go that's the last blue card

so now I only need

green anaconda can't cancel this I have

to spin

I can like yeah give me my money back I

don't want this

this is just yeah so this is uh

so and whenever blue car shows up there

that's the same as getting greens

nothing

[Music]

[Applause]

okay that can oh my

oh my

okay so if I do this now

[Music]

wait how much does it oh nothing

[Music]

um

[Music]

okay I'm trying to like figure out how

this works okay so

I have like

[Music]

a little too much

later

now

nothing else

[Music]

every time I'm trying to go for

when I tried to get the card and get

orange when I try to go for orange I get

I get the card

I guess that's

no swimsuit you have to wait for it it's

the sports for you to turn at the moment

you wait your turn

but it's clear on the green but I still

got Orange

yeah I kind of lost how

there we go

finally

copter that means I only have one yellow

card left

[Music]

[Music]

and that's the last yellow card well all

the blue and red yellow cards I got

here's the annoying part they are green

cards too

and easy thinking

foreign

[Music]

money back is just being generous to me

continue

[Music]

how did I eat anything any green cards

here

you can't even have

duplicate of cards unless there's some

no they should probably be one shopping

here

[Music]

one shop

there we go there's a giving card

finally

give it give me give me give me give me

give me

and it's cobra

the only one green card left

[Music]

and that's the same screen

today

[Music]

addiction

well it's not a gambling addiction if I

win I started with like 500 routes I

have sea thousand now

I guess it's still gambling but

I wish gambling was like this

this will be my work

[Music]

it is if you heard that you're in the

house

and that's true

next you have it entertainment rabbit

for one more shot it's a slot

but I'm oh green green Green

wait I'm gonna get to that one

foreign

[Music]

Union

stop

yes

and that was the final one whoa

um

[Music]

I got all the cards from money bags

I'm guessing stores though it doesn't

work like that

[Music]

if you can pick another problem exactly

don't worry about me

I made the very beginning of you all all

to lurk inside it

[Music]

okay this would be two shops here let's

just select two areas

foreign

where can money back why would a money

bags build his shop in this

in Dragon cousins

[Music]

let's find

it

you know what 333

fruities I assume like 9999 limits

and this proves that spider easily could

have a limit of 95 9999 but now maybe

they set it to

999

for some reason

amazing shop

running down there

I can

and I don't think this shot is down here

[Music]

three crashes here

[Music]

oh let's see I've already been here

though

get me out of here

[Music]

okay I guess that jump up like that then

foreign

[Music]

on the Welsh flag and it's it's

different looking

[Music]

oh

I'm gonna kind of looks like it not

claiming that they trace the flag

and also considering

[Music]

how does corporate and stuff apply to

next

there we go now again to look at it kind

of

nope

there you go that's my snake in it

thank you

[Music]

it shouldn't be a shop I know it should

be two shops per world except the tech

Park which only has one the only attack

Park only has one area as well

this is

crazy money bags

imagine he think of the people who wants

he wants the need to

[Music]

to see

[Music]

yeah this is also not how you run a game

there's there's no point of picking a

specific

[Music]

how am I as I mentioned

the

spin the wheel has these cars with

stacks of cards

you will always get a new card every

time and you get that stack until you're

gone through the whole stack

meaning that this

um

you will eventually

get go through everything

okay what's this

um

[Music]

that's not even at least

another one on the list

wait

um fruit

[Music]

I don't know remember somebody

ah it's my card I don't need spy card if

you only need credit cards

oh there we go

Rock I only got this one there's another

green card I guess you could see it

there should be four cards in this but

apparently I got

[Music]

this again

um

so I guess you could see again

I guess you could see that's four Stacks

or in this case five Stacks with a one

card each

not so

not the one password card this time

there we go that's the one I'm looking

for

only two more cards

finished

[Music]

okay this is that

come on

can you stop there's another car that's

ready to be here

in this possible that those cards are

here just that I got them and see all

the meats and therefore I didn't list

that they should be in here

[Music]

thank you

somebody in her in manicure funny balls

for gaming

rat

I need I need a packages

puffer fish

there we go

and finally a clear gem

on that card of atlantium Sally

crash one but there we go

plenty m

this short story is done

foreign

[Music]

heart of my body

[Music]

I can't really take off my arms

[Music]

her class will come back

but that manicures

[Music]

well I can't manicure you close again I

guess

[Music]

I wish there was some words like

and next one next area oh here we go

easy

yeah I prefer buying

[Music]

this should be cars but by Hairston

it shouldn't be cards left

I don't know another way of getting

these cards that's through this story

there should be another

you can see the height difference

between crash and money bags increasing

money back the drawn in different

perspectives as well

I guess it actually is a sad story

I guess I got everything from here

well let me see if I can find another

story then

[Music]

oh

yeah

[Music]

I'm doing it today

[Music]

oh yeah

[Music]

wow

let's get them done again since practice

[Music]

Where is the

[Music]

okay

nice test animation

be

it says that there should be a

card shuffle

[Music]

and bounce the Heat

I bounced on it you saw that right

[Music]

crash your [ __ ]

[Music]

maybe it's further here

[Music]

I don't think that

is

[Music]

hello blink e

[Music]

I've done that

weird

[Music]

thing is easy

[Music]

I'm confused

[Music]

all right

I'm so confused

[Music]

[Music]

can we

[Music]

bring according to speedrunners the

games like

because I'm playing the European version

it should be identical to the North

America version so it's not like I got

the information from the North American

version which is which is supposedly is

different that should not be the case

the only difference between the European

version or American version which

technically makes the European version

Superior

is that you can simply say crash Inspire

Fusion no that's not

is that the European version has

four translations

French German Spanish

Italian no wait

yes fresh Yama Spanish Italian

and the North America version does not

have a single translation

[Music]

which causes hch only it's people who

don't speak English in North America

[Music]

[Music]

yeah I guess there is no other story I'm

not sure when

I think it's actually and that's

actually a good thing that happened with

PlayStation 3 because the games

the games released in North America and

in Europe where I don't come languages

included

like for example

think in Legend of Spyro I had the

translations in the in the European

version

but yeah only English for the North

American version until the third game

which has all the translations and

regardless of which version you have

thank you

foreign which means that Spanish

speakers in North America had to wait

until PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and we

until they could start playing games in

Spanish and I find quite ridiculous

hello Bianca

[Music]

and I also find it kind of strange too

because

why wouldn't North American games have

Spanish and French translations

[Music]

exactly the same as the European version

since in GPM machine you can select

language and increase them and there's

the shop and I have the exact same

language selection for the nurse

when I guess I

bought every card here too

so

I will move over to the next region

because it should be another day and

guess what type of store it is

it's

Crash is dead

it's a store that contains cards

fruits and a lot of spinning

and not the count

do you like goats at least at least you

don't kill any giraffes in this game

it's been two in yes that's what I'm

trying

nope

double jump

currency you double jump

anyway back back to the topic at the end

I know a single game on PlayStation one

which had the same

like translations between the North

American European version which is a

game that I do want to play

on stream

[Music]

and I guess the difference between the

European in North America assuming it's

been adapted

we started European since it has more

lines it has high resolution and

therefore a bit more zoomed out

showing more of the world

but playing less frames per second

where is the story

[Music]

money Banks why do you have put up your

store in this crazy place like this or

is it

oh that's not the story that's the only

one

hit it

[Music]

here it's his birthday

I assume it's quite late for you good

night it was fun having you here and

also

[Music]

yeah I should switch over the swimsuit

now there you go

okay

foreign

when you go to bed

[Music]

where's the store

[Music]

come on man Max I want to give you money

[Music]

hello everybody

hey

welcome to the uh

[Music]

he's here

I guess the proper community

when we a community of Pals with pots

we both know you're not here to give

them contact money you cannot take more

of his money in gambling

all right

bad attack crash which apparently

there it is

there's one of the yellow cards there

should be at least three stacks that's

the orange card I think

I'm start I'm using him in and give me

that I know I'm taking his money now

I spent 40 hours I've gotten 78 I think

in two spins

okay let's see now that was probably too

strong

nothing perfect

Egyptian Tunes

that was the orange card yes

I don't want a spine card

I lost one fruit

thank God he

I might spank call again

and let's let's just throw in there

thingy

let's see

question is written down a blue card I

do need that

um

a little stronger I lost one fruit

and orange card and you need that

oh it is technical green but uh

money bags is sometimes nice to you like

well it's so close like you look at

Harry

[Music]

damn

[Music]

come on money Banks it was almost there

bear be kind to me

[Music]

my name is like well it is kind of hard

to see so uh yeah

[Music]

can I can I get some card

give me give me cards

[Music]

okay

like that

nope

[Music]

okay what happens when I just Spam the

button

well

[Music]

I guess it's a one way to earn oh did

you see it worked

[Music]

remote copter crash yes that was the

last yellow card I needed

so

one blue and two Orange

stop no

[Music]

[Music]

come on

[Music]

investment it works

McCain Island

but

[Music]

um

so close

that thing again is more this is more on

green but one bag is annoying sometimes

and that should be Prussian Palace

so now I just need the blue

she's working

[Music]

three times again

and even if they don't get a card if I

get the orange I get more spins to then

use on a card

[Music]

I mean I didn't have to wait for the

Blue Carter anyway

and

at least one of the four times it should

land on purple

uh in a blue cards cover I've said in

London blue

you know the Spy cards I want

this is not the spider cards I want

[Music]

oh come on

right before no no stop stop yes finally

it worked like a cool box

that means that I got every card from

that store

and now

I just have to move on to

I took a step too far for it

well

surprisingly house you're spamming the

button worked

[Music]

hmm

[Music]

and because it's big it's because you

see again

because you lose your

night did I come out with more roots or

less than I am doing

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

shops here too

deep

okay difference between

in spiral you keep the gems you picked

up in the level

and have to

and have to pay and I guess

the measure you start to get up here

there you go

is this shop over here

Orange

Mystery Shop

so in the Mystery Shop which is

this kind of shop there should be five

cards

that I'm missing and blue card is not

one of them it's a yellow and a green

there's one yellow

and that's the hobby ship

two more yellow and two green

[Music]

there's no point of selecting bugs

because I have no idea which it is which

is which

and nothing yellow and that's

thanks

how much you get 47

[Music]

15.

that's not even a crash card

they love the crash party

one yellow and two green left and a

strong color

wait did I get that

no that was act like a mask card not a

box card that's a green one

Arctic Riptide missing that one

and that's the other one hopefully

nope

SIM card and that's the one I'm using

now yep that's just pack crash so

there's only green left a green polar

bear

shop

[Music]

no color

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

there we go

that's the card I'm looking for

so now I just need the orange

[Music]

I do prefer this

because this is so much better than all

of the other ones

[Music]

glad you knew where it was I lost it

is that you there we go there's orange

[Music]

you do have a half the frames that I

have so I guess that gives me a slightly

advantage

so now it's just the last one which

probably is the the first area

I missed

streaming 30 of 360 frames

this is the Game Boy he does take the

frames

oh there is falling a nice apparently

[Music]

don't ask me to repeat what I said why

do I have to build such a complicated

way it is Guild Bank

I guess I'm the silly one it's here

he left yeah I lost track of it I looked

away where I just caught this one

I left away for a second and and I lost

track of it

come on

that's the second orange card so now I

only need the blue cards and there's

three of them the next one

as you can see I haven't seen I've seen

a lot of them yet

[Music]

and I might have played like this

Shuffle before because I think I went to

like every store

and made some some of the games so

so when I get cars that I'm I didn't

think was part of the story

that must be a car that I won before

I didn't look up where to find that part

because I only got if that makes sense

it's a blue card but it's not a crash

current

so um yeah there we go that's a cash

card

which is blue

that's the one

two more

yes there's another blue card

two more and the last two cars of the

home game

[Music]

I got the credit card how many of those

same time

now they want one to be fruits and one

bouncy crates no wrong ones

Kimmy only two cards left

[Music]

to courage left I looked away

well I take this one the worst

I am here

come on

I'm bouncing anything in

oh bounce secrete

hmm crying head Pat laughs

oh I lost track of it

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

come on

[Music]

next follow

he's not a blue crash card so let's

imagine

I tried to go for fruits but I think

stuff to access

[Music]

come on come on I only have

few currents left an iron spring box and

a Time

right

the guide apparently spent the time

create

[Music]

is it going wrong it has been great

about every other card so far

a good way weird is if it's wrong about

these two

hey what the hell if uh crash course

[Music]

doesn't matter

ah an orange yellow I think

[Music]

there we go

come on now

um bouncy green come on like am I wrong

[Music]

there we go another try

[Music]

but it is not incorrect it's just just

refused to give me that we've got for

some reason I finally got it

one more I already got that one

the time crate

time create is left

maybe maybe because I haven't gotten

cars I don't know how they have written

it

it is possible that the card is actually

called timing 38

because I guess in some way

I just pressed

[Music]

because

it's two losses and like one through the

two empty boxes

[Music]

here we go

come out now

come on now

[Music]

um

that was a Ticky one

for nothing

oh there we go again

[Music]

ding ding

dude

[Music]

I got everything

everything single crash card I don't

have any spy card but that's that will

be the sparking

[Music]

was awesome

[Music]

well I did say yeah

well I've been swimming for two and a

half hours now

uh so I guess I'll spend the tomorrow as

playing the spiral game even though it

technically be crunchy and so I will do

this spider game because it's kind of

like the crossover and then I will start

on a new spawn game

which is the spider Adventure which I

said I was going to start on last week

and then I'll start that on Thursday

Friday

so

[Music]

I think that sounds like a good idea

doesn't it

[Music]

and then I will

and when I started on aspiring game

tomorrow I will have copied over the

crash game Crash Course respire Fire

game at that point

[Music]

I like it so

[Music]

bad figure and visit one of

a good old friend who has a very few uh

watches and Mommy has he has three

watches so I think we could bring a

party over to him and hopefully it works

this time it'll work last time so

[Music]

pink on the side east actually is in the

history now

he started he just started I just

started streaming too this is perfect

moment to do a read

so

he is known was

archives he's doing his uh intro at the

moment

so I'll prepare the rate

and here is my stuff

patience that's no one is donating to

that moment who is the first one Hindi

no

it's not doing pink in this course area

where uh you can always get in contact

with me

and then there is also the YouTube

channel which I eventually will then

upload something too I'm I I will

eventually make another video which I do

put alerts on the Discord if you want

that you can join there

so

that's about it I don't know what else

to say let's

yes

I usually do this if you subscribe you

can use it otherwise you can use

whatever you want you can always pay

for 100 points any of the emotes I have

which are not animated or service and

then you can use those if you want

otherwise you're free to post whatever

you want any other rate related or

sharing related or that one that's a

cute one you can do that one if you want

it doesn't need the video
