hello everyone the pictures still

haven't shown up for some

reason I've been Ling we're playing ter

yeah okay let's see if this works yeah

there we go hopefully the volume is

good it's a game featuring a

bunny excitement there we go excitement

builds from Nana on

sh anyone recognizing

[Music]

game

[Music]

bunny wait why isn't

the

forw refund the sports first you can

reuse

them there you go Panda got a

sorry yeah very short M

anyway how to play hey

girl this is a game featuring a bunny

from Japan she speaks Japanese but it

has

subtitles this is how the game

[Music]

[Music]

works

[Music]

[Music]

the

[Music]

Frog for about game play should be

[Music]

easy the B allow to get

something

you should remember

the S

[Music]

here this R for

[Music]

Loop

for

basic the

game it's

[Music]

um and then R turns seem to have lot of

quickly

lines a lot of people today

yeah so in this game you can as as as

she said you the shapes are generated

based on the music you

play so you can play with your own music

obviously that wouldn't be

possible for well legal reasons but the

game does contain its own

tracks three tacks it's very short game

if you don't

play with your own

music well does it remind you of the

button at least that looks difficult

we'll see we'll see oh

wait should

we I should have done that I just

remember

[Music]

easyuse me excuse

me and I had the idea because people

like the

idea like

um I don't know I I was supposed

to do this

uh bad I forgot what it sorry about

it okay it's starting

to this this stream is very

unorganized

that's but that's typical of amn't

it there we go there we

go I'll be heading to school okay I have

music CS from high school concert be fun

to play

that there we

go now you can

predict starting off

easy the game doesn't show the

scord and I

assume

the music also

[Music]

Japanese and I when I hope I actually

check the uh source for the

[Music]

music and

then rabbit to our

[Music]

Queen

[Music]

slowly

I don't let's see if I can do this

perfectly oops that was too early that

was so much for

per now I'm

[Music]

yes I don't know if the music is origin

for this game or

not I thought that time that

properly appar

generated or if they have

oops specially designed for this

mus hurting the

[Music]

rabbit consider the shapes stuff seems

to not be optimized for

[Music]

song the animation

[Music]

plays

[Music]

time

[Music]

LD there a very

simple

[Music]

graphics

P should have an outfit being based on

this

rabbit yeah the game doesn't have any

end and ster and even if I were to play

play any other song I don't really have

any well any way for the game to read

it it would be interesting to try out I

could do that as some point prepare in

advance when I don't really have any

other game to

play uh where

I take songs from other games and and

try

those like ISP songs or something like

that that that could be an an

idea

if if that sounds interesting
