welcome

okay

um

as usual when I'm playing this game for

some reason I don't know why the but I

only had the issue when playing this

game the kind the capture card starts uh

displaying their own colors

I think it has something to do with it's

being

it must have something to do with being

HDs it pro has to process more more

information

but the red Channel

and this is

don't know why it can show the picture

fine you just did before I started and

then all of a suddenly the red challenge

is

I don't know why

and

losing hope

Channel

attached us

stay connected

some audience

and since the red challenge is for well

red colors such as the health bar and I

kind of needed to see how much health

they have thank you

oh

for me the picture is fine though

yeah so

what was I didn't say two of eight so

spiders Mission currently is to light up

all these they're all these big land on

my side

in this dream this is my headphone being

set to hide

since I have the headphones plugged

straight into the

basically capture card

your own volume enough and now the

after playing so many PlayStation 2

games of spider

it's quite a graphical upgrade

even though it's more like a PlayStation

2 game in HD and some

more high quality effects like the grass

because the textures are terrible and

the models doesn't look to me

I would have to go through phase one

really for a long time I guess the fear

is a matching Facebook

thank you

and one of the colored Sanders is by the

name but I guess it adds to the news

foreign

[Applause]

okay I'm getting quite annoyed by this

is the college because it's very hard to

see what's going on

and I said I have no idea why it's

why specifically it happens when I play

this game of art games

I say she was being positive

HD and it is

and him out yes it does finally been

appreciate it I'll say let's go beat our

boss it's face

yeah I've beaten this bus twice now it's

[Music]

all right

[Applause]

I'll see it's fine

there's actually five is the purple

plasma scene

how hot is fire when it turns purple is

it hotter than Orange

blue fire is hot and red fire

[Applause]

fantastic press the correct buttons

[Applause]

why don't you like the correct buttons

for these cut skills

they'll

fish

nice subtitles

[Music]

yeah apparently let me defeated three

times now

just hang on

sequence

Inspire is fighting with [ __ ] time

let's see

if that's the same

[Music]

well third time the charm

went for a voice by Mark Hamill by the

way I don't know who that is I think

I've heard the name before maybe it was

maybe I've heard Mark Campbell when

someone said it was man ignoring me

maybe

I'm so sorry

it's over sorry for what I've been

defeated

my camera is Luke Skywalker

I haven't watched Star Wars

I know what I need to do

just get out of here Cinder Spyro no you

don't have to do anything let's just go

where Cinder there'll be nothing left

the world is breaking apart but I think

I can stop it

I think I meant to

then I'm with you

I love you

[Music]

and it's okay

so

what kind of Supernatural Powers is by

your hand

s every time

[Music]

I imagine you need to get scenes

[Music]

and the stairs of the king that was

great

floating islands

okay

that Securities is

yeah let's play Legends of spider for

tears of kingdom

[Music]

evil and destroys the world

well okay now it's the music this part

is going to get muted

unless I'm speaking of everything

foreign

[Music]

cable when you connect it

which would explain this single frame

disconnect

[Music]

I want

to see

yes of course of course

[Music]

this song is okay for my experience yeah

you know

[Music]

wow

I don't know

I haven't really concentrating on these

songs from

Legends of spider

keep blocking them

in the world

so

I went

and this song is okay beautiful song

wait wait what it's a beautiful girl

beautiful series

um

nice

okay it was

dad's name with me backwards curvature

awesome

and anyway anyway

[Music]

so

[Music]

um

at the same people who made the other

songs

[Music]

in the morning

I meant okay yes

but you said this song is okay

[Music]

it waffles me

so what else I was going to say

this is

was interesting because it was something

different and I wanted to every spot

again we're done as hell but boring it

is I did feel like the series became a

big tiring course then

but I do like that the

even though the bus button was basically

more of the same fighting it actually

encouraged more touching which actually

made it more interesting

and then while

[Music]

oh yeah

it's fine

[Music]

sometimes my message can be confusing me

benefits like the fighting what's worse

in the desert game

and it didn't feel like uh because I did

feel like Steve writing had more impact

than the previous two games and it felt

like it could basically start unlock

enemies yeah and also see their house

which was the most important factor

no idea what they're doing that

why

even though they could just put it at

the bottom right like it was health

so

[Music]

what's the uh

was the voice cast for the other

languages

they all have the

people managing the sales

[Music]

specialty tank the Saints

47 communication that's a real name

thank you all of the Spotify to have

helped to support their favorite purple

dying for the last 10 years we could not

have done this without your continued

encouragement

and a very special thanks to all of our

families and friends for your loving

support

we never would have made it without you

oh nothing

say again first

I heard something

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

I have long been expecting you

a new age is beginning

with each new age a worthy dragon is

chosen to Chronicle the many triumphs

and failures of that age

this has been my duty for many millennia

and now

ignite us I pass this honor to you and

put a spider

you see

that is the question isn't it

you see each time a dragon dies

a new page is written in this book

I've done my best

but I can't seem to find any trace of

Spira

[Music]

well young dragon

where might you be

foreign

actually died because if they would say

and because they said that's why I

didn't die but if they had spider die at

the end

that that would that would that would

have been something

special

way done we've done the decision

so for tomorrow

the cell plot Miami still wanted to do

well a fourth game was planned foreign

[Music]

that would have been brave

[Music]

sir yes yes I will I would play Enter

the dragonfly

and tomorrow then I guess I tried to

play it before but it was things so

awful some hotels Legend inspiring today

let's say now since I found a message to

make the game work which I had to do

with the second Legend of Spyro

and after dog's life

so at least that method and that should

hopefully make Andrew dying flying

work

working at full speed

[Music]

whatever I feel like

the first game

kinda was uh its own game you could play

it and don't need any sequels you still

have this thing about the dark master

but

the next one but

um

but then they said and then the second

game

and that that one felt incomplete

uh with the

[Music]

uh with how they became encased in the

end and how they all gone off

foreign

foreign maybe there is a way of

modifying it is like

because you have these cheat codes or

emulators when you inject code into

memory

from one day

if there's such a thing

I don't think there's an easy way for me

to do that

[Applause]

that's a lot

we inspired

oh

[Music]

if I send a lot more pictures than I

expected

all the stuff I've seen is breaking

speed in the past few years for Speed

runs

guys Team Speed transparency clothing

actions

somehow I feel like that

was that it sure right here painting

yeah it's paintings something I don't

know it was well made apparently like

this is like in the amount of vegans

first didn't pay attention and like what

was that effort

reference filter now I just summoned

with a lot of it and everyone

one of the artworks

generic post spiral

you're gonna eat it

yes it is

[Applause]

with four crystals that oh it's where I

started

basic and I basically cleared out the

Twilight funnels

characters in scenes are scary yeah okay

it's coming yeah and I yeah I mean it

makes sense

that's what I just

the basic

missed two armors

um

I went

right I mean

you won't be able to save your progress

probably available

same at the end of the level the screen

with some of your programs

so anyway

um

yeah this my my stream is scheduled for

three hours and it's only been one and a

half hours so far

so

I would even in the darkest of time

yes

it is not me

so

um

what

[Music]

what's that

[Applause]

peaches

there

I might still wear

ing

[Music]

I don't know

I hate this this one had some money

missing

we have to break this thing it's holding

us down

let's see

let's just see if I can find

I'm 30.

Summit this chain is slowing us down we

can't fight it we'll have to move a new

okay

my jammies

so where can

okay

now we are done

thank you

so yeah I might want to do antide

you know I was earlier

yeah

okay should I have to inspire

this is after this one

shooting

Cindy shouldn't have this as she is in

the purple dragon's body is using magic

so she is

but if Cinder isn't a purple dragon why

is she purple

maybe she's a purple dragon and people

is annoyed it

okay she's like no she isn't she's

purple

she

was black in the original game but as

the games goes on she's become way more

purple

the sign show is yeah but if she's

getting closer to be a black dragon on

the purple dragon don't make a purple

make her black I mean

foreign

obviously she's supposed to be purple ah

oh can we eat a controversial opinions

here

um

definitely for me

safer for me I mean quiet you'll give us

away excuse me

he's even stated that she's super

applying and where I know she's been

said to be a black dragon she was I

think they call it black dragon in the

first to second game they actually

called her black dragon

the reason I want to remember they said

it in the second game

no there's enough cutscene

oh

they get eaten

okay

well well in that case

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

what's this at save point but what

happens is I use the same point even

though I wasn't allowed to me

but then you know what their game said

the game is weird he reminds me of a

Dark Souls ah

like

I was instantly saved by actually the

same thing

why aren't they like removed my hair is

still there

okay

this is an uncut scene I want to escape

this

yes thank you

problems be careful

[Music]

problems don't let them surround you

yeah

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

even like you have 500

116.

maybe a large corrupted Farm but the

reason her egg was done and was because

she was purple

the intentions they'll be diagnosed

because

[Music]

[Music]

it was that windy Dragon before

corruption

and then she became as versatile as

Spider

versatile

and then she became better and inspired

these Vines block our path we must get

through

and change Hunter

Chinese

all right

[Music]

this thing

and this would have been a bluish color

but then she got corrupted and

became prep

aration segment is basically Aspire you

don't play us in there

twice activity

and then the imagination attacked

and this yeah yes

foreign

there's a light up there we must be

getting close

here this way this leads to the surface

all right what's this part I got to make

can't change that

this is one of the weird places where

you can't really move really

hey Mark is on my shoulders back in

hands where I added steering Corruptions

I want to be correctly

I was actually thinking about having

like

evil Pom-Pom

with black fur and red eyes

so basically the clothes that pumpkin is

wearing is just separate separately

things on top of me

foreign

thank you

and I guess

I guess punt Punk could have some

markings

so there's basically a red a green era

secret boss even

somewhere

I can add like because it yeah I wanted

it to be like

I should also role play as like an emo

as well

and I could add that to the wheel okay

I don't know how long it would last for

like even things away

that's one

that's another one I found

I don't see any colors big colored gems

I'm sorry

[Music]

changed things

I mean I'm not really naughty I don't

think an evil pumpkin but there's much

more naughty

[Music]

pictures

what's the lower behind the evening

[Music]

okay

[Music]

okay and then I'll jump

[Applause]

and I can't see

anything that's that way

I didn't mean to do that but I guess I

guess it's part

it said something

there's probably some secrets

because I think it said something about

in this area

oh see

it's good seem to go back I found this I

felt like something about something cool

I mean the level destroyed episode

[Music]

what investor

[Music]

and then I

didn't come strongly

[Music]

and did I come from where did I go

maybe it wasn't anything by going back

I had to test

now if I can start

let's change this thing

it does something

she is a wing

it has to take case

okay all right

I guess there was no must then

I didn't find another pretty one at

least

thank you

backwards

[Music]

[Music]

maybe it was

I don't know it is

[Music]

we are close to the surface it's best we

remain unheard alright big cheetah man I

get the message

the horn

must be part of some sort of locking

mechanism honestly why not just the lock

and key like normal folks

where is that here

with even pump on being what

knock knock

does that mean something

and you got half an hour and that

swimsuit hey

this would basically the same outfit

because she doesn't have an evil

version

[Music]

oh

[Music]

and it stops it and then yeah

[Music]

I got these

okay and I knocked up and mine was like

no no

yeah that's because we say when he went

emo come from here no no not the even

pump them

[Music]

Spyro hurry up and open this door spider

can't do it

same vacancy

this is wasting a lot

[Music]

very fine

yes foreign

[Music]

so yeah I have no idea what those things

are

waiting gallery

it's something

yeah I think

do you have to foreign

[Music]

with they look fine but ignite is just

looks so goofy in the game

and and then inside

if I'm with Hunter Street design

thank you

[Music]

it works it's a good enough I think and

for like Legends of spiders

[Music]

oh a squirrel goat

it's consider parts that there is ideas

here too

yeah where's the

I love this

is that

green dragon

what is that one left but

enemies they required at the pantry

well it's

I don't think I have much to add to the

remainder of the Stream

so

if this cell how about

the I guess talking about streaming

because

and the idea I have is that the

I want to wish I might post it on the

server I do want to do the channel

string

I just want everything about the same

thing

yay celebration isn't it a cute one I'm

happy with how it turned out

so so

exactly singing if you want to hear me

embarrass myself

if you have ideas or songs that you want

me to sing

and because I would and also just give

me ideas in general for songs I should

consider but if there's a song you

really want me to do

let me know as well

and

so I will consider actually

and

because I obviously can't think

everything suggesting and I might not be

interested in every suggesting but if

you really want me to do it I could

I guess

if it makes

then sign up and

or something I I don't know I don't

exactly know how I should do

your thing

I'm going to use a software that shows

me the pictures and everything second

base basically I Karaoke Softly

and she has been deleted everything so I

can follow along so it won't be as

terrible

I guess

so well and tomorrow I will do enter the

dragonfly I do want to stream two hours

earlier

and what happened to Twitch

[Music]

and

it's using the company completely wrong

some names we just need the same

thumbnails for two different streamers

and the streamer in the pictures is

neither

it's a what

[Music]

if I open the steam it's obviously not

it's not even in sync

[Music]

anyway

[Music]

I don't think I have more to add and

feel free to join the

I think you all are on the Discord so

I should try to remember

and people know that I do have a Discord

if you wanted to talk to me more

and

short story I know I know

that's what happens when I finish the

game some steam head should be fat

I did an extra stream that was two hours

yesterday

and then we did two days before that I

did like a six hour and eight hour

Stream So I think I've

I could do that share it to our stream

today

I think that's fine

and I don't have anything more to

do in the game other than like 100 years

but

I gave that to one level another try but

I wasn't able to find this there and I

don't think it's going to be too

exciting

foreign

[Music]

at the moment

I don't even know who that stream is but

the Jazz Cat who has made it before

he's playing Elden ring

and he is

a nice person

I don't know

is playing Elden

ring let's chair on with the pump on

cheering

um emotes if you are a subscriber if you

are not a subscriber

well

you can always unlock one of the other

emotes of pumpkin if you want you can

have yeah you can unlock the hype email

address for the

when someone wins

because 100 points to pick one you want

to unlock and you can use it on all

channels on Twitch for 24 hours it's a

good drill today

you get to even for you subscribers who

are not subscribed to other channels who

has an mlt1 emote MLT emotion but that

requires them to actually have the

unboxing mods

enabled for you to be able to do that

that's why I have it enabled
