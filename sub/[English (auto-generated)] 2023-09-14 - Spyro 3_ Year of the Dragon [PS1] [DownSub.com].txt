hello my bad things

and I myself focused on stuff then I

completely forgot

here we go

another distance here though

[Music]

um

load game

or is it

so I

cooked myself some

me yesterday

[Music]

there we go

and then I can't try to

detailing View

experience again

this doesn't work I think that works

[Music]

I guess that makes me sharper so I got

some cookies I just need to get home

[Music]

there we go pick up my cookie

[Music]

second

mention that

I hope it doesn't

disrupt this stream so

this game I had like a reign of the

Trinity and I don't know if I'm

discovering

it has skill points there we go so I got

two skill points in some Sunny Villa but

because skin points are the same as in

reignited I have Canon the idea of what

these skill points are

foreign

[Music]

there you go I have

[Music]

I'm making such a message I should have

I should have arranged this is better

but I guess that's just me

[Music]

okay

back back to me now that I'm done

now

sorry about my distraction that's you

sure how I am

that's just here I am

so wait as I said it was burnt old jeans

let's do that

there's a flower here

yeah yeah

transplants playing the flower you're

about to play me too

so

okay there's a truth let's see it's kind

of bright on the distance but I mean

it's dark when you get close I assume

the

when you're far away

but as you approaches you since

[Music]

there it is

then when you get closer it's using

picture

they might have had a lighter texture

before

you can jump up like this

at the end again

I just can't stop

Boop hello and hello

say hello to you when you posted that

message so I hope the um oh yeah yeah I

realized that when I

[Music]

went back and checked the

the rods

that my

God the games are kinda loud

so there's no stream there

[Music]

wait a minute

[Music]

Easter tree

it's 420 penny

I can't say

see you can't say that word it's it's

too weird of a word for free

I guess I think kangaroo

I guess it's just one of those words I

just don't say out loud

but welcome

oh sorry about that

yeah going around and burning trees

that's

what I'm doing at the moment

that's what I've been asked by the game

today

because that's apparently a skinny

but no it should be one of those three

skate area

I mean that as I approach the skate area

should get it

foreign

yeah here it is

skill points

some some little lives left I got one

game over and here I'm going through a

course record

you could go for the course record now

if you want yeah

wait did they say you can go

yeah he says score as many points as you

can until the time expires of your

wipeouts that is not how this works we

have to change that

anyway let me video

whenever you hop on a skateboard timer

will start score as many points as you

can until the timer expires or you wipe

out good luck

all right can I just

cut it after

the time experience what are they

whatever

I'm not the developer of this game

hey pun pun all right see me

I'm here for attacking

yeah

thank you it's um temporary

she for reasons

yeah how are you it's um

it's been tough but I I feel bad it's

not perfect but I'm

it is better now than before at least

definitely better than other than before

burning trees yeah they're not allowed

to have trees here

shark

with a human wait is the person eating

is that one of the uh

weird

weird

things which I try to press the charge

button to go quick game but that's not

how speed Point works

pretty sharing well

can I no I can't do my screen let's do

one more

UPS

all right wiping out these are fine I

think this coursework is seven thousand

okay I can't remember that let's do that

again

[Music]

Thomas okay

[Music]

don't get anyone doing this how am I

supposed to get seven thousand it wasn't

really simple because if you don't get

to see how much much points you need

when I start here there we go that's the

I did

it was three thousand I guess when I got

the skill points so

foreign

no it wasn't five thousand

[Music]

let's see I got the

healing point and don't need to continue

with

continue anyway

don't stress the game

anyway you know what is this doesn't

hear an emergency weird number

no problem

[Music]

it's been it's been fine

wait

already so now I have unlocked the

episode I actually don't need to do the

rest so you want to get like half of

these

I think I should still do this like

melting cranky

uh oh there it is I can't read

apparently

Yeah you're late today yeah all right so

that's so very late

because yeah in the mountain Creator

there's the

this thing in in Sergeant bird I

completely forgot that there was a skill

point when I was doing that

because I knew it was a scene but I

couldn't remember

yeah I have a long stream last night

from 77 from

[Music]

seven in the morning

some instance EP

understandable

well I don't know

because I can't remember you take soon

no I didn't meant to pick it up

[Music]

okay

dying here

okay

no that's not something that's right

no now I need to because I need to get

every single hand again it's a little

bit better to do this immediately but

tabletop similar they can take

it so oh my my voice today

I think I need hybrid

two hours let's go

yeah as long as was of mine was 11 and a

half

and that was pretty early in my

streaming

so it probably easier for me to do it

now but

then I'm not

[Music]

where's the last one

[Music]

[Music]

yeah

on the date I wrote on the on the server

there

[Music]

again

well

[Music]

weed

think easy easy

I speak and wait didn't I do that

maybe maybe I didn't

because in ICP

ICP

there's that sixth pedestal

this was Landon I said I landed on it

never landed on it

so I guess I'll go there and

11 complete but but the skill point

yeah I was at the end of the feet

oh

I Can Only Imagine

is when I did it that was

I didn't I did take a break during it

though

but yeah I was very tired at the end of

it

so there it is

even therefore got

removed I got moved to

get a point

easy easy

foreign

hmm

I think one month of I worked 40 hours a

week and since 30 hours a week which is

basically working and

and that's

how many hours is there in a week how

many hours did you sleep in that week

dude

I've been dead

tried a few times before and I just

spent 31 hours a drive from Florence

Texas without any sleep

yeah you know what it's the uh

the yeti boxing thing yeah they took my

ball I told him to give it back or you'd

kick his right okay you see it uh

you're supposed to

get around one so he's supposed to

defeat him in two rounds

how am I supposed to do that with these

terrible controls

come on I'm going to defeat it into in

one round

hey

oh

my arms a day than students

it's such a delay when you press the

buttons it does anyway that went

straight to his head he was cheating

all right

it doesn't even reach

and it just takes

he doesn't do it he just stands there

are no

look it is going to be

this is going to be hard

I don't have any technique here thank

you

and now how this game works

like

he misses so much

[Music]

okay

apparently

that's right

yes the first one

[Music]

you have to defeated

and two rounds yeah

the last time I did it in three runs

when I should have done it in two

okay so now we can defend against that

we're still getting murdered here

[Music]

okay it worked a bit at least thicker

did I hit them one

okay it's not going that well

yes but only one of these counts

otherwise they want PS3 points

okay

I'm going to

strife and Heat

yeah

not feeling that one at the moment

you go

straight

away

okay so if I go for that he defends

against it

sometimes

that doesn't reach never go for the

other attack because you have three

effects

and he hits me instead

oh

that didn't work

when

yeah

I got them in the run too I said

I was wondering

[Music]

isn't doing anything

maybe I should do this maybe the

computer is getting easier

[Music]

I mean I didn't do it in two rounds

okay one more try

definitely start hitting the same time

but completely

like whatever like made some stuff like

me since

I I can only hit

but he defends against it

foreign

yeah that was terrible

only two more rounds to go yeah I'm

gonna see where he's just going so

terrible at the moment

why did what did I did different last

time I played this that made it so easy

how is it

that makes no sense

he is this perfect game buggy or

something

this is the last round finish him off

this is not this is this doesn't make

this this makes no sense at all

yeah finally you gotta hitting

wait what what happened he probably yeah

the game is buggy

which makes it funny when people point

out the bugs in the united as if the

Hillary doesn't have a leadership

I have so many weird stuff going on

during the Stream

but I guess that

advice

thanks

yeah I wish I could beat down here and I

fart so quickly although I'm not doing

anything we're attacking

okay

so it's quick it is there

my attack there's so little damage

okay

guys

[Music]

okay

come on

two more rounds together

this time he does get healed but

huh

now his name is

okay let's quickly came back

there we go finally

kill point

why did you make that exit now I'm

embarrassed

[Music]

[Music]

fireworks Factory

um what was that

what is the firework

oops I didn't mean to cleansing

now I'm confused

was there a skill point here

and what's the um

okay so um

wait because it's

for some reason

the game should be embarrassed not you

I mean

when I can say you're wrong

okay so this should be but how do you

hi

[Music]

that's how you look around

[Music]

Okay so

I never looked up but this [ __ ]

open the turkey

apparently

they are plenty is the same day

[Music]

but of course I didn't even know how

student cut before but apparently

there's an option to take it

okay can you stop coming and so I can

concentrate on things

whatever you're not disturbing me

okay

this certainly makes sense here

but I only got the skin Point soon

funny

cute

oh

I'm rich yeah yeah in charm Bridge there

is The Impossible Time Racing uh since I

confirmed that it should be the same

so I mentioned in my previous pleasure

that

is that it reignited there's a skin

point but apparently this should also

subscribe to this game

so what I I wish I had an easy way to

just uh I'm good my friend

to just play a twitch clip on stream

but there's no malcoming way of doing it

not in my current setup at least

I want to set it up in some way that I

can do it

on the enemies

I look at it like thing it's like a

snake

[Music]

there's a Tomb Raider remastered oh

is it is it the original game but

being made from Veranda with with nice

graphics

is an option for pointy

[Music]

so it's that Tower maybe it's easy to go

from

see there was a nice

conditions

one different depending weight really

actually look into that

yeah I don't have a switch there

so one day

wait what did I picked up this again

uh I was the only good supposed to see

if I can jump from

this thing instead

I think if you say definitely is so much

more manageable

yeah here we go

again point

skill upon

oh I barely got anything here

well

is uh

and see I still

I still know some of these skill points

there

there's a dreams dynamines in 89 in the

lab oh no not in the nine snap let me

guess it is nightlab is blowing up only

and this is ruins

but it could be in this level

another company said that there is a

remaster on the switch

seems like something you should have

known about like you're you're the Tomb

Raider guy you should you didn't know

about every single

right there

that Tomb Raider release days

all right I got sniped

yeah sweet

I need the switch now

when sounds like an Investments

let's go to the bonus area because

apparently

that's why they put all this stuff

I remember inspire 2.

um

there is a thing where you should

destroy only seaweed

they have put seaweed here too

yes so can I just learn your

manta ray so I can

erase these seaweeds yes you can destroy

the seaweed

so

wait how are they still hit an enemy

that wasn't my intention

sorry about that enemy

let's destroy some invention again

because otherwise they might shoot me

I mean

okay yeah

seaweed

weeds of the sea

last one

now feels like a spun around this area

where is my weed

no there's one high level from last one

no there's one another one behind me

this must be the last one

no

um

and this one behind my peaceful now this

was the last one yes there you go

that's like three last ones I have a

switch oh well I was bragging

meat

next I had Dino mines

I might get my hands on a switch when

they

know exactly what it is two kids points

though but I know exactly what one of

three points is

what's that scene I kept filming it

and I said these skill points are in

bonus areas or x-rays whatever

because there is a red Dino in here

that kept missing

a

there's flashing eyes he doesn't have

squishy eyes or

shrinky eyes or screen their eyes

yes flashing lights

down

I hope it's easy to hear me and I I know

that in the on on the Monday stream it's

about it's not very hard to hear what I

was saying but

maybe maybe that was for fair reason but

I felt like on Tuesdays was also hard to

hear what I'm saying

man was just that zombies land

one another one

[Music]

but of course my priority is a little

more powerful

Beauty

so I can play Crash 4 without delaying a

little bit much for me because

you know how bad it runs on the first

level is going to I mean it's it came

different smooth but it was barely did

that

there are later levels that will require

more performance and uh

and it's going to be horrible to play

the game and I don't want to play like

half the game and then take a break and

so I'd rather have a more powerful

computer first

there's this finally I got it

thing I don't think you're done here

oh it's I do have the other one

makes it

yeah yeah

well

not fully hearable

well I'll take it

keeps switch to Penny what

one of the dinosaurs threw an egg down

that's flooded you would give a switch

to Benny

wait wait it is

okay so point in the other in the first

water tunnel you're supposed to defeat

All Enemies otherwise you don't get the

egg here is optional but certainly

they're getting all the enemies must

certainly be asking about it it's almost

like I know it's just complete

I can hear you just fine that's

that's good

I'll take just wait it was underage come

on it's really this is

your voice is cute

it does make it bad I like it I like to

be kids it really means a lot to me

I really don't mind me weird noises I

make some sense I don't have sequence

sometimes I don't have something to say

and I just want to say something

I'm really mad at this

when he succeeding it well

I'm thinking

there we go finally

attempts

then I need to hit the next one wow

oh there was one there okay but where's

the next one

okay in the next one is here so it's

only four of them

well that's good I got cereal for you

that was some

wait there was no ink there you can't

you can't skip that part I guess it is

the part that that part is when it's

loaning the Dragon

but if I'm skipping it

I I don't even want to see the dragon I

don't want to see the train

no it's already

at the level is already wait

the enemies are gone

every enemy

does that mean that the single Empire

mist is also gone and I have to leave

the area and come back

I mean if there's no only the final

enemy

oh my

if the final item is still here and I

can hit it and get skill points I'll

take it but

if the enemy isn't here I have to leave

and come back and

worst case leave the level and come back

there we go come on

okay it's gone

anime is still there hopefully I can get

this skill point by getting that way

wish me luck

hopefully the game works like this

that doesn't make it easier though

in this corner

come on

and the tunnel is so much the same

overnight

it's definitely too easy to take those

TNT and but then this the thumbnail so

it's

the same thing over and over again so

repetitive so it's kind of hard to know

where I am in town

can you see my voice today

oh come on

frames are back what oh it says I'm

losing frames again

is this gonna be a really struggling

around in this game

yeah definitely need a computer second

stream

this computer seems to be kicking up at

this point

okay it's around this corner

that's all right I was talking to you

know since right now yeah I don't know

what's going on my soft frame drops but

I don't know now it says it says this

now it's dropping again

okay it's it it keeps it keeps doing

that

it dropped it it's it's just that it was

it happened again

I don't understand since you changed

Live free with minus seven minutes yeah

I guess that makes sense but it happened

now when the children have

but yeah so yeah when it's the computer

content loading and streaming at the

same time

okay

ah you're so close

oh look the game is banging again

the game is full of bugs

okay let's see around this corner

around the pan there you go that's the

skill point

scan point that was nice that was pretty

skilled wasn't it

so now I only have the agent line

oh my

one is interactable thing I know here is

the

pineapple palm palm trees

they have

what was that

Anonymous

assistant skeleton yes I I made a joke

before

wait

can you do it in this game

nope

it's nothing in

that's the thing in reignited

foreign

[Music]

a lot of

laser shot so fancy

oh this one can survive or not

wait what happens if I shoot it back

[Music]

gonna make it okay can I make it

straight

[Music]

oh

surprise they eat this after it's till

it's enough because I definitely should

shut this one way too much

see it's not that he's shooting it that

breaks it is because it's bending

templates but we have a raid the wall

all right welcome ladies

and what hello

is surely mean

and playing PlayStation one game

and with the shooting

when the third person shooting is

nothing

so what team

okay so what did you do

wall racks there we go that's how you

spell your name

playing Star field oh yeah I heard about

that thing

Oh no I got shot

but I don't know anything about it

when's spaceships

wow already didn't take me with what

oh

you read the twitch to do that

show that a bunch of rhinox are hiding

behind the display screen I'll switch on

The View pedestal and you shoot them as

they attack I recommend using your

sniper mode

okay and

properly and not most of most of you

have been a terrible or something

because that that was really didn't even

let me know you had this wrong page of

me

this beats disorganized

foreign

let me know if you have ads oh well

that's really tricky because you can't

hear me but

hey let me know if you don't have ads

which of course if you're a subscriber

already know that but

please don't forget to tell me but

otherwise and otherwise we'll get back

and when I answer over this very stupid

of a group which do that

raise your hand if you could have a

hands

there you go oh Baileys sneaking in here

[Music]

that's that's the hydrate

I'm being hydrate for you

got some

as I thought the machine room is

every twitch didn't

didn't like could automatically snooze

when it whenever it is coming

the same with pre-roll ads that

nice one if if you have free romance

which I don't have

because I have the

now I can switch

if you're happy around that they should

also not play when you do a ring there's

a suggesting onion

okay back to the king okay hey Bailey

thank you for lacking

[Music]

if you'd like to have

the labs clean okay

if you like do you have a funny message

but you don't need the final message

like 20 seconds

then we can get back to the funny stuff

again

okay when I did this this thing here it

said that I already got egg this

apparently known bark you see another

back in the game

foreign

there we go

and this should be over everyone should

be here again sorry about the stupid ads

twitch did not tell me that they they

asked for upcoming as this opposed to

[Music]

[ __ ] time

if I don't look at the enemies they

don't see me because that's a bad thing

around here

no that's that's the wrong way that

that's not the wrong way no I'm dying

okay

and not so

and also it's yesterday I

I can connect

everybody

so let me get back to the comments here

I was playing some Star Feed and it was

a fun time that that's good uh

yeah I would assume this this my PC this

is not my language

[Music]

it's probably going to die trying to

play that game

no I don't care playing it

oh you can actually die I was forced to

die there

see another it's not

it's not exactly a bargain game but it

is quite the oversight and it is

terrible game design

does that happen in real United

yeah

it just makes the game bad

so can uh can I run away though and lost

track of time it's right it's it it's

okay even if you all run the race by

pretty fine sorry for what is mess

it's been a mess

be mean rolling into chat I have no way

to play Space game I gotta you could do

it the old fashioned way but then you

think it's quite even funnier Giant

one of my kid is level one

yeah that's right that's space yeah

should I play Skyrim

can this compete demon handle that game

so that would be the special green might

do

I didn't even need to beat those enemies

because you wanted to see if there was

anything

[Music]

so there's only skill points that did

the game wait the game is not going to

say anything about that anyway nope I

just got the last Escape points it's not

going to say man say anything to me

hmm

focusing here everything here everything

here and everything here

we go this is the very final part of the

game which I technically unlocked early

on because you kind of only need half of

the skill points but

when I got all the skill points just to

show that I can't

okay

Nancy Wings gold At Last At Last I don't

know how you say that

I'm confused

foreign

father

the dreaded curves of the team snake
