welcome welcome
to
make some drawings
and welcome hidden welcome welcome yoga
nice for you to look
come by
hi kitten
rabbit Stampede have you count how many
rabbits there
oh yeah
I'm just starting to write a message
I haven't played I want to plug this in
[Music]
there again
[Music]
Okay add countdown from three to zero
and then I will have the comparison
across the street screen and you count
them already
three
two one who's zero I guess
seems like it doesn't lie a bit even
though it's pretty random videos there
you go you got the two chances of
counting how many they are
a lot of rabbits yeah that's a good
amount that's how many yes
a whole lot of
bunnies in
Athenian commentary well yeah that's
much easier to get
but I give you that that's technically
how do I make a selection of a certain
size
[Music]
oh
expansion
thinking
delete this
can't rotate nobody said
that's a good question how do I make a
science specific science
[Music]
so I could still
[Music]
is that how many you have
did you yeah what I mean did you put 38
bunnies
[Music]
and there's some something like 500
pixels want to do an email but that's
not good number
and it should be 560
and by some people
yeah here you go
I really should have like
[Music]
I didn't count I'm going to count today
I'm going to pick on this
but that's me I'm always speaking about
stuff
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
ERS logo
inside the size seven or seven it's hard
to count
it's not hard to count
yes copy up a rabbit
and you can't want to receive 45
and then yeah
it gives a five and then a captain and
twenty thirty six
so you were wrong this thing not 37 I
said yes 36 something
[Music]
can I copy over this too
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
all right I'll start with this
all right it's a luncheon skin yet are
we so I will
lead on this I'll change this game of
this
paints
because it's empty
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
first
well I didn't mean to my attention
wasn't to making me wrong
keep on
wait there are
I didn't say it was some near uh one
that
that emails from twitch new
yeah
everything's old
if I upload
[Music]
so they probably required to be a gift I
can try to open
yeah they let you decorate menu okay
doesn't really matter so what I
currently have
I couldn't have made 33s this is the
34th uh affiliate stream
[Music]
for Saturday
it's enemy
[Music]
so after I've done 60 affiliate streams
I will get access to five follower
emotes for everyone who aren't
subscribed but almost everyone here is
well everyone here currently are
subscribed
but if I mean if you're still here
[Music]
your was subscribed on the first day
that I was streaming
foreign
because you're the third one
[Music]
so that means that five follower
then I have six
[Music]
pubs
and then I have to animated Subs but I
could just make them static just that
time wasting because I actually
animating them is
can I have one
[Music]
that I have basically two uh
hi
ear Subs but I mean no one subscribers
don't say I couldn't feel them but I
really don't need to film them out
and then I have like
1K Beats
was like special ones I guess
4K beats and
finally
and key bits
so that's basically
said I can at least make
five plus six plus two a so that is 13.
that's a good time right
emotes
but I can see that later taste I said
welcome welcome
nice nice noise so
what do we start with
over 100 followers oh yeah that's true
while I was asleep I got two new
followers going from 99 to 101.
two people who are currently not here
[Music]
it's kind of crazy over 144 Saturday
[Music]
nice to see you here too
the whole party here now and you could
do it
you can see the future I remember
supposed to
it was you
it was my first follower
if you have unfollowed well
you no longer count because that's what
which works
[Music]
um
they don't give me more that's three
followers
time to scroll time to scroll to the
bottom okay let's get to the bottom of
this because this is funny
oh
[Music]
well Stella is actually the first person
who followed me
he has been here
it's been quite a while since she was
here and then never blame me
that's the second following
who has been has been here for a while I
did but has been here for a few times
and then water bunny was the sad one
everyone else hasn't been here for quite
a while but has been here a few times
and then the fourth one is kitten
[Music]
though
[Music]
you were default
number four
and number four
and then it was other people
that's enough for
[Music]
anyway
time to stop
delaying everything and started growing
I say by delaying it more by fixing that
you don't know anymore
peace
so what um what a pump and emails did
you want people want
lead oh my heart wait look oh you want
that
you want like nude face like I see I see
pet princess I didn't think of princess
I do have a list here of things
[Music]
I should
and I'll add the loot thing but when I
make an improv in inappropriate yoga or
something
and I was a princess that's a good about
that from the end it's summer
okay fine
haircut is included yes
this is fun and that that looks more
like the okay
I'll let it release there
okay
yeah your hair cuts quite some
some suggestions
okay I haven't gotten see the first one
yet
Okay so
[Music]
um
these two
can't go without an email
okay
and then the most important question
which is the direction should pump on
facing
people see their preference towards the
left but they seemed to be quite married
I mean some
some don't have a preference and have
them both left and right
but most of the time they seem to face
towards the left
um
[Music]
to which seems to prefer facing torch
right there can be the other ones out
here
I haven't I don't do too much left left
is fine left is good
why is there one pizza here
what is it doing
but it annoyed me
okay
so
this is the one that is used the most
um is
the following
this one
so maybe I should do something like that
that's the first one
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
yes spell
[Music]
what the hell do is something like
[Music]
how how do I fit everything because one
Pawn has
quite um
I need a purple difference
[Music]
it does not treat my friends is
is
the document
[Music]
preferences and this is
uh
celebration let's keep one further
prayer and emote sounds like a truth
idea
[Music]
is a good size
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
I like fun fun
I like fun fun
let's like
[Music]
so it kind of needs to be somewhat
and it's cheapest time
[Music]
because uh yeah otherwise
he come to defeat any details
[Music]
if you put that on a separately
[Music]
okay I can't can I cut out the last
[Music]
several times
what's that function
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
and then I can adjust position and stuff
of the whole aim out afterwards
[Music]
so here's conference hands which is
closed
[Music]
of course
she needs to
cover it and say
[Music]
open up something
[Music]
you have the info
each other hand should be here we go
this is
[Music]
to be not much you shouldn't need
haven't but this is of course the I mean
I've done one email but I'm not sure if
you would count that one I'm still quite
inexperience with with this whole thing
that you take feedback
[Music]
but this is a very very rough sketch at
the moment so
[Music]
don't get too hard with me just yet
[Music]
yeah I could probably move the housing
down a bit
[Music]
something like that
[Music]
this is weird looking
[Music]
[Music]
like
imagine the
Road of the head something
then like
spin this thing see
or something
like
what's the middle of
I'm really bad at this
it's cute
now I'm coming timestamps
[Music]
because it kind of feels like the eyes
are in the middle or something
and this is the
[Music]
it could be wrong
I can't change it to feel like
still expect when things
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
you left me
so silly
[Music]
foreign
yeah it wouldn't be anything else
and then a cheerful mouth
oh I've seen and they're great welcome
it's an email to Art stream even
I will try to make ponpon chair
it will be
are the happy smile
this is exciting
I have quite a list of emails to do so
let's I'll see how many I can go see
so cute I mean she she kind of cute she
closed Mouse already because adding like
how would I even add an open varsity
without it looking weird that is
this is that is the hardest part
[Music]
if this should be like
[Music]
[Music]
nothing
how's your day been so far
[Music]
um
I woke up and tried to get up from bed I
was tired
that that's been my day
[Music]
I'm just gonna say it feels like I
missed something I heard me something I
think ponpon has something
I have something called a bow
and also ears
and it's been kind of covered ears
anyway but
[Music]
I will try to draw the ears
[Music]
empty space
[Music]
but then I started streaming and now I
feel a lot of energy
[Music]
can't forget the bow and ears yeah they
were looking away without this foreign
[Music]
how streaming gives you energy
I mean I had to start at least it's
certainly will drain my energy after a
while like the since I did stream six
hours yesterday
[Music]
I'm done streaming give you anything
[Music]
yeah that's that's really good
[Music]
sketching layer
see anything
and then I will do like a
cleaner version
and then there should be some some kind
of confidence
or something
okay is this the this is that how to
handle would look cute
[Music]
maybe maybe a slight adjustments yeah
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
a bit so it is still different
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
grab a bit like that
then it will go into the ear
[Music]
internet
[Music]
pumpkin heads
probably shouldn't there are all the
details on this thing because it will be
you detect
maybe China simplified
they need to be
read about a small scale
[Music]
after on
Sunday is
[Music]
hydrate
[Music]
nice to see you
yeah yes
I probably forgot to change the title of
the stream actually
and drawing
on
emails yeah
there you go
[Music]
oh I got something here
the cat that is it
[Music]
thank you for the photo welcome
hello hello
is it hard to get all the details in for
such a small emote yeah yeah I still see
myself therefore I will try to remove
some detail like
uh
yeah there's like two tops of hair here
probably just do a single one
and then all these details I just ignore
it completely
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
okay
that was uh that was actually a good one
I haven't heard that one before
yeah however
so
most people here don't speak Swedish how
do you think of this joke
because like one person
I actually have two people here learning
Swedish they are probably not at the
level that they understand this joke
thank you for sharing
[Music]
by the way so that's
[Music]
even though most people forget it but I
appreciate it yeah yeah and yeah do you
understand George
yeah I want to explain to you
[Music]
another joke okay wait let's do it in
English
what do you call a cat that can't put
together Fellowship from here
an assembly kit that's an assembly kit
[Music]
it's like
kitten
usually
I've seen like someone I think you're
getting a kitten tickets but I think
that's
[Music]
muy bien
I don't think I have it
I usually don't do that
[Music]
eat us
it was a good attempt
I hope other people
[Music]
it takes too much for my main poverty
understand it
yes Spanish
[Music]
yes
[Music]
hello Spanish is it's my first
it's my first thing English is my second
yep
[Music]
[Music]
how do you say swekko for Swedish
[Music]
[Music]
or something like that I want to speak
Spanish
which obviously is a dream because they
can speak English too
by the way I'm from Spain oh did you
look after this fish joke or are you
actually starting Swedish
I mean you could have done above seconds
listen
foreign
[Music]
Spanish class
for Swedish and so Asia or something
like that from foreign
[Music]
for Sweden
[Music]
I'm not from Spain so if I confused you
[Music]
yes yes
no the party started
[Music]
all the people
and also another Chef Stella is here and
I was talking about here
before her before she left
[Music]
saying that
something like that I'm here he's
working yeah like yeah I think you
showed up and that's too long ago
actually when I think about it yeah yeah
yeah because
I think I don't actually remember
it wasn't too many days ago actually
but and then but before that it was
quite a while and I started missing him
but I did see you over here when I visit
watchdom
uh
and I understand yeah her body
things to do I can't watch every
streamer myself even though I wish I
could
bun in Spanish
if you want if you want to be really
really my voice really don't like me
today
yes I was gonna say so
yeah if you if you want to say like
bunny as in that little rabbit like a
cute rabbit baby rabbit
I would pick connected
and then connect me with just being
rabbit or in general as if
considering me and that I'm drawing this
rabbit that would be koneka or conorita
what games do you like to play pon pon
I like racing games which I don't also
have replaced with the drawing because
yeah I've played quite a few drinks and
chips already so
and then I like to play 3D Platformers
whereas pyro is
after once I like
a lot as well as crash
not as big fan of 2D performance for
some reason
and some works but some like
Raymond I've played a bit of a shooting
should play Raymond boy
but um
I don't find it the Rayman 2D games to
be as fun as
as I've had with the expiring crash 3D
games
and do you know that spiral now what's
Rayman has gone over to 3D but I don't
think the Raymond concept Works in
Sweeney but a better place this Frame
and Sweden claims to be fair so I think
those games were great
awkwards
my face is now like is mine I'm glad
that you are having a good time here we
we're here we are here tea
talk in have fun
I like that
way
when you know if you would drag out
stops that is
by you not playing for hispanically yes
I am and I will continue I will start
the second game so
tomorrow I wreck
okay let's do a very quick look at this
schedule okay so I still haven't added
and maybe support please
but uh Japan is plus nine
so that is for European times that is
you add seven six or five
plus five on the East and that's easiest
because that 15 becomes 20.
so anyway tomorrow break Thursday Friday
or Friday Saturday the anime hours
Australia that's when I will continue
playing The Legend of spire 3 which I
started now last week and then Saturday
Sunday
that's when I will start the second
Crash Bandicoot the insane trilogy
so
back to the right
what is Raymond is it game
today
Raymond is a European game
uh by made by the French developer
Ubisoft
[Music]
um I think they're French am I wrong
if I say something wrong yeah you're not
allowed just tell me that
well or even if they're not French now
they might like start off and France and
mates mate
Raymond at that point
it's a 2d started off as a 2d platformer
[Music]
the game called Ravens
[Music]
and then and yeah it was a 2d platformer
it was kind of
could be a bit brutal and maybe unfair
so but I mean it was the first game
and then I didn't either I really not
followed what's happened with Raymond
they had like
[Music]
um
the uh
yeah I know this and then it was like
the romance 3D for some reason I want to
remember it being a third game but the
second game might also have actually
been in 3D as well
[Music]
I really should play Rayman and then I
know there's the Rayman
Arena or multiplayer or Arena Norwegian
which is a racing game of one foot
like Sonic R
down
and then there is also the whole spider
Skyline situation with Raymond Raymond
and rabbits and the rabbits kind of took
over and made their own series
it's like with Skylanders
but then there is also the Rayman
Origins and Rayman Legends where they
made Raymond in his original to the
design so everything is 2D in those
games
[Music]
and that's all I know about dreaming
so back to comments
the knock knock who's there
house go
campus
oh I see it blue
oh fancy
I don't I don't know what the offense it
was reference to or that maybe I'm
playing uh or or a female magazine
transition
in Spain is called
yes
it's like you you have pretty funny
thank you
honey
Bonita
you are too kind
and if you like our ponpon looks you can
also check out
maybe maybe you think I let the cats
check out today's regimes
and and then you can find that there are
different outfits
as well
Titan likes to redeem this
yes
but maybe maybe in the cat
36 quite interesting isn't it
aside from being the cat
hey
oh no he redeemed it
how silly
but
but the cat was supposed to do it
you got the HTML to work nope I have
that I did that manually
[Music]
I asked someone suggested I'm using
mixed up which is a plugin it can
apparently not say communicate with HTML
files in obs
so and they had two suggestions or one
user had two sister I don't know what
they're
connection with mixed up is
one suggestion was basically
give me a moment for my while my brain
isn't working
yes one suggestion was that
yeah because when you do a redeem you
can make a software launch
and that software would then that
software would in turn communicate with
the HTML used in obs
that's an idea problem is having a
software launch would this is probably I
don't know how if if this if mix it up
in this case can't launch it in the
background or something but launching a
software sure lightweight and still
might
because a
lag to happen it might
it might put focus on that software and
so if I'm playing a PC game that
wouldn't be so great
and other issues
that I don't think that's a good
solution especially if someone and also
this option might appear on the screen
and covering the game that's also not
great
even if it launches and closes pretty
quickly it's still still a distraction
actually I do appreciate the suggestions
of course I don't don't give me one yet
a red rate
so and this section is the second
suggestion was to where
when you have a source in our base for
an HTML file you can add to the file
name additional parameters
you want to load
and but that still means that the hold
file will be refreshed
so any
attempts of using
[Music]
um
what am I thinking of okay using memory
queuing and all that stuff that wouldn't
all that you've mentioned therefore be
lost
and I wouldn't be so hit
that's also not really an option
okay I really
[Music]
take an existing emote that someone has
and see how sick outlines they have and
then I will
use that as a guide for probably how
sick I should go
oh wait that didn't work
[Music]
[Music]
I give my moment
[Music]
that I want to
thank you finally
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you and then
panties
laughing kitten
[Music]
so basically
best to take some color that's actually
a good piece yeah I think this is like
[Music]
the thing
[Music]
um
all right
yeah
[Music]
if I think I don't know it's basically
only the outline and cute
[Music]
thank you
maybe that's why
it's too strong
[Music]
this is better let's see
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
does that hand look
perfect
ly small size it's
not like
[Music]
yeah
you have to close it outfit about it
from it and
[Music]
this this is is outside but
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
relax
yeah that's that's good
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
normal it feels up
this much yeah I haven't even enabled
any scaling there we go yeah nice piece
of this but that's way too little
good morning Hello darling here welcome
now I'm doing some
it's nice to see you
always nice to see you so happy
let's make me happy
makes everyone happy to see you you're
famous here
how is everyone yeah how
how about you everyone
personally
I am happy to be streaming meeting
people
I'll get great points so far yeah yeah
it gets the target
he gets to be here and talk to me
oh my God
you know it yeah I know I I know
and yeah I might I might mention a
little bit too much here
on my stream
but I really like
a second I don't know actually
um I do have a quite a long list of ones
and
I'll just do whichever I feel like
making I guess
I think that sounds like a good idea
and I said I did
now you know that
I don't know
but but
tomorrow
will be free
[Music]
so I can watch
Lolly play Crash if that's happening
I mean I I should if if everything is
going according to schedule
since I never actually confirmed that if
that's true
but I did well question my own
I do like I like those types of games
and also see people watch see people
play those games
Wednesday oh yeah and I did watch the uh
I don't know remember if I said that but
I did watch the whole uh Wednesday
stream or last week when I couldn't
watch it live
it was nice
[Music]
it was nice seeing you overcome that
that level
[Music]
in which I lost city or whatever
[Music]
oh really
yeah I like I like your
I like your style
she's so cute and nice and
everything if everyone says about me
here yeah
it makes me happy I'm glad I found you
Mr spider of course
yes that's how I
[Music]
I know every streamer on Twitch is
either
because they have played spiral or they
have been raided by someone who played
Spyro or they are part of a community
where one of them is playing has played
special the whole reason I came to
Twitch in the first place was because
one person
being dumb Dynamite specifically and was
playing a spiral
using my Pom-Pom mod
that's how everything started
okay kinda but yeah I think that's how I
came to this switch and started watching
and then I kind of decided to stream
myself
and I have continued looking for people
who streamed
a spider and there was a great moment
that
lonely was streaming spider
and also yeah I think yesterday I tried
to do that
I was so tired and then I tried to make
a joke when I completely misunderstood
you a kitten said I think
and because when I started when I was
because one thing I mentioned is that
I'm terrible at remembering names of
people and things like that and until
I've gotten to
hey
I was getting to know them for a long
time because I'm I'm really terrible at
that thing because
when I started
when I did find the Lolly I also find us
another twitch streamer
being a
Mushi Hime who who actually is from
Australia who is a very cute kitten
which I think I read rated once
foreign
kids streamers playing Spider
yeah yeah
the third I followed for setting up my
BTS pet pet was made by someone who used
0.
oh dear who
[Music]
because I've seen two people use
they had a screenshot of the two
channels are eating their first Sunday
oh do you know the name
foreign
used it for
a few like few streams but I don't
remember where the name was
[Music]
other
[Music]
so if it's not highly TV hmm
don't recognize that name but I should
check
that other part
now it was lpt W live
that's fight's name so that's another
this is the same pattern but
foreign
[Music]
okay that's not I don't know that
person
hi
nice was it recently
I mean you did use the tutorials so I
mean it could be could be quite a long
time ago now there's no reason the video
of itself
must have been
this one is
oh she doesn't see him often
last in two months and that would be two
months ago was the last stream
now I test the
one last week it was the last dream
[Music]
no wait yeah yeah one month ago yeah
I haven't watched her streams but the
videos
yeah
okay I
because the only reason I managed to see
those other streams play with Pom-Pom
that's because they say they put their
votes on me
in YouTube
[Music]
oh yeah she does have she seems to put
no
no she only got four videos which one of
them is a tutorial
and then there is
mask
oh that's it I wanted to see those
dreams
[Music]
well
[Music]
I like it
I like you when people play with the mod
apparently if anyone is curious
why not
sorry for being so distracted
from my drawing
if this is important
this is about Quantum
there is a streamer
[Music]
is very new to streaming
[Music]
he doesn't actually have a schedule yeah
okay so
I will
yeah I shout out to voice which is
a rabbi
robo 13.
[Music]
you is a bunny he's another funny
streamer
he's very new
as playing spiral
although it's on the third game now so
you might
not play so there might just be one more
stream with the pump on Monster
a cool name
[Music]
you should tell her that
you're doing great Bangla thank you
all right uh I forgot to about to change
my outfit again because time has run out
keep forgetting that
[Music]
okay I should I should I need to make
that meeting more expensive
so
[Music]
if I were to make more outfits they
would look weird
[Music]
again
so I would probably have to
redraw the whole Pom-Pom
which I'm
probably [ __ ]
at least I don't have to pay any
royalties or anything
the current must
[Music]
the only agreement was to have some
credit
in the uh description which I guess
would be the about page on Twitch which
I have added
so as far as I know I fulfill the
my part I hope
[Music]
yeah I think it's important for these
lips
[Music]
and then there's the hands hands in the
air
[Music]
and then this needs to be and then it's
pretty close it's behind the heads this
one's going to show
[Music]
yes
off everything so I can do the film
[Music]
whoops I forgot to set this as a
means there you go
[Music]
and then the oh
neck ears
starting to
it's the other one
the ear should be behind the arm okay
I'll fix that
and that's that's a quick piece
I'll add a bit to that
[Music]
and then I basically to
delete this
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
welcome
would you be known as Watcher or meet
kit
[Music]
put your paws in the air like you don't
care
exactly
[Music]
the first one watch it yeah
that makes sense
double checking
no can I send it to myself like I have
some people call me Bonbon but I am
pumped on the bonbon I'm not my my name
is in bonbon
I'm Urban so I assume you are a meat kid
and therefore you're not
your name is a different kind of bunny I
haven't heard about that is that from my
game
other franchise ISD first is the game
[Music]
this is actually definitely far outside
now it's a
open species so uh that means
public domain fantasy cliche
[Music]
I have did I get you correct
okay like a mermaid or a dragon
[Music]
I keep finding good funny things lately
do you want some suggestions
cut
we got
I got I got another idea that's that's a
year in my recommendations
[Music]
questions though sure go ahead
and after that I suggested the bonus
treatment if you know about her is mine
is an instrument
is that a meme
that definitely sounds like a meme
[Music]
um
anything you can use in an instrumental
way would be an instrument
the way it would be about and here is a
knot right there I have to wait one
minute and six seconds before I can do
another show that what kind of
limitations is this
and it didn't switch the timer is
already run out
it should be a relative shout out as
many as I want
don't put the restrictions on me anyway
I should be free to do whatever I want
[Music]
44 seconds of weight
nine
okay
be like that then teach
then I try to make your platform more
popular and then do you do this to me
I mean
but if you like our mod is not allowed
to shut up like people
let me
14 seconds left okay I can't wait for 10
seconds
it even worse when it's like oh you have
to wait half a second before yeah I
couldn't do you just put a half a second
delay on my messages please
okay
there you go finally there's a rabbit
which I did uh shout out to very
recently but just like a few minutes ago
but then you should have watched it so
that's another day for you to watch if
you want to watch more bunny bunny I'm
trying to think I I have more bunny
streamers I just can't remember the
exact names because I'm pretty terrible
names
that's awesome things to know about me
if I don't remember someone's name that
is not because I don't care it's because
my memory is terrible
[Music]
thank you
of course of course Daddy
you deserve all the shout outs I should
shut you out in every video
and
oh
this is this is this is a shot at stream
now
wait something went wrong and I tried to
do the shelter let's
that was interesting
that
and then shout out is broken it doesn't
even tell me I'm John dimito and it's
just it just says that it doesn't work
[Music]
do I have any contribution yeah there's
one more attractive now
oh yeah there's another one and
should
I should have a list of all the funny
streams I have
there's there's one that has bunny like
bunny theme but isn't a bunny streamer
herself
I'm gonna go sleep I like your streams
thank you and have a nice sleep and
thank you for the coming by I'm trying
to think Charlie nothing to say no it's
been really fun to
watch your streams too
and yeah it must be very late for you
now
but I guess not too late
I want to take
okay for some reason I can't say shout
out one of the
remix
[Music]
a kid why can't they can you maybe maybe
you can set your channel as to not be
shout out it is
can I use that as a verb
that's a that's another streamer and I
have watched vonabon who has shown up
here at least once
and the
cheese nice
maybe I know you can set restriction
rates yet that I do know
balance that's like connected some way
that seems stupid I wouldn't mind
although although I could see it if
someone kind of abuses their shout out
to shout you out on channels that you
don't want the association with
guess there's a reason to be able to see
you next time
Beauty I will show up on your stream
whenever I see you stream
because you have such a
nice nice energy
bye bye
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yes that's a mouse
[Music]
and then I will test this on like small
skin or something
you can watch it on the phone it's so
scary already
that's not how her nose lives
that's completely different
and the music is by an artist which is
also written on the about page
which also said that you have to add the
credit
[Music]
to use the music but music is a features
could be good for
if you don't I mean yeah if you want to
hear me because that's what I want I I
don't want like remove any of my my mods
I don't want my voice to be
silenced
and things like that
so I really want to avoid any corporate
music
that is me
and so I found this artistic and I
should know the name of it because
[Music]
it just seems like the right thing
yeah
the artist is known as lucarembo
look Rambo who is a South Korean
composite
there is a link to the page
okay it switched going butter and
what's what do you mean by that
I make it so my music doesn't save on
the Bots yeah you yeah that's
I guess that's an option
um
to that's that's
I just don't want to
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
I've seen a lot of people
hey
unauthorized music
him but
it's fine
but there's of course just a one slide
issue is that when I deep after I've
done the stream I do get the music
flagged for being a copyrighted or
something and I and one of the
one of the uh uh
um
thongs and
that it triggers the most is one song
called unknown Title by an artist known
as unknown artist
and that's certainly can't be a fair
claim
[Music]
and then I also got uh there's some
other artist that shows up and which I
am not able to listen to the music
because the music is not free
you have to pay for a spot to provide
Spanish
fortified subscription to listen to that
specific song that it lacks
but it's a completely different artist
I'm not using that person's message
yeah it's very weird
so all I do is
I just select that I'm not using this
music or every track it's three years on
and then text like an hour or two and
then it's gone and the audio is back on
the vote
[Music]
from so much more convenient than it's
on YouTube
and I also can do it on all I don't have
a restriction on like you can only make
three claims or something like that or
counter claims
and that also that it's removed in such
a short time frame
and I have not had any emulations with
that it's just removed and
I will get here
be right back
okay can I hear from you soon is this
the first time you say that you're going
laughs
is that normally a random message from
Ethan saying I'm back but oh you never
said you left
[Music]
how are these
[Music]
but yeah I do need to fill out with more
music because
I only got six hours of music so it's
it's one stream
and I can't play the same music every
stream
[Music]
this is nice and calming music so it's
good music
I like the it's a bit wide too I'm still
listening by the way I'm just stepping
away everybody in that case
[Music]
so you mean I can't see bad stuff about
it
I would never
[Music]
I wouldn't be fruit I like intentionally
I mean
they have
been moments which I regret
but
[Music]
but yeah
[Music]
but I didn't mean anything
[Music]
yeah okay say what you like
no I can't see can't see anything I mean
it's before you should say what I like
to say about you
you guys
it's a TV Fair I don't like to say
anything mean so
[Music]
okay I've got to see let's do something
obvious color
I think
thank you I think it's something like
that yeah
[Music]
yeah but now we can talk about it
feels like someone is missing someone
like Mickey
[Music]
without you
[Music]
okay now I can see the eyes are kind of
uneven but
um let me try to adjust that a bit
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
should be a bit taller
yeah I think I think I like that
so these will act as masks
[Music]
so I can make
make you feel like that
[Music]
how should I do the eyes
you better
[Music]
maybe I should just do no I don't know
and and say something
and what does a pervert it's Friday
oh you
[Music]
a confused frog saying a rabbit
[Music]
[Music]
all right
looks evil
things like that
[Music]
the Evil Pumpkin
[Music]
uh
yeah these looks awkward
and then when I'm wearing I get done on
this the more arguments
her shows is very advisably I have five
things and
okay
baby take it easy with your
[Music]
thank you
I mean this is another Channel but
in there
and this is an internet exactly like I
want it back
thank you
[Music]
and another today I have my box of
chocolates with 12 chocolates but now
there are 11 who has given you
permission to escape from the box
back
[Music]
wait a minute but I don't have a color
from one of them's mouth
hmm
I can do like tongue
the ear colors I think
but I mean that works a kiss saving on
the palette
let's
[Music]
okay I'm excited correctly
[Music]
that's the awkward shooting
yeah do you feel like the mouth being
that dark it's called very hard to see
therefore I can do it do you like that
what
I think you could interpret that one in
many different ways like
okay thank you
it's a little bit awkward looking but I
mean it's the first one I need so
[Music]
hmm it makes me think hooray that's good
that's then I got the
[Music]
correct
okay baby
uh this time doesn't look good
[Music]
yeah I feel like him
you have a lot of
the year said yeah I
I don't think this is the audience for
that kind of joke
[Music]
I I think you're in the wrong place for
this
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
confetti
oh yes
Maybe
but it's at 75 feels a slightly muted
that's a good term
I like you see age is reserved
but but I guess that's that's that's
what phone is
reserved
[Music]
let me duplicate the mouse before I do
something stupid
are you going to have coffee yes that I
will try to do that
hydrates and also the outfit is perfect
these are another sex joking before I
read it
who's the most popular guy at the
nearest car in it okay
[Music]
the one who can carry a cup of coffee in
his head
that doesn't understand there's this
there it is
yeah yeah I think I think you don't need
to post more of
those jokes
they are a bit of Orange
foreign okay yeah
no
no one's
all right so it's okay
got those expected three wishes yep yeah
I feel like yeah
to fight for confrontations as well but
yeah please don't post much
thank you
[Music]
yeah
yeah like it started off again though
the
with the without pan
before London showed up I think so
that's one
something like this
[Music]
and
there you go that's that's a bit
more energy
[Music]
ah
[Music]
and normal jokes like snack texture yeah
hello Jimmy
[Music]
I drink
done
[Music]
yeah I had normal Jack like knocking
just I mean
she's trying to find some varieties
I mean yeah
[Music]
it doesn't have to be like it could be
like
[Music]
I might misunderstand you here
but yeah it doesn't it doesn't need to
be knock knock jokes I mean those are
fine it's not it's not it's not the
structure of the joke it's the theme of
the joke that's
[Music]
which is what was the
problem is that good time
knock knock who's there the other lady
you're the lady who
I don't know you could jump so sorry I
couldn't really
follow along with that
[Music]
yeah you don't have to study joke if
it's not fun for you
yeah I mean yeah if you don't
if you really want to tell sex jokes you
should probably find
somewhere else to the a place that would
appreciate it more
yeah usually keep it content appropriate
for the type of chat more things yeah
I appreciate it I appreciate you are
here and what this attractions but
if you don't like it and like if you
don't
find it entertaining I don't know
yeah and there are many channels that
every cent is
they are willing to be here
[Music]
thank you smart touches the chips
[Music]
okay starting look more like
somebody saw me
below or something
okay hey
I started with the chilling one because
that
yeah I think I got something better too
much because that is the one that's uh
the most used one
foreign
like a good start
it's really getting there
[Music]
right maybe it's hard
[Music]
and the bad thing is that the only human
I'm good at
is black here but as in
I am yeah
because I have to put up with
[Music]
it's not hard to make it sense you can
just chat yeah I mean
uh is there anything else going on
what's your favorite animal a cat Maybe
starting from his name
um
we are in here being silly
[Music]
without jokes
I need some kind of
[Music]
aggressively lurking
my study a bit super lurk
[Music]
you know taser I think I said
did you write something before
yeah yeah yeah
you gave the suggestion for what image
today yes anyway I have it for you it's
been that you're so relaxing this time
[Music]
hey
[Music]
it's not another reason hey you still
have a good time yeah we had to have a
good time
my name is
yeah yeah I mean
yeah I kind of realized that as soon as
you ask the question but that doesn't
mean anything it's yours
foreign
[Music]
because we are having fun
hello
[Music]
relax
thank you
I tried
another mixing up English and Swedish
because well I or E actually it just
means in
was a laughing in do you but doesn't
work in English because that's the fact
is that that's what I ever teach
um
so
maybe I can use
the
this color palette yeah I could probably
use this kind of paint no I didn't oh I
didn't want to do that
[Music]
I don't know
there you go and things need to open
Chrome
okay this is the color palettes of
colors you can choose on there
on the channel called colors
I'm smart and you're smarter than I am
I have a question for you no
how did you get the name lady oh yeah
I'm not sure if you
don't live
um
do you know what the email you can't do
next I actually don't know um
and do you have a suggestion
I don't like
to eat carrot sizing event
s
associate
I wish I could like when I guess I can
can
[Music]
you go they get the spelling as well
[Music]
I made a list of my notes
I've suffered by a bunch of first and
last names related to my scene I've
tried out different combos
is like lollipop yeah I think I that
makes sense
why is that too much there I
it's probably more knife
but there's probably going to be a much
Niche but
I think and I would be better it's also
easy to draw so
because of class which is quite a clever
combination
[Music]
your name is so clever
I like it
okay I thought it was like a drink or
something
[Music]
I have to reach your favorite
[Music]
yeah that when people look at my name
and think oh Bonbon that must mean
sweets or something no no it's
it it's suspect
but
yeah it is
[Music]
take a quick look at that and see how do
I even draw
[Music]
[Music]
oh that's a recipe
snatches
[Music]
um
[Music]
sorry I
don't you're quite having fighting isn't
it sets
[Music]
yeah I should I should get back to the
chat
[Music]
[Music]
back here
[Music]
that's what stayed open that was
actually quite welcome to me that I
thought I had a couple options and asked
my friends which one they like the best
when I saw a good choice yeah
right oh
right sounds interesting I should add
those to the list
holding knife
[Music]
people smile I guess
um holding
Orange
are you going to write
do you think my audience would like
oh you want the scuff this one
is so cute
[Music]
yeah
I think I'll it'll be here Friday that's
how long
I hope you get it soon so you can read
I don't know if you mentioned what book
it is so I don't know it which is
[Music]
in my head
foreign
yeah if you if you don't have fun here
you are free to leave you don't you
don't need to stay here if you
if you are bored they don't
[Music]
hey I mean
there are many many streams out there
you can go and watch inside
Maybe
empty
more popular ones are probably
you can probably easily find find the
challenge more suited for your taste
make sure maybe that's dark humor
um but certainly
not taking much
the person who made my skirting world
has a redeemer is to make you your own
scarf emotions how much she started
reading
there's another Point yeah I assume
I'm sitting in that stream and working
cute
but it really depends on how many points
the exactly achievable it's not like
those who have like get a Millions
points that takes like 150 days of
constant watching
English
yeah
I mean
next
personally
um but the other people could get
could probably get upset if here with
that kind of attitude
so yeah if you if you don't have fun
yeah you're freely
no one's forcing you to be here
Steven she's amazing foreign
thank you
and saying that
once every day
[Music]
yeah well one funny the same way
I'm I I'm just I'm such a pushover
[Music]
it's just
[Music]
that's very kind of funny to say though
[Music]
that's good learning tell them
I don't know
I was going to ask you
okay because it's long message let's
translate this I get so tired
I have but wait wait let me read this
video let me see chocolate I would go
from Academy movies
[Music]
so wait basically what I got is I get so
bored
by going from a rabbit that gives
laughter
[Music]
to being a rabbit
it looks like a
[Music]
humorist and that doesn't give laughter
I'm on here
because I like to tell Jabs or random
people
because it entertains me but well I mean
you're not entertained now so
[Music]
yeah I mean
and now
I don't know why he's still here then if
you let anything
because it's definitely seemed to be
bored
and do your fact like me originally
being a
gave you laughter
yeah because I mean originally you he
came like a
a good joke that wasn't sex related or
dark
and it was a cute joke he started off
really great
[Music]
bringing up the past hours I haven't
been singing
princess I love it
yeah I've gotten that far
I mean I had sharks
no because I don't really know the full
context of what's going on
let's say listen I love doing this
I don't know that
I haven't landed my Spanish yet but I'm
on my way
yay
[Music]
let's do some thin thin of things
this one this one might be a bit soft
I thought I'd be India on this guy oh
[Music]
okay okay
um kitten wrong person
cat Decat
uh
so
yeah
please don't complain anymore
um
thank you you trying the whole mood down
and it's just boring and I don't I don't
want to
remove You by force if you don't like to
be here if you're bored please find
someone else here or anything
as I said you like to go to random
people and and be entertained by
sending checks for them
and if you and if the jokes doesn't work
on me then you need to go find another
streaming
[Music]
but if you continue doing this
we need to take drastic measures
um
[Music]
I really don't like the bad people
[Music]
yeah I mean yeah
unless they're obviously it's coming
[Music]
but yeah if you yeah
foreign
[Music]
it's I wouldn't be surprised if you
think like
a translator to give this Swedish it
doesn't really feel like
human
[Music]
so you learn English
wait uh you what you said you're
learning is yes you you know Spanish you
know English
[Music]
having a fun chat
be on your best behavior or
we have to
the fish
at least at least that's the warning and
then we take that's
I speak so much to acceptable
but yeah
anyway anything else funny going on
[Music]
I
dude am I done with this one the
cheering one
isn't it awkward looking but I mean
it's the first one I made
so
[Music]
all right
[Music]
okay and something I actually went
before
[Music]
okay
I'm eating breakfast oh what are they
eating my PlayStation 2 works I thought
it was broken I was just like
Commerce that is bad the yeah
it's not that good
I'm always awkward
what do you know
I speak Spanish because then and in his
own nice
yeah pudding
pudding
pudding padding I don't know what that
is
[Music]
[Music]
so let's
move on this people
anyway
[Music]
uh
I forgot to make it transparent
nearly me
[Music]
and from the white background
that wasn't
[Music]
there you go
[Music]
I need to move this so as I can see the
chat
made it with coconut milk and rice I
love the raspberries
I don't know what I don't know if I like
programming probably
I
I like another thing so
I don't know how that combination is I'd
like to train it
[Music]
I expect things weirdly
[Music]
when I get when it's something I don't
know
okay
[Music]
but I like to try
[Music]
I like to try different things the
Catalan is my native language
it's the it's a romance language it's
not like Basque which is a completely
different language it's like
similarities just to Spanish
that's him and French
and
Dorian
in Android let's speak Captain right
it's easy and I can prep it ahead of
time
maybe I can even make it myself
currently is a Spanish I like try to
variant but some would say that's it's
uh
its own language
what kind of language or dialects really
depends on politics
[Music]
uh
and it's probably yeah they probably
referring it to a separate language
because they can
Catalonia if I'm not mistaken has a bit
of
a push or Independence
back to some interest in it and
that's
okay
[Music]
[Music]
but our our languages are just
yeah just different dialects of the
proto-human language
one cheer I think people call it
celebration
maybe I should call it
and depression is quite a long name but
it's fine
energy
[Music]
you can see it works and this is a bit
awkward looking but these words
[Music]
it's a it's a bit scarf everywhere
[Music]
maybe I should call it Chia it's a short
name I wish I could add like
I don't know if I spent here this
Craigslist is wrong with it and yeah
yeah and
[Music]
let's create a
winter farts
[Music]
for emads
so I can manage them straight from
this stream
[Music]
still only 33 of 16 they they stream
so I need to remove one of the existing
ones well I guess I remove the old hype
and replace it with a knee-high
I mean that makes it makes sense right
how does it look when
twitch just can sit down compared to my
eyes came down
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
17 at the moment because I cannot change
that
and when do you get like option to
change the your prefix is
and and what are the restrictions
[Music]
you prefer hype of a chair I can write
hype
I used to switch Auto scaling for mine
and I think you are fine yeah it's
probably fine it looks kind of fine so
yeah
foreign
[Music]
myself as the Creator
so people can
yeah yeah
if people press on one of the existing
ones
fun
it's just saying artist designer
artists decided that they just depends
on language
it's nice now
I think it's partner one day maybe
one day my my favorite
while I'm 17.
rabbit in Polish is chronic is that is
that rabbit in general
instead of feminine version of it
earlier
do you eventually get to change your
prefix and it is some way of changing it
foreign
so how my world has little Littlest
ciggy as the artist while Hammer rage
has no artist which I can assume it's
super sahamas
themselves recruited
if you want to see bunny it's rolling
stick well it check
foreign
[Music]
well I made
I made a hype
I need to remain actually named the old
height
like I can't name it
is
I can only delete it
but
good morning
[Music]
[Music]
how do I see here
when it has been approved whoops I move
the chat
oh that one is cute pet pet
s
we'd have to see
I know I didn't I didn't mean to do that
although I didn't finish it
how do I see when it has been approved
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
yes delete
[Music]
wait a minute
wait just a minute
and
it's like a fun pet
do you want the petty bonbon pumpkin
I think I missed your hydrate I should
hydrate now
on 15th nights I try to be married I
don't know I just hydrated
[Music]
was it instantly approved
[Music]
what
what's what's the
what was the
yeah
what
I didn't hey hey you might you might
need to refresh this stream before you
can use it
it looks so awkward but that
Sansan hi
this is quite five that has been
approved already
[Music]
looks awkward if it's
nice one
yeah I caught it hype too and I need to
rename it let me uh
[Music]
wait sometimes it looks sharp and
sometimes it's learning
um why is that
[Music]
this way sometimes or something
nice
it seems to work
I'm I actually don't have to check the
on the stream it seems to my Fine Thing
well
I'm happy that
[Music]
I need a
folder for all my emotes
probably yeah I think I think white
index that I could sorry it's the same
thickness everywhere
oh
[Music]
I see okay that's how they worked
and then 28 for the smallest size so
it's tiny
bit tiny
got compared to see what's going on
[Music]
when I send it it's just up as the mode
name in my mobile chat but when other
people sending ships
when you send it it
shows up properly for me so
but I gave it a different name just
because I don't want it to have that how
do I don't name it
I have to upload it again
[Music]
what's this
what's friend versus
[Music]
yeah those are the uh twitch emotes the
DVD for Twitchy modes are so weird
[Music]
[Music]
do you think that do they just allow me
to
uh
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
it's almost looks like the twitch.com a
little bit better than when I tried
managers I
and I'm doing it manually honestly I
still need to re-upload it
to have it have the correct name because
it can't be called hype too
[Music]
as airplanes I have to because I didn't
know I couldn't rename it
[Music]
it's a little bit silly but you can't do
that
[Music]
when it seems to be instantly approved
so I'm happy for that at least it's a
bit weird because I shouldn't have
because that's what twitch says
okay
remove these things I can
anyway indirect contact
and currently it's not possible to
oh
yeah it's not possible to upload
follower emotes for your account
[Music]
you can't currently upload following
modes to your account because you don't
have the permission to upload the modes
directly
and
and yeah I can't upload the image
directly because they have to be
approved by twitch first but they seems
to be approved in like a second or so
so
by the way there's the hype one which is
called just hype now
so
[Music]
new name works good
[Music]
okay
[Music]
the old name was t for me at least
how does it show no it does not work on
screen because it's okay so so
what you see in the chat
screen is how it should show for
everyone else
now if he has to refresh either if you
can refresh this chat to refresh the
Stream
[Music]
at least I can
I see
[Music]
hey what is my jacket
[Music]
it is a champion
[Music]
does it look a bit darling copter wait
foreign
[Music]
slide down the stream and close it that
way
I maybe depends on what device you have
to
no thanks I'll do that I mean I mean it
seems to work for you okay
I'm not sure why the rest of the uh
oh
and then show up for me
but yeah there it is there's they have
one
that only took forever to make
maybe not really fast that means
well okay
and what's the
what's the next image to make
[Music]
I will cross out that one since I made
it
maybe I should put the image first so
they all get a casino
nine
there you go
so again
what was it amazing suggestions
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
can I
[Music]
[Music]
then here I
it's probably because it's using the old
code Maybe
a new PIN message with the new one
yes
since I've changed it to be uh without
the two because there's no reason
there's a two in the name I didn't like
it
but I need to login
why are you coming to your country as a
virus
maybe it's just switch between me or
something oh that was up
foreign
yeah sometimes it is
I guess
[Music]
in one of the ones that uh
Ethan probably once
[Music]
I think that's how it's been laughing
laughing

[Music]
I try to gather
[Music]
some of evidence is to use but
foreign
[Music]
[Music]

want

amazing artist
amazing I don't know
there is a bit too strong about her
[Music]
it's like she's upset
thank you

yeah I guess it was an awkward moment
for you to run out
thank you
now you too can use the name but
it's a bit weird looking
I mean
I don't have a clear
picture but I'm trying to do here
I'm just going to
pronounce that level of
you know what
Beavis

here it is
you think of yes

not at that 11.
but it would be cool if I got about
seven
yep run RT I mean this
there is a part two
no I mean there is there is some Saucy
Arts too but
can I stayed in
maybe it's because I need
maybe maybe if I had two heads
[Music]
yeah that is quick
it needs to be driving the other
direction
[Music]
[Music]
when it's called not safe for words
not yet
foreign
porn like
I'm talking about this stuff again
[Music]
but yeah
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
and that's the same thing
we get it well I call it doesn't work

I mean I guess there's a technical
difference
it was a broader term
okay I wanted to say a different mark
pretty message Mr House
[Music]
[Music]
for the sake of this month
[Music]
it's a bit
[Music]
I'm adding it fun fun I am having a

other one it feels wrong
native englishness

a kitty like
these like this but
[Music]
it's
[Music]
like

with legs
Oh you mean
those
I did not sit around if it's on that
question
[Music]
now here catching on what's going on
here
beginnings
meet me
[Music]
[Music]
it's definitely outside of Hampton
housing away
it's tough to have fun eating her
her fancy
no she's not eating her hands
is her bath clothes
[Music]
if living our hand eating
[Music]
she's covering her mouth
nothing
next
because the body is missing but
[Music]
apparently supportive it's just a
floating head
[Music]
would be like
[Music]
[Music]
yeah this one's from behind
and inside
and then that's
[Music]
something like that
I hope I didn't miss anything I missed
them
try going to do something again
please please stay away from the topic
before something happens
[Music]
please
otherwise
[Music]
anyway
yeah but it's a
just get that yet to say that
I wanted yeah
[Music]
yeah it should it should be like it
shouldn't be like be able to tell that
it's like
particularly the same look
I I would try to teach things up even
though I mean
limited space
but then yeah I should try it yeah it
shouldn't be
yeah yeah that's fine
I sent me the how about this yes it was
nice uh
and what are you staying so long
you always make me happy
yeah
yeah
did you write like I didn't pay
attention to chat and for some reason I
can't see did you write something more
about after that
that's that was enough
the fluff is
the flap I just said yeah I must written
something more
excited no no I mean I was I was I
didn't want to but I mean they were
pushing it now so
bad enough I gave many many more things
yeah
it's very it's very I think the attorney
is really cute so far I didn't be
talking no no I didn't know it was
don't worry it's not funny just want to
let you know like yeah
yeah I feel like yeah yeah first yeah
yeah
statements wasn't like your defense like
I was copying someone no matter if you
recognizing something no he said that it
was about myself
thank you
that's good for everyone yeah
I feel like it was last try yeah I mean
that was yeah I I like it I was pushing
it it was okay thank you
okay I got the customer yeah don't be
like right away
hurry hurry bye bye
but I was saying I'm up do you want to
do that
you don't have to do that
I was considering yeah
think of your internet
you don't you don't have this large
I don't I basically close down
everything when I stream
to make this dream and stay blessed
Batman
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
but
a bit
I know that
[Music]
there have been some
[Music]
oh yeah oh you have a separate okay I
see it now I understand now now I get it
yeah you you you're not
you're not connected to your home
network on your phone and you have a
move button okay okay that's fine well
in that key
[Music]
in that case due to nothing I appreciate
I appreciate this
their King
the other day is hiding in a bunny
Barrel
turkey
not many singly
[Music]
glad that they are happy bunny yeah
silly moments makes me also happy
I'm feeling sometimes
how are you doing everything
I'm doing fine
it was a bit of an awkward moment before
but
that's me I'm I'm really awkward
[Music]
that's just that's just how it ends up
[Music]
that's nice to hear
[Music]
yeah I think I think it could be a smart
idea to basically replace the
and the ones I currently have available
as emails with like on conversions of
them
I mean not all of them are good yeah
they are really nice in time thank you
thank you so much
[Music]
because
like and because I wanted to basically
replace the one so I replaced the hype I
couldn't live in my place in this one
and I should probably replace
[Music]
these two as well because they are
whatever most are you working on now
but you see it
is
funny laughter
fun fun
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
let's go with that
[Music]
[Music]
just
start regular amount of
deviousness
[Music]
it's kind of hard to get
um
[Music]
vanity since this like
at the same time it doesn't work with
this style of teeth
I guess it is necessary for just this
one
[Music]
I'm going to research something oh
that sounds suspicious
but I would still behave
I see like this one I used apparently
you need an update before it shows up
everyone because I'll change it again
yeah it did really quick
[Music]
yes
[Music]
it's it's for when you do something
silly it's the silly one
oh I know I used for that you see this
one
this mysterious
it's silliness
it's whatever you wanted to be
[Music]
oh
oh
that's that's mischievous
removing my dress like that Powerhouse
how dare you
and then that person like
what
can everything instead
[Music]
I thought you didn't do that thing here
I mean there's a difference
[Music]
[Music]
I hide their face
and I'm working on it
[Music]
I'm working with full speed
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
it's good enough
[Music]
oh my God blushing but using her ears
high that would be so cute that actually
sounds like a great idea I need to write
that down on the list
[Music]
where are the blushing ones
[Music]
yeah it is
writing friends with ears
yes
[Music]
yes yeah her hairs
because that's what you hear me
Okay so
foreign
let's
try this then
[Music]
[Music]
okay that's kind of weird
maybe the minute that's better
and
like balancing it out a bit I think it
does hands look nice do they I think
I'll tell you more but
is what I can do
I mean okay ish I guess
[Music]
Buffy heads yeah yeah it would be fluffy
that's true
but yeah
at least I think so
[Music]
I mean it's the skill level I have so
[Music]
oh
[Music]

emotes and then after I've drawn on I
redraw them all
like a new version

experience

foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay
but wait this one needs
that is
this one actually my privates
every few
interesting
it's amazing awesome adorable beautiful
is the cutest adorable nicest kindness
bestest and most amazing out there and
she draws amazingly I am still I I still
think you don't know what a messy
[Music]
okay
so
I don't see now
let me add that to the Discord server
press on my all these should appeared
out there too
[Music]
I had pet in compensate yeah that's what
I had practice
kill
another one done
now your heart is amazing
it really looks oblumpy and Arc for it
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
use of compliments
[Music]
she feelings
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
I've only been staying for four hours
I'm not tired you're tired
[Music]
it means you will improve
yeah I guess you're right about that
yeah because I definitely can see that
my art
it's not like at the same quality
it's a lot of fun
[Music]
and it's
uh yes I could improve on I know that's
why she's so crazy
oh you always
with your compliments
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
one thing that always irritating me when
I was in a band was everyone telling me
how good that was I know they're being
nice and even though
I mean
it's still nice to know that I'm doing
something that people think is good yeah
I think that it's like really other
people they think it's the most amazing
thing ever that seems a bit too
hyperbolic but
[Music]
but that's it's not terrible
that thing could improve
but uh of course that I was knowing more
like how in what way would it be
improved
and that's you're saying well that thing
looks a bit ugly
that doesn't help of course
[Music]
well I'm I am
I was going to say running out of there
I'm not I got plenty of the list today
[Music]
like
many other things
[Music]
[Music]
that do you want like ideas like which
idea from the list which is published on
Discord sermon of course anyone here who
wants to interact everyone is
interacting around
[Music]
does it refresh if I did it
does
[Music]
oh oh I see I see what's going on
[Music]
I need to copy the address
[Music]
I think
and now I doubles the great page thank
you we still are waiting
[Music]
but they did maybe they bought that
previously found that hand sticking out
to be a bit
suspicious
[Music]
we're not even surprise me if they have
some AI
image recognition seeing that
[Music]
Flags uploads and suspicious and that's
when they look at it otherwise they use
let them it's true which is a fire
system
and it's better than having to review
every single image
[Music]
and
outside
[Music]
oh
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
I've seen teeth no that's not very good
there is a lot more difficult than
playing an instrument though oh I mean
[Music]
when it comes to playing a song you have
diagnosed right there and yeah okay okay
I need to play the correct notes or you
don't
well I mean there is something you can
you painting or your uh but you always
sound like a trumpet and I'm just a
teacher just to play it sounds like
you're playing a trumpet I mean your
last example I would argue is bad
because I mean a pen pencil should look
like a pencil Strokes after you use it
so I mean if it looks like a ballpoint
pen or what they're called it's yeah
it's weird
but I do get what you mean if you use
playing to perform you're playing
according to already composed music
while drawing you usually compose
completely new artworks
[Music]
hmm
the first status it wasn't coughing no
I'm not done yet
[Music]
obvious being silly as usual
[Music]
I wanted to try
[Music]
[Music]
this is how you hold on
I'm trying
this no right on wrong Arrow has to
start I mean certainly
I mean there is a writing wrong
depending on what you are trying to draw
similarly to music You could argue
there's not nothing wrong in the way you
play
but if you're going to play a specific
song this is the wrong way of playing
this song but you could just play freely
you don't have to
play after a certain song
but if an artist is trying to meet up
and he said friends and that would not
be wrong yeah but if you try to
imitate the sound of a piano using a
trumpet
and you're actually succeeding with that
it's not wrong
okay I mean
I guess yeah you read your message it
made sense but now we kind of have
stopped it
yep
I am being silly
and then look at the difference between
I mean
I said it's really the best way what you
call it if you're going to draw
you know those medieval drawings of cats
whatever it is
if the girl was to draw a cat
properly they failed but if their Vision
was to draw a cat in that way because
they thought it was funny or something
or artistic it's correct it's the same
with music
that
while you are playing the song playing
so-called wrong notes can still be
correct if you're trying to improvise on
the song
[Music]
but I do still get what you're saying
because usually when I play music you're
playing already pre-composed music while
you're drawing you're composing your new
original artworks
this
is that main difference
yeah sure but too many wrong notes be
standard we're not going to enjoy
funny I mean what do you do what do you
consider running out around that sounds
bad
foreign
[Music]
enough wrong notes but manage to make
them fit another song areas playing
another song
and it would still sound good
I mean if you're playing in a pan maybe
it doesn't match the other instruments I
mean you could argue there but if you're
like a solo artist you usually Solo in
when you're drawing
[Music]
oh
yes I obviously I can't say what you
mean by
wrongness here but the the city thing I
can think of is
and yeah that's your part still needs
more addressable gocast and that's the
truth for drawing too if you're part of
uh
group of people making artwork yeah you
still need to match
uh those other people if you have like
if you're working on drawing for
[Music]
a studio
yeah if you're working like a TV show
animated TV show and you're drawing they
certainly are wrong ways of drawing the
characters
that's not what the student wants it to
look like
[Music]
and yeah and uh Oscar also going to say
that if a wrong note is consider notes
that just sounds bad in context
obviously a note itself doesn't sound
bad but in context it sounds bad
certainly that should be applied to
artworks too because some artworks just
looked bad because of me
um
it's yeah the arm just doesn't look good
when posed like that in this concept
context I don't like that
but the general message
explain more that you'll need the hidden
style of Mozart I mean again unless you
try to play a song from Mozart but you
want it to sound like it was written by
Bach if that's your goal you're not
playing it wrong you just you you're
just doing it in a different way
and again
if if your goal is to to draw a picture
in the style of one artist and you draw
it in a standard on a different artists
you're doing it wrong
[Music]
like I agree with your interesting but
you're on your examples yes I find them
to be bad
[Music]
[Music]
I lost my food what
I made a sandwich and I lost it how does
that make sense
[Music]
I don't think I ate it maybe it did
I think that's happened to me
I don't know where I put my sandwich or
something and all right I ate it
but advice there is so much chocolate oh
wait I ate it
I had to make the nuts yeah like this
it's a bit tall
yeah I would say that this one looks bad
because if it's timeless
but I'm hungry like I didn't eat
anything oh well in that case
and that just mean that's one sandwich
wasn't inside
you need a second one
[Music]
all right I didn't imagine everything
foreign
[Music]
you need two sandwiches
[Music]
found it did you sit on it again
[Music]
okay she's been sitting on his food
[Music]
it's gonna be a running joke
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
relation to music
I can't understand why you would argue
for an objective right or wrong answer
yeah
but that's only in depending on the
context
[Music]
it's really really deeper yeah because
you must be spoke of Orchestra and like
playing in a bed and things like that in
that case you kind of have to follow
along onwards on the agreements
but music in general it really depends
on what sounds good and what sounds bad
which of course applies also to
um artworks some pictures looks good and
some pictures looks bad
foreign
[Music]
I do agree
like a students yeah I do so I do agree
with
some some of the viewpoints you have and
like it depends on context and and as
far as I know the context you're
speaking of you would be correct
because yeah
but it was that's that's not the same
that's not the only way of playing music
and you can also apply the same con yeah
idea to uh
Arch like
um those who restore artworks they
certainly there's certainly are basic
and objective way of
uh restoring a network it should look
like the original otherwise it's not
restored
thank you
[Music]
it was on the table
1967 tonight
when you're talking about songwriting
I'm just talking about players
[Music]
now
really I mean I'm you can still
you could certainly still play an
existing song but you want to add some
twist to it are you sure if you call
that song writing
but to be fair you are trying to compare
well not songwriting to
art making
which apartment you can in general
songwriting would fall under that you do
you convert to very different things
I guess they're not very different
things
that's satisfy
[Music]
it's not going to take
[Music]
[Music]
it
I hope it's obvious what's going on in
the picture now
[Music]
okay
the singing One
don't mind today VD how the notes look
that's
I'm glad you like it and I'm glad you
could see that it is simple
[Music]
Pikachu

I keep forgetting but that one
yeah that's
[Music]
a singing
[Music]

foreign

to convey I guess I've succeeded
[Music]
hopefully it's cute too it's gonna be
cute
[Music]
[Music]

track
maybe that was to be too much
[Music]
I did the kids
thank you thank you
thank you very much
then you can use it when I do my karaoke
at some point
[Music]
yeah when it comes to non-english words
my pronunciation might be
different
what you expect
cut out okay okay
that will be nice yeah
and then definitely
beating with how I visually has
extracted structured this
even
I have put the playlist as
randomized and but it I
don't know if it's actually like
playing through all songs before it
looks
or if it loops
we could replace some sound
or it has plain other songs
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I should replace it with the toothbrush
help me something now
I don't think so
why did I do every subsequently yet one
bonus two years did you know that

comfortable
[Music]

that's awesome even cross on everybody
now I mean like
back yeah leaving the very small town
and like you have like this dust gravel
dust I don't know they're building up on
the road side to side of the road and
then and then you have these winds
although you said it was the wind but
but yeah but and then it's like a
periodic wind and then it blows all the
dust so you get all sweaty then this
dust comes over and
sweat
it's nice to get rid of all that yeah
we get closer with your body that sounds
itchy
[Music]
tap
to empty
drop the microphone
and the hand holding the microphone
foreign
[Music]
separately yes
this is a very short microphone
he's a baby microphone
and holding yeah
[Music]
I see means holding two hands together
but
[Music]
and to make your phone doesn't
because it's the hand during the whole
thing
[Music]
oh foreign
and now
to fill this stuff up again I forgot to
close it off
what color should be much for me
that's a body color
[Music]
maybe that project
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
the microphone is proof of it oh
I mean
yeah I am speaking to a microphone at
the moment so
I don't know if you understand that one
you were referring to but
it's making sure this is like I mean
this table looks perfect this is exactly
how about but what's with this team I
mean
it's missed another price of it
I mean this doesn't matter though
and it wouldn't hurt just feeling this
uh
and yeah he is also
this is the action of mouse Corner let's
let's see
whoops
that wasn't the same button this is the
same but
it's not mouths
I'm gonna delete this one
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
oh
yeah
and one final thing
which I guess I could do on a separate
thing
thank you
and that's cute anyway
let's use the same palette
sorry I was very focused on that air
painting
without you my phone we wouldn't be able
to see
here how cute and adorable you sound
like and with that perfect 90 Sweet
Sound and calming voice
The Voice the sound coming and raised it
into the mic for us to hear proves that
you sure are a cute a cutie behind the
microphone he's gone funny I'm doing
everything
oh
yeah you're amazing yeah yeah
so so nice
my dear God set
I don't like being cute so this thing
doesn't get have a cute voice to cry and
kids
that really makes me happy otherwise I
read my own technology
it's safe
[Music]
[Music]
I mean you didn't miss the word here
I mean this sucks
[Music]
unless you refer to something else
that is true without the microphone we
want to won't I think you meant that to
be happy here her kid and adorable voice
I can't imagine not hearing Papa's voice
her voice is servicing is nice and very
clearly and it puts me in a Happy Meal
if you want to hear more of my most
points out there
maybe it is awkward but you have a
YouTube channel
and apparently don't have a command for
that
idea man for that
no I don't
recommend for that
but
you got this foreign
bought
I know and what is that yep
yep well it's it's https colors like
less youtube.com
that is
um
also you see I was a type not seen
I posted the videos mostly covering
um
um
yeah
mods I made for a Spyro reignited
and also
the robot
and
most of the with the it's the panda
video I made before of I mean I made
after I started streaming
and all other videos on my YouTube
channel I made before I started
streaming
so I did that five episode let's play of
Spyro and of course before I started
streaming so that's that's it it's a bit
terrible
but I decided that streaming with a live
audience with a direct communication was
much more fun
I'll do a very scary at the beginning
how do you celebrate the national day
are good and strawberries now I haven't
really considered celebrating national
day
but I really want to bake like a
strawberry cake it's always about
Associated it's kind of this one of the
mid-summer celebration modern National
Day celebration I haven't celebrated I
guess the only thing I celebrate is the
uh
Christmas Christmas
Eve and the Fat Tuesday I guess you
could call it and until New Year's day
as well
I think that those are the only three
this is three that I actually celebrate
and well I guess I'll start to celebrate
the fun Fun's birthday as well but
that's not really a national
recognized holiday
or event
I remember that one
there are many cake I did not celebrate
nation that I needed but I did eat for
my first job fairs by then
I'll be celebrated by eating Starbucks
oh yeah Fat Tuesday yeah the first
Tuesday for the beautiful
a baked bun sliced in two with a large
amount of whipped cream between
whipped cream between
and then what is more uh
I don't know what it is not a suffix is
called let's make it recognization
we wish her weight when was Papa's
birthday
is
yep it's really good
I of course had that
this year
[Music]
I should uh I need to drop on holding a
similar
[Music]
baked bun with
a baked bun with whipped cream between
wait that wasn't concept a baked pan
sliced into with
whipped whipped cream in between that
was the description that's like the
majority of what assemblies but then you
have
uh
I think you put
on top of the whipping cream
I think it's no it's not it's below it
actually right there is some
additional thing which I don't know I
don't even know this which one for it
[Music]
a baked bun slicing tea with whipped
cream
yeah that's a great doesn't that sound
nice to say
[Music]
almond pulp a little bit of that in the
middle
yeah I think it goes like below the
whipped cream
um
and how its place it depends on who
makes it
I prefer it being like a proper layer
yes
yeah that's a good one
let's copy it because some things
and then I press that button to start
rotating
and then I need to delete these
maybe I should
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I will combine these two
yes almond paste is the best translation
translate Chong
yes status
yeah pulp
I associate with something bad
even though it's proper probably still
correct
[Music]
no it's not bad and yours is pulled for
like
nothing to use it for like juice with
pulp or something like that
although I don't like cheese with pop so
maybe that's my assistant with it being
bad
[Music]
so
[Music]
pulp is fictional
[Music]
I think yeah but for me it would be
orange peace
[Music]
well how about the apple juice with pulp
[Music]
I wanted to change it doesn't change
I think that we're annoying
[Music]
I guess it's going to be annoying
[Music]
I have ways around this being alone
[Music]
like this thank you
so that it does anymore
and then I just feel
[Music]
now that's the thing
yeah I feel
[Music]
perfect
[Music]
there we go
and then I just need to
[Music]
apply the cropping
[Music]
by the way this is
this is inside
this is
located wrong things
[Music]
perfect
I don't know if the amount that notes is
good
maybe I should notice
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay easy to see
maybe it could have been even larger
[Music]
of course means I need to redo this part
there's no problem
[Music]
very quick and easy
spinach
[Music]
that's good
opportunity of this one yeah perfect
[Music]
singing beautifully
use orange I mean orange oranges do you
use orange
[Music]
I was choosing
[Music]
in Spanish
[Music]
with beautiful voice
I bet she sounds beautiful
I mean that's why I made these notes
looks like these because I forgot to
make a transparently
because it's supposed to represent my
the quality of my singing
[Music]
it's probably not going to show up on
such a small emote anyway
people is going to see the dogs
perfectly fine as perfect in the world I
meant not fine perfectly normal notes
with nothing strange going around him
I'm still here
uh sing I guess if giggle is the other
one
I have a Yankee on me
sing
sing
and and no other bun
will pun
this one was approved immediately that
must mean they found their hand to look
a bit
garlic
okay I remember the GT glasses I just
added it
fill out a slot
the thing has been added
oh
I bet she sounds amazing no oh my only
one and only fun with the perfect fun
noise I'm back with my coffee perfect
timing now you can use it
it is neat and it is very milky
I forgot to
oh yeah
can you forgot the first one of them
I guess it's hard to see the notes
ah it's fine
the idea is still there
I mean you can see the notes but I mean
what's the the effect on the notes
yeah I can see the thoughts yeah but can
you see they've broken this after notes
that's kinda
hmm
it's really hard but nice to me then
it's not sweet I always be perfect no
matter what
foreign
nice words
are these four of them
and it's been four and a half hours I
think I think four of them
beautiful yeah see I think four of them
is pretty good you got to share here the
Laughing that's like that those are the
two most popular I mean
basically 95 of the usage is kitten but
but still and the remaining five percent
is oremian
laughs
compliment machine activating yeah yeah
very compliment heavy and I do
appreciate that
even though I'm about it
a better saying my appreciation
yeah the headpad will show up when they
approve it which whatever they do I will
check back basically before an extreme
if I haven't just remind me
but it basically just remind me in the
this card so they have basically more
than 24 hours to actually
because I would not be streaming
tomorrow
and I am tired again I was getting tight
[Music]
so thank you all
for your greatness
I made four of them's emotes I should
yeah I would draw it I wanted to I said
I had 13 slots so I can make old ones in
here and then one bonus and then I guess
I'll just
I don't know if she tried him because I
do feel like
I am getting better and better I would
say there is a slight Improvement for
each of these I made
good product one you did amazing
if you want to be really appropriate
appropriately it should be pon pon it's
like a double name I don't know
I mean if you want to use the princess
parties would be princess ponpon
foreign
[Music]
thank you
I appreciate that I mean without space
it doesn't happen
that's why when you see me type
me type and you should check the on
screen it actually says
that's how I wanted
I mean it says it
it's basically
what this does is that if it finds a
capital letter with a locust letter in
front of it it would put a space it's
just visual of course
and if it locations it takes the Z and
everything after I put in those
unless it's the first thing
I thought it was a clever system
[Music]
oh I see
in the Stream what you meant in
Charities are called yeah I can't affect
his twitch set
that's out of my control sadly
so
should we check how is streaming
you know who is streaming
