hello everyone

um yeah yeah that's a bit extra time for

me to get it started

I wasn't at home like

I came home half an hour ago so

I was hoping to get home a bit earlier

but

things didn't run that smoothly as I

hoped

um I guess I would have gotten home even

later if

things

actually went as I hoped

but he didn't

no I'm not going to play a fusion it's

going to be

spaniel Adventure

let's bring it up on screen

the adventure of spider

but let's let me get

really

comments

and my drink I have it here

uh warm day today

I've been doing stuff bro

[Music]

hope you have a fun day hope you have

Anthony I hope City I will be at work so

I will probably not be here today but

have fun I will talk to you later

hello kitten bye kitten

well and see if

I get to talk to you later

[Music]

and the hello water bunny hello water

I'll be here on enough

and it's sometimes what is here and

turned off not much still have that work

thing

[Music]

that works thing that sounds

okay

that's the way to die and so

um

I don't know what the word thing you're

talking about to be honest

so let's start from the beginning

[Music]

so

I almost got everything here apparently

it's 900 gems in single level in the

first level

and there's a spiral action figure so

there's two more things but there's

probably a few chests I complete them in

please

my designs

here and there are required action

quests

and that I got a few stuff and the only

one I've completed is this one and as

seen at the bottom here I have gotten

that

but as far as I can see is this a

Pikachu

and but yeah I'm not completing any of

the other things

and I

don't and he put your tent actually hurt

me

I don't think there's anything else for

me today I touched

with the enemies I'm supposed

let me see

because they could be still areas I'm

not getting visited

I haven't been here

[Music]

's me

I am trying to get up

it's up so low

I like there's a cat on the floor

and here we got

what you call them in English

which but it's black it's normally not

black

it's my point

yeah definitely enough here

yeah there's like that one

I don't know where else I could go what

is it this one here

there we go

this device has several little stories

in niches in it I guess it's used for

putting items in the water it's a part

of the machine we need to find for the

fire librarian

so I guess I just need to go around and

find the red chests I guess that's

that's what I would I would be doing now

all right it's one of the earliest one

right

yes

but it's called so with machine Quest

but it's for the

fairy librarian

no sneeze dusting Armature and that's

the last one

still don't like those a like the the

letter A can be written in two ways

the one way that's usually is not

computers in one way that's usually

handwritten but using both in the same

font yeah I don't like that

it's just it's his message went to my

brain though I can't handle it

let me just make sure I have

made out this area because there's ever

just here open already

[Music]

okay and then I need to kill again

sorry about that she

there's a pink one I want pinky pinky

there's a French chest

oh it's probably got stuck on me

tonight

excuse me

not everyone there we go and then jump

up here

there's another pink chest

[Music]

and then up here

[Music]

project oh yeah

no it's nothing up here except this

button

[Music]

you can try to just double check that

area

[Music]

and see if I clear it out I think I

yeah I think I shouldn't need to go

around and pick up on the red chest now

back

I'm getting stuck in a corner yeah he's

on a pink one in here but and let's go

back to the start now I I have to put

this in

[Music]

game but that brings me back to the

dragon Shores what is this quote

[Music]

Dragon nests reading

and let's just clear out this area and

see if there's

there is

a red chests I can unlock from here

oh they got so many

not many

creepy drawings now

so let's start with money bags from one

and it's cleared out nothing I guess it

was the only gems in there

I never picked up hopefully

money bags doesn't know who it was when

he comes back

no secret

our time

could be annoying if there's like one

secret left

[Music]

that

[Music]

oh yeah and then it should be uh

yeah here we go here's the ferry Library

let's see if there was any red chest in

here I can go through

this place should be uh

heated up now

but

oh no I fell down

I'm not even close to you

the key

let's just clear out this area

yes

[Music]

I guess this one brings me over there

which it looks like I should be able to

fly

[Music]

away

continuing on

you're gonna be the water problem in

here

that may be considered

taking care of that

Okay so

this is why we bring me over to this

island over here

there's nothing here

this one will

bring it back

wait a minute wasn't there anymore

apparently not I went give me back then

it was nothing here

just a big empty place

we are making a lot of noise

oh there's stuff here

miss this

really me

and it's right next to this island which

I just wasn't

oh yeah I'm not sure how misters

So Close by and everything

[Music]

no I thought that was

unless the enemies are same dads except

for the one up there which I haven't

reached yet

they're presently look but if I must

apparently have been moving

yeah that one where's the other button

it's up here or something I think

yeah there it is wait

let's go in and see if this uh testing

here have not opened yet

yes it is

quick chance okay

only gems but I want items

I mean in real life I'll take some gems

oh there's another one let's see if I

can

get to eat

oh yeah

it's

it's trying to take a screenshot

[Music]

Bianca how cute

it's so low picks disappear slated

I guess

[Music]

it's one of the toys the dragon is

looking for

Bianca toy I want one of those

thank you

[Music]

move up from here

the good thing I checked this area

the yeah okay can I

am I supposed to shoot this or something

yeah I wish I had a green chest

okay

or a pinky

how I mean

logically why doesn't Enlighten what is

the point of these

[Music]

I got the uh two red chest at least

[Music]

oh yeah we got another only chance

only gems

I can smoke some gems to empty

enemy should write down where I just

apartment

this area is cleared

to be cool hunter it is your soundtrack

to make sure

I wonder what that one can be

I I want to show the Bianca action

figure for Bianca and see what she's

action figure

yeah I think I cleared out this area

[Music]

and just see if those other just

anything

all right changing

[Music]

look up here there's nothing here

I'm

what is it what are you doing now

how interesting

[Music]

and this is just this area

and then it progressed to the actual and

area

primate Plantation

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

get lost here now

[Music]

them

today

and yeah

[Music]

what's this story

the dark area

okay so there's a green chest

should I write down the way I found this

stuff or

thanks

[Music]

[Music]

okay why didn't you tell me I was just

gone

this is the primates

and tension

[Music]

in bananas

is going to be and there's another one

there

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

if I'm going to go through every area

anyway

it's back I change

for you

what do you need

yeah

that doesn't seem very useful to me

let's go back

[Music]

now if I change it again

where do you live now

over here

[Music]

I think I need to change you

and then go here if I remember correctly

and then

do not change here

as I enter this

start to bring here

[Music]

I wonder if Engine line is how how do

you know

I think I've been in here

how is it going ages nine

no time to start Spike there are

hostages to be freed

om wait huh

oh I've not been here

apparently they've not been here

well

I got another level to do them

stance mission

thank you what does this sign say anime

how do I need signs

don't get spotted okay

go

all right

and this is just hiding behind like this

agent mom rescued

I presume the last one you rescue is

always 18.

you did a few

oh yeah I knew about it but happening

now

[Music]

all right

those back here I wish I could get a

cheap point

no there's a camera as well

yeah he certainly didn't see me fall

down from the pipe

there we go

now we're gonna be gemstone mix

oh

I'm starting out from this beginning

not done enough of that already

it kind of has a

green splatter on the ground

all right hot describe

I'll do that there's like

moving

uh

one one square in the background got

messed up

but when it comes to second one I need

to keep track of this

Eye camera

[Music]

Owen

[Music]

nothing no

oh it's so much so much stuff you have

to do before you

it's so easy to make a mistake now

what's that green thing on the ground

actually I think that's the effect that

place when you're doing the sucking and

it and for some reason it gets stuck on

the ground

for some reason

keep eye on the Eye camera

[Music]

I should have I should have walked when

I was looking down the way

there we go

agent 2 rescued

it's gonna be green tea

project Point yes

do a little dance here we go

he was playing gemstone instead of to

check myself

and there's a red

huh

I forgot I can't teach the um

I can't use the used vacuum singing

while I'm doing a double jump

okay

I basically have to

come on hello Levy

why however you wanted it to be said

this

I think

Hello nice to see you again

the point

playing some Spyro as 18 Lang at the

moment though but

don't worry unlocked because that's how

you open the door and you unlock it and

you throw it away

yeah it definitely should be able to

pick up the gems a big Lucy

drop down

there we go I have to press the jump

button

let's see

[Music]

to find

and the red key goes here

moving on to the next area

one of those

foreign

I accidentally fell down

okay but yes

where's this all right this is before I

got the

red oh

okay it keeps the door unlocked I wonder

if you can abuse that in some way

so

until next time

and failing at it

hello

no that's the wrong way

there we go

I got here before I hit Island

well that worked

okay

yeah it goes down all the way and it

goes up all the way okay

I don't know where I should be going

all right yeah this

it's fine I didn't this way

ended so I guess this was the correct

way of going checkpoint

then I'll continue this way now

stupid stupid monkey you were standing

on the platform

sometimes you feel like they don't drop

Gems by assume I've picked up the gym

yeah yeah yeah

as soon as the animation is over

now as soon as animation starts it drops

the gem

so because I was standing on it I picked

up the gem immediately

and it can only kind of play one sound

at a time

and there's the blue key

oh this is a shortcut pack so I don't

have to walk back

oh wait this is

the last

agent

if you you're the last standing

thanks again ignore this key path needs

to get to Spire could you take it to him

no problem I'll give it two Sparks to

give it to him when I get practice

it's in Thailand

only breathing

as everyone here's a heart I have a key

that you can take back this fire

that's voice vagina

easy one half of what appears to be some

kind of Chess key we have both half of

this key we can open green chests now

[Music]

let's open this one

oh some of us

this left glare is so big it could only

belong to a Yeti it's some of the

Bentley's climbing here

whoa now

don't don't put me there

he can get me back

[Music]

oh

that's how it works

it's not about to myself about them

there it is

I'm just kidding okay slight panicking

[Music]

money back's balls I want to see if

there was any

is it a pink chest in here let me know

that's on so it is money bags I don't

need to be that specific interests

[Music]

and then in here

I knew it was a green one

I have it in my notes

I like the only chance

I wanted tools

it's gonna burn it no

nope

have I discovered every area so far I

didn't know

[Music]

so

[Music]

I got those two

in the primate Plantation

[Music]

but I should check that's not the chart

but if there isn't

um

[Music]

anymore wait wait wait I don't want to

go here

[Music]

change it

[Music]

there we go

[Music]

and

[Music]

and you change it thank you no wait

I guess it has three modes

essential mode

other mode yes there you go

I already been up here well

does that mean

and now at least up to the other area

but why just sleep and this one is good

now

oh

is that how it works so it's three of

them are connected I can just switch

which two are connected and it has three

different modes okay I see

I understand

yeah

that makes perfect sense

[Music]

in the house

[Music]

I'm beating my own place I wanted to

like this this area I think I've been to

every place in this

[Music]

being

[Music]

yeah there's this

I think I explored

when I was a green chest in the fair

library library so I need to go back

there

[Music]

so next with this

evening

dragon shorts

oh yeah I kind of came that from there

so don't need to know what the sign says

switch back to fire

and let's go and find the green chests I

don't remember where it was

I don't know there is a green chest

I wasn't glitching

hopefully it contains one of the machine

parts

you're gonna say where are they and all

the enemies it would be nice if you like

remembers which I miss ahead

and that's

have you found the machine yes by the

machine

oh all its parts

we're still working on it oh dear I want

to remember to come back to see me when

you find it no sorry I'm going to keep

it for myself

I was it in the motorbikes Mall it was

looking in

but I don't remember

okay I don't remember where it is

oh there's this

he is a long rope made from Yeti hair

it's very strong it's some pelvis

climbing here imagine if like humans

made climbing rope out of human hair

and then I guess there's nothing wrong

with it he's just

odds to me it just sounds old

so

let's go back out

the help of the magical flaming fairies

oh

now just here

[Music]

let's go to

[Music]

dragon

for me

is something

there's any chests like in these areas

all right but there's a hole in the here

this is

scaled

there must be chests in here

I don't think there's any chest out here

there I can't really get up there anyway

that's a lot of lava

main Guild one

here it must be chests

oh did I miss this one

this one

wow I saw that was fast I'm going to

head to try harder for now

okay but where's the other button

foreign

chest

what's his last color blue or something

but there it is

all right you connect me I need more

practice

okay now I can activate both buttons

and see if there is any tests hiding in

there

chests

yes there's a red chest

with only gems

running green chest ah with the only

chance I guess it makes sense in the

Wonder Max mode with a lot of gold coins

and

use this green paper which no one wants

I'm not sure why he has it

[Music]

why don't you see here myself because

euro is not

Eastern Sweden

but isn't the

the hundred zero banknote the one that

is green

obviously it's not Euro it's

it's a fictional Dragon currency that

money box is trying to make here people

want bad

and it's not really going well it's a he

still no one who has it

there's an area I don't think I see

something through the explorment but I

think I've already done this one what

does it say if I don't already done it

page is nine it's probably that it wants

to be kept by another Mercedes but how

do I know if I'm completely

um

I guess if I do this and I don't get a

gem that means I've done it already

I guess that's a

that's one way of checking it

[Music]

yeah no don't feel like there's anything

else here

think

it's like two things left

[Music]

I think

yeah

[Music]

this is the Master Chief

who wants the staff

and then I've gotten so that's one of

the things now anyway I have two things

missing

[Music]

chest the princess Master Fork

contain an item

and those are the last two things I need

to pick up

think

let me just send this document so I know

where to look for it later

I'll save it in there

I'm saying here

a spiral Adventure I don't need to

okay with more specific than that

so let's continue

[Music]

that was the

anything down here

something here

oh yeah this was to the kangaroo please

yeah maybe

I want a triple jump

so I can get up there

underground plus okay

and here's where our bad news rip two

instilled one of his things

this is the dragonfly Oasis region

apparently what is the

[Music]

[Music]

another Channel

so many tunnels

this doesn't need anywhere otherwise

this is the branching off too much

no it is on a red chest which I've

opened

oh yeah this

morning bags

money back's mansion

so we got a hole in the wall

hole in the wall

foreign

[Music]

and why is Sergeant bird in

hey it's Sergeant bird

it's really weird spots and I'm going to

get them back away so one of these

rescules by the way

how do I determine

[Music]

I guess because there's no gems

I just wish to us a better way

permanent

exit

tablet covered in card writing probably

a bunch of old tourist jokes

hey

so there is one in between money Banks

mansion

war of majesty

in chest

rescuing more radiant I like to chase

yeah I think this area

so let's go back out

and seeing you

foreign

butterflies

[Music]

yeah I think it's like

here or something yeah there's mixing

the other exit from the mansion

[Music]

let's see here

Dancing Yeah there was water

I could accidentally from here too

yeah yes making sure I haven't missed

anything

[Music]

yes

so I can take this

especially why he sends I guess the

middle part is vibrating he doesn't want

to stand on page now he stays on it you

know

and now

around right into the pineapple

this is the cool place of all the cool

cheetah cheetah Sports Bar

thank you

it must be

cheetah spot Spa Fitness

Center

must be some kind of chests hiding

around here

she can't explore

dude maybe I should

get rid of those enemies they're making

a lot of noise

that they get

yes I'm looking for you groovy stuff I'm

sure that's exactly what I'm doing

cracking up here

is here

oh I won't

then I need to find some buttons

let's see if I can find some buttons I

just need to jump up here

this is one of the buttons

oh I didn't mean to

do that

sorry about that sheep I hope you can

let me see did I do this stuff mission

yeah I think I need

here I need

Christmas is just an easy way to check

search into nine levels but that'll not

oh yeah there is

check

upper area it looks fine

in this area

she does not know any restoring chests

there's a pink one but it's one of the

bank's fault

they still not me

cheetahs

Okay so

I spy around slightly minor

inconvenience

here I think I looked through the whole

area

and not much

for

eign

[Music]

thank you for the ride

but whatever you say

I didn't really listen

hmm

definitely don't remember what the voice

said

it's character but yeah there's this

area

[Music]

someone's slowly breathe

let's make a new one

not sure exactly what kind of water this

instant you can please

now specifically in that area nowhere

else

in The Legend of Spyro 2 you had the

ability to freeze water

and it wasn't restricted and it wasn't

the only water

and it wasn't

restricted to Dedicated areas you can

basically freeze any kind of water

anyway

hello kangaroos

make a green chest

uh Johnny gems

or keep the gems because I was

disappointed

is the kangaroo music

it's the kangaroo's

about that

you abandoned about the TVs but at least

there's no more rapes the team

oops

that wasn't the correct move

is this place

oh Money Bank

okay

so let's see if I can find

there's a red chest that opens

no buttons

foreign

chest okay so

I don't even remember what this place is

called

but there's a pink chest in this place

and I need to find where those buttons

are

is that that's the level of security oh

there's one that's level security has

two buttons spread apart

all right

and you have to be quick

pressing one and then the other

you can't

make a shortcut over there

on the installer button

one

normally it's where I started button

out there

okay let's check the bowl

money bags involved

and if there is uh yeah there's a big

chest

and then there's a big chassis up here

which is the the Outback

and I was only able to find one pink

chest

but then there's

oh invisible wall it got me

that they could talk so it just uh

whatever it did yeah you can just put a

fence here or does it put a fancy here

or move this further down so almost the

same

so we couldn't

think you can yeah and this thing came I

think

there's nothing here to collect this is

a really small area

back to the Outback did that reason

didn't even have a name he didn't give

name the Outback I guess no I respond

here okay that's not a quick way to get

back

oh

so many

pink chest I really hope I get Pinky

Next

I don't want to get a yellow key

it's the only funny Channel just

survives

okay

back

now

wait where will I respond ah there

is

a bit too on the trees

they use spiral

[Music]

[Music]

where where the icon

white where's this

I think they're explored every area now

so let's go back

damn

as you can see didn't get stuck no I

didn't and but this is what this area

so

excuse me that

to attach it

okay yes

let's go back here I haven't been here

in quite a long time

so this is

yeah

the

seven yeah

okay there's uh

came here that's a good start

but nothing in it

oh okay that's

all right yeah this one I need to freeze

the girl

and that's the way back

yet the alarm yeah it has been very

useful

[Music]

Frontier region

it might not actually be anything yet

oh there's a red chest

ah it's only gem

I was hoping that I would be able to

continue a quest two minutes just put

gems in them

oh another test

there we go there is this small Hunter

action figure

screenshot

these are smart Hunter X APK it's even

wearing shades

what has its same as screenshots

you can't do all right

[Music]

it's one of the times the editor is

looking for oh wait it's more voice do

return them to the internet yes we

should just find this missions

[Music]

where you start the button

my cousins jump

no

oh now

we need to go back here

[Music]

there you go

[Music]

what was the point of this area

anything else to you

[Music]

literally games really need uh

conversation initiated you should be

able to just press the button keep the

whole conversation at 10 to press T

spread through everything

anyway let's continue

yes wait a minute

[Music]

so

it must be two wallets I have not seen

yet

foreign

I found all the dolls

which is to one of these dragons I think

it is the bottom one

good news we found all the toys we can

we have the heart now but yes with the

Toy Story do you want to think twice

about the heart

it's a small

her please statue of a dragon looks a

bit like you Spyro

a pizza is basically inspired with a

bigger pink chest Maybe

we need to get this donut professor

and then I need to speak to you

it's very

not that many

it's very librarian also known as Zoe

[Music]

this one yeah I really need to find the

key

yeah yeah I know I used the wrong one

you don't have to tell me

um

okay

and she was like oh one set up

[Music]

levels

you know

and she was up here

yeah

we found out all all the machine parts

Zoe

can we have the heart now oh yes the

heart here he goes by it I hope the

professor is all right

while he would be more alright if you

just gave us the heart from the start

it's not like a beautiful only bound

book with a friend writing on it it's a

hard but it doesn't open

we need to get this to the professor

okay good so what do you have so far

yeah they love all the chests so yeah

complete this Quest complete this Quest

still have one left here

range hello

third one subscription

great

that's uh three subscribers subscribe

oh wait

this is the uh I'm really confused about

the house which subscription thing

this is your third month of the

Subscribe subscription yes I see yay me

yay for being subscribed for three

months I mean isn't it two months this

is your starting your sermons actually

actions and uh yeah I'm still learning

how

the whole thing

so many parts missing here

and that one is done so many questions

in there and there

wait

here I do

but here they are unknown for some

reason

[Music]

I'm really excited okay wait I swear

it's gone

that's just

yes that's a constant ability very spell

book

[Music]

and yet the lamp which I love you see in

the dark this one instantly escaping

changes a few times super breast means

is how are you today I've done so much

stuff today oh and I have to I was

driving from 82 three hours

and then I came home in like a half an

hour before I started streaming so I

this recipe

yeah this super nice breaths what a

holding thing made it spinning top

now this is the first human ability

[Music]

as banana pepper is the one that

shards you up the inflamability

[Music]

there's a butt slim ability which to me

doesn't look like about slam

apparently you need a scene to do that

and this is the one generating

electricity for by turning up

and this one gives another hit point to

Sparks

and the description of it is incorrect

raise it with the yeah

got two keys I have two left

bonus items

oh

trips actually Bianca actually

yeah

yeah

so

with everything I've done so far

I'm

I'm lost

this yeah I think what I have to do

is go to the yeti place and do something

with the uh

whistling caves

but I don't know because so far I feel

like I've Been Everywhere

I might go to check every

uh

[Music]

yeah I can't get up there unless I just

click Escape

[Music]

and doesn't matter where I use it I will

always be placed up here which I guess

is a nice feature and it's kind of like

here past travel I just wish I could go

to different locations

[Music]

you know um

drooling on myself

[Music]

laughs

so

it's I need to go here

So currently I'm gonna

stuck here I guess

I don't know what to do to progress

the other ways this way

so the only thing I have the only thing

I know I can do at this moment

is the uh

well I don't know if I actually I don't

know what to do so

but only honest mystery I have so far

that I have not sold yet

is the whistling caves

otherwise

I don't really see anything else I can

do

okay so this should be two more vents

and maybe the two more vents are

at least in caves

and the whistling games are

well whistling cave I guess noise

boosting caves apparently I go in here

and then this does this

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

oh wait

[Music]

[Music]

okay

that wasn't what I had to do

that wasn't even a puzzle I guess it was

a person okay

[Music]

okay

now we're actually getting somewhere

[Music]

literally

no actually

[Music]

okay that wasn't too bad I just

I wish I could do more stuff than just

[Music]

oh

[Music]

okay

[Music]

all right

[Music]

yes yes

I see

thank you

[Music]

yeah basically this should allow you to

use an impressibility as well as

charging

charging doesn't seem like as logical

thing to do

[Music]

this seems so special ah chest

oh gems I'm looking for obvious

oh there you go there's an object

this is a matter of what it's been

getting for rescuing other penguins

is one of certain Birds missing medals

um another one nice nice

oh on gems

[Music]

oh there's another one

I wanted gems wait then I'm stuck again

but

this doesn't lead anywhere there's no

uh

I saw one thing you know

anyway

um This was um that disappointment

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

it looks weird

when I went through the door

he's actually doing it but slam them

he's just easy to tell

instead

and who knows because a lot of people

are confused by the time of head bash

Inspire which is bad

and even if it was a butt slamming

Center that would cause less confusion

and against one athletes change

sheena's animation to watch slam as one

[Music]

so and now

I am yet again stuck

at least at least last time I was like

oh I

mean oh at least I have the whistling

caves which is just one game by the way

see

if I just figured that one out I can

probably rest

nope I think I said little but

it's not as much as I needed

[Music]

no one died

[Music]

at least enemies don't come back

there's like these um

yeah don't see what else to do now

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

music eight things

so there's nothing relationship and then

why why do they change what Bentley

looks like in every game

[Music]

without any good reason

oh there are a chance

fights

I I found something wrong

yes ma'am

chance okay

it doesn't really

exactly helped me

because I still don't have anything to

unlock Pinterest

but I got uh

not exactly sure how humans it's been

if I yes found it

almost too remaining peace

like

obviously if you can't you could do that

there to break it too they would just be

tested

there's this

I guess it doesn't make any sound on ice

us on snow

Queen is that game is weird

[Music]

[Applause]

oh you can't

charge it

oh

[Music]

at least it tells me when our ant starts

playing now it's just such an

improvement

but

it doesn't give you any

alerts before it starts playing

which isn't bad but it does sometimes

I might be

confused at the moment

during the Constitution I've been

oh yeah

I knew

[Music]

[Music]

the keys looks look identical just put

two key halves together and make it a

full key

does it have the matching color

s

[Music]

and especially with keys like these they

should be very easy to like

unlocked

I don't know what else to go

I'm a bit tired but

[Music]

you probably can hear my voice

I am confused at the moment

yeah I tried to jump with it before

uh what is this sign saying I'm just

going to try in this

this is the one and water behind it

big one

[Music]

I thought it was something beyond their

rabbit habitat

I would definitely not

and stuff soon away

smart ads

I came up here since

[Music]

[Music]

yeah I mean

[Music]

maybe I should

like obviously I don't want to

this isn't even anything up there

I think that's just the end of the world

yeah it doesn't let me get up there

maybe there's been raining something

after it

ready to show us the internet to go up

there

it would be interesting to like

break out of the world

[Music]

there you go

but I mean it doesn't really help

anything just up here

[Music]

and what is this pen staying here

oh

yeah I'm mad

I'd love to continue but I really don't

know where to go

no idea what to go

at least I can explore like this but

having a life accounting

[Music]

I fell through the sands

do anything

yep and so um

so um

so I'm yeah

[Music]

I I really don't know what to do at the

moment

I'm gonna you're gonna lost

[Music]

okay so here's my situation currently

I have um

so all of this stuff doesn't help me at

all Mac yeah there's the

guys some of these are pink chests and I

don't have pink key

so you guys do

these to determine where

I might have I like the missing as being

any help

[Music]

I complete this area

so there is but it can just be the pink

chest what's the pink test

no hmm

can't do that

should be 25 more gems somewhere

in the dragon Shores area

trench the hotel is shorts

well it doesn't start air conditioning

[Music]

[Music]

and if I

if I go here

this is still Dragon Shores so this

still counts as the same area

I can't do something about these

nope

the bonus this is the bottom of the

screen

but this is the same extent so here's

the edge of the this world

yeah

so I get a turn

yet

[Music]

and this discounted price

[Music]

and I feel like I've been looking around

this area a lot

foreign

[Music]

running against the open keyboard what

thing

I'll see any of you

open gate

go to the ground

[Music]

he plays with drugs like corners and

stuff and I wish it was a little bumpy

or lenient

foreign

[Music]

foreign

way to continue

professor's secret lab prototyping

section

here we go we found the professor 11

last that wasn't so secret so this is

why I continue that was so confused oh

well

[Music]

yeah uh yeah I'm working on it I'm

working

fun spider

be able to reach these yep

I assume

corresponding stops bouncing on the

fence

[Music]

how many I'm gonna go back in

foreign

no and I'm not the bestest

and I am in so much experience with

spider

but definitely not the bestest

but I am playing through every spider

Okay so

uh average skill level across all spider

games all right let's know

but I mean I'm not

that bad as Spider-Man is

I think that's something it's one one

and the celebration yeah I managed to

find words I was so stuck at the moment

that amazing performance

let's struggle with some games

it's a shame

the steam version you mean

oh you missed me oh I got you

no that's another one of these

die there you go

bye

oh I know

Sergeant bird is almost dead

[Music]

oh I need to run the red button now

well then time to play the other version

time to get a new pc

give me your old PC

I will after you write a 6000 Word

Perfect

[Music]

oh

well you got to talk to you

not know

3 000 word fanfic and just just to be

sure that Greg isn't going to do any

tricks make sure it's exactly 3 000

words

that are missing penguin

what's the what's the deal with these

oh yeah I I knew they would hurt if I go

into them but

now it's weird

Italian

[Music]

you ain't even the ones that spicy

you have quite who doesn't

who you doesn't

but I guess I'll go Indiana

we're just going to move in here that

doesn't help me anything

push me here

[Music]

oh it did help me

okay

let's um

make sure I get

didn't I explore this area

left

right or not

because as far as I know you can't bring

penguins with you so yeah I think Eric's

brother

through those things because

uh Sergeant bird oh it's like up there

[Music]

I'm trying to figure out where I am

[Music]

and also making sure I haven't

oh yeah

as sergeant bird is teleported too he

loses the grip of the Penguin and then

yeah the premium falls to the ground I

don't think I got everything now

well if almost drops you there I can't

think I did drop you but

there we go

let's

let's do some celebrations all right

actually hitting Estonia

come on work

[Music]

as I celebrate you

ah the last seven year

great work sir can you take this key off

do we found Magnus pyro sure now we're

better I better head back to the bank

where I left Sparks

I don't think I used this voice bird

before well we just might attack this

ski off spiral would you spark no

problem keep up you could work Sunday

burnt

dry knock Retreat Okay so

in the

rhinoc retreat

yes it's pink

it is one half of what appears to be

some kind of jet ski we have both halves

of this case so we can open purple just

now do you even know what purple is does

this look like purple tea

and that explains why all the five gems

in this game are purple no

because in the first game they were blue

in the second game they changed them to

purple and they were purple inside game

in this game they are pink

but they call it purple

oh stupid game and that explains why

when you use the color changing

abilities but that's what's given to

spiral when you pick up a pink gem

spider turns purple

yes apparently it's a part of the gym

no I was only eight gems okay so there

is a yellow chest

left

[Music]

okay I really don't like

yeah there's the young one

so I don't really like how many

these there are because it's going to

confuse me so much

ah nice

another pink chest another yellow one

what does this one contain

I don't know

this white powder helps bananas ripen in

half the time is one of the fertilizing

ingredients we need to find for the

monkey working

there's another yellow chest here

the confusion yeah because the thing is

another yellow chest

I'm having notes Here for where I find

all this stuff because yeah meet me

making my own notes is fan fine right

this is okay so there's one button here

here is where I was

guys the thing is these changes what it

leads to and as far as I know

there are no I don't I I

come on name

don't be so silly

[Music]

yes these are like

yeah he reaches far for those gems now

so

yeah

so if I claim that scene for some reason

and you believe them

they laugh

it's changes which they are connected to

but now I go here instead

so if there's a

and then

no

can you

can he

just die

there we go finally no not another one

friend he's there again

yeah I need help us now

so this oh there's the button so you

press

this button

s wait wait how do I get to the other

place

I take this one I think

yes

and then

there's this button oh I did it

hopefully I can clean out this room now

so I don't have to kill any oh Roxy's

welcome

and I actually out of it oh no it

doesn't really just tell me that I'm

back here

and I'm actually out of hydration thing

I think I've gone through no level now

and yeah it looks like

oh sorry about that Sonia

I hope we didn't hurt your butt

foreign

[Music]

Sparks

better than I was changing voice every

time

this is one half of what appears to be

some kind of jet ski we got both halves

of these Keys we can find a open gel

chest style finally

going in finally

cool is part of colorful powder makes

you red instead of purple you can use it

for the bonus item painting jump okay

let me guess there's one for Red Green

and

yellow and blue

yeah because purple would be the purple

gems that looks like pink gems

and let's make per reset spiral back to

normal money

but now I need to get the

a bit

half again

keep it heads

this means I don't need to track the

chest anymore because I can just

open them as I found them

so this is one of the buttons

okay wait I can do this I don't need

both hats

together

but the button isn't here the button is

here that's it I don't need both hats

I mean statement was still true

yes let's open this gems stuff in that

oh

this is a very old pattern made by

primitive kangaroo which is long ago

this is one of the kangaroo Museum

Express when he finds for Sheila

otherwise she won't give me us the item

we need to rescue

the world because apparently there are

the price for the museum is more

important than the

safety of the world

but that's how

that's how kangaroos be

Okay so

I went back very quickly as I wanted to

open that those doors

so let's see what's there anything more

out there

yeah it has for some reason are very

easy to move

but uh

not bombs

because I have this this

and this thing here

where will it bring me

there

oh someone's trying to thank me

so much treasure

no much stressing but you're trying to

tell me

on my chest

[Music]

point

wait a minute

not that

okay let me activate the

I just realized I wanted to be

yeah one of the one of the baby dragons

hair did the magical dust powder thing

no yeah I don't think they should have

it

uh ads

money bags who's meeting you here Spyro

I've been a real Jammy for you this time

are the painfully low price was one

thousand six hundred gems anyway oh

why why not everybody says person all

the time wait for what what why

why would I pay you

like why would I be

what part for this unique item if you if

you got to 1 600 ships Ah that's funny

yes

brother you should always such a good

customer huh the magic does in this bag

makes you go instead of purple spider

uh that's what this was you you said you

selling me medic powder

money bags yeah I can turn gold without

it

it can go and I didn't use it and why

did it give the ring warm first

when he became in the rainbow one last

what does this Soldier say anyway

spiral there is a crazy looking rhino in

there watch yourself

oh yeah I'll take a look

okay that is a crazy looking rhino

[Music]

stop

all right there we go

it has been gone

let's explore this area

that's that's a perfect one like pink

but I really wanted to see

the blue one I want to activate this

thing and look at the blue ones

unless you're finished trying and that's

not the voice

on my turf why I cannot be defeated

and Professor we finally found you

the spiral watch short for that maniac

yes you've certainly found him but he's

beyond your help as you can see

I think rip though you've been defeated

before and wouldn't be a game while I

possess the heart of my Chateau I am at

my most powerful behold

okay but spark Spire has like Boomer

now

am I like

supposed to

yeah oh wait I can't even leave place

I need to defeat you somehow

okay

now

you don't need to do much damage

kinds

and with wind

wait maybe I can

brush it up

no maybe I should use it on one of the

none

I think I missed

now

well I'll continue

I mean that was amazing

okay and I need more power more healthy

okay this doesn't seem to be the thing

to do

exit area no

okay

um

I do want to leave

I don't want to be in here I don't even

know what I'm supposed to do so that was

supposed to find all the hearts I have

not found all the hearts in

and being in here I can't really collect

the remaining heart no

I can't do the Quick Escape then I have

to

walk all the way back

but that's fine that's fine

okay

um

plus I had the whole order and you

haven't explored yet as well

so you know what

because it has been three hours of

gameplay now

I think only two hours for nine minutes

I will

explain

I will play slightly more I guess

foreign

looks like

[Music]

but I will probably never see that

how they like it probably

[Music]

oh pink one

[Music]

ah this is brown this brown primer style

is the sauce and infuses with nutrients

this amount of fertilizing is we need to

find for the monkey more care

the monkey marker

some Monkey Business

people ready to run

stop doing that you're evil enemy

let's see

what is proud to eat banana with tougher

opinions make but better living quarters

it's one of difference

for now I get

I'll try to say oh and now

uh here is like hey this dragonfly Wing

looks cooler than even my wings no fair

the Cheetahs will probably flip out

now that they basically put every Quest

item in here

no it's just some more gemstone

oh there you go this is blue spire

my God please Spyro

[Music]

oh that was red again

and that was perfect again

yeah there you go there's this bar again

well I got to see a blue spider looks

like

and it wasn't too exciting I guess

let's see if I can open that

needs to find two buttons

that gem there there's one but oh

there's one button there

you know a bit confused here

is one button here

it seems to really runs around

foreign

but the buttons cannot be in different

rooms they must they must all want to be

in this room

I still dictates by the spider game

[Music]

they could have they can't change the

rules others thought about them

except today button that had to be in

this room

according to dreams of spider

I still have my Skylanders really

inspiring oh

I do want to play Skylanders but like

you know the whole figure stuff does

make it a bit tricky

Professor secret lab with Moneybags want

oh my God this hand carved Boomerang is

very old and paint with fancy designs
