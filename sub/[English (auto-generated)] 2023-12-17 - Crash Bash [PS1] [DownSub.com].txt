many black balloons keep changing

color no I hit the balloon I wanted this

balloon there we

go I wish it would consider the balloons

to

be

mine

it's kind of hard to see my

position stop changing the rotation

there you go I like that no

stop ah this is quite a hot challenge I

think the close has been like four

points yeah I have to pick

um yeah was like

three

messages okay let me take something to

some

hydration

so

P don't about the SP spammy alerts day

even attempting that's

fine no I touched the red

balloon there you go being so rude

come on no that's not the one I

wanted no I want that

though I want the one that I

want I want the powerups that sucks the

balloons in

nice no stop removing my

balloons TR to change direction I

that me change

color

time up uh I kind of need to be lucky

here CU I needed to change my color

often 3 2 1

go

well not what I were looking for no

that's the blue b blue not black

one

you're not getting any but that's not

exactly what I wanted

anyway okay where where is where is

everything

where is the all the

balloons time up

ter I can't win this challenge if

there's no balloons to pick up

go

hey wasn't Wen I knocked into the

box why don't I get it

then come

on all right tou the red

balloon

come on they're so aggressive against

me they so nice and kind to

them

the

yes now come

here that's what I want that's what I

need time up

but this still not my best even though I

got

that

this ad Mission are kind of [ __ ]

yeah time time limit is to short

considering how slow you move on

this how

much come on no so while you're

Invincible you can still not touch the

do

balloons having like four opponents is

really really tricky oh go not splashing

I mean that

works that's not the one I

wanted that's the one I

want hate the red

byut that's the one I

want oh come on I was being chased cuz

they are so

rude

time up eight that's

good I basically have to go for

the

2

go vacing cuz it's cleaning a vacuum

it's cleaning with a vacuum

this not supposed to have a looking

for

there we

go they're so

aggressive like CeX he just chasing me

for some

reason had no reason I mean reason

didn't want me to have the power CU you

lose power you get

attacked uh going I hit the red but not

the yellow one

he can focus on picking up balloons but

no he just wants to attack

me now it's off to me

again

no

no like C is just going around and

attacking me he doesn't

like he could go well he has picked the

most

balloons I think I picked

more why do you always seem to be

against no I'm I'm not

not I

mean maybe it can I mean I'm

jumping and also I have the power up

that doesn't the rotation doesn't affect

me like okay yeah I'm going against

rotation but there's nothing else to go

for I now I had to power up that

otation

[ __ ]

H like this

balloons

no like and then CeX just comes to the

yeah like I got one balloon where's my

there two balloons

wow now I got all the

balloons one my BL

are yeah why can't I get

that I I mean

that

yeah this is kind of

terrible time

Up 3 2 1

go

missed

and the

tent oh

nice come

here just that

oh missed

it come

on yeah that help

me yeah this is going terrible time up

ah what a stupid game

mode 3 2 one go I'm never going to win

this haven't they didn't they never play

test this game mode or

something

see haven't they can't they see what

trouble is or did they make a change to

the game and then they play test it it

just fine and then they changed it or

something that's not what I want come

on did I

knock hit the punk

balloon

finally I did power up I

wanted another Power I

wanted that was

mine try to get it

okay good come balloon one

wow many balloons aortic comes here they

attack

me have nothing and the last balloon the

last balloon yay 1 second

remaining even though it felt like a p

like said the one for a while but so it

is better than tanks now at least tanks

are that can win because the opponent

can attack each

other and the first one wasn't

bad

yay

dancing it was due to the requirements

that made this

bad getting a certain amount of points

within a time limit was what that's what

made it

bad not even the computers could do

it I think in the other game modes where

you have you have to achieve something

within time limit the computers are at

least able to do

it avoid bursting balloons that are not

your okay this seems

easy I mean considering how many times

I've

failed oh there's the B

yeah it's not easy if they destroy my

ballons St attacking

me I just have to be

careful nope Coco died you

fail a it

yes

wh almost dropped

it I was doing pretty

bad 3 2 1

go there we gotic stood on

it wait no I move too far you fail why

is this such a long death animation just

dies and lays there for a while and

then and then after a while

the the Char realized oh he dead H canel

the game oh no I didn't mean to you

fail 3 2 1 go

under there are powerups that I know

like

this well that was

close no I want

that okay so there are black

balloons nice crusty me

then

wait didn't I destroy I guess he stole

it here you

go

nice come on stop changing colors I'm

trying to pick up

them

come here come here there we

go oh that was

close stop destroying my

balloons that I'm not in I'm not even

close

to at least I only need to win one

but very important to get the correct

power up do too much RNG in this game

mode you need the correct powerups you

also need your balloons to spawn that's

that's my current that's my current

problem at mode I don't even get my

stuff to

spawn no don't come here and attack

me I'm is suck

and what am I supposed to do you don't

get any reaction time for when they

change the colorful balance 3 2 1 go

what am I supposed to

do guess this game mode is terrible as

well guess I just have to

keep eye on

them going

fory okay now head

Del miss going to distract

them a

fan going to have distracted in

more here we go you

win

W with the r power CC but

it's he a man

if you even get the powerups in the

first

place okay so normal game mode win two

times in a row shouldn't be hard

considering what I've gone through at

the

moment this is a like compared to some

of the other game modes 3 2 1 go this

one is almost easy the easiest of

them this just the normal game game

mode away from me

cortex

oh come on a TCH attack you I guess the

power up was almost over

anyway I just what you laughing at

ch

H this working

team hey CR how rude just attacking why

is Crash so small and now it's drinking

you he me even

smaller is kind of small compared to C

in this

game 3 2 one

go no I didn't try to touch touch

it

and opponent seems to ignore they're

supposed to be smart computers but they

seem to ignore that the colors have

changed and they still try to pick up

their what what like they still they

still see see it as their own balloons

regardless and try to pick them

up oops the wrong

balloon

where are my

B come

on why is he so quick at

attacking all the black one after

one

there we

go I have a good lead at the moment

so all of the balloons I wanted

them think they have faster attack

because it's

directed yeah

probably they do have

different

Coco should have a punch

Ki why am I missing a

crystal I have 21 crystals that makes no

sense there's a lot of levels in

this must have missed one in the earlier

ones or something

anyway let's save the

game also it stops them

um I guess I guess it doesn't stop

Coco okay let's see boss

battle thank goodness you have made it

this far I now believe ukauka has been

fooling us you must succeed in the final

challenge before why do you think he

been fooling you have won it makes you

think

that bun Bell yes let's see if this SP o

if you want to redeem the S you can do

it now just not before the stream

starts face and the feet no side okay

okay wait how how do I do this then go

turn this turn this shoot

okay there is your health

bar yeah I have a health bar why am I

supposed to shoot

that I can shoot that

does whoa whoa

whoa

okay I can't go over that how am I

supposed to know what the maximum up for

down

is can I activate uh tur

button

you have to shoot those quite a lot

before

they okay this is going to be

hard what did get what you said

what I have no idea what you're talking

about

now that's quite hard to destroy

oh

try

you doesn't feel like I'm getting closer

or anything but I guess you have to do

this a certain amount of

time

something happens when I'm

Ching oh come on

like I'm going to wear out the

controller if I'm going to like spam the

button

so where do

I you should be able

to be able to

set

like

that 3 2 1 go

this is not as fast as I can push whoops

that die why wasn't that the insta kill

it's almost the insta

kill 2

1 okay I could probably make it a little

quicker but it's not as it's not like as

quick as I

do but at least I don't have to wear out

controller I said it to every fifth

frame okay let me let me put between

those two and I think that's good then I

might

be I think go this many Minis that was

every third frame the are important okay

this is this is a better

compromise between not being able to

have spam why this isn't why you have to

spam the button in the first place I

don't know didn't they test this game

before they released it and why can't

shoot the side I was see

first didn't they test this

game that's the thing that's going to be

confusing me all the time when I play

games didn't they test the games when

before they release

them is that the bottom how am I

supposed to know

that didn't they test this

game

yeah can't shoot missiles I want to

shoot

missiles yeah you don't have much space

in

space

oh probably tested on their own crew and

overlooked it

know are you calling me

stupid no I I meant

like didn't they like test oh it's

annoying having to spam the button why

don't we do it so you can hold down the

button and Rapid

Fire like something like that they no no

one has tested that and see that no it's

annoying to have to spam the button to

shoot there also wearing out the

controllers uh in uninformed on this

very specific scene I'm I have no idea

what you're talking

about are you saying

like okay let's let's take for example

at this moment that in this game mode

you should not be you should not be

required to spam the button you should

only be need to hold down the

button I don't know what knowledge has

toch that that's something they should

have realized in

testing it's

weird

this Isis oh right I got you

s do many missiles and I I can't avoid

okay okay what's that

level oh no crashing into the

planet

oh oh no it's back to this okay let me

I switch I need like a rapid

fire version

of um there we go that's how we clear it

and now switch back two regular controls

I need

the where is the camera so

no not used to this camera

mode no not a

ball

no fa e there why is the camera so low

at least I don't like to start over but

yeah that is clear I say yeah

that's that's the part I'm talking about

there nothing nothing to do with

knowledge or skill just it's a bad

sign I know I lost the

ball and also why is

it

I mean I'm already bad at this game mode

don't have to introduce mirrors mirrors

they

terrible yeah and then need introduce

red balls I mean like how okay how am I

supposed to defend myself against the

balls when you have mirrors mirrors

missiles

Mir and an opponent oent that doesn't

left a

single wait I wait what's what's going

on what's going

on he he finally let one ball through

you asked if I said you were stupid I

answer and I was

what and why they would Overlook it

being bad I I know I

I'm I'm being annoyed at this stupid

game oh let one ball

too

than b

it

like how am I supposed to supposed to

defend myself against the balls and

misses

and this is I did better this time but

way too much to keep track

of

the computer is way too good at so I say

zable

like I can't stop the ball from going

either I let I get hit by missile or and

take damage or I let a ball through and

take damage you fail that ball was going

across the whole area how I supposed to

avoid

it test this

game you

fail I think the game fails 2 one

go I mean you take little damage from

balls but but

still

and at least they did it do the DI if

you need to do everything one go well

yeah at least you did consider

that I didn't even defend against that

one

hey that's it te that's not how physics

works okay he's soon dead now it went

very easy probably maybe this difficult

scale on the final bus but nowhere else

in the

game

it cannot be what sort of trickery was

used to defeat I the great

UK no triggering no cheating your secret

plan to steal the crystals has

failed of course I knew

and they went

you why is the game quite all a

sudden I have not had this happen before

why the cut 17 seconds 17 powerful to

leave lying around they are safe once

more that is all you need to

know I want what is

mine I believe that can be

ared what is this the for disturbing the

crystals my

brother so he

was

ejected down into

space now we're looking for the section

that says testers and those are the the

people to to

blame here we go the main St is

complete off for cut scene at the end

there got the only

disappeared the assurance manager qual

the

insurance yeah quality I mean the game

has quality just certain moments there

is that good need to be

tweaky

additional mini game design I mean what

other design is do in this

game

now we just need to go back and collect

all the

relics

and let me check what count is sense

in

all trophies death Crystal and all gold

and

platin oh no there are

Platinum playing

no

oh okay

so PL no relics

alone this worth twice as much as the

trophy Crystal Gems and gold relics to

get

it so this is the first word person

yeah this were fine wait what where am

I you need something okay so this is

we're fine special work okay let's

see

I wish it said which war it was

somewhere okay time to go back and 100%

game which was my goal okay so it has a

very similar SE it's just that this part

is the SE of the fifth war

room as like this it's just win the game

two times in a row

how do I get Platinum Platinum should I

just redo the gold one and get

platinum and instead like against even

harder

opponents yeah I win two times any 2 one

go easy easy I can do this look at

this ignore that that did not

happen okay I'm already

losing that's just me

oh I that

one at least they don't seem to just

attack

me both those opponents are attacking

me they're not clearly attack me every

time why

me I so bad at this

game

Ed to play this game mode at least

camera angle is higher up in this

compared to the boss

battle no

don't let

it no unless

it oh you

fail okay that was a warm up

okay 2 one now now for the real

round

okay

yeah I'm try to defend myself against

that ball and let the other

one

oh

no he used unfair bouncing

BS

no no he boun off do

ball okay I take

that okay the computer are playing much

more fair now no they're not just

attacking

me and the referee came in like hey you

can't you can't you can't just attack F

only like

that that that looks like we all on a

team and that's that's not

fair this is why usually

Sports when you have interaction between

teams or players that you do one on

one oops cor is there we go you

win you want to warmed

up do

I are you feeling warmed up when you get

get to see

me maybe I should wear a hot out for you

then no I was so closer to stopping that

everyone Dro one

more

when you when you when your balls

drop

ow oh

ass there ah yeah I knew to C like zero

he's not supposed to zero

oh

I'm guys I seted to write how long it

was the next ad and it considered the to

be the upcoming one which is

in

because currently

playing

no unlucky bounce

no

well I guess I have to manual right for5

minut

then but if I play an ad

earlier I wanted

to

this is z minutes that's a good

deal who do who doesn't

want gives

you 57 mean and free game

play I mean it would be Weir wait from

Z

any so let me

um

and

let me just do a

check oh it shows up as a separate

option

okay see I have I have to collect all

the gold

relics and then the Platinum relics will

show up

but PL Relic is as I assumed now three

rounds instead and even hard

confus confus are not hard it's it's

unfair challenges that

hard

okay now it's going well go too

soon I mean I'm still in the lead so

well much for being in the

lead too

of

and I okay

wait did that b just

disappear no unlucky

bounce okay the tank

out I'm out fail

okay getting 100% in this game it is

going to be hard at least I completed

it the game is not uncompleted at least

at least I have

that oh hey what kind of Bounce was

that

like I computer attacks me or

they POS over to someone who attacks

me

mean doesn't exactly

Happ

oops

oh

three Bo of them the

short oh

St who I st

that

they

don't this

out so now it's just me against

the no you fail and it was so close to

failing

too oh so close 3 2 1 go

okay winning two of these in a row it's

going to be imposs I won one and then I

failed

ni

I mean at least part is Dro

on that can't that can't

like let one

for every time computer let one that

would require me to have three

times health I guess compar to

computers is already out

w

no you

fail 3 2 one go it's always the B games

I get stuck

on I did get stuck on that balloon game

for a while but balloons are kind of

bull shaped so it's

okay come

on can of bounce with

that hope that's nothing in

wings that was the first one

for

okay it's throw the balls all all over

the

place

H is gone

just there we

go just between me

Anda and there we go a stupid bounce of

a ball made me lose you are too greedy

for balls I don't want the balls I want

to get rid of of

them here we

go

no

no oh

my now he attentionally

attacking

no another

one oh nice he's already

out

come on CeX yes you win

H I still want to do this without using

like sa safe State I could make a safe

State and just continue from here

but right did I do

that than on everyone

It's

Tricky

no

no I'm adding so much commentary see all

the

W strange

physic okay oh

okay W strength physics again kind of

hard giving a d on the bones when they

not mov like they

should

that's

not oh how did I let two B yeah yes I H

it why does it wind sounds sound like a

Fame

sound

yay all of them

how was the do a safe St between

challenges that's

just to ensure that the game doesn't

crash or

something okay 2 1

go

come on everyone is attacking

me now I all of them are after

me W that that was

close me bit at this

where

okay take that oh maybe

not

no no he jumped

off night nice nicely done that cortex 3

2 1

go okay I'm back to nor don't bully me

anymore you fail thank for bullying

me have to start over now two one

go I think I had like a lot of problem

with these first

one but after this it became easier or

something

oh this one let's pick one

of these there we go oh thank you for

you fail

oops think for taking it from me but

then you knocked me off

go now we

surrounded oh oops I tried to move out

ah

oh

no I'm stay here in the

middle this is supposed to be a hard

computer yeah as soon as cortex no

longer

was stopped going after

cortex cortex why you

bad

there you go oops I

miss how is he just

St I'm so bad at

this here we go doesn't matter who has

it you fail except me of

course 3 2 you mean go

stage

okay

oh I'm find me

I'm tiny

tiny go I guess I'm small there's

character called

tiny that's so I two kids but

okay why you chasing me why court is

always against me

o here you

go tou tou

tou ah

no pretty quick finish

one come

on ah

of course when the timer runs out I will

lose because the game is not

fine he can't consider the

time you fail now it's just a

fail 3

2 I know a lot of PlayStation One games

where it's quite unfair because if you

if it it's at

draw the player LS okay every time I try

to be

Happ fa is a l

one fin yeah there there's a few Play

One games when if you draw and then

going have to get this

one he just

cheating

you

fail 3 2 one

go

go

I don't think you will hit by stand

close oh freck

me

well don't put me at he

it that my chance to win 3 2 1

go I might not be good at attacking but

I I feel like I'm good at

avoiding not perfect but

B

again now come

on you fail I not good at

attacking 3 2 probably because in this

game mode it's kind of it's easier to

avoid than

attacking oh iyle

time Kong and dingodile are the two

characters that are just named after

theal

gu

not fun that squished I'd much rather

squish

pun you want the squish pun pun don't

you

no's TR

here he way too

s yeah they like these not going to go

strike for 10

minutes we

cheek go all cheeks every everything

that you can call a cheek switch

everything oh you can keep that

one no needs three of those and then

win yeah I don't want to fight you oh

now I want to fight

you now I'm

being oh

B

no wait I don't want it you can keep

it you can fight between each

other me out of it okay cortex you're

always against me for some reason it's

almost like you're an

evil it's so bad at piing have cortex

no C is

Big you

fail preferbly both but up you to not

have ination for the I mean that's

disrespectable no

than

oh falling off

there I got do the one

but it's definitely eat it on the level

which uh tilts CU as soon as you get

go thank you for pushing me

away which also means that you wasted

your

Boost hey he started

moving oh thank

you before even the sound started

playing it wasn't because it's started

attacking me he went for the

laser there you go you win that's how

you

win but yeah if you if you really want

to squish the lower cheeks on p p that's

exactly what the f is

for come on take

this and then we hand it over to

Tiny no I I mean it was going to take up

someone anyway

so it's

fine okay I guess this is a loss

then needed three and also needs to be

that power up

too or this power up too oh wait what

happened

no yes

shielded

Ah that's the power I'm looking

for why supposed to knock you

off

like I don't have enough time for this

to

strike you

fail when is there time

limit 3 2 one

go

oh wait

that don't need it they just need to

stay away from the opponent the has

opponent attacks the closest

one

it doesn't barely do

anything you

fail prefer bir wait probably not prefer

me probably because the Bots would kill

each other without time limit and then

it would simply be play Waiting for BS

to kill

the I mean that's what I'm

doing I know what you

mean

ah

ah

ah can't

oh

you three 3 2 this is a surprise why I'm

getting ready for work I'll back when

I'm making I'm not sure surprised I

think I told you that any I didn't tell

you but I'll tell you now then during

this

Christmas uh weekend I don't know yeah

right if you hurt me wait if you can't

hear me don't hear me saying that

you

I

un

no I don't want

it you

fail s Swing Swing Swing 1

go yeah like what I need is

like

what do you have against me

cortex you

fa at least like they're attacking each

other 3 2 1

go how they just chasing

me

okay one

done no nothing

can come on [ __ ]

oh

gang stupid

ice tiny was

Tiny there makes

M micro

taging

go all right just need to keep

away watch

out you're the player I am the

player 3 2 1

go I should probably give up on 100% in

this game is going to be too

hard I really finished the main story so

cuz then I have to redo these three

computer computer is so bad taking out

each

other

no I don't too tiny this isn't helping

me this is a waste of

time I want proper

powerups I can take out the

opponents I need a good first

one why are you after

me you fail at least this level can

quickly start by 3 2 1

go

thanks so this is where they want for

the second round why are you chasing

me I you have a much better success rate

at targeting the all the computers

because

oh

you and then comp just does that just

knocks me out with one

punch with one hit I wish I could do

that it's probably some

picni like sometimes they

fly

stupid okay now you did corect

when are you attacking

me 3 2 1

go the

power Computing

you these

computers yeah I think I'm I need to

give up on this

game if I can't even win the second

level

okay that to like 30

seconds 36 seconds 2 1

go no you was so close

kn

just need to be further away

from hold

on I am protected by the

ice I can actually win

this

so I was going to change the game and

then then I

okay no I missed so much for wi this

there you go finally you

win I won

it still have to redo it one more time

to do three wins in

AOW against brutal

difficulty maybe I should go and

cry at least I got everything now still

one crystal that's

missing did I give up on some Crystal or

did I just forget about doing

it

it's

win yeah I mean this one is Easy 2 1

go want

Miss guess

had only Ser going kill T no I didn't

want to

beide thank of me

Sho oh

no oh I got

that

no

appar serve that square

already oh

nice no people Miss spawn right in front

of

me

nice I'm pressing to this side nothing's

happening an official three that

is

terrible dpad on

it Xbox one has a better dpad on

Playstation yeah CR still had a lot of

points oh

ads 2 I'm back sorry about the

ads hey computer would be hard if you

give them power up like

that

he

attack now I just

need those my

squares where's there we

go

oh keep track of how many times they

attack

the other

against oh there's

one soon as I get Sho I get when I are

forced to pick up on me

side either due to the game is spawning

and side is St in front of me

or that the controll just

TTI I mean I kind of jump that

but you

fail yeah everything was against me

there kit doesn't get that great I keep

disconnecting oh

jumping on my

SP see that they have

S at least I got use to sh this

pain well uh yeah avoided that son just

try to attack me

that

to um now just jumping on all of my see

all three computers attack me there

they're all against me that's not how

this is supposed to

work it is not supposed to be everyone

against

me

yeah and everyone get

Spees W I finally

got you

fail yeah it's it's it's very hard when

everything is Stu like they're cheating

this is just this is just cheating they

they are on team with each other that

was not established

in I'm finish working together found a

thing

as soon as I have

some yellow squ they want to take them

out yeah they look they're following my

life as soon as I speech to get full

attack

on

I no I don't have

on

the miss

me yeah can I get

some and then they spawn oh they go

finally but I don't have any squares

left because they they keep jumping on

my squares cuz they're working together

like they they're not jumping on each

other's fing

I but when I made the

comment youil they were not jumping on

the h s they were jumping in line next

to each other just covering uncovered

squ okay okay now I'm jumping

on each

other

no I

didn't I guess you res serve that

square

well and I mean at least that makes

sense

I need

to I mean this time when hat butu is

kind of terrible in this game why always

win he's always I think he's doing time

when this game

up give me

spe

no I wanted to turn me come want

turn is

stupid yeah both went off to

me he stood this but I couldn't see that

pre just taking my

sings it's

mine I'm going finally go

to wow wi

finally and see was the

worst

yay no we don't celebrate by stealing my

clothes that's not a good

celebration

celebrator jacket throwing I wasn't

wearing a jacket I was wearing a swim

seat that that doesn't sounds

embarrassing are you enjoy it of course

you

did you celebrate by throwing a piece of

clothing oh you wearing a swimsuit well

I guess you have to throw that anyway

moving on H bunnies no there was no

bunnies I'm a

bunny it start the same

function 3 2 this game mode is not that

good some of them

have everyone is throwing it at me

stoping okay now I actually attack

the

you

fail you keep attacking me 3 2 one

go but all all all three of them are

just hacking

me stop it

so rude I mean at least I was closest to

you see they they all

attack everyone is attacking me you're

supposed to be freefor all

here you fail yeah I'm failing because

the game is cheating it's supposed to be

F not everyone against

me everyone is throwing it to me

finally some so monr by someone

else it's

me you

fail

yeah yeah in this challenges in The

Relic challenges which has nothing

time despite using the

time the opponents are actually

randomized well they aren't randomized

they're pre

determin which I said they were before

too but before they were predeter based

on which character you pick now they

determined by The

Challenge wonder if they

because like if you were to pick one of

the three characters that they are you

fail come on don't look

left I guess they have a fourth

character that replaces the one that

you're picking at

this it does remind me of a game where

each character has a primary

color but H some characters have the

same color because there's too many

characters in the game

and and if one character head has pick

the

color and the character has to pick it

the character gets its secondary

color and if that color is only pck it

gets it it's

one primary secondary character here

like

piss but if that color is already picked

H the game

crashed I guess they didn't pick up

four4 colors because they didn't think

that would

happen come

on you fail no both time the same

time if he just didn't pick up that box

3 2 1

go oh wow he didn't thr at me at

once the other two did though

but

I landed on

it 2 1

go strong at me okay that wasn't aim at

me at

least with all those people aimed at me

I mean at least up close this

time oh

nice oh was

still

so slow

at just

came

why what did he

do 3 2 1

go

no I'm not going to be 100% this game

it's just too

stupid it's such a stupid

Game Plus to check I I just did a

hydrate does that count or do you want

another

hydrate I can do

another I mean I can at least like I

guess check but I don't think I have

enough gold 17 go do I

need I don't have 17

I have 10 which

is wait I can do that

one need 17 go something but why why can

this what wait what

that my gold wait where is the second

one

23

21 in that case this should require 19

did they write the wrong number right

nine or

something 23 and then this should be

25 2

gems

interesting oh maybe the other one

requires 19 gems

then I got 22

yeah so I guess this one requireed 19

gems yeah this is completely different

oh look a pink thing oh secret bonuses

yeah going by hitting the target with a

jewel win by getting the play

but being the player with the highest

score for SL attack press you press

that 3 2 1

go oops

all right counted

good picture of Three Gems oh didn't

I yes that

count

oh there we go that's the last

one wait how about that

this

oh wait didn't I hit

that like a pink thing I don't know what

kind of thing that

is 3 2 1 go

at least I got

points now next

to

I I don't want bef fre toer me points in

this

game

all that was

wrong there we

go nope

one I P it to myself there should be

some

points ohu has tons

Point wins re really sounds like it says

REO oh co has a Pink Dinosaur yep 3 2 1

go course

he oh pass it to my no that was

nice

nice

count where's going no wrong

direction

at is one

point more one of the other

ones

points go go go okay I'm in the lead now

just one more win 3 2 1

go

that

CH

tap

nice

well n thought was not

there all

games all the

Gams

get out of

way I'm not sking

anything oh I hit

it just need

no just need the aim a little bit F to

left then I have won we won with one

point 3 2 1

go

nice here we

go two

FES that was not my time

no

D go spe

fight

moved

was not wa there we go four F want to go

five so

far I got single

point quick quick single

points some two

points no that was that was the wrong

wins I

win

whoa

okay okay let's see what's

see of course get enough point to lower

your score to

zero I my phone is acting

up

acting we being the first to go this

hero in a lot of time with OD stacked

against you

go should be but I mean I got 30

points but I I don't know how long the

was

come on give me some

TS yeah there it

is that wasn't

Target that

was

wait

the the third game appears like 10

seconds left that's not long time to

pick it up when it 3 2 1 go yeah I think

we have

ni

it's not even enough time the computer

ST no finally had

it

oh it actually count as two

points

oh that was one

point no I had it I didn't realize

it TG

to you actually someone

got 15

points mat

celebration you were

ahead it's not about being ahead it's

about reaching I need 20 points in one

minute oh that

work

no ST them

already you

fail it 3 2 well super satday work was

easy easy money that's

good P Money

S

no oh

oh

yes

it now I just need five more

point

no time up I just need five more points

and never got 3 2 go yeah go like

basically almost every

challenges G

challenges no I didn't I wanted to throw

it I didn't want to Dash having one

button many games insist of just having

one button that is everything is very

annoying I'm probably with many

examples and I've seen people struggle

with it

too Crossing and of the

Lamb some something

things which would work be much better

easier to do

time up do what you want to do if you

could have more buttons seems Seems the

real challenge is caring the gems to

throw

yeah and when you acquire it you have to

actually manage St it

too

I

like can not exent that instead of

throwing yes that

counts come

on no that did not

count that did not count that definitely

not where's the last CH you

fail 3 2 1

go one two

points oops that was too far right two

points that was to far to

left

oops too far to

left oh no

wrong to

strong to strong angle on the W bounce

St you fail okay Rel was very quick this

time 3 2 1

go it

finds make get

more they just let me

hand it's hard to aim with the de

maybe I should use I don't even know if

to supports this thing this thing is not

comfortable one

point of course this delay kind too so

aiming some games have aiming

independent

moment

I don't know how many points that was

but you

fail wa me in this time 3 2 1

go two

points speet

points the target is

nothing one point I guess I should be

yeah super super six points

points whoops wrong Ang I'm not used

to now I'm playing crash games I is like

spider oh I wanted more

invisible you

fail 3 2 is too

good Five

Points just St them already why are you

waiting for wasting time

high

points some

points need four

more don't pick it up

again oh I got it oh so close

to I did not that [ __ ] you fail I

again 3 2 1

go

no TR

points I did not get

it oh so close all right

man high points

you cord was good this time 21 seconds

left 3 2 1

go oh five points I I take

that come

on

oh I had I didn't realize was five

points or

something

points three more

points I have it yay you win I did

it after many many

tries yeah I did

it getting the gem aiming

it and

everything

okay now it's going to be some stupid

additional

thing there was

no

dangers in the levels I'm not

sure can now

go 2 one

go guess he's working hard enough

already yeah I

got

points wait can distance keep that

from oh

far yeah that

is yeah good good

count

nice

no too far

for you fail I wasn't

too not too far

behind 3 2 1

go no completely wrong

direction

stop attacking me I don't even have you

jam oh

moved I wonder if it countes from when I

serve it or from when I hit

it seems to be from

as I guess it makes sense

guys so

close because the game has to determine

how many points I I will get from when I

se it and then just check is it a

flashing Z and get points or

points he's the way to program it and

also fail oh if I did hit that one it

would be a tie at

least problem with with watching streams

in the kitchen is all the interruptions

3 2 1

go yeah I had had things like

that in my

way

sometimes now like this time they are

very

aggressive

oh they actually hit this

nice

oh

yeah this is a

l you fail it was so

aggressive not that I'm not

next either I'm not next to Stone

anymore

go

oops he keep

count

oh it

dounced come on give me some

Kims

come on pick

up I

have you fail one point from I I did

terribly but was just one point from

what oh

Sports

time

time

oh did Count good yeah it's definitely

Dr when you thr with

enough which is just how it should

be if it changes off you still get

points

some I didn't not the jam I was look for

that I had Jam for like a

second no I did not bounce this I want

there we go

no why you got the second jump

there too much lay after no I

did

no oh I hit it

nice

nice I actually did win I barely have

any points but I won

anyway

I guess I interrupted them

enough yay celebrate no that's no

celebration that's teasing

pum this is more of a

punishment

don't don't

look 3 2 oh who birthday go wait

birthday someone say

birthday

wow I have it I have it I have it I have

it oh no

me wait pass to Cortex we're not the

teammates finally my first five

points no bouncing

corly oh so close

wait I guess I moved to forward I didn't

pay

ATT

wow oh oh count it did

count no pick it

up you fail French man gra a lot of

points because birthday suit wait that's

not the birthday suit I was definitely

not born with underwear

on

because

it's to what you were what you had when

you were

born his ter does not make sense to

me

I know might take it to

but use the time

anyways

no oh got nice that that

got

points why does he have so much

point so much Point 3 2 1

go no

game is too lenient all

right than at least one

point that's

points ni that's next

one points

I one one

point okay

next you

fail I'm not too far from me problem is

I need to win two times in a row

so i' be out have a good SC thank you

for stopping

by m it's nice to have you here

faing with

theede

but only six more days left which uh can

get extra hours you should get extra

hours every give that's

to seems like they need extra hours more

of than

anyway

quick

W

no now he moved I mean he's want to

moving I'm I'm so bad cuz I'm trying to

aim

quickly you fail now I were have low

points but that's probably because it

was more

aggressive yeah I don't think I want

make

this give up on

one game is just too hard for

me I guess I have to satisfi with the

St wait that's not fight points but wait

maybe that was Five

Points

yes there it

count no

right I wish the indication that you had

a gem pick up was a

be I mean yeah g

up

everyone I

think

anyway he not the most obvious

indication you

have so now it went well first it's

still there the bunny is surrounded and

the bunny

scared 2 yay wi one of

two

yeah

here we

go

right did

count as long as it

counts oh no

it's

next on

yes

oh I want the

point yes I didn't see who who

that

that's

wa ha

ha one

tce

yay one of them the midle one turn into

F

bunny some

reason yay

oh

ants give me a

check you

see you

see

easy impossible it is the last one wait

that it is the last one of this

one

no here came of

sideways here com from sideways some

reason cuz when you enter

this supposed to lock you in position

but for some reason I was on the side of

this

thing push but I was definitely on the

side of

it some jump in here

here we

go now I'm on the side of it I don't

know how it works but it

works so I have that

there I don't get the point of loading

zes between the they were were

warps there's one of these I'm to

cryst yeah P Panic should be

easy because H as soon as you get the

light thing that's a

win

well PA to take h I just did a hydr come

on let do a hydrate just for some redeem

hyd okay I'm sitting up

straight

okay let's let's try this again

then

3 2 one go all right here this

one

oh so close

oh no you fail no my cloth premian why

did he steal my

outfit 1

go that's very R the

you oh that's a

way

ow no why why did I take damage from

that good luck no that's that's not good

luck that's the opposite of good

luck no

stop stop

it no no everyone is attacking

me see losing off is bad luck so it's B

out in the game no that's I thr at me

again not everyone is always staring at

me but like more than half the time tell

something is targeting

me even if they're like on the other

side of the map they still throwing it

towards

me okay I don't even

know yeah it's still even though they're

standing next to each other they're

still trying to throw AC

me

yeah I just need

to attack

you

w first win well got to get to work now

later I hope you have a P

work do not overwork

myself that LE do

work even even even if I try just

like if I pick up something first I

still manage to throw it for there's no

point of me picking up

FY as a has everyone's throwing at me

again you have each shed

attack here we

go now you're throwing at me

again they're standing next to each

other right good

Goods each

other

wa waa you

win like three and now see if I can do

this

yep no no

going yeah

was

who yes if than get other oh no

you

fail yeah he has full

health yeah this is an impossible

challenge

go

oh they have so much

heal

yeah

we one gave you extra heing

head

you fail but I okay I don't have more

Health but even so I'm super F because

this game is

Che

h

almost

that there we go you win

bued first win I'm getting I'm starting

to get better at 3 2 1

go

no it

exploded we kep the plant

fruits cop so slow

St

no be

me okay one more attack yes there we go

I

won it's Arrow PO is so slow to show and

she shows so

short here we

go long

way

Beach maybe this one is

easy it has the whole magnetic feature

to

it

win two rounds in a row against Arena

Champions to complete this challeng

three two see you so and it's only 12

points to

it's exactly it has this magnetic

feature aha

wa like that look

it well I got one at

least

with that I only down

nine coming

no

huh mve so slowly

fast okay one of them

out no you

fail 3 sneaky one one

go

go no oh bounced it

back

again oh no move the wrong

way dress is

back

there

oh nice

a against

that okay so now it's gone I can't use

magne anymore

that's just need to these two two oh

they have so

much

well I can

use need

magnetic on it

own ROM

physics

cortex is only you and me

now

fa

oh can't just let one of those rolling

please

go I tried to be careful in everything

come on

move

go

no

yeah I have the least the point left

oops cannot see

PS

no Oh I thought that was my last

one okay now he's

done

47 now I came it te I came it

toam

maybe this wasn't that e as two one

go oh he scored on himself no one else

did

anything so much for being a hard

computer I

guess and he did exact exact but the

mirrored version of it

it's bounc up the corner and in all

go no input from any other

participants yeah speak of EC wait he

avoided that one

why W no okay I dropped the first ball a

two

balls I got two I got two balls now I

can safe here you go there's

joke no one is here to laugh at my

joke no I dropped

it I'll let

it w

no

way I just let it

St such

fool

help

Vortex no strength

physics I'm losing cortex due to stupid

physics you actually did score on

me going say you're only going to score

on yourself but I guess you you already

compet you probably calculate those

trajectories before you sent them

off

NOS that no and next one

just need one more on CeX

now it's my thing no no that was me

failing that was

noty 3 2 1

go

oh nice work tiny we make a good

too

hey all

right oh I dropped

the

oh he must quick

that strange

physic w

the reaction times on these Comm are

crazy what again is

Dey only you and me

now

that's

warning yeah strange physics I'm losing

against strange

physics

yes have

one do game try cheat three 2 1

go

whoa how about that I traded which B and

was flying

across no not

me do I look like

quality

I must have we long ear being

corner it is pretty neat with the ball

bouncing on top on onto each other when

the pic F

correctly not so much when the physic

behav is

wrong

no

no I dropped

that

no

no no you

fail stupid physic is not working mean

my favorite 3 2 one

go

chea I

understand I understand that makes

perfect physical

sense if

um thank you for teing up against

me

that if the ball is next to you and you

use the uh Force Fielding to push

the way that it would be pushed towards

the side and bounce off the side of it

and then into your Go I mean it makes

perfect sense that it would beave like

that and I wouldn't have a problem with

it if it wasn't because it does not work

like that when the computer does

it when a computer use the horse

field then it moves forward not to the

side it doesn't move it moves forward

from their perspective it does not move

away from her

thing like you would expect

yeah it would same thing when it bounce

up the side

like

guess P

it

oh didn't see

you

well back to this

again

whoa oh no I'm scoring on

myself you

fail yeah this isn't going great 2 1

go

nice teamwork let's do that

again okay you didn't do it this

time and you put both balls into your

own

go okay now you're teaming up against

me so we on a team

forit like you've been against me all

this

time ah moved away from there

oh

oh okay that's the strange

physics is already

out

oh

nice okay now it's for some reason a

very self aspect

St yes you

win 3 2 1

go that was

neat no that was not

neat

no

no I want to be

SE I mean it makes sense you would

attack in that

moment

get oh

no W they're flying all over the

place well oh I actually picked it up

Tak oh he SED out

again have to focus on

tining oh

tin no wrong

it

okay time's gone there we Go's

gone gold trophy I mean gold Relic which

has nothing to do with

time could I pick anything else I mean

they wanted two levels of E I guess the

Relic is the don't thing that comes in

levels this one should be easy when you

get the

uh no someone SP to me a question

here so way

check back on the

night so all I need is

electricity and this one

go go give me electricity

yes n i just needs to keep this

one as soon as it

strikes I win you

win now let's see if I can do it again I

wonder if it always because I think that

one also sends out electric stes or is

that like a gem or maybe that's the

crystal challenge that has the

electricity on

it and it does more more than just

electricity it was just a coincidence

then go to the

face that

want what if

it's you to fight turn my

knee this is a higher chance for

electricity or

something I just needed to strike oh

that was close yes just

start easy first try

so much easier compared to every other

channel

CH challenge so

far huge difference in different

difficulty of course if they get

electricity I pay I lose

immed there that

too

3 Let's see if I can do this 1 go as far

as I know there is

no thank

you

come on

stop I just got attacked and trying to

move okay been hit four

times

okay I here like seven times or

something

no you w I won four points that was

close I got attacked so often the hit 3

2 1

go

oh shoes no he getting Sho oh

shoes

no

she I take

that come on now the attack is like aim

for

me come on you broke my thing

intentionally I mean of course

but

I

one 169

he's

that okay maybe should make that

CH space

smash well I know something I want

mat

win oh it's this this this this time the

ground does does fall on if

use so maybe I should try

to you

fail these

challenges are very tricky 3 2

1

go

no no what fa why did it just

explode 3 2 1

go

no no

fail I said 20 disappear

go there wait oh he didn't hit

ground he fell down oh I mared now it

Mares

oh he has little life left no don't

me there we

go you

win now he does not have any

life 3 2 hey can I repeat this

go no

I go

yeah here we go fell

down down

two

Spees oh yeah got there we go you wi why

is suppos this one so much easier than

the other one

I guess it's I guess it would be because

they they fall down

and since all of them likes to attack

and also didn't seem like they were

trying to attack me this time like the

previous

one this one this

one because the previous one they they

were always like more than half of their

attacks were directed at me it felt like

3 2 one

go

you failed nice they're like coming for

o done 1

go

on on stop

shoting you fail why he start against

me three am supposed to be the one who

needs to win this game but I saw the

computer was supposed to be a bit more

neutral not showing their B so

clearly come on why have

my you fail

it was only him left too actually went

surprising let's see if I can try

that no now there just all attacking

me you

fail yep now they were very aggressive I

did not work this go

I want to move

down there

surr you

fail I have no idea I to do this 1

go

okay this is not hey how did that hit

me yep I'm

St you

fail sometimes you just get stuck on the

map can't move 1

go

move away get away from

me yep now

both w like they're off to

me they're like try to look like you're

against each other too you

fail yeah

this 2 1 go as a category of mini games

this is

worst

oh yeah I just love it when I shoot

myself you're like are you going waiting

for me he CH to shoot too now

three shot does not have to be DED at

me well I won I'm

fleeing two against

one 3 2 1

go change to

attack

to you fail y

never 3 2 1

go

yeah is this how it should attack

other he standing on your side and like

attack

me you my attack is so weak I cannot

defeat one of

them like I'm

underpowered they can kill me quick it

then I can kill

them we are against

me I at least really 100% against

me and he's stronger than me too maybe

this

s it's very

unfair w

oops I R into that

one there you go you

win it's a bit easier to face up against

tiny

cuz I can tell he can only shoot

once everyone here can choot once except

reu twice because that's fact his his he

has a weak one his his single shot is a

strongest

not strong

shot you fail Y and then and then the

computer comes in his really aggressive

and just that shoots me oh

my

yeah attack myself you how did that

attack

myself the worst came out of

them ball games are terrible but this is

so

much

wow

W

wo

w

I need to fight

against no

nice oh the

aim you fail of course I fail I almost

fa St Mod is

terrible I'm not going to complain about

it until I

win

like a machine

gun y you fail of course he surviv with

tiny tiny amount left just can 1

go

w got away from that got

myself that's how this game

works you

fail three two one

go

yep got stuck in

here 3 2 1

go was not that direction I was going

in

surv it almost all

Health you

fail and 3

2 I'm not going to be able to defeat

this in few

minutes

you

fail 3 2 1 it's a long time ago I should

give up on hun in this

game and I think

that

I think I should

just think we have the

main

yeah I think that's

FES it's not 100% but I mean I still

still want like Crystal okay can I at

least go and get that Crystal can

annoyed about that I still don't have

it

missing one Crystal for some

reason not that one yeah that one was

the one I bought over for a long

time this

one

interesting okay let's see why did I

just forget about this one I must have

because I went I went through everything

and I must have forgot about this

one

so here a win with a hand cap of

slippery shoes oh three two one

go lier

shoes

I at least I can jump and change my

direction that way

no my mask my mask

fail my mask just disappeared 3 2 1 as I

didn't even get get

that

we

go you fail I wonder if speede would

work 3 2 1 go

K the penguin in the

back

I

not get hit by single

no

nice everyone is died at the same time

there we go that was the missing

Crystal

if I get this one I actually unlock one

another

bonus

level

been two rounds in a row

against three two one go not sure why I

read that the same thing every

time that's

this there we

go

you

fail 3 2 1 go that was very short

turn

why did you do

that so get

attacking

must

you fail no I didn't realize I had that

little Health left three 2 1

go like

k

I he's

getting destroyed

by there it you

win it shouldn't be too hard because

yeah they are getting distracted penguin

1

go yeah they wake up the

penguin

oh thing is in

p

ow no oh

I you there I Tri for for h to 3 2 1

that that wouldn't

happen

oh

you win died at the same time amazing

and standing down there wi 3 2 1

go

some sometimes I don't know how it works

oh sometimes when you throw you can get

the speed

boost you're going to BL in to my

own I guess that

was watch

out you laugh

out oh all got hit

there okay

let's go and I just watch

out didn't even get the

SE

winner

I that should be

17 and then also the same amount of

trophies gems and

crystals can ofuse it shouldn't Crystal

be the first thingu

in

and I can see the usage of the relics

even though that's not how they shoot

relics what more do you unlock in Crash

this it why are all the jam screen it

should

be it should be like silver white gray

depending what color you want to see in

the

m and then the

I don't know what a crystal would then

be replaced by finish man okay so it's

this

one to J push push what 3 2 1

go I I I did that

completely

now I see

it

and oh you get oh going to

complete and CER has to keep but of

course

who that

do win yeah I kind of M Stu to start I

was a bit confused even though I play

this game mode many many

3 2 1

go yeah now now I'm doing it

me

W that

was that was not

nice rotation

again

and they are somehow underwater being

able to

bre also way reg CH now

it's

hit

who no jump

over waa that was close wns yeah

definitely okay in that case I'll

already swim

suit that's not

swimuit CU I can

to

I don't have any boost yet need to col

the

Boost no no I got pushed

off hly really

now yeah I got Max

boost

no get out of the

way

wait

no I was so I was catching

up how it's busy this c 3 2 1

go well well come on

too Qui too

Fasto oh I got

push

loot yeah

I'm

oh I got

my Rel who wins I know who

wins gorilla

kangaroo

three random combination

of I do

that

no come on you just came

back is

there we go

no wish I have some more

boost oh no wrong way

again one on the last L okay this was

tricky there isn't many obstacles so I

guess the computer is messing up as much

as as those

other

map there's a bunch of obstacles

that

no I guess

that's can't be

turn

oh course this is so

hard cortex win I mean at least

like

still I at this point

I I doing two times basally we need two

times

in

3 2 one

go hello I actually didn't P

off no

oh one pushed me

off too

much much

turning one left

left wao too

wins now 2 repeat it more

times is this

G

what this challenge to

MEC challenge because it's not

like what it's going to be like the

obstacles only stop you the computers

can go straight through the

obstacles

well or maybe it's like a basic if you

fall off you lose

something per the dam one is completes

more LS than the

computer with

your so give me to

jam I think I had 10 and everyone has

eight and I just did that

so that sink it on

screen that

if if they

have if they have an initial challenge

and then they have a hard challenge when

you completed the requirements for hard

challenge during the initial challenge

you should unlock the price for the hard

challeng as

well and I think one one such example is

if you

remember uh Spyro stream where you have

to do the first skateboarding

challenge

but you have

to get rid of it's very nice when you're

saying it the

15

lizards first the challenge is just to

get rid of them the Second Challenge is

to get rid of them within 3 minutes and

not falling off the

ball wins but if you manage to do the

initial challenge within 3 minutes and

not falling off the board you should get

both rewards because you already proven

that you can do

it they could just add one extra line of

dialogue there

like like I was going to I was going to

challenge you to do it within 3 minutes

and not falling off the board but

because

you already did it within 3 minutes and

without falling off the boort you can

get the second reort

immediately yeah probably phras the way

than

that but I hope I got the yeah

I 3 2 okay maybe I didn't do it in 1

minute I forgot to do

time but even if I did

and

at least I

have no I

jumped I was in the air I can control

myself

no

more

RS did it call them again I don't

remember 2 seconds for one

left not going to see that not going to

be able to do that 2 1

go have a stag start there but not a

good start

off the challeng

up come on

get

no

okay the delay

off

no time up that was

worse the computers can't even do it in

one minute and they only have to do

eight laps

no he's attacking

me

jump no

don't

laps now it's three but I three more

lap no now R was really really fast of

course

see go

I guess it's the

uh yeah I guess I guess you

often but when is the

uh Relic challenges when he he doesn't

do

thatting

enough

oh maybe maybe the

um Crystal challenges you cannot

jump I trust

no wasn't my last

lap I I don't know I've had enough time

but okay

so

okay we can't like go around the lap in

the same place I must be two laps

quicker

than jump jump

jump oh

no got push

off now I getting push up

again

you fail come on C use a quick this 3 2

1 go let me

win that was a bit early

but was

F what

fine

uhoh

into this

MO

okay I'm actually going to

this nope I did not keep attention

to Long slaps left in cuz I saw the

other ones being too I easily defeat

them but I didn't realize what wrong

was was I was going to do oh I

okay much

him

no

terrible nothing thing get that thing

got in my way I had to jump

over

you fail that time it one I had three

two and a half

left

seconds

for yes swim SE water

level

bet C doesn't have

one Far

Behind still

behind down

think I'm of

everyone so that was going I jumped to

early

and time

up I jumped too early so I landed behind

it but then I thought it was going to

retract again but it

didn't

I really wish it was a quick way to just

restart but there

isn't I don't know how long this

take three 2 one

go this time like Target

me you

go so yeah the uh crystal challeng is

either

yeah now it's now

just that it's targeting me which was my

first idea techn is that I don't have a

j that still behind

C

yay you win so close to pulling up there

I did it but so close to losing

there

wa I did

it okay let well let's see what the

crystal challenge

is

complete the race as s spe 2 1 seem to

go pretty

quick already from the

start like I'm going get pushed forward

by

that yeah

I I'll take the extra push

for no

no oh I'm still on

TR I'm still on check it's

not okay so by speeding up them and Z is

better it's not like it's it is it is

not speing up during the

RAC 3 2 1 go well I did not consider

this

spin behind

anyone I read your message it's

not you a very long

message why is the comp so

cute can win

already you

fail C going three 2 1

go like

that now

I keep falling behind you keep messing

up

of no I'm

n 21 I have

17 one fox that was

not

thank

nice look like another

probably take another break from playing

crash bash and get back at at a late to

date

so we'll see if I now I'm probably going

to be quite quy

tomorrow I probably skip tomorrow but

maybe I'll

stream Tuesday I did say I will make a

just in

case
