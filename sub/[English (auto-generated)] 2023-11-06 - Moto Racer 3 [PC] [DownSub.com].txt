game the ter

game the the first first bot racer on

the PS1 was a well polished

game the second one wasn't like worse

uh and this third one was e even you

can't even complete a tournament without

game freezing up I still don't don't

know if if that's just due to getting

second or third place maybe if get in

first place makes the game be able to

continue but the game is so hard I'm not

even able to win it

anyway

we we come this The

Boat Boat I don't I don't

understand I

think and this we call the

motor I see yes yes

okay okay let's let's

um let's proceed with the game my name

is pon pon my nickname is pon

pon I am from I'm from Sweden and my I

don't know why do we didn't have this

information oh you can the age

apparently my age is question mark why

would even input an email address is it

maybe it's like multiplayer or something

I don't

know but yeah when I start the race

you're going to see the picture is going

to be full screen unless there's a way

in photo Photoshop Ops that I can

uh that the screen to always be a

certain

size

um is there is there a way to force it

to always be the same size

otherwise it's going to change it's

going to change size otherwise and I

don't want

[Music]

that

so hey this is a boat because it looks

like a boat today I don't exactly see

the boat shape in

it it looks like a boat from

the like the front of a boat nah I disag

pronoun check

okay

pronouns there we

go

H holy [ __ ] Panda

has what P

pronounce new to

me I I just call him that gay Midlands

Sky well at least now you now you knew

that you should use

him I wish Papa's pronounce were inside

this me oh not I know it's not full

screen but I don't know if someone knows

how to set OBS to display a wind a

source at always the same size I would

be able to do it but sadly I'm not I

don't know how to do it so someone has

to tell me

otherwise we're going to be small size

until I started the race so I

actually I don't exactly know how this

whole thing works so let's start with

speed

like oh so so I had to

basically so I got TOA

[Music]

and so let's start here Eastern

Creek

[Music]

at for automatic transmission Mt for

M anyway

um

wait it's it's locked okay let's start

with

or this the pink

[Music]

one we'll

see now then there not pink

one should we go with the swords okay

let's go with the

swords let's go for

competition

immediately that's how I

am I can do a friend in a at start let's

go a

medium start of friendly

R Ma so much many more bikes than in

let's let's see if my can handle this

game

yeah I couldn't figure it out I had to

create Zoom filters for when the game is

this brogress yeah yeah it's going to be

full screen when I press play Boom now

it's full

screen 3 2 yeah THS one is it this the

same voice go go go

go every computer is

quiet Al I forgot to now I can't change

that

well oops

oops all right I got that yeah stream

emance likes to take the first word you

write as your name for some reason and

even though I said it to be the username

um stream elements is really has a lot

of issues with the both commands but

Mama's coming for dinner so I got to

clean up okay fine enough have fun

cleaning and listen to my

PE I don't know what to say

then and um trying to reach CH dings is

not a good idea oh that is a super that

that is super broke the menus are

different resolution than the game that

this is very common

for games in in uh this era era in my

experience

um and the the Need for Speed game was

also the same but I was able to put it

in some kind of wrapper to make it have

a consistent resolution but H I didn't

get it to work for this game so menus

get to be small game play is full size

so that's good

bike was jumping a bit there okay this

game is so much easier to like the track

is much wider that's a difference

because the bike SP so

huge on the on the previous

game I have no TR trouble just driving

normally with this

[Music]

bike so this this game feel so much

nicer to drive so maybe maybe I should

do the tournament

then cuz this is going fine but this

game has one

problem you can set what you want the

controls to be I hope the game isn't too

quiet

but uh you have H you have to navigate

the menu with the mouse not even

keyboard

works so does the does the mouse show up

and let's do competition

then can I even do

hard I get more credit if I do

harder let's see how hard hard

[Music]

is many back this time

yes I got an inro sequence

someone is Mr a main character here just

casually strolling

down oh because it's that wasn't even a

b

Pi go i s I pick the sword

Spike

anyway it's fine it's good I don't want

the game to overpower me

oops to sh

cor I'm the commentary now pon is at

back of the

pack doing this corn

smooth nice climbing

positions 14 position

now oh very very close

there oh somebody the uh that bike got a

turbo for some no

way and uh this game barely has any

settings I wasn't looking for it but I

did not see any setting to change the

speedometer so you just have to I mean

for streaming it would be great if you

could do both

units there's the smaller number would

be the number with the lower value would

be M

BR

and so it wouldn't be hard to like lift

off hey hard isn't too hard I mean I'm

not winning this

but but it can mean

worse this is so much easier to control

as well go so

smooth nice and

smooth I probably need more left going

doing this but I guess I can control

another

that final

nap oh um anyway oh this a PC release

oh I forgot to change the title yeah

this is PC I forgot to change that in

the

title yeah if it was p PlayStation it

would be fixed resolution like the game

games change resolutions

but uh some games do change resolutions

still but it wouldn't affect the

streaming because the source is always

giving the same

resolution and but yes this is a pie

pleas change tit

and I guess I'll just do quickly when I

finish

R this game is not available play one

plus this gra is way too hey just speed

past me like

that can't go quick can't completed six

six that's not bad okay let me fix that

PC done

fixed H Calin Mega per hour makes me

feel

faster you wanted to I I said it like

that because because you wrot it like

that how do I

SK because didn't Wing okay let's do

medium John get off the

track

but why did it uh I have I thought I had

this bike set but for some reason it

changed when I went into

competition just how what sense does

that

make okay we already seen the

intro there you go oh now it's blue bik

two what what's going on with this

game yeah that makes much more sense why

the resolution is more yeah normal I

mean in my experience most PC games uh

usually the difference between hard and

medium maybe it should be like a medium

hard difficulty like if if hard like

hard gave me a challenge medium is not

giving me a challenge but hard was too

hard because I could not keep up with

the like they were still dying fast I

mean so I mean it was impossible for me

to win there

I mean I could probably go through the

corner be more efficient but yeah easy I

mean medium is too easy I really need a

medium hard

[Music]

difficulty although I mean lat to tracks

might be more difficult in the same

thing in motorace when one and two when

I like medium like the first tracks were

easy and then they gave me more of a

challenge later

on really need I wish there wasn't that

Z the stick isn't perfectly centered but

I guess you can't be perfectly centered

on MRI

I I remember plenty of old games that

had different men G yeah they go the old

games love to do that for some reason I

don't get

it just don't get to get

it at least this one does have Window

mode yeah that was a that was

the next is reason why the uh the Need

for Speed game I played was in in the

rapper thing because it it did not have

Window mode and that was the way to

force it to window oh there was in the

[Music]

chat kilom

Mega this sounds faster than

kilom and this a Kelvin Mega but

did you know that in Sweden we have a

unit known as mines I mean in Swedish we

say

me uh in both sing plural H which is 10

km

so wait why is why is

assist I didn't even what there's lot of

assists going on wait a minute I need to

check this the game is playing itself

basing okay

H it's

hopeful okay maybe I need to slow down a

bit there

but I need to see the settings for games

there aren't really any

[Music]

set this game is way too

easy I need to check that this is not

how I want to play the

game

[Music]

let's take the

pit so far ahead of

them H I need to check that I don't want

that of aist like breaking

assist who

winner look at this humans all those

polygons and the animations of three

again try again I

won ah okay so it basically gives you

credit okay I don't want where is like

settings there's no settings anywhere I

guess it was

like settings here but this is just

settings for the

bike this isn't settings

for like difficulty comp

like where is like what did

why why why is the settings for the

actual

game just player but I

can't anything

here I can go to the

shop where I can so I have

Barcelona Creek

civilization so I guess the the way I

win this game is buying

everything I should I like win

everything this this game is weird let

change the bik

again how do I okay cost 24 I have

13 cost 12 have okay how do I

I this game is

Weir this game is weird so I need to go

here find it buy it boom it's bought

and therefore is red because red

[Music]

means oh now it's

blue this game is

weird the medium is too easy hard is too

hard let's go back to

hard okay he if you you might be able to

measure speed in Calin if you go off the

heat

energy exerted by the ti the

track I mean technically as something

gets hotter since the atom starts moving

around so you might be able to get speed

out of the amount

ofing

and much smart you out is the the atom

movement consistent between materials or

do we have to pick like a standard

material like

water and Bas it on

that

can

I you know

what

maybe let me see it definitely have that

is slow down wasn't it definitely have

some kind of going

on if I were to disable the

[Music]

assists cuz I should not be able to just

drive like this okay you know

what

time to

see uh because if

I um is there anything I missed because

yeah here you go here's the

settings you have the display This only

affects uh game play not menu you got

the

controls yeah there we go but there's no

dead zone and there's this the make it

just one larger to you don't have the

scroll network doesn't affect me sound

doesn't and

teams there's no there's no settings for

this game you cannot choose assists you

cannot in this

game this game is

weird

did cleared off the age probably because

I didn't write a number the question

Mar

but this is a transmission this

isn't and now was switch to this

bike Goot to shop to buy this C okay

what is

this oh set

pleas

earbox power

default well well

um I guess I'll just have to play it

this way then this is just how you play

the game or was

something yeah I don't

know let me just here quick do the

search

yes no I

didn't now I guess I guess I can't find

anything wait why is it reverse

view H Intel HD graphics wait why is it

still in I switch to Nvidia gra why is

it still I mean game Run's fine on the

integrated graphics card but I did

switch it to use uh the Nvidia graphics

card

and wait what happened the bike

time look at this three

one and look at this

[Music]

yeah

soon I would fig

you oh I can't speak today I just can't

speak

like can someone explain this to

me before I start streaming I can speak

just fine without

having without losing my voice when I

start streaming I I get trouble

speaking and then when I'm done H

streaming and I have no problem speaking

again and I just don't get

it yeah I'm not paying attention to my

driving

yeah let me let me get a feel this

track streaming brain is real it's it's

it's not the it's not like me it's

nothing mental it's it's like I get like

uh you call it flam buildup in my throat

when I'm on

stream anymore H but if

I but if I'm not streaming that doesn't

happen why does it happen while I'm on

stream

[Applause]

[Music]

what cuz

it I don't

know is that really just my

brain oh subconscious nervousness I me

but would that affect

my yeah there

there when I when I try to cut that

corner the assist kicks in and just

stops the bike from

driving and I really want the assist to

be

disabled because it hinders me from

playing the game it hinders me from

enjoying the

[Music]

game sure I shouldn't be cutting the

corner so maybe it's like not the actual

assist kicking in maybe it's just the

anticheat system that kicks in

but this is we way to me I

guess

I don't feel like I'm cut cutting like

shouldn't be what is it the phits did I

cut the corner too

much yeah that was

terrible like driving the gross the G

doesn't slow you down that

much and not like in World

Tour

these cars these cars these bikes do not

need it yeah part is way too too

hard and this game is the same as okay

so I

said I really need a medium hard

difficulty because hard is way too hard

I I will never win

hard now it's back to Red three 2 1

go this game talking more than you

normally do no I do like talking to

myself uh a

lot uh when I'm home it's not the thing

I normally do like uh done before I only

do it to practice uh I've done that to

practice my

[Music]

voice and uh so I can speak the way I

want want to speak there go that that

was not because I was dying over grass

that was the bike just

breaking as that is s that was going

[Music]

wrong it is I I just can't find any

settings that disable

[Music]

assists get out the

way I'm I'm going to have trouble

problems with every motoracer game I'm

playing

I can understand why uh the ratings for

the yeah the ratings for each game went

down because every game they make just

gets worse and

worse it's a bike that's not a

car I need this the slow down before the

corner yeah okay this is actually Chim a

chance because I'm trying so

[Music]

[Music]

terribly nice

cornering look at those flags now you

can list those flag in the chat because

it works

in actually actually

[Music]

works and using multiple pump on works

as

well I'm not sure why it was

broken and how it broke but I fixed it

because now it's doing a replacement in

a way that

um even though it will it will still try

to do the replacement again for the to

to apply the same fix to the URL but it

will the the second time it will try to

apply the fix it will fail applying the

fix so it will only work the first time

it appli it this is something I should

have added from the start just to be on

the safe side yeah I should have

that well let's fix

[Music]

now get out of the way oh in thir

position not bad not bad

race completed you won 10 credits it

says in tiny text in

[Music]

corner but they're coming third and I

was not driving a green so this is Esten

gener animation look at those blurry

textures okay let's let's win I guess

that I I guess I have to do a

self-imposed challenge then cuz this

game has no

like yeah so I I came in third position

face but the uh H the winning is video

segment even though it's gred in game it

did not feature me on the

podium well try to avoid that

back guess that's

that the one in the for the weird

game

go B too fast can't remember

every oh you want a milkshake

milkshake and I crashed okay going TR

there we go flag it's the French Italian

German British Spanish and Swedish it's

the Civil Spanish flag and not the state

flag Something 2 1

go

Dragon hello red dragon it's nice to see

you here it's nice to see you all

here it's going to

be it's going to be fun when

I but thank you for recommending the

r i thank you everyone who's still here

surviving my complaints about the game I

normally don't complain about games if

they're not this

[Music]

oh W whoa W it loed up the steering and

everything maybe it's intentionally the

[Music]

same maybe maybe that was not that that

was just me fting the corner and just

control

right I'm definitely doing better

now

[Music]

this is sneaking P between

those I didn't only only manage to pass

one of

them we go and there we

[Music]

go think yeah I think I check

both four and

three and for everyone who gets

ads but yeah they should all use custom

music

so and this game I don't know if they

understand like what R

means apparently every bike every race I

am ahead of is red every bike racer

every race I'm behind is blue going be a

lot way

[Music]

around

every item I have available to purchase

is marked in green every item I have

purchased is Mark red oh yeah it lift

off

there that's why I lost control

over

milkshake but what did you mean by m Che

oh did you see the seam in the sky

there yeah look here straight ahead is a

[Music]

scam look at the sky it's so

compressed shouldn't the texture for Sky

be the least compressed because of can

see pixels the compression

pixels new record you won4

cred two against exactly the same people

even though I won I did not have any

yellow on

me you should Pon have that outfit of

the

lady playing

outf

ad and the troph was a mil

ah okay I want that

too let's go to

was the heav corner don't know that's

[Music]

terminology go go go go go watch out to

the green bike the fruity

I again this

game maybe this game doesn't have too it

does feel like it does have

proes going on and yeah really shame I

can't find

[Music]

second I prefer playing without this I

mean G changing I think for I doing that

I just casually playing aha that's how I

got it okay the is defin some antichat

system with the but I still feel like

that was quicker than actually going

around

it Fanboy yes you

know with all the ladies at the

GD where everybody pon pon can have have

a Fano

instead you know kind kind of like the

[Music]

reverse

that's what I heard yes I did say

compressed oh polish that's what the

Polish what do you mean polish this is

[Music]

heavy

I don't

know I don't know about this game this a

weird

[Music]

one there was no warning at all and I

went off the

[Music]

shk I I guess this will be an easy game

to complete

[Music]

then

full speed there we go so much quicker

than trying to do that

prop

complete new why is this such a space

between the seconds and the the

thousands of a

second say a five at the

end well congratulation person who did

not compete in the race and did not win

first place you in first place with a

silver metal sibl try again now I have

one polish Fanboys is a whole meme

Trend to dig into

but originated from a PO politician

picture with

Fanboys

and

okay bonus residence let's go to bonus

residence going to the residence I'm

probably doesn't

seem uh why is it a bonus if I had to

pay for it how how does the bonus

residence become a

bonus in what way is this

opponent all right yeah yeah let's see

this was Germany Japan EOS Australia now

to France

and overlaps nice all right let's

continue more

question oh look at these

Graphics 3

colliding this does not look like how

you would expect road to look like in

whoop yeah and actually in intersection

for

once these roads

are very like if they made them like 90

turn or something like I guess they

[Music]

W that was

close oh wait am I first position for

some

reason this is like um uh

residence like in a PS1

[Music]

game race completed what a

weird I guess I guess it's a bonus

because it's a weird one oh someone KN

down a

sign what a weird

one no no try again one that turn

too yeah looks like it still exist it do

nice

nice okay that was all the this then

let's go
