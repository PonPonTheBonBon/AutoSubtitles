hey welcome hello kitten

welcome welcome

I said it

that's the microphone setting I should

use

I think

hello hello I forgot to fill up my thing

I wish I should be doing

okay now I should just put this package

and then I'll be

thank you

oh my head back

I am back at and there's headphones so I

can hear the game

I got

11

dark Gems or something or destroying

them I guess

a 20 light chains

what did I cut in the game

found eighteen eights should I go for

100 I should be able to do that

hey someone good on

oh

what the nice thing he said

that just I love you many it doesn't

have any sounds

is the chat working by the way

yeah unless it purpose disappeared when

I was

with me I got my drink now so

[Applause]

and I hope the game audio is good

and we're trying out the fire

okay and then you start to attack

I meant the fire but I guess that works

too

you know since the control is a reverse

in this game and I have that

all right

the fire

[Music]

he

Define your business is not acting at

the moment

and delicious is quite strong

wait you can't

isn't it

so the method protects okay I see you

I see how it is

the same is spider noises but

oh you can't play he can't pick up

flowers as if there were gems

in this game

there is climbing like time of edges and

I did like that

bunny

kids now unless my voice should be

normal in this game

it's only in

I'm gonna play Crash something

only in trash when it sounds weird

because there's something wrong with

that same engine

oh it must be inside that thing

I need to inside I can get it

another light came

which looks big and heavy

I think they were called slide gems it's

been a while since I've played this game

now

this game looks so cute it has

it has this awkward

and graphics

it's fine but like

I guess this awkward

all right

um

it is since my Swedish word

um crazy one was quite restrictive with

its Graphics so it hasn't had a certain

Style

and Playstation 3 obviously has a high

quality

like when I played it really ignited

that's like sure after position three

but

position three can produce such high

quality so I wouldn't be able to tell

and the difference between and games

with

that aren't trying to get photorealistic

I don't think they benefit much for the

high performance

maybe like more items on screen or

something longer drive distance and

stuff like that

maybe I mean

some other stuff but

okay but person two is this in-between

step

[Applause]

when for some reason the textures are

really blurry but the student models can

at the same time be quite High poly but

not too high probably it said that it's

it's weird

and it

anything I described last time like

it's the uh is it generation where they

got high performance but they didn't

know

what oh all right

here is a slow elevator

music

and where is Armenian you have the slow

elevator here

strange night I can't walk around but I

can't rotate the camera the white Sparks

it's supposed to be green but it looks

my line

and moist is saving I kind of question

mark I have so many questions about this

game

still not there yet

there we go now the UI has shown up so

yeah now it's

now we're here

let's just stay safe

it is slow Wednesday what do you have

yes I do have one

even the spark skill scene I don't know

it's just things

that cost me like 500

remember I have to buy a new ones

because 650 so it's actually cost me 6 7

16.

[Music]

you know what this is a place where you

have to go back and find this all the

time

so I should get a keychain

so what that should do

when I did this

what do I

I see if I did let's see how how long

does teleportation take

probably could get in there later

yeah it does put this pretty quick I'm

not sure what the elevators are slow and

now I can buy you some frame 100 so I

spent 100 to save a thousand 250. this

game is so weird

no no not yet I need keys

I need the key goes there you go do I

not buy more

I can't

you didn't send me a big enough keychain

it's a good choice and then I can go

back here for another 100.

I spent 200 to save

1050 and 3 times 125

let's hit me again so what's the point

of increasing the price

is a question mark because you never

know what it's naming and hopefully the

game

oh hello

welcome happy to see you here

kicking

oh sparks don't conflict suitcase I'm

currently discussing the game design of

this win game

it's an interesting game but it's weird

at the same time

what kind of death animation was that

all right bumps

bumped its likely and then it's

only basically need to

get all the gems back

I've been happy to see you here

in India

wow how rude

what is yeah anyway like I forgot the

butterfly jar I think can I see it no

[Music]

attack

how do I see the items I have

other screen

the percentage being two eggs is

power up screen

all right here I see yes it's a very

complicated way to see that I did not

find that one

and that's fun

last one

I forgot about buying it but butterfly

John

so anyway

bloody fly jar

[ __ ] I didn't mean to press that

button but it worked

and break

I found the name bleach

clearly I should be able to get snow

there but sure sure

okay so some Rockets somewhere

oh

why can't use electricity

up in this thing

do you find it insisting they can start

they start the big one but leave the one

was behind the small ones only gives the

arms there

yeah

I'm gonna like uh Jam baskets

you know this Transformer

and it's all really so strange

basically

flying towards nothing

there's an embrace

two ambience in the warm place

20 eggs in total

but soon I might unlock Amber no wait

[Music]

I mean sorry

oh

[Music]

there's a rocket which I need to use

crying for

so I

there you go and I should go down there

what did this one one of these are

useless because they don't come in gems

and I don't

I don't want to pay

to get gems because you get listed out

because 500 yams down like one of those

[Music]

someone can probably make the

calculation about how much I actually

paid

uh here you go a mermaid

Inspire is going to make it make every

comment

let me see

am I out of keys now don't need to go

back

wrong okay

start the screen power up screen there

you go yeah about the keys

which I and then

there's quite a bit until next month I

need to go back and buy more keys this

whole buying Keys things as a little

weird thing about the game

all right

it was on the other side of this other

thing

so I can save 375 at 2200.

I can pay

a 175 to save some time

oh wait I was supposed to buy the

butterfly jar

uh

there you go

thank you

take into New York

ah one million dollars

visit that's benefiting this level

actually

if you think here I can't see that here

again redeeming things

welcome

I Wish I Had a Million Dollars

it's I think that's a lot of money

regardless of each

okay here let's see what's

up

[Music]

here's a tip to get through these ruins

you'll have to follow the markers uh

thanks but once again I'm not a fish I'm

a dragon oh a seed but then got it

chicks

and respect

let's just say something more

Bells around here some of them will

light you away

oh

let's show what kind of Shameless you're

talking about

okay I really need help

yeah I'm confused thank you

no wait I took diamonds that was it was

the best friend

uh

probably the right timing to attack

peace

of his mermaids

and a good spiral

it's kind of

I've actually not seen it happen in

recent times which is a good

and but I have seen it in like at least

older

in back in the day

anyways basically like

yeah it's always been meme about memes

about it back in Native but I haven't

seen as much basically

like if if a man is bad at some things

like and then the comment is you're bad

at this and if a woman is better

something it's like

women are better than this

and that that kind of like inspirational

oh it's deep in mermaid uh women are so

stupid

I don't think any sense something no

it's yeah

they've obviously wouldn't put that in a

modern

an Inspire the game

and I guess you could interpret it in

different ways

okay I'm going back

so as I was gonna warm today

[Music]

these fish eye

annoying me

ah there's a seahorse

no let me out

oh hello

do you have

to protect you from

well pretty much everything

do I have it

what's your hair

but that didn't tell me

really now

I'm one hour away

for this yeah this one behind here

and I need the invisibility to get to it

that's annoying that means I have to go

back

excuse me that was weird

No Maybe

no maybe I can actually progress the

level

maybe the invisibility is only for

an optional thing

actually

but I still have to find the right team

um

can I get up here again

oh

over here

I will

no wait let's see again

Chinese

apparently to find another item

okay service cannot be climbed until you

have a current ability from one of the

end there is oh spark sign

this looks like a job for Sparks

wait you seem happy about it so you want

me to risk my life while you stand guard

out there

[Music]

I mean

no I mean I'm risking my life all the

time so yeah

are you having a good day

I mean yeah it's fine

it's

um

I was having a good day when people are

around

what's what the game yeah it's a weird

game

next drawing stream

Aspire well I do still have to complete

the uh

I'm working on

basically have to look at the Target

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

why would you put press the same button

aspirative charge to charge but why not

there's a difference button

maybe I'm just with this game maybe

weird

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

this is gonna take away

all right

my team is builty of things

thank you

almost

20. I didn't even need to pick that up

when The Swinging timer is up it will be

the next Township

and welcome LLC game bye

doing some

parts in here

the table is 11.

all right

I can't focus on something in

foreign

[Music]

I did it

is

thank you Game

I found a dragon egg although I have no

idea how I carried it out

[Music]

well that's not going to avoid the issue

foreign

what's this more

thank you

foreign

they have to hold Cycles to shoot and

since you don't have any ammo

come on and I don't see I recently why

you wouldn't constantly shoot

but then you have to press a square to

uh

to shoot one of powerapps

but it's still effective because you can

see the powerapps while you are doing

the regular shooting

and his most efficient well

to not stop shooting oh there's attacks

now

nice

this is going to be tricky every night

a little Striker

there's something I'm missing

is it obvious anything

foreign

okay

foreign

waiting for me to die

[Music]

yeah it's not fun this is definitely

she's not my favorite Channel I feel

like I have very little control of what

is going on

thank you

I think the worst parties and just how

quickly you can take damage multiple

times

[Music]

what

Benny wouldn't give up on a challenge

right

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

but I don't get this

sometimes I feel like they're not taking

any damage

whatever it came out

yeah I really lost down here I think the

uh

the holy

my Sparks gamer inspires he was good

enough

because not only

did you have full control over Sparks

instead of coming up being out scrolling

and

I mean that may be still much better

to be honest

he didn't have any time where you could

fly quick game

and let's see if you also had the

assistant

okay so you're done

wait what what happened

I just died

okay this is going to be very tricky

because I I have no idea what what's

going on

stuffiest happens

oh yeah that was damaged from the door

there's a door sent annoying as teeth

uh

this game is showing something

thank you

and there was finally behind that toy

[Music]

well I did say I was going for 100 but

I don't know maybe I shouldn't go for

understanding because there are more

Sparks levels than if they got me like

this

I

yeah

I think the blue one's easy to fill in

the yellow ones my body

I've always been

three gifts of yellow there wasn't to

try to specifically okay because it came

hard you know

I I'm confused

[Music]

I didn't even see that one

uh anyway

yeah the first one is supposed to be

yeah

like second thing

if I don't speed they are yellow

thank you

for instance

this level has a lot of things in here

it's I don't know if it's first level

there's some suspects ever before

yeah there's a lot of things

okay for some reason it works fine now

okay now

[Music]

for some reason

[Music]

I'm so good this game should be called

Sparks the dragonfly

now it's called Empire

well that looks like it was fun

beautiful

why is this what what is this stance

anyway I got the Night Jam that means

that I can can I go back

he ran into the one

into that one

where did I come from

yeah maybe from that don't worry

where's there

and this is where it came from this

let's see if I can go back

you can't I can't go back

this one's back

I'm easily single time honey

it's on egg

all right I'm exactly this

I sure will enjoy being invisible

but look it's metal Ember

[Applause]

I'm a short short in this round

your position

[Music]

I'm not stuck in here

all right grab it

no

no an egg no

no ache

all right let's see what this one there

was some reason inactive

this one is for

not the scene but I guess it uses

it's a

I mean

if um

for the uh

uh I hear still spiral or a mod for

reignited this should be the

invisibility horror protection

take that one

[Applause]

here

I'm counting up on the teams again

foreign

did I come from an egg the rabbits come

from me

you must be confused

[Music]

I haven't seen I've heard anything

even though

I wanted to make rabbit say if

everything is a part of my mouth that

was a nice traditions

[Applause]

oh

[Applause]

wait

should I keep missing

foreign

by going up here

graduate yes that sounds good

interhydrated like two three times after

that

that's five seven

which was quite the spiky slime

so hey so what you don't have any Sparks

he's hiding in the background

[Music]

another night game

I guess if I didn't get the Sparks

levels I wanted this captain

foreign

a bit

thank you

[Music]

because I didn't explore the previous

area for me

but that's fine

okay let's see what's up here didn't you

almost feels like I've been there he

went up like I think like this before

yeah I need to activate something here

thank you

I missed it

but I guess I can take it all the way

back

a lot of stuff anyway

thank you

okay do this thing now

okay so this one activates them on the

other side

see I can now I need to go back

nice going there

pretty much

garbage in there

time is so short

oh it's stairways

now that was just accidentally

that was crazy

someone should

click that one

2015.

how does it hurt running into something

visibility he's not as in this small as

I

thought it was

I think the

March Rising is over

okay yeah there they are anything

with me I can't just jump out from here

right

but it does

constant ambassy

yeah you can use the above in there

oh

nice outfit time

yes

well I guess

maybe you want

I still haven't made the Amber Style

version I should have I do have spiral I

said it's something

I need to make an Amber design

oh yeah so now I need to go back to the

other side

I think

and you're welcome

yeah the game itself we had when it

comes to the edges of water stuff

and now I don't need to bother about

yeah he liked him

yeah take it that's the active ones

and it said approach this one the music

nice now

I got a 14.

statues are fixed

yeah I didn't want to do that because it

went out

oh yeah

flying straight through it then that's

fun

always ever to explain what's going on

learning about all these battle affects

the party came

oh

and it is the pain of gems laying on

over here

look at this actually

it was quickly waiting for this platform

or going over those

swing things

okay I'll probably have to do that

anyway then

walked off the platform

okay let's see

yeah we're here

because here's the rocket

nice

and here's a treasure chest

foreign

[Music]

in that case I should have everything I

need

amount

let's continue back this side is clear

now

I think that's a good shot yeah not sure

what he would be

Point seeing that this one is for

[Music]

eign

thank you

it's fishing DM seasoning back button

from the PlayStation one rather than two

meaning that

triangle is back

in this game even though I'm PlayStation

2 it was officially made to be something

B there

Xbox circle is supposed to be the back

button

at least that was standby some place in

three three

and also obvious

I love turtle

but what do you have to say thank

goodness you're here my hatchlings can't

seem to get into the water and naturally

with me being a turtle I want my newborn

children to be able to go into the ocean

unsupervised

very well

supervising them but she wanted them to

go in on supervised

yeah

sure I'll have supervising the baby

turtles that we're supposed to be

surprised

20 Turtles

name the turtle is for killing our

attacking enemies

showing

I will save the turtles by murdering

everything else

also at the point of Dimitris

couldn't it be like an action number

ah

yes sir

yeah I don't care uh

how many times okay she actually cares

about if that two minutes getting eaten

but

we all have let's

huh

it's fine Jeff don't get into the water

I heard it's the enemies first

is it

is

why don't you take this egg it was on

the beach but I don't think it think

it's mine

help them into the water and I will give

you another reward

okay

[Music]

is it or does the loading screen look

familiar with the screen green soccer

things maybe now let's just let's get 27

of them

go to shoot

I should press the same Button as the

two playing aspect okay at least that

makes sense

foreign

yeah let's let's let 27 of the baby

turtles get into the water

just outside

he didn't tell me how many Architects

the animals steal but

yeah it doesn't matter it's like one two

she may find gets kidnapped and eat them

that is

God

what uh

when baby turtle is going to get eaten

there you are okay two baby starters are

gonna get eaten now I maybe that didn't

get one

all right let's at least one of them is

getting eaten

oh Spyro I'd make you the children's

Godfather except I know you'd rather

have a light gem so here

yeah you know you know me so well I mean

one of them died but sure sure I might

get all right I'm protecting them well

[Music]

one baby turtle isn't or two what a

shame always yeah however before it

anyway yeah you're good at this

dancing underwater here

from gems

maybe there's some Demon gems oh my gosh

with nothing more than James

it's okay number between this yeah yeah

he will see that it was 27.

turtles in the end

busy 20 before so 47.

so this one up here I know only have

gems

less than 500 gems there's no point of

open it is

like a point a little bit

oh yeah

[Music]

foreign

yes

oh buttons of hydration is wait

tired speak it's pirate booty if you

like booty

oh it's

a nice open thank you

even though

who is this place okay so this

cave that loops around somehow

let's start with that then

no there you go

oh no

I want to activate this cannon

okay sorry

that quits to me

this person here always

booty

pictures

it's her booty

here's the fourth Amber wait for

franchise

foreign

thing

especially since you had if she started

housing

instant wait for

oh my

God yeah Anton pilot yes

paintings

uh

okay that happens

thank you

now my name

come on

let's fly straight through that one

passive here

charge these things your friends and

don't get the chance

I'm gonna jump to that one by his name

this is going to be

um

hairstyle the frustration game

foreign

let's see

stop

Stitch

[Music]

give me just a quick minute

can have

[Music]

some

let's see if I can do it this time

I can't read

I've lost can't have many

attempts I've done but

starting up badly but let's go

let me just to warm up

okay now

okay

fine

oh come on

oh yeah what that's creepy

okay I was clippings

straight with

how does that not count

the game is just way too precise

like that should count

game is way too precise when it comes to

this stuff making this puzzle

if you can't call it a puzzle and way

harder than it needs to be

this is why I need to help from

Empire

maybe he knows what I'm supposed to do

because this is this is

funny doing them certainly that

shouldn't happen right

okay

again

you need to be very very precise that's

when you're supposed to be okay

with a little too early there and

sometimes it

yeah if you if you wait until it comes

to the end

it's too late and at that point when I

jumped last time that's too early so

there's a small window there maybe the

champion

no that's too late

there's somewhere between the previous

YouTube please attempt that's not a

large window

it seems very very precise

the 10 is gonna

take chaff

in there

Maybe

[Music]

okay that works interesting

[Music]

okay let's try nothing

no

I did not

I ain't confused

maybe it's even like

button you should press which increases

the range you can grab them from

like if you let the game handle itself

it requires very precise but if you like

press a button next to them

hit the jump button no that's not button

it grab some stem or something

and the game hasn't told me what's doing

this case it's a problem there was a

problem I had with Sonic lost worlds

at one point in the game we're supposed

to use a technique which Sonic is able

to do because I've been able to make

that technique happen

but the game never explained when I

missed how it connected explanation or

how to do that technique

yeah right yeah I'm going to be sucking

it for everything

after doing this

I might not even be able to do this

thing I want to do and then maybe

because

I went down

because I'm only getting the egg I'm not

getting the other thing everything

enable that thing yet

you should probably know that until I

have done

because when I heard the other thing

helps with you the whole thing again

I don't remember it's being disturbing

and to be honest

so I'm not giving up I'm just doing it

lately

financing

you should get something when it's done

in the house and that's a no animation

of the housebreaking they had the

animation on the PlayStation one or

breaking houses

[Music]

oh

[Music]

I definitely have that

you need to enlarge himself in the store

this secretary at the ends

secret area

how secret is that I thought all the

people are here

[Music]

[Music]

champagne

see me

Texas are after particular specific key

NES

foreign

I didn't get through this area

I know I completely skipped this area

maybe this side is where you enable that

semen

[Music]

two very low platforms suspicious

must be one of those that you raise up I

think

all right

yes there you go

18 seconds

run run run

all right let's check the playhouse

let's go

up there okay how do I try

is there a security system you don't

want anyone to open your house you put a

button don't worry which unlocks your

door for 15 seconds and then you have to

run to your point to get in

[Applause]

[Applause]

it

[Music]

and it's continuing to pay

[Music]

all right

I don't want to die

thank you and of course it's designed

specifically so sanitary you can get the

I mean yeah

isn't that high design things

[Music]

there's of course the button is a huge

button that you're supposed to

[Music]

champion

slam down on

[Music]

whoa whoa whoa

what was that

the attack was Wave Wait attack was

definitely over at that point

go ahead Spyro if you've got money to

spend I am here to relieve

okay if he came out of the burning bunny

welcome back kitten

foreign

[Music]

all right

a little kitten how's it going

I've been able to arrange this dream but

yeah I have a bit drama sleeping

and it's spiral a hairstyle is a low

energy game

do I want to

forget nothing

no you know what

if you've got money

I will take this slow elevator

elevated

because then I just reach a money bags

platform and then I can teleport between

the places

if I need to

clever elevator time

eats

the way while it's done

because it's supposed to be what am I

saying

yeah it should be slightly stretched out

anyway nice

I'm doing well today I found in Canada

so far oh I hope you find something

interesting

yeah

the other characters activating it right

maybe

can I scan it but it's nothing stuff you

can fall here but I guess I have to be

careful

yeah right

at least if there's nothing something is

falling out you might be more carefully

happy

what's the point of this

[Music]

[Music]

upstairs

they probably switched here

to deal with this

bad

let's try hey yeah

there you go

all right

away with the dress

that's a cute kitten

and this no it's this one

right three

wait where did I go from this to that

one

speaking of lack of wrestling

this place is quite the

place

wait for me

foreign

[Music]

makes me wonder if he has Coalition or

something like

candy signs

I can't go there yeah because I need and

now I need to power up to that

I have to play see this game before but

it was a long time again

I'm doing some stuff

but

I have forgotten about his safety

yeah hide I think

he's laughing

what is this game

this game

all around the whole place

oh

nothing

too exciting

I can see a picture after

he's better than nothing

or sitting

that was fun

[Music]

go ahead Spyro if you've got money to

spend buy a video to relieve

so another one of the best platform to

celebrate

wow don't connect me on

I want to stay on the ground

and what is this

[Music]

charge will be acted

oh I see massage

oh yeah it is left for 40.

and I got 36

6 he said

buttons uh is that too far away or I'll

stay four more

front door is made of three of course

still can only be destroyed

okay hey

which one takes me too quick to me

decision

all right

now while using super sharks guided over

by my blast front and Michelle okay nice

all right

we're here

[Music]

I've been expecting you I hear you but

with me oh it's no one I hear you've

been quite inquisitive about red oh yeah

but everyone seems to be avoiding the

issue can you tell me any more about him

about Jim I don't know any gym but red

ended up being banished from the order

of dragons for his terrible crimes

he and I used to be friends until he

turned in

Eve then we drifted

you know how it is like ships in the sky

do you know that you could deflect some

projectiles With Your Wings by using

them as a kind of Shield fold your wings

in front of you like this do you like

origami this will allow you to deflect

blunt objects bear in mind Spyro sharp

objects will still be able to penetrate

your wings and harm you hello

foreign

things will penetrate

so be careful about that

for example Empress horns they are very

sharp and they do penetrate their wings

it sounds like animation wasn't made for

just an egg lying around here

a boomerang is a blunt topic oh yeah

that's interesting

it it hit her butt but it still got

infected

because logic

be cute it's cute

but I can't look like this guy

[Music]

dying just like time

okay I didn't really pay attention to

what happened here

now

I stand here

so I can at least protect myself even if

[Music]

can you just disappear thinking

no why can't he cry about that scene

and that's a nice way of facing it can

you please disappear

what's wrong

[Music]

okay probably

anyway with this

is really that bad

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I mean considering they notice what

happened and then fell down and died

they don't have much of an open

opportunity to learn to be honest

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

to take care of these

you miss me

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

let's see

perfect

got the ink

oh this thing

I'm gonna get precious over here

[Music]

those are honestly crazy

okay

I'm gonna emit her life awaken

you can get around

another one of these

all right

right the slope is getting across here

right I'm making

I'm making my way

that's

nothing outside oh there is it's a thief

that was too easy

very easy

okay so let's see this is the other side

yeah

we can see because it contains this

enemy and floating gems

[Music]

foreign

thank you

extension kind of touch

maybe it's

somewhere up here and

[Music]

all right let's open

my uh Here We Go There It Is

not really the kind of Animation I would

associate with this kind of material

am I bad

he's crazy just looks to seem like each

other

and this map

of the small Islands everywhere

over here

what's the anime what what animation is

funny

what

for animation

this is confusing yeah it is oh no

no not massaging bag

still fighting the good fight I trust

yes we're really high up aren't we

it doesn't yes

and reach

might be able to earn you a dragon egg

or a light gem

I'm I do have a bird

[Music]

but

type animal but I am a bird

yeah businesses

well everything's in order but they're

missing after one day

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

thank you

foreign

[Music]

okay

I'm still

in the last place

they're missing the

last

nothing I ever seen

okay I kinda I kind of

my fear of High Street likes this level

Okay so

I know what to do now

I just need to be less silly

was it something messy

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

shot glass

I'm trying to shoot the birds yeah

if you don't mind

I missed an arch

to

everything last month

and

yeah no it's not large somewhere

maybe just

some oh yeah

[Music]

foreign

thank you

all right

well done

that was something

that was quite 11.

excuse me

[Music]

oh this is

okay let's see if I can do this again

but now everything is randomized China

it's not trying to speak German

is what I'm trying to say

ings don't make it easy

[Music]

well those things have long range

yeah

so hard he felt very hard

yes things a bit too randomized place in

random vacation is so incredibly large

the hard to keep track of everything

plus it's additional I hate things to

give Giants

sorry

let us help you

foreign

[Music]

thank you

and then give us something more here

because I had a dentist

all right I found those

still have remember my rings to get

that's the last

I think last night

yeah this is going to be very difficult

and also the uh you're getting like

extra time with time gauge but it's only

the time Gates give me extra time for

some reason

not to drinks

welcome

I am 100 nice

I am struggling through this level of

randomly placed stuff

it's so hard to get this

it has some kind of path path down

and I can bust it now

is that these things

[Music]

yeah of course of course

[Music]

Harvest Heidi

[Music]

thank you

yeah I think

that's funny wrong last time

like to get this

one more cake

[Music]

there's something

now

okay and then

that is interesting

outside

gonna be one more ring here please

of course not I heard this

all right buckets nice

and there's that one

I saw

another one down here

[Music]

so this just a ring missing

to

uh the first meeting okay

okay I don't know if I can remember that

if you guys start in the middle

all right keeping track of all these

stuff is so annoying

[Music]

doesn't matter

foreign

all right

but this sounds

like this

and here

the remaining Rings should be

[Music]

oh guys I still have like

one more bird

[Music]

no two more birds no it's one of my bed

all right

get out of the seat get out of there

one more birds

somewhere

two more

yeah I'm not going to be able to finish

this

there's like one Cannon up there

and I had another Cannon

and let's see if I'm going to be able to

do this

and I can't keep track of all these

things

too much for me

yeah I said man

that's nice than I am and

Maybe

this is just terrible to be honest

thank you

[Music]

they were here

I am studying tonight right

how this stuff is bits

I still managed to lose where did you

last first time

and then I got that one

yeah I forgot to wear all day kids are

there's a bird

I didn't start by [ __ ]

I found all the birds

but you can stop tumbling around and lie

now

like I knew I didn't pray to us but now

I don't know where it is

I assume the last

the last one of this is here yes

[Music]

then I just need another glass bird one

there's the ringside here

technical chunks

oh yeah I just clipping through the

things without picking it up

yes

that's right

where am I

but three minutes is basically just

enough time to not be able to succeed

foreign

questions

nice caffeine

you know what I'm very missing

yeah that wasn't the best

around the last bird

didn't take it back

now

Albert has finally been found

[Music]

all right

[Music]

yeah that is just these left

my father

a few more

after he's up here I think

then it's just one more left

right

but here are the names

oh I didn't get the one

one that is not around these

the one that is separate from everything

but there is the one shooting

at it

still shooting

here it is

perfect

so now I just need to find that sideways

ring that is completely separate from

everything else

efficient every line position up

to get a

new everything

and I've learned about this wait for

that

accidentally stumbled upon every time

okay first instead what I'm saying

all right

okay

purposely you know this means

where is that

I call it sideways it's more like not

sideways is lying lying down

where is that

okay ah the worst certain but I mean

again yeah I mean I think I'll search

but

uh it's been a pain yeah I definitely a

pain

you were just about to approach it

before

yeah and draw distance is the help are

they

yeah this is

currently

but I don't even know where I was in 11.

today did the developers play this level

and software this is the function it's

always that is always my thought every

time you sometimes me in a game

you don't miss makes me think the

developers really think this was fun

but maybe maybe it was outside the

control

yeah you have no idea what it is fun it

every time

when it's aside from the first time I

didn't find it but I think after every

after that I found it every time it's

accidentally stumbled upon it

they're trying

and then last time I didn't find it when

it was the last one remaining

I'm just being around the same area all

the time that obviously not going to

find it

you don't see your camera

I care about them

I care about at the moment

it helps when devs knows where it is

yeah but obviously one person is

building a design level and then they

have the other people trying the lemon

and then when other developers try the

level that's this level for me or this

field that was made the other videos

should be honest and say that is

terrible this isn't even fun

I didn't find anything

but I can't find that

that green line down because I'm not

looking properly

okay

I'm still in the heat on this way up

cameras understand

I have no idea like this

I have absolutely no idea why that

single rings

I need a map

I just

I don't know anywhere it is

oh there it is

okay I found it when time turns out so I

couldn't locate where it is I still have

no idea where it is

uh

perfect I found it when the time runs

out so I could never second even locate

my device so now I need to find it again

have fun

I'm so confused oh there it is okay so

it's here

here it is

so it's above where this pipe is just

exited and then just goes straight up I

see I see

that makes sense

now I can locate it

perfect

wait wait yes

yeah after playing so many games

definitely

that's why they had several play testing

such

but they have like

I guess they have like people who are

the only play testers but they only test

the game because foreign

it's it's in the top part of the middle

between the house being just out of here

probably

now I know like this

yes it's

this level has been

their Airlines

and then there died like this

these things here

we should send one day I was like okay

turn around of some sort

okay

I'll come on

try this me being Cameron

give me size

how hard this is hit something that

close

all right that's the way to get if you

do it in the bags

oh

and then the last one is here

perfect

ly at the moment

yeah now I'm working around the same

area again

I've already been here

I've only been here too oh now

I'm

this is the first one okay

[Music]

[Music]

so what's the first one

[Music]

now I just need to find the

but we're actually so

there's a lot of artists

unless that's one that's that ring I've

picked up now

it's it's like a whole part of the level

haven't builty here

which is here

yeah the turn distance is so tough

that is doesn't have anything

oh there we go there's a month

and there's the two parts

foreign

[Music]

s to find

in 15 seconds

and one of them is probably the power

straightener head

the other one no idea

and there it is

this one

hey I love to create a code slash mod to

increase the object draw distance but

I'm pretty sure it's set individual for

this one oh that would be annoying if it

sets for each one

yeah

this is like

places you should be able to handle a

bit more than this this is like

that in the places just be able to

handle very draw distance of this

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

has been an annoyance

and I don't like it

should change the price of it

yeah I guess it you can face lines to

the new place

no problem

okay more Birds no

all right

they're probably animal dreams because

all right there's another one

let's see this oh

that [ __ ] anymore

okay so the remaining

to

yeah

[Music]

and there's the bird

there's other birds

this scene

all right let me get drafted

[Music]

[Music]

there are three cats left now oh no I'm

not

now

oh no

this isn't good

one one of them should be up here

serious note from it

a nice shot

oh there's there's

[Music]

no it's just one left

somewhere I have no idea what this would

be

okay okay

well I'm getting the hanger Heats I

guess

someday I'll be done with this

[Applause]

up there

try to

no other stuff

to get so close before they

got it right

because

since I know this shortcut

I will utilize it but then I still have

that final ring if I should know where

it is now

miss it again

you can

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

well

I basically lost

about everything else is I have no idea

where it is interesting stuff is

oh this is going to take home the whole

day

oh wait up here

that's about that

as soon as I get up here I find these

two birds

and there are the arch engines down here

is it remaining

inside this thing

yes finally I'm going to succeed in all

right

I'm finally completed it

after after many attempts but I did it

eventually

we're still barely knew where everything

else

spiffing is my shiny War medals mind you

but valuable all the same

well the lighting is much more spiffy

do you want to play again just for fun

oh yeah yes yes please it's for so fun

[Music]

it was so funny I wanted to eat again

you should change it to

you no I fell down

the clippings through the lemon

oh

do you want to play again and torture

yourself that should be what this says

at least I got a checkpoint here

okay not walking off the lemon

[Music]

thank you

I wanted to press this thing

okay

am I supposed to go here

getting this powered up and then

yeah

thank you from the bunny Barrel yay

yeah and now I

what's this thing

oh it is actually nothing I can get done

with

it

meat meat

oh and see another thing okay

okay but I still had things to collect

over there

don't get back here

I think

it was quite a delay yeah interesting

very interesting

[Music]

nice that hit for exposed wings

wait a minute

that's not where I came from I said

but honestly

maybe it was

no

that's where I came from

I wasn't done there yet

platform

s now

I went

oh no I'm bossy

well I guess so

race down the track and collected dragon

egg within the time limit when the timer

runs out the dragon egg will disappear

so hurry get ready

this texting okay

this text is very slow

okay it is Dragon Age

let's do this

that was pretty that was

preparing

I'm sorry no together with my way

I have a Dragonite whiskey

let me know how long this track is

what

happened

yeah my way

yeah

and I'm still not reached the end

thank you

I'm actually stare at this level

oh I mean it was close

click new takes it

hello water

hydrate I should do ignore them

I'll try again this looks fun

I thank the description again

I have to wait for that thing to show up

yeah the time is yes

just short enough

I'll do gems it's just short enough to

not be able to do it there we go that

was some

yeah

what sorry about that inspiring

I just removed it came but it started

telling me

and when I got it busy faster

do that time for nothing

there we go

here we go

near the bouncing on the edge today

you have to be very quick

look

why

this side is very hard to stick it again

I don't have to touch them right

there we go

oh I did it

okay

and I started doing the work

it's fine anything yeah you've never

heard like him now I got the extra time

that doesn't sound good that means that

okay

practice chicken

that's now it comes down here

excuse me God

nice can I jump over that

cheers go

away

[Music]

okay let's

let's do this better now

but

gentlem finish time

because I'm not doing it

[Music]

this is going to be a fun lemon

[Applause]

I feel like

electric truck doesn't start a new land

and it's like English day

I must

foreign

[Music]

I see the bounce thing there but

this might be a five piece yeah this

side is rolling fish I need to get back

to that game if it runs well again

because I switched which graphics card

is running on

like slowly

hey

perfectly collided with that ball

what why is it the side like this

very easy design like this

what what can't you press that I I

gladly jump across the whole level like

that but

but um

I didn't intend for that happen

okay let's see

oh

Release Me

because you can basically not

touch

anything

because the previous run I did

where I basically got to empty obstacle

almost perfectly

I barely made it to the egg anime so you

have to do this almost perfectly

maybe the extra time for the

light Jam is enough to actually be

allowed to do a few more mistakes

I did get stuck here okay

well

when they are lower to the ground they

are still obstacle

so yeah I guess and also by the time

around like you still have to be able to

restart

okay I'll suggest me of an old amusement

park in New Jersey called action park it

was close down before I was born eating

numbers injuries but it looks

well

I don't remember if you mentioned that

before maybe you haven't

ever heard from somewhere else

that's nice

you have to meet near perfect on this

run

why okay I guess moving forward in the

eyes

yeah you have to be

foreign

going in the wrong way

okay

and like a second theory slow

tell me okay you don't tend to be

perfect but

it's very easy to mess up miss those

bumpers

and to get enough time to deal with pump

base to basic attitude

maybe someone else is good at Pampers

okay but I'm just better than okay to be

honest

foreign

myself

okay

suddenly it was

like 10 seconds

[Music]

I didn't ask me if I wanted to do this

just for fun

because they know that wasn't fun it's

finally telling them

there was a water slide that did a loop

at the end so most people actually all

of them wound up stopping at the apex of

the loop and slammed their face on the

bottom of the slide instead

I love teeth last night

yay

no wait there's nothing I did it

I press the flame button

um

I was supposed to press this charge

button to Flame I forgot about that wait

a minute

what did I end up here what what's going

on

what is this

I'm confused

help me

I miss you missing I'm missing an egg is

there no platform I haven't been to you

yeah

uh I pressed go back button

I forgot this

is my kids hopefully the tallest tower

is the tallest tower

I was pressing the wrong buttons in this

game

I'm pressing the correct buttons is the

games that's wrong

to be honest

that's this

Jupiter's decision to change how

the buttons are

actually you did not get time

everybody looks high in Buffalo with me

oh what no

get me in here I went all the way up

here

no he's

oh don't don't find the hell they can

wait a minute wasn't there

wasn't there that guest in here

yeah there we go

and this takes me up

please enjoying me

guys

F no ice

I need a power up I don't have so I need

to get back here later

how do I get out of here

maybe jump too early maybe whatever

reason up

[Music]

but yeah

that was that adventure of this game

crazy invention

so

come on

all right

down here

all right

I want to go in here I did I don't know

what the hell I want

wait I didn't know what I want I want

this

browse my fine wear Spyro and spend spin

I'm happy for everyone who has shown up

it's been

getting nice it's been fun

you're further into the game than I am

are you playing and I I mean it was

yesterday then I am that was basically

it is about

[Music]

we got to the Cloud area but got stuck

[Music]
