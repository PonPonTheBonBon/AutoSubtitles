DSi that didn't work hello P

girl yeah it says null you're null

everyone is null why didn't my message

work what's going

on here we

go

a crazy

intro never play this game this would be

the I guess it would

be a side game spinoff I don't know

there you go didn't that one I guess I

didn't add the singular

form I look

languages six of them select language

okay let's s English can of loud

it

so press cross the start checking memory

card World Tour or announcer arcade

World Tour

options we'll see if everything is fine

here game difficulty beginning I know

begin

Advanced expert let's go to medium

then oh you actually got 69 it doesn't

affect the menu

though oh nice then I have to change

uh I did I forget set the controls

again I probably have oh look oh you

can't see it but yeah we got set

controls

again why would the default be not

analog

controls that's a bit

weird but other ways the vi the stuff

it's kind of the

same but is

the

okay

whatever

same and yes uh still not polish no

would a be poish bunny

tummy I hope you like it

so I do have to restart game give

me uh

Okay

now what's with that measuring

speed uh it is

Calin Mega

Henry it's some

I mean I could start with dark oh it's

starting immediately no selecting

anything just immediate

start oh the graphics looks

interesting oh look they wrot it more

more

correctly okay so arcade just start

immediately no

no okay I

crashed Good Start Good Start fun

fun

yeah the graphical difference in this

game compared to the other is quite

different and

the this should be

arcade I guess this is bit

arcade I'm not sure why it crash so

quickly yeah you cannot drive

in

Grass as quickly as in the previous game

going sound in motorcy this

weird game is quite different

from I'm dra more off the road than on

the

road

we oh Dr

Corner no problem

for

me go go

go okay oh there's no restart

option

oh mono let's go see that wasn't did I

just miss it

okay that was the warm up okay

why is there no menu or anything you

just search arcade and it starts

immedately let's let's start

over let's let's do this

by there we go

now okay let's let's do this

better there we go now I'm doing

very oh look at

there now do better you're straight into

the one come

on that's

it okay it's apparently I just don't

have I'm that's

yeah this game this game requires a bit

more skill than previous two game even

though this is the so-called arcade

mode I guess this the Good Start of the

getting used to the

game this this does try to simulate it

much more

than but still too quickly

yeah okay one more

TR

that look it

up

S

ring that would be

in hohenstein no

henin and stall in

Germany so this would be the wait a

minute

I don't

even oh just

another I don't even I don't even get

what's going

[Music]

on but

yeah thing is

in

Germany yeah

like don't exactly have

right this

time that wasn't big crash but no one

else was affected only me okay that that

sounds about

right yeah this game is quite different

from the other games oh the animated

otes are working again yeah I did fix

them no thanks to Twitch I had to fix

them

manually

so well but guess I'm driving sand

[Music]

now okay

no and I'm going

and I can't speak today

apparently it's

weird I he said select but the only man

is a

selection

anyway I had no problem speaking the

whole day I point doing

d as soon as to start streaming and

get my throat is getting clogged up

it can we

go

now

wow just

casually D around me like

that I'm supposed to win I'm number

one who just clipping through people

there we go perfect firstes

lap now let see if I can do hey you're

number two you should be in second

place y druming too much in the

grass think getting CL every

[Music]

way coming a long

moving

you actually don't know what happens

when you this is like first time ever I

play the

game so I do not have the

experience with how this game

works there we

go for position all right at least I'm

not

lost can let this be a knock

tournament just have to make sure I'm

not coming last every

time the bikes do feel quite big on this

track but the track feels very

small the voice is very

quiet barely

here W nice

no way I thought I was going too fast

there but yes the computer is still

faster there's cash ler on me how

rud and it doesn't even affect the

computer here we go now I'm draing fast

whoa

pris he one that's my name

navigating this mini for some

reason he one no

I'm no it's not way I'm

P do I

try what do I have to win R what is

this well hello I should read the chat I

think

when still can't be multiple

emotes why doesn't that

work that doesn't make any

sense that makes no sense of

one

it breaks one of them for some

reason for some reason it breaks when it

puts multiple of the

same

when does that happen that makes no

sense that makes absolutely no sense to

me

anyway what the fny sorry for not

responding guess that's probably with

the racing game I said okay at Le leak

pon pon can still become hydrated yeah

you cannot C double of the same emo why

is that the

scene good morning hello what the

pon I'm p p here oh now the swim is

on got to

St hey hi hi hello

P getting gross in the where

problem is the game doesn't give you a

pink by yeah that's

problem gra p w up I'm a p

Panda i r something yeah it works as

long as you don't post multiple of P

ponos which makes no sense to me at

all

so let me just take a quick look at what

the result is what is here what is here

indeed so if you P post that it breaks

and let me take a quick look at a

Midstream eror

checking now why doesn't it

work oh

I see what it

does but why does it do

that because it's only oh I I don't

get

what okay so I

apparently

no no it still still doesn't make any

sense to me I I know why why what it's

doing but I don't know why it's doing

I set it to check is this currently

uh is this currently a a pon pon emote

fix the code that because twitch gives

me the wrong code specifically only for

my

emotes and I'm losing my voice again I I

don't know what's going on with myself

twitch

sh

so and again I have

problem so it's for every okay so you

send a message every emote you put in

the message it

takes uh the uh the URL that twitch

gives and if it's a Pon emote it swaps

it out for the the it corrects the URL

so it becomes correct and it does that

for every emote that's why when you post

each emote it works

[Music]

fine but for some reason if you put

multiple of the same

emote they the duplicate breaks and this

does not makes any sense to me because

in that that case it for some reason

replaces what the URL is for every emote

of the same type every time you use that

emote but that doesn't make any sense to

me

what plus

P yeah so apparently that's an isue

which does not make any I don't even

know how to fix that because it

shouldn't even be doing

that I'm so

confused this is all twitch fault

anyway I don't know why I'm being

bullied by twitch

and

crashed cuz you're not allowed to slow

down in that

corner what the p is that

the

no which doesn't like bunnies apparently

not

I don't know

twit the twitch seems to work fine for

other

people what I'm supposed to do that I

cannot break because that that's not

allowed just need to go not as quickly

am I supposed

to this is very difficult and it was

just supposed to be medium level maybe

maybe I'm not good at this enough to

even go me

you maybe I'm just to begin there after

all but I'm no

beginner I'm a good

player I'm a very good

player

you at

[Music]

all I'm having issues with

everything I not even sure why there's a

timer there's a time limit because

that's what mot did with Arcane Mode

before but the time limit is so long

that I have more than one lap on that

timer one lap takes 1

minute but the timer increases for every

section I

complete on the final lap I time for

doing two

laps I want to get SED and crashed H

this is going to

oh

my this game is too

hard okay let's go to be

then oops that cute

pum and

just let

see because beginning might just be too

easy that's the

thing me is way too

easy oops until I run into the

grass they need some in between

difficulty

whoops okay I'm

getting

P this difficulty now I have

to he maybe maybe the game becomes even

can now just messing up

maybe I'm just a

beginner I'm bad at this game

apparently

oh

I

sleep and th

off into the

grass

time to cat

up I think it's a bit bit too easy to

catch up but

um I guess I'm just terrible at the

different yeah just like

that I it's terrible on the rest of the

lap

so too far to the right

there

music FS out it becomes

quiet there we

go and I says congratulations play on a

harder

difficulty

oh who the drivers haven't even reached

go yet

continue they give you so much extra

time snake f

is bance difficulty between begin

Advance well like medium difficulty I

guess

[Music]

whoa what's the left oh here we

go

yes

[Music]

W

okay that this is a laggy

level oh going

off I don't know if there's any extra

button to use here or

something I I should have read

instruction or

something that rate of exposion when

fall

already on the or something

apparently you said this is your first

play play and the bike hand different

from used to

yeah I'm bad at this

game I just I just such

difference checkpoint because we need

that 4

minutes like a left T what like 30

seconds to complete I can do like six

more

laps within the time

limit oh that was

bad probably something more I should do

when I just do this

guess they got the spring ion

her it does move

slowly maybe I can do something to

adjust

the oh there we

go

okay w

yeah I have no idea if there's any

technique I should use there or what the

technique would

be going off off the map good thing they

have the very

low strip of fls there

okay man just need to get us like you

had to get us to previous game yeah I

mean you're not

wrong you're not

wrong

okay which L was this which track was

this the sua

circuit I am familiar with the track

because

just kind of suuk is one that

that probably be driving on

least

[Music]

him driver is dead

what to

Che I not having a good day today I feel

like draw p no you cannot draw me that's

not

allowed drop F phone on

that's not

allowed or they're using a

pencil oh right Corners right that was

R hey don't let the J pass me I'm the

winner

here

AR

TI s

like who's tired am I tired wow I was

got tackled all of a

sudden yeah I'm kind of I'm not I don't

feel

tired I just feel

annoyed of all the things that are out

of my control that shouldn't even be

happening in the first

place it's just that I don't understand

SC try race Mar okay I don't know what

that is

but yeah I'm not going to win this race

this is going to be tricky I don't even

know how many races there are

anything well the first mod actually

told how many tracks there are

so how many have unlocked and how many

two unlocks

do it did tell

you second game told you there was eight

tracks per

tournament

well quick

that it's the XO I still I still don't

know what that is what's the green bar

it to make thead um I don't

know

temperature

turo

[Music]

Tero doesn't matter crash

on I'm so terrible at this

game Let's feel the met let's see the

bike explode I don't even know what the

me

is hard to BU up

anyway that's about Max it killes now it

goes

higher

yeah was

as

terrible you can retry but you do not

have the retry option from the menu so

you must finish the race before you can

retry oh just why with your hand and

it's gone and I crashed the first thing

that

happens the temperature engaged then

sure but what's the point of

it then point of what's the point of

having a time

limit I crashes St just to make it more

exciting

well

get away there you go

tackling the race has just become

violent

yeah it

is this is going to be the trickiest

game rude dud I had

break whoa too

quick

she on

hand my hand why did it show on your

hand

the feel like sometimes I can break it

while taking a CO

sometimes I

can't I don't understand this

game

well yes the computer is completely

unaffected by

it and then

vet racing it's like Mar cart without

items

yeah

hand but I need my hands to play the

game I need a better idea of what okay

that works

better

bell bell

exposed

head

P yeah I'm not doing something

great just for that I don't have the

same

control

well that was a pain again I'm going to

be stuck here

forever this is supposed to be the

beginning of

I mean I am I am terrible at this

game I guess I'll just have

to become better at

it to to be fair even on beginner

difficulty they are kind of difficult

this

one

it's just me being bad at the

game the difficult selection is just

Placebo it doesn't do anything

see I just believe that they become

easier therefore it feels easier

yes get it yeah I'm getting more used to

the game that

that's a driving to the grass but but

still

there we go now I have first position

it's not a huge lead

over well second place

but that was too

slow

well this it

[Music]

works

come back

here I was supposed to be in

League heck

s that time me in the next

one oh man am

I'm this game

is there is

something

goodbye final

LP

was way too much breaking

there

okay we taking on the

inside

come

on I was ding in sand but

was yeah is going to take Tak me a while

before

I get get

yet I cannot let this game defeat

me when they don't get up off the skar

because they kicked it oh oh

my

look oh thir position that doesn't

count for some

reason

okay turn into cake

what when did you turn into

cake where's my phone

here

so because I'm feeling

sweet ah a nice and sweet

cake

okay time to

win cuz I haven't try that

before so let's do that for

once who where do people come

from you also here

today

turn into

candy oh still going too

quickly thought I was going very slow

there Dragon Bard

yep that would be Dragon

Ball

at the fragon has seven balls or

whatever oh

adds type exclamation point

adds toer real Panda about

the come on turn turn

turn yep seven Dragon

B hello red dragon do you have seven

dragon balls but do you only have a

lower amount or

more oh I'm I'm not going to win this

every time I get in the second lap I'm

just messing

up hey you're a dragon Grant my wish I

want to P wait since PL dragons grant

wishes I don't think red dragon is a

wishing

Dragon red dragon is a null Dragon

apparently everyone is

null depends on the day wait this

changes what is interesting interesting

interesting Burger yes go the wrong

way for some reason I'm still in fourth

place that doesn't make any

sense I need luck for a while can I

borrow your with your two rabbit feet

what you don't get my rabbit

feet I need

them I have two rabit feet

my rabbit feet aren't that lucky

apparently ding all the unluckiness I

have maybe I've used up all my

luckiness final lap yeah but the lead is

so far

ahead so so far

and I'm still struggling with these

guys this time the computer

FL Fly

Away

boink that's over welcome back everyone

who had

it um don't rely on a rabbit's foot for

luck it didn't work out so well for the

rabbit no

yeah hi On's

arm is

there yeah I should carry you under my

arm then we go

out to a

party and was

horrifying and no one told you about ads

I know one Ty smash Mark

ads because I was buy busy racing I

couldn't do it and the B can apparently

not do it

either yeah this is going to take

forever yes I pressed for

try there's a bug underne your arm

squish it squish it

n999 okay let let's start over from

beginning apparently because that's

apparently what the game wants there's

no save or

anything let's go check the other mode

instead this is a terrible

game arcade is not the arcade let's go

to world world

tour think ra championship this is the

real

one let's pick the pink team pink

four

okay

here we go I don't know let's go with

default I don't know if this was the

pink bike hi baby

bye look a pink bike okay now let's do

the race for done enough

practicing I would argue I'm not done

enough practicing this is a hard game

and this is the easiest difficulty boom

explosions but it's it only affect

me okay can we can we restart can I quit

what happens if I

quit hey hey but I'm no bug I'm a

rock I know let's start

over I shoot hey what's going on here

bonus point

okay

now no

crashing well that wasn't a crash I

guess it's

fine got three laps I can catch up with

these I have won this track before not

on the track more than the track said oh

I'm going we a lot of track

now

PR

you hey no I want to go around you not

bump into you at least wasn't the crash

this time

oh quick for that

corner

dead

what what's going on here people are

dying in chat this is

unacceptable isn't there rule against

being uh

[Music]

rude not

anymore I didn't mean it I accidentally

smashed someone's head

in

okay I forgive

you so okay so this game does not keep

track of where you are in perment or

anything it does not have a restart

option even though it can basically quit

and restart but you have to restart the

whole tournament maybe that's why they

didn't include

it yeah this this game is going to be a

challenge at least it's a tournament but

maybe they have same rules you must

win that means that if you play in the

arcade mode you can never save and quit

you have to complete the arcade in one

sitting this

is this is the third motor racer game

from

2000 and they apparently do not allow

you to save mid

game like between levels I would say to

continue later that's not an option in

the arcade mode now I'm playing the

championship mode I don't not know if

they have

it should huge step back cuz the

previous two game had

it and is this the same developers I'm

not sure what's going

on this is the

uh strange game out of the

bunch I mean motor is not really like a

great series of games but

hey I should I should complete every P

one game this one

included race

completed

on okay continue I don't know do I have

to win the

tournament it's only three

races hydrate POS take going do another

H yeah this is going to

in started by crash that's about right

okay what happens with

and I still

have I still have to restart from the

beginning I mean sure it's only three

races

but new I

haven't you have to complete three races

without

quitting what a strange

game

I it like same between but didn't very

weird maybe they come on what is

this

wait it LO the game much quicker than

the second game second game was really

slow

I mean the first game wasn't too quick I

know

oh I am going to I'm going to

win and I'll show

you as I thr into the sand but

still I guess I can come back to life

now yeah you're allowed to come back to

life well welcome back Adan to

live you haven't missed much

sit on aan chest

cookie yeah let's um let's win

this

get nice recovery

but I mean not sure I shouldn't have

gone in s first place

but I saw they got out of the S really

quickly but apparently

not get out

way

now it's time to

win

oh

almost cookie

cookie final

lamp

okay can I can I can I do this can I

actually win a race for

once but on the easiest

difficulty I don't think this guy is

supposed to move like it does it moves

like quicker than the

the par Parallax effect is weird the sky

is moving quicker than the things in the

background I don't think a sky is

supposed to move like

that we can have made the mo Sky static

and that would been more

realistic there we go

first I don't know how you even said

your own name the game 300 Point that's

a lot of

points

continue oh I don't get a cookie pon pon

I mean you can still take it you

know that's just extra

flavor what would you do

this okay time to win again

but of course even though I won the last

race I'm still starting at the last

position if I come last in previous race

I still started in last

position

like at least e speed allowed you to

start in an earli

position oh forgot about that corner

dead okay I'm not winning this

race I don't even know what the next map

track

is k k

kill

then comped is continues like nothing

happens I me show you could say that run

into the from behind and the computer

seen to me behind I shouldn't be

affected by

it I

guess I

gu let's it's

begin

yeah that's how they should balance

it in the beginner regardless of how you

Collide which each other only confusion

is medium difficulty whoever is behind

can fly guess

crash like some kind of balancing system

and hardest difficult always the play

crashes instead that that would be fun

anyway maybe I can at least not come in

last position that would be nice lot of

players have already reached the goal to

Finish Line Al they're just on the last

lap but but

still

yeah share for me I'm in fourth

position for a pink

bike I didn't mean like that but

okay

no okay that was that win then no win

for

me me if I Le get Force position which I

struggle with because I almost collide

with the bike which makes me trash

but

well yeah

sure

so

four prision

will yeah the

third the driv in third place I already

cross the finish line so I can get the

fourth position at

least

W oh my

terrible 330

points

okay I just have to

continue I love man

Road okay just I love man

Road someone wrote something on the

server that me

take

and

so let's continue CL continue yeah it's

just Casher roads of I love

man

and they got some petrol for

80 a

ler Bo there was

[Music]

a

oh yeah this isn't going

great

goodbye

the Dr is kind of

bad I think of Dr about around the

corner it should put that warning

sign Le one there but two of the

well that's not fair and then the

computer just

continues just side

swipes like a sliding on the side and

tackles continues on like

nothing

I'm strugling with this

racer

these Ro feels very

ni

h

[Music]

oh yeah

um

I'm crashing everywhere

now race

completed well at least I come second in

the whole tournament that's

something that count be something

right you

finish where are the second spaces in

this sentence they're barely on a

Spanish

spaces you finish second in the

season second

place does it save that did the game

crash the game

stopped is it going to continue am I not

going to be able to play this game

because it crashes after you finish AR

after you

finishes

tournament Championship that's what it's

called

well it looks

to um

what

hello I guess I'm not playing this game

then

yeah that's that doesn't work it just

stopped when there are no spaces to me

it looks

like

well that didn't

work but

game let's just start

game

so game broke

apparently I don't know if it's saved

anything it could could have

saved but likely

not not

arcade arade shouldn't be the first

option I

guess let's go

game I mean I have one idea to fix the

uh

thing

that could solve the issue with

the that's if I do uh

this

here we

go it refreshes the

chat and now it's completely

broken something SS me that wasn't a fix

that wasn't break why did it

break

wait wait that doesn't make any sense I

must Miss

something

wait now how is this not a

what now I don't know what's going on

that was even more weird

oh wait a

minute oh now I

see because I'm using the wrong

scene there we go now we should be

working Midstream chat fixing there we

go now okay triple

modes every much should work there you

go I fixed

it

go

what happen the first place is the game

going to crash as well in that case in

that case this game is in

incompatable it says null for you

but you can set your pronouns if you

want I have to check if it if the

pronoun is null in that case I'll not

show it simple as

that I haven't changed it yeah I mean

yeah would it seem you

haven't yeah it should be blank if you

don't have anything set there

for SAR because P pun is

sporting for S because p is sporting for

half an

hour 45

minutes 1

hour okay I said I said I was going to

win and I'm doing the worst at the

moment for where because PS are

FY let me check wa it's back to advanc

apparently and screen is is change this

it anyway oh yeah p fun in a SP Sports

the sports part is very nice

looking

Sonic mobian bunny but I'm a bunny

[Music]

but I guess I guess it could be like an

artwork of pon pon in the Sonic style as

a

bu could be a thing I guess that's a

something I should

draw what Strange

Music

I don't think I need to slow down

the well

yes touch some grass that was a that was

me someone did

like how quickly can you touch grass in

each Mario game how quickly can you

touch grass in each most ra the

game okay okay

okay Lo down way too early but

fine

come on was still not slowing down

enough I was slowing down a lot

there apparently not

enough apparently not

enough and then no no no no there's

there's that

corner I confused where I was I was

looking at the wrong place on the mini

map because I'm cheating at looking at

the mini map and I'm in last place I

don't want to be in last

place the last place is the worst

place me zero

points

no oh so forth position again

oh next no I'm going to

quit I'm going to

quit do some

[Music]

testing I can't do that

now

so quick

and this one track I guess I've done it

so many times now I still go off but

much

easier being be it sure is a bit

tricky

the game does contain a lot of tracks so

maybe that's why they are so much

quicker to load because the tracks are

each are lower quality to fit more in

the

game no come

on

they didn't change the

change that

anyway not going so well I'm doing

terribly in this

game why wait wait let's go

back why am I struggling with this one

why don't I do the other

one the this one above

Barcelona

Barcelona

the 125 M by B

racing okay yeah I don't know which

technique I should

use don't doing worse

now

oh like Prett time in AR in mode when

it's like switch between

those I'm doing so bad I'm doing so

bad this one is harder

in this one this game is not is

[Music]

not

what is not H

nice not I'm just not going to do

anything wow okay for some reason this

is harder cu the computers are

quicker then in

the when I played AR

mode I never crashed that in Arcane

Mode is just

it's the pink bike is the worse because

it's

pink

there we go that's how we do

it but is in second

position I need to win the first

race well I don't need to win the first

one

next ignor

him is that

cheating flipping the bike over there

almost okay final app why is the lead

there so much quick

okay playing one song and it SKS do on

the

song

yeah I'm not sure why why the computer

was so

quick do yeah it's still the same point

system F was so quick in this

race so so

quick

sorry I clear the chat H I'm back

hello having a

good I'm you part I'm trying J but this

is not going to be a great stream today

I feel

like

get one

bye-bye but now it should hopefully not

say

null do you think this is United

States everyone is quicking to me with

the blue no red and white

stripes and the white

stars on the blue

Fields it was only that at the starts

but this is an interesting

map is it low gravity or

[Music]

something okay so easily to P off

apparently that was some low poly

bur no t

sure come on come on come on come

on

no well I think that was a leader so I

guess that's a good thing but

still

look at the little poly

Birds low poly textless

Birds probably a lot of techniques I

need to

utilize get more speed out of the

bike just I don't know them I should

read the instruction book but come on

can they stop just haing

me y yeah this game this game

is this

game is something all

right I'm getting tired of this

game

rolling around at the speed up

sound got got places to go got to follow

my

rainbow the bright flag

rainbow I'm playing a terrible game that

annoys me at the

moment hey papa

W it's see

the the thing works

now it says that Papa wolf is a he which

kind of makes sense but for the papa

part but it doesn't show anything if you

haven't set it up

yet yay pronoun

support now I know how to refer to you

people

so

slippery guess I shouldn't be

like yeah I need

like

okay you know

what yeah I'll continue I'll lose next

race I would assume was he the P gives

away well

yeah happy m p

p look at those pixelated one

[Music]

M

aha need a race

track

okay apparently you need a RAC

track yeah I have no technique playing

this game I'm just doing

whatever so not sure what a checkpoint

is

nice I was tacking to the

one nice just

crashed wait this is a start this isn't

where I supposed to

go I am not good at this

[Music]

game the game is not

self-explanatory and the game was not

designed well with like the controls for

the game is terrible as

well Al no they cannot require you

to like the game game's default settings

is uh using

the single single button to accelerate

so you have full acceleration no

acceleration so they cannot require you

to have the have controlling your

acceleration cuz you cannot control your

acceleration with default controls and

certainly the game should not require

you to go into settings and changing the

default controls just to be able to play

the game

probably I mean they might I mean that

just adds to the teress of the

game but the thing is H I think the game

is broken anyway because it last time I

got second place and the game got stuck

uh so I'm just going to finish this and

see if the game just gets stuck stuck

after you complete a championship in

that case the game is impossible to play

and then I can move over to motor 3

instead

which just Le is playable

okay it's for Papa wolf on has

Turbo

or block okay I mean but that's like

pretend

turo Pixel People yes wait

how I mention that I imaged that 4

minutes ago you have 4 minutes

l e o n

yeah

terrible terrible I look the many

options appear here on the screen back

greetings welcome dread gas oh because I

didn't am I still playing beginner

because yes this is the easiest game

mode

I'm

PE

is a controller setting that doesn't

have

pitch can I

like not have terrible

control because how are you supposed

to how are you supposed to control

because if you you have to control the

pitch and uh I guess it works guess it

Works still the game is very hard at the

the beginner

level

to I can't even do

this I can change things here

but do what

the power

curves care po

but I have no idea for those

settings pretend terrible who all the sh

turns that break your speed but doesn't

affect the

computers yeah because I probably not

have the correct technique is PS a PS

one game

yep it reminded

me

my wait why did it change my controls

did I said this one accidentally maybe I

did it reminded me to Harry Potter to

Playstation One Harry

Potter I iume

I maybe I should play Harry Potter

instead that's a

PNG uh uh what it my my bunny

yes it is a portable networking

graphic for some reason now it's

easy and then and then they just come

flying by me there and now they're going

to be in first position forever now I

don't know I don't know how to play this

game that's

problem

oh w w

hard you should probably have do some

kind of

technique make something like

that

who I'm trying I'm trying to experiment

with game but it's definitely not easy

to understand for

me for you you might understand the game

perfectly fine

but hey

oh get my computer

I can't I can get like second position

it's just not good enough to reach the

Le

whoa whoa whoa whoa I should try to not

steer so much there it doesn't matter

who the leader is just cannot reach the

leader if I we actually tackled the

previous leader and now there's a new

leader so if I were to tackle this

leader accidentally obviously oh wait I

pass the leader

wow well I'll take back what I

said all right on the

bike come

[Music]

on if I accidentally attack the lead

there some other back will take the lead

and then I will not be able to catch up

with that leader but I have no problem

being ahead of everyone who isn't the

leing I don't

know

final lap let's go and music his bugged

as usual it's like it starts playing the

next track and then it skips back to

what the track is supposed to

play the this is scratch it doesn't know

how to play it

properly

anyway I hope I win this time and then

I'll get back to

chat don't feel like I'm ignoring you

I'll be

at there we go finally firstes position

he is one Hy hi pon pon hello jellyfish

welcome back I'm struggling in this game

but I'm doing my

best he is1

h

love yeah I should I and this dragon

I recommend you

video no what is there mini

wait no wait didn't

I wait how is what what's video meaning

oh is it last by use p no I already used

that one it's it's too

heavy because it runs

like

uh it doesn't what was it

called I don't remember it runs the

[Music]

uh uh I didn't know the

actual now we learn it this one is the

ideal body you may not like it what the

PE performance looks like I don't I

that's a cool tool if you didn't of

OBS oh even if it's not a heavy program

they use a couple other tools and they

add up over time I mean video Mini at

this point it's running like it's not

it's not like it's running what is what

is that

called uh I don't remember what the

engine is called it's running a whole

game engine it's it makes the uh my

computer

lag

uh it's basic Pro P but there is there's

another one uh someone suggested that I

try out and it's free and I haven't

tried that I could use it I could see

what engine is that's I think that was

was like um

actually natively program what I don't

know what it's called Unity Unity system

yes it runs

Unity well maybe I tried the wrong

version because there was a Unity logo

when it started up and maybe that's a

not the Mini

version maybe I got the wrong

version maybe it wasn't the unit log

when it started maybe I confused with

some the pretty sure run be Tu and

it's it has oh yeah I crashed

immediately the first thing I do nice

nicely

done and uh yeah running a

whole sure you can might be able to

disable certain elements of the engine

so it doesn't run as heavily but running

a whole running Unity for just a

PNG is it is

like someone probably can come up with a

good

example it's a way too heavy engine to

run just a

PhD and i' rather want like a script or

something for OBS to do something with

the

model based on the Audio Level would be

nice to

have yeah there was there was some other

PNG uh software that you could get from

Steam which again has the problem that I

have run

Steam unless I can download it from

Steam and run it without steam because

it's free it doesn't need like

steam but yeah having to run Steam just

to play run a PNG is again

Overkill I need I need some an actual

lightweight program that is preferably

programmed in like the whatever C C++ C

whatever any of those and that just does

some it doesn't have like a whole game

engine behind

it

yeah my computer is not that

powerful

so but it can't run

like games quite well but if I'm going

yeah streaming at the same time it's a

struggle at the

moment and I struggling this game as

when come

on come

on

my computer maybe the pink bike is the

worst bike in the

game and I'm just losing because I'm

doing done bad there's no stats or

anything

just pick pick a team but there's no

stats and I don't know if these are real

teams or anything I don't know because I

don't watch Motor

Racing

and I'm doing so

bad as usually I struggle just to get

past the

the sometimes I struggle get get getting

stuck at the second position can't reach

leader and sometimes I'm getting stuck

like last position can't get past the

one one driver racer whatever and then I

struggle keeping my fourth position

because the the one behind gets ahead

and is

crashing what or I

crash for some reason it's a very easy

to crash there I can bump a lot of walls

but that and the computer just doing

something

there I I can bump a lot of walls but

just specifically that one makes me

Crush like I bum that but I guess it was

in a different

angle I'm I'm I'm easily

confused ow and maybe I had higher speed

or something I feel like I bump the one

the same way

there yeah I might just be confused and

not understand what's going on and

that's my problem at the

moment trying to get Target my speed but

it's hard as like down in the

corner wee going to the

Moon oh terrible terrible terrible

terrible anyway let's go back

to what you right H yeah is also an

instance of unit and E Resources yeah

maybe it's because I have a good piece

but never had trouble but yeah yeah that

would be why you wouldn't have trouble

with it but it's a good idea to try to

pick a software that doesn't take a lot

of

resources poor p SP yeah broid or vtu

Studio I don't it was video

Whatever uh me like running node G

JavaScript for a single web page yeah

yeah basically I think I think it would

be more efficient for me to just do an

HTML page with my and then for have some

way to make it animate based on that I

think that would be more performance

efficient than using

video oh the low po level yes that's

level who else wants s watch because of

this game I don't even know what the

Swiss swis Swiss watch is have you play

SU the yet motor series on streaming

nope I am

not I should maybe post a link link or

something to my document of every game I

played did someone say maybe I should

try that this track the three makes me

want

the on

sword oh yes definitely want the

sword swords

everywhere

anyway yeah my computer is terrible it's

just

Willington okay final track can I at

least get a position can I

win if I win I will win the the whole

tournament and I did manage to win a

race like

this oh come

on and the way the computers but bumps

me and I fly away but they just continue

on their track unaffected by the

bumping

completely

unaffected

okay okay I'm in third place so it's not

terrible

I'm in fourth position so it's

ter

okay oh here we

go

wion why do they

make

um why do they make ads for

swords

what whatever I don't even know what

wion swords are like a one guess will be

swords but sometimes names of things are

misleading I can't see anything there's

a guy in the camera

and

way thank you okay second place I do

want the first place otherwise I won't

win I think it really depends on who is

deleting no no wait I don't remember how

much points I

have the second place gives me 100

points first place gets there we go

that's how you do

it that's how you do it

okay oops too much too

much oh bad

landing watch

out get out of the

way nice nice

oh oh come

on

oh all right I guess that was that win

the whole tournament is

over come

[Music]

on there we go that wasn't that

hard it says I'm in fifth position but

I'm in fourth

position

murdered what a terrible

game now it say I'm for in

position oh that's so much for

getting quicker

but oh well I got third

place can just quit and not get the

price

k

you finished third whoa and the game

freezes yeah the game is broken I cannot

win this game because the game is so

incredibly hard compared

to this game at the easiest difficulty

is harder than the previous two games

are at medium

difficulty oh well this game is broken

right
