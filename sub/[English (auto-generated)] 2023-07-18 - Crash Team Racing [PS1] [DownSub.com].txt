performance
that's how it works in it half a cup of

foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
wow
grinding
Hearts
what do you want
[Music]
[Music]
down
[Music]
grinding the game
why are you thinking about all this is
all right
now okay
I'm actually like an ice cream cone oh
yeah
assessments
I wish I had one
oh I can't find everything
sadly it it breaks in a big display I
don't have any control over there I just
don't know I actually have some control
because I killed anything
[Music]
because it only breaks in some of them
and I'm suspecting that's gonna teach
you all or including those differently
[Music]
and yeah that's the most no that's not
easy same because the Emoji Works thing
it's just someone's gonna break
some of them right
[Music]
no
oh nice
[Music]
all right
[Music]
[Music]
and of course at least one of them
all right
actually
yes you do baby
[Music]
[Applause]
now don't give that direction oh my
God yeah
that's me
like
so for some reason it doesn't change
that one as an emoji
and I think it's breaks due to that but
some of them
this one it does Jesus and emoji
so therefore if you do
uh
this no it's
okay so because it doesn't really say
carrot as a Emoji it illustrates as text
and therefore it will just do it as text
yeah for some reason there wasn't
industrations
[Music]
every emotion has an emoji
that's the father
[Music]
all right I'm connecting to that more at
some point
oh
no not definitely anything
hang on
[Music]
I'm missing everything
tomorrow
[Music]
okay
now you're right here
on this face
and this is Frozen games
[Music]
