[Music]

um

hi hey welcome

my headphone side

we're after all the chain

welcome Mata nice to see you here

I hope you're having a great time

I think this screen is quiet that's why

I don't hear anything

yeah there's some noise here

I've been playing this game for eight

and a half hours and I've gotten a bit

more than halfway in Collectibles well

it says 61 so I can see

he working from home again

working from home watching fun fun

playing that sounds like a great time

and

so

I was changing power so yesterday I met

the

approx lady because there is a fox in

this game so I should probably go and

discover

that area now

which is street that door

hmm

I think yes how do I open this door

no problem

no fairy telling me what to do a little

bunny

so there was a power up it's just really

last that long

now

what is this one

maybe I can

but I'm not ready to go to the next

world yet

what was this story broke down yes so if

I go back in here

and because this should be uh

I press the charge button

he will send out an electric charge

yes here you go

[Music]

and don't don't mind that this is

possible I think it's easy

it is embarrassed a model still

but it is using spider's texture

for some reason even though it's mostly

just glowing I'm not sure it's why it's

necessary

virus are nice and why it's necessary to

have aspire's texture when it's just

glowing

anyway

yeah my chat bunny

it's almost like them

made sure it doesn't reach I need to

find a different way

well I can go back to where I did Mama's

thing showed up

[Music]

and immediately prevented me from

continuing the game

[Music]

no wrong button I should switch this

well that was close

and dangerous snowballs

that's it and

you can see this game has a map

we are trying to restart my camera hold

on okay

hopefully it's time don't miss much

you're taking it down and watching

yeah vanity

what's it this way

[Music]

oh yeah

no I need to go through this thing again

yep I have to go through this thing

again

wait did I have to restart all the way

from here

really

how annoying

well

I need to find a checkpoint what's that

checkpoint close by

this one there

I guess I could

figure

the attack was way over

in there I think

thank you

when this checkpoint is into that area

where I died

this in there okay it's a bit annoying

[Music]

and these are not all right

these aren't easy to deal with

yeah with the heat boxes are so big

okay back yeah you haven't missed much

I missed

[Music]

arm is being silly wait a minute

wait if there is a checkpoint here why

didn't you give me a checkpoint last

time

okay you can't hurt face

why is this snow or end all the terrain

double signing such a waste of resources

when they struggling images

multiple PS2 games where it detects the

polygons of two-sided

yeah no pointer

these are

not now

yeah that was a good timing

beautiful

so

yeah it was down there I couldn't go

because

foreign

was blocking

no I can go here

and that was the whole Center there

someone was blocking me

can I

point of this

and there

are any countries finding that

what is what is the point of Nissan

can I increase the height of it

because it is

let's say a suspicious platform

so it's probably a way for me to

increase the item

yeah he's not a fan of the attacks

okay I need to find some

there's oh there's something

interesting

and there's a platform

there's a button I meant

a button on a platform

there you go

hello bird

you can do that

anyway

come here bear

Point Blank

well I wanted to see what this was all

about

pick up everything

a secret area

with a blue h

uh okay

[Music]

look destroying stones

with your head not recommended to do in

real life

okay got this thing open up here let's

see what this is all about

click suspiciously empty

including gems

oh

and now floating platforms

foreign

[Music]

that was one of the rules

well I can't I can't jump not not

farther

good

Ness

okay

conservation time

this is

to get up here

and there we go

all right I can't just charge those I

don't need that oh gems

so much Gems

thank you

oh that was that area clear enough

my name is sense money

that stuff

how to get up there

and doesn't seem to be anything this

morning

foreign

and strange polygons

oh that was that area

I think I cleaned out

there was a weird area

and

that's nice of time by them

[Music]

yeah okay

so what's in this area

in Mama's first

yeah yeah yeah

it's amazing preventing me from getting

this light chain

oh no Hunter

foreign

abilities can through the glacier

you want Hunter to go in there again

right wait again

oh

oh yeah for dancing

well

yeah Hunter has the guys today there

again because I didn't get everything

and my girl was to get that 100

uh it has to move forward second

[Music]

okay I have to get more for it

oh there we go

so this area contains one more egg and

one more light gem

hmm

okay that is nothing much

this is

oh well salutations

oh you're actually calling me Evelyn

you've done your research

I can appreciate that

hope you're doing good today I am going

well I am playing as Hunter so I

arguably

but um

but yes I'm

I'm happy

sorry about that

I need some more hydrates

I am happy to see you

to see new people here

so

I wasn't wait a minute so this is for

this is just a part of it so it's just

wait is this the whole

maybe this is the hunter level

and I might know

foreign

let's see I want it excuse me

okay I can't talk to you

mainly

just start it's some weird polygons

okay why can't you can't make it

I ain't happy you found

my channel I'm curious to see how you

found it like to recommend it or

it was like

you were looking for a spiral

or maybe we're looking for a furry

Street

this this bed sure is dirty

oh you got rabbits indoors

whatever you

know the ones blocking me from chopping

into the water

there's a waste

but but also so he made a can you even

fit in this one that's a jack Yeti he

looks kind of big

the main teams have a water then he was

chased out of his own home

and now he just

didn't go home at this point

anyway I got the arm up arrows I needed

I can destroy this passion waste errors

I just tried to find you

ngt YouTubers oh yeah

I do want my

weigh myself

and then please to speak today

I was speaking perfectly fine like

oh

just excuse me can you stop doing that

oh there are three keys I didn't have to

buy the key

so yeah I

want my phone fun

and to animate

don't talk here here's one of these

okay this is shooting normally

assistance

oh I got a lot of those fights fires

so we've done this for your hair so I

should be able to spend them on

wait why don't you want to eat spikes

there's a butterfly here

you want to eat this one instead no

don't be interested in butterflies

he doesn't eat cave butterflies

it's not my rice oh nice safety

but anyway yes where was I yeah I said

that anime

nice oh

save it again

but um

the common software which is

oh you can't jump every day

tube or something

it requires way too much performance on

my computer to run

hey

I can't play like I know we ignited

Trinity

not as best graphical settings

oh yeah I need to shoot it

forget about that

[Music]

but in that one

one my computer not probably running

that program ideally because obviously

it doesn't require more performance than

the spiral it still makes the game lag

and stuck here a lot

oh

and while claims it is light when it

which is certainly I mean

it it must be considered to be

lightweight

considering it being made in unity

it is certainly not a lightweight

program

because it is made in unity

foreign

where can

another key

where can one egg

however I do have the idea if possible

I want to set set up

uh shot in the foot and he died

very cute

right

can't die from that

foreign

foreign

page

which oh I see something here

which actually would be a

lightweight

there it is

a found

[Music]

celebration

yeah you have some

elimination scene like this one

I had to come back for that funny too

yeah

I don't know why it was so obvious

this time maybe I was too focused to be

fair I was kind of tired because I was

sick last time I went to this area

there's that but there's nothing they

are the fighting with enemies now

everything's clearing out

I do think I know where they like him

it's

I am not

completely shine

but I really

the thanks for the Boost

but can I go back

I think I went back

yeah that's why what's this game went

the wrong way

then my that's why they've never felt

weird

thank you

foreign

excuse me

shot in the arm

wait what's that one

b day

party

okay

I'll still have an idea

I took it on the way down

[Applause]

okay

let's see

it doesn't seem to be anything in here

the strong lights from your ceiling

but yeah it's like what I was saying

[Music]

something of using me the tube

probably set up an HTML page

and then put

eh but basically confounding that one

and then have the the instrument page

treat Gary when I speak

and basically a defeating my own

version of that because that would

actually be lightweight

yeah basically it cleared out all of

those and I guess that counts towards

this Counting I didn't give up on that

one I mean I can't check yes

here

yeah I already got it

so there's this big area

yeah I see something

[Music]

I think I know what it is last one is

[Music]

and standing very close today

it wasn't day

I'm doing keep it

and you keep it so I guess um

I need to

run twice

when the exits should be over here

this is a hunter segment that has two

exits

wait if I if I left spiral

at the entrance and then go to the other

side

they would obviously don't guess iron

there

and then the game tells me to now you

have to go back all the way all the way

back to where it came from

Crossfire isn't here

wait how much

more was it yeah

same place disgusting

sure that works

now

I do miss any in here too

I mean a second

[Music]

[Music]

over here

the question is where

because they're basically been

everywhere

[Music]

hmm

but don't worry the door doesn't want to

open it

[Music]

I don't think

nope

[Music]

[Music]

ah

welcome arti Blinky

and when the one of the characters

mistakenly called blink in this game

except that was funny yeah one hidden

cave you need to charge

well okay I don't want you to tell me

how to

play the game

is to be clear about that

you got this yes let me let me try to

find it first

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

oh my phone

[Music]

really that's what spiders have done

restart

is like a secret

[Music]

okay now

there is

[Music]

this area

there could be something new right

[Applause]

this just looks like that

so probably not a good idea

[Applause]

and I'm painting us

let's try that or something

[Music]

that should be straight this one I

assume

okay close let's check

[Music]

no no

it doesn't seem to be anything up there

anyway so

[Music]

yeah

I'm alive

oh

you're made of ice

he actually died he just has such a long

test animation

[Music]

and then it splits up here

and I did both of this I'm pretty sure I

did

shall I attack the enemy or is this just

a drill

I when I run the student okay

what is this area

but this area is

oh yeah this is back

I didn't have one

spam spin

isn't that magnitude

Village

I do feel like there is one place I

haven't been to one okay

like I have a big

memory of some place

oh yeah next week

[Music]

and here's the fox lady

[Music]

who actually has Android animation

okay and then

they speak open area

destroyed that

when it's in here

because like they're sensing the story

here

okay this path needs like

went into this stuff

immediately

huh

gold swing

why does the uh

perfect

you can go around like this

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

okay so this is just around 30 days okay

that didn't help me

not at all

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

but why does it look like

this is supposed to be a positive

wait

what it is

hmm

exciting

[Music]

could this be what I'm looking for

oh yeah they are stuck here I haven't

been here yet

nice got stuck

no you missed it here hit this side

thank you

it didn't even destroy it

[Music]

what you didn't even protect yourself

[Music]

um

and then

oh that's why I couldn't open this door

because this but

that still doesn't give me the last egg

it was a suspicious Brown of all

okay I thought I found the last name but

apparently not

[Music]

go ahead

this is some secret platform up here or

something

excuse me

now here we go

and this is going somewhere

wait yeah there was a thing on top of

this I already got it

okay so this is not very much

[Music]

[Music]

because I clearly don't know

what was this prosperity

[Music]

yeah

and now I'm going to circles

I really don't

but I don't see any

seeing that

[Music]

is

yeah it's

suddenly

very

hidden one

who would go around and hide on me

[Music]

hello kitten

I'll come to your third month now

can we just open this door the egg is

buying the store open

now you are a level three bunny

the highest level at the moment

sadly you have to wait 46 months to

achieve level four the uh XP you get one

XP per month and

you level up for each XP until 11 but

level three to level four is three XP

it's a it's the twitch system I can't

control it

I sell 3xp for 45 and 56.

[Music]

the 6 is

fully

level three bunny

here

and I'm currently very confused because

I can't find one inch

and I have no idea what it is

I forgot about this yeah particular

person across the cave

good

[Applause]

no no

also she is actually attacking with the

horns despite the horns being quite far

back

that is something I need to modify for

I wonder if I can get a better look at

the running animations for

like I wanted to go up there but clean

it on

as I saw that thing behind but that's

obviously the pipe that goes around

obviously not that it's

like that and then the other day and

night girl

here

and I assumed it was a thing while

basically up here

and then I already got that one so

I would say this area is cleared

[Music]

and that's this

and

I don't see any like

suspicious walls except like that

Exchange

and finally here welcome

and I'm doing badly at it

because I can't find the ink

I guess she's in attacking with the

horse that well

we're here

I want to be relieved of you if that's a

great statement

about that

that's I realized I was saying that that

could mean something else but not when

you use nowhere off I will use that as

my defense

and I really don't care about the point

of this partners because there's a

button on the other side

he can't do it to my project on

you're further than I am and in less

than that I have on my files you can

find but I'm not doing fine I'm just

going to find it

even to be honest

[Applause]

wait a minute

I think I can use this one

but not to get the egg because watch out

bunny

but to get through here this is of

course another place

not nice

all right

number one Super Saiyan question I

sleeping on my bed doesn't that sound

nice

well

there will be something in your hand to

destroy the small ones

before you can destroy the big one

yeah we're gonna change back in the game

I do need to use cancer cells

and that scene

well let's do that

[Music]

unless there's some like

other way into that I Citadel that

counts

as the eye signal practice like this

place I think I remember but this is

just part of the first five minutes when

you do miss one dark ham two eggs and

two night jams

this one over there because I I'm not

completing this island yet

[Music]

I didn't mean to have that power

well

something's just

I think they are missing two things that

can be or not

all right

well that was one egg

only one egg and

no no no

that was okay baby

wait where did I spawn

down here

where can I get a checkpoint

frozen solid

no

oh

nice cute dragon

I'm trying to play with popsicle

how am I supposed to get that costume

like that

obviously

so that's on the dark times I've got one

egg and two lichens left

are eggs like medium gems

oh yeah

I can I keep messing on him

let's paint a Target on that one

uh just games

worthless

less than worthless

power

rather started chat is

kind of cover in the chat welcome back

to fluff of hair Evelyn

welcome back well back to work by Emily

and says well back do not welcome back

hi welcome back everyone who has ads if

you've never seen anyone I got one egg

two

a chest and then I got the a bit of

gemstone that's just but then here's

like it

so

I think that's all in this area

yeah

getting back soon be hard

okay let me see

easy

it's another door

their Birds too but this one bird it's a

booby

for some reason the developers of spider

loves babies

and they appear in their

when is paragraphs do they appearing

they're like inspires three

spiral

here's Taylor I mean shirt has only two

games

wait about that still a lot of boobies

if I had the bird I am trying to

[Music]

and then there are other kinds of

boobies since virus one

didn't get anything wait a minute

however

this is another Channel

that's fine well he's a he's a friend I

don't know anyone named will so it's

fine

take them down here we need to do that

please however a door here

95 I only got 65.

crazy wait am I supposed to get up there

is

this is quite the

bite difference

can I get out from that area

I might be able to get in there from

another

way

yeah because it goes in a circle

oh yeah it's okay I see I see that's the

exit and then I need knife I like games

to get into the area

okay

yeah I wanted you to kill soon

get stuck on something

okay now let's see check it out that

area as much as I could I assume the two

remaining because that's a very big area

very specific

probably contains it to remain ones then

there's a pass down there

when is that

oh I see

is this one

well I guess it's time to do this one

my Handler and ring so

got plenty of time to defeat these Bots

and then I have to figure out when

you're remaining stuff in second

complete this game 100 I'm actually

written together a list of the games I

have completed two different degrees

you can always

go to Discord

you find my Siri I cannot believe

I will deal with you now I was hoping it

wouldn't come to this but alas

if I can make out you're just a

traitorous coward

well then prepare young dragon to be

taught a lesson or two

may you miss me okay you actually hit me

this time

okay

oh it's ice

I see

I see

I see I see eyes

I don't know what he's going to do

okay I can't do that

wait

[Music]

[Applause]

oh

my God

I don't get it

I can't charge it

yeah I don't know what's pointless

man

when I was break

okay I push it

oh yeah no he destroyed it

welcome families

doing a very weird

[Music]

ah oh wait the edge

the first few trains yeah I just have to

pick your stuff up

I think you're supposed to do something

here maybe yeah exactly

all right

come on

huh there's not nothing

Trump indication what oh sweet

oh yeah that's supposed to push it too

far

[Music]

thing one

all right

well did that really hit

all the way away

this bus has a massive

bite

yeah he does

oh my

God

[Music]

wait till the next fight let's see

oh my

my mother got some lingamber extract

they put in drinks from a Kia my sister

teased her saying you have to assemble

your drinks from kiati yeah

I guess depending on what time you get

come on

I don't get the whole

why it

the whole assembled things thank you I

mean I haven't bought a furniture from

any store that isn't

unassembled that's a three seconds

I wouldn't really be able to fit the

whole Furniture in my cars if it was

assembled already

oh

I didn't take damage from there

oh [ __ ] should we close

no I don't well I guess this works

[Applause]

now in that case

he does that and the game is cheating

it's

no invincibility frames

okay

very true the joke is

cheaper but always has to pass some of

yourself yeah but I said

have you gone have you practice

friendship from any other store and it

has been assembled

I mean I have purchased furniture from

different store and

that's never been assembled

I started I'll just take too much I

wouldn't be able to I wouldn't buy

um like it takes too much space

yeah that's

that's that's that's that's why I don't

get the joke and also the second part is

like

imagine

if stores normally sold

and like assembled friendship you

wouldn't even like she

have moving vehicles for everything

would be so expensive at the game with

all that reality yeah

Lori just to buy some furniture

is it convenient

somebody starts here and dropped him off

with a delivery truck or has serviced

assembly I mean so does IKEA so I mean

he played the boss they can they can

deliver it unassembled they can deliver

it and assemble between

or they can you can deliver it yourself

and they come and assemble it

thank you

they got the options

but yeah I guess they probably are

it's the ones that have them

tonight

and then

I I really can't

[Music]

yeah I was gonna say this must

contestant's face

[Music]

yeah I was

ah

shrinking platform

s

this is dirt

oh no touching dirt

um

I want to fire a certain year if you

aren't using they have to move out of

town that you rent them you sell them a

problem include insurance

I guess Eventing

it's just that in the insurance part

costs a lot

I've tried when I

was at

deodorant

a large vehicle

I was supposed to avoid that

boy

oh

we're getting my bed

come on

but it doesn't get hurt from the upper

one

no stop to you guys

the most annoying attack

this is so much hey

reactions

[Music]

[Music]

normally they stopped doing the attack

after they hit me with it

yeah it's kind of kind of hard to avoid

them when it's stuck inside you know

should I pay the attention maybe

but

it's really gonna try to make this fight

fine

oh

yeah

this year wasn't that bad when I trained

to them when we tracked my brother and

he's

the girlfriend but

the U.S

yeah he's not making it easy

with a cheating bus

then remember he's starting from over

there

I guess that's how you avoid it but

oh

[Music]

really now

and and then he does that

[Music]

all right

[Music]

I'm so hard to push

and I'm gonna lose out of the way

[Music]

this time is magma that's different

this is going to take a while I feel

like

foreign

happened

[Music]

you basically have to have instant

reaction

to know if you should jump you know I

guess you could check where those things

are located

[Music]

yeah okay this is Jesus

thank you

it's interesting when they prevent you

from jumping off when they don't

come on

I don't think that this might help

[Music]

over here

wait no checkpoint

oh over here

anyway

oh there you are my favorite one

but I can

try my best

voice entrance again the project

I never used explosion and we've hated

okay so I have one idea

but this idea

[Music]

requires and no mistakes

and burn the bunnies why

I don't need to find the bunnies

oh It's tricky to cuts it all the way

from there

for the last

am I supposed to be scared of you I've

spoken to the elders and from what I can

make out you're just a traitorous coward

burning bunnies yeah that's not that's

not okay to be taught a lesson

and let's burn a single fun in this game

problem is

that I basically have to survive

[Music]

oh

Wow Wow Wow way too quick

not okay

it's almost like this bus is evil

not sure why he does this anyway

[Music]

we have a nice calculation is

your age

yeah he doesn't fight that well

come on

[Music]

come on this is a tea thing

and there you go that that was it

so

here tonight I'm gonna failed

I forgot to answer there is no Instagram

option

before the third place

[Music]

oh

okay

[Music]

Jerry

its power

and then basically everything almost

perfectly except that last part and then

I lost it

otherwise I would have it here

and in this phase I could just do

insta-kill and keep it

but

no

I couldn't have it

that way

that's in insecure and getting back to

full health and keeping the joy

nice

the car of course you can't she can't

have it like that

I wouldn't mind this damage challenge if

it was a bit more fair

and also if you had some invisibility

friends

don't

attack my everything

[Music]

wow I did it

magic damage four times still

that's not going to work

no I

mainly this thing

I forgot about his face

yeah he really shouldn't be able to take

damage so quickly

which really makes the challenge much

harder than should be

I'm not sure why they decide that you

shouldn't be adding this American

friends

come on

[Music]

this bus doesn't act like every on the

person again

mixing up the bosses

well that's one out of three so far

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

ah like it really looks like I'm jumping

straight through the upper laser

sometimes and sometimes it just doesn't

work and then I forgot about this

Facebook doesn't get

annoyed by the previous face

he wanted to be so badly

well the middle face

wasn't so bad it is the middle face that

ruins this whole Bell

I can deal with the first phase and the

last phase

those are fine

then then those lasers come and ruin

everything

there have some invisibility frames but

it is not much

foreign

[Music]

but I can only take one more damage

there was something to take 21 damage by

the lenses

that's

this one

which is very easy

and then phase two

yep there you go that was the first

damage

and that was the second balance big

damage but everyone even

not sure I was supposed to

I even reacted to that one yeah like

but now

I think spy made him angry yeah you

think and now he's taking it out of the

memory

I didn't like the country clockwise

laces I don't like any places doesn't it

doesn't matter

you need Pizza Perfect jumpsticks Right

does it seem to be Pixel Perfect because

I do make those jumps most of the times

it's just too easy to make a mistake and

hit the upper laser

and I don't know what the difference I

did like most of the time I make jumps

that works so most of the time is fine

but it just sometimes just fails

if that's brutal I feel the pain of this

yeah yeah and if we continue

the pain will continue

I'll try anyway oh okay

really that doesn't work but this works

okay so this is this

you know what I'll try desolation maybe

this is what you're supposed to do

all right this face

okay

[Music]

even though it's pretty easy why are you

so many broadcasters

is the game on it not seen that I think

maybe take a bit too much damage

oh

actually at least the game you like

45 minutes of struggling

fight considered me maybe you should

have another

butterfly

and then

but anyway

I'll try that but it comes to nice and

then

you guys think you're supposed to do

I even have the laces set up in such a

way that you can't jump over them

or maybe you are supposed to jump over

them and that's not what you're supposed

to do similarly maybe you're supposed to

avoid these piece of packing a

completely different way but yeah I'm

avoiding this attack as if shooting

three they have them every time

uh well it's system one so far so

a life hack and this is this is how you

hack the bus

wait let me try this one

wow

I guess that only worked for

a certain amount

[Music]

my license oh my icing Sparks picking up

the butterfly

[Music]

here we go finally

[Music]

oh he's stronger than

us did you cast your own damage in nine

times

wow looks like your power wasn't so

infinite after all

[Music]

a white guy

or some clipping in the dress

and stop them tracks it can also be used

you can post this scene

my family yes I saw a fantasy she's

wearing very light blue or

white panties

yeah sometimes the shoe love to I mean

the dresses are too short so you can

I I don't think he I mean if it is

panties maybe it's his shorts maybe

these boys shirts there's like a pump on

this way in that case it is panties

she has to move in the Stream

Okay so

I spreads can be used to freeze most

enemies and then okay I wonder you know

what that felt then

I mean the tradition is how long can you

hold on to that thing

well but it's wait what is this

why can't I go back

or is it just because I need extra high

I need a safe place to

yeah it's just to get the extra height

is this the only place where you

I can't say on the face is this the

first place that you are required to

turn around on a pole swing or was that

something you did in the first person

maybe

maybe you did that when you're learning

from spinning

actually

but after that I don't think

if there's a single place where you turn

around

press the down Direction the buttons

like I expect to put the left version

button to go back to status flame breath

but but the only thing Brett if you Zone

there's no other breaths

where am I

what

looks very blue

there we go so

um

of course still contacts is that area

but now I can go to the next area

do the same game it's all the same spot

I can't guess the important

let's let's save the game anyway

more swing sticks

Empire it's interesting

luckily she didn't

a volcanic aisle and here I will read

another fairy

do you like Ferry

do you like lady fairies

[Music]

Spyro I've got an idea where red might

be I believe he has a secret underground

Blair somewhere on this realm what kind

of storm Beach

what kind are you asking about yes sorry

I missed what I said

[Music]

meanwhile see if you can find a way into

the volcano oh is Professor actually

going to do something on science day I

mean he could ask blink but I guess he

doesn't know blink exists so

to be fair

should be able to use ice breath

underwater and freeze the whole place

what

yeah you mean what kind of fairy

I should realize what I said it would be

it would be a hyena

and she's also wearing a dress

but it is a bit towards but I should be

able to reach him before I mean I want

to be streaming for

but soon two hours

started 16

normally due to like

1930s basically average

okay

oops

eil uh

what today I learned about free adult

Smith oh what what did he learn

can he can you explain to me what it is

oh my I got some

oh my your text

I've studied for a food delivery firm

last year I suggested 98 of sweets enjoy

blacksmith at least once a month

well that's not true I don't think

that's too way height of a number and

the majority would choose a cozy Friday

which would be the translation yes above

any other activity including a geek a

cinema night exercise and insects that

would be yeah because like

I don't know if that's that thing

because probably is there

from church

thank you

sorry

but I can't charge this one I guess if

that doesn't exist too far

so yeah

in English speaking countries the same

that would be called the

it's like Saturday candy oh the useless

waste of money

I only got set to this house

and some who wants to expand the

sanity camp or Saturday sweets

when I say candy sounds like

what kind of mixing a bit of both

yeah I want to say Saturday sweets

because it's like a mediteration but

then I said candy

Saturday sweets that sounds fun too yeah

it's like uh every week you have your

sweet on Saturday

yeah

yeah

certainly the close to Friday

it's either thing it just feels like the

numbers although it did say once a month

that's kinda

not too often shouldn't be

eyes up here

yeah I mean like keys

get this Chinese

[Music]

that would be the term

the sun expanded if they want even more

candy

can I

what can I use

what

they do have a very slow turn around

foreign

[Music]

sweets and candies

yes I hear your money bags I am on my

way

oh yeah I need to go into

ah there you are

my favorite wallet and then I need this

one which I didn't get to use because I

messed up

thank you

am I ever going to go below 30 000

[Music]

that's very cute sadly sweets really

really love it oh do you find anything

interesting

because I like it

the whole the whole thing is actually

true with

yeah that's means because that was

actually

and everything

when I was growing up

that kind of

falling off the beach

and I have a

close today whenever I feel like it

it doesn't have to be afraid

but

oh yeah I see something up here

now the school is started in Sweden did

you but yeah where else would a Swedish

time start yeah I mean in Finland again

give me

all right thank you why was he so high

up

it's a live stream in the sense of

signing not being no mess

and I said this is over let me

in the afternoon but welcome Rocket Man

welcome welcome

[Music]

back to this message starting Sweden

during the late 1950s as a government

product to bring children from getting

cavities

kind of makes sense

I mean it kind of sounds like the

opposite at first uh that I would

I have with having a

um

How would

I I just didn't figure out how I will

phrase this sentence

how would having

a weekly

as

sweet eating celebration there you go

that's a nice term

yeah

we help prevent cavities well that would

be to introduce it from this basically

to avoid eating it for any other day

how are you getting on

and

are you asking her clothes

well

can I cleared out that area so now I'm

all right now I will go up there and

meet a furry lady

sadly no furry gems

and that's a reference

The Legend of Spyro which did not have

her gems either but Fury yeah I'm just

not good at speaking

hmm

I guess cause this was supposed to be

locked away and they're suddenly exactly

basically what I tried to say but I said

it very

I can't imagine from water in a very

poor way

but yeah that's and then there was the

horn

yeah

and then there was the idea of

some people still have Friday sweets

starting my name

Ahoy Ahoy

you're starting pretty close

okay I mean in that case help defend the

realm hold round

why are you standing so close Amber

this doesn't look like a hyena no it

doesn't look like a lady or a furry

either sounded but it's certainly not

the one I'm talking about

[Music]

they look so weird because

the perspective feels off

oh no

problem me

uh

yeah I'm laughing sounds too but

I'm getting more than majority

didn't say how many uh he said how many

I had stopped

he didn't say how many

all right good luck soon

we have an invading force of a hundred

stop 60 of them and see you again

a 40 of them attackers that's fine I

mean technically yes

there we go the rest can walk by

and yeah and stop shooting at that point

in the remaining 20 can just walk like

really

have done better myself however it seems

there are snow yeah

it's successful again I

I've also learned the Swedish time for

gamma bears from this article willia

Beyond

oh yeah I guess I guess if I used to

text him

yeah I would guess

that would be just gummy

sweets

heavy gem

but as as I said a light TM doesn't

stand for low mass except for that it is

bright

shiny and apparently warm

which makes sense if it's like full of

energy

and then and opposite is dark chips

which I guess I can't

pull setting feel nice

and very attractive

to paint directions

so this is the type of mini game and I'm

doing the worst thing but

amazingly one

I got it

I was almost about to leave so I still

not lost a single Cannon Mission I think

wait

what's the goal to fire the treating

narcs

lots of work wait are they retreating

yeah I didn't really pay the attention

to what he said but if they were

retreating why are they running towards

the cannon shooting at them

I mean they are pretty stupid to be

honest

because

they were like they were a large group

waving their weapons by the way

so it wasn't like they came peacefully

in streets

and Spike always foreign

I guess you could play video games

video games and sweets on a Friday

yeah they really should change it to

from from Saturday to Friday

and there's a rocket

there's a Rocket Man

that sure was a Rocket Man

doesn't really work when I don't say man

normally but

[Music]

oh well

another needs

exams but

yeah parties have worked crime to you

we made that decision

seems like some anti-dragon propaganda

why are this Moon

foreign

[Music]

waste

what an awful reward for all that

wasn't much work but still

you found a secret area

here is

dark colored hems

let's go in here

I think

okay is there is a

lady here

we probably get some yeah I put out the

lock picks again

let's get back and get some before I

continue

using a dragon for combat is a war

travel understandable

a is it is that like

established

feel free to browse because because some

countries

do you have we have the definitions

where they do consider certain

things that other countries would

consider imaginary

and one immediate thing that one thing

that comes immediately to my mind

uh would be the whole house some

countries have insurance companies that

basically don't cover you if they

consider it being being an act of God

which that wouldn't be the case for

insurance companies in other countries

because they will consider that

well to be imaginary if that's my way to

say it people who don't

share the same belief

to do

the most problems faces

my point came across and I would imagine

there are

countries defining things

academic scene but it doesn't seem like

I can't do much

one thing I think is done being

permanently disabled from my weapon

intended to kill perfectly acceptable

being permanently disabled due to a

weapon designed to only cause permanent

disability work right

I mean

arguably the

is a difference there is it easy I would

argue making someone else who doesn't

use the weapon to be disabled

although you could argue that killing

someone's voice yeah I guess so

but at the same time torture is not okay

but if you doing it to yourself that's a

different thing

and I don't think it's a work it's sure

you could argue then that it's it's a

mistreatment of your soldiers

and I I don't think I would fall under

War crime level from Silent sentence

that's getting into technicalities but I

guess that's what you were bringing up

in the first place so

I don't think mythological creatures are

in there

you don't think so

oh

excuse me

shot inside

it's casually standing there

yeah I'm sure the idea of it that I

would prefer losing your leg but going

home to his family have enough

but what do I in there yeah I mean I

think the two seem to compare there

aren't relevant to your point your point

was more that

all right

oh wait I see what sorry I now I see

what you mean

being permanent disabled for my weapons

designed

the only cause parent disability is

working

okay now I see yeah I didn't get it yes

but it's just said first

and okay

yeah now I see what you mean and I now

realize

that

I mean

yeah I guess that's like

the whole

um

consequence of having not torturing is

not allowed but

healing is which to be fair should still

be

which which is weird

at least at least you aren't allowed to

kill people who are

part of the game

there's a there's a Swedish phrase for

that which is basically

the Swedish face exactly is exactly

wow

foreign

basically if you pick part of the game

you have to

well accept the game

the if you take part of your in a war

you have to accept that being killed is

part of the war but if you don't take

part of the war it is not looking before

yeah

foreign

[Music]

yeah I mean a lot of countries have

decided that they shouldn't be doing

wars uh

and haven't some countries moved oh what

is that kind of part of the Olympic

Games is something similar for Wars to

do Sports instead

I don't know

no

it changed Direction

I messed up

I prefer Mario Kart matches but that's

my Jessica I was more Awards I don't get

this whole

people getting upset of Mario Kart

I've been married cartoon never getting

up since so I complained once about

dipping and glare in my quarter of the

screen but I think that was unfair

and declare only showed up on the screen

during dark

surprise so

so I had a hard time seeing this track

compared to everyone else

but it's not like I got I got angry

some sense or more like one person said

I was only making excuses but yeah I

made excuses for why I was paying family

because it was fair excuses I don't I

don't know if that's how you need to

tell me skip this but I said that it was

the first kiss

my party will make

okay yeah that's awesome I love to play

Mario party but

well I guess I was a bit annoyed once

while someone intentionally tried to

room for me even though I was in that

space but aside from that I don't think

like I've not been angry or something

we're upset like

like that

you know it show it yeah yeah I'm more

like annoyed at that very short scene

that's basically

am I pretty mad

nuclear satisfaction

my part is nothing but randomly

generated range that's why I prefer

playing Mario Party 8 in the

in the the single map

when you spend money to here's the area

by the way

what was that

oh I see what kind of day is put it here

oh I want because it's one of needs that

I can't destroy Department

anyway

so

what is this

oh

that's why I didn't want me to put it

there because

but it was short

and that Mario Party 8 is stage map is

where you spend money invest money to

Banks and the person who has invested

most

is the one who owns the bank and get 100

of it and when the total amount of

investment money regardless of who has

invested it reaches certain amounts it

upgrades to two and three stars

there's a more much more strategic

because

[Music]

uh

okay

and that way

if you can't complain about random

placement of the star

yeah that someone got a lucky number to

get to the staff but I mean I guess

this

I mean a lot of the randomness is

reduced

let's see let's use the word reduced

come on I should be able to jump back

I could do that in previous bio games

that's super saiyan Empire again how

how have those fireworks those hardly

exploded in the heat of the back and

they are the

um

on the flame

I don't know how it actually works in

real life

I would just it wouldn't be surprised if

they would treat anybody but

okay apparently the hyena is further

along

but there it is

what are you laughing about

monsters burned down my house

[Laughter]

I think she's insane

okay

all right

I got marked in that message oh I see I

did

well it wasn't me

yeah yeah it was

the uh three-way for some reason

all right three way should be accepting

so it's fine

well

yeah these houses are destroyed there's

nothing to eat and how wait how am I

supposed to destroy this

thank you to destroying

they look like the ice monsters

okay it died I got the gems and then it

fell down

that seems reasonable

okay I have the black black fly jar

butterfly jar yeah yeah if you need it

here

[Music]

huh

don't kick me

anymore

she's a bit crazy but I guess that makes

sense when they hold when your whole

village is destroyed and you're the only

Survivor

and don't have anything to eat

not that I'm not familiar with nothing

to eat I mean

[Music]

yeah

there you go perfect

I should

probably goes back to that hyena before

she needs a directly

constantly think she said she enough

I don't know what these things

why is so many

come on Dragon Age

[Music]

okay

I mean I assume the winter season

oh no

oh no nothing new I don't want to do

another flight level

sorry chat I need to go

and talk to hyena

she's more important because she's in

Desperate needs

anyways

inside a volcano anyway

well

as you know hyenas live in places where

it's dry

desolate is that correct word where no

other animals live and

along um lots of rocks and uh

I didn't know what she lives here maybe

maybe it was a good place and then the

volcano showed up

Maybe

I've actually got the team

Now where's the stored egg because she

got no house

[Laughter]

well good luck

I hope you can do something about your

depression

life is hard sometimes

I know it's a sergeant bed yeah it is so

different indeed I guess I have to do

that

I guess that's the

the conclusion of

this stream as well not the away from me

platform

I hope we get the audio depression and

after hopefully you can find I don't

know your other hygienists hygienas

hygienas and or other animals and build

up a new Village working together

still I can blast off to see what I can

find

yep

quick Xbox do you want to try from

Dragon Age

I haven't considered the way it phrases

but I don't think they should go I don't

think they should try for a Dragon Age

actually to be honest

[Music]

no

okay and let's actually do this

shall I demonstrate our air superiority

foreign

facing aside let's do this

I don't know

wait how is the controls

okay so far it's fine

[Music]

okay it's nice oh no I missed the birds

all right

[Music]

certainly seen the bird

okay there's one more birds

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

this seems like a rather small

place to go around probably because of

how open it is

so

now I just need two minutes to find the

glass burn oh there it is

[Music]

I'm really two loops that's quick

pressing make SpongeBob dive headphones

into Lara as a payback put it I feel all

the pain he's caused

oh that's amazing you only won the

Dragonite you want to try for like him I

don't think that's

I don't think that's how biology work

gosh but we can always try

oh that's a short time limit

but let's let's go

I'm shooting everything

okay now it says

a random disconnect

because why not

I'm back okay

all right okay it's last one and then

there's just a ring left

it's so blurry

uh yeah thank you

don't really see what it means oh there

it is

Orange

all right I'll do well viewers are back

thank you

I've got a tough one I must say

[Music]

that was tough

and you can't remember please

do you want to play a game for fun that

was and and I mean like

that wasn't actually terrible if if the

other ones were like that

I wouldn't like you might need

mostly because I definitely nothing I

think I think it's because this that one

was the smallest one of all of them

and

if everyone was that small it wouldn't

be such a pain

hello hello

I haven't said it because I find it

funny I hope you don't mind

yeah that said bread level it was

actually enjoyable aha

build available enjoyable part

I still I still think they are terrible

but

then

I do enjoy this fire plan levels if I

just could use spiral or you know

it was actually enjoyable

I guess I guess they had like oh

people don't find this Firefly level

enjoyable we'll have a certain parents

then because that's certainly going to

make it a questionable

thank you

and then

bye light Jim nice nice

don't worry about my double jump

yay cheers to try and how to make a

reality medieval Soldier funny

you just playing

grilled Soldier

how to cook Your Dragon

yeah that was part of

I have to change a dragon

oh

as far as I remember it was they had the

whole thing about after cooking

preparing dragons as well

Dragon Hunters or something

I mean like

they were kind of force to be triggers

like this because all right

I don't know

I messed up again yeah I mean I have

watched that film or how many are

are you interested

just like like

basic got basis something on me

[Music]

I like the introduction

so

now it's spoilers

[Music]

are kids

it's an old film it's DreamWorks I think

and

minutes

enjoying more this is weird things about

it

I will see I've seen the first one

I've seen

first the first one the second one

I don't know if I won more than that why

does the eye

why does the eyes look so much like

walking electricity that's good when

fire is good one water that's good one

eyes that doesn't look like ice

that looks like watching

just different different water

I mean someone would argue that ice is

just water it was

Frozen and that is correct but um

arguably they could make their icons

more clear

now now now what happened

the ice is frozen but there you go now

you said it

and

when did this game come out 2004

game

I should probably put the title in the

year in the traditional

I mean I put the console I'm playing on

many titles I could just this one put in

here

that's not that bad idea actually

I do

think yeah twitch should do that

with their titles as well for the

categories that way I don't need to

defeat

that's the way I can have my funny Titan

right there as it says remember a

hairstyle instead of spiral yesterday

obviously the game isn't called the

emperor here's name

[Music]

if this game was released in 2004

oh

that was me maybe I should use this it's

actually pretty powerful

yeah

I didn't die

for once okay

[Music]

17 do you know what that means it is

that means I have enough for this secret

area

I mean that's one place

foreign

things

what

okay it died I oh no these are a person

there we go

just to put put constant pressure oh a

secret

in the cloud level now in the uh

actually first area

for some reason I decided that the

controls should be inverted for the

storm it just disappears there's no

animation

[Music]

oh this one this is fine

quite the only one wait why do the game

comes to come to me

foreign

that's behind it

that's in front of me how am I supposed

to take that one out

I mean I don't need to eat on their own

contain gems

and I don't need Collective gems

but I would love if they made a remake

of this game

maybe I was gonna say how am I supposed

to get up to me but they they changed it

from

an infinite amount of camps to a

specific amount of gems

of course they would need to

rework on the bags in that case

but I'm afraid

foreign

could be interesting

and of course I want to give you yes the

first time

strange things

okay all right hydrate

yeah and this show is uh warm things

good thing I'm wearing a dress

can't because it's

nice and cool

yeah it's not like 15 Champs 15

different gems

um

[Music]

together

yeah exactly I can get here I don't know

why

I would try and get something

did we make

I can't feel like selling your keys that

you have to use to unlock

he's just with

and then you have forced you're still

paying for

peace

and

I said

being able to jump in lava lunch

it's not with me nice

um but at least I got there gems I don't

need to get back there

good thing I have probably the deaths in

this game that's better

foreign

this one

well done you get to be like that

whatever

so

I checkpoint nice

okay where am I

okay so this is a bonus area

with a dark gem when music disappears I

do like that game like yeah keep

everything like this just five times

does this change anything like on the

map

now

it must understand the map

the map is fine

I do wish each area was more of a

separate level though what do you like

to think about how it would change the

game

I never

right

okay how to get over

like this I think

what does this thing

oh

let him go let me guess it's going to

show me this each time

my invisibility

no I need one more

yeah somewhere

I mean

surprise me

okay

let's do this then

nope nope I noticed the timer right now

and I went the wrong way

got distracted by the gems

I think it's working what worked

Pearl standberg she fell into the love

tonight I just

Oh you mean here invisibility

yeah I guess that's ghost Amber

he's tried by shiny shiny gems all right

can you blame it

and that's an end response is based on

the camera positioned every time the

camera goes over there doesn't responds

yeah this is why I don't like having the

charge and headbutt being the same

button that's also I think they should

change for the

the the remix I decided that you should

make I mean you've done if they're not

going to make a new spider game at least

we make this game into a traditional Spy

game that's that's the compromise

probably means there is no third game

and it's just

enter the dragonfly and I hear a thing

and that's it

I do like that jump that must be

connect

that is going to take a few attempts

like what if you because I'm pretty sure

you need that invisibility we get back I

mean why else would invisibility then or

something I don't know and whatever you

obviously want to get here with too few

like gems

but what if you would

but if you ever tried the sequence break

the game and get here

let's sing

again no jump it was no jump

and because that's the thing I've done

in the spiral the United Trilogy I have

defeated the uh

RC bosses in the second spiral without

collecting a single Talisman which is

what you have to collect to put against

the game you get the Testament for every

level you complete of the two first

words

and that's how you

yeah to be the third one

but with some

a modding in

have to enable free flight

and if I do success with the flight yeah

it's a purpose that happens

she's just just foreign

foreign

no more distractions

all right if it isn't to be that funny

this is take this the other one

thank you

they really don't like half bar out in

our second

to reach them

normally

wait the time it runs while in cutscene

how's that thing it may make sense I

guess

thank you

this time

until

one day

finally I'm up

I almost missed that day

and there you go

I did it I did it

I guess this is cleared out now wait

this is

I forgot about the gym area there might

be something that I haven't changed

I need to get back up there

but again

nicely seeming and nothing

because there are stuff up there

and I should be able to fly there

okay whatever

if you don't want that game

if you don't want that

there is nothing up there

by missing something is up there but it

doesn't get there his own gems I've

decided it's only gems

breakfast

like not thinking diamonds or if I could

just come back I have only died by

inspection so far

okay

insta-kill does not get rid of your

butterfly Joy

well

I guess that's the thing that they

wouldn't be able to implement the

butterfly jar but I don't think

developerator does make the game easier

okay I mean it's an option when they use

it

I guess it's a challenge to do the game

without

and that should be easy

[Music]

I mean it is shocked around and she was

sick okay

this is a weird place

what

what

was the end of that

oh hey yeah

oh James

worthless

what am I doing

remember falls into lava Sparks excuse

me somehow yep

like I said

really nothing else yeah of course

there's something you know

there's some eggs safe

yeah collected all that dragon eggs from

set three you cannot play as Amber from

oh I can place Amber now

I went

awesome set three because it's kind of

like sets the Amber set or something

here's something

funny

you guys can

is therefore

the end of the segment

I do like like these enemies drops the

gem immediately without taking them an

enemy like this

I have to wait until the enemy dies

before

I guess

attempts

means

ah there it is

perfect

but I'm pretty sure it's not

writing it

because I got everything here three five

six yes

he does it

aim for me

so this should be a new area

but what would you look at it

it says 1901 at the moment

hey you know what that means

I will save on stream if you know if you

really insist on me doing that

it's a mine shaft

theft
