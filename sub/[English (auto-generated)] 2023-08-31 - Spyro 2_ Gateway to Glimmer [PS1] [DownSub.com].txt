[Music]

at the same time

now we are over five thousand now he can

use the princess him but

a happy princess

let's um how long do you think it will

take me for getting to yeah should we

start the prediction which I said I

don't do

I want this against

his name is let's do the usual numbers

[Music]

usual timers 30 minutes that should be

good amount of time

I have fun with it with that

it's okay you know I had a princess pump

on your own now you too can you if you

can call

orbs you 'll be able to get the power

Crystal back from rip

[Music]

Dragon Shores

she has a weird voice

thank you everyone for being here

and so now I'm going to my girl is to

finish this game a hundred percent

oh my goodness stuck

so I guess you can judge my

fire skills

um well I would be defeating crypto

let's start with Miss Mystic Marsh I'll

get this one first

I miss the gym

my girl was down like this

don't want to unlock your favorite

teammate he gave student 10 extra

they look so weird

in this

[Music]

foreign

just aren't the same since our Magic

Fountain shut off yeah I haven't

listened too much to them it's okay to

not spend too much time to listen to

every npcc

look at this

detect

hmm

hello spark assistant

that was weird too

you can't eat a frog

what

I just

no no it didn't touch me what's this

oh yeah holidays

rescue cats in a place that's totally

what it says

but um you you uh do you believe that

I'll do it in a single attempt

I appreciate you

you're trusting me

or favorites

[Music]

when I see someone

[Music]

come down from there

I'm listening

[Music]

well

and then he's

nail defensive murdering everything

especially me

oh well I guess I guess the Sparks is

gone again

another Spike and swimming scheme

so what's with this

is like some kind of purple goo

how is this that different from regular

water

shark water

the Spire can kill sharks

unless you mean it's nice

metal sharks

[Music]

measure 20 and it's

not anymore

[Music]

it feels like I'm hitting them I'm

missing a big shark water I mean the

water is Big that's for sure

that's pretty big even got a

it's actually moving but I'm pretty sure

this moves more like a character than

it's not a goofball it's a good curtain

jump

[Music]

a good curtain

[Music]

SpongeBob is here

ah Spyro so glad you're here I'm

perfectly useless without my trusty

pencil and I seem to have lost it I do

have this extra egg perhaps you can

trade it for my pencil

yes

of course

the only thing he needs is that his

pencil and I lost it

foreign

[Music]

the beaker is that squash

but if you were closer now you can see

spikiness of them

just look at them

oh excuse me

is that still not one thing

[Music]

they're kind of cute

hey

but only kinda

Papa does puffer platypus

yes that's a puffered platypus that's

what they are

octopus

[Music]

[ __ ] scene anyway that's

um

20 enemies now I can use this spring

thing

and here you

the ink goes into the burst nest

the bird's bird comes and drop off a

DD thing

and he ate it

oh it's alive I think that totally

heaters a bit low on life it's not like

fresh

I guess the difference in Crash is that

you do get like an extra knife every 100

fruits if you if you were to get an

extra 100 gem here

when

I guess that would be 39 extra nice so I

guess it's gonna be but I paid money

bags a few times the technique have more

but it doesn't say how much I have

this game doesn't say

I think your ignited says how much I do

have collected away I can count this but

anyway

but now without carrying the seed

there we go here's a duck plastic and

rubbery duck

plastic rubber or rubber plastic

object points

that's flame it with a duck in my mouth

and certainly certainly didn't take

damage from being

I'm attacking certainly it's his face

doesn't miss me

I guess most people wouldn't take damage

without having their Ducks classic ducks

on his face

welcome plastic rubber ducks that comes

out of a plastic from a scene yes it's

the Rubber Duck seed

you have heard about the rubber tree

this is the rubber duck plant

[Music]

it's perfect it's logical

come on anyway

let's see if I can throw the duck into

the pond from up here

okay

um okay

sure

whoa where did that go

oh it landed in water okay

thank you

but I did not expect that to happen

fleeing into space

[Music]

and people say reading it is buggy what

about this game

your accent is fun okay can you guess

where I'm from based on my accent

I mean I don't know

I mean you probably already know but

so wait what did I pick up

oh

sing

now

just bite here

I think I made that exactly

oh it says zero Clips nose I'm not sure

if you did

but yeah it should be a clip

done

okay oh

maybe it doesn't update it yet what kind

of thing is kind of battered up baby

nope since it's here Clips so

walk forward here you go here we have

whatever his name is

a spiral a friendly face a bunch of

rotten teeth stolen the spark plugs and

I'm stuck here please get the four plugs

back

he's apparently wearing a skirt I'm not

going to judge you satire but

he's wearing skirts

which is perfectly fine anyone should be

allowed to wear skirts just I wouldn't

expect that to be the case just

wanted that

there

then let's chase this kangaroo looking

thing

oh they are kids

okay I guess uh don't change it then

[Music]

okay let's talk to you as well

Gully looks like I let the fountain

switch off golly

[Music]

completely different place

wasn't it kind of got some ears are

pretty glitchy

[Music]

like that layered in properly

seems like a good idea is not to make

the model in such a way that

it glitches ah where am I to church

oh yes spaghetti to the princess

okay was it this pot that gives the pan

yes I got it

now it's it's a coin right

hey can I get that thing

I don't know what it is but they got the

wings

nope

reacted way to her knee

okay this thing about these coins here

but let's say this one is missing

[Music]

that's a thick pen that's the missing

[Music]

that's one stick ten

all right I don't need the coin

now it can't be healthy

think of all the people has touched it

there you go I didn't even press the

button my pencil I've seen I Can Begin

calculating the age of the universe

again but soon I mean it's paper scene

it's like it's like flat

it actually has something instead

20 49 warps

and he's so happy he's there's a little

dance okay let's catch those

kangaroo looking things

[Music]

yay

yeah Terry have one

I actually chat what am I supposed to

come on let's say I didn't watch

there we go

come here you stupid thing

no they're definitely

have it guys

well I guess I'll just have to chase it

I just need to make sure and get

everything I'm on the way

otherwise I'll be distracted by them

[Music]

[Music]

come here

from here you stupid thing

come on it's so quick

[Music]

fall into the purple goo because that

one is weird

oh

it made a little cry

with a squeak

ah

lift everything but wigglypuff

wait a minute you're missing the lifting

it can't be us

two car glider can it cannot be give you

this or is that kind of

I mean it's probably small one so

kind of

featuring

pineapple pizza yay

not two points well

you ran right in front let me see

bouncing

come on no see I'm done with my Flame

oh I got it

okay there we go finally

so the next one

could be somewhere here there after yes

this one was the one I just couldn't get

you've seen yeah no flames

that was a good girl to see wow

Flames only but

that will make it very hard to game to

play

you you can't jump you can't charge you

can you can't walk only flames

I was pressing the flame button oh no I

want to come back

but apparently

[Music]

more squeaky yeah

all right

when it's quick in the desk

oh that was completely wrong

no jumping I think don't make the game

impossible to beat

yeah no charging it could be something

though

yeah but I'm still interested in doing

crash 3 without power-ups

come on

come on

come on

what am I no

ah this one is tricky

I'm cute thank you

I can't make a spooky sound I'm not I'm

not a squeaky person

that's my squeaky sound I should never

do that again

[Music]

come on

I bet you'll be able to beat Christy

without using powerapps

it's the way and there it is yes

it's been a while Cherry default hello

Cherry I remember sharing Beauty Channel

remember

the cherry on top

it has been a while

and I guess not much have changed here

see I can't get this with flaming no

charge thank you

but that's all the sea I won't be able

to get without charge

[Music]

it won't come

unless you ask me to be on top wings

I mean if you want to be on top

I'm not here to judge

as I'm judging him

61 jumps why they must be in this one

in here what is this tree growing from

anyway it's just on top of water makes

no sense

foreign

[Music]

yeah I haven't been down here

that's fine

these

prefer horses

there's a few gems that doesn't that's

not enough

playing that's enough I'm still missing

29

plus missing

yeah

yeah let's make a drawing of a

pon pon being lying down flat on the

ground

and we share the pop fitting on top

and that's the cherry on top

on the drawing

my name is obvious gems

I couldn't do that

I'm gonna do that

but I'm sorry again

what's hiding here

I've never used this scene oh it's

nothing in here

it's here but

I've already been up here so

I look

I can stand on top of this thing

but that helps me but

I can do it

there's some kind of

foreign

into space

this island is also like

bloating

that's not how islands work

I'm sure

I'm now

geologists

space tacky cry

[Music]

when I'm happy the duck came down to

ground and didn't die

man I'm not getting anything from

murdering enemies

in a sense

creatures rather than enemies because

they're just living here

right

I'm not being here here we go

[Music]

I killed it as it was supposed to shrink

to it

again but now I'm missing

four so two green

two

small green ones they are gonna be there

I'm not sure how you got the car up here

it's very close to the HTT

P be careful when you are driving though

especially when you're going to drive

down from here where are you going

anyway

jump down here

I'm gonna hard bump

the thing is

yeah no

no you're stuck up here and like you got

this platform and then you got this

platform but anyway you go from here

you're just going to break your car if

you even manage it get it down from this

platform

I don't have a majestic creature perfect

platypus because the only way I can

think I have to shorten it sounds a bit

not what a puffer puff puff puff puff

ers

that's fine

party fish platter Puff

bloody Puff

I am confused

I am almost alive thank you

I am confused yeah that sounds wrong no

it doesn't only if you think of it wrong

and if you haven't not in mind we should

do

[Music]

where's my

with my last two champs those are

clearly mine

some of these place I'm not looking

can we get the board of this level now

I just want to move always

[Music]

but I'm not finding

the remaining two gems are they just not

spawning

but I might blind

I'm probably blind

I'm looking for gems yeah there's two

green gems missing

[Music]

action

of flying

yeah I'm

okay

I'm not sure where I go I'm definitely

blind I I can see about 15 minutes

showed me everything's too blurrency

even in games

apparently you can fly up Beyond The

Watcher and that makes no sense

[Music]

would be fun if they weren't

then nothing else

I guess Cherry has been a bit quiet at

the moment to be fair

yes

we all love sharing

nice nice jumps by a nice jump

foreign

[Music]

why is there a hill in the water

and now that's a thing in real life but

not not like so short that's so not such

a sharp angle on the hill

I think that you have to affects the

position of the water and stuff you will

get the features of those

but they those those are right there

they are

come on

guessing I was fooling around until I

found them

Mystic March complete

so let's go to the devil

[Music]

tell that guy to shut up

what this guy

hello and happy time zones

and I'm not currently active chatting

and apparently not

foreign

do you like the

do you like the company mode

Balls Music again

Bugle Music

maybe they shouldn't give the work of

keeping the

[Music]

the fountain running by someone called

the snooze just just an idea

this one I just finished myself

yeah

I am happy like that one

this one I missed let's destroy this one

it moves

[Music]

the countering destroyed

an idiot up high this is big but

there we go there's no more minute

there is an orb in it for me

yes

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

but that's a creepy laugh

oh this place looks someone's sad

picture

let's listen to this game

I used to be one of the Avalon's most

powerful magicians there's a team points

I got hit while I was talking to someone

that's okay

and kind of slight resembles to the

other guys

is that some crazy hair

and the red guy looks weird

yep

that's my way of describing hit

that one could drop the thing hey excuse

me

I'm yes

uh lurking in the castle here

I'll take that

now after another one

who are you knocking it

I can't see everything camera stuck

outside

ah I don't have Sparks anymore

but

once the other long I'll survive without

sparks then oh

oh no that thing is active still

well since I'm playing Spyro did we go

with spider scene

like this

hey uh

yes okay so okay no more dress why why

no more dress I'm wearing a dressy

moment

either and I

fine thank you

let's shoot this from here

yeah almost

ah

no I could pick up that house life and

get Full House

I guess I don't have to do it again

oh is that like four legs and I've seen

I think they introduced it to two legs

indignant or something

no what why why did this move so high I

didn't mean it go so high

no more dress because I want the pair

this suspect there is an outfit for that

you know

made it in time to see the secret agent

oh yeah yeah

Secret Agent Zero

which is not in

pyro Adventure

Aspire Advent you don't want to have

secret agent one through eight out and

then he plays hit 89 but they are not

secret though

they just

agents

we shoot there oh yeah

it doesn't do this in reignited it waits

for you to move over before

[Music]

that ugly face

don't at some point thank you

but I know you are more slower

apparently

now we got some house

I wasn't done here

I'm a secret agent

yeah I guess he is a secret agent unlike

agent nine he's just an agent an

unsecret agent

here we go

I'm a secret agent I'm going to my

secret hideout only members of my secret

Club are allowed to go there I'm not

leaving unless you hide behind that tree

so you can't see me

hmm

he's sick is dancing

he's a

wait what do you say

then I'm not

say anything he says

[Music]

somebody remembers was special agents

because the joke was he's special all

right

[Music]

that gem

yeah someone has stabbed these

these baskets on top of those

[Music]

yeah it struggles as it falls down okay

I'll go behind

at this time I better not catch you

sneaking behind me when I was

for members of

when I was going in behind the tree you

didn't even give me a chance to get

behind the tree

[Music]

okay I was trying

is it camera no Kevin since it's passing

[Music]

can I stand behind you

another bouncy jump

[Music]

yeah it's fine it's down there

[Music]

oh never close quickly

yeah

okay okay

I can't go obviously I

I had to test

the cameras

[Music]

[Music]

yeah you must follow me much closer

then didn't make this easy

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I've never saw him in this version but

now you see him in this version

oh these secret ancient he yeah

I like Paris scream sounds like a

costume

I mean maybe that is not his screen

maybe that's him

I was going to say his squishes to a

hole but that doesn't make any sense

challenge whoops don't they

pick up pick up the gems as you follow

him

[ __ ] it that was stupid of me

oh yeah

I completely forgot about the prediction

okay man right now how many people

didn't predict

what about quite a few predictions here

one two three four people has predicted

nice

we got like

whoa whoa

about like seven thousand it's not

twenty thousand like

last prediction

it's about seven thousand is a good

amount

it's quite a secret decode it looks like

an arm

contagion Series in fact a Ford Focus

but yeah he does have quite the focus

being able to sneak up behind me

okay

I cleared out this area let's proceed

now

can you

well you miss me

should I keep this

right challenge of course not

let me stay

I wanted to be funny

I miss is the prediction damn

yeah it was going

wish I could start a second one at the

same time sadly not that could have like

well in that case I would just start a

second one which is exactly the same as

the first one it's just

another the players would be different

though I really wish I could have a long

time

all right why are you so sad cell towers

have been invaded by trolls you might

yeah I should I should get rid of the

trolls

what how much I have 19.

I got it

now

well you're aggressive

I got here we're talking here

do you have an order for me Spyro you

have freed our city from the claws of

those evil warlocks but if I'm not uh

technically yeah you have to defeat

every warlock before you get to this

point so yeah I guess

I guess he's correct

although you could like do like

get there without oh look the ice power

up is a nice Cube

nice yeah

let's look at the Thrones

they are kind of creepy

and the butt sounds funny

well where the power up

can I get up into that one

I must be able to yeah

okay next thing

I know someone

wait yeah anyways oh he's the one from

the front

let's see if I can now

yep

it's very slightly blue

there you go

I suppose you want an ore for doing that

well I'm afraid not there's still one

Bell left you can get

do you mind worth doing you're doing my

work but I'm very not I don't have

anyone

kind of got the same kind of ears it's

kind of the same one like we get can I

get lazy and do the same amount of both

made a slight change

there we go

two in one hit

company

yeah I need to stop missing

there we go thanks Spyro I think you

could do it well thank you for believing

in me

anyway uh

it says 150 yeah I'll say one well the

same people right then when you win zero

but we'll see

that the healthcare would be super easy

yeah I don't see sir that's that's my

fault I almost serious

I said that last time and it was evicted

wait how about 38 500 what's left and

sleep you want to sleep on I wouldn't

mind like a panda sleeping on my life or

something

that will be nice

I mean I do have a kind of flashing

oh

that didn't work

fine it's not the easiest to control

[Music]

I don't know what doesn't work

[Music]

and then Mark

start from the other way

nip

and it kind of double jump Canadian

I don't know if that works

something like that

my timing we did unfreezing

yeah I need to come up with somebody

again

[Music]

let's try it

I guess I just have to wait for it to

come back

because you died on purpose oh yeah I

took a little dark on purpose I just

love painting stuff on purpose

of course it's ended just as its own

Rose

oh yeah I didn't get our opinion

as

I want to sleep on time and stuff

especially

oh yeah

because

nowhere I guess

[Music]

okay

I mean helped me fund the production of

fun fun plushies then you can buy your

own Pom-Pom plush and then you can sleep

on that one punch

and as much as you want

there we go that's how you do it

took me a few tries

but a few trays

we could say basically first try

what am I missing now

gem

single red gem

where can I sing in the red gem be

hiding

that that check yeah Ferrari here first

seems to be empty on there

there's nothing hiding up here

nothing here okay get out of the way

I see

does it die from the Pines

not freezing no

that's a shame

[Music]

nothing here

yeah thank you again for showing where

I'm going yeah the camera is terrible in

this game apparently

yeah my camera is terrible in this first

part too but

this game seems to have more buildings

causing more situations where Cameron is

just sometimes outside especially campus

clipped through once

would be so convenient

okay I'm all the way back and start and

then snow gems here

um no way I can find a life-size spawn

company I said in didn't they say like

fun or something

so yeah there's there's no way to get

that now but you can

we can totally make

have a company we just need

the company having facing that people

who buy them

as I said

I think

like 150 semi Stone preferably

and out to the upper inner limit okay

on the upper range of that

oh there it is

that one Third Temple is complete today

wasn't so hard was it

I'm not sure how missed that one

but it happens

let's go to the exit even though I have

exit my lemon from the menu

that's bald music you ever said that the

first time was just silly

only been going for one hour

oh no he has a creepy laugh now

oh pink guys

Bugle Music 400 more gems

returning to Winter tandara

okay

foreign

[Music]

wait are you screaming

[Music]

even saying bulge music is just

stupid

who would who were confused towards the

bugle with bulge anyway

and that's the same balls the person

must have bulges on their mind

[Music]

a very naughty person Speedway adventure

for your Spyro it's not that expensive

you know are you talking about it all

right yeah I kind of didn't pay

attention to that one you're gonna turn

into RAM and then the ram started

changing him one hash right here on his

head he might get screwed

I see what you mean

okay the speedway time 200 gems through

and then I will get 400 for winning

what was the challenge again

it was that

the the uh those awards are huge

the um balloon popping with the nice

popping sound at least the

computer

Justice

I can do different propping sound

it's not the same popping sound

this is going the wrong way

I was

I'm input

the wrong way around

no I didn't start crying

yeah

it's the speedway speed wait how is this

the speedway Speedway this is Canyons

being

but it would be fun if they had a

Speedway Speedway

because they basically have one word

followed by the word Speedway

you don't argue they should call them

circuits in the European translation

[Music]

the canyon circuits I mean it really

didn't work

I know it's a silly thing to suggest but

that's just me with

localization

Nation last one

now

don't you go

now let's go again correct way

I don't know how to spread well no no

why is she such big

there you go

well well

all in one yes

or circuits by the way that will be

something too

is it in here no no fly

you can stand on that thing

now here is after design

promise it's very specific in this

all right Spyro all right ready to try

out my plane I just fixed it and I'm

pretty sure it won't crash now when it's

you're controlling itself

between thank you

break the motor tray yeah breaking

everything okay Spyro here's what you've

got to do I know what to do

actually I don't know what to do

hey

I didn't miss the time

wow why is it down all the way back

it's a bit noisy

is it just me it's a bit noisy

do you hear me about all of this noise

yeah

no he's escaping

breakfast

no

I got them

I hear you hey you nailed all of the

targets when I shot them not named them

I didn't have needs or is that what it's

shooting names

he just checked it he should you so you

should break it oh that sounds nice one

heck of a Korean airplane if it has

mouth machines

guns apparently

that's something right

you could play tennis balls on that

racket

another one

what level does that earlier clean out I

won 200 out of it

and then what

so an orb has a value of minus 200.

[Music]

okay the alternator cleaned time to move

to the inner area

oh I guess I'll give a piano

whoa Bernie's that's probably supposed

to do in

spired Adventure

just out here in the open

nice nice Hiding Place fairies just

we can't let rip to get them so just let

let's just put it on top of this wall he

will never

look there

right

[Music]

water

why is there snow on the ground here

it's inside water

okay

uh whoa

that's the last one

now on a few more gems

but uh not a kid gets at the gems now

but

I'd rather enter the levels

so only two levels left in the poster

robots and I don't like robusting them

but that's just this one is because

Republica forms really really not my

favorite and I completely forgot to put

all my dressing in and no one told me

we're sitting here standing in my

underwear never said anything

because I don't watch

as soon as you change the camera angle

the smoke was gone

you know what's kind of creepy there's

all the robots against robots

why would I remind you to put some Chase

on passenger

nice

don't let my me walk around in my

underwear

look for some reason you can play metal

in this level the wish breaks the basic

rooms of spider that you can't flame at

home but you can flame dismantle

thank you

this is supposed to be a robot it has

metal but you can flame it makes no

sense I've said it when I play Ring I

did this one

this is

summertime this is why this is another

reason why I don't like

um inspired too

and also basically the series might have

like the robot levels

you can play metal

by the way it's that was to the reason

why I don't like since except except

this method at this method you can't

Flame

if I'm flame this method

but you can't claim this method

yeah I'm not a fan of this game

I know that this is that's how it works

in the game but this is stupid

done

I wasn't keeping track of the time now

that's why you don't have the time wrong

skin like an ID

yeah oh I see overheated circuits okay

I guess

the wine doesn't work on the other one

at least the other robot level does not

have robot enemy

so in that level you're actually blaming

uh

mammals

can you die

well I guess I'll just have well well

yes I just have to pick up one of these

things

let's see something

I didn't see something

I missed a few things here

come on sheep

foreign

okay so this is the

Pokemon

yeah okay and all the metal carrots

I'm disgusted by this metal cases

[Music]

takes way too long to just aim

the order of one is insulated okay

all right this is the good King it's a

good game this isn't a good level

because you just have to stand

from a distance

eat it

I mean that yeah for those you can use

charge these barrels

until it hits the scene I mean to find

out

[Music]

oh it's just

there we go

about the other one wants to take it

I need I need I did say this isn't it

one of my favorite levels so

you can say

hello on my complaints I wanted

well I am here to talk about 11 so I'm

talking about levels

go

foreign

[Music]

don't reach them

they're way too high yeah

all right that's fine

I got another one

a sad one I know another one spawned

when it's a Hardy Beach

I mean it wasn't ever here there we go

finally I got one another one sponge

my Flame

I know another one spawned

what did you like to take at this house

but now I got one

all right it's moved into my Flame

ah sponge

yeah this is a bit tricky now so it's do

they want us to move in the same Circle

what happens if I go backwards then

I'm way too high up

which I guess makes sense

in terms of stuff

wow

they are so quick

I guess I'll lure them to the last

but

yes

wait it's hey this is the grip of the

ground

[Music]

come on

why is it quick why did it respond so

quickly

and

definitely

no sound when touching the water

foreign

[Music]

this game is so funky it's worse than

really United sometimes it said

like sometimes sometimes it dips up from

the ground and then you can't jump

because he's technically in the head

I have not have that is what I can

remember

now I just

getting irritated at this level now

foreign

just took them out

but yeah I did totally press that button

yeah I don't know what's going on here

but it's so hard to hit

I'm gonna stick stuck here this one

yeah every time you smoke that's one

game

side step now you are in the air

I don't think

all right oh yeah that worked

now it moved

where did you come from

are you here

where are you

I know another one I don't even have

time to locate the one before you

respawn

I was colliding we did when I was

playing at the using town

there we go no another one spawned just

as I killed it of course

of course

and another one spawned

oh did that another one yesterday again

and I couldn't jump because it was in

the air

and another one spawned as a kid lit

yeah this is an endless level an endless

Channel challenge

this is the worst challenge in the game

not helping out we're about getting

games with jumping smart another one

spawned

and another one spawned just as ignore

that one

and the game decides to be an engine

how how about

having spiral glued to the ground unless

you're going off uh

another one's Bond

[Music]

what kind of face again

hello

Missy

and and the friends

kind of cute

hello wolf

well 22 people isn't

foreign

cute cats

yeah I'm trying to take out these fleece

and um they are they are respawning

quicker than I can take them up and I

thought that was cute it's fine

they're apparently not

it would be great

music coming in with it I'm dying

with the whole party

hello everyone and wow the original

spiral yes

the one that's giving me a lot of

trouble

it has

it has its awkward moments

awkwardness

like taking out these fleas

impossible I've been like I've been

taking out them all out like three times

but just as I spilled the last one

another one spawns

so I've already done these like three

times now but the game doesn't want to

count it

foreign

yeah

yeah this is this is

called it's nice to watch some coffee

sprayer

until I reaching this game to Pink so

I'll fight

look at all the fleas are back

I'm happy

that you find it comfy here

like and could have counted

there we go

yeah my girl was gonna play this game

100 better

yeah

that could move on I actually got five

three to work properly now as well so

I'm just going to play that afterwards

not changing

so there there you go that was the last

one but now another one spot just a

second is it am I missing something

there we go finally

so hard

I hate those fleas okay that challenge

is definitely much easier in reunited

it's easier to hit them and I don't

think they responds quickly

definitely an improvement in

fact

let's say I don't think reignite has an

issue with

if you move down the hill

a regular doesn't count you as like

Airborne that doesn't cost

but

um

foreign

I guess it's just inevited

when I

am awesome

the

um the um

yeah

please I

I

didn't even really

decided that I was supposed to do

I can't wait to see the clanks that they

found climate friends

but thank you so much

but I'm really happy

what people are willing to

so um

[Music]

hey she's still here I I didn't even do

any any property

welcome

like

welcome everyone

and

and I hope everything went went all

right with your string

[Music]

yeah I feel like I feel very awkward

that's

that's the stim okay

wait a go spiral the environments won't

be coming near our crops now can I

that's good I've saved her

robotic crops from a bug zapper yeah and

that was probably accepting

okay here's a

and all right this distance

that is somewhere close to this area oh

yeah I know this part

let's do it

spinny oh oh no that's not how he did it

oh look gems

you're supposed to get those

I guess this game is where his body is

really nice when it comes to that I've

accepted that

didn't work on those fleas though

no because it's going to turn on if it's

turned on now

I mean it's still taking it through

because I'm pretty sure when you end

reach the end of the level

add the it's still not gonna the police

are still going to be now

from a gameplay perspective yeah I'm not

working on things

imagine if you turn it on and the fourth

leads just moved towards that singing

you just wanna challenge

oh

who's that

and what I've claim you despite being

metal

then

[Music]

now back to the charting challenge

it's a shortcut

the short cat

I'm missing everything

up

yeah that didn't go as planned

right like that or hot box out with this

one

you wanted you want to dress up like

that

yourself like that maybe

some

how does a wolf whistle

what does it sound like when a wolf

whistles

yeah like that but as if I like that I

would focus on making that outfits for

pumping that I do like of course makes

sense

your personal open for ideas for

different outfits

because the dollar commenting on the

robot's Farm's name though yes

and it's my other day

two weeks ago

I guess two weeks ago was the other day

I think it was two weeks ago

when I fall off it's because they don't

want me to charge that

thingy it's an interesting idea to try

to charge it

because I do have to

because I cut

because I can't use

yeah it stops

it prevents you from charging the

[Music]

thing

now it's important the worst attempt so

far

uh two weeks ago I thought it was last

week I haven't been defeating in a last

heck of time yes so this week she was

continuing his crash too last week she

fought a ripto and

and then started crash two and it was

the week before that she was actually

playing the levels of the last point

the yeah you lost track of time

definitely

yeah this is a bit tricky

where are we going

oh yeah the Applebee's

what was it green green seeds Applebee

John

who thanks

yeah I've been doing a lot of worlds for

dream

so this is the side week I'm playing

this game now wait this is the second

week I'm playing this game because I did

I did two streams of this

is it starts stream does that oh yeah

now I got it well I can run through this

thing

which I'm ordering this toy

[Music]

okay this is very very hard

trip and jump

that's it

but not a gem

now

I'm

without the doors I guess this would be

easier

uh sportswear is over

I should have hydrated I probably did

but I hide it again

and swimsuits I guess it's because you

all the outfits

and then I

come on

this game is not nice hello everyone

hello can you 89

Kelly

all right I see him I can call you

okay now I kept it it's inconsistently

here gives you every outfit

it's some

inspiring here

The Originals aspire to you

I guess this is more like version two of

spider

did jammies fight follow me

I don't know what's the difference they

are though

finally no no what stupid Edge Edge

between he's supposed to drive his

tractor across this track

tractor tracks

but how are we supposed to do that when

he has all these Ledges everywhere

like

there we go finally took too many

fear and that was

no it wasn't

so many failed attempts

I hate extreme stunt character

yeah he has to do some extreme stunts

with that track eh

I know I need to get I need to kill a

proper way around then okay

let me do that

the ramp because I think I'm Mr gem or

something TG

it was okay

it's not very active

uh that wasn't all the gems I'm missing

some gems [ __ ] it how much am I missing

six so three green gems

oh

fix

value

when

I guess that's

something I missed yes I'll start from

the start and stop with this or end with

the end thinking about what I want to

say

thank you

another lemon where is like a few gems

missing at the end

six gems left yep

next add the standard charge

point

no nothing there

you push to kill up on it

points

yeah another regular bunk there's a

point did you put something here

what okay did not expect that to happen

I guess I'm being stronger with doing

no charge run is

I just can't get around quickly

yes I guess it's okay to charge as long

as you don't

if you don't what

that is if you don't want uh whoever is

doing this challenge it takes a long

time and then they can charge as long as

they don't hit anything or use the

charge to like reach anyway

where are the gems

to die

oh there we are

potato

Bugle Music

music for my ears because it was music

no Flame or crypto do you want me wait

how am I supposed to do that in final

stage you have to play in and find one

and you have to at least the previous

like you can just try

you get the blue ones and charged it to

your other faces but there is a and now

we can do the other uh

but but I wouldn't do that because I got

a prediction going

so I have to

beautiful beautiful

where are the gems they are there I

think it's a sauna before and I know

them because I was busy with the fleas

and then

then I got frustrated by the things and

then

really should not have the pop-up

showing

it's a bit late now I guess but

can I

[Music]

is it part of settings

[Music]

[Music]

where is is this play I think

there you go that's what's the one

show on screen display messages that's

very Wi-Fi apparently anyway anyway

sorry

uh yeah I need something yeah sugary and

now pumpkin is happy

so let's continue now it shouldn't say

that's saving everything

a bit distracting

I can see you've learned the value of

orb Spyro yeah the valley of whoops

Metropolis Metro Police the Metropol

police

or a Methodist sign

anyway

let me out of here

foreign

from here

but the requirement of that thing I

think is one

it's not zero it's one

but look a cow without others

is is like a

it's a it's a it's it's

[Music]

all the budget cuts there's elevators

need serious work so this one here is

stuck unexpected would start working if

you could just give it a good whack

though

foreign

[Music]

from the Farms has got quite out of hand

we need someone to restore order find

the inventor Droid she's been working on

something big

that's more consistent

not that that voice that was

content in Turkey what I'm not a pinky

what are you talking about

a bunny

everyone has been a bunny and I want

this will be a bunny

I will never change

I will not kill the things I'll let them

kill themselves I'm not sure if that's

the right thing to do

[Music]

but I'll do that

probably

oh one

I mean it doesn't matter if he hits me

or not I mean

he dies anyway

and right that guy so calm about a pig

with a bomb walking up team uh

I mean if a pig with a bomb work or they

they murder each other nice

I mean if a pig with a bomb were to walk

up to you what oh what okay what what

would you do would you just keep calm

one from his bubble wrap

foreign

[Music]

when they

when they there was like this update

didn't any version of the bubble wrap

where they shared

answer pencil ambitious ax has taken

over yeah yeah

where they made it so the bubble

pocket in the air pockets I had a hard

time

to uh

to pop

and then people complained that but

that's its purpose to pop right now

that's kind of the opposite purpose of

it the purpose of bomb rap is to not pop

and protect the content of the package

how many Pop makes it worse

I get that it's fun to do but

there we go easy

excellent yeah

we're on the way to obviously it's not

unpoppable it's just harder to pop

which is the point of heat to protect it

from popping now so it doesn't pop

this isn't trash sounds like me and I

would like that

when I when I buy something I need to

protected I rather want it protected

put a weird

and couldn't get stuffed trash for not

being bad

[Music]

oh that's that's what that's what it is

no problems made for coffee no

yeah

you got this straight in his hands

stop shooting

surprise

[Music]

um okay thank you so much damage

and this one it really looks like you're

supposed to go up there but when you

activate this

he moved quite

per day and then spray turns around on

itself why is this one so close

a lot of invented right

[Music]

for your efforts in thwarting this

attempted coup please take this item

which living creatures seem to like

and that's very much that's nice

okay let's kill some sheep

why am I missing

everything there we go

oh there's all of them okay excellent

work

okay more seats

I knew it those first sheep sent out a

distress call the next wave of saucers

is incoming

but maybe that's intentional

what

I see there we go

reignited

[Music]

I need to open that properly you can

just do that

thank you

and the final one why is the last one

now I can see the gems too

many champs everywhere

perfect

power rep invention here keep this to

commemorate your Victory oh yeah I'll

take it an orb

and that's the last door six to four of

six to four orbs

let's pick up the remaining gems too

[Music]

and then I have all the gems

celebration

[Music]

so much Gems everywhere

small level this one

it almost tastes like they

either run out of ideas of how to build

the level

or they were um time constraints and

didn't have time to expand the level

but there's a lot of games just

scattering around this and

here we go

okay

um

oh yeah I missed some

but I still need to

all right

stand here oh he's doing that

like the

the other thing you can see when it gets

done underneath

it stops before it brushes you

how sad it doesn't Crush you

that's just boring right

no

my dress

tell me done with my dress

but I used to use this power up against

it all really

I mean I haven't tried it's an

interesting idea

now it disappears my hands would say

oh well that's a shame

yeah so it's about that

no pancakes no I know I don't have any

pancake

I haven't eaten so many pancakes in

recent times so I should probably hold

it off on that

Orsini

[Music]

welcome

[Music]

I'm happy to be a cute bunny for me

but I did have you dressed didn't think

you need of course I need it

like you've seen the eggs and things

that my gems like what I said hello

so I guess it must be in an earlier area

insecure molecule what

I'm a molecule yeah

they read into my name too much

or am I on

I am I on

yeah that's that's what name stands for

right

weren't we on molecules at the end of

the day we're at the start of the day

[Music]

you're missing my voice but

I mean

if only

yes she should hear robots be flammable

and have them explode

He's Surely actually not feeling well

having it out today explode and have

that like

mechanical inside shell

the Metro Police complete

I'll take this with me

take both sides

him you don't don't understand him one

time and not he can't hit him again he's

standing more

but then uh hey how are the TV that

that's that's I did not expect to happen

wait and also

even though I charge him that did not

count as an attacker parenting

and this thing are hard to avoid I'm not

have to avoid them but I think the

tricky part about it in this first time

now it's counted

yeah

yeah the first first phrase is not easy

as far as I understood this

is

[Music]

morning

now he's going to

no I tried to avoid him

down on it

oh I got the next thing

that's like that

no no
