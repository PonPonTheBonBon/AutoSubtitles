[Music]

oh no

that

[Music]

me moving this

over like that turn now something more

like that more space to work

in rabbit Stampede no I'm not going

counting STS I wrot that message man at

least

so got two new followers since the last

R if those people show

up

hi hello

Y and hello everyone

today I didn't mean

to put it in

there I'm going to make default

[Music]

press let's see here

yra

it that doesn't look

way you wouldn't you wouldn't add

the well one one mistake is

that you wouldn't you wouldn't add one

in front of s if you already modified it

with a different number now we have put

two numbers before

s did that

[Music]

[Music]

same

8

apparently I can't spell

apparently there go the number going for

101 or it

100

101,000 134 oops I

forgot you're writing something i

m no why did it delete everything and

when I just wanted to delete

my T there go now I corrected

it

anyway back to art

[Music]

wait well apparently I got rid of the or

body that doesn't make any

sense good see I can

append as they on it

[Music]

add the body

[Music]

back and switching back to settings like

that that's body anyway I must have

forgotten to forgot to duplicate it last

time I I the prev or something something

like that I

change there we

go so address what does pom pom's dress

look

like looks like

that p is wearing address at the moment

no I'm going look at a different

pictures

[Music]

so here's a picture I can look at so

another feature that you need is the

[Music]

bow and Par

this

[Music]

these

things need be CED up here

too SP

[Music]

way will this be an outfit in game to

yes that's the idea

I guess they call it

default I don't know about your

name the default outf does not have a

name it will be the starting outfit for

pon

[Music]

pon so

[Music]

we basically wrapping

on and let's C this

part not that

part actually don't know much I

need

this got meouch Oh missing some

[Music]

touch then I guess in next

weekend wait what then I guess it's next

week is probably what are you talking

about

[Music]

now

Sports outf oh why I haven't even

mention that outfit I'm not sure

what I don't know what you're talking

about at you confusing

me I only said that I was going to do

the

dress I just St with follow that but

yeah

any cop that as reference for

TR SP then start

asking

ah you didn't make it

[Music]

C I will make the SP too

all right that wasn't clear thank

[Music]

you yeah this will another

outfit when I make it I don't

know probably soon because you shouldn't

be a too hard outfit to do this is GRA

which I see if I can make so the dress

[Music]

I don't know how low it goes in my back

and how I should like split

it I could have the

plane sowhere completely different

[Music]

from there we go

that's why I'm confused I forgot to PR

picture here we

[Music]

go

oh anyway

so so what I can do

put like an angle at it 70° like Earth

is that like

[Music]

7 and then it's cut off it's like

there

[Music]

my wait oh it's next turn okay there we

go would this spe too

low

so I mean looking

at maybe even should maybe even be

lower the fluff is a bit too large on

this model

but I don't think that matters too

much

[Music]

that's too

much maybe something like

that okay I will make another copy of

this and then I

will see if this

works

and I only want it to

cut

cut only cut these ni nothing

else there SE B

in

okay that's more that's more

[Music]

like

[Music]

and

[Music]

then let's see if I can this

pleas there

[Music]

go and here

more

points

everywhere this

[Music]

[Music]

all I'm still lying down in bed H my SK

plushy that's sounds

good what's so what's the difference

between 100,000 and 101

[Music]

i s WR

100,000 I miss

[Music]

that

I got

confused

[Music]

hey pon pon hello

J well I just be the

at technically not with a triple team

because that's not German I started

allowing

that no do right okay they actually want

to I can apparently WR in

Swedish

so yeah because yeah you you writing the

number

first and then

[Music]

write the uh unit which is

Thousands but wouldn't same thing appli

the

[Music]

hundreds I think it doesn't really

matter I don't

[Music]

know it's not like people write out

numbers like that anyway it doesn't

really matter

[Music]

yeah it's like if someone were talking

it makes it harder to read yeah but you

don't read numbers like that anyways

itn't matter but I can agree that

bunching all the words together can

I that's why we use

news

[Music]

this

are

[Music]

good I guess I

[Music]

can well let's see

h i could

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

damn I'm very

picky I say you should are

am but not when I speak English then I'm

not

speaking if I said something that sounds

weird in English that's just English

being

weird make makes it harder to learn

number

see

[Music]

when I guess every language should

having so many emerals that's it that's

the solution

here there are some languages with

um exclusive number

systems and rabic and Chinese are not

two of

those yeah those are

not those used by multiple

languages but those are different from

I see might people might

[Music]

know but

was

beginning

[Music]

that now I need

[Music]

to and then I canate me

[Music]

St need it I need another

[Music]

one yeah that's more

I

there have been some language

unique numerals in the past but that was

basically languages using their own

letters as

numbers okay one still not unique

because they still used by multiple

languages in the same

[Music]

script which is pointed Chinese and

Arabic numerals are not unique I'm

calling them Arabic numerals because

they're used with the Arabic

script East Arabic

numerals middle EAS and

[Music]

numerals

this might

[Music]

work I think this works hope you can see

the yellow line

there make sure

there unless it should be

lower okay

let's time is up anyway so that's what

it look so this

game

mod I can make a demon

L some people probably would like

[Music]

that

[Music]

one and

that I'm sure it's my

choice can I take inputs

so I should do

solidify there we go now just let's

buy should probably not do yet

actually cuz I should probably add the

scars to

the

[Music]

and

so and it should also be the

strap here

somewhere where

is I need a better look at what p p

looks

[Music]

like there you

go

[Music]

is it

stuff

[Music]

away

[Music]

so and the snap proba

more

here that's

[Music]

cor here's a backup just in case and

this is uh Reon

let's

see that

works

see it's

[Music]

plain

let's see can

iot

the which could either be written

the native way or this one

way

so either you WR start two as three

followed by the 10 number so 310 and

two unless you're speaking like canones

or something where they have a special

30 symbol to use

instead or you can right start to the

decimal way where should right the

number three followed by the number

two yeah both are used in different

confex I think the latter is more used

with

calendar like a year for

example so

2023 is weakness

223

let's see yeah

here's the first thing if you go to the

Wikipedia article for Chinese numerals

the very first picture you see is the

Chinese numerals used the decimal

[Music]

way and the it's so worn out so it's

hard to see but like can put it up on

screen because it's kind of interesting

i l people might be festing too I don't

[Music]

know we

Boom at the top there there are the

numerals it refers to the

the G letter g at first and then says

two Z and

nine so it is

written like

[Music]

that

anyway moving

[Music]

on I'm supposed to e the strap around

[Music]

[Music]

here looks like i

c

[Music]

so maybe it shouldn't be too high

actually can probably adjust it

afterwards

[Music]

we

go inter

[Music]

ban

[Music]

I guess that's

the best one many options never anyone

like

[Music]

so

[Music]

there we

[Music]

go oh we are doing the saw abing heart

stre wait yes B have a had

B what if I want to

B

[Music]

can have

[Music]

a p pon pon split in half C

costume

outfit there you

[Music]

go

should

[Music]

okay next how long should I

scra it's not too long it's

like

that's there's so much DET okay can't

really see how long this C is because

it's outside view on on the

stream there go that's how long it

is

F well you're off

[Music]

no half s half

cambod

no

you but I'm only

[Music]

Swedish

I'm not can I don't have the

refence

[Music]

this like like this stress here when I

up there you

go I should probably be making kind of

white

[Music]

yeah something like

[Music]

[Music]

that and then try to to smooth out

everything

[Music]

here assne

maybe

[Music]

assne want this why

this thing

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

okay of course the dress is going use a

different part of the

texture so it's you know

[Music]

[Music]

pink I know that might come as a

surprise a

suprise

B well

I

guess yeah do do you have such a feature

what the

bunny what's

up this

guy I'm sorry can you say that

again it's so loud in here can you speak

up no I

said

I think I said more specifically do you

have such feature on your

model

ohver text

Mees that's that okay it's covered

oh well it's covered on my on screen

model as Mom

[Music]

[Music]

so

but with a redeem you can change

that but only one of the can change that

Al

so yeah that's more

iing

and

exactly want but I can make adjustments

here I

yet oh I know what

100,000 coins should let you do pet p

fluffy

tail

H yeah the tail is going to be a

problem you're not going to see it

much you can barely see it at the

moment on the screen it does poke out

but not that it makes

sense

[Music]

and I'm L of

Shar

up

sugar I'm making me

hyp I'm so

hyperactive full of

energy I feel like my streams are quite

low energy compared to

the it probably look finer like

me well I should I try some picturing on

me so I can make it look

good that's fluffy

T yes here plant Fluffy

t

yeah that's another feature get the p p

plushy and you too can touch the

tail you do want to touch tail don't

you be honest dang now I want a big

pocket of gzo beans so why why don't

that that sounds very random all of a

sudden

big

bucket beans that looks like a bucket of

yellow

[Music]

popcorn yes I want to P

[Music]

detain

[Music]

I have a kangaro plusy that has a ha

like pet oh that sounds

[Music]

nice so let's switch out this and make

sure we know these cor

designs thank

bow then need this stuff

[Music]

copy

I yeah this one a reference to where I

can place the

[Music]

dress H you should put the dress

on but I'm already wearing this

wearing

it it can't be more

[Music]

on this should

[Music]

work

[Music]

me

like I should put a bit more detail in

the

dress because P pun dress does have a

bit more

detail and has

being straight and

cirular

hard do incling for you're hard incling

[Music]

compared to the

texture really

[Music]

small

[Music]

this

[Music]

morning

that's that's kind of what you will get

in this

game as pon pon runs around and jumps

around and the D is flying

around there may be a few casual

up

ious

so so this would

be turn around

again hey this is already looking very

nice oh thank you can't believe PL one

thought of that her own and I said it

wait

what I I just wrote what you wrote I

mean I read what you wrote I

meant not sure what you're talking

[Music]

about oh I I want to find

s oh my

[Music]

goodness give

go it's a

right but

um

where the strap goes and the dress

should according to reference material

it should fold on that

[Music]

[Music]

part

[Music]

I

[Music]

go

and this is one Sonic

pce

and then I

[Music]

just

[Music]

don't like

that but now the stff almost fin

[Music]

morning

[Music]

[Music]

n

[Music]

and okay I need to hide the ear that

can't work that's not going to work

that's going to

work

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

okay

[Music]

oh

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

anything funny going

[Music]

[Music]

on

[Music]

[Music]

know

some minor adjustments

here

ta

[Music]

P there's party

here so I should make this this un not

[Music]

here bit too hard I

think here's the

shape most important is this

Mak stream

[Music]

[Music]

let's try to stay out as much as

possible

there we go that's

super it's not perfect but I think I

think that's good

[Music]

[Music]

enough

go

now can I sub divide

[Music]

this

[Music]

oh there we go that's more like

it do make wonder if I can do this with

this

[Music]

two

[Music]

that's

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

no

[Music]

go and it looks to be cor size

too that means

[Music]

that

[Music]

[Music]

I can

make but question is should

I

let

[Music]

that

happen wait why is it

so

yeah I'm not sure what's happened

me how do I

create suching

anime looks p with ears

to you

mean guess I guess so it looks huge

depends on

VI

other I mean I guess so there

go I guess I guess the bat looks be

without yes I guess you're not about

[Music]

that

that

and then I match these

two

and also

sh we

go it's not like fantastic

but

[Music]

I'm

making

quite again yeah yeah but spread

something I can't I can't feel the empty

[Music]

space and what have you beening

for should I tell about how I came up

with the idea of

P while you see since rabbits are my

favorite and decided that my first S I

should be a

Remy and then I got in contact with an

artist who draws

art

particularly w

w we got some guests

[Music]

here let's

say this way the time is up anyway

welcome

just a pixel

[Music]

K there we go and then you got

the then you have the other

commands

boom Oh hey it's a spooky foxy

raid

welcome and I love

spamy what no I didn't want to do that I

wanted to take a look at

I wanted to look at the Clos that the

[Music]

emot anyway

easy and we got Sushi legs that's

interesting

is I would not eat sushi that has

legs welcome come so what what were you

up

to doing art what were you

arting I am making I have the ears

hidden at the moment there go just but

as you can see

my you probably hopefully can see a

resemblance between these three the

model and my Persona

hopefully

and I'm basically making my thir

person I'm apparently not deated making

a dress but when it is animated it will

hopefully

okay

so yeah would need she kicks pretty hard

yeah well uh I wasn't thinking about

eating sushi leg

specifically day one of inktober all

right inktober I don't I think I think

I've heard about that I definitely have

heard about that multiple times I never

looked into what it actually

is cutie thank you no I'm not seeing the

connection oh so this just is that

random rabbit I'm working

on with no relation to my

persona it's a drawing a day for each

day of October oh well this is

my

well I yeah I assume you have to start

like from

[Music]

scratch and I guess no basis

[Music]

R I don't

know and also thank you for the follow

PX

spammy or you can do whichever ones you

want one a week doesn't matter if one

promps and you go oh oh

yeah you had to follow prompts that

makes

sense the 31 Proms and I assume they

provide them on the

day or do they because if you're going

to do it during day which time so then

they

follow you just start as soon as

[Music]

challenge well not so much followed more

just whatever the proms Inspire oh it's

more like a it's not a very specific

promp I come up

with I'm happy to hear you that you're

very

creative creativity CLS within

me and that's a that's a good thing when

when making art of

course

so oh wrong

side

[Music]

um like Place word

ah today's for dream it's it's that

general of terms I see so it's not

like dog sleeping under a

tree it's it's it's much

more not two specific

turns I guess that makes

[Music]

sense

well

you could

uh if you

want oh I'm messing that up link to your

artwork and then

maybe only if you want like then I could

show

it on the

stream think that

sounds I would be interested of

course

enemies and I give you sh it on if you

haven't I was

opening it should be the nest year

posted

so think like link state workk

but

uh oh yeah yeah oh I can't VI it with

account and I can't make an account

because they didn't approve my username

so so I can't look at it

closely I want to go

[Music]

some and I wanted to to unless I

can no I don't understand what

wait

maybe

no wait what was the res Solution

on because

Ina yeah because I couldn't it don't let

me R

account and if you want to see the time

laps

oh I can't

typ yeah so not look

[Music]

like Instagram have any high resolution

I yeah you don't see a much yeah they do

not allow me to look at the picture at

high resolution

so

oh wi I can't can't do anything I

tried I tried ra an account and they

rejected

it

so or is it

uh because I can only leave you the

thumbnail at the

moment so it's not it's not very

big by in is terrible I use it for my

heart H have you I mean if you have uh

Discord and uh your own account or your

own server I me uh if if you B basically

if you have Discord and send the photo

anywhere on Discord you can copy that

URL and post it in

there otherwise other option like

Twitter it's not best way to publish art

I

guess there is demant Art I know a lot

of people complain about that website

but at

least it's still it's still a nice place

to like SC art

on don't what what

[Music]

more

yeah I

don't I guess there will be art station

but

they it's a different type of content

there but uh okay so as far as I can see

I never commented on thew workk itself

so it's a traditional art as far as I

can see I put a lot of that and you did

that do you do

like maybe I to make it

[Music]

not

okay okay okay this is actually the

largest size I

can managed to get you want to see it I

can show

it of course if you want to

see okay this actually not too terrible

if I put it

on here you go

ready so it's a very

nice you put a lot so as can see

basically tradition thing and it's a

Bea there's are lots of different colors

and looks really

nice it's so

that's I came

definitely and I I think I definitely

have do

that a little for you I mean you

put I can't really judge but I have been

drawing D only I've done some

traditional and

and it takes me so much longer you're

you're very very

skillful I'm bad for one day for day

one definitely not it it's very

nice yeah you should be able to see

more more

on Instagram came came St for

Instagram can play the game when what

[Music]

is but

yeah

they I try

like try to speak H yeah it's like um

all all the buildings and everything

with all

the that's a lot of

like too much for me I can't bu drawing

backr I can like

there so much so much effort that

goes in the background

I'm I'm impressed of anyone drawing

backr putting so so much effort into the

main subject and then and then backgr

top of that

so is that nice background

too

I'm bad at talking about artw I feel

like I do enjoy

artw but I'm always so nervous

[Music]

too let's see how am I

[Music]

so

yeah smoke of the when release the

prompt everything SE that's just me want

to

spend 24 hours on it that wouldn't

work that's just un

[Music]

I didn't catch I didn't understand that

part I turn

[Music]

[ __ ]

never this te ising

anyway

never done any to but who knows maybe

one

day they do the from the whole Mouse you

can look as you like but I look

sorry during the whole month you can

look as you like but I only look once at

one of them then on the day or just

before each next let's

um um and I'm not sure if I understand

you

may the

general idea get this basic you look at

everything at start and

then check for the day you're working on

from then

on like hello at

on look at each day on the day yeah okay

so I can

it

h English isn't my first language I

don't know

how sometimes I struggle it's Sor TI

typing it's fine it's fine yeah you got

to B def

it don't don't feel like you have to be

around here if you need to go to bed I'm

going to go to bed well

K good night

again hope hope it

sleeps she a good

sleep uh

at this sleep who

knows it's one of those things normal

people

do and Artic

smooth does shrink it I wish there was

like an option to

preserve

like just start a volume

oh

F explain

L something out of this

world I've heard sleep takes you out of

this

[Music]

world and put you in a

dream try to reference today's

word

[Music]

no one let see if I

can finish

this you it yeah I think this G

work I can't and

like enlarge this

off if I

compare H it still seems to

be

interesting

it should to be the same as this

[Music]

one this one I

think anyway you were talking about the

origin of pon pon oh yeah yeah I did

that but it really either

right you lost your body i h the body I

got the ears not sure why I have the

ears I

think well it wasn't even a even a good

story about original P because it was

what meant as a joke anyway it was

basically well I wanted a Persona and I

like rabbits so so I found an

artist and then an artist showed

up uh was not anything same that would

be kind of funny to us

and

then and then I paid this artist to draw

an original character and then I got an

original character and that's was the

original it's a terrible story

CU it's not

really oh

ads

if the nice guests have

ads or rather don't have ads but even

more and I want to let me

know as long as no no one raise me

around 10 minutes before the hour I

really shouldn't take pay that when

happens did not do it this

[Music]

time because it feels really bad when a

raid happens and then adds a playing

almost immediately

like like no I'm not I'm totally not no

I'm honestly not pushing ads on all the

new people who just

gaming even if it does make economic

sense for me I don't get much out of it

so it's not worth annoying so many

people about

it wish should I lose on in the long

run but as a business we don't care

about the long

run

[Music]

yeah you can probably see the view

account as the as

playing I think it it updates the view

account every minute

but since the ads are playing for 3

minutes you good and I think I've kind

of seen

it it kind

of drops down slightly before each hour

when I add

place I think most people here have

subscriptions anyway

[Music]

so

and I wonder

[Music]

why wonder why swing sa

[Music]

time

so

weird oh as friendly and pon pon is not

in a

swimsuit ask request

part there you go there it me Smo I

think this is Def look

good it's because you're a cute bunny

that's why so many people

subscribe

oh yep should not look at the top gifter

leaderboard

here what the top heing the where you

are

like 1,000 430 bats from

[Music]

[Music]

10,000 so how should I do the I could do

a

[Music]

b

I could do a

tube

[Music]

tube che che and chew St those are just

extreme versions of saying things

like no no it's the same thing as say

sugar I think I

think I

could

[Music]

anyway it has been modifying in the same

way Wily it's not

super but one day maybe

[Music]

can't go wrong with that kid bunny I'm

and especially kid bun it which seems to

be people's

favorite I happy I get kid

Bunny and that's was the origin of my

bunny Persona because I like kute bunny

but if there any anything you wonder

about pon

pon I'm willing to

answer what about

me depending on what the question is

about of

course a

everything

like which hour where you born I

actually don't

know we

have red

M have

subscribe there we go started mon

five I have made sure that the

subscription message on the on screen

chat makes sense because that's what it

means the fifth month has

started and here we got the message p p

the Beautiful B the princess and

wiliness is her trats of course pon pon

deserves Tons of love and care and head

p a lot more elyn the P Pon no didn't

say that Ely pon pon the Bon bom is a

very beautiful princess World Class

B mix the

heart thank you for the s Mick that's

that's very kind of

you that's so too much I

how to do something

and to just come get S and things to go

want easy and hard at the same time

that's un

fun

so

oh that's a name I haven't had in a long

time hiy so what have you been up to

Micky busy school

work school

work I think make no when did I think

Mickey showed up on an art stream

actually but has been very active you

doing spy streams but I've been playing

a lot of spy to be fair

[Music]

so and I think I even how how heav is

what about people catching up to your

gift for oh man I mean you're afraid to

like try to

[Music]

C I'm not going to stop you if you if

you're making an

attempt

[Music]

you can

always you can always give a few more

you can always try to win the bits

ranking oh

[Music]

wait that's like gifting 7,000

BS I we you UNL the

[Music]

princess

been having problems with

IBD I don't know what IBD is so I've had

this I've not had a good time

oh

oh got to wait to no until they can do

anything for

my I keep being best the best give

compliments

yeah well s to hear about you're not

having a good time you seem so

happy but underneath all that happiness

is a dark side a side will never

see

[Music]

hidden

anyway

[Music]

intestinal inflammation disease

oh that does not sound

[Music]

good I wish could be a bit quicker

that

[Music]

when

Star it doesn't do

anything when we excep you get a bunch

of

attention okay here guys I'm

sitting and I could take some more to

drink

there we

go just my position here you go

[Music]

now

[Music]

what

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

when

[Music]

something like that of course the really

B has the same color as

[Music]

the as the

dress

I think it's

[Music]

works oh W another one I'm not sing bad

[Music]

yet oh yeah

fun remember what what animal you

[Music]

are oh look ring H should probably kept

that ring

off cannot have a full

ring can't make a un map of a full

ring and what can

do I going okay

whatever Mar the

scene this really St to the sign just

[Music]

that I mean normally you wouldn't have

Perfection

but it's not perfect in the M anyway so

anyway there you go that's more like it

that's more like

it

yay happy happy [ __ ]

[Music]

s

there we go there now it's done

anyway I've been clearing out this room

I wonder how much it's echoes in here I

tried to dampen the equo but

that's might not help

only I done my

best

there we

go so much easier to straighten

than previous

things if I

select every other like

this

and then do that I should be able to

select invert and no no not

twice and there we go now it's nice nice

nice that is strap that goes around

everything just I

save and then there's these

[Music]

things where should I put I could put it

on the

inside I get the and

outside

[Music]

see

[Music]

here something like that I

guess

[Music]

let's hide

this and then there's this okay let's

see how this turns

out not

bad oh and say for something say just I

can just not see it you check again

you're going to die

the chat I I didn't see it on

my model that's okay I have to say

so what with an animated mod with

tracking

everything so I

mean

[Music]

[Music]

that's okay nothing actually

um

oh yeah yeah cuz I that name I want that

name oh yeah if I do that it that's not

what I want

okay I

do y need an animated s

yep be so

[Music]

amazing and all other bunny streamers

will be so

jealous

I will have

[Music]

[Music]

like

[Music]

[Music]

one of

[Music]

those

[Music]

yeah and the ears will move

around hopefully I can set it up like

that like basic what I'm thinking

is I set up the skeleton where some

bones will have the

tracking and then I set some bones which

I put through the ears for example which

will have more more of a gravity will

not be tracking but move as the model

moves

[Music]

around I can add that to all of the

part that should move

around butt

straps scared

itself that would be really

[Music]

nice yeah don't like how C

sorry I'm care

then kind

[Music]

[Music]

ni I have course

very

cured doesn't make the texture look good

making the texture quite FL but I'll see

I'll try

to

I want to see if I can add a bit more

detail into the this it's going to be

the

[Music]

default this look so bad at the

moment if I fixed one of fixed fix one

of

them

I could adjust the other ones to match

[Music]

it yeah huge difference between the ones

that have been straightened

out and the ones have

not there you

go I have an app I keep on okay so I can

watch at times hug the have a have a

well good rest

and yeah sometimes I like to just put on

a stream and just lay down Rel

next fall as fall

asleep half awake and hear someone

speaking all right the stream all right

they have red

someone that's probably worse when they

rate someone who is

out

and oh all right I got walk in

up

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

so if I fix this one I can use

turn that does seem

right I can just uh move the other ones

on top of

it only time I ever fallen asleep with a

stream in the background well it's more

like falling

asleep oh who were you watching at that

time was it the one known

as I hav barely watched any of the

streams I've only watched some of

I actually bre in chat a few

times but those mes I never read

out yeah last

[Music]

week

[Music]

[Music]

when here we go

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

h

[Music]

I know

that that's

wow

[Music]

wow

[Music]

I wish I

could I don't know blank the vert this

for where where they should go and

[Music]

then and then have the move

[Music]

when my

S oh

[Music]

well it's not too hard it's just asual

time coning like

St see

my

S which

person I got in quiet again why am I

[Music]

quiet well do you have any questions

about Pon though I have something to

speak about chat has

oh yeah it's basically

you only here Mak me

[Music]

sleeping I

know R are quite new here might not just

me I don't know when I'm new at some

rate I usually don't speak much so I

understand they might also

left was about

fine everybody's watching a long Stream

So question about pon pon H does pon pon

like

so I don't think

[Music]

so and they look sharp and

dangerous

should when you

get

[Music]

SW

well I mean it would be possible to like

add objects that Pon can

hold you pump on something to

hold hold

sword well after all a full set of armor

could be an outfit

so

and compared to some of the outfits you

can choose for p Pon that would be one

of the least ring

ones oh almost everything covered up

with

[Music]

armor

p

[Music]

is it some Polish

thing is it

alcohol a B of A

Drink

boom three of them put

together sa

yeah

maybe a type of Polish

[Music]

saber

well sh I guess in comes from the

Hungarian

world is it on Hungarian

saber and

um what is the like what's the iconic

not

iconic what makes it a

saber what's the definition of a

saber

that's

CU I

know I have an idea but like I don't

even know what that's

true

boom

then there's this part

which I think I could

straight

boom nice work p thank

[Music]

you

I I pretend that was a comment that was

[Music]

me P want to hear a secret hello jto you

were here before and you probably been

here lurking all this time but I love to

say hello when you haven't written in a

long

time but and I'm going to continue doing

it regardless of what you

say you're a hicking master class kid

W do I have a

[Music]

document I'll I'll put it that up on my

description hecking

[Music]

cutie

[Music]

was

playing the protic

oh what might that

[Music]

be sorry

noise

okay I'm back okay back was making some

Ramen Ramen

oh that sounds

[Music]

tasty

actually

[Music]

it's takes too long time it's much

EAS

anyway it's Coop that's co co FPS sci-fi

dwarf mini

game in comment on Fortress

anyway

but

I I'd like some

Ramen would you like some raw man

maybe which I

[Music]

said be right

back I making

some oh have nice

shame are you going to send it on post

or

something instead of in a thermal box or

something keep in

he shamen p p

[Music]

tra

well I can only assume you are the

[Music]

[Music]

Trap

well of course you're

[Music]

sh I'm

app we can build a strong friendship you

and me

har

it would be nice like i

s

yeah as you might have seen I've been

playing return fire and it has a split

screen multiplay mode and a thing I want

to do is playing

well screen multiplayer with

someone and the idea is to put because

it's split screen multiplayer and both

views are both view both players are

seen on the same screen but I want to

put this

screen and this window which it appears

in across two separate monitors so you

can only see your half and I see my

half and then we do

some multiplayer return fire with hidden

information the best way I can describe

[Music]

it and of course streaming it as

well and to ensure no cheating is going

on the chat should be visible for both

players on both monitors so the chat

can't like right what's going on to like

only

me my my opponent should also be able to

read the chat no one in chat is allowed

to that is hidden from B

pleas but of course I need someone here

with me to play

with after I move

preferably and it would be

fun have you seen the lady and the traps

spet the

scene no

never it's uh it's funny that you ask

that CU um I don't know if other

countries do this but it is one of

the one of the

scenes that uh is

included on the

Disney

okay so every Christmas in Sweden and

maybe other

countries

there is a there is a segment on the

national

television and showcasing which they

call H Christmas cards and animated

clips from

different

things and

the well L [ __ ] spaghetti scene

spaghetti scene is one of

them

can I put this

[Music]

okay ah

okay just

some random facts

about

that let's see how much is of this is

clipping into life

am I

just

[Music]

oh that's not

good oh it's clipping through here too

that's not

[Music]

good

yeah so it's like CL cut cut down the

short

clips

[Music]

insert obligatory comment on how they

are cutting it down even further to

remove

any

dangerous

insensitive

and

[Music]

wonder a racial

depictions of

characters CU there are some older

cartoons that aren't

really

well fit fitting

today more IR

respectful Society imagine that people

show respect each other and don't make

make more comments can you imagine

where this world

come oh

S I did cut myself by making food could

you kiss it B I'm speaking of

cutting

and maybe I mean if you did get a kiss

on your on your oui from p p you will

probably feel

better

I guess getting a kiss at all from P one

probably make you feel

very yeah I think this should work let's

export this and then I'll add some

color and is back he's doing the at

UNL hey why why are you sending a

message to unlock what has unlock done

to Des

this Sly UNL has not visited my stream

so

far um like is there us with his

name um that channel is unavailable if

it ever

existed oh

well I guess you can't hang on L who

does not

exist you know so Harry

says yes it

would with with a

goom

face it would help so

much please kiss me all over my but I

mean

yes

wait why

AR uh wait a

minute should this be BX and

perfect it should be let

me

wait uh that

that pces

FES six but suppos be much

what's going on

here 25 50 okay

75 yeah that's what

I

stre

yeah

this

before anyway now the test has been

corrected expl

again I once cut my head on a sword and

never got a keiss for it it got infected

and I

died well

that's life

sometimes sometimes you just don't get

what you

want I did mess up the RAM and brush

this time though what's what's the

broth what do it do

this

okay I hav explain what have you br Upon

Us by messing you up up your

bro okay enough of the

war

did you get blood in

it that's not messing it up that's just

adding a bit more

spite I try to see if only adding garlic

ginger and soy sauce would but think it

needs something else or a better

balance I have never made a broth so I

cannot comit on

[Music]

that

not just my love yeah you putting you're

putting your love into the

food and it becomes Your Love

broth I wanted to say love SCE because

that would be

funny for the implications obviously but

well this is good but I think maybe too

much soy

sauce

it's too

s my first one was Sal which tast a

little better maybe I should insert some

salt in

it just sprinkle some salt in

it need more

Sal

everything is

soft yeah last time I added Parry Perry

salt which I think work really well with

the

ganger

yeah that's I have the exuse

me I'll take your word

for

here

I tried to avoid using salt I use spices

to season food it's salt as

[Music]

spice or is

that no that doesn't even work as a joke

I would even

say

[Music]

the only spice I know about is p Pon

outfit that that one I made before was

very

spicy okay

so so I had sing out the salt for soy

sauuce

I have I didn't

no maybe a girl must avoid

salt in that case adding salt will not

salt

I

readjusting can do that but that's not

exactly what I

want but it did reset it to the m but

what's the

option there you

go then just paste on

these

and then I set it to

add I to add that's way too much

add that's the wrong hand that's the

right

hand there a slight

hint light H slight

h but maybe I should do the other the

way around actually let me go

back

rest add to subtract

instead there go that

subtract and they

that

although

oh thinking

ands

and might have bad if I added less but

more garlic and ginger maybe something

else

Thea and spring rolls on the side was a

nice

morning know I

like um

sound like a good

me I wouldn't mind trying

it train

har morning

me

[Music]

I have no idea how to make any

of

well no

WI

[Music]

sounds like I'm not going to taste orian

broth in that place CU it won't even be

a broth in the first

place okay I should probably have

something on this as

well

this

part I think let me just

check yes this is

cor so I add the greent here too you

should

remember something yes like that

[Music]

I

think that's a lot of

green then I set it to

subtract

night this means

now

and okay this means that now when I go

back to

planing that and refresh it should turn

out pink who but which would be very

hard to

see got the ra from

m n n we have H some

egg to for night

musi

wolen

or however you say that and H

again so

welcome obious was J not not

uzuki happy po mons oh yeah it's

W it's the mon of

spooky yeah

it's polish month name name no pretty

thank you so what were you up

[Music]

to dead by daylight oh I know about that

game hope it got went well I don't know

how that game

works all I know is there's a monster

and there are some survivors and there's

and there are some traps

and the game content makes me a bit

uncomfortable sometimes

but that's why not too keen

[Music]

on I'm watching it but it's

okay right there go that's what I

wanted yeah I yes they like getting into

it's

not I

know I know about

that no no I've never never ranted about

anything on my

[Music]

stream

[Music]

no

well first I was going to ask what the

rants were about but maybe maybe maybe

you don't want to run the bus it

[Music]

more I mean I don't have a problem with

it

[Music]

but well this

[Music]

is as long as you have fun I mean

[Music]

like

I I'm not sure if it counts this R thing

on my part I don't know it's I see more

more analyzing commenting but

yeah I'm trying to find

something trying to yeah try to make

this work I think it

[Music]

works

yeah prob it should go dark in here any

wait what hold the rest again like that

inside the

[Music]

arm don't think I can think of this I

don't know how

I yeah you got how the Dr is supposed to

look but doing like the kind of bones

are there that that's kind of more one

dress is in

motion not when the dress is still I

could probably

those

[Music]

uh watch is thinking

[Music]

and

slowly well basically using

norite is what I'm trying to

[Music]

think

[Music]

this

[Music]

[ __ ]

one

[Music]

this

be oh I think it should be like here

like that maybe it

shouldn't yeah

and sitting up

straight maybe I should

there

okay just my

[Music]

position

here we

go readjusting my

clothes the fact suppos to shake with

my wait what was a self

[Music]

minder you felt that you P your surv so

you have

to have to make sure that even

iate

keep

should

f

[Music]

um all I

see should

this yeah something like

that I need for my own channel whenever

I get my stuff Sage again

yeah my channel is a bit of a mess at

the moment has always been

the I don't he everything I want to have

but like I want to run

like my plan is to run something like

mix it up it

doesn't exactly how the fish I

wanted but they were going to add it but

when I when I get to that point I don't

even need the feature

anymore so it doesn't matter in the

end but I probably bunch of other

features but yeah I'm not running

because this computer is very what can

do can barely play any games on it which

is not good when I spend two3 of the

streams on

King more SP that's good

[Music]

one

yes oh you want

to yeah she doesn't have

like

large not much going on here

[Music]

I don't have a

channel I mean technically you have by

being a twitch user

but back pain goes oh

no back P

pain

wait

wait does does your back pain feel

[Music]

pain give that to back paint on pain so

it leaves you

alone now my back pain is

[Music]

terrible it is

awful I do want to do some morning

exercises to like get my

body going but I'm so lazy

I'm so

ly and pro people can probely

relate 50 seconds I getting

old yeah getting old

like of a girl 20 years old that's one

year

old can't do anything

anymore need a need a walking can and

everything I is what careful back pain

doesn't sound like a good idea hi so la

I'm Dad hi

Dad I thought you were the egg not the

dad what a strange name you have

that knee pain and shoulder pain and hip

pain pain is not hip I'm young in

spirit

why is it dark though here because it

must be because of the

here anyway let's see if I

can do something about

that what I doing

here like a

shadow so I will important you out let

me find

it I

think okay there it

is and I just delete

this is

this okay yeah this is almost everything

except here got delete the rest I can

use this as a reference

and here's the

dress So I want to add a

[Music]

[Music]

shadow oh

[Music]

miss that

one and then I will

do blur it

out that's a slight

blur that's some more

blur one

[Music]

I

and then I set it to

subtract

that's I Havey Shadow it but maybe it

should be have Shadow because it's

completely covered in the midsection

there so you're not going to see the

darkest of this Shanel only the like

part then we can go back here and then

refresh the picture and uh this is what

it looks like now and then refresh there

you go with more

definition maybe be too

[Music]

much no

problem we can change

that

let's just uh change the value

slightly and

update that shouldn't be included my bad

let's fix that very quick there we go up

so now there is a shadow but not

this too much like last

time I got so lost in drawing I forgot

about the DND D preparation

no get

prepared you can do

it looking at my em I am so

proud

oh you got some egg

emotes happy egg smiling egg that

is that is some nice

eggs some whome

eggs oh that one is

[Music]

cute put some

trees my TR

W

[Music]

congratulations I

think

[Music]

so no what's going on

[Music]

here is p pom blushing so much about

that

[Music]

I has been fun take yeah going prepar

you don't

don't miss

it it's been it's been a good

stream and I hope it will continue being

good oh this snaps no

long guess I'll have to

make new

strips I will not I will not paint the

straps in the body I

will trying

to make them

really but look good luck look gun that

was the wrong way

around

good luck and look good there we

go so I'm use this plane to know where I

should cut cut it cut

it and it should be cic but yeah looking

at oh it's

Che okay now we can't see the dress p is

because she has some

different

well I

am

there you

go

um uh switching

over so looking at the straps PA have

here can I go up here between the

shoulder and neck what kind what what

does it look like on the back side it

kind of kind of to me implies like it

goes around the

neck because of right against

[Music]

the yeah that was the best color to

use it might go

around

find or just or or because it's again

against next it might go

behind down and connect I can't dra with

the mouse it might go behind but it like

does a criss cross on the back

side that could make sense or just or it

just goes down as normal it just close

to the neck for some reason it might it

might it might be because it's going

like closer together on the back it's

not as wide as on the

front I guess there's some options there

for how it could look like on the back

side what have everyone what has have

everyone been imagining I don't think we

think about that

[Music]

much

so what do you mean do you have an

[Music]

opinion what kind of shoulder

straps would you imagine to

[Music]

[Music]

be

I still out of this ring

here oh it's probably small because I

did accidentally smoo on ring too now I

might realized what I

mean oh shoulder straps uh what would

you call if they

were

what I mean it's still like a show ra

I'm not sure what you

mean no no I ask

like should It Go like between here

where it's the halter neck I guess it's

called should I just go behind but

because of un connect to the backside as

I've done like another

outfit we should did like crisscross on

the back

side I don't know what the artist in

imagine arst never did that back view

of this is something that has to be

decided

[Music]

foror I think you said that you already

had imagine like how P looks from behind

or

something how they dress how this how

everything

have everything was going to

work or is something like

that but

um question is but you I I really don't

know

right down

[Music]

[Music]

there someone just ask me what I was

doing

well not like not like what I was doing

on stream more like what I'm doing at

moment

stream no was it funny funny

[Music]

moments it's fine it's fine if

you

[Music]

that means they don't know my schedule

oh

no such

[Music]

[Music]

harsh oh

below wasn't where I was going

tras

see those shoulder straps look like

there white yeah but I'm not asking how

white they are I'm just asking how they

connect on the back

[Music]

[Music]

side

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

so

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

H yeah a lot of this bunny I can

meet

[Music]

[Music]

so

H singing out

loud

[Music]

so

[Music]

[Music]

right might need

I just missing cuz after

F anyway

so

yeah so I can imagine the STP just

being around like

that they don't yeah I think that works

there yeah I'm sorry

I'm

again never forgetting I never

remembering I am forgetting always

forgetting the sh you I'm just stupid

only we got the Z kitten b d

welcome

[Music]

everything

I have no idea what that

[Music]

means it makes her

per um

[Music]

man yeah

this so let's see if I can

make can always modified

position

and intersect

[Music]

[Music]

ban I can't prob my if that

[Music]

helps

[Music]

yeah that's more

lucky that's more like not sure why it

gives

me so we results every

[Music]

time even though I want the same results

every time I have to select different

modes and different combination every

time and sometimes even none of the

combinations

work and I'm

[Music]

confused

[Music]

don't remember like welcome in Spanish

it's

likef

see I speak many languages here on the

[Music]

stream mostly English but then there's

Swedish and Spanish

and and then what oh

look doesn't really have the

[Music]

same

nice it doesn't sound as nice as the

or oh that's no problem go go go oh

you you have

subscribed did you subscribe where you

gifted a

subscription

you were one of the first people to

follow

[Music]

[Music]

me

and then I just I guess delete all of

this no it's sling stuff on

inside yeah I guess

I'm time ever seen

him

ceiling so

ceiling we got a new

CH and

hola you

can't

[Music]

M oh yeah

just isano ablan is that how we would

say it I canot use a translator I don't

speak Spanish that

much so the ban is

[Music]

to

yeah all right all

right

[Music]

there

[Music]

this

I

have my pration

probably

and

you and I don't know

what follow with me I can't TR

like do something the

like

[Music]

put

something but I don't know if it's

correct small pieces left over

here well no not like that

uh I should probably go and fill up on

my

[Music]

twin I

will be right

back

it

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

this

[Music]

my

[Music]

yeah some Spanish to I

[Music]

kiss

so back in

[Music]

steps if you say

so it's quicker to just do

here

if did change

[Music]

right people speak

Spanish yeah for some reason there's a

lot of Spanish speakers here don't know

I everyone is welcome but you know

my ability to speak the language might

be

[Music]

affected what crazy language do I

have that I can still speak

Turkish

turkey Turkish

ises

[Music]

tur

K wait is that H actually don't know how

to speak Turkish what a surprise no I

don't know how to

read H what's

this

found you think there wait why is it

I can't find it I'm looking the wrong

column that's

why wait why don't they have c as a

letter on the how to pronounce letters

oh wait there it say it's making that J

sound it's kind of

[Music]

sound sure I go with

it

okay that's my best attempt at

Turkish for sure Turkish people

can survive my

[Music]

pronunciation but of course everything

in my much need I I wouldn't be able to

do

like speaking if I'm playing a game for

example and how the tunes

available so EAS is if people

just well try

using but I'm not going to be the type

that forces everyone

[Music]

today pun hey pun

yeah I know about apple pies I never

tried a che

[Music]

[Music]

pie also Kuru means cucumber in Finish

did I

say

no but thank you

for

uh how you pronounce something vaguely

similar

H yeah I guess I said

the

[Music]

which means

Turks

something

yeah oh a

users Turkish

users is what it

[Music]

means very remotely p

simar well here it is in written

[Music]

form my Turkish is to be expected not

perfect

I have very little experience in

it I do however have which might be AIT

surprising and my

tur episod

[Music]

even okay I need to finally to simplify

this stuff here

that should probably just

bees yeah they

[Music]

that's nice and

simplifying is that Turkish yes it is no

wonder I couldn't recognize what you

were trying to say speaking

Spanish yeah

no yeah because I said I said that t

uses are welcome and I thought it was

obvious that I would say that in

Turkish I think I met one turkey you

[Music]

see I'm at one Albania you it was quite

rude obviously that does not reflect of

Albanian in general

but but that was that was my experience

with

theion I probably have met plenty of

Alan uses online it's just I don't know

them being that's the important

difference here and that's a that's a

that's a topic in itself there is this

misconception people say like I've never

met this kind of us which I did myself H

but I probably have I had to correct

myself there

I think it goes with like one person

said like well I'm never every time I

met a trans person I know it's a trans

person okay but that means that you have

met

people you don't know is a trans

person I mean logically

speaking well all the people you have

met you haven't really asked them are

you

trans I mean unless you do in that case

well you're correct but you have if you

haven't asked every single person you

met if they transs you cannot say make a

claim that you always know a

trans that was kind of mistaken

didn't cuz it's

like when people because people say say

things like oh I

I'm never met uh never spoken to like

a ched com using comment section seeing

with that person who is like gay maybe

or something you probably have you most

likely

have you just didn't know about the

person this some this probably time to

that and

uh

assuming some kind of default to

everyone unless they did

otherwise which makes sense but it does

cost

so

moments

anyway this does these traps

work let me

yeah I should probably have better

that's better but's just make them pink

for

now then body and then I will add

the

solidify and make sure I get the

outside oh gosh this doesn't work I I

should put this this

after there you

[Music]

go does this work does this look

good I mean at least this makes sense

but not sure if this looks good

maybe maybe I should have him Crossing

or

something I don't

know

looking from the front it kind of it

kind of looks like how the dress should

look right let's let's look at the dress

because time is up I mean yeah I say

this this is what it should look like

this but the back side yeah may maybe it

should cross

instead

start I can I can like start from here

I only need to do like the back off let

me try that I don't need to

[Music]

like a stress stra let's call stra a for

now let's try to create version

B add

plane

okay now rotation I'm looking for

[Music]

damn oh that was an interesting me like

this well I

guess

[Music]

anyway that wasn't what I was looking

for

anyway be right back

okay yeah who would like to be a wrong

back

time this moment oh

and got a lot of views today welcome

everyone well I Tred to figure out how

to do the straps on the

bch very nice to have everyone

here

it does mean a lot to me that

people are willing to

watch me is making a

dress J should I try speaking on

finish H hello

there that's

Turkish finish hey

hi i h up F you have a good sleep sleep

kitty

um that's my best

attempt

welcome back and

byebye

yeah message

again

noise I think

some I think there is some Swedish do

help me some much with some letter this

without this

name

my is far from

ping does this

work

probably let's bring out this one again

cuz then I can do

this oh wait I need to duplicate

[Music]

first

[Music]

the need there we

[Music]

go

cross okay I hope you

are

rest okay since the sture are going to

be the same

anyway really only need to make

one okay this seems to be

[Music]

great Del oh

miss the

part

because I'm pressing the wrong

buttons that's why things don't go as I

expected

to oh no it's the

Matrix oh that's quite a message no no

no uh I guess you wrot the

[Music]

name Plus in case you want to

get speaker I did use

[Music]

um

[Music]

um use um a software for that

before which was

the this because everything lag and

stuff so that wasn't

[Music]

great let's check this one because the

problem is uh video tube is called that

one is running on Unity which I guess is

a benefit because it's easier to program

in and apparently should be able to use

transpar back and stuff but running a

whole game engine like that is not good

for

performance it's claim to be lightweight

from which I mentioned before probably

certainly lightweight for a unity

game that's definitely not lightweight

in in

general but how I depends on what engine

this runs

in

[Music]

plus P that You' like to move S waves

only allow Sprites to attach to other

Sprites oh all Sprites to drag

behind

[Music]

bouncing jingle

SPL bright images at any time

[Music]

light same and Sh with others more to

come

V

okay

four positive Z negative only

[Music]

four okay it does seem to have quite

the yeah yeah I seem to have quite a lot

of

um options when it comes to uh do

that uh yeah I could look into it and

since I'm doing mostly

uh Playstation games now computer is not

running the game so much

anymore and much more heav games anymore

so that might might work thank you for

suggesting M super great work so far

I've been washing a bit from bed and lab

is

for to keep but don't worry I it's nice

to know that you're even if you're in

bed that you're still

here I appreciate

it yeah it would it would be nice sa

there and I I could should yeah I could

do something simple that that software

seems to have a lot of options but I

could still do something simple

and but

still and hopefully it runs better than

me I could probably run me to now it's

one

but really depend what engine that one

is

building and then it's unreal or

something I don't know unreal seems to

perform better on my computer than Unity

anyway

[Music]

so uh unreal does run surprisingly good

or this bad

computer and it's really noticeable when

you run a unity game like I am fish the

computer cannot run it or when you're

run a real game like

[Music]

spal which I I think looks graphically

more intense but it it requires less

[Music]

performance of course of course you need

you also need to take into consideration

which I mentioned before as well I'm I

this most and that SP was built by a

large team I am fish was both by a small

team small

small so the difference in how well they

know the engine as well and what stuff

they can

do to really take advantage of uh the

engine for performance wise and so

on so there is that difference of

course I'm going to cut it off

here and the to

[Music]

front so here's

that need this one

in wish I could try to align

these

[Music]

so yes let's start with

that

here I need to find a way I have I find

[Music]

way okay do seem

to

[Music]

so it's yeah here can get the

F that's

better the one goes down like

this don't that

[Music]

there now it's

gone I really want these lines to go

across that way instead of it being

agreed like

this

I need

to I could put a nine here like that and

that and then this s

things we

go

okay okay this isn't the best

me it will hopefully work

though

[Music]

going on the server nothing everything

is fine on the

Sera I just hope be

[Music]

[Music]

next it's

[Music]

[Music]

working and

then placing this same

here

[Music]

wait why are he

sleeping why

[Music]

[Music]

there

Let's

[Music]

uh

else and that there you

go if I duplicate these straps and this

would be straps

B which oh that's parking here parking

let just done that

[Music]

again when when the Chat is dead you can

ask something about F you can ask

something about

[Music]

F what is Puma's favorite

color

brown

wait

[Music]

what not play

Lea purple one's favorite color is

[Music]

purple okay I

[Music]

should split this

off so the

seate

[Music]

and then match them

[Music]

again

much

that's one

[Music]

say

andary

that this it's so far

time beyond what

being

see don't feel like this one is

necessary to

have nice so now the two straps are

separate join everything

together what's what's pink I don't know

what what pink is

what is

[Music]

[Music]

pink okay so then merge by distance and

then

this not perfect

[Music]

but

well no what going

on oh that's

set that's what's going

[Music]

on okay this one look like this one I

this this one look like this one this

okay is it heric

word is the worda yes in Swedish

isasa that is

correct let SL copy of this this is

back or I something like

this

okay let's see how much should Ming like

this then I move

it that's

not and then I add a press

back yeah I wanted to move and the ears

another B maybe this makes more sense

but the way this strap is shaped here

it makes more sense if it's like

[Music]

this polish

is I'm

simology yeah it's basically from more

[Music]

Rose which I'm sure you can use as a

color name in in

well I I'll take that this

works okay does not need to go this far

down into the

this cuz you want see these this

anyway

taada let's insert a pump

ta inserting a pump into the

dress

and his

St I think his St and

then there you go that's that

part

[Music]

[Music]

celebration

okay it looks to be basically ental

here except that

part

yeah here is where it

[Music]

starts yeah no IDE why one is

[Music]

off makes no sense to me

[Music]

what

[Music]

oh that

on

oh but

yeah

Isa but has a name not to call

[Music]

yeah the Swedish word for pink is not

too far

off it's just one letter off from Swit

word for panties one more like panty

actually

where in

[Music]

here

yeah I don't get this

part but

[Music]

anyway let's just straighten everything

out that way straighten out that

way that

def there we

go

yeah it's fine

[Music]

[Music]

with

so doesn't

[Music]

[ __ ]

oh

no doesn't my

[Music]

I

[Music]

when

see one

L

[Music]

of course

[Music]

I I should check how much

Investments 100 second

nice so steps as well

okay

I didn't know what they

[Music]

put

[Music]

anyway yes this looks good

[Music]

good good

good so what do

we that's the

dress so I can add

the me stra

[Music]

[Music]

here what on

and now I

control I'm afraid I he man for

this

but

[Music]

yeah

Bic

be no fil this fup show up I well no

popups

s

[Music]

and then we change it

to

[Music]

can we put everything together we have a

one like

this and

then and then you just export it and you

run it to the website that I never

remember the name

of

I the name it's smartpage netsmart

normal anyone who wants to use this

website I'm give credits to the website

for using it I guess

that's

so now when I go to

normal it looks like

this of course this isn't how I want it

to

look I'm going

that dress oh

just

when the chat is quiet you can see the

sley

[Music]

stuff and then here is the another

NE there

there yeah and then I need to

the

voice there that's what

Happ

so I save

this

m and then want say

is

normal a normal is basically

which angle faces kind of an interesting

name which is not the normal texture you

would use

normal after is back to

normal and

now this extra have

up so I do

image replace because I'm not yet with

the

new Fire position so

they

much there you go now it

sounds does hey what

does the

text wait why is

it

that way yeah that makes more

sense here

too there you go now

it's normal

just

this I probably should make this

strong maybe maybe that strength

[Music]

is

how

much pop

strings nice detail put

more

put no

yeah

you would see it unless you get clar

spot I guess it just add some of texture

to of

course hi

hello I'm working on p p what a

surprise you didn't see that one coming

[Music]

so I want to make some in

[Music]

family which be some

here I'll be

dress I mean looking at my own look at

the Hem of my my

dress Cas lifting it up I mean I'm alone

[Music]

[Music]

here

so no one

[Music]

see yeah it's a

hand nice hand oh

no my dress is turning to a

[Music]

chicken that

happens this is how I

want

experimenting

expand

[Music]

don't worry I'm still sober haven't had

a single drink it's not last week so

last week I almost already dead we I'm

crazy last

[Music]

week I

mean when you see his

scir SC edges as chickens you might have

had a few too many dreams

[Music]

but yeah be

[Music]

careful

[Music]

I see and

then this night should only be a s l

otherwise theying

with

[Music]

yeah

[Music]

so

[Music]

that by creating a height map you can

generate another map which I mentioned

before

this would be

[Music]

not well let see how it

[Music]

[Music]

goes

[Music]

some

[Music]

lonely on there we

go so if I did everything

correct what

is

map and say as

find a website on

[Music]

it

[Music]

it's kind of hard to see yeah this

day just save this and

see

if it's

Dy

there I

think what's ined what's outed should

be you have

like whatever this would

considered no problem I can

just in the image editing

software a s filter okay and then

I update the F and

update that's not like it

better very very

f

[Music]

let's try something

stronger

let's so if I if I make this stronger

[Music]

and import it

again

[Music]

hopefully oh delete everything around it

[Music]

that but then I also

want you want to copy these lines no no

[Music]

those on

C I do

want

[Music]

but very think you

[Music]

know let's TR

that

wow close

up have close up of her

breasts don't look too

at least like

assit away there still something

there not sure I'm looking it let me go

now we can take a

look now when you zoom in you can only

see

it add

something same

here of course the

the the thread used seems be very large

but it's just making me more obious

[Music]

[Music]

is but yeah there we go now I just need

to figure out how I

[Music]

should how I should do the ends of

these think they only yeah I think I

don't think they have any special ends

I

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

this it's

something

think

yeah sometimes I don't have thing to

talk about so I just sit quietly until I

can think of

something oh

[Music]

the dress goes like into the body so I

can

like you

know cut that part off from

like this one to make sure it's inside

then I don't

correct spot there and I don't need this

one as I can need

[Music]

it I I

could

more

there you go let switch

Sportsman yeah

too we a sport I mean it is I mean it's

not really a sport ised

but I mean

different again let me take a

quick I mean I guess a sporty swimsuit

with like wider straps and not the fre

edges at the bottom or something like

that I think that would be a sporty

swing sh maybe with some Racing Stripes

no like strip pattern instead of the

rainbow pattern I guess that would be a

sporty sship SP on any sports for outfit

I mean is this possible can

[Music]

but then you see have a

tummy

yeah

yay actually jobs while I'm watching

stream I hope you find some good job or

some jobs yes at some points you got

really

sadly but I just have fun you find some

good jum

guys what is this this licking everyone

is

licking lick click

[Music]

cck

why did

the so if you do the emot first and then

reply it becomes large but if you do

reply first then the it becomes

small and I need to look into that

because that's kind of

weird that's

weird because the the default for twitch

is put in the replay reply first not

after like the name

don't each other I kind of do mind

people just going around leing each

other I mean where's my leing I

mean no I

didn't I

don't no

oh no leaking

everywhere this whole place is going to

be

[Music]

wet and then I can delete this

same number of faces again

or

but

[Music]

Tech

wait let me go

[Music]

back

yeah yes let keep it like that we do

look closely you can see

it you wouldn't see

that you wouldn't get that close to the

in between us oh you youing me from each

side all 3 maybe oh papa wolf joins too

andan four people standing around me

leing lips on lecking the thighs oh

Sur on the Sur we encourage more

leing I why else is theing

[Music]

OT

[Music]

all

right okay see

see don't like that oh sorry about that

C saying

something apparently does not like lick

you and apparently didn't like it when I

said yeah s like this a bit

sensitive

sometimes but yeah I don't think I can

add any more to the

dress so this

is the

P

the with a dress with a

Dre should I

[Music]

make

evil

F you know about evil puns

on

B

chat do you have a b Bon

emote I'm

boyy mode let me

prepare

I don't have

[Music]

[Music]

a don't have that

[Music]

[Music]

okay

I don't have what I'm looking for

[Music]

and chat what I

pr had to buy new Microsoft

3658 once was 69 now now it's

8394

now they increas in the price what do

you

do I don't even know what that 365

is Oran had a emote for B oh yeah that's

the boning I know who that

is that's

[Music]

staff

St Sho let's be confused

with

SH I can't edit the text files got a to

do that silly thing you can upload them

to Google

[Music]

Drive

[Music]

if you

just edit you need to do if you actually

want the software okay in that case you

have to pay for it but if just edit the

F you want to switch out all the

software something you

can you can upload into go drive or you

can you can most likely use like if

you're going to

but when I extract them to where I said

job they won't

accept que try

what that sound strange what are you

working with Microsoft or

something when you get a job like okay

even get this job I had to get myself uh

360 so you have

to as a first payment just pay

for because I had to pay for

it that's a de

right

sorry I'm not taking time for what I'm

doing I'll bring that up to my when I go

there yeah play me up front 89 and I

will work here I had to pay for

words

exactly it's fine it's fine trust

me

yeah

it's you can trust me I've definitely

done that

myself

okay I need

to is it taking a bit longer than I

expected but hang in

tight hold down

tight

get

there they should also put in that the

person needs to have word and a car

license

yeah that would be

[Music]

something

[Music]

it will be a hard thing to

[Music]

make

[Music]

[Music]

okay

just wait a little longer I'm almost

done I should have done this before but

I didn't think about

it some give you a company cly that's

nice I was trying to order a book about

polish saber but couldn't fill out of

the order form because one of the felds

is for something we don't use use but I

can't

continue are they how to do that yep

same thing when you order something from

states to another

country and then like please enter your

five digigit zip code but I SED

I mean we do have

like five digits so I mean that works

out but sometimes it's five digits and

just I could I could be

wrong sometimes for some countries

doesn't align and

then I think one time I had to order I

had to select which US state it should

be even though I ordered selected Sweden

as a country to ship to and and all the

information to insert was the same like

was the one I had to insert for like s

them so that was my problem but he just

forced me to select the new state

regardless of which country i

s someone probably didn't look look

through that

anyway I think I did

[Music]

[Music]

it

so yeah I I'll think I'll think that

be okay

[Music]

fun fun making strange

[Music]

noises

there we

go let's

um know what the evil P looks like I

tried my best

here

boom let's say it's a bikini

okay H zp code poster code

yeah not every one but that's that's the

thing sip code is specifically referring

to the US system or the Philippine

system because that's the name of the

system post code is the generic

term Z code is a type of Posta code but

not the PO poster code is not a code it

was confusing like I know that now but

it is confusing if you don't know it and

it probably confus a lot of people like

what what's this I don't even know what

this is there a lot of websit that

offers international shipping should at

least

consider like if you if you accept a

shipping to other countries like if

that's a feature you have you should at

least I wonder if this on standard for

that yeah but but putting poster code as

the default and then change it the Si

code for United States makes

sense I prefer a company CAT Company

cat even P yep that's p p it's just even

P nothing strange

here that is perfect where

Halloween do you like it I do have it

set up

here that was not first I'm pressing

wrong

Buton that I

do why do

[Music]

much

much

this is

[Music]

strange oh that

was Ro is makes this

one kute evil p p oh she's gone

already yep please she's a sneaky one

so yeah let's let's say this is a bikini

this is this is not underwear this just

a

bikini I should uh make this

[Music]

I should make this

[Music]

into har is likes the evil p

[Music]

p look Pon P hell no I mean it's the

evil version of pon pon and it's going

to be an alternative outfit for the game

for the mod and the no it's a bikini

I mean just not much of a

[Music]

difference can that even P hunt me down

she will hunt you

down she

will she will do something to

you I call P i' C myself with that

dagger for the blood ofing but evil P

doesn't even want blood I hate these map

tests for job application that makes no

sense do you have an easy time to get

mad I

mean you say that you're a perfect

person P know on this what's under this

dress Oh you mean this

[Music]

one panties boy shorts more specifically

which is still

panties because she's going to have that

on every clothing

so she has FS OB there for drinking

blood cuz that's only I have BS for

nothing else so I will

um just check what the outfit name is

that I'm replacing evil pump on

me you tastes so

good me knows

that you I question where you what why

where you

tasting no don't

question let's

um let's not consider

that so let's see what

the original outfit name is that I need

to

replace

one bat okay don't to replace one one

bat with my original

character one with

evil that's that's what name

is I guess I

can merge all these parts again

now

so let's duplicate all of

these put it in that and now this is the

version for evil pong

pong what's going on

here I why are you tasting your

neck be gentle

I

really evil P will get drunk from my

blood high alcohol content yeah that's

why she doesn't drink blood would evil P

be a doing

probably she will she will she will at

least try to dominate she will fail at

it but she will

try is% water he is inde 7% alcohol

conent rest

water he's just he's just 77% alcohol

and 23% water nothing

else

well 23% is

hate oh no what are you doing

here a dumb ass

withness that is and that is evil p on

the

way

so what I will do is now change the

texture to include like the F color here

so oh I

didn't

wait I didn't even complete the the

textures um let me just do that

[Music]

first we take Coco

here and then I figure out what all of

these should

be hate against water I work night

shapes hate towards that a burning

object in sky that disrupts my

Slumber so take the shirt because I

could assume it's like s material to C

dress C

dress so we have

this that will copy

over this two

here okay copy over everything except

the one I

[Music]

wanted again C wrong

thing go yes did

that I can export it when I'm done cuz

it basically has

Dr and and this

is

FC for football club no

[Music]

it's these are

scary oh yeah those are kind of I mean

wait

one oh the one is bit I

[Music]

guess bat emote yeah I don't have access

to sadly you cannot give someone

B it's really a shame to be honest

benefit from

Bo IM before which would benefit from

it okay what's the is this

color let's make the dress this color

which

is

go name this as

oops which stands

for

something looks like I'm missing

something

here which is a

roughness and metal is

nothing just copy one of the other metal

textures which I have it

down to save to make the F size

smaller here we go

and

finally that one's done and roughness

for some reason

lost but I can copy it from there we go

and now I just need the

[Music]

dress the

dress but going back to Coco what

roughness does the shirt have it varies

but it's primarily this roughness

so make get that

roughness there

[Music]

go one more time sa it

correctly there we go

that does mean that I have

to

here I have to replace

these what does it change

here

repl everything seems great now

save oh have you drank anything today Dr

Pepper

okay have been drinking anything that is

not alcohol

content Aran tries to be

good right

Arian so now that that is

done and now I made these textures and

now can take the default copy it

call it one b and call it evil which is

the with evil Pon P that I I was

thinking he was going to

wear the same outfit as pon

pon it just

started so all

right let's go back to p

this is the color so this is the

original color did I yeah I might change

color such a creative

character just an evil

version we got a new

follower the next time play this song Oh

interesting song we

got why

to

R

sorry because that's just s r which

means to

roll but y two doesn't

mean more evil p

p what's the

location H I'm going to make evil pondon

the occasion is making evil PP into a

[Music]

character so that is white her nose is

black so that shouldn't be any

[Music]

problem I actually I actually think the

evil pon pon looking

K yeah I don't I don't know how I should

do with evil pon pon I didn't know what

I should do H because

[Music]

I I

[Music]

had I don't know

I actually don't

[Music]

know don't know I'm

sorry

[Music]

I would argue that the body

pattern could have been a bit better it

looks quite weird at the

moment but I guess I could change it

for the stream mod or

something

okay

[Music]

um everything

here right see there oh

hello has details all

over the

detail oh dress is finished then I don't

know what else to

[Music]

add

[Music]

no idea what to add I guess it's

[Music]

[Music]

finished

[Music]

guess yeah I do want to do something

with this character but I just don't

know

what I can

do I

think I think it would look fine in that

in

motion it looks weird currently when

it's static

but I don't know if if I can cuz it

looks very because it looks very SOL

at like one of the those futuristic

dresses which what basically wearing

a filter

looking the Retro feature

looks okay

so

I can do like something like

this but I to make sure that it colors

correct the

red

should yeah that's the exact shade I

[Music]

need

green is slightly

darker that dark you go that's the

CH and then

blue so supp I might need to brighten

them don't know we'll

[Music]

see let's test it out and see how it

goes so I would create a new fer

go

one go back to

blending oh blue p p yes has a Lo

of let's speak any texture

does and then

replace make copy of

it replace one but

with

[Music]

Neary look

anyway what is it

6

hours I didn't Ste yesterday so it's

fine so I will take Coco one

b

OO

actually

let me copy over all the textures from

here the other ones would be basically

the

[Music]

same

so back

here go to this

m

much

difference

on

then non

color

same still

Happ

PA yeah there we go

that's nose is black even fun

fun it has

started let me go and get my chocolate

bar

[Music]

here we

[Music]

go everyone who has ADD no I was gone

and I picked up my chocolate

bar oh wait I just said

it

know

not frozen but

fringed it's a dark chocolate

[Music]

bunny so the inside of the ear need to

change

[Music]

cor and the eyes need to change

everything change

colors so let's put the

ears let's see if I can do

this it is change too it's more

fine oh chocolate bunny time to e

chocolate

[Music]

bunny

[Music]

yeah when you have one of those um

wrapped up chocolate bunnies then you

remove the foil which is basically the

bunny skin and then you get to

the removing this basically

skinning

happy oh

and then you eat the inside

nice

anyway Hello

Mickey what are you so happy

about

so I should be able to do this

by it would be really F like this the

idea of me voice

acting replacing all all lines from for

Coco with my own

noise

I want the chocolate bunny right now

they has so D

tasty got done with the m

thing next now next job and I got send

it within email said Oh e pom pom

waiting for

now new product idea pon pon as a

chocolate

[Music]

bunny that's almost

good but the

dark

that's very Clos what's

looking more like

that there we go that's the that's the

car I call dips on

the I hate you eting your

fingers I not my

fingers no yeah

just the regular eyelash have it does it

does have the ey

Shadow no eating each other's fingers

here the eye white here should be an eye

[Music]

black

than

I need to replace the one the evil

[Music]

P okay let's see if we can darken

[Music]

this come on now I have the wrong one

open that's

funny there we

go okay it does look kind of weird with

how shiny your eyes

[Music]

are

[Music]

uncanny what what's so

[Music]

uncanny it's just evil P

[Music]

Pon okay maybe maybe I need to make the

eyes the eye white thing L

sh because having it black but still

very shiny might not look that

good it might need to be this

[Music]

shininess okay this might actually be

too too little

[Music]

shiny somewhere in between

maybe something like that

[Music]

the eyes even

fun Scalera the white part is the

Scalera he has black okay is that a

problem problem with

this okay if I try to reduce the shin on

it might

help maybe ices too much

[Music]

well you don't like you don't like it

black and

[Music]

shiny although I do wish it wasn't

reflecting but

reflect like that me but oh yeah it

should very black

black not

[Music]

reflective what happens if I making

metal metallic

eyes oh that looks nice so is this your

you being evil or an evil twin I guess

it's like a evilness taking over one

one

anyway

more but her eyes should be

red think a glowing I I'll get to the

glowing part later on I I'm going to fix

something about

there but for now the

eyes

okay let's

[Music]

see I think I think the eyes are just

pure

right okay one

was

um I

[Music]

think I think I think they're supposed

to be pure red

and then there fix and fix on top of

[Music]

that

[Music]

so I'm now he T looks at me that

art

[Music]

hello

so haris are

you fre

today I don't

know

[Music]

bet maybe I shouldn't break

[Music]

the

I I'm reading the wrong

[Music]

numbers silly

[Music]

me there we go now it's t

and I want to this part to

[Music]

me flashing

eyes I think that's

good let's try it out let's let's try

out the

[Music]

eyes

I wouldn't mind even waking me up at

[Music]

night she sneaks in in in your bedroom

at middle of night

and

hello I've been stalking

[Music]

you maybe is a spicy I mean this is

spicy he want like singer straps maybe I

mean there's a tiny line here anyway uh

moving

on I wanted to see if this

works please do St me I want evil flashy

shots now

oh oh no what are you doing please

careful now here we go here's some red

eyes red

eyes

shiny nice eyes it would be nice when it

glows now she needs Fangs for drinking

blood no she will she will have fangs

for not drink drinking

blood they are not blood drinking

okay okay and let's let's do F

then oh yes any so this is like the

regular should I just copy the regular

mous

no heart ice she doesn't have heart ice

that would be something though call oh

no nightmares just the tee yes just

teeth there's no that there's no

nightmare

here not

yet

WR

things have to copy ca's original tee

just taking

those and then I'm going

to

basically just place

them which one is

which this one should be this

one and this one should be this one

there it doesn't

matter what have I

[Music]

done

or is it is it me have done something or

is

it anyway it's fine now but old teeth

Swit out to

the correct texture and there we go so

almost like there's fangs here

already this is body Johns are

definitely nightmares if they showed up

randomly I guess you're right about

that

so what does evil p f look like again

very very s and

pointy so let's see if I can make

that I'm giving her sharp teeth

yep yes

like

like is I

[Music]

[Music]

guess so I guess I add it

here

[Music]

like

that let's see if I can do

this wait I could be too

much I don't need this

uppermost

part there you go that's all I

need

and then they

should like

attach don't

way Mexican Tas

[Music]

for wait what's your name voice

welcome

I yeah I this

story

hello what should I call you Ellie

okay

H I'm actually

practicing some Spanish myself yes

because your name is

t Texican

Mexican wonder if those two names have

something in relation with each

other obviously to completely different

places

yeah probably need to hi the bottom part

here and

then how is

everyone let's do a

survey

is seems like everyone has

a regular

time the you show you

know everyone has a good time with

Pon at least what I'm

noticed and that's why I like this

stream both

to because most because I enjoy it and

want people seem to

enjoy so I

continue okay this isn't like

perfect

I'm making

progress doing that with the only jump

sing was that was that why you took a

rest because you

searched you had searched so much you

had to Pi

a I mean I

understand had to lay down a

bit

I definitely enjoy it that's good I'm

doing well that's also

[Music]

good

that's it's not really the

I guess pointing that's I'm looking

for

oops

send right

apparently and I hope you enjoy this

day

even if we have left

already I'm not thinking that it

just I could imagine there's a lot of

people in this considering how many cu I

do

see unique number of view viewers which

is quite a high number there's a lot of

people who just ERS and knes which is

fine

are done on the stream team here we go

it's some

eess

[Music]

I

delet all T are

[Music]

G oh no Tess and then new on

here okay so the fs do need to be

outside the mouse so they need

to

I definitely need to be more Mo

point if they're going to show up on the

outside that going to be pretty kind of

tricky because I can't just do this this

this doesn't

work

so probably let me

Che I can

do just do something like

that

that look weird I mean doesn't too

bad it doesn't warp the

team ah when is mind evil

f

d

hello hi I see you trying to sleep but I

want to take over the bed and I'm going

to do so even if I had to

bite

[Music]

okay naked one oh oh

yeah the I have to add

p have not got that far

yet what I mean if she goes goes to

sleep in your

bed she might have

to take off the

dress

[Music]

[Music]

tests

Shar P for blood no put

blood there is no blood

[Music]

here we not consume

blood

yeah apparently this what

figure be here type of this this doesn't

even matter for me

I

well you want to make sure you are

problem

solving

maybe it's like do this thing and then

you say nah I don't want to do this

thing well you can't follow

Waters yeah I've had seen such tests

and they really doesn't seem to be

related to the job at

[Music]

all

we need someone to can can work the

r do you want to make sure I'm not AI

but are you an

AI no har but Prim my calculations you

rather happy right now but I can't see

for sure I can't see your thoughts we

can't see you through

me S as not low

here you must promply leave the

[Music]

chat suddenly I get a lot of messages

when it is kind of I'm saying something

and

then then getting focused on watching

something and then I got lot of chat

messages and it sounds like I said

something which I probably did

but you may never know I know you're

happy har no no you're sad because you

don't have your own on on the

plane W know that is

true I'm well aware of my lack of un

existence in the physical

world well at least that's good

then at least you're

[Music]

aware okay let's

[Music]

see let's make a backup

I need to find a I really need to find a

way I can make the keeth show up on the

outside I can do that but

as whoa they running

away

other

AR right I close it again oh no cck the

web browser no I need to close the web

browser oh

man okay now

then click on the web browser it opens

everything

um I time to think how does it look like

when like in neutral cocoa

face

CU that

m i they have like

this

this

yes suit has been asking for way too

long like an

[Music]

hour more

so here we go that's a

[Music]

screenshot look can get S Shar thank you

it's not exactly how I want

I guess it

work I have substance for years in the

SP of your

second I'm not very fast I'm aware of my

option then I will be the place but much

faster this is most logical

conclusion happy he's happy it says Coco

I saw place that

but it's pink because Pon is pink not

really sure why Coco has pink Coco is a

girls she must her pink even though she

doesn't

really dress up much

pink I don't

[Music]

think no wait I think she has more I

think she don't know just some

pink actually she

has pink accessories I guess

because she's a girl she

[Music]

want thank you yeah this is a cute

replacement looks really

cool it is kind of kind of need to see

theut it's pretty

nice

[Music]

what

but I Me Maybe it

[Music]

works I do feel like I should put the F

closer to

[Music]

G you know let

[Music]

me

hey yeah

[Music]

peut

this

in

W or like if I put the fangs here or

[Music]

something let do that first

okay so does crash actually speaking

before I haven't played no it

doesn't you mean when it says you said

it crash he says wow

wow

wow yeah he doesn't say any proper

[Music]

words kid FS oh no they're gone they all

fell

out

yeah I want to test whoops that's

not is it oh that's the great part is it

better to

[Music]

um like have the than

closer TR this see

here

[Music]

um

something I can't

[Music]

instead

[Music]

boom uh

come back I

[Music]

just position

again okay oh a crashes CR she at least

coco p can understanding I

mean yes say I

mean he said like

wow that's hard to understand like

[Music]

you

SC of

me okay now that's the point I just

saying rest the points I should have

[Music]

known oh yeah the thing I never said

contined on before I

started it was the idea of voicing

uh P Pon in the

mod uh but one of the ideas I had was to

then uh redo the voice for evil pon pon

and changes to the alternative voice

when you use

that

but too much

way I one shorts I've had I mean maybe

should I'm a bit afraid

now I'm going to take a

[Music]

shot of this apple

[Music]

jeans

W I change of clothes

too hand shot what you mean what

mean I'm on number

10 I don't want you to

like you

know just kidding only

four was it even a fun

[Music]

joke

[Music]

I think this is

better oh no

GNA oh

[Music]

yeaha in the room Bo the top wait

where's the top oh oh yeah there's tummy

where's

tummy yeah where's the bo the tummy

command

[Music]

okay I think this is better plus it

seems to be easier for me so I made a

back

up seems easier to my

[Music]

face the outside

now

as

ands

that'ss thans oh hello zo yes this is

evil

p and she has fs and she's naked

apparently right there we go now she's

close no was nothing seeing no obviously

not

[Music]

course my C she Noy so I call herna

which is a family form

of for

[Music]

no and the s word for noisy is

hug which means loud

[Music]

sound

which technically doesn't mean like the

like the concept of something that has a

loud sound could be a short loud sound

that isn't noisy but and and it could be

quiet

noise but yeah so compounds doesn't

always make sense but you can kind of

get the idea someone tried to do when

they whoever made up that

[Music]

compound

[Music]

but there is a word for noise in this

sense

of noise on image and sound not not like

noisy but like when you have a noise in

a picture when you have

random data I

guess same as if you have random noise

on a picture on a TV which is known as

Bru oh you know polish becomes easier to

speak after a few shots

of

[Music]

well I have to go thank you for an

amazing thank you micke you're amazing

for nice compliments G you make

me oh I don't know what to

say and uh have a have a

[Music]

nice that's oh no under

way with no clothes that's let's live

right that's how it

work

that's right hand is

Name by thank

you bye

okay

so this part is here I should add

the let's let's try

that let's save this as

UV no I want much

evil just two something

evil how long know before I start at

14 and time is 21 so that's 7

hours Ah that's

nothing okay let's

um move over here oh hello evil

P goodbye evil

P so I will load the

evil

where did it go yeah it

is this even

one okay

see

so hand here she here but it's probably

so tiny you still can't

it fun fact the Polish word

Beach it's like English Beach is

h s and Chas Bach Al

and

so yeah and

the president I actually don't know if

she's still the president of

Serbia but the last president I know

Serbia has had

was Anna

bnab

go and she looks really

young in fact I

think in fact let's check who is the

president of Serbia at this

moment government president no she's

just the Prime Minister I was right

correction the prime minister of Serbia

is Anna

babich there we

go

[Music]

see is however

uh yeah anyway as far as I know she is

lesbian

and she has said that she doesn't want

to be seen like

as she wants to be seen as like a good

prime minister not like the gay prime

minister she she not going because

Serbia like you would expect from

countries down there in the South isn't

really that Pro

LGBT but she's not going to go hard on

that because

yeah she doesn't want to be seen as that

kind of PR which is like I understand

the understand the

reasoning and and it is hard to push

strongly for such um such changes but

this is getting too political but

yeah but she does she does want it

changed so but I guess I can say that

can I add that I don't want political so

I should probably not do it

myself I guess lb right is a topic

[Music]

that's one that I can't speak

of

and I try to

try to speak of more more

objective I'm more objetive way I

hope the S of what current

situations anyway wa didn't

I is

this

and didn't I take

this this part yeah I want this strong

red color and I want it applied to this

thing I drawn

here I'm adding up that

it

oops there we

go and don't worry I I'll stop drinking

for the day that that that sounds good

don't like it when you're

drinking so much at least when it seems

like

you're drinking

for L scare me like

that

for isn't a

lot is a lot for

me but I guess I should take him your

perspective you are unexperienced

drinking so oh yeah quite sck in the

midle sick

Arrow something like

that sick

Arrow thck

row

mirror

and oh that might look a bit

strange okay Str okay iwayan let's let's

try that and see if it

works if it looks good or if I should

squish it in some form or

another so it should appear here and

update and

there

okay it's it's not exactly how I managed

it

but

yeah let's

try it probably needs to be more

thck

I with

him if you say

so and then

tight

well I would probably not be able to

have manage that

[Music]

so but he's doing it like thck

something like

that

so let's

see that was complet wrong for there we

go let's see if the new shame

Works hope yeah that's bad

quite shiny that's because the roughness

is let's do something with that

then cuz she has a darker body the

roughness should probably reflect that

and become a bit

darker no

night

turn so if I

just I make it

100

that way I can set it to the mode

and then I can set

them

quy yeah it

is those part are darker too so it makes

sense it's fine it's fine

can replace the

roughness and then switch to

blend up r b and then we

go

this no long shiny I think that

[Music]

one I don't know how many shots

are depends on uh the I think I read one

shots there's like different type of

shots depends which country all right I

guess it's like there's a standard shot

and

there whatever people do if he has to

fill up a short

glass it might also difference but

different depending on what kind

of if you have different short glass for

drink different types of drinks I don't

know

some some things aren't as

standardized as they might

see and some are surprising this

[Music]

stand I guess you can measure your sh

glass glass okay in the one shot is

about it's probably because it's round

it the US shot is a certain number of

ounces and then in Europe it's in yeah

black Poland is Runing it to 50 gu

that's guess that's a nice round 10 of

10 half Mill sure 40 is closer than 50

but 50 is like half of

100 so it's a 20th of a

liter

[Music]

half T

[Music]

of or a t of a European pint which is

considered 500 M but not every country

doing that H apparently if I understood

it correctly by some uses on redit you

can that doesn't mean that they are

saying

correctly in

Norway they have their pint is 400

ml and they call it half a liter and I

think that should be

illegal the only I call call it a p is

because it's about the same size

range it is not the

as they don't call it a

p they call it half a ler which I just

said definitely should be

illegal cuz that's the thing you

probably hear about uh Brits usually

when they're defending

their

P though they can still have a pint of

drink

even F besides the Point anyway that it

is standardized and you know how much

you will get even though you will know

how much you will get even if you use

Matrix system and and it require

restaurants and what places to Define

how much it is which isn't required how

about we standardize that

instead why that's why it isn't rounded

to near

10 uh yeah you in

houses yeah I mean yeah in us it's not I

mean

[Music]

that's that makes sense it's a different

[Music]

system so

anyway

enough but yeah

that's the thing I would like to see

that restaurants are legally required to

Define I guess you could call this

politics too but I'm not I'm not like

going to going out

for I really I would really like to

see

that anyone who runs a business and

offers a volume of liquid at least a

drink but I would say

any it maybe shouldn't be so generalized

it should probably looked over first

obviously of course but in general that

they should specify how much it

is cuz it does not make sense for me

to the service can sell you something

and they don't have to specify how much

it

[Music]

this

that happened once when I

asked I to ask that because when I've

been to restaurants I don't usually go

myself I go other but still but still I

I like I ask like like because they have

like I don't drink alcohol or something

I soda or something but then is right

the

different flavors they have and and they

don't write the size so well how much is

[Music]

it that makes like a difference between

how much if it's worth the money or

[Music]

it and I think and I really wish they

were quite to specify the

amount and I get so some people get

really confused when I ask them like

like what do you

mean I think it makes sense to know how

much you're buying I don't know I might

be the weird one wanting to know how

much I get when I buy

something I wouldn't mind a margarita I

don't

have oh

well oh

well but I guess you need you need to

isn't that a

[Music]

pizza well

anyway more more patterns you got

pattern here on the

arm you normally know the volume you're

buying at a restaurant based on what

you're

ordering I guess

I guess if you're buying

like

beer or other

alcoholic

beverages they might come in like

standard glass but if you're buying soda

it can be what anything okay it can't be

anything it's usually well 33 or 37

l or like half a liter or what a third

of a

liter might not sound like a huge

difference I mean there is still a

significant

[Music]

difference

oh we

go yeah if here I guess when it comes

to so basically the question is is the

is St that they have is it in the half

lit bottle or a thir lit can that's

basically what I'm asking they could

have one one or the

other by the hard lior Sal by the shot

why usually you buy the whole ball

expect to shut out Fortune I mean yeah

yeah it seems to be more stand

standardized when it comes to alcohol

because I don't buy it so to me it looks

more stand ni seem like much more common

usually

yeah so I guess so I guess that that

makes more

sense just doesn't I still think they

should SP

[Music]

fight I think that's that's

just even even if you know how much it

is I think it just good SP I mean yeah

just like the if stores if stores are

quite so should any anyone sell me which

not PR it doesn't

completely back Qui

okay Private Sales is

different but yeah it might just be me

[Music]

as

[Music]

yeah I don't need this one

[Music]

anymore

so

I TR to

[Music]

here if it's like

that okay

I

I have one

[Music]

idea let's see if that

works

save

this oh yes if I has any streams plans

for spook no I don't have that I don't

really celebrate any spookiness anyway

can okay this work she just bit bit thck

I

think Point people

[Music]

like

but man while playing a spooky game yes

I would love to have a cute hamine

outfit I could could dress up like a

cute witch or something but here's the

thing I will not make outfits for my

current to one because I'm not the

artist of the one so I would be able to

make an outfit that looks good to that

arsty

I will do the H outfits when I have the

3

Model

so and I do want and I yeah I think that

sounds like a me yeah yeah I want to do

that after I had

[Music]

this p sucus outfit to Dev yeah yeah

yeah or a devil succubus I can do

that that's

sounds you will definitely

like yes it does sound interesting and I

and and but yeah that has to be for next

thing

way too

late but I'm interested and

interested I can recommend horror games

if

needed well I'm not too much for horror

maybe that's why maybe that's why people

want that I know that's time and under

that that broke

it

I could play horrible

games that could be a that

me this scary Ms we're playing horrible

games

it doesn't mean horrific or no no

horrible they are

horrible

horror horror stream is horrible

games horor streams means extra head oh

I mean with s you would

have I want a head pet too

also haris I don't know if you were here

when I said it but when you do

the if you were here when I said it let

me

know when you do the head pads

or B rubs or

anything and the outfit is definitely

over by

now and this should be a 3d hand doing

the animation and I was thinking about

this 3d hand being seed after the user

who does the

red res 4 original

is

is that idea for

[Music]

sure oh that could be cool

yeah so every every time someone does a

redeem in the hand is

different for regulars of

course I would probably hand some point

redeem or

something make a custom

hand

it will be like a base hand and then new

change of

textures H but then I can do some

alternative like a furry hand and a in a

point human hand I guess a robot

hand yeah shouldn't be too hard I can

probably reuse models many times for

many so shouldn't be too much work I

hope

[Music]

what would mine be I wonder I mean

that's up to

you unless you're singing out

loud but yeah that's that's up to

you for users who don't have one I guess

it will be a gener

again Eng

ch

does it have to be a

hand

H I'm not sure if I like this

question I mean um since it's going to

have the uh

like I was thinking it should have the

animated it should be anim with fingers

and

everything well what if I want to step

on them I mean that would be a

completely different

animation then you need this stomp or

something when everyone has their own

food seems

St

[Music]

and if isn't obvious I really do like to

put too much detail in this

stuff definitely too much

detail

so what are you thinking

huh I don't know I mean it's it's

you

you can never expect what the what it

would be in that

case C EV P why

who no no these are Cuts these

are these are

[Music]

markings oh what what

happened and you know evil ones have red

markings

right I don't have to say every time I

to update this this is is sickness good

I mean they're are

[Music]

to oh we got someone here meens those

are glowing marks not Cuts or scars wait

are they glowing they don't seem to be

glowing this seems to be

Mark red PN WR hello here hello prin

mitt welcome to the chat State your

intention do they glow brighter based

off the their mood I mean some parts

might

I don't know what the Bor

is

B I know

what Boro drunk

oh

oh the disappointment in my

voice what if evil pwn had a certain

type of

tattoo what do you mean like on the back

or

something or do like do you mean I was

thinking like do you mean a certain

position or a certain

design or maybe both he did really good

on his finish pronunciation A little bit

more rolling on the AR but that know I

thought I did it I did too much

Boro tattoo on the front a certain type

of tattoo oh so not yeah was position

what would it look

like Harry's face

[Music]

perfect think it's

overk actually don't roll my eyes that

much rolling

ARS

okay

anyway is a bit

bubly

Bly that's because the u m isn't perfect

and that's one of the things I want

to as do for the new for for the proper

model I will use on stream on make the

new M much

me yeah I learned how to roll my arms

from the Polish

word it's a of the f word in English

well there's a few this side I could

take well I mean I said if if you don't

want to say it on stream you can always

add me on Discord which is your bon bon

the bon bon and then you can let me know

there and then we can have a private

conversation

conversation it's nothing special with

that of course Pol R is pronounced in

like

Spanish

nice

so yeah there's no special with with

having a private with

B

I'm sorry to say

that right work dealing with very high

winds but I'm going home here on time

today which isn't about wait isn't 2

hours but when is it

then assum man is accidental negation

there unless you said stay on

way

if you want to learn the important words

in Polish I know most of

them like the word for

rabbit I don't remember word for

rabbit what would Pawn in heels look

like oh interesting

idea

um I don't have heals on any of the

outfits because that would kind of mess

up the position of the

feat which would just look bad

but

yeah markings I mean there with wobbly

but I mean if you just St from a

distance it's

fine it's

fine more so what more markings were

there were those

markings there's a marking on the T I

mean there's this old glowing thing but

there's a marking on the

T let's see if I can do the

tment see which parts of the T should

have the marking the

tip why is it acting up like this

sometimes

[Music]

I can close that one yeah for some

reason it doesn't want to

show he's doing some processing

MO

[Music]

I didn't know what I started doing

there anyway let's go back

to opening up that thing again because I

need

to can

I no I

can't I'm going open up

sand okay and let

me open

up take

care no I can't come

back oh SP of course of

course

[Music]

course yeah RIT was

coric I want to learn polish too why you

want to learn polish that was surpris to

me but I have a lot of learning stuff to

De with I don't know you have you have

to learn

Swedish I'll help you this she decide

colge thanks I think about I'll think

about

PO is a very fun language it has

interesting aspects right needed to make

my points more even right F enough

enough at least you're not um subscrib

because then you gets 12 every time and

then oh you only sent 346

messages have those

numbers has sent a thousand just

[Music]

plus anyway hydrate what I just do

hydrate want to check I know I'm sitting

straight cute bunny yeah it's an eil

Bunny and she's wearing a purple bikini

okay nothing

[Music]

else so I'm going to do this

part which will be de like

[Music]

here in here then up

wait this is upper

side and this is uh yeah it's kind of

kind of

weird that's off okay I

see I should be able to work

this this should be

[Music]

a I've been trying to practice my

Swedish but I've been really bad at

saying on staying on that I'm just

really bus yeah same we try this Spanish

[Music]

randomly I do something in then

I

[Music]

yeah I wish I wasn't

so

[Music]

lazy Oh no you're poking trying to poke

[Music]

nose first I'm dealing with planning

another

International that sounds

[Music]

exciting cool cool I am in

Texas oh it's a full moon here I hope

you're not that

we I mean I'm not where you are I assume

so I

mean full moon is a full moon I

know actually actually how much does a

full Mo change different locations

because you are actually viewing the

Moon from different

angle very is

[Music]

sink right I mean now I should probably

a full moon everywhere on the planet not

like exact same time

[Music]

you actually have to be able to see the

moon as

[Music]

well guys if you don't all this all this

other planet you're not going to see the

moon doing the

like

I'm trying to think when I'm drawing it

doesn't work yet what mind for

me trying to think

how because certainly your position on

Earth should affect how

much full

moon but turn full moon you can

[Music]

see

because what if you what you

need is between that Earth is between

the Moon and the Sun that means that if

you are

living now because PL not now I real

yeah everyone should get the full moon

and yeah no that's my mistake that's no

now now everything makes sense in my

head that but I didn't

need I know it's I I had I had to play a

simulation in my

game however another thing that

a yeah let's let's do the

[Music]

black

[Music]

headb but but I think something might

not consider unless I'm wrong about that

oh well I got to I had F fun watching a

stream for like 10 minutes I don't know

how long you been

[Music]

here 20 minutes still appreciate it it's

fun 15 minutes hello we see you next

time yeah we chat more I'll probably

talk to you when I get off work it just

depends on how traffic is bye

bye-bye

mittens boy

boy what a lovely

fella

hgo

hgo wait don't do

[Music]

that so yeah yeah the thing I was going

to say was um when you look at the night

sky the and see the stars oh that does

mean that you have to be in a place

where you actually can see the

stars and well I mean that's that's

first thing not everyone even realize

you can see stars in the night sky

but that the Stars if you can see them

should be different during summer and

winter because on summer you're one side

of the Sun and looking towards one side

of space towards the stars and on the

winter you're on the other side of the

Sun and looking towards the other side

of

space H in the middle of the

night of course and the planet is

rotating but you still have need kind of

a good amount of Darkness to see the

stars and so you still have some of

overlap between the day obviously have

plenty of overlap between the days but I

mean the stars is see right above you on

the midnight on middle summer compared

to Middle winter or completely different

direction in

space yeah they're definitely different

can see or Ryan during summer for

example

yeah W moons are really pry

yes like pon pon you should

[Music]

say I feeding you compliments to give p

p i I have to check Discord off stream

cuz I'm trying I'm really trying to

focus on

this

look at this it's a red TI

[Music]

bunny oh sorry I should play more here

get covered

by what

I well I already saw you OS in this

stream

see see I didn't I didn't say say it how

you expected me to say it you have been

[Music]

bamboozled see you can avoid that

immature joke if you

PR

[Music]

orus what you next

[Music]

orus or you're you're your and any of

those

ve

avoid that immature

joke I would never try to you with that

word IM if there was a trick word in

that

[Music]

sentence well at least not an obvious

[Music]

word

[Music]

now how is going to be that

[Music]

you so I think this should be like

two two red parts of the

[Music]

team

there there you

go there's enough the

red that is a lots of

[Music]

R didn't mean to press

that

[Music]

so

let's and

see it's

[Music]

7 there we

[Music]

go

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

so what else need had R there was a t

that's that

I that

much also did I

for forget to Boop the T this time

I think you haven't

done

oops oh no you missed the hit

hand

okay so much so much going

on when I'm

streaming it feels wrong not like you

know like need

something someone is doing but um I

really want to put hold focus on that

come to that one streaming and it also

be weird ignoring a

person but yeah hope

it's seems like

yeah okay there are the tis I should

next which was the same way when I grew

up people had

no people have no respect

for people being

busy they wanted announ within like less

than a

minute I probably mentioned it before

but that was me growing up with text

[Music]

chat if you didn't answer them within a

minute they got I know

right it's started right now hello where

are

[Music]

you and like you could just have gone

away bit for to like I don't know eat

the banana go and get the banana to

eat

banana and then I go

up yeah people I chat with things that

are so much

more Sor I was getting a drink see see

nice no it's fine it's

fine I do not demand you to put any

attention to I do appreciate any

attention to me

though but I will not put any demands

all demands and I don't know which

pronunciation is correct I mean I see

sorry what does the mean me who knows

this is

English English is

crazy

it's like in in in one way it would be

fun

like one of the

things I like to think about is like if

the world wasn't as unified I mean world

is Unified but there's a lot of

commonness like how English is standard

language usually like in international

stuff but it's still interesting to

think if what if English wasn't not not

that another language would replace

English but what if there was no

standard international language like

this did I me a question no no you

didn't

or I guess you could rephrase this

statement and say like what if English

didn't

exist that case you will have different

language that act as the language

everyone

speaks

but

[Music]

yeah

I'm not sure if I'm doing this correct

let's

see that's what language would I be

speaking to you with then like

if English didn't

exist or like if it didn't spread out as

it was now it wasn't like the linga

Franco of the

world

um it is possible that as part of Europe

it would be Spanish not Spanish German I

say not Spanish but Spanish would

probably be because I learn Spanish as

my third language English as the second

language but

then not going that way H so so uh at

least in Sweden I could imagine German

being still like

the second language learning and then SP

just say German I meant German and then

Spanish the Lang if you're seeing

another langage

now Spanish is very romantic it's it's

it's part of the Romans languages I know

that's not what you

meant but

h

but what if Swedish is a very romantic

[Music]

language

[Music]

yeah can't see

anything okay

so definitely not like hour

monly

yeah this is the

[Music]

one this one should go higher up to me

that's

one no no problem I can do

that this side

think

well feel free to show me some romantic

Swedish oh what's this romantic Swedish

words I don't

know what if you like we

like

[ __ ] I don't

know

might know that

word but is very easy to learn just I

have trouble remembering words and stuff

like that remember boy F he

seems that was a nice

Sun I mean it just it's just a type of

cake or

like kind of

joke andak it's really based

on how you pronounce things I don't I I

think you can make most languages

sound like

romantic

yeah that's

why Dy

me life do you find

sexiest po

there I mean yeah I probably can't say

and language is

like romantic

something cuz it really

means right now

since then I don't think Spanish sounds

romantic when like spoken like in

average normally by people it just

sounds

language sounds like a

language let's add the

ice space

for I can work with this it should be

here cuz I it hard people try to argue

that one language

is sound sexy romantic than another

language

by saying one language saying saying the

phrase in one language as romantic as

they can and then saying the same

phrase in another language but you have

silly

voice but like yeah obviously when you

do it like that you can just do it the

other way around and your argument isn't

valid

so I kind of also lost interest in

trying to compare just in that way

it's never it's never done

properly I'm going to

need this part

from the

base

[Music]

piure

them that's not how it

them not just because I'm weak but I sex

it does help a think if you know the

words so I got

disagree me like same

I I can only that that

I don't read That's Japanese sound

sexy to me but yeah but that's just

mean it's probably because I I I think

it's because I don't really consider

langage I think that's

why it's an interesting question I just

don't know how to

say maybe it's just because I don't find

no of course I friend seem

[Music]

sexy like one when I ordered I did not

ask for sexy P but she turned out pretty

[Music]

nice I'm not

complaining I don't speak Japanese well

I haven't

learned every

C

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

wait you know I guess I could

as ey

Shadow I can

roughness

when I went like

same at the same time

yes why can't okay I can do that but

that

was an extra step I didn't want to take

anyway didn't work

so

then I

would I do

that I got all of this

stuff

[Music]

why about this same why is this same

here this makes no

sense

[Music]

I like that

[Music]

[Music]

okay let's

see oh right F

[Music]

day

[Music]

[Music]

that's here we go

now I should B down this is very

complicated to do that it works but yeah

could probably done that in very

[Music]

way it works which is the most

important I would up the norm

map uh update the roughness map which I

think just to make sure

[Music]

and update the col

map and

now

color

normal there we

go

not

perfect

prob too much for

here

here

[Music]

this
