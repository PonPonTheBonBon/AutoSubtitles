let's play another
game which also contains
some themes
of let me just double check oh it's
actually quite
much later game compared to a lot of
other
games this has not been a good week so
far I'm
missed I'm doing terrible in every
single game I play
come watch pun pun struggle with every
single
game produced by Namco select
language
English CL
works I say 1987 but I guess that's the
original game rele
Che no
controls
controls I think training has
explanation I think it
was I think this game was released
actually he cloa let's play some some
beach volleyball
today oops I forgot to say that we are
going to play beach volleyball with a
Twist well for the first off um this is
not a beach so it's quite a Twist I
would say this is
some this is Garden volleyball we don't
always play on a beach for started
well yeah it was one of the first thing
I noticed okay then let me introduce you
to the room yeah that sounds like a good
idea well should we call it beach
volleyball in that case it's a match of
two against two return the ball to the
other side of the net without dropping
it if your opponent drops the ball you
win a point repeat this to be the first
team to win enough points to win the
game but then you have to win enough
game to win the do you understand you
think it's easy no you don't why don't
you watch a real bigball
match okay play the game for me I don't
need to play
it what did you think do you get the
idea in trny your team is on the left of
the screen wait only in trainy your
point is on right is it's going to
change or are you saying that well if
you play one versus one in that like two
playay mode press the Xbox to receive
an nice Xbox cross button and square
button to pass the ball over the ne in
Beach Vol you take turns hitting the
ball two times and then pass it over
net think you can pass it over
earlier but you can only pass
it
because I think you can guard ball and
such good teamwork is the key let's
watch The
Mach
again he play to the he the B
pass the net on the third touch pay
attention to because I'm going to teach
you some Basics
about let's practice
serving let's practice
serving feel bit
repetitive a service where you have to
hit the wall to the other team at the
start of a point the other team's area
is to the right of the net and inside
the white lines all that part I very OB
if you can't serve you want be able to
play a match oh I can't serve I guess
I'll just go
home this is the first step of the match
well as far as yeah that makes sense
listen carefully as explain what you
have to
do
are he complain of interacting comments
after like press the square button to
throw the ball into the air
okay press the square button when the
ball is
hi
did you see that yes I did that wasn't
looking away that is a serve if your
time is wrong you will end up filing and
look silly oh no I don't want to look
silly let's give it a go seres three
times to clear his challenge Miss five
times to
fail okay apparently can't press it
like that
SP
W she kind of wait for it
[Music]
to
yeah somewhere after this is PE or
something well done great job the square
button can also be used to hit the ball
over the net well you told me that
before I
mean there was
one
I haven't forgot that I guess thank you
for reminder don't forget it and like
pretending that you didn't tell me
before see if I did forget it I wouldn't
like look like a fool wouldn't that make
me
silly don't forget that the square
button we hit the B what your
wait are you saying the same thing
again let's practice something new okay
moving on to something else all of a
sudden let's try aiming the
ball when you serve you should aim for a
place far away from the players of the
other
team can get behind that place the
directional button while serving to add
the direction to your
serve for example if you press up on
directional
button
did you see that again I did not look
away you can hit the ball on the into
the other side of the court in the
upward Direction I don't think
that's okay I guess that's upward I mean
upward isn't i s
but that's up court is away from the
camera okay up down left right and
diagonal corresponds to areas of the
other side of the
court I'm coming here boing this s if
you press top right the ball will land
in top right of your opponent's Court I
mean that's Mak sense if you press down
oneing the ball will travel
downwards yeah down Court towards the
camera I mean it's not I mean it's
always going to travel down that's kind
of
like the middle don't press any
directional buttons time to practice hit
the circle on your opponent's side of
the Court using a serve hit the circle
Mark three times to clear Miss five
times to fail the
challenge wait three times but now it
say five
times okay one after
three
okay so I'm I can move like
that but after I move I can aim I
see I
see look I did it I did it three
times but apparently I had to do it five
times even game's lying to me oh sport
F the the remaining two time was just in
the middle anyway it
is did accidentally set it for and just
defaulted in the middle okay don't
forget what I've Tau you I will forget
about it the sports is very appropriate
for
this they children they can't count
apparently do three times hold up a hand
of five
fingers I they don't have fingers next
we're going to practice receiving okay
someone is filling up the S
way let's receive the ball oh he's
holding it I guess that's
done let me the opponent is going to
hold the ball randomly when the practice
starts in beach volleyball do you have
to say in
this every time if you drop the ball on
your half of the Court your win the
point you already said that you need to
stop the ball falling in your half when
your opponent serves I mean that was so
Cas this is called to
receive so yet M didn't I mean it worked
I mean I didn't work if that makes sense
I was playing it for an hour and I did
so
terrible you can you can watch back on
the B if you
want I was string so
much in this practice challenge you have
to receive STS from the other team to
receive press this the cross button need
this cross right what this obvious might
not to be St for everyone I mean yeah I
mean it
doesn't I mean it's it's fair to at
least say something one time to many
than one time to
Fe but I do feel like they could I don't
know clean up the t a bit there's a lot
of
TT organize it a bit
more well we get to
watch CL volleyball yeah
sadly you're not going to even though
it's beach volleyball you're not going
to see any of them wearing swim suits
that would be
something make make a remake of this
game yeah to playing here
yes thank you for the is this was that
Going
Quiet was that just
me but thank you for the
follow
finish
toi
kuski wait give me
Prett
H oh that's not I said
H
H
KUSI
see much effort in Finish
CH it was louder than you he well that
was quiet I heard
it I don't know it's maybe
just I thought I changeed the game why
hasn't switch up the game c did I me
it yeah yes so this sounded quiet for
mine you
mean
what
you
yes I just speaking finish terribly
but but that's but yet bikini P Pon yeah
I do want to make a bikini P but I want
like a tankini or like
a and then like a
more cute bikini and then like
the the the other the style of bikini I
made for the
mod uh hello prin
mittens hi hi hi hi uh when the play the
position where the bone is about to fall
will receive the bone the ball will fall
on the point
marked yes press the appropriate
directional button and the x button to
aim for the X wait which in what sense
do you mean the
appropriate did you understand that no I
didn't actually I didn't understand that
what do you mean by appropriate
Direction the X was on the left of that
play as you had to press the left
directional button okay now you explain
it okay now I now I understand it wait
how do I
aim if you can't reach St press the
explosion early so you character dies
for the B if you don't press any
directional button which the x button
your character might miss the B let me
show you a good trick
wait okay wa you're not going a good
trick now just going to do the practice
receive five times successfully the
clear challenge means five times to R
what I mean retry previous time you said
fail I'm criticizing the game I know
it's okay POS sh but that's just me x
marks the
spot after of all know fin I have heard
you speak finish pretty well well thank
you so
much and now I should Flex
my
eion
anyway so you control both
characters and you have to press be on
that he that was a mean
FY yeah this is going to be it no you
don't have to explain
again I mean I gu that it just said the
timing very very
very okay you had to press you had to
press very
early it's not it's not a timing thing
just you have to
just you have to go you have to go very
very
early thank you for wait I need to
receive the last
one thank you following Lily
three where are all these followers
coming from I appreciate
it no
need pre to sh only if you want
to no pressure no
pressure we just here to have fun in me
City
that's that's what we
do and that's great now don't forget
what you've just practiced we'll see
about that the cross button can also be
used to pass the ball to your
teammate don't forget that the cross
button is used to receive the ball or
pass it to your
teammate T again
again basically okay here's a sum up I
can accept that the square button is for
attacking and the cross button is for
re no let PR
attack set up on attack okay no going
the amount of time you said what thebe
button does is
amazing eny first of one you to receive
the B that means press the A cross
button and need
more
now let's try passing the receip ball to
your
teammate this is called
a to perform a Tas press the X Box and
use Direction button to add right so you
can choose where to put
it cor of
the affected by the net CU you'll be
able to set up better attack plus about
to the net by pressing cross button as
right or top right and bottom
left random the Arabic word for Finland
is a
fin once you perform that c hit the ball
into your opponent's half of the Court
this is called an
attack way and that ball was gun forever
the attack press the square button when
you close to the
board which I probably heard four times
now but if you hit the board when it is
high up in the air you can perform a
strong attack Remember the Time me to
perform a fantastic
shot wait the time remember the
time the near to the net you are the EAS
to perform a strong attack that's why
you should as send the tses as close to
the net as possible
there's also only one written vowel in
that world you got to fill in the
unwritten vowels
yourself I'll back to get
CLE I will be back but to clean and then
I will cook today yes this sounds
good keep a nice clean
house you can use the directional butons
to direct the ball win the point try to
send the ball to an area Out Of Reach of
your opponent
those two single opponent if the other
team drops the ball in the air within
the white lines they win the point if
you attack balls outside the border of
the opponent half they will win the
point receive to attack receive the ball
pass and to to your
opponent receive toss
up and this is the Bas of flow we be b
ball match not even played on the beach
remember touching the ball the ACT
player has a nice blue ring at his feet
he
sweet press the cross cross stand Square
buttons give mind what watch the game
wait watch the
game let's try order is yeah CR CR what
got succeed in attacking three times to
clear Miss five times to retry like they
changed the mind of how they wanted to
phrase this
stuff and then like
that okay there are lots going on
here
is
who I didn't mean send it all the way
there up
there
okay getting
theang nice
nice wow that's great use the technique
to become the champion let's go through
the rul of beach volleball again no no
we have gone through it like five times
already once the B enters your half of
the use after the three touches return B
to your opponent hit in the ball four
times is against the use and call the
forhead the same player must not touch
the ball twice in a row this is against
the r and re not for that super not for
super attacks this is where you can show
the other teams who's the best the Super
Attack
P rules he has going over the rules like
many times now he just loves to repeat
the rules let's go last practice
challenge one new technique is super
attacks you hit a Super Attack you need
to pay attention to the square panel at
the top of the
screen Super Attack you need to store
points in this panel your panel is on
the left your opponents is on the right
if your team wins the point the panel
area corresponding to where the ball
fell with will lighten light up get a
vertical horizontal or diagonal line for
a chance to hit a Super Attack why don't
they put these rules into the Olympic
Games if the ball drops into the bottom
right of your court the bottom right P
will light
up wa two points
where I come from we don't need
rules the bottom right panel is lit up
when the ball fell into the
corresponding area let's try and
recreate what we just watched Su
successfully attack bottom right of the
auto heart to make a line press cross
cross them Square
buttons okay now it's now it's a real
challeng here
oh no there we go I like to but it
worked okay now you got the H line let's
try and hit a Super Attack to hit a
Super Attack press the circle button
once you've got a straight line it's a
it's a bit like a normal attack to press
cross crossing Circle buttons here's an
example and they put another different
line for some reason
okay I don't think they can add that to
the olym games
though rules we don't need no stinging
rules fun languages are full
of I see what you meant there F
languages are full of
rules
yeah super attacks are stronger than
normal attacks okay
and I guess that was strong in attack
hello you you score a lot of points in
one girl the more lines you have the
more points you can
get you can win a maximum of nine points
using a Super
Attack wait
how cuz you get I was thinking like you
get two points for one line I was
thinking
oh oh wait wait I see a vertical line
two points you can get six points and
then if you get because you can get
three
three uh vertical lines and then get
three horizontal lines that gives you
additional six points and get to two
diagonals that is additional two points
for a total of
N I don't know how you get
nine
pretty sure summoning a tornadoes in a
beach volleyball match is against the
rules n no no one can do
it is there any
sport human sport that says that
summoning a tornado is
illegal no one's
try so if you all of your panels would
disappear let's give it a go it's a bit
like a normal attack okay okay make one
successful Super Attack to clear at
least five times to
try I'm strike in the
face oh
no this
please go
in just slowly as drops down
there
lands congratulations nice work you can
now work towards becoming a Super
player in a real match use the Super
Attack to win to defend the Super Attack
press the directional button and repeat
to press the cross
button why which direction we have now
completed train no no which direction
now some useful technique let me teach
you some attack wait you were said we
were
done um let me teach you some attack
techniques hit the ball when it is at
its highest hit extra strong serves and
attacks yeah I'm just bad that I'm
sorry
strong shots will leave a pass don't
forget the timing for hitting a strong
shot when the ball from your opponent is
slow take that chance to win the point
you can use the square button to
directly return the ball over to
that well okay turn this other gr area
but I'm definitely sure killing the
opponent in a beach match against R
maybe and maybe a
crime I think I read the through the uh
Swedish rules for uh iaki and I don't
think the rules explicitly that it's
that killing someone is illegal or like
against the
rule
however National laws still applies so
if you do attempted murder even in a
game of Vice you're still going to be
charged for attempted
murder so that was a direct attack once
you get the hang of this you'll be able
to beat any enemy if your opponent hits
a slow floating ball use the square
button to send the ball attack
back make sure you don't give your
opponent the upper hand by he can slow
FL the ball which I've done every day
first class players have to be very good
at defense as well as
attack now we are going to practice
defending against an
attack but you said practice was
over if your opponent hits an attack you
should receive the ball but if you jump
near the net you may be able to directly
hit the ball over the net this is called
a block there so much T so much
TT
that wasn't even close to be unblocked
but okay this is a difficult technique
but once you got the hang of it you'll
be very useful use the square button as
you would an attack press the square
button when you're near the net your
oppon is likely to
attack this all these is draining more
mode aim by pressing the SC Buton at the
same time as your opponent just
like it looks like to be blocked you can
use the following technique if you
attack and you think that your opponent
May block your shot use a directional
button to hit the ball into the
direction of your
court the ball will not be blocked and
will fall near your opponent's side of
the
net W too much stuff going on
here go
go that's you me like a close ball
instead of a far ball this call a f the
player press the left Direction
about
okay wa shouldn't have be left down no
wait what's going
on I might a comp here shouldn't that be
left down not just
left or does the game change what left
us
because the opponent was standing close
to the
N use techniques come up with your
ultimate FL signs use these techniques
on the court oh really if you get stuck
well in a match you can complete the
training mode no work hard and you be
Champion that was quite some
overtime
woo okay let do Championship
mode not don't play Swedish Hockey in
jurisdiction in which murder legal where
is
that where would you
find normal
mode one
playing one one player yeah that that's
how you hold the controller is this okay
yes this is very much okay who should I
play as
cloa
L
po
yoka
leorina
heart heart
MO is a
heart
people ah
H off an hour yes international waters I
guess that's true how would you play Ice
h on International water on a flying and
Country F or any country it's
home I see then they have like a
difficulty
value or like a difficulty value like
this this character requ a lot
technique let's pick that
that because I said
so but very bad attack
so very love
SP let's mix things up
let's play CL because it's
cloner level one I don't know how this
work I should probably start on low
level I am let's do that I don't think

[Music]
pressur at the same time it just feel
like pressing later should have the ball
further
down allowing you
to yeah
[Music]
there that wasn't even a try attemp to
stop it but
yes I guess the goal is to UNL all
characters then I completed the
game
okay
yeah
finally I got it got it to
work well I rescu
it
okay trying to
press and trying to aim just straight
down like that
I need to attack
ear I'm not getting the
timing like that but then I didn't get
it to
be
so wait up Hello
Panda hope you had a good sleep
wakes up Falls as sleep okay if that's
this
okay oh nice I got
it slowly slowly get the H not I can as
just
see
I actually need to be B if I'm going
toat this
opponent like that there we
go there an old game from n6 called
Chief
makers not familiar with the it's a
platform game with possible
element why don't
I
spinning let going thr the P side and
punishing the
others that's that's an out right I
think did it maybe
dad that one game
wasn't didn't go that well
but wait I'm
sure visual
well that might be an actual
rule in the core finally defeated the
first
one let's get going going to do best do
my wait why is why is that character's
legs floating why do everyone have
floating legs I don't remember that
being thing in this
[Music]
world
[Music]
oops
okay I really need to F out the
[Music]
timing okay the opponent is not
even there we
go is
[Music]
cheating mean ship makers you PL a
female robot who has to rescue this
professor who who cre this
her there we go
that's
[Music]
okay okay
and here we
go and the reason you had to rescue him
is heed
nice gring the robot character so he
throws him out of their a thingy and
then she has to go find him okay
that's
interesting such
mischief
okay
okay they just need to basic play as
normal even if they try to do
[Music]
that
one riding on a c ring
[Music]
a
well guess some
people I'm probably not the person
who
like I can see how some people would
find
that
interesting probably not the right
person for
that the cat is here the about
and I'm doing such a b moment okay got
here
ouch the timing
so
specific
yes please go
in standing on the
but thank
[Music]
you well that was a
loss let's try again
[Music]
in too too late
the tut was in
quick I
think I need to test
that oops I missed the
B that's a h I
see
okay
I mean the was incorrect about
yeah the tutor gave incorrect
instructions I have probably played with
the incorrect the incorrect instructions
for a bit and because
um it said that you should press the
direction of the ball and press the PO
button that's not actually what you're
supposed to
do
going the wrong
way
okay
no that's how it goes when we try to
follow the
instruction okay I need to actually be
good at
[Music]
thisit
even
earlier wa that wasn't the place I
wanted to
go
that that
wasn't okay that was too
early then we going get the timing right
right on this
thing
okay that was that was the correct
timing there we go that's s
[Music]
d
no there's a PA up
screen n too
[Music]
late not sure what the exact point of
the uh effect is because if the ball
lands on the ground you lose lose anyway
so effect D doesn't affect you
next
after
after when opponent serves
[Music]
anyway it's almost like they came up
with
idea yeah this this picture
they make the opponent this or
something oh
wait
and then when when well you already lost
at that
point so what's the
point
yeah I'm waiting way too
[Music]
long there we go where a fun game if
there a way to play it well there's ways
to play it but
know
[Music]
okay so that would mean eight if I were
to use it
now okay now it means T
T
okay
okay you can't do that not from that
distance hit the ball hit the
B ah as
usual slightly slightly I don't know how
how early it was
[Music]
I think boxing gloves doesn't seem like
the best
go
okay my guess is that if it lands
between two if they completely
determine CU he comp which areas Ling
you get both
areas
oh I didn't miss that oh
my
yes what
[Music]
I'm so I really need to get the timing
done
down let's get going going to do my best
I'm going
[Music]
to I'm messing up on the
[Music]
uh
orang and aiming with the Deep trick
one this is too easy to make
movement
that ball is
[Music]
gone oh there we
go
go
okay
yes I us put it
in
okay probably
should not try
[Music]
that
[Music]
oh prob trying to control both K same
time I can't spread them
[Music]
out I'm trying I'm trying I'm
string I'm strangling a lot with games

in of
course yes
thank
[Music]
you abducted by
can
[Music]
yep
yeah they're
not
[Music]
again that
wasn't
going Str e the
aiming
you sure can jump high like when I aim
down I'm aiming
diagonal that's
[Music]
my
okay
[Music]
you
mean didn't see mean to do
that
this SM to keep try I mean this is still
a still quite the dring for me to keep
track of
everything um and is nothing much just
keep track
up I can only process some many SC at
same
time
[Music]
standing on top of
things Dy fish Vibes give me some good
vibes
here over here he giving me points at
this time
string so
much comp
this G me P
Point there's no Beast where this way up
St yeah why didn't we go there
instead I work

okay okay that's a lot of points
oh
my
I'm
now do sign
[Music]
them
the wrong
button I
here two
l
quite
early guess
not please go
okay
yes
h
B is
offen not exactly sure what the time
is
okay compete this game in that easy
peasy
winner well the computer had
enough
cration oh no a
clone I was
in and this is level two oh my imagine
level three to do
my going to do my best I'm going to win
I'm going to
win
we'll see about
that okay going
[Music]
win yeah I'm not yeah I'm so confused
about timeing this Stu
like like in the
game okay that
works
okay
when I
try just can't don't get the timing
right yeah
yeah
oh what this good
have I think I think the
[Music]
um the issue have with
[Music]
playing yeah that that's what the had
with playing video games these two days
is that
I don't know what I'm supposed to
do the game The Game's a terrible that
explaining things giving feedback and
like might too
early am I too
late I was in wrong
position that was SAR
me
and therefore I cannot
[Music]
improve that's great frustration for
me and I do want to play games I haven't
played before
just
that that I don't understand in
games
yeah come
on okay
and and and sometimes I do understand
the game and then it's find the controls
to be
[Music]
bad I don't know how I would improve the
controls of this game but I I do think
the the
way you work with a characters and aim
that be the
same
[Music]
SED side
Court
wo
when
I guess that was just far enough to not
reach go
go but you were right there oh
yeah
okay come
[Music]
on
okay
okay almost
l
huh
okay
OU all
wi winner is
it think this this is the second round
by the
way let's get going to do my best oh I
think at least I can get good I'm going
to win got through like five rounds on
the
one it wo I'll try I'll try I'll
try want to often give
up
okay
okay come
[Music]
on come
on I just missing T
up oh messing up
[Music]
that
okay
w
whoa
okay
yeah
oh
it doesn't feel like the bone goes where
I try to
aim I have a bit of a struggle
aiming
okay yeah I don't
this
okay come
on
messing up
[Music]
this
SP why is this one so quick
that's a
that oh
nice
come
on
okay okay now I didn't know what's
going
Fire
w easyy the opponents got burned
up I don't think using weapons is
allowed
in
volleyball I could be wrong about that
after many attempts I did
it
who con and Garland but without any
detection final wait final
already that wasn't the that was a third
round right not the second round let's
get going Actually I don't even keep
track of
anymore using weapons that's perfectly
fine okay okay
fine
yeah you're
[Music]
right summoning
tornado tornadoes that's not allowed
using
weapons
[Music]
yes almost fell like
it what time
[Music]
[Music]
thing look at
[Music]
[Music]
that an easy
l
no I
[Music]
[Music]
didn't I it's point
but
yeah
okay didn't go where I wanted to
[Music]
go
[Music]
go
[Music]
go simp
wow
[Music]
go okay
[Music]
go
okay same two corners on every
[Music]
time there's your
way
yeah happened very early but maybe I was
Far Away didn't didn't allow [ __ ]
[Music]
it that was that a
[Music]
b
[Music]
wa
okay oh
[Music]
okay any
conf They
isn't they're
everywhere for some reason passing
after after ball has landed on the
ground if you continue passing ball they
they push it over to the opponent side
yeah though that's not how it's supposed
to
[Music]
work
inside seriously they the computer
place like it is harder for because for
me the two characters can
of group up into each other I mean
sometimes I'm the wondering
but but the computer play has like moves
there to character depend of each
other they can move in two
different two different uh directions I
can't do that yeah and they move like
one
[Music]
I wasn't even paying attention on insect
come came and distracted
[Music]
me
okay
[Music]
[Music]
okay want it I didn't
want I didn't want man those locations
but oh
and
I
win so much pass passing the ball back
and forth back and forth and then I
lost I kind of lost the timing
[Music]
again yeah I kind of lost what the
timing was supposed to
be
okay as it would be oh this game so
stupid it's
l i sure the computer is standing like
one C in the middle and one right in
front of the net
which I would arue is not an efficient
way to stand because you're not covering
as much ground and or am I
wrong certainly you would cover more
ground if the character like if the
character in the middle stood a bit
further
[Music]
back you would cover more
ground sure the computer computer
placing the character in
m i could be
[Music]
wrong
[Music]
okay
[Music]
okay
okay
[Music]
[Music]
and and also the computer's instant
H reaction time or
[Music]
something I mean
still
like ROM
myself go go
go I got I messed that
[Music]
up
okay
[Music]
jellyfish Vibes I am trying trying I'm
[Music]
struggling
there we
[Music]
go I have four at
least okay
so can at Le Place
B big
then
like I don't know if if if if character
took B further back I would prob I don't
know I'm blaming the character standing
in wrong position it's not my fault I
lose I mean it is my fault I Lose I'm
bad the game but the
game could
him Bean
B
[Music]
look oh now we're falling you're falling
behind we're
[Music]
failing oh
okay need a fair pum pom tap OTE need a
fair pum bouncy
mode been a while since I played
volleyball yeah been a while since I
played volleyball
too m b is funing your
life silly but yeah
[Music]
very yeah they the win more than the
other game but doesn't change that bad
at this
[Music]
game I I play
volleyball
okay going out first time I see an out I
guess
W okay same
Bo
game easy peasy
winner slightly slightly
turn
I was on my school's team for three
years
oh a school volleyball team let's get
going that sounds
[Music]
[Music]
interesting
[Music]
the computer
[Music]
show oh now the comp is really rless
yep what
done comp wasn't this hard
before never played Sports in school but
I was in the March B this is the
craziest Mario sports game yeah do you
recognize these
characters hello
[Music]
Papa
[Music]
this is
crazy this I'm so
bad I was I want was in a marching B
it's not Mario volleyball it's Mar Vol
ball W your volleyball and go
[Music]
okay
okay try to
aim where the
[Music]
C what this
me
[Music]
I would like to have been in my marching
band but I can't play an
instrument to sh my knife oh I can
finally pause for some reason I couldn't
pause let's get going going to do my
[Music]
best okay okay
[Music]
okay I'm
getting so
basically so basically there was like
how long was that that tutorial 15
minutes of tutorial which gave you
incorrect information about how to play
the game I'm I'm I think
I'm understanding how to play the game
more now
no no help to do to just G me false
information
so okay s minut is a tutorial with
incorrect information there we go it was
it was correct information too there it
was also incorrect information just
information about the game just not how
the game works
I mean the most obvious was the one
where they couldn't even count to five
and call it three instead
but a lot of the technical stuffff they
provided was also in
[Music]
so
oneing
uh you do not they say that
to to catch a ball you have to move in
the direction towards the ball and press
the pass button that is
incorrect you push in the direction you
want the ball to go after you pass
it you don't put put the direction of
where the ball is relative to your
character that
they they tell me to push the but to
direction towards the ball that is not
what you
do
[Music]
okay why is the computer Ro all a sudden
what have I
done and I don't remember what more
stuff must have been some bad
transitions
[Music]
maybe yeah for some reason they
translated five to three
I copy and paste
[Music]
there wa
[Music]
look at
that I'm playing the game more
correct I'm finging stuff
out no thanks
to
go
[Music]
okay
who oh
rest and
yeah go
okay
yeah know I didn't go for that because I
just complet did WR
[Music]
thing is that where the ball is supposed
to
go I'm cheating now the
[Music]
thatting actually I they actually do
they what the instruction because I
press yeah that's what happens when you
push in the direction
of that's what happens you follow the
instructions and I need to stop
following the instructions I'm going to
no it's
just it's just
I've never because I played all the
games where you use
the movement to determine where you aim
and I never like that kind of aiming and
that's like the core of this game
[Music]
so I don't need to like every game I
don't need to at every
game and that's fine I give it a some
tries
but
yeah oh yeah I think I think this is put
the meor limit of my abilities
[Music]
here mostly controller
so
um so which is this us is the same d-pad
as the PlayStation One controller which
this game was designed
for and and the d-pad on a PlayStation
one one two three controller is
is so easy to
[Music]
like I mean it's not easy but
[Music]
but I think like I I'm not trying to hit
the diagonals but I managed to hit the
diagonal
anyway short the
kitty welcome watch me this
pain I'm struggling so
much yeah my aiming is completely
[Music]
wrong
[Music]
okay
no I didn't mean
[Music]
yeah I didn't Tred to put it there but
it was actually
good meow meow you're
welcome
okay
go
okay
[Music]
okay
[Music]
and pro uh I actually try to aim but if
you don't a it goes in the
middle but I guess I say worked out well
[Music]
anyway
yay now we celebrating me getting points
that's so sad he
said
congratulations I got the
point have to celebrate the small
victories yay another
point
[Music]
no
tring same
[Music]
right oh one right
is
[Music]
NI
not oh
okay okay I do want if like
doing instead of because as the game
uses H cross square and circle as the
and the dpad that's the only button used
in the game I was I was thinking
maybe it would be better to use
[Music]
like guess you can have
two two control mod either you control
both characters with either
stick or that you use one stick to
control both character's movements like
in this game and then use their other
stick for
[Music]
[Music]
aiming see too long to strike
it
[Music]
okay
[Music]
go
simple yeah it' be nice if they cover
the field better which attack yeah
they're terrible at
that when they coverage feel terrible on
the computer side too but
[Music]
okay mess up this I could actually
move
I almost messed it
up and I messed it
up instead of grouping the G no like one
yeah you control when they serve you
control those character but after that
you basically most of the time control
one character and other character stands
in the
middle let's get
going
which I guess I guess technically what
they meant to do is like they cover
everything from where they stand back
behind
them defitely cover half of their field
but wouldn't be more efficient to stand
in the middle of their half
just I don't know if they do I not seen
Real
Sports I'm always thinking about this
from a video game
perspective like if if you if you just
stood further back I could have got that
b but
[Music]
nope I don't know if I would have but my
chance would have been
[Music]
[Music]
higher
okay I I guess I'll have to mark this
game off as there's twoo difficult for
me to
[Music]
play too difficult for me to
play it's too for me to
play Oh not having a good
time
[Music]
ah
[Music]
go
[Music]
go and was okay of course the computer
does that this thing and land like in
the middle of everything and get four
squares in one
point I it's not reacting quick
enough
[Music]
Che
okay
[Music]
go
okay
[Music]
okay
so there actually be three hours
[Music]
already
[Music]
[Music]
let's why am I sit
wait I hit that
SP hit different
[Music]
spot
e
[Music]
spot whenever they do that i f something
tells me the hardest oh hit it hardest
computer is going to do that
[Music]
every
[Music]
I just have
a hard time hitting the ground in the
middle
here if only
someone what more
ready go
I'm not that
[Music]
someone oh way too far away and that was
a bad
pass was my
[Music]
fault
[Music]
okay
go wait that didn't put it
there
go oh
nice
yeah got
okay
okay
okay
go
now the point you g me
points I don't know if just f a pass
before I
win easy peasy
winner
I gu see make a safe state I'm not sure
if I feel
like
oh terrible terrible it was a terrible
Monday Tuesday I need to come up with a
different game to play a game that
doesn't require so much
technique maybe I'm not in the right
mindset to play Rock that's probably
probably a game for me to
play through all the easy game there are
many more
games problem is probably like the
controls of old games are like optimized
like watching
games that's right I I try I gave it a
try that's
Le fair I
hope
right thank you I like cres B yeah CR
like speaking of
CR speaking of cres Bandicoot do you
want to watch someone play Crash
[Music]
Bandicoot so
uh
P yes she is currently playing Crash
banic good insane
Trilogy and she looks like she just
started the game so let's go visit and
chair her
on and
and and she's also struggling with gam
like I been strling
games at Le
she's having more
fun be
just I mean to be honest to be honest
and I have struggled in return 5 but at
least I know what I'm doing in in turn
fire so that's actually more fun to play
so so that's the uh so I would say that
yeah but yes return fire is going to be
a better time so please come
by and I will see what the games I make
the side for on mod say maybe I
should maybe I should just play Return
fire
to say Rayman maybe I'm
tired play
Raymond take care I will try my best it
