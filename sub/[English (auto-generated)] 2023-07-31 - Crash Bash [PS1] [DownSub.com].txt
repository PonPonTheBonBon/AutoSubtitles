gonna all right where's the picture
oh there it is it's randomly showed up
to Europe
some interactive Studios Production this
is not the voice I expected for
crash bash
forward and tired fresh Bash
accompany the babies
because they uh
well let's level the diamond chair
zero 45
745 percent
um
once I done with my ballism
no
I feel this one well straight into it
no time to lose
oh
welcome everyone
Marvel
original
this third person who has not written
anything in it yet
who is perfectly fine you don't have to
oh yeah because engine is being unfair
all of a sudden
I mean I am facing up against the three
villains of which one villain for some
reason was just
put on a good team
who is still a villain it just came out
of nowhere by the way
the monkey name is
I still think it sounds like the voice
is saying rather you
but really when free from gorilla and
Kangaroo which is
combined yeah yeah they got this right
person hello I recommend
it is some crashing impression
I was Bash
[Music]
no I wanted that
no
foreign
make the game I would love if they make
this change because
you pick a character and then the game
picks the other three characters and
these characters will never change
throughout the whole Adventure so you
will always see this gorilla looking
manifest
because that's just how the game works
no it stopped working
don't do that
yes there we go
[Music]
okay it seems like as soon as you start
shooting
the location Remains the Same so I just
need to quickly find the location and
then I can just
stay there that makes sense
[Music]
I think
I haven't confirmed that
oh I'm just avoiding
of course
if the balls are bouncing and coming
from a different direction then I
don't like cortex I mean that no I work
too late
wow take it easy
no I'm missing I'm dying
[Music]
thank you
he kind of did see success of this game
he showed up in
I guess I'm not at that timeline yet
because he didn't show up until the
latest has he shown up any time before
that
starting off terribly
[Music]
all right
there we go
[Music]
now I am I mean share the first place
whatever that's called okay now I'm
actually in need
lit is that what Connie
now
and all right
this is not good okay
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
oh did you see that
look at Carla is soon after this
[Music]
I think gorilla stops having the scene
because in that case when these things
appear on the bottom side
they are more preserved for me
[Music]
[Music]
oh so close that wasn't it for a
birthday
takes it immediately
[Music]
that is okay why is the gorilla so good
at this
is
no more balls something the next one
next Warframe
what's up
[Music]
you're sending them my way
that's why I didn't have to shoot the
two so
and I moved away and left it in
oh
as I mentioned before it does take a
time before it goes across your line
something that actually counts as going
into yoga
[Music]
which
which actually is a good scene because
that way
the ball has actually gone into Gold
without doubt
come on
yes that's good good for cortex just let
them in
[Music]
let's make you think you can see the pot
yeah there we go that's what they've
gone
twice
wait
I want exactly great I think it's
because
wait which character Oh you mean yeah
especially since
become one of the good guys
pointers
um what happened you passed it and it's
just turns right back around without
hitting anything
that's the game
I didn't even notice that because I
can't really pay attention to how
important at the same time
[Music]
no stop
recording this lesson they seem to be
worse like
in the in the in come on
I'm worse too but that is besides mine
like they seem to just let balls go
straight into the cone into the diagram
and they seem to be much more aggressive
at defending themselves in the uh or at
least the original
[Music]
it takes here oh there
that wasn't supposed to happen
[Music]
again
I understand I left it in I'm so far
behind it moment
[Music]
and there we go
[Music]
come on let's team you were supposed to
be stupid
I'm scoring girls on myself
[Music]
he's using Game sharks
probably
oh I'm surprised beginner
I'm letting every single one in
the box has such a tendency to go
towards Michael
like I should beat this up with the
computer is so quick at picking them up
because there's so many bombs going
towards Michael all the time
Dash I don't have to time to like pick
them up because I need to defend it
I mean sorry you could actually left one
bar in in what's saying for the seal but
well
yeah more like that thank you
all right
anytime now
[Music]
oh
I left that money
so far I got Sophia's ass to continue
one
like cortex cups I think
I remember remember
no stop sending them my way
all right
oh sorry
[Music]
oh what's this
I was so class picking another
I look really nice so far ahead of
everyone else
100 that same
oh
no I didn't do any others have the
bunnies in that way
not that good see what I mean
disadvantage to me
now I can
[Music]
say
[Music]
I don't know
ah come on why did it bounce around so
much
since it's like when I get them they
like runs out almost immediately what is
that about sarana so much
foreign
[Music]
and let's get just I don't have to I win
by doing nothing
I'm losing but do nothing
which I don't get think would be as good
of a game series
cocoa and Lucy spending nothing yeah
nice pounds in the corner
okay stop
[Music]
yes now
what dude they turn like that when I
understand it was curving because that
person had saying the repulsive Shield
thingy but why did they
actually only push them to the right not
dogs to push them down
thing
it's another computer
now it's not the same on it of course
[Music]
I also that one was heading towards my
girl as stable
kind of scene showing up what's up Chris
oh two at the same time
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
oh
maybe when I see the monkey okay I
haven't had problem with the monkey
itself
they should make a crash Transformer and
having the monkey as an actual boss
and the boss [ __ ]
I'm just going myself
monkey angry he doesn't seem angry he's
just he's just very focused
do you like that when it shoots as soon
as it disappeared it seems to
[Music]
now let's stop doing that stop
that thank you okay let's get rid of the
Karina
all right
[Music]
I always guess that
all right held it still run there again
[Music]
two at the same time hello
he's cheating
you can't you can't think yeah no I'm
not saying today
and it's making money Super Service
because it became
exhibition
another is going to be like
he's like a circus clown I don't know
he's he's striped shorts really
he's going to play games
he's going to fool around and he's going
to
look at the way the ball moves I think
the super hits this straight up I'm
cheating yeah sometimes it bounces it
just makes no sense
foreign
is here
hello
and Chad I bet he thought he had seen
nothing I haven't seen you in a while
though
it Betsy so you can make a grand
entrance
let's see I still remember you
oops I had the ball bounced around all
the planes
Tina he got the two positive ones
I think I just let them in
oh
like at least oh I take that
oh that's like I didn't take that
like sometimes they have that
repulsive Shield
in that case it makes sense but there is
only supposed to turn like in this case
to the left sometimes there's also moved
down and like yeah
doesn't make sense to me
okay stop sending them my way
let the team there you go
left in a lot of them but so has to
complete this of course the monkey
requirement
it's a gorilla monkey or
there's another way around
well let's swim in narrow day
is of course in the leaves even if it's
just one point
oh no nothing anything
okay one more and then I'm out
and there it was it just bounced wrong
[Music]
and touched the ball but it went the
wrong direction oh foxy Roxy's Jared
welcome
foreign
s this time
than just water
okay we got a full house today yeah we
got a lot of people I'm so happy seeing
you princess anyway what's today is it
what kind of this thing
is yeah yeah we really need to work
together here
Channel your powers and if you mean see
let's see let's copy this to that
me wouldn't even without doing anything
here
hey not a single ball gone my way
obviously this one
perfect
now
I can defend myself
two came at the same
um
stop stop promising like that
nice
the monkey is of course Italy but
oh I take that wait did that more come
back no it was another one that was
added to him
he really looks good oh how is
everything
[Music]
what is
that repulsive Shield
oh come on
that's an air singing
oh
yep
yeah I'm okay this got so much use as a
kid actually The Taste is the game so
fun he's doing it early for me but I
thought I would stop anything what's up
it's really nice of eating
I'm really bad as remembering promises
so I think it would be even if he
wouldn't show up doing it
people promised me a lot of things and
and by and when they say that just as I
promised my reaction to that is oh you
think that country
you don't need to hold your promises
unless I can't remember that
that's nice wow
oh no nothing everything you know
I was right now I'm definitely losing so
much
this month is bonding to be over
I want to remember that because I have
played this before but it was a long
time ago when it didn't get far but I
want to remember
this was one of the hardest ones
and I really hope it doesn't get harder
than these sometimes games do you have
weird
if you cut the chairs so something
difficult comes in the middle or
something
[Music]
the monkey will clean calm down
I had a milk stepper piece one one of
the few few four play PS1 games
when
I mean
not counting sports games that is that's
basically every sports games is a night
playing game the PS1
[Music]
now it's my turn
hey that one is a simple shot
foreign
[Music]
Ty so much against me
and there you go
and I think every single one of them in
[Music]
right now he glitched it through the
wall that's just cheating
it went straight in front of me
oh
no
[Music]
can you come on yeah
foreign
[Music]
an option
it wouldn't be something to do a co-op
session you know
definitely easier
and it actually would incorporate too
much is two or something like that
I do still think it's a free problem but
espanol to him as you can
cooperate
thank you
uh-huh
I can't see game no I moved away from it
[Music]
nothing everything he
okay
[Music]
well I got one out of three he did
something
come on
the first thing
I have to defend myself why is this
always show up when when there's a ball
approaching me there's never something
there's a shower for them when the ball
doesn't approached him
um
[Music]
having a party today yeah
and let's even get to hear this song in
the morning if you enjoyed this song
that's a good thing it's not the
terrible song
if that's
well fantastic song but
uh let me see disappeared crash break
being so much Nostalgia a lot of things
I never keep
um
where are you from uh Sweden
wow funny dude
yeah I couldn't keep it there forever
obviously I guess more bombs without
Ryan
I guess yeah that's a good question
is
[Music]
striking
[Music]
okay
I don't know I was focused on the balls
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
uh sometimes I get closer sometimes yeah
I'm not gonna close
not a gamer naive game I meant
astronomy and then
welcome
we got disconnected I mean yes yes
um
that's it
got a Discord survey
I'm posting random stuff I was supposed
to update the sketches but this week I
haven't done that yet someone has to
remind me
I liked it but yeah and welcome you got
a new memory
uh I like it because it's a mix of Entry
piece and engine scene oh I heard I
don't even know their things
you got this from I'll I'll try in a
train again and again Adventure Time
Again
you already said I don't know
I'm happy with everyone nothing new
people
everyone Israel come on I was like that
first
um
okay sounds basic post
progress of stuff ideas for example make
this poster is my progress on the
mods for crash 4 replacing Poco with one
one and
some people when the problem is her name
my first Sona
okay
did I lose every single day
thank you
[Music]
no no that's quick enough
[Music]
this is so slow
but come on kind of bouncing us back no
[Music]
um
that's one of them
come on
I'm kidding so quick oh come on I'm not
actually prepared I wasn't ready yet
[Music]
and then instant reaction of the
computing
and yeah
while I was so close
navigation why
[Music]
I mean I could but like
that doesn't really and
no
uh
I think it is so pretty actually time
don't touch that balls in here
now oh I got it even though it looks
like computer first
I got it and this time I don't feel like
machine here but yeah it's so incredibly
short when I have it
the computer seats but it's all okay
okay
[Music]
come on
[Music]
now turn this game
yeah
often enough I used it really often
before and then it was quickly and now
I'm reducing using it less
and I am staying alive for longer I
shouldn't use it because that's
increases the speed
oh and that just for something
more to keep up with it but if you guys
do this
the balls are slower but the computer
still are really bad at stopping the
balls from going through
and certainly more to my benefit of not
using
in accepting moments when I do
that was first I never waste it
and I do it use it occasionally
[Music]
[Music]
I like that faster
[Music]
now um
foreign
[Music]
yes I did that too
well
[Music]
um
we're gonna see if that's how it's going
to change it
daily mistakes
[Music]

finally
I'll take that

foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I will eventually eventually um the luck
would be on my side
I'm so far behind the required spinning
and the game is
much harder at this point I'm not really
tried a single level this many times
[Music]
come on what kind of Bounce was that
avoid us that Shield lasts how long with
the sound effect
and that was the
technically I don't benefit from it
[Music]
yeah just just do that

the City's game is so broken
I blame them all the pizza size I found
behind my teeth what
hey you played with him long enough the
pitches
that's not how it works
of course don't miss I want to waste
good
they have starring people in the world
therefore you have to eat more
if that's there for a few months ago in
case I think she yeah they're starving
people so make sure you eat more than we
want
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
only one it was such a nice bounce
no
what's this
oh my god
well everyone is down to 14.
oh no
I never thought I had 13 but he takes
[Music]
what's with these bounces like
[Music]
but I forgot about it until it started
smelling bad and then her minutes
Mustang
well
good thing you didn't let it go to waste
anyway
how long do they keep the bloodline let
it in
sometimes they don't even care anymore
sometimes they can keep up on an iPhone
I'm being alone
until it bouncing in my door
hang out
oh I wasn't on the side 20 defend myself
how do I defend myself
[Music]
[Music]
running here scenes I'm so far behind
everyone
he's not going to do something much
um
[Music]
all right
okay I'll take that back the monkeys
back
it's very lucky again
[Music]
of course
[Music]
foreign
[Applause]
foreign
[Music]
all right
oh come on
[Music]
I can't defend because you can shoot at
at any point can shoot like three of
them
but I'm not going to risk defending
myself against one ball if it results to
me let me needs three more
anyway
[Music]
I'm not doing anything
[Music]
sometimes this game yes it's just
I didn't know
foreign
[Music]
foreign
foreign
history
[Music]
[Music]
I don't know how to say this time
I was close
it was close
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
drink it
such a
such a difficult thing
everything is not sure why it's supposed
what's your name the whole game onto
this line
[Music]
with season of ice all over again
this is just one impossible Heritage
can't defeat
I can get close but I can never defeated
and it's not only it's not only there's
just this different level because
there's a lot of games too typical
diamonds I obviously
it's just that I can do all of them is
it's just this extreme
five
the difference of difficulty is too high
[Music]
well when I'm going to pick up the thing
is
oh
[Music]
come on installing machine
is mine
how many hours of the gorillas
okay this is this is this is my
questions now
this lemon
ready to go play season five
[Music]
and this is so annoying
of course you could say that I could go
and do the other levels but that just
means I have to go back to this level I
mentioned it anyway so no something
something
I have enough foreign
[Music]
[Music]
first
then I'm going to have basic like cortex
on Amazon
sure you'll have to come back to this
level but going to other level spooky
time but I'm
but
I'm getting closer
messing up everything
[Music]
I'm not three two
I've done so much practicing on this
level and I must be yeah believe it now
thank you
I can't take the feet
[Music]
I mean sure if I come to Fitness you
haven't done I will stream now
I'm passing again
not much
which I guess would mostly came to see
it in advance I just couldn't be
defeated
technically technically I didn't spend
the whole stream on that planet at this
point
over an hour I think on the same 11 and
then I decided to not play the game
anymore
yeah so
it's the following that I should give up
on this camera
thank you
[Music]
have fancy effect
come on
beat them
I will not let this never defeat me
okay
when it froze up the level and a new
ball spawns to do it comes back
don't think of it expensive
seasonal Vines but it doesn't it's easy
we're more like the hamster
cortex took and what we did finish it I
mean at least that one felt possible
and I'm gonna guess this one that's
really possible
thank you
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
maybe it makes sense
[Music]
now
I'm so prepared if it's found in there
but it won't never came and then
eventually came
[Music]
mostly measurements how many how for
every ball bounce how many are directed
that was my goal preparing money or
directed towards the other guns
see if there's any statistics
towards them
but the immunities that every single
ball goes towards me
obviously
yeah
I guess this part is Sportsman I guess
this is what's consider it also
that I tried to bounce away from you
goes towards me
oh
[Music]
here we go nice
that just makes you seriously
[Music]
[Music]
oh it doesn't the gorilla is playing
really bad at the moment
[Music]
I mean me too I just left three more in

and I had to say it
you know obviously it wouldn't be
included
skinny DDC song

why she says first

[Music]
um
behind all the campus
I can't
oh it's funny
to knock it into my account
[Music]
on this side
and I got the license
[Music]
[Music]
there's nothing in
one life left
and they're gone
oh
I'm really trying but I've been on this
level for like one hour and 50 minutes
let's pick the whole stream
and I don't want to leave the level I'm
gonna do another level because then I
have to come back I don't want to test
I should have checked into that
I love it
[Music]
sounds like this is an impossible yeah
it's gonna be ads he's playing ads
ense
you fail
I like to say if I got defeat this level
I think they stream and I'm going to
give up on this game
I gave it like I don't know how long
lasting this one
it's just too
[Music]
[Music]
all right
the thing what I need is the shields
[Music]
this just don't have the reaction time
for computers have
been almost immediately
[Music]
pick it up in less than a second
but sometimes it's completely nauseous
that's basically the only one can we get
them or if I accidentally touch them
like that
can I get them
at least I'm competition
it's a monkey
[Music]
let's make the promising
just oh my I think so I mean it's always
been I mean
if I'm stuck in a level it's just
basically four hours a month we're not
going to continue the game
I mean let's be fair here
make sense exactly
like I said I watched this level last
three
and I'm giving it another try this too
but I've been going on at this time
almost two hours now
think that's that's plenty of time
that's amazing making some mistakes but
oh I spent it was mistake
[Music]
huh
I'll take that
oh that's amazing
and it's this bouncing
my
purchase the corner turns it gets
one piece is gone
now I want me
and I came out
but that does make these more exciting
season it's not making the right
information
[Music]
defeat me
foreign
[Music]
I should change change the title of
constraint
during being with the same challenge
for two hours
we celebrate the main part of the game
you say that when did I say that
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
disappears
[Music]
all right
perfect
send them all accordingly
gorilla has so much confidence he
doesn't really want to see him
all right the ball's face too
almost next to it
but I didn't have reaction time of a
robot
what is this gun
now
and the koala is gone
and I'm almost killed
okay
hand lines
I'm gonna strength again here and lives
and so good at stationary himself
against me
foreign
[Music]
oh yeah I was a bit late now
all of the balls all of them
uh I've been shaved quick enough
[Music]
[Music]
questions
[Music]
I don't know how
close again
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
guess I'm not too far from
me what no I was in the wrong signs
yeah let's get rid of them
foreign
[Music]
Style
[Music]
Where is the
[Music]
I haven't seen why is it working
my seat is broken it's just just let the
ball upstairs the audition is like
affecting half the
um
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
and then
that one
and another one
of them in
top editing
[Music]
all right
but that wasn't touching it
wasn't done defending myself before they
you think okay it's not even coming here
all right
[Music]
I hope everyone is alrighty
hope everyone is enjoying
foreign
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
what do you have
what do you have characters against them
[Music]
this time when it touches the corner
[Music]
drink more
foreign
[Music]
you're doing yeah
I'm getting exhausted by this
[Music]
[Music]
now it's the busy
beef
[Music]
s
[Music]
I don't have nothing everything's fine
and I'm out
three two one go
[Music]
and I let the first one in
[Music]
[Music]
first I believe really
oh you have more crazy man than I do
[Music]
[Music]
please
go over three hours you want to see me
sit here for all in turn eternity until
I defeat this
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
all right
doesn't really helped me because it
teaches balancing on all this side and
then coming back at me I'll be 36
accidents
I have inspiring
thank you
to office
if oh man
experience
[Music]
[Music]
but it's the capacity
all right
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
I know that's about dancing man again
[Music]
time
again
oh come on the spices
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
oh All That Bouncy and then I got it
anyway
of course it did
the longest bounces for a bit more
likely to explain which does make sense
because
I'm not superhuman African American I
like these computers
thank you
really good reaction time
he's a kid I just wanted to go
[Music]
that's interesting nice
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
and there you go I'm not
and you're back I still have to beat
this level are you surprise
[Music]
it's way too hard all of a sudden
even it's not working there's probably a
whole ball level off the list
[Music]
hey why does it bounce like that
I'm not even trying to defend like my
own but apparently not trying to defend
like
for me
but at least it means I didn't miss the
celebration
it's not just
I don't think I'm trying to defend
myself
come on now
don't be so sloppy
[Music]
oh
thank you
you didn't miss the celebration because
it won't be in celebration that's that's
that's fine
look at this promises it makes sense
these things are better shape maybe they
should have the bottom part outwards so
I have to find something dirty things it
goes into them never instead
wow
[Music]
[Music]
that's three of them
into my gun
twins
[Music]
from the game of
thrash Bash
anytime they have made all of them
oh my
[Music]
thank you
amazing like these shields always
appeared on the bottom too and it's uh
it doesn't really just give give the
sheets to me but that would at least
allow me always to get the shields but
would at least make it a bit more fair
yeah so plus maybe maybe the computer
shouldn't reacts to your shield and like
half the second
quick it in
you didn't mention like the reaction
time off the quickest time of a human
and then
went on that for the computer case
[Music]
and then then
[Music]
that's when I get it
came out
today this particular challenge do you
think testers play M chess
[Music]
that's the thing I get from Spider-Man
question they did test the Original
Trilogy of spider impressed thoroughly
and that's why they made multiple
changes and they were doing the levels
but when it comes comes to all of these
games it feels like they're testing the
gameplay mechanics that everything is
working as they shoot and then they just
come up with all the challenges didn't
test a single one and just stand up the
game
in many cases
like okay we made the climbing working
fresh
it is technically working that we don't
have to test anymore we shouldn't check
if the speed of it is a good speed or if
it's only if it's the speed is so
tedious
all right
about game development
[Music]
online
[Music]
but it's also that's a game that we can
developers and test shot
they know all of it all the tiny details
about mechanics
[Music]
[Music]
yeah like removing all Speedways it
wasn't a single one they didn't have to
remove them they just needed to make
them more fair
maybe don't have hard as a thing in the
first place just have the easy mode or
normal mode that was all underneath
[Music]
challenge
[Music]
they could have a hard mode but it
doesn't make it obligatory
[Music]
distract me
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
don't let them in
on um
[Music]
foreign
foreign
so many so many bones
TV pride is like the second harvest
crash today
[Music]
and I guess it's just easy from here on
it
no I didn't have that thing
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
or if you want to consider first team
racings 100
[Music]
I assume the uh
it really depends on what it counts as
what you have to complete
thank you
yesterday the final boss
[Music]
I'm trying to finish for it now crash
four is easy on me
honestly I have not spent I have not
spent four hours
on a single level impression
this is hard and best way
I really think that's fine
foreign
[Music]
watching the times in Crash voice easier
than the year students
the um
and the final times are easier in fresh
air fresh Ford than in the rest of
quartets
and crash while
um
and that's even considering cash for
even being a
poorly developed game
than using
fire controllers
well the time would change foreign
this game of all of the cash games I
played I have played crash for and I
have completed French for to almost 100
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
and then I
prefer is a long and tedious game
and and unfair
but not particularly
sure what we see when I get the game
someone has to
check this part I will not have anything
and it's quite far behind on my YouTube
uploads but I'm working
we'll see here we'll see if I
under regret what I said
[Music]
oh come on
the shield disappeared
certificate came from the time chance
for me I am when I completed all the
time trying to see the kids
[Music]
some of the events were tricky I'll give
you that but
um
the best moments I had in freshwater was
when I complete a level and I really
felt that my attempt was locked me I
didn't even think I was going to get but
no maybe not even gold maybe I feel like
I may be gold and then when I got to
find time
I defeated the developer time
so I decided you know what
I'll I'll give it another try and
actually I actually did better this time
and then I did it like 20 seconds faster
so
development I don't remember if I didn't
beat I did beat the devil to kind of two
or three of the lemons
[Music]
[Music]
you know
but so that's another change they need
to do in some crash
yeah with cash foreign
[Music]
everybody
come on
oh like they're passing it back and
forth between each other just to pass it
into my gun
they are they are working together
[Music]
I mean they are both villains
[Music]
there's only two since I did not manage
to do in fresh 4 and it's two of the
the Retro
11 scenes whatever before remember him
I did manage to complete all of them but
I have not managed to get all the boxes
that's it actually maybe
maybe
if I heard of being there or having
something like this I feel so to be fair
having
I was pissing here
[Music]
let me close here got something to
understand so maybe crash for
only because it has more levels and he's
harder because
all right
come to him
[Music]
come on I want you to move away from
okay can we get rid of the corner now
I don't know
one is gone
[Music]
foreign
Maybe
maybe
technically I have not completed so but
I will I will do that but not not what
it came Translate
not like my game any games give over 100
I kind of kind of give I'll give a pass
for the Spyro because you you do
complete and you need to completely 100
first and then you unlock a bonus area
which is a bonus for completing him 100
and it also counts that 20
then that's fine
but in crash there is nothing that
requires you to get 100
one to unlock anything so in that case I
don't like this
it's not in my opinion
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
sometimes
oh come on
but sometimes
[Music]
[Music]
at this point
oh come on the team
boys are quiet
now
yes instead of the stupid mic
[Music]
all right
[Music]
when it spins that's quickly it becomes
exactly across the resolution
before
[Music]
[Music]
outside
[Music]
just like when you play
if they're strange
those games were easy
it was actually
on
again I guess it
I guess it would be fun
an arguability should be yeah
[Music]
if you can't fall down then you can hang
this game
[Music]
nothing is
yes yes
[Music]
[Music]
this cortex dying
applying fire explosion
do you see the ball it's about going
back and forth oh well the crack crash
cortex sides and then it just turned
around and went straight for me and it's
nice knife right now after tomorrow
crazy phone
I live a bit but I'm finally I have to
work in three days that sounds good
that sounds great no that's actually
sounds good I am
to get it to interact with you more
then you can talk about your crazy
Adventures you had during all this
your busy busy time
you have been doing so well even I'm so
happy for your success
[Music]
thank you
oh oh he's gonna turn this cortex
all right he's going away
[Music]
I need more seeds
all right
kitten and
at this level I've been at since I
started this game it's the exact same
challenge exactly
[Music]
we have nothing with it
[Music]
looks of it I couldn't be fail again
because I only have one left and there
we go
[Music]
free two one go
oh I wasn't even paying attention
I can't lose focus for a single second
it's connected
and
I think I could probably have a bad
reaction time but you really need to
like kill Jackson
thank you
[Music]
now I have three of them all three
tell them
[Music]
I'm doing so terrible I think some
moment
they have so much left
[Music]
and starting off this is what I like
now it's bouncing back at me
man
because I keep forgetting that they show
up
often and I've got even even though I
was speaking about how the thing shows
up after it appears I still forgot it
while I was speaking about it
I said a bad memory
[Music]
foreign
me
no come on
you count
now
[Applause]
[Music]
now
[Music]
but
foreign
[Music]
all right
they keep bouncing back at me
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
all right
[Music]
for me
come on
[Music]
Timmy
[Music]
yeah and don't have much alcohol
[Music]
yeah
foreign
[Music]
well well
immediately
[Music]
I
said I'm bad at this game
relax
everyone
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
his friends
[Music]
[Music]
emotions
all right I defend myself
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
so much
I wish again
this is like here that I dropped in
because I'm not good at defending myself
which is my current issue
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
all right
now try to defend myself
[Music]
I'm not surprising with The Shins
and that is that I'm making everything
that means that currently it can only
come in
because it was bottom any left bottom
right that means that you came on
nothing bottom left or chocolate
and he has already gotten about 900 and
then I've lost so quickly
Jesus
Treetops isn't given a hard level
this is
like the hardest what's the level I have
a problem with me
oh
you see this
the comparing this street of this uh
this misrepresenting three cups
this is beyond Treetops
[Music]
I'm
supposed to be
huh
what the pain as I expected
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
all right all of them are turning
against me well
[Music]
one seems well I guess that's just the
statistically a country up here at the
same location and therefore of the three
main implications two-thirds of the time
it would be adjacent to the the location
was pretty still
um
Twitter is actually possible but this is
easy racing are the best of the crash
game though but yes
or Aspire again
see I'm so annoyed by this game so I
probably said that three types of the
crash line
these are obviously distance you know it
isn't
been in spicy with nothing
I mean I did that
and anything you can come up with
uh when it comes to the original Trinity
hey
um
the Sparks that I was a bit without the
regular shooting is
never never do it
foreign
[Music]
probably because I got all the
experience the first one must
be next
the second one was the
almost hardest
and of course space age is the hardest
because that's the only one I am not
comfortable yet
[Music]
not even utilizing the same state
same sticks coming over
not even doing that but
let him manage to take the camera
I'm tired I don't want to do this
anymore
I've been playing this with senior hours
now
name of that one
I guess that's the end of that game then
[Music]
I'm not going to try another stream
nothing to do
that levels with three hours
[Music]
could I do without the levels
I mean it's sure but
the answer doesn't feel satisfying to go
into another level since it's still
still not being able to get that level
of that challenge
well
I guess I technically don't have
anything to save because I don't think I
didn't make any promise never said
unlucky that's just
the game
[Music]
I don't know
the worst game ever
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
I don't know it's just
yes
[Music]
[Music]
I wouldn't be surprised if someone has
done that
there you go
to we go and visit
someone playing God of War show Jay
someone have watched a bit off not much
there are
I guess calm Clifton's very extremely
unlike me
this would be the
latest God of War
I assume that it's not only Teen Titans
anyway
I don't know that game series it doesn't
seem to be a game series for me anyway
it's it's not going to the type of game
I like to play I like to play this kind
of possible games I can't compete
that's my type of game apparently
the games that first frustrate me
I just didn't expect it to have such a
high difficulty Spike all of a sudden
all the levels took a few tries but it's
that challenge I should see if someone
has secret than anything about that
'd be fun to see
but as for now
I'll take it easy
do some stuff obviously
very sad I couldn't
couldn't even defeat it even after three
hours plus yesterday's team and it's
going to be
just another level on my list of levels
I should do that stream when I beat
those levels
defeating the impossible levels
thumbs up
