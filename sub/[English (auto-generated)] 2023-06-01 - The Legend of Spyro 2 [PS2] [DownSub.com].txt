just rabbits and peed

rabbit stamping

[Music]

cultural is disconnected

Celestial Kings

when they find Celestia no wait

wrong franchise

oh the uh Association but no one says

the people to see that

did I start to steam that late yeah

probably

welcome

I hope you have a good time and kitten

is a bit late

and I realized

on this why what's happening

I think I completed out more

yeah let's see what's going on here

did they put their tires for symmetic

symmetry or did they want like five

different powers or something

and

I didn't stand on that side hold on

hello is anyone there hey if there

expose your heart to summon ghost

then face alone what you fear most

I knew it this place wants us dead we

should have turned back while we had a

chance I need to do this Sparks

yeah go ahead it's

you have to do this more Inspire why do

you have to do this I mean you

you can fly and just die away don't mind

that

calling that just happened

that was a good time watching him he

says oh yeah

are you making it nice here

you make for my typical oh wait what's

going on you're welcome back

with and Friends

hello and welcome Cinder

hello

welcome

perfect time I just started streaming

and I'm getting

yes I'm probably going to lose against

this one

I've got to use the same technique as

last game

and it's working

[Music]

like I can't use these two to my

advantage apparently not

no eyes anything about eyes

foreign

but I am dying

on this house

how am I supposed to do that much

[Music]

yeah I'm not sure it's supposed to be

this is

and I'll just continue I will eventually

win oh

no and that's when I did that

uh

TV Camera

I can't count that like the red one

can I attack it

can I attack the yellow

and now I need more hats first

okay number healthier regeneration

wait that's my Greenback

okay I count that tactic give me one

back in just

why did the color change when I used

that one

the third piston it's come back okay the

blue one I can attack it

foreign

Nile

dude so I can't say hi you're very

welcome

yeah yeah I saw you playing that

you're playing that cry and well I think

I think you're playing that when I woke

up

been playing that quite a while now

I think I see how this works yeah

probably let's do it

don't use this

let me experiment

foreign

all right

wait is it coming back is supposed to

reset the level when he die

if it came

I

thank you

okay

um

It's Perfectly specified

then since the dragon change color too

yeah yeah this is like a stupid

didn't they test this level

that's when you died in the dream world

the crystals came except the level up

that is understandable but the healing

didn't come back

I just wanted to fill it out with

something

so you basically have to quit and redo

this and you should be able to skip

cutscene so

there you go

there we go Elemental Cindy

at least this game that I haven't built

up any kind of uh

so I was basically only doing damage for

both of the time foreign

[Music]

okay I need to stop going to your back

okay

bye

hey uh

I died

I fake

ah the crystal is back so as long as you

don't drain it fully it responds

okay

all right

thank you

but this doesn't even affect me

well I guess that was a cool well it's

yeah

why is it doing that it didn't do that

before

I was doing it because I hit more at

time and can avoid

those game is weird

thank you

foreign

ah so the the fourth door does actually

open

well I'll take that back then you

oh yeah it's almost gone first

oh what's this

price greatest fear is a

chameleon what's that how you said you

in there

no I don't think so I think space is

fine history of the Dragon race it looks

like it's all here

it is can you determine that spire

that it spoke to me

respect to spy here back to the

beginning of time

the Chronicles

it is high

and I've been waiting for you

of course

or should I switch this uh it wasn't

necessary evil

sorry about that I pressed the wrong one

should have switched back to this this

time

for over a thousand years

been here I haven't paid attention oh

yes but I have my books

and I watch and wait

and listen for things to come

and then add them to the books of time

you were also written in the books

though many pages are still left

incomplete I am can I see

of course you can

this one is yours look

I mean I'm PR I'm probably reading some

books somewhere probably some

book of

the registry of the population of Sweden

or something

I had no idea they were more spy against

than this

and when they took sin oh nice colors

this is Cinder color

yeah it's the first thing I'm placing

one then you have

wait can these books

[Music]

books just glimpses of the future really

then I want to know what will happen to

Cinder Spyro you don't know finally talk

I must know

very well

as is

she she has a black tail yes you know

yes I understand when she was taken

she was poisoned and corrupted made to

do the Dark Masters bidding

her entire life has been spent in Shadow

she knows no other way that no um when

the dark master returns this is yeah

no one can resist the temptation

strongest

I don't believe that

Spyro let me tell you another story

can I pick the story this time

that was once a dragon long ago whose

raw power was far greater than anyone

had ever seen or could imagine

at first he mastered fire

which was odd because he was not a fire

dragon

then came ice and wind and other

abilities none for possible

is this story sounding familiar

it was a purple dragon like me the first

purple dragon

in the beginning he was encouraged and

secrets of Elemental Mastery were passed

on to him willingly by the elders

that's what I'm saying

it knew no boundary

he consumed

everything

when he would not stop he was cast into

Exile and from his new Fortress within

the mountain he built an island not a

dragon's but of apes and taught them to

artificially harness the power of the

gems our life force you're talking about

the dark master yes

and in his dark seclusion the sheer

weight of his malice cracked the very

foundational amount I was going to fight

the dark master creating a pit of

despair where the Lost Souls of this

world could resign The Well of Souls

created by the very Beast who now seeks

to escape it

okay

said that the eclipse would only allow

the spirits to escape for a short while

yes but if there was ever a spirit

powerful enough then how do we stop it

there is no stopping it

it has been written then why have you

called us here I don't understand to

ride out this storm where you'll be safe

to tear out of the pages so it's not on

everything that's pretty good what about

the others what about their safety I

feel the worst for the others and Cinder

am I supposed to sit here and do nothing

well she joins them

let me field this one yes no you keep

talking about choosing a path

but what about Cinder she was never

given a choice

I have to try I'm going and you can't

stop me then

I won't

young dragon I've waited far too long to

watch you leave here stricken with grief

and doubt you'll need a clear mind and a

pure heart if you are to withstand the

evil that consumes that place for this

voice

for me but I have to walk my own path

and do what I know is right so be it

Spyro

I will show you the way but you must

hurry the dark out of the eclipse is

near and haste will be your only Ally

all right then well

so I know why I died

how to rescue another evil creature that

has already tried to kill us

I'm pumped let's let's do this

isn't that what you did in the previous

game

Elijah Wood is his name wait so

oh yeah yeah yeah yes

spider

Lord after the Rings

I heard I have heard brother I heard

everything but it's not like I don't

know actors and stuff so anyway back to

bionic if you're still here and you said

you did not there was more games than

the first three well after a size first

and they had

I didn't I don't know if you heard about

enter the dragonfly

here's tale you don't need to come with

me I won't think lessons

Yeah Boy what am I saying

and then there's like seasonal fire and

Flame

is that two games

Inspire Adventures

and stuff on Nintendo handheld consoles

and then there's this Digital Spy

trilogy

yeah I missed the games oh yeah a Shadow

Legacy which I tried once but I should

probably maybe do it again anytime we're

supposed to get over there

oh this place

yeah it's 100 to me the first game I

ever had was the German spider though

buying from the start

that's a good start the well-made

platformer

unlike this I guess

what is this

okay I'm sorry

and I intent is that I'm saying it to

play all of the spider games I will try

and try and play again because I have a

new way to run it

and then hopefully it will run it's fine

if not I guess I just have to skip that

one of all the games

I have technique completed in the past

it's not on stream

first player I played was entity

message fun

it is really short so

if you don't I guess the loaders I had

made it much longer than it should be

I'm pressing the wrong button

alright goodbye

okay

that was weird

kind of root too and just leave like

that

interesting

oh

okay okay

got to remember my training do you have

an idea if I had to do that

hey is producing this as a scary man in

the Joker

um

it was okay I wish to do in different

breasts types had more of an impact yeah

they cannot never do

not even in this game they have an

impact the only time he is required is

I guess the Elemental Dragon which is

just a recolored Cindy

[Music]

thank you

foreign

also has sentimental breasts but it also

doesn't use it really

I mean it it's a green door

but it was about to try

oh it's supposed to go down

what was that

we've Aspire taking damage what did it

sound like

what is this uh goo off

and nature power

so if it's wind why is it green

ah Abacus fire energy press for

assessing the same

and very few places to take advantage of

the platforms made by using icebread

yeah

someone disappeared

You Can See Your Shadow

game time

right after that

hello I'm here welcome

try not to die again

um

yeah welcome

thank you

[Music]

she's the spiral

you don't mind the outfit by the way

it's uh

[Applause]

[Music]

did they sound like this kind of loud I

don't know if it's a microphone picks it

up there

I'll never say I kind of see

now you too can

this is silly

well it will save

and I'm dying again

[Music]

leave me alone

need help

I see her Frozen

close

a shaking stuff up as always yeah

very kind of thing

give me people at least

foreign

yes so

um

well okay so the power is in this game

are different so you can find whichever

you like the best of

I like the eyes best because it slows

down enemies and also

wow

and it also makes smaller enemies

incapable of attacking you which is

quite useful

but there's no reason for me to switch

away from Ice

okay

[Music]

all right

okay I'm getting

from five

someone's throwing bomb it's you

can you please not do that

when we get there

it's a similar effects going on at the

same time so now we don't have any bumps

[Music]

right there's another one

come from

now this game does have different

effects which press but yeah

pets yes

but but they were frozen how did he

attack me

I

look outward I need to start I I even

I even predicted their attack

by using the

Express early on

it's okay we can try again

anticipate but you still essentially

have to specialize in one or few of them

to be effective leaving the others

mostly and useless yeah that's a it's a

great way to describe it

I haven't even checked the level up

stuff

like I haven't

gotten anyway

I guess I can level this one up

so

nice level two you do level up much

slower in this game

was that that one okay that was pretty

easy

missed everything

okay you need to stop me now

so hopefully you can fall down in this

hole

doesn't have to deal with you

oh that was quick too

I'm gonna stand with these big ones

how much damage does that cost

that's that seemed to cause I love the

damage so that was pretty good

but yeah no more big ones as far as I

can see so

if you want me to do that I wanted to do

that

oh yeah

fancy time

at the same time

but at least this game has your current

breath weapon type to your regular

attacks even if you don't level them up

you still benefit I wonder if your

regular tanks become stronger if you

level them up

I guess you could have checked out on

the

but like

I don't really notice any type advantage

and if there are the game hasn't really

so I find it

what's happening I'm getting exploded

too much is going on where's the music

confused [ __ ]

so much fighting

where are you going

oh

my God

it's too many small ones yeah

okay that's my understand

I say you know is that all right he had

enough

of course not

one more

sorry about the F1

oh

is it in the chemical slow motion okay

now it's dead

please please no more enemies

to my name is in this game

I give spider that flame charging ice

has a tail spin thing what

foreign

to be the same trapping the camera

inside

okay where am I going now

tricky something

where was that

go up here

huh

spider's dying

I think I was meant to share them

it's

I've got to remember my training

yeah you went change for this

that was the wrong way

and this doesn't seem like

a good way to do that I do because

I slow down this one I guess it's worked

out so

I guess it was a good way of doing

oops

I guess why don't you try shooting some

magic out of your face that was exactly

that what spider did and um

that costs him today

yep that's my cream around the corner

okay how about that

nothing

yeah

okay maybe I should

say okay

but it exploding yeah

I guess I should use fine on that thing

but it's hard to get close

to the right button

why did spiders start climbing on the

back and why did that one stop bouncing

there's too many I can't even get close

okay I'm confused

I'm sure you'll get it this time

huh

come on

and now it's empty

it did that chance

depressing

what's up

you can't why doesn't it affect some of

them

do their eyes resistance

morphine

don't you see all your friends time

it's a good idea oh you're dead

okay

we're coming

turn away

there you go

and stay away

I got stuff to take care of

oh now it's just me where to go

all right that's not how it's completely

flat spider

I'm very flat

okay

more platforming

oh I see oh hello

I think I saw you sneaking out behind me

like that that's pretty rude

oh

that

is there okay expect it

trying to get something from that I came

back to what I was doing before I rudely

started to attack

oh this is not going to work

oops

hey try not to die again well thanks for

the suggestion

[Music]

okay now

yes

decision let me not try to die this time

then

oh oh yeah

all right yeah

shit's probably

do that

um

Universal platform to jump to that was

the end of that

I think I have the straight to go on

and that's

that sounds great

but do I I have this thing to go on

because I have no idea what I'm supposed

to okay so I'm kind of supposed to jump

over to that thing

thank you

hey I jumped too far

Lookout world

foreign

I better be a bit more careful

yeah I

I do suggest doing double gems when I

wanted to do some gems

[Music]

that would be

very appreciative

and that would help me a lot actually

okay let's see if I can

get over

that

which one okay and then I should go

there I think

things

there you go

okay I don't need uh the head here

oh and then there's a feather

now it's an easy one

ever since it easy to get over here so

let's continue

I don't like

I don't like that

and also

doing that I'm trying to see here

an ice is the only one that helps the

platform as well

foreign

this is quite a challenge

hey try not to die again Find Your Spawn

no name I guess it's because

the attack

where did my eyes go

I'm sure you'll get it this time and

it's fun because the ice would have

infected me

the wall or something

I want to be surprised if that's the

reason

all right

oh no not on one of those again

can you

especially since you don't get

checkpoints for like

I think oh that was close so

okay

so now I just have to focus on one of

them that does make things easier

I'm about to die anyway

how did that hit

me

was clearly above him

a bit dark in here

you can't see anything

floating skull yeah I guess

that's a bit weird

not two more

[Music]

okay here are about to die

all right

did that

oh that's how we get up I see

oh

my God

okay and then I want my house

that works

I did that pretty well I think

is everyone having to leave the battle

twice or three times I don't remember

okay

okay

I need to wait for you stand here wait

do nothing

come on game

that's not fair

I better be a bit more careful

no you can't reach me

what they're going to do about that

waiting for tomorrow

[Music]

oh this is going to take

like

foreign

[Music]

it's a puzzle in how I should platform

so okay there's a platform

I should be able to reach it

oh this looks like a ballerina and it's

saving hmm

I don't like the look of these

do this

foreign

laughs

all right

the bunnies bounce uh yeah of course no

not too much

and it spells a lot

foreign

does help

he's attacked was over

okay I was waiting I guess he's nice

I think I have the strength to go on

and now I don't have the scene because

the games reset everything because my

foot why would they do that

oh

why would you give me five

foreign

that was very nice

don't have to deal with that one

how are you laughing you've been missing

me all this time

yes

that was actually pretty easy

we are doing amazing pump I believe in

you I

know thank you

I am

I guess I guess it's okay

and then these come

I'm gonna see if I can do that again

[Music]

not between them

okay

[Music]

why is one of them so high up

okay this works

okay another one all right let's get rid

of this first then

now

the attack was over

I have more spooky scary skeletons yeah

there's a lot of them

and no checkpoints

let me move

okay so it has back

huh

oh man come on

let me move

here we go

thank you

I don't need to translate this in okay

I believe in the front pan she's a

pretty funny

skin scope

okay

that's if that's what you wanted

um

you only get the manual voice

[Music]

that's right wrong way

but thank you thank you both of you

the motivation for me to continue okay

I'll try my best I

I think

one words to battle okay now now I'll do

it for real

of one of them spawn inside the eyes

sometimes you can't protect them

laughs

that's a writer is

[Music]

okay you can

after dealing with these two I guess

excuse me

it's not here I'm battling

foreign

yes

well

hydrate

hydration done

okay

ready

I need to take care of this

one

thank you

no not yet

not yet

can I destroy it

[Music]

there you go

I was going to say and this didn't give

my house but I take more damage tonight

get back

[Music]

some hands back

you got some more help

I'm dying yeah

is that why you can die

can you stop please stop trying to hack

this

I think that didn't work

I rather see I allowed to leave

and not waste once up there

oh

my God

this way

I can't I

started working here I'm gonna jump

behind us

I need to be above their plates

like this

you can't

and then these two at least there's no

more small ones

now don't do that

and then I think that's to know what

it's doing

foreign

[Music]

after seven

two Riders

don't have much area to fight on

this

okay

maybe that was about any

okay

I need help

okay

[Applause]

no no I don't

come okay I mean it's cooperate with me

I almost said I was close

okay someone jumped off I like that

they seem to not have jumped off so I'm

not sure what happened

I didn't need one spawn instead

really

it is

all this battle and then I get knocked

off the enemies keep jumping off the

ledge yeah no okay let's do it I start

all over

oh that's he's fine enough

do you want nothing

oh

okay I guess

in this case you can actually attack the

picture

thank you

enough yes

all right Kenny I forgot that it had two

faces

foreign

at least

at least those don't damage

yep

I mean I need the emotes to begin with

[Music]

there you go

no don't take that one uh this is a

waste

oh nice

okay

[Music]

this I actually made this problem yeah

I'd mentioned this uh last stream I

think which was yesterday

that I should maybe just the custom

notes

oh

that might actually be a good idea

okay can you stop please stop

please don't attack me when I'm

attacking someone

all right

unless they cannot root attacking

someone who's busy attacking someone

to be honest

and I said hello

later taster not laser tasty

I wish I could just because it's like

kicked me out of the

everything

that's part of the uh

evolving Pom-Pom into uh

we go

platform

I accidentally found the another feeling

or is it a meal oh no

one of these

it's safe to stand right

okay

I don't know where I am how far into the

game I am

[Applause]

another explosion is meant

all right is it those

the enemy drop things

oh

nothing great at the moment

oh you're gonna need to stuff

there's nothing to pick up just inside

the ground but Swensen

heat or anything of that chain

ah

nice

why is this panel harder than the other

one [ __ ] got to remember my training

oh these guys look angry

they all look angry

death oh

sorry I didn't see any yeah I think I

have the strength to go on you redeem

they send their scene redeemed

okay one more try

leave just one more

where y'all coming from

I can't fight

one on one

there is a bit far Maybe

and it's not fair to be it's not fair to

be invisible

[Applause]

okay let's watch out for the explosions

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

um

I can't take it am I

really want to die

storm

I couldn't tell the thing that was

supposed to go to the right outside of

the door I actually had to climb point

and that's something is this

camera doesn't want to show me if

there's something hidden

I'm behind the camera

no

hey and I am making progress

if I'm not easy

the only issue I have is that I don't

have like

when the girl was fine chronically and

that that's just been done that's

probably the first step is done

you're doing amazing progress

thanks Mickey

out there

the next step is basically finding

Cinder but

like

that was clearly a platform if I was

supposed to get yeah here we go

you know yeah

apparently not

hey try not to die again but I'm sorry

don't kill him

I couldn't pretend we never saw that

oh my son no yeah that didn't happen

around okay there we go now I did it

[Music]

[Music]

okay this actually looks like like kind

of like an end boss

you can do it

yeah if it's like the end boss

should be like a prediction

it's so weird

and says yeah I mean Sparky is less less

of a joke to be fair he's weird but

he seems to

act better

where are we

better question is what's that smell

oh this isn't metropus

dawn of the dragons no that's next game

I wouldn't miss it

foolish Dragon you won't know much

I've made it this far haven't I

yes it would've been quite elusive

and I would know that all it would take

would be your miserable Amity for cinder

what's Amity how tragic really that

seems to be the one to destroy you

nightmare never ends thanks you don't

need to do this Cinder

just like old times I'll Spyro

same as last

[Music]

time

don't touch him the welping is mine

okay this isn't the most I expected

do you want to do a prediction anyway

no I don't know we have nine people

takes a lot to that prediction Maybe

okay

so that so I don't get any any

okay I see

he just walked through that

okay that was a quick attack

okay this feels like it's going to be a

long battle

definitely a lot better

yep oh did I win

special

especially since every attack as well

else

yeah I feel like this is going to take

the whole stream

come on

yeah I'm not good at this time

it's fast in there

especially if I had to go straight three

faces

with no health and without regenerating

health

and I keep

yeah

um yep

this is going to be a long battle

I guess I'll just avoid him

fruit

Anthony does this thing

okay that's fine just like zero point

okay so I'll just I'll just wait for him

to do that thing and then that's what I

attach I guess

is that serious supposed to do

the bus band might actually not be that

tricky

okay

um

that one did

I think the boss battle is going to be

tricky if this if it's gonna be like

this

okay now yes

true okay

what

no

that was making progress

that helped me

mm-hmm

okay now

when at least I like the Ice King

after it gets

released I guess and he doesn't attack

immediately

secondist

the attack is what she said

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

that was too close

[Music]

finally

ah

a

okay

base one done

will I actually checkpoints

my sister is like

oh it's broke

what happens if spider steps in that

change in another bus back

oh spider's a black dragon though

oh

foreign

thank you

yeah we can't continue doing that

beginning in seconds

[Music]

in that one

what happened

foreign

[Music]

it just has such so much health

and it pushes this part normally plus it

doesn't work like this because they

I'm actually stuck here

[Music]

oh yeah

thank you

okay

it doesn't even do any damage

no time to fall down

[Music]

I can't

foreign

that's actually the

listen to me

wait it turned out

Christmas

I'm playing this

what are you waiting for Dragon

finish me I'm sorry you have too much

health and spider became weaker when it

became dark

I think so

in our health okay let me guess

I should just press this button

I can't move

the bastard man

oh that was

quick and easy

you wait the feet boss

Cinder is alive

you okay buddy

whoa calm down man it's me I can't

Pyro

what have I done you killed the bus

I couldn't stop

just go get up Spyro we're not leaving

without you usually I would say ignore

her but she's making sense this time

oh no we're trapped

right out this storm

and live to fight another day

get close to me now

[Music]

Babble you're close to me I want the

candle with you before

this thing falls down

[Music]

and they live happily ever afterwards

[Music]

and that was the end of that

yeah I think

I didn't know

[Music]

but what's happened with the whole day

dark master what was his name

I did I didn't follow the story at all I

didn't know what was what was going on

she had like

I don't know because someone summarize

their story yes because I didn't know I

thought was going on

the first the first game makes sense

this one did not

did his cross in the dark it was what's

the

okay okay let's see so Cindy left

the dragon place

to

gosh I don't know she didn't feel like

she belonged there

and then

she uh inspired my inspired went after

and

but I guess lost track of her

and then he runs into those

uh

monkeys Apes what they're called

did he finally finds Cinder being

captured

and then

when they are going to have their Bell

[Music]

as that another faction of

monkeys come and the kidnap Cinder again

[Music]

and then Spider goes after them

instead

[Music]

and then there's the whole thing of

inspired looking for the Chronicles I

don't know what that name was

foreign

about the dragon who they exiled

whenever

was part of this

I don't know

[Music]

um

[Music]

well here we go to cast a bit late

you would Aspire with my Sparks girl but

lights

many names

[Music]

it's Tim oh additional voices that's the

best characters

[Music]

and now this is going to be a

localization team that's that's a

day

oh they actually specify the languages

but only

but not the people but only the

companies

[Music]

I very few people for an organization

but yeah

maybe I need to go

to City spider we can't read this

summary okay here we go see the left

because Park might have a unwelcome yes

that part I kind of followed but it

follows her the temple is attacked oh

yeah I forgot the Apple being another

attack

and spider catch you have to see that we

get together again so I do

let's turn to services that roster or

die

to but who is the dark master

what's it girl getting down

gold

oh here

the Nordic says the marketing

translation of this there will be there

will be a Swedish translation of next

game

but I've played in English anyway

next game will be the very first and

[Music]

the first game that was translated to

Swedish

and there

and then the ingredients chili was also

translated to English

and I don't know about Skylanders but

those two

are the only two games

or if you want to count to this phone

and that are available in Swedish and

then the Skylanders might

is very likely to be available in

Swedish too

next button is instructed to go with to

that Island the height

but he doesn't want the balance Cindy

but while he's at the island The Chronic

tells him the origin of the dark master

okay

yeah I didn't really follow the what

what was what part of the own world

yeah I really need to read that Story

summary

I'm

I am confused

[Music]

thank you

and the dark master is a purple dragon

yeah as far as I got that and who became

too powerful perfect crops

and he Spanish then he raised an arm of

the storm against the Reigns but we

never saw the

first in this game

except for like backstory

oh this

this is a long summary of the

story

[Music]

well I guess I could

please

when it's available on the weekend

and like maybe I can make sense of it

and the final boss was the Dark Master's

second income man who was the one

responsible for skin and cinder's egg

yeah and that that part I kind of missed

I didn't follow that part I was kind of

not fully paying attention to the cats

inside it that's

kinda

uh my faulty it's over it is over wait

he came he came into the Korean credits

great timing

I want to see if there's like an end

credit scene or something like it was in

the first game

and probably something and trying it's

this bad game maybe

great timing for me yeah

the dream section riggers the animation

section animations animators

the engineering section engineering and

it's just

that's a weird way of

making the sometimes okay to Something's

over

many thanks to our partners spouses and

families who put off with us being away

when we're working on these products

wait you never came home

come to sleep or eat or something

thank you is that one for playing The

Legend of Spider-Man

coverage 2017

Inc our exercise

[Music]

can be right back are you going again

but then can't see there it is

young dragon

All Our Hope Now lies with you

when you wake up it will be a different

world

but to know this

You Are Not Alone

you have allies

[Music]

okay they mentioned Hunter too you never

shifts up in the game either

[Music]

the third game I guess

or extras

ad candy

oh that was the wrong way

expire spider

did this uh I was thinking

um

like yeah this is the first game

I guess they didn't have enough camera

in the first game so they just put it in

the second game too

his character pictures rather quickly

you have expired into that speech

ah

Abba

[Music]

well anyway

in Spanish United centered and gets

trapped by Falling Rocks as far as since

the Marlin in a cattle bubble roll case

well at that but I got he wanted to kill

him and then the the entrance scene

is craft craft

[Music]

and then going to wake up you know I was

coming very quickly

no challenges Dragon shield is one

okay

let's see what the dragon challenge is

yeah they will be a different point

which it will be a different console but

yeah we'll randomly switch elements

during this spell okay

that sounds annoying

I want tea

okay I'm getting killed

him

okay

you can't

there you go some real power

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

I don't know

I don't have anything more to

add to that I guess

so

that was one

that was the Spyro

I'll be right back okay

Legend of Spyro Adventure

nice of all of you to I

come here and watching the

it wasn't too much left of the game but

it was a hard day for me to even know

how much it was of the game because it

was

yeah I didn't keep track of this story

it was a bit too confusing for me

so someone is playing Spider-Man I think

that sounds like something

and she had a comp

rebranded her Channel

I don't remember what her own name was

but now she's

here

a Iran BT

so yeah

playing Spider United

the first game

on Three Rivers world my favorite

quality

well I guess it is nothing more for me

to add here

is this is sorry talking about stuff it

is the

regular

emojis so everyone can use it

also

now it's been two everyone's only

streaming for two hours

I don't know how much longer

why can't I hear anything

yeah all right that's why

[Music]

[Music]

okay since the chatting at the moment I

don't know if she was playing more

spider we'll see

it would be a surprise
