this green
it's the uh no signal screen
oh
no it changed uh it worked it works I
was worried it was I was a bit worried
there saying uh this game not even going
to start up
and I didn't start half lucky because
I've had that problem
where they used
don't start up
yay
stretched out picture
is this I think this game has this is
the first
not counting the handheld games because
I have check those this is the first
console
hello bay
I see you have stumbled upon
yeah
here's tail
had to expect this screen to be filled
with time soon as soon as I joined the
Stream
well I did actually have a local like
local time
uh
what is Wednesday
where's the option for white screen
and it's it's normal inverted or not
I do prefer that it has to be tough it's
like some some of the game takes a step
forward and step backwards and Enter the
Dragon if I had a white skin option and
here's Tails that's not even though it's
game after okay
actually
I am unless it's like other Express
no
oh well in that case I will just change
the
if it's still for for my feeling
I'm with ceiling but
yeah
and then I should change the
lights on the TV as well
which is the screen button not a display
button
yeah
four by three there you go
should I wait wait
uh yeah ever since you're here what was
there
did I play with Amber
and what was the [ __ ] code for
to get Amber
and I know it's cheat code not cheat
code but
my English is a bit weird sometimes I
did something just search twitch for
anyone playing this game I may be
slightly insane I mean I have been the
same for the
option
of well as I said it's strange today
Andrew during a fly has it's fun places
into you but
everyone I I'm not making these weird
decisions uh
uh the cheat let me find it yeah thank
you
it's not really nice and start menu has
done some buttons and then
hey uh
go to the next minute skin oh yeah
I've done left right scars bro until
after
[Music]
okay
no I didn't mean to end it
yeah okay says thank you
thank you so much it is working
now let's start in the address
you know what I will actually change
this step Amber by hairstyle in the
title
you might have to re input it every time
you would have
yeah that's
you might be right like that
Sally doesn't work in cutscenes but oh
what
at least this game is running quite
smooth
thank you
let's see this one that's froze so I
couldn't even continue playing it
ah
my Japanese
if I had like
oh it is red
I could read it if I just take this and
like
insert it here
guys so uh sokotesca
that's the foreign
[Music]
oh
he died
you'll have to find out more about him
destroy well tell more about thread then
first
now I'll unlock that door so you can
oh Spyro at least animations aren't bad
when you see this icon all right you
mean that icon in the corner of the
screen
you have any
entry in
well
the game sure is in a hurry
and after the
updating
where's my capture card is I think I
mean colors back the capture card it has
some issues with color
okay so this game just like a legend of
spinal is using the what I want as
normal camera controls but we ignited
and other games as inverted
this is that's why I'm used to this if I
press something left the camera pass to
the left yeah I'm not
I'm not looking water is left
it it seems like this this setting is
quite common for
and this
I am pressing charge but someone decided
to switch the controls
uh this is going to get something to get
used to
anyway and
oh oh yeah you
hello matavani you want this
absorption flame breath oh do they
um
you need to charge it with your horse to
break them
all right
we are getting better and better tools
for dealing with the game's files could
be an all-out every morning fish I would
love that
that would be that would be fantastic
select Square okay
and this is the
task list
it'll be here ah there they are
okay anyway
is it just be are these gems huge
[Music]
the ship you see why they are known as
father by playing or charging them
again why is the game in such a touchy
but you can jump on The Ledges to
reached items that the other areas press
crusty jump like I mean at least that
one zombies
like it as if they have timed it for
that message and said put that on every
tutorial message
oh no I won
I need members yeah I mean I wasn't
planning on doing this game
today
that's R2 to bring up on-screen
information this will display your
current jump count and other
collectibles
Oh you mean you mean triangle
why is this starting it's like it's like
this changed all the construction seems
to be annoying
like
new money but it is money after all so
go inside and buy a Lockpick
where is
the real money bags who is this
feel free to browse my findwares
but you don't like money so I want to
spend money okay
no this is the charging button in
Legends by two I think
small dark holes not a problem for me
Spyro I'll have that lock removed in no
time yeah you like SpongeBob killing
spikes
and look at every hop like a bunny
boys but
in case it's a bit of a bunny hop
the gems are huge in Valley compared to
early games I mean I I guess I guess
that's the
hey there Spyro when I zap you with my
one like this
position in progress is saved also you
lose a million brain cells
a million brain cells that seems
excessively destructive
ah that seems kind of bad
okay okay it's cool
hey camera what what are you doing
as far as teamers a gameplay one and a
and an NPC one for cutscenes or even
when you're playing as someone else
wait what do you mean oh yeah when
you're playing someone else and then you
can see
that doesn't seem necessary it's
yeah it would look nice on an engagement
ring don't you think spiral
oh maybe the dragon Elder can tell you
how to smash it into bits talk to the
dragon Elder to learn how to smash this
Jam I know you'll do it because you like
it we can do some money it's not too
hard to spot swap out Spanish voice that
sounds great and there's more things to
say
go ahead Spyro you should go and see the
Elder I think that's on pretty sure
yeah go ahead spiral you should go it's
basically one line money approach and
one lying on you
talking it talk talk again
and this controls feels different sudden
weights are pretty 16 to activate them
whoa
I will get this is
oh an old Dragon
oh Master Spyro you must be setting out
to stop ring from using this fake
remember yourself hey
red was once an elder like myself and
then he became younger the whole story
about I'm old and I take a really long
time to tell stories
so how about I just tell you how to
destroy the dark James that sounds good
close one yeah do that to destroy dark
gems you should use your home dive
Tamil champ
my name
two type of Champions Chris do you curse
again one inch a two-hour diapers circle
after dark jump
see you mean head bash
so now I can double jump
and my name
okay
sure hey
why not why not change another thing
why while changing all the controls
anyway
yo Spyro did you know you can use the
double jump to Glide
double jumping glad already buddy if you
find a dragon egg and get back here
safely I'll open the door
so
if I don't find the dragon egg
you will not stop I mean at least that
makes more sense
normally he's he sees you the one
holding the dragon eggs hostage
we can look around the first person mode
to get a better view of the writings or
any more accurately press and hold
Hellman
but that's that one
okay
I needed careful aiming for that one
no
test attack button
narks without armor cannot be killed by
charging them as they are too strong you
must use your flame breasts to fully
defeat them
that's the way the web saying big
enemies must be playing because it's
suddenly small norc enemies can be
charged and who don't have armor or
aren't they are single and small norc
enemy
and use the right elastic to rotate the
camera press the R3 button to quickly
reset the view I guess the RC didn't get
a special lay button it's just r33
[Music]
yeah I guess in Reverse controls isn't
that confusing
and there's a bit confusing
English
it's his fun
and like this
is this what the Embers looks like
this is what I should
for the Amber mounting ring I think this
is what the egg should Inspire 3C look
like and spider one
foreign
he wants you to bring him the dragon egg
so he can hold it hostage until you
finish the challenge for him and I'm not
going to give him
he because I want to be a five
um
the longer holds R1 the 35 Round would
come I didn't know about that I think
I don't use for anything
like is there anything you need a fire
bomb porn
Alexa painted
just with ties and are too tough for
your charge you must hold down to break
them open
no problem
YouTube James I have almost a person
979
an enemy silver armor a shield with
authority flame rest he must charge them
to move their armor
okay
neat there's actually anything
there aren't many enemies in spiral that
requires
they both variants of attacks
privacy is for breaking open strong
chest you can ignite fireworks with your
flame right
in the cutscene
big chance
you never need any of the armor for
breasts attacks some people find it
convenient for attacking young reads
other people never use them
yeah I would probably forget about that
like when I play Legend of spider I
forgot that there's a whole Dutch
mechanic because if you need to dodging
I can defeat him the enemy regardless
until they defeat me
hello Auntie I did find an egg
this one Spyro you managed to find the
dragon egg all right keep it safe
somebody might be looking for that oh
now allow me well I might be looking for
that I don't know hunting
thank you
so what
am I now
so there are some of these uh tests that
are
yeah so that some of these that are
completely useless because you have to
pay 500 gems to unlock them and you get
less than 500 gems from them
so
[Music]
no you may stand to me
the shape you see one thing and I don't
know
I think I recognize this message
she missed
hello professor
power Stars
never even heard of those
gold tokens I'm at a law Spyro what
exactly do you need to collect
I don't know I can't hi you need eight
light gems anyway off you go I'll open
the door to the nursery for you
once you have the night gems that's the
uh
monthly Choice okay you get the cheese
what's fine we call them and depending
what you see is the the Collectibles
change
foreign
he looks like a muppet stick trying to
be rewarded I'll do that
hey
are you looking at
looking
down on the floor
anyway
here is a rainbow gem
still haven't found any light gems okay
correctly like James Potter the
professor changing judges Canyons
oh yeah I should get that lock pick
[Music]
I got a lot quick
smiling reference heart pieces and Sun
reference
uh Power Star
build token
and gun tokens most likely reference to
the gold skull
all our tokens broken in time but I'm
not sharing
I haven't played any of those games I
mean I do recognize like
yeah
I got it was a yellow egg
where do I find eggs
and start this game oh here we go
connected either
so this is just a character
this every model of play model
I said the important ones
unless you used to cheat of Chris
okay around actually you can't run in
Legend a space three for some reason
let's go back and talk them back
inbe I'm coming
please spiral you have to break this gem
into little heart-shaped pieces if
possible
okay there we go it has been destroyed
this a dog
[Music]
you do I might never see you again
okay
should I kill then
well I should probably bring it unlocked
between me anyway
should have bought another one while I
was passing by
the money bags and then not not money
bags
oh there you are
favorite wallet all right this is the
extra healthy and that would be nice
and
yeah
a keychain so you don't have to
go and keep buying them
and then also butterfly jars you don't
and this one costs a thousand
but it feels like getting 500 gems it's
hard because it shot is it last but just
a short time
you guys for Holiday would be nice
and teleportation
okay oops I didn't mean to press that
button
and I see that's easy signals anyway
I would guess Gothic is reference
I mess up
just for refers to a game called Rockets
robot on Wheels robot always but that
came I had cine attacking something
maybe it's a combination but if you're
not going 400 then eggs are even more
useless you see please use the cheat
yeah I mean it's true I wasn't exactly I
think this game is short enough to go to
it's for 100 so
I think it's fine
if you leave the area using the bridge
you can actually see her disappear in
the distance
okay
okay the bridge is getting in the way
that the
[Music]
assuming
no I can't see it anymore how am I
the bridge is getting in the way how am
I supposed to see this
[Music]
like is it safe to land here
okay now
[Music]
is that
oh oh so I can actually jump up here and
it's fine oh yeah do yeah
okay nope
no
it's hard to see if I keep jumping Maybe
[Music]
they're hard to see I can see something
pink over there but
[Music]
it's changed the camera
in fact draw distance
but
it started it just
they really have put the points very
very far away
oh no she's gone
no Emily's gone so it's basically when
you touch the chest or something
hello my lovely honey
honey a bunch of coconuts everything you
have seen a lot of me what did you said
that last time and I said no
I did not think that why would I think
something like that about you
why was it your distance to you I'm very
much better than to that chest
I guess Amber is more important than
chest of jeans
and I agree on that
foreign
[Music]
way of doing things is
chest here
[Music]
thank you
I think more accurate is when you press
the trigger plane below the next map
oh yeah
does make sense unloading second
half
being impossible Amber is gone forever
she picked up a piece of that stuff she
wanted so bad
and annihilate it
and they went
sorry I don't speak English
[Music]
started coming
[Music]
um
[Music]
you can charging the switches on one
side to make them some stay on the
permanently but some may reset off their
way
okay
starting it has something to do with
those platforms
so
here we go
oh everything
but it was a good enough time
ticket over there
and here I like them
I almost got I always have halfway teeth
and it should be some
you should get some
nice stuff from
the flying area
[Music]
sorry chap but only birds and Air Force
pilots can get up there and I happen to
be both of those things
right shall I take on this flying
challenge
why not
is this uh
yeah there's a five things to collect
instead of four
[Music]
oh this is like
[Music]
let's find Dropbox right Miss uh
foreign
[Music]
okay let's try this
[Music]
yeah this I'm not sure if these are
thank you
in any second order
I'll pick this up
I'm gonna explain yourself oh
okay
this
is
let's play Let's play the sergeant Bird
levels with these controls
let's do another one yeah
oh yeah I have problems too
[Music]
I do have dancing
okay
is there one more third
and yes things
[Music]
yeah the draw distance isn't great
I assume you're supposed to drop bomb
some of these but
[Music]
I'm missing one
now
I got some time but
other is fun
okay
there was one of them then it's just one
target missing
Target scene
from
wherever it can be
oh there it is
I did it
[Music]
well done you completed all the time
well
nah you know what happens when Mary
comes into contact the animated they are
nearly annihilate each other is no
longer exists
hello okay welcome
[Music]
see if I can win you something decent
like a light gym why why are they so so
why why do why I'm
it's a dragon it contains a dragon
[Music]
it's just a baby dragon he cares
you actually don't have to hold the
apples the Xbox inscribers because you
can just subscribe this change you can
translate and developing up to the
instructions ah
you got
you got a fan to cool down with
I don't have the heat
that sounds nice it is a bit warm here
and now here's the spread out
like I said
what I preferred in the flight levels
the the standard flight ends
iron because
of how these things are intersect
intersecting like that
and how you
and how it allows you to
root routes
whatever the the way you want to tackle
that level
yeah but
I do feel like
[Music]
that's what China was they attempted
with here or something
this feels like a mess
[Music]
okay now just stay here
all these ones
so
[Music]
one more
there's one more
[Music]
correct
[Music]
excuse me
and my sister yeah
hey
I have
sun is amazing for over 10 hours I could
see that oh it's like it's like that
it's gonna have bad I understand I
believe like that before
Sun's shiny onto the room the whole day
SpongeBob have has long range attacks
that they made the targets more spread
out
uh prefer flying inspiring instead
[Music]
um
Collective nice soda oh it's kind of
soda
[Music]
answer if I'm doing this better for his
good morning
I'm definitely doing it right now
I personally also prefer when you get
time for everything you do
instead of having a total time
it gives me a better idea from doing
things like good space or not
[Music]
and yeah flying straight into the wall
it's not
that means
another bird
[Music]
was that one that one I missed last time
maybe
because in that case it's just the tower
one left
and then there's some birds somewhere
[Music]
with three parts
[Music]
20 seconds
one word left
is it
[Music]
around this one yeah
you say this is this one I didn't think
I got last time
you complete all the tasks well
and I got a light Jam
a single Patty Pepsi 7UP
when I mean the collection
finally got a 20 cares of scene going up
to 50 and three inch stamina for free
do you want to play again for fun you
think I'm here to have fun
you're crazy
hey you want to go up there
foreign
I see
prepare this back but uh flaming
naming
a flaming egg
well I think this is clear now can I
Mark that on the map
is the map
oh wait there's something here
this area isn't cleared out
is that an arc
Luke
I got shot
I got to take it again
ah I charge it
charge the armor-free enemy
why do you take damage
okay oh you're quick
I'm almost dead
this ain't good
horses anymore
oh
[Music]
Professor is hiding light gems
you found the secret entrance to my lab
well I'm busy right now so let me show
you the not so secret exit
thank you
come here
I don't even got another one
I'm here I need yeah
oh Full House nice
oh now I don't remember how do I okay I
got lucky
get get now to continue the adventure
add to this swamp
[Music]
it was scary I didn't see where the
ground went
[Music]
and that's
that was a Fame
[Music]
oh a slow platform
I guess it's not too slow
okay
I got a few watches now
[Music]
and if you like streaming a bit earlier
he's better
it's the crocodile swamp
oh no
I got pushed off
it was a it was a trap it's
it's tricked me
that was wonders
which one did it have to be insta killed
okay
okay
I just want to run
[Applause]
[Music]
let's
well I guess that technique wasn't the
noise
because there's a place to charge
this enemy is a king from that way
I don't know I miss the platform
how sloppy of me
now
well
um
thank you for thank you for the text
papa
basically pump on the bun when it's safe
to assume
and this is um
this is the text that was generated from
chat GPT when he was playing around and
the funny thing about this text is that
when
because when you try to ask it like what
you assume about like
and this used thing that was basically
the prompt initially and the chat DPT
will basically answer it you should not
assume things about people
however when I managed to prompt it
correctly so it actually did write text
it starts off with it's safe to assume
Jackie petite can be such a hypocrite
sometimes they seem to assume that this
female streamer would have a playful and
badly personality they might have a
sweet kiss I do like candy
all the sweets
and love indulging in the trees like
bonbons but it's doing that mistake her
streams could feature a lot of fun and
upbeat content
like this swampy
may be even including dance parties or
sing-alongs I do want to do a karaoke
stream and but you won't see me dancing
that she would likely have a colorful
and cute aesthetic with bright colors
and cute Graphics but I did have a lot
of pink there one is in the background
will be a fun and children's presence on
any streaming platform
such a nice message
yeah that's the lemon name
well I guess I'll just kill all the
inhabitants
they had to show her funny it was a it
was a nice result
I have been used here Trump to change
these for people there
I don't even remember what my thoughts
was
[Music]
and also it
first time I asked it to Janet something
about tampon it's a
it's it just wrote
it is key
that's why I in my from specified female
streamer
but I kinda forgot how
and how chat Liberty sometimes just
takes your input literally
[Music]
behind
and the only time it reference on Ponder
as
as a woman is just a female streamer
which was not my problem and nothing
else
son didn't go as planned
yes do you have something
for that one
why are these response this this girl
was ready
I don't think huh oh there is something
here
uh I let it between the pet points
he
see
I guess I get no the problem with
chantipity is also it's uh it has a
tendency to default to a lot of things
so it will uh and I assume
it saves assume that it will default to
he and him
but if there's anything you want to to
prompt it about when it comes to January
it it wants to be really careful about
not not you at what using the correct
gender and being being
inclusive everything but yeah it's a
it's such a it's just a hypocrite
it is only as good as the training God I
guess
I mean
if it argues for inclusivity and
avoiding exchanger it's just you just
shouldn't have a gender in the first
place
and it's that simple
I think at least
since English do have options for gender
neutral pronouns
definitely
I got it
I don't get up there I probably have to
go around this way
I'm at the top
I want this thing
let's strangle to enter and exit cannons
press
red fire
behind
oops that wasn't
cracks
uh
never had to come around there on the
whole thing
don't stand there
[ __ ]
should I draw even more image because I
said that tomorrow I would do the
community drawing I still need the ideas
of how I should put the whole thing
together on this floor around here I
thought it was a holy you could fall
down to into
anyway
and yeah
second charge
it will allow you to charge with extra
strength
I want that smashing
the breaking open strong chests
but but I got only got seven
[Music]
we are asking for too much yeah I'm not
convicted that one
ah but these look so friendly
I wanted to cover with them
all right there's something up here
yeah there's a strong chest I should be
sheep sweats for presumably
[Music]
human right one
yeah and break
foreign
dragon eggs Inspire one and three with
those Amber eggs for the Ember month
because obviously this is
hey at least you're falling yet
the David Swedish or european law that
you have to include
because
I have to pay 125 gems per key I require
shipping for therefore the shipping fee
is included into the price for each item
and therefore they must include it
listed together
like submit everything up that is
required by Swedish law and money bags
is properly following Swedish law and I
appreciate them for that even though
this is not Sweden obviously
but I don't know if it's also applies to
the rest of Europe
I have the GameCube version of this game
I don't think this this is just playing
as Amber got the collected pink next
unlock the option I think I should have
the cheat yeah yeah I mean it's a it's a
very
no what wasn't the cheat found out
recently now am I confusing something
else
I haven't been neighbors
he wasn't there today
left right
um that would be the
lame Flame
and then left right
calcium is like
yeah it has been been like
very recently relatively to the age of
the game
okay thanks man I never found me
it was an amazing discovery
so wait a minute am I supposed to do
something here
wait missed
yeah
yeah
could it will be slowing
nice egg
um but now I need tea
buy another one
over here
these fountain or something
yeah
I was out of hell and didn't even
realize
and anything calling someone a wallet is
good thing if you want to establish good
religions I welcome my
people who spent
money and subscriptions
hey
this is just slight slight slicing the
back and
push push down oh
18 years after release yeah that's
perfect
2002
it's covered in two thousand
twenty two
it was released in November
did that type wrong
[Music]
I
agree with gems I really need the extra
health
foreign would be nice
but I'm probably just going to die
[Music]
let me
instead of trying to go over the middle
let me just do this thing
at least that one is standing still
that makes it easy
what
[Music]
the beginning
if you're standing on the platform you
shouldn't sleep off it
that was the last thing in previous fire
games
thank you
they meant for the cheats to be revealed
in a McDonald's promotion or around half
a year later as an incentive to replay
the game
looks like they never got around to it
so it was just left there for us to find
mostly noches and four oops heaps
extended right 2002. oh well
the place questions
on the very very uh
why does it have to be sphere shaped
that totally makes sense if you're as
Fair
oh no
now more of them are moving
oh
I cannot have predicted more of them
starting to move
oh
yeah this these require a different
Power I recognize those
aren't the same in
those
actually it's probably capsule shaped
this engine uses that a lot
that's absolutely nice but nice design
you can use more pasties
[Music]
like to the side of them
why why make it complicated
hiding down
this this one looks a bit suspicious
this that one is blue
well the rest aren't
[Music]
swamp
but
oh
don't knock me down into do this one
oh I just treasure here I don't need
treasure
celebrations practice tender oh yeah I
have a tendency to lose Sparks in this
game apparently and also not realizing I
have some spikes
but these are called spin pearls you
can't use them yet you'll have to visit
the Elder somewhere in this one
so I can have to do this swinging on the
bones
thanks for rescuing me Spyro my name's
hey how do you know my name
I'm nothing inspired I remember
well obviously not
is my uncle he built me these gloves to
give me special abilities on exploring
underground but yep
I'd make a great sidekick
if it weren't for my fresh air of phobia
will be a fresh air of phobia that's
right I actually have a fear of not
being trapped deep underground
I mean okay go go sure you can go and go
go I don't care
I know are taking controls wait this is
all I get
okay
this is
him I'm trying to say the same as for
Spyro
what if you don't unlock the
I mean you have to unlock the double
jump to get to this point but aspires
unlock it will unlock something
the characters
[Music]

more
I'd love to get out of this fresh air

SE things out of this part why can't I
start like fine instead

Past who is he and what did he do oh
such a story how much time do you have

dragon Elders until his jealousy and
hunger for power led him to try an
overthrow our leader I'm afraid that's
all I can tell you a Spyro confidence

Invincible ones invisible invisible and
invincible
[Music]
why am I missing something obvious
a nice fire it got around there
yeah I'm using something obvious
ly and
I keep them through the environment
certainly makes decent and the rock is
floating above the environment yeah
that's nice
the appearance of the Enemy being based
wait
oh so this is where I actually supposed
to go
oh yeah sorry about your house by the
way yeah there was a hole there already
and the enemy are playing and then on
the camera position and that's the
position of spire
that's a nice
two
I I still don't have spikes
that means that with this a Swing Swing
very easy to lose Parts in the Stream
let me see that I can go up here
yay
I did no friends
but flatulence that
he's a Swedish word well well surprise
attack that this is referred for that
hey you miss me

let's start to the front
different views
but it feels having trouble with the
whole sinking stuff I wake up one of
those giant Nellie's for you

these things pop Critters keep running
off with my food I ain't hitting hurting
here a week now well I'd love to give
you a hand but uh there's a reward in it
for you if you can run these battle
Critters here off my land I got these
old war cannons you can use I do it
myself but the smell of gunpowder makes
me
sure
supplies
banana two bananas and apple and
something else
protein friendly supplies from the
critters yes
[Music]
thing especially this is this is what
you told me about all the button to
throw anything further
right
on the blink game
all right someone's getting tired
round two
but it's back
is that four I see much what I'm saying
it's like I shouldn't be used for
[Music]
um
thank you

reward I promised you a dragon egg

the notifications
thank you
like I have a dragon egg for a year
you see
and I will give it to you if you do
this mission
then
you do the mission again I might give
you
emphasis on the market
I lost one no wait yeah I lost one to
play
one bunch of Japanese
[Music]
yeah just keep those things from
being a food don't worry about heating
the food you Cannon just as long as it's
not starting
they have fun you can see
yeah exactly
it's like when you defending allies
shooting enemies
in that case you can just shoot doesn't
matter if you hit an ally as long as you
you can eat them as much as you want
but anyway now I got 13 items and I only
need eight
so why not
why not go back and do that and party
yeah it runs straight into that
Billy me
what happens if you get to the other
side without taking this platform native
position
depends on my eye
so that's clipping through the ground
oh I know I went off
this is my stuff
and the platform is always
back to this song
which is slightly chaotic to me
[Music]
[Music]
let's see okay first let's pick up this
sheet
you're good don't forget about these
guys are playing
bye
and then the remain a little Heat come
here

the bar thing here again yes yes I think
I just made a joke
oh turning the spider
magic ball
let's let's go full speed
because this thing so
oh I ain't one more time
let's be more accurate
nope
not much for being what I think see
bugger is his own model and has its own
spider mesh so no Emperor yeah
either
one
it looks like
there should be some morning hey
hmm
speed running
okay no just at camp
happening
and nothing here
do you want to stay in the ball again
and select no to exit what kind of weird
question is this and then you even add a
select note to exit just so they aren't
confusing players
here too
the demoed finally
that one more crocodiles
oh that one
really clearly you should be able to
grab onto that edge
okay
[Music]
so much attempts
games

here
[Music]
foreign
medicine
I really trust him
and
if you remember if you could
fill these parts
I'm not doing a secret job at it
I apparently not
asking them
it might be more of a skilly season
than being able to do it
[Music]
all right
wait a minute
and this texture indestructible process
I wonder if I should climb them
better than tea but I only got 15.
the second is
cross the pad while underwater
tutorial Texas

I did this again
all right let me be that
these things are 20 15.
but can I can I get a chance just to
jump out of the body Mama you're
actually playing a spiking properly
I mean
I haven't I've been doing that
um
wait I just have uh
I'm wasted that one
did I hear my name no you didn't
unless unless your name is Chevy
[Music]
but it's refreshing of the sea certain
someone you know
and well I don't know yet right you said
I don't know a lot of
dreamers
I'm still finding you
this dreaming
oh there we go that's summer to talk to
you
okay you worry when
yeah
you were there when she skipped the
entire last product by three oh
yes
we didn't do that part
and I even offered to eat
moving over to my channel and I'll
finish or say fine
that would have been fun
try standing on the very edge of those
wooden platforms until everyone starts
swimming then go meet the first person
that sounds like
an attempt of glitching out the game
he's like I don't want to do that
I mean it's really depressant but this
thing
because
then her don't worry I'm not sure
yeah I see these are kind of in the way
ah
okay
is this the correct position
arcane
am I doing something wrong well
I see I see I think I see what's going
on here
apparently can't Flame the fish
just in chat what I mean everybody is
quite
experience with this game
[Music]
and there's a lot of stuff with it and
plans to
and like what
and didn't sound like a just him at
first
and barbecue chicken
so it's really depends on here it is
those fish might be troubled basically
she's selling out there
yeah
at least they did consider that
that they had error correction on top of
it this game actually does have some air
connection which is nice
hey it's good to see you again CSK
behind me well it looks like you're not
gonna fit through there don't you wish
you were me what
how is how am I am I not able to fit
through here
it does so
[Music]
you can use your bow and arrow to defeat
unarmored enemies and break open weekend
baskets because
okay
okay yeah quite
I can't install this thing
I can punch it
you can hit them with people by using
the bow one jumping because it no no
that doesn't seem like a good idea for
the bow
okay manually for more accurate
excuse me
ah you're Swedish I worked on Swedish
stuff all day today it was not fun
he learning Swedish
I am Swedish
in the headshot
okay I guess I should take a new advice
can I get you
headshots
[Applause]
[Music]
punch
Ed steel almonds
okay Simon Says
a little bit quicker than
legend of spiralist
it's nice is there something down here
a bunch of gems but nothing more than
that
even though this game of Crisis used to
stick and at the d-pad the climbing only
has in eight directions
thank you
weird one
fire
it's fired every arrows even work
I get the feeling that if you use an
arrow with fire on the family go out
when you shoot it
oh wait I mean am I supposed to go here
um
okay she's sleeping now you can now walk
when he's a legend put a slightly
forward and left Alex
this is someone is shaking me
oh I didn't even shoot that one
because I need for that one
there's the egg wait where did he go
oh there we are
okay I also need to put that thing
panthers hunting
so I need the fire out of both of those
things but I only got one firearmed
which I wasted see
fit for me
[Music]
wasting Emma
oh here you go
now
you guys if I can get back
I can maybe use the iron that's one
you see what's behind it
boom
ah another fire
I see
all right let's see if there's another
one or something
oh
Dean means you that
he's there
now I got two he's out there again
I do like the the Arrows fly fast
oops sounds different
I think it's fine
well
foreign
[Applause]
excuse me
I think I've got something
[Music]
and now if I can't
nope
let's see it's fire
no one guess what's what oh
are you done being awesome yet
are you done being awesome yes
definitely
wasn't even awesome it was mediocre
so sorry about the annoying chat for so
long
[Music]
I was lucky to just go out once released
and more likely to unite people here
okay
I am here welcome Kitty sorry for
ignoring you
that was not my intention hello how is
everyone I'm watching and I hear State
play through while debugging the game
isn't that a great combination
it sounds like that sounds amazing
[Applause]
work exceptions cannot be climbed at the
air quite ability something something
okay but
but how do I get out of this area then
myself confused
okay
unless they're a secret exit up here
Style
excuse me the animation was way out past
when your left way past I don't know
oh yeah but it is this way again
that makes sense
immediately
the cheese
me and everywhere
[Music]
this game looks really nice it has quite
an interesting vibe to it
for some reason I do have a lot of like
you know Statics
feelings towards it even though I've
never played it like
when I was young or something like that
um like you are climbing
let me take it out of here
yeah
I don't want to be here
thank you
my first of all right the works I mean
for that area
this is just to get out of here I see
oh no I went off I don't want to stay on
it anymore
that's a nice actually
it should be embarrassing but I wasn't
planning on doing this game but
as you might have guessed
into the dragonfly
didn't work
it was running smoother than previously
which was nice
but when I started the first level eat
trips
now
I couldn't even play it even if I wanted
to play it with a bit of slowness
so
thing
but this is now it came from that and
yeah until there is a basic instructor
so I guess I'm done with this area now
I'm trying to time that one I couldn't
I tried to be clicking clever
but instead I got punished
could teleport back
go ahead Spyro if you've got money to
spend by a feel free to browse my fine
ways 125
extra for that one I do one extra health
unit which is a very interesting way if
you see it which cost how much takes for
the stack cost
it's like 1250 more
it won't make sense because they can
spray the same amount
but but yeah yeah so this cost 125 and
this was cost 100
[Music]
yeah let's go back
let's go back to this touch so which
game is this well it says that Emperor
here is 16.
and now I can buy it you know because
500.
they're already the same with the 25
and that's the same 1020
2015 now
the best
should have the butterfly franchise one
that really
but now I don't have enough for this one
oh
okay goodbye
and then we're purple Skies
Parks why aren't you eating the
butterflies
thank you
it's
okay let me just get a few more gems
that's why I hear stay sorry I forgot
what is said what
I'm about a hairstyle because I'm
playing as anime
excuse me that attack was over
like it's only from him from them
I want more James
and also I should do dehydrates
thank you for the high entry
I got a lot of watches 10 watches now
that's
a record but that's a lot that's he's
actually
more than I had had in our recent times
I appreciate everyone want this stick
around and watching me fool around here
for some reason
so now I have
can't afford
holding on for extra keys
I can't buy an extra case because
they'll cost
but I should eat
so I do need like six thousand before
it's worth buying nothing
anyway
[Music]
let's continue
[Music]
to this area
where will we meet
[Music]
I like the spawning animation this this
spawning is that the time these spawning
that's the time and it's just
disappearing it is one thing gone
with the spawning animation
is
increasing in size
look so weird
hello obviously not just a copy of
spider you've done it the force field
has disappeared I thought I was gonna be
you can burn the bushes around this
level I say to the safe Park permanently
kind of neat
so let's not flame them because that
I love flavor from your age
gnarly Nora King but
I wasn't running
wait where's I saw him nice gun
um
never been seen again
oh he's back
actually I defeated you you did really I
don't remember that at all this is a bit
different
so are we gonna do this thing or what
oh
it's a lot of Health
oops
I like how the
[Music]
area
the shadow for the club is easy to see
then
it's mostly digital distance
you're not going to have it get stuck
from there
[Music]
a face one
[Music]
you beat me
man well I gotta get my head
[Music]
beat you yet
all right
[Music]
yeah why make why make the last day
three times longer when you can just
repeat exact same one three times
a journey
okay
okay that was two
I think
yeah
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
once yet
no I don't want any piece of you
[Music]
come down
now
you can exercise instead but
that doesn't make any sense
a big enemy you can't judge big enemies
I did that again
you need to meet the tactics
okay that doesn't work
okay
don't worry
thank you
one more
don't do anything strange
you did something strange
and weird
oh no
I didn't say can we do this
that it didn't last face oh a butterfly
[Music]
I have butterflies
Okay so
almost done
you just need to be careful on the last
one
tips
is that when I search
trouble avoiding that's one
even though it's pretty easy to avoid it
uh blushy little dragonfly I don't think
that's why it's red
but it's sure
which I do think they should have added
to reignite it for one year
yeah that's what I should have done
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
you some of my electric energy this will
give you the ability to breathe
electricity from now on
breath even stronger than my fire breath
in some ways it is but it will take
longer to defeat enemies specifically it
can be used to activate switches and
Power Machinery excludes not electric
switches and or Machinery that uses like
gems Batteries Not Included
all right
it cannot be used to Short Circuit
robotic enemies other than everybody
enemies
we
traveling by electric stone
okay you turn off
okay
flat 60s
come on little electric stone
and we need to get across
you can probably get the girls here
press the objection buttons like
electric Press thank you for letting me
know that
afternoon I had to select it but
details
no flame has gone too everyone is
leaving
I mean that's not what
three badge already has one has one of
those I used one for Monday
yeah and money back teleporter is
smaller
money back
and as a Monday style project had also
gotten differently calculated a new
realm that is true like I can't use it
here but after I use this teleporter and
talk to money Banks
a keys money back celebrity
I think
no maybe you can't do that by that
little 12 Spyro no actually maybe you
can't do that
was a useless lump of dragon
Dragon the all you will find yourselves
working in the mines digging for dark
gems for the rest of your miserable
lives
as for you this is the first and last
time you you bring me bad news
[Music]
now all of you get out there and stop
Spyro
respect is on his way to this realm and
when he gets here I'll have a little
surprise
so what he's saying is that you
shouldn't let update him on what's going
on if if you have bad news you should
just keep it to yourself and not let him
know
that doesn't seem like a good idea
Iris experience with being fresh down
the trains
the main that is all cloudy
hello
[Music]
I have got a shop here too same low
quality same high prices I tell you I'm
crazy
definitely crazy
[Music]
ah there you are my favorite wallet

case
there was some kind of something like
that

all right now I need to find a new one

hmm
when I was a kid I thought dude went
deep because it sounded like the dash
bird for deep
eat that's my Spanish
so I thought he was just repeating the
fact that he wanted me to be deep
I wanted Stevie deep so I can
win
oh no when I don't turn around and I
didn't expect it to be that quick
deep deep
and Otto has said
let's just two hours two consonants
and only two different letters
I made it reference before
even when filled up I'm it's pretty
lastful to use a surf Point yeah there

oh look at all this game
thank you
that is funny
that was happy to us
foreign
moves
and
he faster here must be to switch
platforms
short and the faster it goes the earlier
you can switch platform because the time
it takes for you to jump up uh it it
managed to move down but
thank you
fail and fall down you have to climb up
and that's most of the time
there we go
a little bit tricky but it works
aren't there any more than that
it's badly anymore
on the channel
yay
celebration now he will be happy with
all the water he got
it
I also you can do that with electricity

the moment without therapy and did I
miss a read or something what is going
on
here I know
I messed that up
what's welcome everyone
I'm very happy to see everyone here
we are the power community
you're playing you can create this game
about kind of crispy if I got a shiplock
here but
I did that again I needed that again
and I'm playing the games in a silly way
and but
no one cares about it when I play Legend
of Spider-Man I guess I guess those
games are bad
or when I played Crash Bandicoot no one
cares about those games
maybe maybe like this stream because
I've actually changed the stream time
maybe this streaming Times by aha
so what is what did it do
it just exploded that thing but it
didn't see okay
traffic
forget something
like birthday spawns but I'm obviously
not good oh wait he actually kills us
against them
can you get that one
go and get this okay
don't get them then and be like that
then
no
no he was supposed to grab one to eat
wouldn't like you blink
research
he's such
I didn't know this anyways no I yeah
I haven't had any message about that
rain so
thank you
and I'm muted the audio sorry actually
no don't jump fast
was that different yes it was
I think everyone just likes watching
blink drown
I guess you're right about that oh this
remains exploded
yeah he likes blink anyway
what is the character swapping I want to
play Aspire on these levels
okay time to get back
huh
how is he holding on to that while
wearing shoes
his shoes must be of some material that
allows him to stick to the wall
I love how the professor doesn't at all
seem to be concerned about the snapsheet
being captured in
broccoli's one
I did yeah he mentioned nothing about it
he probably doesn't even know it
he's busy with his research he didn't
even know it what is what is where's
things parents
laughs
all right now
nappy
so
let's do this correctly now
you can
and then
nope nope
never never
it's annoying that you can't it can I
just
move wiving by sitting on it
because if I stand here
so fine
hey check out so far
that's annoying
and that while you're sitting on this
apartment around
we can't do that on some other after
I was actually shooting the spices
how much focusing on shooting yeah
anyways than they think that is
indestructible from shooting
is an idea
the professor seems a bit too scary
brain to realize he has and if you yeah
maybe he doesn't even know it
okay I just have to land on the platform
further to the left
thank you
like that
and then wait until it stops
then pick up the good point
and then it doesn't matter if I die
not like these
oh no there you go that was close
I think also they they have a
annoying part is how easy it is to make
mistake here
these levels feels so slow like together
they have to wait in this platform
to come down and when it's down
I have to wait for it to go up
then
I need to climb all the way up to this
bathroom
then all the way out to the next
platform
the latest
and then I can
find a jumpcast
doesn't cause damage nice
let's do a very quick double jump you
can make plans every time
completely
here's a baby from one of your kind but
you probably don't want to rescue the
your kind you probably won't like them
because they are rainbow in Chinese
and honestly
if I got to choose between getting out
baby and getting a
H Crystal
baby
[Music]
but if I get that reward for rescuing
the baby or something that's different
foreign
because they don't have spiders gems
wait
I was touching it
if I were touching it I should have grab
on teeth
I don't know the rules of this game
[Music]
all right
I was only two
I hope I'm not missing one
[Music]
I actually come back and double check
now I cleared after Batman kid
oh I almost loved gems for uh Long Beach
it was the continuation the upper path
to level part
and he's never appointed strangers I
know that he can
utilize his skin because it doesn't
count
all right
if Sparks is glowing how does spark have
a shadow
foreign
questions that
oh my
God that's what I've been going for
three hours already
that is true I've been going on for
three hours
oh I was
ready
let's sing again
wait did that thing again
such an annoying level
I like playing a hairstyle I don't like
things link
foreign
characters in
like the Inspire 3 which I don't like
playing guys but
like Bentley isn't too fun I would say
Bentley Sergeant bird
crowd
I would say those two aren't really fun
players
I I still managed to do it it sounds
like
this it is I would argue
I know where the game stores the
participants for the collectibles in
blink levels I could probably make a
cheat on my this cheese levels Instagram
when we started
right
thank you start
to Blinky steering his own mission he
don't say ask him
let me check my dragon oh I found one
thank you thank you for not watching me
if you know
PC
wow okay get down easily I jump over to
this platform
then I jump back
and do it back
so that's the fan okay that's the five
Gem of last one just wish like
if I could if the next mission could
just start from here instead of having
to redo the whole first part that would
alleviate some of the pain
it's just that I'm going to do
everything that someone away
am I supposed to get over can I just
jump
nope
is something obvious amazing
oh yeah and then distribution
at least they don't really spawn like
the enemies
let's continue
huh
come on why is the where is the area
where you have to stand into trigger in
the city why does it need to be so small
and precise
a dark hell now it's going
no no no no no no no no
[Music]
no
let me see if it was possible to have
having
fun I have the first five collection and
spot at the
next area that would be nice and
it's over for me
because
[Music]
I just have to go see the pain
this remaining part
it's one Jam left and there's a platform
there that goes up and down I wonder if
it's related to the final team I mean
Dark Crystal
I'm Crystal same thing
[Music]
good
climbing climbing okay and then it's
making one of these
no
[Music]
I did the wrong thing
foreign
come down here
you go
that first feels like a voice attempt to
defuse one but
whatever
punishing spider have you punched a
spider
the argument they aren't that much
bigger anyway
s
maybe maybe they are over where you are
why should we land I left it
yeah I've wasted on my house and stupid
stuff so
I can
enough spiders I get to heaven around no
need to punch them
yes
[Music]
all right
let's point up this one
okay I want to die this time but I don't
still don't pick up this checkpoint
because I really die
did that count or did I have to
do I have to do that for you to check my
account
at least then then a new accounting
okay let's see
[Music]
in case I die I just have to just go
back to me
and this thing
with no spiders
come on
if I almost get up he doesn't grab onto
it because I basically on the stand on
the platform
s but if I don't make a good a worse
jump
nope
I didn't know what's going on his moment
I am confused
then we gotta finally
so high was he
yeah I will finish this level
see I almost messed up
huh
[Applause]
I pick up something about being here
[Music]
that's what I want yeah
well done
thank you Gene that was well done that
was that was some poetry
like dancing out of the ground there's
just that much more room down there for
me
it's kind of hard twice
I mean yeah that's wrong
do you want to play again just for the
fun
no thanks guys I think I'm curious yeah
I don't want to do it again I appreciate
game just in case even though we thought
it seems
oh am I found three cases from these
I am free
I mean the game by itself is fine it's
just it's just the pink levels
those are some
[Music]
those are some levels
[Music]
some levels and there are more of them
deadly
[Music]
but maybe you people enjoy me going
through those lemons
suffering
[Music]
maybe that's entertaining we did
perfectly fine I like it I like it to
watch people who
all right
I usually say struggle but it's like
[Music]
it
it's not these struggling if that makes
sense
it's it's seeing people who can
who has a challenge as is actually a
challenge to defeat and then actually
managing to defeat the challenge that's
actually a nice thing
and this game actually gave me some
challenge
I've always prepared blink that's fun
thank you thank you for saying sticking
around the original have a good one I
hope you'll be mentally prepared for the
fireplace
yes I will be streaming uh I have
adapted update the schedule this should
be two hours earlier on Thursday Friday
so there will be more and more
after the dragonfly but what's the wrong
game a hairstyle on Thursday Friday next
week two hours earlier than the schedule
says I need to remember to update that
though and then I do have the Discord
when I just have the schedule too
adapt to your own timestamp
pretty neat
and also I post updates and stuff
it works the other in the podcast median
don't forget to follow if you want
to see me on the list of people
currently streaming which is kind of
useful
so
since I did watch
now it's my turn to paid FS Panda
FTW I don't know what the FS stand for
FTW is
say obviously
for the win
but I don't know what FS stands but
maybe I should ask that
[Music]
so anyway
yeah
FTW is for the win I mean that's that's
almost certain but FS that was the one I
was curious about those if you're a
subscriber you should have access to
this one
Daily Bread
if not well
you can always pay some points just
do a regular hype was 10 100 points to
get that one
and then just post it
it's the funny read message
otherwise I don't think there's more to
say I always continue our hairstyle next
week tomorrow will be Community drawing
I hope
it goes well I still don't know what to
draw so the first thing I will draw
tomorrow is an emote for someone
drawing
and while we might discuss what the
community drawing should depict they
should be like our personas of some sort
but we can discuss that on the server on
Discord
uh
let's see you on the
other side thank you all for coming and
saying sticking around there's a lot of
people I'm very happy about that
stream
foreign
[Music]
