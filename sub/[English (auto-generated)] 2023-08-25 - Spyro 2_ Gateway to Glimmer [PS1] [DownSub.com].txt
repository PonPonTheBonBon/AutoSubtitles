me out of here without rolling a two-ton

snowball onto my

head

well you seem

fine have bones straight through your

head so so maybe you aren't fine

I don't

know let's see yeah what's there

anything up

here doesn't seem like

it well looks like this area is clear

out oh no there's one

here oh nice no

nice

go

now

cration some bones constructions

here yeah I lost yeah I'll get it I

didn't mean to talk to you because I

know what I'm supposed to

do I mean I think I know they might have

changed look look at this snow L it's

it's a bit more

more more adult

looking

here sure he's walking

around this is not adult like it looks

older

than was what I was actually was trying

to say

see oh there was the ter

not and

oh right

do

oh okay let's do

this okay going to do

this there we

go

was it

like is hexagonal

ho behind

you now you're good leopard let's go on

an

adventure

let's see where should we

go what happens if I fly over

here yeah

work you found George I'm so glad he's

safe I'll be sure to pay more attention

to him from now on yeah do that please

put put put a leash on you something

that chewing sound do you like the

chewing sound should maybe place the C

camera they face the microphone towards

me I don't have a

camera oh I'm not sure if I want to show

my face not yet at least maybe someday

in the future no promises

though

now let's see how easy this is

see flying has to wins that makes

[Music]

sense oh this is

slow I saw the flying should be

fasting oops guess I missed that

one I guess I miss that one

te

and that's

icon and they already

repated

yep really why am I bad at

this

[Music]

there we

go and then

wao you have saved us all from a Grizzly

fate please accept this orb as a small

token of our thanks they seem there to

not be causing much

trouble oh wait it's this l i remember

when L was trouble at this

part yeah yeah she Str a bit I strug

with here too it's not too

easy it has its

uh difficult

parts much I don't remember if she made

it or not let say she did I believe in

[Music]

there chst gler

[Music]

complete it's that instrument that is

not called something but called

something else

I must must

read misre last

time I must read

it I'm good at flying controls no man's

sky can attest to

that that seems

dangerous

at least at least no

death 400 pressures

[Music]

found

so now he

s wonder why he wasn't swimming yeah

pick that up don't leave it behind let's

move on to the next

World skios bad

lands and's see how this goes and then

then I will add some Point start the

U um prediction I should prepare that

was the thing I was going to prepare to

my phone so I could just spread the

button to

[Music]

an squ there we go that's

it so

W look at the

things oh I

missed oh it turned black

nice pleas

have

[Music]

no

let's all right I can't I can't Flame

the flames

oh that was close don't you

die but are you good at Spyro flying

controls that's the

question hey you killed the father what

you did is

[Music]

you

go then there is

a thing of

there

so I need this

thing look at the low fall of that

one can we get

close

next

shot okay let's take out this

one like

that

point that's the sound bones

make excuse

me

yeah how many times he count

bounce it's such a weird sound the bones

make let's

see what this think I

need might actually not need

this there's another one there okay

16

when I can't access one yet but it CS as

an

enemy so I'm at 14

[Music]

now I just need to

sply spiderfly controls they don't give

me problems I'm just bad at finding

everything spe even though everything is

linear quite linear I guess first SP is

bit trickier I think the third SPID is

way they made they made everything way

too

lar 15 just one

more there one there we go there's an

enemy that's

16

now it should be

active this the icon is a

shield it turns red just like the fire

power fire power

turn

aha you can't hurt me because I'm

Invincible I'm no longer invin you can

hurt

me I guess I never noticed that they're

linear I just go after the next

objective find it's not intended world

but I guess that's

your that I guess that is the issue

[Music]

then that that would explain it so

look I got through the whole place

without P the lava made it through the

bad lands I made it through the bad

lands so what's my reward gilo's balance

tman a bone a very decorative bone

though very nice bone you

got I'm invisible you're ah

Looney the whole okay but I haven't

watched that

so so I don't get to

reference then no no don't die

spy I made a terrible

mistake

let's a bone give it to Jake from a

dog's life oh there are like nine bones

in this one pman and eight bones need to

Pi out arguably there are more bones the

bones you don't have to be

kept there are these bones but those

aren't bone shaped if that makes

sense they are bone shaped but

not not the dog life bone

shaped this is the odd part

where

they have made it geometry in but you

can stand here in regiz try there's no

such platform in this game this is the

intended

rout the rout route I don't

know and then pick up

this here we

go and then I have

[Music]

these

and let's explore the

fire bone shape but not a dog bone

shaped when dog GES do have quite a lot

of different bones

so so dong bone shape could be many

different shapes let's see if I can get

this

one oh I flamed underneath

it

oh I got it as I FL

nice and what's the bonus bonus point

for

that I do hope the stream delay is much

less

now let's take a closer look at this

thing by the way it has spikes on the

back one Spike on the head spots

everywhere quite quite the details to

put on a character in PS

one first I can put my friend back

together please take this as a token of

my appreciation a fairy left it with me

a little while ago a token yeah I'll

take your

token it's good today L than seconds

that's that's nice very nice here's the

original

DS D

it spooky scary SC

skons okay but

um I missed a few things in

here Al this supposed to be Lava or is

this some kind

of yogurt

soup that was a

maybe not that but yeah I could see like

uh

strawberry jam mixed with yogurt I don't

know the chili yeah it could be

chili some

some tasty

chiny I guess I'm

need stop fing out the evil

doers you

meanies okay what do have one

left

wa

I got a

Bonus skill point

achieved so this area is cleared

out and there should be

these maybe the last gems nope are the

gems over here Spyro our village is

being overrun by lava lizard okay I

better take care of that quickly cross

the bridge why do I have to cross the

bridge bridge just

crossed I didn't make that joke

work missing one there it

is the the Bri Bridge has been crossed

the bridge cross I'm drag not s how how

rude L we right back

okay 22 orops uh-oh it looks like more

lizard eggs are dropping down are I

don't see them oh hey they come they are

dropping down no they're not okay they

are yes I guess they

are

okay wait where are they oh there they

are

stop no they can't where are

you

uh that one

died that was one NPC you died okay

let's do this more efficiency later

okay so much for being more

efficient

on so they throw them up then swallow

them and that's when it ends and it ends

with a cut scene of them being thrown up

and then small on

again it's like a

replay okay

now

then this one there we go thank you for

helping us again Spyro you deserve

another shiny thing I

was I guess

so yeah I don't want to do it because I

can't about you now I did this for the

one so um oh yeah yeah yeah I I know

which gems I'm missing I'm missing these

gems it's somewhere here oh I did reset

because I failed the mission I didn't

die but it was considered a death but

without a loss of life thank you again

for doing

that

uh and I was and and I and I had a good

Dr and everything and game just stats to

me

does that happen re

United I mean it preferably shouldn't

happen just

annoying and the sport time is over even

though this is not good Dage was SP way

so now it's back to the pink

dress I like pink

dress interesting enough I don't have a

pink dress like that in real life

so it's not based on like address I

have the sport where I mean I do have

sports

way it's not designed that way that

sport way I do have like a black sport

BR

[Music]

and and a black

skirt even though this PCH way is more

like dark

purple and the

uh yeah let's let's be

usful look at

camera

oh

well I'm

back the swimsuit is based on a real

swimsuit and the real swimsuit was

actually a Hello Kitty swimsuit so it

does actually have Hello Kitty Runing a

unicorn yeah sorry for need the

immersion no but um I'm not sure if

iion but of course h kit has been

removed from the design a pon pon is

wearing cuz for obvious

reasons could have a different character

riding a unicorn or just have the

unicorn but n

let Legend has it that there is a portal

to Zep here and yeah what did he do with

it thanks for yeah I need to go to se

this is probably my least favorite level

it's probably it's mostly for the theme

of the level and how the long level

is I'm not a person who likes more even

though I've said that there's a there's

a war game that I do want to play but

let's

deta that's a weird looking

bird

but it didn't seem to cause much harm no

camera dude

died

meow no more meowing

okay I ran straight down into

that when did it swallow it I understand

it's like keeping his M mouse or

something but it's swall is

it at least that's what it sounds like

but I guess I don't know what it sounds

like when you put a bomb in your mouth

without swalling

it but maybe they do swallow

it

um and then they have a very

strong oh ability to puke up it

okay which

is I need to be quick

early there we go that's what I need to

do oh

[Music]

[Music]

pyramids can I shoot it from

here yes there the other

one yes

these and that's

somewhere

oh you found some

baskets oh wa there's another platform I

need okay I miss the gam anyway oh these

are other things with a name that means

something dirty in Polish and yeah it

means fees

medicine I mean I'm not sure if it's

thiry oh you went the wrong

[Music]

way

cow yeah they're not called cow in

Polish there's no Polish translation on

the PS1 version though

but in reignited they're called the

spotted elephants but with Polish words

of

course and I don't know what those words

are on top of my head

[Applause]

that's four out of

five hey there you are trying to flee

are

you

perfect thanks Spyro here's a little

something you know for the

effort you know for

effort there are two more cck out there

somewhere but I haven't seen them in

days the Wayne he she actually speaks

inited

the the way effort is phrased really

makes it really makes it

sarcastic you know F I actually don't

remember how it exactly was yeah let's

see

how easy it will be to bring these

over

nasty or nasty what

[Music]

what

anyway

cuz that it's it's standing in

position there you go wasn't so hard was

it that Fant I mean no I don't want to

speak to me

oh I don't want to see the cut scene I I

know where to

go with the beautiful

bird isn't she a lovely

bird she's a bird in two

[Music]

ways let's put you there I need to get

on

one

cook the bird U is that is that an ex oh

it's over there is that an ex flammable

mod you want flaming the uh bird while

her feathers gets burned

up doing

like a

naked cartoon looking naked

bird

yes well I guess um you have to remind

me second can right down the

[Music]

least I need least of every single NPC

that it had

like potential to uh be flammable and we

shall

not

Bas

on yeah

no oh

[Applause]

and now where where are you going you

have one place to be in stand there what

a bounce

[Music]

they removed these sounds from reignited

or did they didn't add them because they

make the game from ground up it's

possible they removed it because it

would be I don't know to tiring to hear

it over and over again I not going

understand that choice no it's escaping

well I am impressed you got all seven

cic for me here's I haven't impressed

when you are pressed and when you're not

pressed you're

[Music]

impressed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

[Music]

good

a you're free run run for your

knes be free don't feel

trap you can't do that in reignited cuz

you

can't you can't affect them after they

have

been you can't see it cing like the

whole mle is shrink down to that tiny

point and the green SC you see is like

being scen through the geometry which

you shouldn't be able to

see I don't came me my

seeds Spyro my boy I've got a magic bean

I mean seed for you in here somewhere

here it is why don't you plant it in the

ground and see what

grows do you like the SpongeBob

I see Pon is one of those window

salesman that break

Windows now what makes you think

that what an

animation you think I would go around

and you think I'm going to tell to tell

that C Herer that the C has been

escaping that and that I can get them

back for

[Music]

some um

orbs P want her

seeds I want seeds

yes all like SE and SpongeBob again I

will not stop with such

land exactly our princess would never do

such a bastardly thing what's such such

a Rd thing to

assume okay I'm apparently terrible at

this

there very shiny see

it cow and the rest of the section is

not a pule anymore it's very

straightforward look at this

one need the bottom platform remove it

to make it a bit

harder

and then this

one there he

goes look at it

go but I'm happy to see that you're

still here Jor J wait Jan J well done my

boy thank thank you thanks let himself

we

go and went to the dark

side go you go

there yeah he does this STL I

imine hydrate yes and swing

over

[Music]

no

aha yeah and

then can I place it yes but the whole

platform shrinks

interesting it does not do that in Rite

seems more complicated having a whole

platform chain shape let's see the point

of

it okay here we go here's the bar

have Beauty Romeo Romeo wherefore art

thou Romeo oh there's Romeo you can have

this I don't need it

[Music]

anymore

hi that's a straight straight

L my flying

such an awkward

[Music]

animation

well let's go

down how I've missed my Romeo if he

wasn't so short we'd get

married y putting

those Heights really matters

apparently wow

by and yeah this

like I've also seen quite the many many

people who like requires their date to

be a certain height before they even oh

[Music]

rainbow before even being considered a

date and that they

just saying that in the game without

actually making what any form of joke I

about I know it just feels

weird you mention that last

time and I watch another player play

that it to be weird yeah I don't care

the height of someone I'm

dating it's not anything you can really

[Music]

control

but I mean if you're not attracted to

someone being at certain height you

can't really control that I do

so but maybe not be

like he having

like like completely ignoring people not

even giving a

try anyway do care about what they are

like

exactly what's the personality

interest do to do weird

stuff boom oh that doesn't look

safe can I get the birds from

here

yes I can I don't need to because I

don't get any chem from him

[Music]

but we stff is must POS

voice they

wouldn't wait

where I I get otherwise but the they

won't be in

is is that what to

say yeah

yeah yeah

they two weird people together oh look

they are free they're wondering

about and I was not CA of the

main

oh all

gems looking at white animals wow what

an explosion it sure is a good thing I

had my helmet on yeah otherwise you

might have damaged

something my cousin is so tall that I'm

up only to his elbow and I'm

182

[Music]

182 did that package change size it

didn't even look and then it jumps to

the

side these animation is so

awkward it's to in

blank I feel like black jacket would

have protected one

black jacket

I

black

anyway well done Spyro black

jacket by the

way I'm

not I I think I've heard it

before so I wasn't even sure if it was

I'm Still Still yeah I'm I'm

not than eyes I wasn't sure if there was

sh eyes or squishy

eyes because it was kind

of let's do this in one attempt mean I

could have P for that

but how many atts would it take me for

doing

it

let's see does it work yes it does work

like rain but rain it works like this

game okay I should not miss speaking of

not

missing here we

[Music]

go and then this

[Music]

one wo wo

wo

no

what yeah that's why they called slow

signs in reunited even though they Chang

it to a more General exclamation point

which is more I guess International even

though they are following

the and you see the

I don't even know that

is the sign of

it there you go one

attempt uh a FL is worn by bomber crewes

to protect from sharp sharpel and

Bol we we've been having a crime problem

here in Metro Speedway but I think you

might be able to help a band of cat

burglers have been raiding my reelection

funds by scaling a cat a a band of cat

Burgers I know it's burglars

but come on Hunter let's do this I see a

cat

Burger than

see using this sound of the

I'm going for that

one not enough to Tim

me w

[Music]

w oh

it looks like you missed one no I didn't

I mean it L on ground I

didn't it's just a stupid asn't

reignited you shouldn't be able to fade

that one because it just lands on the

ground then just pick it up

anyway we go that

one

[Music]

oh

die I final

one it's there

whoa well second try you really taught

those Cooks a

lesson oh now now they crook wait how

can I turn that now I can't think of

similar

words I main this trap

now yeah SS like a good thing to have in

such a

be wa

celebration see Speedway is

easy next words now it's time to help

the birds defeat the glogs what are they

slugs slugs not

glogs all right the

floating

stick

when such a conflict

have how long before the next boss um

the is the oh

oh all

right

[Music]

um You mean I should start the

prediction yeah maybe I should start the

prediction we get starting get people in

here cuz I do still have

like one two three levels that completed

and it's uh this

level and three

more I have four

more so I'm not yet even halfway no I

want to

close there you

go

and been 1

hour and I'm almost halfway this do not

look these look so

[Music]

weird

[Music]

okay

[Music]

up

[Music]

you so I

could do I

know I'm starting if r

coms but uh otherwise I don't know when

I should started there like five watch

we got like two

active

B I was want to see if we could get like

more I guess I guess

not it's fine I guess I guess I can

started because it will be lasting for

half an hour but if it's but if it's

going to take me

like more than 1 hour before I even get

to the

b

anyway

oh they are reacting too wait or is it

just the animation of the movie let's

see I don't

know I do know I got someone extra

[Music]

lives

no I

didn't

okay perect thanks Spyro you're welcome

he ask what about need to show

up the

f I didn't maybe it was just the startup

animation when it wigg like

that had nothing to do me jumping on

[Music]

Fe

W

so two gets rid of every single enemy

it's still not going to

be before us C day it's still not going

to be enough for the track for the power

up for this one yeah I I need three more

but I think there's only two more

enemies these two

enemies

because those metal things apparently

does not

count which means they can just increase

the counted by anyway change

anything it's

smoking

wa that look

dangerous I think we enable these

two exactly both are enabled but but it

won't fly not

here there you

go not until you get rid of this thing

then it will start flying

which doesn't make any sense logically

there you go no start

[Music]

flying what sense does that

make give me the T for getting our ship

fired up it sure is fire up re

Talisman yay get over it by

SP but I do still have that track thing

enough to

do let's go to that track

thing there's a spring power

[Music]

up is this all

G nope no wa no wait there's one more

how lucky for me that you came along

yeah

right which get that's last

one the last

gems I don't you need

to you don't need to move out it's

automatically out out

moved ding ding ding

ding let's see one try

I wonder if she should shoot

perfect

jump TR to

Charlie hello Rocket Man okay now now we

things now it doesn't make any noise

anymore this

boxes oh it

remers it remers said that it had

dropped

one for some reason I want remember that

they are set

in could be there we go if I just didn't

do that F jump I would have done it in

one great work

Spyro oh well only have for about half

an hour lunch break so I'll give my good

luck good because I want to start our

prediction and I will start it

now and that is how many attempts I will

do on the the

boss did it work it didn't

work I didn't update on my phone for

some

reason because it's fixed to all it

shouldn't be fixed one there you go

there it is but now we can do the

prediction uh everyone who wants to do

the prediction it's simply how

many where last

G how many attempts oh yeah I didn't go

back to be and pick up

the how many deaths not attempts how

many deaths will I have during the boss

battle and I'll simply give it my

best and the prediction timer is well

half an hour you have to you have on

your to put in your

points and if you know how prediction

works

there they

are D need go back all the way I've done

this every single level now it's a

tradition you'll do it first time well

then you can vote zero on the

prediction if you believe that's

true you can vote for any amount of

points from one point up to the totem

amount of points you

have and then

uh when regardless how much points you

put in that doesn't change how how

much uh payout it will be for uh for

everyone who predicted the same thing as

you the payout will be every how much

everyone else has predicted with but

your payout in the end if you're not

alone will be split among you and others

based on

the proportions of how many points you

put

in that's how it works and as us shall

if which I the rule I run with if no one

wins because what if the option that

wins has zero people predicting

it technically zero

points uh leave then I will refund all

the points because I just don't want

points be thrown

away but that's no

fun I have a good feeling that's

great now I wonder if everyone of

everyone is wrong I mean there is a Poss

because we only have zero deaths and six

plus death we don't have any from 1

through five so if we land on one

through five then there are no

ruers hydrate yeah shall shall

you let's go to

Scorch with those creepy

[Music]

children sound

[Music]

I oh damn that kind of why I sh them

there I just told you just I

just I might have momentarily ignore how

good you're in all

games

well well well hopefully we'll see if

you win how much do you

15 over 2,000 points so this is going to

be

exciting well hopefully people predict

those other values as

well get

some

oh

okay sh

getting ready to shoot me time to see

bamboo bamboo

Bamboo hello hello SP my boy how okay he

you

shouldn't I think there's a switch in

the tower that will wa wait wait

wait okay

[Music]

whatever

nice yeah I will I guess I'll report the

results

M time

to do do do did you come to meet the B

from your

rocket rocket

man those are the most unsettling shink

guys ever we should look we should look

at those oh no hter

here we should look at those shink more

escaped from the Avalar zoo and okay

let's let's do

it monkeys have escape from

the are these

monkeys those monkeys looks like the

those are very interesting looking

monkeys and also they do I see bounds

and then they are tree

[Applause]

nice on you got in the way does this Mar

sure

aging oh oh

mine there we

go nice thanks for your help Spyro fire

almost died again

Hunter so are we now in to5

territory I mean I have not even gotten

to the bus

yet uh oh I see what you mean by my

question is uh a bit confusing I guess

it's the exact same question as previous

time no one mentioned that the question

might be

Mis

misinterpreted as how many days it would

take for me to reach the bus h no it was

so this I suffer to the bus

itself I guess I'm not sure how would I

face

it how how many that's facing B

two

I want this act suppos to I guess to

work so might be a better decision to in

I guess yeah in could work

here I kind of

[Music]

yeah

I do wish though that TT had a

description field for prediction because

I can just well add a description

because this prediction is

premade

and

yeah and oh now miss this

one oh this stuff around

here then I could like clarify more

exactly what saw which I think would be

a good

idea okay car wants to show the f words

properly we

go back

here did I miss something

no no no I I

didn't or that's against boss yeah

against nothing wrong with this two Bots

though since that's a short for this do

two BS oh like

that's yeah I guess that's short for

this do you know the muffin

man just death in

boss or that's at boss or death under

boss or death during boss or Death

Around

boss

okay okay now

let's let's let's listen to her

company Spyro you make a great secret

agent now handle and I can complete our

mission by the way you can have this

Towman I stole it when the soldiers

weren't

working weren't working this still

looking but she said

looking

when they you can charge them but you

also get KN

backing of

funling wait what what are you talking

about I don't know how we me you that

though yes I know the muffin man who

lives in r

that's a

big m is even bigger in reunited mission

was successful but the flag keeper keeps

stealing them oh yeah the flag keeper he

more

money my ugly sister was supposed to get

the flags I'm a much better secret

agent how you got captured she

didn't

you're both

ugly how about

that here we go flag keeper

bombo he's just sitting up there he

doesn't even have flying like that as in

like in

re oh he does have a flying

just tin want that flag a dragon well

two can play at this bombing game let's

go let's go I do want that

flag

that okay let's go then let's go let's

cirle he shoots them quite

straight didn't even try to aim at

me I guess this is just level

one so it's

fine great but there are still two flags

out there sure is shrinky

eyes yeah look at those shrink guys

blink he doesn't want to Blink he

doesn't want to throw up his shrink eyes

okay let's do it one more

time oh no no the politically incorrect

me

voice yeah they didn't like the

term

bombo that was a

bit I bit too much

maybe still after my Flags dragon

why does he sound

Italian just me knowing

accents yeah this is definitely much

easier

in wao wo wo okay he would not do that

inited though okay I ran straight to the

death one ha you won't beat me dragon I

will beat you

kind of tries to show them where I'm

going yeah you can definitely not run

for this much and reignited and I

mention they actually made harder

unintentionally maybe I didn't know

you're so close Spyro just one more flag

yeah there are some shinky ice he has

drinky eyes when he

speaks he said je that's so Politically

Incorrect what's so incorrect about it

it's common knowledge that jeans are jar

I think the only thing they well I think

they made two changes they made him a

puppet and uh he changed his name from

Bumbo to just

Bob and

so all I respect his CH be a je he just

need to sh sh his

[Music]

FL I get this what

in chest as always made

fire whatever the

f all right it's gone 1550 minutes on

the prediction and anyone else wanted

your

name we only

have cuz I I'm probably going to mess up

die once and and no

one so someone has one one

to

Illuminati there a no it isn't I don't

think there's a shortcut I can

take it's not that I probably need to go

up here it's just

[Music]

that

you won't get my last flag so easily

purple

Beast I am a purple

beast and do is without without stopping

my

[Music]

spring I technically stop spining

there ha you want

well let's try this again

then I guess you can call me out for

cheating

there on my own

terms I get the checkpoint I can

continue from

there

no you want be conf from here x f team

poin p

po I should be able to do this I'm

sh TR immediately now come on wa so long

before the first one aha see I avoided

that okay I guess this is my last

attempt and then I'll try

now let's

do

H that was

close no I was actually to smart with

that

one wa that was close

too

doesn't canot stop firing this continue

firing let's see there a fire away it

definitely doesn't stop fighing

that

why because real he only fires when he

moves backward otherwise he stops firing

since this

one

they also have made easier but somehow

harder at the same time cuz he here he

just fires all over the

place H and and the Spheres are smaller

I would

say is it easier or is it harder I would

say it is easier because you can

basically just run and run and run and I

would say that's really hard to do in

real this he shot

himself SP so that SPID SPID is purple

purple is a color is a color so green

the the all see eyes is confirm and his

new name re this is Bob which is three

letters and a triangle has three letters

and so what am I

missing I am missing a green

G at least there's no green green crass

that it could have hi

hiding I think I saw it before kind of

ignore I saw

[Music]

before

[Music]

oh she's

gone I it makes sense but she's not

going

be another the

difference oh there it is yeah I

definitely didn't see this

[Music]

before and mind

blo

bomb bombo Bob is a complete and utter

bad the that green good look very

omn

omnus it's very gooey and

greeny hey the pattern those arches what

is it supposed to

be

these

arches I don't

know someone T just

stretched

boom now look at this creepy

children

why does she have a

lipstick bulge

music Beau music is what it

says

3,450

gem handle and Greta are going to get

chopped

I didn't get sh shopped

photoshoop time for fracture

H and still time left on prediction we

got three people predicting so far

there's still still time for you to the

other two people are not yet predicted

to put in your

[Music]

predictions where's the backpack

music all I hear is background music I

don't hear backpack

music never

mind

jenies hello well hello there Mr Dragon

you're pretty cute for a quadraped I

wish I could take you on a tour of our

Temple but a bunch of lousy Earth

Shapers have encased it instead

well that's a

shame there go some back P

[Music]

music thank you for releasing me there

are still some Sages your mouth is not

mov s sat speaks with the

uh not sure exactly which accent it is

while the that just adds to my theory

that the

uh uh FS have moved here from a

different place cuz they clearly speak

with two different

accents I I have FL

play me like three

times h Hello Nifty boys here

one nice to see you I'm playing I don't

remember SPID 2 being called C in

E well welcome to the future or the past

the rain one sounds like someone's

trying to SC Scottish one but very very

badly out yeah that's kind of that's

kind of how it

be I

then the gateway to glimmer is the

international title of the

game well I guess Rocket Man would

be well versed in the Scottish

accents so I'll take you word word for

it but yeah the voice Act isn't great in

the original

game they kind of improved on those and

also kind of I don't know made the

phones also speak with us qu sections

which also kind of even though that

would make more sense if they live in

the same region as the

sers but the these creatur are so

aggressive but uh that means that uh

aora is for some reason not speaking

with Scottish

anyway time for me to go thank you for

being here with me thank you for taking

part in the prediction too I will report

back how it goes in This

Server have fun with your work or

whatever it was oh no I'm dying but I

might be back depending if you still Li

I'll be live for however it takes to

reach the B plus at least 3 hours enjo I

hope things go well I hope I hope that

to

[Music]

me have fun

later and also Nifty

boy if you press the follow button you

get three 300 points you can put towards

prediction you actually actually if you

just press the follow button and if you

don't want to follow you can unfollow

immediately and I pretty sure you still

get keep the 300 points because it you

only get 300 Point points like the very

first time you follow and then you keep

it

forever and I suspend it of

[Applause]

course cuz no one has yet to predict one

uh the one two

option

so oh look they got fox tails so my idea

for a mod or uh reignited because that's

the game I can't mod is to change aora

to look like the the fs from this area

and then redo her voice

acting it actually sounds the same as

these

[Music]

PHS okay let's be more careful

[Music]

now

I have to get pretty

close what do you you made a falling

animation and then you stop do the

falling animation I I'm out of knife I

Health

again come it

please

oopsy

21 uh no checkpoints no

[Music]

checkpoints thank you you're

[Music]

welcome okay

oh there we go that's what you should

do okay so I need to reill a bunch of

[Music]

these

wait yeah yeah yeah I can I can do it

that's no

problem I just don't know how many I

need to kill

I get a bunch of

them he barbecue dragon yay time to eat

it looks overcook though I wouldn't

suggest

e so that's four of

them and

then I have

this

take care that that

one and that

one and then we have this

one no you were

quickly they very

[Music]

quickies

[Music]

not stupid Beast stop attacking

me gave me Priss to attack

me I was kind of close to checkpoint

though I didn't pick it

[Music]

up how Dragon T just like

gator there being some

similarities I

guess

[Music]

oh time to pick up a peig

[Music]

again where do we have pigs over here I

think when it's quick just die and

P

[Music]

it's great to be free now there is only

one sa left to

rescue hey there is's only one left to

not sure how you like kept track of

that oh checkpoint apparently I die in

this

[Music]

[Music]

level

okay oh I hear

Beast

so that must be

enough since there's

another another phone oh a dragon

perhaps you can help my friend is locked

in this room and lost the key and you

know how hard it is to find a lock SM at

this time of

night they actually changed that dialog

night but she instead says do you know

how hard it

is stuff and you know how hard it

is interesting change of

dialog yeah so um well yeah timer is

over for now at

least so we'll see how it

goes also remove those for the

Simplicity of running across

here we

[Music]

go perfect you're free but you're

probably going to stay stay in here oh

immediately fall fa I might not fall and

uh but when I actually got

going I managed to hit

the thing without missing

song long enough for it not to look like

this now that you have rescued all the

saers in

fracture into the

temple

course

yes I will go to the

temple go and explore the

[Music]

Hunter stands but I can pick those up

later I should go and visit the

temple can I access Temple from

quiet anyway um the other fond wanted me

to give you this

Talisman

perfect um sorry if I sounded unfriendly

tiny is it just a single room in it and

I was supposed to explore it well I

think I've explored the whole Temple

in the middle

some yo-yo trick and a nice fluffy

tan anyway moving on I guess I guess I'm

done

here some flute music from that

bagpipe and I don't know if it's flute

music because I don't know what the

different instrument sounds like but the

Talisman is based on another instrument

H which I don't know the name

of and uh oh Spyro hello I was just

having trouble with this door and I

think some orb power might unstick it I

see let's see is

work no dropping way too much

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

H and jam from the down of course no

but is

back I'm back okay so I just need to

figure out how to get

well the world is I'll give you another

or if you can beat me again let's play

to 15 this time what do you say I mean

hunter if you lose at 10 you're going to

lose at 15 that's just how it

works trust

me

[Music]

but it looks like two was going

[Music]

up oh I tried to stay from

[Music]

me

now he got

[Music]

it there we go wait was way down on

ground even that

aha see what did I tell you really good

I'm going to have to come up with some

harder games how about you not make

harder game how about make mean games at

all I need those orbs to stop the

trouble some

one cost you

know even though everyone you stand

stood around when you fooling around

with the stuff so I mean not not that

it's their fault but they were kind of

just standing

there and then

like Professor has prob with his glasses

and now could just fly up here for some

reason without any

[Music]

reason that

weird anyway I think I'm done with the

upper area time to go into the volcano

volano okay at least it was somewhat

close it was somewhat close I SP I have

something that can help us stop rifter

but I'm not hand out you unless you beat

me at this game

well if it isn't my best customer the

elevator in the Next Room can take you

well listen is my favorite customer the

elevator need an

elator

let's do

[Music]

this sometimes sometimes it doesn't grab

sometimes it does care any to

it you're straight the ladder is

straight in front of you crab onto his

fire game thanks for closing the lid on

the volcano Spyro things were getting a

little too hot around here I thought you

no he just ignore the fact that it's not

for me R never would would arrived here

I'm not feeling the least be responsible

for his arrival

here yep that's why Hunter is my least

favorite character at least like

Moneybags has a motive like earning

money he actually will need to train

money for Stuff Spyro you're just in

time for the party well you let's go go

for the

party and if mon had any orbs he would

just totally sell them

top

CLS

one that didn't give us

[Music]

pled to fill up on this again let's

see I did miss that one can I turn

around

[Music]

yes no I wanted to shoot

you let

me got this

name

okay so

more

[Music]

energy

oh you kill enemies to give power to the

power up

thing but after you get the decide

amount you don't really need to kill

anym enies

this enemy counting towards the Power UP

doesn't really change anything

because well you need the power up to

even be able to kill this W that one's

flying

so but I guess they are

enemies there we

go

do not every enemy

[Music]

counts two

more few

more H let's see I see that I you read

another comment I get

it

[Music]

oh I saw

it thanks Spyro sa the party here this

got mixed in with the cheese balls and I

almost chipped a tooth on it oh that

sounds bad if byy B got kicked out of

his mansion by he could use that as

L and not have to pay my bags

all by I love to do this thing for um

two gems I could give you gems but when

it's you prer not hind me from helping

you clean a

mansion Mansions

Mansion wait are you saying that one B

owns all three

Mansions I I'm missing a

[Music]

five

I want to Castle than just

Mansions where is the F I'm

[Music]

missing it doesn't seem to be in a

balloon I might have missed it on the

upper level

[Music]

anyway no no

no

okay another the EAS is to fly up from

here got the turn radius is pretty

bad

yeah and I

guess

actually

let's see if that

works let me get build this up again and

then I take the elevator up and see if

it

[Music]

[Music]

remains

no it

disappeared oh

and place there five here

somewhere I don't see anything

shining oh there it

[Music]

is

it has been

found that missed it but

I mag my

complete in that case is it's more of a

palace cast are primary self sustainable

military

installations if you

say

you I did yeah me see again only reminds

me of doing K

okay which um I did once we could say

that was the 100 follower

karaoke and

then I've reached 200 followers now so I

can do the 200 follower

karaoke

whoa flight power oh they removed my

flight

power

I hope those are hands

clapping another

[Music]

this then I should think of a suggestion

or don't you already have a suggestion

[Music]

let's move on to the little castle I can

let you into the little castle over

there in exchange for a few gems oh

sure why

not 400 gems no no one has died of

giving up 400 gems I'm pretty sure

someone probably

have Shady OES sounds pretty shady

Hey where's Bob Bob oh he went home

yeah yeah yeah he had a thing here

needed to do

um um water his cat and uh feed his

[Music]

plants now some weird

animations I played like the PS1 version

of this game once in my life or

something a really long time it's a good

thing you're here I've been trying to

get a berry out of this magic Berry a

ber I can get you a

berry here we go that sounded

wet

what are you laughing

[Music]

at

oink oh know the peacock

died this is another that I need

power up

for I was going to test if I could do

that

thing so I could probably just

ignore level and come

back

[Music]

later doesn't even have prob a work

animation is Wiggles

drowning this just casually

drowning and I could unlike competitive

Jour sh guys I should be taking shots of

vodka for NPC which shrinking ice in

this game

die

just like the NPCs do do and that H

character sound like blink oh

no not

blink oh yeah the enemy died but I need

some health cuz I'm

dying this this screen

well I guess we need to listen more to

the

hippo oh my redeem button disappeared

well I guess you just have to close and

open the stream

again can I do

this can

I okay yeah you can fire them in the

back wasn't what was going to

try there a thing you can do in Dr is

much easier because they don't move

around so

much okay I got a one

flaming it does not work in this game it

does work inited because if you flame

them and then charge them immediately

that count as two

hits what are you

doing you're on the same team I guess

they are enemies so can not some animal

Ste spots

way uh yeah close open there okay I'll

be right back one more oh what are you

going for the place seems hot just like

you oh am I

hot well thank you I guess the outfit is

kind

of hot I would argue some people

probably find it to

mean quite short

talk I guess that's some

people enjoy

that can let's listen to the hippo again

and see if it sound like

blink man talk hitting the bush with one

of those lava rocks should

work that was the only

H yeah it kind of sounds like a

bling someone could check give it the

same

voice no that's not

sound wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle

destroy okay let's

see I

probably maybe should I take care of

this what is

that going

like

oh here are some baskets oh wait maybe

it may was here and yes there it

is and that's probably because I did see

Sparks in the

background that was a nice

detain I'm back oh someone else did this

Sports Spirit while I was resetting

yep Janet s that P Pon is

hot and redeem the sports sare which I

guess I can't agree

with funun is kind of hot

[Music]

looking

H can I get up there because my gems

there maybe if I get up high like

this yeah I mean I can do it but then I

can also

fa

chical

me there you go that's what I wanted to

do yeah I don't really need to pick up

all CHS because I need to come back here

anyway

so bo b

s sorry about

that hope didn't

hurt even in real life I think such a

tiny Fair wouldn't stand a chance

against this quite much larger Dragon

charging anyway that's get the Talman

thanks for helping me reach the great

berry bush now we can eat berries all

the time here we can eat berries all the

time yes

yes cuz that's not going to cause you

any issue

see the B brush is empty

now

sounds interesting I think I'll just

hang out here for a while and soak up a

few

Rays hey where did Laura go I better

follow

her I made a

[Music]

follower there we go I did

it I think I finally come up with a way

to access the dragon worlds from the

super portal this power Crystal should

give us the extra boost that we need

just a few more calculations to set it

up I think I have it excellent

everything is finally ready we're going

to need a lot more orbs but with the

power Crystal boosting it the super

portal should work

again didn't even realize the picture

was wrong anyway now it's

great so you thought you had got the

bomb actually exploded I'm afraid not I

persuaded that

Fatar to sell me a few B hter head sh is

real off yeah the power Crystal don't

even try it book boy or you'll be the

world's smartest pile of

Ashes size what he's talking Yep this is

just what I need for a new

scepter Hunter do something quick uh Hey

give that back well

tried well I tried

you little fools keep that you all with

my new is so useless rename this place

ronia power Crystal don't tell your T

how also really put up fight

yep that's slow motion

fall H so both Spire 2 and crash 2

introduce power crystals

okay interesting when they when they

introduce the same thing at the same

time eyes power

crystals Spyro excuse me I was trying to

Suicide out of the castle even worse

he's stolen our new power Crystal for

the super

portal if you can collect enough orbs

you'll be able to get the power Crystal

back from ripto okay let let me check it

word rude exactly he's

rude watch out for rude he will make you

rude he will rude

you he's

be missing I went down

there I I have all

ORS hello check your guide book by

pressing the start button and choosing

the guide book option to thank you for

telling me the thing I've been doing

multiple times Laura also what's a stock

button I don't know what the stock

button is

button

is do you think I'm so some kind

of do you think this is kind of video

game oh there we go there you go we got

a purple

message wish there was a part of the

game where you could just throw water

bags of a

[Music]

CLE well best I can offer is H A

flammable mod version for Moneybags that

will burn up his

clothes best I can offer did I leave

gems in here yes I

[Music]

did but that's not

enough misss here too so that means that

I have a five

left five

left I have left of five

somewhere hydrate yes that's something

[Music]

good I close the door myself

and I think I might have an idea where I

can left to find but no I what I G I was

thinking in here but apparently

[Music]

not would be

fun yeah maybe well that was complete

Fain

a complete

fail C doesn't help with that uh finding

the last gem

[Music]

no getting up on this platform

now oh the only thing I know is it's a

total value of five uh so it's either a

purple gem

two green gems and one red one green gem

and three red or five red gems no other

Poss no other combination of gems is

possible however since I'm not even

being able to

find any of them the likelihood that it

is five 4 Three Gems is very not

likely so it's likely just a

single single

there's no combination of two gems that

will result

in um

five I thought you had all gems from

this jingle was it the previous it was

prev some it says 395

4 how you try oh there it

is s for

[Music]

complete it's time for me to love yours

and leave yours I again but hope the

rest goes one

[Music]

way I think it was time for you you to

love us at any time rocket

man I love that you have been here thank

you for being here thank you for taking

part of the a um a prediction even

though it was a

failure uh it was still

fun what levels do I have here fracture

heels and Shady OES let's go back to

fracture

hands you not the

BU as only one said I'll be back who's

Arie

but thank you for being here this stream

went busy very soon and I will I'll

finish off fractor Hill and Shady races

and then I will start and then next week

I guess I'll start the next World y fra

H PS are

cute they are cute hello there Mr Dragon

they also made their other side of their

dresses pink

which makes it look like they are

having they were

panties thank you you

welcome I mean I do have exit level but

it's more fun using the real exit

because I use the real exit every single

time I can't stop doing it

[Music]

now

this is a bit quicker than R I don't

know why they added the there is a timer

here to but this time is so much

[Music]

shorter need a shorten timer in

R stop attacking how attack a single one

of your

[Music]

kind to be honest it's great the thing

is doing a little sh over there going

okay I'm going to attack you how does

that

[Music]

feel what happens if I rescue this but

anything that was interesting

something now that you have rescued all

because because not to be

rude it's very hard to see I

[Music]

guess yeah it's very hard to see but

they made the under UND side of the sers

green but for some reason they made the

UND side of the fs

pink it's almost intentional they wanted

you to be like

panties I look from no I

can't

anyway that's my view on the whole thing

I think

he just standing here in this empty

room I so oh he got something I've been

experimenting with this potion I'd like

to test it out but the Earth Shapers out

there have made going out a bit

difficult could you kindly offer me an

escort yeah I'll do an

escort he has black on

side sometimes it's not hard to see the

other side

oh oh

oh such a

bamboo will you and and other characters

like now but yeah but I guess if you

like to see pink underwear on the fonts

you can always add if you had a PC

version always install my flam

F this is going to be very tricky this

is much more difficult than United I I

can understand that people get upset

about having to that he's

deal I don't even didn't get my full

heal SP

well that's fun

[Music]

will

you so add that they are much quicker at

attacking you and

uh I guess that's that and there

[Music]

detention

I wish I had one more pink oh there's

one more

pink very

[Music]

nice pink SP all I guess I need this P

now yay

will you yeah I'll try my best I'm not

sure exactly how I'm supposed to do

[Music]

down

no he gu in the

way well that's how you do

it must will must ignore he also get has

like

a

[Music]

double

but anyway this is The Last

Enemy

oh he this

a man do my feet feel better would you

look after this for me why does it why

do you look so gray hun I I don't think

you I didn't think that that thing was

so good for

you you look a bit

sick

as long as you're here would you like to

help me take out these stubborn Earth

Shapers yeah they're quite stubborn

let's do

it boom one is dead wait you get from

those

immediately what happens if have

faing I'm going to

see then gets up does my c go back down

to four or as long as you're

here yeah it goes down SL again

interesting R does not do

[Music]

that so so this is a case where your

enemy count goes down is there an moment

he does

that

oh that's

one oh they get quickly and SP kind of

got stuck on top

of as

long good

bye thank you for stopping by H isn't

sick that's just how it looks not why it

looks sick maybe it looks more orange in

the side

[Music]

game and that's not how look no no no no

the answer is yeah Hunter is sick he's

sick and

cool I thought I called it Ma because

your app can't just hit them again as

long as you're exactly hun could just

shoot him once

more no he want a per being perfect some

for for some reason they also come back

to

life how how do you explain

[Music]

that why is she standing

way okay we'll do that

then

in front of

me get up so as long

[Music]

[Music]

as can't H

me

hit them in the crops it's kind of a

lower part of the body much easier to

like hit usually the

[Music]

legs there you go we make a great team

well you're a terrible teammate

though Dragon Flav pancake

[Music]

M can you like this on fire Prett sure

these are burning

Reed

yay hey go

so I don't know how I could see this

best like that I here some f

I can't see so hard to

see that's the best VI you

get no I don't want to talk to

you yeah it's very hard to see but it's

very

pink it was intentionally made it pink

for some reason good f serice

I'm serving my

fans but all of them are

pink but I said I do have the flammable

fonts mod which is made so you can

because you can burn all the leaves in

levels and they are wearing leaves in R

night days so why not be able to burn

their Le SE clubes that just makes sense

cuz you can burn all the other leaves in

level

but inite did actually didn't give them

panties I guess they were afraid of

this even though they're still character

with like

underwear in but like men on thewar and

that's perfectly

fine but I guess that's just how it is

Spyro

spal but they got two of them to

eat I'll take the other

one so I can grow big and strong like

you so I

can squash those

bs

anyway

and

yeah I can advertise my mod more and all

twoo of

them and the mod is made to look as

accurate as to original game as possible

so if you have the mod installed you

shouldn't be able to notice any

difference between while not having the

mod installed it should look the same

that's kind of point of mod until you

flame them of

course and uh then

they no longer wear the

dresses and have the full

body just eat

that but since they did have

uh one panties in the orig game this

game uh I made the I made an alternate

version where I did add P back to the to

the character you still you still don't

see a difference on character unless you

try to look up their dresses of

course was beside that there's no visual

difference I'll you flame them of

course I need to hold button I keep

talking about this

is and that's that's

it got in the

back here we go now we

home Spyro three thieves have stolen our

magical brass lamps yeah

sadly I have done

so let's take care of that if you have

if I had a PC to play it yeah we we'll

find a solution to

that

if you

were wait can I no don't drown that you

can't do that

spider he's too smart they have S about

that

going the wrong

way oh tricky

one they don't do that oh out totally

that was to

completely there you go one lamp

found only one whoa fruit fell from the

tree this time

and I only shot it once I guess I hit it

multiple times

before yay let's talk to Grandy my eight

brothers have been trapped in rock and

we'll sink in the lava if you can't

break them lava since this one is this

lava this is not lava

look she also changed color oh no your

brother died almost successful

Spyro almost successful my brother died

[Music]

want PR it I I do like that your

turn that's a that's a nice

I mean they have wings I guess they

can't F family but you've managed to

save all of them take this thing too I'm

too tired to carry it anymore well you

don't seem to care much if I may say so

SP still

go bashing Spar wait I already lost the

Sparks okay I need to pick up some more
