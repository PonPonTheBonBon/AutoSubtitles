if you don't okay so idea I go back to

playing the original crash games on

PlayStation because the first crash game

on PlayStation is quite the interesting

challenge

[Music]

Rocket Man you were given a present

dessert

on my way home from uh means you have my

phone oh yeah yeah I'm divided that

means that you have not shared they do

not share that attention with something

else it's 100 to me but yeah if you're

like

and

just keep driving or something

considering that

and that's that's not a suggestion

that's in order

you can they send to me that's fine

don't don't be

don't be looking at my streamline

oh yeah

fine fine in that case full focus on me

unless you're crossing a street

the worst thing can happen is that

you're working with someone but who

cares about that I mean people are

playing wasn't that like case of people

playing

um mango and

like I stood around okay let's switch

out with your original Crash Bandicoot

so that would be crashed all right I

forgot to add the

and the

the

console to the title

let's switch over to

position crash because the original

crack has this thing where you can't die

at all in any level if you want the

diamond

gem thingy that could be an interesting

challenge

I'm afraid I don't do that

yeah yeah well

then you have a problem

I think we have it now

because I do have the original

crash game I will actually play it on an

emulator but I do have during crash game

I do have to bring console I do have all

the necessary things

to play the game

I will only play it on an emulator only

because it looks nicely but as easy plus

I have packed down my console and I

don't have to fiddle around with the

capture card

I do have only necessary legal stuff to

be able to do this

because emanation is not automatically

easy

I do have a play Playstation 3 games on

my console and which is also like

because this compute is not going to be

able to handle the playing a whole

PlayStation 2 game if you can't play

like all the games

so

what's the uh

thank you

is it showing up

hello

there we go there it is

asog crash

I've been walking to and from work this

week my car is in the shop all right

Android told me when you knew that I've

kind of been bad at staking myself

I know like no slug in

Pokemon is the first Pokemon you find

you must capture if Pokemon paints it's

considered bad

I don't think I've seen the OG crash the

game in about 15 years well

in that case this would be nice

everything that would require you never

had a PlayStation

here is the OG Crush

in better quality than

on the OG console of course

we got fancy options like

[Music]

stereo

and you can only set this at the start

you can and then when you press start to

start a new game now wait I forgot the

whole thing

uh

I forgot what I'm saying we need to play

the intro of course

but I should set the pictures so we have

[Music]

push

there we go I think

it is beautiful

[Music]

so

there's no possible and there's no menu

you can only pause and then you can

press select to go back so anyway

and you can also know how to act like

you choose to watch the intro segment

you have to wait for it to play

as shown my age

oh you must be a young young lad

a smashing blast from the past

yeah that's what they say in the remake

so after you wait for a certain amount

of time

which moves on to the intro sequence and

it should play the intro of the game the

first thing it does

we have not determined the cause of past

failures

[ __ ] this Bandicoot will be my general

and he will lead my cortex Commandos to

World Domination this time I shall reign

triumphant

we are closer than ever before

quickly into the Vortex

Tex The Vortex is not ready we have no

idea what it could do

failure again

capture him

prepare the female Bandicoot

cortex has quite additional voice in

this game from Atlanta games

so that's that okay

and in this game

yeah like so yeah so this is the post

menu

which likes to quit game it doesn't even

have a pause menu even Spyro had that

this game is so um

basic when it comes to but yeah and yeah

because it doesn't have a problem you

cannot access options and if you set

Change option for example turn off music

and then you start the game and then you

save in the game it will save your

options and then if you go back to the

menu enable the music again and then go

to load the game

it would load that the music was turned

off so

same thing as we said I can never be

changed

anyway

and also so she is possibly unauthored

female benefits I mean is it crash also

on on altered I mean you cannot

I don't know how this game works it's

just finished anyway let's let's start

with Insanity Beach

the original game

and when they made these bouncy boxes

look at these bouncing boxes you get one

fruit at a time and you have to jump and

then ten times wait eight times

apparently

you're supposed to jump around 10 times

yeah apparently it's eight times or nine

times

all right that was not the attack button

okay here he has something like yep

yeah I'm not exactly sure how

World works and

well

well I guess I'll do this then

I guess uh yeah there's a timer

for when you start jumping on those

bouncy boxes the timer starts

and I guess

it takes so long to jump on them 10 10

times so the time Runs Out

before you jump on them 10 times

if you like basketball from an arrow box

below you can bounce the name okay okay

let's do this

[Music]

way

I have a time limit

perfect

I think that was all of them

okay let's see I guess I need to go back

and check them just to be on the safe

side let's see there's a turtle here

there it is

double masks that's your check that I

didn't left one because I jumped yeah

empty beautiful that means all boxes

oh the boxes

but into the weird machine to make him

like this

now let's check the show

wasn't he put into the main machine I'm

not actually sure if they put like a

real animal into the machine and then

make them answer because he is an astro

before he's put into the machine so if

you've done more stuff before

[Music]

yeah the same reading memory card the

memory card should be empty

any moment now

because since this emulator should no I

said it on a Junior game come on

there we go that's too long

and

this game should

you should have a separate card the

memory card part okay

[Music]

yes

what's that so this level I can't get to

the gym so I will ignore boxes

this means that you have to spin it away

[Music]

I saw that was jumping too short day

last second

that's a risk to falling down the road

there I need a green shampoo but I can't

pick them up buddy

is this yeah that's one contain that one

but I don't want you to like there's no

point of doing the bonus because

wow

good life

because I don't get anything from it

and also the

I think everyone is using this one yet

bonus

I can I can survive without them

let's take a voice gangs well they try

to attack me

oh no I miss breakfast yeah I know only

five though that was interesting I

missed more

got the life in exchange for AKO akos

I mean that's more side would you drop a

mask to get them uh actually this one I

can't get the gym on either

so I don't need to pick up the boxes

be right back okay but you're missing

the game

yeah it does definitely being slower

than

than

a trilogy

I jumped on it

it doesn't kill us

missing The Great Gate

yeah

beautiful gate

wow wow it doesn't

quite a lot forward money pounds

so the air movement isn't perfect

yes here we go

let's do this don't move up

yeah and you know that one

[Music]

running series level

he's now carrying the worm absolutely

absolutely bloody stunning gate exactly

the banging gate

although if you get this banging maybe

you should check that

yeah you can run a few boxes 11 of them

and some boxes I couldn't access so

your your gate is banging oh thank you

so much no no it's it's actually making

quite a lot of noise

hydrate

suddenly

this level I can get the gems so I will

do so

I will however not need the mask because

it's

interesting message

bouncy things

that would be an awkward

don't really need the Box take this take

this outfit and folder we're taking

point and let's go jump too early there

but it was fine

tattoo

something nostalgic about being on music

did you reduce

which makes sense I mean it's

it is Australia

and there we go

another gym

this is like that one scene from Indiana

Jones but with a brand cute and not

Harrison home

[Music]

and in Crash one es is someone you could

access all 15 save slots from the memory

card and choose which one you say so one

save slots in Crash takes up one slot on

the card in crash two they decided to

make it

four same slots in one memory card slot

and one one of the 15 spots only

this one I can't get it

pajamas maybe maybe this one was the one

I keep getting

let's try to get the gym

because there's two watch levels

one of them I can't get a chairman

and one of them I came

and this one might be the one I can get

at him if I die I'm not going to

restart because I could be wrong

because I was playing series and

reignited them

I was wrong about one of these

fun

around

can't be wrong I cannot be being wrong

okay let's proceed

this one requires gems okay

come on then

I can ignore the boxes

do

foreign

water level that you can get the German

and then I need to remember which level

doesn't actually have the color gems

because it's those I came those are

heavy so you get

and you were wrong that's the first wait

[Music]

oh yeah I was wrong

I was wrong

by the way he's still gone

excuse me sir

excuse me sir I'm trying to hit you

I guess I can

take him out while he's spinning to me

so I like that

speed running

against a defeated that boss

Rolling Stones this one requires the

blue gem I'm back

now it is I am a bag or I have a badge

like this

this one contains yeah I don't need that

bonuses are completely useless

this box

I think this is a change in reignited

because if you bounce this one whoops

seriously four five six seven eight nope

I bouncing around

no bonus for me

well almost stepped off the platform

there

I got it back

I don't need to care about this

[Music]

I'll have to take that one

I see satellite and now I get 20 of them

well it's an Xbox

another bonus

you know I can't change

and if I think the third bonus is

reignited not to reignite the Trinity

and century

bye bye bonus yeah bonuses are useless

they only give you extra life

and here this is the location of the

third bonus

by the way battleship

didn't they change that in the trinity

don't remember

don't you remember

oh yeah and here is the this at

the final location with that hand maybe

that one was moved

me

some some of those I mean

feeling more skunks yeah this I mean

crash is stupid because everything

and you can only say when you get

something

[Music]

this one you can also get the German

let's get the jam on

[Music]

let's see how many attempts this one

thing that should be a

prediction

how many times did I restart

let's say hi

watching two three stars

okay from now on ahead we have to

restart

[Music]

there's one set of boxes that are really

treated again

there's nothing yeah like that one oh

wait

I'm not supposed to die

this is his Trinity

yep

hog the level

let's try again I should get the Gem

ah she can't teach him

and I'm wasting a Life by dying when I

didn't eat it

dude

[Music]

that's that

wasn't one thing

so so basically how many times you want

to spend in this

gem when I get it

second attempt yeah there we go

all right

back

okay and then this part is tricky oh

first attempt

so tricky

I remember his videos

I can't remember this old lemon

I'm doing this so many times

remember America on that side but I

think that's a gym

at least we get to watch the hog level

this time I remember in the city lying

so much you had to pass the stream to

clean it yep

that was terrible

hey I got it it only took two times so

whoever predicted one to two won that

one remember they didn't set up

application it's the best level in the

game

now I prefer actually walking as trash

to be honest

yeah I won

this one also requires a gem

well

I'll take that

there's a few I get 22 nice

I guess 22 kilometers

hey time for the ever a greater gate

even here I mean it's it's ever a great

thing that's that's

what we say now

Oh no I got the bonus token what did I

think when I was guessing it would be

alive for me

now

[Music]

oink oink oink

three fruits just like that

I actually don't remember that phrases

remember actually

but it is a phrase is in an African song

as you can see a bit silly for a game

taking place in Australia

where everyone speaks sweet and

actually don't know where specifically

which country do people the actors are

from but from

a North American accent at least

exception thing about who actually has

an Australian accent for some reason

everyone should have it

except cortex he is from the United

States

so if he speaks like he's from United

States

that's fine

that's not a life detention that is a

bonus token what about bonus tokens

yeah to me when I first time I saw the

bonus tokens I thought it was like

meant to be like

let's call it the card in landscape with

with the picture of her face on it but

it's obviously her hair

I had such a trouble seeing that and I

still have a job seeing that

should I go for it

and here we go

thank you

and here we got something interesting

native Fortress I remember this one gave

me tons of trouble yeah

and and here am I just

reaching through it and I died

I was curious until that night

this is a pinnacle of gates yeah I think

if speaking in an Australian accent then

or text us

[Music]

can you speak in English

wait I think each speaking of an

Australian accent then cortex does

and you want you inserted somewhere in

there where would you go in that

sentence

can you please rewrite your sentence

I think if you okay I think if you speak

in a certain accent then cortex does

wait why I do I speak within us

sorry sorry I'm I'm so confused

I'm so confused

between if you speak in Australian

accent then cortex I still don't get

what you mean by that

[Music]

accent yeah and speaking like a weird

mixed Swedish

a different English accents combined

into some weird funny accent in an

internet Japanese now

thank you

I feel there's a language player with me

yeah because I don't understand your

sentence

um

can you translate this sentence to

English for me

I wasn't quick enough

I've only got 24 more extra names

I only got 23 more extra attempts

[Music]

I guess whatever I speak he doesn't mix

with bunny yeah when you you speak like

Scottish English that doesn't mix with

bunny apparently

and apparently comes across in

everything more empty

it's too different I mean I understand

what most mostly most of the time I just

don't understand that sentence he's just

upset hey

now this is going to work okay

okay apparently I can't stand there

okay concentration now upon you can do

this

in this crash game all animations as far

as I know

has been animated by manually

determining how all the vertexes should

go they are they have not used but which

is called Armature or skeleton with

bones they have not used stats to set

the animations

they're painstakingly animated every

where it explains the manually not many

of them

so they could do that

let's set another practitioner nowadays

there we go

that's how we get across

I think there's a lunch party with me

yeah

I understand

I was trying to trick you into speaking

all things

that

[Music]

could I might foreign

extra knife in there

there's excellent here too

yeah I said I don't know how to speak

with an Aussie accent an awesome accent

but yeah crash and Coke wasn't speak

with it

yeah this is one I can get to the

channel get the jam on

and uh

I will dips

of course

um

cortex can speak with whatever accent is

from whatever region he's from

I don't remember where is United States

you come from but it's written on the

moon

and then for all other scientists were

and or other bosses and stuff

they speak oh yeah they can speak with

their accent they're from

but I mean crash and kill for our bank

it's off the screen they're taken from

Australia

well sleep tough day

that means no Jam for me

as easy as I might at the end of the

sentence might oh I put the shrimp on

the bar did I see shrimp

remember to watch that prawn but it's a

background why is that not what's going

on

not Australia might but yeah it is more

more than that

[Music]

maybe just uh

New Zealand but you should load the air

to E

but maybe let's see New Zealand English

not Australian English

[Music]

so instead of saying dress he said there

is

and that's what they joke about when he

wants the deck you see it's pronounced

as dick instead

[Music]

that's why so when you play play a card

game you ask your opponent to cut your

dick

and I'm only speaking with the new scene

index in a very very important is in an

accident so

there's not nothing suggestive in that

sentence

but if I'm not too strong a rocket man

can't correct me but a Scottish accent

because I kind of heard that from rocket

man that is about sex and it kind of

like I made my own conclusion based on

recommend speaking that it's kind of

diverse

that but there was stuff down there I

didn't intend to go down I extended went

off but that's the

a

so

it's it's called a pin pen merger that

they go together and you see that I say

pin and in Scotland is a pen but I could

be wrong about that

so it was did you get the opposite

effect when uh when he in Scottish you

want to say

uh well actually what they think it

sounds like deck

but yeah correct me from wrong

because I this is an 18 plus team so I

can say I can say this as much as I want

genius there you go

I don't know otherwise foreign

but

yeah because I need

oh yeah noise

instead of saying I say oil there you go

your comment there

and when I am very samples a knife on

you you tell them that's not a knife and

draws a large a Bowie knife and

telephone this is annoying no voices

no I know I need

here we go

don't collect inboxes

have I skipped the boxes I think it

needs one I think you missed one

if I get to the end and Mr Box and jokes

on me then

okay

then anyway I have to restart now anyway

so

I had to make a beach jumping on this

morning I wasn't sure but I don't know

so yeah I said my name is

knife noise so

what more do you have

to always on your face anyway

if you stop it

pronunciations changes are usually

consistent

[Music]

never missed a box what are you talking

about

Oh you mean I missed this box yeah

why do I keep doing that

why

why why so why do I

do that

yeah that one yeah

that one that one

[Music]

thanks instead of saying that is that

I think that would be

funny

okay

okay

okay

very funny

I was laughing

you keep doing that because you enjoyed

this level and

how often you want to spend as much time

on it as you can please know me so well

I mean aesthetically it is a nice level

and I think they

they are really pushing the places with

this game

and if I remember correctly

the uh

Sonic Developers

themselves were surprised about how far

this game is pushing the console

well I almost did the same thing again

because I mean just visually this game

looks really good compared to a lot of

other places in games

foreign

no mistakes

uh yes this level in particular looks

very good for playing season one

yeah yeah

nine

do that to me I will ignore that live as

you're wasting life

[Music]

don't do that to me that's just a rude

what

is

there we go I'm swearing a stream one

punishment kidding me really

when you're such a 40 miles now

yeah

in here

again I did not fall off the platform

this time

play it for us

but I was holding the jump button

I'm a bad influence

yep

[Music]

I

yeah so yeah my goal is to basically

completing as many games as possible to

100 or like at least finish the story I

do have a table of each game I'm playing

and if I'll completely 100 or completely

[Music]

and also in which games I have not

completed myself

either hardware issues or the game is

just too difficult

foreign

like

there's no Hardware she's running

uh enter the dragonfly just the game is

so bad it can't run probably

properly

and so that one is Marcus not playable

I really want to play that game but my

Hardware isn't sufficient to play

and which is one more game that can't oh

yeah yeah the uh

spider Legacy inside it's there too

that's my computer can't run

my computer yeah how is am I going to

run a DS game it wasn't on my computer

there we go

it doesn't matter talking Captain bonus

foreign

so now we got one after

three I mean that doesn't say much I got

number two

[Music]

this is number three I guess yes

two and three

oh [ __ ]

[Music]

I hear the exit okay

there you go

and

Tada I did it I got the gem

oh yes

I got the jam

four gems four percent complete

it's apparently only James comes to keep

wait why does it say zero or 32 levels

I'm obviously

completing lemons when nothing is

counters make up music levels

foreign

[Music]

Journey

perhaps

there we go

here I see

no it's going to jump in this

this shape

[Music]

everything is

well frustrating

ah yeah I could see that I don't know

randoms in this game that would be crazy

celebrations but then I get to the lost

city here it's a green gem

see if I can remember all the gems

without people telling me what any gems

are this one I had to do 100

look at this here you can jump over

tell me why but here you can't jump over

and I don't know why

is my favorite boss really

what is it every CC how many attempts do

you think this will take

so let's see I got 47 now

yeah 57.

so it takes so long to jump on them 10

times that it doesn't mean

goodbye

butterflies

oh no bonus I don't need them bonuses

understandably no stinking balances

secret one no wait I don't need a secret

that's a stinking bonus

yeah but I do need the Box

and I can't take the knife to you

yes yep these are Shadow butterflies

the evil butterflies

the alternative Dimension butterflies

apply suit box

so bonuses that didn't count her as you

told the boxes no I yes probably the

previous life I mean I skipped the bonus

but I got the gem anyway

that was the very thing I proved

here we go I want the skin dancing

react

I'm collecting bonus tokens I don't want

bonus tokens okay

extra life

the

that was blocked

captivity

and the absolute

reading assistant

but lies yep Yeah well yeah I was just

very funny yeah

I guess that's fine

very fine

Here We Go activate that scene

let's get rid of this stinking one

needs that

foreign

ers

yeah it is this bonus

which I've skipped uh

skipped one four so I'm not gonna get

the bonus that bonus

it's just a harder version of the

article is so

[Music]

come on come here

you move over

yeah points

it doesn't get bad

character design or enemy design because

they have horns but you're still

supposed to jump on them

once usually indicate that you're not

supposed to jump on then that was close

no

not yet

now

there's ways to know for anything and

this is normal

yeah

I'm here you remember those lists size

at who God gives the sweaters

yep I need this one this is one with the

bonus talking in

nope

just a regular box

I don't need to remove it because I also

have to remove it on the other side okay

it's a good thing to poke

no

you can't do that even though I did that

on a previous one that was the fastest

thing ever tested on the previous one

that you could do that but apparently

you got

all right time to start everything

hey

this is really song

starting away from the beginning

starting overall from the start all of

them

oh nice

but my mosque

mosque

that was one of the listen yeah

I told it

when you speak French

find that one

[Music]

interesting faces in the background

oh I got it

because this one

because maybe it was because no yeah it

might have been because I was in the air

and if you are in the air it's okay

apparently

foreign

differently

I think they moved differently in the

trilogy

I keep messing up okay

there's the eye why you are

if you put the slash at start it's it

receives as command and we'll just tell

you there's not a valid command and it

will not send the message

you have to put a space or

uh these slash

or you could say here is the IPA and

then you post the

lashes in the same message there's some

point something

yeah I'm putting a slash before them

putting a space before the slash is a

way to send

like

what appears to be a command without

effectively implement

foreign

[Music]

all right

so the rapper is

not the chest okay

all right because it's before the eye

this is a good timing

yes

not yet

switch over

and then it doesn't go down and now it

moves in

and also adds element

and then it's just this

okay let's see this

second attempt at this thing but now wow

you see this one now it's time oh I was

almost missing this one it was over here

I think

removed it

stupid box airplanes

the butterflies

and then I'll just do this instant thank

you it is gone and now I can proceed

level without worry now I was spinning

trust me I guess I'll give you the bonus

then

bonus complete

I want to kiss sound

I wanted to see how far I could get

without doing a bonus

on site

yep

that's what I

could could

IPA

whoa whoa whoa

these are very annoys damn it

well like Spike this one is useless I

think

there's nothing so many purpose

there's nothing here but this one says a

Christmas

and it's for this one

for some reason

this explodes immediately

I don't know why

even more fun if you actually had to go

there but it's not like you get content

of them well I did it did I get to jam

promises and did I get more boxes

there's the green one now I came into

the tablespoon green gems in them

weird what's weird nothing break

immediately yeah that's kind of weird

moving on to the next table which does

not called yeah I think the remaining

colored gems on our next island is like

one conch gym on here it is fun I think

this one you can get boxes on yeah box

is breaking out yeah that is weird I've

never seen a box break on their own

honestly in real life

I've never seen a box activated by an

exclamation

and box

a method explanation box and as the Box

gets activated it explodes immediately

and just leaves the content there

because I think the next level of this

scene is the one that requires a gem

[Music]

other than this hole here which is the

ornament for the creature to be out of

that looks like I think you can fall

into it but you can't

imagine if you could

that would make the level a bit harder

this is this container bonus nope

apparently nuts

winner

videos

quite

the music

spindle that would be the Swedish word

[Music]

is it this one that contains boys

no

yes spinning things

I did it again

Oops I did it again I was spinning on

the box I moved forward because when you

can add land spin you can move forward

can I know him

got a lot of messages on this but let's

just

uh

we can go

and then there's this Rising

yeah

okay

it's all

nice for me to take back to the game

sorry about that that was gonna give you

that

cry why why are you crying because I

died yeah

crying moment yeah because what's

happening yeah just this like at the

start of level because I started wait

why are you crying nothing bad has

happened oh wait never started 11

because I died

that's the bad thing that happened no

way he's

[Music]

no worries no crying

No Woman No Cry not exactly

figure out the meaning

I'm the lyrics because I'm really really

looking for them because No Woman No Cry

without any form of emphasis or such

can't really mean a lot of things

sometimes

I think

the original lyrics is meant to be

something like there there woman

don't cry

ok

and

I guess that would be more like a nice

way of saying it even though calling

someone by Nike

following some woman could be considered

about like

the little link

in the sense of

I mean I I appreciate I did it again

being recognized as a woman but more

like

like I don't know speaking to someone

that's my kind of annoying

yep that's correct pronunciation

and I died again

but you could also interpret us like

more of a comment

much

no no woman

cry

we wouldn't have rude way of doing it I

assume it's a nice afternoon which

they're basically have the same meaning

there's a difference in richness

I feel like telling a dog

no dog don't cry

and then but there is another meaning

that could be be interpreted it could be

without a woman

there is no crying

we should put

that we've also seen as quite finished

it's the typical

meme of

heterosexual registration seems being

terrible obviously there's plenty of

heterosexual is just being great but

there's so much jokes around by

heterosexuals that have protection

relationships are bad

and obviously any good question is why

are you still together lifted so bad

[Music]

anyway

and I guess that was what I had to say

about that topic

moving on to the next 10th

I'm gonna avoid doing that same mistake

again I just need to remember remind

myself

this is on this one

what is the next topic next up is I keep

dying because when you're spinning it

continues moving if you were moving when

you

started spinning

but I guess next no you know

okay here's another topic

which I was talking about when I was

doing the speedrun

no my beautiful dress is gone again

I hope it's gone that I press the

correct button

I think this topic is underwear what's

your favorite anime

's favorite otherwise boy shorts

as in this

shape of underwear I guess this animal

mice doesn't really

when the designs are very but the

shapewise off the other way

of flames because fire is not here

yeah let's put the front one into the

Inspire and also have one pony flammable

yeah I guess so

there are many many shapes

yeah

I guess it's nice

but I find boy shoes to be cute

the head-to-headed

my model also have bikini

but panties

okay I'm approaching this area now where

I should not make that mistake

oh

yes here it is

I try to do it differently but

apparently it didn't count it counted as

doing the exact same thing anyway okay

so I can't do that because there's no

difference

apparently there's no difference

so I guess I'll just have to not spin

the Box even though spinning allows me

to not bounce on it

every single time

and and translate in Swedish and then I

guess you can correct him

write it in text

the Swedish phrase for every single time

would be

very young

I don't know if there is actually

because that would just mean every time

I actually don't know if there is a

version for every single time

so I don't think there's a distinction

every double time

I guess every all the time

but that

because yeah yeah now and because yeah

which is the first one by the way

and I gotta repeat value

sorry my wife I died but I returned wait

you will return or you have returned I

guess I have returned because you have

been gone for quite a while

hello Rocket Man

a Rocket Man From Outer Space

watching me putting some crash crash

Crash Bandicoot

foreign

[Music]

this is the

best coming to kill you

okay let's check what level is called

no almost it's gone like in pass

Temple runes and it's it's ruining me

but I mean it's close to where you're

gone

I mean I mean it's the same I guess

would be something else

but it's not like English

[Music]

so now the future fall down on that one

no it's a Felton what does that make

sense I heard it I translated

yes I was going to say that yeah Swedish

doesn't make a distinction between

every time and every single time

but but I think it's better to see like

um every every time I saw a shortening

of every single time because you also

got every other time

which in Swedish would be avaranan gong

which only changes the first word

so bad yeah it's like every single and

varana needs every object

so yeah there you go I sold the mystery

then wait for the best this time

even though it wasn't here

at this use of the pets

Temple Run This is ruining me

but hello

at least I got the first word yep

after yeah

the second thing

she'll be coming around the mountain

when she comes what

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

and oh

the letter name is for the second one

and they have the same sound in seven of

the world but they also has its own

sound and yeah it's a bit silly so I can

understand you not being able to hear a

difference because there aren't the

difference in the many of the words

so for example when you wrote a gong or

gone

but if you add that being a chance to

come gone

and then it's pronounced the same so

so is it so yeah I do think every oh

should be written as or if you make an o

sound with regardless

belly with violets velvet welcome hi fun

fun

you thrust with a spear of his thrust

Crush was trusted

is is one of the letters that I can hear

if I know the word but if I don't know

the word I don't hear it

can you hear a difference between or and

who

and enough

I guess the hardest one is to try to

hear difference between e and e those

are kind of thing like

[Music]

so is so generous today than yesterday

the money so many gifts gifts to

everyone

foreign

one but you have to pay for it yourself

daddy it would be fun to like gift

and beat to another using

oh here's the end all the way it's my

best

yeah so imagine the best income is that

the wall boxes

come on image gem

what's this ability I actually don't

remember

no it wasn't clear again

and thinking

now you got two

the the cat with the pom-poms is

actually really cute uh scroll down

is very cute

and I think the pom-poms are well made I

couldn't really get the pom-poms look

good for my what's this one the one I

could get all the boxes on I don't

remember

I couldn't really get in shape correctly

I'm still not today happy with the

shapes and fun

punch pom-poms but I do leave headphones

because you know what to have fun with

pom-poms because that's not confusing at

all the same

but not a bonus I don't want the bonus

[Music]

and I'm not going to go on the ropes

I know it's up down I know it's an

option

but I'm going to do this thing anyway

well I jumped too far there

because I don't know you

might I know

I don't remember

stocking

I don't want the bonus tokens

now in English

oh the bridge level this one was more

more pain yeah I can understand that

because some of these platforms are just

all right that sounds like that

our pain

but

I don't know what you're talking about

this level is pretty easy

but this one it probably contains bonus

token

ignore it

so I can't get any all the boxes anyway

now that I need bonus talking for boxes

anyway

I don't need the box for all the boxes

of course

press this button that contain the bonus

token and I don't remember

no I could break it like this yeah it's

a pretty soon oh wait a minute

no I can do that

I landed in front of it I didn't land on

it

I'll see love me

that was maxus in this

oh

Super Mario can't get boxing boxes I

can't get the gem on this one anyway

this one contains alive then yes

come here hog punch

I want a huggage and this one Contin

ued because I can just jump over here

and go and that's the idea that that's

what I wanted

I'm very sexy then there's another

camera this is the other Bridge level

where you can get

also if you get to the exit after dying

he does he does the

two animation and which means it does

not count boxes because you could not

get a chance pull the dash this one also

requires a gem the blue one I don't have

the blue gem

only continuing one so far

so

yeah the one where I said don't don't

like to tell me which level it contains

the color gems I would try to remember

that now

and if someone do tell me moderators

have the permission to delete those

comments

brother

so

um because if I remember correctly it is

the one with the rolling barrels that

contains the blue gem

which allows me to go back to this one

but I will ask just like in the Trinity

I will collect all the colored gems

first and then I will go back and pick

up the gems so I don't have to care

about which level had which color gem

easier that way

I think

yep

there is no pause machine to check that

that was the greatest invention of Crash

2.

they introduced an actual course menu

so strange that this game doesn't have a

pause menu

yeah it's from 98 but certainly games

before that I think it was 19 and

certainly against people's dads yeah

this one contains requesting the purple

Jam Even though it looks pink

um

here

you only have the green gem that's fine

it's fine to tell me what the heck

that's okay

so

yeah or

I was gonna say what is Rocky we're not

here Sunset Vista this one does not

contain

is this one container too

can I

this is one else I should be able to get

the next game on without the gym

I think

I don't remember

what

Maybe

[Music]

[Music]

wait where's this [ __ ]

no there are butt plugs must they have

bad no

I'm not presented so

no secrets

more secrets

this is a fun game

but yes you're right what flies I'd

forgotten

it's okay sometimes we forget

but I will not forget about you I will

never forgive you let's do that joke

again

oh my God

you know the switchboard for

or getting

[Music]

more but the

bear

youngest is imperative is the one that's

relevant no

I do not

but the imperative is glimp

game

so it's imperative form you should be

able to determine the other forms

thank you

probably something in here not with my

sister no boxes that that room was not

required

no I said Glenn

it's not Gloom

time is it away

this one kind

what I guess that worked

on back

what kind of work thing is

glum yes there you go there you go

that's the word

therefore you should be able to

determine about the infinitive the

present tense the bar stance the Supreme

whatever those are called

no I'm bonus

empty room

surprise 10 is glamor

okay okay

foreign

well

right yeah but if whether it is a funny

word because the

because the M duplicates

don't ask me why

so it's glamored

oh yeah yeah that looks normal

to my eyes

foreign

foreign

[Music]

who is dealing with kittens

hello kitten

you will get

the first person when he first month

activates you become level one when

you're a second one to activate super

common level two and when the third

one's activation become level three

but then so it's relaxed One XP per

level but then you need to to reach

level four you need three XP

19 yeah what's with the dealer

it was so different

what are you doing chicken

I'm working on something yeah

I need this one because this one will

give me I only get one chance at this

one by the way

because if you fail a bonus you don't

get to try it again

[Music]

now in Thomas when I was

pattern

[Music]

he messes with me

burn butterflies

one chance at bonuses yep if you fail a

bonus you get battery levels but the

tokens have been used up

you're so good at crash I think I'm I've

been playing too much I think

so I really hope this isn't going to

cost me any cheese

I'm already causing 64.

another one

[Music]

this one

oh that's the regular balance that I

don't need that one

time of this one

[Music]

and then go in again

there we go that's more Nike

yes boys right

nope

nothing too much nonsense

well at least I'll try the bonus I do

think I do think I can get the gem on

this one

well

and if I fail the boat in a second

I have to redo this tablet anyway

this is how it is

and I need to jump over here

I lost it and well I can explore these

are all the Divine ones

there it is

there it is

now let's go Boone is the ground

one attempt

sparkly it's a simple Donuts

no

no that was that was it

it's not like you the prime yourself for

food or sneakers there and the Wi-Fi

disconnected

yeah there you go and if you think about

this you're back at the level and can't

return it

but less since I failed both the bonus

and the buffness

I should and this last bonus

but should I do this bonus just to get

the

cry

the second bonus I do I can get some

lights because I'm running after lunch

[Music]

there we go some extra knives

new point

because apparently you only it only

counts

eleventh so I'm really curious what

happens if you don't collect a single

bonus when you play through the game

we're gonna have let's zero levels done

that makes no sense but you got one of

these jeans

running out of lives yeah I only got

seven three

I'm not gonna like

nothing else right here

I understand

when does this madness end

ing in men's over here

come at me

yeah here it is

oh yeah I should be able to do this

level

without

discount required for this level to get

the box so I should renew this level

to get a gem

something bad

they left you I thought you still had

more than that

don't get the Gem this time trust me

I'm gonna also try that uh context bonus

as it wasn't that complicated

no mistakes this time

tap tap down

[Music]

whoop I almost made a mistake

girl

[Music]

in here there's no boxes only a mask

I can ignore that one

excuse me find some

there you go I can skip that

no mistakes yep mistake

okay

snacks up onto the platform when they

die

is this something picking

and there are three different things in

this game is kind of weird sometimes

that's one of those boxes come on I

should be able to do this

this is a slipper climb

thank you

tonight

well I did not die

like should I jump on it and then block

me I should have jumped back

you would have jumping

speaking of the mistakes no mistake

okay I can go when it moves up different

it means and I kind of stand around

almost just standing around in that

position

that's just silly

it's one of those moment

whoops

I lost my mask

I need my mask

then this time I should probably pick up

that mask yes

jellies have one just in case

okay now it's lightly protected

would you like that

because it's like this part

where the timing is kinda

oh there we go

it's I did it

no

I was sorry about that but lines what

was that and in good times for the

celebration team

[Music]

see you soon yep

pretty much sure celebration

well don't piss me off

foreign

concentration now I I need to complete

this level

can't leave this level

at least this is like oh possible to do

unlike entranced

pretty much your celebration how

embarrassing yeah imagine if someone saw

that oh wait it was captured on media

I panicked

it was panicking

[Music]

pull out panic

come on now punch around me you should

never do it

fifth time in doing this level now

and on stream

everyone's gonna know now

yeah it was going to be a ball it's

going to be uploaded on YouTube but

we're going to take two months before it

gets up

guess who cares behind in there

oh okay that happened

[Music]

with your name written on it and

everything as well

I almost have a nice oh yeah yeah

I need some more one

give me some more than one

hit one

there we go now just said it's 73 again

that's like

good amount

of Nike

at least at that level I can say yeah I

got a sufficient amount

need more puns

you want puns

what more pants can I mean I call those

butterflies is that funny enough

as they have butts and they're flying

[Music]

I'm gonna have to change my name why

you live up to it

foreign

yeah yeah let us know on stream what you

change your name to

because wait I wasn't supposed to pick

this up

I don't need it

you don't just

pretty much has every station we're

going to give make fun of me for seeing

leave up instead of going out for it

never said

or whatever it is

how do you making fun of me strange

English

continues

why am I making a distinction between

the roof and ceiling it's a singing

buggy

[Music]

that's like having two different words

for if the wall is the inside of the

house they have the inside and outside

the walls of our house

and you can call it an inside water and

outside wall but it's the walls

oh yeah I should have

no

there you go

well one must jump too far almost empty

short oh

is back with the time

hello astronomy

celebration you are now a liberty bunny

but yeah are a fun founder so it doesn't

show that you're an empty bunny but you

are never too funny

they turn into fruits

nice to see you or playing some

crash entrance as it says on this

kitchen

yeah I

defeated the final boss but

and then

thought I was done with the game

all right I I checked uh thank trial and

after many many many patents of doing

the title

I didn't even get Sapphire

and at that point I felt like

yeah I'm not going to get told on this

level I'll never get to it would it

would be too much to try to get gold on

this level

so I was decided that now I stopped into

10 different times again I finished the

story

that still comes with completing me so

that's my situation

and I forgot about the butterflies I

mean butterflies

same time now

and I do know they aren't butterflies

and now they are better flies

again

the next one is over here okay let's see

if I can do this again

last time

and the timing between those arms again

it's kind of weird

no that's bad timing

[Music]

this is a better timing

wait a minute

there it is once you curious where it

was

like the box is gone now it must die it

was hiding

and this one hey important thing is that

you beat the game how did the many Game

Boy games go well like

completed most of them 100 so that was

okay

drop the key

[Music]

stick up drop the key

update

uh the game on games go I completed the

first crash game boy game 100 then I did

the second game boy crash game and

defeated the final boss which I said

that's right then then they did like the

time trial and realized that even after

many attempts of final completing one

level I didn't get the lowest time and

so even get the middle time which is

required for 100 that's going to be

impossible for me especially since that

type of level I did and didn't let me

get a good time on

and there are more of that type of level

how I

I'm not going to give you the homestead

I'm happy with the

the 100 I got

no 100 I'm happy with completing this

story which I still count as a

as the Lesser completion of a game

even if there is a greater completion of

game

and then the last crash game boy game is

a fusion which I have completed 100

thank you

and the same thing for spider

when there are three spying games it's

not exactly the same thing because for

spider actually completed this this

three spider oh okay it's three spider

game for games and

still messing up

there we go

nope nope

well

no

okay

all right

and there you go yeah but the three

proper spider games are completed 100

and then the spider Fusion which are all

super clean up soon

unbox this in there

come on come at me

and the last eight boxes

also there's no cops confidence

life and there you go notice

we've been calling them butterflies and

ice cream we just have fun nice scene

thank you

again I want you to call it I knew it

was okay again I'm not gonna do the Game

Boy game simply wouldn't have the

patience for them and I'll completely

cash for it

yeah I understand they aren't really the

best but it was fun with the spider

games

even if she's advice had his issues it

wasn't fun to play

but I wouldn't go patchy

[Music]

let me see if I can do this

damn

one out of four

wait where's there TNT

damn

there

there's the second one

now speed

tricky

that is open again

which is exist around exactly cars are

different but but the way the TNT showed

up for six seconds in

there you go

first attempt I think call account if

you're not Donkey Kong yeah

thank you oh my God is he a very

muscular creatures I see

every Machinery is this one of those I

can do get the German

I think so

I have 10 minutes left on my regular

streaming and getting hungry so

but I was speeding

fan vibration

why is this one open

in fact

I will try to get the jam on this wait I

don't need that

that picked up an ugly

an ugly face

it's ugly because he's evil

see

[Music]

be down I don't want him

there we go another one

[Music]

well I guess we'll do it that way then

find me

any of you can concentrate

my life

I'll take that

[Music]

what

that happens

it's for everyone who isn't subscribed

there's basically no one at this point

lurking time

I keep lurking

is everyone I'm actually appreciate

everyone there from here everyone except

only means

[Music]

never spinning

jumped honey

you can

wait to them

did I go down

I don't remember

I didn't get masks are coming down right

yeah I went down here

yeah no idea thanks

what about is that would have been silly

anyway what if they were cocoa tokens or

in a better Pom-Pom tokens well I mean

depends on what they do

I still don't really need them

they do like Pom-Pom tokens

sounds interesting

Secrets yeah this game doesn't have much

sequence but when it does have secrets

it's awesome

tokens and you get that life size

might be Overkill but like

record size

I'll take

because I said I want like a one and a

half meter between one and one and a

half meter tall

uh would be nice

[Music]

yes uh but with uh and also a changeable

outfits

so you can change out one which is kinda

trying to speed them away

[Music]

which is the uh kind of theme of my

stream I guess changing

[Music]

or in this case always taken away from

the address for some reason

that's

I assume is very big but I had lots of

clothes yeah one one likes clothes

it is possible to speed no way

but for some reason this is important

something

yeah pumpkin likes dresses

that sounds evenly here

I assuming you're supposed to jump on

that again this thing but

you can just reach it anime

dude that's what I said

it's my cuts

nothing from

nothing secret okay

[Music]

there's a section

oh

yeah

not safe that's fine

okay wait let me see uh feet but you're

in the

UK I'm the only one who use feet as a

measurement

well

well I think velvet almost these feeds

for measurement

and I think but Rockman is in the UK and

they can also use

speed information

randomly

I don't

have little grasp of water so this other

other than On My Feet

should be a box here

okay

this is not confusing

oh here we go here's a nice one two

be here

all right let's see

uh here I'm just gonna have so many

concussion yep

there's

egg something he doesn't already I mean

because it is

situation

I'll see you in a 4.875

[Music]

that would be a big one

three years

yeah I was thinking I said 100 to 150

centimeters

130 maybe 140 125

one made to put clothes on

um

this one requires the beauty and I don't

have to believe the gym but if it is the

one that I don't think you know

this one I have gone they have to come

back to but yeah what has been modding

since we're talking about Japan stuff

yes

[Music]

um

nice

first time

[Music]

one of them is working on my

people have suggested that I should use

yeah exactly you can use the pump on

mode as my model on stream

which is it's like the idea of you can

see modern theme is something that would

be interesting

and I'm gonna

get more into the idea of having that

but I wouldn't be able to use the mode

because the mod is actually using Coco

as the base which I don't have the

copyrights to use

just say also that uh

using cocoa as the base isn't really

optimal for one punch animation stuff

it's animation wise it's not great

so I would rather remake the whole model

from scratch anyway

that's people some have said like I'm

spending so much time

spending so much time making the outfits

and for a model that I can only use in

one game and that's true but I'll see

that more as practice

[Music]

though of course I don't haven't gotten

saved but I can make like a same state I

guess I can pretend that I'm never you

know

let's pretend that I've never turned off

the console

when I get back to the next time

so that's the idea that I then create a

new model from scratch and give her

different outfits and then you can do

redeems and change your outfits and when

I have a new computer I should hopefully

and when I do the tracking software

everything and hopefully that thing

allows me to base the redeem change

outfit

I like that on here and I can't have

different

dresses and different cosplays and stuff

yeah let's cancel the outfit change

I give you the money back

[Music]

so

let's do a range but sometimes

social stuff here

is the

mostly the display server which is my

own survey bye bye bye month bye so we

got a

Alia

which is some game or GTA 4. as the two

options

[Music]

I enjoyed the street today I'm happy

thank you what do you mean I appreciated

you are here all day all stream

bye-bye mermaid

otherwise I just pick um

let's add more news

sounds good like a good idea

I think

[Music]

let's visit

[Music]

said

[Music]

and um

Twisted slowly from his name anyway it's

and that's that

the same thing

company mode you want if you want
