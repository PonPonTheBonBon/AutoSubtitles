how to extend using why where's the game

there we go I'm not sure why it's so

late

that's the load to find file zero they

actually have zero indexing in this game

especially nerds making this game yeah

can you believe that their nerds making

this game

is this block okay is it

I hope it does feel okay it's probably a

small opinion than I am

[Music]

I was thinking about switching out the

the emotes from time to time during the

Stream

whatever I feel like I guess

and like against this

and stuff I'm still not like

[Music]

okay

[Music]

wishes

I'm having some Technic music give me a

short moment

[Music]

when I resolve this technical issues

it's when hopefully go quickly I just

need to check out the

controller

there might be some issues with that

let's create a new profile for digital

wait don't I even have one

I prefer playing like a side score games

with digital

uh these shortcuts that explains my head

so much easier

plants in the forest it's a really nasty

burger

but there's no one here

nothing to interact with

yes it's not touch the phone charge it

in the shower

[Music]

dude

[Music]

is this what they look like I guess they

have their own different heads this is

the Central Park

in this Central Park I've heard about

Central Park before is this what it

looks like

it's back in the center of the Tower

Place

that's what it did to the time

and that's the town hall okay

and you had to climb up this rock wall

okay it makes sense

okay swag out there what are we going to

do wait what

are the monster for the village I posted

on this bottle lighting board to check

it every now and then

missing Mouse

wait

they have turned into mice due to the

spell and they are actually not Meister

humans but now they're writing a missing

Mouse they have completely changed how

they referring each other just due to

the spell is it is it something

subconsciously that happened to them due

to the span

or is someone did someone literally have

a mouse that is missing at the moment

one of the right missing person because

they are humans turned demise

I I don't know

I know it says it yeah I know it says a

detail but really it changes the meaning

we have a missing Mouse to report a real

baby mouse is missing okay so it is a

real Mouse

and not one of the most people okay I

guess the text did clarify that it's

this is a real baby mouse and not the

former human like yourselves okay yes

yes thank you scientific okay my

confusion is away

I must be found immediately I know

information and they were about to be

much you're notified to turn on we call

and pick it up thank you for operation

but this Village okay so it was an

accident last

yeah

started off very confusing wait what is

the mission called I looked away

you ever beaten it yeah many years ago

tried to make a penny challenge

I'm thinking nothing like don't try and

run it on Modern PCC sometimes oh that's

the Nightmare part okay

oh yeah I used to actually replay to get

into technology

you get knocked out

like how am I supposed to continue this

game

she moved out of the way

right before

[Music]

time

prepared to the bound

what's going on with this game

can't you send me for another thing

[Music]

and this is

[Music]

oh

in the amount of time I would have to

spend trying against my kids bad cop

race into cute

[Music]

it's actually knocked out

[Music]

it feels like something that she played

in

I'm so confused at the moment sorry for

my confusion he's probably probably

obvious for you what I'm supposed to do

but I'm confused

question when you said Chinese back to

any place you have basically yeah but I

want to use it but I can't use it I'm

stuck in his location but it's not

there's probably some very specific

thing I need to think about

[Music]

let's converts

[Music]

fighting plants

normal pants you want normal pants

okay okay

[Music]

if you have any question can

assumes I can maybe help probably it has

made me look okay

[Music]

it's got really confusing because when I

entered this place they left me out

the character moved aside so I can go

out and then when I came back to this

place

[Music]

we'll be back soon again

one thousand points

yes

I didn't spend in a great place as far

as I know

um

blue items are request items black

characters and consumables Queen items

are creepable red items are and

upgrades I guess you could say they are

they are cons always equipped and

oh

and only seasonable

I can't wait I want to treat the same

time they're not like to keep the quick

but

rather questions

right

I mean sure you you can classify this

number but that is a great the blue one

the blue ones are Quest items the red

ones are upgrades

it's the key the key is here I got the

key from a quest

by producing the game

but I mean yeah it's not like I'm using

it in your request this right now I'm

going to use a community

[Music]

not just me

[Music]

okay

you have a bunny

I'm a bunny I'm a real bunny the honey

okay open chest

have enough to explore like

this like the first one maybe some of

these stores tells me about the red gem

I kind of went to this place in the

frontal body

paint you can finish that all right

yeah it didn't look like it could be

much in there anyway because of it let

me check one more time

[Music]

is here

always amazing to see good friends being

here yeah how do you think I'm going to

do swing first

did you know if you can't swim if you

walk into water you get hurt by the

water

you might sometimes bounce off you know

whatever but don't do this that's how we

the game goes

for example

and it won't be or Tomba if you want and

can't swim so if you touch water you

take damage and fly out I'm going to

save you this meat does not go over

and spider also takes damage from water

before he left it

a good thing to wear around I work at

the Town Hall I went to the lake to fix

the pump myself but well just look at me

hack them all this way even bought the

key to the small room a bit pathetic I

know I'm going to go back to the village

for a while if there is something you

need don't hesitate to see me I'll be at

the Town one you be careful now wait

wait wait the small key give me the

Smoky stop

[Music]

it was nothing you can continue till the

town hall don't mind me

I got the last key okay

watching this big toy

[Music]

lot these days so the carpet sharp pain

power of the pig that trapped me in in

help is taken away one thousand year old

[Music]

[Music]

I think that no it just it's a really

old man

wait have you been in there I think I've

been in here already yeah yeah I might

need to go to the large key now

small

let's do both

[Music]

I go to the small Keyhole

[Music]

and it seems to be a lesson request

small Keyhole here for 2000 points when

I get so when you get the quest you get

points at start and when you finish it

you also get points

but when you oh there it is there's the

last one I think

[Music]

what nothing happened

but if you complete a quest without

getting the quest you only get the

completed Quest points

but this would be nice if they could be

the starting Quest points as well

[Music]

by

not wasting painting yeah

[Music]

one so

maybe I should do Stanton

[Music]

he's not to keep crunching

[Music]

all right

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

scenes

but yeah

when you complete the quest without

acquiring at first on the first one it

tells you would press this the kitchen

[Music]

it's like a half a half an hour more

you're planning this thing should I go

and make myself more to think I will do

it anyway but do you want to wait for me

to do that or should I just continue

playing

people

they're giving you the options

now it's been scary

[Music]

originally my phone in my room is I'm

not interested in long I actually spend

more time washing my hands

flame it was so hard to get here hey I

know why didn't you try to put our

design

Flames but anyway I found this

[Music]

friends experience that was an easy

question

do just to keep yourself with it and

I'll automatically open my YouTube

you press the download button you can

increase the speed 50 Cent you can catch

the right wing you can manure Reserve in

the quickest point right see you later

interesting

foreign

[Music]

caves the new chest that was locked to

container feedback

piggy bank and he's been streaking

sanitized no no no no

he

is wearing white pink pants

but his pants got broken

[Music]

[Music]

came away

well I guess I have to know the game

then

come on away

today what happens I have to return back

to last scene

straight down the hill

well and then I have to redeem

everything I don't even know where I

left off

[Music]

but in that case

[Music]

[Music]

of me

let me do it

[Music]

how it's been around no it's nothing I

cannot say it

what do you mean like status

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

oh you still have seven Max house I

guess he said one reason yeah yeah I did

I got it after the

[Music]

same thing

I say when you're welcome

[Music]

come on

[Music]

foreign

[Applause]

[Music]

all right

[Music]

and then see this time

even read even combine trades

so it's this one

[Music]

let's do that it's the same way

yeah well let's do this the correct me

around

yeah and get the question

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

Quest

[Music]

lava lava lava labor

and then I'm done here

[Music]

and then go back to this work

which means

[Music]

whatever it comes from

[Music]

and get the initial

thing and considering

um I'm not really sure

anyways

it would probably worth one point even

if you forced to do something

and then came his page prank

[Music]

to the viewers says only defaulted pants

someone's probably looking good yeah

probably show us

[Music]

I guess

please

[Music]

teleportation

[Music]

first it should be award

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

Minnie

F6 what happens if I don't know

does it remember my house

[Music]

three hours only three hours

came over maybe it doesn't count loading

times and and pop my new navigation and

stuff

[Music]

so if you can do that

they really should give you full hands

as soon as the same game

she doesn't remember what the house is

when you say the game

doesn't save your health or in my city

house and it doesn't allow the house

[Music]

too practice

three magazines power of the green evil

page yes and this one is going to say

the red bag in the ceiling for power are

often ready with me

where do I use this

so many of these

[Music]

I can press sort okay

[Music]

thank you

everything

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

oh again sorry tears from the flower

[Music]

maybe I need the tears

[Music]

peace

[Music]

my face has such time to sing

yeah

it's going to basically run

extermination to place it in one version

and I'm not doing a remake but he still

think the game could do to be do with

the Remake and change a few things

I liked how it came everything

the game over is a way to punishing for

a system that

can be so off so easily ignored and

there's no point for this game to have

lives because every time you walk past a

sign you can save when you die you

respawn at the sign wait for it yeah so

having even a game over State and extra

life is completely useless it doesn't do

anything for the game the only risk

reward you get is if you are

[Music]

I don't don't want to spend time saving

but since this is a terrible since then

if you don't want to inconvenience

yourself you can take the risk of

nothing

[Music]

this is the

air of games where they used to use

certain extra lives because that's used

to him

[Music]

and complaining about the game but yeah

it's

[Music]

and I didn't know I just just a thing

I did now

[Music]

France

that means we're approaching the

[Music]

three hour mark why can't I speak to you

can't even find the flowers please

please tell me I'll tell you

in your side my boy you and I are

friends now wait whoa whoa whoa

so now it's fine whatever you're looking

boy

puppies hurt still yeah

what do you want my torch be careful not

burning yourself oh well thank you give

a feedback and see if Elder has

something like that

all right

yeah

maybe the Ellie can redirect me to where

she can

[Music]

he treats me like nothing

[Music]

yes I have done it

thank you

20 seconds well I'm assuming yeah I got

a I got the torch thing now

so I can I'll explain the area now I can

use these to like the torch the lantern

in the prism again

the evil piece did not hang in places

where they have cast spots in it you

will find the evil pig gates with the

evil piggyback but each bag corresponds

to an even three that can only see that

one again by myself you need seven bags

to see normal centipede pieces legal

feedback should be near the place it

down yes yeah I found the pig bags in

the places that have been cursed I've

just not found the evenings

[Music]

because it has been featured

charity squaring for us yes

not the chest sixth grade

there's no need to guard the d47

[Music]

so are you support

[Music]

oh this is my tunnel thank you for your

help now I can finally Escape

clear one thousand that didn't mean for

you this game

excuse me

I think it's not your Escape

I just didn't think it should be dark in

the prison but doesn't seem fair

[Music]

oh wait he's

he's gone we're about to lay in the

handstand

out there have you seen the Ender two

dwarves from The Forest are arguing

right in front of the village entrance

you should be just let them be but

they're blocking the way and now I think

they're fine

stop that fighting got two thousand

points here's two thousand points to

start

animations okay

prisoner escape yes and now they're

arguing about something

nothing

[Music]

and it's but he might find it so in your

Palin I didn't but I did you did

all right

[Music]

now I'm about to broke something yes

it seems that those two were taking care

of something for the elder or what

oh the puppies are outside see you again

[Music]

three of dollars

nice there's two right here

[Music]

is there an item I should use here

[Music]

since I torted them now should I go back

in sec

rocket man yeah I'm about to end the

stream like in a few minutes

probably maybe

[Music]

I'm just going to figure out this

Mission here

the early one here hit some more of this

in no time

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

damn curious me and my sleeping parent

yeah you must be seeing me native

listening

if you work at this link sure you are

one out here behind some

protect one hour and let's see what's

done it's pretty late

[Music]

oh that's yeah

you break my precious ways

I'm so sorry

stop the fighting

and an additional 5 000 points

if you finally made it each out of that

hole

would you be so kind enough to fill up

the whole why is there a sinkhole in the

middle of the village anyway

[Music]

well that was dead

twice another Escape

when

we're doing I'm doing

did you see him oh no we can't find him

anyway

and maybe it's just a rumor after all

I don't know I really just said that he

signed the forest here but even for the

world's greatest seed I'd be hard to dig

and escape from this far

because

[Music]

look in the underground prisoner one

more time

[Music]

why do you have to move one at a time

you can work together you know

I guess then

at least it didn't get waiting to pass

out face down on the bathroom four for

seven hours but wait that's exactly what

happened no that's what it means

okay

it's not gonna burn the

SE things

[Music]

the mission force is all kind of tasty

looking mushrooms but it but I would eat

one of them if I were new the very

dangerous amount into the east of the

mushroom Forest

in the finished Mountain

[Music]

do

[Music]

all right he's back

aha you have my spirit a little squat to

block my top

look at me I taught you for the time

back in here again now it's trying to

escape from that one right when you

pulled up my tone of the dark look at

the dimension Treasures I can't even

steal a slice of bread now

I didn't know about his son discovered

watch why did everyone keep talking

about the telescope they watched however

what I didn't see

oh never mind ah it's so boring here I

am going to sleep

you can read this game

clear two thousand points when

Maybe

[Music]

dance

[Music]

he should be able to break too it's made

of very very thick

[Music]

thank you

it's just dark and still be loose and he

can teach you again

and also suddenly Tommy only feels like

the top

stuff

and with what started to fill it with me

[Music]

I'll give a burn that thing he wanted to

burn in a long time so yeah so give me

some extra time I don't seek your mind

we go over time

[Music]

champion

wow

[Music]

I have anything to say

[Music]

Minecraft Minecraft

[Music]

would they use them as saw blades

uh amount of hydrate and since I'm going

over time now I don't think I'm going to

get more hurt

s

[Music]

at least it wasn't easy way to disable

um

temporarily disabled

redeems

Without Really removing them released

because I don't want you to come back

next stream and see oh the hydrate is a

new redeem no it isn't

yeah I think that's an update to

your names

a few updates I've been thinking about

weather redeem is unavailable to be

redeemed at this moment it should be

faded in the redeem selection menu

and yeah

[Music]

when uh yeah and then uh I should be

able to disable uh

I should be able to disable uh redeem

so it's faded in the Rhythm selection

man it's not it's still existing is it's

just disabled for the remainder of this

tree but it will be on disabled

certainly but the next

let me show you how it is when you can

then it's fine yeah yeah yeah yeah I'll

do that when I have done streaming

don't worry about that

this should be a way to pause music yeah

yeah exactly

it should be away

and if you're on desktop and you press

on a redeem that is currently

so awesome okay boss

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

they could add the cooldown time as in

when you do the redeem how long will you

have to wait until you can if you could

just tell you the cool that time

like this video will be available again

that means

it doesn't seem nothing

and then

on

desktop only if a type if I redeem is

currently in a cooldown state it does

actually tell you the time before it's

available again that's the thing it

doesn't tell me right

now

I think on desktop is also fancy that

own of the available teams has been used

up

if Inc for example the first video in

this case but on mobile it just says go

ahead

I definitely really too easy this time I

was here wait wait

anyway

s

[Music]

I'll put an example in this card how to

but I am in the inside Force

[Music]

we want the question first password

option

it's ready for quite a crazy we used to

be themed

what

[Music]

is that about me

[Music]

who do you know

[Music]

I have no idea

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

this is interesting

now I I have no idea

[Music]

thank you

I can't even access anymore oh yeah it

must be the special mod

how would you even access the mod view

SRS I can access the module on other

streams I know that

how would that even access the mod view

on my own stream that I don't know that

seems like a huge flaw

[Music]

yeah I have no idea how it even access

the

[Music]

I have no idea I was I was supposed to

be able to save

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I think my point still stands that

[Music]

um this should be this should be an

option to pass your leaves because I

don't have the option because I don't

have a motivation so I guess mods can go

on positive themes in that case

that seems like a problem

go on to your profile I can't access my

profile an open stream

like I can't access my profile when I'm

streaming because I don't have because

then I have to go to

okay now we now got to figure out how

should I do this okay I can go to Twitch

website I can choose my profile

I can go to

or open streamer this should be Sword

Art under the chat bar okay so if I go

to

which

slash one Pawn slash chat

so this is pop-ups on chat no there's no

sword icon

do anyone who I'm currently

yes I am a moderator on this Stream So

if I open this stream

yes here's the sword icon on this stream

which can allow me to open a moderate

view but if I go to the same pop out

child name chat

I don't have the sword icon no and I

can't yeah

the moderate view is not available to me

as a streamer it is missing I can access

it on other streamers who I am a

moderator on

I

I can open the moderate view on my own

stream but I didn't but that I had to do

shoe

as

is

but then

okay

wait

okay so okay dude is complicated system

I can I can pause a redeem from being

used okay so this there is some option

to do that

very complicated method of doing that I

do not have the option as a streamer to

do that model is have that's a huge

issue I know twitch is bad but it's just

even worse

so that's the thing twitch has to do fix

[Music]

yeah

I know I can complain but yeah

I will complain about that

allow the streamer to access the

positivity but the problem is model

review is a completely separate

the thing

yeah I don't have it yeah yeah

and I'm not going to run the browser

when I'm

yeah and while I'm streaming but it's

taking up so much performance

anyway

yeah I wish

yeah when I when I open my reading menu

which I can't do add the pause redeem

option there

is there any other special things I can

do from the motivated review I can't do

otherwise when I'm streaming

the all other options here seems to be

available

[Music]

anyway

are you sure

but I can access the

Whispers

And I can't take any access things for

my lesbian

but yeah with species it exactly really

available to me right now and maybe I

can access that too

another

yeah yeah

yeah

good access damage through these instead

maybe yeah

no wait wait wait

yeah no yeah yeah yeah yeah now I

finally fine yeah I don't have the mod

review okay okay now I see now I see I

can't I can't access them from here I

can possibly make it I don't I can't do

it from here kids good Goods so the

option is divided for me it's just very

confusing

very confusing yay I found the option

[Music]

smile so I don't see why you can't no

it's I don't know where

I mean

there's a new one here like I mean yeah

yeah I can access mine but I can't

access it I can't access it from the

stream when I while I'm streaming I

can't access it from OBS there is no

option here it's just missing

if it is nothing

you know I don't know how to use it if I

when I don't see

I have no idea what's going on

I can go to the web website go to my

stream accessibility that's way too much

work for me thinking to just do

yeah

I hate too much did you

anyway I got stuff to do so let's rate

someone

a nice streamer I don't think I've read

it before

because I'm feeling very weighted moment

but saying but but thank you red I can

access them

architecture through DVD because I have

the I have the list of routines

and so I can go to a specific routine

there and this is

that's good to know thank you

it hey

but yeah

it might be different yeah sorry for my

confusion anymore

we're going to visit Spanish Flu sheep

granny not funny look sheep they are
