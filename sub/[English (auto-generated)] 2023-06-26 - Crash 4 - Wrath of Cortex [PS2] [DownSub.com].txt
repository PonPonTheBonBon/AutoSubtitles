[Music]

welcome so

When I Was preparing

I forgot to fix the

yep

but

not easy to fix because I know how to

fix it

and the game is

he experience had to work with these

graphics cards

[Music]

look it was very soon enough screen

sadly not my kids fix this one it was

you know and I remembered it

the fact before it was time

slowed it

[Music]

now I just have

to show up on screen and then go

a universal interactive Studios

Productions

[Music]

how much the audio is often to the first

each time I'm not exactly sure why

welcome with the bunny

I hope you enjoy

it's not the crash for what I was said I

was going to play originally but

hang up

but I guess I'll

and then hey yay

and that's his shirt first you were

first you were early too very early

me too

I just so I can see the TV battery I'm

playing original Hardware by the way

hence capture card

so everything looks fine

let's start the adventure I think you're

doing something

that's good enough for me

oh look you have to enter your name

immediately

what is my name

my name is

Evelyn now I have the right company

thank you

unlimited to eight letters because you

know PS2 didn't have enough memory to

save a nine no it's just such a weird

restriction a lot of games huh Batman's

like 20 letters

[Music]

especially I think you don't

okay

beautiful graphics

something

it's not our fault that Richard

Bandicoot is to blame

basically no pictures

always finds a way to defeat us

maybe he's just too good for us enough

excuses he's a good person

or friends

there must be something we can come up

with

say doctor haven't you been tinkering

with some kind of new secret weapon in

your laboratory I don't know what you're

talking about Dr cortex

I think he's referring to the super

secret weapon you've been laboring over

day and night since the last time crash

defeated you enough bickering do we have

a plan well in my scientific Endeavors

I've been able to create a genetically

Advanced super weapon of unbelievable

strength

power source is the final missing

elements

[Music]

all right the Elementals that's it if

release their destructive energy could

create enough power to bring my secret

weapon to life

flushing mountains

[Music]

the Wrath of Cortex

anime

what's happening

oh no

that's

glitchy polygon in the sky

a kid

is up to his no good tricks again I must

find out what he is planning I'll meet

up with you later

the ground has textures but like the

character yes

what kind of diabolical scheme do you

and Dr cortex have planned this time no

schemes just some old familiar faces

dropping by for a visit

to music

voices not the Elementals

why did you release them

you know what happened the last time

they were free so they were responsible

for a few earthquakes

face age a couple of centuries back

you worry too much brother

cannot be framed hookah hookah they are

far too dangerous

was all

on the contrary

spells disaster

[Laughter]

[Applause]

so they can cause earth makes

tsunamis rice age but barely attack

another mask

and doctor

Elementals second movie find a way to

stop them before they destroy the Earth

and all of its inhabitants is this the

Earth

the only way to stop the Elementals

destructive nature is to imprison them

with the use of ancient crystals each

Elemental can be returned back through

their hibernation state with a total of

five crystals we must act quickly Coco

what is the status of the new portal

chamber you've been working on it's

almost finished a few little adjustments

here and there and it'll be ready to go

well done Coco

well done a well done we

is very blurry

[Music]

that's not how you type on a keyboard

and crash didn't say a word

[Music]

hello

Nemesis how the heck are you still

Gathering crystals old habits die hard

don't they my days are being spent on

something much more intriguing meet

crunch my newest creation

this is the creature who keeps

sabotaging your master plan

you gotta be kidding I'll exterminate

this field right in no time

exterminate don't crunch your time with

Crush will come soon enough

Coco pay attention it's my true

scientific genius a real Bandicoot

Warrior it says I'm gonna hold the

camera still

hey

listen I want to move the camera

hello Coco

I can so uh

yeah so it's basically like crash three

again

but this time I have to manually say

I find the same of Compton

notice that one thing I don't I've seen

in a few games I never commented on it I

think but it's the it's the way they

have this uh custom font but when you

want to write something like

or Playstation they use a standard font

it shows up disappears very quickly

there but

and maybe that's something places

required

anyway let's go to the first level

the game seems to run quickly

I'm Rocco the Earth Elemental Dr cortex

woke me from my captive Slumber and now

I'm pretty pulverize Whatever Gets in my

way don't even think think about

collecting those crystals around

you I'm gonna bury you alive

all right you want

comparing their life that sounds bad

[Music]

so

this is

a good crash for it

and everything feels awkward every

animation

nuts it fits of floating bit slow I

don't know

and then when you do this quick slide

oh here

I think you were early with that one

let me just change to

yeah

yeah speaking style I guess I decided

that they should do like

crash

but I never did

and I said this game changes a bunch of

rules when it comes to how crash works

for example

I can share it here

we'll we'll see it eventually because I

can't remember I realized her but some

rules have changed nice

nice eyes

for example

one room that I can't really show but is

that

and then um

I've said the game tuned out for me so I

can't think so for example

in the original and insane Trinity

because they should work the same most

of the time

and when you get a checkpoint it saves

every box you got

but in this game it only saves the boxes

you got

from I can't see that that way

um

before the so if I pick up these boxes

now and then take a checkpoint all the

games would have same things but this

game only it only saves all the boxes

behind is behind the correct word other

boxes that appears before this so these

three boxes will come back if I die

which I hopefully don't do

it's a weird change of room which makes

backtracking and saving up checkpoints

very annoying

because you can't do it in this game

foreign

they are quite expressive

and Elsa

he

this is also a change which I didn't

know

if you have the mask

people mask

it apparently

and doesn't

destroy every box above it

the solids changes they make right

if they have made the game

it's not a night so now you can see

if I was correct

oh I got another checkpoint

yeah

It's like because this is the first Main

Line crash game not made by

Universal

United

not really used to the

and apparently they must not have played

the cash game or something

or more like they have played the game

but they didn't analyze the game

anyway they have this test plus from

here which I pay because I died

I will skip the bonus as well

as I fast

I can I can pick up the gems anything on

about 99 or something

[Applause]

but I will

oh so you can slide through that thing

foreign

[Laughter]

so

I don't need I do need to keep okay oh

there it is

somewhere

stop shooting me I'm trying to get these

boxes

it is lacking

he sat around the neck

we have really short range these moments

I mean I guess the

sound isn't annoying I could give the

game that but

it sounds weird

[Music]

oh that's right that's how we do it

in this game you don't shoot with the uh

back button back in the original you

shoot with the jump button

while in the original you did the

spinning wait did you do that

for summaries I don't remember I don't

remember

so many

why am I missing out there

cracking

this wasn't paying attention

okay get the house when the box springs

and not when

that's the gem

I took damage

and that's all the generators

while I was offline

Alpha Fox Zero series here here

must be here

and then we move over to bamboozled

because I got Bamboozled because this

isn't another platform

when was that the message

not nothing

nothing a fairly

[Music]

because this is also a not a platform

maybe I can get the gem on this one

okay hamster ball

yep

basketball

I got this

yeah I did play hamster ball it was

it was fun until I got to the impossible

level because that one was impossible

for me to do

check my

in this game like these three original

games

whenever I get a prep you can see that

when you break a checkpoint he said if I

said check

the letters disappear and then it says

point and then those letters disappear

they change that in the remake where it

says checkpoints immediately and then

the text disappears

probably they are the same amount of

time

I think there are extra boxes over here

where's the eye it first leads me one

way of course I need to go the other way

well I seen the name in possible lemon

by which way

nips

disappeared

soft learning

but yes that was Kennedy's joke

thanks for spelling it out

do that

okay one more try without falling off

this time

as far as I know you can't

I mean okay I won't check it then

as far as now there's no fall damage

yeah so you can fall down from Top up

there which is a longer distance and

fall down on the soft Paras

wait

I think that's awesome nice

thank you

missing boxes

go again

as the result is by this game I can just

pick up checkpoints

this is a fork this isn't backtracking

the dudes might apply differently here

oh nothing

I got to treat

okay and there

doesn't seem to be any

and and this is the sound of the exit

because I should take the other way

you should have put some boxes here

against me annoying

I guess it's almost more annoying that

they didn't but Chris is here

[Music]

oh

anyway

I think you like Thai the Tasmanian

nice that's okay it feels similar to

spider you have a what

[Music]

from where you access different levels

via portals and in each level you have a

number of objectives again the plot

coupons

yeah it might actually be something for

me

maybe I should play those games

they are available for PC and they

shouldn't be quite so demanding so this

should hopefully just run pretty smooth

lizards

It lines through these levels at mom

once you get enough of them it unlocks

the bus level so you can move on to the

next setup

levels

and I like special thank you

wow I'm walking on foot again

Cricket power-ups in this game

because I have less power-ups in this

game because there's no double jump

there's no quick spin scene

and there's no cocoa

good players hey I tell you the trailer

of the scene

I mean logically it should still remain

but

that's not how we use the game works

these uh Knights seems to be missing

something

this doesn't look good

let's see if I can get on boxes on this

then

thank you Game

let's let's see if they change the rules

regarding

bonuses

I don't know

this is a real this is a change to have

so if you land

say you can back they can make a bigger

jump but if you press the dark button

while in the air before you land he

doesn't die

that's a change

I think they're a bit more annoying

point of this

because I have this

a little bit weird

oh wait I should have had that

clips

well I guess I'm not getting anything

but

[Music]

the game's number one so

well I guess I don't get the boxes on

this then

run crash like you like depends on it

gets it stuck behind the box I should

have destroyed the Box

I've been destroying boxes that I

can give away but

it doesn't feel like sliding makes you

go faster

[Music]

at least it doesn't stop after sliding

back into original I guess but

probably because he doesn't even get

past if I

like he does smell from the holes you

know where the holes are

and so that's that's a good thing

but it's quite thick

it's that hard is to see where what the

start of the hole is you'd be sick you

can smoke

I guess if you have some some

fruits I guess

so

all right

[Music]

but not too far for me so the deaf

person doesn't have the boxes okay

gets

without dying and

does that mean that oh yeah it does have

a

another gem on the desk platform instead

I see

I guess the first step is to basically

get to Cortex I guess I'll see if I get

any power-ups

Rattle and roll your Bandicoot but

wait you're going to shake my butt

hmm that sounds a bit kinky

okay let's

I'll say I should say a Coco should

still be playing but there are reason

usually showing me he have been yes she

has her own levels

easy

I guess since I guess they're happy

come and watch fun fun making the game

is looking easy

thank you

can get the other boxes in this lemon

and also another level

which isn't platforming

but I guess it is

that's for me after my

yeah

nice to have a checkpoint

it's dangerous that you can just walk

around

as a whole King to the enemy

[Music]

changes you can just walk around

including enemies can I cry out of this

yeah

oh thanks it had to be a bit careful

here

but so in their specific locations

you don't have to get rid of you but

I know it says sending enemies into

fruits apparently since the fruits away

I don't think that was the thing in the

region

bonus

regular case except for when I'm making

mistakes

and as always

I should have activated immediately

or have waited for something

should have gotten out of them

yes this is going to be

TNT okay

yeah that's all of them nice nice

level up ahead

okay point the same progress

so he lowers

immediately when you execute that

slide

because the animation showed in sliding

through the scene

yeah in this area is that phone

you must press the duck button after you

landed it's going to be annoying

yay

celebration and sharing

fantasy vitamin

notice in this game

there's a lot of special effects

this is the

particle effects game they've just added

them everywhere

as the developer

made a very efficient code of doing

party face and he just loves putting

them everywhere

and

I don't think he looks good I mean

I mean

it's a terrible terrible but I think

it's a bit too much

because the game has a rather special

effects and actually nice models and

stuff so anyway

rambling The Roots

so now this is the first boss battle

let's see if a gift and it's even doing

looks like the Bandicoot's been busy

collecting crystals I warned you

Bandicoot

finally

I get to wrap my fingers around your

puny orange neck

I mean have you seen crash snake

look at the look at the puny neck yes it

doesn't have any

he he just he just bugged me in head

merged

nice not a trick so what you have to do

is

touch these and turn them blue because

apparently fresh is blue

probably plus blue means good but still

but still crashes orange up there and

the other one is here

and after you activate the bounce

at

he does play the sound effect of it

breaking way too early

and then they started attacking with

barely any sound effects

this game is so awkward

and there we go

hey don't knock it away

he can also activate them those and when

I do those turn orange which is trash

color

so if I take

14 damage

how many times can I take damage

there we go

what he doesn't go you can't divide 100

by 14 and even a number of times or like

a whole number of times right

maybe can

it doesn't feel like it can because 15

and that's 10 from

that doesn't work I think

well I'm taking much more than 40. that

was two hits and that was definitely

more than 14.

I didn't mean to do that

yeah the construction

hey my boy

there you go

now I just need the last one there we go

I was born

hey

I'm gonna sink right it's a snake yeah

he doesn't have one

is this the boss yes this is a boss

a really really awkward bus

I have to actually pick this up the

sneak announced suspended neat Rock

paints all the other two I'm moving that

sounds like a really nice when I'm

blinking

with with a hint of sarcasm

so I should have focus on reaching

cortex or collecting everything

that's that I leave it up to you to

decide I will in the meantime try to get

all the kids here while I know I can do

it without the desk all right

I see that was the first boss

brunch with the

the first element of

and then we knew there was so many

questions

and so far this is the port

the not many oops

yeah I don't think that's right his

first announcements because that's our

students they say be disabled because I

didn't buy

foreign

crash game

until the second transform

crash Bandit 442

hey can I stop dying to the same enemy

okay so I have to give you the enemy

this is going great

I don't think they might

and I think that it sticks not exactly

as a spiral but

the height of that one is very very high

but this is the issue I have this game

the uh effects because

I'm the Indian enemy is only using a

special effect it's hard to see where

the effect starts and stops

and it said

and it certainly speaking and it looks

like

how many games are there I just totally

hockey but I will play more and then

that's the only number of crash games

and do you know

there are more but I don't know how many

is what I'm trying to say

so

I want to play through every crash game

so including the

non

concerned

transforming games as well as the

console the non-platforming games

and I guess also the non-console

non-platforms

so

for my seven games and there are more I

see no I told you there are five

Mainline games

there's four canonical Mainline games at

the moment

but

before this voice canonical game they

were forecast

no maybe they counted the uh

Queen sanity is Mainline an article game

two

hey

still don't know what the point of that

is so

why don't you pay attention more

today I

three of them so I should get 20.

did I do this again I didn't do this

again

I think this is a king

I'm not good at paying attention sorry

yes

other because the fruits are 3D

I guess they can't display as many

fruits on screen so therefore you lose

them at a slower rate than the original

first game

which and also I think it's 3D fruits

and it's really life icon just looks

ugly in the game

in 3D we have to make a 3D now

they went back to YouTube

crash team racing crash on the girl

crush crash on the go

yeah but those are only

the yeah constant game tonight

you also have

okay can I do this connection sign

again

finally that took too many attempts

because you have

yeah

oh

portable games too

[Music]

oh it comes

crumbs attack

I think they actually taking a box first

I can keep picking up that mask if I die

the first one he destroys him right yes

that doesn't mean it destroys each all

of them likes their life so yeah that

keep those boxes

this is

the cash one

if I take this first this tune up here

each time there might be a second rule

that

if you have a checkpoint and then you go

back and pick up crates you might get to

keep those crates when you get back to

the third point

and that seems to be the case

so yeah when you get the checkpoint okay

that does

at least make some of the backtracking

nice so when you get the checkpoint

regardless if you take pick up your face

before or after picking up that you find

every check every crate

be foreign

regardless of any beaten out one money

back okay

but that's how this game works

all right okay it's crashing the

underground on the go and it's a moment

oh yeah

now I know which it is

fashion here

and that name I recognize

but that's a infinite

scrollers in here

I could play it

if people want to see that

yeah and then I should do all that with

the hotline

to get an extra champ

but yeah

that's the question was should I focus

on getting 100

or shape

focusing on getting cortex first

it's your choice I could do either way

oh

see him again I got the gem plastic

focus on 100 okay

damn I hate games with this more night

games okay

let me actually check this

[Music]

Crash

Bandicoot when I enter this letter so I

actually tried to do this platform so

you have the Chris Brown good one to see

on the recent PlayStation and then you

got first team racing crash bash

and then this is a crash the rest of

Cortex so technically I have skipped two

games but I'm doing more likely so maybe

I should see those and then you got a

huge adventure and trans need to cut

and then fresh Fusion or purple

depending on what

to insanity

and

at the various mobile games

tag team racing and just racing boom

bang

crash of the Titans

Mind of a mutant crash native cards 3D

mutant Islands

nature cartoon

and Central G need to field

it's about time on the Run

and latest crash team Rumble

there you go did that one count

I think one of the title was uh

probably uh

so now I should just not back

a a portable version of a axis the other

game

[Music]

that's a lot of crash games

but it's not like the platform because

for Action Jenny in platforming cash

games there are

five

[Music]

do one fat one

Jenny main line

trash platforming games

why did I think that on on Home console

they're fine

[Music]

don't get distracted by the lives

no

no the sliding isn't Fun

yeah

get to the work room that's also seemed

tempting

thank you

let's get started a Kiki note water

amazing yeah I I want the place to have

you can see my own thank you very smart

things the various mobile games

including like old

is black and white

and mobile games are like

before smartphones was a thing I could

do those two

foreign

crashes on the Run

that

I don't want to pick that one up

okay no mistakes this time

no mistakes and I have immediately

followed

oh Instagram well

subscribers you get to see me fail a few

more times while I'm not subscribers and

subscribers it gets to watch some

beautiful ads

and if I get to the platform before the

ads are over I can wait for the ads to

be over

there we go

another tradition when it's going to

show that it must be doing it

let's prepare the message and wanted to

send me the answer play email message

foreign

now

I can I can walk around these box I

thought I couldn't

apparently

I mean that one

so I can survive some

I know I say nature and it's supposed to

be Nitro but I just used to say Me too

no I forgot about the mask

that one shouldn't activate that's not

seeing except crash can actually

checkpoints

the box is just

it should slow it down

that would be an interesting tactic

can I

nope

[Music]

okay

there we go

we got one and a half minutes before the

answer can I make it to the platform

this time I will pick this one up

come on now Pom-Pom you can do it

tell everyone

your

skill scene crash

and now for the final part

the neat resection

I always fell down in that one

[Music]

you can do it apparently not this is

going to be the hardest level of them on

yeah I don't like those bats

they don't even look cute they're like

two sweaters and

wings

it really puts all their

and that's so that's another thing

passion because as you might have

remembered I said nothing can break open

a checkpoint only crash which actually

isn't true because in this game you can

apparently send enemies into checkpoints

to activate them

all right

back to that the dragon cannot

destroy music points

and the reason why you can't send

enemies into checkpoints in the original

game

is because you must be able to reach

that you must prove that you can reach

that checkpoint that test

is my

should have jumped

I have a lapse of

so can I get a mask I feel naked without

it

I got to the

last segment

I think I like

I lost so many

why

so this is not the best platform

or do they really count did it really

count as a deaths

that's another real change spawning at

start at 11 mean you have reset the

whole 11. apparently it seems to come as

as this

isn't that the Green platform green Jam

platform it might be it might be the

green gem platform but I don't know

because this game is so weird

try again because now I proven that I

can't do it

this is why you don't break established

series because established Jews have

been established because they were cute

oh that actually went

yeah transfer

that's an interesting thing both both

crash four does then

dying if it's if I'm correct that is

this is what I'm going to check now

because

I will do this

I will not fame

I would show it I need the confidence in

myself yes

I almost ran up

oh

nice

it's so hard to see

where

the girl this day

nice this time I get to keep the mask

so come back to 11 resets all the

exponents there we go there's a death

platform here's the game being awkward

with wow it comes this because in the

original the original Three games

buying and we're starting to get started

level did not count as dying because the

level is basically reset

it better be able to understand okay

and it's so annoying having to exit out

of the leveling into it that's why they

had that room

it existed for a reason

it's too much smoke you can't see what's

going on here

yeah

and look good thing I wasn't going and

looking for the green gem because

apparently this is the green gem

green

yay I did it I did it I got it

oh there's a missing gem there but

that's I need the yellow jumper

but this one also has a desk black one

and as far as I know I need the

[Music]

I think I needed that uh yeah

because there are not enough boxes to

get in normally sell masks through the

desk background

nice

so let's get back to this level and just

clear it out

and then I'm done as far as I can be

I'll take another one of this

as [ __ ]

seriously

seriously

oh my

[Music]

I I did that

I

am

[Music]

singing

that's why I have the tag on my stream

I'm a silly

streamer

I'm not trying to be silly just I am

silly

the important distinction here

okay I need this it doesn't protect me

from jumping down holes but

it protects me from honesty and mistakes

you can't

a lot of chilling I see

it's nice when you cheer meow

I can do this

I did the previous level and certainly

was worse than this lemon

the amount of time he's gonna say that

the cheering emote has been used

I could release that information

but I think it wasn't wouldn't be too

interesting

bye thank you for today's teams here is

the top used emotes or something

I don't know I could do that but

it says how many times

it's been used in total and as far as

now it's been

it's total amount not the number of

comments

so if you send two of them in one

comment that consists use Sanchez and it

also says how many users I'm used to

so it's basically uremium so far

and then I usually use it at the end of

the stream so that's too easy

I should check it

yeah kids even the explosions are slow

everything is slow

now so you can stay

oh yeah I can't keep this mask because

I don't destroy the arrow trains without

destroying the one above it

and we have testing so sure it doesn't

really have the same

power

I mean it's invisibility but

it just doesn't feel the same

as individual games if that makes sense

you put on some shirts or something

premium sending every email to every

email would show up on the list it's

only

it wouldn't be nice if I could see

thanks hey it would be interesting to

see

every single emote that has ever been

used

but it's only for my own emails Danny

but those foxes does not show up on this

dance

well that was an easy bonus it sounds

like it's the first one

I have the test I can change this too

okay

let's see how this goes

wait

oh oh well what was that it might

actually not be any boxes here

[Applause]

oopsie

so let's see how these tools work works

then

let's just be not doing the okay it's in

here

well in that case I should maybe be able

to pick up the gem and then die and then

get down the boxes

it doesn't look like ice it looks like

snow now isn't slippery unless there's

eyes underneath it

but in that case you move that because

you are moving away this now so you get

two dice

he is

yeah these boxes and do gets destroyed

by

I don't need to get these boxes

that's why I think I should rounded but

I didn't have the cam now so I can go

for the other gem

you don't have to repeat the bones right

that's why I have so many boxes

because I get to keep on

well bye for now

so they are hard exit that because

there's no checkpoints

and to get the girl it doesn't seems

useless because you can just die keep

the chairman then go up the easier

infected

I will see

[Applause]

yep there we go

you did that it said 441st and then 147

I don't know it was specifically seven

crates but it is possible that it broke

on the neutral first and then the boxes

are on them and it was that jump he

doesn't do any dance

so I got everything everything is

cleared here for what I can do now so I

got the blue and green and I need

uh I'll just switch page oh that's how

red purple and yellow

oh it's time to talk again are you in

that super weapon of yours going to put

an end to that interfering Bandicoot

where's my patience

uh uh I'm working on a Dooku

listen crash you may have outsmarted

Rocco but there are three more Elemental

masks where he came from and just as

luck would have it there are all

significantly more powerful I have no

doubt that the water element yeah Wawa

will make sure you never see the light

of day

yeah The Waterboy and I are gonna take

you out

rip you limb from limb

but how did the Earth and metal get

destroyed like

what was the point of the whole rolling

scene

the Earth's Elemental mask thingy can

create earthquakes

and that's what they decided to fight me

within the weird

anyway what the place

you've got some nerve setting foot into

my domain without an invitation

don't talk back to me I'll fix that

attitude problem of yours

I didn't say anything

[Music]

I just screamed

vibrational sound option

music 75 percent

and there you just whoa

and no there's no ice cream option I

went

we just have to deal a bit

deep in the falling bunnies on the side

oh language option yeah it is just the

regular options

they support Dutch which has less

speakers than polish I don't understand

why but

they do

it's just how the games do it

look at this these are kind of cute

now they take

oh a green one I see

and with no polish trash they added

products in the second fourth game which

sounds weird to say

yeah it should be an option but it

didn't add Swedish to that game

but but they did that Japanese

and they did that Japanese spiral but

not but not Japanese

it's weird that they wouldn't add

Japanese to spider because it basically

highly translated two of the three kings

I get that Japanese

hasn't been a language they have

translated despite games too

or

I got the

mask apparently

that's why I've sent it without Triple

mask is really terrible for collecting

crates

I don't want it

well

what if polish is trash hmm

not quality isn't trash only spelling is

trash

otherwise it's fine

but I guess

it is

like a pass down here yeah the camera

even Zooms in

for some reason but there's nothing

there okay

oh do you see that thing

someone has dumped up

early spelling is just fine uh this

Islamic spelling and it would be nice

attachment polish is such a meme because

it's spelling is trash

and here now he is the new power up

which is this one

terrible power up

apparently doesn't activate TNT which I

guess

it's a kissing

foreign

yeah why does the camera turn around

like that

yay but I can't turn around again

what

nice inside of the animals

no I mean it's done

I guess I'll try to keep an eye on

it

they sent away in the fruits I don't

think the

maybe the dragon does that too they it

was no fruits

that's good

but they don't pick up that one so

the car runs into any Chinese stops

immediately and

uh Christ falls out of it that's what

killed him

seriously again

this is going to take a few attempts

yeah I'll do it

all right as long as they pick it up

it's fine

supposed to be head for this one take

care I got it

not when I Don't Look Backwards when I

try

I mean there are situations of course

the chance reversing

seriously

very silly seriously

um

am I this silly

suddenly on the other side

I touched it

oops

it happens

yeah I hope I don't run out of lives

oh there you go an extra life like I do

have a lot

I just translating life I didn't have 34

knives

even though I'm dying a lot it's quite

easy

to get exercise in this game

the gem is really really transparent

they wanted to show their refraction

their abilities they had

they may say they make made it very very

transparent so they could show but that

one is white because they couldn't they

couldn't have that many of them

reflecting light at the same time that

would be too much for the console

it's reflecting the question yay six of

them fits on screen

I'm under the water level I'd rather in

water level

is so so tall okay it looks tall is a

good day

probably there's something in here

can you not get stuck

clips

pushing these around

nice bombs

okay

that's what kitten would say nice bumps

oh yeah

I haven't appropriate that little ones

you see more here

no

chest upon

there you are you guys needed

yes

where are these guys flying

this is my checkpoint

I really try to hide equates

attacked it

also what's the point of this can you do

this

oh you can

but this seems

very annoying

is not worth it and if you spin them you

get nothing

hey sex what's the point of this

well well

quick reaction

and we are very appropriate outfit

it'll be a very pretty that you just try

to explain a lot of

lots of water levels

oh it's

well I think I saw like

something

that's that it was like one

one character in a bikini

maybe they like

guys

he's wearing shorts but maybe it's like

swim shorts but that's got a sweep right

so maybe that's the theme of the outfits

can just uh

innocent

okay this time I was speaking too late

I'll admit that but I do feel like the

Heat box and I think is too large

I could be wrong

not necessarily water levels but it does

take place in Australia but

not like everyone's walking around with

means it's on in Australia right

I mean I could be wrong maybe they do

yeah pick up those streets

oops

I touched its cheek and I died that's

also different but no checkpoints

traveled on that way for no checkpoint

I press the button

you keep traveling here

[Music]

behind me

because there's a slight delay

in the Stream

I actually didn't enable this delay for

the my voice

so I was reacting scenes before they

happened

but

which I guess

would be a

yeah I'm really doing 10 minutes

I found two levels that take place on

the coast one takes place in a

rainforest

yeah

so I guess you mean meant that

and there are more levels

in that game that were a swimsuit would

be more appropriate I see

more opportunities going to be

appropriate

seriously

the heat boxes on these things are we

just not meetings but

that was a question is it just me being

bad

yeah I have Canada

not

my favorite game

this one but

my girl is still complete

them on

now

basically could just be me being bad

that is an option

he has 34 lives he's doing fine he's

exercise fine

yeah you're fine

it actually doesn't matter when he

explodes because it is

these Natures are strong if they can't

lift up

grades like that

yeah can you like move the camera over

so I can see where I'm going

thank you again

yay uh

yeah yeah trying to trick me there

yeah even though this is the exact same

design as the other ones you're not

supposed to go down

they just destroy everything

do you have one more ability which is

this one

which will be used in certain moments

y

foreign

before I destroy

wait did this just swim up to the

openest

that he

okay there's suicide whatever they are

calling English

oh yeah this that was one of those that

was supposed to destroying

everything even here

nope

jellyfish

[Music]

no here we go here is one of these

I should activate this

and then I formed this

that I taste that

[Music]

about that

get that as well

and I can bomb that's what I'm at it

so don't run into it you like the food

I am

I am such a fool

six more boxes

I am a food

I love my boxes left

and apparently he has a harpoon that is

so strong enough to destroy this thing

got something

all right then that's left with nothing

thank you

they were desperate to get to these

surface those jellyfish so they decided

to die for it

so I got six more

three more

I didn't see that one it was hiding

behind

the scene

I'm seeing that wouldn't obscure crushed

me right

it's obscure in my knee

this missiles stiff Rich part all the

way over here it actually did reach this

one

it is shorter in at least reunited not

that strong game and insane Trilogy and

I'm probably not that long far ahead in

the original curse came inside there

because they

kind of unloaded the levels what ah

As you move along them okay now I know

they have it sharks in here

thank you

that was a Germany three

now I just need to find the exit

foreign

[Music]

I did it

[Music]

the progress

on oh no two gems on this one Banzai

Bonsai this level you will pray play you

will say

it was that all he had to say

thank you

now I've seen anything behind my cocoa

has their own lives she can spin by

doing a kick

thump

and jump into water and die hello how

are you welcome Alexandra

I came here and actually doesn't know

which money preferred

let me see yeah I don't know I'm just

saying something here randomly hoping

for the best

Coco can't use

crash power naps

so anyway yes I am doing better today I

was sick yesterday in day four and I do

still actually being a bit sick today

but it's it is

so those aren't streams work both got

short

deadly

[Music]

died in the air

I finished work today nice

now you're free from work oh slipped off

I mean that's something

so my house

and now you're home relaxing

watching saying that trash

is cute

what is it the Bandicoot crash system

yes this is cocoa Panic with Crash

Bandicoot system

a little sister even I think

now it is a top-down segment for some

reason but

there we go

oh nice

you can use that yeah I forgot about

this one

is the shadow a bit low here

[Music]

when maybe it isn't

it's actually not tuna

I wonder if when I'm going to be able to

use them I can I can I can show it off

here

oh crash can't do that

I need internet

[Music]

away

the

another clear gem

so this is a place where you would use

it

good luck character

and he did it

see for checkpoint or does it stands for

crash or does it stand for Cocoa

hello there hello

Swati B overlords

that's quite the name you got there you

can see the karate that little past

dangerous will never make her angry

I do wish like this low kick assessing

right like this yes

how are you doing buddy

and not hey

let's say bye

I

I I'm happier here watching some

gold crash game

oops I didn't mean to

jump on that oh

oh

oh

I had to try

oh can you know what works it doesn't

work unless you try

I'm happy to see some

new faces like

yeah

Alexander Gabrielle has been here before

again again I need to

I need to do this in the correct way

it's been there before but not too often

so I'm happy that you show up when you

show up

I was happy to see

and swathi be Overlord you'll be

Overlord

can I do this yes there we go that's

what I wanted

yeah this is also different really

this is not how

a brown sequence works okay

24.99

that's quite fine

yeah I assume you can attack enemies

with it it just a little bit it's just

slower

so

not recommended

thank you

it means like the attack should be lower

considering

how the attack looks but it attacks all

the way up to

your head

and she attacks with her hair too I

guess

she needs a blanket and she's designed

to be dangerous

that's why it's called Bandicoot

and a cute and cute but cool

yeah

that's not always

there we go

yeah here's why I'm not a fan of these

effects

I wasn't supposed to say it funny you're

allowed to land on them

in previous crash games and burn and

I was supposed to jump out with them and

I should do that for the fire isn't

burning but it's hard to see when the

price starts and stops because they the

part of the face is slow

what else

I need it

25 quite

one Beast she breaks the wooden crates

she kicks everyone later we're adding

you she only used her legs she does a

kick she does her kick she doesn't know

how to use her hands

oh yeah and she also does not stop

yeah

oh come on

Coco is dead

this is just an annoying annoying bonus

and I'm not even sure if I can get all

the commits even so I should maybe give

up on this bonus for something this time

foreign

[Music]

and there's definitely a crank there we

need to get

that way

thank you for the follow

Bo Lord

I can hear you I think I'll give you a

nickname but as you are

the one and only you are the one and

only SWAT BB overnight

I didn't prefer if the nicknames are

[Music]

based on your username but for easier

for me to remember but also

easy for other people to keep trying and

and okay

yeah this is actually not enough

as that it's only 245.

so I can't get it without Direction

yes it said I I'm not going to be able

to remember that

and all the users would be very confused

when if I say baby

[Music]

so

um

okay let's see

foreign

thank you

many times do I need to shoot these

birds before they die

yeah

thank you

that's another one

but I haven't got there you go that's

all the

traits

and that's on the boat then

fast fast hello

it was kind of from what three levels I

guess it's a good one

welcome great

I hope everything went nice

what are you

for your stream

I just realized it's the game time shows

crash for Wrath of Court yeah that's

what I put there

another word level

there's something behind here nope

yeah you cannot tell me

how much I have for this game no I know

that is true I can't tell you because

yeah I don't know you

are absolutely correct we got it for

Christmas 2003 on Xbox and you played it

everything ever since every Christmas

is your it's your Christmas tradition

and done it 19 that

would be 20 times now right if you did

requested today this year will be the

21st time

I assume you didn't do that

and Greg says

okay

Harley Army

is I assume playing Wawa

and whatever I assume is that water

water water

so it's not it's about time nope

that is the latest crash four game

which I was going to play but

but I decided not to

and because I decided I thought I wanted

to be because it's running the same

engine as a Spyro which I have modded

and put it and put put the Pom-Pom into

I am by the way

oops

and so I decided why not mods crash the

other crash point and add the Pom-Pom

replace cocoa with Pom-Pom

yeah that's what confused me

yeah crash for it's about time it looks

a bit nicer but yeah there's two cash

this one is technically not called crash

or

the Box

did I shoot beside it

and but

it has been called crash four in

Japan and it was meant to be the first

crash game so it's kind of similar to

how I have written like the numbers on

the uh yeah I I don't hit the river shoe

slightly below them

uh wrote out numbers on the legend of

our games those are technical numbers

are numbered ID just for people's easier

follow along

he's so talented thank you cake

see ya some other time goodbye

what I can see

because I'm asking you to remember your

name

I just be honest with that

a nice time

and now leave that thing to work on food

because this is a combined seven

apparently

quick summary

complete normal and non-exclusive yep

it's a very silly one

throw it away this is awesome

foreign

wait am I

I guess I don't get it there on this one

I read your non-ex non-explosive as

non-existent

which would have been an even weaker

summer

and otherwise

the crash need one

handling

there you go

oh that was close

wait a minute

yeah exactly this will happen

it's not like I can duck and do the

attack or something

oh

I wish that that thing could be

automatic

one uh

I Almost Got Away From Me

he got attacked by the Practical effects

but um

yeah just explode everything man

yes monster here

here

come on

oh no

I must eat

good thing I had my trusty mask with me

do I trust these

yeah I can't apparently just

well can't get down boxes ignore that a

fish fish and dry land

I attacked I'm pretty sure I think

he got these two feet but

this celebratory

bee dance

yeah I can do this I just need to

believe in myself

why do you even bother about things

I mean I get extra lives I guess but I'm

not getting the Box because I've already

screwed up before

I will get back get back in

wait technically if I'm going to 100

that [ __ ]

oh it's too late though

she was talking about that before

again I forgot I was going for 100

it's less than 60 bucks or something

yeah it was probably six boxes

yeah I should I should say yes

when I missed that box I should just

restarted lemon

because I was supposed to get the James

at least I confirmed there was no

okay I got all the crystals time to

defeat Plus

[Music]

we're gonna ring you out

oh such threats and also they

the delay between those lines

this is such an annoying boss

jumped early

oh my God the queen is high give it and

if he died from beanie

oh give me give me a moment to get

through this or nothing it's not

particularly hard it's just

it just a hitboxes of these things are

so high

even though I feel like I'm jumping over

it and it doesn't count

yeah pretty simple boss

and be right back

yes

so

[Music]

probably

go back to that level I should say first

all right mockery of me in front of my

minions

masks but you are still collecting those

worthless crystals well you've gotten

this far and this is as far as you're

gonna get pyro the fire Elemental will

see to that

oh cortex come on I don't need some

flaming masks to help me I can take

crash on by myself

oh my God

crunch you will do as I say

and Pyro will Vanquish crash and his

annoying friends

and if if the crystals are so worthless

why bringing them up

[Music]

honestly

I collects the fruits in that sunrise

for hanging up

[Music]

yeah so this segment must be the short

so

it should be no problem for me to yes

[Music]

shooting some missiles and then

and they those are stored inside the

rock have the standpoint

it's not even a gap for them to be

inside

oh there was a fish there I didn't see

it because it was behind the Green Day

can I shave that thing

how silly

I ran into new explosion

and that's the thing and that's that's

the thing in every craft game I think

it's not particularly this game

but I guess the slowness of this game

makes it worse it is that when in TNT

explodes it has an active hitbox for a

while

I don't like that design

I wish the TNT just had like a single

frame explosion and then

you're free to go there

I forgot the fish

and I missed one box

another said this would be quick it's

a particularly quick

it's mostly because they like

checkpoints

there we go that's the thing

let me set that here to you the whole

section

but now I just need to be more careful

so I don't

get checkpoint

that actually get the boxes I need

slightly turny

oh yeah now I can get it because I've

got to double jump now

this makes this section much easier so

maybe I couldn't get it before

maybe this was a good thing I

started and got the double jump ability

foreign

the bonuses in this this game are

right

oh oh there was nothing to stand on

there

he's floating on top of the water when

he died somehow

so let's see if I can do this again

is that something hidden here nope

they should have something

it went too far

before

foreign

too far again

come on now I can do this

[Music]

wait a minute

I think that's TNT's will explode

happy day

I don't actually have to activate the

TNT

um welcome back

starting in slightly with this opponent

it really gives you random amount of

fruits

in each box that was pretty determined

before yeah these these Advantage but

yeah

and as you can tell that those sneakers

are designated welcome because they

don't bounce

wait a minute

and they also don't

expect that

weird weird

explodes

the boxes

connected to the

but I must walk inside they can just

have free the time in which boxes should

just get destroyed

triggerated question

green explanation mark box

that's it

wait a minute what why did those explode

the greatest destroyed immunity that

makes no sense

yeah we should start this

what

all right I haven't did I miss these two

that was a bit silly

see I'm seeing

I'm so silly

[Music]

nice

does that mean I can sneak around here

too yeah beautiful

I will fill up the water

so I will be back in a minute

so see you in a minute

and I'll be back

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

friend but I'm not quite sure why

is it getting hot in here is it safe to

be wearing that fur it looks flammable

oh

it is

oh I just hydrated but I can add it

again

that was why I was supposed to fill up

with watching because you're in Center

hydrate

four minutes ago

it looks flammable would that be a

redeem

ponpon's fur is removed

making pumpkin naked for real

oh exactly this

back like this

is another backspace I don't see the

point but Sean

hey

don't touch this I guess it was fine

okay

I forgot how they moved

look at this heat

and that's it right not to leave us but

I'm back

I wasn't gone for too long

for some reason it is

harder to see if this

um

if these those are out or not in this

this game then like

there is no

tells me something hey

the emotional damage is

emotional damage

no I don't want to cause emotional

damage

oops I missed it

so in the original game if you have

boxes on top of the TNT and TNT falls

down a step attack plays the TNT

in this game that is not the case I'm

not sure how to do it in this game this

one activated this shouldn't have

activated

which because in this game they decided

that TNT should activate when it lands

on the ground if it lands on a platform

now if you last on a box it's fine it

won't activate

it lands on the ground it activates him

why why did he leave again why did it

leave a gap

no Greek no crying

right now I'm supposed to get this one

like that if oh yeah I think it gets

pretty

and I didn't really need to do that

I did it anyway

one two three four five one two three

four one one

two three four five one two three

point

[Music]

boy boy

's life

the voice is behind the video let me try

refreshing uh if the voice I mean the

sound effect should constantly behind me

in that case

but maybe the uh

nothing

has shifted again

maybe the uh

The Neighbors

I don't know the feeling hello Rocket

Man

nice to space

okay let me let me test this thing now

and I would say spin and then now it's

been at the same time

Spain okay tell me how I think that that

was

oh

I like this one

plus my newer accounting number of

chapters I have changed the voice was

two pounds behind me [ __ ]

yes I think right I know why

can't I kind of those okay okay

oops okay maybe not

because when I was doing the previous

method

it's a very amazing time I mean yeah but

I like it when it's anything

so

I'm going to Dash

have fun have fun

have a nice sleep

in which I assuming you're going to do

but I'm very happy that you stayed

around

and I was happy that you were streaming

today team

even if I didn't catch much of it

I still like your personality

I got a gem now to die

because that's how we play this game

yeah when I was doing the previous

method of capturing the video from the

capture card which I did by doing a

window capture of the capture cards Owen

software which are very bad with doing

it

I guess that capture software has more

delay than the

brand way of capturing it where I take

the video off the capture card and

insert it directly into the OBS listings

which has less delay it still has delay

just listening and I never checked the

new delay I just ran with the old delay

on Fresh run

yeah I need to attack

yeah

yay so I assume it's more in sync now

one two three

yeah I don't want like my reactions to

stuff happening before I think this

happens if that makes sense

when you release me

I'm sure whatever you say it's all

Chinese to me what

I was speaking English

foreign

very simple terms

hey

OBS it's the streaming service I'm using

at the moment

it's an open source

uh cookie time

open source and streaming service that

is free this which is why you see

there's a plain version of it

that's

which I for whatever now is very

and concentric and

depending on what features this has I

might no I think it's a subscription I

don't know

thank you

live trains have changed to Coco

they can't be kind of met

a he keptical imagine you're mentioning

I have no idea what any of that means

since it's actually me

oh

okay I wasn't paying attention

so

now don't think I played this game in

about 10 years they give me back

fancy

that's the exception

yes

I can

says it

go back to the streaming service I use

OBS to stream

it's a software on the computer very

simple like that

all right I don't know

how windy

that part should be easy to understand

the capture card comes with its own

service software which

which has

which you can use to capture

a video using

if you want to

yes time

no no

so if you

just want to save some video and not

stream that's an option

very very simple like that

wow and then that comes up I see

Frank talk around she's she's this cute

thing alone

and the anyway he said the capture

window had its own

as a preview window showing What Spirit

can capturing

yeah

can I do that again

so I was just adding

so if I do this

this should activate the TNT

because it fell down without seeing on

it on top of it but it didn't because

this game runs with different things

and anyway let's pay attention here

so it's this one

and and then uh twist

again I'm not paying attention am I

so yes

and that was just random deaths from

nothing

this protection is so annoying

get peace

and find us out

and there is

and then there's that one and then is

this one

there you go

now I'm Kathy

well I'm almost

running okay run into my dead one

okay let's see how should I do this

okay let's see

I don't know if I should explode or not

but I guess we'll see

Ipsy

finally okay

these jumps I

don't get to use the powerapps

and also

the hitboxes are those fish are very

annoying

yeah it's a sporty outfit for a sporty

moment with all this platforming

you definitely need something

more sporty

I sell enough

come on

and and for the idea of a

you really need to be precise with these

jumps and I need to stop jumping to him

so the yeah and that should make the

picture quality on this stream higher

as well because

um yeah

because it takes the cream here puts it

in the preview window and that puts it

at a certain resolution which is not the

same as the one is capturing because

there's no option to just

give me

Pixel Perfect C output there is no such

option

yeah exactly if I distorted nature here

I wouldn't be able to get the first one

I just

wait

no if I if I get a little box I should

be able to get the Gem at least oh

whatever

okay let me take the initro no wait I

can't die in here yeah that doesn't

matter yes

not missing two

oh I can't imagine Thai

missing two

okay in that case we'll see if I find

two in this level and if there's an

exclamation point at the end of this

area

yeah I mean it's a 80 said

um

gem route it shouldn't be raise your

kids

so

foreign

straight jumps

this game has a lot of non-state gems

and a half annoying here too

fell behind

this is going to be a struggle you got

this

I will do my best

I said that must definitely help me

go

oh okay sure

I'll take it

yeah I'm not sure which tick tweets I

miss

because there doesn't seem to be

anything in this route

all the craziness routes are on top of

neutrons

meaning that

they will explode alongside

so this is only for the championship I

just missed

yeah

wait somewhere

hips

well at least that means that if I get

the Gem here I don't have to fit you

this part

again

go go

come on pumpkin

I can do this

I was so close

what did I what

that jump is a bit different from the

rest I feel like

tips

they have just jumping too early every

time

20 times here or something nah I'm not

going

I cannot kill the mask yet

if you can't even get it

I don't remember you can

thank you

okay you can't do that

maybe we can't get the killed and masked

after respawning because apparently

that's another difference in reunion

and have not even got covered every

difference in Dream Island

yeah I don't think you can

which adds a slight annoyance to

to the game that

I can't

because apparently in this game unlike

every other crash game you can bring

with your masks through the time drum

I mean

meaning that if you start

time travel with two months it's

definitely easier than if you start to

see now

but you have to go and get two masks to

start with two masks

and if you fail the time trial you lose

depends on how you feel it's like dying

you lose the two masks and respond with

zero you have to leave they'll get the

two masks again

and then we try

and it's very annoying

I mean you could ignore them because I

see me you weren't meant to have them

they just started rude changing again

this is going to take a while

foreign

house

so close

oh close

yeah nice you can stick there

okay so that was like at the age of it

but apparently

and this time

it worked walking up over the edge

I'm losing watches

I I I'll do it so there is totally

it's going to be so exciting when I when

I manage this

I've been so close

like I do feel like I'm walking up to

the edge of the Platinum

that's a precise jump

and I feel like that's the only precise

jump to the whole area as in

I've been so precise a lot of the jumps

here precise on this small platform but

the only one that you really need to

work work all the way to the edge to

make the jump

these are precise too but for a

different reason

party

thank you

[Music]

the distances between those and the

previous three are different and I keep

forgetting that

foreign

it's a section right

I've been hanging all day

oh

let's jump one

jump team fine Jump Street fine exactly

jump forward

that car has just so much trouble

oh that wasn't very good

late

the attack was apparently active for a

very long time

I do appreciate it

okay okay oh I was just like that

well it worked it worked too anyway so I

guess that's a celebration

I thought I had messed up day

back to crash I would actually know what

I'm saying now

I'm not going to be that over again

[Music]

all right man I did miss the normal gem

can I I just need to I said since I go

for 100 that I don't need to do the blue

blue and round to get it I have a taste

for some deep fried bandicoat

oh deep fried Diamond I have not I have

not tried I'm not trying panicly but it

could in the first place nice

thank you maybe it's just something

stupid at the startup level or something

like I act like this one

which activates this stream which I

think last time but maybe it's like

activates something all the way back

behind here

as well no it doesn't

I'll ask you the list

I'll just have to keep my eyes open

it's not like I'm playing the game with

my eyes closed

for those two boxes I missed last time

like these I got

tlies

oh hello mister

again it seems fine so far

you know what

I keep the mask in case I need it

Okay so

starting off with beans

wait where does place out of range

on beds

there you go

that's what I wanted to see

so yeah so now I'm missing

those two sets becomes four so forty and

the first set of three

I don't know

what is

yeah I can't see and welcome a little

fight panda a liquefied pants I've

always missed some boxes in bonus but I

can't remember which ones

yeah

sometimes the bonuses are like

annoying me

again

wait what what

is that

you see that

it's three coins

they the dollar trades in the bonus came

back

it's not even a correct trait but

I'm confused

and then it opens up and then is this

question mark and then I go on here and

then I go back

I promise

they are running from the flooding and

then there's a spine

nothing here

and then there's this one

did I do this without time at 1079 again

and it's nice wait so what's that bonus

thing I missed oh no

welcome penny with Andre there is

that the start of the bonus area yeah

but it didn't it didn't jump didn't I

jump on top of those TNTs I think I did

jump on top of those dnds

this is

great great moment say

s your liquid Panda

y'all enjoy it happened to me too I I I

joined stream

then it's the first thing that happens

is the rain

but

since it got rated

let's do

this

shout outs Penny shout out to Batman

when he was playing driver oh I saw you

playing that I never

looked at you playing itself

messy I'm sorry

and I have very little experience with

so I I guess it's the bonus area I just

need to keep track of him

the last mission is me oh you you

actually played through the whole game

nice

nicely done

and then randomized their output of

these boxes

if they did they they couldn't bothers

choosing how much they should output is

I put a random amount

not yet off if you haven't completed the

last mission yet

you guys I'm really sure I did this

but I guess I'll do that for exclamation

thank you

so maybe that's why I said I was missing

seven boxes

because I should only miss four

weeks but we have four five

one two three four five

one two three four

now it says Seth I am missing

let's build seven boxes

wait a minute

I think he's playing a trick on me

his name was last time yeah but weird

enough why did it say I was missing

two boxes it's probably because I

couldn't couldn't count

that was probably I was probably missing

three boxes last time anyway

foreign

yes I figured that out and oh that's

something

so I don't know if you can hear me

yeah there we go there there they are

those are missing ones

look at that now I'm missing four of

them should we

yeah it was 98.1 so it must think oh

yeah I could yeah that was last time but

the time before that that was the one I

was actually talking about

when I thought it was no it was 98 of

101 that time too I just counted 98 100

it's something stupid like that

because

white planner can be a terrible

subscriber that means that you don't get

ads

for the answer to the Moon

here we go

and now it says 82.

and now it says 101 and now it's a jam

let me take a hydrate

the sports bar is over

that

but on the watches

and yay should wait 15 seconds for the

ads to be over

GG do I have a Gigi

no

I have a giggle that's a GG

finally

uh

okay so let's see the ads should not be

over so yes I did get the Gem hey

so let's pick that up

no I want this line into going and

finally I got it

I did get it

I got the chain

let's continue then then I mean

yeah I can't do one more

monkey and the Bandicoot

this one should be

a race apparently

the how do I actually like this is

actually

accelerate accelerate

yeah I think it's accelerating the

factory

but if you have a garage rate on your

axle that's an accent

but on this level so yeah oh yeah yeah

whenever you die in this you don't get

to continue like in the previous thing

oh yeah it was just one more thing by

the way

his liquid Panda and it was that just

just don't tell me the solution

yes I mean that this time uh let me

sleep because this time I had figured it

out but yeah there's another time I

might not have done that

where's the what's with bouncy bouncing

money

okay I'll just focus on getting

my name

don't like to bounce if you see

yeah

I find this time it was it was good it

happened this time at least

so oh

no I think back hello kitten

it's another deep speed limit

it's not my speed in Easter

I just focus

get out of my way

a lot of skidding

and if you bounce correctly he can

actually clear

one of the gaps

that was a weird bounce

he turned too much too much tanning

wait how much does buggies bounce they

must have terrible suspension

yeah probably I was a voice crash a

special one

ah

profiley

thank you for following that means a lot

to me

he learns a lot to me

I didn't say that previous follow and

then I probably found it awkward but I

said that this time

but yeah it's it's every father means a

lot to me yes I know I know profiling

from before so

that's not how you spell it

but it's almost correct

oh there we go

Ernest that's like

different

all right I cleared that one

you can't clear it if you

think you're picking up

well

no no no no no no no no no

hey crash needs to change out here first

gear yeah

I can get the chairman this one has been

we can easy another native tell me how I

dispelled this

it will

okay great time

I will have a great time with the crates

great I will have a great time

ah with the air okay okay

yeah that's how it's pronounced ah

by the way

did I didn't really do that

the driving is is quite something

but I guess I just have to jump down the

hole

I wanted to play I'm missing everything

I'm missing craze I'm using the holes

that was in the hole

let me go next to this

Heat

glad that it happened yeah that is

a clever name for Batman in Swedish

um because that is a species of bats

however that species of a bat is

basically unknown

so instead of people seeing there's a

clever name for Batman Swedish people

could only see it as well they basically

meaning behind us that being a leather

patch

people find it to be a stupid name

because of it

that's lack of one the education I guess

thank you

well his official name is this Batman

in Swedish because they changed it back

to them she's not but I mean if you're

going to

watch a dumped version of it it wouldn't

make sense to you

I mean I

I guess some people do use

the English names even in Sweden so

I mean

technically my name

not ponton but Evelyn is not using a

Swedish spelling so

why did I keep my singer

I thought this would like something to

drive off there I mean again I can't

even die I kept messing up on that hmm

yeah the driving this is terrible

lurking and not that moves that would be

the the term for bats in general

uh here I am thinking he he left

no

lab depends on what lap you

considering you said lead lap

I would assume that's like the the

leading lap of race Maybe

that would be Leah Thunderbird I guess

or

the Environ

why is it driving so terrible in this

scene I give up but anymore

I'm tired I'm hungry it's been three

hours I don't want to play anymore

I will get back to this tomorrow

and I will get what I say

so

thank you everyone for being here

same in background

[Music]

it has been said I mean not quite the

game I will commit the system turn off

the system

I would play at the same time as today

thank you for the following liquify

panda

thank you thank you

[Music]

and let me just read you more of your

messages in Germany

it leather is leather and 11 is

something you can

clean the kitchen with so it's funny to

me I mean it was funny to be sweet sweet

too because I said this means leather

patch

let therapy how did you pass that

transition I don't know

the bounciness on that thing so I don't

mean

so I'll attempt it tomorrow

hopefully I will do it tomorrow the

first thing tomorrow

have you seen the pictures from the

midsummer Festival my friend and me or

nothing yeah I did see them I should

probably look at them more I wanted to

write a comment but I didn't get to

thank you but I'll do that instead we

didn't say what I did say

I even said that I said

so

because it's Monday I think I should

reinstalled you because it's Muffy

it's my tradition

[Music]

let's go and share on Johnny she's

playing best in the game it's that

isometric

pack and slash game I think

you didn't say one stream so it didn't

happen I don't think that's how it works

and if you're a subscriber

you can use this one which I like

because it's cute

if you're not a subscriber you can

subscribe no but you can pay a hundred

card points it's one of the third redeem

or the second depends

um

stuff and you can pay for it I don't

know this one and use that one instead

which was the one I used before

and that's it and I don't think I have

more chance

Thursday Friday I will continue I hear

his tail

that is for Sunday I will continue

drawing the drawing

and

thank you all for being here thank you

all for the following everyone has

fallen today

because Pandora for Friday night three

sweats DB Overlord if you're still here
