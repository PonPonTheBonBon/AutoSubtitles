I'm not kidding game is running

okay I will try to do this

not pretty I should send me some

performance and I would probably have to

sign up

what

is the computer I would of course still

be hard on my phone I didn't think she

fits in me

happy 30-ish

I wanted to switch over to so you can

see the chat the rabbit's a Beat

there's my controlling

oh yeah and then I should be on this

page I can see the ads Egypt I see

[Music]

we're gonna say

[Music]

okay

when this Escape

keeps you setting the mouse pointer to

the center I don't know how it's doing

that this is something Steam

okay

now the way back please

it keeps resetting the mouse

then

well okay let's load back to the map

I hope the audio is nice

I know this last stream when I watched

back at the voice was stuttering a lot

uh oh yeah plus Discord

there we go that might be a slightly

more performance I need

nothing

and this one got a chairman

everyone here this is

11 100

there is no other than that

it's everything

this level has these instead of regular

Mass it got glowing masks

this

the problem is that you can still take

damage and it will be there

well

you have three different mats continue

working in line anyways he's supposed to

count

and

[Music]

let me just quickly let the person down

everyone hasn't come in here yet

okay

I'm here good good I was wondering where

you are if I when you where I died once

you've kept that one

let's continue now we must die anymore

better level when you said that I

completely level without dying which I

didn't think I did but watching looking

back at the video

I actually did complete it on that thing

that's right

okay called doubting myself but I

actually did it

oh

that was the scanning champ

[Music]

and I continue

[Music]

foreign

I thought I needed a gem on this one to

get

I can't I might be confusing the other

one

smelling eyes

they are red

they are

whoa they're standing in their hair

no no double no

okay

um

everything because

because I wanted the colored gem

that's up

I do think if it is this version of

demon

note I only died Once on This level yes

so you know

now twice sorry twice

turn it you are quick

[Music]

I did die that was why I quit I

progressed to level two

yes to see what's up ahead and so you're

right right sorry

I was thinking

oh come on I just picked up the chicken

because

if it is this level I'm thinking of this

should be a red Gem and I have this red

gems

that was another one

silly mean

hopefully there won't be any connection

issues this time so I can keep track of

the time even though I have the action

the time here

upon in a dark levels like this I think

you need to slow down

but there is a time limit

that's different

I mean because the mask when

long is it it is correct yeah

and then the mask is gonna give up and

the light anymore

that can't be too slow

I just need to time it this one

like this

well that was they just jump

I can't I can't believe

okay hi hi charity this box oh that was

my bunny I don't think I'm getting a

bunny

oh

do you want

hey that and that could be interpret in

many different ways

you mean

you mean as a parent what do you mean do

you want to become a level one bunny

that would be nice

oh

look at that

point

that sounds cute

oh it needs a gem and it's a different

game

oh

wasted others

lives

stem from what I have currently

okay

what color Champions I have

set

me that's one now

oh no oh no

I didn't

it's a fun joke

even though I'm the princess here

apparently

neither Community has spoken

you're like a new path by owning the

blue gem as well I got the video gem

right

yes

so it's one of the two I'm missing that

I need nuts

in that case I should be able to get the

gem on this one

I guess I

believe that I can't do that previous

level without dying

which is

same as

yeah so I was correct that it needed uh

gem

but I thought it was the red jamming

again

[Music]

yeah

eventually you should go back in traffic

yeah

that's the plane

let's make one day

let's make me wonder if there's

something important please

nope

don't do not

if anyone wanting me up on how a little

bit going on this one can get holidays

within 100 pieces but yeah

give her a prize

that sounds lovely

I mean technically you also want to

punish me for fame so I mean

[Music]

okay

okay there's the blue gem but

I don't remember

okay

maybe there are no more crates

Hidden Gem

how about that healing cream

questions

don't remember if there's a mask on the

last one or not

and I think it's bad that the timer

doesn't reset each time you destroy one

of those

we could just have the

music restart

that's it

if I get down here

yeah there's a spider

I'm not missing immigrates

[Music]

the mass sleeping car Parker's hair I

had model clipping yeah oops

[Music]

not a fan of my mother flipping myself

Friday

yeah they should considered that

I was trying to get such directions then

oh no

we did contained one I need it

that means I have to

yeah it's really cheap

in that case I have to make an

intentional death

you receive those crates

and then I just need to be more careful

magnets yeah because this one thing

not nothing in it yet that one

now

not that I remember if these counts

towards it

to get attention distance now yeah must

be ugly enough

foreign

wait it's

oh wait there's six planes

that also explains those explodes first

okay in that case

that'll wake up timing

maybe the bonus level desk yep that was

good

be up to date on that

yeah we need to make sure that

everything

um okay that didn't work

new idea

[Music]

no

okay

new new idea

[Music]

Mary should put the name of the

technique name

I mean yes I mean yeah

but at the same time I do want to make

my intention of that's very

clear

[Music]

well I missed the platform

like I don't want to just randomly die

and then say yeah that was an

intentional yes that's not fair

[Music]

I have to like

announced it in advance maybe yeah like

how about like

yeah I have to say it in advance I have

also have two states like

releasing point

okay is that not working

foreign

Ty to do it but

okay I'll try

I do have one tomorrow here

whoops does way too early

wait 10 minutes

oh yeah it's that bridge

I think this this great okay

a new new idea

this is like a castle

and this is

us

there you go

and then I forgot about what I was

supposed to do

okay I have the solution I have it I

know how to do it now

I know

back

I know what to do now no more cooking I

think I see what you're trying to yeah

thank you thank you for the hydrate

okay

remember I needed that I do

it was nine minutes ago but

[Music]

yeah okay

there we go

all right

needs to take a breathing

oh no I don't see

yes I do see the

I don't see any time when it's

zero minutes

and keep messing up that one

okay

okay I I had a snapshot I just

so I know what to do

I just need to do it properly this time

wait here

sometimes I'm noticed uh

um I don't know if that was my fault of

the game because sometimes I'm noticed

that when I try to just jump

it's it's been cracked most of the time

but sometimes when I just want to jump

slightly forward and I don't like great

it moves all the way across the whole

crate

okay

there we go finally

[Music]

so it doesn't happen often but sometimes

it jumps over the whole crane

but I don't know if that was my fault

that I don't know not to go there that's

the best

here we go

oh yeah there's nothing here

[Music]

come platform

I don't miss any traits I had to change

just be sure

and that's at the bonus level because

you're just having one yeah now it does

that scene

and I don't know why that happens

the best only one

[Music]

the other remaining crates should be in

this bonus level I hope

23 of them yeah seems to be correct

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

the two more here all right

if I thought of them

is that all remaining traits

[Music]

it is

nice

no okay you never know

as at that moment

whoa

hello how are you hello

call again

Alex

Alexander

what is Gabriel

Gabriel

episode

five

yeah

still haven't gotten all the gems yet I

still have to go back for those that

will be fun

okay

it said that this was a gem level right

I really need to pay my attention

really good

wait isn't okay

it's got a regular cam as far as I can

see that's the regular gem

Anna can you pass by adding the Jack

Green jump answer that's what they say

yeah I was confused I started said

I thought you said something else I saw

the Green Gem and I was like oh you said

hey unlock the green gym

baptized past path

it's just this

[Music]

should be two right

another

cocoa

okay let's see yeah I'm missing two

colored gems

so I need to break a little speed

because

one of those levels is does not have

called gem

or the 11 habits

how have I missed the column gin

blind

no wait

all right right one of the colleges I

couldn't get because I'm missing a

culture so it's the pink one or magenta

if you wish that I couldn't get so the

last color DM must step for being one of

those three labs

I just remember that

if you squish a blob it'll squirt across

tissue

coin squid

yeah

okay

registered at squirt squirt well they

they are everything

pets when I came in here it's going

squirty

well it's crashed so it's fine

oh there we go that's North Sports

righteous in his face

hey that's the wrong one

that's two

I'm sure you need

yeah it's the best moment to come in

okay

yes I did so it's quiet

yeah

okay if I'm quick it works

no you don't

[Music]

stand still

my kind of duplication problem do you

have and then three of these

last time just two

and then

doing purple ones

again

and now for the final

experiment

those are not so dangerous they would

kill me at least

jump on his head

oh

he has a knee headspired

please take

a question mark

what's with the spikes on the floor

and this last part is so much easier

than the rest

[Music]

[Applause]

he should really be wearing safety guard

when mixing this camera he's an evil

scientist evil scientist does not wear

safety guards is there a reason why Coco

can't fight bosses

no there is no reason

probably because they didn't do any

picture animations with Cocos it that's

the only thing I the only reason I think

that you can't use copies at the level

is it because they didn't do those

animations and then and they didn't feel

like yeah here's the last one

I think that's the only reason like the

last best

he also skipped

last bus yeah last Beast I was trying to

get it to be like the last Beast he also

skip like that

there was actually uh

uh Pottery between that

okay so I should get

probably creating this one

and it is

very short level bonuses bonuses

heavy

make this jump

please

I kept too early that's another day

oh that that one close Charlie

[Music]

there we go

and just to be sure

but that's one of the State Board

inside this there is a TNT so don't spin

this one

I hope the game is instantly smooth and

instead

first sixth place is really really short

I feel like

oh

you really want me to do this

[Music]

we'll see if there was any secrets and

things I think I hopefully it is just a

life I can pick

and

not that required trait

Adrian Super Smash Thank you take care

that's great all right

[Music]

okay so I am required to jump up there

how am I supposed to do that yes that's

nice

I wasn't prepared for that one

[Music]

but if this is going to be annoying

[Music]

oh

yep

[Music]

anyway I did it

[Music]

I linked it in requirements do it twice

there's something

[Music]

I would say that Quantum is like black

bean or

soft or

snooze

he he lost his balance he didn't fall

off

yeah lucky was a nice Academy maybe her

ears with this one like the inside of

one ears that's good that's what this

means

where did you come from

[Music]

well that's

foreign

when you come home from work go to bed

with your large

one and a half meter tall content place

place on top of you

grab your ears

put them on your face

wrap the ears inside of the ears against

their cheeks

okay I can do this

but it does be nice to the bonus level

after the kills again I guess

we should also force me a feature of fun

fun plushie

squeeze the nice fluffy Smith ears and

smooth them and just being online well

I did that like oh that was close but

one side of the Earth is going to be

smooth the other side is going to be

fluffy

smells

[Music]

and there

[Music]

and yes

[Music]

nope

[Music]

how did I do that last time

I have a rabbit class with pics of you

guys

it's nice

[Music]

I also have a rabbit but possibly a bit

soft yes

[Music]

in the game

can I no I don't think I can jump on the

regular crates I don't think that

reaches up all the way I'm trying to try

that maybe I maybe I should try though

nope

maybe tomorrow I feel about to do that

last time

come on last time I did that twice in

our show

if not three times in a row or something

without the issue of this time

[Music]

this time I'm striking

let me do it from the other way then oh

there we go

[Music]

nope

and when it creates a dark day the metal

crates

distracting me dark

[Music]

heavy

come on

[Music]

if this is tricky yeah yeah

but I have done this before

this is why these spreads did not count

towards the uh

the total Freight number in the original

game because in the original game you

did not

all right in the original game you could

not retry bonus levels

imagine that

one two three four five one two three

four five one two three four five

[Music]

okay

hydrate

let's do this

all right this part I did last time

this part too

oh yeah that's when I try to

[Music]

defeat it and then go and practice one

yeah it was this one it tricked me

oh I see

[Music]

this is gonna be tricky

oh

yeah

come on down

repeat

trying to see your body

come on

let's try to type this way

oh okay

let's stand on the other side I think

because I'm clearly

behind the door now

okay

I mean it's completely wrong

it starts in a bit system

okay I can do it next time

don't need to do anything stupid here

foreign

[Music]

I got it

the yellow gems even though it looks

like a hammock you know more gems are

better than none

yeah

I did it

celebration hydrate

so I've completed all the regular limbs

now

is our gems

I mean I guess they complete it because

it takes back why can't Coco do this

level okay I guess I actually know I can

I just realized

okay this level takes like five seconds

three seconds to complete

two seconds to complete

why is it that short because he's

supposed to return when he got all the

gems

which I intend to do

Fame

even though it's all the same anyway

so let's go back and pick up that gem

prime time I don't think so

I guess I'm able to do it

okay what's that therefore

after you get all the gems if you get uh

you can

get to an alternative exit that's what

lemon is for

that's it

so it did confuse me

back in the day

I can do this this is my problem

no

I'm against us yeah I think you think

something like that

I should be able to do that

is the heart there's a second hot level

hopefully that's why we're trying to

smoothly this time

I just want to collect the last

remaining gem before I do the rest

and maybe I should do the whole level

first then

well everything is something smoothly

that is

and then I go back to the very first

level in the game and goes through

everything and collect all the gems

and today is that one additional level I

could got any jam on which I thought

this was another gem I needed colored

term I need it

this is the only colored term that you

need a colored gem

I think yeah the timing is connected to

do that

there's a way

I'm respect

and it never comes back

[Music]

I must tell you that

why did I even try

Journey

okay

well it gives night so

shame it takes so long to restart 11.

okay

it's done and then

I wait for this one

this is a primed lemon so make a moment

[Music]

there we go

barked and downloaded it crafty PC

accessing paper

um stainless bike I have said yeah

even the atmos practice I have to use my

browser on front and it was on sale

recently did imagine if you don't say

foreign

this one is close

yes it's 15 years

that's that's nice

like

a quarter price or something

maybe if he comes in 60 years to be like

standard

so there we go no more dangerous that's

just only three more

getting out from this crazy business and

that's the perfect one

Pink Panther

that's [ __ ] what

is the seven landed

yeah I think these kind of gem things is

is

something

but now comes the funny particles

throughout the previous levels to get

all the gems

but let's do the whole hog first

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

oops that was an accident on this

[Music]

might be an impropriate when the game is

running smooth I don't really know why

it is running so much smoother this time

I'm like

oops I died

it is running so much smooth this time

and I have no idea why

foreign

things

sitting inside there

Minecraft blank blocks of in my high

quality Minecraft like that

that's what I see our checkpoint thank

you

so I can actually use checkpoints for

once

oops

that was my fault

so far no intentional deaths

whoops forgot about that you got the

crate though that's one extra feet

one hundredth of a life I got

[Music]

yeah keep doing that

it sounds so fresh it's outside

[Music]

yeah that's not how it sounds like

ah there you go

no intentional that's needed yeah

there was a few tits

great little oh no I need to be careful

I only got like 70 tomorrow

but I haven't like

yeah there there's still some chicken

Devils that I have died a few times like

I still have to redo the bridge level

because I haven't gotten to the gym on

that one

as I'm pointing to the microphone like

it's the person

that happened there counting this and

that one

okay

it's a shortcut there by the way but

yeah all the way back to the start

I'll start the timer is up

I think it is done it's The Happening

instead but thank you

that's a nice one

and I also did my morning exercises

today

some some morning exercises

get

skunk

and that's skunk

okay skunk

yeah my pronunciation isn't really

[Music]

pep snap

it's early on that

more skunk but it was a death skank

didn't see its skull on his back

many of them

thank you

oh it's laggy up here

[Music]

yeah I really need those extra nice

yes

bouncing a thousand dollars

[Music]

a hot parade of skunks whoa

foreign

I mean their smell must be deadly

good thing you don't think

feel the habits I I fall damage I think

that's it I'm sorry I take damage from

feeling

oh yeah I got that hit

something from the

it's our first time I'm doing this bonus

the first time in this safe same file I

made this one of them because I didn't

see it last

did I skipped on the bonus levels of the

11 second and get all the cremates on

anything

[Music]

um

can you get the diamond even if you

don't

do not die but that's all stuff

hey

so in the original places one game they

require you to not die

technically not Spawn from a checkpoint

that is the actual definition

uh to get the diamonds from collecting

our crates but that and then in crash

two and three on the original

PlayStation they decided that that was

too harsh and they allowed you to die

and continue from a checkpoint and still

get it

so in the remake they decided to

apply the same same rules for this the

first game so you are allowed to die

but to compensate and which they did in

seconds okay or

um because now you can get the diamonds

without without with dying and to

compensate for that they added death

route using the roots I don't know

and

and you have to reach those steps on

those platforms as far as I know

which is the requirements and without

dying while the technique technical

definition is not splending for my

checkpoints as long as you spawn from

the startup level you can retry you

don't have to leave the level

that's it so because the because they

changed it's a rule

and this first game in the remake

we have kind of compensated that by

requiring you to not buy together color

GMC

and they do point that out in the game

when they start and level with the color

gem that's what you cannot die

Carla gems and levels you need to be

together

and then in

which year was it they released a crash

for

the new the second crash for it

which retcon is the original crash for

it

and in that game

they also have requirements for not that

not dying

you have to get to a certain point in 11

without dying

and

but that game requires you to actually

not die they do not allow you to die and

restock from the start of 11.

even though it doesn't change anything

stupid

wait what did I I just got the fruit

from now on

they have added option to restart the

level from the menu but the problem is

that it it basically has clear as the

whole level from memory and loads it

again

so it still takes a long time

[Music]

this feels like a trap but I mean it's a

bonus so

okay

no unless you can stop there

well

foreign

welcome back

let me

oh

yeah

I've added some um

wait what was cut again some animal a

rose on the Discord server

they don't do anything at the moment

I think

yeah you're the fourth

stem emails just for you I would have to

do a custom email or Emoji as they call

it

um

technically I don't have any emojis but

that's not created it is

anyway and

making a custom one for a checklist

then I found out one of my friends liked

the key I did of them so much they used

the complete nice

no I died I'm allowed to die at least

I'm happy and that sounds really nice

when I appreciated finding a nice pink

yeah I made I made a few I haven't

noticed them being used anywhere though

that must

excited I have no experience without

having

I'm happy for you

let's see

yeah yeah I guess I guess I was thinking

it depends on what time it is but I

don't think there should be anything

that wouldn't be allowed here

all right

it's

foreign

must be easier to do like

uh the situation link

doesn't matter

not not that I

showing

uh

it's like real life

I wanted to do this in like quick and

easy way but I don't see Jackie

basically

yeah yeah

you can look it

it's a story of my life yeah I could add

it on the stream I haven't set this up

yet

but you call that

you tried

that was a funny thing trying to keep

the other hands over now

you got a customer like I find me

I mean hybrid

I need a hundred quickly

I need to be I need to find a way to add

so I can quickly show them on screen or

something

she she just wants to know hula hoop

that's what you call it uh yeah

okay

give it a try that's always worth doing

what's that

quite nice first city I want one a fun

one of course

okay there you go now I'm doing it

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

that one

I picked up perfect

the are you uh jackalope

it would be your name of course

but that doesn't mean that's what it is

I haven't

yeah that seems like a friend I don't

actually already it's

it's nice to

see some different animals

everyone is a fox horrible

I guess rabbits aren't you ever had

commenting

I got a discount I can put I got this

one yeah that's the

and but I

mentioned before

when I have set the animals up I should

put up some

probably something someplace

and you can

your case

content to make yourself

[Music]

and as you create the jackalope

again

okay what is so that's enough to the

Stream

after I'm done with the current drawing

I'm working on

foreign

go to this corner

click

choose to add a new server

and then you choose to join a server

from it should be like you create a new

server join a server and then you should

join and then you just type in that code

it should be case sensitive

the captain x capital G and that should

allow you to get into the server

works too

it's probably easier if I look more at

it maybe after the stream if that's okay

with you

but if you manage to get into the serum

again

[Music]

yes yes

fluffy things

what is going to yeah I hope you do you

okay first step on your uh are you on

phone or

desktop I guess

basically

the web version or the mobile app

downloadable desktop version should

still be the browser version just

wrapped

some some paint it

I can go into the technical details

it's basically it's just a website using

the Chrome engine or something like that

but it does have more permissions

because it's a desktop app and not

browser

I think that's now this should be

something that to go on a smart

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

or

yeah

yeah unless

maybe maybe it doesn't work because

invitation scene might be disabled or

something because I can't have the

invitations but you can definitely add

me otherwise

add me

let's press the game

because I might have the create invite

thing disabled and in that case your

mind don't be able to send it

now you can send it regularly invite

they might think I posted about that

works of course

but in that case you have the email link

inside this chord

in that case it should work

all right no Discord I didn't want you

to start

so yeah that's outside this installation

I just realized

if if a Discord you think if an inline

link doesn't work you could post it in a

basically in a DM

with anyone

and then the link should show you uh

something for him well that started

moving

there are a few wasted Chinese

and these are the two remaining ones

foreign

about it

I can try to defeat cortex 2 within 150

deaths

yeah that wouldn't be fair

did they have slippery

yes I got a gem on that one

slippery climb is the worst

it took me a few tries I actually don't

know

I actually don't know which level was

the hardest for me to get the color

German

yeah but that's not the prop 11 that's

like

okay

who has 81 bits so far

what I must

okay I need the bonus I need to wait

this thing out

once 100 lights up was it really

I mean no I've completed that in a few

tries

I think

I think what makes

I think what made the slipper climb

appear harder

if someone is because it's known

and

yeah you might

I feel I can find more times to sleep

with time and lights up

but yeah he didn't do well on that 11

night there's

it it was the hog Nails no only the

first one level the second one was

pretty decent the first one was horrible

because

game was constantly stuttering

causing the game it's causing the level

to perform strange in many states

are the instructor again

started this

yeah it's stuttering there

in a sudden static again it makes the

game kind of unplayable

it was running

[Music]

your lips

this thing had more deaths on the second

Hunger than others really no

that can't be true

[Music]

okay what are you doing

your things come with me

[Music]

I need to jump

I don't want to come to that sunlight

lines yeah that was impossible to play

but we will see how close it gets down

and you see I mean it's just nowhere

close in that case it really doesn't

matter much

perfect

foreign

spawning enemies

Yep this guy is having issues at the

moment according to discontently

it was a poisonous guy They Don't Spray

as stinky

they don't spread it's the spray stinky

smelly it means sprayed toxic can

deadly deadly toxic

but I died from different back of it

let's regardless

in this one

oh no I missed the fruit

you have something nope

[Music]

and those levels didn't count to the air

quite counting the original idea as far

as I know and so I'm not sure and they

don't give you anything so I'm not

really sure what the point of those were

[Music]

next next game

they really should say of how many gems

there are did you say 24

.

how the time has been up for 10 minutes

again

26 yeah it's really should say off 26.

I also I hiked up to the oh what what

what happened

was watching John

week with my dad and called Kenna hot

I mean

I mean I think

at this one close change I completed

changing funny class without anyone

changing before any new record

I mean technically you could queue up

multiple it's just more annoying for me

I've got the status see each other like

before

is that the hottest scene

I know but that would be cheating on me

yeah and I'll say it's more annoying for

me it's much easier to have one at a

time

I don't think

it's not entertaining any traffic timers

or anything nothing I can set up easily

again

early I really need to look up get into

like what to do ah

plugin that can change that at Martin's

based on the things it shouldn't be too

hard I think

maybe I could ask

I'm gonna community that has been

working on plugins and stuff maybe they

can help I'll see

whoops

I wanted that one

okay

it's moving along this is a This Is Us

an odd level a long level and it got

gets even longer because you need a gem

to get

collagen and this should be a red one

isn't it man because I heard all of them

and then my life

cut 99 of them

and this one covers up every double

check

yeah

I thought last one calories is Teddy and

environment

huge fleshy eating

plants

plants

sarcasm

foreign

Cannon would have

and I would Hannah could have whoever he

wanted something it was so hard for me

yeah you're right

yeah

so he has a hard time with cheese

that's why I haven't made a choice yet

[Music]

also what I don't get is the

you can kind of see any grass then

there's a missing spot for some reason

it doesn't show offline pranks

that's gonna activate this

this music okay for some reason

and then go back

okay now I can't say

is that one

the next secret anyway and then you

activate TNT and then you bounce back up

and that's the two remaining traits I've

been having

which I forgot last time

I also I didn't get a bonus

I thought you needed that jam I forgot

you don't need

thank you

yeah let's do the bonus slide

yet I shall send him an invite to a

furcon and half the tickets that would

be fun imagine if it came with that well

for our suit next

what animal would can be

[Music]

[Music]

the big question what animal is Kiana

calories for example would be a dog in

memory of Daisy oh oh yeah

you can see that that does make sense

I have no clue what's going on

to be honest I actually have very little

it's about this stuff

I'm honestly just depending on them I'm

learning though I'm learning

it'd probably be a dog and do not kill

yourself yeah

yeah yeah yeah

would he like he would he like a

princess bunny

a tough that

you do

nah

yeah

it would stand on the side for the

phrase

foreign

back to the bridge level

make sure you have your blocking pen

ready either you're using in front of

accounting debts but

direct attacks don't hurt these high

altitude Hawks low altitude Hawks is a

different thing because these are high

altitude dogs

need work in there and call us all

breathtaking as seen

I'll take my breath away I need to leave

a few minutes

see that was the first one

what the hell is a high altitude Hawk

well it's a hog that is has a high

altitude unlike how then there's no

entity

hello Aunt is your heart is

very simple

very simple concept

can I give a hint

regarding

I'm curious

what the hints might be about

use the ropes no

I refuse

alrighty I really saw the champions

there shouldn't be one

other there's this

no and I can't

why thank you Professor um for sharing

your package with someone with me

I am happy to

teach you more about and the animal

kingdom

if you have more questions I'm willing

to constant for you

foreign

[Music]

to do this

this one activates this

am I supposed to get this one

all right all right

it is an invisible

non-outlined version there

is calculated by this one

no it's on the other side

I don't guess it why why did the

scientists do that I think

[Music]

okay so I found out I'm going to be my

nephew Scotland oh that's sweet that's

points

question is do I go

do I go tracking on here

so I would say

depending on there

I've yet to become a god

two feet

it does have fun but

um

this is Simba I need a honey King raise

yourselves

my love church it's

this like

oh yeah I don't know that so much I know

that song that I don't remember how it

goes

even though I heard it

I have

oh that worked I

don't know

trying to get away from me

my brother would love my sister-in-law

probably hates me for life in that case

maybe

[Music]

it's next time

[Music]

[Music]

I think it's expected oh oh

and in that case

is that

that's the excuse which is fully

understandable

I have a lion king tattoo what did you

expect me to do

but did you expect me not update maybe

my bad morning

[Music]

I thought it would be two planks

foreign

I mean if he wasn't in that case it

would be different

that might be the cliffhanger

trap

perfect trap

[Music]

I don't know I do get two that one I get

to

oh this is going to take a few tries

ready yeah it was good

[Music]

this is gonna take a few times

I will give a hint but you're a smarter

than a bunny you won't figure it out

oh you want to do anything

maybe give the hints

after

something I don't know

what what things now that I've done it

company

when fun into a room the IQ basis

races

that's not how we count that I keep it

I was gonna say follow the fridge but

okay I mean that was obvious

it was so obvious even I got it okay

foreign

I try to read that

creepy tick mask again

I got nice uh sorry I missed that okay

good night Lenny it was really fun

talking to you

you are very nice and I hope you get

caught into the Discord server or get

into it soon

and in the worst case

can I do it from here

maybe maybe she already left

can I

do

now I got things from here

what can I do exactly

no

I try

99 that so far not looking good

stop taking pictures

we need to get a move on

okay this is this level but the game is

running smooth again not sure why it's

about striking though sorry

oh I see have we got to take the same

other peony

silly me

hello it's starting stutter again

collide with anything and I run straight

and again uh

I still get run over by the building

that's just cheating oh thank you buddy

exactly what I needed

let's try it

with nothing

nobody

[Music]

oh the rock bottom one

yeah yeah

I got enough

game too easy but after you collect

99 gems the fruit shouldn't convert to

gems at 100.

they should and you should still collect

boots over 99 like that and that's

what did I do wrong I was just running

that's just the game cheat me again

I'm just running I wasn't colliding with

anything I suppose you've got nothing to

collide with the ball just decided to be

faster than it for some reason

and what am I supposed to steal

I'm just jumping on these things

and I'm just jumping okay see okay I

collected with that thing now the ball

is really slow

now it's really easy for some reason

Oh I thought it was

and a beautiful bun

I'm here

hello

kitten you're not Mickey the kitten

looking airplane

it's starting and mixing up names

I'm missing up the cat in the pool

maybe key to the skies

hmm

I mean you have different color names

all these extra lives I mean thank you

that's the next game

so yeah that was like

zero action this or what was it

does the ball decided to be fast enough

us running for some reason why did I die

actually legitimate one time

okay

hi hi

everyone thinking hi

all right

age

is anyone else here who's chatting

anyone and then there's two more people

according to Twitch you uh hi YouTube as

well

I can't have a question

hi you my name

hey

okay let me look behind it

oh kittens

no it's awkward

beautiful princess

hi kitten

did you like that sound

good it's cute

I'm not even though I would why am I

making this noise

[Music]

okay so I should take this partner

because this time I'm actually trying to

collect on the frames

let's see how many times I die

well

attending enemies into Christ will

destroy them

unless the trades are

why did I do that

you mean timing

nothing honey

see makeup kids

thank you anyway upon it's at 90 days I

think I can still win I

yeah I mean you can count them against

the game cheating but sure it's yours

[Music]

okay let's see

no

let me back let me back

okay that's he

and

okay yes

no crazy look at the singing One

and this is back here yes okay so that's

not great

that actually didn't I had no reason to

go back on the way

open the door

[Music]

of course I did have to walk back here

for the blue tip

uh sorry I didn't sleep much comments I

like this one of the many things I like

about the Buns

the one thing that I can say oh

catching me on this side

well yeah Special you're funny that is

everything you can be anything you want

you'll still be fun regardless but I

didn't want to be about himself is that

like I want to be a wolf

I really hope that all of them

oh my God

I miss him easy this is one of them

and not not yet

yes

and then back on this

Sami thing like

so many traits

yeah

why is this back

I guess I didn't like to get back

anyway

okay

I think yeah if I'm missing

an amazing Creator at the end I guess I

need to go back

because I'm missing 12 of crane

one two three four five six seven eight

nine ten eleven twelve okay

and let's do this

that's the gem

but here is so cute everything

thank you kitten

if I like it when I say I'll keep

it he came from that date before yeah I

mean

I just want to make sure I didn't miss a

gym

I mean okay

apparently that level is laid out so you

actually don't have to Traverse back all

the way

but as far as I know I didn't go like

back through a past that I went through

the other way at any point

and I only went back until I recognized

the

I think

no question yeah yeah apparently there's

a single pass you can snake around the

level

no hers to be sure it never hurts to be

sure exactly

looks like that because I don't want to

get to the other level and then they

have to better

I gotta love the gems here it's

basically the most of the family in the

dark this is the second dark level we be

ready to count it

it's fine it wasn't meant to do anything

but no no definitely not it

I I didn't think

I didn't take anything I have written as

bad

when they are cute

you are cute

you want me to fake it raise me

you want me to fail

the point seven of us

foreign

certificate

by the academy bunny I mean

kitten or eating free for life is kitten

I mean that's that's part of his name

that's that's that's a bit weird

I mean

I have like one person can't be bad

that's at least

and

I I still find it kinda weird because

they're called it the bonbon I'm not

oh that was

that's like my example is basically you

have Sonic D Hedgehog he's not

he's not headshot he's

I hate to share your pain but at the

same time I don't want to lose this

but

yeah I mentioned for both kids yes

hugged Sonic

yeah

why did the frames go

yeah I said cry

where did the frames go what's happening

let's play the game when I have like

really touching at the moment

it wasn't fit that wasn't fun

this is going to be the best because it

came the excited I don't have anything

running in the background

well she's a cute bunny

you're sorry

so I'm cheating on cables again

[Music]

Yep they're full full you're not that

Mouse

it seems to run it's like me back there

but it's been offering

that list is playable apparently

well apparently playable

[Music]

yeah

spiders are working

stop picking up the

chicken

pepper checkpoint

what have we got

I also there's no mask at that

checkpoints they basically give you one

when you die

yeah game is not like running at two

frames a second

there we go I need it anyway the game

tries to cheat but I wanna anyway

if I ever do this again it's hard to

death next time

like like if you got to do like because

I'm going to play crash two and three

but I'm not sure if I will be able to do

that within 100 deaths because

I think maybe because three because

those games are longer and have more to

collect and while they are kind of

easing once

in one way they're also like harder in

another way I think it's because there

are more levels and more to collect I

think that's kind of what makes them

harder

but people just squishy nicely does she

want I don't guess like the geometry

you're actually right because it wasn't

my cable but

that kind of sauce with my cable

don't let your pets chew on your cables

and when someone had a cat achieved on

their entire cable

so yeah you're actually right

you might say

okay attracted dude it's level this time

is a good kitten

[Music]

but Mickey you're not cut your food

also that's why they have us

celebration

if they smell good I'm pressing your

kitten senses telling you to try

cheating at it yeah what do you say

kitten

eater

that's good nice smelling cables make

you want to achieve them

and a cat IRL

and tricky part of the lemon

it's not always like John cable because

they had a smell that you like and I can

imagine like new cables that like the

new glass well

she's probably not

oh

what

wait Bitcoin that's good try to keep her

off the internet

when I was at home she's

[Music]

and it's electric course that's what the

smell

[Music]

yes it doesn't hurt trying does it don't

interfere with the urban power in it no

it's on the signal

but not Unity

[Music]

what what yeah

around that's it

but I'm not sure in the camera they got

other stuff keep my eyes on yeah

but

you know

redeeming some underwear because you got

something

oh

my God

he made it nothing else

yeah there we go

I got my eyes on you kitten

challenge

okay so I'm okay so you're you're you're

basically keep an eye on the cables and

keep an eye out for kitten but but but

then you can't resist the temptation to

chew on the cape as your your regarding

can I see how it is

okay and I got high it's not set

and now you your eyes are glued on that

bunny looking it looks beautiful

beautiful outfit she has

[Music]

let's see some cute reactions you have

[Music]

[Music]

I didn't press completely straight on

the d-pads therefore it counts that's

going to the side and if I missed it

tight awesome

[Music]

foreign

space

[Music]

land space is a type of

that we call it animation is Inspire

this has given me lots of trouble and

they have abbreviated it in the game in

the code to BS

so

[Music]

essentially I don't think there's a

person they're leaving

a little slower

we don't need that first

I got the game

beautiful

thank you

26 the ultimate gem path I got the games

I got all the gems

foreign

but that doesn't mean there's two more

gems

my hips yeah

98 they got all the Champs they got all

the keys the thing that's remained

is the Great Horn

okay

let's take the automatic Camp path

and do the three cone

you guys think the two percent remaining

is cortex

I don't think completing the gem hole

accounts as any percentage we'll see

yeah why can it start on the right and

then move to the left

[Music]

picture

[Music]

the silly Arena

[Music]

the Great Hall of money immigrated

I'm sorry they saw

and I did it

wait how many days did you count like 90

so I did it within 100 deaths anyway

even if you count that it's laggy moment

and we could consider those

I I said I can basically identify this

[Music]

is

a research developer he then used to

proceed of the big entire shop in the

island

after 10 seconds 18 years of higher

education Dr Joshua went to the white on

to write the book when

the one received

I messed up on Wednesday

the motion picture deals after Universal

proportions apparently he's working with

a speech therapist into his addiction

none of them

it's definitely to Chicago and he now

owns an offered a city rights

Sanitation Company he's saving money for

his upcoming

long person after The Disappearance of

his mental doctor they just brought

video we discuss his first love

anything bar

one has heard nothing more of course

since Chris which hasn't happened yet

but even Geniuses are hard to squash

than cockroaches

takes a bit too fast eh it would be nice

if I could just press continue instead

of it moving forward automatically

this maximum guy

okay funny I did more to her conscious

like I promise that I appreciate that a

lot

foreign

against cortex

I mean I could try to defeat cortex

within five days

even though he said 150

that energy points can be deflected back

at him

right now

I you craft manager

oh no yeah that was fun

yeah

there we go

nicer both

and then three for the last one I seen

[Music]

all right all right

[Music]

foreign

thank you

but that was in the air how he cut his

heat boxes

foreign

[Music]

trying to like

[Music]

be prepared for the green ones it's a

bit hard

and not the most Fairgrounds

but

okay

a little skill and I can do you can't do

it

[Music]

this one

yeah this one comes to me

[Music]

and then the blue one arrives oh thank

you I must

I've been dying six times

[Music]

or something

in the original place is a game

you could pass both square and circle to

spin

in Crest two and three they added these

slime thing which she did with circle

and only kept Square for you

in

[Music]

but in this game they decided that you

can only use one leg element of square

to spin

cannot use a circle to spin

probably to not make people used to it

the last one was very easy

does nothing in the first game in the

remake I didn't

slide and Bella flap here flop yes

that is true

GTD didn't even need the mask yeah I got

the mask and then I didn't even get hit

The Mask gave me

Anna has a pain trash does not

compound eating it she beat him

very good kitten yeah

localization team adding Swedish

translations it doesn't need voice

acting on the translations

in this place oh

that is neat

plus minus some

unfair this

I could figure out the exact number of

tests I got

okay I spent good too perhaps you should

get something are you joking

and it only took me two and a half hours

I don't think there's anything after

these credits but how about keeping them

that's why this game

so there's one more level

it's yeah I don't have times to do the

thanks Charles but I can spend the

remainder to do the final level

that is a bit too hard even for me oh

even for you you say

Dorma sent

you could always believe

I want to see you play Crash it's like

age I mean I'm not saying that you're

bad or that I'm supposedly better than

you but for this but but I haven't

really

you might actually be really cute names

I have no idea yes it's yes that I I

don't know how good you know I think

that made me curious

believe in the beautiful princess yeah

I'm the princess here I can do it

on the on the video game playing

princess I haven't played video game

since the age of four so I had years of

it being on a McDonald's

under your belt

hey I have been playing video games for

a long time yeah actually

foreign

this is Thomas and the level they cut

because it was too hard on the keyboard

that's it I don't know if they have

modified it anything

loud that I never I would say of course

I'm gonna try to die as a few times as

possible

[Music]

so those are our first quite a long time

why did those platforms stop me

okay I died

then I said jump I realized and I got

this completely wrong timing

bonus level cup

s now

this is a DLC 11.

it's not part of me

I mean I'm not going to die 50 times I

haven't died twice and that's all I will

die I got some I got some I'll do it

this time

now I know the timing of everything no

more mistake

okay

at this point I don't count anymore

much better thing

on the reference level

I got two I I forgot about the previous

one

timing again

all right let's read this

month

and now

I just needed the correct moment for

this just now

thank you

then jump up here

beautiful

the time is completely now

I think timing checkpoint

okay let's see

this seems easy

limits uh

scientist internet

I'm supposed to get down like why did it

happen here

foreign

me

so wait if there are boxes uh doesn't

that mean there are hidden scam we don't

know there is a Japanese but it's like

it doesn't count it doesn't sound like

it's a part of the game

yeah this 27 gems so you get 27 out of

20.

but I already got 100 and I ended up I

never stay

and that was my goal to get 100

this is

your stand-up stream bonus

50

those things give me a mask

honestly checkpoint isn't too far from

this area but

down there

it does actually

jump Charlie

[Music]

okay let's jump over there because then

you land on Pakistan

unless I mean the earthquake timing

you can do it

I did

stay in town

thank you I'm asked by me

oh yeah

that was a good point about the

intention of this thing I can't see his

intention on this to gain the most

but I haven't thought so so

foreign

I got all the way down

this is important which was which was

again

this is easy

I'm asking about to help me today

that's for sure but sure at least my

second will help me

without asking

okay

[Music]

[Music]

I'll say I found that the drawing book

itself I will show you when I get there

for it yes please do that is

okay

this is giving me this should give me

positivity to complete this part today

he doesn't have a beautiful voice my

voice I like them but

this should be positively complete this

part completed things

at least I got tiny up this point

I got seriously

I don't know what happened there

him allowed it so

you have to jump pretty late on that

thing

that's easy it's just this pattern is

hard

they say hi don't like that yes

click find

device is super adorable and you

shouldn't it's okay it's so nice

what

[Music]

that one

[Music]

how am I supposed to

have masks

[Music]

really

oh it doesn't fall down

while in that case it must be easy

[Music]

oops

I didn't need to

reduce that stack

that can get through

I thought that was supposed to

rush in there and then

[Music]

anything

no not like that

definitely not like that

yes yeah it's okay this is my Mickey

I thought this kindness making me

make making me not being it

Mickey just enjoys it

even though it's drinking

that was too early I moved forward

sitting there with your dreams

I mean

the bonus level being tricky that's

understandable

it's supposed to be

but I still need

I still need something to get across

there

okay let me let me do the recently first

it's well Evelyn you are so kind of nice

I really did try to be kind way

and I don't like to see

I need to be I think I need to react

earlier today

foreign

if you feel like drawing something

please do I I would enjoy

I would enjoy seeing what you

mean it is sexy oh

speaker sexy

I mean I mean

my personalized the voice and that she's

amazing even sexy like an attractive way

I mean I guess she's also sexy when

she's in her underwear okay

again

and then we keep the dress on

[Music]

foreign

no I

don't know there's a bouncing in here

[Music]

I see

[Music]

no

[Music]

yeah I think the stack is too high to

get up on directly I probably have to

spin away some of them

it was all according to plan so she

could change the classroom so keep

things to keep again

if you realize this it's been up for too

long it's okay

[Music]

I mean who doesn't like the secret

company in your underwear to be fair

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

okay

well that's it

and sit back and relax while I struggle

to figure out how to do this

I have an idea

I'm working my way through this

[Music]

still experimenting

so there's that but

then I can't get across

[Music]

wait a second I need my time

oh yeah I can get back without probably

getting back

oh reminding the spin of wheel and see

without underwear but we're not

completely

thank you

oh yeah remember that even if you do

like bits and Subs now they will

retroactively work for the win in the

future so

don't feel like you have to save up on

that to do anything wrong they would

still care

I just need I don't know when I should

introduce me I didn't feel like I need

something more

be like

relaxed like

like on the food thing

and if you have some some ideas for what

you would like me to

do

is without any voice sadly but let's

delete the enemy and then

something that can be stored for a long

time and quick to prepare

myself I'm doing that

caucus clothing follow her on the way

down and not through all up once you

fall down if you take those of me

tonight so everything is flying out

to reduce her fall damage she takes off

her shoes

[Music]

do you want the Harry Potter nothing

more

foreign

[Music]

and that makes crash outside

you want you want to see like all the

clothes of her and fly up

I would think that would be

[Music]

I have precise 30 stops what are you

talking about yeah I because someone

made a mod for fresh work that makes

crash yeah well in her in her crashing

his underwear so I decided why not make

a equivalent months to have cooking time

anyway because I mean that's what I'm

saying

wearing any shoes since barefoot

but when you die

the shoes might be called

there we go that's what you're supposed

to do

her shoes is a completely accepted model

from the

playable character and they still

multiply up if I didn't modify them

there we go

[Music]

so I think so but because something

still has to fly up I

I had to replace the shoes with

something

[Music]

as so

I changed the shoes for her on the way

it was the best thing I could come up

with

and she doesn't have anything else she

could lose one point now

just kidding though

because laptop with the shoes yeah they

that's it that's it

okay

completely wrong timing

oh man

I mean you don't see her

after she fell fall down but you can

always imagine

no it's okay

I mean

I don't think that's the idea was so

hard to come up with it but

anything else well

what uh yeah when she only has one thing

to lose

[Music]

I still haven't completed that mod I

should do that

but um I do also want to replace Coke

and weed

fun fun

but I mean

thank you

I could also

Beyond this point nothing

okay

this was the wrong side let's let's jump

around the side

like every class crash four has has

different outfits

I could have different outfits

performance this one

so this is right

no I have to step on it up there I was

just afraid

I was too scared

the left side

well that's fine

here's a cute everything will there ever

be a spider for

no

I mean this one is called antigen

dragonfly

I mean it wasn't original crashed

forward which was uh the brassal cortex

but I mean that depends it never

happened

oh I messed up again

how did those Spike things harm you and

despise themselves are at an angle and

which one could easily stand without

touching a point

and

yeah okay that is a good question

you should easily be able to stand onto

those

uh you cannot get on here to mix up tons

of series on the time history

yeah I've heard some people reference

that he has made cover do you remember

something or

or some says that he has predicted that

it will happen or that he has proved

that it will happen something to stop

this through humorous views rumors

anyway

it's on speculation is he you see

it's some of someone in the

social networks team besides that hey we

have this Aspire

IP and

and people like spider why not why don't

we just put a perspire picture

but yeah why not

and defense comparison this means that

it will be a spider for no it doesn't it

means nothing

rude

yeah if they did make a

well if they did make another spider

game that was it that and they make the

same Facebook crash but they reckoned

all the history of Spyro back to where

it was

no Amber no Cinder

and worst of all no Flame

is such a boring lazy candy

and my beautiful idea of

everything is the four characters with

different properties of the board

oh

let's make that jump

why can't I make the jump

why can't can't I

foreign

ers

yeah all at least

like

I don't care about that stuff I want a

vision

plus

I should I should I should have just

jumped on there

no

that's a half to your day today I mean

when I've been playing Crash obviously I

want a birthday so I'm feeling good

wait I'm not supposed to go back what am

I doing

[ __ ]

this is so hard

it's almost like them it's made to be

hard

not much left of the lemon

and eight more trees

I need to approach this next section

much more efficiently

like that

how about that

I just stream myself about those days

but don't care

to find oh nice nice

I didn't want to see lonely do you do

this lemon

foreign

especially succulent inspired she looks

weird

and that's nice but there has been good

I started out today super good

yeah and then

I was also talking

and you and and then talking to me

talking to the community

it's nice too

whoa uh Falcons

[Music]

end of anime

add add

if I have to add the store my center but

I would have one I would like

I wouldn't add my contacts

have I died 50 times already

that's already

right

wrong timing

number eight now I have not died 50

times yet

[Music]

and you still have plenty of lives left

I mean yeah

whatever they like

20 times already

oh

so I wanted to make a

no

I want to make a community drawing that

which I mentioned before which

is Banning there

with the

with our with r for sonas

and then

so you're basically have to come up with

this stuff you if you want your tank to

do

licking ponton I don't know

am I doing I personally have to wait

I need to play and get that feeling

shaking fun fun

no no

[Music]

I also didn't start in 99 when I started

this now and so

sweet

fast chocolate bars definitely

well that's nice

yeah if you don't appreciate it here

okay is kind of weird

that's how you did

all right

okay I don't get what that was for

I don't like moving Birds

that means I have to redeem everything

again

I'll get this

the Bear by fun I got to do something

else and maybe come back when I eat this

lemon I got to do something

oh I gotta do something

got the excitement watching her

underwear everything on the very old

stream almost

lucky is very lucky

just kidding kitten

that's exactly how I was how he was

intended to that to be Dustin he's sure

I'm supposed

I don't think that's you how are you

supposed to be I mean it works but

that is not intended to take damage

let me on this

not that that's the wrong problem

okay

that was awesome now I don't have the

mask

it doesn't matter I I missed I messed up

the timing completely here

wait a minute now I go

there again

I thought I had it

and timing

and the game started lagging

that was fun chasing this

no Rocky primer

well I guess I this is when I should

have the

golden mask anyway

can I see it properly

this is how you doing

so that's how you do without making

damage

and that's how you do that

really I'm back I wonder what you did

well

I got 67 knives that means I lost

probably 20.

20 25 lives or something so I still like

125 deaths or something if you include

this one

how is this kitten how

but anyway the ads should be over now

everyone should be back in case someone

was watching the ads and I did it I got

all the crates and I got City gems

foreign

[Music]

eats now

and then tips and complete

yep and this you can also get even

higher percentages

because they are things like

the titles

but it is

verily 100 2017

these are the type Trail on this level

and

oh no it's fine private stuff is pretty

big traffic

I'm gonna test that then but I'm I'm

happy with that

that was a nice run what do you think

how did you how could this be

f

okay

okay fine like I said I will add more to

a commission by a silly but it to be

good of course of course of course I

would you have seen you have seen what

I've been able to do with my city with

of course

I don't want to make you disappointed

and you you do know how much care I do

put into the work I do so don't you

don't worry about it

you complete two percent okay too yeah

that's exactly what it is

it's like asking me who I like I keep

that perfect I

oh yeah

it's not Pete one oh it's uh twitch

doesn't like when you put things at

touching each other I think that's I

really I really wish uh uh twitch would

embrace it putting colons beside two

things

like uh Discord does so we actually can

put things with next to each other

without spaces

which you can do with actual emojis

I didn't ask that

you're fine

okay but this thing was fun it was fun

it was really fun and and Bets did

actually make it exciting I'm really

glad you did the bad [ __ ] Edge because

it it really makes it exciting

I work in the chat box

maybe it's I didn't actually pay

attention to that

spaces

and it worked the first time and

I mean if if you just add a space next

to it it should work which should do

that automatically but I guess sometimes

it might act weird

and as you can see and because it's

Sunday today I have updated schedule so

Monday Tuesday is starting at the same

time and Saturday Sunday and that's

because I'm going to do the art

and I will finish the elonidio

bunny fun fun drawing Bunny not bunny

just like this is there

English isn't my native language that's

not obvious already

[Music]

um and uh yeah

and I will draw for more than three

hours because drawing doesn't take as

much energy as playing games

[Music]

can't wait for the art I like it when

you draw yeah yeah

I've been amazing with other people that

showed up for the drawing streams I miss

[Music]

oh that's nice that night are you

working

because you're using the same time so

much as me

oh I mean central European

so when do you think if you want to

share when you get home

someone said you yeah you can what you

want that

if you want to

I can't admit personally I'm not too

much for watching votes I do make

exceptions but it's much more fun to

actually be communicating with streamers

be honest

[Music]

7 PM now I need to convert 19. uh yeah

that's probably after I've stopped

drawing

and it's a dance morning yeah yeah

even though it's really fun when you are

here

it's fine don't need to change

well I wasn't going to change it

[Music]

100 oh did it did I forgot to

[Music]

open it

[Music]

I didn't

foreign

[Music]

and and the uh and for the drawing

uh

as far as I plan out the drawing

is so I said of the

will be next

and then

I will draw the emotes and we can work

together working I mean I will draw and

you will be in the chat but you can give

like suggestions and

and also a big critique that's very good

because I did I I do take critiques and

I'll take the critique for the uh emotes

let's say that

I'm not too much about uh worried about

critiques don't worry about that

so

[Music]

yes okay and then after the emotes maybe

we'll do something like the community

drawing

[Music]

that's why she's okay

so

[Music]

which one it doesn't show me

so

[Music]

yeah

and then I will try your I'll drop on

first and then I'll draw your personas

and we'll have some funny group picture

and and that's that and we'll talk more

about that when time comes like how

everything should be composed but for

now let's make a rate of sense Sensai I

guess Sensei since I opted which is a

person who I watched very recently and I

think I think he's funny

and he's streaming uh spirit fire

I don't know what that game is

but it's funny and he has one Watcher at

the moment so I think it's fair to at

least say hello

he needs a few more he definitely

deserves more questions

amazing thing fun fun yeah the bestest

thank you so much for the sleep thank

you Mickey so much for showing up

it's always great when you are here

you make me so happy that she's a cute

Honey Bunny and thank you kitten but

also being her and also being here for

so many streams too you also make me
