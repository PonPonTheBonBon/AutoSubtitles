hello

I hope everything is working

we have

one viewer

and of course the one who is first

I've seen the only video

is of course a very important anyway

the only one here

nice

everyone is important

so

everyone is my friend

foreign

[Music]

yeah you didn't have access to that one

U and four three other people meant to

say

two people are 800 bits from having it

one is 8.90 one is 900 and it's 998 one

is

and everyone else is one thousand I

still know because it only shows like 10

people and

but can I see

okay I can see that

you have the Donate at least one

thousand because that's that's part of

your advantages but if they have a one a

hundred and thousand you really should

have one in a hundred emails for one and

a hundred

like

having an emote it was just a single

beats might

seem a bit silly and you don't have to

like conclude that

as a stream if you don't want but it

really breaks the barrier

as far as I know if you have something

that costs some it doesn't matter how

much it costs as long as it costs

something you're cutting out so much

people

yeah yeah 150 times it doesn't say I

mean I do have to eat like

the what I'm trying to say so just

having a single bit for an emote really

as an option for distribution include it

could break the

barrier for people to just start

donating it

and I think that is something that

is beneficial to Twitch if they want

people to donate me

and for people who are not aware I guess

that would be to everyone watching the

model afterwards

and foreign

when you make

emotes

and

nothing when you make it but when you

upload emotes to Twitch

and currently there's a a thousand five

thousand and ten thousand bit emotes

I can choose obviously I can choose what

goes where but I don't even have to fill

a slot

if someone doesn't want to offer a 1 000

and have the lowest s or or five

thoughts whatever and and what's low is

to be

ten thousand that they can do so

and that's exactly why I think they

really should have more steps because

dreamish can freely choose which they

want they didn't do or not

the best would be to allow streamers to

add an email and then set the price

themselves

just like how you can deal with a

redeems

[Music]

that would be amazing they're probably

never going to do that but

[Music]

all right and just opening up the

project here in in the drawing software

so let's see if this works yes there we

go

[Music]

let's make the

new

oh that's the right

there you go

nowadays that as far as I can get at

least and then it should open the

preview picture so I can see which view

is open

[Music]

so I've changed the thing here so I have

now

the default outfit and then I have the

currently the phase shift Optical one

a bit more organized this time

[Music]

and I'm also upscured I haven't updated

and I have said I guess I should do that

now I have obstain notes

at least for all the

camera outfits so far

if

whatever the game works

redeems don't make money like this like

English I yeah

yeah I mean that is that is one of the

reasons

um

so yeah that's why I don't think they're

going to allow you to pick any amount

but they should definitely add more I

should make uh

I'm already planning on like requesting

two

making to requests to Twitch all right I

should have and it is a single privation

being

and one being a requesting twitch to add

pronouns as an option because it really

helps a streamer if I if I could see

what people's preferred pronouns was in

the

and the chat itself if I'm going to

refer to someone

in a

gendered way

just sometimes

it's up and sometimes it's just easier

because sometimes it feels a bit clunky

trying to avoid doing that

so

having uh being able to see that right

away it really helps

because of course the pronouns is often

include because yeah sometimes I'm

referring to someone

in the chat in the third person they

might just be in the chat so

being able to

know how I should refer to them would be

quite useful

so

number two

so yeah so these parts that I need if I

duplicate those over

I really wish because when because here

is a window that is puffed up

and so currently I'm screening capturing

chest thing hold

software itself

so it doesn't catch proper windows

but I really wish it did sometimes oh

but you're licking me

Torito

so no wait there we go so if I try to

position this properly

and now we're going to see the quality

difference

No Doubt

so I don't show how well it shows up on

stream actually but

it really depends on which look you go

for I guess

because one is a bit more rough which I

guess

if that's a lucky one but most notable

on these ages like this

this one's so much clearer than this one

but I guess I guess in some way this

kind of roughness there is here

it's kind of part of the style of it

I've been eating these very easy to make

this oh

but then a rabbit shows up and started

licking him on and now I'm hiding again

I want some

I could try some Doritos

but I'm not sure if there's any place

that actually sells them

there are other brands I guess

[Music]

[Music]

Okay so

that's usually starts

I'm not sure what this first should do

oh I have the list that's so far but

I don't know give out the price

depending on who gets the first suppose

maybe maybe because or something like

this

I'm just not sure

there was a company

but you might have heard of called

Hasbro

uh Hasbro

and

oh Hasbro yeah they yeah

they had a data link

where

[Music]

content of

this one show was released

to the public but not like not like

open it to the public town

[Music]

it was basically in secret

shared between I didn't know if it has

Sprouts are freaking that it happened

and if it happened it probably going to

keep it a secret anyway now releasing it

for everyone

um

I don't know

but uh yeah if it's a secret it's

probably going to be very hard to find

any information about it

point is

um

it was on the original content of bad

show and source files and everything

and obviously that's a embarrassing for

a company to happen but at the same time

I think

it would be nice

to have that but like

crash and spiral

because it's really useful when you're

modding

and then these parts

is the show My Little Pony if that's the

show

always oh that's the one I was

interesting

all of a sudden I can copy anyway

so my pony since that was now

let me down my parents had I decided 17

is like about the secret to see

Nana

and I think it's my turn

but um

um yeah so my opponent is a vector based

show

foreign

do you know it was a cross Dragon which

is like the human form of my opponent

which is kind of a weird thing instantly

birthday lunch

because

um

the show is only released in like

rasterized video format while the it's

made in vector and then

and there are vector like Thomas vectors

Sprites being released released that's

poorly drawn vectors but with the source

files you get basically get all all the

original body parts and you can kind of

make your own animations I guess

obviously

even if you have the fight it doesn't

mean you have the Skin So or any of the

setups that the company has because they

might have rates the victory files to

act in a certain way

so maybe that information was also

released but it might require special

software to run in that case

then yeah it's not going to be a huge

issue morning yeah

see regulations

you said you're looking for crash yes

crash four and inspiring I did which are

the games I am moding that I cannot

obviously I don't wish it to happen to

the company because that would be a bad

thing but

I've lost in that mind having device

[Music]

but I mean

Toys for Bob which are is the developer

for both games

[Music]

have

done a few mistakes already

releasing fires they shouldn't I mean

shouldn't and shouldn't

I guess there's no harm

I guess I could show

[Music]

so

letting it show and uh on the screen

this is Coco's texture

as it appears in the game this is the

actual texture used in the game

[Music]

there is a file included in a first off

it's in a folder called old

and then there is one with the exact

same file name except it has a V1 on it

which is this section

and

original V1

there are some differences

and it's interesting which differences

are first off the hook texture is a bit

more dull

so so this is the darker here

is the original

the one used in game this V1 a bit

brighter

but another difference you might notice

is these things

that

doesn't exist on me one there's also no

gaps here

but in original tennis caps today

another difference here is that this is

smooth but the the one used in the game

is more

um

can I missing chat

and to see a girl to be back in a few

months behave because saying ships don't

go very fast yeah we won this version

one yeah I assume

and so these scenes that are missing V1

these are part of the the ear fluff okay

so it looks like they kind of added it

in like post

which is why these things are the only

things

on the whole texture that has a black

outline that does not apply to the eye

because the eye has

like backgrounds and that's kind of

that's kind of not what

basically this is the shape of the

object and then there's black around it

and the eye has the black is part of it

and of course there's black here also

that doesn't make much sense that's mine

wouldn't add you like that

so whatever they did to add those things

it's really they're not showing that

they're added in the afterwards

basically three as one

but

clicking back and forth here I don't see

any difference between the V1 and V3

they might have made changes to the mesh

and made a copy of the texture just in

case

but they didn't do anything with the

texture however they are also V1

versions of the

metallic normal map and roughness map

and but there's no V3 so the V3 might

not actually there might have been a

plan the change in texture that never

happened as well but this is just on

special collections

backup

no idea why these fans got included but

they are included in the original game

taking up 51 megabytes all

without reason

maybe they're referenced by some files

I don't know

I don't think so

apparently there's no

cool version one that would be quite

interesting interesting to see

so anyway

and it's not only that there's also in

spiral

and where

maybe you can see if I

if I open up the texture again it might

be really hard to see though

yeah it will be really hard to determine

because this this texture has been

compressed

causing these Square shapes artifacts

it is working at 4x4 great

unlike for example in a

jpeg which is working a eight by eight

points

um

yeah it's kind of hard to see and

then kind of a smooth

Shadow angle I want a sharp angle I

guess

but yeah I guess this kind of proves it

it's the

the way it fades here from one to the

next texture is very different in sharp

steps

and that's because as far as I know they

they make these Textures in four

thousand by four thousand

didn't show up but

that's weird

because that is

there's a pop-up when I make this

selection

again as I can see I have Peak the

system but yeah it is is this this one

is two by two thousand five but the

originally four by four stops and then

they have scaled it down

and that you can determine by this

because the edges between this field

which is one UV part and this fin which

is another UV part the difference

between the the border between those are

short and sharp Pizza Perfect edges

I'm talking about German stuff now I

know it is

going to be starting with May 49th We're

not gonna buy something and for the week

you guys you shall get some ground pork

massage

our case scenes as well now I'll be

spending a couple hours

sausage I like to try that

because what I'm so

everything I'm talking about now can 10

big periods by one simple it's a proof

and nothing has proof it's just

speculation but I would say that these

are quite

cute guesses I would say

and because Inspire others is a chat

board detection

[Music]

this one

and this one texture is 4000 or a

thousand every texture has the same

width and height almost but if you zoom

in here you can see that these are Pixel

Perfect borders there is no form of

ingredient at all

it still has this compress in here

though but

being mindful about that but other than

that the border between these nice line

but the border between the parts are the

Pixel Perfect

this means that when you which I can do

this now getting this down you get two

thousand by two thousand

okay

and now when we look at this border now

we can see the kind of uh

we need a shallow angle

yeah now we can see this kind of a

stepping where it steps in the way it's

created crosses the gradient here like

the scale down versions they have made

not enough that this is proof but I'm

pretty sure they make their Textures in

four four thousand and scan it down to

two substance

and for some reason they did not scale

down this texture so we have the

original or thousand texture of this

making this this is the chat board which

is used in the bonus area of Spyro

it's the only 4000 texture of of the

models in the game I know of

there might be another which I haven't

noticed yet

it has high quality Inspire himself so

this is certainly a mistake

they must just simply have got to scan

it down before they

sent the game out

however it was not touchable who worked

on this third game which that actually

is part of so it might just not

so it's possible it's probably nothing

but will be playing here

that fire it's a fire detection

excited

I hope you enjoyed that um

information

[Music]

if there's anything else you want to ask

about yeah and probably

give more random right

I sure did but yeah that that's

basically what I want from all the

textures

the four four thousand texture for every

texture but not only that because as I

showed the textures are compressed I

want the uncompressed for substantation

[Music]

but yeah it's not like they're going to

release that

so let's switch our

ear

and the next one

which

one should be the bottom one

I am not sure why

such a tight I decided that I'm not

supposed to hide the old ones because

they

kind of covering up what I need

you

there's only coming up the parts there

I'm not going to anyway I'm I'm a bit

weird I guess

come on with me

I can tell people how to make sausage

yeah

[Music]

laughs

I was the freezer hadn't been left open

overnight oh that's

bad

not enough

anything to make near about 130 pounds

or 60 kilograms of sausage that's a lot

of sausage as well as about

80 dollars worth of sashes I have

already made

oh

yeah I bet

oh

[Music]

okay now

I'll put these here underneath the cold

ones that I normally need

this one should be more yes and take

your hand

they should be two

FC

if I jump on you

M which I guess it's just empty anyway

and

R and

well finally

T which is completely white anyway so it

doesn't matter

to put it into a length that's almost

two meters of sausage that uh

that's a lot of sausage

foreign

sausage

and so

um

let's save this station

wait a minute okay so go into face shift

where I was saying it I think

because I really should try to keep this

more organized now

then the antique chain

and the r texture r

hello I am working on

let's switch over to blender I am yet

again working on

and she would have she won't be naked

underneath the armor looking thing

it would be quite the daring

Style

so for face shift I should make a copy

of this material yeah that's what I'll

do

I think there's a face here

you know to make a face shift

I guess so

one then

wait why is it called to fit all right

all right you got the different one is

called face it out

and this one is the these parts are

using the multi section I'm not going to

move them out to a new texture

which I have to do

so that means that

if you look at this

eh

low qualityness which part would show

the local that's the best

let's say here

and then I go here and update it

this one

and update

there we go it's nice the quantity

okay

another reference but we can update the

roughness two minutes

[Music]

nice quantity

and this is no quality

and this is high quality

oh hello Pandora

[Music]

yes I am in deep knowledge

I am

from Sweden

I've been living

born in Sweden

I've been living born in Sweden I wasn't

living when I was born

I was born in Sweden

well I guess I was living after I was

born by leaving as in

uh what is the English word

[Music]

I'm from Iceland but moved to Norway oh

once I have

not there's probably a lot of people

around not many countries I'm not I

don't think you have

been in contact with anyone from Iceland

it's not a nice day nice to meet

someone for nightland

[Music]

hello I'm Slavic

[Music]

salutation

hope you're well I see hope

I'm not hope

I see Missy I've seen

Evelyn icing

trickster cat

oh well

now your hair contended an Icelandic and

Norwegian

hmm

yeah I've been in contact with some

Norwegians before so I guess you

and some are from Finland some of them

then Mark

and that will cover all the black proper

Nordic

countries

I mean obviously my I met a lot of

people from Sweden

and then you could consider Overland

Islands

but I'm not sure those counts in

Greenland does that

they are part of

the proper countries

as of now

so yeah so this body is specifically

made which we see here face shift the

body so I will remove the legs that goes

down in the feet

outline

clear that's it

and that's it uh but um

yeah I couldn't really make it look good

so I'm gonna give up with that idea

obviously the important part would move

to

um yeah I don't think I can make it

shorter and still have it look good

yes

they count because they're everything he

did not use two books and yeah they hurt

well I mean yeah

they aren't really

pepper

independent countries

like

they have like they're not like even

members and stuff

uh yeah I should probably do something

about that this one

oh

I should probably try to move this over

again because these are spread out all

over the place

here they are

oh so many so many

well I guess I'll better get going

but as soon get started

I won't leave the thing I just realized

that because I was going to leave the

stream or not I'm going to be here

going to be here modding

okay let's see which phone should I put

it in

oh I'm not reading that's fine

skin

baby I'm happy to have a lot of people

here because I did that oh my bad don't

worry uh I've been I've been having

trouble sleeping tonight and I got six

hours of sleep at least but I woke up

like

and

our two and a half hours before I

started streaming so

so

um yeah I'm exporting

so I feel like I'm might be a bit tired

but if I get to talk to people let's go

too

let me switch to back here because now

I'm going to add you be here I got got

good

gets to talk to people it's going to

help me keep my

energy up so I'm very happy that people

have decided to join

and also I just realized

I put e above C that's not how the

alphabet works

as far as I know

[Music]

technically that would be how the

alphabet works if you follow the

Hawaiian alphabet so that's some random

languages is my

my thing so anyway back to your comments

Roxy's sorry for thinking like I just

want to be two minutes okay

you know the comments between them don't

be leaking

what fun fun trying licking her teenies

what's with it once I'm licking now what

about Estonia

hi Sonia wouldn't count as

yeah estonia's Baltic not Nordic but

they're welcome

but there yeah

but I mean Baltic kind of splits Sweden

and Finland so why isn't feeling the

Baltic country

me

and Sweden could just as well be called

a Baltic country it like borders the

Baltic Sea it's about to say right

so

it's known as the Eastern Sea in Swedish

because it to the east of Sweden

I heard it's more confusing this idea

than this with the Stones

it's basically mostly only considered

plastic not Nordic

as far as I know

I don't think this is much of a

confusion there

but I mean

I guess I guess someone could say that

they're like a bit yeah I don't know I I

don't I don't think I haven't heard

anyone like saying that they are Nordic

only that they should be noticed that

they should be left in the United Club

um

yeah

what

it's a dog anyway

it's uh something to look in to that

thank you

yeah um let me um

[Music]

so there we go and maybe I should make

me

watch a bit more obvious

maybe a bright color because it's a

doctor

here we go

now it's easy to see them

so well I guess I'll just cut each part

out and

add it here

on but this is on the spot place I got

so maybe this will actually be quite

hard to get every part in there

as you get going now go after the other

work ahead of me today

after I finish that up in time to get

back before the end of the Stream

happy shopping

hope it goes well

and yeah as long as people stay here and

keep me company I'll be I'll be

streaming

otherwise I might fall asleep

I just feel tired at moment but I said

I'm

I'm here talking to people so it's fine

whoa whoa

didn't really

oh yeah yeah they really

did put them

that's bad that's bad let me go back to

Planet yeah I think

wait which part is that

um

is

[Music]

when I wait

[Music]

and then I should probably just select

one of them

wait wait

oh wait there's some oh this this part

around since I have no idea okay I see

[Music]

um behind the body

yeah here we go here's the black parts

I guess I guess that's because on the

cocoa body they actually take me to the

body here

yeah it doesn't

I don't think I should done that anyway

but anyway

shopping making sausage later bye

everyone here is from Europe and I'm

probably the only American here

automation I'm actually from Texas

and not everyone is from Europe yeah

people are gonna everywhere

it gets a bit confusing because I guess

when he said that he was Slavic he went

more like his Heritage in Slavic methods

he hasn't

things from Texas

I know there's a big confusing when

people talk about where they are from

and mixed with people who say where the

heritage is from

oh

so hey

[Music]

yeah so I mean you you're not too far

removed

and

[Music]

yeah yeah so

my birthday can be a bit confusing me if

it just phrase like

Slavic and

polish yeah but yeah

mixing

making ancestry and

and place of birth

or like a place of uh habitat

I don't think I said possibly not that

I'm the only yeah you played the same

thing

yeah

these people yeah you actually put a lot

of effort into that

and that's

they're not be

I was looking forward though okay yes it

was

you have done a lot of effort and that's

and that's something

I didn't know what I'm talking about

nothing but yeah I should I should try

to why should I even start

I defeat using this same

um

I do think yeah yeah it appears that if

these shoes are using the same

parts

so I guess I start there

starting on the feet

starting on the feet

this next will be this

let's make it Pink

or

[Music]

no and I think I'm preparing I will add

just a piece of padding

but probably not much so I have more

space to fit stuff in

oh Jack craft demons I have no audio

percussion work but I'm here lacking

thank you for the team

and then

that better get sick

anyway that means that guys yeah go go

what do you mean go go don't be

okay

I mean YouTube

don't get late

before they close the story

and also so you don't miss the end of

the stream to see how far I've got them

I really feel like I'm much more like

like last week

I had much less energy but I do feel I

have much more but I think I like her

like

one person here last week

and I just didn't appreciate anyone

being here but it can be a bit slow on

his

but no one's chatting and if it feels no

no pressure to check

[Music]

just allows me to

interact more and it's more fun

for me

and

[Music]

so let's see

[Music]

and I hope it's fun for you to all of

you

[Music]

come on

why is it struggling so much

how do I do this

in a smart way that doesn't take you up

too much

too much panic

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

okay

I'm looking

[Music]

[Music]

today I don't know why

is it gum become hotter

cut them easy it's been a bit of cold

colder days previously

[Music]

yeah maybe that's why I had trouble

sleeping

a warm night

[Music]

when my wintry bunny

[Music]

[Music]

and I can't stand too much heat

or I will melt

[Music]

yeah I think it's kind of part of this

theme of my

yeah I think someone asked if I made one

point

is that would reflect the

like winter

and I guess I guess so

I haven't thought too much about it but

that might actually that's not uh

bad point

[Music]

I do prefer cold and winter

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

waiting on that

[Music]

and then there's these parts that are

also part of the shoe

[Music]

[Music]

welcome

it's a trans wiggle even

by Ellie Brown

this makes me wonder if any

is trying to swim because it's doing the

ordering emotions

trans hair

this

and Sprite I don't think that's pretty

I need more of it

I've been thinking of having like

Pom-Pom maybe with a translator

herself is trans and also the sports

environment supposed to be over for like

an hour again

I have lots of Trans on Twitch and

and every every friend is a trans friend

because because before they are your

friends they weren't a friend and then

they didn't transition to become your

friend

and therefore every friend is a

transparent by definition

or stupid joke

wait

you would be transcontinental if your

parents suffered two different

continents right

what if you can like track your yeah I

mean if you go far back enough everyone

though isn't like only African would be

transcontinent and so on foreign me and

my

job situation

foreign

typical me

they could also work

stop stop doing this

and they can also work in transport

I'm hanging for a bit but I have to work

on my car

is there anything

[Music]

I hope it's not anything serious just

like

like maybe I didn't say

all right all right it's easy to fit I

wish you the best I hope it feels fun

all-in-law are going to help me oh

that's that's nice

yeah I I might need some

some help of my car

send help

yeah

I hope it goes what

and that you have a good time to get it

yeah I don't know basic hearing that

person just to give us a hobby but

that's that's great

[Music]

I mean someone being so experienced with

the stuff

you have like a brother who is

quite a lot into

computers who has been willing to help

me

help me with my computer issues

um

problem is that I just sleep so far away

[Music]

I am in the process of moving so

and in the process being I'm basically

cleaning the house

which I'm not doing anymore because I'm

speaking

it's fun steamy it's fun being

chatting with people

it's very nice indeed bought him some

Scotch what they have

I think Scotch tape

but I think that's some kind of green

[Music]

Sundays yeah

um

some people have like told me like well

at least you live alone so it's not much

to clean

and I haven't ever had any routine of

cleaning my house which yeah

there's a bunches to clean

I have not been

keeping my house clean

[Music]

so yeah

got some strong stuff too

get it cleaned

I mean that's his purpose

[Music]

anyway okay that should be enough I

think that's all the parts for the shoes

[Music]

as far as I can see that's that's on the

part

so I would copy these parts over and

then

start putting them together on the new

texture or pumpkin

yeah it has it I seen that I I just took

me a while to

realize that's a hinge

[Music]

come on why is it so slow now what is

happening this window

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

but

and

and that's why I hope my brother my

brother

can help me out with um

setting up any computer

[Music]

come on there we go

[Music]

second hand one that runs so much

this is a gaming laptop but it has its

limitation

no promises though

I can't I mean

my

my brother might not be able to

won't see how much

you can help me out

[Music]

so good thing so start with these Square

things

I think I should have started squatting

maybe because

because these are small so I could just

stuff them anyway

[Music]

the should manage start with the big

ones and then

[Music]

let's start with this one this is a

cumbersome part to work with

so I will actually start with this one

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I can then

[Music]

I prepare everything

that would only move one of these in the

planes

there's a spreads out the original

picture

uh hello Pandora yeah I had to do some

moderation on this card because someone

was trying to scam me that's

Sunday it's it's actually something that

doesn't work that's why they continue

doing it

and yeah good good singer

you're there protecting

and then when they say moderation I see

me running and some server I had some

camera so show up

[Music]

and that's why it disappeared a bit

that's fine that's fine

take the time you need

let me see I'm only saying it's uh can

you just disappear whatever machine yeah

but but yeah

if anyone needs to take you need to go

or any reason obviously you have all the

rights these are no need to excuse

yourself

[Music]

and I'm not the moderator but I'm

practicing moderation oh that makes me

curious

what's it was it like a practice run of

a like a fake scammer or was it actually

scammer and they wanted you to

manage that

a man sharing and scanner it has tested

up

because I love seeing people yeah that's

that's great

maybe you should be a moderator here

there's an access camera oh I hope it

went well

hey you stop scamming

me

okay I wonder how far down I can move

that

and

that's me

check

okay remember what is Discord again

no it's good I remember to blender

so like

I could modify the shoes to make sure

that there's no clipping but I will

remove the feet anyways it doesn't

really matter

and even when congratulations

but I don't feel like it's necessary

because it basically better than Easter

anyway

I must go work on my car on the car and

like shift my credit card good luck and

probably I hope it goes well

oh

I wish you the best

so no more clipping that means that

just fed less down

like here

[Music]

if I'm keeping it as this for now

that means I can export these

UV

which doesn't show up in screen but

export

and then when it shifts view that means

it's done exporting

[Music]

but that means I have a free wait what

as I only said now this this was the

food

[Music]

but I don't like it I should contact you

ever means I don't remember I don't know

which song it is because I'm playing the

music through OBS and obvious doesn't

tell me what the song is called but it's

it's that part

yeah I like how the melody sounds there

but for some reason that's when the song

ends

I want to hear that song

don't end it when it's like many begins

so remember to and I promise it on

everything

I can probably figure out which song it

is because when I put this on YouTube

and

this happened on what's on YouTube and

the it does tell me it was like the uh

like the Cobra donate which is fine

and then

it tells me which song is

and I do think it's good that it extra

flags that song because I don't want

them to

like flag a different song and then like

3000 mini or something

because it's like that song and there's

no restrictions it's basically what's

going on

that's a good way to figure out this

song is

but then I need to find this moment

anyway

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

one persistent

trigger of a song called unknown Title

by an artist called a noun artist

and I'm pretty sure that's not as him

because we claim someone as hey you use

Incorporated content of what I'm using

well something

yeah but you have to tell me what it is

then otherwise it's certainly not

invalid

[Music]

I'm not sure why

because I don't have to enter any

because when it hits it and by the way

because I I think I've seen people kind

of

put it on me on YouTube so I actually

don't know if you can place the YouTube

but I guess I could

inform any twitch streamer about it

if you get a

false claim that basically telling you

that you're you they are claimed that

you're using a song that you're actually

not using

[Music]

um you can make a report

that's saying that no I'm not using this

song but then you get this page where it

asks for all your personal information

which

you probably don't want to give out to

anyone obviously and it's also annoying

to fill it out every time you want to do

this but the thing is if you're not

using

this song that is claimed you don't have

to give up any personal information at

all

which

is what I've done

so when I get this especially when it's

unknown like learn an artist and like I

don't that this song is not used and

then there's

two usually one other sign that

sometimes shows up

uh it really depends on which songs are

playing during the Stream and when that

shows up as well I just choose this song

is not part I'm not using this one

and then I just the only thing you have

to fill out is your name

check that you understood everything and

you sign it by writing your name again

which then has to match what you wrote

before and then you extend it in and

then it takes like for me like one two

hours or less

and then twitch has released

it's the claims

[Music]

so no personal information has uh aside

from I guess your name

I haven't tried just right one or

something as my name because I'm not

using the song I don't have to fill out

anything you just I'm just making

um

[Music]

one thing I wish there was a option to

do was to because sometimes when you're

playing games

it's flanging the songs of the game that

the game has which is the case for

Spider-Man and Spyro Legend Spyro

and sometimes I I just wish there was an

option to like

uh

like I could I could send in a request

that yeah I'm playing this song as part

of the game itself I'm not just playing

the song randomly

unrelated to the game it is a big cross

I'm playing the game

and then

if that is a loud reason to play the

song they can release the claim

or if that's not

I did

if they if they don't care about that

reason they they still don't allow you

to play music on the Vault and well in

that case they can keep the game

and I couldn't uh sure in that part I

should probably not would be put on

Twitch but

everyone who make ads

these automatic stuff

but which run they could add an option

that yeah people are not allowed to play

this music that's why they add this uh

automatically claim in the first place

and but if if it's actually part of the

video game itself

in that case it's okay

so twitch could still have some

automatic system having that

then making it

convenience for everyone

just an idea

so let's see now the numbers don't share

of the screen that's 21.34

so many times

okay wait um first off I will move again

I'm not sharing these uh well everything

off screen

[Music]

so they're blocking and things I can see

what they have mode and not move okay

now we're moving down one to one set

four

uh 21 was 34.

and then I move it

uh back on screen

and

now but I can

make your thought Bears I think we can

move to the edge like this

fine

I'm not about 15.

there we go

one of the parts has been placed

so I can keep that so I'm hiding the

parts I'm not moved yet and then I'll

keep the parts of Handler to be small

I know they're occupying the place

and here I can delete

this because I already copied them over

when I can unhide them maybe or hide

them running

may you place them in grouping

I can

this time

again

so let's

deal with this big thing then

this one looks a bit cumbersome to get

in place

this but I might be able to put or the

legs previously was

come on come on I shouldn't change which

scenes connected

yeah

sometimes uh yes well it's

sometimes when you speak almost random

stuff

[Music]

I just need to find the location of this

but now I can't place it here because

yes it's a bit in the infected rotated

that's too much effort to create parts

I guess not

let me see

rotate

[Music]

here here it doesn't

treat perfectly

so I'm placing it there yeah

yeah it's a slight over there but that's

okay

that's okay

thank you

[Music]

I mean

that means I do have to make

changes to this one let's bring it up so

I can see it properly

without change there there's

now that if I rotate this one will be

wrong

and to make a copy of it so you can see

how it should look originally

so I can adjust I assume let me just

beeper

that's the wrong one

uh is this one red should be changed to

green vegetable Rapids that one

and green should be changing it

and then green what affecting that one

should be inverted only the image down

okay

this is interacting with green this is

flipping running image

so now let's check here

now we can see on this one that red is

left to right

we have a good cursor case so we see

like it's uh

I guess it wasn't the easiest to tell on

this one but it's like dark here

you got dark and light like that

kind of saying here

is left to right

[Music]

but maybe it's easier said I'm clean

[Music]

the answer of a welcome back everyone

who had hats hmm

anyway this part is dark

this part should be dark so I should not

interact with them

now wait

[Music]

oh yeah yeah yeah yeah no I see nosy

here's the works if I rotate it

no no it makes sense for my brain

if I rotated this that was a really

really really think I'm going to see I'm

going to explain because then my brain

will work he if I rotate it this way

because red goes that direction that

means that including those that

direction

I mean

that means I should invert green

yeah yeah and then when I rotate it this

way that means I should make arrows in

color

[Music]

obviously

[Music]

red goes that way the arrow points in

the direction of in

e this is my angering because that's why

that means that when I rotate it

according to the white Arrow

the green

points in the wrong direction

the green is now red and red and red are

green that means that I should invert

green before I switch the colors

that means if I rotates back

now and now I have set inverty queen

first

that means that

taking the Green Arrow

animating it

so now green has been inverted and then

we rotate it and it's still correct

because

the increase in color should almost be

in that direction in Unreal Engine

in blender the increasing color goes in

that direction then kind of slight annoy

hints

[Music]

but I'm working for multiple early

Legends it doesn't matter how Blended I

said it just means that if I'm going to

preview normal maps in blender I have to

invert it you mean this is a setting I

can do with like Global only probably I

want to be surprised

so now

[Music]

is it yeah yeah

I think I think this is quite sometimes

it's hard to

no

[Music]

don't do this back

of the tricky parts

making sure it's correct the positions

[Music]

so what I how I do that

is by

[Music]

taking one of these at this

yeah I think I think this one's fine

now duplicate this over again

I will save these

as a face shape

same

but I switched out to blend me

update there we go

now I must find something here that can

be used as a reference and I think this

works as a reference

so I will use this copy this because

this is a perfect reference

but as we can see it's almost perfectly

on the pixels thereing

you can never zoom out and to get about

any of more accessories I'll take it on

the screenshot

so that means that I should move this

and place it so

this gets

which is here

in a similar way

so rotate the 90 doing good

degrees

and then I place it here

and then I check my references

so this one should align there

and there

check the Border reference which I

should rotates I get the right

yeah this looks great and then I just

make it

perfect I don't think I need to be more

presenting this

because you're not going to see it's

such a sniper so now it has been rotated

and positioned correctly

move back

and this is what I mean by moving

everything off they are they're moved

exactly one

a picture to the side so now it's still

showing the same thing

but at least I know which parts I have

properly moved and which I have maybe

[Music]

nope I still have a few more

[Music]

but I could split off the shoes

and call it shoes

and then I can switch it over to using

digital texture there you go

[Music]

since still networking process so time

to move back and work on more of those

back from the grocery store oh hello

[Music]

particular

[Music]

one hour 10 minutes

I thought it would take longer

one hour 10 minutes since you said that

goodbye

and then of course you had a lot of

other stuff today

it's like

putting on shoes unless you're that type

of person going around with shoes

indoors which

[Music]

so warm at the moment that um

don't tell anyone

yeah

a little bit yeah

[Music]

about 30 minutes east of here and yeah I

still have my work boots on

going around with cheesy that's how I'm

topping himself I guess

I prefer to not have shoes on because

that would be so uncomfortable for my

feet

foreign

thing I guess keeping shoes on

but more times like

just like a cartoon character something

loves a lot of times

yeah my my hands would probably not like

that

[Music]

so let's take this part these looks like

another large part

on the side of the

shoe

sound

BF yeah

I'm usually bad for that one but I'm

going out again after he got to burn my

mouse track because I didn't watch this

playing Minecraft to my audience

yeah it's good to get to see here yeah

yeah

keeping yourself safe like that

it's good

but yeah

all right

but yeah hey if people are free to do

whatever they want

um in their own house of course

I think I think a lot of when it comes a

lot of this stuff is like

people try people can sometimes get very

defensive like I do whatever I want and

it's perfectly fine but I feel like this

community is much more respectful and

that might be

and like yeah you have my ideas and

opinions but everyone is allowed to have

their own and and we're free to share

all of these

[Music]

it's not uh you know like ideas

and opinions

I am oh it's not the best time

[Music]

stuff but I'm trying and trying I'm

trying again probably is it's an

automatic transmission I'm always trying

to find the clutch that doesn't exist

and if I do push the third battle that

engages the parking brain but that's I

want to be good

oh yeah

I'm kind of parking

hell or something

I haven't been driving a manual in many

many years and I've only been driving a

manual like

three times

rugby

happy here happy happy

because I don't have an answer I drive a

menu

and that is like

I have only two cars don't ask me what

happened today first

and the bus I have been managed

in a while

so first move this over

maybe it's 1601 pixels

and now if I drum

oh oh you're asking what I mean maybe

you did

die

because I that makes more sense that you

were asking remaining

because in our spin here but after this

one so I had too lazy to change me yeah

and I don't know much better but

now it's I'm experience

very nice I mean there are like

differences

there are benefits and drawbacks

and to both system like automatically

this is definitely more convenient

and it has since it tries like an

automatic will be quicker at changing

the gears but however a manual you can

plan which gear you want when an

automatic just has to

assume which gear you want from your

current action not your future action

because that would be impossible

the best part is that in a uh VMS the

other teams I think

which I mean you can do that in in an

automatic team

uh depends on which driveways

but

if you know any entire acceleration you

press down the acceleration uh the pedal

and then it can depending on the car of

course shift down again to give you a

quicker explanation

like I said the an automatic like this

is modern automatic cars they are very

quick at changing gears when they do

they get changing

is

because let's let's be real the the

machine will be faster at doing up a

machine designed to do a task will do

that task quicker than a human willing

to adaptask but a human can land in

advance for what is necessary for a

given situation and that's difference

between uh I would say and manual

Network

thank you

and too much traffic here that's that

everyone tries out there yeah I'm gonna

get an even a small town but

that I'm usually don't change not

changing gear but I mean if you if you

drive manual every time you're getting

used to it and attention yes it's such

an automatic process

oh and I don't need a jumper cable and

see from random property transmission is

nearly push the car once I was there

enough to be the champion but clutch in

there I guess

by that means jumping system

comedians

inconvenience

no one that knows how to play around

here well

maybe I should sleep in here

yeah

in Sweden you must take your driving

license

um

or manual car to drive a manual car

otherwise your license is only valid for

automatic cards only and if you have a

license for manual course it's also

available because

and the only part of the whole process

that requires you to do

to drive a dry manual is the very final

and

I guess it would be a co-final okay a

test

uh

where you do the actual physical

training

coincidence you can remember that one

piece

perfect okay very fiction

so um

anyway heading out again

you really need to make sure your phone

is charging very ways that will be there

before you read this yeah probably

it's different over there

[Music]

um yeah anyway lady

[Music]

but um our weird thing is that

things one in this case he was from

Texas that he would have

a license

I don't know how to try and Driver

License works over there but yeah

clearly there is no automatic manual

split

but then you can get a international

driver's permit

and there are three types of them but

United States only accepts one of them I

think it's really nice it's two of them

and you can only go to countries which

have the same

permit

so with a U.S license you can drive in

Sweden

but then the web scene comes in the U.S

license

does not differentiate between manual

automatic Sweden does so how does that

process work

[Music]

anyway if you don't you live in Sweden

you actually have to take a proper

Swedish Drive license

and you can't drive on a foreign license

if you are actually a residence in

Sweden

you can only do it as a tourist

which might sound a bit odd first why

tourists have like more rights than but

I mean

how would he either day I mean they

wouldn't really be able to track

tourists like learn this way I guess

like I would even

track that kind of stuff

so either tourist has no rights

of driving

[Music]

yeah

I don't know what I'm talking about next

it's one of those things that might

sound a lot first but at least to me it

makes sense

so yeah anyway

so and then

all right

[Music]

[Music]

let's see if I can squeeze this in some

way

that I do need to save some space

and then finally

all right

come on

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

yeah it's gonna it's quite warm here so

I'm kind of

wearing less at the moment

[Music]

thank you

thank you

[Music]

I guess the sports bar can I reflect

that one

so

I have to move the correctness

[Music]

there

so I want to

this movie where it says like

uh

[Music]

an organized moment

[Music]

oh

my God

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

unhidden shown

now I need to put this somewhere and I

guess I'll put this

[Music]

against edge here

275

me

[Music]

275

and I'll move it down

[Music]

to 2020.

because now it's over that means I'm not

good so I need to move it up a bit more

[Music]

37

[Music]

there we go

then I just need to squeeze these other

things in everywhere else

foreign

[Music]

yeah I'll put it here so

now it down

five seven six

[Music]

five seven six that's the number of

lines on upon unlocked in the machine

which is not used anymore

[Music]

470.

there we go

into position

[Music]

I wonder where I can pick this one

[Music]

foreign

like it fits

but not exactly

almost

could fit it here

then I need my resume

and shoot if it fits pretty one there so

it's almost like it's much fit here I

could probably put one of these smaller

on there

[Music]

and just

[Music]

we're gonna move down here I guess

2771

first step

move it up front here

509

I was wrong direction

account

and then move it up

21.

it has been moved into position

I got the notification of my phone which

is amazing

if you want to see everything it says

like I've only started streaming or

something no it was

[Music]

I was hoping to be like that

and like ignoring YouTube right

okay first off I need to figure out

which part is that the phone there must

be this one

set and then I will do it

10. this one like that

and then we need bound

563

I think that maybe that's a bad position

actually

you know what

a reason for this thing to be further

today right actually

[Music]

yeah

same

because that means that I cannot

everyone

move this up slightly

saving a few pieces

I mean why not

okay

only 10 pixels but

better than nothing

so

time to move the next piece

[Music]

[Music]

laughs

[Music]

and it's almost the way up there okay

what should it be moved

foreign

then it has to be moved on

107.

probably not the most efficient use of

space

the machine is squeeze it in here

okay

69.

[Music]

certified

[Music]

eight

yeah maybe kind of

you know and then as you probably move

[Music]

isn't this one

[Music]

you did that on the Gap that showed up

second line

[Music]

and then 36

came out with that one like at least

look before I guess

so

and then the last piece

when it shoots

[Music]

[Music]

there's amazing that some cuts off too

early

well I didn't make it so

[Music]

maybe that time they wanted it anyway

2387

okay and they're making a nice

[Music]

bunched up here very nice

the question is never fits they rest

above in there

[Music]

oh

[Music]

I really hope I do

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

so if I save this now

as the face shift

[Music]

and then moving on to blending

and here's how I moved them

after this there you go this is what

this should look like

the shoes aren't done

[Music]

can I yeah yeah

we spot all this thing here

I kind of need the effects but you know

what I'm going for it's for teachers

yes it's an easy effect

[Music]

so I will just

export the

normal

[Music]

let's see export

[Music]

the face shifts normal

[Music]

and then the roughness as well

quick work on that

that means that now

[Music]

update there you go and that would

shifted quite a lot

[Music]

way well

but this is

Disneyland supposed to look

but now

[Music]

it looks like it's off

nice

[Music]

is it this that's us

[Music]

that's weird

that's really weird

it's gonna fix that

[Music]

I thought it was Pixel Perfect with my

replacement

[Music]

and Mickey

is here

[Music]

anatomical

and even the tuft of hair on the fox is

beginning

[Music]

and it you hear some bouncing

it's just squishy [ __ ]

[Music]

hello Okay

um

I'm having a slight issue here

it doesn't align

for some reason

I thought I made everything perfect but

maybe that's not the one let's

misaligned maybe

maybe this one has Miser mind

[Music]

I think in the shading it doesn't align

that's why

why wouldn't we survive

well with that hair but whatever

oh Mickey

oh you and your engine

[Music]

yeah I need to

I already made changes to it

excuse

let me

take a look at how it looked before

all right let me replace this texture

with a high quality version of the

texture

which is this one

there you go

[Music]

then I will

Maybe

less nice kind and sweet

of course I don't want you to be in this

kind of sweet

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

oh

you you don't want to be eated

[Music]

maybe I'm

I'm trying to find a good place where I

can like use this reference point

but it's not there's not like clear it's

very soft

I will actually tell you that my mouth

tastes like strawberry you are free to

eat

yeah I don't know if you combine I still

haven't fixed combining earbuds Emoji

but it's breakfast

foreign

wait

don't eat me I'm just a sweet little

bunny

trying to find a good surface point

and I do find a good traffic

[Music]

it's like you're so sharp and a headline

I've heard but mistakes rather well

I don't think I'm eating a bunny

but I know some people have

and that's cool I mean if you can eat a

cow of course you can eat the bunnies

once

wouldn't it otherwise be kind of a

critical of me

if I

ate cow which I do if I wouldn't allow

people to eat bunny

so let's see if I can get that point

corrected

Sushi over here

it should be at this point

you shouldn't do this one

and yeah

yeah this isn't working as a first point

I'm trying to use this other before but

there's no there you go and I can't do

really determine which speaks the switch

oh all right this is going to be harder

that I thought

I'm not eating bunnies either but you'd

be the first little Nokia yes

um

such

such

[Music]

such an honor had been the first one to

eat

[Music]

whatever you use this one maybe this

one's a little bit clear

more so

[Music]

it's that corner

let's see if I can

find that corner

super this one I think

[Music]

yep

let's see if I can make sense of

distance switch back to you this one

I have hell is placed in the correct

position

um

so that's not wrong and

[Music]

this one should be in the correct

position

so

[Music]

very confused at the moment

[Music]

this one is also cutting in the grapes

this is just that

this misalignment

[Music]

uh

oh yeah that is why it looks wrong it's

wrong in the original too

nice nice

that's why they they have made it

incorrect speaking into it

[Music]

oh you developer is yours something

you are something

on my way to eat tampon But first you

need to hug hearing he yeah yeah

papa needs some hugs and then we're

after you hug on she becomes soft and

easy to eat

foreign

trust me

against them in the same way

so this one should be made one pixel

that way and then I move

this one

one pixel that way

there you go

that means that they're more aligned

it's not perfect but I mean they must

adapt to begin with so

what can I do

cover the seeds from a distance anyway

didn't annoying me

interesting don't trust me

yeah she got this thing around her chest

covering her she needs something here

and then she got on the original cocoa

[Music]

um now she's naked

now let's take care of it well there it

was this black suit underneath and

that's of course what Bonbon should do

this way but I mean

you could also not wear the outfit

energy

is you know having clothes on what

we can yeah

definitely sick legs thicker arms

your fingers secure body everything is

okay one funny Stitch

then Coco is seen

that's

and that's how it is

[Music]

okay no I already got this

I guess next part is dealing with

Easton

whatever these are

and then downstairs

let's see if I can throwing them here

I have these

no problem I can do that

again it's cute

[Music]

if only I was speaking in certain areas

laughs

[Music]

okay let's see how

how do our best

capture this shape

or should I just do yeah same thing

again maybe I should just do the same

thing again

copy everything against

glare

take transparency copy everything

best

like this thing

[Music]

and

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

yeah we'll see how easy it will be to

make that black outfit underneath

because I would basically just add the

stairs straight to

I'll keep the Pom-Pom mesh as is and

then I'll just paint the textures on top

of

that mesh

casting outfit is as far as I know skin

tight

or I guess in this case fertility

[Music]

another message he said that right

yep

[Music]

button looks good enough very tighter

I'll cheat

and outfit kinda like that

sorry if I'm almost the only one walking

no no it's fine it's fine I mean I'm not

sure I'm not sure why you are sorry

about that I mean what what is your

responsibility about other people not

right

the only thing I can think of is that

you're saying that you should not write

anything and I thought it'd be right but

no no no please please continue to ring

I've been alone here since you show up

no I mean Lexus did write something but

I was 11 for like 20 minutes so it's

tasty right

don't be yeah yeah I suggest I should

almost it can't really be a rude but do

you never never be afraid of writing

anything like don't feel like you're

writing too much

um

because I am because I am streaming

to

to play games and games to be creative

but also I mean if it's what just for me

playing games and making models

and nothing with community and I would

just do it

like not streaming

so I am streaming to let people like

chat to me directly yeah that's the

whole point that's not the same thing

I guess it's I guess this kind of

pressed tight no not really it's gonna

drink

whether when the ad break comes on I

will my Talon is jumping and break it

down

well at any moment okay

well in that case

when I listened back to my to my votes

myself

that I mean it's more like I've already

seen the whole the whole stream I was

staying

I don't need to see it again

um

the picture is fine we are all fine fine

but I've noticed that my pronunciation

has been terrible at times

mostly yeah the starting is when I was

so

Let's Wiggle upon looking at wiggle

wiggle if it only had more

more

slots second makeup wiggling pumpkin

[Music]

did you know that if you um redeem the

highlight message routine

and your message will appear in purple

on screen

okay I can confirm that too yeah that's

perfect

here comes the boy

yes on the twitch chat

it's tough It's it's silencing purple

but on the on-screen chat your message

appears in your own color

which is probably for you

I said that would be a nice fun feature

to have

Communists away

yeah

yeah

it is fun

if you want your message here be more

special

for only 100 points I think

I don't remember

[Music]

yeah because I ate one of the built-in

which redeems

50 points oh

yeah it says they're 50 points

hmm maybe it's one of the okay so some

okay yeah because some some of the

redeems you can't put low in 80 separate

doses 100 so they are I think everything

is uh even 50 points these are the first

that's one point

and then it's 150 and so on

any more games

I do know fun fun

one point is a white rabbit

with pink eyes

a very large bow on on her head which I

really want myself

I don't think you meant it that way but

I'm

but I took it as my enemy

159

oh

there we go

I have a nice depressed cylinder and her

Persona is

[Music]

to Mario

someone left me a message

or it could be on no yeah

someone needed me a message

but I have to check that

after I've been streaming

perfect

[Music]

um

they have we have we have provided so

many gifts already

oh you have to take the first time

I see him now it's thank you so much

for doing the gifting it's

I know it definitely but

that stuff is very slow it happened

[Music]

right it's so it's so nice so nice of

you

noxes have been writing here too and it

is

yes that's

I do like it when active users do you

get these oops I guess I mean

from uh from uh

giving subscribe subscription to

inactive users who might come here

kind of makes it it might show up

because it got a subscription there

I think giving them City people who

actually are

still here it's much better

[Music]

they should be rewarded something here

I I just wish twitch kids prioritize

these things like that I like like let

me write a list of users

if they if the gift sub is going to be

given to the community to pick the first

English that is not subscribed yet

would be on at least

please

imagine this subscription anymore

yeah yeah exactly and

who wrote just before you all right

vaccines

it has been a follower since

10 minutes ago

like me eight days ago I guess now seven

days ago yeah so

yeah at least by the way happy for

everyone being here

happy for everyone following

yeah I did think it's better to select

people than me

that's person personally it's you

I mean

[Music]

because there have been

moments where I have been giving a

subscription to a stream I haven't even

watched

and that's in between

[Music]

I guess they ran out stuff to keep

subscriptions too

[Music]

[Music]

I don't know where I should put this

maybe I just put it all the way over

here

where was that

158

1.8

[Music]

and

960.

[Music]

I mean it's a bit

awkward to like getting a notification

yeah I've been giving a gift shop to

this channel

I didn't even know this channel X

instead

[Music]

forever thank you I guess random

stranger

[Music]

but yes I guess I don't yeah we got we

got a few people five watches at the

moment okay I don't know if you should

say it every time or not

we have the characters of 25 comes up

until the neck

and

[Music]

see you till the next email slot and

I've been kind of hovering between like

that 10 20 subscriptions because people

are gifting Subs but then Subs ends like

it was 21 a few days ago

then it dropped down

D20 can I recently

and now it's back up 21

he got gifted the server to

um

I can't say Jesus asked me well I guess

they are promoting continents now

[Music]

yeah I like to I mean yeah if I oh

which means I have a subscription I have

had I don't think I have any

subscription to any stream I'm not

sure which ones I'm subscribed to

thanks for the kids

roxies welcome back

I think you're being

lucky here which is perfectly fine and

irrespective

now YouTube Chinese modes

[Music]

free one I don't remember which did five

of themselves are three four four

followers these

but

so let's see

of us of all emails

five of those are two are for if you

just follow you can use them then they

should be six

still and three animated that you get by

subscribing because I should have

unlocked one slot at 15. uh because you

start at five

and then you got to six at 15

subscribers subscribers and that's why

it says 25 at the moment because that's

when I get my seventh

emote slot

wait I should only have two animated

yeah I wanna have two anime yes

six still two animated okay see I

unlocked one still and one animated and

you start with one animated and five

still anyway

and then there are three Beats

one thousand five thousand and ten

thousand bits

which is about

you you can't give cheers to your own

child well in that case I can't change

I ain't made it happening someday yeah

it might it might

I

was not a big thing

I just switched to interesting such

thing here about it but the orange

um

make my own eyes I was because it wasn't

even

I wouldn't mind having some more buggies

I take to give some money and buy me

some burgers

I won't see the money at least until

City planet

and the

it's like the 12th they do recalculating

and then on the 15th is estimated that

the money will arrive

foreign

how much you should be given and then

they send it out after that and then

through all the processing you should

expect it to arrive somewhere before the

15th or so

there you go

yeah I need to fix their remaining stuff

here we've got these textures so I look

[ __ ]

yeah I could probably just separate

these and rush them into

the shoes

and then I switched back to the boat

okay

what burger place is your favorite pun I

don't know if I have a famous birthday

please but it was a small

what do you even call that

Burger

King

stand

and work your joint

yeah yeah basically outdoor service well

it's a very small building where you

have the kitchen we should basically

only the kitchen and then you stand

outside and order your burger

joints is like a smaller entity yeah

thank you

oh nice yeah and they make

pretty good burgers well cooked for in

my taste at least

let's take care of these parts I think

now

yeah remove this

I don't know

seems like they are not perfect Airline

here

there we go

and then and then

yeah

I'll make you Taco see if you like

something I would be nice

like like

I think I said that and some streams ago

that it would be nice to like have a

meet up and then we can do some like

food or something

I don't need to move these parts

and uh yeah

I will just do stuff like I think I left

last week we're talking about pizza

pizza

a lot of pizza

and

there should be this one this one

and this person looking one

and yeah basically making your own pizza

and the question I had at that point was

if you were to make your own pizza with

a topping you normally wouldn't be able

to get from

uh on a pizzeria what what toppings

would you pick

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

all right where's

no I lost it

[Music]

this one

I'm gonna

[Music]

okay leaving it

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I'd pick kebab

[Music]

ham or bacon

oh I see it continues

right I could chop

top on after if there is any airfryer

event but because ovens take too long

time yeah yeah that would be the first

selection of tapping yeah so yeah Kebab

is common

foreign

but yes um then

I am or bacon and

air fried fries

and that could be

that sounds interesting

I'd say that I'm out for trying another

food stuff

I'm not very picky here when it comes to

food

[Music]

[Music]

I I had to eat your pizza

[Music]

I still don't remember what I said last

week what I would make for myself

[Music]

I like to eat food

strange isn't it

I actually find it kinda strange

people who are

like really really picky about food I

mean

I get that people have preferences but

if if you just look at the basic yeah

evolutionary point of view be really

really picky about food to the point

that I'm speaking of really picky people

who barely eat anything

because I've I've known at least one

such person

and it's not the case of being like

uh that they haven't eaten disorder

because there's also bad

but I guess that's kind of

Joseph kind of but I guess that's that's

part of evolution limitation and stuff

because what I would have I guess I

guess I can ask myself that

I guess

um

I guess those people are really really

picky about what they eat

to the point that the parents eat any

any kind of food

and

which is not the same as anorexia

and because in the case of the person I

knew they that person

was not like

yeah

they they definitely eat enough

so yeah

but yeah I would expect that to to

disappear to Evolution because such

people before

black in the hunter Gathering societies

and like I guess

before that I never would have been

removed from the pool off

because I'm gonna be they wouldn't

survive but I guess I guess Eating

Disorders are kind of

no there's a kind of a mutation because

there are still mutations of humans that

wouldn't survive back in the day that

are surviving today

plus that Eating Disorders might have

evolved due to the convenience of food

we have nowadays that people people can

have eaten disorders and still survive

foreign

another heavy topic about

against people

with

disabilities

which I I'm I'm one of them

I think

I have I have I have a diagnosis

at least one thing

um so

[Music]

it was just doing my death here

because Evolution builds is built um

whatever it is

[Music]

anything else going on

for one thing I know I got

runs I don't know what that means

[Music]

but I do have

uh autism so I don't think that's a huge

secret considering how

oh now it tells me that there will be an

upcoming outbreak I'm not sure why it's

so bad at doing that

I was just thinking about oh and that's

now it's just enough coming out but it's

been really good but

inflammation in the bowel system oh

that can't be cured oh

um

well I wish you the best I'm a little

bit about this one I shouldn't have

brought it

oh you

I hope it doesn't cost too much issues

it's fine there

I'm

yeah it's fine for right

I was nervous for this kind of topics

managed to bring stuff up anyway

um

hope you're doing give it

now

yeah like like I guess I don't mention

my

autism because of it's not an irrelevant

but I guess some some something can be

seen as quite autistic for Stuff idea

but um

but I it's also that some you know I I

have a low amount of it it still affects

my

social interactions

I am not like severely autistic

and that's kind of why I don't probably

don't mention it normally because

people are probably think of severe

autism

wish

doesn't apply

autism is like a lot of things it's um

it's um on a scale

it's not like you have autism or not

autism

and well that's kind of how the

Diagnostics work either have autism or

not

but every single person is somewhere on

the scale

and it's only when you cross that line

through a test

and that you get uh what is it meaning

that people who are not tested can still

be have crossed the line and then there

are people who are just very close to

the line

and are therefore similarly in autism to

people who have the diagnosis but don't

get the diagnosis so

I mean not deeply speaking I mean

I'm not here to say said I've hurt me

but uh I'm here to show solidarity that

I am understanding and respecting what

you may have to right

yeah yeah yeah

that makes sense

hear me

we're here for each other

and yeah don't don't feel like

and I guess that's

a bit pity what would you be doing all

right right

I hope so I hope so but anyway

um we got the kitten first time me right

now today hello I'm here but for a short

time today what a year after today

kitten do you want to share or is it

company secrets

I own a chef it's company maybe that's a

security thing

organization secrets

long day at work today

yeah that's the name of it definitely

the fun one

and that that would be the 50 000 bits

okay I will tell you I mean only if you

want to and only if you can

I'm not forcing you

if you're uncomfortable here it's fine

it's fine

blush

foreign

wait a minute I'm missing one

I wish I also wish the notification for

when ads are showing and not showing

what a difference because they've shots

in Green for the color of ads obviously

because it's a used company

but anyway

oh yeah the swing to time is like oh

we're like 10 minutes ago

and yesterday I worked at very long

shifts I got I offer late at 10 at night

also known as 22. and my instance

as easy to count for me and what's that

achieve it was fine that yeah in this

case is sequence so so 5 to 22 that is

15 plus two so 17 hours

let me run

17 hours that's a long time working so

now I'm back at work today I started

fighting again I won't get up until sick

which is 18.

I guess when it is close you can see

well in this case five to five is twenty

of hours

but I can give you that that's uh that's

easier and then plus one

hey so that would be what's 13 hours

I do hope you get compensated for your

amount of work

what a great job ahead it pays great but

I'm so excited to live an hour away from

you

as long as like you are comfortable with

it work and you like even if it has

boring moments that you still enjoy when

it isn't boring I guess and that you

actually do get well paint that's like

like in my situation I

really struggle with work and so so if I

I wouldn't from my perspective with Jeff

it's boring if I get if I get well paid

I'm going to be bored I take it

we switched in jobs and today an apple

oh and I I take the amazing I achieved

guessing

because you've guessed

oh that must have been an amazing year

but I don't ever have that Apple that

amazing

or was that a joke

I can't tell

I don't work for a company you can say I

work for the people is what you can say

you you can say it's what you can admit

I know I was just being funny

[Music]

all right scenes

I was happy even if he just post some

yeah that's basically not showing

showing me love I'm getting one plushie

I need a blushing version

hey

but yeah it's

nice that even if he has put a few

inwards

knowing that you're here

it's nice to know

like the moment

where should I there's a twitch had a

bug which I've only experienced once but

yeah I had it on multiple streams but

not every stream most of streams but are

very few it was I could not write in the

chat well I could write I could send a

message but twitch dropped every message

I sent the client wasn't aware of that

because sometimes the clan gives error

and I couldn't send message to something

but this time it's it's just sent it and

switches dropped it it didn't show up on

the on-screen chats and if I reloaded

the chat I could see all the previous

messages other people have written but

not mine

my birthday

um

redeems still worked as long as the

reading didn't require you in putting

any text

if you hey if I use the redeem that

required text that one will actually

give an error

strange enough that one given error and

but it didn't require anything I could

send the redeem and it actually didn't

work

so

while I was watching the stream I sent

an occasional redeem

kind of showing that I'm still there

watching even if I can't type anything

else oh also I got some kidneys from

work as well oh that sounds great kitten

hiding

if you want to share it with the chat

or if you want to share it with me in

private that's

whichever year comes the moment

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

could turn it upside down

let's turn it upside down

no I still can't fit it even if I turn

it up Sameer

I don't know it fits no it actually fits

slightly better if I do turn it upside

down but

[Music]

um

I'll put it in these down there instead

okay let's see what you wrote

I got accepted into a college course for

advancement in my job it was that one

course I was telling you on the bike it

takes a few months to finish

oh

that sounds amazing

I hope

I hope it's not too hey

[Music]

tune like

you know and I don't know what to see

foreign

[Music]

countdown for the uh so it shows in the

chats that is counting down for the ads

to start and then when the countdown

reaches here it disappears and then the

ads would start eventually

laughs

it's a bit weird

so

sometimes I guess

so

that's just who I am so now for these

parts

which should be

I need to meet

while I'm working

okay

[Music]

I'm glad you like it and I'm doing it

because you like it

[Music]

I'm here to entertain you

and you're here to entertain me

yeah strong blushing on that one

front one is blushing in is in shock

[Music]

strongly shook this shock is Swedish for

fat

1663

[Music]

1663

and then

foreign

[Music]

37 86

3786

yeah

let me check this position it is good it

is good

and

that's if you say shock is the shock is

the shock in Swedish too

yeah I mean I wouldn't that might be a

div okay in your access

I actually don't know her because I say

these two words I would say as shock and

hot that that's that's my accent in

Swedish

um I do know that some say

chalk or shock

the difference between anything like

Finance Finland Swedish but I don't know

maybe maybe

yeah

foreign

[Music]

is located in Finland

my life is a little lie

very heavily for a lot of our neighbors

yeah yeah I can imagine that you like

I am

[Music]

oh yeah

um

Norwegian has some man's

as she sounds that

I've shifted

in somebody else they're emerging and I

remember that because the design

Norwegian usually made a username that

is based on a church

on a pronunciation joke in Norwegian

I think it doesn't really work

um for most people

it's a very Niche joke to make the

username and stuff

thank you

but I like it

foreign

very it makes it very hard for other

people to read it I guess because

oh

it's written like Norwegian so

and no one can read the region

[Music]

but one thing I've noticed that some

people do is that

Swedish plurals are all kind of vowels

so the plural pizza pizza pizza if you

want to say it as far as I know the

proper way it would be Pizza

although I could say that's the proper

way but that's as far as I know it

Dependable should be however I've heard

that some people do pronounce it as

pixel instead and that would be the

Norwegian plural

and I could imagine I think I actually

have relatives from vermiland

actually I think about it and it might

be those relative action who actually

like that's where it comes from not

specifically in fact Norway and

influence everyone knowing

root

which is character in a region is easily

distinguished here as carrots too at

times if you say good roots

[Music]

we know most of us

[Music]

you know most of us cars in this life

for tomorrow here too it makes sense I

mean

um for glasses glass dragon and one of

these

blank is

Riddler which would be for Norwegian

brilliant it might not specifically

Indonesian it might be a common origin

but yeah

I'm no reason words are slang in Swedish

yeah I don't think anyone in Stockholm

would say good root

and people know about it

to realize

and what you're referring to but

so yeah

I'm familiar with it but yeah I don't

think anyone could actually use it I

would say here but I accidentally

movement

I'm from

that's why switch accent

that is

even being a bear I shouldn't know about

that one

no naughty naughty

but I

I can sometimes forget about them but

honestly when I realized that I was

always really bad since one year

when you wrote that previous scene oh

yes it's their auditions

yeah yeah that's why I wanted to say

that

um

no no no way it's actually the correct

way of speaking in Swedish

but at the end all I want to say it was

correct in the sense of like

dictionary

form I think

it's like I like spelling wise if you

want that's what I spent

if you want to spend Swedish plural that

would be the way you would spell it I

think however some might spell it with

them hey Roxy yeah

someone might spell it with an E anyway

I don't know maybe something

that's even more harder to read

Pizza

[Music]

and pizza

one pizza two pizzas

I'm gonna put this

hurry and machine when you go

oh yeah

okay

[Music]

I have some people from

say that I have a very

distinct I guess Stockholm accent

I don't know if that's a secret

character or more like

very very very very very stock up on my

seat

and like I guess

[Music]

I pronounce it as

the the

yeah do you

white shelled thing laid by chickens the

the way I pronounce it in Swedish is egg

egg

which might be the more stock on way of

doing it

obviously the joke is that

people in circumferences or something

like that no it's not that it's not that

much

but I do know that there's a marriage of

stitching valve so there's no this

difference between a short ER and a

short uh they have merged interesting

except before

the letter R for some reason

so I still pronounce it as

I think

[Music]

maybe it's easier if I don't try to just

if I was in with the word nice to speak

sentences

ecta

X

I would say there's a difference maybe

maybe it has shifted more maybe it is

that distinct as in other spiritualism

though

yeah that's a possibility

you got a clear Swedish which is often

very close to the true stock market you

mean yeah

that's that's basically my mentor and

then

the Jewish talk on actions

is spoken by one point bonbon

can I save this

but yeah also I have like I helped

someone learning Swedish and

pronunciation but then I I have made it

clear that I'm speaking while it's still

connects and then that's of course not

the way everyone speaks

so I so I would not be the person saying

that I know some people like making fun

of when people speak and

and there I need to switch the saying

that certain actions are just wrong and

stuff but I don't want to be that kind

of person

[Music]

that is he has to read

very Parts about the fairy Parts

but there's only one thing left right

and there's this thing which um

[Music]

but hide everything

and

which is this thing on the cooker

the uh butt coverage which doesn't cover

her butt

so I need to to because I

can't enlarge it and

somehow

somehow

[Music]

the problem is that the team is getting

a bit in the way so

[Music]

like I could enlarge

there you go

you just enlarge it but

I do want to try to make it the original

size so I just like stretch it out

on this axis mainly yeah maybe that's

just what I'm looking for

[Music]

don't skip a bit of a weird shape so I

also wanted to kind of avoid that

[Music]

give me a moment I'll get this to work

come on

moving up

and then move it back

like I could see that working but

then I wrap it around it

[Music]

maybe I just move it out like that and

my

angle this part

that could work but I still need to

figure out something with the table

though the confirm the tailors Clips

straight to me

um an idea

I'm happy Fridays

oh yes dance let's let's dance

[Music]

this subject yeah yeah

no I don't remember if this uh

I don't I don't remember I think I've

asked you before which version you

prefer

I switched between white piano and then

but it's just the

it's the uh it's because it's because

it's like the second part so like right

here yeah that would be English but then

you come to

the second part that's not English like

it the double I at the end that's not

English

with ursini urusini

a Viper yeah

I think you said that before

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

yes I am at this moment it's been the

modeling the bunny

and I'm trying to figure out how I

should

put this um middle piece

which

I should probably take a look at it

again can I just do this then

all right there we go

uh right

and then I will show this one okay don't

go it's just like this simple

bunny

important and compared to crash being

very triangled

but study uh it's European Meadow Viper

species

oh is it uh actually

an action even preaching

was you've been working hard and you

thank you I mean

I have been knocking many many hours I

mean

the European medal Viper the first thing

that came up was the Hungarian metal

Viper and then the Nubian metal Viper

um no Swedish translation

although that's the vipera or EVPs

that must not be a specific one

you referred to that was the first time

that actually I'll paint it for me when

I did oh yeah by Pierre would see me

alone but that yeah that doesn't have

like

uh it doesn't have a common name on the

opinion

that's probably why it didn't show up

for me at first

it does say a metal Viper but that's not

the name it's this but anyway I mean

yep there you go

but it doesn't live in Sweden

yeah that's yeah that's one if I search

for aims who going back

but I guess the other one would

definitely called the

English thing

order me

oh there it is

um

no it doesn't have a name

not a name in Swedish at least I guess

you could just call them

okay kids games

that's not too easy to see back to you

back good morning

yeah

sounds nice I was kind of he was

confused about oh Vixen my way they

speak to him no it was just a failed

I didn't didn't including anymore for me

everybody loves this species so much

they just call it in theirs in hungry

they call it again my dog my princess

yes no creative names there

now what is with this part but yeah this

is why I'm working right now so the only

thing I'm curious about for the moment

is

how should I do it with the thing

I am open for ideas

[Music]

what

but you don't have to comment up with

ideas that's fine too

[Music]

but I like the community to be a bit

involved in the sign of Pom-Pom that's

how I did right

that's that's what I would say

I just want the community to be more

involved in the creation of quantum it's

not like I want to put the burden on the

community to come up with ideas for me

that's it

that's not swimsuit without changing man

I forgot about I need to I can't change

this or maybe let's change this ones

with the same thing

um

all right now it's 3D there we go that's

you know

that's the

I want it

[Music]

someone wanted me right here

time to call it

Swedish meta Viper usini Marx when

you don't have to call it metal Viper or

the scene that's

I have now put it as emotional account

well I mean I mean

[Music]

I mean

each each of these versions

to have their own

so the Italian is called the ursini so

that would be uh

the grease is uh

right

[Music]

the Bosnian

um crops

remain Romanian is

it yeah

I know it sounds like a speaking Italian

pronunciation

[Music]

is

davica

unimportant yeah breed new ones and make

it a new species that you call the

uh

or something I don't know what exactly

what is Swedish in Latin

Swedish not in language but

pertaining to

pertaining to Sweden in that thing that

is

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

that's something I really like about fun

fun give her something about you because

often correct me in terms of information

yeah yeah yeah that's what I do

that's what I do

are you sitting here chilling at your

teacher ever since I don't know already

yeah

um yeah it's more like I'm teaching

myself and you you're monitoring myself

teachings

[Music]

foreign

I'm happy you enjoyed that I'm happy to

be here

entertaining in that day

[Music]

and it gives me keeps my brain active

[Music]

okay so I guess I guess no one came up

with a need for doing it I might end up

done

yeah you still got time

no pressure

I want a project

um

okay let's put a point there instead and

I

really

nice just like that that's not exactly

what I want but take one of them

yeah that's exactly what I wanted

maybe she just rotate it

I only rotate it

so like this look at that

and yes make it

mikotus snakitus

Mickey snacks I think you can snack on

it your house

already I've got that

I've ordered it wholesome 100.

that's amazing

so I will and I'm trying to fix that

let's enlarge by 25 that's step one

step two

rotate it

by 18 minutes

that means I have to rotate these

uh eating mistake so they keep in sick

so they're starting to look like

something

okay it probably needs me a bit

wider this direction

let's stay away

125 125 I know that was

25 percent

but a certain amount

um you know I've never asked about this

before but the thought has crossed my

results and have you seen the show B

stars or the movies

and I have been not seen

these Stars

B stars but I have seen zootopia

on acid

ropolis

and

then

oh the only difference is that them

saying it's that way instead

but we appreciate that I do like how

such efforts this thing has gone until

that they have recorded every line that

they mentioned the place name

recording them twice

Justice they say both names

and then secondly I haven't checked that

but they must have also reanimated the

mouse moments for those parts

and and subtropolis is much longer than

zootopia sorry

how does everything sync up in that case

is not Zoo because I'm lazy

um yeah

my parents speech and healthiness and

reach a maximum level D which to advance

the prestige level two

level one

[Music]

yeah right here would be wholesome

prestige level one already

I mean he's thinking about Call of Duty

he started prestige level zero

if I'm not wrong

I was actually afraid to the

wholesomeness of her in her stream but

thanks anyway yes I will never switch I

had

we can all be wholesome here we can hold

something together

oh a hole and some

from my phone

okay and then I need the further

adjustment

yeah I think I think is

working

got something to work here

and my message has been

this part and also

um yeah

I know it is

typical weekend I want to see

[Music]

include everyone in the defend in

nice and simple

you are amazing and perfect sorry for

being so random and silly but it's about

a thread happiness we can we can make me

happy

and my parents been here a few times

always fun always fun when you show up

even though I can't remember the

nickname but no I said it three times

maybe I can remember

that's the thing about me I'm bad at

remembering names

[Music]

character in a starring position

yeah I've been considering watching bee

Stars

I don't know if you just happen to be a

bunny or if you're interested in seeing

shows and such featuring them too I

don't mind watching yeah

like him

it doesn't have to be

like

hey

animal based movies films

shows

do you like bunnies

Bunny's my favorite

it might be a surprise

but I do like bunnies

that was it's not a surprise

[Music]

but yeah if you do have questions about

anything feel free to ask away

like him even if you want to ask because

I know some people I wanted to ask you

about my like I like me being trans a

trans woman and some people do have

questions like that but they are afraid

of asking

probably asking the wrong thing or

something but but no one has asked like

as long as you like your yes and being

lucky

not to disrespectful about it

it's fine

it's it's your problem it's going to say

anything that's wrong

and so I'm happy to answer anything and

and I rather want you

to ask a question that you might have

the wrong idea about

and so I can give you

um tell you how it's

is instead of not asking and

and still have the wrong idea about it

you know

yeah

oh he's so sweet

I wanted to explain to happen anything

good right so I was too nice because he

let me kiss tastes meat

two sweets for this warranty

I just want to eat

eat eat it up everything

these parts are as as seen here with a

bunch of the part time these are

supposed to be like sleeping inside the

body like in original

I will do that here too

and also avoids me having to try to

match them up perfectly

see

something like that maybe

have a dark Parts too kinda help me

with three and a half

then

um yes I have several friends of heart

trans and Jennifer and non-binary so

I've learned a lot in recent times

that's nice

like

yeah

having people being open about that

already

shows how

they can trust you

and there's some yeah um but I sure

appreciate yourness about it

and what yes uh and after all

individuals have well I have different

experience of the same thing especially

some something simple I can't attention

yeah yeah

um

that that is a good point as well and

I could tell

[Music]

I could tell about my experiences as

well if there's something

that

you are curious about

I'm I'm quite open about everything

regarding this

thank you

I want

to see

something like that

yeah I probably have to maybe in the mid

mid section separately

and

[Music]

um

let me think that that it's a dad part

and

I think that's fine I didn't say that

loud so I can't remember

oh

and now it's a surprise I I

if this is the message

thank you

everything is simple

system

[Music]

and I kind of in this message here

thanks

Viper started months two of the

subscription

is that correct that you have the script

card one month before

and this is your second month

okay you get you got to give up my Thief

gifted yeah okay

and then because the uh

because the message I got here although

it's written in Swedish

okay as I'm going to play it shouldn't

be ads for subscribers but if you get an

ad anyway

yeah

and you have to restart the Stream

Swedish heart

but yeah

when it says the foreign

[Music]

foreign

that you have subscribed you have you

have made you have signed a subscription

for two months

and then

as far as I know that's not an option so

I would say that the the thing is

incorrect and it says that you have now

subscribed in for like one month in one

month

so that part like I have been subscribed

for one month and

yeah but if you're creating again

yeah

but it seems it says like

sign a subscription for two months

that's

that's why this whole thing is confusing

me because

isn't it like one isn't that aren't the

option one three six and 12 months

yeah I'm always confused I'm a country

one

20

30 figure out what this one means

because at all all this this is chat

here which I did use uh

uh base code for it I have otherwise

made it myself

it has some issues though

it isn't perfect but

try to find a good amount here let's do

two and a half then

to end up

and I need to apply it to the other side

turn off there we go now

there's a side part here that it's not

insecting his body I will get to that

all right I guess the important thing is

to take that and which is total time

subscribe oh they got the Sun but pain

or suggestions yeah

to me

[Music]

to me the phrasing to me implies that

you have now signed a subscription of

two months into the future not that the

total amount of signs is two months

including previous

yeah they're ready to shoot

so they really should consider uh

refreshing that

if they add like a total total a total

amount of two months

I think that that would clear it up I

think

yeah that's that's my friend tells me

too which is a very confusing way but

yeah the thing I think it says it's not

what it said

and the last part and has now subscribed

if in one month

is that that's the the that you have

chosen the one month subscription option

and

they really need to flip those two

actually yeah you have signed for one

month now and have been subscribed and

have a subscription for a total of two

months they should they should change

those two around I think that would

clear it up

yeah hey

reported

yeah but thank you so much for

subscribing again it means a lot to me

I'm getting so close to 25 is set for

the tuna there's three more

subscriptions

a before one runs out I don't know

anyone available so

and then I get one more still emote and

one animated image

and I wonder what that image should be

hmm and yay my company mods

do you like them

a lot of people say they like them I'm

happy people they like them

even though I think they are

somewhat on the um

less every good side

of course that's because I'm looking at

like modern people's emotes

but yeah I will I will I think

I do want to redraw all of my emails

and

by the way when your friend who is

always here every time I've always been

here before Anime

oh my God

I can't remember

and he is currently

making Foods

thank you

but yeah he's usually here and then

there's the other one the the other one

hit in the freak for life

he has been quite busy at work which I'm

proud of his

diligence if that's a great time at work

um

but it does make him quite busy and not

being able to be here which I do respect

yeah

if you don't have time to be here

I'm not that important

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

all right now let's see

[Music]

um

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

oh

very sweet expression

it's not important but I'm happy if I

don't know I was watching

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I'm happy to entertain

[Music]

ment this part

[Music]

by a slight amount

no problem

I'll give it that

and great

it's a whole party

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

I have a long list of reasons

I don't need to go through the long list

now well I could if you want

foreign

page I think

so

and you didn't use like Discord command

it doesn't

which is recommend

well there it is no I actually had your

link saved from some all the time he's

never doing oh

you never joined

foreign

I would say low activity

but I do feel

like a

sorry maybe that much it's

never end

s which means that you can easier

keep up with the conversations going

comparative to server had height

it's not like I'm looking to have no

activity but

but I've I've been on other service for

people I have been acted more like there

must be some activity on set on the

server

and

there must be activity and we must

encourage activity and so on like no

no no

banana

there's no problem

[Music]

I'll make one for you but it says here

and

maybe that's what you did now

if you have if your animal of choice is

missing message princess confon about

adding your animal

and I can do it right now

it won't be in the list though

I can manually applies to you

anyway that's it

emojis does not Rose can I copy your own

no apparently not and I can't create a

mirror on there

no

come on I wasn't the one I moved

[Music]

snake will be there

that's coming

[Music]

I was slowly hey

[Music]

I will apply it to you

give snake

because the acid also says on the rose

thing when I update the add more animals

to the list of rows to pick from animals

to become it resets to the the front

option which I called no change

or that's the default name I'd actually

remember

um because

yeah

even if you're suspected no change

doesn't matter

you will keep your animal

[Music]

it's a limitation of Discord works

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I actually didn't check that

yeah yeah I gave it I gave this picture

do you want the only do you want snake

or Dragon that's your choice

to clear up some yeah okay I keep the

last one showing

how to command works I am sneaky yeah

then I remove the dragon now you're a

snake

you should only have one

I mean

I guess it's maybe someone more than one

but I didn't I don't know what the

animal animal thing is supposed to be

but maybe we'll come up with something

some at some point

[Music]

I'm happy to

happy to do it funny

[Music]

happy to be at service

[Music]

[Music]

me

[Music]

as I'm trying to work no I think that's

fine it's fine like this I guess

let's move it down slightly

[Music]

okay using gifts in chat okay in this

good General

yeah I think

I think it's fine I guess that's why

yeah

[Music]

there's not any hard rules here it's

gonna

if it's more like mean me meme stuff

there's a meme channel for that

and if it's like stuff you create this

this is the channel for

any extra stuff you create which gives

you or gives more I guess gives more

attention

or less attention I guess and so your

stuff doesn't get pushed away in the

general chat I don't know

so it's slightly organized but it's not

much

I feel fine it's annoying

if it's like

it's like relevant I guess

I I would say if I think memes memes

channel would be more suited to like

gifts in general

there's a quite a few posters so I think

that's there I think that would be

uh because there's a few videos and

stuff posted around on me

um so I think the

yeah

[Music]

but if you

if it's like related to something going

on you can't post it in general yeah

[Music]

anything yeah I think is so guys that

can't respond when it keeps yeah I think

I responds yeah yeah

I want to make sure yeah

I think I think that's that that that

could work if it's like a response to

something like part of the part of

what's going on in in the chat I think I

give

can work

[Music]

maybe like

and as long as it doesn't get too too

much like every message didn't give

maybe not to be too much but but I think

I give here there that's fine

it's really related to the online

conversation

like like you just joined you want to

share a gift that's fine that's fine

you message received it yeah

was it good that yeah so I haven't

really considered it that was kind of

going to do everything in my head

[Music]

have we already been going on for five

hours

oh my

time flies when you have fun so now I

basically got this scene to fit on

pamper now I'm happy with this

so

I'm still not sure what you should do

with the tape it's kind of getting in

the way here put armor on the tennis

when

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

yeah there's no point to be using that

I just realized this whole part is not

too far back again just that thank you

thank you

latest one

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I guess by asking maybe I haven't played

crash importance

oh yeah that was the thing I was

supposed to mention before I didn't

no that was wrong there we go

and that's in this game

and

first you have the different outfits you

can wear

all right can you set the dashboard

there you go no no it does something

but damn

you have a temporary power-ups in the

game

and these outfits are used for temporary

power-ups

both way

[Music]

so this is one of the Apple wraps

[Music]

so

[Music]

but then and then then there are

different outfits that you can choose

for both crush and cocoa to wear

is

[Music]

it well not one of them

but so I'll start with the

[Music]

not this one's sickness That's why

nothing happened

[Music]

okay I should probably connect this

thing

merge all right but I will set it there

we go

[Music]

thank you

I keep an interesting

there we go no wrong button

she see that that does not look Pleasant

for her to sit

yay yeah I don't think

it would be that

way to sit on

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

it's through the hallway

the whole week

the whole way

yeah

and uh

[Music]

sitting probably fine don't lean back

[Music]

to Sharp Edge in butter

yeah yes yeah

it's meant to like connect to she

wouldn't be wearing uh

black suit underneath

so it will it should appear as if these

parts are connected to it

[Music]

foreign

cut off this part

and leave the Heart part the remove that

part and move it here

yes that's an option I guess that's what

I could go with

I mean I could just leave it like this

too but

I made

this one moves up over

so I want to do something more here

I guess that's the

active it should set that one

but

why does it feel like this one is

of fire nuts

that's me

in position myself

Okay so

what selected it's like that we're

working on blender here it doesn't match

it it's quite warm

skin type in general Maybe

thank you

cute

[Music]

you're you're making me embarrassed

you're making Mission bless

Ed

I love it

definitely need to enter it

blush to my pumpkin

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

it is

fortified kit

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

slightly too far

I went too far

foreign

the other way

I have red cheeks I had Sunny kittens

yeah the blushing should definitely

appear

overnight blush

[Music]

and that will be all the time

when we kissing

[Music]

there we go

[Music]

should make some additional slight

adjustments

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

avoid any clipping issues and there you

go I've noticed she's fit her very

[Music]

shoes are so big

even pumped on his legs fixing them

yeah yeah

I need to cover my face

[Music]

I could also

[Music]

I do have to move these parts

on the picture

[Music]

since you go over and do that

which should be the last remaining

pieces that I'm not yet moved over

so

oh you want this no I press the wrong

option

anywhere this swing seat now

but it's not time for swimsuits

then he hit this time when is the time

in next three minutes

then he's changed yeah yeah

[Music]

I would change when it's time

Memorial after for swimsuit

yes swimsuits and watch you go well

together

foreign

costume

for crafting cooker

one of the outfits I wanted to make for

a pumpkin is the swimsuit

which would be basically

there well I guess the naked one one

from mesh and then I would draw a

swimsuit on top of it

and I've actually modeled this swimsuit

maybe maybe I'd add like the edges where

this winter ends

for a 3d effect but I could probably do

that with normal map in the enemies

[Music]

these are some different let me show you

so

so I can't stand anymore

I can see one see for some reason I do

want for some reason anymore

so

these two should be separate

[Music]

[Music]

and then I

thank you

and then I need to copy it from each

text chain

[Music]

um another

says

[Music]

nothing anyway

um let's switch everything now

[Music]

oh

[Music]

do them

[Music]

it is since it

apparently swim seeds

yeah I didn't want to go with a pink

swimsuit maybe that would be pretty much

pink it is Pink

[Music]

's bow has also changed quite

[Music]

because pumpkin would obviously

change the color of the boat to match

the outfit including when she puts on

the swimsuit

obviously

[Music]

I think all right what was with the

Licky

I mean um

[Music]

okay I didn't say that

[Music]

2017.

[Music]

30

now now I need an image for plant

vanilla swings uh well he has just a

swimsuit

[Music]

I guess could also work

[Music]

okay

me

[Music]

I think that this is the most optimal

way to please them but

[Music]

now I'm actually very connecting

assistant

[Music]

but then I need to find because it is

like everything

oh wow

scary scary 10 technical comes

Quantum likes calamari and then a long

Fox and she likes the bone detained

something is

[Music]

something else we should mention

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

down and place all of them there I'm

gonna say this texture you can get some

nails and lots of sometimes if you might

feel

yeah

no slits with the nose

oh hey

why

you do this

[Music]

thank you

say finally

[Music]

I've had the lights on

[Music]

to plenty

and then switch which screen from take

care

now there is no longer an old outfit on

any outfit old fit

I like the melody turn the face down

underneath the way and on this PC what I

thought it was a baby

but I hope it was a day like you were

looking boy

you were looking for whether you can

turn them on by choosing the 10 points

for 150 points you can choose any of

these six static Subs sub one emotes to

flip there are some other options to

over there strange

and surely you have to pay for it and

then it's unlocked for 24. it's easy I

won't mess up a thing but

I wish it was easier

at least there's an option there

so

now to see if I can

make this watch

there you go now you did it too ah let's

play

yeah no longer suspicious tea leaking

here

you're welcome

for some reason you cannot turn a flip

the or modify in any way the follower

emotes they should fix that

[Music]

but but but but

[Music]

licking the lick

but it's nothing wrong with licking a

little kiss there

let's delete everything she doesn't have

a mix

right there

doesn't know the textures the parts of

the textures I don't need

a hole in a chest

wait what's that

I guess it wasn't attached

that's how they should have made most of

them

give me some arm

now just this part that

doesn't

it doesn't

that's me

so

now to see if I can make this point

have fun is good for it

and

[Music]

he's there

even an option for that

[Music]

okay

um

[Music]

yeah yeah

hey you stream so long and on so many

days how do you have the time in the

energy

I don't know

I don't know

I stream three hours per day except for

the Arts days which are six hours

normally

but I might go on for a bit extra now so

I want to get this body thing fixed and

I'm trying to I want to transfer over

the pictures and I'll see if there's a

way to do that but I do have to catch

the bathroom earthquake so that would be

three minutes and then I would play soon

anyway so I'll just have them

now

it's a

see you in three minutes

for anyone I'm actually season this I

don't know

I don't feel like anyone here yes yes

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

I think so

[Music]

it's supposed to become a bit colder

finally I should put something

[Music]

so how is it I was thinking

[Music]

hello Foxy's you came as soon as I

knocked away

[Music]

it's nice sneaked away

[Music]

um

[Music]

thank you

okay

[Music]

because it's kind of behind me

and now I'm properly packed

instead of improperly

time is

here we go

[Music]

so

I want to read the texture for one and

apply it

oh yeah wait I know

[Music]

um

in a new material

and then I will create a

image actually

[Music]

and you

[Music]

and then the

[Music]

with this one I should actually I think

[Music]

[Music]

I think it's diffuse I'm going to

resurrect

lightning lighting I don't want

lightning I just want the color

okay let's see if the max

[Music]

oh

okay sure it's taking its time

all right it had some

[Music]

here's the timing

[Music]

anyway what's that just

isn't it done

apparently not

that was apparently the first face

many more faces are there

wait why is this one thing is it was so

quick before

United States is going to take okay now

it's speeding up a bit

I guess it kind of is that now and now

yeah

I feel like it's going to take 50

minutes to do nah kind of a bit quicker

please

[Music]

nurses maybe 20 minutes

of course the most part is that it

doesn't work but hopefully it does

[Music]

actually at this timer on screen

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

mm-hmm

when I was in front of pumpkin that's

not acceptable

[Music]

bumper needs to be above everything

[Music]

's sitting down very good

I hope this works

I'm not sure why they had to go to the

process twice then

[Music]

[Music]

I'm saying this every time I need to add

more sauce did I miss love songs

hurry up

[Music]

okay anything else going on any any

ideas for how to do the

[Music]

foreign

how I should do the thing

[Music]

I know on the on that piece I add like

the shape of the tail in that material

and then it's like a solid tail on the

back

[Music]

okay that's a scenery

I removed the tail

her tail disappears when she puts on the

outfit

[Music]

sometimes it's very quickly sometimes

it's very slow

[Music]

they're fine

number six

[Music]

seven seven eight no that's gonna raise

up a very quick day

79

[Music]

18.

[Music]

it doesn't exactly matter exactly how it

looks as long as I get something 81

and I don't think something that works

now it's slow again

eight to two and all of a sudden I'm

gonna speed up

hey

83.

and they

[Music]

and also I hate the [ __ ]

the numbers

92 93 I wasn't prepared for that see how

is that an easy flies away

[Music]

um so yeah the numbers only can I it

only has I've seen 101 steps from zero

to 100. and although it might not show

100 because it might only goes midnight

but the bar in the background has a

different number of pixels built so they

update

acid

boom

he did it

so I'm saying this

I'm saying as

and baked

and

face [ __ ]

thank you

I don't need this

yeah I can paste this into nothing but

doesn't matter

anything else a strange things like that

but that's really

it's these six I'm looking for

[Music]

oh yeah look that's the oh yeah they

look different here

but due to fun fun having the same

foreign

oh no you know what that means

let me hear let me do this

the way your body is shiny like that and

black it's gonna

be nice looking okay 100

this is showing

oh it has this dark part of my best

friend because I need to do one baking

no more baking

I'm sorry I have to bake once more

wait why is this one empty

there we go

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

so

yeah I don't see that and I should I do

that um

[Music]

got the white in there I guess

make a cake well that's not exactly what

was paid but yes bake a cake

670

that was about 670

[Music]

and then

is this part

140

.

150 I mean 450 plus the main point of

5740.

700.

that might be the mean

[Music]

I think I move both over slightly

30.

[Music]

so anyway

[Music]

that means that I can

duplicate break apart

because now

[Music]

as I think

yeah

[Music]

[Music]

I find it interesting that that part did

not I actually just show up here but

find out

thank you

far enough then

[Music]

yeah maybe I can speed up the process by

removing a lot of this stuff that I

actually don't need

now

that means that I do

I have to bake it once more

exactly the percentage Yeah I don't care

about that

and this time it should hopefully go

quicker because it's like

d568 10 12 14 15 17 19 21 23 24 26 28 39

yeah definitely

tested do it once more

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

that's more like it

when it is so stretched out there

this looks good at least that's nice

instant

fine I'm saying this as

baked phase shift to

because that's how creative I am

yeah it's not about being creative it's

not about being clear

foreign

let's switch back to

[Music]

that

of course now the link is blue because

it's using a different part of texture

more

they like that

so now I just need to

foreign

foreign

[Music]

different position

me

that's me

there's a wobbly and

where does this one glow

the rest doesn't

match this again

avoid this

their own

[Music]

okay looking at the arms the the way the

arms are made

the arms are mirrored at least that's

good

that's good at least

so good good

and I don't have to worry about that but

I should make the whole outfit

[Music]

yes

about

reminder of on your phone that just pops

up around so I was going

oh yeah they're they're armhounds

put the breasts

a singular

long across the chest

people don't know how to make clothes

look normal

I've seen too many times he

when people make

three the bottle of a woman

usually a woman with breasts and the two

breasts are individually modeled even

though the characters clothes are

but that that means that the clothes are

like

thick sticks to the breasts and

and that's that's that's not how it

works

it's awesome to have someone fantastic

like he's spreading such spelling cute

vibes or at least more like yeah I'll

tell you that much so you

allow her body to become

well black

Let's test it out

let's do some white Parts because this

brush will remain white like the blender

when I looked at cocoa to see

I don't need to do that anymore

update there we go look now she's

wearing a suit

because if you look at that carefully

carefully you can see

the furnace of it still a bit

that's going to be changed

um

[Music]

that's going to be changed

and why not change it immediately

no not that one there we go

that's what I was doing

so first off I want to

[Music]

keep things up

[Music]

with this app

[Music]

[Music]

like that

and then

[Music]

now let's see

[Music]

what does each of these what is the base

color of the suit for on on Cocoa look

like for each of these different

like if I switch from it's not c not E1

not E2 I'm not sure what the CR one is

use e01 and easier too

it should just be what needs you should

just be

thank you

anyway

yeah of course

no

I wanted to open it this new one

[Music]

oh this one is like this color

interesting

so you shouldn't be like this that's

interesting I wonder

I don't know what effect is this

fwu

[Music]

that is the historic color

certain apparently

for M and pre this year is going to be

oh it's actually it's like the metallic

okay

that's a surprise to me

no it's actually going to have slides

lights

[Music]

the normal map is going to have this

plant

oh there isn't any

[Music]

um

so so this is not perfect that's what I

was looking for

and finally the armor

very rough

yeah because it's yeah I guess

[Music]

and I guess I'll say over each of these

are

[Music]

and

[Music]

um

and seek

which I think are only the same though

but

I'll save it again

check that lately

so back to blend in now

let's see if I update all these so not

only do I have perfect or nameless also

showing so if I update m

this is metal effect

okay

English persistence

why is it not working

foreign

let's update that and now

take care

it's slight shift in tone

normal picture mode is perfect

yes here at the moment again

because will be perfect any

that stuff is

it has seen everything wrong running it

okay one more try

there you go no it's gone

and then roughness

there we go this is what this should

look like

okay there's no

in those things

that

here

yes in the way

that's good

pretty good pretty and good

[Music]

I don't like this spot there we go no

foreign

[Music]

there we go

the tricky part is of course to

expect

I'm almost reached seven hours

man I was hoping to be done with this

one I got to start with the next one but

it's it's taking our mind

like I still need parking stuff that

should take too long

so

and I want to eat something so

it might be a good stopping point anyway

okay so

up here I guess sounds good for everyone

the bunnies have stopped oh there we go

with a silly bun bun

strange

um anyway

since I didn't jump should we go and see

whoever else is streaming and say hello

to them I love this dream enjoy this is
