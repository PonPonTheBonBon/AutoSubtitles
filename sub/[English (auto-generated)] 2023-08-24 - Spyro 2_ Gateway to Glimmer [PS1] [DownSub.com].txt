I did try to play spiraling of the
Dragon [ __ ] in that game during March
nowadays you got there's someone else in
the fish again and yeah I got you one a
single level and it took like an hour
oh
such a pain
all right so I think it's
and this one started okay
it's what is
well
where's the more
I think
that's why it doesn't work there isn't
the wrong one
but explains things
and what I'm trying to do now that is
can I
always what is this one set to
drones so what's that Andre
twice here
take your input
oh all right okay I need I need I need
one thing
to make them work properly
let me just type that no I got I got the
notification
um
the wrong time best no
that shouldn't be because I'm not sure
oh my God
I actually don't know
by the way let's try this
can I run it now
I can
there we go
now let's change it
and
which category
[Applause]
still
the first
first spray one on places one to 100
competition
ah some low quality is it showing
apparently yeah I think
the little quality sounds now
Python original PlayStation yes
the ship is why the ships wasn't being
ignited
nice rain ever gonna stop I've forgotten
what the Sun looks like that's what
spider sounds like on vacation somewhere
warm somewhere sunny
Dragon Shores yeah I haven't been there
since we kicked nasty norc's butt how
about it Sparks you up for a vacation at
the beach last one there's a Newark
nice one there is another one
[Music]
is it working Professor almost just a
few more adjustments to these orbs and
maybe this isn't such a good idea
bringing a dragon here could just make
riptoe angrier calm down Hunter and stop
fidgeting
but you saw the professor's book they
have claws like this teeth like this and
they spit fire like this
they sound much more dangerous than
riptoe that's exactly the point a dragon
is our only chance of stopping the
invoice acting
think it's working
this is my personal favorite Bakery
guys I think spider 2 is my least
favorite of the trilogy
just
[ __ ]
hey stop staring haven't you guys ever
seen a dragon before
you're a dragon you got a problem with
that pussycat
something didn't even react to that
someone forgot
voices that's a different thing yeah but
the animations are definitely better
a dragon you brought a dragon to Avalon
he's always like to her babe
[Music]
[Music]
oh yeah that's um
why why didn't they explode
the audio mixing can have been better
too
I haven't got time to explain here take
this magic guide to Avalon it'll help
you begin to understand our worlds right
now I have to follow ripto and see what
he's up to I'll meet you in summer
forest okay hey wait a minute
but how do we get ourselves into these
messes pal I can't make maybe maybe we
should check but rip toe is up to ins
and then she'll just wait to answer for
us
okay let's dance
some low quality gem up picking sounds
there's my flame button
I do like that can use the rice stick to
move the camera but I can't move it up
and down
anyway
I don't have time for that it's going to
take way too long
hey
not like I want to be see it
and it feels so empty not having the
game is a bit louder than me
put in my ears when I hit one of these
headphones there we go a bit a bit
calmer and volume
there's some
how the game is running fine according
to the car yeah I call it the numbers
you're only perfectly fine I like that
other spider thing
points
points
no it feels a bit
I press
this button yes but yeah I can get up
now actually this are coming to cities
now there we go I didn't
keep missing some stuff here
uh if you would have to wait a couple of
days to get this second pack
a couple of days
and it exploded
let's make a new one oops you can use in
this one because I don't I'm gonna go
for 100 of this because I don't mind
watching a place and everything yeah
sure
100
that's kind of what I did I mean yeah
I'm kind of
running out of spy against the plane
and she's asked me to help you out
whenever you find me I'll remember your
progress like this
you have a silly voice silly
that zap means that if you get into
trouble I'll return you to this place
see you around
okay
certainly I'm in trouble return me
get into trouble you mean dying is that
what you're trying to say
a very very nice way of saying if you
die
[Music]
if you succumb to death or whatever it's
called
inconvenience
yay 100 oh gee Aspire two
yeah I hope some more people are yeah
yeah we got
we've got two people doing the
prediction now
someone with a meatly 10 points and
someone else with a thousand points
I can't see each individual there
prediction spell
uh but what I can see
is
the total amount of points on each and
you didn't tell the number of people on
each
a few germs
yes let me know it
I would cross the bridge
thank you Mr Dragon Spyro was it you can
now use the bridge whenever you want
free of charge I hope we meet again when
you have even more gems

that's
true
points
Spyro thanks for helping us fight off
the lizard what do you want to come
strange eyes that shrinks
yeah he's not a magic but it's just a
regular Potter

can you burn these
are they shrinking
and then roll up again
that's a nice Brown animations
yeah sadly I don't have the
burnable NPC mode installed here

but that's fine
Wizards have beaten my entire
how do you eat gems
Joy

[Music]
oh I didn't get up
on the first try even
know any comments that's when you read
of me oh we got two people working on a
no no three people turtle
another person dropping two and a half
stars and I can also see what what which
uh what the person who dropped the
highest amount one option is so
therefore I can tell it was not who but
what each individual question has
predicted on each option if it at most
two people
I believe oh it's water bunny
believes

getting excited now

people do
I guess I'll um
let you know how that went when
when

[Music]

then you are standing
anyway time to
nah let's see if we can see I want to
make it complicated
thank you
oops
thank you
that was a bit too high
and also everyone has a weird shh
drinking guys
I mean
spiders squishy eyes pink spice bling
spire
ly not blinking is it because he's
holding it
maybe it can't do two animations at the
same time maybe they are blink
animations tight since idle animation
you get right to the Box no I turn
around
now it might blink yeah there we go
here's some squishy ice
yeah it's definitely tight easy final
animation
but this character has shrinky eyes
pink I guess spider is the one oh I
missed some
telling me
okay
this is the an ultimate I missed another
one
okay let's see
okay yes
it's getting way too right
shooting your eyes
well I I
didn't expect it to make that quickly
writing all right Applause thank you
right in the neck
when I was supposed to get up there
yeah let's do this again I can do this
whoa I thought that was going to fall
down
okay
I can't even Aim High Enough
there we go
it's high enough definitely
you saved my crop of gems
I yeah I said can't get the chance nah
you're not concern everything
two orbs and I was going to take orbs
for the rest of the game
let's get out of here
and this is the only level in the spider
Trilogy Where exit level is not an
option
anyway
I mean aside from home once but I mean
no auntie and I'm walking here
I need to get back then when I get to
the next one
I've seen time
[Music]
he was quick at doing that
chance to introduce ourselves before
uh hi I'm Spyro what are you some kind
of goat I'm a fan you dork oh sorry did
you meet the gym Cutters in glimmer yeah
they gave me a souvenir too they called
it a Talisman they gave you a Talisman
what is it special I just stuck it in
the guidebook you gave me when do you
stick it in a kindness
to defeat riptoe
Hunter Hunter
yes got a little lost
is going to help us collect
the talent I am yes
Spyro look there's no way you can get to
Dragon Shores right now
and convince the inhabitants to give you
their talisman you can keep them in your
guidebook
hey I could do that why doesn't the
dragon just torch riptoe
water you can't even keep track of your
running shoes
you with 14 talents
say hey
they're important too but I'll tell you
about them later okay no problem I'll
collect a few talents
and be in Dragon Shores by lunchtime
kid by hunting
now and
we miss you
oh nice life
so for more knives
they mostly a skin after Dragon I won't
let him leave until he does what they
tell him to do despite doing them yep
supervisors
for some reason he hasn't learned to
swim but there's nothing
that he is able to do so
[Music]
he came by advanced games I'm trying to
I'm trying to press the jump button to
do the illegal hover in here
we're really ridiculous because while
you're flying the jumper doesn't do
anything they couldn't and they thought
or you can speak to him more
the petticoat
s
they are portals your voices around
fortunately ripto has taken over the
and we need your help start by
retrieving the talismans from each of
the world you go to
Instagram
to everyone's
terminal okay
I was meant to say fox before but I said
guilt
but now they are drugs
instead of sheep
I think spider one spider is kind of
forced into the whole Adventure
because only all the dragons are frozen
in his word
oh Hunter is here
[Music]
you don't care about you hungry
you're just going to give a tutorial
about how to fly
[Music]
so idle space is not the level you
should do first because you need
swimming to do that
you can't access
that means you have to
I'm not sure I didn't put the 25 there
so it's better to do a different name at
first so you can get enough cam so you
can speak to Money Packs and things
grooming ability
[Music]
but I don't think there's enough gems
here to get 500.
anyway in Space 3 he's willingly going
to the other worlds
you you look like you're pretty agile
yeah spray looks very agile then look at
him
okay
and but inspire two he's gonna kidnapped
intentionally kidnapped and forced to do
their work whatever
yeah that's why I do Colossus first yeah
exactly
to hover I know I know Hunter I'm not
that stupid people
I mean I miss a bit stupid
[Music]
very good
very good good
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
they made these platforms to have a
slight bit of water on them for some
reason why am I so bad
why am I supposed to hovering all of a
sudden
[Music]
my ability to have very
there we go that's what I wanted
[Music]
this was tricky turkey hunter
you're a tricky one
[Music]
okay you're a pretty good athlete if I
hadn't lost my running shoot is it an
athlete not an athlete I don't know it's
a hunter
three orbs
yes I am a pretty cute actually
what am I say so myself Sparks the
dragonfly following you around is your
Sparks there's a dragonfly follow me
around
twitch
every time I hand it
this is Sparks the dragonfly around
anyway yeah you should do Colossus first
of course where yeah let's just wear
some sport Square to this level it's not
like a good idea
very dressed like one then wait what
what was he reference to you again
I've never seen a dragon before but I'm
gonna tell you how to Glide and Harvey
like a dragon
and he did read the book and they also
got shrinky eyes
and
p.m yeah there was a bit counting down
at this
um
he didn't read about uh
dragons in professor's book what is the
name of the professor
why does the oh yeah they put they put
the house in the middle that doesn't
show how do you see the house how do you
get
oh that's how you bring it up wait why
isn't there a shortcut to the guy book
[Music]
by concentrating I should be able to
open this door for you
the doors open leave me alone I'm trying
to meditate
I'm a saint
pay attention to me okay stop paying
attention to me leave me alone
relax
oh I got squished
I never asked for your attention
I need I need some help
there you go
nothing else no that doesn't affected me
something else
money is a key when you hit wait
he's also bragging and then how am I
supposed to achieve enlightenment if you
keep pestering me
but he was showing up what you could do
he's like those Yaks are too big to be
charged
yeah I kind of realize that
I got squished by one less I try to
charge it
anyway to being an athlete I think there
is a bit of a stream today for me oh
oh yeah yeah no no no no no no
if you do be like
wait their voice was completely
different
invoices are not consistent in this game
sorry
foreign
Ty controls
games like the games are well made but
when it comes to it means like cute
voice acting
they must have been great
hey look what I can do
what I can do
the accent's completely different from
everyone else
how can you be sure I really exist
well I don't know
you aren't affected by fire
now
why are you
yeah so when you write a message and
then you see it appear on the screen
that can that you can use to determine
this thing really
and then
okay
I probably didn't have a large black
[ __ ] for the boys in yeah probably not
it's um I got you got them
I remember him again another voice
probably the same person just not
consistently moist
and you should listen to the questions
more
but I
will take so it's just a time to keep
listening to your voice and stuff
although in this voice he he text will
say one thing but he does say another
thing
Tyrion I think you should kill that Yeti
he's pretty tough though in fact I'm not
so sure you're up to it
I'll show you how much
spelled
and that was that I thought the yeti was
tougher than that
nah
um I don't know thank you
if I'm going to defeat that first boss
today
so many gems zombies they're double
and I also like the
laying above
and
but yeah let's let's play some
Spyro welcome thank you thank you yes
please
two minutes
let's do this
I'll do this
all right
it's going straight in front of me
who is this this is easy
I messed up
you guys are not TVC I messed up
well
I didn't want to send that connection
again something I think
[Applause]
no
[Music]
this is this is Sister flame all over
again
[Applause]
um so I can't wait hang on
the timer stop talking
there you go that's what I wanted
it where is it there it is
there's nothing even trying
defend it
Okay so
now
so they had it
I was I went over it then definitely
much easier to pick up the clock
[Music]
foreign
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
you hit the corner
the seconds left
well a half a second left and I did it
well done
well done have this
pancake another one pancakes again null
isn't that anything just eat it and spit
it out at the last minute
and new
is there any rule in hockey that says
that you can't put your you put the
Block in your mouth
I'm not I'm oh
I'm certainly not already rude that says
that I can't put it in my mouth
[Music]
it's so hard to move around
I also don't think there's any rules
stating that you can't claim
[Music]
opponents
[Music]
all right
pass it to me that I wasn't there
nice you
passed it on to the opponent who scored
a gun
yeah I mean
you can't see the opponent's goalkeeper
passes into the player yeah this is a
bad design
okay first of the uh the opponent is
definitely
much better here much like scores every
time
in the United scores sometimes
okay I guess we missed this time
but
[Music]
yeah I'm getting just cheating
[Applause]
thank you
what a game isn't over
[Applause]
hey interference [ __ ]
sorry
it's also that spider Crossing Village
size
finally
[Music]
therefore hardening nice but yeah
definitely
foreign
[Applause]
two girls
[Music]
oh
[Music]
yeah there's a bit of delay inside I've
really closed out and there's a dish and
it's the 20 seconds yeah there's some
things that's probably because I was
playing Iron fish
causing a lot of delays
because this game was lagging so much
because jingling and this dream thing
just adds up and I can't really do much
about that
[Applause]
so
since there's now not like refresh
button
I can name one Chris hey what was that
Magic
business
when this was stupid too tough for you
eh yeah only 30 minutes left can scale
this team so probably have to wear it
since everything yeah
I can see this that's like 20 seconds
between second delay
foreign
[Music]
it's hard to pick up the park your own
goalkeeper is playing on the opposite
team and yeah
[Music]
hey
and your goalkeeper apparently
[Applause]
yeah
so yeah definitely
I actually found it once whoa
whoa
[Music]
here's something good for us
what is everyone
got a Mexican background
thank you
[ __ ] [ __ ] is going crazy
I wish I could slow down ah what's next
to the park
there we go
now
let's move it too quickly
[Applause]
now in the edge right outside
there we go
ah miss me no
he interference
try to catch it as it was moving
oh come on yay
okay you can you can kind of slow down
you can't stop
I am moving over [ __ ]
[Music]
all right
you guys can't pass
so my goalkeeper passed it on to the
other goalkeeper who keeps it keep
playing over my guilty if it gives it
straight to the other thing it's not
really
bad one-on-one
like obviously
my goalkeeper is the same species as
those not trying to be
judged someone based on their species
but
I mean
add on top of that I think my goalkeeper
is it's helping the other two which are
of the same species that's
questions
and I'm like coordinate to this whole
world
all right let me just I'm just saying
they're definitely not playing
fire here
[Music]
I won the oh wait wait
[Applause]
huh
that's all concentration looking at the
moment
here we go
well done how
I once went to a fight and a hockey game
broke out wow
so sounds like
it's one doesn't sound like they're
hockey I've been watching but
see
oh you're welcome definitely needs that
can get yep
definitely
under the arm I don't I don't get the
color the work thing the reference is
something
that's a spring icon let's change that
to be like an up Arrow icon and she was
spring icon
I don't know I can't make sense and
change it still an apparel because the
spring icon kind of implies to get some
kind of spring
power up
when you don't
[Music]
but the upper is like when you go up
also you could argue that the up Arrow
gives you some kind of up a higher jump
ability it's like it's nice it's perfect
I don't know what words
oh thank goodness you scared that evil
spirit away but now you're welcome
processor
there's nothing else to see just Pawn
the door okay
how important they are how they are
plundering
[Music]
let's speak to him again
if you want to get rid of that evil
spirit for good
I don't ever claim these
keep going spiral there are still some
statues left to Flame yes then it
changes
United you actually record to Flame too
before you change this dialogue
which is an interesting change okay yeah
it's the stuff
I should hopefully finish this level 100
cents
no the chips are falling off
TV games playing on the platform
hey good thing you're scared that evil
spirit away I didn't about that
Professor yesterday it's
yeah I couldn't send it
what is a professional
thank you
not seeing there are more here
then there should be one outside here
snowing nothing here
now this is the status
it's the other there's the other place
it's still here and then
you guys want me on this
four more how many can I meet
at 10. until then
to us one here
three more
[Music]
[Music]
what I don't need to take this past
anyway but I wanted to make sure it was
no hiding stats okay because I don't
remember the exact location of everyone
of every single study
I think this one here
I know where one more is but why are
they
wow wow that was a two spring
weight is bringing
oh yeah I know I remember we lost two
more because there's this one I was
thinking of but yeah and then there's
one down there
at least they lost too many gems
this team
there we go 400 out of 400.
this should be one oh you got seven
there is the last one
well done Spyro you've scared the evil
spirit away why don't you no are you
still here Professor or what are we
talking about
yeah that's all that works
any music
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
there's a silly trumpet you don't know
if she needs a trumpet
damn
[Music]
let's do this
sounded more like a bulge wait what
what were you talking about now
[Music]
hello hello there Spyro
underwater
I could teach you for and a small fee
a connection I should actually I haven't
tested this game I don't know how we're
watching this game we can swim
underwater wait okay when you jump in
the water you can use the d-pad to move
around the surface for the sensation
button
the direction button is Only One
Direction but let's see
yeah they're kind of not following the
scripts properly let's go to our little
Springs
bulge by spitballs why are you talking
about qualities all of a sudden what is
this
well it's bulging
oh it's alive
oh
yeah so sometimes that I didn't want to
speak here and sometimes dimensions are
blowing too much into each other
and creating more of an awkward pacing
everything if that makes sense so now
that I paid for these I can swim on the
water immediately
instead of having to go back here and
swim underwater
then I can immediately go here
another secret size what is correctly
saying
I've been locked in here with all our
tools and the giant Idol heads won't let
the workers in unless we can solve the
three puzzles they've given us you're
not locked in here
and I mean I came in here I threw the
door here but you can just swim out I
guess
if you want to get wet this one can be
sold in only four moves a lot of people
struggle with this one
the karma is apparently locked when
you're here that's not the case you
really liked it
four moves
one
two
three
four okay that's actually to turn
everything off
that they're not supposed to turn
everything off
okay the actual four moves you're
supposed to do is one
I missed it to
friends
three and four that's our specialty
you do it now meet me at the pond for
the next challenge how am I supposed to
meet you at the pond if you're locked in
here with all the tombs
okay
wow are you just gonna say something wow
I was fired from there
yeah yeah let's get it moving
I know he's he's like clone
anyway
apparently even though
he said that he is locked in here he is
going to appear here now
this Idol says he's hungry and won't be
satisfied until he swallowed 10 fish
okay
and this is the item is very picky
that was a charge button not the playing
button
[Music]
oh yellow ones okay
yellow one
like that
it didn't even reply into your mouth
there's a red one
no he did not like the red one
there's a yellow
here's a blue one
do you like new ones
okay blue ones are fine
middle blue isn't listed there's really
a red fishiest copies which does the red
one
good thing he didn't hit
a moment now
that was a red one
and that was the other one
that was the red one
all right
now there was a red one
two six four three steps back
really I can't believe it looks down
but there you come
because they're red
Here Comes something
that's too early
it comes the red
another red
another Reds
oh heck of the yellow
all right
now the air comes
red or blue
a lot of blue all right concept there
no
[Music]
that was a yeah though
okay cause I'm dead
there we go
oh
English
[Applause]
bulge and then water comes with some of
the balls
yes I did say bolt because someone else
said bolts and I don't know what's point
with policy
but something is bulging and I don't
know what
oh yeah
baldy I don't even know what that word
is
continuing like the sound of Polish them
wait I'm not from here how do you know
my name Everyone Knows by his name
that's our Amazing Spider-Man
wow
what what's a boogie
I don't English

[Applause]
casual
lock picking with a hammer and name

showing
just almost
[Music]
something
can I do the game without dying I have
enough time
this is another restaurant all of a
sudden
although I mean
though
don't see about that
obviously I will try to not die
obviously obviously that hasn't changed
[Music]
oh we got some
it's
it's right
um
it's kind of like a trumpet but it
doesn't have valve oh he's talking about
the little Melody please
to aim the camera left or right press

one this is an octagons replace the
octagonal one
there we go what's my price
good job Spyro you're pretty smart for a
dragon yeah thank you for your location
race isn't there anyway moving on
[Music]
silence
um yeah that little celebrated jingle
for 100 completing a level
you mean completing 1100 right I would
try to make a joke there and I realize
completely 11 Easter uh
I think 100 completing a level is the
way I would
make it your face because it says it is
really nice I will check this game that
says 100 level complete or something
I'm selling level complete and I find
everything so weird
I don't know I don't know what I'm
talking about I should be quiet
spiral you're pretty tough if you ever
want a permanent job yeah thank you for
not saying for a dragon like
the first before I said I want to make
the former complaint it because that's
the pain with you
um
[Music]
you're pretty smart for Android and yeah
quantity
DND
the uh
one thing in Dragon's dungeons now but
I'm not sure if that's DND but Dragons
Dogma
um
and dragons are on average an 18
intelligence compassion average human
understand of course
and I assume considering if it is dragon
and then
it's a scale from 1 to 20 that could die
so
when these marks meaning that it's 18
out of 20.
which is pretty high
Dungeons and Dragons
no that was TNT
I don't think I don't even remember
here we got some
food
my idea
hula dancing
with like a nice cross skirt and
for some reason this one in common name
even though it looks exactly the same
stress
oh my what pinky stuff is going on here
now that the supercharged power up is
active you can charge through the
pedestals and send the dancing hula
girls over here to help me
okay sure
I mean you're tied up
there's this guy here with a
parcel
apparently
and also
I can't ignore
that's the
whatever you call them or lifting in
front of your chest
you're also obviously one side and so if
you look behind this since we were
detains
isn't it the lightning icon for this in
Dragonite in here it's like what kind of
Icon is this
what what is this supposed I thought I
could get a good view but I can't move
the camera up and down
it's like a
I was saying wheel it could be a fan
it is weird this design I would
I don't know how I was a designer she's
super sharp but
anyways ears to fly
yeah yeah yeah look at this one yes and
that is a good point I wanted to wear
my custom animations for my Pom-Pom Bond
mod first fire
and the one idea is to have a user ears
to play
because he still needs to fly I kind of
strain I currently you sing yeah magical
blood things
yeah I'm going to get it soon there we
go
look at that the hula girls rain dads
blew up that Idol like a Roman Candle
now I can pursue that dancing
up there
are you okay
20 isn't the maximum for any rgbs Okay
so
[Music]
did you mean that there is no maximum
attribute or did you just say that's 20
that all all attributes have different
values in 20 is not one of them
I think it is
it was an interesting crazy
and grass skirt and coconut bro exactly
that's what I'm thinking that one punch
them is that a good idea
Crash Bandicoot 4 because you can pick
different outfits or coco in that I
thought
and and one
punch it also of course have the same
thing but different aspects that I'm
more interested in making than just the
same as Coco yes
and I do want one outfit with you to
beat Coco without me because
quite that uh uh I'll
be what do we call it in huge Card
review in English
because in Swedish the time would be if
you seeked and sick it's like a sight so
it basically means outside
and you have your sighting out where is
that enough
there's a quick Swedish lesson here uh
making notes of the outfit for fun fun
there and phone
okay
no more chance of falling off the
platform stay on the platforms to be
chance
okay go down
that's not all of the chance
let's see
oh there we go I don't need F15 so like
three fives
what can those be could it more from
this yeah there we go
there they were
[Music]
either Spain's complete why is that not
the message in 2019. that would be more
fun I like it when messages changed it's
depending on the context
complete
obviously the yeah
and outside
hello Roxy
did the announcer
way Pasty
and also know that I'm actually run out
of time so actually
yeah I could still do the boss battle
tomorrow
because the
yeah oh yeah I was done I was supposed
to leave because the the uh the
prediction is still active
in for 24 hours I wish it was a bit
longer than 24 hours
at least it was like a week or something
the points doesn't have to be refunded
that quickly
[Music]
and they are confused
and power charge
yeah the power icon yeah I mean and I
know it's a charge power but I mean
could have been better icon
okay
come from there says Coco yes that will
be one outfits
how do you pronounce that I still want
to read this about it
music again or is it possible
and wait wait hello Roxy's
Saturday I think the prediction primer
is over so you can plan a nuts
put up dictionary
I wish I could because I put it at 30
minutes the longest time as I was saying
why can't I put it even longer
Machinery
stuff not be serious too
ball Jay
I didn't mean to say
wait
but I love the ball just bold so he
bouncing away if I may ask
[Music]
wait wait your name is clearly sweetie
sorry about that
Captain welcome
[Music]
I mean your name could be like Norwegian
too I guess
[Music]
yeah
you're so happy you're almost laughing
um
that actually makes sense that sounds
like something I've heard before
that's not how we have a spell Hugo I
think
very close let's go
Savannah
yes probably consider my pronunciation
of Mandel captain that I perhaps might
be finish myself
the Almond cat exactly
specifically the Almond cat just not any
almond cat
that's a good name
because it's about like it ended stick
quickly there they they had no
they were 100 and that cutscene
okay I've heard that this level is kind
of different
in the original the icon does not match
the sign of that thing it's way too
squishy
okay let's see
I mean so far it seems to be the same
so so far
backwards
that's oh wait I mean is that how it
works
no this is how it's gonna work
but these are accidentally flame that
basket making making the Jam play
upwards instead towards me this is why I
charge every baskets because
if I have to Flame them I have to wait
for the gym the land and then I have to
wait for Sparks to pick it up
but if you charge it and the gem just
flies towards me
let's see if I do this yeah wait and
then then it's nice towards me
SpongeBob voice after four oh yeah yeah
some of
these quite
yeah yeah isn't the voice of spiral even
in the first two games here it's
his voice in very nice Trilogy in all
three games
uh is that am I correct
did that happen
that sign was the same as the crash boss
fight with Bingo died he has final
attractions a lot of sounds in common
we got it from the website
cheapfoundlandfix.com anyway
um
let's continue
close to the end of the stream anyway
and everything for now but it will be
corrected for the next stream
tomorrow
but please please and also follow if you
want to see more aspire
being mean to play this game today but
the intended game but I don't like a
scene did not watch but honestly what a
massive slowdowns
[Music]
I heard something oh here we go what are
you two doing
oh okay
sorry I ate it
your grinder thieves keep taking our
lightning Stones if you can replace them
all and activate our generator I'd be
very grateful
acne
so I mean
per stuff it was already different was
that that initial
a scene was not in reignited
or the next part is different because
they are not here
yes
and also I have not watched SpongeBob in
English anyway
so I I'm not like familiar with how
SpongeBob is supposed to sound like
I barely watched any SpongeBob and
sweetie shiny so
there you go they also they are much
easier to like get into positions
I think I just throw it at them at those
connectors and they will connect
do they come out now
keep an eye on the place
I don't see anything
or do I have to replace huh now I hear
sounds
that's something going on now
and there's two of them
thank you
wait
oh I see I see how it works
so for each of these you place
one of them would spawn when you leave
but there's my assumption so far
okay let's place two then because I was
able to catch two of them
and then I move away
we have to replace all of them before
they show up or is it timer based
why does it say two didn't I get three
of them
why not to start you know that one count
do I have okay so I have to replace all
of them before this shot
what did you fall down anyway
s work working hard this one is yeah
what a bunny nice for you to learn
from Kenny oh wait sorry I'm not paying
attention to the comments again it's Tom
Kenny yes
what did I see
okay now it's the sound
wait
I died
the first is
it may not have to start that away
hey did you walk us through that scene
that doesn't make any sense
well that was silly of me
just fall off me
never like that
so I just touched her socks
but that's not so correct okay this does
not actually not count
this should count
anyway let's do this again
look now you have to voice the professor
in this two round oh you need adopt the
voices
they paid some Kenny
and when and then had him do as many
voices as possible
call Captain inspired yeah he he has
voice bar in most of the games
the problem I feel like with the
when trying to look up the voice and
it's not Inspire Wiki I need to make
suggest a change and this change was
taken into consideration but
the uh
sorry
there we go
this works
oh there's another one
oh it just disappeared
so
as I was going to say and spray Wiki it
does say if you go to a character he
says
who wants to character but what I don't
like
is and it's a very common I've seen on
different website and stuff is that at
least which years the car the person
voiced the characters
instead of listing which games where it
seems much more reasonable to list the
games
or come here
we're only one
come on
get in there
[Music]
I think it was the other place
as soon as it plays it
can I
know
yeah
I got that
that seems to be a monster in Diamond
[ __ ] now they're all the places
I mean more like that
now
this is the other place
turtle from The Sound because it sounded
so weird
I had some more here
someone more here
now now ah
this is
so you can place it here and then like
turn it back around it
and it kind of show up
because those are still active there
hello
you can
yeah there aren't any showing up here
like maybe I chose everyone who was
supposed to shopping
foreign
all of these are replaced now
oh
is these these two or this one I guess
I got replaced immediately
thank you Spyro I found this shiny thing
mix with our lightning
things don't take it as a reward
thank you for
give me a reward
[Music]
so and that one is done now
foreign
I can only see SpongeBob
I think he's ready
see
the SpongeBob is the only person who
voiced on on the characters
boys
because we live enough now
I'm ready
he's also spiral yes he's he's basically
playing every single character
because he he inspired in the second
third game and I don't know did he play
uh
what is uh you probably voice yeah I
didn't voice spying a few more spy games
he did reprise his role in reignited
like I mentioned nothing about anything
apparently so but he doesn't use his
SpongeBob voice for spider he he said
like his version
well yeah he really should
this this SpongeBob was perspire
wouldn't that be fun
yeah yeah I can see it
okay does this work in this game
up here so yeah can you follow along
camera I kind of need you
yeah it didn't work even though I didn't
see him see
for the table camera
perfect
now let's see if I can do this
what's with all of these
flying charging silicone yeah that's how
good I am in the game not pregnant yeah
building over there the gear Grinders
are using it to steal our electricity
okay what about that noise
I don't know these voice actors I don't
know what that I can't say do
or a red gym
see if I can remember that thing
so anyway
um
I don't think I need I have lower
platform
you can make it a bit harder by removing
you usually have an orb for me Spyro
you've done well so far you can have
this little trinket for good luck thank
you
they added the orb icons above them in
reunited apparently that wasn't
featuring original
the next Glide but only in the second
Spy game I don't think they have any
icons above any of the character in any
order
of the other two games
if I recall correctly like there's no 8
icons in
spires me
so that's an interesting change I guess
foreign
thanks for shutting down the factory
here I found this stuck between the
gears you can have it if you want
yeah the problem with having them so
close to each other is that the
when he did voice spiral compared to
when he didn't want SpongeBob
ah and
then miss one now I miss much more than
that when why am I Muslim so much
but I got says
small orbs though
[Music]
I'm missing so many gems
what am I missing I'll see
Spider-Man must have been
um yeah he he took a break from the very
first game because that's a brakes work
whoops
what am I missing
so spicy was November and SpongeBob was
in July there was yeah and then we they
can considered since situation what was
the development point was part two
uh
and when usually do the recording voice
lines When developing a game
and then what was the development time
for SpongeBob and when do they usually
recording voice lines
like that
and then you can you can estimate when
he did
you teach your voices
there's this one doesn't do anything
I have confused myself now one in it
whatever why have I done this to myself
that Krabby party technically SpongeBob
came out first yes
I would also not be surprised if when it
comes to TV shows that you do the voice
acting quite early but when it comes to
video games you do it quite late but
that's just a wild assumption
don't take any of that
because if I understood it correctly
when I do animation they are kind of
working around me
voices as the duty
like they do this storyboard and then
voice the stone board and then they do
the full animation with the help of the
voice back there I don't know
maybe they want to do that in some
animations
oh
but in voice buyer before SpongeBob
no he
he as it's
a token did not voice Spyro Inspire one
that was another person
um
it is
what you said yeah sorry sorry no sorry
no I accidentally it's probably the
invoice but first when you know how soon
they recorded yeah yeah I'm going to and
we look at the development time for
spider 2 and SpongeBob and determine
about when they usually do record
the voices always I'm supposed to go in
here I'm silly me walking around trying
to find anything they're in here
of course they're in here
there we go sending me thank you Spyro
you've deactivated
welcome regarding this Talisman
that's fine yes but I wasn't but I
thought that whatever
he said that the development for spy 2
was started early as November 98 and it
but yeah
there must be some information regarding
how long the development time was for
spiral 2 and SpongeBob
uh no that's this time at least
and then for a spiral was first dumped
to Swedish in Legend of spice 3.
and then
and that was the only original
spiral game with the Swedish
and down
sing
and then they released reignited as a
remake
and trans and includers which one
that's not how they should last I don't
know
and uh
the Swedish tab is also using this
SpongeBob The Voice or SpongeBob Sports
Spyro
voice spy team so lucky or something I
don't know how to pronounce that
foreign
that's my best attempt oh no they don't
have any chance
they are jealous
[Music]
[Music]
okay
this morning separently
I wasn't paying attention to that that
happened on the screen right in front of
me
Marine Sprite is killing a lot of two
but uh but I was more thinking about
deaths of the characters that Spyro
doesn't kill obviously we can't know
what characters fight with kill because
those are still vets
if you believe here here he's killing
someone it's still okay that's still a
murder I guess I guess they are trying
to kill spider teams
to be friends in self-defense
preemptive self-defense
which I don't think is a really nice
thing today
[Music]
challenge you can only kill enemies that
has hurt you
I was playing that game yesterday oh
wait uh Spider oh spider too
specifically that's neat
did you did you complete it
maybe 100
did you start from the beginning at that
point
how much can you tell about your
experience playing
[Music]
hello the water workers have boxed up
most of our baby turtles doesn't sound
like my problem
hmm
what
I guess I should say the baby turtles
I need 11.
I [ __ ] line
and this is also when I had to get back
to
Amazon
foreign
[Music]
going the wrong way
you're supposed to get wrapped around
pop the ramp I say
it's definitely easier to see through
the water again
hey we're next to it
step on it stupid
tour toys
okay
now let's take this
there's a challenge break every box
within the time limit of the super flame
this one has a flame I was like oh and
that makes sense
[Music]
oh yeah the timer is
every first timer in three years
thank you
oh it has a nice
line that goes down
yeah you're not going to be able to make
every
boxing
in one charge
I know it needs to me too I don't need
to kill this but
we got the rate
team
welcome and Raiders of course you're
also welcome
I am
um
and I'm
and you probably only know me
you know
I don't know
I am a bunny
I place the original spiral two
wish I
wasn't going to do
but I was going to play
spiral Shadow Legacy as according to my
schedule
but the game was lagging so much that
couldn't bothers playing it
so
yeah
so I tried another game
which was slagging a lot too so I went
on playing original Spider too I already
completed the first buyer so I thought
it was
appropriate to
100 this game as well
or Nico
I mean I didn't remember how it was
there
um oh yeah I remember one more boxes oh
I think I remember these two last boxes
are oh look at me now
I want to jumpstream
awesome
validity cheering I don't have the uh
foreign
that's the command
and let's do that anyway first
lullaby is a very nice and trying to
come up with me
fun is very fun I I love watching not
only need to play games
there's one of them
but they are locked in their own yes
massive most impressive thank you hey
thank you I I'm going to skip a bunch of
titles because otherwise this will take
too long
yeah not the not exactly as speed run
but
I'm not spending too much time on Me on
the game
so
um yeah yeah I'm I'm forgetting stuff I
wanted to think
um thank you young dragon so
[Music]
so yes that's hey yeah you were
doing some art
so how
how did it go with the Arts
oh yeah
[Music]
I'll probably find that I was slow I was
so I was not concentrating yeah
commission yeah you know also someone
said it was like a 20 minute 20 minute
20 second delay on the stream
and that was due to the lagging games
that caused my my I was trying to play a
game on my computer that lagged
everything
oh
it's a better Nike
I'm quite late so tomorrow it won't be
delay when I'll continue in this game
was it the
[Music]
secret commission you'll be working on
foreign
and then maybe I maybe I'm completely
wrong here
I probably
no yes
doing something
but didn't show what you were working on
or maybe you weren't working or anything
at this point
maybe it is something
don't get to my gym
but didn't make so many assumptions
okay
it's a fun game to watch I'm glad you
like liking it and I I'm I'm happy to
I'm trying to keep up the comments and
I'm doing that dude sometimes that's
sometimes
this is all darbs orbs no I need to
climb up on that scene I'm sorry for
companies with the home runs
um
and you started it and it's nothing long
ago
[Music]
yeah it like I started it
I'm only going for one and a half hours
started out with two hours into me I had
two hours into the Stream
and I have questions out there I don't
show but still sounds okay that yeah
that was the confusion
the orbs you're carrying have activated
this special portal you won't find a
Talisman in the Ocean Speedway but if
you're fast you'll get lots of treasure
have fun I like fishing I like fun let's
do this
yes that's okay have fun looking
yeah
I appreciate it
came in straight and I'm lucky
[Music]
if I say something
you have to give
I can't help speaking
you know me I'm very shy
when I get going I can speak quite some
I'm going at this
things in common
no we get this much fun fun show up his
skills yay
that was the charge button let's see
that's that's so much for that those
kills
I'll do it again
yeah I need to remember the flame button
I kind of messed up for playing all
those other spider games with the flame
buttons a little different button
so
unless you want me to complete these
okay now I'm now I'm getting into this
room
I just wanted to uh
although I haven't done
I did this level in now completely
amazing and everything happening
at this level with no flame in reunited
this is not another thing run so
yeah yeah it was yeah I'm completely
messed up
foreign
and then up
up
f f
and then press the plane button
oh no I missed one
not that one though where are you
here we go
and then finally
oh this is quick
wow
I love this track all right
I'm tired
there we go whoa
[Music]
complete
I did it
at 240 160 for the last time
yes
[Music]
it's all good
okay and then we have this
I don't remember correct you maybe there
was yes oh sorry about that
thinking you cannot like kill all these
innocent uh audience members
you get some reward
okay that was the same thing
Which lady
uh this camera is stuck
oh yeah you think you're pretty good
well let's see
I am asking a secret champion
all right Spyro to the coast champion in
order to win the race you must fly
through all the Rings beware of Hunter
flies through a ring first the ring will
start to shrink
so I so yeah so I don't have to win the
race I don't have to buy some Walgreens
[Music]
competition
like foreign
race works though
I've been sure well
hunting
how are you going in here
excuse me I'm trying to get through here
what's up ourselves
this is more like a challenge more than
a race
I was hoping I could agree sharing this
morning but oh well
thank you
we must
Legacy at the moment
[Music]
after killing all your people yeah I'm
good
I had to live in obedience and
understandable kitten you're very busy
and I'm
very understandable
of
you
that you're doing so good you're so hard
working and I am so proud of you
I have somebody working in the house but
I will enjoy my time here
all right I'll take back what I said
no and that's they said what I could
collect and affordable money climbing my
yay celebrations
now I want to go over the world not sure
I will get out then
I wouldn't be that bad idea
money Banks do you have something to
give me hey Spyro you see this wall here
I think that you're dying to know what's
on the other side now slowly I had a few
more gems I might be able to remember
how to lower the wall
this part is not dying and then he says
this
okay but as far as you know the portal
to Dragon Shores could be just on the
other side of this wall and there's only
one way to find out Tata
[Music]
such a huge one I don't even know my
device is kind of can be funny hey at
least it doesn't put me to a challenge
she has to give me worms
[Music]
like some other character
all right thank you I just need to
collect some gems which is pretty I mean
you could argue that collecting gems is
a challenge that we don't keep it
clicking gems this is my super challenge
but that's me
[Music]
that's just me
Aquaria tours
you suck money bags I do not suck money
Banks don't
links where
[Applause]
[Music]
in his behind if if only there was an
option I guess that's one of the
one of the NPCs you would like to have
and
um flammable
advertising my
and my modding
yeah
making characters
there's the idea is still have the idea
of uh it would be more of a Halloween
style mod where you can flame a
character and all that is left is
I should flame this before I bring in
the water because not that I need to we
got your own because I want it
and
it's where you can flame them and turn
them into skeletons
that would be doing something
nothing this is different
then pay attention this
in the United
States
you know what
let me quickly quickly come back in I am
impressed I need to make that
poor seahorse skeleton skeleton
sounds fun yeah you burn MC and what's
remains is
and it would be
not that I have to rig the whole
skeleton and make the skeleton adjust
this for every NPC uh so
that would be a lot of work
okay oh now I see I see now I see what's
going on okay now check it
so yes so that one is there uh even in
this game I'll be United it's just that
in this game you want lovers
when the Watcher comes in the water the
wall does not lower in reignited
which I really should consider doing
considering that some people are
struggling getting over the wall
and yeah
so
anyway and
[Music]
let's clear up this area before
racing the water level
easy quickly to run around
sharks
this this part is already filled with
Morgan I mean if she wasn't that anybody
here it would be kind of tricky
kinda tricky to getting up again it
makes sense
you can think of it with a ladder
I was like it totally fine
belly is like main characters I guess
eloara Hunter Moneybags
burning them and turn them into
skeletons would be something
because the whole skeleton will still be
read through their body so they would
still see everything was still animate
as they [ __ ]
I think I think it's been probably
but of course I am
very focused on my
oh there's a crab I'm ceiling not that I
needed to get rid of enemies in this
game which I wish I think I think
oh that man's got me
one thing I'm not uh one one reason why
I'm not a
really great but I guess completely hi
Spyro you must be tougher things with
your voice
sounded like I already did that
anyway
um
is that you don't get gems from enemies
they're not like getting gems from
enemies
and you're forced to jump down and
that's when you're not about to stay
okay
I think I cleaned out this area yep
and the final button
Scary Skeletons skeletons
I think these characters
yeah I have something that's actually my
brain is a mess
my brain is a mess of all the different
ways of saying stuff
I mix everything up
this is
tomato or a tomato it's wet again we all
want you to have this Talisman of
Aquaria Towers to remember us by
talisman
ping
thank you
and have a good thing
good day
good day
let's kill some sharks
hello sharks
do you want to taste this thing
[Music]
great what's with the eyes because of
eye
because it was a fire power up in
I think
but here is Monica but it is a Firepower
icon though so
am I wrong
I was gonna say shark no that's not a
shark that's that
new boat
no I was shooting in Sakina
why didn't I respond yeah okay
they don't spit you out again I got the
enemies instantly
there is a skeleton inside you I know
and if you want to see my skeleton
you can play I I mean like in front of
me the shooting strength into his mouth
why doesn't it die
oh yeah why not now some requests is for
a swimsuit
yeah yeah
thanks to your whole water level
starting to the end of it this is
you paying attention
it eventually okay
there's a shark can you stop eating me
there we go
give us some more shots
obviously not complaining
he lost my
I can't forgot about the swimsuit thing
but I'm not the one paying points we
have
the swimsuit shower that's your
responsibility I'm not going to give you
a freezing thing
unless it's you know a fresh flight
and now to the secret area that
most people don't even know about
wait aren't you supposed to give me a
sap
thank you
[Music]
it's a fire power up but it gets snuffed
by the water
uh which is super heated and still
launches at enemies oh so it's super hit
the water that
flies towards enemies I think I see that
makes sense
does it make sense it's like a plasma
players Stars flying person
says XD X3 not XD well no one's
predicted
three or more deaths before this bus
I mean there was no there was no desk
before boss I've been trying to tame my
new pet manta ray but he just won't obey
me hey I'll be trying to pack my obeying
monitoring
thank you
hello that would be I'm trying to pay my
first month I owe you something for that
yeah
Mario is why are you speaking so weirdly
and can't you speak normally hump day
and also how are you speaking on them
I'd love to get him in the racing shape
care to take him through a harder course
okay I I can see why okay good luck
in some ways that the original Hunter
has some interesting ways of saying
stuff but he's I don't know I don't like
it
I have played original games no I can't
really why
why but he just speaks so slowly
I think it's that's what people like
about the old mountain
[Music]
well
almost messing up
thank you
[Music]
let me send one
there we go
incredible aren't this voice sounded
familiar in there I could use a partner
like you you can have the orb I found in
my other flipper too I could you support
knock you
is that I shouldn't do you have this
voice
I'm trying to obey my Monterey
now that doesn't sound like Auntie
anyway I messed up
hello King Hippo
the water workers have kidnapped my
children and hidden them in the tops of
these numbered Towers I borrowed some
explosives to blast the doors off the
towers
why not blast the powers
if you can make it to the top of the six
number Towers
but yeah that's good let's go
electricity additional thing
that shows where the electricity is
stuck in in the United that's not the
difference
I guess the United major cities
[Music]
it also makes sense there's a something
shooting that existing there's more gems
foreign
focuses on the scene where it's
um but in these games the camera is
still focuses on spider I think doing
United the other day
it's yeah but that's because I honestly
think reignited overall like does it
better than the original trilogy even if
the 390 is an accurate you know Trinity
that's
but they are saying some things that I
think to really introduce it as better
but like
like overall like animations and
some things are just easier to tell
what's going on
but I know that's that's conspirational
opinion
controversy
Ethan is lagging
but that's only because I can appreciate
both the original ending I guess to
separate them
because I can still play the original
games
they usually the Remake hasn't replaced
the original names
so let's
on this Tower
was nothing and yes it was me
ding
perhaps
you get to leave perhaps
did I even
oh yeah
what about the Sharks up back
sharks are back
I never had the original game Serena it
was my first experience
like like I was there finally
jump out
and now I'm basically showing you the
whole game
move too quickly
I love smooth tickets here again
no sharks nope I've killed them all we
can swim in peace I heard that you were
collecting these orbs please take this
one
and I don't need this this is just
garbage for me so can you just take it
for me with my hands
I'm not missing gems that was amazing
oh that's a lot of gems about 71.
boy can 71 gems behind me
let's see
well shipping away other than easy
search the ground now which I'm sitting
here
oh there's a gym
let me see more gems that means that it
shouldn't be any more red I mean that
doesn't mean
it's likely not anymore gems because
it's at Round Cemetery
70 gems behind me oh here we go
there's a ten there's six left
that's a 25
that's
wait
my brain there's 35 left and here we go
25
20 10.
I said this and with 10 lefties
really really
likely that there are Reds
with two fives could be one pen
what is that one yeah it is
I didn't mean to kill you
where can I hold 10 behind him
I don't really have a
Parts starch option
you know what level it's not telling
where they could be on here
up here
oh yeah very right too fast
[Music]
you know what it's time for now
maybe there's been four hours
it's been four hours
it's time to exit the level and
now I could like
you go
now it says bulge
thank you
because icing
lightly a test
because those are hard to run away from
[Music]
summer forest
now that you have six
party oh you did
just jump to the water the floor
just jump found the hole you can trust
me okay here it comes here comes the bus
battle and here's what the whole
prediction has been building up the
words
are you ready
shame
okay
this text is missing in every United
States for some reason
but I've heard that they added it to you
[Music]
um the switch version Crush I didn't
remember it I would I was going to write
boss one brush
okay
this week in the winter Tundra the
professor was working on some new super
portal technology
there that's the last orb in place
how about two
two
the button and then and then but wait I
mean it maybe it shouldn't do it
[Music]
okay I can have SpongeBob in there
and now that I now it's time candy I can
hear okay let's see him again
wonderful
Crush go back and pack my bag
is say hello
you
oh my oh my I can't see the switch I
think I've broken my glasses
damn train Crush
and scatter them throughout avalor
quickly
no go Crush gasly orbs now
foreign
[Music]
Hunter why didn't you chase him
uh yeah I uh would have gone after him
but didn't he say something about not
liking dragons professor
could we catch a dragon to help us yes
yes I think so we'll need a world that
has an alignment much better suited to
intercepting one of these creatures how
about glimmer good idea we better go
right now
how about making a Gateway in glimmer
wait a minute that's not the title
biology
okay let's see if I can do this without
dying
[Music]
for some reason
you can't blame these peoples
the other big bosses you can't think is
a slow gameplay
and it's not lagging this is
it full speed is
all right where are you going
wow
well not much oh now they're red
but then she well
wow cat oh no I got damaged
I'm not doing this perfectly
well oh it's speed running
now
am I supposed to avoid these
there you go
nothing's fun
ah
I know he's chasing me
and my Knights pick up and see I can't
pick up these things
I mean it's used
sleeps are making it easy
money I mean if I don't take any more
damage that means that I picking up ship
wasn't a factor but I mean
I don't know then she packed me
runs by Run
okay I did it
I did it in without dying
not that established about the Sheep
anyway so I picked them up you may have
building
what's the
[Music]
okay
well I did it in Sierra attempts that
would be very happy for the two people
who voted for that which of one is water
bunny
because that's only a thousand so they
get ripped to his cause enough damage
all his meddling has cost me a fortune
if it wasn't for Spyro I'd be bankrupt
if ripped over here
in fact I give him a lot more than that
I was a champion bantamweight boxer at
University and I still know a few moves
but
why are you
what uh
almost all of 3500 points
congratulations
and I don't remember who the other
person was
put in 10 so
you get finally anything but
are you sure that zero is the correcting
results I want to say that zero would
make maximum because I didn't buy
without trying but there we go no why
did you leave I completed the first one
and not 100 because I have not gotten
any
nice see that here
uh
there we go yes there we go all right
glamorous salvation
it's safe I can save again I guess
same game
[Music]
oh wait yeah no yeah it sees four
thousand five hundred points
okay there must see it as a fact
yeah simply there you go now but it
saved during the transition anyway so
when the game is running fine unlike
inspires three on PS1 for some reason
then what doesn't want to run this is a
shame
and
down
nice
I started watching a new person
yesterday
because of
someone
