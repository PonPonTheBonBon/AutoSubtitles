hello welcome and
game is starting up
I tried to make the game
now
you got something and so I tried to make
make it so the game would
render a bit narrower so my avatar
wouldn't cover
very loud it shouldn't be louder than
previous time
I've actually reduced the volume a bit
I know yeah on the uh
oh yeah yeah it's it's it's a good
amount of loudness
yeah the rabbit stream was has some odd
issues
and that was wrong with this here we go
here's game
yeah yeah it's better to be able to turn
down volume to hear it better than not
being able to turn up the audio
there are a few streamers
streaming at quite low volume so I can
barely hear what you're saying when I
play it on mobile
I need something to drink
[Music]
oh
anyway back to the game
not many watches this time
and also uh
a certain someone is missing
[Music]
um
[Music]
because it says that I have one Watcher
and The Watcher I have is welcome
you have vodka no that's that's like a
great drink
for some
[Music]
oh yeah it's doing anything again
oh
so it's time to start the third game
well let's begin
welcome kitten
so
um
I would like to skip the cutscenes
because otherwise
I mean I'm probably going to do more
challenges this game it's it's a better
knots
spend time watching the same cutscenes
over an hour
we were waiting for you
yeah hello kitten I was wondering where
you were
I was kind of late I mean I was a minute
late result
so the game is working properly this
time I actually make made sure so steam
is behaving correctly
so now I actually cannot flame without
needing to restart the game
when the stream starts
back how it should be
yeah so anyway
so let's
87
no it doesn't
I could try to pronounce the name of the
Swedish way
oh I missed one
I'm sorry but I'm here now yeah you came
in before the game started which is the
most important
and here you got a bunny
how sad look here Dragon if you know
what's good for you you'll turn around
look here rabbit yeah
let's get rid of that okay
so
in this game we have these
other animals like this kangaroo like
last time I played it and
I do want to rescue them first
since they are required for different
other levels
let's start the Hunter
he wants to do a Glide
and then
a hover
like that
beautiful kangaroo she's
I do like the original the
sign
wait I don't need to fly yet
the design of Sheila in the original
I call it a kiln shape
now she has quite a lot of waist
it just looks weird and I'm not used to
it
I guess it works fine as a character
design
in itself but it's not how I'm used to
Sheila looking
okay
now flying for real
um army
Amy
so there is someone who made a mod
changing how she looks
I don't know how well
this month is working like with
animations and such
I should try it out yes they see
but I do need 300 gems before I can
rescue her
so let's
gather that up
there's a lot of gems spread around and
also I need to remember that I'm
currently doing a no flame button
challenge it's important that it's the
no flame button
Liam because last time I played this
game that was the no
abilities spider had passed by one
where I avoided swimming and such
but now I can actually do swim
some swimming
just a few more gems
almost there
six more
Bruce
that was all the eggs
oh yeah if I pick up this
this
and this one now I have exactly 300
oh look can you see
no he's standing around the corner
Panther there
Twice The Hunters we don't need more
than we don't wait I was supposed to
avoid us we don't even need one Hunter
okay
yes but let's see what he says if you
this if you reject him
next Thursday
oh no
she's going to die
yeah
let's free her I hope you appreciate
this favor I'm doing in letting you out
my feelings eh right
doing my job
I reckon you be one of them dragons then
yeah named Spyro never thought I'd see
one you dragons used to rule this entire
world you know then all of a sudden you
left
dragons used to live here and Joe the
was over a thousand years ago I think
and they just left
and the weird thing is after they left
all the magic in the world just sort of
went with him I mean they say this world
used to have magic coming out of the
wasu flying ships singing has a bit of a
weird voice
it all just dried up
that way some of the portals don't work
yeah they're starting to fade out too
one by one should I
I've always Point fun in this
and they just left
and where's my controls there we go
Sarah gems
because if I do voice pon pon I do think
it's worth watching the cutscenes but
it's still fun to see ponpon in because
it's but I said
no flame button means that I cannot use
that button at all meaning that with
Sheila
I can still not use the same button I
can do a kick
but she kicks with both buttons so I can
actually use all of sheena's abilities
so that's no problem
and the problem will be in other
I wanted you to do two jumps please
in other animals which cannot
uh use both buttons
all right I can ignore the camera yeah
poor poor kangaroo now she's Prince and
it's good
okay your voices will make fun fun
sounds super cute
thank you thank you I'm
I'm happy you think so uh I do think my
voice acting is going to be terrible but
at least it's better than having a
spider's voice I hope I should probably
add it as an optional add-on and not
for seven one teaspoon on his voice
hello
um
Wolverine
I don't know you get to choose how you
want it pronounced
hoy
what's up
currently going through this
why is he climbing on a wall
currently Sheila is not restricted by
this challenge so
are they since you can use both buttons
to attack I'm pretty sure I can double
check the controls just to be sure I
could be wrong
uh isn't there others
that's nothing for
a toggle character here we go Sheila
kick is BMX B is disabled but X works so
I can still kick
oh I had fun fun voice acting
yeah uh I mean
and his wolf is fine yeah that does work
I think I called you wolf before so she
should probably continue
um yeah I guess I could try to voice act
I don't know how much I don't remember
this is the dialogue
and they just left
all right dragons used to live here
I do want to change it for rabbits or
something although there are rabbits
living in this world so it doesn't make
too much sense I guess
but I want to replace the dragon eggs
with Easter eggs and have rabbits hatch
from them
there's a storm right now
and the Thunder is scaring my cat
you need to cuddle your cat
he died from that
I'm just going to steal all your gems
you have spread around this world
peeling the boobies
oh there's one left that's why he
doesn't want to cross now he wants to
cross
did I get everything
maybe something in the previous room
give me the Dragon
you're welcome
ma'am
more exciting is fun hard at first but
fun yeah I do think I would
well I would certainly get some
experience after voicing every line
there's a lot of lines to voices by
everyone
and then in
there is no line in part two because all
the line spices are in pre-rendered
cutscenes
so there's no pump on two boys
I mean it's not important to get all the
gems should I get all the gems
let me know if you how I missed that one
so I missed the five somewhere
ah
I miss a two up here
that means that means that too and I won
somewhere
yes all the gems okay I'll get back and
find the remaining gems
shouldn't be too hard
ah here's one
that one
so there's all that too missing unless I
missed two stones
I hear this
okay there's a one so there's a single
one left so I forgot about that
a rock somewhere
I guess
you're so smart you can find them all
thanks for a compliment
[Music]
um
but can I I'm not doing a great job at
the moment because I cannot find the
last one I could use the orb but
that's next question should I
maybe I should
you're doing great
thank you I I guess I haven't died yet
so I
but I will certainly die
I do have a death counter but it doesn't
seem to work opening
yeah yeah yeah
I forgot about that egg
let's
it's a good thing I went back
so I'm missing I want somewhere
so yeah yeah to what
since yeah
or okay I should use the orb
okay it's over here
I didn't take you in a far enough yeah
there it is
that's why I didn't pick it up someone
is not picking it up
no I didn't want to talking I didn't
even
jumped over here
which is the Swedish expression for
ignoring like skipping something is to
jumping over it
so it would have been a perfect pun if I
did this in Swedish
you did it thank you
and we still left me to miss that one I
still blame the orb
the warp should have picked it up
so now let's go to
the sunny Villa
amid the Lions
though
I don't know what that means
and now that I'm not good at them sounds
so when I say something like
so I said things like Sue
and that's why I use the letter name
send because if I would hit C you
wouldn't be able to know which letter
right
polish you did it okay
um
I'm not going to remember that though
can you get some Swedish
so let's run around and it will
since there is a lot more pain money
bags in these levels
as you can wrap some extra gems at least
in the beginning
and so it looks a bit different because
which I mentioned I've mentioned a few
times
I'm using the month that changes her
appearance for how the ferris looks in
the first game
I should remember who made the mods but
it's not
too hard to find it I guess
if you do have the game on PC I guess I
could
give you a link
just let me know
polish would be very difficult to speak
if you cannot pronounce the letter I
said
a lot of words use it much more than
English does
well the question is
if if it would cause any ambiguity
and it would obviously give an accent
that's that's part of my accent now
speaking English
and similarly I do have trouble saying
that sound
yeah which is usually
prefix but then some
lucky good job I sometimes might say
good job instead that would be the
Swedish way
yo
and here I got another egg
miles
did you know that all actually I don't
know if that actually applies to
everything like but as far as I know
all the a names
and other names of baby dragons are the
same in every language except for polish
uh
I think the eight times are different in
Polish I think baby dragon names and the
um NPC names as well
as well as in Arabic because therapists
using different script but Arabic at
least tries to transcribe the names
so you could argue that the Arabic names
are the same as in English
the only names that do you differ
between languages are for example the
characters of Romeo and Juliet
Juliet and because
they use the names that were given in
in their official official I don't know
most known translations of the story
because there's no official translation
could be able to inflict the names and
four names are decent inflecting polish
they had to be changed but they don't
use the name Santa wear so
plus you have to inflect names in
wayward children instead of the other
name
I mean spiders names because all the
playable characters are the same they
are not changed
as foreign
polish name
Inspire is the inspire
nothing no gym there
so doesn't seem like that's was an
important factor and those names are
actually spoken in dialogue while the
embassy names are not
I cannot say that you're wrong but it
would be a very strange reason
doing well so far
yeah but she lies with an A and
Spider-Man oh and they are easy rules
for inflatables okay what about
Bentley
and I want to talk to you
what what about whatever
Sergeant bow
did I no I did not
let's get in here
oh come on
why don't you want to give up there you
go if you scrape along the wall you
apparently lose a tiny bit of height
I think I'll keep missing these
I didn't say they were impossible just
difficult yeah I mean I tried I didn't
try to
imply that I'm just saying
my whole argument is it's it would be
strange to use that argument to
if the whole idea was to be easier to
inflict names if when they only change
the names of the characters that aren't
mentioned in dialogue okay I guess Marco
was mentioned when they didn't change
the names of the characters who are
mentioned in dialogue
that's kind of why so that argument
doesn't make any sense whatever mostly
mostly like that I was thinking
foreign
that they wanted to change our names but
their instructors do not change any of
the
main character's names
at least playable character because
Hunter's name is changed in seven
languages so
to be fair
okay I cannot progress this level if I
don't get rid of this one and there is
no way I can get rid of
can you stop making that face without
flaming him should I have to Flame him
that opens this gate and now I can
complete 11.
Sanders
yeah
maybe because it wasn't even a chicken
I'm learning I want to say
main character probably got a pass
because they were making yeah that's
kinda
so yeah I mean yeah it could stay with
the reason but
but yeah main characters cannot change
can I change the playable characters
let's do some skateboarding
I'm nanny so much yeah there's a lot of
language stuff here too
is that
if you have any questions
I I tried to claim that one nothing
happened I wonder why
my flame button
it doesn't work
Linguistics are interesting yeah it's a
I find it Linguistics quite interesting
and I do want to
if anyone is interested because it with
this song
I think it is one person who has been
shown interest in learning Swedish so
there's the idea of playing through the
game in Swedish and kind of go through
the Swedish language
I will still do this stream in English
but in the purpose of
exploring Swedish
yeah
oh well
so bad for you I speak Swedish
so anyway
of course I would Mark those strings
because I didn't name the strings for
what they are so you know what to expect
okay I've been through here many times
now
see this should be this one
and then the final two which are these
which would be much uh other one which
would be much easier if I had the flame
okay one more try
foreign
I have to focus on one of them
there we go
I did it
Emily
let's change your name to
change your name to Evelyn
as a reference so now I should do it
within three minutes without falling off
the board I don't know if I did the last
one in under three minutes
but even if you do it in the other three
minutes without falling off the ball you
still don't get posted at the same time
but do you think you should do that get
both
yeah I don't speak Polish I cannot drink
that
so that's both of them
I did it last time
so I should be able to do it I mean I
can see a mistake
so
I can I see the counter by the way I
keep forgetting that
I don't have a
two screen setup and I'm still playing
on the
laptop it's the best best thing I have
but one day my streaming setup will
improve
well at least I
I recognize Spanish
I already recognize polish I guess don't
pronounce it properly
because I haven't read up on the
orthography
I heard that up on some of the Spanish
photography so
yeah hablo Bolognese English Espanol
that's my
as good as Spanish as I can do
so one more
let's see if I can get this one
nope
okay
I'll have a few seconds left be here
like 50 of them yes yeah that was a good
Spanish pronunciation
I did my best
thank you
I speak Spanish English some French I
crash because I read the comment it's
your fact like I wouldn't blame you this
was my choice
I would learn another language yeah I
learned Swedish they don't have to you
can choose any language you want
but I can of course help with Swedish
oh that was a short yeah
thank you
now these were
like
like platforms you could stand on the
original with the gems on
they are removed as platforms that's a
change
I don't know why that says did I get
everything in here
's a trick
if you didn't know about it
if you use Sparks
any points
not at the exit that means that there
are gems left
I'm learning Swedish Arabic Japanese and
Russian there's a lot of languages
that's so cool
it's the uh
I wanted to get this off it would be
nice if there was a get off mode button
how am I outside in here
silly me
now
I can't use it while you're on a board
now
I still miss subjects
okay
uh one more
I'm running out of time
okay now
he points at exits
that means there's no more gems in here
so anyway you can do a point scoring
thingy
but before that let's read this comment
I can read Czech and Ukrainian just
can't speak them though they're similar
enough to polish
there are a few things that can't be
understood
that that can't be honest
yeah it's kind of like
me and Norwegian I guess
so and then
you can do tricks
like that
apparently that wasn't that trick
so
yeah there aren't any big ramps to the
trickiest of here
so I'll continue on this ramp
[Music]
I had the same problem with Portuguese
it sounds very similar to Spanish but
very different
it basically allows you to
can I
do four sometimes but sometimes three
yeah I'm kind of running out of
available tricks to do so I guess I'll
just do this for a while
oh I fell off
a bit called
no I crashed
I crashed on a crush anyway I mean
eleven thousand is not bad
skill point
I want to show off my skateboarding
tricks
an Italian pumpkin is so cute
let's have some problem appreciation
moment
here you go
home
thank you so Assassin's Creed II and
he's a lot of Italian that I only
understand because of Spanish
it is fun to be able to understand a
language you don't speak because of
similarities
cutscene
should I do some voice acting here
[Music]
huh
uh um
scary sorceress
is it safe for small dragons and
Pussycats oh thanks but I think we can
look after ourselves
I don't remember the dialogue so
foreign
rate my voice acting
oh I missed the gym let's continue to
cloud spiers
I've seen that clip on your YouTube
channel
wait what
perfect my voice acting was perfect
nah not perfect
but if I do the actual recording and
syncing up properly to use several
attempts it could at least
be better
yeah I cannot tell you much about this
one
although he cannot do much about my my
me
hello
okay I guess I'll
I have to find a way to turn the cloud
generator on it is very cloudy though so
maybe you don't need to generate much
more clouds
I don't know
something tells me that
a gliding tutorial
in the third level I play
I guess it's it's fine
but yeah
I saw the clouds for natural the they
don't have to be generated I could be
wrong there
it's a magical world where things aren't
natural they have to be generated
let's collect more gems
and try to avoid sewing
others ATM
and a bird
they are naturally formed but they make
extra class for here sometimes they have
reasons reasons on that that was a
terrible reading
can I get that one
okay that was the worst timing
okay I cannot get this egg because the
egg will not trigger as long as this
animal exists
so I guess that egg is stuck there
sounds like home
cloudy
although the cloud looks a bit
but I was gonna say they look a bit too
realistic but they kind of don't look
realistic
oh I got off gems
I need to activate this
and here we got a nice bear beer bear
yeah
Precious Precious
all right that was
okay now thank you
now
so that's those enemies taken care of
all I saw was a cute bow on a bunny I
mean yeah I guess if you look up like
that it kind of gets in the way
how how much because yeah you can look
between spiers horns
kind of a weird zoomed in view because
it's not the first person it's
it's top of head View
I don't remember
maybe it's a custom animation playing
custom animation maybe it's an animation
playing when you soon go to the zoomed
in view
which means that I could whenever I get
the custom animations to work so I can
make one-pon anime like a bunny
in that case I can also animate that
animation so looking through
using this 17 view doesn't block The
View with the bow so much
ah all right can I charge this that was
a mess
okay I guess I'm going through them yeah
I cannot attack this
yeah that's a problem anyway let's get
this thief then
as far as calm gets in the way
narrower
so it's fine
I'm sorry I cannot wake up thick sleepy
cloud
come here Thief
you have my egg
or we have a dragon egg it's not my egg
right
I'm so silly you're the perfect amount
of silly
we need a bit silly here it's good to be
silly because it's silly is fun
oh so close
the bird came came in the way I also it
came in the way
because that's how we say it in Swedish
got in the way
yeah Dragon Eyes because rabbits don't
lay eggs
it's privately Easter eggs
that's what the rabbits on East right
and I'll do
I guess I got everything
yeah it says so here
only during Easter
well I guess this place out here in
Easter
oh yeah another challenge I come to
because I don't have Flame
I'll try to gather some of the eggs I
can
but that's still
three eggs I cannot get due to lack of
flames
there's one more I can get I should go
and pick it up
after I collect all these gems
please turn it off
okay
oh there are no gyms okay so why am I up
here
if only rabbits could breathe fire yeah
it would be so much easier for rabbits
could breach fire
so I just have to rely on the lack of
Fire
if only rabbits could fly but this this
rabbit can fly
so here it's a play Without fire because
Travis cannot be fired but I can still
fly because
there is no because
you've never seen a rabbit fly no
actually haven't
to be honest I missed
thank you for the push
and then take these four takes
I've seen this rabbit fly but this
rabbit has magical wings so
it's fair
now this Vortex is here I can use it to
get up here
and I assume it's not enabled from the
start because from up here you can reach
kind of skip
parts of the level
double kill
yeah I don't think you can
oh yeah
you can kind of skip money bags if you
could get up here before paying for
money bags and I wonder if the word
vortex enables
it probably enables when you get to the
end of the level actually because that
Vortex is also disabled
to both activate the same time you could
do this which is the intended route
or roots or you can do that
if you want to play safe
it's so cute
yeah I wanted her wings to be
it's hard to get a good look of the
Wings
yeah there's some kind of weird
visual glitch going between the the two
upper
feathers if you can call it that
it wasn't intended like like that
I should probably tweak that maybe
someday
if I put it
in that case oh yeah wait I meant
they were they can be pronounced either
like out or root take your pick
yeah I kind of defaulted to the route so
um
the neutral way is to say routes
or yeah
let's continue with the next level
at last my portal is working
thank you
hydration anyway
let's continue lemon
so okay I can basically charge
everything here except these things
so there is a risk I will leave some
lives on this level
oh you caught me anyway
how are you
if I touch I touch
that's quite the Smoky flower
now show something into the lava
I guess something will eventually end up
in the lava
I'll try to touch that
oh someone Ricky someone has hidden an
egg there
and I got shoved in the lava
okay
sure to keep your friends
yeah the the thing you wanted to show me
was already dead
no rabbits don't belong in the lava I
fully agree with you
something will eventually done in lava
here we go here are some enemies they
might end up in lava let's try it
he fell through the lava so
um that wasn't what I wanted
he missed me ah you got me
there he goes
straight into the lava
where he belongs
belongs belongs something something
ah
there we go
there we go again
that's three enemies in the lava
I might be able to do this yeah I did it
oh thank you currently
oh no I don't want to exit yet I want to
push these down in the lava as well
there we go
and this one
there we go
more enemies in the lava
oh here we go money bags again
you're welcome honeybaks
entity thing this actives only requires
charging so no problem there
push my legs in the lava I wish I could
push him
I am working on mods that allows you to
do more things to your NPCs primarily
flame them so you can punish them I
guess
whoa
I got a skin point for breaking it and
then I got an extra knife
from Apple inside it skill points gives
extra knives as well
now I got plenty of extra knives
so this is
so this is a supercharge I don't know if
you can call it a ramp
but it is currently disabled
which confuse a lot of people I've seen
a lot of streamish
and because that's basically what I
do on my free time watching People's
dreams bio I met a lot of nice people
that way
and they are curious on how they should
enable the ship shot so they can catch
this excessive
but there is no way to enable it you
just have to change it
it is
very very fast
slightly
slow than you are
I wonder if it's technically it's faster
than you are and you have to get it
through these corners Moira
so and then you talk to him and now it's
enabled
one
would imagine that everyone can utilize
the supercharge
um
oh I crashed into one nights and that
these exhibs are fast because they are
running on a supercharge
but apparently this executive is already
shipped fast and it doesn't get
I run past them and doesn't get a
supercharged by this super charge ramp
so it seems to only affect spiral I
guess
okay attractive slow down slightly later
take it so if I had flame it would be
easier
I know
it did it wasn't this thing here because
I constantly ran past him every time now
this isn't good
level design and I haven't like this
level
oh my gosh
[Music]
you don't get it better than that
there you go
running too fast Kermit
anyway
I think that's all
that is that
of course there are more gems where
where
was that all yeah it must have been all
now
yep he says it's cleared out
and then there is this level I cannot do
so let's go home without falling into
the lava no I should I use the key
whatever I can use the key next time
it is not counting gems because
it takes the value I had before entering
the level
and the current value and the current
value is lower because I paid money bags
it's actually lost gems on that level
I don't see text on this side I'm going
to show you how you can redesign unless
the sun is talking enforcement now in
that case it should have been voice
acting
talking sign
let's go to the next world
yeah hey my portal is working now it's
clear not
hate answers
until the dialogue was over that's when
it started working
talking talking talking signs that would
be cool
one way is to have a speaker on it I
guess
living science
so now underwater
thank you that I surely appreciate that
on the water you cannot use flame anyway
so
this section is unchanged
okay
so just Place Normal
I heard someone
that was a duck
it wasn't you I heard I had
someone with a
whatever is called
I was going to say torpedo oh there you
are
oh it's it's kind of like a bullet or
something
there is a hidden sign in Super Mario
Galaxy it's like the first time you'll
ever read in the game
wait
how is it hidden but also the first sign
you read
life hidden in a place you have to go to
get all gems
oh
press the button to get a guidebook
that's a
TV button I think it's got
let's continue
finding more eggs
Jason
skipping the eggs
I'm gonna rush into the game
but I want to get to the parts where not
having flame actually matters
okay
are they explained on the edge strange
battles you got here
but these people I should be able to
yeah there you go
so basically have to use the flame flame
basically you have to use the barrels
you have to take them out
there's a door
to a shop but the shop is closed
interacting with the door allows you to
read the note
that is on the door however you you're
actually reading this sign hidden behind
the door oh oh yeah
I think I heard that kind of
design used in some games
okay this isn't going to work
and yeah I'm pretty sure I'm not able to
knock them up all the way
but maybe I'm able to do that oh yeah I
was able to do that
Panda pun is strong able because those
barrels seem to be very heavy
for some reason I can't remember
destroying these
but that was probably in
agent mines level yeah
just
he scrapes her head against it
destroy it
lives saving
upon the pun is powerful pumping is too
powerful she must be stopped
yeah
it's a very precise jump you have to do
are you going to teach me about hovering
in like the fifth level now
okay I did that because it was fun
but look at what we got here
after I get rid of these
Sheila
a new carry this sign
come on in
Sheila
she has a very tiny backpack I want to
watch these stores in it
I can swim
six and a half where it's not time
you can only be on the surface
was there a
entrance here
one egg
Jared Jordan
still missing these that's my
specialty
now cutie just kicked this yeah good
and here we got the stupid seals
[Music]
bomb
hurts before the fuse runs out okay it
seems like a very stupid idea to light
the bombs and now instead of after I
take everything out a bit sure
what a cute kangaroo
yeah I should just like I made spider
into panformation
but you only have to do this I got in my
way
all right
Point Blank shot by a cannon
and then the last one
and that's all
three and thirsty leaves
[Music]
yeah I can't believe you did that either
all right it's quite quite amazing to be
honest all right
didn't even try to eat it this is a
quite the
View
I haven't really explore this area when
there is there's something there
foreign
level geometry it is
one didn't wait one minute survived
there was three I can still see three so
all of them survived
certainly what you're talking about
here I still fail at this this game
doesn't have any so-called coyote time
for Sheila or Aspire I think so as soon
as you left leave the ground ah maybe
there's a tiny bit
or I timed it badly
I tried to tame it badly but I was bad
at it so I couldn't even time it badly
I got squished
here take this
oh you're strong but I missed him
somehow
can you take it a bit easy with these
barrels
why are you throwing so many barrels
you like them around
but during the scene so he went into
came out yes three one team two came out
and the one who didn't come out
stayed in the Fortress cut
but survived the blast
that's that's kind of what that dialogue
said
wow I can't believe I survived the blast
laughs
unless you mean it was some kind of
ghost or something
now I'm doing terrible
thank you
that's terrible
[Music]
I like gems he's a ghost and in denial
that he didn't survive last
a very realistic ghost you could
interact with though but I'm sure
he's a bit laggy but
hey
I'm doing the best I can
maybe it's the spirit
it is the spirit
physical interactable
Spirit you interact with realistic
ghosts in The Witcher
I haven't played the witches
I
should have played with Jay
okay
how do I shoot this
I can't shoot with this button I cannot
shoot with this button I can accelerate
but I can't okay so I cannot shoot with
this thing
so this is
yeah this is going to work sorry I have
to leave
wait how do I leave
thank you
that's how I have to leave
well I guess I just can't do that
is that the special one I think so
apparently not
yes I can help you with that game
I guess so if I have trouble with the
game
I could place through it I just don't
have the games I can't play it for that
reason but
sure
could um
if people would like me to follow up
happy
if people would like to see me food
around them which
is such a long game
I do prefer games that have like more
shorter levels at individual levels the
game can be long I don't have problem
with that like for example I do want to
play kill the world
she's a really long game
I think it's like 200 levels
but each individual level is short and
that's what I like
I like games with a good story
their way
we have different
things we enjoy
it sounds like an yeah I respect that
I don't mind like it's too many either
but I am not as interested in games when
she basically plays what it
I would say like you sure like Witcher
has a cat
I haven't played with I have this camera
for example so I can use camera as an
example you to have individual missions
that that is a thing and you could see
the Envision missions as individual
levels to do but you still have one
whole world and you have still have
these long
the main goals of the game and so and
such
it's not really my type of game
but um
I could still play it if people really
want me to play it but I still want to
play like strange weird old unknown
games
I have the books too
yeah
have you read how many books are there
six of them I don't remember
I don't remember because I haven't
looked up I never did three games
but for some reason I want to remember
there's six books for some reason but I
could be wrong about that
I might be confused that with something
[Music]
okay
so I replace Sparks with an orb
and
then I decided I kind of randomized the
name
and basically alias
and became lame I guess
I don't I don't remember what it stands
for
eight books okay I
was wrong
yeah wait but two of them are Loosely
connected standalones okay so there's
six main sets so I was right
right and wrong at the same time
so far so good
and if someone
and if it isn't obvious what I'm trying
to do is doing this flight level without
using plates
and I have it I did it first try
this flashlight
easy it's like I think this is a good
flight level to start with if you want
to like get more into
flight let's do a race this is going to
be point
[Music]
I think this race would take two minutes
to do
third place
yeah I should announce my position as
well
I
can focus on when I change position now
I must I was constant well I was
concentrating about an hour and fourth
place
due to that mistake that means that
might actually help me
problem with so the flight level is
pretty easy this race hour is a very
precise
and I don't really get why
second place I have a wing in my vision
when a wing in my eye let's just turn
them and be small when I sometimes on
camera
second place so only one more butterfly
too
pass
fully concentrated on the flight for now
and this is the final lab for that you
can read
that it is a bit laggy Let's ignore that
first place
and that's that race two minutes
now yeah and the main Series starts with
the third book
the first two books are set to take
place sometime during the main series
oh oh okay
first prize first place yeah and then I
cannot do the haunted challenge pretty
sure that I just go to him and see
uh oh I have a Deja Vu I know this race
from somewhere
wait do you know it from Spire okay
no excuse me I want to talk to you
okay thank you
cheating butterflies there is no way
they can fly faster than a rabbit
honestly
I don't know how fast the rabbit can fly
GG it's kind of hard sometimes to read
these small text on this
okay
press the aox button for terrible okay
no problem press the non-existent button
for to fire yeah that's your problem
[Music]
so I can boost
and then I can die and that's it
it's too dangerous you cannot do much if
I don't have a cheat button
no I didn't want to I I accidentally
pressed one too many times
I want to exit this level
sorry exit the memory
no I'm done with this level there's
nothing what you try
they're very fast it's so fast it's
impossible to perceive them in Flight
which is why now and it's ever seen a
rabbit fly
that's pretty fast
pretty fast indeed
so I think I'm done with this level now
meaning that I can now challenge the
first boss
which I can do without flames
let's talk to Sheena because she's the
best character
why do I want to go to a land closer to
the sources instead of just going
straight to the sources
seems like a bed ready I think
or is the idea that the balloon cannot
go further than the next World I'm not
sure why
and Casino
and also if I'm flying to the next World
why am I stopping here
I mean hey
and where did Sheila come from she
didn't follow
this is a this is so strange
town in the lava with you so now I'm
pushing the enemies into lava
oh and now it got squished now it's
speed running stretch
that was pretty quick right
still need to find eggs and yeah
probably need to refuel the balloon oh
yeah
I forgot about that
so I need a new orb
foreign
becomes even more aggressive
and that's
and the surface has two hit points as
well so the last hit point now
I need lock him first
and that's that easy
I mean it's the first bus with all the
buses buses in this game are pretty easy
for some reason
they were really difficult in the second
game
when I started 20 minutes with one boss
oh
now the thing is you don't use the
balloon to get to the next World you
need a new flying contraption
that's the thing
rotate stick Germany anyway new world
new visit from the
bunny here she comes
hello bunny
yeah but you won't survive much longer
it's not a threat
let's kill some bunnies
so that was fun anyway as you go and
visits money bags because he oh wait I
should pick up some eggs first
did you know
okay that was sweet too easy Trixie
and did you know that there is a
flame ball power up is that how we would
call it but when you have that active
the adjective disappears
because otherwise you could just shoot
the eggy Thief
and then when you
want the power up
stops working
I guess that's a good way to describe it
the exit comebacks
don't kill the bunnies wait a minute I
can't use this power up
but I'm a bunny I'm allowed to kill
bunnies
that's that's that's how it works right
they make such a funny sound
and you shout into them
hello money bags oh I can't stand yellow
wait am I good friend with you
and then you call me a sake as well okay
more
cutscenes
I think you have to find your commanding
officer for that
hey what are those
so I didn't use them to escape
on that one
I mean you could still do that while you
wear cards but okay
well I'm not really a dragon you see
I just came here to rescue the dragons
for weeks
I guess that's the sound
the other one is a threat to your
fluffiness and they have smelly feet
apparently
Keith sounds hmm
but now I'm going to play as a
bad
so what moves do you have I can jump
I Can Fly
I can
zoom in in this view which I don't think
you have wait maybe you do use this
video at some point
I think I'm not not ever use this view I
rather use this View
so
and that's all I can do and the button
that so I can jump I can zoom in I can
drop bombs and which I have to use a lot
in this level and but I cannot shoot
this is uh he had to concept ammo he
used them for money bags and now he's
out of ammo that's how it works
okay let's see
yeah you're welcome
so the what I have to do
I must see
you can't destroy this
yeah and I need you to stay another way
okay now I got hit
you cannot shoot down this door
well I do need to get rid of the door to
proceed so I have to cheat a bit
no problem
I can just shoot down those doors and
now
oh you got through everything how
you're not supposed to proceed unless I
kill those enemies
it's sure sure now
I can use this thing and I can actually
get rid of these anyways I'm pretty sure
I think
okay
apparently not
but that worked hey why did my weight go
can I get up thank you and to destroyed
my weight somehow
okay so you cannot apparently use the
weight to
beat those enemies or something
yeah it works
I just managed to miss a last time
somehow there we go
now I can place these here without being
truly interrupted by some enemies
hit them up
more
calories and I'm in there but I can
sneak under it
there we go
I
[Music]
thought that's a death so let's see if I
can
use this command
why is the game sometimes anything else
for this that's not exactly the case
here that was the first step
this should be something like
something like that but I it doesn't
seem to work
okay
at this time I should be more careful
can you
can you stop
well and when it falls in the lava it
responds at least
in a thigh so it doesn't count wait
that's not how it works it's a video
game
I like that how does this work
wait how does that work
how did that work
that doesn't make it okay I'm going to
kill
okay I do have one more
again
how does that work
it does the falling sound when you place
them on there they're meant to play the
song so when I release them
which I guess I do release them but they
are placed directly onto something so
okay
over here they are missiles and
now
now they're really fun begins
let's see if I can do that without the
view
and it's hot it's hard to see where I I
dropped everything when I got hit okay I
guess I need to be a bit more careful
it should be somewhere like this yes
yeah I should probably have the second
knee
I can see what I'm doing
pretty much I have to go back
with so many gems
so I'm gonna stop their gems
let's kill these harmless enemies
enemies animals
Blues
I do need to
yeah let me pick that up you're kind of
in the way
let me pick up a
nice mix
so I need a butterfly so I need to use
a missile or whatever do you call this
and you can apparently not stock up on
you you have to release all of them wait
where did it again
to release all you have currently before
you can pick up anything oh now they
respond
okay this should be an enemy here
there we have you
okay can you stop following me so I can
okay can this can you also stop avoiding
these thank you
let's continue
I'm not really sure I'm supposed to get
this one
I guess that works
so many James
everywhere and checkpoint that sounds
good
but you'd have so many enemies so I need
that checkpoint
he works slower than he fly so it's good
to jump everywhere
okay
there is a place I do you need to drop
wait are you captured again because I
died
before I got a checkpoint that's why
okay
so and now I have to pick up more it
would be nice if they could spawn a
further back in the level as well
a lot though going back and forth
is that a short level so
now with these new bombs
not you I supposed to pick up that one
as well thank you
I can go down this hole
because I do think they are and oh don't
let any lava I want this turn around
there are enemies here too
but I think there are only two
good good
yeah and then I have to start to open
that thing a bit of a hotel
okay
he didn't even see me coming
our idea of those as well
should I really pick up all the gems
I do think I only need to pick up the
Miss Nissan's mortars is that what they
might be
one more time
and then I will be able to clear out the
starting area
Percy should be like one enemy
at least two baskets
one more should be enough
yeah
one basket there
one basket
and then there's that enemy
oh no there's a monster basket
but it's a perfect amount
take it that's all the gems
I hope
and although there is that flying
balloon I
I am about anything there too but that's
not a problem
no problem at all
I will pick up one more
and while I'm at it I can also pick up
that basket
I should be able to complete this level
100 with this resolution
I'll I'll show you
how to show me all
should be able to just do that yep
so this area is now cleared now I don't
need to go back here no more
points there are balloons in this room
too
don't know why they have balloons
one more balloon
yeah that was a weird place to stand
and the final balloon
and this area is now cleared as well
now I can continue
someone tried to shoot me
get more
at night it was the other one
tell you
perfect
pick that up
stop being so lazy
lazy one
two more things here
there we go dancing
all right
oh yeah and then there's this is much
easier because Nissans are closer but I
said
don't have to go back so for long to
pick them up so far so long that's not
the correct term
kind of yeah why they do they take the
such time to respond
just respond in a few seconds
seems to reasonable I think
I'll test on this
all those things I don't know the name
of
picking up some gems
and if you hold a bomb that means they
cannot land and therefore you can
obviously it's a light price
you cannot land if we cannot walk in the
free moves quickly
okay speed running
I think one Jam fell down
yeah of course it
so uh anything else here I think there
are some balloons
and a basket
and then
basket
and some more balloon I see
I hear this
thank you so there's some more
okay
and then there should be some gems on
top of these things
another balloon
I'm gonna pick up this first
these balloons are I need to hit the
balloon this one
there we go
how much do I have left
nope don't forget to change page so
about 51
more
chance that's not much
either so
I missed
I missed again
but I did did hit the other one
that was a success
or extra knife
you can apparently not destroy this
positives like an oversight
but yeah why would someone destroy
the jar with the
mortar
no one would ever do that
that one would be so ridiculous to not
use the simple missiles he has
so much easier to do
so and then she flies over here and I
get the
Ryan Lee the final egg of the level
and then
I just need some
don't know if I need more
although when I do talk to the last
well rather when I do free the last
hummingbird
I am forced into dialogue which will
remove the missiles on Waters
I have a game to play
and say yeah someone else and there's
nothing to destroy her kids
someone has suggested I should play that
if I'm going to play less known games
so 12 more gems that's not much I should
be able to do this
so yeah I have thought about doing that
I don't want to go through a bit more of
the games
take a good time in there okay so where
are the remaining ones
up in that cave no problem
yeah I think I want to clean it out half
the game
okay
wait where is it
oh there's other than me but
goodbye
so now it's a 10 missing
let's follows the orb
yeah it's a different part of the level
so I did miss something
probably a basket containing a pen
in a balloon
let's see is it probably balloon yeah
here it is this one contains of him
and there it is
100 complete without using missiles and
only mortars
although although
to be fair I did use the emissiles to
break down those doors because there's
no other way of doing it
it is a shame that the enemies cannot
destroy the doors because some enemies
can actually destroy some
obstructions that you would otherwise
destroy using other means
so it's a strange that he couldn't
destroy those walls
otherwise it would have been a perfect
run
you did it thank you
it took a while and it's not my favorite
level but it is nice to have that done
actually
I can feel feel happy about successfully
doing that
so
it's
a bit laggy but let's
it's doing hopefully it's running in at
least like it's stuttering a few times
but hopefully not
to an annoying degree
is quite smooth it's obviously sometimes
it started
so
okay okay look at look at these bunnies
they don't have arms wait they do have
arms I didn't see their arms
foreign
animation
stop running around
there we go yeah they have smelly feet
awfully smelly feet
they have so smelly feet that they even
made a sound of disgust
so cute I mean they are cute I should
replace them with pom-poms
that would be fun
a lot of small pom-poms there
kill
let's get it collect some gems here
[Music]
be so done with
the bun is cut in the way
I guess there is one thing to use not
kill father but that's not really a
challenge
I guess I don't know
Mingus
nothing else here
I should play icy Peak
ICP
I fly flow straight into the wall
okay this might be a level
I do have to use the flame once
we'll see
yeah do you have that inside yourself
now I didn't have needed that worked
genius move
I do think this contains Jets
yep
so this is going to be fun
because I should also
partly try to get this
yeah I need this duck
and that's not how it sounds great I
can't do it
sounds awful I wanted it to respawn but
apparently not
okay I'll come back for those later
okay why is it I'll get that
hold the game
your animal sounds are so cute
should be no problem
yeah that's why I want one of those
redeems to be making edible noises ah
gems
oh yeah can I do this
oh yeah I can nice nice
and then she died
and now this doesn't contain any chance
anymore
let's try to avoid them this time
similarly this one doesn't contain
anyhow
but just nicely I tried to I thought I
thought I was
far enough for me
[Music]
worth a try
you never know
okay I don't have anything to do with to
take this out with I cannot get through
that one
wait where are these back I thought I
got rid of those I thought it was
supposed to save with this checkpoint
yeah why are these back
anyway
picking up some gems
the birthday
yeah it was not yeah these are gone so
I'm not sure why some animes came back
and then pumpkin was a zombie and zombie
it's starting like more important
I don't even run anything in the
background give me just one moment
let's now head back yeah I'm still
trying to close the menu by pressing B I
don't have a b button that's the whole
point
so
yeah I cannot get through this
so yeah so I guess
the only way I have is that I can trick
one of those things behind the wall to
shoot at me
because they can apparently destroy that
wall
but yeah and these things on the eyes
could I use one of them no
sudden not they wanted to reach up here
would they
do I have to die and try again
I got a jam
well it's partly experiment thing
squished
apart from the dead it's partly
experimenting and partly athlete
doing the challenge I guess
okay now
okay they didn't respond so I cannot
figure that out
I guess there's one way to figure that
but I'm not sure if I can manage to get
it all the way over
no I couldn't
I went
oh yeah wait
no don't shoot me
shoot at me don't shoot me
uh
like halfway
okay
yeah they they don't reach the one
because he can shoot down the wall
if he stood closer
wait
so well I guess I just have to use Flame
it's closer right for them this doesn't
happen
let's pretend
oh come on
again one
no see there we go
they can do it
thank you for removing the wall
yeah like I wouldn't take that much of
that who was shot
I do need health
and the eggs Maynard
mayonnard
thank you
and then try to take this out without
falling down
would you perhaps try to take that out
wait what'd you do
what did you slide through
that's not how it's supposed to work
but again
Vikings
want Sparks or the orb in this case not
pick up gems that has
spawned from oh there was a checkpoint
I was going to get a checkpoint
because I'm probably going to die
yeah I don't think I can get him to
shoot
the wall
wait
he can maybe shoot this one
there we go
thank you you're such a nice person
[Music]
so now
why is it looking so weird
it probably looks normal so now I can
actually enter that area
I'd say my selection was pretty wait a
minute why would I under this area
I cannot defeat the enemies in that area
anyway so
what I opened it because I could kiss
thank you
and now you have to die no I didn't mean
to pick up
shouldn't this like
drinking each other
no I need a bird
yeah
exactly what I needed
so now I can take the last one
kind of a burrito oh hello bird you're
back
kind of a brutal way of doing that but
I don't have much of how to show it oh
but you can't do this as well but
apparently account you can do this as
well which isn't intended but
see
but you can't
and I think you could do that in
original twos it's more of an oversight
and I basically have kept that in
reignited as well
did I miss one
so tired no it was just us down that
looked like a gym
gems are stones
yeah moreheads thank you
this is one of those levels I have here
take a lot of damage damage
to
collected gems
I could paint on the back sister this
number of times
so here this will just be charging so
this I should be able to do
but of course
I do have to actually collide with the
xfa it tricked me but I got him anyway
Betty
and the second one
no I didn't see which one it took
not that way well I guess I have to take
that away
there it is
there we go and that's the second one
Scout
s and then there's a few more gems in
this level
in this area more
I should be able to get
well I guess that worked
oh no
further down
what's up then that's this yes
oh yeah now this is another path that's
not
it's over here I think
yeah here it is
that yellow green
active vortex
and over to this platform
and if I want to be safe I can just do
that
foreign
[Music]
landing on that thing
apparently I like the skill to learn
that scene
I guess that was another test how many
days has been now
strike
maybe that was the fourth step is that
second
return hub
cutscene but this is pre-rendered so
there's no pom-poms let's keep it
no cutscene
okay
here's a level
which I cannot access
because I cannot speak but I do have to
access level because
I mean
I can't finish the game without
accessing level
so give me The Rock
a stone
so I can shoot I think
because sadly even though it looks like
a platform there
it wouldn't even be high enough to get
up there anyway
as far as you can see there is no way to
reach that Target
so I have to cheat a bit
but it's more of a practicing
hmmings
so
um
how's it going
now I'm back to the previous
uh thing
apparently this should land
yeah there we go
we're after this shooting too many times
the kind of out of energy or something
squished uh I almost fell down the lava
and well I got squished again
I'm going to die I feel like
Gladys
I died
not because someone kill me I just feel
that jump
that's funny here and it's right
death Plus
because adding this
but that doesn't show up in the chat on
the screen
I tried to press the button
yo things are going good how about you
hello viola
nice to hear that things are great
I'm
yeah
as you said
yeah I think it's okay that's going
crazy
I fell down
but nice to see new people
yeah always
free to write whatever you want okay
well well within reason I guess
but yeah
with aside from the exceptions
uh feel free to basically write whatever
you want
because the other ones gives up after a
set month of shots to these
that it doesn't look like The Arrow you
know
I just have to ignore
and then they ignore me
and let's continue around here
so
you made this mod right looks so cute
yes thank you yes I made this
uh while I stole the bow from Nancy the
polar bear
open aside from
and yeah it's basically inspire's body
but I've done a lot of modifications
I'm pretty happy with
the result the mouse moments are a bit
weird in cutscenes but aside from that
it's
it's good I think I good enough
but glad you like it it is
available if if you do have the PC
version it's very simple test
add a file to it if you want
yes yes this is just searching good for
it or something
I should probably have a link to it on
the on my about page
how's your day it's
a fine woke up a bit late but
early enough to get everything in ready
to
to stream
and make sure everything worked these
times I didn't have to restart the game
so to exit the level I do have to shoot
these
so pretend I'm not using the flame
pretend is that you never stay
what a strange path so
thank you
so
but that still means that I can't still
enter it
but it kind of rules I follow
I use I would never use flame unless I'm
forced to
other advice it would be kind of boring
or something I don't know
so
let's talk to Hunter
no I actually wanted to channel
oh yeah do the tutorial
which is
not even beautiful
no oh it worked but that wasn't the
period
wait a minute what
wait I want to do
I'm not doing it the wrong way
I was meant to do it back flip
seriously what do you want
foreign
I think
yeah there we go I confusivity is Trump
I didn't really pay attention to what he
did
but anyway
it has been pretty quickly on that
whoa
yeah I can do two spins on that no
problem
no I need to do three spins
otherwise I think you said I needed 500
points but let's see I need to talk to
him yeah
that's the uh one-on-one for
oh that should have worked
I was so close to doing it as well
okay you can't do more than that okay
I need to keep track of my ladies
there we go
oh this actually tastes like that
I usually don't get that one to work
Twisted lemon
so awesome
oh yeah armor oh it's almost your
birthday cotton Appliance
and now I I was
going to
uh fail I was going to do some kind of
stream on that day
for original skateboard bunny crashing
like three times now
here we go that was an intentional crash
so there is a course record as well I
just want to beat it just to beat it
even though I did beat it but hunter
doesn't recognize that as a career so
yeah some kind of uh birthday stream I
guess
probably a long one
yeah
one two three four five
in a minute
I was supposed to do six of them
I count count
breaking skin yeah they just
split in half
and then you're radical the rabbits two
three four five six there we go that's
what I wanted
and I didn't want that but fine
okay I I want to see I should be able to
get like twenty thousand
it's like half a minute to duty
one two three four five six there we go
foreign
a little extra point from that barely
anything
I don't think I can do more than four of
these
two three four five six
but I want to break twenty thousand tops
a thousand because I haven't
done that before
oh
okay so I should be able to do five of
them but I want to try it again and this
is the only I wanted to
but uh at least want to break twenty
thousand so I can't do five there's
enough time to do that
no it's been in the wrong way
but I got more than
twenty thousand which was a girl so
I guess it is a success whereas
come on I never died twenty thousand
double the course record
yeah I have the course record
any stupid cheetah
you're cheating cheetah
I'm the most radical rabbit there is
okay it was nice doing that
twenty thousand six hundred and seventy
six I don't remember how much it was
but I cannot collect all the bones
because
I don't have a way to
shoot them down
since I don't
have
and I don't get any gems quite different
because Sergeant bird is out of rockets
that was a bit early
press should be able to get off the edge
like that yes okay shoot me
you miss me
again
and again
more of you
so many of you
but you shoot so slow
no you shoot the normal speed is just
you start shooting for some reason
right you are shot three times
did you have to four times I guess
he got that rest
standing still in the pair I guess the
flying isn't tying them out
distance should be
yeah I'm not going to get
there still collecting both in though I
cannot get them all I think that's uh as
most the most I can get
I guess I can go and like
collect some gems here
but I cannot do anything about it the
the wolf
because the wolf requires
spitting
and I don't have I have
yeah I found the ball here we go
now we can play catch with him again
that's the best I can do
even though I think technically not
speed I was sitting there
ignore it
because I'm a radical right
I don't think there's anything else on
this level I can do so I'll just return
him
it could be something I'm forgetting
we'll see if
foreign
people who play basically evening Lake
showing up and ask them maybe he's here
already he or she I don't know
um
maybe they're here already and
waiting for
waiting for the best opportunity to ask
me to do the challenge
I do kind of have if I'm going to
collect as many gems as possible I do to
have to do like half the challenge at
least
I'm sure everyone wants to do the full
challenge
and this level has black screen at the
start of it for a bit I don't know why
I don't remember them
for some reason I want to remember that
being a thing on the original
PlayStation as well
yeah I cannot charge these
I cannot add bash these
so they have to be unlit
okay
you oh wow what's what's that
it is safe
it is safer to jump through the water
into the swimming it even though jumping
in water should rad retract more prereas
because I wanted to get up on this so I
could fly over
oh yeah attacking that direction so
jumping did it out
okay now I'm getting a title everywhere
stop attacking me
wait where did you go
okay
I want it
but I guess I'm a attack that
uh uh
again like again
no
that was not what I wanted
trust me I didn't want to get attacked
I feel down
I should have done that
I had bash
are there any gems in here
no
and this one requires a key
I thought I attacked
by lighting are the candles you get to
do a challenge that challenge only
requires charging so I could do the
challenge
but I just cannot access the challenge
due to lack of flames
this is wow now there is a lot of
missing friends
for some reason
I don't even run anything in practice
this level so laggy
I mean the level could be more laggy
than not levels
I want to do that cannot can't you do
that if you do now apparently if you
shot jumps you cannot do a head bash
I haven't considered that
gems oh there are just here
not much but
some
wait where did it go oh there you are
busy
other
crash right into the wall
anyway
I'm on the back says guards
so anyway you can paint my bags
no you're a hiking poetry stinks
or
or maybe not
they're kind of cleansed off the area
yeah you can actually do this
stop doing that
now I'm
on the other side
okay don't fall in the water
it that's interesting here's the other
side of the door now I need to paint my
bags he doesn't need any more gyms
he has enough gems already
sure anyway
from here
I can get
up on the trees
yeah
and on top of the trees there is an egg
Frank
for some reason there is an egg on the
trees I guess they consider that a good
hiding spot
and now I had a key
which means I can get more Jets
over that now I finally that was close I
saw the pariah
trying to get what get active
now
jump up from the water little bunny
you're going to be eaten alive
oh 25
but there is a challenge another
challenge I can do is the Sheila
challenge
yeah I know about the lights sorry I
cannot do anything about that
wait I should talk to this person first
hello news
that means that nothing will be acting
good
which means
that I should be able to
I wanted that gym because I need gems
yeah it's very late to talk to you now
go around it
no apparently I can't stand on the edges
now I can't get back up here
and go to Sheila
hello Sheila
and here we go got a pretty simple
Challenge and luckily Sheila can kick
with both charge and Flame so I can do
the key
kangaroo
it sure is Kangaroo time
so cute she is a cute kangaroo
some reason is the stream is not
dropping frame since they
to itself
why is doing that I don't know
it's been running fine before
okay now what time was hitting this
let's do something here
oh I just said yep nothing else
okay first step remove the Styles pick
up the gems
what a nice Arrangements of the gems
emoji
I want that giant kangaroo plastic I
didn't want I also want a giant kangaroo
plushie I want like giant plushies of
every animal
every single animal
me too
I'm going to fill the bed with them
neither
more than a double bed
quadruple beds the whole bedroom should
just be a large bed
so now I cleaned out all the rocks
okay it's stuttering a little too much
now for some reason give me a moment
did it like
change I don't do great quality settings
here because it's really come too much
uh
I went
we'll see about that after this level
and see if it works
so step one
go over to this
what does it feel like Gina is walking
slower
oh there it is
um I think it was this one
and then I don't remember which it was
no it was the other one
oh no yes it was it was that one I
confuse them
do you have any giant Animal plushies I
do have
two pandas
and but they are more like
anthropomorphic
and
so
one is
140 and one is 120 very large
Queen
sorry squish this time early that means
I can't pass by
and then I can squish it down again
because
he's a little confused
then I don't remember who she once was
in the middle no it was that one
was the second time
so
so now I have everything in order
ah you can sit on its lap I mean I'm
bigger than they are but
so I mean they can sit on my lap
that is possible
so and then it's this one
foreign
that's cute I did that too
but yeah
I have to I should see if just
restarting the game a bit quicker songs
any awareness with the game
but yeah this is the last challenge I
have to do
yeah yeah
so the first mushroom I have to squish
be this one over here
pretty sure about that
no wait
it is none of this
I should just put this one
exactly
and then it should be this one
yep and then it's this one
and that's that
Michelle Michelle
very simple challenge
not much struggle
there's some hidden thing here I think
I don't remember where
maybe there isn't
just follow the orb
and where are you pointing oh it's that
that's the sacred place
no I remember somewhere behind
behind here
not that Rocky
wait a minute
all right what's this one
there you go
and then I do have even more plushies
but they are not sounds from morphic not
in the same way at least
money of different sizes
so no I mean you only told me that you
don't need to tell me twice
return home
but then a Pokemon plush is
I have the sink I don't think so
I do want
some
they're so cute
and now you should list all your classes
so I got this tip and for my pandas I
got like like half like atomorphic
chippy rabbits or something how we will
call it so let me just quickly start the
game and see if the substance we are the
stuttering thing
and because
it was kind of interesting to think like
that it shouldn't take too long
um
just double checking that everything is
correct there there you go
and then the startup came again
taste something to drink
ing is starting up yep it is okay can be
a bit slow
here we go
this loading
did you start streaming this year well
it was this year in
2nd of April to be specific
and this should be the seventh stream in
total so I'm very inexperienced
so let me get now the game is probably
started
and there we go that sounds great
let's continue and hopefully let's
stuttering it will be still stuttering
some when it's loading and stuff like
that
you're doing great thank you I'm
still very nervous about this and I'm
getting
more more and more used to things
I think it's a let's start right now
it's still stuttering some I still have
to do more the tweaks off off camera I
guess offstream
and
it's four levels now is the Bamboo
Terrace
but the
person offering challenges hasn't shared
that yet
so therefore I don't have the commit
Center challenge
oh how fitting because this year
you see here after rabbit and April is
Easter
wait wasn't Easter
maybe yeah maybe it was for the
oh yeah yeah it was like
early early
April
that is true it is so therefore
I can take that one out
but I can also take that one out and you
do that
by doing
it to be
three
not that you do this
no you don't do that
okay you do this
oh yeah yeah look at this
huh
oh no not like that
okay now I'm messing up
okay
your advice is very chill I'm her having
a swell time that's very nice to hear
I've been a bit
um
worried about my voice for several
reasons
I just I just want to get this admit
because it would be so fun
I can't see names
no I should probably give up
I'm dying I'm not scared enough for this
challenge
three hits I must have been hit more
than three times
wait wait no no I have to do this
because I have to risky the pandas I
don't I got no choice
and and since this is a possibility I
have to do this it is my challenge
come on yes
I did it
I actually managed to do it
no Flame
the way it was intended
definitely definitely intended to do
this right
now I can get rid of you out of the
unimark
Korea congratulations
thank you super cool it is really
it's really funny when I actually
managed to do it
the problem is I have to do it again
but I should pick up some help first
um
okay
and I can take out this bowl because I
don't need it I can well I can charge
them
yes yes I do understand it
so let's see
I didn't move out of the way enough
I mean this should be easy
okay
I need to start
like that
but that was the easy one it's that one
I need to get
so something more like this
not like that
I hit the panda if that counts
okay I I think I got
the correct position here ah
that was too high
okay more like that
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah it's good it's
good
no it's really low
too low
and this is the last one I have today
and then
there are no big ones having no I'm
still I'm still missing that up
I really have gotten it maybe
there you go yeah those are good good
height on it
and no
yeah that was that was good too high
still too high
Poor Little Panda
yeah I get the heat with uh
hair
okay this is good it's good I just need
it
ah I hit the pen again
it passed since long
I hit the panda twice
okay I'm getting better at getting
correct tapped on these
I said as I how it sounds too low
oh yeah yeah
I mean if you just
it would be fun if the person
shows up and see me trying this
then we can pretend I got all the
enemies required for the challenge this
way
they might run out of the rocket if only
come on come on come on it went through
the
what do you call it puzzle
and
foreign
ly after many many attempts I did it
and I'm actually going to be able to
complete this level without Flame
and that's kind of
that's
pretty neat
I was going to say chicken dance but
that's uh
I've had a name I haven't played the
game
I just can't think of the name at the
moment I wasn't planning to me to fly
air
if someone were to say the name of it
without to give me without context
and I would be able to say which game it
is from
but I cannot think of the name
myself at the moment
Chocobo
yes let's name it
so
more life
oh yeah there is stuff in the water as
well
so oh yeah that is just some nice let's
mix them up
I might need some extra life
's lives
never know because of these enemies
they have a long recovery time
which is good
honestly I just call them chickens too
from Texas
yeah they're kind of like kind of
chicken nugget here that chicken like I
mean it tastes like a yellow one already
I can't do this because
because it's so simple
I don't need you anymore
and there shouldn't be any
hey I didn't even look at you
I might actually be able to complete
this level to 100. now I'm not able to
complete this left 100 because
there's a fire section
let me just
aim myself now
hey
no you have to find out pretty low
I must stand on the edge or something
like that
this should this should be easy I just
need to find the correct position
now come on
there you go
but I don't think I can get that one
no it explains too early well I know
what it is for you
meaning that I had to get that one with
the other one I killed
so
but I cannot get 100 I'm still happy
with how many my energy to get so
and that I was able to get here without
staying
Polito is what I call them
[Music]
is that
just what you call them or
would that be the Spanish name for him
like I guess I can imagine them having
different themes in different languages
so
a yard of questions
a mysterious base
but let's activate the emergency Bridge
and imagine the Escape Bridge
yeah this imagines yeah you forgot about
the emergency thing that doesn't seem
like a good idea
I mean baby chick
the
chicken baby in Spanish
I expected it to be Spanish
oh I did that jump without falling down
for the ones
stop deceive
I got to see
now let's get the mystery jar
and then I think that's it for this
level
that was a fun name for the egg
Pee Wee
registration I mean both p and we
means the same thing not really a thing
you want to be called I think
there are so many strange names
like
dick
he wants me called dick
if people still name their children they
in English at least I mean
very strange because some some names do
kind of die out because people don't
want to name their children something
that's as a negative connotation
so
but as
it is possible at least depending where
you live of course but in like Sweden
250 crowns is about 25 Euro and you can
just request a name change and then you
can just change your own name if you
don't like whatever what you ever given
take a search for a shot don't know how
well they can just reach out because it
comes from Rich and then you change the
first consonant to dick the same how Bob
is short for Robert because you take Rob
and then you change the first letter to
Bob
it's a weird English nickname I think
and then some I know some people named
Dicky I mean at least Dicky sounds
fine I think
and if your name is Richard do you
really want to be called dick
spikes Arena now
she wouldn't be called Dick I mean for
many fishes
not even similar to my name
okay this boss
this part I can do it's just
and nicely done
this part I can do with your charging I
mean I cannot flame anything anyway
but after these two hits
I need to explain
otherwise the bus is undefeatable
like the onions will appear
and then I have to
play and you can only hit once
even though it's really long attack
any attempt to attack a second time does
not count
that sounded rude wait which part
all right let's just run into that one
I didn't pick that picked up there we go
positive heated pretty simple
Monique
money k
a level
100 level complete what kind of grammar
is that by the way
should it just be level 100 complete
or never complete hundred percent I
think that does in fact but 100 level
complete sounds weird
I guess they have written gems 3A 3380
the people calling people dick because
of the name I mean I mean it it evolves
from a nickname as the nickname
time
listen to me so it's not like they're
called dick
in a way to be rude
but yeah I mean
I could see
so
it's basically been there three hours
already
which was the time I intended to stream
so I'll just do a little more clean up
on this Homeworld and then I guess I'll
just
play the actual levels here
next Thursday
oh a frog died
that wasn't my intention
so
at least cleaning up this dry area
Ted
and then
can I reach that
I have to climb
climbing is so slow
that this is pretty simple
Hannah
so
I think that's on I
that's a good amount of
nice technically not three hours yet
I'll put it some more
so
and then I I'm gonna do something about
this stuttering for next time
I hope I'll get it sorted out
here we go
and there's an egg in here
Jonah
can't be nice to have an egg in your
stomach
but I'm happy to clear it out for you
a little panickling out there inside of
the
wait
another egg is here
is pink your favorite color yeah it
certainly is
still be
to be
all right all right a white rabbit
dressed in pink
and I do have a lot of pink themes on my
channel so I think that's that's a good
amount
pink
but Punk is a good color too
so
like
and last time
so let's go
and
take a quick look at
so I wanted to see if I could do one
more stream on Monday just for this week
since I don't have anything better till
Monday
so I wanted to try out some PS1 game and
to see if it works
and see how well that goes well that
stream goes
hopefully it goes well
sorry you did so well on this thing
thank you I'm happy
see once
quite smooth this time
a bit a bit of performance issues but I
hope I will
solve those until Thursday
so Monday I do want to try out a game
and I've tried to check with people to
see if they know about it which is
called C3 racing it is a racing game so
probably not for everyone
you can come and buy if you want
and then
Tuesday
will be more
a bunny game I should hopefully finish
the battle game it's not a long game but
three more hours she should hopefully be
enough
and then
finally
Thursday yeah would be more Inspire
three
so
how about
we go and raid another streamer who's
playing Pirates moments
which I've been watching a few times
she's actually from Ukraine
that could be interesting
ending of the Stream
let's see how it goes
so
thank you for streaming have a good rest
thank you for showing up
later yeah
so yeah I also want to follow oh thank
you for the follow
uh
Leo Levi TMNT I guess
everything's low case so it's hard to
see why the words are gripped
so if you want to follow along
this is moderate you're free today so
I let's see if this works yeah I just
have a basic a bunny
because that's my thing Mommy can I
Sally if you want to follow along you
can just copy that and paste it in the
chat as
it appears
yep it's a simple bunny emoji
everyone should have access to that I
hope to reach 50 followers someday and
then I think I need 100 streams and then
I should be able to have
a follower Emoji emotes that animal case
five of them I think I
that time will be later
I hope so
foreign
