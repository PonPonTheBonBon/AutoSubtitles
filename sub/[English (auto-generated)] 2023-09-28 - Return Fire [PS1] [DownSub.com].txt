return fire how late am I I'm very

late and bring up the

came on

screen I hope there we

go sorry for what of my slight lateness

hello girl hello yto hello Oran you no

you're not late CL just early at least I

wasn't like less than 1 minute late I'll

give myself

that rabbit

sted

so well I'm I'm just continuing playing

as this very peaceful tank in this level

called

breakout am I not breaking out of every

level the game is quite quiet sometimes

it has music like in this

area so I am

surrounded plant of R for the ram yeah

you had many RAM this

time so

I guess I go back to using the

helicopter oh oh oh I might need to

shoot out

those this isn't

good yep how about starting

over that's not quit that's

quit

Okay I didn't didn't press the quit

button

not wrong POS I that's the menu the game

is bit

silly okay one more time I need to shoot

down the turrets

first that was a

mistake don't the second or third time I

cancel like gives up and quit game did

warn you about breakout yeah I guess

there was a

breakout I guess I need to break out of

this place

okay

go hide

again I have to I have to be

careful think I count two so

far oh shoot

why is it

shooting hi

again there we

go

right at least the vehicle is very quick

at hiding there we

go

destroying the

tree getting of this

stuff of this

stuff oh no hide

hide okay I'm starting getting rid of

stuff

now at least you're on your pace

entrance infinite repair yeah yeah at

least there's no money involved then you

can repair your vehicle and infinite

number of

times that's just how this game

works I just need to get rid of the

remaining stuff

here we

go I think that's all of them no it's

still

there P ENT ber burrow yes it

is you're correct about

that

I'm going to

destroy this stuff don't need to but

it's fine

okay going to

destroy no I didn't want to destroy the

one peaceful tank is

free

yay I'm I'm so

peaceful I'm removing the

towers oh thank you for removing the

trees for

me here we

go

uh I'm the Peacekeeper I keep the peace

here no

shooting

I can shoot this thing once

more this is so much

shooting oh no I'm out of

ammo get out of

here been shooting too

much

so yeah that looks better let's get rid

of some mines towers are not peaceful

peaceful tank is not

happy wow that was a late

post wait what what do you

mean I mean I've been kind of posting

one

go I've been kind of posting whenever I

before I go live you told me you were

streaming I mean that's on

you I should probably test this

mode it's probably easier for a

helicopter yeah I don't know why this

would tell you so

late

okay this is actually not how I imagine

it working

but it's probably fine for a

helicopter

okay that was actually not there's

another helicopter yeah there is just

how you want to steer it it's basically

do you want to press up to move forward

or you want to press up to move up on

the map I did not expect it to turn the

vehicle I mean sure it turns the the

other vehicles but that at least makes

sense but I was hoping that up would

strafe it up regardless of which

direction it's facing in but it did not

do as I wanted it to do Let's ignore

that

mode rescue the

cat

helicopter why you afraid of riding

helicopter by the

way are you allergic to helicopters have

you sworn

on sworn to never right

helicopter are you afraid afraid of the

truth of the hel helicop and

P I can write helicopter but that's the

CH what's the difference between a

helicopter and

helicopter okay one more place then I

wasted all helicopters that's going

to how I do

this

hello Tower I missed you you're safe

this

time my aim is not think that good where

is the here are the

islands the

ls move on move on move on W

absolutely no difference I just made up

the word hel Chopper by Comm

hel Chopper and

Chopper wait

what they word hel Chopper and

Chopper yes if you combine the words hel

Chopper and Chopper you get hel

Chopper or you get hel Chopper

Chopper I meant helicopter

in whoops yes

yes get off the way building I need to

shoot this

time no no stupid

mind think I need

hyr ah there we go do you know what the

difference between helicopter

and Cyro copter or chiropter I don't

know close

enough come on there we

go

that's how D

it like that's a safe way of removing

mines

K chapter doesn't have power on the top

R okay say I have no no experience with

this

stuff oh someone is shooting me oh oh

there's a whole whole lot of towers

here to

way there we

go now it's safer let's remove this mine

too close enough there we go close

enough and let's go PR

veh so get rotation

Force to the top RoR from forward speed

where helicopter has engine rotating it

okay I mean that's interesting

okay go so just

hopefully find the

flag in the area to the

east if the FL isn't there I will be

sad

but we'll

see no one like that push

anyway thank you Tyler can I shoot you

from

here

yes

happy to get rid of

you I don't have to worry about

you go oh no I'm

dying

already okay you asked

for I guess you asked for to

indirectly

and you

to there you

go took so much

damage I don't like here

building there we

go moving back home to safety

just

destroying

buildings everything looks fine on

stream good good I'm still slightly

annoyed by the why does it do

this wait

wait so like this is full size of the

video why can't I modify it

and then I scale it down so it fits on

stream

like this oh now it's now it's fine okay

I don't know what happened

before I when it left like a one pixel

game for some

reason

that that slightly annoyed

me yeah we see if the

uh if the flag is in here first hello

teres nice to meet

you let me a see

oh you're shooting

me nope no flag there oh now I need to

be

sad you're not

helping

well I guess I just have to move to the

next

place

and

find did I I think there's two places

left so much work so much destruction

and there was no flly

there oh

well well I'm about to go and fill up

the tank repair the tank and put on

more

anti-tank stuff so there's uh the two

places to the left

left the tank has been

tanked okay get rid of this way too many

mines

go do not like the amount of Mines there

are

here and you can stop shooting

me me

through

go and the tank stuff

yep I me I'm pretty sure these these

missiles are quite paner

penetrating now laugh I said

penetrating because that's the humor

here and I have and I'm all for that

kind of

humor

down oh no I'm missing the

Tower the tower is not even trying

to

building wanted me to shoot you

down oh there it

is the flag has been

found don't shoot me don't shoot

me

no

no but did they clear away for the

Jeep

penetrating e

penetrating oh what the

money they can of can't be since is was

your vehicle would be blown up from the

first use oh oh yeah because that's how

it works

right

and you cannot have anti-air missiles or

anything because if you if you shoot one

of those Miss missiles they will blow up

because you're shooting them in the

air like you shoot you have the missile

going through the air and they are

anti-air so they can't go through the

air so they will

explode how it

[Music]

works

whoa I did

it almost run into that mine but it's no

worries wa I did

[Music]

it we lost a few helicopters we lost a

few heavy armored vehicles but

what what's

uh what's the few life

doesn't worth when

[Music]

you get the

flag

and

move

anyway Emperor phe bu look the password

also contains a

B I am a bunny yes you are seeing that

correct

I hope I'm a good bunny so we'll move

over to X

Factor and here I'm playing a very retro

game from very long time

ago every man who fights me deserves

death well I'm no man so I can fight you

and do not deserve this that's how it

works right H this one is bit

interesting h

tank can sustain heat from heat Warhead

but if it hits anything but front armor

that would would be heavy

damage I gu makes

sense my jeans will breed

Warriors I say good luck on

that how many warriors have you breed so

far oh no I'm under attack already stop

shooting

me okay I'm trying to land

here but is a bit

tricky you miss me that was close though

okay looks like I have to take out some

Towers

again

stupid Tower is attacking

me oh taking the wall that was not the

one I was trying to go

for there we go that's the

tower stop attacking me what have I done

he attack me

first so let's get rid of this

one then we get rid of reach more Towers

I did not get rid of that Tower oh no

I'm

dead that

mistake mistakes were

made so can I leave with the helicopter

now yes now it's

safe so

stop shooting me oh just trying to get

out of

here oh no my hel is so damage

already oh I'm missing

everything

okay that did not go as

planned okay uh one more

time I wish the helicopter could be a

bit quicker on start up

this

there we go get of some of

those oh

no that's not what I

wanted okay this might be a bit more

difficult than I thought

I need to be a bit more

careful one hit the

ground miss

me so

moving too far

out okay being careful

here I say as a flow flying into my

sign

[Music]

okay I keep missing

them there we

go it's random Night Spikes does not

help I didn't sustain quite the damage

though

[Music]

heat Morhead on contact shs high

velocity copper stream for

oh that sounds

neat

not missing everything

again typical of

me and don't shoot

me

I'm going to I'm coming here

to deliver a

message oh no I flew into

that oh destroy the

[Music]

things no okay ah

I make weird

noises

okay I did damage but

not not as much as I

[Music]

[Music]

hoped is this still the braing no no

this is X

Factor oh hel Chopper new level all the

Helo with store

exactly exactly

exactly got that

great go

enough

those all of is almost

destroyed why do I keep missing

[Music]

them why I haven't hit it once before

well that ruin everything oh how well I

guess I went back home then keeps still

missing

them is here some target

[Music]

[Music]

practice now again this is not going as

well as I

hoped I have not even destroyed a single

place where flags are

held I'm trying to press the back button

but you don't back after the map with

the back

button

some target

practice

oh okay this is not

working this is this is not working well

I'm not good with the

helicopter he see me

failing Don't Shoot

Me

there we

go now I'm destroying

them look at

that I'm doing

good

any

encouragement whoa thank you for the

cement but I still took heav damage

so come on come on there we

go

swim suit in a battle that sure will

distract the

opponent battle like Tak oh

my is it a latex latex

it there go that's some good practice

come

on there we

go and then when destroy the other one

it's not going to even contain a flag

so

yep okay can ignore this place

then all that working it wasn't even a

[Music]

plan come

on yeah it should definitely not be

thisp about Landing

no one would expect a bikini clad bunny

to be dangerous although I'm not wearing

a bikini to be

fine but yeah with the with the new

model and then you can redeem the

bikini that would

be that would be distracting for

[Music]

them

oh

no am I even going the right

way but I'm going left

so can

I can you stop

that

oh well I guess I'll have to move in

with the tank

instead it's a turn for sci-fi armors

that are seen

as AF and often don't have armor plates

I

see

bics I still think

it's could be quite a distracting

outfit depending on who you're facing

off against

so then might

work in your

favor stop shooting

me

go need to turn

around do some clean up while I'm moving

back how do you keep shooting me that's

pretty

rude

let's with tank

rude

yep pretty

dud destroy it

even get over there what I'm trying to

get

through

yeah this is not a good way of dealing

no I got stuck on a

bush Okay let's let's be more careful

and not so

Hasty go get rid of

that moving in here here we got some

more

Towers good

get

that that

one I have more here to get rid

of hey what did that tree do to you

stupid Tower it was a protected tree it

was inside the walls and everything and

then you shut it down

un

trumped

oh you're not making it

easy with my let get R of a bit of this

so it's easier to move around

here

[Music]

out the

F there

you so I have a bit bit more to go but

at least the two flag buildings are

together

there yeah it was one shot from destroy

that one and run out of

ammo traveling around in my armored

vehicle just wearing a swim suit cuz who

needs something

else and that's just a swim seat if you

were

rning and nothing

else oh you shut down the

tree how how dare

you I get it

stuck okay can you please stop shooting

me oops that was

that

see are you unimpressed by

that okay this is not going

well

well okay let's just it get rid of

everything

everything must be

gone can't read

okay take sustain too much

damage yeah out to F

too moving back home wa a little ammo

this game is very creative to use

classical music as a free Andes well

to yeah I think

they it's a good attempt

yeah they should have a bit for more

music track considering they're using

free resources they could certainly add

a bit

more and they should also consider

balancing out the music more

overall because some songs are very very

quiet

I can understand original composition is

quiet in certain parts H but that makes

perfect sense if you're sitting quietly

in a whole uh uh what do you call

it Arena music hall or something if

you're sitting quietly in there you can

play quietly and then you can increase

the volume as the song goes

on no oh and that's perfectly fine does

not work in a video

game okay I'm I'm failing

this and I know every one of these

tracks They are used in S 3 wait didn't

say there was in multiple different

theater I didn't know that I think Music

Hall is Right theater Hall

maybe Hall of some

sort eh yeah

like this song is not the quietest the

heavy armored vehicle has quiet

music at the start and it it can get

kind of loud towards the end of the song

but yeah they really need to balance it

out

no let me

see okay I need to be more

careful feel like they didn't have music

engineer person on board yeah they had

nothing at there for like

that they just use it as is kind of like

some YouTubers do they just they make

the video they just want to feature a

clip with audio and then just drop it in

the video file just let the audio levels

be as they were originally and it just

is

terrible the audio levels are all over

the place no balancing at

all someone is crib it as when you're

watching these kinds of videos you must

be a

DJ

constantly moving the knobs or whatever

is like allio

levels the person descri and I it it

sounded better when a person described

it

okay no I'm getting

stuck I'm going to clear this off

because I'm getting stuck in

stuff

this we

go

okay there's a mine there I need to be

mindful

no and one shot hit that thing but not

enough to shoot down the

tree

on you need to be careful

what you let penetrate you yeah I'm

letting too many bullets penetrate me

leaking

wait you're licking nothing with sugar

behind and then getting very frustrated

about missing the

sugar Oh wrong what you don't say then

licking the sugar and then getting

hyperactive

I guess I need

D kind of like a hyperactive pon pon

emote that actually shows more of a

hyperactive

expression

go quickly move through here don't mind

me hey I said don't mind

me

through tow is not

listening almost like they're automatic

oh you shut down the protect the

tree diid towers you're going to be

punished for that me you're going to be

oh apparently you did not get

punished look how H she is that that's

the most

hyperactive defer it has ever

been let's see I'm shooting

something destroying every

tree it's going destroy n c moves

through oh now got

stuck oh getting stuck at another

building there you

go yeah but the flag is not going to be

up there

anyway get

annoyed look how high she is who need

trees anyway yeah it's not like we human

use them or

anything

game is don't use trees for

anything it's pretty clear up there so I

need to go move up all the way there and

then I need to somehow break into the

base up there and hopefully the flag is

up there otherwise that's going to be

quite

annoying oh full volume

again always getting surprised by the

music come on

so uh so it's much easier to move

through here after everything is

cleared

so and then there are these things

yeah oh double wall I me I should have

seen that on the

map didn't really pay attention to

that guess I just have to penetrate

twice as much

right time to move

home get out of the

[Music]

way okay I do want to get rid of you

because you try to shoot me every time I

go through here I guess you too oh

no oh no that was

close

two clars for

Comfort we have to move so long can we

can we build a new base somewhere a

different place to move up

from so I'm almost broken in there so

very

close

so one moving up north again at least

that less of these Str Sho me now so

yeah I know it's safe to most of them

here

without those rude things trying to

shoot

me enough

that now let's see how do I deal with

these

now N I shut down

one

come on trees get out of the way trying

to shoot

enemy

well here suppos to

check I know the uh s timers

[Music]

over good thing you take care of

me un like these

towers trying to do the

opposite I get to other building yes

right it does not exist in

here out of

ammo out of

munition well like of G

bad

when then there are just two more places

the flag can be

at oh and I only got a single tank to do

all this we luckily infinite repairs

but but but

still

yeah this isn't going to be

fun this is going to be a

strugle

okay

that was way too

much infinite repairs we got to travel

along way yeah

exactly to travel all the way back to

base every

time okay I don't exactly have to deal

with this

but it does make it a bit easier oh Sho

to not

war going around there okay dying again

now it should

Chace go go go

so I think I think

I creating a passage for me

now the surprising

music

I'm missing the

to him

count

I'm getting a be annoyed by

you don't need to take this out

but I'm not that good at aiming

apparently keep making

things so I think I should be able to

pass through that and nothing

interesting happened at work last night

okay

well the usual day

then

us shall boring day at

work so about

that just passing through don't mind me

accidentally shooting a hospital that

just happens

okay

I didn't intentionally shoot the

hospital that just

happened get through

here taking too much damage there's a

mine

there

okay too much garbage

here stupid wall let me pass through

here thank

you oh no this is going to

annoying tried to avoid it that didn't

work as

plan okay it's actually survived that

luckily it's weak but I could go down a

be evil land mine and usually when

something interesting has happen it's

typically something that almost injures

or kills

me

oh well good nothing interesting

happened then so you didn't have

to be close to

injury close to injur I mean like didn't

get

injured you right another day I was

close should not done

that how am I missing so many Tre trees

everywhere I keep missing

here oh I have a

teammate

of

that the tower is secret on my side

shooting down friendly

[Music]

Towers oh

no no I I ran into that tree

that was stupid of

me like when I 4 piece of metal out the

train struck my leg that would felt good

but would be nice yeah well let's

go there's no human no idea no reason

for me to try this

but

but I can

try oh look

destruction follow of the trail of

Destruction nice

spikes oh no

mines

oh no this isn't going to

work oh well I messed up so much time

wasted so much time

wasted so

much

y destroy

everything okay I'm moving I'm

moving

appar I can't get

down destroy everything because you're a

peaceful tank exactly sports that sounds

good should didn't sign

it

bunny tummy

yes and I

wi and I want to add some

TS robit

THS destroy it I want

to head pets this should be head

pets some robs what what else would it

be

there you

go I'm moving in they moving

out

okay now I just need to get through

here Mark the

base head pads TS so shoulder massage is

that

something

I want see what I can do with

the yeah if I do like one hand the hand

will be

animated it can do a

different hand

positions oh sorry sorry I went into the

danger

zone

hi I'm

hiding

okay highway to T danger Z they right

into the danger zone but I don't want to

be in the danger

zone I want to get out of the danger

zone

destruction de

construction

well I'm getting close to that base

slowly no it's not when that song plays

on R my car just sticks to the floor I

have no idea why why I cost it or was

cause hit but it just does that sounds

dangerous I was

like should not ride with you in that

song please or I have to change the song

as soon as it's

start stop shooting me have I

done

[Music]

go some tree struction

[Music]

here get on my wa stupid

trees

TR to get through

here

boom destroy more and more getting more

and more straight line towards

the

so almost

infiled almost at the

base just can see what they're hiding

there ring up your engine listen to the

Hing moan moan of the car metal under

tension begging you to touch and

go highway to the

change that's we know the danger zone is

the D Danish German Zone

okay let me pass through

here

down the

tree through

there

destroying everything how much

left so I should

probably try to go to

the out there sign of the

on the west side going up

north and attacking from there I think

that sounds like a good

idea some Min in

there

all right here we

go don't Sho

one yeah that's another Tower

down many of them going

down

there's one more

hit I guess I should have uh you know

destroyed all the Jeeps at that previous

attempt just to see what happens with

the proper game

away oh

no

no how

rude not seen such a rudess

before know

what considering how much I've shut down

I should probably M with time you got to

start to Hur from the beginning will

just pretend that

happen

when well

well since I've shut down so much of

that easier to move tank at this

point F being honest sing even in this

this what H this thing oh not honest

thing I thought you said I was

honest um

very p is is hot even in the

desert I mean hot things I mean if

fonton is already hot you put Fon in the

desert F will be

hotter I I guess technically if you know

if Pon

pom takes off more clothes to keep cool

you

know pretty sure some people would find

that

hot I'm going to hide behind this thing

here no

flag well don't destroy my

shield oh

no get out of

here no

flag there we go so much destruction no

flag well

that was

dangerous so much

destruction well well well ponon is

definitely honest when she tells you

she's just a peaceful tank she isn't

lying she's a peaceful tank exactly and

there's no lies

here should I no probably not going to

be well you know

what I might be able to mve with a tank

to this

Southeast because I might be able to

attack

those

oh

misty sorry sorry

Misty I probably took much more damage

than I should

have no

no move out the way stupid

helicopter there flag what there is no

flag not a single flag anyway oh no I've

been I've been Li

to I think if you bre the past tense the

fing a flag there was no

flag cuz right now it says there is no

flag though I don't think that would be

correct cuz there is a flag there was

just no flag

there I think there's a slight

difference in implication I could be

wrong though

you this in present tense I mean yeah if

there is no flag which

like if we move out and I ask like wait

why are you moving up from there well

there is no flag

okay that was the place I was supposed

to

be no that was a bad

idea

this isn't going up

planned okay

this well it's not like I'm going to be

able to use the helicopter for anything

else in this level so let's waste

another

one yeah I'm 100

pie I haven't learned

yet yeah that's why I'm like not super

fan of learning

sentences sometimes it feel

like old people talk about this learn

sentences so you can use those sentences

but sure but that's very very specific

sentence you have to learn and and

then and then I can say those specific

things but what if I want need to say

something

else

like like I think I think I think it's

both that oh I just want to learn

sentences and I just want to learn

useful sentence I think I think those

it's like those two arguments together

that okay so you just basically want to

learn sentences that you is going to use

but so you don't want to learn any

grammar or any words meanings anything

you just want to learn this sentence

means this

thing how the sentence work what the

words mean doesn't care about

[Music]

that that's like this feeling I get from

it okay with my

final no too far too far come on yes I

will cam cast in building

that means that the flag can only be in

the top left so I canot manage to do

what I wanted to

do

so the same thing again

then well you learn basic sentences then

you learn how to swap words those then

add more things like claes and yeah yeah

I mean

yeah I don't mind to learn

like words mean what what the the words

mean what the uh

what the how the word

changes like I think I think dingo needs

a like lesson

in

practicing just

the uh noun genders of

words like you get a list of words and

then you apply which gender the word

should have H kassi

yeah I mean do you have at Le in German

kind of uh learn a gender thing because

you kind

of take out the gender and then you

spell out the word which I don't really

get why can't you just spell out the

gender while you're spelling out the

word but no you're not allowed to do

that you must be C gender from The

Chosen genders I think on the yep if put

on the web version if you spell out the

gender the the

article uh so you don't pick a gender

pick an article that matches the gender

in question but uh so when you when you

pick on the web version when you type

out the full article it will pick that

one from the

list for

you shame the mobile version doesn't do

that polish now

easy you say so I have no nothing say

about that but and it would also be

useful to have like here's a

word write out every grammatical form of

the word or like the relevant one like

in Swedish you will do like singular

plural both indefinite and definite and

then you can have have like

definite

genitive I mean I guess you could do

indefinite genitive

too considering I was like yeah I was

think maybe don't have to do every form

but I think feel like six of the eight

forms in Swedish are

useful but at that point if you're using

six out of eight you could do

all basically doing basically everyone

already

so why

not or like one thing I did in school

which duing doesn't do and I think I

don't know learning the way they learn

from school seems like a good idea when

you learn pronouns they basically list

every pronoun if the language has a you

know similar pronoun system that in that

case it works otherwise you might have

to do some compromises but if you're

learning Swedish uh English is like the

pronounce still works the same you have

a set of you have a singular

plural and then you have first second

third person and the third person

singular have a

gender biological gender and con

masculine in e or o neutr in a

or feminine as soon as I can to you

about Swedish learning at some point

yeah if you are curious um as I

mentioned I don't know if you heard it

um I want to do a well a let's play I

guess you could say a stream um uh with

uh playing Spyro in Swedish and the

stream will be in English as usual but

we are learning Swedish is for Swedish

Learners we look at the words that are

used in the game

translate things explain how certain

things people are free to ask any

questions and uh getting the hang of

Swedish of course there's no like I

can't judge your pronunciation and stuff

that like that only spelling but it's a

start pronunciation isn't really

the like it's a good idea have a grasp

of the pronunciation as you're learning

language h of

course but just getting the words and

grammar is also quite good that's still

a big

deal language

learning me there you

go I'm going too far long with these

office okay a lot of back and forth but

at least the flags are top left now I

mean

Northwest and the level names in Spyro

are basically the same as they're

basically literally translated from

English there there are a few that

actually different and those can also be

quite

interesting so most of the time you

could just guess that well the Swedish

name of the level is the same as the

English name of level there are slight

differences on the

like so you can't completely rely on

that we have a new follow

Cy hello pon pon hello

kfki thank you for showing thank you for

following it's an honor being followed

by

I'm Miss

tanking I thought you were following

already I didn't real I haven't

before

well thank you we're

having some Coy fun

here we do stuff

like at this point I'm

just talking about random stuff playing

old games

from before

2000s cute

eh oops cute

C I think I would assume it looks like

the RAC is

seem oops I shot the

tank it

happens so you have adorable

emotes

no the radar says that so that's like a

no I'm

ding okay let's get rid of you

go oh no get me out of f I'm getting

attacked every from

everywhere thank you your stuff

is thank

you I did you draw my own have you drawn

your own I haven't I mean I could check

if you have credited someone I have

credited myself on my emot to make it

clear that I am the one who made

him that's the that's not the artist Ty

right

no yep oh stream

time yeah there we go that is the sign

there

on on the

tong wave hand that's what they

used I have a wave

too it's not animated beat pwn yes say

the sign p p on this just to make it

clear you

know because some sometimes designer is

not because yeah you can't tag a

designer if they don't have a Twitch

account

I wish you could

like if they don't have a Twitch account

that you could link to one

of established websites like

Twitter maybe devant

art and then they have

like icon from the website something

telling you that this

person this is their Twitter account

being credited it's an idea

anyway

but Beach Bunny

yeah Beach

Pond they have

some cute

outfits some do find them more than cute

but I find this ceric Kate

get have the tree I'm

stuck oh no there's a m there wait was

there m there last

time uh or are the mines

random when I need now wait I have very

little health I should not engage in

combat

get rid of this trash I'm trying to get

through

here can't pet bunny time is through

that swimsuit I mean I mean you could

swimsuits are usually not that sick

so you can pet a bunny time through a

suit of armor it counts okay no a suit

of armor I would disagree

that's at that point you're petting the

AR armor not not the B B I have male

armor

o do you have female armor

too you want feel the software no not

your armor now to the swimsuit you

should be able to Feel

Like H this they

defer at least like partially he not

like not as great as direct contact of

course it should still be it should be

like soft and and so

still let's get of that hey I want to

get rid of you I to Tre

defend K armor well that's an idea for

pon pon to wear uh I do have a list of

outfits

that I should make for pon pon

and and a suit of armor and a bikini

armor those are some

ideas female armor sure it yeah

D

go no that was that was silly of me to

do I still got

one Al out bikini armor yes H just put

it on the list on the

Discord

through that as I make outfits and like

make a proper list and check it off

making them as I prefer making them but

you know if you really want that out

tocl you can always encourage me with

funs I prefer she is proper armor m h

underneath a circuit I mean sure I mean

there that kind of meant like like a

proper set of armor and then like a

bikini

armor c

b

oh round for okay this isn't going great

no where are you coming

from is manad because I I'm attacking

oops now I don't have any heavy Vehicles

anymore now you can cry but I still have

tanks

so let's use the

tank which are

quicker which I guess is more

appropriate now since I have to move so

far so I can get up

there and then I have to get a jeep

through all this

stuff I don't like that you are here

there we

go and I jeep through all

this yeah probably have to remove this

one stop shooting

well he still doing the the

puns I'm try

not Sho that's in

here here we

go okay take heavy damage from

that oh mine okay let's just get rid of

you

okay the tank will probably not survive

on

mine

so who's on the treat thank

you there we go now it should be easy

for the Jeep to go through here

hopefully only I can remove the

stones yeah lady C

as

Bo yeah yeah yeah you know extra room

for you boa this is a long map I know

specialist I had

restarted

oh

so there's not much

left let's do

some aggressive

driving let's let's move in

I still haven't reached the end of the

game yet there's not too much left

though x marks the spot there's going to

be booty there well pon pon has her base

there so I guess you'll so as long as

ponon is at home you'll find some

booty did three come

on

no they Sho down the Ws for

me Tre the

way go

so I basically just need to clear out

this

area so I can move in with the

Jeep

[Music]

flag how do you say that is wiish I

don't trust my I okay

half deep

time

[Music]

[Music]

the flag that's what a green light on

the dashboard

still have the tank just in case I have

two tanks

even be safe to enter here

no can at the

stone I don't know past tense in

Swedish know the word find what is do

[Music]

easier is the same

minutes plus the time it I spent and

then

time

how dare

they how dare they take away my

vehicles I will show

you we go make it easy to get across

only two of each this time well I do

have three Jeep if that's

counts

yeah the budget starting to get

low I'm wa I'm wasting too many vehicles

unnecessarily to releas the

man why you so hangry to me I didn't

destroy the

building

having to replace so many vehicles yep

and all the all the repairs

too

come no I'm

stuck

okay let's get some

munition we

go Just Landing them from these people I

will give them

back trust me that's one thing I

definitely will do I will I will hand

them

over

here you go here's your

missiles there we

go let's see is the flag here

anyway he might play was there should

have left that

one anyway moving

on oh

more well I didn't mean to shoot the

door cu the door is getting destroyed

anyway

oh get out of my tower

well time to move home

again having especially trying to see if

tanks can swim o they can yeah yeah when

I do the fast travel back

home yeah they couldn't float

that's

tanks and and taking down trees

with okay with missiles instead of just

sending someone

out

so well I guess I'll continue in

checking those two Bings as

one oh I guarantee the eny will have

their back

yep they sure got it

back as

promised and obviously as part of

Landing the stuff I'm going to use it

and then you get it back used because

that's otherwise it wouldn't be a point

for me Landing it in the first

SP yes they did I'm sure they're happy

to have it back something s tells me

they are not

happy come on come on come on that was

close that was

close that was really

close there you

go I took like two pixel radius of

damage cuz that's how this game works

when it comes to

HP when moving

on another M

there oh someone's trying to shoot

me someone else TR sh

me

trying

to oh someone didn't manage to hit

me well hate this War I think it's been

War for quite a while

now well let's

see clearing off this area a bit this FL

isn't going to be here anyway

so let's not just waste too much time

how do our

best access these maybe through the wall

here let's remove the

wall and check the

building oh no flag what a

surprise thank you for

help

and then I check the other

building I'm stuck again no

flag well I guess I'll just move

home and check where else I should go

then I check three buildings now that's

quite a

lot

and a swing timer is over since long

ago no one said because they like seeing

p p swi he wants the pony pony they want

their point

worth oh

ads

come on shoot

it

so oh yeah

yeah if I go through that base I'm going

to access another

place and then I probably have to move

whole my enemy forgot about that

place the F in and flager have

nope destroy

everything so I have to go through the

first base here the first armored place

with a flag with a flag building that

did not contain a

plank but does contain a lot of towers

shooting me

whoops accidentally moves forward when I

didn't want

to get me out of

here this seems

peaceful go remove some trees so I can

move

around it's going to be like

this well

well

right

good I

no okay vehicle is almost

destroyed let's get out of

here

[Music]

just need a bit more kind of run running

low let's get through

here even though it was already an

opening I just made a new one just being

random well you're good at being

random out of

Amo well I did not access that flag

building

so not the success I was hoping

for

but I might not need to move in with the

armored

vehicle because I could probably use a

helicopter out of

shame I should use one of your armored

vehicle that

never

[Music]

one of the good good

[Music]

ones stop shooting

me no

[Music]

respect shut a lot of stuff but not the

this stuff if I want to

shoot come on come on come

on

okay that did not go as planned yeah I

probably can't use a

helicopter well let's try again I don't

have any helicop no need for these

helicopters CER more you'll give it back

shortly can I Land one of their

helicopters too I would likely give it

back no respect no respect at

all I miss

that the danger reference

here that

mine there we

go oh thank you for destroying the

building for me uh one

[Music]

hit I don't need to destroy this one but

know I want to destroy

[Music]

it where is the

[Music]

um oh it's down

here oh no shooting

me

no not not the thing I wanted to

destroy oh well I guess I'll just move

in with this

again but how am I supposed to get

there the map isn't even showing me

shallow

water this is going to be annoying

[Music]

well yeah come move down

own

Island so I have to take this

bridge oh there we go

there we go where am I supposed to go

then

okay get treat second I can moves

baret or

sandwich

stuff in way get rid of these

buildings I didn't me

yes for the

win okay here it

comes you don't like me you

see there we go

but not

a I guess destroying this whole base was

completely E I can't get through here

anyway I have to go through here

anyway guess I have to go through

here I nope

of course

not oh

no no don't miss the towers no I thought

I had more left than

that that wasn't my

intention but it's pretty clear

now yeah this is going to be one of

those annoying

levels I got to destroy last three

otherwise I'm going to be

by I know it's by its

existence

okay I'll take

it go go

go I sure have to go I can't go because

there's a w in

me

WS always getting in the

way

thank you I appreciate the help please

stop shooting

me

okay there are no

no nothing in there but want to get rid

of that

just doesn't sh oh here's more

bit late

reaction but if there's a wall makeer

the way I'll make an

opening not much oh shut both at the

same

time it's not really a

door

yeah Bic have Sho that once

more oh no oh no they're everywhere oh

no oh no no no I'm dying I'm

dying okay I actually survive

that

oh no there's there's a to

there and I was s supposed to kill there

anyway

so Retreat

yes doing that a bit dangerously

but I managed to

survive a f yeah he's in a

f i can't to him he's not even alarm

going

go so I moved so far so far so far so

far yay I did it I made it to the

bank

I just have to be a bit more

careful yeah these levels sure are

taking

time especially comparing swing

time I'm moving so slowly through water

they should have

like I that could improve the

game clear out an area of enemy stuff

buildings and

stuff then you like take over

the base PL platform or something and

then you can start from

there there we

go okay and then I have to cross quite a

sturdy wooden

bridge this support is heav

people sustain quite a lot of damage

no so let's move home thank

I the am oh I'm not supposed to go in

there you're doing swimmingly

oh I see what you're doing

there I'm very

sturdy

so

I'm happy to do

s that should be enough to get

home oh wait my Bas it down

here I'm going the wrong

way all these final levels are going to

take quite a

while so completing the single play of

this game

is it's going to be a while pineapple

pizza I do prefer sliced

pineapple currently I'm eating not not

currently currently but after this

stream I will make myself a

pineapple

hamburger I take some Buns of

bread some meat made out of pork and

beef and some

lettuce and

tomato mayonnaise ketchup because not

enough

tomato tomato ketchup and the a slice of

pineapple I prefer and cherries on h no

on Pizza well pineapple and an cheres

let's

go flesk shut OK no shut there you

go shorten to flesk and nut

inappropriate

context but of course n can only

be

obviously shorten into flesk is

perfectly fine shorten into n does not

really work because it's the same word

as

for what

not so it can only be shorten to n in a

very specific meat context while flk is

so much can be shortened

to shorten the flask in uh food

context

well no

oh didn't mean shoot that

one kind of need

it prob kind of zoomed in on that

one okay I need to get rid of the

buildings

here

okay specific meat

context

well

yes specific

meat and you might be thinking of

different

meat I mean me meat meat meat this

meat okay you know

what same I destroy the place to get

more

munition what the enemy there it is

there it

comes didn't know there we

go well

start the buildings when I Ram with this

vehicle CU I can't go through find the

right way to go around wa this is going

back wait a minute I'm a bit

confused go

there don't confuse flask with flasa

yeah

yes um people who are not used to these

Swedish letters there

were consider them as the same

letters

as yes a and o but they are completely

separate

letters that should not be

mixed

we going say

that where

is now I definitely

need shouldn't have destroy that

thing is there one inside the base

too

now there's Fu

inside cuz I'm going to move all the way

back I can just as well repair the

vehicle I know there's ammunition for me

to pick up on the way home

but

yeah

or nothing there sweet order but yes

we're all separate letters bro trust us

bro yeah they are

different there there are letters in the

English that are originating from the

same like origin but there are still

three separate

letters like G is just a variant of

C because C was used for the sound that

g g or G I guess made and they weren't

distinct until someone made up that

letter by adding a line or two to the

letter c would imagine if someone was

was mixing up with G and C in English

that would just be

confusing and that's probably why the

lowercase G is also letter C with a like

tail to it but a whole right side is one

they are similar for that reason so I'm

doing so I have to

basically snake around the whole

thing oh col turns into an

emot there semicon but it's

too yeah if you use colon you can search

for emotes but I mean if it doesn't

match an

emote just you just to be able to type

in like the Polish letters the

Polish

and can't really I don't know if I got

those two correct

but H are all separate letters

yep and mixing them

up makes it just sound silly and I think

the biggest issue is that in several

several English context they are

deciding to remove

basically because of course they those

letters originate from the letter Zed

but then they have added the markers on

them to Mark the pronunciation but then

in English context they sometimes remove

the

markers which changes the sound and then

and also English speaking reading as was

English words doesn't help I and it all

gets messing

confusing

they add there as decorations they serve

a purpose for

pronunciation a and o are separate

letters a

and that's my best

attempt n and

n s and

s St and

chair

yep

get out of my way I'm trying to turn

here

boom just like how my S was

changed yep and Le in that case there

like well we can't type it on our

keyboards but it's more like when people

are

presenting information on like again

YouTubers which gets really silly I

think when when presenting a person who

has uh a name with those

letters Polish person or something then

remove the symbols because apparently

they can't just copy it from whatever

Source they got the name from and like

if you go to Wikipedia it should be

written correctly just go to Wikipedia

to find the correct

spelling and then and then pronouncing

it as a Lish

word and it all gets

messy am I already dead taking so much

damage

already get in

building I'm missing it

well I did hit

it oh have

to have to go through

here but this is

annoying oh that was

easy

oh

okay

no oh

well I do still have the

tank I'm up

there it doesn't connect on the left

side

there uses s and

um and

which doesn't exist in English so s

becomes s instead of sh which is

approximate in English and R becomes n

which is an

approximate both of which change the

pronunciation yeah it does still change

pronunciation at least the second one

was changed on

approximate yeah but why wasn't the

first one changed on

approximate

and of course I I heard about the whole

changing the spelling of immigrants and

so

on but people also say that it wasn't

the people

uh working that changed in spelling it

was the people immigrating that chose a

new spelling

so I don't know which it is it might

have been both depending which location

maybe maybe they're

like I could I could assume it's like

okay you choose a new spelling or we

will choose a new spelling for

[Music]

you PR mind not being

case he

anyway trouble sh in based on letters

available but

yeah

he doesn't see me oh no it sees

me can't miss it destroy the

wall oh no how am I going to do

this

there you

go

so because I do have Rel relatives who

didn't use n as and use up to simple for

eh

yeah it

does does not really explain who chose

it because

uh yeah because different people can

have changed it separately someone

who one that added the N might have

chosen

itat because they had more experience

with the

nasal taking heavy damage

no

no okay I also need

fuel and

quickly can I get to that will let get

shut down no I know

no

no I got a slight

beit my to help me get to another one

which is safe like this

one

which

okay there it

comes

oh

oh I don't get explod I got

exploded

yeah I'm very close

though I just have to be more careful

now cuz it is my last

tank much celebration as

usual yeah I did not do a good job at

destroying that SC

no wait now I'm going this

way oh pushing

way I'm always that yeah yeah you do it

very

often

always every

time

scary

scary

okay now let's let's

continue I just need to okay here we go

we up the

tank

okay apparently not no feeling the tank

this

[Music]

time no still coming try to be

sneaky Tred to be sne sneaky but

nope I'm so sorry I can't help

it ding ding ding ding yeah they're not

subtle about stealing the fuel tomato

bags that

too okay let's

see wa isn't this the

place don't

remember yes this is Place

oops this is a bad

spot

oh no more I'm moving I'm

moving getting out of your

way I am

moving

wor

sure funny tummy

time already get suffering severe

damage this is

annoying W sorry sorry

what to safe where I think this

way go a bit easier to

[Music]

navigate

let's get rid of some of these

then get through that a bit

easy bunny tummy got to Tickle Bunny

tummy the bunny tummy is

exposed

oh

cided am I on the wrong right

path trying to make a bit safer to get

around

here

I'm running out fuel

again that should definitely be enough

out the way where is home home is here

home is far away yeah definitely would

be nice if I could like clear out an

area and take over one of those bases

and then I can bring up the map and then

I can pick which base I should come from

and

then yeah because I cleared out quite a

few

areas but no I have to start from the

same place or like uh they could they

could be predetermined being Brown areas

I just have

to tou the platform

maybe to to enable

[Music]

it because like this part isn't hard it

just takes

time

or like platforms are enabled if there's

no enemy turret within a certain range

from it except the starting one of

course that

one you always have

active but if you destroy enough turrets

in a in a radius of one of those you

unlock

it it's an

idea that way it's not too easy to just

run in and take

one where's home home home is where the

heart

is establish a KN base and maybe clear

an extra vehicle

oh be

something no it's the L me trying to be

sneaky

not even being sneaky

[Music]

HS yeah I'm going to bre the C because I

spent so long on this map already I

don't want to fa

now so so

we

go

he down

here thank

you go and

then that was a building not not a

tower oh getting shot at again

and there we

go now I

can peacefully moving

here and I will just destroy this

one there's no flag I leave no don't

shoot me

okay I need more

fuel I wish I had some more munition

but there it

comes

oh in the during crinian course you get

the

sentence the kit p is where the cat is

maybe there an crinian

phrase or it's just a made

friend

okay move move move

move

no don't shoot the building well to

close another

trade okay I have to get home

[Music]

now no that Tower is

on

scary

scary I shouldn't waste

munition I shouldn't destroyed the

munition places either how do I do got

plant of fuel so that's

good okay this

is running Full Speed Ahead into the

tank good thing it didn't didn't get

[Music]

destroyed the music is very

dramatic

okay moving on the way

home I guess St a bridge here so I can

take a

shortcut

St go home eat burgers go to bed why you

want me to end

stream but I've got so

far not

yet

yeah it's only going 2 and a half

hours and this level is sure taking a

while yeah and I oh I was like all right

I got those two left now there add two

more there's two more a place with two

more

buildings

yeah I guess I was going to say that

this game can be tedious and I think

this is one of the more

tedious more tedious

levels hopefully future levels aren't

these tedious or you know they might be

even more

tties but I'm not the one giving

up but I mean imagine like comparing

like me spending an hour to complete one

level to me spend like 8 hours to

complete one outfit for pon pon I

guess the outfit is

more rewarding in the end but then just

completely a challenge like this I guess

there's a point in

that but we're here chatting so

definitely see this level

and I wasn't careful last

[Music]

time and the

outfit also doesn't have came over if

you get

exploded no but you know the file might

get

[Music]

corrupted doing SL tanking here and

there the head and there no not the cup

file or corrupted file hopefully not I

haven't had that is yet well the planet

did crash once did not lose much

progress since the auto

saved me just casually passing through I

don't like how shooting

Bridge

okay oh shot the

one ah nice now let's see if I can can

shoot the W though I want to see if I

can shoot the

building FL not correct

building it's a tower

but

well trying to make up a plan here

oh no destroy the wall

no

okay ah I found the flag good that means

I don't have to move as

far

there's trees I can get around

here okay

good now we just need to clear up this

area not letting

these C the

ones do the

Jeep here we go and that's all I

need oh now come

on back

home you

between tank stop

shooting

exactly well then I just need

to get through all this with a

deep

[Music]

well hopefully I have enough to shoot

down the next one what there it

is come on I'm shifting

you no I don't I win come me and I don't

need attack anymore but just in case I

need

it now I should have

[Music]

the he yes make making sure it can't

shake

me oh going the wrong

way there it is the munition

fuel

refuel

no

oh pie for tank pie yeah I don't even

have munition the tank is only for

traveling okay okay let's see if I can

pick up the

flag

stupid flying shoot

thing it would have been nice if I could

see somewhere you

know dynamic camera make sure you can

see the action I can't see an

action cuz it's too zoomed in cuz see

thing is the camera can zoom out really

far when you're in

Jeep but

sometimes the camera is a bit

stupid no stop getting

stuck I want it

there you

go beep beep peaceful

Leep why does it struggle reversing into

the

fuel just being

exra

sneaky so many

rocks despite being a Jeep it can't go

over

rocks and despite running over those

rocks so many times with the tanks the

rocks are not Crush down into the water

maybe not Crush but push down into

water okay stuck on a pebble here well I

manag to get to the

flag there we go

picked it up now let's see if I can

move back

[Music]

home that's where I'm

[Music]

going they're going to have a flying

sing after me now

[Music]

yep

hey at least I'm Quicken

[Music]

it

sometimes Le I'm moving the flag closest

even if it destroys the flag I don't

have to move as far with the

Jeep

now I just need to move there to pick it

up that I really don't like at least I

don't have to go as far so maybe I don't

need the tank fild the tank so maybe the

flying rout thing doesn't show

up and luckily I do have three Jeeps not

just

two

too many

[Music]

[Music]

Pebbles y it should only be over here

and I definitely not wasted half the

tank just yet though

[Music]

sing pon pon

y you good thing I made that

emote quite

useful despite making it available for

everyone to use during the Koke stream

but that was my mistake

oh no I want to go around this

[Music]

thing yes usefully mod

what

AR and just cut short over

here J

welcome music kind of

loud hope I hope the music too loud

yes check I'm sitting up straight take

shorter there still I mean I know it's

been 3 Hour 3 hours already but but

still but

still I have yeah I have full set now so

that

wasn't that

so this shouldn't be too hard let's go

spice tracking at SPID way and

yes

you SS can swim yes this

can I have been since the start well

okay okay welcome back into the chat

despite you being on this been watching

the stream all this time

you're not been acting in this CH I just

like to say

welcome but thank you for being here

since the

start it's nice to know that I have some

more dedicated

watches cuz I've seen some people

having their dedicated

watches oh no oh no

no it's wrong

thing and it's nice to

have you're pie that was a

mistake but of course as you should say

no one is supposed to be

here clim from p and grab

back no messing with cookies under my

ears make sure you don't you don't have

any Crums on on my ears trap

yeah yeah I was kind of I do like this

placement

though I just I just want to quickly

move through no no got stuck

again wait did it just try don't

worry I'm basically wasting the

helicopters but I'm going to sure what

else I'm going to use them for

anyway

so it is a peace sign but there is not

piece here it's only

death right let's

go tracking destroy that

thing no peace for the

trees

strangely oh got stuck on a

bush a strange uh peace shaped formation

of this

island it's a wonder what nature can

do okay can I shift that

thing without dying there we go nothing

there let's move on I realized it was a

m a bit too

late but yeah earlier on I told you

about heat Warhead and CYO Choppers I

don't know if it's Kyo Cyro or something

else so we go on with saying chiropter

like chiro practition or

something H yes you did and I do

remember that that doesn't mean you I

don't know went away do did something

else appreciate you're still

here stop shooting

me that is highly

rude

okay I sustained massive damage

already I guess I just move back home

then oh

mine

go where is that watch effect on

land then I will

just

okay

H maybe it isn't I actually don't know I

probably take the down to right

instead King f w what war

King oh yeah you're multitasking play

War th

and watching the

stream yeah I kind of multitask watch

having a

stream running while doing

something okay get of the

tree I

need grinding I see I

see see someone using C instead of G

like I mentioned

before R rra face on

ears I hope your face is

clean just I'm just thinking about

someone uh wiping their snot with

my

disgusting hey where are you coming from

I've been very peaceful

here was thinking yay can up on me

munition no it's been

mined not mining that

way it's it's been

trapped I than you help me destroy the

trees grinding I watch stream while

hugging of skunk plushy that sounds

nice

well when I do go to bed I do have let's

just remove some of this

trash H do have a a plushy hugging me

while I watch The

Stream there is event going on with the

interesting vehicles I want so I assume

you win the vehicles so cleared out that

therea so now I just move north or

south no blowing no ears yeah that would

be very

disgusting

that just can move through here there's

a lot of Mines here

didn't me shoot that

building that's one of my

buildings is it wrong to shoot

t with

missiles

okay so the flag thing is up

here thank you for helping me destroy

your

Towers oh more

help can I move up like this it's a bit

dangerous

move I no I'm getting it no there we

go this is

stupid

no stop attacking

me okay I should have have done

this oh well it worked I'm in

safety and that's when the music get

intense

because the music is not adapting to the

situation because that would require

effort and no effort was much effort was

made still still have fun I

though oh you got your

star that's how you get my attention

that's what the star does should have

right

that

there we now we can move down so I

cleared up that area so now I just need

to oh my so many so many

Towers I'm a electric

boy I'm El

elected electric

spine I'm protected electric

eye okay

but you're my star oh thank

you I'm

stuck no they're setting up this

again

okay so it's down

here go no flag in that

one and I know it got destroyed because

it disappeared from the map and no flag

showed

up let obvious when you find the flag at

least they made that

obvious

go trying to destroy that

scene I'm getting destroyed myself oh no

one of these again

go am I supposed to get home

now there D such still

here

w Wait more just shoot down the tree

shoot down the

tree oh took too long to shoot down that

tree go

go sorry I failed

you I'm going to take left

now I know I worked uh breaking down the

base on the the south southern base

there but I'm going to go left

here attack the left base and then I'm

going to go back to the southern base

through the left

pass right see

huh Place actually can p

up

okay ammunition

it

go well someone's trying to shoot

me so yeah there was a lot of turrets in

a single place still pressing back to

close the map that's not how it works

twice in the same

stream

yep that's just doubly embarrassing

let's get do with that let's let's not

destroy this thing

here okay I want to yes shoot down shoot

it come on shoot it there we go thank

you

so as to

see

okay someone's trying to shoot me from

up North how dare you I'm not even

focused on you

people see does this one contain the

see then we can just move

on

anyway I should probably go back home

and

repair the

vehicle see it's only 10 minutes over no

problem this no problem I'll do this uh

there's only two locations left so I

can't move down because that's blocked

off I should take no no I think the left

path is still safer even though I'm not

clear that out it seem to be less

turrets even though I clear the right

side there still seems to be more

turrets

there bad choice of me to try to attack

the southern base from the

East bad

move

y here they

are move out of the

way okay there's a lot of turrets here

still okay so this is the base and I

need to

attack

no no that wasn't the

towerway

H mistakes what I

made but maybe I can infiltrate with a

helicopter now cuz I've shut down so

many

turrets

Towers

trowers they are trowers

now here we go I shot it just need to

get out of

here I didn't want that to expect me to

come back from the same direction I they

expected that and I'm now under

attack oops mistakes were

made well looks

like looks like I made

mistakes

mistake

I wanted to quickly get rid of that to

move on but got that this one was much

weaky let's get rid of

you rid of

you so I can safely stand here there we

go

oh more shooting at

me okay

so not shooting at me you're probably

going to shoot

me

well no thank you well there's only one

place

there is going to do a 15 points turn

here no come

on stop shooting

me okay well in that case there's only

one place the flag can

be only got this 14 points oh

no and also I could just rotate it like

that but

ah

ah let's go

home and start infiltrating the final

place and of course the final plac is

very

fortified well I will attack it from the

S because I've already started attack

from there

so seems like a good idea to continue

attacking

there

I

think not

bno

go there so I can move

through another

towerway oh herey here it

is no I Mo too far

forward okay

so let get of this I can move quickly

through

here so mean shoot

that destroy

everything so I've started attacking

that but I basically have to get rid of

everything of could turn on a d but you

needed to add hum is at 15

now where is your tank commander who

ordered the crew to dve with closeth I

want to hit with my

sword have like a sword button the

character jumps out and Swings with a

sword you use it when you don't have any

more

ammo or want to attack H in

infantry cuz that's swords against

infantry so it's

okay oh got stuck stop shooting me

okay

you got destroyed

okay I kind of can't that off so now I

need to go home and repair

again time have time I'm not I'm stuck

stop shooting

yes um alsoa peaceful tank so you

shouldn't be firing at

me Brown stands for

peace when you have brown you just want

peace and

quiet look at this

distraction uh did I'm not respons for

this I'm not taking any

response

so what can Brown do for you

I you know when you're having a Brown

moment

you you just

want peace and quiet right some myone

time it used to be an old UPS commercial

okay well you know I don't know

yous okay moving

in

the wrong

thing and here is a

plag no shot the wrong

thing

doesn't show Towers on the map it only

shows more walls and towers of the same

color what is the green thing oh we'll
