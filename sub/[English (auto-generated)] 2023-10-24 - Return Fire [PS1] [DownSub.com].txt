but we can decide what to play unless I

should like play more return fire now

you

know I still have like another hour I

should stream for I should

stream do you want do want more return

fire now or do you want do you want to

keep that

until it's

Thursday everyone else here let's go

back can there some more return

Fire Let's return to the

fire why is the

chat the chat broke for me your last

messages does not show up in the twitch

chat it does show up on the screen for

me but

not weird

very weird anyway it's this play Turn

fire I do have the ring of

fire I can go getting e

see

yeah let right that

sorry

there we go getting oh wait I should

start the

obviously we have ads playing by the way

apparently

ads which again the twitch s in OBS

didn't tell

me

po

the here we

go and start

that

so let's say let's go back to the

classic so where do I have my

base that is the big

question do you see a red pre freak

freak is the Swedish word for DOT I

think it's there which makes sense then

I and then the goal is

to these levels ring up high and feeling

this those levels are going to be quite

annoying

not you got n watches maybe and it gives

you time to put in points to the

prediction no one has taken part of the

prediction

yet they clearing a i

nope

I

failed putting the points towards

prediction uh I'm playing getting DC

this

time I'm I'm getting ready

prediction has an option for me to to

predict

but yeah if I turn to open it says the

streamer cannot make

a 5,000

points on one of the options we got one

prediction put

in everyone ready let's

go look at this

there it makes

sense

yeah okay let's see how

much yeah they're not letting

me

let's make it a bit

easier it's too too much water to get

across so this is what your time is if

you haven't been watching my on me on

Thursday and Fridays be right back oh

goes away the first thing it

guys oh reman is back

already he heard a helicopter got very

excited okay

no back okay oh did your restroom

break my helicopter

broke

this is what I wanted to

[Music]

do for some heon I fa to

[Music]

run

okay but at the same time I'm not going

to get into that base with

helicopter they're going to shoot it

down I mean

maybe don't know I mean if I'm not going

to use the helicopter

anyway yeah I'm like if I'm going to use

the helicopter for

anything let's see how far I can get

with

it

oh

M's there okay that how was there

[Music]

too I might be able to the let see we'll

see

for

[Music]

there we

[Music]

go to many

[Music]

attempts it's a return fire

Tuesday

and I'm sure ret turning the

fire oh no I didn't mean to shoot the

building

well everything exploded

anyway

okay and

up

and there we

go it's that's part I'm scared

of that party to the west southwest of

the

base probably going to give me a hard

time they're probably going to fight

back

yep

yep

I cannot use the

helicopter well at least I can't fly

over

[Music]

there

[Music]

no you didn't

[Music]

one okay what

commun can I we go back

[Music]

home I just wanted to hit

thatway that CA me

there we

go

there we

[Music]

go so with that

destroying there's still that other

one at least if

I even if the helicopter mission

fails it still makes it easier for the T

to go through at the

[Music]

end

and can

right is back is back

back

back my mission of destroying this wall

of towers is not going so

great well one Tower is

down that's

[Music]

something w

w

yay go go

go go go pon pon backing for it backing

for

it multiple go

gos he there's one less tower now that

shs me

here no don't I went

yeah I felt that wouldn't work with the

helicopter anyway so that doesn't change

much was kind of planning on using the

tank

anyway oh to

see some much to for

here of that

one now I'm getting

stuck the stupid thing is in the

way get rid of

it

this level see is much more reasonable

than a ring of fire

because so much less Towers lump

together this is like the easier version

of the

level this quite different

here this is definitely a low of

towers but definitely a higher density

of trees let me go back home refill the

tank

and getting rid of so many of these

trees

making navigating much

easier come

on

i r a bunch of these trees anyways

[Music]

so comes a lot

of going back and forth between to go

around the

trees

look like these

Tre there we go I want a clean PA

here

I can get that more

straight straight

line to she sh all down or blow them

up my job is to blow them

up you can see I have

a

no

yeah the density of trees is

crazy there we

go

some

Towers

okay

let's hit of this one one I'm at here

anyway we

go time to return

home

there we go making na

home the last one making them get home a

bit

easier

[Music]

[Music]

and I

[Music]

assume they might be place to fuel

up and stock up behind that wall I

destroyed I hope so at

least so

and yeah remind for anyone who is here

that the prediction is still going if

you want to take part in it more than

half the time has run

past yeah it's only 10 minutes left so

that's two STS of the

time my aim

practice one a singer passion taking is

taking part is the prediction

we need at least two people technically

we need at least two options being voted

for okay no place to fuel up behind the

one that's a bit

annoying

okay I

am nearing half a

tank and I still don't see a place to

fill

up I return home for now and then I'll

just I guess try to drave more

efficient

rooming these I don't have to drive

around

those oh Dorito popcorn spaghetti pizza

with pineapple almost said

ananas

ananas p is leaking everything poor is

leaking sugar and that gets high

pre Nice Shot myself nice

shot

no see the more shots I

waste

the

the light rate should be in there for

more fuel efficient I mean that's not

how this game work but do I really

because up up there top left is

certainly our base do I really need to

travel that far to fuel

up

well this is it

then maybe just in time I didn't think I

was going to make it would be quite

annoying to run out of fuel like on top

of the platform

I'm was giving nerv

day me

too

[Music]

they can at least build some roads here

for a bit fast to

travel Le like after you pass the

first first of

[Music]

allall yeah the game does

say these spiral levels really don't

make it

easy

let's need some fuel tank to to on the

island right

here I don't know I'm not going to

investigate

that oh you should be able to cut across

there

in here

too okay there's a lot of Mines here so

might be yeah here we

go

hor s

tense

just need to remove

that can you guys like

move why do you have to card it get out

the

way but how am I supposed to to R

it the M's

everywhere and if I TW in a

mine well you can guess what

happens

well well I guess that's the

like supposed difficulty

[Music]

here did

[Music]

can get destroyed thank

you hey excuse

me it looks like I had to

leave

maybe we need

to refuel just to be on the safe

side even though it's not safe to refu

in the first place you

know

[Music]

then that's

oneing it's doing some

gardening

Bo

fly you have now your

you're here now you're gone good

treat pruning the trees

yes yes a bit on the

top but the time for the prediction is

up what do we

have one person for the time which has

been elapsed for now that's not going to

be a winner

sorry

one person saying one to 1 and a half

hours one saying over one 1 and a half

to 2 hours well we'll

see we'll

see that's exciting part of these

predictions

and of course all in for fun only

F nothing to

see

H oh

Sports just switch like that is it

convenient from then now does it

automatically B soft bunny

tummy it's been a while since I was in

his

base so I cut across

there move forward I go back and then I

cut down

there yes I have a plan post

check oh yeah and then I can confirm

those

one of these I have away to the your

[Music]

tank

[Music]

such a long

travel wish I could establish a new base

where those tanks were start there

instead would fix so many of the issues

this game

has wrong CH but I got something I

guess that's

[Music]

something and that's the place I should

go across after

refueling and continue my

adventure

counterclockwise

around or anticlockwise whichever you

[Music]

prefer Here Comes State

threats

oh another one just deal dealt with one

of

you now we going to for me come on have

pleas l r see coming damaging me like

that

my pristine new tank and

everything it s was that Tower but a PL

not I guess I cleaned up some trees I

guess this that's

good

oh nice nice this is definitely much

better than the other

place

well I do not appreciate you trying to

shoot

me no fing a r

team

okay sustain a plenty of

damage and here is where I

destroyed the

helicopter except these because these

destroyed my

helicopter very rude of them to do

oh no okay I need to

leave yeah took a lot of damage

from the flying R

[Music]

thing I don't know if I manage can

manage to reach this place from

um and no

already let me just clear off this

area can I reach this

place

was a bit

[Music]

cleaner no it did not work it still

Trier

it try to be

clar not two of

them

yeah think so

dude I think I should be able

to come thing in his

head yeah don't care about you being on

the same

team yeah if only they could destroy get

destroyed by flying into each

[Music]

other because they did

bumping

should I risk going for the second place

with the tanks or should I go to the

first

place I think I should be able to reach

it

yeah I I think I should be able to reach

it no

problem now that I cleared it off

[Music]

nice

[Music]

at Le I should be able to complete this

level and then I have the whole stream

on Thursday to do ring of fire which is

the last level of this

world

yeah I don't want to cross the water

there I mean although if I did clear off

that area that might be a

shortcut yeah I should be able to reach

this

area there we go yeah this is no

problem there we

go and then flying R thing will appear

yeah from

[Music]

South

that pass is to why to get

across basically need to find another

place where I can get across the

[Music]

[Music]

water

oh nice o I took barely any damage from

that

then why are you still

[Music]

alive

now what where did you come from I guess

I have

to why can't you shoot

it there we go

finally what that's a hard

[ __ ]

yeah

nice with some roads

here okay for some reason he's trying to

focus on this or something I don't

know maybe it's this this it's focus

on I mess this with the camera or

something and can you please just get

out of

here

and

Things

No let me clear off the forest

here so it's a bit easier to get

through now need a punch up grades yeah

I

[Music]

know can't do

this the loop the song isn't perfect

but

time to go home

again go go

go go go p p p

p shouldn't the sports way be over

soon

well any moment now it should switch

[Music]

over

there we go that's the point when the

switch I was a swing

se he SP water

11 when I miss one three will hit

another I totally aimed for that

one so

yeah

so yeah the remaining party does not

look

[Music]

fun Should

[Music]

I

right on the final note of song good

thing you plann that 15 minutes ahead of

time you're very

skillful

an outfit for pon pon which is theun

outfit with

a polygonal dress which I guess would be

a black dress with white stripes on it

highlight in the outline White Stripes

going down and the white bottom

part

[Music]

I'm following the L of

the level a bit too

much

bottom yeah the Hem of the the dress are

you trying to say that I called ponon at

bottom ponon is totally at

[Music]

to

okay and then

here and then I'm straight through here

now just remarking that you said the

word

bottom bottom

Underside Underside wouldn't be an

appropriate

[Music]

term I of a be about to choke of

[Music]

course another one giv me a

problem Yep this one is giving me

from find

me very dramatic

music did

tream

you can't shoot me when I'm behind the

house

I don't like the number of Mines

here I do mind

that

no go

forward oh nice I can refill my

munition kind of it's kind of tricky to

go through

here

oh

no ni

that good think I can sneak around like

this

the music is being very

dramatic

Fu could be loaded that

quickly

like there's this part

here

[Music]

but I don't think it leaves me tell more

useful I wish I could go over there

instead

maybe I can across the water here

somewhere doesn't look like it

[Music]

though way too much

water also take that evil R thing evil

flat flying rude thing B me evil not

peaceful

yeah only m m I'm

peaceful no I another R flying

things so hard to

he

no no

way why I have such trouble hting

them

yay and then I can now it's kind my

sleep

there doing a quick refueling

here should not bring any flying

anything

then I should go up over

here and then just go home

again

for

[Music]

see following

down I shouldn't

do

intens to find p p

puns

[Music]

[Music]

yeah pretty easier to go between those

locations if there

way to go bit from from yeah actually

actually no I'm need to refuel that's

problem if I find a way to refuel at

location I think I take what if I take

this vehicle

instead it's very slow

though which you can an

issue I can go one round with it at

least don't bring out to Pi and yeah you

just want to

try

see if it even can reach the

location let see so

slow slow and

easy oh someone's been

here

the

now it doesn't seem like I can get the

crossing and this one seems to consume

more fuel than the tanks I might just

not be able to reach the next F

station first

one

how do you say so slow in

Swedish yeah I don't see it be possible

to the first place R even the legitimate

first place re if I were to follow this

SPM

come on I'm trying to drive

here I might need to go for a real

place certainly I should be able to

reach that with

this

because that's the intended place to Rie

that

yep I just reached

it

excuse

me

easy one is enough I do know know I take

like the long way around when I leave

but the short way when I

enter

okay

he

w

and this

place yes ref before I

can h f soon I'm going reach

enem so slow okay that is so longsome I

have no idea how to say so slow in sish

so

longam well that is so long time if

you're referring to the sing and so

long if you're talking about it be like

the in general it's it's

slow

so many mines here so many mines look at

the

RAR your R is

Pink So Long stand and Swedish never

puts T off D like that that's more of a

Danish

thing long Sam is the word long is

connect s and then after that is

Sam Sam is the the common form and Sam

for the

new now I'm already fully stucked I

can't feel

more

no

[Music]

s s

m and of course

the

don't I reach it oh

well let me

s y shooting the one more in

swer thing I

do

long some there you go so longam when

you speak of the vehicle so longm if you

speaking

about just being a slow day for

example or like you're riding in it and

it's

slow the way Swit has both forms

depending on what you're referring to

like

that it's a neat feature but I

understand it's it's if it's considered

weird consider all languages doesn't I

assume a lot of language doesn't do

that certainly other languages have

similar

feature

oops oh

no

really yeah I have to drive all the way

back I didn't mean to stop don't don't

stop drive all the way back so I can

bu it that

way go and get some

Munitions

nope when

well mean slow imp polies also means

free as

inated well that didn't go well I'm not

sure why why it showed up there all a

[Music]

sudden

exact if

you the exact trigger

point I back a little bir told me the Cy

bunny was still

[Music]

streaming wait

wa who's this Cy birie you

know you don't do this oh right little

bud not cute budy okay I'll take it back

but now you got the bunny un leash are

you are you going to post that a lot a

lot on the water

stream look I I'm taking p and I

work maybe I should have a emote for

with a leash but making sure it like

goes in

Cas make sure it that goes up to the uh

neck of the

barel p

[Music]

p eventually there's still going to be a

gap

but think all the P

work have you lost every other B oh

there you go that's the rest of the

bouncy yeah I need a bouncy FAL pon pon

give me an idea of how

like I said she should still be like the

indifferent look thing she's not doing

this because she finds

funny she's doing it because she has to

she forc to

bounce that's the kind of look I want

for p on emote is free wait how is it

free you still have a bouncy Fox I

do

[Music]

come

on

fin rud

things you can contact the C and she can

make you want yeah but what would that

cost I'm planning on to get two done

soon and also depends on how like buy CF

as well I mean because as you as you

might not know I'm very very

poor I'm I'm I'm struggling a lot with

money so that's why I'm not able to

really pay for stuff that's why I'm

playing a lot of retro game not like

morning games

too

one for mage and one for my PNG when

it's me I'll send you the what she said

on

price one

F I'm still willing to like I'm still

interested in just making my own you

know but if she's like

please like and I'm I'm not like a great

artist fantastic artist people like my

art so kind of but so if I make all my

emotes myself they have more of a

consistent style I do know the pon face

and the pon pon vibrates are not really

the same style but those are before I

actually made for

em I wouldn't exactly count

those and I want to replace

those maybe I should just redraw the

starting phase

one and yeah and making the vibrating

ponent actually more like a hyperactive

face expression kind of

feel why why does the music have to be

so

dramatic hit the tower now where do you

come

from no I'm going under

attacks

no

h might I have a lot

left this isn't going

great

I just wish I had a

shotgun like they could unlock shortcuts

or something when they this game is very

static pon pon

Munchies yeah munching on chocolate I'm

sorry for that

distracting the chocolate is

good and I can't help

it I like

it

I like

it are you saying you want to munch on

me one kind of chocolate just chocolate

chocolate chocolate with

hazelnut some I don't remember the brand

but it's from Leal

so

a cheaper brand it's actually

not cheaper really cuz little do have

like I guess proper still I mean still

cheaper Brands but still cheap Brands

you can find

in just because the brand is cheaper

doesn't mean it's

bad mun pun

P yeah I see you would like that

ERS

little we we

got lington over

here L how did you H how did become

L do you live in

lington have not corank

nah you have some hidden secrets with

lingon is that someone you

[Music]

know is that another bunny you

know lington the

[Music]

bunny

[Music]

nice I don't even know where the heck is

I only know one bunny what how do you

only know one

bunny it's up past bunny I'm sorry I was

cheating on you no I mean if it was in

the past like before you knew

me watching other bunny streamers what

is

this

I thought you were important to me or

that I was important to

you looks like you're satisfying your

bunny need with other bunnies

[Music]

Hil a yandere I don't even know what a

yandere is me I've heard the term but

it's like it not the definition of

it I mean maybe maybe

not almost like I can cross the water

here I have like four

other I'm not that

special

initia

depression I

know

oh

run run run

run oh know it's close enough to the

water

I

[Music]

okay

oh

no three minute

Towers yeah shoot each

other come on shoot each other

there you

go run run run run

run clear off this

area why does this the music have to be

so

dramatic we go I easier to get across

here

prob is I'm running out the

fuel and I need more I shouldn't waste

them

on shooting clearing up the PS

even though I did

it I should

hopefully yeah it's very close by here

there's one there but I do not dare to

go

dat no problem we'll probably attack

like two flying R

things

and let's fight this one

first

[Music]

yeah and it's the only

one

there

go going to go home and

panties thank country is closing

in anyway let's see what you

said theand is like an obsessive partner

who doesn't want you to see talk to

other people but I'm not evil P I'm not

sure

that's

no maybe will P would be there like that

if she had a

[Music]

partner I think

anyway

well

[Music]

that's the G

St well

done maybe maybe evil pon pon is more

like

a

anyway and I see

that

this is really a Long Level cuz I have

to go back and forth so

much at least the Jeep won't take long

because I can't skip the water with the

[Music]

je but I do have to remove the to

garding I should check the map how much

left I have there to work with

not the

bullets I could see that evil p p being

a c evil on the outside loving on the

inside she loves being evil you

know okay I have that part where like we

my three

towers it's a bit tricky to

attack I I should be able to just ignore

the middle Tower because it can't really

reach anything the the middle Tower is

only causing annoying for the

helicopter which I don't have

any and here is where I will put my

helicopters if I had

any I crashed all three of them but I

mean they got shot down

so evil pon pon hard on the inside wait

hard on the outside soft on the

inside good pon pon soft on outside hard

on

inside good good pon pon and evil pon

pon and splashes soft on the outside

soft on the

inside out outside when

I mean I mean if if pon pon was

representing me

more and by being a transwoman you

know speaking of hard anyway moving on

taking P Pon on the

[Music]

walk

head

pets yep

yep just casually moving up to the point

where I can cross the

water

Little

D the little on

D

go that that emote is very well

drawn capturing the most important

features someone probably wants an pon

pon emote like that great assets yes P

Pon does not have such great

aets but someone someone probably wants

in version of one one like

that

now I'm getting a messages it's fun say

something is I hear hear the messages

one after

another there we

go

Pon P's assets are those fluffy ears

yeah she doesn't have the same kind of

assets she does have very

very tiny

ones she does have them but nothing

really she can show off and yes I am

that

person

[Music]

I really wish I could cross the water

here makes things so much

easier no I have to go

around around the world around might be

able to cross water there

cuz I don't

know might be a cross water here

too is something I should check that can

take a of

that ears are best assets the ears are a

great feature on pon pon and I think I

want the 3D model obviously to have but

like so the ears are flopping around as

as I'm moving my head around you

know it's

obviously no no no don't shoot me

I'm going to shoot

[Music]

you

oh someone is trying to shoot

me oh no someone shoots me all the way

over here oh nice

VI nice

nice

no where did you come

[Music]

from we

go oh

no another

Tower

I'm not doing so great that no no no

guarding that thing again I people stop

doing

that

no

yeah they

gone the music is very very very

dramatic I think I'm made good progress

this

time

and then the

loops comes very dramatic

[Music]

again is it more mean you had more

context what's going

on it's a bit hot in here let me take

off

some some article of

[Music]

clothing doing that one dying is a bit

tricky

St

who when it this got

destroyed that was my goal

[Music]

so that's definitely more than

enough safety home

[Music]

when a mommy flying routin and a daddy

flying routine love each other very

much what happens

then they only seem to send out their

daddy flying R

things because they they apparently can

shoot

[Music]

no broken

ketchup not safe work happens then

oh

yeah those right flying root things

better take that off their

work that's not part of their

work we

go

I am wearing a

swe no don't

[Music]

shoot which is a very big handsome to

remove there we go I finally go off

me

I'm they become flying Lo things oh I

see what you did yeah really clever

really

clever unlimited

stick wait how did I miss that

tree I saw that was just imagining Mars

playing a toally forgot was likeing

here

well it is playing full

volume music is kind of loud in this

game specific more specifically this

track is loud in this game they should

have lower the volume of this track they

should increase the volume a bit on

the heavy armored vehicle

track it's just your imagination go back

to sleep but time at work

and this track deserves to be the

loudest though to be honest I

mean for game play purposes for a more

enjoyable gameplay experience the the

track should be a bit more

balanced it's fully I fully understand

during a concert that you have different

volum Nam of the tracks that makes

perfect sense and I will respect

that but in the game maybe

not

so yeah yeah I'm I'm breaking in

there you better get paid to sleep yeah

I don't know much Hol but this the with

this song is just so

good I

like I mean it's a fine

song could play it on the radio when I'm

driving to work I don't have

work eventually I win hopefully if

everything goes

right if there's any chovsky that might

be the only one I I'd say should

be okay how about the you should be able

to go into settings find every audio

track and then you can boost or lower

the volume of them on your own if you

case you want one certain track to be L

but then they by default they try to

balance out

them you use canons I mean okay make the

Cannons sound really

loud no chovsky

Sally yeah there's

no cha chovsky

that's bmer 1812 would be fantastic in a

tank

scene yeah they even though they

basically

used what problem is public domain music

I don't know if it

is cuz this is from a specific orch

playing it and therefore there is

copyright on

it but the uh specific this version of

the song by these orur that might be

public domain I don't

[Music]

know got ride of the V SM Willam aure

light of the

Bumblebee there is seven

or eight music tracks in the

game the two tracks that play with the

tank this is Mars if I'm understood it

correct

then there's the other track that place

when to drive the tank which is before

you lose the first tank which means I've

lost the one tank and I think it plays

again when you're on your final tank

this really should be the music that

plays on your last

tank then the ride of Valkyries is the

one

for H the helicopter and then there is

the uh the Mountain King something

something and that place with the armor

vehicle light of the

Bumblebee that's the one to place with

the Jeep before you get to the

flag and then William Tell aure is's one

after you get the tank after you get the

[Music]

flag this the one one they placed on the

first tank that I don't know which track

it is all of the Mountain King that was

the name of it

yeah so yeah they track to place on the

first

tank and then the track the place when

you find the flag is the and when you

win the game is

hallelujah

hallelujah there we go

[Music]

and then there's the music that plays

while you're inside the

base T those Street

tracks you mentioned four I said it was

eight

tracks

wait you

mentioned helicopter tank Jeep

Jeep and so there is

tank armored

vehicle and flank finding

[Music]

flank oh I can't think at moment I'm

confusing

myself for some reason I said it should

be eight but I can only count up to

seven

yeah yeah base I forgot the base the

base

music that was the one I

forgot

and

fly there it

is me oh

dude oh you're

s yes destroy the W for

me

and the track

Loops not seamlessly

looping we can't afford seamless looping

here

okay where do you come

from I'm here fighting your

base don't come and interrupting me like

that come

on

I'm very busy attacking your

base

oh

okay I am running out of munition

and there we go no more

munition okay there's a shortcut over

there doesn't really help me

much so let me read the comments on my

trip

home I should just fill up a bit so I

can reach the

place where I can get some more

ammunition Bas

music not Bas music

exactly when I was in

college I did like

um metal medal cover of Mountain King

REM mixed with the Inspector Gadget seam

and that's all I can think

of that sounds bad yeah do it again

recreate

it more so than it actually was but it

was

fun I can imagine it being fun oh I

don't think that much

anyway always wanted to do Mars but some

guy on you Tobe beat me to

it his is just phenomenal oh

well did you post yours on YouTube where

so things I created for a long time ago

is kind of

lost if something silly and didn't

intend to publish

it but I guess some if you make

something like that you intend to it I

don't oh

nice

I'm cleaning out the

forest yay I beat the flying H

scene okay so I'm doing good

progress

[Music]

[Music]

and I destroyed one flly building so my

with my next attack I should be able to

destroy the remaining

ones

you just need to go another 40 minutes

20 minutes I mean yeah keep track of the

time yeah it's probably going to take 20

minutes for me to do the next

attack but wouldn't it be funny if we

lost spreading out your points to

everyone else you

know

I should have my secondary account just

sitting and watching the stream to get

points and then take part in the

prediction or selecting an option that

will always lose just to spread out the

points

handing out

points

basically

too much to handle too much to deal

with cuz I think I've destroyed the

planty of the base so far

so hopefully last world does not have

tedious levels like

this this is not the most tedious level

I've

played this is the Bas music and yes I

should be able to

defeat I have an idea of how to do

that wait not playing the mar song

anymore it's playing the other tank song

now which is the same as the Bass music

apparently or did they forget the Jin

music I mean that could be a

possibility but maybe this is the other

tank music it can

play the credits does tell what the each

track is we can always check that if I

remember it's an extra long stream today

but the stream today has been quite

some

interesting some Vian and then kurushi

and then return fire which I do play on

Thursday Friday

normally okay go go go and now a

princess in the

middle princess in the middle have you

watched that

show I have actually

okay I don't know if that's even a show

but

sound like a

[Music]

title so I went with

it and if it is a show

Well Point

surprise there was a show back in the 9s

called marol in the middle yeah but

that's not princess in the middle so it

doesn't

count Malcolm in the Middle was a

political show where he stood in the

middle of the two major

parties

hi P Pon the sexy P wait I was hot in

the pretty past and now I'm

sexy I'm not complaining

though but Hello

yto nice to see you here I you were here

at the start but nice to to see that

you're still here oh or you came

back yes that's what I

was that's what it was yeah Mal was a

political show about how Malcolm finded

the two major parties to be too extreme

so he wanted to create some Middle

Ground taking the best part of both

parties that's that's what the show us

about is I have no idea what kind of

show and that see was it this then

well then that makes me surprised

again came back from school oh yeah yeah

yeah you tell you told me you went to

school I forgot about that I have a

memory like a

rabbit well welcome back from

school I hope uh it went well that you

learned new stuff that you

needed and uh um I hopefully am able to

finish this level now I'm doing my

hopefully final

attack and hopefully it goes as

planned so I then can approach with my

G I'm too sexy for my sh Too Sexy For My

Shirt something something something

[Music]

something

and yes that song

is I did think of

my what

jum not because I'm too sexy for it

now I'm too sexy for my DRS too

sexy

and I me to

64

oh and I read up about that song because

well are quite interesting okay this is

not going to be the final attack I have

to do another attack after

this I did not do this oh excuse

me

thing

no another

one

yeah I definitely need to do another

attack after this did not go as planned

abort well I could destroy this

thing so that's

done

another

one they're

ruthless they are without the

ru please only send

ruthful uh flying read

things here we

go makes the pass pass T that a bit

easying s yeah they were crazy it flag

ahead that is

true I do think there is a flag there I

just need to find the correct

building

I just realize what the distinction

is I mean if you say like there is no

flag here it sounds more like I mean

it's yeah here it really depends on what

context you're talking

about

yeah cuz they can refer to like the

whole area or more more specific part of

that

area

yeah it was the specific

[Music]

building I actually don't realize the

difference

what I'm confused bunny

okay okay I was hoping that would be the

last attack but I messed

up

guess the reason Pon wears dresses in is

that

she's she too sexy to wear shirts I mean

I can wear a

shirt if you have an interesting outfit

where which has a shirt can

wait oh yeah pon pon did you see the DM

I sent you of a b thing well I did see

that I go am I say message but I did not

read

message which as you can see I am

playing the

game but I did get

something that's me

to yay

I shot the flying rot

[Music]

[Music]

scene which song is

this just making sure I didn't expect

you to read it

now yeah yeah it's fine it's

fine no I'm out of

munition and none of the active chat is

at mode except have

prediction maybe it'sing

prediction

that would just result in a

loss I have a good hopes for

it so sadly that was not this final

attack sadly none of the active chat

what F me well I did say except

or

sounds like you didn't listen to what I

saidian apparently we have a zombie in

chat oh I didn't hear that am

then

appearance take

[Music]

to reman you will be

remembered rest in

potates oh yeah

CUA

cross

great p p is oh my now p p is wearing a

different outfit she went from a cute

P hot

p i you

see

RI cat and

pass rescue a cat in a

pass C in the past

okay

H The Bunny tmy Goes Through pon

pon

M the ghost oh no don't

don't don't poke through pon

pon you're going to see all p p pun

intestines

yeah it would be fun if I can

make if I can make the petting hand

actually change depending on who redeems

it I guess each one of you have

to I guess I should have like a

redeem which you only have to redeem

once do that shows that you are an

active

uh okay like like this what I what I do

is I make a redeem that is

expensive but when you redeem it I will

refund it but you can only afford it if

you have been an active Watcher for a

while and this redeem allows you

to

um have your Custom Custom hand Des sign

for the

[Music]

PS that's one idea of doing

[Music]

it come on that should have hit

it

there we

go n too dark in there can't see

anything that I mean that's true climb

from Pon to P's shoulder and sleep under

the

ear an ear pen a

sandwich left

ear yeah h ,000 car coins for a custom

hand maybe not more like

10,000 and you do get points back

so so you don't spend

them don't worry about that I G by too

much to save 200,000 yeah plus saving

200,000 would require you to like not

use your points that often I really I

really I think I really would like to

see twitch have it's always f

is

that don't know if I mention

this yeah it it having the lifetime

amount of points you have earned ever

and the amount of points you have

currently to spend so basically whenever

you get the plus 10 points or plus 12 12

if your subscriber it also adds that

your lifetime

points then for people who have like get

100,000 get VIP status then you just

spend your so instead of spending

100,000 points for getting VIP instead

if you achieve a lifetime accumulated

points of

10,000 then you

can uh not like you still have to

manually pick that option it's not

exactly a redeem because you're not

spending the lifetime

points but yeah it's something like

that

w

w

okay I don't know what I'm attacking at

the moment no

no no one getting stuck no one getting

stuck no one get it

stuck the it just got stuck I couldn't

move

it I do still have two of these

so when did you start this map I don't

know I am the

way I gam too much the same yeah when

did you climb onto ponon Sher you were

on her desk last time

exactly hello P Panda things aren't

adding up here

people criticize in your

actions Panda said it when the power

went out power went oh your own power I

gamed gambled and used redeems and still

got

100,000 that was up there for a

minute and these are the very

slow ones yeah know

[Music]

d

[Music]

it's building up and going more

intensive if it are like two version of

this song it has this intensive part and

then have the quiet

version

although you can't use like live this is

a live Orchestra as far as I

know compress down on Playstation audio

quality

anyway and

then when you're in the safe like this

it plays the call

version and then when you get into more

intensive battle it fades over to the

intense

version probably course the intense

version

has a a different Tempo so I guess as it

fades it also increase the tempo or

something I think it could

work and then therefore the music will

be more Dynamic to the

action just an

idea someone who is

more a more of a music background could

probably come up with

a a better way of doing it that was just

a quick idea I

had yeah I was supposed to go over here

to T

first because in a game such as Mario

Kart 3 that game had uh the music menu

music built up in multiple layers and as

you went deeper and deeper into the menu

more and more layers were

added

kind of making the music more and more

intense which was a neat

feature even though it

was I don't know odd for Mario Kart to

have it I

guess I

mean yeah it's something like this this

game should have I can kind of

understand that PlayStation doesn't

really have the capability of playing

music that

way this song would be fun to play in

concert

maybe I cannot say anything

that Mario party I mean Mario

Kart Mario Kart

3 there was the Mario Party

week that's the game that ends

friendships not

really should I play Mario Party On

stream guess computer I guess in store

mod or

something I wouldn't be upset about with

someone playing Mario Party although if

you the one getting upset about playing

that game maybe we shouldn't play

it

but I have not been upset with anyone

playing that game I have had

experienced like one person I was

playing with getting upset and was very

awkward because no one else was

upset like it's just a

game

yes that game ends friendships well

sounds like you're

not good at the game

then but I enjoy playing that game well

like clearly I shouldn't be playing with

you if that's how you consider game to

be

like you're going to end the friendship

with

fun friendship with fun fun is over new

friendship with I don't know

red Mar po 3 is my favorite one but I

have two and four nice you don't have

your favorite Mario part I think Mario

Party 8 is my favorite one because I

play that

most oh and one although the Mario part

8 is so terribly optimized

though for the wi it's like 4x3 screen

it's so low

resolution it's so blurry it

lags terrible game on the

wi still fun to play

though one one so switch online three

switch online why why specifically once

you switch online and

not or is that like online

[Music]

play I still

haven't reach the enemies yet I'm still

approaching the enemy

base

since I came with I mean sure it was one

enemy trying to attack me when I was

fueling up my V but I don't think that

counts I'm not yet attacked the

base he trying to shoot me how would

you

ding ding

ding we got a raid from

bigun welcome

welcome whoops I shot the building I

didn't mean to shoot the building I'm

sorry building Builder

rer welcome B and Raiders I am pon pon

pon pon play a game on PlayStation one

known as return fire from

1995 if the title didn't want say

that and I am trying to attack an enemy

base and I am struggling a bit with

that

cuzz I'm running into

trees so how did it go for you I will

come back to your everything you right

after I'm no longer under

attack I mean I could pause the game but

I nah let's not pause the game let's

just

cheating

right

okay

let's and hopefully in this building I

mean otherwise it wouldn't make much

sense and then I must clear out the way

for the

Jeep

so fixing the door excuse me you have to

pay for that

door why

welcome welcome you were playing sea of

theves I think you were drawing as

well did

some something massive I think it

was okay is it safe probably

not oh out of

munition well

um well oh oh I I got an idea I got an

idea I got an

idea oops and it did not destroy the

power okay let's pause the games I pause

the

timer and I'm here before you uh you for

one PS geeking about classical music no

l

yeah so

um

[Music]

um as a thank you for reading I

think like that H what did you mean

before me H unlimited STI has been here

chatting before I'm not under attack but

I am under a kangaroo back I see what

you did there for as often as you sh

just as

I for as often as you ra just as I step

away from my desk I was already

here let's go to PX Instagram and and

let's present one of your beautiful

drawings which one should

be

showcase was like there we go

what let's take your L

destroying which

is uh shallow that's

the that's the word of that

drawing

please work with me Google

excuse Google is not cooperating with me

at the

moment Google Chrome there we

go and

uh 29 in oober and then some P

fan what was the rating of the pirate

movie the PD 13 I'm not allowed to watch

R H okay let's

show to B

It Go and W here's a

drawing again I

should

probably the border of

it there a keep drawing that is

definitely

shallow 23 is my favorite of the bunch

so far one of my top favorites one is

this the

23rd CU I

don't oh this is 24 unless you meant

that but this yeah I think the spaceship

is 23rd in that case which is a really

nice drawing but this was a funny

drawing and it was your latest drawing

so was 24 what was shallow

yeah I've got a is now what was the word

shallow shallow it is definitely

shallow

but we could do

a a special feature and showing the

other one too because it's it's not hard

since I got it work now it gave me a bit

of issues before let's take a look at

the other picture there we go is a

really nice drawing you put a lot of lot

of color into

it is the RGB space Oh thanks I do like

these drawings this I I I really

understand

why why this is one your favorite

it's is really well

made and this one was Celestial and I

tried to make a Princess Celestia joke

on that

stream

anyway PR the word Robotnik is the

Polish word for laborer oh NCC

1701 nice everyone loves the D

what moving

on back to the game D

strong I should be able to approach the

Jeep

now not

that so

not stand the

line deep

water that she is the 1701 the uh I

see

[Music]

anyway this should be the Flight of the

B

quick my favorite is the E I drew that

in my 2016

match and let's see if we can reach the

flag without getting

shot

sideways I'm not shut down because I'm

not in the

air

I guess shut up maybe then shooting

from that doesn't make any sense shot

flat I got the flag and now it should be

safe I want to watch the Original Series

so Kirk is my favorite starle

[Music]

Captain and the letters after the number

the N which subsequent

ship am I even on my way home at the

moment H it is in the line special

significant name ship

of NC 1701 because you can't they can't

bother coming up with a new

name and don't want ask SK this the same

exact same video every single time and

the final time is 2 hours 21 minutes and

22 seconds that's how long it took me to

complete that

map so who won who won the prediction

who guessed two hours no one no one

guessed that it will take over two

hours refund oh I don't want to

refund but I have to

refund I want I wanted someone to

win I win no

winners order all the

losers but you got the refund
