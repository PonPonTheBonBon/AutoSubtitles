introduction introduction wow I can I

see me cat Fox I am a cat fox hybrid

that has sometimes the ability to turn

human-ish thanks to the color that I

wear

but I still can't ever get rid of the

tail and ears so there we go

I like to play games human games because

it's the only way that I can get to

learn how Humanity Works

um so yeah this is this is a human

puzzle solving thing I suppose

um but I am joined with um on the bonbon

and as now is that how you say it yeah

all right great now you guys can go

well I'm fun fun

I don't have an intro

yes pump on the pro Spyro player yeah

I've been playing it that's fine but I

play whatever game in the game

I just thinking

I don't really have so much lower behind

I'm just a bunny

just a bunny that knows how to play

video games [ __ ] yeah best type of bunny

ever that's that's me basically yes

playing games

adorable Bang

you think you're perfect

ly so nervous

hello my name is asna and I'm on a

pilgrimage uh to the material realm to

learn about the people of the material

and I learned these things about these

uh things called video games and so I

sometimes live stream on draco's channel

of my experiences playing them and I

play things like

um doom and Alvin ring and Spyro and I'm

trying to go play Crash Bandicoot and

Henry the stickman eventually so I play

all sorts of things to learn about

people also

um I'm an obsidian dragon as well I I

guess uh people are okay with Jenkins in

this world it's kind of weird but

and

Kaya you're gonna make games for trains

do they

so it should be

oh wait I had to click the play button

oh yeah if you if you wouldn't mind

perhaps you can host us

uh I'll try

okay oh I I guess I am Jacob already

made my character for me I play cow app

I guess house game

foreign

okay

um

I think I said yes

perfecto

okay

take this class

yes I may or may not have forgotten to

post my Discord link because I swear I'm

a professional

um

so let's see what kind of stuff do we

have we have um the tutorial uh fabric

of Egypt Egyptian space Edgewood mansion

and make a corporation

extra steampunk DLC and Miles by CLC

I guess you start with the first

to understand the game

oh yeah me too so it is kind of weird

that it's showing us to do the tutorial

at the moment and maybe it's just

default so I guess I've eaten yet yes

sir

yes that sounds good okay let's know

when this goes

[Music]

thank you

and let's see

in a very small room

there is a very small room

it's really Wiggly it is

super fast

Sensitivity I guess I I had to change it

uh let's see yeah just I try to

anyway

oh we have a time limit interesting what

happens if we don't do it in the time

limit okay I don't know

we all die

did everyone feels with sand we have

is it movement speed

there you go can you not uh yeah that

doesn't work okay okay oh

wait hold on didn't move my speed just

make me slow down from moving why would

it let me move the thing but not take

the thing what um oh yeah it's yeah

something I assume it's because it is

attached against

I think you just click it

oh yeah but why it should be a reason

you could probably 102.

I found a book

yeah yeah can you observe the book what

does the book say

[Music]

um

it has a whole bunch of drawings and

letters and

my chains and

would you compare

what kind of language is this

okay I guess we're gonna have to look

for some uh

symbols well you got some high beliefs

on the walls here but

oh he did that it's all right did it

contain such symbols

what's this big piece oh hold on I have

a thing in my inventory that I need to

apparently observe yeah

can I um

okay

how do I even describe what symbol is on

this thing right now can we open it

looks like a paint roller I guess but

why what how is that gonna help us in

any way shape or form I've had another

book and I guess a shovel and

um

um

okay

uh travel another book yeah

okay oh wait no that's the other one

there's here 101.

oh so you got one 101 and 102. this one

has numbers and more symbols

ah oh my gosh midweek Pizza thank you

for the two-month sub [ __ ] yeah

appreciate you

kind of funny uh

Okay so

like this looks dirty

oh yeah I see okay I have a brush I also

I feel like we should be able to use the

shovel somehow but like how question

mark

anyway

oh um oh a piece of

wait was that in your own yeah wait okay

I also found a piece of brick where do

we put it

I don't know

gather stuff I think the important

things might have symbols on the top of

it like a book

I gotta I gotta this thing hold on let

me show this and it's simple change when

I put it in that hole in the wall

oh wait okay

okay okay

wait how do I drop it

um like I just like like click that

somewhere there you go okay adopted at

your feet

oh let's see

that kind of looks like water

okay here we go

oh thanks

but there are some yeah it kind of looks

like water

wait what happens if you take that and

put it in the water over there

oh this water yeah

I thought that was just sand yeah I

called it sand before but yeah

uh hello oh well it did something

hey he gave uh

um I think oh we have to hear me oh

yeah

wait so what was his

there's a whole bunch of symbols here oh

yeah these are the numbers correlates

anything that's on the book yeah I I

found this thing with the same symbols

and numbers

yeah they they are the old uh

um old Egyptian numbers

they got something in the pot but I

don't know how to like can I break it

they're written interestingly so that's

do this oh cool

the tall one should be a thousand this

is where the ones your 100 still

okay let's see the Arches are 10 and

these lines are one and if I if I know

my head shift chain numbers

yeah the first one well we can yeah

literally everything that's weird but

when everything

how does this work had you

okay hold on thank you one

representation of numbers one two ten to

a hundred thousand

they get you the biggest Egyptian

numeral

additionally

individual symbols

um

are stacked together to farm numbers

their value is added as you can see the

phone oh ew it makes us do math

easy

oh yeah okay here you go you can have

this book

um

okay that's something else

oh yeah it's just

it's just that yeah

oh wait what's this

okay wait I can move this floor right in

that case they simply represents three

thousand

eight 400 wait I mean it's not what we

should say

okay

three thousand four hundred

and twenty six

oh look at that hey

look at you being smart so does that key

go to that chest thing here it looks

like yeah yeah

look treasure I mean yeah oh wait

there's a pyramid party yeah all right

I'll pick it up I'll put it in here okay

okay oh wait maybe we need the big piece

again because

um is there anything else

something about those coins

oh let me see

oh no it doesn't wait what happened can

I put that okay it has some circles

it's like a triangle and a circle on the

walls oh there's a piece there's a piece

of the permit inside this one vase I

think but I don't know how to like open

It or Break It Like is that a thing that

you can do it's a piece enough

bring up oh you had to how did you do

that with this one hold the click button

and then just let it go

oh it's heavy I guess there we go

okay okay

it's the shape of these machines there

are three of them

oh oh yay Amaze so we have to figure out

um

hey are those it's much fun I'm a

smartphone

it does man you are

good to see what's my exactness he said

they were yeah I know my I know my

Egyptian numbers

uh come and hieroglyphic sounds

and then we have following the

um foreign

matter

they got Arabic numerals on the coins

but I once said this marriage for some

reason

do I know the Arabic numerals shall we

enter from there and we exit from there

I guess we had to complete the puzzle

and whatever symbols We Touch is the

ones we put there is that how that works

the numbers

um one okay okay

that doesn't work

I actually don't know about the Arabic

numerals sadly

okay

um try the first one to be a a lion

the first the top one yeah

I don't like it okay and then

um

it kind of looks like a pair of pants

okay

I guess

um yeah then

hey a square

and yeah

I don't know what he says what what is

what is that I don't know what the hell

what at the near near the end or I don't

yeah I don't I don't know but either a

hand or a foot

a really long lead hand

oh there we go it was a hand

if any long and seen I don't know why I

need to sell these puzzles I could just

use my dragon breath to break the door

and then we can leave that would be that

would make life easier yeah

oh yeah more

okay um even determined I guess we do

like the other puzzle we try to go to

the middle

okay which one of these go into the

middle

[Music]

um

now

and now

oh yep

okay let's see let's take a look at that

okay

apparently that way you know

um that way that way that way that way

that way okay I recognize the foreign

I'm sorry wait it's it's one six four

seven I think oh

um I think okay I think we have this

spell B in in this weird language

[Music]

or do we spell it like this weird BJT

okay wait uh

um

uh um

to have a fight

I really like that oh yeah

J is the snake

and then what's the T

um

oh yeah a half circle

B18 okay I think yeah yeah that's a

weird way to say B oh there we go that

is a weird way to spell V

well I guess it's in the vowels implied

though

oh is that the way

Freedom what if you open that door first

I guess I guess I guess we did

I don't know maybe it's it's the

specifically programmed to be

uh

whichever whatever order you open and

it'll always be the same thing if you

put one no matter what door that makes

any sense at all so next episode next

episode

I guess that wasn't that bad it don't be

nice

shopping but so those coins were nothing

but I figured out what it said did I get

the number correct though

what oh this kind of reminds me of the

one place that I've been to so I was

like a huge like it kind of looked like

that one like

triangle thing that we put in the middle

and there's like a whole bunch of like

mummies and stuff that was all like and

it was not

what's this

a jar and it has a simple in here

oh with a key inside these these jars

have symbols on them this this looks

weird this looks like a bean okay

there's a buttons

wait what is it and these balls have

symbols on them too I guess these are

important yeah there are some balls over

here

I think the number represents I think

mass or something

oh this looks like so these Scrolls all

have different symbols on them this

looks like

okay I'm gonna put this in the middle

okay

all right now here's a note oh scroll I

know

I crawl back I have stumbled upon this

[ __ ] Mommy

again I have I have a thing called like

Father yeah

up up

wait hold on I can do something

I don't know I had a crowbar and then I

was walking around and then it attached

to this thing right here and they

represent north east south west oh

um I I have a I have a I have a compass

thing does this helps

meat uh

amazing

oh there's more there's more things with

symbols

I have no idea what I'm looking at I

assume every item is in some way

actually more thank you oh I could I

could do this I could do this too wait

did that work oh you can open the other

tomb with that okay

yeah

oh wait this is also a thing it's not

working

oh okay wait I wonder can I do it oh

I can open a whole bunch of stuff

how do I go to the other Scrolls in my

thing and

I think you just grew up

I can open all this uh scrolling this

yes and so

uh what's this

a face

wait what's the first thing for the tea

time well we'll do it now how do I um

I've got three Scrolls in my inventory

and I don't know how to scroll through

my Scrolls because they just like

stacked

um

yeah I don't know it's vaccines but

anyway

foreign

and it has it has a bathroom is that a

monkey head yeah it has a baboon Edge

all right that's my coins

um

do I need this is the curl bracket and

use it out here

oh

okay there's a lion and uh

a bag

so nothing about the uh

intestines there's a line and back on it

a lot of lungs

in the back

okay

says shovel

what's this thing

oh okay

wait wait can I okay all right now

okay

hey

[Music]

if we find I got this this this two more

heads is

and

I guess

um this thing is pretty tough

I didn't mean to break the base

oh

but since this girl doesn't have an icon

doesn't mean that it's really useless

every school scroll has an actual clue

There's an actual clue to it all right

so I do this

oh this one actually might

can you guys like if I'm looking at

something and you see it like hovering

by my hands can you actually like click

the little thing thing to see what I'm

seeing

oh yeah yeah yeah

okay how do I do this let's see this

this these are the hearing clips

hieroglyphs yeah don't ask me this

yes

we cannot look at it and when you stop

looking

um oh okay sorry no it's fine I didn't

figure anything out

are you making the same shape as this

one over here

am I supposed to get that corner

I don't think

oh gosh there's this as well

um

wait

can I do it this way can you just

so

is this

I'm always missing a corner

um

yeah

that

oh

wait repeat

I think

the thing you're trying to do

okay

oh whoops I didn't actually mean to put

that in my inventory

okay

okay okay

are you winning do you need help

um I keep missing the corner

you have to get it like completely lit

up everywhere

and I don't think it is possible to do

that

but it has to be

I think I think it is impossible to do

it

you can't feel it except two lines it's

the uh

well you can go over lines yes you've

already been over there oh that doesn't

do anything good then this this this oh

yeah yeah I I see I I think I know what

it is

yeah

let me try

okay

probably start down here okay

oh and the basis with symbols here we go

they have nice

cow it doesn't even look done no but if

you look to your right

all right you might find something

here

webs yeah

what's interesting

um we have a height

okay so um

all right where does this go maybe put

it in the scale wait wait wait wait wait

wait that makes me think of something I

have balls that has numbers

um yeah no wait not can I take you I

like your balls I think I have six seven

eight simple

um

number and

number okay

oh yeah yeah oh I see eyes wait where

did you find those okay um and that's

what the numbers was over here and then

the ones with the symbols was um

down here oh what they obviously have to

yeah balance them in the scales

right now okay so that so yeah so that

represents two

so we said this one to two

ah I think yeah yeah and then if we put

the thingy there oh that's that's it no

I just put

um

oh that's a lot

um what's the lottery numbers oh wait

that one seems how did it jump all the

way out there and let's put it down

it's meant back there you go I'm taking

it a 25 away but it jumps back

the owl symbol thing is one two three

five five I think six yeah that should

be six rights

hold on

yeah

you go there

okay now we need to find a feather

looking thing somewhere

to put in anubis's other hand

oh it was fine

yeah a jackal lady oh yeah you're

supposed to

yeah you're supposed to put this one

here so that becomes six and then you

put the D3 in here and then you see um

yeah

it can be beautiful city

there's this going like yeah

two beans

huh

oh yeah yeah we got yeah wait I got the

paper for that and it says

stomach

can I make quick is that which one

system is that the bean

this one yeah

human is liver

um

is intestine

yeah

it is kind of you

oh yeah and so that's one of them

um I'm guessing this one's this one

so I think

it's because of this I think it's in

here how do we how much is this

one we have to press the buttons in the

particular order I think oh wait hold on

this one has some symbols it has two

feathers and then this one has a lion

but this one has a beetle

this and this

hey

yeah

maybe we have to switch the monkey in

the human yeah all right and

yeah yeah you got the notes wait why is

these things why are those things cold

in the corners

baby things like gold on the corners is

that

oh no what's this

okay now they are all

and like maybe we had to be maybe they

had to be on a certain spot on these

things

Maybe

oh wait where did my where did that

Circle thingy

what Circle where

um

oh bad thing

oh the compass the second thing to come

back oh yeah

oh yeah because the note says I wish

that yeah the

maybe this has a face certain ways I

don't

yeah yeah it's it said that certain

things should be interested in their

directions okay that way this corner is

in

this one no is it nice it's what so

which one should be nice

I don't know no sense that but I did

is there any papers oh

there's this one as well

but I don't understand it oh wait

that'll answer Guided by happy the

baboon God representing the North

wait does that mean that okay that one

that one stays okay all right is that

we're cleaning up here

so oh wait that that's not right no this

one's not right but this one goes yeah

but they need to match the uh

here

I think

at the jackal headed God representing

the East uh which one what's the East Ah

that's what the compass is for this

thing goes yeah whoops

here

here I think

perfect oh nice then you put that in

anubis's hand behind you

okay

there you go he's um

okay that was kind of tough

it was

very much so but yeah I think we did it

in time because when I looked at the

timer there was still three minutes left

okay next episode

I'm having some chicken nuggets with it

like

some Rocket Man

20

. maybe if we get like really really

stuck

oh

nah I don't think we'll get stuck we

will find a way

um

wait these these dog heads kind of look

a little weird they have these red

things in weird spots this one's like at

the bottom and this one's at the second

oh yeah they're in different places

hi

um wait

what if you hold this at the second or

ninth day and then yeah I guess but at

the same time yeah

oh that seems to be too easy okay that

one was kind of really easy

oh what's this large pyramid

something in here these things have

jelly beans in them

I suppose you have to break it open then

yeah

whoops

oh hey did you think that these things

with jelly beans has something to do

with this thing

oh probably okay okay

which is bigger that one's the biggest

oh no that was nice

okay let me just count them

the really big one has three jelly beans

yeah and then this one has

um one two three four five six oh hey I

found something eight

I found it huh

the middle one has eight yes and a small

small one has at one two three

four five

at seven

yeah

okay I guess I guess we don't need this

anymore

okay it is golden and it's

an artifact I kiss wait you found

something what did you find huh did you

break it I found this whoops like that

okay this thing has symbols on it and

that's what I found yeah thank you

that's the hardest thing yeah

one day

oh what's this

Notepad

uh there's notepad oh hey it has the

thing that you found on it oh yeah yeah

and it says to put it in a bowl

oh the burning Bowl okay not Apple I'm

gonna oh yeah

I suppose a little Ram thing as well

right okay I I think so that's what it

says

if it says there's five of them

what and what more was it

um yes this thing has uh symbols all

over it some of them have squares on

them

had a key

oh is it for that oh no it's not for

this

this one yeah probably the one behind us

goblet is that on that little thing as

well that little paper thing yeah

what's this

pink and red

yeah

and an actual bean candy

there we go

huh

ah

um

okay what's this thing

this has a a head on it oh yeah yeah the

thing

oh wait maybe

nothing

it was the first one I managed to solve

with my own brain for once that goes in

there

two

[Music]

that red three

um

one two three perfect oh and then you

see let's put that in there too

is that right now

as opposed to using someone else's brain

yes exactly

wait that was it now let's see

the second one was harder than that

being cannot do that then I'm an

ancients issue then we we did some beans

where we were exploring that yeah next

episode

Crash Bandicoot tacos in ancient Eve

yeah those Egyptian tacos

chamber of danger

ooh oh it's nighttime

um oh yeah

can I pick it up oh bam

come here little bug come out the hole I

want to pick you up

it had a token on it come pick up a bug

I can't yeah

thank you thank you what's the point the

hydrate

um

huh

and then the chipmunk voice is never I

don't even know how it happens

yeah yeah that looks like that

her Shadow is weird

hey wait what are these what are the

knobs what do you do with them where do

you put them sorry I got there probably

um

oh yeah yeah in the

oh in here in here no in here

okay

okay

oh here we got the other oh cool

that's cool

I just put them in on your size but

that's

that's the answer

it must be uh I put him

I got that open too

yeah

that doesn't say anything but then how

do I change there oh it says that if you

click it I don't know let's put time

there oh wait it says

how do you rotate them

oh LOL I'm smart constellations this

might be a constellation which is

written on this thing is that not I said

I'm missing something I want to catch

you on my stream yes

I got there there and the broken one oh

I think I saw this one

oh yeah

that's it wait how

it's fine never change it never and

what's this oh wait what's this I

pressed that okay

I think you know what a knob is easy me

so that's amazing I guess you got that

one too oh oh we both got our thing at

the same time that what happened

so this thing came up oh okay

okay

oh there we go there you go

constellation

um

that's cool

same or

what if we do

what do you mean like that little man

let's see permanent

and

um

that's just the chip

um there's dots in the sky

is it

is in this game and there are

constellations

their constellations in the sky right I

mean I know it's your stars but the way

they are

taped their shape no constellation

is that looks like that one

l

I know

it looks like that

I guess we had to like push the buttons

on these for what we see up there

oh yeah

so that one hit that one looks like it's

okay

and

a fish or a

h

at least you're like a little bit of

that oh he was having looking up does

something have you tried looking under

there oh my God I know what you're

trying to do pizza I'm not gonna fall

for it haha you're very funny

I think that one's that way

and I'm gonna take a guess bye

nothing happened

there's supposed to be

so yeah and you would know

if you had your oh wait it's that one

exactly

what

ah and they take a guess

Oh yay what's the middle thing even

anything the song

okay middle thing with some puzzles yeah

I missed that part while I was busy

it like opened up a bunch of stuff

the body ship stuff

oh I guess we're done with that one

Oh yay

um I guess the

that was the warm up

you're trying to call aliens yeah

extraterrestrials

speaking of painting

I'm making tea Awakening

uh

wait what is is that a pillow

I guess it is there's attack get back

there

all right

I got a wrench

headphones

no put them down it's a dog hologram

it's it's aha

okay

wait

yeah

oh oops

oh there's just a floating shot of glass

that's not dangerous at all

as a lever

well what's this

if you can't take the dog hologram with

you're not allowed to leave oh no

okay yeah bring the dogs with you

his name is Rufus and he's the goodest

boy is there is there anything about a a

power system

uh

uh there's an emergency activation

protocol

use the emergency compact marked

like electricity symbol what's with

other dogs

this has it this has a a lightning bolt

symbol right there look at it look at it

okay

I put it on the bed

oh yeah sorry

I can't think

um

at the same time systems a b and c need

to be connected

I'm coming

so apnc disappeared

like this

now

um

now

best

now

wait oh there's different way there's

different APS oh there's nothing under

there

I need to find an ABC that

better

ABC

yeah hi lyron thank you for the hydrate

will do

[Music]

yeah

I look at it

okay thanks for the shout out he needs

they need power he needs powerful

at the same time systems

did nothing for me okay

because of the Moon Voyage

because wait do I just do Moon voice

great

oh I found a an airplane with the we're

going to the history of flight

who do I put that I feel like that's

important to be somewhere

another one

[Music]

oh

I can put it in stress someone really

needs to remind me of the stream to fix

my Clips I don't know why they're all

high-pitched

and this

oh I got it

perfect oh everything everything okay

well she takes gravity hey look there's

a

there's a rocket too this is just I've

had a trophy nothing

here

oh yeah

able to open the briefcase that way oh

hey look I found a toolbox and a robot

let's see if you can log into the

computer we probably need the password

for this

um okay

and gracious sister am I open this is

anything else I can I found Tools

digital pen

okay okay these are just okay where's

the where's the garbage you can so

cabbage can two yes

silly

I don't think they need pads

um

get ready check

I didn't need to trap it in the trash

nothing in there

I don't know what you need to do with

the tools but I found tools

and this is

wait does one of them look like a

triangle

yeah like a triangle yes yes because I

think it goes here oh hey

activate emergency protocol

um

[ __ ] [ __ ] hey if it looks like an e oh

wait what's this

I found a battery and a picture

are you gonna Spruce oh my God pizza

fuckles

and I mean that lovingly

oh all right and I do this I look I love

you to the Moon and back

it says that this racket is since

hydrates

bracket

that doesn't I should have deceived all

right it's because I'm using a different

way of displaying their attire at the

moment a digital pen

is refund the outfit changes hey I found

a screw

I don't know what what to do with it but

I found one that's cute it's got like a

hexagon on it a bad Pizza

oh no no if it changes yes I mean I I

guess I could wear

no I can't make enough switching yes

oh battery hold on I can put this in the

little little robot I found wait I

should be able to by anyway the trophy

has a circle because how do I but it

would be an even more manual process at

the moment not that one

there we go

Let's ignore that Let's ignore it

okay oh I got it that was

I just

I just kind of hit a bunch of buttons

yeah I found a I don't know if you need

this but there's this guy starting

we had each word Starship company we'd

like to welcome you to this new ship

design okay he has batteries

operatable system

okay now I have three batteries

three yeah

um oh also I'm gonna uh the corroded

that battery but I don't think this is

necessary for anything I don't think

that one's a kid battery not contrasting

windows

all right

okay yeah so it's the control of the

door that is

there something over here oh wait what's

this

emergency door unlock protocol in the

case of dark malfunction the ship is

equipped with an emergency door back

into some EDM it's located left to the

door

um

red idiom sensor malfunction override

required PC attachment attachment a the

PC be used to activate the override in

room Control software you I require to

press the door icon

five times okay

oh I guess I know where the battery is

going now

so now you can do the there we go

battery

um

it reminds me of No Man's Sky sitting

here

oh yeah

never played no one's crying myself so

well

um

everything is awesome yeah that's not

dangerous at all what's this a drone why

do we have a drone

I like it

how to select it

oops wasn't me okay

there's a gas container

and a card programmer yeah we know him

probably my drone here

and uh this

if I do this

insert cards okay

oh there we go

I found a

this

I don't know what that is but I found it

I think right so that allows anyone to

handle them

[Music]

important

I like connecting pins there was

something with that

I wonder do I put that in here

fine

okay

um where does this one go

I think I have an extra okay I have an

extra for that

oh here we go instructions

a card

connector pin

up

you can configure three instruction

slots each that's consists of three

parts

later what does that means

the first cell with Solomon's second

first okay oh

by mistake left

the gas container

myth oh no

the screws for later I don't know what's

confusing about that oh my God

I guess I can't be enough

um I think we're missing I think we're

missing something so yeah here uh we've

got some

foreign

[Music]

hey

you need to be released because no one's

smoking that room

good thing none of us are smokers I

guess

and

my dragon breath is in fire related

oh hey I found another card

[Music]

can I put it in here

that's enough

I see another one of these no I didn't

want to take the kind I want to leave

today

zero point zero yes

based on this pattern but I don't know

if it's

which

is me releasing the guests in such an

enclosed room do I also have the metal

synthesizer instructions

maybe that one's still whoops

we need to make metal

or we got another path

can I can I

put this somewhere

metal

you can place it in the cabinet here I

guess

oh oh there we go I put something in

there

oh I guess we put like the middle wait

oh um I think the one that that that

that that that that that that

thing is for this one

so we add

oh yeah yeah yeah

how does that work

uh

you have more metal oh here's my battle

something wrong

recipe yeah

there's multiple different recipes yeah

that's that's one

that's a good place yes

and I got the metal making instructions

there I'm thinking how does this work

okay let's see oh

um I don't know if that's helpful for

the other thing or not you can configure

three instruction slots each slide

consists of two parts

feel tight oh okay okay I see that's me

Bella salad note this down where's the

red card okay

zero tonight

right

channel here

okay that's how I take to insert the red

cards oh I see the red one wait I have

another blue one as well I don't know if

that's oh yeah that helps that helps

okay

blank metal blank metal

that helps a lot okay good good stash

and now and another red card

okay or if you have another blue all

right yes yes

oh for [ __ ] sakes I'm sorry

can I just there you go

what if I do this

oh it goes down there

now let's reset everything that's how it

should be

and then

sometimes you'll be like that

here we go

with him

all right it's supposed to be

okay so I do that that all right let's

do this

why wouldn't imagine Escape but it could

be so complicated yeah that's a good

question

things like diagram and schematics 11

recipes uh yeah that's that too that

sounds a good point

but they want us to not Escape that's

that's actually why one two three okay

they have a value of escaping so they

don't get in trouble

okay

I I still have this drone I just I don't

know what to do with it I made a drone

thruster oh here uh 800. oh yeah and

then you should have it and then you

should have the cone which is everything

except the Moon

um

the same way you did but with the chorus

I think

then

uh

yes a drone Thruster radio like this

if I put it in somewhere oh

right

oh whoops hold on

something though like that

and drunk

some got those two parts now

sorry yeah

how do you do this oh you drag it yeah

oh

beautiful

isn't it beautiful

it lives oh

yeah they started that door

don't step in front of them as they say

oh maybe behind you as well just like

turn it around oh yeah okay oh wait

there's a thing on the Trap

I'm sure it wasn't expensive okay

no one's all right yeah okay and destroy

everything yeah

we should leave soon yeah

ah that must be what this is for where

is it

oh good night nice

hold up okay

um I need a key card

oh we still need to get this key card to

have stuff on it

that's right oh yeah the key card is now

valid so

I don't remember so we can insert it

there

wait what's this story what's sister oh

wait there's a thing here

oh you found it how are you moving

around after we finish the thing that

you I I think yeah you click the state

button uh I got you next

that one was tough you can't wait did I

actually hide it whenever it was

redeemed I don't remember okay thank you

for the follow KitKat

okay thank you

anytime

okay what's this oh

aluminum the sodium hydroxide is sodium

aluminate

plus hydrogen I guess we don't need the

hydrogen just that by products oh okay I

found sodium hydroxide whatever that is

storage space

any aluminum waste on the ship to

produce sodium aluminum aluminum anyone

to combine uh illuminate I think it's

illuminate

huh even soda cans can help it's simple

to make

a metal recycling which I assume we can

find soda cans oh

I found sink

oh I I thought I can't yeah I better

start again

we put it in here

oh wait this so myself continue in the

recycling what was this

let me put them

verification

it looks like a Roomba okay I'm gonna

put this over here I don't know what

that is combine what was it uh sodium

a sulfur

and you finally pick it it is

enough replicating artificial organisms

using the following s-i-l-n-h

right okay

a donut

I'm gonna put this over here

I'm gonna put this over here I think

it's uh

wait

um

and helium sings

red white

oh wait anything just classes okay hold

on I I think I might know the code for

that why

yeah

Buenos Dias

I'm not sure any part of combined

because it's only got one it's not when

he's got two slots

five six seven eight

maintenance yeah I'm doing terrible at

all good morning glasses I think this is

too much I just have work

oh

do these colors have anything to do with

this notepad here and are manually why

what is scanner meant to be doing is it

there's a keypad thing over here and I

found like these colors

well it was the single age of greens

here they were 100 is the highest score

oh hold on hold on maybe this little

robot has what we're looking for where

the [ __ ] is the robot there it is it's

too much

and then

we don't need to call that oh it has

numbers

but when it is Aluminum okay zero three

but that's a bit too much

oh yeah no

in Greek well what I thought it was was

incorrect uh

oh the scanner I think it has something

to do with those but the white there's

too many white huh oh one two three so

if you have a Dominion you should be

able to put it in this oh wait hold on

aluminum being the cans yeah

so if you put a cat can assume

yeah try three two four

maybe three two four yeah okay no try

one two

four two

also no okay I try uh three three three

wait three two three yeah

no okay

um that's weird

do I do I had them uh let's see one two

three four five

six seven eight so this is a

two I shouldn't okay

four that's eight that's but that's too

much there's too many whites

that makes it 11 and that you can't put

11 in there

eight eight

I don't know uh eight eight two eight

maybe at the light

I want to say what what did I say uh

eight eight two eight maybe eight sorry

two eight no

14. I feel like it has something to do

with these eight wow these are colors

five eight one

sorry all right five eight one

no

yes

one two three

three

carbon oxygen

oh wait okay that's where we're supposed

to

start being presentation

they did not have anything I have put a

can in the thing and I created something

that's what we need

sodium eliminate free we need to be

needed for some ways waves are hard you

can then Maybe

now

this is weird

yeah this is

the best element because it's named

after podon it was discovered by none

other than Madi Curie

or

Squad

if you want this well

anything else with colors

foreign

uh

you too

do we need helium

something is there only three are we

missing one

yeah oh okay

that's the only thing that makes sense

for this one it's just those

the molecular

we're not missing one somewhere right

hey if you hit the Zed button you zoom

oh cool

um

okay

here let's go

what are these

I don't know I don't think they're ready

for anything

this one's tough uh

now let's see

I feel like he has to be something for

this

it's probably both

No it should be this part

oh hold on it said we needed water right

yeah I think so can you like fill the

bottle now okay okay oops

oh

I guess not

I'm just I just mess around here and

right there oh nitrogen sodium

illuminates that there you go that's why

we need it

what did I say nitrogen okay

nitrogen yeah no why do we have nitrogen

but

you have do you have nitrogen

are the flasks kept yeah maybe I can

take that off

oh no what why why why wouldn't that why

would that be a thing the point of a

flask

there has three that has two and this

has three

so

that has four that has four and that has

three mile doesn't have much

it has two that has two that has

hold on maybe I'll have a difference of

one

I don't

oh wait

yeah

try to

um

kill

three

three

perfect oh hell yeah how did you figure

that out

um this one has two Reds on it where the

other one has three Reds on it and then

this one has three whites for the other

one has four and then

um

one of them has three blue yeah and this

one has three blues where the other one

has two so I just did the difference

noted

look at you being super smart

oh they're going to spend out numbers

like that okay so now I

oh

okay

oh whoops

oh

they're doing things oh

yeah one three

oh wait hold on

oh

wait what's that l04 does that mean

anything to anyone

um wait

another 19.

this answer oh wait hey there's that oh

there's a token here okay

um

whoops

what happens

oh no

I put out the fire with the with the

water

quick

and bye

okay what are you trying to do with that

um

this

thing is really spelling I can't get in

there

uh nine through ten I have heat

um

maybe what maybe I have a cap maybe the

drunk I don't know what to do with it

but I have a cap

oh we got my standing there

in the kitchen

oh well I opened up this little this

hole here

should we put the

ah hold on I think we need something's

Baltic on this hook

why not

hello

I need to fix

it's ten oh this yeah

oh wait hold on I think I can

put this somewhere maybe it goes in

maybe it goes there

yeah and then maybe the remote does a

thing

I just don't know how to

see

but that's cool controller

hi

I think you have to turn it around and

go inside the hook

can I click on that well it's oh there

you go I don't know what I did hey I

picked you up and I put you in the hole

yeah we need nitrogen so that's it

thanks yeah

oh and now you're back out of the hole

what really yeah

oh wait oh now you're back in the hole

I'm confused

going in and out of the hole huh

how's it going

I don't know I can't I think that I

think I think right the robot thing got

stuck

hey come on spring

oh

it's

it's moving it is there's more

codes

you see

right over here see oh oh

zero four

yeah I I can see that too

I think you have to go down the tube

it is like an opening to the right

because you're going into the other room

with the with the with the rabbi yeah

and do with this yeah once I'm in here

you're going to the other room and find

the

um I think

okay hold on good night

uh

can I see

how are you good and you

have you been Pluto

can I see

oh my God pizza please

okay bye

okay

um

we got bunnies and

cat box dragon

wait yeah we sound like we're a line up

to a joke it's like a cat Fox a bunny

and a dragon so I'm stuck in a ship

someone says

do you think what does that mean I don't

know how's it going how does the

controlling of the robot I was trying to

control the robot but the robot wasn't

moving

on the robot

and let's start

okay let's let's exit the menu

and I'll reload it

oh okay let's try reloading we were in

Bangla right right okay okay sure and

then we have to be super fast

um so what was the code for the thing

again

he probably random he probably have to

figure it out again

okay I need to find this thing

so and then

um yeah I need Penny and another one

if that goes here here we go I need to

find the other ones there we go

okay

speed speed okay

um

so white so white is four

aluminum and sodium four three

two point two two two four three two

four three

three eight right

right

I know it's three

yeah that's three

four one two three four and that was

three right three

just two three three

okay

what is

okay there we go

do we need a fire for anything we need

that oh yeah right drinking the fire too

we'll turn it on I'm gonna do this

oh yeah for the robot

okay

and uh

yeah

this thing

wait how did you how did you open this

I'm not

oh eight eight one zero is that how you

don't know

how did you unlock this

fine

one equals one oh I don't know it was

unlocked when I picked it up oh

do you want me to unlock it for you

it is one three six

one

twenty six oh okay thank you

okay now that goes into there yeah

Hey Mickey

not sorry I haven't and outfit doesn't

work in this what you need to do right

now

I'm sorry about it

I have

code only can be eight seconds

this time

up to make an earring work properly hey

there's a there's a token in there

knock out the people leg

how would you like a table the thing

hello in the Drone of the Drone

that's a happy pink stuff okay I just

lost connection

well how did that help us though

we can take it can you read interesting

okay I got nature

thank you guys

perfect I don't know but what do we mean

to do with nitrogen we might see the

crystal

okay so this is broken oh it's going to

be a bit more did you did you do the

combination thing with the aluminum

I think Pom-Pom did it yeah okay yeah

let me see if I can make the

projector

no this isn't working that's the

notification

[Music]

um

nothing in here Rihanna

um

but it's not this is not the part with

that

I can't she can't read

I mean this needs

I must definitely have this

yeah now I'm working the correct me

around here

good good

oh yeah yeah

and there

oh nice

we still continue

Crystal damage neutralized

freedom freedom

about that

yeah I don't even know how he did that

I'm gonna be yeah same here this was

teamwork for once someone has a big rain

yeah I was I was messing around with the

computer and mixing elements and stuff

uh decompression while you were messing

with the robot and stuff ah it's like

use safety protocols we have a key oh

a fuse

an interesting

this is

let's try this you need to stay safe do

to do that you probably should not do

the following barbecue Smiles use a

spoon to unfastened screws and open the

door to the out to the air

wait

yeah and I use this too

this isn't what not to do

first digit is what I am floating on

another fuse another fuse and what was

this

TI about a safety tether that says tea I

landed operating temperature lost we

only have one suit anyway

oh and these have the fuse values on it

and this time it's ten thousand

different combinations

okay

um well it says maintenance thing uh we

had to follow the safety protocols

oh too big

I have two now fishing but it's on the

on the fishing that's not it's not

because we have to use it units for

pressure it should be Pascal surface

oh

service

temperature sensor oxygen sensor

temperature wait 15.

what the heck is what I'm floating on

why does he keep hold on what is what is

what is the center for oxygen

good reviews

so you need and how to

base oh also 50.

but this

doesn't do anything I remember this one

oh you've done this before potato

who did you do this

is it like anywhere where there's safety

protocols or anything like yeah like

things not to do there's safety ruins at

least oh

number one barbecue s'mores is there

anything about private games bars

starting a fire in chamber is not okay

so three because you need fire to do

small sorry

so three uh use a spoon to unfashion

screws

uh

uh peanut open hatch doors

oh wait that one must be five open the

door to Erica so

um three

something five

three something five

use the right tool for the job oh at

three eight five

when where for that what yeah this thing

this thing okay all right for that one

there

I don't think that way

was there any

boy what's up

um no oh sorry it's 385.

at three eight five

there we go

yeah we need

oh wait I saw I saw what this goes It

goes here

and

I didn't want to just pull out like that

right

there you go that's the one

oh

no please oh

foreign

modules

[Music]

they had and stuff wow that sounds

complicated yeah okay so we should just

oh boy math yeah we love math because

we're totally good at that okay yeah

yeah

um so I don't think we need this anymore

um

how do we readjust the pressure is that

what we're trying to figure out yeah

there you go that was easy

must be nice being good at math

what just happened I like that was those

things going up and down up and down

thanks

what did you do what did that do

oh oh 19 and a half degrees that's

that's pretty cool nice stuff not cool

that's nothing that's a nice room

temperature

I'm happy with that we need four

numbers

this one yeah so the only thing I know

is oops didn't mean to drop that uh the

temperature should be 15 but that's I

don't know what the heck they mean by

what I'm standing on what I'm floating

on I mean

so it's the second number is four

we're floating on

the spaceship this thing oh D5 oh

standard

what I'm floating braiding temperature

last decimal

four five

yeah four four

and

the second digit of what I'm floating on

oh

what did you get the first digit from

uh this story

the default

at least two wait is it two like that

how is that what we

I don't know if we were floating on it

did you find some purpose some

instructions oh wait no the first digits

of two and the second digit is an eight

eight five

I think so three four eight five yeah oh

yeah here you go

have this and have these times

a power supply look

oh screw we need this screwdriver

and the days

and this

oh

that one oh yeah you got to understand

I've got two twenty ones

20 fuses

all right

um I have 4 15 a 25 and a 30.

hey how does this work

s

don't let me interrupt you

but what what number do they need

oh wait

2020 [ __ ] fast pressure okay

catch I don't even know what number they

need

if I said 15 and they said 15. when

putting downstairs can you take those up

again I said there's a servant okay

and then use those again

wait where's that where's that pressure

what's that data pad for the numbers

put them

and see see how it goes

back

now but you have more of those what I

didn't yeah I have a I have a 13 a 25.

okay so here they are let's see

uh so exit hatch needs 25.

little power supply thing went also

that's seven oh seven perfect now we

have the helmets on nothing wait what

just happened

am I am I really

accidentally exit door needs exit

25. 25 can I take it out of this thing

or maybe

okay there you go there we go and then

click

Freedom yes

see them because you can't have too much

money apparently

I don't even know what happened

throughout all that

power supply thing on your belt looks so

weird

that's

why it's so far

another keypad

a button

a b c e

it's really hard to see

yeah it is a little bit I was thinking

that too hey I think

um

hitting that oh pliers

content okay

a note for the captain we didn't have

the luck replacing this used keypad we

will replace it with a new one when we

got to the it to the base also just a

reminder the keypad still accepts

passwords only in

sending order okay okay I did some wires

yeah I'll say okay I don't know if I did

them right

not more wires

don't lifters

I don't know if I can do this

I'm gonna take a guess that goes back

and then oh this the way they move is so

Eerie

all right

guys now this manually secondary sensor

match control units blue red yellow

green blue red yellow green

blue oh

so do you have some

ah

I think I just did the wires

display famous Maybe

there we go it's the same wire is

complete so

do we have some

I have to read when I send that angle

um hey I picked up a thing above us

but but

oh yeah yeah this one uh oh he dropped

it yeah that one is a famous part

battery yes we

I guess we need a new battery for it but

seemingly yeah three both or one

I don't know uh so he said

don't drop it on my head ah oop sorry

I'm just gonna get off of that

oh

uh I found a Laser Source

oh

yeah there's had buttons that were

really worn out

oh

how did you okay I just hit the buttons

in the sending the order

which I thought was

seven five three two but this actually

two three five seven

or anything

it was charged most likely

uh so it's missing a piece right I just

found this thing just like it was oh

hold on

it was fun to try oh wait I think this

goes what is that oh

yeah you can put that in in there now

right okay all right so now I have a

good battery

all right so how do we

I'll put it back I guess

just gets like sucked up all right there

you go

all right you see me cat Fox

magnetically

what I said yeah yes

things so you have these you have one

legs and which needs some numbers

no one's phone

it's some kind of instruction

some

notes or something

no I found an ABCD note thingy right

here it says hatchback system schematic

it looks weird

oh yeah let me

get it oh primary tank Center is down

take status manually yeah

available I can't see any numbers

matching up

catch controls

it depends on what kind of mean you're

in this

I don't it's which can be a bit quick

picky about the internet

I don't

and okay I huh

l i x and what's l i x and n

oh wait

oh yeah

okay you can take these yeah why why

bunk me what did I do I'm innocent okay

that's supposed to go there

oh wait

no oh it seems appropriate wow I think

we're missing some

we can

move some from the other things into

that one can't we

yeah but I don't know how to open the

other ones

I said this has something to do with

feel deaf I don't ever

I see

oh

there's something about the hatch but it

doesn't

say anything oh wait sensors

ah

let's see secondary taxi reading

does that mean anything to you

um

maybe all of these had to equal time

when not space but

oh there's a paper wait pen pen you did

the other computer thingy really really

super quick yeah

okay do you know how to do this one

if I had some numbers to go at home I

have no numbers at the moment I can use

um

it says IX is half of the stuff

hold on

I access half and it needs to be 12.

no hey

when did you read the I Axis and then ah

yeah here I know again

it has equal 12. and oh and it's a third

and oh that's two sides

oh come on

yeah that didn't work

am I bringing backing

okay

no way all right my brain isn't working

yours there you go that's the amount is

supposed to be that's on the second one

oh one five three one all right

apparently my brain isn't working

hey there we go I found some more metal

parts

oh there we go you were close yeah my

brain wasn't worse

obviously obviously it should be four

because I think he said we did something

but but yeah I found that those I

unlocked that

hey how did you find the number for it

it was on it was on this on on a sticky

note at the back of that

yeah that was oh silly yeah

that we need to do

um see maybe a Houston on the second one

maybe oh no

I have anything that goes sideways okay

okay so I got the piping here oh wait oh

man can we turn it oh we can't do

anything don't we need to unlock

this once we can oh wait wait oh we

can't turn them

uh often they're already inside okay you

have to hit the exactly

yeah yeah

and then we take a straight key thing

and we put it back here

okay

I think

or space okay space party

I don't do anything

wait how do we unlock these other ones

how did you unlock these two first

already I didn't unlock I I don't know I

just removed the panel it was already it

was already unlocked

it was it was already unlocked I don't I

don't know

I think they unlock when we sold stuff I

don't know wait there's some

uh

wait so what do we have unlocked at the

moment

um

I've got a and c I did that field tank

monitor thing and then we did

uh okay great oh we need a we did we

need an hatch hatch them so a b c d 0 1

2 3 other tonight

three we have a

oh maybe that's what this is for

a

great hatch for it

that's four five

four is

um

wait a ten that doesn't make sense

hatch 3 is C

zero six

catch one is

zero fourteen

right

you cannot get it

zero yeah we might need to open in some

way unlocked it

you know oh it was for this big metal

thingy

oh heck yeah uh this has note

there's a a locket

note

hi loves how you is

foreign

assessment

a patient embodies a strong

understanding of Melody and language

unfortunately this is where my phrase of

ends a love of

The Authority combines

with

a complete lack of benevolence

yeah mostly examine suggests combative

personality and destruction

um suspicious

these words are like darker than the

others

I don't know what that means any okay

okay I think these books are dead Melody

language lovers not

variety lack of benevolence combative

distracting

pregnenology

and knowledge

oh if if you find that found a hat

uh yeah

I yeah apparently I'm a magnify oh hello

there's something in here

do you know the time when military

language

badminatory

backpack

I wonder if there's like another clip

that this is supposed to go with

okay is there any more clues anymore

what

okay I think yeah

oh the pendulum thing is here pump on

I'm gonna drop it by you there on the by

your feet

on a newspaper

and that's me oh wait yeah

there we go

IQ

IQ

IQ

can I can I make another change no I

could hide it

yeah okay five

yeah that's what I wanted to do

IQ

oops

and that's something else

oh wait IQ here what what is the numbers

there I don't know I I don't know where

the numbers are

this is IO thank you

another paper

a question where I found the odd one out

but I would assumed snake because that

doesn't have four legs so two

one two four eight sixteen and thirty

two wait that's C yes so 2C which Q

matches on the phone on phone not that

one

not more

as three matches

thank you eight but not two three so two

c three

two three

two

three yeah

oh nice

um let's see oh hey this has the

oh oh where's that other clue that I had

that had all those like words that were

like

oh here okay because I think I I think

it goes with this

yeah okay um Can can you read that and

I'm gonna look at this

see what would the words say yeah the

the ones that are dark yeah Melody

language reality and language

Love Of Love not Authority so Melody is

I guess music it's Melody music

yes

and then language

um

penguins

verbal Talent is that language

that seems me correct

79 wait are we adding them oh yeah okay

I got ahead yes what it is starts from

start Melody which number was that uh

hold on do we add them yeah no you got

the hint

so Melody what the language no music you

said which number

Melody and language so yeah I think we

add them do we no let's just say the

numbers oh and six

three fix me

okay what's the next one

uh love of novelty and sorry not

notoriety

lack of benevolence

can we take one at the time

five five eight

five eight

okay and then

combative and destructive no no

like that is another one or two little

maybe we do add them all right peanut

how you is if we add them then musical

talent and incredible thing would be

will be nine

because the picture you see is a hand

and

latest specific

as if we add musical talent and variable

then it'll equal nine

it should I be added

I don't know how many how many are you

allowed to push here as many as possible

it should be a switch okay it's good and

you all just woke up from load shedding

so booting up can relate you know

happy happy waking electricity hours

because it said minus wait it said minus

printed benevolence right so doing not

add eight

maybe we don't do eight

you want do you want to switch

okay here you go

I'll try again let's see how many okay

let's start from a start hey oops

okay we got ten minutes

self-esteem hopefulness

then you can add you can push all the

buttons yeah

okay you start with me sir you said

Melody so miss Cortana

so that would be six

checks okay six which is six six

not nine yeah but that should be six to

seven points yeah

mm-hmm

and then he said language language yeah

and the only one that would be

verbal talents three

yeah three there you go like last time

love of not notoriety never yeah that's

that's five it's I don't even know what

that means it's the exact same phrase

here so

maybe they didn't know what it means

hello

okay at five three six yep yes

then lack of benevolence lack of

benevolence

oh yeah lack of benevolence super

Netherlands is eight but using lack of

the benevolence so skip everything so we

don't do eight yeah that sounds like a

good idea

okay don't do eight that was the last

one

I think it's nine right sorry and then

combative and destructive oh yeah nine

those are combined yeah right

oh we didn't yeah we had to skip eight

yeah that was the solution so you got

them basically everything yay

you know

okay so it was no a

yeah it was Library yeah you had a good

idea there with yipping it

okay

um clack

uh statues

uh we need a key

butterfly painting number two

eight okay okay I'll try that then what

did you say

one eight seven six

uh one

eight

there's no there's a seven seven

eight

no no

one eight seven six now that didn't work

I'm trying to this is

that's a year

yeah there's 18. so anyway uh to get

five I have pressed the four key so I

said this is one

to get nine I have to press this zero

again but I can't set this to cereal so

that's not going to be decipher right

now

or I can just insert the number oh wait

unless there was a buzz up of the

numbers from the top into the this

thingy no there's no different numbers

go into that

so I have two things I have

um

so when I insert the numbers

um on the typewriter according what's on

top of the box these numbers are these

numbers are output is because the keys

are wrong

but this number this did not work that's

not the solution so I tried to reverse

so I just press on the numbers from one

through nine and zero

but uh and then I try to reverse it

so because the first number is five

I try to insert four

but the next number is nine which

represent the zero and that doesn't work

don't worry about it

bye

a

there is no name exactly unless I'm

supposed to dumbled

decipher this

I can do it again

okay it was five nine three seven

my voice okay

wait let me just double no no that one

doesn't work because that's that breaks

the state

and now I came in underscore

nine

eight eight seven four two four seven

four five six seven

one two

three four and five

five yeah hey nice well I mean one

oh you got one of them

so now we just need to find another one

well something I'm sure there has

somewhere there has to be something to

do with these little boxes and their

colors right oh I already did the boxes

they were for the toilet

that you spend them and depending on how

many times you spend them and it pops up

and then you take the amount of time to

spin them and then you put it into the

life box

wait

um so what do we get for that and

there's somebody got a little real thing

to go into the projector

oh also I'm not sure if the order of

these toys are correct by the way this

was all just guessing

whatever this thing is incense on this

thing oh I see all right

I'm the tea we need

oh I

wait 100 just have a number underneath

it is there any other little mannequin

somewhere

um I don't know oh

okay hold on

B eight okay so no I didn't want

of the planets wait how did you open

that what was the upstairs

um I got all the mannequins that were in

the position of numbers and they had

letters on them

ah okay

okay oh you can press the things on

their hand interesting that's being

correct order morning belly flower but

which is okay I think we need to press

the buttons by this planet so let's see

Jupiter Saturn Earth and Mars oops

Rising Jupiter wait what's this okay

hold on

I'm gonna

do that and do that okay uh mice and

Chip better

is what

we can't say

I've had our freedom wait is this thing

and that's what I'm looking oh yeah

that's one I'm looking for

sitting backwards

you do you want it yeah I'm stealing

from naked for me yeah

that's the one

uh to combine them to make something

okay

oh I can only do one at a time that's

that's one

oh that one's Jupiter okay this one's

Jupiter this one's that one and and what

is that

um okay

okay and then this one is Mars

and that one rice rice versus Batman

let's count this around this no no it

does not okay and now oh I got a key

oh yeah oh Crown okay

now we just need to put this

I thought I saw a place where this here

what where

there we go

oh I think we can get another number

with this thing

but this was

yeah so a

hey different cards

I think we need those cards for another

number okay so this is eight uh

and uh yes oh but they're in Roman

numerals and I am not great with Norman

numerals you want me to um

okay at the emperor's ball that I saw

her for the first time two four nine

very soon we became lovers and made our

vowels before the Priestess

uh I see what this is hey oh what a fool

I have been she was the world to me but

the fortune would not have it in our

time of love and strength when do you

have to grow money thanks so emperor

A36

86 V is five right yeah eight three oh

wait

um

so wait what do we need the

eight uh here

okay okay time is three five

six

uh did I not pick up that note did I

leave it there okay

that there

yeah I guess that goes over here

yeah

what um how did they go with the

numerals all right so how does that how

does the card the cards work oh yeah oh

flowers

the eyes six yes yes

19 yes and zero

so which order wait I need that little

where's that paper that I was reading oh

here it is yeah

um

lovers and made our vows before the

Priestess Okay so

lovers is six and Priestess is can I

take the numbers and you read the other

one and where is there

too much six

two

what's the last one oh yeah are you

going through everything

I need to add them [ __ ] yeah right

should I take the numbers then I'll take

the numbers you take the

it's not

that we worked again okay

um it was at the emperor's Bowl so the

emperor is the first number

yes yeah and then it'll be the lovers

and the Priestess added together

six and two eight there's the number

then

and then the full

you know

and then

the world

June Wheel of Fortune win a fortune 10

and strength so to be the world minus

the world of Fortune minor strength

eleven minus seven eight

yeah so so that's three

those are the

that should be the combo I guess

I don't remember what I said

we should hit

the uh

there yeah

perfect

and the last piece

oh okay okay

oh wait didn't someone pick up matches

at one point uh that was like at a

different level oh

it is kind of looks like one of those

boys

it it kind of does yeah

uh

[Music]

two four nine

Max

V I tried the other ones but that's that

because you have the death to see

oh wait and this doesn't go there so

baby

so there must be something in a book or

something that yeah it must be some

thousand minutes convert

um

pan has all the papers

yeah but the this this one is to be done

with

and this one without it and this one

we've done it

but we don't need them but maybe it is

in

not that not bad

I'm just going to say mannequins but

that doesn't work because this one's in

body you know

nah

okay

maybe it's on one of those notes

are easy here when you know them

yeah yeah when you know them exactly and

I happen to know them I'm just a bit

Rusty I guess

is there any emails

but if it was the same notice a tarot

card thing

oh wait

oh wait oh that says two four nine

but I guess that's already done yeah or

something else

and we need why does LV work with none

of the other deadliest

that is weird

we had to spell something

victory

I mean all the letters behind you mean

anything

the only letter I get to do anything it

is easy to be uh wait oh oh wait hold on

yeah

wait wait wait wait V works oh and then

D okay I see

avoid void fight is it right your ID

right

oh you want to spell the void okay let's

try it

oh yeah

right

yeah

right

um now what oh oh cool how are we going

to

let's leave it to their own

how did he get voids from that

uh it's the only word that made sense

for those letters

for lighting up on letters

oh yeah you're right it was didn't

notice that well I can spell old as well

but it had it but it was four it was

five

but V was the first let me so yeah

I think we still did it within the time

hydrates

oh

okay okay

there we go

spices the table is possessed yeah when

the table leaves from the ground like

that

Prince wait

one two three five five six

I got that lion

um let's see any more Poppins

yeah one two three five

four okay a piece of unknown

birthday

oh yeah five six seven here we go

seven

and let me see if we can look at it oh

wait Sigma on it

so we just need one more piece

then one two three sorry that's a three

eight three three

now what do I just hit this place I can

put the paper somewhere

weird

oh wait is it

thank you one two three

yeah I think I did that right

a buck

March 12th

oh

I hope we have like whatever March 23rd

had

the strangest dream last night from the

depths of the force use narrow eyes

color of gold we are watching every move

not much

narrow eyes color of gold we're watching

my every move

uh well there's a gold eye here

I

I arrived at the Azure C

with a round island in the middle

oops I need a last piece of paper you

don't have one

it's got to be that one

oh that that uh

[Music]

surrounded by a fallen yeah with an

endless hole to nothingness in the

middle

m

endless leaves

understand me

so all right

oh okay

this green book probably has something

to do with animals here I don't think we

need that book

uh what is this oh

oh we need one too

and we need a bunch of keys oh no yeah

you're probably done with these books

and I put it back

why can't I put that back

okay so uh did I do that right one two

three four there must be one more piece

or is this all the paper we need

because it has a seat but simple only

one two three

and I don't know if that's one two three

four

five out of six oh wait no hold on nine

two for six

six

time

okay

oh let's see okay nice when did you pick

up or another key yeah I was counting

the B

all right

um

eBay

can I get you in there please wait hi

this is the trash

this has really weird color stripes

one

one five four three

I think

hello oh it makes something hydrate but

we'll do so bye bye

can I get this tokens everywhere

oh

no

one two three okay

one of them I must think that one how do

I know the order of this

okay and this is gonna be tough I don't

know what the order would be

how many permutations is there for four

numbers

it's four times three times two is each

quarter we have two

24 Millions

I think that each leg on here it it's

like five pages

it's like one it's like five because

there's a green

and four okay let's just download we

wish I don't know the order

okay

one

mine all right foreign

okay one five three

four three anytime I guess it's four

three okay four one

two five

five

uh three four one five four three one

five

four three one five that doesn't work

okay uh

five three uh I can

yeah

140.

now

uh three five

four one now

one for now

like five

five one all right that's actually yeah

all right now

for one now

five four three one no

one three oh

okay okay

yeah

tile does the task

yeah I'm not excited to show how you're

supposed to get I know

I found a nope yeah yeah no it's perfect

and then oh hey

I need a three-digit number with that

note I'm gonna just put that there

the first what's the number of Limbs

it was followed by limbs touching

because I said that is

six away

this final number is

one's pointing westwards

wow and the Fly

oh the ecosystem I got you okay yeah

yeah

that makes sense okay

okay we need one point oh yeah it's this

one

let me see if I can unlock this then

eight are these butterflies for anything

else oh yeah I did that already it was

with the clock oh

it's three

oh yeah I guess it consistently

oh that's the last key that we need

oh yeah

we had a lot of time left

whoops

This Server reminds me of the first book

or in which where geralt is talking with

someone about daddy Canyon horses

are they black with white stripes or

white with black stripes well that zebra

was uh white with black straps

I mean

um I don't know I didn't really sit

there to count all of the stripes so I

don't know the answer to that it was a

white with black and green stripes

tummy

we have a keypad

and

oh this has a thing on it

it's a birthday that has three

decoration with numbers

okay so something about 30.

Let's Help B I don't know how to escape

what else do we need we need

chess pieces

the workers painted over the wiring

schematics

and that's a weird thing

hey Tom wait it does happen

all right

does have chess pieces

anything in the boot

hey this boot has an eight

does that does that mean anything we

must have a knife some giving a series

of numbers okay I I have I have one food

that says eight and one pizza says no

yeah yeah I get I got it

let me take the click point

I'm gonna move that that there uh this

is 30.

do you want to try to insert the chest

pieces so any one of you

I just I don't know wait where I don't

know

I'm just sticking out no I should read

them

oh okay

um but what you have

um I was going to read them but I'm not

sure how I'm supposed to read them but

the first one is 10 15.

10 15. how do you get 10 15 from this

ow

um it could be Queen but

Queen okay okay yes this one okay Queen

because that's basically what they have

ah but that doesn't make sense because

next time is 11.

11 o'clock

I want to read a minute hand but there

is no mini tent here like there's

nothing to to write of that thing

thanks this should be something in there

so the first one is like

every time

first one is 10 15. does that work okay

exact second one is

oh

yeah how are you doing wait what so the

second one is eleven o'clock

hey

the third one is repeat that one that is

13. thank you so much doesn't match

anything

and then it's 14 o'clock that doesn't

matter no that one skip that one

why can't I click and then it's speaking

and that's great and 1630

oh hey there's a thing

on the screen also another so

combination of buttons might not be

okay

yeah

oh wait the shoe size nine

eight

three

Okay so

what's this

uh

uh

strawberry

cherry

doesn't seem like high security to have

me

quantity

stuff hey

this is a packet

I'm trying to make sense of this because

it says Omega so it must be the same but

how do you read it

okay 10 15.

uh

Adam oh wait it has a bunch of toys

There it's a can I can I see that for a

sec

okay what okay

there we go

assistant

Emma was missing

yeah I don't think this is for the chess

pieces I think this is but it's it says

Omega so but and it has that symbols

yeah yeah this this whole entire place

is called Omega Corporation okay yeah so

there's like a Vegas symbols everywhere

so okay I think it's something else

so

someone missed out okay do you have a

name associated with it and then I can

read this what do you remember

like here's the login for

you're helping me

the forgot password my age

God my age my pink favorite Beauty my

left and right wait my pink favorite

Beauty

okay so three zero

and my boyfriend's collecting which

one's right at this blue so three zero

and something about pink

I think about pink do you think about

pink I want to see pink oh here right

well maybe I don't know there's a

there's a there's a car picture there

that's got a license plate thing on it

maybe that's something useful

High three okay so three zero five three

that's a long ticket and then

uh nine

eight two three zero five three nine

eight

got it

nice okay

clearance pick three symbols that I'm

missing oh okay there

and Camera person and your hand camera

oh yeah those are the ones that exist so

okay so Hand camera person exists but

both parents okay F phone running phone

there's two phones and two two people

two phones exist on the signs

cart and smoking

okay there we go

I'm not employing none

the LED post

welcome oh wait I wonder

does that change any x-rays

this one this one

about entry employee ID don't have IDs

we're gonna go back again maybe a lot of

creepy our characters don't have

Reflections it may be egg hunt when you

have sex

I actually have you actually don't have

shadows no important important let's

switch it to import zero one one two oh

zero one one

zero one one

zero one

and zero up nope

um

I don't know how to I don't know what

that is it's just zero one one one zero

one zero zero one

but maybe I should figure out which

three actually works with this thing

yeah one mind so

first is first to 15 that doesn't exist

because it only took three three of them

right

one two three

now I think okay maybe only a specific

item take this money as you can say okay

one one so The Rook

and that one doesn't work

has anyone in the chat know how to do

this for zero one one one zero one zero

zero one I don't what I don't think it

happened chat no we have to use our

brains now I don't that's spoil it in

chat

wait

no we we simply use the

no we don't want to use hint

no no hints

use a hit I'm sorry

I just wanted to know what the button

did

anyway it didn't help my brain because

my brain is slow

yeah one

zero zero one I don't know how to read

that

10 exist and lemon doesn't exists

I like this tea I don't even know what

that is

uh

that's 15 that's 16.

it's a queen

no I'm really trying okay I I feel like

it's a clue but

I'm trying

anyway anyone else can take a look at

this paper and see what I think I tried

I have tried

and I can't make sense of it

how do you get warm water from this

scene

they from rfsp for B4

oh there it is office before

one two three four okay so five

eight

oh hold on

foreign

I pretended that this was a dream

better detector

right

here with this

what the heck you even meant to do with

that though like

baby

um

I still don't know what this means

the zero the zero one one

just hate the one time I think oh oh is

this what we look at this tree for

I can't

okay so I have another one the one that

is the uh where's this for

eign like

the fruits or anything anyway

oh

yeah

King

all right

ah they light up with the things okay

so wait it's Queen what and Bishop

Okay so

yeah so it's Queen

King

Kink clink Bishop yeah

I think that's really it that's it

hopefully works

okay

that was weird it's all right here

okay I'm sticking out on it just help me

zeroes zero one one zero one

on the bracelet that's inside the case

left is right there it's right it's

surprised it's inside the inside the

king's white inside the chains

when the curl is inside these chains I

can't open it without the curl

yeah wait wait no I can't do that wait

wait wait I know the code it is

three out of five one

five one

nope

on both sides at the same time oh this

clipboard I don't even think is for

anything it's just a bunch of times

try

and punch chatter uh easy image chat c

with zero one one zero one zero zero one

stands for let's see what is reading a

binary it should be three by one but if

it represents something more

yeah we need we need a programmer nerd

well I'm the program in there okay

well then

explain binary to us I said it did

binary numbers are three five one

that's what it says

and I inserted 351 on the briefcase and

but it didn't do anything

wait did I say left this

Chi left this regular yes I'm inserted

like regularly on the left

so yeah

we got them so far

it's not uh

signing ID

what happens if you change this out

can't break it okay oh no that's just

the one comment says

sorry we're closed and offices

ouch

so important is remember we need

b51 what can we do with that

what's happening

inside today

there's a clock there being stuck

in time

T four eight nine

and it's not foreign

yeah not me neither

because you got this this thing

and you could try to read the binary

zero one one so from the start you go

left right right and then you get to

some root at the top

okay okay all right

I mean sure sure

oh

once it's decimals it's two three three

wait did you mention something about a

bracelet because this is a six money

yeah

oh six one nine oh

it's fine right

out

what did you put the briefcase

I put it in the X-ray machine

oh that was smart that was actually

smart

um a 619

that's high five

you insert six one nine on the briefcase

with an insert nine one six on the other

side

and that's open again

oh nice and now you got

zero four two on the computing

there we go

there's level huh five

damn what do you get for iPhone I don't

know

okay

oh

wait we had to put this somewhere

look at this

let me oh let oh we had to enter a

password

oh that's where this comes to play

oh yeah okay let me look at it then so

011 is the

um I can't even describe what these

things are oh that's what that is oh

it's an app that is that wait is this

what that zero one one yeah

zero oops and one is the next one which

is a color oh

it's that

I don't hear you I'm trying to type here

hey I didn't click anything I swear I'm

innocent

seriously everyone that's cherries

Cherry you can insert the last one if

you want Cherokee

so that's what those things were for it

wasn't even supposed to be important

letter

at any point

that was really weird yeah we didn't

even need to get the clearance from the

competition

well

then what's weird

okay office outside yes

that was sweet

oh

so what is it hurting my brain too much

I'm gonna be honest

I'm like meeting at 1400 depression

Wesley

uh let me sit down at the computer

no input Choice

ah wait you're not touch my food

I can't wait some of this stuff okay so

it doesn't have

I feel like that might be important

later probably yeah

but I can't

I found a key

okay

menu

ooh bit food

let's see animal report

eggs eggs mushrooms pineapple Orange

oh there's a clue in the shredder wow

crispy duck is really expensive oh it's

15 degrees today connected to that

anyway

oh that was actually for something

that's cool

and pamper

pamper

computer

yeah it doesn't help

thank you

and unlock the phone

this is what Ram is

what is RAM is this one yeah it is

oh a ram

I only know like right now

yeah it's cured in we need to ask you're

driving

that is a screwdriver right here perfect

because he took it when I was going to

take it but right

here we go

oh wait what let's uh

this one means six

like that okay we need more um

technically it has enough RAM yet to run

but

I'm pretty sure it's going to complete

the other way yeah

nothing there so we need

to be my my shredding people

I don't know maybe it did something

useful clearly it did not thank you

meeting at 14 lunch was done analysis

here it is who has been spreading around

these RAM sticks everywhere that's not

how you treat your computer

72. oh there's another one here as well

okay isn't it this one is 72.

there we go

uh

32 66 ow let's see

seven two six six

is it true

but how does that translate to to

Anastasia translator

huh because I just like the letters wait

and you need letters

yeah I need three letters but I don't

know how these translate the letters I

got the letters

you say

72 and 72 okay 66 66 and

that's it I don't oh wait

70.

70.

okay you're welcome

Chinese food Chinese

I'll take that

oh install it

away

um

let's see that's fried rice I think with

broccoli and mushrooms and shrimp yeah

it has some I use

the corner

I'm gonna look at the menu

fried rice a shrimp

broccoli

and mushroom

but

so it costs two dollars for fried rice

seven dollars for shrimps

uh mushrooms is two dollars and broccoli

is a dollar twenty

oh hmm

I found something but I'm not entirely

sure what

I use it for can we do it on the phone

like you can click on

things so do we oh that that's why it

wasn't working because I inserted DDR3

RAM into the computer even though it

shouldn't be physically physically

possible to inside the room where I'm in

the computer

so I think I need

I need a code from this and it didn't

inspect code for the computer to

okay hold on it's a fried rice chew

shrimp 7.

you put the broccoli 120 the mushrooms

no worries tough hey how do I

need you said three digit code this

morning

there you go

um

right right here

I I know that that has the same time

you know what you mean it I gotta tell

me I gotta tell me okay I'll just prices

oh here we go

that's me

hey Zumi do you know how to work this

out

what am I looking at

I I feel like this menu has something to

do with this box that has something to

do with opening this

like your thing has fried rice

shrimp and broccoli

but um

it is a menu

fried rice

two broccoli it was broccoli

at the bottom

left this is where I would put in this

cold shrimp 217. so what what did I just

say that was okay shrimp mushrooms

broccoli fried rice

there's four ingredients in there

rimp which is seven

uh

uh broccoli

hmm yeah broccoli and mushrooms

broccoli is 1.2 but I don't know

all right okay

mushrooms is too

and fried rice is two

perfect so those are the costs of the

ingredients hey yeah I don't know I

don't know how things work but now you

need a USB how many numbers can you put

in here

four okay okay

we need

maybe kind of makes me immigrate

something else

broccoli maybe these stocks would come

in the plane yeah I'll keep it

um you never know

so did someone find a USB stick I

usually don't have to worry about buying

anything

so I I don't really know how any of this

what's up

[Music]

it's probably inside this thing so when

you get this unlocked baby how did you

what did you

but that that

um

um container has the same symbol AS this

thing and so that's the menu

okay so they this has fried rice and

shrimp and broccoli and mushrooms and

there's different I guess prices or

something in there

like don't let me usually buy anything

so I don't really know how this stuff

works

um I mean I guess okay I I think it was

uh two noodles seven nine

yeah it's right no it's fried rice

oh no it's very nice nice yeah fried

rice

right okay fried rice too

yeah the shrimp which is I think seven

97 yes yeah it's a nine and then uh

Brooklyn the broccoli

broccoli is one in 20 and mushrooms and

stew and one two two does it take or not

understand

it's one two two zero because currency

is two decimal things

oh you go

let's try it perfect

okay wait what was in there all right

try to inserted but again it had a weird

okay

so again take a look at that

recipe

I want to change settings but no it

wasn't okay it's a USB by the way um

oh

put it in

um right

the the white board behind you perhaps

oh

no

that's a weird Mouse

expert puzzle number 538

much longer either yeah but what about

the connect the internet

not a very strong battery but imagine

the fact that the internet that's good
