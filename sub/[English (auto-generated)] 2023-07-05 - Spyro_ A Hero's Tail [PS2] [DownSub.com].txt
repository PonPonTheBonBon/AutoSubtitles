okay
I got first one this time
two first in the same on the same day
hmm
how do we count that
well I guess that was a bad thing if
it's starting over so you get a new one
new one nature of that one
so
that means
that next week I should I should try
question anything
there was a break in the Stream So yeah
exactly
counts
foreign
foreign
oh and let's get this started
oh
starting up consume
consistent
locating game
you're saying starting up again
Drake Really Gonna control it
and let's see if the game shows up
anyway please
perfect
everything is working
meow meow
perfect perfect 12 more collectibles
let's see if Amber shifts up then
he's been doing stuff
and it's the only working
yep it is
[Music]
about to go back from the menu but it
quits at nothing
so
six more night James
it's my age that's 12 in total
yeah all good that's great
no you got got everything here
's
and then I should go to the coastal room
yeah that's right where I clicked where
I
didn't go down
I meant to Flame you and I'll charge you
my body
and
because I was done with this realm and
was going to move early to the next
round
now we just need to
get out of here
[Applause]
yeah
look I found the way out
I think this is my layout
yeah because
actually I I don't remember how I get to
that body
money bags teleporter
looking at this one
wait
I'm not going to here I might no
over here
everything
did we
did have a sixth ending for oh was there
an ending wait how do you trigger the
ending
didn't we get the ending
no feel free to browse by fine I guess
I'll do it
quick yeah Showcase of that
afterwards after completing this game
then
you fight to find the boss a second all
right
that's Jay
I didn't say second is defined by
pineapple yes that is that's that's
right
I'm basically
do that then
remind me to do that
wait Lost Cities
this is really called lost this
[Music]
NFL
I don't know
yeah it is called not see this because
this is Coastal remains these remains or
like coastal cities
on the water and the sky and stuff too
so
congratulations thank you it was quite
the challenge and I went for a gold when
I didn't party
there's two eggs and two legends
have visited everywhere so
where could this be
let me start here and then I work my way
soon
only seven powers can
you did it dude here dude take this as a
rule and I forgot about
yeah I forgot about the rewards that's
one of them and the other one is up
there
let's get the other one then
yeah I have this other place where I can
go to instead
so that's all the light gems here
so this is the two eggs
it doesn't seem to message me
just to tell that so
yeah there's no eggs behind me here
that thing's really killing
[Music]
okay I'll Express his premise yeah the
iceberg is best
because some of the enemies you can't
flame and some you can't do electricity
so it's just fun but ice works on every
enemy as far as I can tell and some
enemies you have to charge to break
their their armor before you can charge
them or you have to charge them to break
their armor
and you start before you can attack them
but ice ignores armor
of course you have to charge them to
kill them after
in Iceland
but when you ice them they are frozen so
they can't protect you annoying
okay so I've got the blessing
and the power of eyes
is the last one you get so
the last one
stop
I have enough
of food it is
all right
these these enemies are so annoying
I can't face this
okay
Iron Man and me
completely in a family
but the bread used in only one person no
you use it in use it in a person to get
out of the chamber when you learn it we
use the water to another person
and a third person and a fourth person I
can see a four
situations
when you use it
but yeah it's only in very very specific
situations
so yeah otherwise
it does stun opponents as long as you
using the water on them
thank you
okay it's very young did you utilized
and underwinning yep
the worst power-ups I have this
oh yeah this is the um the other place I
don't want to get here
definitely is
a bad one
I haven't been in these places
because there's these things here
[Music]
[Applause]
as far as I know there aren't any
because I haven't been on the water here
that's these things are staying here but
I don't think there are eggs on the
water I could be wrong right
it's me
they are inspired today but this isn't
spicy
of course I can see there are no eggs
here so
this is however
that is not this area
I guess there's no eggs here
let's have cleared out to Sunny
oh I'm a bit too far fine
wait spikes is still there
dyed with spicy still alive
but I wanted I didn't want to be here
yeah the water plant is under yes but I
think it reaches farther than the eyes
and I've got your mat
I guess you are correct so what's the
point a bit
you are great
okay
you can really test electricity uh what
industry support in ice but what's the
point of it if this is all it does
what is this
because he can't say you speak that
anyway there's a name yep
this correct
it doesn't matter how far I'm bossy
reaches if it doesn't do anything
what's up
[Music]
come on
Martin Mount is the only place we see
this one wait what mountain man
come on I don't know about
another level
okay maybe this I haven't used it there
I've used eyes
and spice is good
so that was the other thing yeah
I think
[Music]
I don't know if I cleared out the whole
left area
at least it was like
[Music]
and this is this area
I guess I could just massage
and this is just another sign it doesn't
do anything
foreign
outside
thank you
nothing is a steameday
nothing grass
this area doesn't have anything
unlockable as far as I know
next area
this is this one is double checking yes
foreign
[Music]
oh hello
so that's when I unlocked
I think I cleared out this area
it looks very
stand out
yep
bunny welcome
Pera
cine
thank you for the follow
me thank you and thank you for liking
the bunny
currency
looking for some eggs
exactly
that area is completely cleared out
no I'm happy
we found your way here
so this is that uh yeah maybe
there are things here just to be very
careful
around this water here
yeah there's this area
wasn't that just to get
yeah from that platform which I other
than done
I haven't been down here uh bikes bugs
anyway
bugs kill the bugs
yeah first time I've seen a streamer
from straight Indonesia Persona I
thought oh
that's right
that's
and
I'm happy
to be the first
first one you see
I like bunnies
if that's
it wasn't obvious from the whole scene
so
now over here
this suggests that sound domain we say
stop spinning around forever
but it's amazing how to not like them
yeah yeah definitely
huh
[Music]
oh yeah
yeah this area is cleared out too
yep completely cleared out
I like foxes and tigers I mean that's
fine
here we accept all
all animals are accepted here
regardless of what animal you are
as long as you accept other people being
whatever animal they are
so
behind
so he starts like this time I have
nothing
have I been to every location this I
now this is going back
that's not why I wanted to kill
it's up here
yes
[Music]
I know enough more of these
I wasn't even hit by that one
thank you
even if there is he's like yeah why not
if they are sea slug I don't judge
okay a nice bunnies and kitten
What kitten do you like kittens
unbelievable
oh yeah and this is the last area I have
not cleared out gotten through yet I
think
there is one chest I haven't opened this
one but this one only because I'm gems
I like
150 Gems or so but Keys costs
500
but I just had to open it just to make
sure
yeah I'm kind of not mining like these
two eggs so even if I finally find one
of them I still have to find the other
one
as as long as they don't expel their
innards at me I guess I mean yeah I mean
you have to be
released about the nights obviously
I have no other reward
we're always getting into trouble so I
would appreciate you watching over well
that sounds like something new today
no
being irresponsible parent you know
just it's the crazy idea I know
being responsible parents
yeah can I get out this water too
and there aren't any
yeah I'm confused where are the two
remaining eggs
two eggs
those kids gotta learn
people aren't always gonna be dead he
burst meeting them
yeah that's what they give all day
that's not for that that's funny
yeah I'm confused I'm really produced
wow frame rate's dropping
I'm gonna give up there
with PS3 can't handle this game it's too
overpowered
[Music]
oh I found an egg
fair enough
like I said when I finally bring one of
the eggs is still the hole and I'm not
an ancient point
oh nothing
well bye
yay too much water graphing
yeah
here here's one place you have to use
water but this only if you like gem
which I want to record so
that's one of the places you have to use
it
one gun yeah
another another benefit of the ice is
that you don't have to wait for any text
animation they are instantly removed and
you are instantly giving the gems that's
another benefit
okay
it's a calibration
party hats
so
[Music]
one whole another ink
I feel like
I've been to every location so far
[Music]
sure I didn't go to like which I got I
do
[Music]
and I didn't have a pointy
so I'm thinking this area have a bit
here
I don't know
it feels like I didn't go there
why do you have a squishy Mouse
wait a minute
of course I've been there it's that area
is the area with the
[Music]
with the
thing that takes you to the disguising
[Music]
there was no egg there
the only thing I can think of now is
that the last egg is behind some
breakable the whole one of some sort
like if you can [ __ ] these things
[Applause]
[Applause]
that is
blurry
it's just the TV doing that or is it
actually part of the game I don't know
okay I can't get up here wait a minute
well I can get up here there is
something maybe there was something that
I wanted to pick up
[Music]
[Music]
good
Ness
now I'm sinking
my son is almost like be an egg in
this area of being like
this is the most
unexplored I have you like
[Applause]
Yoshi Mouse
something weird about these platforms
is that something
suspicious about this thing
not in it but on the outside
I just think now
when this was not broken it was easier
because I had a hot scene to stand on
I'll find it why we I meet you
Well yeah if you look when I found it I
guess you no worries
it is probably not that scene but it
does look like pizzas
all right setting down between
[Music]
I can't see this before yet I have no
idea where it is
yep
like
two of the eggs
bye
are some challenges
unless I'm supposed to talk to that
Arthur and he says like
oh by the way I have this Dragon mix too
do you want it
oh I can't be there it's way too precise
and we are jumping together
foreign
because I didn't want to find it
um
in case you can work together
I found my out of ideas now
I just I just want to know which area
she was looking at because these levels
are big
but
where's the tray
yeah I guess it's not here
which is this area
where else could it be
comes now
he obviously don't have one
girl then
why am I dating works for me
any snow
I don't even have that upgrade but why
would I have that happen
let's begin with the other side of the
land
if you want to explore a link too so
don't wait for exactly
exactly this area is basically cleared
out too
maybe I didn't care
because like let's do this area
properly
as I went down to that platform
immediately
but nope
nope
nothing
link that's what the character's name
was for some reason I thought it was a
blinky binky
yeah a lot of people think it's Pinky
but it's not assistant
quickly closing opening your eyes
foreign
[Music]
thank you
yeah I'm not sure
I am not sure at all
I'm not sure
the problem is that the eggs aren't
demand it doesn't make any noise which
makes sense but
uh I wasn't allowed to work there I got
a checkpoint to be Nintendo but
I'm not even standing in it I'm standing
on the edge
okay this game is making me tired
well I'm back here
where have I not like
[Music]
that's so strong bye
[Music]
passing suspicious looking
I guess I'll go up there and see
the fear of his
so pretty
oh quickly
[Music]
why the best can't even put out fine
yes
I really
like a useful power
it would be a nice
um
interactive function okay I'm up here
[Music]
nothing there's nothing here
there's nothing here
[Music]
ever been tired this game is making me
tired
it's making me so tight
[Applause]
he's making me so tired see it it does
that thing where it just
doesn't no flying
is that is it really supposed to be like
that
let me try it
but I guess I guess that's just how at
least
I win games win
you cannot really need that
anyway
I used to be the promise me
if you need to do the person
uh
where am I supposed to kill
right down now
Emmy looks so relaxed and that's
fantastic
maybe they are so very American relaxing
there's a thing here
what's what's the point of it
like what's the point of this
[Music]
doesn't lean anyway
and when I go around here to get to this
pillar I just go over to the cannon and
for the cannon and I guess break the
door and it's kind of flying straight
into it
the I don't know
what about the nearly Cannon yeah
actually that's the Canon that's no
problem
let's see
and let's explore the cannon
because this one he's still the cannon
but I can't get to the cannon from or
can I not maybe I can't get certainly I
can get there from there to here
didn't I do that
or did I really go to that party Escape
after I've seen this afternoon did I
think
a pizza with the whole pineapple on I
like pineapple pizza
with a pizza with the whole pineapple on
I don't know
as it is power up I only used it in now
the level for those enemies and since
then I've never used it
there's another ability that's very very
situational
yeah I'm using this too
destroy the chest and the door for that
and now
everything's cleaning up
so
so I didn't know
okay
I can't call it an Evidence
for the pineapple
okay
[Music]
I guess maybe the egg is hiding in the
Boss Arena or something
that I have to have to go back but I
didn't have to do that
or if it's like hiding
here
up here
behind this scene
behind the whole thing
behind the big teleporter
oh he's a cute lever who's supposed to
move that lever
nope
oh yeah the windshield thing on the
using that one level against all of
those enemies and all the objectives
still hit you Superman scene
yep that's kinda
[Music]
but now I'm in a different level
so
it must be somewhere
such thing and so yeah
Elizabeth is nice yeah I mean it's in
discount
so I'm back I had to turn on my heater
it's a bit cold inside oh he there in
this summer
hence
should I look up a map or something of
every location should I give up
if I really can't find it
[Music]
this game is one thing that made me did
some memories yeah
I do remember the music the most
where's
I like this one
does the menu provide any hints nope
this is all I get you can check this
screen
and it's all the other tasks you have to
do so you can get to the next realm but
none of them is incomplete so I've done
that oh I mean
not much
I mean show you is some of this like
show you let's let's blink Explorer and
completely sounds on easy and hard
setting
I didn't know those were settings
to receive a dragon a light sham
respective and it says I've done it
so but it is not
defeat in Neptune that is not this level
it's on the
because that's only
picture
yeah
on the water too here is when you defeat
in Neptune
but I guess it's about yeah
[Music]
wait a minute
now yeah they have additions
they don't share it
[Music]
but it doesn't matter if one of this
says that I get an egg
because it says I've done it now
[Music]
so it is help
but
this kind of help
[Music]
talk to our character
shooting
yep yeah
I don't know what to do
[Music]
so we
is it fair to me to just some big
locations online on like a map
if someone has made one
[Music]
[Music]
but because darkspire has made these
Maps
I think that's fair everyone needs help
sometimes yeah I mean
foreign
all right
yeah I can't do this
[Music]
and I wanted to make it
inspiring
how do I do that
okay
only City
perfect
it's not it's not the perfect match but
almost
anyway let's we know that
and
uh
so
I've been making the map begin
so we got
blink we've done that egg
what eggs do I miss I can also check
that
I am missing
a green
like that one
but that one I just picked up
I might have found it
I'm missing a red
missing like
the third one is a candidate
so my that one is from the other
challenge
I got all of those eggs I got all of
those eggs I got those two I got that
exit it must be that age that is the one
I'm missing
okay
let's see if I can get it then
which one did you think it was
this way right
yes
because more egg the more egg groups are
clear out these cities too now which
makes
it and it was a straight straight right
and immediate right
this in here
it is somewhere here
wait a minute I already got this one
again this is a game part
okay let's
you want me to say which one might be
wow I got I mean
let me just
yep no wait a minute
if I go out here I shouldn't get back
here but that wouldn't that counts to
dislocation not the other location but
did I get it
up area
oh no that's the dark sham that you get
wait a minute
no I didn't get to the correct location
wait a minute
no wait yeah now I remember which egg
that is it is the uh
is the one that's on that pillar which I
already got
was the one I got after all the prom
swinging so let me
let me do this
[Music]
and I should Mark the ones I got
now
which eggs do we have we have blink
that's what I've obviously got so how do
I mark this what should I
let's see I read
or black
and
I wanted to be obvious
you're the same yeah boom if you can
you should probably use the point as
well so that's what I got this one was
the post painting I worked endlessly on
which I just checked that I have
that one is the turtle thing which I
confirmed today that she said she didn't
tell anymore
the that one can also considered
complete LGB 7X
the sieve
and as we can confirm I got all the safe
eggs
though I already got that one
is it that one it can't be
and it says
this one which we can't see currently
but this is okay I got all the blue
purple themed star signs it can't be
that one I think
oh no
I want to do medication
so that's one two three four five that
means that there's these two left this
one I just got today there was one of
the mid one
struggle with
at least the blue one and but the blue
one I already got all the blue ones so
it can't be that one either so that one
should also so wait a minute and what is
going on
what is
[Music]
Hmm this is weird
[Music]
what what have I done
[Music]
yeah which one is it
whatever what is it I'm not getting
I'll paste the texts that I'm looking at
I mean yeah
each egg has a number so you can
but I got to get a fascinating so you
have a good chance of today yeah this is
quite impossible I'm trying to figure
out at the moment
this is the second one you got from link
but didn't I
didn't I talk to him didn't I do that
thing twice
didn't he say that
oh but now I don't have anything to give
you
bye bye kitten that's always stay here
did I give us something wait no no Trump
didn't want to give me something link
gives you a blue one
I already got all the blue ones
it's not the reward from completing
do you mean there is an egg in the blink
level
but wait how can it be how can it be an
egg in the it's another egg you find
during the blinking but
how does that work
they let's let's count the xia
one two three four five six seven it
says there's only seven so one of these
seven I haven't gotten
blink gives you the Blue Egg I got all
the blue eggs so it can't be that one
I can't say that you're wrong but what
you're saying doesn't make any sense to
me
and as far as I know there are no eggs
in
blink levels are they
are the eggs in pink flowers interesting
level wait with everyone I need him
it doesn't make any sense to me I'm very
confused in the moment
these four because these would have only
cleared out it must be it must be one of
these for it
is it but that one I just checked that's
when I get after doing the posting and
that one I just picked up today
so I got on the seven Haze as far as I
know I have all seven eggs
okay here's the entire list here okay
I'm so confused
[Music]
what kind of list are you looking at
so many characters
yeah sure I mean
mostly yeah I guess that's easier
egg locations
foreign
arches
why does it say blink
[Music]
what
I'll just turned
and this is Sergeant bird
this is this
oh it's the uh
that's what the
when you say
during the blinking no that's not what
it means
no it's not a blink level it's the blink
egg
it's the
[Music]
blink mini game that's what it is the
Blu-ray they really should call it blue
wig
but I got all blue eggs so it's not that
one
I don't think it's like exists I think
the game is bad
if someone if someone else can come to
come with an explanation for what is
going on here because as far as I
figured everything out I have all seven
eggs and the game is currently barked
and claiming that I only got six
so the game is broken and I cannot
complete it 100
that is my claim at the moment
and
unless people
Ethan got bored and went away
me games on his own
oh well I guess I can't do more than
this then
it's two version point or something
you know what here's an idea
I would say check every location again
just to be sure the map isn't wrong
but
foreign
here's the other idea I just go through
more levels find more eggs and then
as I
am like there's one another in here
which I know which it is
so that will clear out more of the more
eggs though there's less eggs I have to
consume
for the
which eggs can be remained on this level
I would think this level is burned
it's uh because
it can only be two of the of on this
it can only be 37 eggs one of the posts
for him which I got and the other one I
just got today
so I yeah so the game is
yeah I'm going the wrong way
the color on map could be incorrect yeah
that is a possibility
the locations can be correct but if the
but the colors can be increased
that is a possibility
it says that there is
[Music]
now I should check and
dislocation I think it is
no wait
ask me
is
is this location no
and this area is clearer
come on grab the edge
the Dragon
thank you
this side is cleaned out
yeah I only has continued
to the other
levels and let's see what colors are
remaining
that wait you're not the one selling
high prices I tell you I'm crazy
ah there you are my favorite I'm not
sure where he has a different accent but
which location is it
um
has been collected but it shows up on
the screen vertical count distance girl
for the reason I recall you mentioned
that this game as a physics well it's
not as bad as
some other games you can see this was
the current location
yeah I would probably have to
I don't know
um
we'll see if Amy shows up and then I
asked for talking
about this
as I had no idea
yes that is it for this
because I couldn't do this last time
things
gems okay
so I need to get over there looks like
you can do it from over here
anyway if I yeah if I get all the other
links I can still claim getting 100 of
the game
[Music]
so
that is this area cleared out let's
let's head over to the next area
right that's the test don't cover any
keys
feel free to browse my fine wear spiral
and spam Spence oh this is level
and an American way again
do I keep the visibility
where's the sound
nope I didn't get it keep it
so there is no
fire in the way
it is
one egg one light yeah that should be
too hard
so this is star 11.
yeah try to use Flame
but
I press the correct button but uh which
is wrong button in game
this happens sometimes
so I can't use eyes on those does that
mean guys because they're fine
lovely
is eraser
they are flying in Mexico's eyes they
should they should freeze and then fall
down
I guess that's the Restriction of ice
then
hey come back come back
[Music]
I didn't encounter and collecting issues
like this on my places but I know but
everyone is going thanks I'm the same
time yeah
Something game can be quite inconsistent
get out of my way
okay
it's just so annoying getting around on
this level
the biggest easy
make sure I don't miss anything
here okay
oh my
God
oh
oh
come on
[Music]
hey and then and then and then
you know I did that
okay okay
[Music]
me every jump
so he is something I already collected
thank you
wow
contain anything about that
I guess it could but that's
quite the challenge
[Music]
wow
how are things
[Music]
I need to wait this way to come down
and Below there should be an egg
uncut
this music is as great as other on the
Michigan game
let me take this way then
I love it all
right that's terrible
but I think it's my
what I like
eat less
is to
two way
stressful
if you got
I did that and now I have to start it
all over
boobies
why did I really love babies
mentioned before his
stepdaughter platform
[Music]
yeah I didn't get checkpoint
but now I have the checkpoint
oh
I think
he came back because I think he said to
everyone
I've seen
anyone is in this one maybe now
Embassy
I don't really have time to make none
same point
ah
and you're on the way okay
[Music]
and then I move up here it doesn't seem
to be anything up here
I do think I know where one of the inks
is
okay goes all the way over here we do
have
who I am
this is the our way okay
yeah I wish there was a few more of them
there's no entrance to the town
power sink
okay I found these two right
we all pronounce
[Music]
um
practice if you want to
she doesn't need my permission to do
that but apparently I need to do that
yeah this this is the difficult starting
prayer level
all right no it just dies
okay
one more time without dying this time
not die is however just a suggestion
thank you
yes there is this one
I'm about to get to it
what's that power I needed
yeah I think I think there was a power
up I needed
one jump
I can get it
yes there was
and but now I have the ball jump
that is just a legendary
and then it's just like
and there's a thing up there I haven't
been to yet so I guess
the egg is there
yay
oh
they need that for me
I see this one
this is moving slowly
yeah so that's the
yeah anything helps
so this is that was the light gem
so now since the age
and they start the ones that we're
having a painting
so I wonder if that's the one that holds
the egg
the result of the platform
then this platform here
didn't have an egg anyways
please
it would be
going here
this is ball Gadget
then there's Disney
this is kind of the wrong way
is that missing
it might be anything
because he has tried to fly to it
yep
that's the thing
oh that disappointment
that was
that was the most disappointed Treasure
Chest ever
oh yeah
awful gems the worst present
ever
well the egg was clearly not in that
thing
okay I assume
they sing leads me up to that platform
yep even though I could just fly to that
place immediately but then there's this
thing does this leave me somewhere
interesting
doesn't mean this lead me somewhere
where I might find an egg
and here we go
well there was no platform there yeah
the egg might be here or this is a
different place never give pressure gems
the confidence I mean
do
but not if it's an egg I want
I mean in real life I could trade
President James for an egg
where am I
I need to get back
I'll take place a chance I like gems
I clearly thank Jim
not jump up jump up
not that I expect anyone to do it but
that's a different thing though
Market face
yeah I can't go here because there's the
this thing is funny
even if I don't make it I can't stand
here
that make it
easy
you don't expect that one to ever give
you a gem in real life no I don't
I mean
honestly um
like if you have a gym of course uh
like
double kill
it's more like
desire
another step of the sea
okay
but just I don't think it developed gems
are valued as
they are made out to be
[Music]
good to that
thing which is
[Music]
oh there we go there it is there it is
Sunny there
not that
I need a power up
it's powered up
[Applause]
hey I need a key at least the door is
open now
okay you have key from here
like a particular kind of translation
there it is Thursday
and I got it
so I need a complete
that's the same element
I wasn't gonna need to sing
I mean it all the same I think but but
still
area clears there we go
and this is all there is
that all right I didn't need it
feel free to free to browse
going back
okay half an ice cream leaky licking the
lolly lolly
yeah there's a whole area here I haven't
explored yet
oh
for some reason
well I must clean the bunny
this is disrespectfulness
notify
oh yeah because I didn't have enough now
I remember
oh you can actually not use ice on these
flying enemies and snowing enemies
now I have enough light gems
but I got 97.
I'm finally
I didn't kill them it is fine
it is perfectly fine
you might be there
I mean
remember these things
[Music]
there we go
does this one contain
thanks
yeah collected on Dragon Age from set to
the model viewers that I liked from on
the front end
mode used to turn front end
[Music]
um how about the rear end
hey
I I mean
yes that was snake
no no
no no no no no no no
[Music]
no no no no no
wait I started all the way over here
is your best checkpoint here
[Music]
thank you
hydrated welcome Market man and person
welcome like Australia I don't remember
if I said welcome me
this was the last place I was getting
100 sure I mean it's the place you need
9 to 5 out of the 100 of the light gems
and so it makes sense
same time
plus it contains one light gem so you
need 95 out of the only 95 out of 99 we
have you can at most leave four like
skim somewhere else in the game it makes
sense this would be the last place
nothing
kill the whole thing I got nothing
kill me twice
so many roomies
okay Saturday must be up here
you wouldn't have airport swinging
section
that's it you wouldn't have bouncing
section 850 versus
[Music]
how is this supposed to time it ah
Shield
but he swings this
Wheels
ah another one where you have to use
this power up
and down there was one of them
I need to find the other one
oh oh I can destroy the water and then
die from it destroy the eyes and then
lie
I think and this problem in this
building is to get
into rice
it's a trap yeah
foreign
but you won't find anything behind that
gate I think you'd be safe now
anything
okay what's the point of the game
I mean
normally I don't tell people that's
I mean I have no problem discovering
that there is nothing that likes part
part of the gaming experience
I did
is it anything anyplace like go up
mommy said something
I just couldn't get both games open you
know what
out of spite
I'm going to get the boss case open
oh night gym
which proves that there's nothing behind
the key for me to click
the right team is warm
[Music]
oh there it is see
easy I can do this
okay okay I can do this I say or
something
[Music]
I can't wait where's the gate
and I forgot about that part
oh there you go whoa I did it
precious
okay yeah I really don't know what I did
developers didn't put the lights in
behind the gate here it's my consistent
I should have to eat
anyway that was pretty easy
well I got everything in that this area
and so the first bite Village is done
yeah I mean development make a decision
that doesn't make sense and
I'm so surprised
unless I can deflect those with the
shield thing
I'm better not supposed I can do this
game without this Shield
but in fact this is the only location
with water in this entire Realm
there's an interesting fact
that was in other realms
the only place there are frozen watering
but it's not swimmable water there
yeah that that is kind of interesting
okay there's this egg I can't find
either so I spent so long time it but
I'll try to do the same again
I'll go there I'll check the map
and see if I can figure out today which
it should be
and what was the name of the place
I Citadel because I spent so long trying
to find it last time now I will do it
the same thing again
um
that's the time is up
dancing
one more time
[Music]
okay where it is there there is the
picture
wipe it out with my Citadel
go
so let's
go through this thing one more time
[Music]
and clear and
similarly again
Mark those that I have
do that
so what do we have first
there we go yes
so first we have Sergeant bird which I
have cleared out
can mark that
and then we have all the eggs that
I have done like these seeds
I've collected all
the uh and in fact you can even make it
easier the only two missing is orange
and the
property concept purple pink red
while the way you want the orange one
and the way one
so
like a
select please so you got like the amber
egg I already got all those
can't begin selection and they've got
another one there which I got all those
and they got that one
and that one
which is awesome I didn't want it that
one is Flaming one more day and the
purple pink blue one so that's that one
I'm missing
one two three four five six
and there are seven
so at least this one makes sense the
hair unless
unlike the other ones so I'll go up
there and see if I can find it
[Music]
I was looking for that one for such a
long time
in that corner
[Music]
and like I said
excuse me
I guess I'll start by going up and
here's another place you need to use
water to get soon but I have to kill
some enemies first
guys on these enemies
shifting enemies the shooting so quick
I barely get get a chance to look at
them before they shot me
anyway
okay yeah
the days I can use this sounds
[Music]
but certainly not this enemy so where am
I sir this is a few more turns
so
here
yeah
I got a shield
[Music]
oh you can't place those enemies
what sway would an egg be here oh that
makes sense
that was actually a one
actually a hard practice to actually
find
unlike the other one the other ones
because as I started charging actually
side effects
and in the world
[Music]
this was another
probably most hidden in the game yeah
there was a several crazy one yeah is it
really something unlike
at all the cracks which are really
really obvious
[Music]
oh am I stuck here
annoying
well I guess I'll just have to find
another day
wait a minute
all right so it's only this I got
missing
[Music]
so here I'm missing a lighting in the
dark mine
I'll go there first
and then I'll go back to that scene and
see if I can
find it
let's see if I can find uh
[Music]
like this
oh you can place this enemies too I
guess
because it's not outside there we go
wait check all the eggs Palace on the
maps I surprised I could see under the
remaining I did check that and uh on the
remaining levels
and I got Alex dude I only got missing
one and it stayed that one
[Music]
tell me
all right where is she over here
I'm gonna use the map or
two eight when I only use it for one egg
because the other one I couldn't even
use this this is my fine wear spiral so
let's see you can take it oh five five
five five three three
so the light Jam is somewhere here
and this one looks the least exploring
foreign
like the map said you collect the other
person missing one that's a sign of that
unfortunately spawning bug
but
the thing the thing is I have collected
okay
it doesn't make sense as a despawning
bug eyed Edge
uh the only way it makes sense is if
it's a d if it removes from the tally
because
he's going to want to
watch my point there you go one one more
time the only only type of egg I'm
missing is this egg this type of egg
not not this a but this type of egg I've
done these two
challenges all other eggs I have
collected all eggs on according to the
game itself
it's only that type of egg I'm missing
so it must be this egg therefore I am
missing but I have collected this Edge
so
I have collected the egg
but then it must have subtracted it from
my collection
so I guess maybe that's what he meant
with despawning that it after you
collect it it doesn't save to your
collection
[Music]
laughs
guys
no no I'm going to collect this item
that's what I'm doing at the moment
all right yes
oh wait a minute I know know it yes I
know what latia means
the cycle over here feel free to browse
my findwares
no way this
[Music]
it's one of the corridors where you
have that thing and there's like a light
gem
I've seen the light gem but I was unable
to collect it
which door is it
not that don't worry
is this door I need to go out there
okay
let's go
and yes I think I think the lighting was
here
yep the single jump playing technique
nutrient Lab Rats
which is is just buggy
I got a single jump line is terrible in
this King you have to do jump jump
and to fly
but I don't want to do a double jump to
fly
and let's see if I can remember
thank you
out of scanneries
okay now I got a T5 these nuts wait wait
wait wait
enough
because
the one light gem I know I didn't
collect unless I did collected through
another means I love you is confusing
everything yeah that's also a
possibility
is the one
where I could see it but I never picked
it up let's just give that's the best
description I have after I think
I did see it but I didn't pick it up
but I don't feel like it was in this
level I feel like it was in a different
level but this level has its own Valley
yeah this level is
wait a minute
how is it too am I stupid yeah I'm
stupid
this might be the level uh that has the
last year I was thinking of
yeah which is also missing one and this
one is a missing one I didn't pay
attention and so there's so there's
another Lighting in this
way
I guess I'll just uh
where's this part say silent
okay it's going to add
alsoever has shown up
so sorry I've been nice of you to show
up yeah and you you did show up and you
have actually not
uh
clearly I don't pay attention to your
names only colors
today is one last yeah that's why well
hello
especially
oh I'm getting attacked I need to take
back especially when people don't even
say hello
yeah they just show up talk and join the
conversation but it's perfectly fine
everyone is allowed to join the
conversation but I hear it I hear it
facing this room
it might not be in this room
can it stop spawning I'm trying to sink
right there it is
I have a habit of showing up without
saying hello
well that's fine
I just
wasn't paying attention to your name
oh come on
yeah after
I just want to get these two live gems
and then I'll get them go and go and go
see what the issue with that other egg
is
consider myself having completed the
game 100 even if I cannot get that egg
because the game research dating
[Music]
yeah and
and as I said unless the map is
incorrect with these colors
or I'll check the event
or the
or the uh when I did that level and show
that I did collect that egg
assuming is this one it's somewhere here
when I use that start from here
someone here there's a room but I can
see the light gem I just need to figure
out a way to get up to it
this is the place I came from so this is
the start of 11th
so I know where it is I just I'll just
rush through the lemon until I get to
that place
I believe the egg this fun bug happens
because the eggs stayed its object in
flag and your total number of eggs are
also separated so they can easily desync
when they switch to a mini game right
after collecting one
okay
so it is possible that uh it's the mini
game Egg and I it didn't jump
from the from the turtle minigame
over here
yeah there it is that snake
let's take this like him
that just need to find a way to get to
out
okay that doesn't work it was what it's
right
wait can I do this
50.
what I wanted to shoot me you don't
shoot me stick with your butt excuse me
come on
okay
yeah it's a project I I can do something
I didn't fix it on GameCube but
not yet applied that that was the piece
yeah for this one
I have proof that I did it
that's enough I mean
okay that's not tiny TV but there are
platforms I could jump to
ta-da okay
where am I and now it's checkpoint I
went all this way without the signature
a bit stingy with the checkpoints
oh
there are extra cheat code can give you
all the bonus stuff from the eggs I know
but it's not the bonus stuff I want it's
the 100 completion I want
I'm doing a complete completion
completion one of me
thank you
oh yeah I can start one jumping
anything now
on
okay this is going to take away
okay so I need to learn there's a
platform okay
all right is this all I have to do
okay
this is
all the light gems
a message about getting online
so therefore it is a single
I forgot about that
so there's that single okay I'm left and
it's likely the minigame
come on
okay you can't do that
says
what is The Shield cute for
what I useless
what a history
the water ability about this verse
what's your ability of the shields
ability
Water Shield which is the worst ability
yep
there it is elasticities
hey
I have done 100 of the game
what brand is at least good against fire
enemies because of increased range so
that actually does kill fire enemies
because I've never tried it
yeah I guess I guess the shield thing
but which and because you have the
boomerang in me when you should be using
the one what you're learning and have to
use that one
but I did complete the game 100 that is
my claim
I have my uh bonds to prove it
well go double check if you actually
gotten the eggs but I have
I can't fuzzle checking it
[Music]
shouldn't I bring up the board to show
that I did it
let's do that let's prove that I did it
and
file
which one is it
I think I think this one
foreign
[Music]
let me
it is this is the wrong one
so and now we
let's
just find the key because
okay send it paint
any audio remember some things
why is there an audio
hello

attempt because I did like 20th nope
okay

[Music]
I had to check a YouTube video to see if

and I saw it and
a beautiful
that's a Andrew dragonfly was embarking
