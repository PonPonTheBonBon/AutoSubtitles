[Music]
o use not say feature do not remove
memory cards 8 megabyte from for leg
controller or reset switch of the
console blah blah blah blah blah would
you like to create yeah that sounds like
a good
idea oh
it's is authorization
again but why does it open wrong
browser want I need to authoriz yeah mix
up no intro just go straight in
it and the voice is kind of
low to establish yeah you're trying to
connect the wrong browser you as
us
fa I mean you didn't even try this time
come
on why you mixing up
like or did the mistake with when trying
to establish a connection therefore it's
just this is just a batt I think we can
skip
that there's no intro I
guess okay press start
I'm not sure why it
like resets the where is the mouse
Dy a TK was cancelled not sure what
you're talking about
now why is
it being annoying at the moment I should
I forgot to start it
up he anyway R hey P remember random
events can happen mid game and I mean
you don't have to tell
me ER how to play the game you
know
apparently the just doesn't like
to connect for some
reason it's like a 30 seconds 40 seconds
lat though oh yeah it is very
laggy why is it so laggy all a
sudden now I should be
working there we go
the mouse isn't
working much better yes now it's
working that one doesn't
count so I hope want to see it
again okay you did see the star yes it
did show
up is the so because I
think no I don't think touch that
although
so is everyone
here is everyone seeing the stream
again very good
time now that one I shouldn't
touch this
and no to too
much I could like exclude that part
there you go that's a full
picture now let's place it somewhere in
the
middle why so be so stupid like if I
have this in a folder I cannot set it in
the
middle but I want it in a folder because
I want it organized but when I put it in
a folder I can no longer move it
properly is it working yes it's working
now it's now it's everything is working
as it's
yeah so as I was going to say Ed is that
now I have played this game before so
but still you shouldn't really tell me
what will happen that's kind of part of
you know playing and discovering
yourself
audio
music and environment Max sunfix Max
dialogue not Max for some reason even
though it's a bit too
quiet let's load music slight okay I'll
let you I'll let you see what happen
yeah that's kind of what I
want this one is using the
uh regroup charge up attack what are
those r one two okay there we go
configuration oh custom that's
nice oh I can't change
CU oh I change it like that it don't
press wait
was yeah they use
that
okay I'm going to change that okay there
we
go I
think I don't know if you want to switch
the card or
not I I'll try switching it okay there
we go let's hopefully that
work oh language probably has to
standard five languages English German
Spanish French Italian yes there we
go nothing strange
there okay so because I restarted the
stream it didn't want to play ads again
although I C Del light further I have to
play the ads to it just runs to the ad
so it can
then so quick stre minutes a I should
have done that when I through the
settings I
gu I go through look through no polish
trash I I go to the other settings I
mean I'm just looking
around oh look you can check the
evolutions already okay let's ignore
that
then high score just one high
score multiplay why what would you have
multiplayer high
scores
okay this rock has done well
uh credit oh yeah let's check the
credit he going to say he's going to
freeze
now the tunnel just ends oh it's
actually not is just going to play the C
match that's weird okay nothing more
interesting
there well
then I guess we can take the digital
we got
agamon
fish bird I don't remember all these
names why doesn't it say what the name
is like this plenty of
space some
dude
comeon
gilon pon
on the
I
on the this was a
Von and I don't remember this SP
random also the game I'm making is based
on this game
oh oo Pon I guess I'm going to go
through the order again just kind of
keep track of which haven't used and
which I'm not used yet I think that's
fair easy I I'll probably start with
hard just to see how hard it is and then
if I need because I do want to challenge
when I play the
games I hope that's
acceptable in order makes sense
yeah
so
this so yeah these are branching part
hard to easy maybe I should go towards
easy because it's easy on hard
mode do I think if I remember correctly
if you lose your Force down so maybe I
should try to go up at
first
I don't
remember anyway let's begin jungle ruins
versus
the probably get the name well this is
no one's using this character so
okay no names everyone is
unnamed it seems like giving names of
the characters in a
large character fighter seems like
you're reasonable thing to
do no names on the he
bar
okay this doesn't oh wait that's what
the jav
attack all right all
right and this was jump
oh all
right the animations are more fluid
[Music]
but
but
it's place just a
a well what's very
bouncy
ow oh I had so little heal I didn't
even keep track of my health there it's
not this
obvious this time you don't have a time
limit on how long you
evoled
ow can I oh
yeah you have up and down
and
neutral
special you have you have an up
down yeah wa
what why did I jump so high all of a
sudden stop
that inity oh invisibility sounds
good and then you can do
like your destru do that
okay now I'm
coward stop running
away stupid
ground I'm I'm losing
already long range
attack stop
that
perfect phant on you're sort of
opponent's Ally the
opponent so that did very good first
match Contin Pro gu F lost if you do not
oh you don't say
do do you oh hello
bu okay if you lose you nothing happens
okay another character now
easy would you like to continue if you
don't continue you're not you're not
going to
continue thanks for stating the
obvious okay
that that that went
terrible the end to
win no wait I'm not
ready Co attack wait stand
up but you're such long range
[Music]
attacks okay can I
I think
I everything works
fine but I don't want to flip that
around
back as it was
before because I I'm pressing the okay
back to the game
now lead what
already is this the opponent stronger or
something have higher the defense whoa
whoa
whoa it's not I mean you could argue
well it's supposed to
be a hard opponent but seems like
this oh
W long can I do this far okay that
long
didn't mean
to did not mean
to pick it up even not but that I had no
idea what it was okay I'm getting
murdered
here hey
[Music]
what perfect
perfect this isn't going that
great maybe hard is too hard if this is
kind of funny maybe I should try to go
for medium as with the previous
game that's should press
not yes eh no move to
This Time medium is stand the difficulty
instead of
easy okay a different starting
opponent or character now see okay
actually don't remember which is that
that
Pon they only could give names of
characters in this
game who need names of
characters
okay now let's do
this
exell hey stop that
three special effects look so
weird
excellent don't give
that excellent the way to drop these
things
perfect yeah there there we
go
perfect I
mean you're supposed to already know
their names from watching this show no I
can't remember that oh do did it have to
be
on oh yeah there should have been same
opponent okay I win okay so if you lose
you have to should I go uper
down I go for hard first or should I
mean l I should work myself to TS
hard I I'll I'll start with the bottom
and then I'm work myself
up the moves are too spamable in this
game okay
let's wa so he was going to jump off the
level
there shaking hands sh
shakings shaking hand means something
different from what I was going
for
oh me all right
ow
aha now I'm up here too late though now
now this thing is gone you do that drop
through whoa
whoa touch
strength
H well I guess that
works
perfect
oh fall down
yes
perfect I'm winning this
I'm winning this
di this is a stupid
level take
that oh I have Max Health
already ow that was that must have hurt
a bit
yes at least you're not fighting P not
yet we'll
see PS to yeah can I wasn't the great
stage I let's continue danger
Gul secret
mode big be the big to be the
big wait against one
opponent thir now B want just fell off
everything isn't little being meant to
be like four player oh the road again

below
broke
Nick oh you should too many
projectiles excellent yes
Health you have too much
health oh

one and also still
invisible excellent
ow to punch you there we
go oh
fire
perfect hello fun
hello s nice to see you here
kidos do you want a hint no what I mean

depends you unlocked little versus
pig I still think that's meant to be
like a PO player because you can be
four let's continue to Lava
Lake I'm not sure what kind of oh Glide
can GL
what creepy face hello
serby ni
coming okay knock
out I'm going to punch you down to Lava
no okay I guess we both went in the lava
you don't drown in this
lava who who who
who get out of
here okay this game has the same rule as
in wait I'm supposed to pick no I should
not have picked that up I mean it's
still in the lead though so I
guess
yeah there go win
I hello hello here to escape an anxit to
SP I hope I hope it's caling enough here
for you to be here cute bunny girl thank
you uh feel free to stick around here
and uh if you have anything you want to
talk about so feel free
to is this based of Adventure O2
era surprise
attack uh it's I think it's the the
three
first oh yeah Adventure 2 and
Tamers Sports wait is is uh it's still
not still not logged
in I forgot to press log that was also
why this was yeah problem was I was
running off the wrong Network when I
started streaming before I didn't pay
attention so many things
to how did you fail and win a i I didn't
fail you you fail at keeping at the
track of what's going
on that's all I can
say waa whoa wao you're you're
aggressive okay now I can't see because
Mi stuff launched okay let me refund the
outfit change and now you can do the
outfit change and have it change and now
back to the game
um both I thought O2 and Tamers are
separate yeah I mean yes they the
digimons are from B you got agamon wait
didn't they show
up maybe they didn't show no no I'm
confusing I'm
confusing uh yeah they are they are
digim from both
unon is
one
inity I need to remember how to go
down oh yeah the water is insta kill
see
excellent you're not black anymore you
are
purple it's interesting that H when it
comes to uh Nintendo
characters uh I
think
like dark Samos and Dark Link is it Dark
Link dark pit at least are known as
black in Japan you un like black just
like in these characters known as black
so if they went with the same kind of
localization it would be known as dark
instead
uh try now yes weird I don't know weird
yeah so I have to redo this level now
cute
wait what what what is it s I feel PS2
version of dig rum Arena 2 is much
different from this GameCube I'm
actually amazed how is
it I'm play like the GameCube version
once I play the PlayStation 2 version
most how is it different
cuz this is what they remember so now
okay the actual battle
now the B was supposed to
happen ow ow oh it actually still hurts
all the way over there stop moving
around and trying to hurt
you the lead perfect
perfect
perfect The Stomp attack is too powerful
like it has really long long not not
super long range
but oh
whoa oh Max Health I'll take that no it
does not Max all the heal up stop going
through the platform
we just jumping too much jumping around
it's a little
[Applause]
fighting yes stand
there waa I did not expect it
ow yes and it's spawn before I can win G
again again oh right
yeah
uh
rematch controls and
Arenas I mean yeah I mean controls would
be different
that's different
controller but I thought the Arenas were
the
same I also noticed that this
black thing doesn't fill up the whole
thing slightly annoying me there we
go I wish it could like expand this kind
an expand but it's not work as I wanted
to now it's a
four no it's only three
characters no no no fight fight with
each
other
ignore
me
excellent yes
BB bomb
burst and I didn't have to do anything
no
no ignore
me I'm yes
I'm just here dancing and you to
can are just standing here dancing and
you can fight each other it sounds like
a good
deal no what what are you coming here
for yeah go go away from here I'm
peaceful I mean you didn't even ow I
jumped up in icles me show you didn't
even try to attack me but before I
started attacking
you
me too many
icicles and Al the slippery level
especially down here come
here
ow whoops I did not mean to beat that
up
oops
oh ow ow
ow again oh
oh
there's no Autos scoring toy area with
Des pistons in there I don't know we'll
see uh you will see you
soon ow get away from
here I'm trying to read chat oh no CA
caor caor is that like a cactus
minur okay let's fight you
then no don't pick that
up okay I guess we have to wait that out
before we can start
fighting H it's
caon is he I don't know the names of the
evolutions why can't you drop down oh
that was rude stupid
ice yes no stay down there no no
no perfect
in this is was like hard was way too
hard medium is way too easy is there
like a medium
hard you got aore well thank
you enter your name well my name
is why does it say enter name I'm
certainly they mean ENT initials but
it's not like everyone has like three
initials
anyway that feels very Anglo Centric
does that even work in
Japan well I guess that was
everything
game game
[Music]
over yeah I probably need a name of
every Digimon look now now it says I win
press any button to continue I guess a
stands for any button there's no a
button on this PlayStation
controller you unlocked ice
palace and you have to wait for a whole
s to read before you can continue and
then you have to go over to single play
if you can't remember
that your
Digimon gon or something I don't
know I know what it I know what the name
is I done the eases now I know what the
name is after completing the single
players wait wasn't wasn't that one same
message as
before versus that Ivy Monon
thing yes I I know I should know him
from watching the show
but
this this like isn't that ability to
puke fish or
something yes Here We Go Fish
puking I tried to here we
go think if you destroy that thing it's
does
spawner pick up oh look it did come on
get up why
not stupid
fish know this no I think
be no invincibility I guess I have to
invoid the opponent
more
it's way too easy to
avoid I say while I yeah there we
go but that I had that
for
okay all right all right
ow there we
go no don't touch that I can't touch it
though I think that's
fine
Leon or
something who knows what their names
are I
mean Super
ah combo where is my combo
me
perfect who need evolving I'll win this
without evolving
once
ow I
died but I didn't say without dying
so perfect infinite
combo at least against the compete yeah
yeah okay my combo was
cancelled oh yeah this flash attack too
no I don't know anyway I won
that's what count oh P
girl this game basically have no story
at all which is kind of weird maybe you
do the hard rout this yeah I
mean I'm trying to get to the every
ending
so well I'll
do I need to figure out the pattern here
wait why is is it the exact same
p
I do the lower one three times the upper
one three times I
guess I guess I
guess anyway DG Ray dgol alter attack
three times three times I can barely do
it once I have I have not done it a
single I think if I remember correctly
this is the slowest if it was just
once because because when you die you do
defa one
stage camera starts very low
down yeah I know I can I read the whole
instruction don't have to tell me the
again because if for this to work you
need to spawn a lot
of uh evolver things which it does not
do when you just do
Jabs well wouldn't I do Jabs that's how
you you kind of have to do specials I
think that's
a I mean that
helps not a
wus I'm a
wers
yeah this
is
see what do I
have oh
nice oh that that one spawns a lot of
some so basically use specials a lot of
specials and
heal
wa stop that
stop
sleeping you are so terrible so terrible
I'm back uh now I'm back to stage one
and we have made no
progress perfect this is this is going
to take half the stream I feel
like I was worried
about that this will take forever this
will take forever because whenever I do
it once I and then I have to do it two
more
times and then to and then even
traveling around is oh Max house nice I
appreciate
that yeah that gives me
noty what like when you do
the defeat the uh big to be big little
versus Big D name game
of H the are no h orbs
spawning this game should just have more
orbs spawning or the orbs that are okay
they should spawn more often but the
orbs should also be worth
for
oh no of course
see now I I dropped the
health fell out of my [ __ ]
it don't now you back one level
[Music]
again but not back to okay if I do a
combo I also get
it this
helps right now you're back to First
Stage again and no progress has been
made
okay uh yeah we're going be here for yep
so what Digimon is that which one which
one the one pump's using
uh I don't
remember
Bon we will be here for a long
time okay yay time to die because that's
how we play this game
mode cuz there's no point of evolving if
I don't have full health and I get full
health by
D because it was the first
stage oh
evolve no I can't die though come on
don't Ste it from
me I got
Hammer
nice oh
you more can I can throw the
hammer and
spin
okay come on come here come
here this been quite a long
time oh no I need to ow oh
nice and then I only have to use it I
don't have to hit someone with it yes so
wow I okay okay so this um max Evol
things do seem to appear more often oh
there it
is so there me there
something and then die again to evolve
so
weird H I forgot the name see no one
remember his name that was a bit cheap
on no so you need to get a plus HP spe
to see without a ring out
no no you need to uh do evolve to
Max which is three stages and then at
this third stage you need to basically
evolve again but that's doing your
Ultra uh which normally will not de
evolve you but in this game mode it
does and then you start over and that's
how you get point and then you have to
do that three times at least you do it
it saves it and the opponent can't do
anything about that
but and this is a bad level for doing
this on to because you have this s
spawning at the edge of the level on a
bouncy platform
oh
nice now why did you spawn on
me
ow health I did take
Health
oh see nothing's cheap in this game mode
nice if the game allows it exactly at
least I as like
computers all actually tells me about
that I think it's because I used the
uh G you need to Evol twice and you
still times I gu see why it will take a
while yep and every time you die you de
evolve oh stop picking them
up
need to pay attention when they spawn
here can I stand here and spawn on me no
that aners my question about standing
there oh it's
there but there's so little Health
left
lammed in the head oh oh no I took
damage from landing on top of the
tree oh
nice another
one po
gun it just Wast a bit with a
hammer
ow oh come
on why can't you drop through this
platform this is a bit
risky
oh com go for
something come on stop stop doing that
it doesn't help because it don't get
any can't get anything from that
no I barely ever used the grab not not
the computer either
[Music]
so okay um there's a health here no it
Des spawned
oh this has spawn no it is still there I
didn't see
it so what I
need not for the opponent die because
that doesn't spawn
anything I'm me sure if you have
more okay so if you stand up here
come on come on
stop do this stom thing there we
go
oh
Max there we
go
boom two times oh
no I should have died I forgot to
die I forgot to
die oh wait there's another one there
another well that doesn't help I should
let the computer
first oh nice
I guess I could
have Max Health
nice yes
perfect I was about to
die
we up all of
them still have full head was there a SC
here yes and last
time
winon finally holy snap this go some for
yes if they only did one old try will be
fine but no they had to do
three they had to do three h time you un
like the ra and I will never play it
again I mean okay at least if you like
playing four
players still still terrible
though so I can do the low one3 I wanted
to do like
uh oh I
did
trade welcome ra there Martin
Lou
welcome welcome
to pon pon
stream I'm pon pon and a
bunny I play
games many different
games currently
playing
Digimon f finally I finally defeated
that
level so
how so how was your stream going and why
did you say to right
here and I
hope
hello all right I'm happy to
see yeah
so and I hope and do take any breaks you
need and
uh oops well I I guess that worked my
favor anyway
this just a regular knockout here
so oh
again
ow
perfect for regular
Bells evolving isn't really
a yeah they really need to redesign this
game a bit feel
like they have they have an idea here
they just need to polish it a
bit win you can pick up the TNT if you
all right that's true that's the
thing gamon that was the name I found a
star man
yep
so try and trying
to split the number of playthroughs
like like I done that I could do this
one oh surprise attack so I'm trying to
do every battle too oh that one's gon
apparently that's
gon it's gon gon G
on I guess if it's like
uh reduce vowel it doesn't really we
could spell it with any fou in that
case black
Gabon angon gon and then there's one
more I think there three black Digimon
knock battle Until the End win survive
until the end to win go
up I'll go wherever I want I I know you
mean
like you mean on the map The W nice
stash get
up
oh w w I did not think that would
happen I was
busy in being being an
attack which I guess is why the computer
attacked
ah I don't know how
much stop doing
that excuse
me excuse me oh IO like this one extra
life extra life that's
not the lead op
just an extra life like
that and no
effort like it took his smash BR quite a
while to even add an extra life and when
they did that they you had to
go stop pushing me against the wall like
that can you destroy these can you pick
them up no you can't destroy them oh it
actually contain an
item
the lead
perfect stop freezing

Noy oh no don't want that
FY
perfect
invincibility invin
ability perfect finally
no again how did this
CH it's invincibility and
invisibility can't fish so now I can
read I know it's from something I saw
years ago but the person actually was
actually serious I didn't know the
difference between invincibility and
invisibility uh quite a while ago but a
long long time
ago
I saw the two as same word and I did not
know why invincibility and invisibility
was like what what I also it was
invisibility and was not sure why you
would be Invincible with
invisibility uniy why what's going on is
the timer
broken
good what what kind of face is that wait
there's a score for kicked in the
pants um i k maybe I should look over
the scores more oh anyway this is like a
boss battle I
guess but let's play the
ads and
then something
something and
then
so everyone can see the so every so
everyone can see
the do you like the
design also if you like the and B is a
yellow bunny looking thing I will murder
the yellow bunny looking
thing and you can always yeah see it and
you can do pronoun if you want
to the
pronouns if you
want if you want them to show up in chat
can take up to five minutes before it
actually shows up because it only pulls
the chat it only pulls the service every
so like every five minutes if it's been
more than 5 minutes since the last check
point you're going to check again
Che I could
reduce like 10 minutes 15 minutes white
bunny Supremacy yes white bunnies are
best yeah I see it what do you see red
the r Edge red red there is red in your
name razor red J
anyway eraser Edge the second
I don't
remember and I don't know what the name
of this character is
so see
face face
face so this is an interesting pause and
then going take the
and I'm going to try to spread out the
uh so I do every level an about an equal
number of
times so the first steps the very first
battle I have to do six time the second
two I do three times each next one I'll
do two times each the fourth one I have
to do once each but two of them I have
to do twice the fifth I have to do once
each but one of them twice and on the
sixth one I'll do them
once not counting how many times I have
to retire because I failed that's a
different
thing anyway let's let's
go no one's using that character you
won't fail well thank you look it's a
bunny
half yellow half Brown o hello
rexis it's a bunny
thing who whoa whoa whoa whoa W no no
don't throw me
off I'm dying I'm dying nope I'm not oh
I'm still
dying
can can you stop
throwing
bananas wow I just
died
stop no
no w
evil
spells oh oh no I'm dying no I'm dying
ah I'm dying I'm
dying you lost uh
yeah I forgot what I usually
use can I still do it though but this
game do seem to give you the high squore
before you can continue which is makes
sense because you still got that
score so at least I can enter the
score and then I can retry assume yes
this is how the first game should have
work this is how a lot of game should
work I think Smash Bros has the same
issue you can offer like half of your
points or something in Smash Bros for
continuing but what you achieved before
you press continue should still be a
record itself
because you can choose to not continue
and save that record it should save
anyway wait does he have a bir attack
yeah bananas and B
and and and
stuff how about them
bananas I like beans I don't think that
was a burp
though
goodbye here we go can I do a 3
Z but I'm getting too cocky
again and this lasers stop
appearing ow ow I went straight into
that Release Me
can you like oh okay I can't see I guess
I went to yeah can you like stop
standing
here can we actually
fight like
real Digimon go that's how we
fight I didn't go through I didn't know
what start to happen with the whole
level and anything once kid score 7 out
to five oh oh oh oh 14% K thank
you okay Tiny Terror D doer King combo
First Strike standup guy leading expert
purist free loader excuse
me my loads are not free I mean h oh no
the part attack is literally a war
Edition but more
slim why slim wait what no
nothing absolutely nothing oh wait where
is there still like 8,000 Dro
frames well i' completed with it would
be nice to have like you unlock neemon
not confused with
v yeah like chaos Wasteland
it's
chaos it's probably a wasteland
too all of this
stage I
mean
digim who
neon I guess I'll continue
then bad
time I don't don't know what your people
are making faces
about the controllers are not using the
actual button froms I'm using she is a
fire based mon wait the
bird
okay he
yo
no what what are you
doing it doesn't look
fiery doesn't look
fiery doesn't look fiery looks looks
nature
based there we go it has a combo I three
combo though probably like more more
hits but just
counting I mean I counted but let's see
no now there's
Cactus with gloves get out of here you
[Music]
stupid well that move is very spamable
close sometimes like a lot of these orbs
shows up okay there we go now there's a
flying
Firebird

based now I see what you
meany I take
that thank you for your
sympy yes what a
combo I'm going three Ser this
one can I CH this up oh I
can
I'll take
that you take took it but
whatever I think those teeth does not
look that great you should probably have
those looked over checked
over see you will see trust me I did see
but this pink barar doesn't look like
Fire based looks nature based
ptor
okay this is third and final time I do
this
one triple jump still not using that
character I can't triple
jump and then I will go up the next
one I go up and down up and down this
time Knock Out b
battle the Digimon that is the most
knocked out is the loser of
course oh invisibility
invincibility
invisibility it took the commentator a
while to realize what it
was nice that you're trying to hurt
someone who's
Invincible
oh I'll become a fire
bird I don't know what bird's name is
though oh I'll
become I need to that oh I need that I
need
that
now it's like fighting
type is this oh no there's still fire
they
firefighting look at those uh
non-transparent textures on the wings
it's it's due to the invisibility effect
I don't know if that's like we play on a
genuine play to if that's still
happening oh this of course does that
same thing
with it's fire one I'm going
toat there we go fire one
5 by but Rec Phoenix actually well I
guess against guess a phoenix not not a
firefight a firefighting Phoenix kicked
in the p and oh KO opponent well I

did oh you mean uh you don't have
instead of recording every Digimon no
and you don't save time on the recording
by also recording say Player 1 2 3 4
that adds more lines of dialogue
by not by instead using the Dig name
which the commentator is doing for every
other
thing they didn't need more lines of
dialogue why did that take such time up
here because I mean obvious the the
record line isn't the digital name plus
like the thing that happened like T Del

line oh you jump down

terribly extra life despawn rude yay as
soon soon as I was going to pick it up
to Loser thank you King combo red head
is the stepchild
what now what is this someone has to
translate this to English for
me probably some English expression for
something redheaded stepchild that's
what it
said
and I have no idea what it
means I've already defeated this stage
this level once
before and after
this except the two first will obviously
be the two ones
done
but after that is going to be new
options W I got super
chocked super no I don't want
to no come on that was
mine my name was wait I do got
it so I didn't get it didn't look like I
got
it it was any for some form
of information like oh
nice the kind of scream was
that I'm falling off the
[Music]
level I guess
my no I was trying to
survive
yeah I can't pick this up
though I can't really inflict self
damage please
me oh bomb someone should pick it up
maybe the
computer yes no this is not even the
computer wants
it there we
go then I'll stay up
here no why did you die so quickly with
it oh already got ma sense
I can't
up
no I wonder
if that was great intimidation well
thank
you I'm not I wasn't sure
how I was say ble to imitate something
bad
wow wait already
dead it's basically I'm the unfavorite
to put it nicely
oh oh
well I guess people aren't aren't F fond
of red heads
then lost to the
dog
yep wait is that a problem
that's rough oh there you come there
there's the
pun there's the pun get it I do get it I
can I can acknowledge
it I mean it depends on how much delay
it this probably some delays because
like 8 and a half thousand frames drops
for some reason I don't know
why is in stable now just sometimes it's
drops a lot what
you're trying to go after
me like you're on sometime team like
you're kind I
voiding my are
lost is that a start option here resume
option
quit I don't know what quit
us sometimes it quits
everything I mean I could check what
quit
does okay let's see what quit does I
mean not that it takes too long
to G prob we lost probably it probably
goes back to the menu exactly it does go
back to the manyu F it let's keep back
he let's use the time machine and just
jump
off you
lost
another game without the restart
option quite a surprise oh forgot about
safe States yeah that's the
thing that's why I Tred it because they
safe
States I'm not going to use save states
to beat games I mean I did it twice in
two games one each game because they had
like impossible levels that spend over 3
hours on each level I think I think at
that point it's
fair but I mean it's fair how much safe
St I want use on my own but my goal is
to not use it I'm trying to play the
games as they
independent oh take
that I want a
[Music]
digal or do I want to
survive maybe I want to
survive look they're both off to
me I the lead or something
wait why to take
this
oh
again
can't really do it
now
nice
oh another
one wait that doesn't help
me what V I have oh
it's
what I think the game is a bit confused
I think the game is too confused as
shows to show up when you are knocked
out then you press W but it doesn't R
now because I'm
not game is play or
something oh
nice
attack at least disappear now when I won
guess
there does have some a correction that
way wait we are both powered up here we
should fight against the one who's not
powered
up wait can you collect your own health
immediately
INB
oh
no come on they knocked me out so
quickly ah now we're
talking
see that I'm
invisible
oh
go whoa whoa
whoa
okay it's one onone
now that's
good can dig that sounds
good and I take that now you took
it very
rude
nice all right all
right okay and Max Health that sounds
good especially if the opponents get it
of the work got the he down to a
quarter no no no

realize ad start it I didn't realize the
ad went through completely as well that
that took the whole head to
do oh kicked in the pants I had porn
this was quite the batt to do I forgot
say stay space Speedway
flashbacks that was one of those
moments obviously do this one
oh swim seit oh no I didn't realize I
have I was so focused on winning that
battle is that a boulder floting about
your it's said
the I think I said what was I think I
see why G voling is more difficult in
this game than the first one
yeah definitely more difficult wait who
was this
again oh yeah I'm not I will get to know
who it is after
winning Victory outfit
Noory to
throw no
you we
go that is omnimon oh

howon
arimon well looks like I'm going to do
all six run through in one
stream I mean I still still have
like with this seven on a row so these
are the two last one for
the4 but I do still have like more
characters to unlock which I guess is
the two final
ones but going to 100% this game without
even using every ton I guess I will I
guess it will be a second uh stream then
and then
I'll use the other digimons just to use
them I guess so it's that way they give
you SC SC by probably because I was uh
blocking more than 50% of the
battle
probably wait this spawned how

of the the whiskers of goton in the
r that's an
error did they render it against a black

quality of the
game right

oh I did
grab so do you like pineapple pizza yeah
that's good
no yes yes Edge yes but I'm still
losing going to call me a freeloader
again I knew it I mean I think I've said
that before I I'm fine with most
toppings on pizza and CH is the best
pizza I don't think you ever had that
but I've had
tuna and that's also
good
and that's also
good
well at least the boss threw me that
way
go so we threw each other off that's
that's more than
fair that wasn't that up
attack well I take
that stupid bus
oh the it came back down with
you is
Victorious gon is
Victorious don't worry I like finable
pizza yeah I mean it's fine
topping people are just crazy I've heard
like oh you shouldn't have like the
pineapple is too much is like a fruit
and it has like is it's like um liquid
is it has a lot of liquid in it and lot
yeah yes so does tomatoes and those
belong on Pizza like you can't have
different Arguments for different fruits
on
Pizza pineapple is okay pineapple with
prawn is good yeah that's a good one you
unlock duskmon which does not seem to
have as evil name as everyone else where
is like Twilight Mon
and evening
mon Sunshine mon that sounds like a very
hard
boss do you mind if I Boop this S I mean
that could be a nice redeem I
guess bu S I guess I could
maybe maybe do like I could do a basic
animation that just shows up on screen
along with some sound effect which I
still should add to the outfit
changing what can be made to taste good
on food and isn't terrible belongs on
that food yeah see that's
good but problem is that people claim
that pineapple doesn't tast no actually
have people make the claim that it
doesn't taste good I'm not sure if
people make that claim they say doesn't
belong
carrot
Pizza there we go let do quick
evolve we
go oh no I'll take
that for some reason despite having this
one it does not
like
[Music]
this time it's went quick but probably
oh where did this come
from get rid of this bomb
freny
extra life yes extra
okay I wanted to
see oh no why did you Che that
up take
that what see with the
opponent it tastes good for me so scre
him yeah I I didn't like pineapple and
pizza was a perfectly fine
combination had food for a long time and
then someone just decided it was a bad
thing and then everyone just like read
for some weird reason and then it became
an internet thing there a
thing a thing I actually don't like
about the internet is when people don't
have kind of opinions of their own they
just copy whatever opinions they hear a
lot on the internet and then decide that
that's their opinion now too even though
they don't agree
or or they might
like yeah that that's feeling I
get I should probably read more
comments you prefer the taste of fresh
pineapple cook to cooked
pineapple yeah I mean you could have
fresh pineapple and pizza too
this is my
cage
ow get out of my
cage pineapple pizza needs to be
exterminated with extreme prejudices
maybe maybe maybe if you don't like it
you don't eat it that seems like a
better option
here I don't really like pineapples and
that's fine and that's that's that's
perfectly fine if you don't like
it I mean I get I guess that edge is
just
joking but I feel like people taking it
way too
far when they start to hate on people
who who just
yeah
ohal
metal I'm still alive and I'll try
to why are you running away
handar me out pineapple lovers and
haters need to set aside the difference
to defeat the known as mayonnaise and PE
on Pizza I know may no no that
it's how do you call it in
English I should not know I think is a
different sauce That's goes on Pizza
mayonnaise some pizza I could see that
peace yeah I mean M with
peace yeah I could see that I I see no
problem with m& p on pizza I've never
had it but I don't imagine it being
bad this time I'm just going straight
up I not even again what in the
ACT I'll show you
later H oh yeah re I don't know what
regroup it's just increase health and
you can you put it the me CH yes there
you go cage match it's only mean in that
cage and everyone has a match outside it
okay wait someone is knocking on the
door okay so back

three hours so I'm going
to plan was to finish this and end the
stream there and then I
will see how easy it gets to defeat this
boss using the abilities I

priority this oh that looks good can I

finding a company is willing to produce
an AR and then we need a certain number
of people who actually contribute to

amount and so that you purchase your P
Pon plushy you might want more than one
I looked no while I was busy and
couldn't see what was happening in can

mess it is quite a mess it's a very
messy mess no bro what mean
3x3 so this
is so yeah and because I and I really

someone snoring yes because someone was
they were sleeping
to two p p pluses regular an evil P
okay I guess that would be a stretch
goal so you have like regular pon
pon flhy knock battle ready but if you
achieve a certain extra above the the
the intended original
goal you
would you would get
H you get also get the evil
P well probably as a
separate
here me trying to throw someone off

how how much ACC company you going the
wrong way this that's how you do

of the game but it is no
sweat what un hit one well screw you
