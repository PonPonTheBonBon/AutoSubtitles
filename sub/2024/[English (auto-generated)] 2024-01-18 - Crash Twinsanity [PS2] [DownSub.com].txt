so I I forgot
to I'm All unprepared
now there we go so hello
hello hello
hello
so for
girl
so yes so
so let's see where was
I yeah so so people wanted me to when I
wanted to myself well to finish this
game to 100%
so
to and let's see
where I need
to you need you basically have to work
between the levels unless unless there
is
some levels like I have not been able to
find I tried pressing every
button what
sa so so I've cleared this first area so
this this second
one did I yeah wait
where's wait where's the first
level yeah I'm starting starting off
well
here so I
see one of
these oh it's a
shortcut okay okay but no I need to find
the first level anyway
so
so H wait I'm so confused at the moment
no is this this isn't the starting area
this is the how do I get back to the
starting
area they should remake this game and
have Coke okay yes that would that would
be nice H
that I
would I would like that but this is the
last
area that you end
up before you leave this
side
and here's the
uh yeah this is this cut scene which I
can't SK because oh crash the farmer
market is tomorrow and my w trees won't
grow for my Orchard is R this is the
last area this isn't where I want to
I'll give you this power
Crystal how do I get to the first level
what you expect this isn't a
game
so that's my current
Mission find my way
back oh secret
life don't even work it properly oh c
just killed that guy you didn't see that
wait when that that was a while ago so
this is still c as in
Island yeah it is like the if I can't
get go go back to the first level I
can't even 100% came in the first place
that me to restart the whole
game ibly having to 100% this level
would still require me
to replay the whole
anyway
Bic which was the idea
whoops
yeah this still C I thought that was
going to change when I find the next
location I was probably busy yeah I was
probably trying to put on my leg armor
oh yeah that's that's what he
did and did I think why is there no
music in this area this
quiet yeah I'm not sure what where does
this a lot I hope
the Notions not
loud and this
is okay does it change now I can't pause
there we go this is the
last
this is this
level still not the first
level you have to help me crash you
heard them they want to destroy our
Island Home humiliate and enslave you
and steal my bra I should watch then
take a
shower oh the Beast yes this is the one
with the be the noble Bo The Humble
Bumblebee
a be humble
bumblebee that's not how physics
works okay so this is not where I wanted
to
be so and I can't go back but I don't
want to do this
level so
um
yeah as far
as so the idea
about but yeah I just finished eating
breakfast a few minutes ago okay okay
no
so I thought you
usually
oh started from here again okay um I
guess I guess I won't be able to 100%
this game then I guess that's not
happening because there's no level
select there's
no I like I can't skip to a certain
level I can't I can't even replay the
first level so so when this didn't go as
planned oh but what what should I do
like this is the last level I'm not
supposed to do this level and I can't go
back cuz it's blocking my
way and I can't reload the same because
it has saved in this
location I'm stuck
here when sure I
guess that's missing three gems I sure I
could
finish is this a really long L you have
to help me
crash destroy our Island Home humiliate
and enslave you and steal my brain how I
could
FK in harmony the same time not being
able to actually
100%
a it doesn't feel as great I can't
properly 100%
it we
go should be a
CH wish I could move the
[Music]
camera
well I got squished by it but that was
fine
apparently oh wait here no wait a minute
may maybe the gems aren't in
order oops slightly too
early oh do I need
to you have to help you heard them they
want to destroy
my bra I eny the simp of the folk
technically
yeah living in harmony with Mother
Nature the noble The Humble bumblebee we
starting having to go through the whole
cut scene every
time the Hang to find a what through
just to find the how to get back to the
first
level
oh
nice
go
that and then I need to keep this down
for a bit longer
go next
[Music]
segment
wh
oops that was not the correct
way there's no secrets I know
well I'm I'm trying to explore
it as
well probably going to be too tricky to
find the remaining
stuff that's all I have to
do nice nice
crash is so
slow oh hurry no don't there we
go it's
already okay then go that
CR yeah yeah like when I started the new
file when I played the T us I could get
that single event I
couldn't activate the other
way one of the few events in that game
that you can't that you can
actually prevent yourself being able to
complete the
Dr
perfect oh
my still see
any secr because this is a like I can't
really explore this area due to the time
limit but I don't see any like places
for
thingss to
be
now camera is in the trees I don't see
anything
here oh
look speak without
anything yeah hopefully I can still
reach the first
level cuz you don't actually have you
don't have to do levels in order at
least so you
can what I wanted to do to
me strong haven't been able to find a
single gem so
far
boom
Oh that
guy yeah apparently
here that did
count we SL
this I want I want to use
it anytime now there you
go and now go go go
go
I
don't
oh I'm not doing
moment
oh the cut scene
apparently CU you're position you're
repositioned when the cut scene starts
and I was positioned outside the
platform
that's that's
fine you're makes a b of noise here
there we go finally that took I don't
don't know how many times I
died right I need to be here oops too
far yeah don't pay attention to the
falling
Tree
f oh come
on not sure how I can't see in the boat
but but I'm but I'm behind now okay now
the game is chating
see yeah yeah now I remember there's a
one gem I couldn't reach because I need
to throw those rocks over because now I
know now I'm better at doing
it
now now I might be able to get
that uh Jem
I because before the Rocks did respawn
after I sent need to be
watching then all a sudden they stopped
doing
that I couldn't
retry even after
dying so only said the only way to get
them back was but
dying I could only do that so many times
before I get the game
out
okay okay
I'm not supposed to be here maybe I S
too far to right but still think the
game was a bit too
picky
kind of hard to see when it's
looking probably have
proceeded less and less Hogs nothing
suspicious with that okay there's the
gem
ah there you
go okay the first time I did this I did
it
perfectly there we go
perfectly no
no
there we go when I'm stuck behind the
spear there we go now I need to redo
this nope so they do
respawn Dam
you one more
try
oops sometimes the Shadow shows up but
sometimes not no hello Jan
you like this you like this s
suit look the shadow does not show up on
the okay there we go I got the gem let's
see if who's buy here no
good
whoa I did it I got that
gem no six up
there I don't know if that or hi
hi yay I got the red
[Music]
gem but still means I got two more gems
somewhere not exactly sure where those
watch out oh you actually survived that
yeah I'm not going to go after those
there's nothing
here SEC secrets on the
boat cuz that's
like that's what I came
from oh yeah this is the
um
The
Fortress to the inside
box here there might be some I didn't P
explore this
area this is a clean even clean the
stove oh nice you're
doing much better than everyone else
see
you could clean
oh you could clean the dishes while you
taking a
shower now being
efficient maybe there aren't
[Music]
any
no no I didn't see
it
well
whoa because I didn't expl this area oh
hello
just stand on him he doesn't
mind there no gems in
here do do seem
like
H wait how how will it fa when I
recognize this song and I mean I
recognize his very version oh so I think
they
didn't oh there they are wait I see them
I see
them I see a blue I see a yellow I can
do
this go now I just need
to get to that
yellow
how am I supposed to get up
[Music]
there
oh someone's trying to attack
me d d just a
friendly no good thing I picked up that
mask otherwise I would been dead
there
okay I know what the final them is oh I
need to jump over here I
see you're going the wrong
way oh no they going both they going
back and forth now I see
okay okay
there's a video on YouTube that uses
this oh well I guess they're using this
I thought this remix was made for that
video but it's here in this game I'm
crying I guess it wasn't made for that
video what video was
it very very
delayed I need to wait for I thing I
take takes time for me to get up there
again I guess it opens up before it
closes
so
yeah it closes up the
corner
closes I just have to
wait
yeah I don't really need to wait forever
there we go all gems now I just need to
complete this
one
go I can get to a safe
Point much water I don't see
myself I'm follow me
no good seeing I got that
M
good whoa waa whoa whoa watch out you
can hurt someone with those SP
oops and I need take a shower but I'm
listening to this
song it sounds like you're going to hear
the song a bit Bo cuz I'm
bailing careful where
you poke with that spare you can press
someone
okay now Ball but CA no damage to anyon
I don't know with this
game okay there it
is
Boom run run
run
oh
I guess that makes it stay a bit bit
longer okay then I jump on this one
there we
go
goodbye the song is
[Music]
over wait this more
Stu I think
okay it's more of the song then now it's
changing
now
by oh there more of
them who almost fell down
there
oops it didn't mean to fall
down W almost did it
again there's that Gap there and there's
a landed perfectly in that Gap I'll be
back in a bit okay let me know when
you're
back and I'll see if I
can reach a save
point there we go W about a gap there
there's a
gap there's a gap we
go
think yeah I need to
leave weird
cap here we
go really leave slight gap between the
boxes there standing next to each
other there you go save
point
whoa I think I should be allowed to same
now but I
said I could
still
test by loading it again and see if it
kept it this game is a bit weird with
how to choose regarding saving works you
can save is you can save any time you
want but it actually doesn't save
it
that's that's a that's a good way of
dling
saves yes it did save
it but now I'm back here and I was
playing this
C oh crash the farmer's market is
tomorrow and my Wampa trees won't grow
for my Orchard is riddled with greedy
worms if you rid my land of these pests
I'll give you this power
Crystal
I'm an evil scientist what do you expect
this isn't a
game
no D how do I get back to the maybe
maybe I can get back if
I and be piring up with cortex has not
been a see you doing like later half of
the
game
s sish sish oh missed missed
again oh running out of
time one more even though I see three of
them this
way maybe I will be able to reach the
starting
[Music]
area why couldn't they start and end be
connected oh no this is the boss
battle oh
well let's go to the boss battle
then we can skip
that this was see
don't don't say this
is
[Music]
probably and changing my mind regarding
game don't subday
anyway I really need
to I'll
continue we we'll see how far I can get
with
the why why doesn't this work give it to
me
[Music]
don't be stuck at this boss forever cuz
I can't can't deal
damage yeah yeah I'm not sure what
[Music]
why I don't understand why it doesn't
work all of a
sudden the game is to
picky just doesn't
work just doesn't work I tried multiple
times now
[Music]
the going a rock is very
flexible W that was
close W that was close
[Applause]
yep still not
working that was how I sold defeated
boss last time now it doesn't work no
just doesn't
work anyone else saw me defeat this SP
last time and did this
thing
y this doesn't work
anymore yeah
[Music]
said very
strange oh it
works and and the way the he SP go down
by one after the full animation is
played not at
any then point during the whole
animation where you would consider
taking
damage
oh
ni
nope I guess it didn't work this time
right
[Music]
they go through the whole sequence
again this B
spell wouldn't take so long if it just
didn't fail more than to
die like a s
time yeah the game is
really testing my
patience
when
[Music]
[Music]
like
nope didn't
work it's like that final BS Bell where
you have to be
very picky with when you press the
button otherwise it doesn't
count that was another
[Music]
F basically manage to do it every third
time no you should you should be able to
do it
immediately I no idea what's going
on nope that was a AR SP
I don't even need to complete this boss
batt I just want to just wanted to
progress to the next area can we just
ignore this boss battle I let you leave
how about
thatz apparently I can't beat you anyway
I have no idea why it doesn't more wish
I could leave the area I'm not allowed
to why doesn't it work why can't I
defeat the Bon
boss I like it when games doesn't
like you must stand at a very specific
distance from the boss when you do the
attack then too far away okay now it
worked I thought I was to too far
away in that case I stood too far
before even though when you stand Too
Close you it's just so you can't reach
but if you stand a bit F away you can
reach so the game isn't really good
at
like giving HS to what you need to
change
I you need to be quite far
away see now it's that works each
time what
now now I need to start over guess the
game did
that oh
didn't he wasn't even attack he just
touched the
[Music]
opponent which is a see in Crash if you
touch just touch an opponent you take
damage which I'm comment on doesn't make
sense
I wish I only took damage when I oppon
did an
[Music]
attack okay
good oh no let
see no no I too too far
away ah all right's go through this SEC
sequence
again someone said don't lose your
sanity
going lose my sanity to this
m need to keep an
eye TR tail is going to be my
Nemesis hey F fun how is it going I am
well
I'm been stuck at this boss for a bit
now it should be a r it's this the first
boss it should be a r easy boss but the
game is very very picky with where I
need to stand to even hit with
attack let's stand somewhere here
yes but otherwise it's it's
fine going
well all this me is going to chase me oh
now they're disappearing okay just so my
go was 100% this game but I'm not even
sure how have to access to first
level all right yeah if you touch this
if you touch this boss now you die
I I have redo the whole B levelz that's
how this game
works this is just back here yeah this
is back here I do not know how to
access
the well this is
different this is a different area but
still and also if you jump from there
down there you die no because of fall
damage this game doesn't have any fall
damage it just it's a Kill Zone some
this game is
weird this game is so
weird
Run f
it
no got suuck at the come on just just
lift your leg up slightly higher as you
can get over
that was this is what had to tell
me well I'm only played two games by
travel T so I can't really judge them
too
much but so
far wa that was
weird
that was very
weird come on to my boat Forman I can't
take you to the other place but don't no
you can't not to the other place I want
to go
to
like yeah you have to jump over this
this
this is a silly this c yeah H
I'm there's a piece of land
there actually there a piece of water
missing it's not
a how
did are far away the pl
no I guess I'm stuck back here I can't
like sure I can't take the boat
but but you're not going to put me where
I
need apparently could stand
there you're not going to take me to the
first level anyway you're going to take
me
here okay so so there's three beaches
okay now here
yes there are three beaches you can
reach the beach that you end up at after
the after you finish the final the boss
of the world you have the second Beach
you walk past at some point in the game
which is this
beach you reach this
beach and halfway while playing through
the
levels and then there is the first Beach
which is the one I want to reach but I
have no idea how to access that
beach and if I can't access that beach I
cannot 100% this game I don't know how
to access that
Beach
oh
what's no wait oh there's a secret
[Music]
here I found a secret so we're going for
a personal best record hello we I I'm
not
sure just want to see who 100%
game but the game is
really the
oh there you go finally I reached the
first Beach
whoa that took more effort than I
expected okay so the first one I got all
gems on is
the is the second one
I so now I can reach the First Act first
level of the
game which
is well I've done everything there hello
chicken watch out these are
explosive it is I is you my duty is to
I've defeated the final boss you don't
have summon Me by breaking open these
crates call me Thrice and I shall Grant
you special
powers okay
like
having having tutorials is
fine having the
tutorials uh replay
after have tutor play even after you
completed the
game even though you watched
it I'm exactly sure what
going now it's exped I did
is
Play Come On follow me crash stay close
and do what I
do even though we completed the game
having you to us
play every time you
die
[Music]
and
and also having that you can't skip
tutorials didn't even hit
the it's easy all too
easy
it's easy look I'm not sure if you see
any of those enemies anywhere else in
the
game okay but my goal is
to it's not that's not even his outfit
for this
level um yes two
gems where I need to keep an eye out
oh I just want to walk over
there is that but didn't I pick up
that

[Music]
gems
who don't fight me I bite you
back and I see no gems
here also how does
the I see those light rays are supposed
to
be cuz the sun is shining
like I don't see any gems
here it's could be an interesting place
to jam I
guess there's a knife there
look at these
polygons okay but why are lives more
here than
gems like yeah it was quite the secret
but that was would be a perfect place to
hide a gem
but guess
not I must a w with
life no
CH I'm okay the spikes broke my
fall I couldn't even criticizing this AR
game again they couldn't even bother
putting spikes at the bottom you
mentioned spikes but don't know
spikes go the Quan of the
game the camera is locked so hey hey hey

really that's how we going to
be the
wall

height
if I just get this come on come
on no crawling it up hill is not working
CU that would give me the extra height I
need I don't see anything
else I'm doing this does not give me
extra height in this
game
I don't have anything large as stand
[Music]
on this that in case I can make
this
like this yes that work got that
[Music]
gem that's one gem I still have two gems

actually access the
gem
I should be able

[Music]
gy w why is this Stone so
slippery you can't stand on
[Music]
those just the
walls them
though let's was Twi to double
jump

jump stop
jumping a
lot really need to pay attention
to oh where did I come from
yeah they put the if they put the gem

[Music]
oh come on follow me crash stay close

easy okay whop bring this with
you new cortex
brand
bombs
there you go so much
easy

perfect now let's go up
here now I can go up here oh no there's
another one and there's another one
okay
um
um wait okay let's take
care one of them
first we would with this one whoo whoo
whoo
whoo how am I supposed to get to do that
one do I need to do that
one let's see how far I can yet without
doing that because I don't
know oh wait I think I know
how perfect perfect it just works out
perfectly worked
out
oh that was close to
failing then I would have to restart the
H okay I got another
Jame and last
one they didn't even hide it they just
Place placed it here if you were to
follow this and then you bounce on this
and oh that's one of the gems
and then
the next part is going to be freaky
part okay let's finish this and get to
the save
point bombs you want
it where am I going pleas stay here I'm
going let me pause
[Music]
you hey it's your my friend s come back
when you are still more
richer I think I know what that is
referring to
but I don't remember what what it sounds
like only a shield remains okay this our
last ption
be two
[Music]
it's true blondes do have more
fun some reason it's B on
that quite a long time maybe it's
because when
you interact with like when one of these
moves it takes the time before they move
back
they do move back if you can move it
like
that so maybe the reason why it stays on
that screen for so long is because they
it's waiting for it to move back instead
of just I don't forcing it to move
back
okay but I
talk craw under hazards broke my
fall yeah I think it's what it's showing
it someone tried to walk over that was
dangerous you should try to crawl under
it look it's
safe here we
go
hey hey hey yeah you I've been doing
this for 10 stinking years back and
forward back and forward and I'm sick of
it well I'm not going to do it no
more
what there we
go
and
oh
surprised to see me crash like the fleas
in your fur I keep coming back three
years I spent alone in the frozen
Antarctic wastes and I missed you and so
I've organized a little gathering like a
birthday party
I mean it is Travel St no who made the
SP friends are here her tale you are so
very popular Studio let's start handing
out the
presents you're only fighting like
cortex and anything you're not even
fighting all of the other ones I think
did you fight someone one of the other
ones
oh yeah right was supposed to that thing
back
back blma
blast what is that
feel this is from Tiny this is from
dingodile rero you shouldn't have pin
strip how thoughtful oh dear of the same
but don't worry I kep the
rece can I jump there one gift you can
return yes I will return this gift there
you
go how about
that oh no comment on
these
oh
yeah
oh
what yeah dodged it I don't think that
was supposed to
happen
I
mean logically he would Dodge it but I
don't think that's the

though this game can be
really frustrating
sometimes
like when you bounce on these you cannot
losing control

good maybe that's what he's screaming
out in pain because it doesn't do
it I got the
gem and that's what it count oh that's
what counts

extra one got left
behind or rather the other I guess
died that's the only one that actually
survived you get double
M what I do
want
these where did he go cortex
paining yes he
disappeared triple mask which
is not doing
much but in this game you can
actually again I was going say in this
game you can actually restart it but
apparently it can't
start it's a very short timer it Mak
makes you meable except for
explosions
and but it's short but it doesn't just
start it's kind of
terrible okay so I did see yeah there's
a gem over there let's see if I can get
to
it how do I get to that one maybe I can
get cortex pick it up oh yeah yeah yeah
I can get pick it up come
here we're going to you're going to pick
up a gem for minut and it's right there

you but you don't have to kill them I
mean you only need that make okay
there's one
lost crystal is
mine

three face
nice
well
cling where's the last
gem lost maybe it is in this tall cuz I
think checkpoint cuz I I think there was
a PA here I
missed let's let's let's be careful
now we don't want to miss this PA
again W wo wo W wo should may come on
pick it
up up there we
go having some extra knives sounds like
really oh you need you need a bit of
speed
okay can be bit careful that
point okay now we need
spe there we
go oh it wasn't here maybe there was
next segment
let's see if we can see the gem
already
nope I
see go fun pun taking risks as no I'm
not what are you talking
about I'm a risk
free
I'm no risky
bunny all right cortex I came over to
you you don't have to
go here we
go oh it works like this
nice that was a nice place to hide the
gem I guess
nope gu I
think yeah yeah yeah there was a gem
here but I did pick up I think I Pi it
up
no yeah I miss we missed one of the
crystals
okay let's not miss it this
time sure here we
go we
go no I missed it
oh
oh
tricky maybe that was really J okay
maybe it was this tunnel I
spawning
okay
[Music]
um come here
C
the crystal is there you
go we don't need
rest she's trying to
run okay
now let's activate
them I can pick pick it all up
okay I need to turn
[Music]
into
got lot of ex lives
now okay but really thought was a
tunnel where
I
oh fix so
Weir let's let's pick them up again
because I do need there we
go doesn't
explode come on activate it you stepped
on it like two times
now there you go giv my extra
life ensuring I have enough extra life
so I don't get a game over because that
would be very unfortunate CU then I have
to pick up the gems
again there we go that's what I wanted
to
do no
wait oh I missed a
gem
I can save that
but then I need to get back to that
level and I cannot go back to the level
unless I do oh this is the annoying part
of this
game see magic no I don't want to see
mag I don't think it will be a to get
like I think it would be a MAG you
like I'll
do the falling of ground
animation all do
you don't remember jumping up to get
you they're arguing about
something I clearly Mis remember the
order of sequence here
[Music]
wa it's similar to pulling around with
out of a hat but instead you grab the
tail
your rabit out
of okay it's you know what what do you
mean you probably want to see that is a
drawing I didn't want to
draw and as I said pon pon and devil
doing like
challing and
uh and maybe I should do
that yeah because cuz I actually don't
feel like 100% in this game
this could switch over to that how about
that how about how about doing some
drawing instead 91% is not
bad take a long way not short
way
yay do I have
like here
okay I could still go back to the game
whenever like
