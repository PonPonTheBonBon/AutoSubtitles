oh
swimsuit because I end the stream with
swimsuit there you go oh watch
way oh no that's that's that's not
nice I know was change which still the
same as
yesterday oh never changing
I should I need to change
it these 10 seconds you're
long let me let me switch swap it to
something new for today compar the same
as
yesterday I there was a farm level yes I
did Farm level H it was cows wearing
space helmets yes that's true and there
are cows that don't there
are cow sweet and cow s out is it no the
view is not correct let
me so there we go now the picture is
correct uh I'll call them space cows
well the game calls them space
Couts
yeah this sound as the thing is goes
quiet when it leaves the camera like
that that doesn't make any sense let's
talk to this
B There we
go hey Spyro the ripto have invaded our
Palace and sabotaged the machines
powering our
hourglass your electric breath would be
perfect for powering the machines no one
around here can get any sleep how do you
know I electric
breath okay there you go I have electric
breath
F okay I guess it works on those good
good good good good everything's going
well here H pon pon no don't enter to
dragon fly oh here it is just lying Ling
I have not answered any dragonfly as of
now so don't no worries
I think
this yeah how did they know SP learn
electric breath I maybe
says maybe know knows that spider can do
elect bre
somehow oh so if
you when it's doing that animation can't
charge
it and I guess
that's
I how this game
works very
byy and this was my favorite Spire game
when I was
King I like this one despite its
shortcomings I mean yeah
it's it could do with some Polish but I
mean it's not yeah Polish
translation so I remake with be
nice
anyway guess
it's an interesting
game
ah oh okay that didn't
work oh you supposed to go down here I
guess so just
so not the game's for the develop finish
it I mean I guess you could say
that but um yeah it's the
fault and and the way the the certain
effects don't play until you look at
them so if you destroy something and
look away then look at it you might see
the which has happened with some of the
vas I charge them too quickly and then I
had to look back at them and then they
explode no no no
um I play the ha's tail first I love the
game that's quite I I I really completed
that game before
so but is
quite quite a different
game and I will play The Bu I is the
sequel after this game that that would
be Shadow Legacy
oh this is eg sees in this game
apparently I guess they are dry fly THS
this
time look at this little frame rate
Running Animation I don't know if he
shows up
when appar n
was it's wor I
want yeah I remember know when I play
that on Xbox yeah yeah this game has
been this game is
a do an enemy
okay
enemy I know the large enemies here can
glitch well I hopefully they
don't
anything this game can
glitch so that's
surpr try to avoid any I'm not
intentionally trying to
game and I'm trying to walk by and and
also talk to
people they'll freeze and never attack
they they'll turn Face you but they
wanton okay I guess that's not too
harmful definitely not harmful if they
don't
attack
yeah kill an electrical storm
electricity must be short to start yes
is that overloading
the
electricity shooting lightning through a
lightning
cloud I never played Skylanders that's
yeah I haven't actually come to the
Skyland games to the SP franchise look
at these just stuck here and it has
a Darkness glow from it how does that
make
sense and
apparently no butterfly from that one
what is this thing if this isn't
father why when SP crashes into
everything that one contain a
butterfly weird
game
wait where isn't there supposed to be so
oh there you
are kept that
one there you
go Spyro now I can power up the swirly
everything's swirly I like is it just
where is the swirly is it behind you yes
it
is anyway uh so yeah I do want to play
Skylanders too problem with Skylanders
is that they have
figures but I might be able to simulate
the
figures by
like
using other things I mean like the pH
with
NFC but I might be able to just
find some way I mention it before
how it might might be an option to
just run some software on my phone plug
it in if I'm going to run like PS I
don't know which consolle Skylanders are
on but if you like a PS3 version I might
be able to plug in the phone by USB and
run some app on it that sends over the
signal to the
console pretending it's being the
platform it's of course not the full
experience but it's what I can do
without having to pick
extreme amount of
money and
FES it does fade away so when does the
Collision
stop basically where it stops appearing
is uh anyway outside of the crush team
racing spal demo wait cring racing SP
demo
I hear still was my first SP
game Let's
uh
yeah see is yeah some some I played this
SP game is the first game
and it's cool it's an it's a
game yeah no games are
probably a nice experience first game I
don't hear
tail but yeah I yeah I don't know hey
let's just buy everything here so what
does it
do um anyway I don't know what I was
talking
about playing a her first game it it
gives the first first impression of
spire am I supposed to go this way W not
that way definitely not that
way and switch to
Bubbles
any I'm losing my voice
now because the one under the Dre bow
has another
purpose oh if you say so wait what what
you talking about that sorry part is
falling yes probably Sly if the NFC read
you can easily make your own yeah that's
what they are most Mar right
NFC
um it's more about reading but
yeah wait where are you
going oh I I supposed to catch this one
this one and
I'm trying to keep up here I now i e way
have that rainbow oh
well I'll see what I can do oh this one
is
annoying H you should try playing The
Legend of spire new beginning of P okay
I played through every Legend of spy
game all three of them but I will
play the
come
on there we go SP die hey it's
Sab yep SP
died
perfect do I keep get do I keep
it anyway yes I play don't see but I'm
going to play them on Game Boy and D yes
as someone says that they're certainly
the same game as the console versions
but I doubt the Game Boy game the game
boy is not going to be the same as the
PlayStation 2 three version of the
game so what am I doing now let's
see anyway hey
pwn hello J you were here before there
we go I didn't Electrify all of them
that's what they
see you hecking cute I'm glad you think
so maybe I should I think was a door
over
here hey
s so many emotes so much head
py so small such a soft beanie why so
pretty thank you it really it means a
lot to me to say that's I have a pretty
voice when
yeah oh man but the story goes on with
the turn night and D Dragon I beat them
all yeah yes played all of
them I miss
that nice pattern oh no don't look at
the
pattern oh nice design no keep I
underwear Yep
this some like to redeem so I have it
for that reason but I don't have any
alerts for it being done so I don't
sometimes they completely miss
the and someone steals the clothes and I
don't real I see see I hold the longest
game play time record on the legend
sping begin is 93 hours and 25 I don't
think
that's that's like I I think you should
have I think the shortest time is what
you
need yeah there we go I
played I don't know how long I
play the There It Is Legend of
spiral I do technically I could still go
back to the games at 100% them but
because I like 100%
games but yeah which is what I like to
do with this game so I have to go back
to some previous
levels I'm just going to make sure I
have all the Abes first I know
that cuz I don't know what abilities are
for what things
so
yeah a little sneak
peek oh said it be
height I
swear p p
glasses so I'm now cleared up this area
can I go here see so
o f SP fly why can't we fly after doing
that he dress or
start
got remind medicate if to anyone who
needs
do do that yeah that's is a pink dress I
try to keep get a lot of p on screen but
I could move P up a bit
more if you want to see
more now sports for with a
skirt no SPID fly stupid
train de with it
is
no what this thing though
High rate yes that sounds
good don't
hydr oh one hydr
before okay H number
two and
Sh okay let me clear those so I know I
have done these
and the PO let
me oops hitting
everything generat are filling
up
sits I really wish I could put a cool
down per user and that's a thing people
have
requested then and that's
um yeah that I didn't want to do that
but okay and I wa oh I missed the mask
it that's basically so one us don't fill
up the whole SC
immediately but there's no cool down
producer sadly I I I guess I technically
can manually do that
because all it has to do is check which
US was and like they that oh you already
come on camera what are you doing or
what do and say that oh you already
redeemed this in the last 60 Seconds
you have to
wait
another 2
seconds yeah so you don't do that but
yeah the time timer is going to be short
into 5 minutes hey it's not even hitting
The
Hourglass a check again but I this one I
have good P
now I hope
need to stretch out our
beloved
so okay
technically here the thing
correctly I had McDonald's for dinner
last night oh what did you
get when I was traveling back to my
parents I had McDonald's on the way

points stupid
switch and
but welcome happy to see you here
everyone so how how did it go hello
everyone how are we how is the stream
how was your stream what did you
do I mean what you I mean you played
fortnite but like how was maybe the
question I was going
for you were playing
with
your I can't remember every one I I
remember
Jessica come on come here trying to
catch this it's going through the walls
that's not
very there you go
finally hey it's ice boy no surprise
what do you mean what are you
doing had to hunt the stream tell myself
oh
well I'm glad you managed to get
here I'm so it's not your
fault Burgers those burgers are so much
being a pom P jump up why jump
up so how many games did you win that's
your win
percentage considering how many
opponents you
have is doing a win percentage probably
isn't the best way of do was fun that's
great yeah you played it quite a
lot
f g and Jess car me to
some I think you are
so I mean
okay Grim scary yeah
that's is too good at
game if I play the game I need to play
the Queens then
so what do we have have to say here
these lightning clouds are electrifying
the pools oh can you use your super
flame breath to get rid of them I use
the portal to power up your flame breath
and get it to work I mean I could just
attack them normally too oh he want to
attack oh it because they are in the
middle
okay oh why didn't that
way attack it there we go finally are
you happy
now so did I get something great job
Spyro while you were taking care of the
clouds I found this flying thing stuck
in one of
them oh so in this game you actually
have to go back to and talk to them
again next machine I'm too scared of the
water you're scared of
everything
anyway
he K is the one who's good at MTH was to
make everyone else
look and well G you are quite
stylish you have
night and then you
do
refer refer to your cosplay but you
didn't do a cosplay today it's
been
so please want to
see yeah you
had those
um I play fortnite on Nintendo
switch you probably a much better play
than
me now let's let's have PE rocket versus
GR
hey what is the water
doing the work is being
made so
um
TR gave this one a proper chance is it
good you means this game
well good well no but it's still found
the
plane if I say like
that it has quite some
uh weirdness to
it there's like
a the water effect doesn't reach all the
way to the top of the screen
I guess that part is going to be outside
the screen when
you're actually using a standard
definition
thing I think the next time I cosplay
will be if I can get to 34
o if I had a cam I would cosplay
whenever I
feel and I I do want outfits I can like
press
up supposed to supposed to fly over
here I guess
so don't shoot
me this clouds goes through the
platform how is he scared of water he's
a bar he can swim appar maybe he still
thinks it's
electrified
the game was released unfinished
unfortunately yeah fair I'm most
familiar with one I like two and see but
when I owned this uh when it came out I
just couldn't figure out what do have
theart level it is a weird game it's
like it's like one home
World it can B can do more than
night B might not be the great one
here
yeah as as as mentioned
a remake of the game would be
interesting maybe this is why yeah it's
it has a lot of winess to
it and the way the sounds things don't
just fade in Fade Out they just make
sounds and not okay you're welcome I'm
not sure what the help with oh right the
and the hourglasses do I get something
there I no
okay no
reward we're doing all of
that a bit weird I thought the vision G
was well I'm going to collect all your
gems as
payment that you have lying around
everywhere there's a door here with a
very strong flashing light
remember M bang his always charges with
gem yeah then that's one back there were
supposed to be seven homor but it cut it
to
one but considering the number of levels
in this game how would they even fill up
the
seven I don't finding ways around
playing one around ping one backs in one
of the games in um where am I now
at least in some areas in Sp 3 why does
it colliding you at least don't need to
pay in many of the
situations we're supposed to go down
here yep what a weird level I don't like
that the gems aren't visible from a long
distance I think the gems were visible
better away on the
original on the PlayStation one I went
back to the start
now there CH here okay there they okay
something more a
gift to Red
M hey hi P I am now at home after all

Peak from Arian to Peak now fly SP

one must
have I
I'll take care of that
later oh they have different car mods or
two different cars I guess oh I can't
see anything there's too much clouds oh
there it
is there we go too much clouds
again so one left
and there are
these how are they
flying there you
go I hear you no I missed you there's
no I miss
K okay I missed two of them so I should
be able to see them here and there's one
and then the last one should come here
so there you
are there we go two and half seconds
left p c is
nice
so is really cute nice kind
very
generous
yeah now you too don't have to bother
about
hat way flying
levels
thank oh right I was supposed to while
they playing with it's sure are
confident they can hardly wait to get
started start
they start too far ahead like anyway so
don't forget you have to fly through all
of the green check when chasing
order why is order kept low the dreed TS
will lead it away as
usual it's starting to become a green
ring it doesn't affect like the previous
part of
the and
it's the usual uh Playstation 2
thing where they do a lot of
effects like we can do a lot of particle
attacks now let's do it
even it's kind of hard to see the ring
sometimes I wonder if there are
any oh missed that
one and do this it looks like the ring
appear as
green and then they turn
orange
and the red dots are like 3D objects it
looks like instead of just
pictures to the
images could be
wrong really looks
like 3D objects hard to
tell whoa w w spal no I touch the ring
come on that
counts
when I know a secret I'm always getting
spoiled in my family that's why I'm dis
spoiled
one
oh I hope you
have having a good
time
oh is I didn't I did not connect it
anyway so there
are I need it now anyway
because attacking like the one inside
this doesn't seem wa sometimes you move
far there are there's another one did
they just appear because I stoed
weren't there
before yeah the ring is
definitely where I supposed to appear on
the second laap or
something which I'm on
now I don't know how this game works
it's it's acting
weird
yeah wait maybe I did pick it up I'm
see yeah I did pick it up there's no
there's no effect for picking it up
there's no nothing just touch the thing
and then you can shoot
thing so might be able to Sho no at that
one did not
get what we had
ke can might see sh
sometimes okay I'm on the last lap I'm
still in third place this isn't
great okay that's the second
place I me I mean at least the original
game was a bit more L but the original
trilogy the
um yeah I think the original trilogy was
more lenient with the uh flying through
rings that you could touch the edge of
the ring and still have it
count where's the
music
oh there it
is okay fourth
place I just have to focus on getting
the stars
then
get out of my
way so second lap third
place let's see if I
can win this so it a bit weird that
there's no ring
here the distance between this
with the second and third is quite
far cuz I'm still in third place in thir
place there all
that and the lap is almost
over oh this the two
no I did LA did LA two of them what's
going on
here all of these are so slow I like two
of them
I'm still in third because that's how
life now finally that's was the one in
actual second position that's the one in
first
position okay let's pick this up
then oh it missed oh one a stupid
roet come on spider you're fast enough
flying
beds I can't lose a bunch of flying BS
can
I anyway yes
oh someone so you redeeming that while
I'm busy flying I
see
oh look a dragon
fly hey it's
gray it's blue
Sun okay no no wait I didn't want to do
it I pressed the wrong button
Sparks many
options give
up oh you found
Robin Robin Robin
gron
yes we have stuff to do
sparks Richard Grayson Robin okay but
this time gson was the first
name
okay now back that that was a bonus
level I was a bit tricked by
it
who not sure if I should continue this
way oh there's a gem there I guess I
should continue this
way
so and I reach that part what's there
anything up
here
this they not sure if I can get up onto
it but maybe I need to get up on it
now wait there's more stuff here
oh didn't I
do
I think I didn't do all the
things two points to
the
armor oh there's more stuff there okay
let
me oh this level is so
confusing no no I don't want to go yes
yeah I think now it does this
way and there there's a whole BOS behind
here now I can go
up and then I can fly back here so I can
activate that
thing
one with a
chipa
crisp there we go that should be the
last one I hope why do they call those
things swirly a swirly is when you dunk
someone's head in the toilet and
flashy
well fire is getting flushed by me
swir fire is getting T
down
is a completely separate area or
something that looks identical to the
other
area or
something
what I do find a lot of
gems can't I get stuck
again
no there's more gems here James
everywhere
okay still curious if there's something
up there but I'm not sure how I should
get up there
because I don't see how it would be
possible for me to get up on that
thing
I think I've been there i' been
everywhere
okay yeah I'm missing 16 gems I'm also
missing four leap of the
clock it is all bonus level enough
tell
Hy well time to find uh what I'm looking
for
this is this area but I
think sure take time to aim is good for
me
boom boom take point
please
so
why are you
back y now he done
dead I don't think there's anything else
for me to do
here I think I
am there extra life here take

rainbow no I really should have put
something
there thank you Spire for
jumping you take
like take like reignite the engine and
then
just maybe adjust some issues with it
and remake the levels of this
game take into consideration the
difference in s fires around jump and
everything and maybe adjust the distance
up some platforms or
something yeah
right yeah I'm still looking
so not
excited most excited content beings did
you have ads not that you can hear
anyway you have ass from

on so all of these activ now should I
just go talk find
person
they one of
the end of the level
somewhere I think I took the wrong
way think I don't think this is the way
to the end of the
level I guess I'm going forward through
11
then do not like how the level is
basically reset after going to one of
those bonus
Aras okay I need to check here to save
why why does the water do that what's
what's up with the water yeah for SP
remake don't have everything this ow
reset after you end enter our bonus
area or make the speedway separate
levels that would actually think how the
game works but I don't mind
it I had the idea of having
like and
taking I he's tail but instead of having
gems the
way an infinite amount of gems as they
have they actually place gems to be
picked up like in classic
spal
where those gems on the wall wait
what I didn't even see any
gems I mean I see I see a fairy another
gy come on this game why is my free
flight
P
wait okay this
is just get
sing come on up p p you can do
it
running on a
rainbow there you go that's what I want
to
do so much easy to take
out compared to
like season of ice season of
no oh I see it's white with blue stars
now now I
see that's the I
got mixed
up
also it's fnny t
no no not when pum is like
that
it we need the sport point for that but
someone has redeemed a bunch of winds
and
stands I wonder who that
was
still confused about the
missing
this nope nope
nope oh back here at least that one's
still
acting that means that the other one
should still be
acting his P play Oh disappointed
the swim time is still
on I was thinking about having
like showing which outfit has been
redeemed and is currently in que I don't
I'm not really sure how to show
that but my oh I pressed the button I
think you could even hear it the other
idea is that when you do
a
which I currently can't do with this set
up but I'm going to change how it's
having and it it tells you that it
confirms to which outfit has been
redeemed so you know that you want the
one requested and then it tells
you uh how long until it will show up
because every outfit will be 5 minutes
so take the current time left plus the
number of other outfits in Le time times
5 minutes and that's
the
time you have to
wait
easy add an Al Q command like the N yeah
I mean I can't do it because currently
because there's
nothing there's no no way to get
that we is a problem but that's just how
the program is
designed miss a CH
here oh we can't use yeah using
electricity on a plant is not killing it
okay fire fire I he
there actually actually I think I know
which character to talk to I think I
need to talk to the first character this
level last
so
yeah so but I would speak to last
character
anyway while I'm here
any while I'm while I'm reaching the end
of
level because I did not activate all of
the
things and yeah where going
here I didn't have all of the things
activated and for
that know don't
really I want to be
thorough here we
go hello I didn't mean to Electrify
you thanks for the help
Spyro oh here's a dag why didn't I get
hey it's
rip
K okay I do still miss the
10 but will see if I get the
uh gem pointer from Sparks can we also
have a command that shows how many
times that would require counter but I
guess that could
work number of times underwear has been
exposed of times P has
been must take I just magic of this sa
room will bestow upon you the power of
ice I'm hting on my
own how dare
I I think
you I did the hydrates before I don't
remember if I did hydrates but I once I
guess I did two hydrates I was
said okay I'm still confused by one of
the abilities
here wait one oh yeah yeah yeah one of
the abilities you have is fire it's not
a room but it's more like the wing power
up I never I never got what that
was anyway with this new
ability
that should go
here all
right all
right come on Sparks what's
now I take my have many times Sparks pay
attention
see that tutorial does not need to show
up if I only
the
ASAS which level should I do
first I guess I do this one cuz I can
see
it Professor Mouse I
it hey it's fluffy why will you name a
drink like
fluffy why is sp
walking what's going
onch oh your
mouse I was working on a fantastic new
experiment but I suddenly disappeared
from my laboratory if you find some more
of these dragon flies I bet their magic
could get this contraption working again
oh I
65 65 I got 44 you kind have to
do I think I'm been pretty thorough with
collecting and dragon fly 2 like 7999
10 so I kind of forced to do them in a
specific order and do get a lot of
dragon flies in a single
level what's going
here
let's go up
here and nice
reach oh come on Spar bu
now
press myone a challenge portal I know I
it's down there I didn't find it yet oh
yeah you'd think I'd remember that by
now yeah exactly okay so what's the
challenge this
time be
exactly look it looks pretty chilly up
here it's getting very bright and
me and
funky me some
gems ooh my shield is in San anonia now
ooh you know what that
means
oh
it's
Sandra what's popping like time hello
Rocket Man and I'm crashing towards I'm
playing spy as you can see the SP game
I've tried to play for a very long time
but was unable to get there yeah look
great job young dragon that should be
enough to get more balloon working hop
aboard
shoot far enough hey Spyro why what are
you doing
Spyro that is enough to get your balloon
working you didn't even tell me how much
I need or what your problem was or
anything okay I'll I'll go on your
balloon trip I don't know why
but you're getting close to where I was
in that game before I got stuck and then
my memory card corrupted and lost my
oh oh
the most fried Spy game have you tried
Spyro season of ice please play that on
stream and let me know when you start
playing I want you
to the way the camera get stuck in this
game I want you to complete season
advice
100% those unbalanced rip talks have
invaded our sacred Monastery of course
we practice Divine compassion so we
really can't get involved in anything
violent no no but you can talk to
someone else into doing it
right there you go now you
warm look there elephant from Spyro
3 I think they're called Ms but
elephants man well you have to do 100%
seise
so
yes before you before you call this
right by
game you see and you'll see a game
W
ice oh where did you come from here we
go hey it's Bon to S4 if you give me a
here then I might be able to 24 yes
that's a year are you able to do it now
ouch
ouch oh I see
bunnies
bunnies w w very sleeper eyes
here I want to look closer at the
bunnies that's the
bunnies remember the bunnies having a
panic attack
I got to get a good view of this
bunny there you go there buunny look at
those sick eyebrows
anyway
bubble
voice roast the bunnies yes I'm allowed
to roast the
bunnies
kind of flame the ice
sculpture maybe
I'm making it more solid I don't know if
that makes sense so I assume this door
will open
this
Weir wait is
the is it supposed to look like
that
the the W frame is
showing how
embarrassing oh no someone HS is showing
what are you doing Oran free Stam and
you can oh that works
too do I need a key to this I mean I can
use flame right I'm a
dragon
that I guess I can't pleas
flame wait what you mean wasn't mean you
were chatting so I assume it was but it
wasn't
here too so I
mean you would have done it if
you got got
it
someone blame steals
that I didn't mean you to fall down but
I guess that's one way to
die I'm enjoying a kid
bun A well-dressed kid
bun in
some
Stars yes SP Soft Star
very oh so I can't flame
you oh cut scene thing Spyro I know
you've heard that are scary monsters but
we peaceful which is why we live here in
this once peaceful realm the true
monsters are the ripto and they've taken
my kind and imprison them in the ice can
you save the five yeti with your flame
breath I mean I've have talk to J before
and they seem perfectly
fine so I wouldn't
consider yet used to be
monsters you get in first you get the
ice breast on an ice level as if the
opponent in an ice level shouldn't be
used to ice
already ice breast should be like a more
powerful attack in like a lava or
something but they not used to code
best way to die is in season of flame
having she a drop on you with her
butt
yes that's of
course whoa whoo wo take it
easy is that is that what we need to
animate can I stand on here
no oh you still frozen
yes let's
animate getting squished
by why you
can't iume I should go up here can I
charge it yeah
that
whoop I can charge it too
nice can charge everything
s that would make a flame around of this
game but
e but due to that very very very
stre and that was a nice animation going
on
me okay that's fine
now in doing enough flame round of this
game isn't exactly going to greetings
young dragon I believe the turret behind
you could be a very useful weapon for
you to use on your quest we use it for
our annual snowball War oh it's quite an
event although we are a nonviolent
people we do have our vices perhaps you
might want to Glide over there and try
it
out sow so not a snowball fight but a
snowball War okay interesting chint
one I mean in Swedish we do say snowball
of War
hey excuse me I was going to the
cannon but that's
because it
just of p in Swedish kind of can more of
a physical and hand to hand
battle at least when I
see brother Ry looks like ancient n they
will look like everyone looks like
ancient
n you're welcome I like the Cod but I
don't like it that
much well te isy
man okay
checkpoint cuz didn't mean I should
rather go this
way because this way looks to be a
looping there yet so I can just pick up
this stuff and then
continue oh no it's me probably heard
the D
up because this
way
Nigel what a polite ye they are polite
in
Sp Yeti are ye are very
un like in a hair tail I guess that's a
change they should make in a hair tail
change it
so and also want to remake this too
make I assume B going sh at some
point make B and bar you
and the same as they crash fresh is
fire hey it's Holly it's Holly
not to confused with
Miss must be a British
thing well you are British so you tell
me unless You' been lying to me this
whole
time Scot yeah Scottish is British you
know
like it's just more
precise Di
it can't be more it's a
European an
Earthly an organism
okay are you coming did you need you
need a break there rest a bit before you
could run the whole
way let
see
m i I guess ice is a bit Qui to work on
okay looks like you have a lot of
En oh I got squished in the air how does
that make
sense okay there we go you are now
free you are pretty calm for being
strong
see so do you have something for me I
want stuff help Spyro these flying rip
talks are a menace oh I think they are
guarding the yetis trapped within the
ice here can you use the turrets to help
free
them okay so you still need a bit more
help and then I hope I get a reward I
mean if I'm going to do all this work
okay I need I need
reward this this one has like a metal
armor does not count that that that's
fine flaming but this one with a shield
do not be using The Shield at all times
I cannot Flame
the game is so
inconsistent and the same sh with Spyro
3 where enemies with gold armor that's
not methal but enemies with silver
or steel armor that's that's
met heon children let's
go
oh it's making a noise when can I when
it said that now I have to clame can
shoot this
right
yeah how am I supposed to get to
those is there another C
somewhere okay that's another one
got to come to each those
this
good there we
go okay
so oh what do you want have
Sparks
what why do you tell me this
part why why is the game breaking the
room this is not how game is supposed to
break
I supposed because I need to go down
here anyway I'm supposed to talk to this
character who's going to Dragon
play Hey Man Nice Shot spiral those
flying ripto won't be bothering us again
what do you mean what are they doing oh
look it's p
now eh this time it
was and hydrate yes I did a quite
I I
guess there we
go this like sports Square no don't un F
so it will be like sports Square
for it would be nice with the uh when I
set up the other method which was clear
off the redeems for me what their FR
Quest ice cream which also means that if
they haven't been
completed I will therefore refund the
ones okay I fly
here why are they still making noise I
kill them all I can actually walk past
there okay good to know I
guess killed all the Bears why are they
making
noise
come on Sparks pick this up the range of
Sparks is so
short
no
h that was look like a pretty difficult
jum no SP what are you doing you need to
fly
forward
little L lowf they're making noise from
Beyond the cve that's
creepy there you go very creepy
jump
hello those tricky rip talks caught me
off guard Spyro many thanks for your
help hello cter your voice sounds very
similar to [ __ ]
very
interesting can I reach
that
maybe
no does it remember
that
yes I can FL like this
it's a good thing you came along when
you did
dragon can't even do like different
voices is it too much to ask
for yes pretty good that a fibring
dragon did decide to show
up
as you all have been frozen can I
there's some path down there but I guess
I'll find it
later
hello M
Fant so this is
the home portal because I got these
purle Crystal
things there you
go oh camera could go through the portal
the camera should go home while spider
stays in this
world hello Spyro I made this rocket for
a fireworks display but I can't seem to
light it please tell me can you use your
flame breath to light the fuse I can
understand being a bit hard to light it
in this weather these these must be from
Skyrim because they all sound alike yes
there you go how about this used to be a
ye
likey okay now I can go around that I
see I
see I see what's going on
this well I guess Sky would be another
like I I would play through the whole
UND SC series I would be fine with
that someone is or or I should just play
sky
maybe maybe the whole take too long I
don't know maybe it's
fun nice jump spider nice
jump I want to destroy the
ice why is so much
dirt why can't they open this
door anyway because I'm going to walk
back anyway I can make that Alter pass
and then I need the key is it the only
key in the whole
game you know the the
only in one bags appears was
before the only key oh know I've been
doing good progress do you have to say
something to
me Spyro I know you've heard that y a
scary monster you say exact same thing
couldn't even say something
name was it
no that was to do
that cameraman did not get paid
enough oh if you play Skyrim you need to
make a bunny mod for it and then you'll
need to play with three with the B mod
for SK no but yes um I have had the idea
of like modding sky and like changing
every race to a different like species
that would be a l of but you know just
adding ears and a tail something like
that not nothing
complicated but the problem is
that when I been playing SK as well as
other people it's basically mostly in
first person
here I could play in third person
but
but a lot of people play it in first
person oh there's the
key a pearl
key
okay Gary platforms I would not like to
work on these I mean they're quite far
upart I wouldn't be able to get across
them oh here's a bonus
lemon do I keep the key if I go in
here then I can make pon pon and
scream he said bun
again oh the Dragon the rip TOS have
invaded our land and are constructing
Tor factories to destroy the monastery
do you think you can destroy all the
ripto factories with the Spitfire plane
aren't you like a tiny baby dragon why
are you like destroy the ripto turret
factories I mean sure but you're like a
baby dragon you you don't seem like
the you don't see like the right one
to
oh
joy nothing stands in my
way
there we go
done great job Spyro here I found this
dragon fly in one of the factories why
don't you take it de decep the missing a
few words here Dragon F why don't you
take
it f when baby dragon is like older than
what I mean I guess you're
right rip Toops just keep for building
their
Factory to okay I take that does mean
that there's not the second round the
game could make it a bit
clear SP probably caus more destruction
than those factories it was a wasteland
who
cares
I guess so okay but that was peaceful
destruction exactly therefore it was
okay I get get to keep the
key um switch fire factories yes it was
only one
R like me remov P's outfit no that's not
a peaceful Act that's a very rude and
unconsidered act now
my
my little stars
are you one who what happened I feel
like an ice Lolly did those rip talks
put me on Ice he GS thank you
Spyro that's not at all what he
said the those STX freeze is is this
like the uh the uh the US translation of
um but British
English that that was so off from what
he actually
said
well now to see if I
can there should be another bonus level
in this
thing wait I mean where am I going what
there am I
going was the ice chest this way no I
don't think
so I don't maybe it
was no I can't charge you you way too
fast that's the term to
use I got one yet left some
way no fly okay it was
fine the in is down
somewhere where am I oh there it is yes
that was the right
way let's see if I can open
this Co what does it contain oh dragon
fly I assume we can read in
that no it wasn't a peaceful tank SP was
flying up flying you sho
thing
oh okay so this still has
Cs and it still has the original C with
the lead closed cuz you can jump through
this nicely done they did not change the
Collision when it
opened analyzing
CS still I need to find where the
last so
didn't mean to go there o so I didn't
mean to shot
here beard with a horn in the
back um are all flying things
supposedly rude no helicopters are
peaceful I
see but I wasn't playing helicopter
so but I wasn't flying a drone either
so
yeah I'm not w w w invisible
walls winning
but well let's not go that
way and did not intentionally put it
there also the big
eyes Liv a nice
nice this seems like a very appropriate
outfit for this
here pump got far it's
okay play surprising a lot of time in
this game I guess it's not surprising
but this game do this game got
consistency like
Tomy sometimes you can talk to an NPC to
have the item given to them other times
you have to actually pick the item in
your inventory
and where is the last because I rescued
that one down
there that one up there
there one in
there did I me someone here or something
no none of them are here okay
so be there we
go
also modify speaking of
moding di modify one of the up should
become SP
stress then I need to locate in and use
it we basically how to playing thir
person all the
time you can see
p where did tly did I go here
oh yeah that's what I was doing I fa
this jump that's
was
FL that's a good Dragon cheers

it so now I can go over to follow me and
now they open this door as a
shortcut and this time Sparks didn't say
hey you got this
firly dragon fly that I have for some
reason do the
fires being in my own
body and if SP really had to dry play

dialogue I could tell did was a more
difficult version so Sparks had to say
it how is it
Harding
um
okay difference I mean I failed there
but it wasn't because the sl's hard it
wasn't me
failing maybe oh he
come
let's see if it's different down

trash that happened

go you can't push those things off the
edge what
things very impressive slide work here I
found this dragonfly wandering around
down here that same
dialog
hey it's dancing but a different
Dr you can always come back to practice
the slide if you like we find it quite
calming after a hard day of
meditation would you like to try our
peaceful slide again so they basically
made one set of dialogue and then
decided to well let's have a second run
of this slide but then oh well we can't
have the boys actor who made the voice
do it but we have the person doing
Sparks Voice who could do like an extra
line of
dialog I don't
know game is
weird this thing pushing the ice blocks
back and
forth well I ran into it so I mean
clearly I
couldn't anyway I have uh
B to talk to
wait more gems
first then I need
to oh there
another a
surprise hey it's Shadow oh Shadow the
Firefly the the dragonfly still keeping
coming dragon
fly do I end up when I jump down here
just here I
guess
oh no it's the
start it's a very short Loop okay time
to talk to B
me and then I didn't have to like
backtrack to

actual
hello thank you Spyro the yeti will

what are you doing tonight so nice
little bu sa and out of
sa in and out of SAA with a nice of
nice with a nice
bu

too P Money time
again oh cut
scene with the uh sound effects being
after of course
bled where are they where are my
dragonflies excuse me oh short one sir
sir short one something went wrong with
your scepter I think the dragonflies
were scattered all over scattered
scattered something must have gone wrong
with myor the dragonflies must be
scatter all over the continent seen no
matter without their dragon flies the
dragons are
helpless well yeah I'm not sure what's
wrong with
the yeah I wonder why I don't like
it pleas REM remind me of my
sleeper ripped in this game is very
it's
very much like a
balloon yeah playst 2 had weird
band why did I respawn over
here why can't I just yeah oh we play
the cut scene
therefore you have to restart at the
very start of the N the music in this
game kind of reminds me and remind me of
worms the peaceful green worms which I
guess in another game I should
play cuz there is quite a story in that
game so that's an idea of for game to
play not every worms game actually have
anything to to play more than just a
random round against computer which
against see much too hey it's
Masa worms yes worms w o r m s
wor by Team
17 wait why doesn't where is sp oh
you're you died
that's what
happened we're going to e it
today
okay turn that
off
turn off the
fire we can start
fire oh
long does that make
sense I learn where all of the fires
are oh there's one there okay we go to
these two
last
and there's one there is there any
more okay so there's one more
somewhere hot bun starting fight I
didn't start fire I just told you I
didn't
start yeah this
one that's the one I missed I'm using
this
one have so H that you would just
instantly
combust it is probably better word than
instantly these
things they self combust not me I'm
combusting
them
come on I'm I'm trying to do a challenge
here stupid
King that was about doing the challenge
is not getting interrupted by other
things the consing was
interrupting
57 We Didn't Start the Fire clear have
to burn
start something something something
don't
know I do start fire St
beautiful um in the last day of
um I think it's the last day of
April 30 of April because if didn't know
that April had thir days
what is it dark and that is the
uh why is there a
here anyway you did did it wow you're
even shiftier than me that's enough
magic to make this car fly up and away H
aboard what are you calling yourself
Shifty I'm not sure about
that spy didn't follow
along I guess I'm playing this level
without
SP but yes the last day of April
that's when there is this large May
Fire and yeah beig big big
fire why is it look like spy is going to
a red light Street I've never been to
this level okay this is Red Light
District
the squished
Moon let's jump into the
sink
hello have turned our treasure into
monsters can you do anything to help
us can what do you expect of find at the
pwn Light
District you're further than I was
before my D dark corrupted oh
look come on
spice out rum that there are certain RI
TOS in this area who are to Dragon bre
I've heard they can be
defeated their own weapons try
deflecting their attacks with your wing
Shield but how am I supposed to use the
wing Shield you haven't told me that
yeah I don't know how to do Wing
Shield oh that's how you do Wing
Shield
okay look I love
white bus that have problem of closing
something Bing at times oh that actually
sounds kind of
interesting so you're going to that
district and then
seeing cute bunnies and
then what's
their closest
managing
so what am I supposed to
do just attack you no gu I
was oh there we
go
I hey observe no I did looked way and I
didn't even see it
both sh buttons yes and probably good
food good food that sounds
good H which want Swit is bre it's out
side it's actually L2 and R2 at the same
time for some reason
just that basket was about to run away
was too quick and then
fell serve just
like no would be kind of an interesting
place to go it's where the b car is
close just banishing for some reason I
mean it would be it would be kind of an
awkward situation if you talking to one
of them and
just
disaar
oh head
shot and S of of course being cute
slot have problem
CL
um it sounds kind of exciting I
guess oh I heard
something
I guess I guess I should be a drawing
from being in this B
night being a server caring a bunch of
food
and me being too busy
too Final Fantasy 12 has bunny girl one
joins your group and wears guess it's
like a leotard like a bunny seat
stripless black leotard and B which pum
has a as an outfit or the crash form
mod I'm
I'm
the and will also where is my
CH there it is and which also will be an
outfit for you
to then can type B
girl
bonard you're going to be a bunch of
Alias so we don't have to
run all right am I supposed to this too
close
he
slides oh there's another
one yep
one well yeah because I do want to let
get back to growing as
well why are you shooting that way can I
Ang
okay going it goes in the opposite
direction there we go hey it went
straight to the hand this is cheating
game is cheating again there you
go
right
and okay
so what is
this
anyway s
patient yep I have not seen one since
that single appearance
I guess the developer didn't like Mones
either have starting somewhere and then
never
again flood en
mov yes that would
be
B yes the animal in
sish
that noty word
for the
to who I didn't mean to fall down where
am
I okay well I guess I was supposed to
fall because I was supposed to PR in
here hello
you need to be so precise with
ay not too precise but kind
of
there we go tast the jam thing was
confused
the come
come hey it's
Jordan oh the baseball club known in
English as a b
yes that could be
go for
example so might call it baseball
TR I
guess next TR would be a a beat
wood constructed of wood
beat might not
be anyway these are the famous racing as
always there two chall here okay the
regular stop okay let's do time T time
attack I time take I remember GL
spal oh these rings are kind of spread
out I look nice
scene nice blue purple not so much pink
though but they red in the
icons so oh wait there was nothing to
come there so there was an opening
anyway let's take care of these
snakes in a
basket on top of some bases is
one
look at pixelated
Moon look uh
dradis drad Darian
camel although it does have two legs as
well which is kind of kind of
weird I don't remember them only having
two
Ls
oh now I miss another
one come
on this is a waste of
time what oh there's the flying I see
them oh there last
one and up flying things I saw them
somewhere wait oh there they are around
the
lighthouse I'm running out of
time I got
you okay I need to beat b oh the the uh
the icons are
B crazy
see they didn't seem to put a limit
faster
play having
some epilepsy
what so let's take care of the flying RS
first then
I wonder if it's better to go with them
not against them because that way I
might be able to get you same time
because they don't approach as
quickly as I'm approaching
them okay I'm not sure if I should take
the camels before
the and before the
is where is
it there is before the
snakes but I I'm doing it so but there's
the snakes
good but I do still have to over
here not good because okay this looks
like the first
one
surprise from
behind and hopefully it was the first
one otherwise I will be
sad oh yeah these are the two last one
good and that's a
success now the flying level good that
this she clear them re without using
play button only the second side game
but yes because it's not possible in the
first game for some
reason so impressed with your
F
try are those gen I don't
know course snakes D me yeah I guess
they didn't do anything wrong
just well it seems can't wait to get
started so let's go you have to okay
same T just replace S whatever you're
racing
against I missed the
first anyway one more
try sometimes it's it turns quickly
sometimes I haven't fully mastered
the
burning but I do
like the amount of
stars I miss the
star oh oh oh oh my [ __ ] is out of
picture
today
woo I hope you show some
pictures
everyone should join the Discord server
to
see the picture of the
shield I feel like quite a long
race oh here's the that was the first
one here it's not too long just fell
long
still missing
that probably have to Red the
race for
third the S actually had an
outro is still fing
out
and it actually works like a
loop did I L lap someone
again the slowest races in this game are
so slow you can lap them but still
haven't passed the second and
first are so much faster than
this
where's with that tunel there am I
supposed to take that tunel maybe I am
supposed to take that tunel remember try
that next experience yeah and then I sit
down here yeah I supposed to take
that that might help me Win race if I
just can remember
that
no
this
out my armor with it yeah why not quick
just close yes that sounds like a
good cute
idea
just distract
them actually touch the
star okay there's the tunel so what I
have to do is take this ring and then
make a sharp
turn and then fly through the
tone like
that how about that teport please don't
stting the
second which is
Def but I
am further ahead because now I'm already
in start so it
did make
me it actually worked as a shortcut what
TR
say okay
so s
someone
yes you doing this game go go
go I'm flying as fast as I can I on a s
lap now and I guess those two are the
two
that I ignore the missile because they
seem to not
work they don't seem to
be seeking in a targets oh okay one of
those I left the other one was actually
in the second place
where is the first place
then it must be that one
then who's yeah I guess it was who's
flying I don't know where around the oh
wait oh there's a
secret so there's
oh that was just
cheating
oh I cheated
yes cheating
bastard
yeah turn
F that's watch out P
far I guess I have to go around the I so
there was going to be set going around
the
um the lighthouse
then oh there it
is okay
oh yeah learning Swedish watch the
Swedish CH for Lighthouse is we
what exactly comes from and stuff I
don't know I mean light is very OB house
house with light like every house is a
house that sends out light
intentionally it's probably more what it
means okay it's around the height it's
basically at the height of
that so second place starting the third
level yeah this is going and I guess
that one's zooming away over there
iing so I'll try to yeah one I
left yeah the leader is also playing
this SP W GL the see with a with the
arch let me
win and this time I'll take that one two
three gu language wait what did I
sayen especially with the flying
poet
they were really impressed that they
asked me to give you this dragon
fly hey it's
Neo it's Neo
cortex and no challenge I think I'm done
here the go well
have a theves then to go
through
I am sorry Sparks we have two stuff to
do
so let's
see come
on quite a long loading there we
go oh yeah I
think this platform
take a break [ __ ]
yeah okay does this to jump first oh
gotve to the
side oh okay camera didn't to help me
there but he worked
out
so trumpet but it's the wrong way around
I know this as far as I know currently
no way turning
down
ouch
sadly May if you you any kind of
rotation it maybe possible if I do
like allow you
to I hope the picture is large I mean
it's still large right
and you should be able to F three emotes
now inane and have them all in full
size you should basically be able to
feed more em on a sing line before start
scaning
down I don't need
instructions and that sounds like yeah I
will my
English I don't need two
instructions are you making fun of
my sh yeah I should probably not e so
much I'm
getting these rooms are so large run
back and
forth back for oh sorry you're not evil
in this
game you know if I could swim i' dive
under that water and press the switch to
open that door up there
okay are you saying that unfortunately I
forgot my water wings again s maybe you
can do it again another word missing in
sub Dam I'm try watch out for the pool
cleaner it's
dangerous e dangerous
it's dangerous
what they also made T in the
subs is this thing I need to
press it was very slow I guess
so where the clean
in
Dam get the confusion where if its
should be with an abst or not and that
possessive its is without a aposto and I
I seen the confusion that because you
use aposto as with other words which is
possessive but the thing is it's is a
pronoun not just a
noun therefore you don't use an apost
just like if you write the word
his
you also don't use an
aposto or hers you also don't use
her that's the reason
why there you go gate this just a wooden
gate a bamboo gate I
guess ah grass gate and I could just
masch
it I gu spe game loic I'm not allowed to
this supposed to be light shining on the
thing but it makes it look like this is
sp we
instead how am I supposed to get out of
the
water oh over
here sp sp
sp
so no should be why are you making this
noise do you want to Chas you or
something
SP than you there slow dis
animation a very large blame there be
careful about it a two of the
me oh there just a key lying around here
a crystal
key I didn't even see
it should I there's lad here
should I jump onto the these
things don't know reach anyway
interesting well I guess I'm not allowed
to but I still see this okay was just an
extra
life
but there might be another
one C it okay okay
now
me some gem here
too and it was a typle should be no not
to
oh oh you have to take okay I don't need
no instructions
okay
and no it's just how I would phrase my
sentences I need to
instructions oh did it fall down
really
yeah H having to W up
again no what you me need tell me
again you see I need that
one this isn't the district as we
established that's somewhere
that's where one should be
working okay here where the door
Austin should o head
shot okay no want to see so that's where
I came from
yes
and there's
some swirly thing
here no I
don't no release me don't want to go up
yet I didn't I have a leing gem no
stop don't want to go up I have a leing
gem yet no why
seriously the hardest gem to be y
because of
this Vortex as it's supposed to there we
go
finally D it now we got now we can go
up James I like
James he need the
James let's
continue this is an upper path of the
SC like see I have to go to the lower
path let's continue
here I did fall
down get
that I got
the right there you
go hey it's Martin it's Martin
okay as if the gem just fell down okay
this seems to be ground down there I
proba have to go down there and pick up
the gem later on
then okay there
go where does this lead
nowhere
and I assume that one is what they end
up here the confusing
area oh my this continues here I
couldn't see it because the the draw
distance of the CH is so
short I sort of looped
around should bettering unlock to get up
here after cleaning out the L
area
whatever
okay someone started fires
here this one seem to be in the
fires other the fire down
there why don't see
any I know there over there
wait well whoa who what you what what
happened on the way back here and the
challenge is still
running chiny games fire is wasn't
me that looks like a
very guilty
bunny the expression of this bunny can
be applied to
anything oh come on
yes would be annoying if can not
reach oh there's a gem here oh it's a
live gem
ouch
go let's continue and Go Back come on
fly why why is
he the one thing that's the whole point
of the game is to be a platformer and
flying and he just can't to come and fly
some I'm on guilty of take B of few
times need
to
well like sometimes you just is pushed
to the side which you want going very
close to it but I like
it if you do want to wash Pon
con that's
fair but maybe not when it's in
use that seems like a bad moment to
take
it who and then way you can't start
flying up the B
ring she was eating burgers and got some
C I want some
berges when I I'm still waiting for the
uh my bank account to be registered
let's see how hopefully there's no issue
with me changing my name at the same
time I have some included that in the CU
I sent in a letter to open a bank
account
the have included the note that I am in
of Chang my
names so now
still waiting for the
confirmation it would be exciting when
it
happens and I will post the
confirmation on the server when it goes
soon I can't wait now finally officially
named
em legally named
em
okay they no back
here did they spawn off
there get
one like that that plane wasn't there
before was still some kind of
B didn't I look at this
before there you

it have good
stream yeah I'll probably I need to end
the stream soon anyway been 3 hours
almost no wait I didn't want to go here
where do I want to go
I don't know where I want to go I
middle it's probably not where I want to
be living
baskets just a
basket yay celebration okay now I'm back
here okay that might
help and Rocket Man Z one is sh team I
guess we'll
see I mean depends on who stream
too I do try to
vary it does depends on what he's
streaming as
well if he's streaming season of ice
then
definitely but I guess he's not doing
that
he's playing alen W when when that's
morning no but
um yeah was
seas are you going to attack
me I do have how many how many of these

area level kind
of
something
so got those gem CHS

into Dragon
play thanks for your help
Spyro yeah you're not going to give me a
dragon
play like still thanks me for like
taking out almost every one of them but
I did not take out all of them so so
therefore I'm not I'm not getting the
reward don't I get like 78 of a reward
cut off the tail of the team trying to
play maybe that's a bad
idea I see these enemies maybe they do
respond I don't know there should be one
more
somewhere
some
Mini
S maybe I can find the last one I could
just do a sa to and just continue
exactly before
IOU so I don't have to do like
