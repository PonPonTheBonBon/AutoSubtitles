W you look at this let's fix the picture
there we
go just promise to
not wait what if I
just yeah what is if I just kept it at
that because I think yeah did I change
the graphical setting so it's
basically here we
go now it should be like the full
picture uh M
can that is a lot of
rabbit there we go there we go go yes
that is good good good I hope you're
happy with
this is everything looking fine is
everyone here are ready Shall We Begin I
notice that this one is actually pixel
too large
and I will annoy me so now it's
fixed so anyway enough
delaying let me delay slightly more
because I never wrote down that you
actually got first today so I should
have done that during the
C anyway done I'm picking up the
controll now and I back at the game
right where I left it
off
fine let see fine
right wait I was here last wait a minute
this isn't where I left off hey
Spyro have invaded our Palace and
sabotage the machines powering our
hourglass I definitely did this level
right let me
quick I don't think it saved
my you're playing this this would be
the
anim
pcsx2 3% only I thought that was further
along I saw that was further along
because I definitely did the cloud level
I was running around the cloud level a
lot and then I did an ice
level yeah
yeah what didn't I do the cloud level no
this is
this wait I'm confused
now this is a sleep sleep
level this isn't the cloud
level this is the cloud level why am I
confused at the
moment yeah I need to power yeah Didn't
I do this level I'm pretty sure I did
this level I'm pretty sure I did this
level why does
it yeah I did I did
like oh I I was working with steep St
and
everything yeah here here is where I
left off
okay let's ignore what's happened before
this is where now let's start I'm not
sure why I didn't load this one I mean
sure sure I didn't press save game here
which I can do now but it should have
loaded this place when I started up the
game I thought you still had a few gems
to find oh yeah thief thief place he th
Place yeah I sure I still have like a
one gem left there but not all the
gems yeah I was trying to
find
one no I touched the
ground and
died wait do I have to start all over
from
here
okay okay I why is the ground so shaky
isn't me where is
it can I
just where am I looking
there oh now it should be
correct be
correct everything is correct
right
yeah
so I was looking for I
think what I was
look yes so some like
it's not running it the full
speed but I mean this game isn't that
great in the first
place is
that yeah I was going
for
bu I was going for
the wait now I can't look up and
down wait why does down reset the camera
position wait can't I look up and down
in this
game maybe maybe can't look up and down
in this
game look our dragonfly is sitting here
and waiting for
me so hard to hit them
ohian found the outfit Change
option it's cold outside today but I'm
nice and coming
bad better
fleshes it's a new design no wait
don't don't
don't
wait why did that happen I mean it was
water he can swim in water there he is
fell down through the
water what kind of water was that like
really low density water dense like the
density of air so SP can swim in
it kind of lags in this
direction probably because it tries to
render too much at the same time really
feels like I've cleared out the whole
world must have been a strong
undertoe or was there like a secret
waterfall I didn't see or something
I just went out into the water and fell
down like it was
air eror would they make a mistake with
this
game would this game contain
mistakes
isn't this game
Flawless yeah I think I'm still looking
for like yeah one of those big magicians
I had to reflect back
the magic
onto where's
the sometimes he just don't fly come on
this game being bugging
nonsense
oops
nonsense okay I think I know where a few
more gems are so I'll go I have to go
back and pick them up and maybe the
magician is there
too why can't if exist another why can't
there exist there's my
grandmar why isn't there just
another I think I said exist because
yeah I would in
Swedish you would say
bar
wherefor exist there
not there we go that's pancy English
wherefore exist there not another
magician wait uh checkpoint that was the
word I was looking
completely
that's how we speak
Swedish really sounds like an EG Thief
there but I guess there's an egg Thief
but a CH Thief who's friendly V fin it
in he said
yes well when it comes to the word
checkpoint
that would that would be an interesting
thing so there there there there they
are well Spyro what are you doing tying
once
more that what you want to
do I've been here I just didn't pick up
those what are sparks didn't pick up
those
gems oh wait there's something
there wa
again with
the that
flying okay and then open
this cool
cool hey it's ret well I wasn't one who
caught racket what is the sound effects
why is the game sounding a maybe maybe I
have to restart the game or something
but I'm still missing one magician I'm
going die is that how you say
aren't I that's not correct I are am I I
am don't know I don't speak
English give me a heart attack is what
SP is doing yeah almost died oh no
that's a fake
gem
okay let's go back to back to the end of
the level and see if there's something
different this level kind of has a
creepy vibe to
it is this quite the
uh I really would like a remake of this
game I mean a lot of people
would like I said remake A Hero's tale
uh I mean enter the dragonfly a hero's
tale and Shadow Legacy and that's the
second tril spy ignited Trilogy
too I know some people have said that
they just don't want remix after remix
and that's true but if they're not going
to make an original SPID game the Remake
is the lead
SP okay now I'm back
here and and you get three roomes for a
price of one or something the Collis of
those swinging blades yeah they're off
by a lot and they're just pushing you
they're not really hurting
you in Air's taale you lost all momentum
got hurt and then fell straight down
which was likely going to lead your
death I think I might miss
remember and just Ed the same movement
ass
off
H Spyro regit Trilogy and just adjust
the
[Music]
slly going again yeah I
want move for to oh yeah I could look up
and down in Crash Towers look at this
water we can see spice reflection in it
uh it just ends
there
it just ends there is this is
this
what is this how it is in this
game nice there's some nice Graphics in
this
game yeah I wasn't supposed Where is the
exit should be some dude over
there probably holds some dragon fly for
me to pick
up cuz let's say
I'm taking care of all of The Magicians
in and I think there was one
remaining yeah and then I like move
around this thing and then exit
is why is the platform down
here
okay or is this
to L is so
confusing there's a s here so I can get
up with
again yeah here's
exit yeah what a weird level
this one what's with that one it's just
out out in the
open and here's the exit
area so did I clear out this area
then
maybe maybe here is where I'm missing
one at least I can walk back oh yeah
this is this room okay okay I think I'm
starting to put things
together and there was a
CH well good see I double checking is I
really hope there will be a Sparks
pointing picture cuz otherwise it will
be oh here's a gem okay let's talk to
this one
again there we go a very specific
angle thanks for your help
spal nothing
well uh
goodbye there were supposed to be like
seven HW instead only one how are you go
to seven like the first game
had a bunch six I
think AR and Beast
Keepers magic Crafters Beast makers
dream wavers and nor
Nexus
gorus
when last
one was
like three two levels one boss and the
uh bonus world you get
after unlocking
everything which I don't wouldn't really
count because it's a special World in
each game that's like separate from the
rest I
guess I guess I
guess so it basically had five worlds
and a few extra levels but it only had
three levels one boss and uh but it was
like a proper boss level though so I
guess you could still call it a level
four level and a flight
level fire two I'm do so many levels
like I think the six in the first world
then it's eight in the second world and
I don't know how many in the third
world okay one more TR I'm really
messing this
up in
h in Spire 3 it is four
Worlds the first one
contains
how much do contain it contains each
part contains three
levels uh pce speciic level I think I
did this one yeah i' been up
here character's not even
here guess it's mine now okay let's go
to the din
world I I did see it but I didn't point
out but I'm going to point out look at
this look at this this smoke which is
this might be a graphical issue I think
I think this smoke texture that is
really really tall
here is supposed to all face the player
cuz when it's facing play is nice but
when you can see it from the
S it looks weird light smoke texture
yeah I think it's intended to always
look at
SP could save and like restart a game
maybe it's acting we a
moment the tree that's
tree I would like to do some out of
bounds anyway let's go to the
mouse where
talking oh yeah SP
levels hooray hooray my Contra ising and
this character speci level it's like a
tutorial level it's not even a pro level
but I guess I can count it and there's a
flight level like four levels plus a
flight level isn't that the same as for
spy
one the levels are like kind of like
biger well this was an interesting
room I think I'm supposed to go into
that thing but what
we fin the world
[Music]
World D
World D
World what are you doing SP are you
afraid about what afraid
of come to say what are you afraid
of
camera a platform here F World platform
here too this wall looks very
suspicious like there's cracks in it and
you can kind of see through
it maybe that's the end of the level
hello Professor who has replaced the
other professor professor Mouse instead
of Professor mod Spyro the r100 and the
TX 1000 have escaped from their
Ines and are running through the jungle
please stop them before they destroy the
rest of the science LS in of our
research interesting calculator you got
there no problem but say what's R 1,000
something something oh well to put it in
simplified terms that even a dragon can
understand they're mechanically enhance
nanot proportion oriented ripts which uh
we've been working on here in our
quite theate of the
I
very the last part was andly would I go
destroying these
things when they were uh exposed to
subzero temperatures perhaps that
information will come in useful
later no problem I have just the right
breath to chill them
out on the other hand the T-Rex 1000 are
to I missed it okay
Clos time so well pick the swingit
then
wait but if if close didn't
exists sorry there's no option for that
that's not going to be H
shoting that that would be when I stream
on only
fans
the stone shrinks when they
die there you go that's more ow all
right I was going that one I was going
to use this
one yes freeze them down below
zero
here we go get your he
back
yeah and
dinosaur well they are what's this
metallic lizard living living
Mercury some is
snoring yes
I guess that will be in p p to some kind
of
prehistoric SP spin
spin I wonder what if
this whoa W SPID where is spinning this
isn't a hero's
Tale
hello oh way why do you drop the gem all
the way over there I charged
you this seems like a bit dangerous for
a miles to go
through no be dangerous for a dragon too
why does the Spyro hurt from fire hey
how did you get through here where are
you stuck here now did the did the floor
collapse and lava show up if it is
was a here you'd be playing as emper yes
that it's
true stilles three days they're
following us hey Spyro I've been
studying this Temple and it's quite
fascinating fres G oh yeah how so well I
believe that these strange drawings on
the walls are a clue to something hidden
away in this Temple but I can't quite
decipher them yet strange drawings a
calculator oh hidden
treasure yes and for what I have been
able to decipher it seems the statues
inside react to heat perhaps you can
figure out
the I mean saying that you're act to
heat or saying you can use your flame is
kind of the same thing you
know like it's not like a it's not
really a pule say
like the temperature it should be
at have wait what's the abilities again
electric yeah that's not the
temperature H flame which is warm freeze
which is cold and then there's like
bubble and then there's this which is
like used against a single enemy in a
single
level but
still not walk past it just walk fast
must it be smart
Spyro GS
everywhere all
right this game is going be
Weir here we
go
oo more
jams there also gems
here I want I want those gems so many
gemes
yeah so many gems
everywhere
and V oh
look wait there it
is
come
on why are you running
[Music]
away like too hard to capture them hey
it's
D DOA shiny sparkly jams okay switch
back oh
key a skeleton key that's clipping
through the packr of the
UI wait wasn't the chest out here let's
go back to
it probably have capture the dragon fly
inside
it as they
do
no wait why aren't you taking
damage I mean yeah that's the like
what yes here BS yes walk into the grass
can't see when you open it
cool
yep hey it's Shan Mark it's Shan mark F
DPA that's funny if you speak
Polish
TOA you say so I don't speak Polish
so is this game bug or
something
okay now now that that's
done I want to look ins side while I'm
running it's close in pronunciation to a
vulgar word oh no but as I said you can
use V I mean
like like not not to an excessive degree
but it's fine to like use vulgar words
sometimes and if you know my
why while I usually don't choose to use
vulgar
words if I'm just reading a comment it's
it's
fine especially if it's like an
explanation of something cuz it's it's
like not my words in that case it's the
difference if that makes
sense
ooh a wooden bridge across a
lava that seems a bit
[Music]
dangerous where's the gem there it
is
he quite a big an open space I think
this is inside the
volcano the
volcano that's yeah the
volcano
what part is
that another one of these
Bridges but who whoa is this a
gap okay there is an area
below but how do I get
back
oh this bird is
door is
excited like there's stuff down here but
how do I get back up
then I have to walk around there I oops
well cuz there's a bonus here I think I
mean it's not the exit is it
congratulations you left the
level maybe it was the
exit um the word is dupa which means ass
but it's considered more vard
than my culations indicate this volcano
is about to explode slide down to the
bottom before it's too late and don't
worry about me save
yourself slide down to the bottom before
it's too late okay SL down the
volcano you
are must be nice and warm on the feet
dragging them across this rough
terrain by slowly drowning to
wait what did he
say should have paid attention to the F
message iot
about I prob fail
again you kind of have to slide
here and then you can just ignore all of
that just slide
here watch is
lights whoa whoa
whoa a weirdly moving
Stone okay maybe maybe I won't bu again
then I shake back on Replay for the
message
whoa wait there was two
options this is quite a long
slide very very
long put two this blue lights where you
have to jump then it put two new blue
lights where you don't have to
jump yeah maybe I should the left side
it's to be easy just sinking almost made
it Spyro try sliding a little fter next
time I don't think faster is going to
help me you almost did it you fell into
the lava and died you almost did it well
do you want to try it again oh wait you
did yeah yeah the fail message did not
consider take into consider how you
failed can I kill that bird it's
annoying yeah that bird
was sure
[Music]
was annoying what's with the stone rock
Boulder
well
I get I
guess ir's feet are quite
hard let's see this
person not very different then I say
that up here
after this
section understand there here's like not
a jump don't this come here is a jump
and then there's not a jump okay at this
section I was going to try the left
side
well where the jumps aren as
frequent that was much easier
who
who this is not how B Bish are supposed
to move doesn't really matter
camera is
outside hey who are
you it how did you take get here found a
on my down how did you get
down hey
it's this is a dangerous slide you don't
say it's a Mario Party slide seems as if
the volcano has stabilized want to try
sliding down it
again I mean do I get something from
[Music]
that lava slide doesn't seem like I get
something from
it but I could slide
again again to be on the safe
side
and I'm not sure what they mean by
stabilize it looks very the
same he Mario Party you slide down
volcanoes that's a game I should play a
game series I guess Mario Party against
computers because that's basically what
I do placing
[Music]
I do know it's supposed to be like a
party game where we play with
humans
but
I play
alone
I'm lonely
rabit lonely
B I can't see I'm
lonely see that wasn't
hard see I did it without getting
hurt I get something the okay nothing
one okay come back
anytime and S my party games have
unlockable that could be considered 100%
comp
yeah I mean if there's no unlockables
I'll just try to complete the
game kind of like the main story if
there is
any
I was also considering if I were to play
like a game
like like sports games too just to play
through and see how the game evolves
that would kind of interesting if I like
play like FIFA I think the
default Hal
time is 4 minutes that means 8 minutes
per match but I guess isn't too long
and then doing like uh season that would
be like the main story I guess I'm
trying to win the season would be
annoying if I lose because in that case
I start over I don't have to like win
every match but I would have oh yet
there is the way to get
up what
is
move this look at this the movement the
as the walking
animation oh there we go found
it oh right this one behind too where it
was I wish I could recharge
it so much
easier go go go
go hey Sparks you didn't tell me what
what hey it's
you I you didn't tell me about the
challenge R and you didn't stop me when
I approached the gate like is this the
only gate in the whole game where Sparks
doesn't say
anything understand doesn't have say
every one of them but I think that's the
first and only one which is what I find
[Music]
interesting I can't I can't me
bir I should not going to make
that that where I'm going
whoa what's over
here just
lava H oh can I stand on the grass there
probably
not I think I went the wrong way I think
I went the wrong time I meant I think
I'm there
wa I thought this lava was further down
SP L really big as you died oh no Ken
she's going to demand to speak
to no it's not
nice wait the gate
disappeared but what if I want to do the
challenge I
can whoa whoa who spider why do you turn
left
I guess the game is not liking me taking
shortcuts
sing a t of a
second probably didn't even save any
time I mean obviously not for falling
down but cuz we're kind of moving away
from where I was
going okay
let's try
[Music]
to
yeah I think what I'm supposed to do is
to land on this
one it rise up and then I can just fly
across
or I might have been able to fly across
immediately too but I got
across those are very
shiny
hello goodbye
whoa where did that Jem go oh hello
Zoe goodbye
Zoe who that's a white
ice oh I'm supposed
to well then I do have to get rid of all
the enemies anyway if I want to 100% it
so so there not really changing
anything well I guess I'm continuing
cross going in
order ow you are
quick then we go here
then I'm starting to get options
here oh hello Professor
Mouse what might your name
be
oh dest my off with my equipment
equipment um hello oh um here Spyro see
I I don't suppose you could help me get
my equipment back could you well I guess
I can thanks
Spyro I wonder if SPID killing all these
dinosaur and Pa is going to affect the
person I mean
the the metal dinosaurs all I need you
to do is to get it back for me simple
oh that's all you want me to do uh and
how exactly do you want me to do that
there's a laa pit out there there's a
lot of out
there is that how you that that's
how yeah I guess the what for time was
up
now all you have to do
is and you be
a hi
hello short
talks short talks a lot spell spy is
also talking on the
silence that is
nice but the the way the convers is a
bit
awkward can I just charge you
no to freeze okay why is there Wing
ability why I haven't Spyro changed
appearance yeah
this can I still go back to it and
recharge it or do I have to wait for
timer to run out
okay because it's not a challenge you
can actually reset it
okay good
oh okay how about continue moving
Spyro you don't want to stand still on
lava trust
me when you're are a dragon but still
I arrive exactly as I wanted to on the
time it happened

top what so I did all that for nothing
Well SP it's not much but I found this
dragonfly hiding in my secret elevator
here you can have it a secret
dragonfly blame his

good bar

secret no wasn't
like well there are gems

side maybe that's the missing
well well it doesn't seem to be a
missing dragon fly here
sadly more
here oh well
oh my
g yes that's how you get across then can
I freeze these no
these move up with this
thing you

check pon pon passing up gems in a
spider cam
inconceivable I mean I didn't see them
and I did go back and pick them up
so oh it's frozen can actually free

the
oh it didn't right no I can't
be yeah I don't know where
the wait where did that c show
up whoa whoa
whoa oh it hasn't loaded level
anymore there something out all the way
over there
maybe I can see need drag play
now probably going to die if I
continue
Lev
the receivable oh inv
level
yeah the game is a bit
weird problem is there is many in danger
so can't really Traverse the level
without see didn't help me see
the missing Dragon FL
way but I still got one level left to
do
wait where would that level
be me Che
Canon oh maybe I didn't go through this
thing let
me water some sheep
yeah this was the seeps then I went
through
there and there's nothing else
here I need a
map come on
spal why can't you just oh look at this
tree oh it's
the view this
distancing made it look a bit
weird and up
here this is the ice
level I'm sure yes this is the ice level
so here I've done the two into only
levels as far as I
know there's no see
here
I think the Hun Mar level is near the
space C Level yeah oh yeah I skipped
that level
completely that's 11 I
know so going
back
yeah I want to see if I complete that
level do they give me some kind of
ability or do I have to struggle of
finding every single gem
myself that's going to be annoying you
talked to the guy before but didn't have
another Dr flies
yeah it was some alligator crocodile
[Music]
thing hello
d
Al
crocodile Croc
Gator
well
J Dingle no this is not dingo this isn't
dingo is
it
the L disappearing
in just like my
TR every time J got the chance to do
it no I this
time
straight well good thing is this just
doing this transition to the world
oh no oh no the transition is over oh no
I mean you said it I kind of
didn't I kind of I kind of my
fault where's my dress oh there
this whoops
oh
whoops was I meant to do
that wait they contain gems oh well in
that case I'll destroy
them I mean certainly they do want these
but n let's murder the
be swimming in Honey I don't think I can
swim in Honey I think it hurts
me yeah for some weird reason
not exactly sure
why doesn't seem like the material that
would hurt
touch let me get some honey careful
about it it might hurt by touching it
it's a pon pon hello Ultimate Fan
welcome it is a pon pon it's a pon pon
playing spy again finally playing this
game the last uncom complet
level but then I will play another Spy
game I but I play a bit of
it on my
own not on stream when I'm play a tiny
bit on it's on stream but
it ran so terribly it wasn't why do the
gems fly so high
sometimes okay if you like hit a wall or
something you apparently don't take
damage from
the water that could give some
interesting
results if you were to H for
example the clip out of bounds I mean
like
okay this is the one that hurts you that
out there is probably in insta kill
zone all right two against one yay I'm
an e
today oh did you get enough sleep did
you
have yeah uh I have to go I have to make
sure
to
where what are
they H I want to
do how about
flaming I wanted to do go to bed earlier
but I've been bad at doing
that it looks like I have to go and get
sparks
back
the controls aren't
great not great enough
to carefully pick your gems pneumonia
Asma is poopy and doesn't let me sleep
much oh that's
that's that does sound terrible
I
don't no
exactly what it is but it does
sound I understand why
you
right
wait what did I do to these I use flame
to make them stop moving like crazy that
Mak
sense whoa whoa whoa
Jem H yeah you melt the metal to seal it
or something ah yeah yeah okay but how
did this spin the heat must make it spin
or
something hoping I'll fall back asleep
what be maybe but we'll see I hope
so maybe you're tired enough to fall
asleep maybe maybe my silly game play
make you
sleep going to see the B of the level
over
there yeah if you definitely down here
seems
like it is not same same as that look a
honey for that's quite a waste of wa W
what happened that's quite a waste of
Honey to just let it pull over the edge
like
that
okay he doesn't sink he has die some of
me wa you want to talk
now welcome
honey
[Music]
okay yes we have work to do I tells you
what I'll make you a deal as sweet as
honey there are some honey Stills
draining all the honey from honey Mars
you help us get rid of them and any of
them there dragon flies you're going on
about that you find along way you can
keep just keep that to us
now okay so in the deal
of so the deal is basically okay
you the Spyro basically have to do the
work of H do the work for these uh proc
Gators and then if he finds any dragon
flies that the these characters don't
even even care about SP can keep them
even though SP could probably have taken
them anyway
without I'm even carrying in first place
but okay does seem like a fair
payment kind like how everyone in sp sp
Universe play Spyro like yeah I didn't
want this thing anyway or this thing has
caused me a lot of trouble you can have
it as payment
that doesn't sound like good
payment I guess that sheep did not
contain any
butterfly that's a
shame that was was a pain that wasn't a
sh nice
music
then season of ice have level where you
needed to COA bees into making honey to
fill honey
R uh
maybe I don't remember the
thingss maybe was something about making
the Beast angry or something and having
them chase you but have them land on the
flower or something but if you went too
far away from them they would stop
chasing you but if they got too close to
you they would hurt
you and the distance between where it
could hurt you and run away from you was
so small I guess it wasn't too
small but by run faster than them but
walk slower than
them but like right in between what the
correct speed if you just spammed the
bom as quickly as you could you can get
C the SP running spein
and this was a good
spin
okay well what's what's the matter with
you Spark
[Music]
actually C Thief that was what's going
on hey it's ducked look wait what you
calling a dragonfly duck and
weed dragonfly is not going to have
nice grow growing up
nice wi call Duck and
wind I did get to this level before my
did I was corrupted did you like this
level did you feel at home in this
level is
this Cowboy enough here yeah du we
definitely have meant
duck they definitely yes dark
we
welcome to Honey Mar's sticky swamp shot
us honey
fol with our tank away a dragonly to
anyone who canot down tget
yes they sure love shooting stuff you
think I
feel great make to shoot all the tars
before your honeycom gets to the end of
the or you'll
lose yeah they like to shoot and blast
let's gool oh that's a that's a high
quality
Target but can I go over honey or
something I guess that's what they're
trying to tell me oh no you can't go
over honey you have to take the
though why Sho that's the shoot button I
forgot about the shoot button
was point blank with a
tank get with
me
take care of
these
go peaceful
tank yes oh here they
are
oh they shooting
back
no they actually hit
me I'm shooting so
quickly way too much to deal with let's
move
out move
[Music]
away and let's see what I can
wait oh yeah I was thinking why wouldn't
that
he he's still
hitting I try to shoot me all the way
from there yes they
are
what you'll have to try
harder okay did it take too long what
what
happened oh yeah there's a time when I
forgot about that
okay that that'll be fun I probably
wasted too
oh wasted too much
time okay let's keep a mov on
then
Whoa stop
it how whatever who cares about
you you're not important
the only thing that's
important is these low quality targets
and these
beans that for some reason can't shoot
why is it crashing into
knock well I miss that
b maybe there's more than 20 of
them how to shoot them when H
the the munition is explodes so
nothing
what one shot and it's
dead yeah I think I missed three of them
because what a strange level hey
n wait no nibling bunnies it's not nice
Chad can we nibble bunny my pet yeah
don't nipple
bunny that doesn't sound
nice yeah I think I took too much damage
St
waa
whoa whoa whoa way to
aggressing
oh and this decided to startop shooting
me there we
go oh it's tasting okay
get S bunny ears yes pretty bunny ears
those are very big and very
pable okay I have have
[Music]
to do down the
uh thaning
then I can you know that
one too
high we
go
W come
on
lost half the
health this shoots me they can't see me
if I can't see them they don't
exist here we
go
oh oh oh maybe what this do here
good can you shoot him okay I guess I'll
miss one and then I'll reach down and
like oh you didn't shoot all the
bees you have to start all the way
over he didn't shoot
it like it's not shooting them
I mean sometimes I'm bad at aiming but
still because they're not
shooting go I reached end can I go back
onto
it no can I
go
no oh so I have to basically not fail
that last
part this seem a bit
annoying
like considering the way
the really took
damage come
on thought I wasn't supposed to care
about that when I was only supposed to
care about
think here we
go
there we
go oh it
worked okay and then there's this
part as far as I know I can't control
the speed of this
[Music]
thing
there you go
perfect the speed they fall down with
just just few
frames there we
go not to shoot down
the
there you go I did
it we didn't get a B I would like a
BG can you buy me
a awesome shoo SP are you sure you at my
fif no definitely notations wi

here go
moving
down doing some electricity at the same
time
well cross a
beit

level too much to for
maybe the platform is a
bit
off like on the fall

Spyro there we go
now and there was a checkpoint there why

now and
smiling oh there it
is this is a
slide
T games and slide
games that's what they like when the SLS

dragonfly back but careful he's got a
stinger that whip my right into
shape okay this the be down the slide

be well
[Music]

Wi SP the be manage to get
away oh no spal you died but you the be
got
way play anyway
[Music]
so
who
[Music]
do I dly oh my that's an interesting
name I mean yeah because I assume most
characters in this world all it has have
to R so specifying that's a bit
weird so interesting name
indeed
whoop whoop it's a long long
slide never it just loes forever it's
prly generating the map oh look there
send
come
friend wait do I have to wait till the
beat arrive or
something what am I supposed to
do start G
here oh finally it ended
the be go away set him on fire couldn't
there's no
fire I reached the end but there was
nothing to do at the
end yeah I don't understand what point
[Music]
is the touch to be in the air or
something
whoops I am
[Music]
confused
very
confused yeah I don't see touching the
be during the counts do I have to do
something do I have to read a
specific
they and be the be gots to that spot
before
me I probably been P to slide
[Music]
down and jumping
over
I don't know what I'm supposed to do so
I'll just
[Music]
continue
we I did it jumped through the
loop oh it SS
again
like I can't talk to him should I pass
go through
here
no can't flame I can't
charge
jump
yeah I'm confused what am I supposed to
do almost forgot my star that would have
been embarrassing if you got
that and now I definitely C through
TB I'm confused I don't know what I'm
supposed to do this is going to be a
very hard
mission is this Mission broken or
something
well what happened to
that I don't know if I ever got you this
F is it even possible to 100% this
game like 100% rest of the game
but like there exit imag jumping across
here do a Mario Kart 64
skip all I I was supposed
to SL down the
ramp what about do hit
again
PP the
tree went straight into the
tree fire is
unscaved nothing think to time
is being scaved
it's is something I assume you don't
want to
be
there is your level if I
jump what should I stand
here and just wait for the
be
B takes so long to arrive something to
try if you want to know what I'd suggest
all car the
be oh look it didn't count thought I
think you're already doing
what what a weird me we can't even
complete it I have to look it up
online
SP dragon fly honey Marsh
slide on slide bug so Bas
play one because honey SL I can get to
the end but but the guy there just wants
talk to me no matter what I do the
triangle to talk from just want to pop
up about his head is it s
the PS2 version of game is the worst of
the two versions while conly choose
version to
play
well okay that's not an option I oh
don't play the PS2 version but how about
not go that who would have thought for
years after the original po have find
here find myself here with the same
problem me right now at the B
[Music]
what okay so there is actually uh it's
the same issue with um you have to talk
to the person at the bottom it's just
that you have to be very specific with
where you stand isn't that
great
and there's no Auto Zone Auto Zone
sounds like
that that triggers
automatically like for other
npes and this very very specific area
the have stand few games like
that oh this just yes you have to
reach guy the bottom first okay this
time I'm going to slide
down but let's eat
anything I know you kind of lose speed
and for no
reason game just to be
wonky this will be the tutorial for
anyone looking
to win this
level why is the SP game giving me so
much
trouble specifically this game and I
hear tail had like this PO s thing that
was really really hard to just get
right
okay the point to talk should be
somewhere it doesn't show
up well I'm just smashing a triangle
button until something happens itum it
wasn't the well I guess the trigger
isn't
here go
here no there's no trigger
I can't jump I can't do anything else
this is not
reallyy well I guess this is impossible
to
do when I didn't mean to press
yes well I guess that one is impossible
to
get it's just a dragon fly what do you
need that
for well I will count it as collected
Bunny not understanding
anything P
nothing
congratulation you got your star I yeah
I really need to do that I want like
random
rewards they know
where work
seriously the only game is not that
picky as soon as you touch that wall you
lose or all the M all the ground is so
uneven you can't even jump yeah this a b
towards the unfinished state of the game
so unfinished you can't
even didn't even test the
game no
wait probably
didn't I mean at least if it's about
like if they didn't release
it and it was leaked online or something
in that case but oh well that's fair
enough it's an unfinished game they
actually did Rel it I'm pretending it
wasn't new testing game what's that yeah
it doesn't seem like they're actually
testing any of the
games except the original trilogy that
was well
tested where is the
seed I was supposed to pick up
seeds oh there they
are Ste has been
found I'm supposed
to do that
basically don't swallow it
spal no grav rocks and the rocks have
compared to like compared to to The
Beehive the texture that we have you can
basically see the pixels right
now you got you got like a dark dark
prick a dark spot there that's like one
pixel compared to the detail of this
Rock This Rock has very very high
quality
texture some reason
I wanted to get a closer look at that
rock CU it's yeah some
reason it's not very high maybe it's
about the
same just so much
small kind of
distracting can he need more than one
no count yes say
one
whoa wait how are
you boom that must hurt his
Mouse
boom okay one more is just that just a
counter counter does not go up to one
get up
spy no you
did counter does not say one you can't
even passing does not bring up the
camping as soon as you sped it out it's
a this is a binary
value that they put on
[Music]
screen here we go are you happy now
that should be only
be Rock has more detail than the ground
it's sitting on
here yes can we talk
now I don't believe it you did it thank
you for believing in
me now that you just release it
unfinished let people pay you to test it
for you then pass it once all the
negative complaints Pro five Fe
advertising for game okay so well you
don't even fix it in the first place
I bucks and you owe us one dragonfly I
sure up do here you
go hey it's
Lily so did I get everything except for
that
one
yes
and why is this little question marks I
know where it is I'm missing 26 gems but
I don't get like oh you've
finished my mission you finished all the
levels now here's your reward now you
Sparks to locate the remaining
gems May that's the see I get after
defeating RI or
something train
top I know that I mean at least that
level is not buggy and works perfectly
fine and is a perfectly fine
level we got beehive in the
honey is this a disc made out of
beim
game's not per working good that
that's that's frustrating now what are
you doing what is
this this is this is a punishment again
why why why why am I being
punished this is
in
great everyone look away it's only you
here so it's good no
punishment but is a punishment for
me I'm not
punished we just rewarding yourself oh
that's
same
just had honey on it I had to wash it
here clean oh is that how it works
okay
not okay well let's see what's happen if
I do go
here Sing Sing
6906 looks like I need 63 more gems I
can have 69
69 I get thing the dress is clean
now hello
orto oh we should have a
dialogue you're back again how is this
possible I will take care of you
permanently wait a minute I said that
last time I wouldn't want to sound like
a video game cliche let me try that
again this time I will take care of you
once and for
all
hocus
hocus yeah you don't want to come across
as video game character being like the
main antagonist of like four different
games that would be a that would be
bad that would be bad wouldn't
it am I supposed to use
flame only see
wait a
minute nice
effect okay that doesn't
work okay I kind of wasted one my
extra at least they still had humor here
well you can cool that team
work okay how are we supposed to avoid
that I mean I would use the roll ability
but it doesn't exist it's like one of
the rarely used but still good to
have hor B
spells
takes such time before he can
even I mean avoiding though is is really
hard without a roll
ability this this is this almost like
it's bad
[Music]
designed like the game is badly a sign
or
something oh it's such ti ti there's
something you haven't Str yet probably
not should I free
it
it's attacking so
quickly exy it should I bubble
it FL it I mean flaming does trigger
something where
start look it
works
excuse me he attacked me before the
battle
started yeah if this was a roll ability
this wouldn't be that hard look look how
sharp they
turn first I know you can't flame these
now and you can't use
this like the ability used against a
single opponent in single level which
would be useful here because I don't
have I already take
damage oh no that
hurt Wing Shield doesn't work
exactly are you supposed to avoid those
ones
what what I can do is like run to the
side but if I run to the side I don't
see when they
arve is this suppos B designed or
something and then the level had the
extra
H
but that only exist it once they don't
respond look look at how sharp it
turns like turned right
around wait where is
he how am I supposed to avoid that when
it turns so
sharply
I guess I can do
this is the way of doing it that look
like not having a
abilities sure the roll ability is
situational but just like the wing
Shield but it's still very nice to have
for those
situations I know people say that's they
bad music and I
agree
but for those moments that you need them
what a hits does it take what is this
Seas of
ice someone kept
track cuz I
haven't whoa where did that come
from
I wonder what you're supposed to do here
I mean it
seems
that arm is
reducing
what
oh that's not nice that was spun it
takes so long time to
recover that works if I TR to flank
him no
does not work
because those things turn way too
sharp
cuz it is
shrinking come on at least he did hit
him
but but I did get quite far before he h
me first time
what look at how it turns and also not
unable like there's no invisibility
frames after you get
controlled I I think there's even
negative
invisibility CU it seems like you you
get hurt before you get
control I can see of ice there Speedway
where you have
negative invisibility frame for uh
before you can shoot you can always move
it never prevents you from moving
but I
think yeah I think it figur
outo is this punishment for me being bad
at
game being punished for dying too
much and and the think and and the way
that you have a specific point when you
respawn and the level doesn't actually
reset his health goes back up to maximum
when you die but the level just
continues and you restart from the start
again I think I think uh
crash uh insane Trilogy has had an also
an issue with
restarting where they didn't make sure
that everything resets there probably a
few games with that isue least forget
that maybe oh come on how am I supposed
to avoid that again that
to you get hurt right in front of him
you're going to take two
Dam but whoever
coded this boss battle forget about the
whole maybe thing should reset look at
that what am I supposed to do it turns
so
sharply there was definitely three of
them
okay
okay it's very tiny
now that one yes yeah you cannot this
strategy does not work if you're
dead there are no visual cues there's
only audio q and where's the third one
there it is and yeah what go close
where's extra Health it doesn't exist
anymore I have used them up the level
hasn't
the level hasn't reset that's what I've
been
saying
is know this keep keep shooting where I
we
spawn oh I take damage as soon the level
starts because the pr are not removed
when you
respawn
so much like the game is terrible or
something who
wow and took two damage twice for some
reason kind of like very now it is does
not work as soon as I take damage it
doesn't work anymore or maybe it does
maybe I can be very very aggressive
before he starts firing okay it actually
seems to
work and
actually didn't think you
would iing that way I try to fight him
the proper
way oh
nice well at least it sh
is going to delete the b or
something do the level doesn't
setus okay phase two after doing phase
one for so
longus okay I guess we
go okay fire I need to use
eyes
okay well I guess I just need to
be
it's certainly
not that
me you should be
fighting you
purple TT
yeah yeah that
what yep that
again
hey the only two faces okay three faces
in the Spire two two faces in
a dragon
fly
credits here are the people you should
not hire
no it's probably this the Publisher's
fault it's not do not use this
publisher what what's the
developer
equinex probably nothing wrong with the
[Music]
developers there we
go
Equinox dig CH and check developer it's
Universal interactive so it's the same
developer as for the original trilogy it
kind of makes it weird because the
original trilogy was
SPI but then messed everything
up
okay missing every button the the
there's no button that makes Sparks
point at any
treasuries good
warp 94% complete that's
quite an
increase yeah no ending cut
scene oh yeah I warped to the dragon
realm there's a five missing somewhere
in whole level and I want the Sparks to
point at it but no there's no such
feature who knows maybe there's any of
the cred
St but terrible games does not to
deserve it doesn't sound doesn't feel
like it deserve it I need to find a
single purple gem which you can't even
see from a distance it's not like you
can look into distance see oh it
Sparkles over there the gem is be no
this game doesn't do
that it only Sparkles when the I them is
rendering which it only does if you're
not too far away from
it and yeah no ending there's no ending
pre-edit ending if there's a post ending
credit ending that you can't see unless
you let for cred play well I guess we
can see if
there's after 100% in the game which I
can't
do because there's one
on one dragon fire
compes because of
course what could where could even a
purple one
be and why there no sparks pointing they
add it inpire three
for if they could like oh there's
probably a purple gem here
I
mean I someone might have made like a
map every single gem someone did that
for SP one maybe maybe this game doesn't
serve
it no one's bothered doing it with this
whole
game I probably need
some
oh there it
is
good this this were this level is
complete wow one level complete out
of I don't know how
[Music]
many well let's go to the dragon fly

just a
a very revealing Beach outfit not it's
not at all like
underwe oh Del trust
me
beach SP took damage but did not uh we
did not
react
aha I need to save up character I'm
almost below 100,000 oh
no wouldn't that be
[Music]
awful
yes
well 100,000 is pretty good
amount that's a
pink yeah I think
I went yeah like finding the because
what I remember was that this was the
when I played it last time which was
like 100 years ago this was the worst
level to find all the gems
in I don't know why specifically this
one but this is the
one play too much Reed can't really do
the same emotions for
SPID yeah definitely looked around this
side
here I'd say this upper area is
definitely looked
through and this is my favorite level in
the game I mean it's has nicest eics and
like I guess music is nice and there's a
gem
and and things like that but it's the
gem finding
that specifically the gem
finding I'm missing yeah it's 900 gems
they really have crown that's why as I
said it feels like there's a lot of gems
in levels it is a lot of gems in levels
it's like twice the amount in like
previous SP
games especially Spire one that have
very little gems but the levels or
smaller H still still
a drum song one drum Song 2 on the Lo
wait didn't I do the mini
game I don't even remember how many
champs I
need
I the last two the two mini games or
last three in this case because there's
Min game there's two version of One Mini
game yeah I think I clear out
his wait what was the two mini games One
Mini game
is
one main game is the drums which is the
one I got the dragonflies
from oh
that's I need to come up with something
to
incorporate you
like oh there's a
gem oh that one contain a gem maybe he
the mini game is in
here there the Min game there okay
cannot be missing many gems
now how much am I missing
now one one a
readed oh secret C no appar
not missing I'm
one
just a little red
one that's a
flame yeah there's the mini game I'm not
done yet but let me make sure I've
cleared out this
area I guess I
here
yeah definitely not to done this mini
game maybe I should wait in a minute
before I did it no is just
typing shouldn't swimsuit be a good
outfit for this
level depends on what mini game is mini
game is
are oh Hunter hey Spyro I was out here
checking out my baby manay farm and
those stupid rip talks have scared them
all away let's race to see who can
capture more of them before time runs
out why capture the baby man Rays
capture the baby man Rays Alex what
it
oh
okay this is H Treasures of the
de this is very very very
tricky okay I'm not supposed to get that
one let's hunting can I C can I capture
hunting
wait the enough to capture that
one there you go wait Hunter is so
good soon as I capture one he C you
one
yeah I'm starting to get good at
this where he cleared out this
area oh well it tried to capture the
wrong one we go but you can clip through
them
what
okay being that up close to the thises
not help there we go that
helps
okaya all of them in time and they're
safe and sound I think there were more
than that but yeah sure I'll take it hey
it's kishna
muray chrishna
m want to try capturing them again
you're just going to release them all
right I'll see if I can calm them down
until you come back they seem to like
the way I
sing sure
Hunter maybe that's why they're crazy in
the first
place you want to go and capture them
again I can release them instead of the
Rhino okay I need to find the last Red
gem oh no he's going to kill them in his
voice is that
terrible it is 17 1659 but 17 very
soon the camera is inside the
portal so I should just see see now all
the enemies are back because that's how
this game
work I need to find the last one and
then get down from the
spir I wanted to explore this
platform or as to call it in spy Trilogy
platform I think like there are some
platforms in the arton home world where
the object's name is
plateform and something more
but but only a few of them and I don't
know what you're calling other because
I that's for I like to say because I
like the sound of
plateform plateform sound
nice look chicken no
wait this is I don't like this
level only because of the this R
gem not really the level I mean this
level
fa wa I guess I guess that's the that's
the way I could sum it up is a nice
level I don't mind the level I just
don't like 100% in the level
I
think what is sound like I heard
a
thing bacon pork shop saus sausage ham
anything but W chicken the W chicken was
completely
WR I ideas for can
me
aha find
it of course you didn't to
PE I wanted to make a word with where
animals like answer animals and pig
would be one of them and then someone
said but Pig calling someone a pig is an
insult I mean
it I mean if you have a world where pigs
are I
mean
yeah you could you could
consider
like
um how in or world where you could use
use that term for a certain group of
people as an insult you could do that
but that's really FR upon doing that so
in this world will obviously be the
same you you it would not be socially
acceptable to call someone a pink as an
insult I mean someone might do it but
yeah trying to feel the space at the
moment why is this one flying
I mean he a bird but they don't fly like
that you were roasting a PE tourist I'm
just listening a few things try no no
I'm not saying I'm not calling
you was was someone else I not been
talking to it quite a while cuz they
weren't so fond of me being friends so I
mean they were not hating or anything
the
was they wish I wasn't trans
so I me technically I
wish I wasn't trans either but they kind
of want me to go back to not being
trans isn't that
nice
because
yeah it's
the also kind of accepting myself too I
was kind
of was this was it was both
like and and also really
accepting cuz it is it is really hard
thing to
even this
like you can't really
describe there people are trying to Des
the
paintings
and yeah I have no idea when the red
chems
caning
so and I do have Sparks with you I'm
going to make sure I have Sparks because
I'm not going to run around levels
without Sparks and this walking p
there is a platform there but that's
that platform
right oh wait platform is
that let me go
there maybe the red Jem is on that does
feel like they should be more than just
a single reged G on that whole big
platform h
maybe they made a platform put one red
gem there I did had the funny idea of in
reignited change it so every single uh
level has only red gems but they're
still going to have the total number
like the total value of gems in the
level so I have to place a lot
of place a lot of more R
gems yeah this platform
we can get down to this and then we can
get up
here I there were things on
this and I picked them up or it was
empty all
alone
well terrible SPID
terrible
wa if I can't find a gem wonder why
sparks doesn't have a gem pointer
ability I mean he hasn't had that in
like which game has he actually had it
in he in spire three you unlock it as
one of the last SP Sparks abilities so
you have to defeat the final boss first
which is
fair and then you have to complete
the complete the Sparks level and then
you get
it
let me make
sure kill
everything let me make let me follow us
through this
PA cuz you could do do get gems for
activating
things I do have have check down
here I'm check down
here yeah anyway and then Inspire
Trilogy you have a gem point oh here it
is no I thought it was not
active thought it was oh I that that was
not act why why are they
disabled I want
to why is that gem
offset
ow
celebration oh yeah anyway reiz Trilogy
you had the gem pointing ability from
the very start it's three games in one
but it's like one game
depends on our count
um nice
collisions and then is there any other
spider game said this
shine any other SPID game with gem
pointing
ability obviously here's tail doesn't
even have gems the proper way so it
wouldn't have
one TR need to search up the gems I
don't think I've used it though so I
tend forg SP Point toward
gems uh I
mean I mean I let's if you like to
finding gems but like this gem seems to
be completely
gone
and I have to search it up what was this
called
again no don't close
it okay let's let's first look up Fire
Fly point to
gy uh how to make Spark points to
missing
gems now it's re I don't care about that
ENT dragon
fly ENT
dragonly he'll pwn you to the
locate is there poting
function oh yeah there is a pointing
feature I
well good thing I check
that point there it
is okay I guess you can
add this game to the list of games that
has the pointing
feature wait where
point this
way oh there is a jump point in this
game yeah
apparently and it's seems to
be on this
side what where do it there yeah like it
freezes in place if you move it's not
likeing wait where your spk you need to
be on screen so I can see where you're
pointing oh there it is thank you
spares Place North speed yeah I think
that's that was one of the things they
said they said in the the space cow
level and the the the completion music
is playing slower than any other level
for some
reason there we
go okay this will make it much easier
because now I have the pointing
ability so there's that
I could set up a custom uh butle layout
to make
it easier to activate as well but for
now this is
this did I save I don't know I the save
save save
successful and adventure
continues
tomorrow tomorrow
tomorrow
this is the schedule for now I am prepar
the schedule for next week because next
next uh tomorrow I will finish the
game I will restart the game and see if
I can redo that and I'll look up a video
to see also to see how a person does it
more exactly and I will see if I can get
that missing right play otherwise I
guess I maybe do some memory overwriting
Ed anyway I don't know if that
works uh of course in original sweet SP
games I recognized that I never seen
used to J pointing well the original two
SP games there is no G
pointing but is
it it's not I'm going to rely on it but
that gem was really hard to find for
some reason it was kind of in the open
some reason I couldn't find
it I don't know what it is but that
level
I I struggle finding the gems I don't
know
why I do not know why should we go visit
someone I haven't
visited in a
while we
have what
about he's swimming chilling and
chatting that's not his title his title
is do some swimming chill and
chat swimming chilling and Cy that's
it I was doing some swimming
Spyro it's been going for 47 minutes I
think this is good
time good time to wait where's
the wait where's
the there we
go which is AC
weird H yes
what let's go slash
oops I remember that season of flame
level you were looking for one found it
accidentally I just flew out from some
platform just dropped down and landed
right at it was a green gam
[Music]
crass yeah that game did not do you want
that test ra message I don't know what
all ra message will be
sadly I don't have
the
uh that's what I'm going to do
okay okay I have a better
idea how
about no he doesn't have a sadly it
doesn't have unlockable my emotes
do points that's perfectly fine up to
that's up to each streamer but it's fun
to be able to spend some friends to get
it I don't I don't think it's going to
substitute people I'm not going to I
don't think
that that um redeem is going to
De that's not you know word I'm looking
for people from
subscribing is int no no I don't even
know how to pronounce the
word we not going to attempt again rain
time and I hope everyone follows along
otherwise let me
know but
wa okay everything
