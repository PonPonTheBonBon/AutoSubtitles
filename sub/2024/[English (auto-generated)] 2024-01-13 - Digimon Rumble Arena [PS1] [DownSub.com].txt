loading you not remove M card or
anything else so the same data could be
corrupted okay autoloading da data da
load successful
capitalize right away oh no I I forgot
to change the sign same sign as
yesterday that's that's unacceptable is
it
Bai
anyway moving
on so as far as I
know
let's digim so I have every Digimon here
they just couldn't add one here in the
middle just just one more I don't know
random one maybe wait how many Digimon
where were there in the first
game
um
because I've unlocked every character
here gon
Arena nothing else
pictures uh there we go right
were
10 10 + four
bonus and this
is well seven 8 9
10
11 and then the four bonus and then this
is kind of maybe a 12 I mean can this
one evolve even so maybe this is also
bonus so like one extra regular one
extra bonus and then like three three
extra they more like recolors with like
these different attacks
there barely any additional characters
it's not like Smash Bros which double
the number of
characters wait there two days in a row
oh
no let me do a quick swap
here what should I go
with maybe maybe that the sign there we
go f forget
to yeah random is yeah you should just
added random I mean I still think there
way too little characters anyway um but
I guess I'll
just do
um and also have I unlocked every
single stage I think so I mean I don't
think this stay States if there's any
unlocked lock
and I have unlocked every KO mode KO
mode brawl type I think so I me it
doesn't say which I not unlocked yet
timed who wants to play timed game speed
o but isn't run on an
evolution run on is
uh wait what are you talking about
why is nothing working here I mean it is
running uh I know why it's not working
because stuck on head because because
the sportsware
is uh was redeemed before the timer
start oh this swimsuit was red before P
show up on screen
so and that they didn't go
through so now I know that if you try to
redeem it before P Pon is on screen it
will still like execute
it but oh I'm going to murder Pon it's
just not going to change the pon pon so
it still it still has the 15 minute
timer but nothing is going to change on
screen survive until the
end uh we
can change them what a power
test no I already figure out what it is
oh so even though she's wearing a dress
the timer is still preventing op yeah
because it's because all it does is when
you do the redem well like when it
executes the outfit change it that'ss
enables the picture for the outfit that
you have chosen and hides the dress and
then when timer's up it enables the
dress and then hides the outfit in that
order just to be sure
um and
[Music]
then so but because the uh outfit was
redeemed before pun punch out on screen
that first thing didn't
happen but it's still going to wait 15
minutes oh wait which difficulty is this
oh wait why are the controls
weird I pressed one one step to the side
I'm I'm probably pressing the wrong
buttons custom yes everything is the
same I'm pressing the wrong button
that's just it why is this T
blurry I'm
Miss oh yes thank you for saying
nothing okay back to the
game
nice wait
what I do
not know which difficulty this p ising
but not a hard
difficulty maybe I should increase the
difficulty I I didn't even have the
option because I because I didn't add it
well I guess I could add a CPU set to
random this is a nice
combo okay that wasn't that W oh I oh
got them on broken
NE no don't take take that oh thank
you oh yeah and
then B never using
these I need to push it why try trying
to attack just come
here there we go no push
down yeah this is probably medium
difficulty
that that is an opponent is completely
worthless at attacking me they like
oneon-one the completely like excellent
doing
this all
right just SL
but oh extra Light
extra you didn't even try to pick it up
you just stood next to
it
but yeah now the timer's up now I
actually the outfit change there go now
the outfit showing the chosen outfit
showing
oh I think you selected medium I don't
think I selected any
difficulty nice P got I strongr
for come
on I didn't even get enough warps to
evolve I think it's yeah this is like
power is this health me I don't know
like I can add a CPU to
random but then I can increase the CPU
skill which is five
steps
on Ara don't know which arena is best
like this one the trees kind of annoying
why is like no item settings this one is
most annoying one this is just too big
for a oneon-one this is too easy to fall
off this is not not much this is
probably F this one is way too big this
one has to command Bas everywhere except
for one platform which disappears at
different this is an not scroller this
has slipper platform but it's also a
really big
and this one the platform moves around
totically and like you can just throw
people off the
level I guess this
one let's see if I can do it on hardest
difficult oh no got one is packing one
yes that's what this game involves pun
has slapping the pot I mean
yeah knock ready Rumble I mean if the
computer
turns their butt against
me nice done there computer really
showing your
high CPU
level
oh ow stop stop that excellent
I want
to
uhhuh oh this spish

cheese let's use
Pon ready I'm
I'm I mean obviously not a boss like

characters wait how how oh you can do
seven at least three most seven that's
quite restrictive smash BR L from one to
99 it's
TW I don't know its combat performance
is very
unstable no I miss that one again I
still don't have Sun I need to add some
sun
effect chance
ofon
time Bo is kind of spam
okay that also kind of
spammable who what kind of mve is
this Zoom
like and also I did lose against despite
picking up extra
life it's kind of
bad me this is the hardest
difficulty okay I'm going to take a two
ex life this level because I
am no I'm going to spawn no
good come on you one hit oh
nice no don't spawn up
there it's the one place
is
where where's my oh maybe oh there it is
come on this
is where's my life oh it appeared when I
left the computer how of course of
course I don't even know yeah there's
that and then there's
that oh how long
how long can you stay in the air with
that
one it is a this one is a third
jump
nice so I
guess falling down and breaking your
neck this sound effect no no what I mean
the computer died too but what happened
there what could I why can't
what looks so
mad what's what's what's with angry
mouth yay
poon should I do two
rounds your dig
to like try
out different computers or something
should try I mean there's no other good
level like I could go this one but I'm
people going I'm just going to be called
out for
chasing
right Ed is going to call out I'm
playing as a yellow character I must
cheat
who who is the most knockout
B
character that wasn't the one I wanted
to
do that was again not the one I wanted
to do but I guess it worked my favor
anyway that's the one I wanted to
do
Pon a fire
type cuz I do not know the who I'll take
that I did not land if I couldn't do it
there we
go
oh I should probably not be
there
oh I'll take
that stop
that no no
no both fail at it but I got
it I think I failed that what why can't
you jump through the platform you can
attack through the platform and you can
drop through the platform but you cannot
jump through it ow no are you going to
pick it up yeah of course you are took
get while for you to pick it up though I
mean it was no hurry I would stand but
this is infinite match with only six
lives
everywh right
St oh oh poon is getting SL
yeah I I'm moving around and using using
the platforms to my advantage it
is it's an arena fighter isn't that the
point of
it is fighting
pass yeah I don't think the AI has pass
fight yep the had no path finding so I
mean I'm just standing here that's not
like cheesing is it I mean if your AI is
so terrible to just standing on a
platform leads to you
winning then the AI is terrible I'm not
cheesing the game I mean I could play a
different level
sure I didn't realize that how terrible
was on that
left
I just remember oh versus p no no I
don't want another
one cuz this not like the team if you
could do like two versus like if I do
this level no this one I this
one oh my God Pon has become Luigi wait
what
Luigi PMA wins by doing nothing
Ah that's for flame ons up
wait what's flame up attack I don't even
know a flame up attack I can't even
remember it do doing yeah I got it hi
hello
K ni I'm
not oh okay I'm I'm getting destroyed at
the
moment
I what's
wrong
ow I attacked that it just spawns where
I was can I
no
what I
guess are you coming okay you are
coming my attack you attack looks
quicker than
my I'm getting destroyed I'll take
that okay okay
goodbye where did you put it excellent
wait where did it
go
wait what happened
how I'm getting
destroyed slap the
but no
no ow too long range
grab
okay well what would I use that
[Music]
for I assume it's my health bar
not oh
cuz otherwise there's no point of
attacking each other if it's not my
health bar that I'm having at
moment yeah it is my heal bar it would
be weird
otherwise I guess that
worked
precisely sence says horse repair oh I
oh I didn't even realize
realize canot lie you other brothers
cany see with way and a r thing in your
face there was a boring character let's
move on I did he was going to do twice
for character but H this this look
good choose your Arena okay let's do
this
thing they repair broken horses yeah
when you break your
horse I didn't even realize I haven't
read the signs maybe I should read the
signs Mine Card
Crossing
Telegraph Mr hide the key Telegraph
danger
gos please
me there we go there's the horse
repair I think it's meant to be shoe
horse shoe
repair shoe horse repair I
reason but it might be a horse
p
no I'm not doing great
who nice nice could have done that
worse
just oh I guess we're going
down I don't like how this game uses
move
the stick back and forth to
recover is an very annoying
ow I'm got I'm getting destroyed
here head shot with a TNT
Barrel
finally actually
did
Super
Punch where you
going right over
you
this kind of keep forgetting
that no
no terrible I give V is terrible but I'm
terrible
to hey horse is very delicate having a
horse repair special is available it's
very
useful I
agreed more places should have horse
repair anyone know what it means to
being a horse I'm not sure if I want to
know this is probably going to be a
terrible Digimon to
it's not something you would want to do
yeah there's a lot of things I don't
want to
do oh
ter J has found the best redeem hello P
welcome now you're the first Panda here
you probably don't want to know okay
then I don't want to know well you
definitely don't want
okay oh that's a long distance I like
that do like
that I don't we just break through her
and Pi this
up wait that was the one I want to
do that didn't go his
plan ow ow ow don't don't don't don't
shove your rod on
me give your Rod to you
sound it had rod in the name
right can you stop floating around and
fight
me okay you're fighting
me
ow I had to do it don't recommend it
okay oh nice I I'll take I will take
advantage of
this and he
up can you stop M Maring
me I'm getting
destroyed and I don't like
it yeah
that like a very strong
attack get P Pon Button Mash it's button
now I'm trying to play correctly but I
mean with limitting amount of moves that
the very slow and sloppy moves and way
you can very easily the spam on as well
and this it's not a great fight I would
say but I
mean it's a lot of silly things that
happening
so maybe I should slow this SE by one
step choose your Arena like I feel
like okay let's do this but let's okay I
will not throw off the opponent of the
level then hint you need gloves that go
up your shoulders Oh you mean that thing
and
elbow oh so you know of
course and has done that himself no I
was a kid at the time the glows went off
to my
sh
is this a toxic
Digimon whoa whoa
whoa I guess that what's happening when
you're attacking each other at the same
time upper more
uppercut
okay might actually be good in this
game
excellent I'm not so bad at this gamees
I mean this
de
ow as far as I know I've completed the
game 100% so now he's fooling
around no I guess I play the because I
need to
prepare
yeah
oh that's for
me can I at least not this
is D wait I see
yeah no not
again was last was the one I want do why
you standing around oh I guess I guess
that benefited
you no
see why can't you grab the hedges in
this
game when I was I mean eight or 9 years
old and I might be exaggerating the glow
thing it went past my elbow though oh
the cheese level I bet I decided not
cheese but the computer tra cheese means
there I
me I'll be up K here thank you for
stopping by and being being
silly in a should I mean I can
cheese maybe I should be a boss boss and
cheese too bad you can't do like a team
because it would be fun to have like one
boss character versus three opponent
rookie that could be an interesting
challenge trying to
complete post
challenges
wait all I have home team
advant there you
go at least I knocked the opponent off
level I didn't like just
throw I did I did say I was going to
cheese there we
go okay you can't you can't do it anite
number of times
to well you probably can't do anything
just not spam
me standing on the HED standing oh
I'll take
those can ow slapped in the
face
goodbye
that's terrible stretch
textures I have also clean horse hes
that's better than beaning is that where
the horse beans
are you just scraped dirt off the Hooves
including underneath them well yeah
digim I guess I'll use this one just to
do the
trio not against the boss
come on some non boss random
character
ARA I
guess if you have like CS like that when
you pick random you
should should be able to choose which
character shows up
random random without
bosses
grenade Rock Crusher that was a slow
attack
no no the computer is trying to chase oh
then it didn't matter which way computer
was still over there I was just gone for
anyway no I
wasn't I wanted not that that
one nice
oh I did not have a thir
jump nice great starting
position I guess we
just
oh can digol
nice that's that's
the
how about
moving it's such a delay going from
doing
Jabs and also the when you get stunned
by
goon you supposed to get out of the stun
goodbye over
the computer quick at it but even to
react for when the computer is using it
ah I leave my part
no that's no
gift
that's could you me celebrates
celebrates my victory
or my aunt I was being her as a kid
asked her what she was doing after
explain he asked half far
in in acid G oh my so anyway
[Music]
how Victoria
obiously I'm not
sure I am not sure wait how would you
like if you select like a car like
this and then you add like a
random normal
character ARA and then you do do here
least you can pick one
point and then you put like this game
isn't available using boss special okay
okay I was
curious w 100
points I assume we can't pick this one I
yeah just
curious just
curious oh no what the farting bunny I
must try the
bunny the
[Music]
bunny knock battle ready
what can I do burp
fart
throw
heals of the banana
variate okay now you're
Excell I'm getting destroyed by an
invincible cat and Flames oh I can
should have had
that
perfect no come on what's
this I'm never going to be win this
[Music]
batt
well don't feel like
that much
me oh maybe it does increase
the number
of yeah it drops increase the number of
drops
off is I like
beans and it makes a toxic cloud
there that's not what I wanted to do
but I'll do this and then I prend
protect
myself okay I'll take this then if you
don't want it but apparently having the
flame seems to be more important
to this
is lightning strike
oh interesting oh this isn't
good release me there are lights
everywhere watch
out
such a weird
character no release me oh nice thank
you for giving me
that I have no idea I was about to
win banana for scale this is a version
of warrior yep
but it seems like this bunny it seems
like they've gone better than they have
done with
bario why
you I don't know how to feel about
this is this how they see
[Music]
bunnies T come
on can barely hear what you're
saying
my isn't this the hardest
boss that is the E
SP
oh oh yes this this seems good now let's
let's do the
reverse let's let's let's have the
computer defeat a
bossa
now now it's the computer turn to play
the S play
mode well looks like I CH level again
it's the boss level I have
to have a b
Cloud excellent oh yeah it's this
bossc which you
basically BOS just stands in a distance
and and spams the
attack Release
Me can more do that oh this one
it's liing above in the air
but I'm not even playing this that great
to be honest I'm doing a lot of stupid
decisions I'm just messing around and
this is the hardest computer I actually
did increase the
level yeah it's this
Ultra all
right
which I didn't even see the computer use
goodbye oops oh was a jump up Victorious
that was against the hardest computer
the hardest computer cannot win
against that player boss
character not even a single
knockout those blue ovals are like teach
on
blood good thing they didn't make them
red
and small
a she's is very high CP difficulty I
mean
yeah of course I did I didn't cheese
this time I mean unless you can't spam
but is
there I'm PR it doesn't have much
to did I man
to um high
scores did I fill out the high
scores p p p p p
p I need two more high scores then I
feel have to the whole list but how do
you even get a record how do you get a
high score in
multiplayer I guess I'm not been able to
get
90,000 okay
let's try to get the high score
then how should I get a high
score I know I take goton with high
power and then I add say Pon
pamon
and I don't know
[Music]
B
and
fishon
fishon and then I'll take this level
about
seven d they have a dig version of the
Pokedex or should I say
pocket pocket of course no what do you
mean this is not the time for
this I hope you like this
sign because it's going to disappear in
a few seconds
perfect time for
this is when pon pon needs be
really like the most sporty Sports
where we go come here yes come
here uh oh wo W you you're waa whoo whoo
no what I wanted to take care of
everyone super nice
if you're if you're planning on throwing
someone off the edge having them get
their neck broken on the edge before
they fall off the platform is a really
good way of make sure they're not
recovering this is maximum
T then we're going to get get no
right no no
no they confused you did it against me
how
theck all all of the things should fall
off the
[Music]
level we got the big bird
here
I wonder if it counts like they are KO
but does it count like
a player
KZ he stuned through the whole drop
there but there now it isn't St does it
still kind like as my
[Music]
kill that's what I'm curious
about
okay
ow come
here no why why why are you recovering
I'm trying to leave ow I kind of wa
between those two that wasn't a good
place to be why just looking at each
other this cat's
strong
spawn
kill the only part one
left no you're protected by the
platform come here come and fight like a
real
balloon I switch this level why are you
in the middle how long Okay can
go stupid PL slightly raised and just
jumps off the level I
wi
oh it wasn't so
interesting W this is
chaos delicious
cheese how
many four okay so it does wait four
so that that means of all of the ones I
did throw off more of those did
Count
reloading it's down there okay
so perhaps if I throw them off and they
do not
get they probably have
to
okay
let's see
[Music]
some something else
then AR and let's pick a Arena
that's yeah let's pick this
one
now so I basically have to kill them and
just not throw them
off
win that long that that long pause from
after reading everything and just
waiting for
nothing the awkward
silence
so I do have
uh I wonder if this list of users is
actually users who are here and lurking
or not now because it says there are
eight viewers in this list
contains
um
uh 20
people so probably
not they probably not like is
anyway
super no don't steal my
kills yes it take the
lead think W whoa whoa
whoa
oh and then I can do
this it's not really a damaging
move
sh probably have used a boss with a
damaging
move
so the probably not the best
oh all
right okay and then again can't jump
can't through through the platform
despite how far down does this yeah not
too far down this
I'm just going to do
[Music]
that oh I
died
oops
well no
more too big to fit between and die due
to
it
oh
really
wow that just
happened G can stand there does that
count this my
now or I actually survived
that too big to fit on this
level
oh
no don't
above
no oh you got an extra
life I guess that's useful cuz that
means that not didn't care for
me so maybe I should keep
the
[Music]
there we
go
speaking again I mean no that just
happened okay does this work now I
actually try to KO a lot of
them
five I assume that's Falls of the
opponent okay so this is kind of not
working
but only why does everyone oh it's is
the number of Falls I had left over
after the game ended that's what it
means I
see but still a very low match score KO
opponent wait so you you don't get
like it doesn't give a multiplayer
anything so
I that's it not
give or KO opponent that he only kill
once seral
killer so maybe just care a single
opponent and get, points and that's it
sure just happened yes had one just got
in the
way you know it
happens okay so my idea didn't even work
I don't even know how to get high
coin
well add have the scores and see if they
equal to setare I mean there was like
9,000 no maybe I should
have someone can do it but I didn't even
know
um when you press random it randomly put
you somewhere and you still have to
confir
it
they don't adap they are probably hidden
multiply yeah I wish in that case that
they were
showing I'm not sure if any
of cuz like winner it can only be one
winner okay actually getting a high
score and actually okay let's check
the DG de then which obviously isn't
taken from
Pokedex we got
agon oh stats just random
values that doesn't really mean
anything
like so this one says tail whip by
pressing down
attack but there is a down attack for
agamon as well and there's an up
attack General attack as well so I'm not
sure why this one is
included not included
here oh I didn't actually know there was
a actually special move like
that wrong
way
gu fire hurricane I assume that's the
ultra
there you can do like an
attack while grabbing on some of
them yeah yeah like elbow drop instead
of us do using a throw you can actually
do an attack that's interesting
but this seems to be character specific
I assume I don't think
every yeah this moves set is oh hey
L
kick and super
jump hot food not hot
food
and if oh we can check P yes jellyfish
Vibes with the cat birg oh what's flam
On's up attack I want to know what he's
actually saying okay okay
a noble heart what did you think he
said Monkey
Ball we have to wait for the all
characters to load and fade
in the way goon's eyes I just circles
that when Fad in you see the whole
sphere is actually hot spares and you
can see through the head
not
creepy is more this for some reason I
feel like it's most no for
goon I mean yeah it's not really showing
for gon but it is showing for
guman I know I guess I guess godon is
most this one
for some
reason
kman G you can check the names
here Noble heart yeah I was hearing
something entirely different not sure if
it says stream uh let's just say my mind
is far far lost in the I mean it is 18
plus here
so as long as it's
not slow I guess it's
very very curious Pon because it's a
palm this is like a Von well
okay wait this
is actually I think this are default
moves why is
this
[Music]
I don't know what find this
design like they added breasts to the
Digimon
anyway and highlighted them with leaves
I was thinking was saying double
heart
what's what's wrong with
that I mean if you can have
like this
probably oh
[Music]
c why SP so
angry
Kon Mega
Capon like the Japanese name remon flame
Ramon not so confused with
flameon Imperial
Dron wait
which you wanted to check B run I think
you said I can't skip past that very
quickly there go boom bubble on Thousand
Wings can kind of good
idea so Pon also has a attack dur grab
and that's what the computer did with
Inon of that time which seems to be a
very strong
attack
see there's nothing no no issue talking
about
that I assume the front side is the
silver part because the icon was very
white while the character is
black and purple for some
reason this is purple not black was a
very dark purple
look pink claws rocket butt that's B bug
Digimon rocket butt is you don't see his
bug rocket bug because he's a
bug let's take a
look shock jaw super shocker Rhino spin
Dynamo spin Beetle horn attack electro
shocker Electro star
shocking
touch horn Thruster horn Buster Repulsor
field ground circuit Rhino Char
lightning wave and Rocket butt I guess
there is a rocket
butt I guess I guess there's a rocket in
the
butt well the blue this very and
red
wait why is the square moving between
this what these like symbols put in a
green or
something gruesome
grab oh yeah that's the
grab can't
remember yeah don't stand stop after
rocket butt
tell Rocket Man about where is Rocket
Man system
failure sword of
[Music]
Ru
pandemonium r sun Mist oh yeah I didn't
know Shield
plus a b c d e
f
what that excident
is
oh oh is it oh is the joke is that he's
burping the
alphabet okay
uhoh
off is there more
guess now I had to check
that back to the bunny your digim
ready I wanted to quickly
select computer but it picked a random
boss instead I used be able to bur the
alphabet Way Way Back in
[Music]
M
well okay let's see what I can do with
the shield plus attack combination
piing up it was randomly
selected knockout battle survive until
the end to win ready
Rumble
o
interesting wow that that dealt a lot of
damage
no there
like we only need one
move who to win
everything oh it's quite range
too I'm not pecking on
Pon you can
also if you don't hit you can at least
see
see
have
oh I'll take that and I'll take that too
I don't need them but
what if I go up here do I
die oh someone broke the
ni probably go down and then do it here
oh this one was about to squeeze there
go one move nothing
else that's voice
upack yeah I think it's down
B
that it say five because I had five
Falls
left no sweat one hit one
day what a stupid
move but like so not everyone has
like can just be a random one so not
everyone has like a special mov it's
only the final
stage
that has
that
W is is won W Luigi because that's
that's where I've heard of w being
connected to I know both say
s w Luigi is such a weird
name it should
Bei okay
anyway no it's just
regular and no move
okay I need to find this throw
button and in that
case
[Music]
so hard
to
evolve have to scatter so
many so much Blue
Blood I'll take that thank
you stand up why is it so hard to stand
up
up this
game speaking of hard to pick
up now this is just IR
regular which for some
reason oh is it this one that generates
a lot of these blue ones
yes just see de oh that's
good okay so now this is the regular
one and then you can do
this
one where's
my I'm not going to be able to do oh
there we go I can do it
now just just as a quick powerful move
that just knocks the opponent away okay
you do stand that Char this [ __ ] up and
then hope the computer goes into it and
there we go and then you
win uh well I need to go to go store now
probably won't be back by the end of the
stream so I'll see you later enjoy the
rest of your day and taking
no no you're not allowed to do that I'll
have to take that back from you
I think it stays
here gu see I have many
in okay here you
go yes
good yeah I don't see feel like this
game has much more to offer anyway
so I think I exhausted everything
face and I don't feel like it's
yeah these are leaving too and I don't
feel
like is left too and I don't feel like
it's attract the same audience as the
other
games
so I'll
be this however okay
let's I've only been doing like one and
a half hours
but but
still I think it's
[Music]
fair
um bunny bunny bunny so let me do a
quick look I think there is like
[Music]
Digimon
another but Play 3 game in that case I
would have
[Music]
to maybe I can maybe I can see if I can
get my
three because there's a
game I can bring this up on
screen
[Music]
Maybe
down let me
just make sure
that oh there's I could I couldn't do
what I wanted to
[Music]
do
let's make sure
that to hide any
potential is this the original size
yeah I could probably make it large I
mean I can zoom
in that
works
and make it
wh maybe put
it
here there we
go I can't make the well where did my
mouse curs go if I could hide the top
bar I mean I guess I could technically
do that
but so
fresh this this one should be there we
go there digon all star
Rumble oh another g game yes it's Patman
there
um H doesn't look like it not on the box
art this
[Music]
Ron the Goon Bon
bonon
which some new Digimon Von and I can't
remember what the name is
man well
probably probably says here yes maybe I
shouldn't read the list of ton was the
name maybe I shouldn't list the the uh
digimons that are in it
so
yeah it's is a 2014 game and I could see
if I can make my P my my PS3 work and
then I could run this
game which was
362 and uh we'll see if it works for
some reason because if you go to
Digimon R Arena let's go the first
one it says a bunch of
text it says that a sequel was released
oh it actually says here okay a speci of
the two first okay it does this there
okay
fair yeah this do this I I didn't pay
attention or maybe I did look at it
quite a long time ago where it didn't
say that that it was
[Music]
added and I look at is before 2014
before it was
released looks fun I have no idea if it
look I mean you can't really determine
if it looks fine it looks fun because
it's there's nothing to look at honestly
looked up pictures on your own but I'm
I'm trying to not look up anything
because I wanted to go into it
blind which is also why I didn't read
the list of
Digimon I think that could be an
interesting thing to do
[Music]
so so we're currently on Saturday as far
as I know it's Saturday this is
1 thir 14 15 back to SP ENT play
continue that Adventure Haven looked at
that okay and
then yeah I will so crash so I would
probably not I don't know will I will I
be able to finish Enter the Dragon Fly

upcoming six 6
hours I
probably I probably should be able to do
that so maybe I should schedule the next
SP game which would be SP
Legacy for the next
week yeah I don't have any any more D
so let's
just
take
firewell and
see who to
