there we
[Music]
[Music]
go yeah group
Messengers yes I like group
[Music]
messages oh to right off um oh no I
forgot to change to the sign again I
need I need to make sure that the sign
is different each time you
know his his PHR I don't
know because people like
it let's switch to something
else whenever time Runs Out hi P hello
yto
welcome as she she was just changing to
out was
just that was all I was SC going
on
so this is the drawing I was working on
last time and
I had wrong software selected so I did
pon pon this is pon pon full of
energy and this is
spinning Ben Nev
relation yep chasing outfit out in the
open well some some do
that some people are
crazy so I've not drawn this bunny
before
so this will be the first
[Music]
time so this will this isum this is
rotate okay then here we go everything
shows up fine yes appears to be doing
that
so something like that I
[Music]
guess just going to draw and see how it
goes oh yeah I needed that reference
picture
of of the other one I had of
[Music]
Wasing what are people saying sketch
Benny I have dishes to wash again oh oh
well I
hopefully it goes quick and
easy yes it is sketch P that's
that's that's how I start
sketching the sketch bunny was you're
making sketch
[Music]
bues Benny does have a little tail but
it's very tiny in here and I want to see
it and it's turn around which is very
rare
blacking from the side or
something
while on pon pon it kind of breaks
physics and not shows
an though um here we go this is what I'm
looking
[Music]
for
this
[Music]
one so back here what this
here
guet contact
me I I'll draw your first I'm being hurt
by the sketch bunny
and it's going to be very
tragic so in this picture the mouse is
completely separate but if I oh
no res set
to
I think I forgot to put the character on
screen
also so wait um so I'll fix that by the
way
yeah settings no it says to show they H
[Music]
interesting interesting why doesn't
Mouse Cates show up
then oh it does show up
interesting okay it is it is showing up
but
okay I need to
do
um I need to
change
[Music]
how do I
oh there
[Music]
go shouldn't there be settings for
now I need to look this
up okay there we
go
hm okay currently I do have the issue
that the tablet is registering on both
screen as one large area and it does
make drawing very
tricky so I decided to look up how to
set it to two screen to to set it to a
single screen but only message I get is
people saying like how do I get the pen
to work on multiple screens and people
say no you can only get it to work on
one screen I have the issue of it
working on multiple screens and I only
want it to work on
screen so how
guys that it so it only follows the
single schen because I only wanted to
follow a single schen
because like I do have
[Music]
[Music]
like
properties but it doesn't give me any
settings for which greens it's going to
use which is problem at
moment and I'm
using multiple screens
because oh here we go I found this
secret
menu
okay there we
go now it should only be one screen okay
this makes more
sense perfect now now my circles are
going to be more beautiful unfortunately
I do not know anything about mulp it's
way it's fine I finally find it I always
draw with my drawing tablet with a mouse
It's Tricky I mean yeah that's why I
have a drawing tablet because drawing
drawing with the mouse is some some are
good with it
but
it's dra tet
is well
Mouse but with
[Music]
a few more creatures I mean this is as
as far as software is concerned it's
basically use the mask
pressure angle if you
want but this brush doesn't use angle
anyway doesn't really use pressure ID
so it's just
a mouse
curs
anyway which doesn't mean I have to use
the mouse for the second screen but
that's
fine that's why
drawing
be so so anyway as was going to
say before
I not sh on this
drawing this mouse here
is completely
separate but if we go and check
[Music]
the like I look I looked at this one to
be used for the eyes it's very tiny
but on the screen it's kind of kind of
hard to see
but the
is like the mouse connects
to I wonder if it does it on every each
of these probably
[Music]
does maybe doesn't this one
to it appear here so I mean I could
throw it that
way this is this is the issue with me
wanting to be Act because I want it
to and looking closer is basically on
every one of these except for
one check yes there there's a single one
that does not connect and this this
one that Mouse is completely separ but
is a specific artist to made
this
so
so whatever I guess I guess uh maybe
it's up to whatever people feel
like he has two most where the eyes
are
yep there's this
[Music]
as
I guess in most art it's yeah looking at
like most of the art if is actually not
connected like be some p p so maybe I
should go with that on the emotes it
is a
bit inconsistent
with which is fine I mean it's such a
tiny details you're not going to see it
and small art anyway I want to see on
his stream
thing on his stream character he
actually does have but his stream
characters is so different visually from
the
[Music]
drawings for some reason I'm not I'm not
here to criticize I'm just I'm just
observing it's it's perfectly fine to do
whatever you
more of
course I just find it
interesting sure uh when pon pon is
moving 3
the how pon pon is going to look might
is very likely to change
but probably wants to try to represent
that in any artwork as
well
let's see what is important is that 3 p
Pon
is at least as cute as 3
[Music]
P that is what
important so I will go with the 2D level
I mean Benny
because that's
what I'm drawing
today this is a good
Mouse
um I need to make sure that this yeah
yeah like
that hello you hello controller jar well
let me start washing dishes so I can
take my shower or I'll be just be luy
okay like
like yeah I will probably
contact yeah I think that's what I'll
will
do I will
contact uh Papa
canis and ask him
about how he did the
uh the SHP
um
BX and then I will use that to
implement additional features to the
[Music]
Stream
one of them being random
fruit which is what I've decided should
[Music]
be each day you will be able to and I'm
I'm thinking of no REM is not here
I'm he might be able to hear
he not here but he will here oh I
completely I to keep track of who got it
first I'm bad at
this wait why can't I
access all options no I didn't want to
do
that
um there we go it's about the first up I
couldn't see
[Music]
it here we
go I completely forgot to list that got
first yesterday
[Music]
and zator 21 got first a while
back there we go now I got all of
[Music]
them
it
yeah I was just thinking for a Time
first not that anyone's fighting over it
but I do feel like
it's
[Music]
might there have been moments in the
past where people had been annoyed by
how twitch has handled the
[Music]
redeem but I
will anyway if you need me just use the
secret
phrase that's a very
strange secret phrase and you just
published it
publicly
so it's not even secret
anymore
[Music]
you is the reference to the night to
say
okay I'm not familiar with that
so
didn't I to
say
night no night multiple of
them
not just
one I copy
this it does have very short hands but
that makes sense
see I guess this one should be behind
the
face here we
go
it's not much of a
neck let's get the shape of the
body then I will put clothes
over but making sure to that you have
the correct shape of the body first I'm
probably putting too much detail in this
but that ensures that
you that that it will look eh
fine that's that's a thing I've seen in
uh some art where people draw the
clothes and body like cloth and
body like they don't don't draw what the
body things like under the clothes so
the parts of the body you see that is
not covered by
clothes they don't
logically go together if that makes
[Music]
sense wait it doesn't make sense
how
yeah I hope it makes sense with that to
[Music]
see I guess some of the examples would
be on yeah I wanted to change
this I
check
[Music]
as I wanted
[Music]
to it like that because that would make
more sense anyway
so
should have
like shoulder straps or
something and
then the part the parts you see like
around the neck and the shoulder on the
other side that those parts just don't
go together because they were
drawn in the p ently of each
[Music]
[Music]
other know I I fix
[Music]
something
[Music]
yeah I think you like that
man
other examples are
[Music]
like visible tummy where you can see
like the the
lines on some drawings like they they
don't the legs hips and tummy and like
the rest of the body don't go to
together because they were all drawn
independently of kind like
that it definitely helps when you're
going to draw clothes on a cus to
draw the idea of what the body looks
like on the
needes you don't have to do like the
finished line on work
[Music]
but
really like sketching it
out that's some drawing tips for anyone
[Music]
drawing
like I kind of want to show an example
but should focus on drawing and I
shouldn't criticize
AR on St for it
first Sometimes they might have drawn
with the
body it's just that the end result
didn't after when we it I mean
yeah like I guess someone could argue
that this doesn't go together yeah could
see it just
that pink dots no no pink dots I don't
see any pink dots I don't know what
you're talking
about there are there are no pink STS
here don't feel like I made a head too
small I made the heads too
[Music]
[Music]
small there we go that's
[Music]
that SL lar your
hand do
you maybe it's because I haven't drawn
the arms
yet
or
something maybe I should
like make the body appear a bit
smaller it also
help something like
[Music]
that that that
helps
like
[Music]
that yeah I'm drawing this on the same
layer face it like
[Music]
that
okay maybe a bit too much perspective
there
see I don't
[Music]
[Music]
know
[Music]
anyway there you
go and then
[Music]
the CH should be
white here's also a good idea to like
plan
out where it should be where should go
before it end
cles
[Music]
don't like
[Music]
that I me something to be
ears I did miss
something okay
they very big
[Music]
[Music]
ears
and then oh yeah I didn't also miss that
this Benny has pink on on side of the
foot even do B bunnies don't have that I
mean onless you check like under
[Music]
the
[Music]
there's been like people said but I
looked at a bunny and they do have beans
under their on their feet on under the
feet in that case it wasn't a bunny you
looked
at but sure bu need to have like toes
under the
fur
[Music]
and and sometimes that might show
through the fur but there's still fur
over it
[Music]
so got a
star yeah the star will be removed
in to we need this start was the
temporary fruit
redeem but then it would be a fruit
redeem I guess I make the fruit redeem
for
[Music]
one what I could do here's a here's a
more radical
idea what if the fruit is
not I like to sub in the daily checking
redem yeah but the fruit redeem is going
to be the daily checking
redeem that's the
[Music]
idea there still going to be more
but I was
thinking H about the daily routine that
instead of actually having it per
stream like most have it's instead like
with with like an hour cool down or
something meaning that if you stick
around
you don't have to stick around but if
you at least show up once an
hour you can redeem it
[Music]
again encouraging people to come
[Music]
back I don't know if this is a
good and yeah should be kind of like the
daily routine it's just hourly
[Music]
redeem but you can only redeem it while
the stream is going
seriously some redeems you can redeem
while being
offline but I've set some redeems to
only be redeemable while I'm actually
streaming such as the outet changes
that's only super people don't waste
their points
on and thanks for letting me borrow the
Dr No had an oil stand on my frame pan I
need to get some of the bonifer of the
dress to absor the didn't use the dress
yes brush the B feet bif fire is not
very absorbent as it out oh well well
good idea that you didn't use the dress
at me it would be a shame if there was
a oil stain on it in that case I will
need to put it in the in the wash and
have to wait for it
to be
washed then I wouldn't have the dress to
wear wouldn't that be
[Music]
unfortunate now we don't want that do
[Music]
we
okay let's
see
so here want visible
here no ear
[Music]
here I could show there we
go like
[Music]
here
nice
[Music]
here we
go wait no ear here
[Music]
near okay that was
[Music]
forced oh a perpect
bunny well it's just to see
[Music]
where so this does allow me to like
[Music]
it's hard to be
[Music]
accurate this allows me to move the ear
kind
of gu it looks kind of
[Music]
[Music]
weird
ear
and continue to forcing the
jokes yeah I think that works that that
is good I'm happy with that I think no
I'm not with that after sing
[Music]
out I'm more happy with that I think
maybe yeah I think that we
good I think that' be
good yeah this is this
one what are you giggling about p p pun
bun
[Music]
yes why you Kling out yes I am the pun
bun because I'm making
[Music]
puns
here we go look at this I didn't even
okay
okay I need to
add ink
stuff because apparently he has
that Pake
bunny does he approve of me saying
that look at
[Music]
this and pon pon does not have pop
pads I don't know if Lolly has that have
that bald feet because um yeah it's like
shaved
foot it's a r if you see the pink stuff
on the r like that it's like
shaved that's it P pon pon has hands
there's no pop pass on that and then
there's the feet which there's no P
pants plus I mean you can't see the on
side anyway
but I've decided that there is no poor
pads
regardless Benny also has hands which
does not have po po po pads but the feet
are have po pads on them
so that's his decision not
M I'm just saying that bues don't have
it and I wish but the only thing I can
say is I wish more bunny streamers could
uh follow that they don't have to but I
wish they
[Music]
need the Ben is one of them and H BLX
which We R it not long ago it also
has my PO pads
but she is quite a different
like she's very bloby bunny if that
makes sense hecto means even if they're
not correct like yeah I
know I know I just like to be to correct
sometimes that's my problem and as I
mentioned LOL I have no idea because she
has she has hands so kind of
like every like pon pon Benny and leave
no h Pop Eyes on hat but she has shoes
on
so I don't even
know um what her feet actually does she
have rabbit feet or like more like human
feet H we need to
be
out I just take a shower now be backing
be
[Music]
okay I have to ask that
[Music]
on a bit of a personal question
but actually she she did change model
and does she she still wear shoes with
that
one you cute
[Music]
bunny she is a great artist be the
me she makes very
[Music]
lovely
yeah this is the new yes she the last sh
on
well then I could confirm
[Music]
that this is too big too big
tooing
it's
Bean kind of maybe maybe this this lines
being too
short yeah go again I guess back to my
joke like asking that this is a personal
question
but you have balls or feet in those
shoes
could just be on theed
too anyway there we go
oh wait what's this oh that was with the
[Music]
[Music]
ear ear so ning anyway
[Music]
there you go
so with
this I could
then
I I so I when I
draw I do like
I just
want I can't change the transparency
which is
silly so
when
it's no one's hydrating
me hydrates my own
myself
no as going to
say before I interupting
myself so I do the inish show very very
rough sketch and then I do this kind
of trying to follow the
outline
um but this the lines are still very
bubly then H then the final step is the
line art I mean there's steps after that
but when it comes to line out but
sometimes I do one in between step where
I can uh try to
try to do a much more cleaner outline
but still not Define an
outline and I
should
uh maybe do
that think that would result in a better
fin
on I do want a few
more ideas of how people draw pom
poms I think this gives me a good idea
to draw pom
poms so I will
do yeah because I have the sketch three
pen have too many sketch
pens so here I would kind of like try to
draw the
outline but this is not actual
outline
it's kind of playing out where kind of
where the outside should
[Music]
go
[Music]
and I would try to not like for
[Music]
the this one exactly so I can get
so each of these actually will look
different from each
other because when it comes to the at
least the outline I don't want to copy
the outline
anyway I want every single line on the
artwork to be individual
[Music]
drone
yeah probably draw this one in front
[Music]
[Music]
actually
[Music]
here we
go one p
p Sor switch
[Music]
for S so AES Swit for
[Music]
clear
[Music]
and I've used
[Music]
the in the past very way before I
started
sping used to word clearer to mean
done
which some games have
done such game being kurushi which I
playing the
stream and it makes for sense for like
games where you actually clear the level
and then you have cleared
it
yeah I'm clear drawing this kind
of
there artist made this this look
great I'm just making it
terrible
but I'm
try oh
[Music]
one I'll continue
going
[Music]
[Music]
so I do want to I get the armpit work
here
gu I probably watch people want
see
right
see if I'm trying to
to
a benefits growing pom poms is that you
don't have to draw hands but then you
have to draw pom
poms
so this
that very uneven here
let's see
I that's see
more
more
[Music]
I think the whole pon pon is a bit too
wide I should
probably s
it squish everything before i r
the final
outlines
[Music]
what are you
doing maybe this attracts more people to
come and
watch my
streams that's true I mean
she d a huge layer of dress on the
outside but see the swimsuit works too
the swimsuit seems more appropriate
[Music]
[Music]
too
but I'm happy that you are
here spending
time quality time all time with one is
quality
time
well good to have that
[Music]
confirmed
[Music]
[Music]
so
this
too
much DET thingss
[Music]
on
[Music]
I
[Music]
then I
can do like
that that
[Music]
part
[Music]
hello
hello welcome
welcome oops oops
progress now it's I still I still didn't
draw the clothes I GL I forgot that
[Music]
part ah
[Music]
I guess I have to go back and do that
[Music]
then bunch
of
[Music]
so should they have matching outfits or
should nille have or Benny actually has
his own how's it all going going all
right I'm actually making good progress
I'm happy with
how how they oh come on this stop
me how how it moves
[Music]
along
now I'm dropping the
pen
so yeah I could just see if I
can draw
uh all
right Benny looks good in a skirt we
should have one more
often
dress as a mage she dress as a chili
[Music]
day
so does appear kind of far
down smooth
pain or something I don't
know chill day one like absolutely
freezing is it cold it's probably very
cold here I was outside today it
was cold ohus 12 H that's kind of
cold it's going to be - 177 it's
midnight but I mean that's the middle of
the night that's probably more
understandable yeah it was kind of cold
today when I went
out took some nice walk Fresh
Hair where with C to attach anything
indors I'm
like
must be really
cold I hope you're dressing up
warm it sounds like it's real cold
yeah I got my feet on top of a hot water
bottle that's good that's good wrapped
yourself in a lot of
blankets being old warming
see no carpets so ice
flers this room has
like I don't know exactly what it
[Music]
is
yeah but this house has a flow
heating so there are no carpets for that
or
anything otherwise all the feting would
be stuck under the
carpet I
presume let's do something like this I
think this can work
then is
like something something
something right
wa I need
[Music]
to
it was more ni
[Music]
nice
[Music]
D there we
[Music]
go then I can
[Music]
cut
maybe I keep them separate for
[Music]
now I want to do something like
[Music]
that something
something
[Music]
footage kind of covering everything here
[Music]
[Music]
so and then uh
[Music]
top on that bunny feet yep
that's that's the feet of a
[Music]
bunny okay very happy bunny boops
s boops the feet boops the snoot boops
boops the boops
oop okay let's
see what I can
do
I have
like nine
there yeah I I work with that there
doesn't
work Makey
work there we go that's some
cloes
I should
probably
[Music]
like
this
it would be easy for me
to my l where to go there we
go a nice
outfit that goes
well that fits him
[Music]
well
oh um
[Music]
yes and then after
this this would be
the not the real outline but where I'm
planning on putting it and
then doing this one I will
do the one for B
need more
hydrate
all focus
on on the drawing
here but still feel free
to write whatever you want in the
chat when I it's very chilly
today a nice
Cory
ging
art this will be the second artwork with
pon pon and another
streamer and a second art what I do of
a excluding one point of
course maybe I should maybe I should do
it more I need to find more bunny
streamers
control I
not
to draw
like could drop one sick n that should
be the sickness of
this that could
work
and then this
bunny I don't think you would see Ben's
tail from
that I hope that's
[Music]
fine
I hope it's clear that is funny
anyway well that was theum that wasn't
rotate
I just
want I look at it for another angle and
it just
disappears question
okay how come you don't draw with 100%
opacity
uh that is a good
question I don't know if I
like draw across
I kind of see that lines are
crossing it's like slightly more
information than if I wasn't but this
isn't F yeah so I will do the final out
H outline will be
100% 100%
opacity which is
something I started
doing and kind of got
stuck and it's I don't know I just like
it and I was I guess it kind
of reminds me that this isn't the final
line works I shouldn't be too picky
about
it I guess
it's
not sure how actually I want
[Music]
to how did
I actually do it on
my no I never I don't think I've done it
nope both are full
coverage not done it
before
[Music]
[Music]
I
[Music]
so yeah then
yeah I think I need to
make on a bit
[Music]
narrower even though not can a lot of
NES
n
use
another question is how did he see that
it wasn't 100%
capacity here it's very obvious
now
line it doesn't
show is even if I draw across here being
able to see this I don't
know good eye cuz I could see the lines
on lines okay good eye you have good
eye
[Music]
it's on stream with all the compression
everything not too easy to
[Music]
see you have an eye detail you know how
to fix that if you want yeah I mean yeah
have intentionally set it
to
but said this this isn't
Define line
line line lines doesn't
matter I think
YouTuber I know uses in line art is to
make different bar from different colors
yeah
this there's a there's a few I wanted to
do that I
mean that's how
that's how
Lolly
draws and
um when I did the other drawing let's
present it
here this drawing I did follow the
uh this
same
just yeah I used the official col that
she used
so this Tak such time for me
to but I did it I did spend a lot of
time doing that but funun is still like
black black outlines because that's how
I did make p
Pon C raming change my opacity night I
don't know if it's a key or something
with NI
you use a tablet I would assume it could
[Music]
be maybe some depends
[Music]
on um maybe there's some gesture that's
buil in
that does
something cuz I I justest might do some
uh
I was I was I was
thinking scrolling and a modify key did
only zooming and rotating that was not
aing but otherwise it could be some H
keyboard mouse input that it simulates
with a certain D that in clip Studio
that changes the opacity but in other
software is doing something has I know I
tried to make it happen I can't do it on
purpose I have not had it happen at
least
and what random stuff happening for me
been a while since I used it last and
this is like the first artwork I do com
[Music]
back
[Music]
um the only thing I noticed happen is
that but that was on the othero computer
sometimes when I hover and to move the
cursor the cursor just doesn't move
until I actually press and then draw and
then it starts working again but that
must have been something with other
computer because I'm not have this
happened so far and it did happen
several times per stream
[Music]
before not often
but
should have at least happened now if it
was something with tablet or clip Studio
but it must have been something with
computer
ST I don't think it happened outside
clip
Studio something with with it with the
other computer in
combination but that's the tri part with
comps there's so many
[Music]
words oh yeah I I wanted to ask you
Neville if there was like a
certain design you would like or the
outfit cuz I want I'm going to drop P
pom with the
one which one i' I've used
for which I should bring up as a
reference
and I did say ne but not
J but you're you're welcome to chat
too but
um I
could I was semi listening but I'm happy
you're here listening I'm okay with
anything honestly I I assum
so I was just curious if you have any
preference otherwise if you want like
because you need draw
with matching outfit so maybe I should
do that too cuz in that case I'll do
like pon pon
outfit uh yeah no I can't do
that and then this there we
[Music]
go three
model so yellow with pink outlines which
just the design I use for the
cheerleader
emote and I can use that
design in that
case maybe I should try
to steal from
myself
[Music]
it is a bit from an angle
[Music]
but how do I best copy this over can
I duplicate layer no it doesn't have
that's much watch can I drag l no why
why would you be able to do that can
press copy and paste oh at least you
could to
that so
tiny so wobbly maybe copying it like
that didn't work
well oh you have a s looks amazing
what's that and it is um well actually
actually I could show a better picture
that we'll show what it is
for
um let's say no that's
me oh wait yeah I should probably
search
Channel wait how long it was it was
while I work on
this okay let me find did
I
yes so how do I best open
these I just be able to open on stream
let me just add sour because I really
should have that on this one
too oh let me copy it from
here what where is it this one and then
copy and I go back
here and
paste why can't it paste where I wanted
it to paste there we
go now I can just copy the it like that
there we go
hey I love the
transition thank you I did it
myself let's watch it again
bunnies oh I didn't do the transition
back I guess it didn't finish the
transition what game is that it is a
crash it is Crash B 4 it's about time
the PC version
uh cuz that one support
mods
so technically you can someone has
modded the
uh the switch
version and here is I'm going to make
the b yellow because that's what the
emote has oh that's so cool
I'm I'm bad
with and also your version in the sketch
looks better
or oh the the B
yeah I tried to do it but no it didn't
work
out H so in Crash 4 which is a crash B
good game you can
that
was you can you can select outfits so I
have made multiple outfits you Che
from so the so the mod is replacing Coco
but it's not only replacing Coco but
every outfit as well like like so it's
going to be the regular
dress and it's going to
be
it's going to be evil version of Pon P I
love to get ban in more games as need
company and of course be
yeah of
course leer company have seen some
gameplay I don't exactly know what's
going on in the game H you make mod
yourself I've in this case I've
used H
Coco because it's easier when mod use
the original
model have
you you said that you Benny SE those and
valheim I'm actually not or valheim
probably um I'm not familiar
with but have you modded that yourself
or had someone else do it
let's
see I I want to
[Music]
find I guess I don't have a good picture
of
that and let's Tak a short break
here no my mate did it for me how nice I
have no skin
that sometimes it's surprisingly easy
but sometimes it can be very frustrating
depending on what you want to do
um
but I would like to see how it turned
out cuz it it is it is it is great to
see so I see I see it
actually the final result of it so
because pon pon is a bunny and I'm
modding crash which is all only but the
same company as
Spyro as I decided that one of the
outfits must be the the the bunny
Inspire hello Grims gri Mr Green 17 I
haven't been on your streams for a while
to be honest
to to be
fair and I want
to just not have the opportunity
to or convenience to watch as much
streams as I wanted to do but I'm trying
to get back to it because it is
fun
yeah currently thinking looking at
the model and I
also also have fun for wearing Coco's
outfit because that was a fun idea
and another outfit people thought was
fun the these like older ones before I
took in game s shots before I find like
a camera
mode bunny P pon pon
dress a bunny in a bunny suit with with
fake ears while having the real
ears people thought that was
[Music]
funny and if the very first two I made
was these two because they were and very
SM pie too
apparently can I scale both SP at the
same time
no there's no option for that I can
scale one way and then I move
it that L cuz this mostly there is um
this part is actually in
3D which is the swimsuit pon pon
have and I like outfits this H doing all
these kind of outfits which is why what
I am doing I wish I could do this stuff
I love to get F to dress up in other
costumes I i' I'd love to like I'm all
for having Benny as a m and a Sher
leader I would love to see
that why is that right one black black
blank no it's it's uh um it's like a a
black Ste side
suit and just doing Mouse here we go now
I can just
ch it's might still just be a black
suit it probably e to see in game
[Music]
shot it was a very easy one to
do and it was the first one I made
[Music]
so oh like a St suit yeah
[Music]
yeah and
[Music]
then
just and I guess there's this
one that people liked for obvious
reasons anyway moving
[Music]
on um
[Music]
that's
um
he the funny
one there is like a prehistoric version
of Coco so that's the equ version of
that because this like a preor World
[Music]
level there so it's it'ss right
in and like patterns everywhere
I I I tried to make up some patterns but
I I I and the symbol on the hand there
is should be completely I like I try to
completely make it up if it's similar to
another symbol it is a coincidence
because I have not taken inspiration
from any existing symbols I I hope so I
can imagine a few the house is getting
extra
yeah
the yeah people are a few people who
like the the beginning and here's PL one
as a
dog because why
not and the final and the final I think
I've shown every outfit
now and the final
outfit which
is I still have more more outfits to do
I'm not filled every is
this oh that's adorable maybe you think
so I I try to make it as adorable and
people find this one adorable as well
pon pon as a robot with like a
computer screen a screen as a
head
it's so the It's Kind kind of hard to
see I've changed the material since
taking the
screenshots it is slightly hard to see
maybe this is why I would
prefer in way of doing it the the face
should be pixel art I I don't think
pixel art is correct pixels I find I
find a way in unreal to actually make
it sharp pixels so that's what it is now
since this screenshots taken but it also
depends on how close you are to face and
how high resolution you're playing the
game in and so
on
yeah tutorial
but wait I I'm not not familiar with
this but try I try to Google it but uh
it's something you made up now or is
reference to something
but yeah that's the that's that's
that well it was creative I thought it
was
something
um yeah that's I've had fun doing those
outfits and I will make more that she
looks like
the kind of character that teachers you
to play I could see
that this
thing teach teaching
bunny so there is one other mod I do
want to
show and it's this this
[Music]
one pon pon replacing
spire
[Music]
so
now you can play SPID with I
think you
you yeah I
think you've seen this one
before yes she has like wings so she can
fly better
Bunny and then like changing the
textures to be
[Music]
Benny that would be
fun yeah because I
[Music]
remember having the idea to
[Music]
like quickly like like make a Benny
version
we
shouldn't I give it still
[Music]
mostly like mostly still the same
removing the
bow changing
the actually would pick quite a few
[Music]
changes
[Music]
there okay let's
do
[Music]
print
want I wanted a bed wait I do
[Music]
have
[Music]
because I got this one which has this
[Music]
print let me steal
it I will I will rroy
it when it comes to
linear but for
now it will be this
[Music]
one cuz I do want all of
the
[Music]
line arts to
be no
stickers I want the line not to be
original to the
artwork every single line should be
originally
drawn but on this between step
I
might
cheat and then it should
be than to
drawing but yeah the goal is to finish
the all the outfit for pon pon the mod
and then I will play Crash
4 with the pon pon
mod and
then play with every
outfit switching
[Music]
around I this I made the swimsuit as to
shown and the dress and so this only the
S Weare left to do for the mod when it
comes to the outfits available on
stream then there are many more outfits
I have to
be it is said that it is possible to add
more
outfits but I tried to do that but it
was
unsuccessful I might be able to work
which the person
[Music]
who because the one person
there because
there there are two
skins why you call game call it skins
there are two skins that are exclusive
to PlayStation which was only meant to
be
exclusive until the end
of 2022
all right yeah wiy crash B
Cod
or it's about time/ skins and then you
go to
like trivia and at the bottom it
says there we go yeah to to the end of
2021 so it's there are 2 years since
that date and they still have not
released those two skins so they are
still exclusive even though they
shouldn't be and I think I might and I
i' have been hello festive hello
hello welcome I have been considered
that if it should be almost considered
false
marketing H to say that it will come out
on other
consoles and computer and then they they
don't do it cuz it shouldn't require too
much effort for them to just release it
cuz the work cuz the only work they have
to do is make it compatible it's
basically which could be a lot of work
I'm not denying that but they don't
actually have to make the models or
anything because they're on M so anyway
a person made a mod for PC that has
copied them over from
PlayStation which I am using in my
mod
[Music]
um so that I get two additional outfits
for my
mod but but yeah the person said if I
remember correctly that in theory or I
think the person even tested it but you
should be able to add even more
outfits yeah what's is the topic at hand
I'm talking about Crash 4 it's about
time but if you want to talk about
something else you feel free to write
anything in
chat I change topic a
lot and and it's about the
mod the mod I'm made for the game
replacing Coco with pon
pon
along with every
outfit and after I filled out every
outfit slot that the game has I really
would like to add more slots if
possible oh
cool and I had a segment before on
stream but I did show up the
different outfits I
made
they can be
found on my
server Discord server
too by a searching for I really should
put them all in one place I guess wrong
button
again yeah I should probably do that we
create like a
thread un locked thread
where gather all of them
in if I can
remember probably write myself a
note
on there you
go that's
my and then I hopefully see
it I plan on the one work on my first
model UNS sure if it I un sure if I
would use it but my go at moment is just
like through the modeling that's a that
would be the first step
yeah try to uh
that's and
yeah I messed around with blender a lot
before I even started modding cuz h I
just liked even before blender I used
gole
SketchUp which has some convenience
convenient too that blender doesn't have
but actually making a character in SK sh
is very
[Music]
tricky so I would say that blend there
is easier to make
C but even before sketch up I used
another software that was even more
terrible when it came to 3D
modeling was fun to go back to it but I
don't remember what it was
[Music]
called there some weird 3
Tunes I could make characters in 3D but
they were just 2D and like thick that
was the 3D nice of the
models
already kind of know how to navigate
blers thanks to spending a lot of time
doing VR chat TR from game characters
using models from the game you st from
yeah
[Music]
that's yeah yeah you knowing the g r and
s very useful to yeah that case you
have because it's knowing how to
navigate blender is
your shortcuts are very
[Music]
useful I believe you
[Music]
could you will be able to do
it
and of course starting at a more small
project
is good I could start with depends on
what what your model will be like how
complicated it will
be I've been on like modding s see a few
people having ideas for mods they want
to do as the first
mod
and sometimes they have
very large Grand ideas that might be a
bit tricky as a
first it's the first mod
[Music]
project and the risk
is that the person would just get
confused annoyed at not being able to to
get anything to work and gaming up on
the whole right
here my car is also kind of simplistic
since it's a plus we
just round hands with no fingers and
button
eyes yeah that
would that doesn't it doesn't
cute I am interested in seeing how this
character looks
like
I like
[Music]
plushies feel like I'm bad
at talking that's
[Music]
my I've see so many stream being so
good to people but I'm so bad at it I'm
trying to be
friendly
anyway I likees too I haven't had
any had any ears then maybe you
should find yourself a plushy a cute
little
plushy a nice
companion oh adds
randomly
um r
[Music]
let me know if you don't have
ads in that case we can continue I have
skipped ads oh very short
ads I guess sometimes there's not much
to
show get de set to three minutes
it would all ads bunched up at this
moment and then no more ads for an hour
OR7
minutes sometimes one I'm I'm actually
glad for
that like in this in this case this I'll
get back to your comments after this
that you got like 30 seconds ads even
though it should be 3 minutes but it
still gives you like 59 minutes of adree
content
that that sounds like a great
deal like I don't want people to have
ads um but I mean it's I mean I could if
I have like less I could have less ads
but that means that ad would play when
you join the stream and I think that's
more annoying than actually having stre
minutes of ads anyway back to your
comment the ones I had when I was SU kid
is I either broken or I gave them to
family me yeah I don't have any pluses
from when I'm skid I'm not surprised
that that I think that applies to most
people it is nice when people do have
them but I don't I feel like most people
don't but the plushy thing I getting one
in like 3 months time so are you
commissioning one like maybe based on
your character I have a bunch of
plushies yes you do you do have bunch of
plus I do have bunch of plushies
too again it's a plushy of an indie game
character c c from the game sud regalia
no expl I have no idea what that is oh
Pon Pon One Thing Benny's hairstyle has
CH oh May yeah no
problem no problem
that's I've been thinking about because
I want when I draw someone's character I
would do want to draw them as accurately
as possible but of course my style
still thank
[Music]
you um yes
that's yes yes they got a r hand now
three three three hairs three round
hairs suu reg is a three platform that
looks like an 64
game and 64 game an N64 game that's
really fun you if you say so maybe I
should I think I for because I do play
games mostly playing
games oh it's on Steam
too and it's not that
expensive the character Cil is a goat
rabbit cat
lady I
see there like a third
person I get
like yeah action adventure
IND is an
interesting quite an interesting
character
design doing that I mean yeah I've heard
like some people say when I was try to
say like oh if you're doing low poly
it's just quicker and easier but it is
actually tricky to actually make it look
good and I think
they because they they go for a certain
art style and they still and it still
looks
good and I've seen some I've seen
some some n6 games that looks terrible
and I think
they if they're actually using the
correct po count and such for to make it
actually be able to run in a
gen sorry
I he fits more with the fact his entire
body shape is WR yeah that is true I do
still think it works but
but but sure I uh I I'll I'll use the
correct
[Music]
one but he but Benny is very rounded
that is true the game has kind of been
stuck in my head for
month is
it it is it has been released yes when
was it released oh it's been out for
half a
year so you're
was it like was it like a crowdfunded
and it was uh a reward for it's not
reward I mean it's it's a purchase and
it was a
purchase that you did as part of the
donations it's not a donation if you pay
for
it I know I'm picky but yeah
pressed a plus in in supporting the game
or or if it's just something they have
sold
after the
game the game was made for a game Jam
but then the they decided to work on it
more afterwards to put it on Steam
ah so so so is the pl say is the pl Like
official or is it was or was it a
commission for someone else you bed it
on that c well already 6 16:00 didn't
think I'd be that gone for that long
it's yeah it's been 2 hours since the
stream
started okay I got a l mode now I'm
starting early please take care have a
good time and I will all the love have a
nice
time it's nice of you to come by
thank you for letting me know about the
new
hash
and probably got
PPC
[Music]
bye-bye anyway back
to my my thoughts are going everywhere
the game doesn't have much plots I me I
mean as long as the game is fun to play
It's Going of big i' I've been playing a
few games that have quite
not not much when it comes to PL as long
as the game play is fun it looks nice so
far thank you P girl to think should
call you
puu girl let
K so let's see if I can make these hair
work um it's kind of still based on
this
shape but instead it
is it is
rounded something like
that not
perfect this one prob I could probably
draw
and
yeah
yeah I see I think that
works the game is very fun the moment is
such
fun you've been playing it a
lot been C Stu thinking
about
it's it probably could be so could be a
game that actually would fit my yeah
because as you said the game doesn't
have much plot and I think that is the
kind of game I do
prefer I'm not much of a story
person it's perfectly fine to have a
story
but this story shouldn't
be I don't want to play for the story I
want to play for the game play and it's
perfectly fine however other people want
to play games of
course don't don't take it wrong
way we play for different
reasons game is short but
open well at least like if it's short I
can definitely give it that and I mean
it's not expensive either so I could
definitely give it a
try it will take maybe 46 hours to beat
it the first time but that's it can be
like 2 hours when you know everything
are
well in that case could take
like two streams for
me if I
[Music]
think because there are some games I
played on stream that have been quite
short probably because I know have known
the
game so maybe that's
[Music]
fun fun with that bag does it have
Collectibles to find does it have like
100% in the
game I do like the 100%
games but the game doesn't need to have
like
100%
things it's
fine
a few
yeah so because one thing I'd like to do
which I guess wouldn't be relevant to
this game in particular is uh I like to
play through whole
[Music]
franchises oh yeah I could play clono 2
now as well
I don't have the Remake I'm playing I'm
playing kind of the original
games play the original PS1
version now I should probably play
theing 2
[Music]
version can tell oh CL 2 yes
that's so yeah so
and one thing I'm joked about for
another streamer who was doing
like
[Music]
um plays through some games franchises
watch to do
like FIFA or something like
that
but I could do it it's not there's not
really any Collectibles or unlocks or
anything but doing like a
season and that and winning that that
would be consider completing the game
would be annoying to not win it and have
to restart all
game the first one well I don't want to
say spoilers for anyone who hasn't
played was should
play did you like
itan there are emblem bits that are
pretty much like the pieces of heart
from Zelda collect a specific amount to
get more max HP original powerups to
give small Buffs the main powers give
you new abilities a few keys and five
big Collectibles needed to be the
key not not like too much Collectibles
but still still a few things to collect
that's I do like collecting things so it
does sound interesting oh sounds
interesting
yeah yeah I'd like to give it a try I
should add it to the list of games to
play yes I liked
it it's was a fun
game and it was fun to
play the
CLA I should also play more more of the
Need for Speed
games I just need to figure out what to
do with the music in that game what I
could
do which is can uh
what which I know some people do which
technically isn't
allowed is that uh you can have uh two
audio tracks on Twitch one one that is
played live and the other one which is
saved on The V what I could do playing
NE for Speed is that the game audio is
only played live but is not saved on the
vot but at the same time that would make
the
vot and of bad to rewatch afterwards if
there's no audio at all I wish the
um the music of the game could play on a
separate source
from the sound effects of the game so
that if you do rewatch The V afterwards
you can at least still hear the game but
just not
music
but unless there's a way to mod
that to the speed games but is a very
particular
mod I enjoyed my time with it so yeah
you said you couldn't stop while
thinking about it so that's definitely
sound like something that's definitely
new or think and I just think the main
character is very cool it did look like
an interesting character especially with
the combination of
animals that definitely
something and I do want to see the
pl so I
[Music]
do not that actually not to ad tce my
server too much but that is one option
to join server post a photo whenever you
get a chance to
or you are free to combine this
stream at the later point and share a
[Music]
picture
[Music]
that so far sh links is open because
that has not been abused
yet
what I will might what I will have to do
in the future but I want to do it better
is
that I will prevent anyone from sending
links unless you are
preapproved which would be like mods
mods and other people that like other
streamers I know and people I get to
know better but this permission can be
voked if it's
abused I'm currently holding one of my
plushies or the plush is holding me
since she's a big kangaroo
plushy yeah I do have a very large P
which I like to
sleep next to that's the correct tracing
here I
realized
and it's more like she's she's huging me
than I'm more than I'm hanging
her honestly Turing a plushy but soon
soon you'll have
one and the large Pand I have I've also
got clothes for so I'd like to give her
different
outfits
right now she's wearing a nice flowery
dress to b b i I'm not going to change
her outfit every time I go to
sleep so she's going to wearly regular
clothes while she's
sleeping this kind have like small HS so
excited for my simple plus
c I really hope it's
uh it's going yeah I hope I hope
it I'm missing my
words no missing I'm I'm I'm not finding
the
corre I hope it turns out to be a really
great
place that's kind
[Music]
what
I wouldn't mind having plushes of some
characters and speaking of
plushies and it is just the thing I
don't want to repeat too often cuz I
don't want to come off with
kny that I want to make a plush of pon
pon that I want to in some way try to
crowd
fund and uh it's going to and I want it
to be a really large plh at at least 1 M
tall and having the option to change her
outfit just like on
stream the wish she should come with
dress and swimsuit and the sports
wear and then you can dress her and and
then like if she has somewhat human like
proportions which she kind of
has you you could also just buy regular
clothes from the store and give her as
well I want the fun fun plushy yes
there's a few people who want that and I
really if if we are a large enough group
of people we could get it for a good
enough price and also at a good enough
quality because I do want the quality
good because I want the plush
two quick someone C markable plush
course what I don't know what that is
then not be able to pet pon pon soft
ears yes a few people want to pet pon
pon
[Music]
ears and some people also wanted the
evil pon pon
I if you're not aware there's an evil
version of
pun oh didn't that work oh that's why I
had
that's
why pon pon I did have to transition
but now the transition is gone because
of previous
issues with glowing eyes and
stuff anyway back to regular p
p it's me I want an evil Pon plushy
too o de this little
cre so and the evil pon pon is just a
regular pon pon but black with red
patterns so when the design is made
for regular pon pon doing like an evil
pon pon shouldn't be too much extra
work Optimist Chief yes she does she
does evil thingss
like taking your the socks from your
sock drawer and put it in another
drawer then you have to look in the
wrong drawer to find your
socks he has a Little Fangs for drinking
blood no that's not what it's for she
still on left
socks
okay
and she will go to your shoes and if you
if you're the person who
like because I know there's like two
different some people like unti the
shoes to put them on and like put them
on and then tie them some people keep
the shoes tied so they just slip the
shoe on there's these two kind of people
and the evil PP
with
like untiy tide shoes or tidy unti
shoes so
[Music]
evil you
st
I just think let
see yeah it doesn't actually have an
outline on the
tongue I was going to say she un laes
your shoes entirely oh no that's that's
evil that's too evil evil P go bad for
good luck unlacing my shoes because I
wear boots no laces to tie or
untie she will swap them around so the
left shoes on the right
side
and then they put down the boots I did
call them shoes but they put down the
boots without looking and then you
wearing them on the wrong foot how
see you will not recover from that
[Music]
mistake so
evil so far I've
uh so today I'm drawing even though the
schedule doesn't say that well actually
I think I fixed the schedule it's
actually correct but not the schedule I
posted on Twitter
or
Discord but I got advice that I
I cuz I already got a device that can
capture the picture of from the play 3 I
thought you said she was
only Petty evil not evil
evil I mean sometimes she can got go
further oh was to check and hide shade
which I probably didn't do last time you
sent remember the save Sil on oh should
I have that I could have an redeem like
that
is to showing up oh wait what happened
with my my
dress and save your clothes
no J shows up remember to
same with with with a robotic
voice because I call you robot all
time
but I guess you aren't a
robot it's great that Yan was blamed for
that yeah it is I
mean it's not like I mean y would have
done that to you were just
quick it's just because do the others
too then you take the
opportunity I need a
county that St stats for how many times
a certain outfit has been chosen
I
can see who
[Music]
do see who the sees are the real
sees
[Music]
liing sugar getting hyper yeah that that
is
me is pon pon pon pon likes to eat sugar
and sugar
[Music]
stuff
and should have
some rice
ping I haven't had that in long
time I think I was even dreaming about
rice
ping this
night
ah a funny
emote what is that
[Music]
think licking pizza with an whole unsh
ananas which is not the what it's
called
unpeeled
un
grind going through a transformation
sequence and
pH could you please unrine the
apples
is it called the rind on an
Apple just making sure looking be
transforming into
nothing or is that is that pon pon after
drinking beer becoming alls like I don't
drink alcohol so I would probably be
very sensitive to it if I were consume
it swim SE yes that's a good one now it
was
y inert joke about how gener to
technically REM under way this time
because one is just wearing S at the
moment
anyway yes blame me for sweet seat
ha I mean swimsuit is not evil say
fine would I blame me for
it what with the
face maybe we should be more this
way maybe should be like that that could
work
face face face I believe it's a face it
is a
face a smirky
face smirky
face I really wish you could s like one
alien I can do like small it makes it
easier to find this
basically like the love and
heart is
to maybe twitch should make
automatic
ad6 I think I did wave at start I think
high is another
one and yes
I
high it's just high is harder to search
for so there's some highs and that is
that no I don't I think I think wave is
better term because that's more unique
hi matches to many other
emotes too few
letters when it comes to
love Yeah and
heart it doesn't really matter which it
is although love does match glove which
is the tear glove I don't King
you need to face the facts it's a face
of devious
misdirection yes definitely
is but if it's misdirected you need to
turn it around horizontal
flip
[Music]
with
that's an idea for a
drawing the bunny streamers are checking
their
feet p p doesn't have any po pants Ben
does and believe does to
and then we draw
some then we draw some freaky feets for
LOL he under
[Music]
the
[Music]
[Music]
shaking down and inspecting
[Music]
Fe people probably like it because it's
one's feet
[Music]
kind of looks
pinky or is that just
me I see some fnny bun
[Music]
and we can
those this a big
feet he has he has a big feet he has a
big feet that's not grally
great the maybe this needs to be
um
this maybe that's
better okay what's food in
Swedish
[Music]
maybe even knows what is I don't I don't
know how
well you have to know
Swedish someone wrote me a message on
Discord let me okay I see I
[Music]
know
no boot there we go I know you're aing
Kitty
that's not
Swedish
sameed
[Music]
now it's what I see you give me my
clothes back this is unacceptable and
now in this and now I'm even more
adorable is that what you say and even
K this is
unacceptable I can't be like this not in
public need I need that cardboard box oh
there we go this is
accept but I think one thing that would
be unacceptable was that I was first
thinking
about H what if you redeem that redeem
when wearing the swimsuit that the
underwear would not be there but then
maybe maybe
not you ad so need to compensate
somewhere else what what does that
mean Mega
blushing yeah that would be very
blushing that would be
that wouldn't that wouldn't be
accept that would be very awkward I
think bit telling you think of this I
think it's
bit I think it's speit telling that I
couldn't even read that
sentence but then I got it after a
second read soon
[Music]
no I was just thinking about you
[Music]
J and what you possibly want to see out
of
[Music]
the I'm not a naughty
[Music]
P I'm not
[Music]
nauy don't I
[Music]
am something
[Music]
something it it might
work
wait
[Music]
look a silly
bunny yeah how was it I
[Music]
like yeah like that
[Music]
did I do everything no I nothing
[Music]
ears I'm
actually and this this whole thing
actually Tak 3
hours
[Music]
think
I feels
like with the accuracy I'm trying to
apply this
is not the real online
[Music]
art
[Music]
I ha
[Music]
it
so
and also this is the
uh
second or the third
one who who whoa what H what's happening
the whole part is going on
here or or
even oh it says that
you it's not actually giving the same
information here
but thank you for
donating gifting I guess it's called
it's a donation two subs
to one to R hopefully shows up
here like oh what's going on here I have
P
OT and want to astral na'vi as's been
here before hopefully sh up to and then
it start says that you
also then it says that you started monst
subscription I think that message is
wrong I think that message is supposed
to
say gave to gift Subs so it's somewhere
got
confused it got to two correct but not
what the two stands
for
and that's kind of
interesting cuz I'm not exactly sure why
it triggered that one that
message
and there we go
I just hit the two gift sub option maybe
that's yeah it's
like I mean yeah you gave the two
Community it's just that I must have set
it to give the wrong
message uh it's it's it's quick and easy
to check I'll do it
later I do wanted to say the right
[Music]
thing
there you go I hope I got every line
now now I didn't do the
cheeks pink CHS pink chicks where is to
GI sub option oh are you looking for it
isn't it
just gift
Subs you got to go to the top where gift
Subs are or something you press give
subs and then yeah although I don't see
up yeah yeah yeah
yeah so you expand the delete board for
gifts you press the big give uh
subscription and then you go to the
bottom where you can type your custom
value which for some reason is Max 100
why don't they want you to give even
more and you can also choose a
theme or no theme and you choose up
to for some reason they have a
limit maybe they don't want to go
over the equ equivalent of
1,000
[Music]
dollar uh to give two you need to input
custom value
yeah I assume he I mean unless on mobile
they have other options
that could be
aing and now the present bad is pink oh
that's what you wanted a pink present
bag congratulations for having a pink
present
bag let why
[Music]
asking enough
enough everyone is curious about what's
going
[Music]
on is kind of large that's the smaller
this smaller top I can make it smaller
I need to do the outline too he said he
didn't it didn't matter to him
like or that's probably incorrect
phrasing more like I could do like
whatever oh yeah there's
this I could do whatever design I
[Music]
want what
I did want to give him an option to if
there was a particular design he wanted
to go
[Music]
for
I I do one
here would that be too close I wouldn't
look
good
[Music]
that
works the option I get are 1 2 5 10 25
50 so they added a two but they removed
a 100 oh they change 20 to
25 okay okay so
[Music]
they okay I see what they did they have
halfed they half all all the values from
five but they have rounded it down so
five becomes two and half cost two every
other beond number beyond that is half
for some
reason uh but of
[Music]
course o obligatory comment that that it
shouldn't be gifted through the app
anyway
[Music]
you what the door that
is Google or Apple depending which
version you're
using is taking a cut of the money
[Music]
sming
anyway so they are potentially presuming
people on phone use less money well yeah
I mean there the prices are higher on
phone because as mentioned Apple and
Google do make a cut of the price so
they have added that cut onto the
price so twitch and and streamer are
still getting the same amount of money
it's just that the person paying through
mobile has to pay
more which if it wasn't a
different app would actually be legal SW
I but I think it's okay because it's an
app and separate separate service
it's like going to a different store and
making a purchase that therefore they
allowed to have a different price while
the app pays through Google Play Store
which adds to the subs which is quite
expensive isn't it considering the price
of the
subs you do what you want of course of
course no
not even if you use a browser to no no
if you if you pay if you pay through the
browser it paying through the browser
instead
found own browser now and the browser
you can access yourone which is of
course the option you have to go through
if you're going to do a very large if
you if you're this person who gives like
10 Subs use the browser because you're
saving like $10 according to Oran here
see oh unless you meant a dollar to both
of Subs that would be
$5 which
is whole sub
itself I
think I
[Music]
don't but that would require l in which
I for password and then I had to reset
it and then they sent notification to my
email that I had end
well
[Music]
yeah the feel
should too
big
[Music]
well you could have it Sav the
password in the
browser I mean I mean you do as you want
that
course but for small quanties of CAS how
extra doll through the app isn't a big
deal but if I keep more than five time
through the
pro
bit
Yeah you as you
like I do appreciate it
regardless
but doing like for those who have the
option having because you can
[Music]
do and we appreciate your cute face let
me hide my face now
but there we go I think I got
now I still didn't do the
chat
[Music]
I like that I
think so yes for those who have the
option uh for split
screen on the de phone
you
can put the Twitch app in split
screen with it at the top that puts the
video uh at top of screen and only the
and it will only display the video and
then on the space below you can add the
browser
and then you add the URL which is
applies to every streamer which is
twitch.tv/ pop
out slash the twitch name slash chat I
think that's the
URL
twitch.tv/ poop out my word SL pon pon
bon in this case SL chat that brings up
only the chat which does involve gifts
Subs that's part and bit
[Music]
donations that's all part of
it you can and then you can access the a
cheaper
price and you can also and also if if
the browser chat is just more convenient
General you can also
just it is slightly inconvenient that
you have to set up like that
but after setting it up it's
fine and yeah and then you get the
browser functions whatever those are
yeah for one for example a redeem cool
down it will actually show you the cool
down
Tim
there we go I think that's
that I think I'm happy with
that the floor is getting very
transparent let's move it
up
oh all right that's fine anyway so let's
do the proper line
art
this p
p where's the lineup button that's
lineup
[Music]
button
okay
okay the lines are looking
great I'm happying so but when I do this
it's going to look
terrible I have a feeling it's going to
be
terrible
oh yeah and then I need to make sure I
so incredibly zoomed in and I can just
Boop and it raes it perfectly for
me keep pressing the wrong
buttons
oh yeah there comes the here comes
the yeah that's not like how it's dra
here it's dra very very
th but me drawing
th
I can't try
see this is the
part
oh that was
Button ass
wait such languish wait what did I
say
probably say s with One
S and not two
Aces completely different
word Peach did not sound like I mean
they are pronounced exactly the same so
how are able to tell them about if I may
ask
if I may defend
myself I
you
s s there you
go that's well no not the not how you
spell the name of the but head
pets patting the
head and deserves
[Music]
pings so jokes about
sping maybe I
shouldn't I made some funny jokes before
there we go
beautiful
[Music]
beautiful the looking at other streamers
some are very very close
[Music]
like when they when they
draw like
drawing I feel like that's a bit too
close it's hard to draw long lines when
you're that
[Music]
close and then people show like what are
you drawing I can't see I just see a few
lines
I don't see what they're supposed to
[Music]
resemble yeah let do that I want longer
may I
want like that
that's that's what I'm looking
[Music]
for yeah I won't I will not be able to
finish the line art today but I tomorrow
as
[Music]
well that I will finish
[Music]
tomorrow it's going to
be the third artwork I will
publish should have
[Music]
[Music]
Okay so
[Music]
[Music]
nice go
go draw draw
draw a beautiful
bell and I didn't know what I'm talking
about
[Music]
now there's this point
here I could do
[Music]
that
[Music]
pointy and this
is
[Music]
here
yeah maybe I should
draw other characters like
bian
bup and Bianca
again I wonder what they will do
Sheila Sheila the
pH who dress you can playing in my
mon I know you mean
ch
but the is she the
[Music]
[Music]
phone
okay these two
fine
and but I'm not happy without this one
turn
[Music]
out maybe maybe that's
fine maybe that's fine I keep forgetting
that I was
supposed it's
fine that's the but I I forgot that I I
said I was going
to
and to get her the whole P because she's
a bit too white
here is that good
with maybe that's better let's go with
that I
can squish this together there we
go I think that's a better
nice for p
p not too
wide not too
narrow REM the dresses
no I know was fun of Bianca what do
Bianca will show P Pon how to use magic
P will try and accidentally remove their
dresses Okay that's is an interesting
idea actually
and I think it might
be
oh
that and I think it might be a popular
idea
too
the pon pon could like try to do the
magic completely on way of what was H
what just happened well Bianca is very
aware of what's just happened and this
surprise did happen or at at least it
will be a wind
spell I technically I could do
[Music]
both like the same same artwork same POS
is just one wind spell which is slightly
more sa
work
the
[Music]
the par in
here maybe I should break that
down artwork
IDE and then H to sh up a f fun fire
ball
[Music]
what that seems a bit
[Music]
drastic
don't you
think and what will happen to Hunter
when he's survival I
[Music]
think is
just
P tries to remove Hunter out of the
pictures so on to P
herself it's because of all of his BS
without the plot coupons that spy need
and spy plays a game first that
means
yeah maybe that's
fair and how he how he doomed Avalar and
that didn't even feel any form
of remorse
regret
um um another
word
see I feel sorry for what you did nope
nothing me I understand it like
punishing or blaming Hunter is not going
to solve the issue but I'm I'm seeing
more of the Hunter's perspective here
than the other perspective like he
didn't take any responsibility
second actually doing right I said one
of these stuff
[Music]
before worst character he's worst money
bags
[Music]
and Dr pom pom p with pom
poms
is obvious
J well it's not like Pon pom's name was
based on pom pom like it's like a
corrupted version of P pom and if I not
wrong a corrupt is a term in
linguistics see it's not like pon pon is
an actual corrupt pom
[Music]
pom that would be
something
[Music]
okay
so I don't know how much long I should
go
maybe I can finish line up
[Music]
for
[Music]
oh
[Music]
pom
pom
[Music]
it's really really into
it I wish I could this be like this
maybe I should have a chili outfit and
pom poms and have photo of myself doing
this pom pon with pom
poms
[Music]
like like a long this long and that
wasn't
rot just pressing the same buttons for
rotating scaling that's not how it
works
oh could have really deleted that
[Music]
E I think that's
[Music]
good
[Music]
oh
[Music]
yeah
boom it's a p p
[Music]
that's nice
[Music]
line two
[Music]
one
[Music]
[Music]
um
[Music]
[Music]
if you like M
SK after this I just
[Music]
right
[Music]
sometimes it's just nice
to have like
depress without actually speaking
anything
[Music]
and
then this spot is likely going
to be hit by those
incorrect s
claims which which does release like
very
quickly I do still feel in all that
they're not doing anything
[Music]
about like it's incorrectly playing it
and I know
[Music]
it
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
way licking Pon P's face pon pon licking
Pon P's face and pon pon being blush
[Music]
blush but yeah I do like your idea
hopefully people aren't thinking that's
Stu
idea
isn't too
um
naughty that's that should be one of t
on the
way
[Music]
[Music]
yeah that that
found
[Music]
much yeah it's 20 minutes over

are afraid that they are writing too
much in chat don't be afraid of w too
much in chat there were many many times
today where nothing was written in chat
for a moment of
time um
so feel free to write anything you feel
like talking about and even if
yeah just feel like it's um and don't
feel like you're trying to interrupt any
any conversation going on because I try
to complete whatever I'm talking about
