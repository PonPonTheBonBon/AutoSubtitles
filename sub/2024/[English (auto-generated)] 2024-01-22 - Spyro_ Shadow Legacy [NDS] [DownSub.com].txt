[Music]
fast person keeps updating the sign

minutes and also how can you have a sign
that says will back back in 15 minutes

open it up again because if it decided
that oh I didn't didn't get any internet
it couldn't wasn't
able what if it like fails once it
decided it will never succeed

try I just approved it okay proving to
mixed up second
time

[Music]
so yeah but
yeah return to the temple Val is a large
of new skills you can learn two new
skills each time you level up you talk
to all of the ERS and choose your skills
[Music]
wisely yeah can I level up my my wallet
size wait a
[Music]
minute okay let's let's go back
to the
Temple oh I can't do it too far away
from okay I guess I'll have to wait how
am I supposed
[Music]
to am I supposed to go
back wait yeah yeah I can't I can't go
back I just do
this then I go there which is a step
closer what's broken mix upep is broken
they won't be
any no outfit changing
redeems can I reach it
now no I can get one step
closing sply any
here sure oh hello
Amber I'm not sure if this is actually
closer
because the gate is just
there those hyp emotes were sent one you
level up yeah I assume
so
perfect turn around opponent
but
there
you 15 XP okay see let's see
what what powerups I should pick this
time crit
strike gen
magic attack magic defend magic charge
okay the the old Dragon had something
you wanted to teach
me Sensei wish to see you
exactly you have learned much my
Apprentice I have determined that you
are now strong enough in a mind to learn
my most Advanced Techniques you think
you are ready to learn the first Chi
attack I guess so first and hold X+ a to
focus your T once you got a t press
right right now that was in great
okay there we go did you see the way of
energy car from your wings I remembered
this technique myself many years ago
this is the power of G this power comes
from the heart you know okay so you you
invented holding down
to right okay now I'm out of
[Music]
Mana that
sound H do I want to learn more magic um
but more do you have horn toss
interesting he to swipe
like te punch
interesting wish it was
a there was I wish there was an easy way
to know what I could learn and you know
what things do for that CH Wings Ah
that's what's that one
is
this fail Hammer War
Jab
maybe I
should that someone has an Unstoppable
to charge that's sounds
interesting okay it should be running
again this time it's very low quality
though but at least it should be running
again
I it should be
working oh yeah I was I'm supposed to
learn
something couldn't I just like I don't
know as I said I don't want to use safe
States
because I could just pick
something
give a clear in mind of everything your
spells will be much more powerful
remember that you'll be able to move
large object and teleport greater
distances I think I think
I need
that because that allows me to teleport
easier instead of having to be
close yeah now I can reach all of these
places which is much more
convenient
St changes aren't working today p p
forgot to do her laund Chang it's
probably that that's probably why I
couldn't log in to mix it up because it
couldn't establish a connection for some
reason I don't know why it needs to be
so picky about the
like considering what kind of service it
is I don't see why it needs to
be need a Flawless internet connection
yeah now now I can log
in yeah B basically it needs a Flawless
internet connection to work which makes
no sense to
me wa makes no it's easier to stream on
Twitch than it is to log in on mix it
just makes no
sense oh yeah I was supposed to
[Music]
teleport
so working but now should be
[Music]
working still it means that I still
don't
[Music]
have doesn't
that oh because I'm
[Music]
down
I'm down below but I couldn't
see yeah this game really need to
remake so try Redeeming
the not that one well that's started at
the same time
okay
yes that one no that's the bad
one it's it's a secret you're not
supposed to know oh these bers are very
weak yeah I need I need probably need
the supercharge
thing maybe that should be a thing I
should upgrade
[Music]
key yeah I need to stop open the chest
because I don't get anything from
it I should find the
uh it's frozen what's
Frozen refresh the Stream
[Music]
here we
go I don't know you canot you canot have
to gry them first and as you hit them
they move this way
okay
rabbit what was that rabbit oops rabbit
died
whoops the bunny
pooped it was an evil bunny disappeared
in a roof of dark
smoke
okay now is one of those again one
of I just jump over
this yeah you got that Shield wait I got
a need them need
I
need so I need to kill
enemies
okay so I can't kill it because I need I
need to kill enemies to kill
it
enemies oh there we go W what kind of
creep creatures on
those oh you ATT to PR it can't because
it don't
[Music]
way I need to kill this big
one it gives me the
requir
PE there we
go yes tap tap tap b it wow do you know
more Scout no well I didn't get that
either because a dialogue
started so now I need to kill another
enemy
anyway yet another enemy I need to kill
let's try
this
ow okay that was stupid I sold it
whoa
tap tap tap dash dash dash tap tap tap I
[Music]
mean that's the whole discussion
is I know stop interrupting me I could
say
[Music]
name
[Music]
okay there you
go I pause when iable this okay
so wow died
immediately
okay
okay okay this is annoying okay so what
what I have to
do is let's cat SC play what I have to
do is is kill this
one get the
[Music]
MP
teleport out of this area that wasn't
the correct
shape do a low level area so I can kill
the dark creatures I'll use
the I'll use the the attack when you
give me some to restore my yes I will go
and then I will go and kill some enemies
in this area
is it yeah if remake please make it so
all the information is available on one
screen it's
like uh the dual screen like like or
like the dual screen would allow for
more information to be available at the
same time and without having by still
having all the game playay on one screen
but but the second screen has four
different pages so I mean sure this is a
detail View and and you can view the map
but the thing is I have to switch
between these two because here's my
items I can use and here are the stats
if they just put this like stats I don't
know Above All the items like HP and MP
XP and level could almost be added I
didn't have to switch between those two
pages I could switch to this page if I
want to see like the levels for this
different attributes that's
fine but
[Music]
yeah that's my current issue with this
game and if it wasn't like a second
screen touch screen uh even if I had to
switch
Pages H there would be
like button to press the switch screen
instead I don't know this might be wrong
area let's go somewhere
else anyway hi here to do the L thing or
the L thing if you want
Hello
welcoming welcome to big cute little
funny
place like where are all the enemies I
mean I guess I did kill them so they are
but I kind of need to farm some enemies
why are they not why are the enemies in
in like the good world in the real world
but not in the evil
World hi know l king yes CU some good l
[Music]
king okay let's
see well I guess there's nothing
[Music]
there not a single enemy on this whole
area
really
[Music]
really yeah I think this is next just
with the game there's no way to farm
MP HP easy to F
MP very hard to find me like there's not
a single enemy anywhere and the enemies
that that are that do exist I can't kill
because I need to use oh
finally finally enemies that actually
can't
kill kind of a huge oversight I would
say like why why do they exist in this
town but no no
else a where they
are
still running low on health too
so house
too oh there we
go one more crab and
[Music]
house and I have half
MP y my new mattress is out for delivery
no more bread Springs stin into my back
how can
even such a
bed sounds very
uncomfortable although I would argue
that having a bed with springs in in the
mattress or a mattress with springs in
it in the first place it sounds very
uncomfortable okay was that all of the
enemies now there are no more
[Music]
enemies maybe there are some enemies in
here
I I oh yes there
[Music]
are like man oh
[Music]
[Music]
nice nothing
nothing
oh
hello logically I should be able to bash
my head into that enemy until it dies
[Music]
but but it probably take forever anyway
I change screen again and was the next
thing this keeps changing with screen
on anyway let's go back to that
place
how much MP does that cost
to
20
[Music]
anyway going let's see if I can do this
now come here come
here don't know how close all of you
need to
be
oh wait
what okay now now you're
broken much MP of that one Quest use and
oh what nothing maybe it doesn't cost
any
mpts wow do you know more
SC that is s s for
spal okay so
you good Demon react
[Music]
oh look it's switch screen
again come on G stop doing
[Music]
this
perfect
tap wow do you know Morse codes okay
actually risky you know that was Morse
codes for
no it wasn't it was a morse code for S I
still have an argument that you cannot
tap a morse code H but that's a
different thing well Aran what are you
doing I thought somebody might hear me
and realize I was a trapped you know I
mean you were just in a cage you know
what what's so special about a cage you
can see through it and you can hear uh
through it you know so you can just
speak I guess the intelligence of bit is
very very low
[Music]
I mean everyone else has realized this
but if that didn't work I was going to
try and use one of those sticks as a
polar Vault so I could just jump over
all those creepy crawling I think being
trapped in a cage was you B this sh but
I didn't have to because you saved me
wow I got to tip my head to your partner
if you happen to find my friends around
can you do the same for them no no
yes of course most them are up in the
cliffs you'll have to use the tools to
get up
there let's build some stairs nice moves
but there's still four more people to
rescue nice
moves okay
um
wow there we
go here I am
Francisco
goodbye or
key don't spend 10 HP for that
key is this one a shield or
something oh wow you're strong I knew

attack but that stood too close to the
thing I didn't even face it or
anything oh it Shield is back wow
okay wow it takes long hair to do the CH
attack then come on game why do you have
to
do why do you have to be so
[Music]
annoying oh how does that not cause any
flin the attack is so strong that can
break through the
shields but it does not cause them to
[Music]
fling with this
[Music]
game and they can of but they do have
a
okay I thought it

Traverse just jump up

add
potation
this
[Music]
oo like you can't die random
spots like there's solid grounds anding
everywhere and then nope you died
[Music]
it looks cold looks
[Music]
toy maybe a bit on the chil side
but

[Music]
okay
wow

game when it comes to
that how did they even manage again like

stop
oh
interesting nice
stom what but there's a platform there
can't even deter what the death
[Music]
is
yeah still burning
[Music]
[Music]
good we everything
bad why need s stingo
gems oh there's a lot of room I mean
[Music]
gems that's a lot of rooms D

castle an
in no no
key no
[Music]
key the way you have to press to ex oh
you're
back yep you have to flame it to even I
don't get
it I don't get
[Music]
it see I need a
key where's my unlock spell two of them
okay I need to note down
this that there
is and what is that
the ice castle what
was sign okay there you go
you see I'm trying to enter the
door oh
hello wait why is
my another
one or or is this sign in
a h what do you call it an
angle why does there always have to be
an enemy attacking
me H third thing I just call it
that because it was a
thir stop
next
[Music]
wow okay I guess this do contain keys
anyway was the be's home and then a Pur
bur bur that yeah
that's that's the story of the be in the
[Music]
house the story of the b in
the in the house
[Music]
yeah I was I was supposed to go back to
the castle thing Temple
thing got I had
upgrades
fell down
wow wow bar having an imp LIF anyway
let's go back to the
temple hey birth is great you're burning
the best de that's the appropriate way
okay what do you have would you like me
to teach you some more about you what
what should I learn what do I
mean will what what do I
need I don't think I
need any of the
like Dragon I don't think that would
actually help
me Unstoppable supercharges however
something I think could
work yeah that allow me to
Traverse but I might be able to destroy
the be bonus
attack man I don't think I need stronger
attacks deflect not deflect any time now
at
least s windshield this I'm not wait
what there oh yeah stronger attacks I I
mean sure it's convenient to have strong
attacks but doesn't Flames thrower
now and I don't know how to do
eyes but let's let's go with the super
charge then Unstoppable super
charge I find that if I keep my toes Cur
like why how much then I can smash stuff
up with my horn start a secret have
[Music]
F come on smash you up
no and general magic might be a good
it's not like anyone can maybe he can te
because last time he told what what did
I learn about from him last
time yeah yeah it was F reach that
was it looked like it just got stopped
by the wall yeah it's for being
Unstoppable it sure got stopped
okay let's see oh you will be
able what's the place again know you
will be the master of General magic who
can move the largest objects and
transport yourself to the end of the
world I mean that is convenient but how
do you move things wait didn't have a
spell for
moving yeah this
one right
right I think I think these two spells
can help
me um but again I don't have
any there I need to go
and the Unstoppable Char got stop by the
wor I need to go and farm some
more
MP be
going stop
me I feel like the the name the name
might be an
exaggeration at least two charges gets
rid of them which is very convenient to
be
[Music]
fair
he's running so fast that he's squishing
the light in front of him
turning it's the the bikini
Dragon I didn't know it
just being unstable you still can't
attack these
enemies
[Music]
I Le it go through them so guess it
technically seem
unable
[Music]
techn get stuff by
base

runs through the whole world
breaking maxp

problem the ground here is much harder
than it is in other parts of the tunnel

something we could use to make the
digging easier probably fantastic I mean
using magic we're going to be able to
dig some great tunnels now and we'll
give you any bu treasure we find after
hiding some of it you know to yourself
but like we never found
that I be your way of saying
things oh no I can't kill this one this

rabbit but I wouldn't say like white
rabbits are the best rabbits I mean oh a
pink Dragon pink Dragon a pink bunny can
look really cute too the greatest
was that the shadow realm it was the
shadow realm I thought it was just a
mess yes completely messed up all the
voices now but whatever yes of course we
know about the shadow realm all magical
creatures know about the shadow realm
old magic it's bad very bad we were
lucky to escap with all
eyes and all magic it's gone it's gone
no not completely
some of it gone that's what the shadow
does takes magic away away
away we must get back to our work and
secure our defenses clearly we have
enemies enemies
enemies could it be red oh open in the
shadow realm I thought it was the
fairies it was the fairies not red oh
wow the fairies you can always trust the
fairies Now app the paries are just
messing everything up am I going to
trust this people trust that it was the
paries I remember red he was always a
bad apple bad
B you be mean too if everyone hated you

everyone at Le like red no friends for
red boohoo red who
cares we must get back to our spells and
quickly dark man is all around us we
must protect ourselves
yes the voices are shifted there
something a little different so yes
first The Cauldron yes the cauldrons

the speech pattern has completely change
too now they speaking incomplete
sentences so we can boiler Brew while we
were on the shadow realm the fires blew
out P can you help us heat the cauldron

sense oh

then then I need that
[Music]
key that's not the
one I don't have a key I don't have a

[Music]
sense oh more mushrooms
oh
face
he pretty sure it's been more than 50
minutes for for that story
yeah that's what what happens when you
put up a sign that only
gives um
okay so what I think it is is that
depending on which screen you
are day for direction goes different
places
well I'm good seeing that the egg didn't
break off this by Rush he a dragon egg
they don't
break well I'm
stuck F didn't help
good see I can out of
[Music]
here Beau that was not the voice I used
for
before okay I think I explored every
area
now
yeah game
done that was might
[Music]
be there we
go that's how is too small for you if
only you could have make go Chef smaller
only someone else was
smaller I can do something with this one
what happens if SP
stand
move okay that that made no sense but
sure it just disappeared off oh wait
wait why is that why is that
covered St
[Music]
jump and now I'm up here nice double jum
SPID I love it when you double
jump
come on come on I'm not sure what I'm
supposed
like what's like what
what this one is like this so I can I
love the double jump in this
game and then I can face back what's it
like the
point what's the
point
yeah now here but
what's I love the double jumping in this
game I press the button twice and I see
[Music]
happens
yeah yeah I I don't get it like what's
the point there's nothing
here so many of these are empty in both
now it's
[Music]
B oh yeah I still
need more
[Music]
eggs
they need more
eggs why are there two of those Shadow
run portals in there they're
because H you need to be in Shadow to
even access the
uh wait how much MP do I
have
I even use it on
these H because yeah you need a shadow
RM to be able to pass through those
wooden
bows then you can use the upper one to
face back into the
normal
yeah I don't know what I'm supposed to
do the only thing I know I have to do
[Music]
is hello wber do you still love me I'll
get in trouble if I visit Cliff town but
not bad it is so
dreamy I don't know how to do a
sque
but Ember we were supposed to be
together and also Cliff to sounds
dangerous
yeah so what I need to
do
is
I think I
think doesn't matter how what you
try yep another empty
[Applause]
roomes
it does
something I also can just jump up like
that too I used
[Music]
[Music]
to and I don't see
anything
yeah you didn't do need that one to get
access to this one but what you are
supposed to do on that one I
knew okay I don't need this
version and then there is also the boss
bell which it's an
impost an
impos this game is so confusing AR kind
Moonlight
welcome welcome welcome
hi I'm playing spal Shadow
Legacy and I
am I'm beit confused the game is a bit
confusing big struggle is that the game
gave me a lot of [ __ ] before I realiz
couldn't pick up more than one
key but now I need the keys the keys
that have the
spawn would be cheating if I just gave
myself a
key two keys because two keys despawn
was it more than two
keys
w
[Music]
i nice double jump
Spyro there we
go
yeah I'm
just I'm just running
around
D that was flame
[Music]
this
spy is great at single double jumping
yeah like if you have a double jump
functioning
game why don't make sure it's actually
working perfectly crazy
idea I mean
honestly did expect you to
like not open chests containing Keys
when you had a key that you should know
that stuff like I could have many Morey
I could have two more keys and key St
doesn't seem to
generate and at this moment I need a key
and I wasted two keys
on
um well I still would have was used the
keys on all the chest because I I
currently listed the six chests I need
keys
for which one of those are one that
progresses a quest but that still
means and I would not have a key now for
this Quest
[Music]
anyway yeah and like these dragon is
going to help
me more
experence this Dragon
said Don't expect me to teach you
anything until you're more experienced
wait you see someone El
[Music]
F
there
this lamp is supposed to hang from the
ceiling but you w there's no sense of
deaths in this
game yeah I'm going of stuck in a
moment
[Music]
like maybe I should like search online
and see what other people have commented
on
regarding you
know the lack of
keys maybe just some aspect of the game
I have I like for
oh oh I found
something
key I found the
key wow I can open one of the six
chest
wow
[Music]
progress SP broke his skeleton

at the same time
anyway well trying to find stuff about
keys but no luck however I know a place
you'll eventually Miss see
problem is I need like I
[Music]

Stu there we
go that's the problem with
this it h seem like they're trying to
control the past in using keys but you
can also just waste like the spawn
like
key so
like yeah I'm very confused about the
key works this
[Music]
King I'll keep it a secret oh yeah I
mean if it's something I don't know
about in the future yeah as long as I
can progress it
me
[Music]
fantastic success safe at last now no
one will ever be able to hurt us over
again I don't know why you sound like
that the mini dragons will always keep
us safe 400

place which are creatures that we love

possible and like if you don't have a I
made a mistake oh yeah another friend

secretly made yeah oh yeah that that one
I've heard before which was believable
yeah that's that's the sad part is
that the secret parties no yeah e the I
think that's the one I heard the most
about and
it's yeah it it makes sense
[Music]
uh H what are these things eh

[Music]
okay oh wait you have eyes in your back

SP I know how to do
[Music]
that
St Mission oh I mean it's not too much
of a sty Mission it's pretty easy to

I don't remember exactly where I was
supposed to go to turn this sp there you
go now
[Music]
invisible now I'm free now I can run all
over the place without getting detected
I know it was a
platform
turn yeah now they are
disappearing yes
[Music]
that's see I got 29,99 XP oh
no give me the dragons they're
gone well now what we will do
hide beautiful Master spidal you have
done it this world a great service my
brothers may not agree but those
creatures were a threats to the magic
iCal balance so your kind has long sort
to preserve so now we have left them
free so they can wreck havoc around the
all here I believe this item will be
used to you in your travels is it a key
that never
breaks what did I
get
wait where did
the crystal of intelligence
go
[Music]
what why does that one
disappear and what did I get I think I
got an egg sound like the
egg why it couldn't just tell me it was
an egg
know all plans are coming together which
plans releasing drag which you were
against so
confused I'm so confused
oh the those Crystal we out after a
while I don't
know Dy Crystal I mean they they like
sparkly and this one is
[Music]
like I guess one out I don't
know I don't know it's sh in this
[Music]
SP okay I'm done
[Music]
here oh oh yes and so the Wizard's
dtic what what kind of sentence is that
and so the Wizards the the magic power
power is weakened but not destroyed
return to this world and dragon realm
slowly return to his original states
thanks to
Spyro gameway but someone was plotting
to undo all of Spyro's hard
work I found some disturbing information
that I have to share with you wait who's
speaking what voice should I
use use using my magic I search for the
cause of the calamity
now look what I found the machine that
opened the shadow run it's some kind of
magnifier that projects a magic spell
over the entire
world it gets
worse there's a new machine one that
speaker starting and more powerful oh
it's boss and this one doesn't just open
doors to the shadow realm it pulls
people back into it and keeps them there
[Music]
forever okay more cut
scene
no done cut
scenes when are you coming back out to
lunch back in 15 minutes how I yeah but
you kind
of have to write a date for when you
left came back or whatever
okay the big for Bears only I'm not a
bear I guess I'm not allowed in that how
too small for you if only you could make
yourself
smaller mini Dragon oh is that what
dragon is
for okay should I go back to
like disappeared everything yeah but
you're not
beautiful this idea about it's been 2
half hours already sign when are you
coming back from lunch
uh someone forgot about it that they
were on a Lun or
something or
something okay what if I like here's an
idea what if I go to the dragon ERS
again tell them about to
do someone has released the mini
dragons there's nothing left
there can I
it's a shame it doesn't deal damage for
every
hit because that like 10 hits like 350
damage and I have like 70 HP probably
got pulled into the shadow realm for
Lynch wait Lynch you me
lunch yeah maybe I should
check this game so
Weir help help the Min dragon
I'm sorry I don't think we already I
don't know want to learn I have problems
with the minia
dragons with the mega
dragons with the mil
dragons micro
dragons Nano dragons wait door was
closed
yeah they got like 50 HP or something
maybe they get that's get 50 XP
experience points because they have 50
HP maybe experience tells me how much
HP had a weaker
attack wow another empty no maybe
there's something
here no not oh
wait oh now I actually got
power wait what did what power did I use
last time I could do
[Music]
that what power I
used because I could deal with one of
those last time as one life oh lightning
yes that was easier
though lightning you use
yeah I used
lightning
worthless
yeah I do think they
have XP represents the amount of HP they
have because three times 15 is fortifier
we did not die until I came in
another now I
think yes I see remember I wanted to Pi
Dragon up here but he
went he went to the dragon Doo
[Music]
[Music]
so only I oh you smashed right into the
pill so I guess that's only for
athetic it didn't unlock
anything B down the
[Music]
house
oh how
work a few places with things
but
yeah I just love how it was a double
jump there is
something it did show a shadow but still
can land on
it ones
okay here
[Music]
again maybe maybe I can do something
more for these some is going to be heing
for my lawyer that I can guarantee say
where's the M oh yeah I was supposed to
find the m
[Music]
i I knew you could do it I expect
nothing lies from a purple
dragon I judge people based on the color
of
anyway
[Music]
ke
[Music]
[Music]
what they are still burning oh yeah the
misses she fell into the
water oh yeah yeah now I
remember man I lose everything I don't
know I need the Prof professional health
or something listen remember what I said
about the ERS most them okay but that
red was bad news and he was the
strongest Elder of
all but SPID defeated
him even though he used the power of Mex
all I'm saying say is that you never
[Music]
know so you're saying that I shouldn't
trust you because you might get mad with
[Music]
[Music]
power oh no someone turn this off
again
that say switch screen
but not exactly sure how I'm supposed to
like what's the point
[Music]
is I want to take The Boat
Boat Boat there's that one boat maybe
that's how progress
level B what was this
again
now this store closed for inventory
Still
Still
St now the guy gets insurance money from
her
oh I
[Music]
see wow it sure has some
range
level up
[Music]
L I didn't know I was that close to
leveling
up but apparently I was 4,
4,550 for level light what power should
I go for
[Music]
now
and should be the tough one level up
outfit wa what's the level up outfit no
that's not a level up outfit that's the
lack of outfit it has similarities in
the sentence level up outfit lack of but
you
know Allah there is nothing more I can
teach you you know everything I do know
that's
fancy or crying out loud how many moves
to you need you I've already taught you
everything I
know
well maybe I shouldn't learn more cheesy
Stuff or
something maybe I need more
power I don't know if I need more well I
probably need
more I need maybe
it's
don't have Shield any Shield I still
don't have
eyes you want to learn how to use your
wings a sh maybe maybe that's what I'm
looking for he had a lot more to teach
last
time yeah I can't teach you need to
level up so I can teach you more I level
up oh I don't have anything to teach
you
s maybe I should go with Shield press
the L button to Shield yourself with
your wings this works for projectiles
and other attacks like swords okay
that's what I
need so yes what did that
[Music]
sound okay iron shield is even stronger
want to learn it and um I
probably no I think I need another
G don't think I need a strongest shield
for
now let's see I think you see there are
many levels attack magic are you ready
to improve your attack magic
abilities
wait it's very useful I promise maybe
later you want to master this power what
do you mean by I can teue to deflect
magical attacks okay that seems
good attack with deflect mic

like
flamethrower oh oh yeah wait it was you
no wait you horn
[Music]
toss oh T punch let's try let's
see up

projects a narrow wave of energy at your
opponent dealing okay so it's just an
attack I'm wasting my mp I wish I could
just regenerate MP at some
point

keep going first time seeing this game
before it looks great it's I think
they've done like visually well with the

original
so they don't have that much performance
to
use
[Music]
but but still it's not
bad when is playing on a
small
see
gaml wise could have been better but it
works I was hanging uh how I was hanging
by the pond and then all of a sudden
bam
okay sh
around oh Dragon wait who did you think
you were talking to before want to
thanks for saing me I thought you were
Hunter oh you must have bad vision
great pork spider you've saved all the
people in this area now return to real

hunting don't be I'll take care of you
I'll take care of everybody I'm in
charged I'm a Char hey what's the big
deal I'm the king son and your friends
with the dragon too so so This calamity
scene was C brought on by Magic and
nothing is Magic like a purple dragon
can't get any more magical net oh you
are got kidding me prob I had nothing to
do with this I expected you to defend
here which is why I'm putting both of
you into custody until we get to the

RM here we go what that's right you're
both under a sof to chil with you
they capture Hunter they actually put
SPID spider willingly went along with

powerful oh play cut
scene can stay prison though yeah he can
stay there and she doesn't mind that
spider got out me she wasn't like along
