I hope this works like I I didn't know
how to best do this
layout CU
well the uh the2 screens and
everything but I hope it
works so are you ready to win
everything should be right contr
yeah I need to plug in the controller as
well a slightly late
start it's
okay I think we should go with English
that sounds like a good
idea if I if someone has an idea for how
to do the layout
I'm I'm
open there is a slight overlap but I
hope that's
okay although I do notice
that this one is too far there we go now
it's
beautiful
music this
is um yeah as far as I told this this is
supposed to be the sequel
to
um a her's tale and that part of the
music was from a her's tale so let's
start a new game start all over from the
beginning like never happened in a far
away time there was a Land of
Magic a young dragon champion of an a
ancient people slumbered away wait
ancient people are we have people
now good is was a good thing to have
that small text in case you can't read
the
script oh I have to touch the screen to
continue can't press a it was a time of
peace and
prosperity and yet a dark and powerful
force gathers its
strength and that was it
anyway that's this is
the and that's I been told it's the only
dialogue from SP through the whole game
like was told last time when I try to
run this I think it's run fine now
so no
more oh yeah you you don't press a to
continue press why for some reason you
still can ask
why Spyro hey Spyro come on come on out
out have you locked yourself in oh man
that's funny you key must be somewhere
in your room yeah I think that's how
locking yourself in works and maybe spy
want some
privacy okay well I'm going to head
downstairs while you figure things out
yeah I think SPID knows how
to unlock it
away if he locked it he can unlock it I
think this last
time I know you press X
actually this book is called and Along
Came ripto read
it I need to X for
everything after saving the dragon
families from nasty nor c spell SP
thought he earned a little vacation of
course but there is no rest for the
heroes no matter how small they are
shattering spes and his friend spark
stream dreams of rest and relaxation was
ripto and a little guy like a
hero but contrary to Spyro this dinosaur
riding a
troublemaker
despised his small
stature maybe that's why riding a din
are they dinosaurs maybe they are and he
took it out on the World to prove that
his wrath was much bigger and
scarier than his modest size suggested
this is the the wrath of
ripto frustrated short tempered and
spiteful ripto pull off deception and
trouble defeating a much larger creature
poor Spyro he only wanted a vacation
instead he received a pain in the
Flames it all came out well in the end
as Spire de feed te and his henchman in
a to Bell oh
spoilers
anyway here's the
key the items don't move
along like they are no separate
layer this flame
button okay now I can open it this is
jump button this is flamee
button there's no run button and here's
our
door it says unlock but if you press
unlock it just disappear you come to
anything this is the Run

game goes a bit slow even though it runs
full speed it does feel a bit
slow when not came to that other

Dragon just sleeping every
night omnus clouds appeared above the
land they crackled with magic signaling
the approaching
threat a deafening crack a bolt of
energy rushed towards
Earth right for
spal a wave of AR magic pulsed across
the land pushing everyone into a strange
Dimension known as The Shadow
realm it has the game suddenly became
very
weird oh oh we
creatures
Spyro Spyro it's Thomas I'm speaking to
you
telepathically listen carefully I can
help you but you must do what I say
first your attacks are useless against
these creatures you must run from
[Music]
them I had a see on that I'll make your
way to the portal outside Dragon Village
it it will bring you to the
do understand and SP
[Music]
responses unless that was Sparks but I
don't
know find the portal summer Northwest of
you North Wa and West okay oh it might
be here where I tried to go before I
really don't like how you can get stuck
on the geometry despite being a 2d
game oh the dress is
[Music]
back okay this that's a very tricky jump
to
do who that's a cre May
one but I don't see where else to go
wait what's what does this button
do
interesting B jump but what's the
rest uh let's see the map oh that was a
very useful map but I am moving
Northwest so I
[Music]
guess let's H sneak past this one and
try W it has projectile
okay I'm not sure
where that looks like a whole ocean oh
here
[Music]
something
oh you're
captured
spy
what that didn't mean anything to
me oh go just scase they are they creepy
and
weird maybe I wasn't supposed to go
here he oh really I need lose 10 HP from
that
yeah and SPID is Dead game over time to
restart the whole now I don't know maybe
I wasn't supposed to go there I don't
know I'm still exploring I
guess
[Music]
oh something is missing that was there
before because there was another
area
nice you get stuck SPID run we creatures
running around this area cuz there was
another area oh yeah here it was North
not North West I was
fooled someone lied to me did the big
bad spill their
magical staff Justice
again you tell
me quickly Spyro I need your help I was
working on my house when it happened now
I'm
trapped I'm Northwest of you I don't
trust your directions Northwest means
North unless the whole map is rotated
some use your flame breast to remove
this beam that's on me it's okay it
won't hurt
me not as much as having this Beam on
me I will go
north can't because there's an invisible
wall here see see he's was North nor
Northwest he was lying to me again he
has no sense of direction you know what
I'm going to leave you there cuz you
stupid and don't know what directions
[Music]
are okay you know
what I will burn that log for
you oh wait you're
here but I'm trying to flame
it oh there we go are you happy
now come on it's
gone flame breast no flame
breast nice work your breast is pretty
handy too bad I lost my flame Powers
long ago wait when did
that is that why the dragons aren't
fighting back against n because none of
them knows how to do the flame rate now
let's go to the temple where will be
safe follow me wait do you mean the doo
is it the temple now
stand in front of me
[Music]
nothing
ah Dragon Temple okay but where's so
this is not the doger maybe the
do maybe the Dodger and Temple are two
different
things well what's happening FL
I know but I decided to share my
misheard content maybe I said flame
breast saying that sound is a bit tricky
due to me funny funny we should be safe
here are you all right the other Elders
are still trapped I'm going to get them
with what your flame breath don't AR you
I know how did you know as
arguing
okay that was pretty quick blasted okay
F I couldn't help them I thought I could
but then what did I
say okay spider listen closely we don't
have much time someone has cast a spell
on Dragon Realms the dragon ERS are
trapped and they can't get out I thought
I would be able to help them Escape yeah
you already told me that but I'm too
weak the attack the Calamity is affec me
to SP you have to go back in there and
free the ERS your magical energy is
strong there is no one else who can do
this this is a dangerous thing I'm
asking you to do those moners could have
destroyed you before that's why I'm
going to give you something to protect
yourself with normally I would never
give this to an untrained Dragon but
this is
a not enough space left to right this
sentence desate situation I
mean I'm going to criticize the text in
this this is the Shadow
Stone okay that is our Shadow Stone I
guess it's an 's
ulet emerald you see much like the one
I'm wearing I can't see oh Oh you mean
that one this is a powerful
tool guys p p blanket oh you want my
blanket cover up in the blanket and
sleep it will sharpen and focus your
magic H oh yes there is much magic in
here now quickly we haven't got much
time this is a dimension portal they are
old and haven't been used for many
thousands of years but they just laying
around all over the place but they are
located all over the world okay all over
the world not over the
place it will allow you to pass between
or world and the shadow realm oh is that
what SP Sparks meant with real world
stand on it and use the amulet oh should
I use it
now oh press the x button to face into
the shadow realm okay
face
whoo you did it notice you can't see me
in the Shad around that's because I'm
still in the real world in fact I cannot
see you either but I can sense you by
using my magic while you are in the shut
your fire breath will have no effect nor
can you open doors or
chest however you will find that you can
walk and you can
touch do and
chest no
wait H I feel it's a bit unfair how you
R not at
all oh how you really not at all dressed
I like the locals much better Oh you
mean like what is like my dress didn't
fall along to the shadow realm or
something I mean technically if if if if
SP traveled but nothing else technically
close will travel either oh good
back through some doors as well as other
wait wait what can we go back when you
are ready start on the portal and press
the X to button to return to the real
world
okay I'm
back very good Spyro now listen the
first person you must save is
Ragnar I guess
but you mustn't call him by his real
name he hates that you must call him
Sensei
because no I refuse to of course you
haven't heard of him he wants to be left
alone so he doesn't even want to be
refer to all at all and he's very
private and very old and he's very
cranky but that can't be helped yeah he
he needs to adjust his attitude I think
he will help you free the other dragons
you can find his house on the other side
of the Dragon Cave the Cave entrance
is to north of the temple where we are
now wait
what you mean the temple where we are
okay the temple we are at and it's north
and by North for you it's not North
North it's somewhere else because you
don't have any sense of
direction so I guess it's Northeast in
that case I they have to add 45°
something so so this direction is north
what did that do I touched it it's going
to
explode I can charge them too nice
nice wait it changed my lower
screen much better oh I need to press
exit I'm pressing the wrong
buttons
[Music]

eh Carry On Through the cave and out to
the other side wait if I go through the
mouse opening of the Dragon into the
cave and then come out the other side

that
this kind of felt like feel I guess it
was at
theum Dragon Dodger okay so I'm actually
going to the Dodger okay also the name
of the sign is
nothing I do still feel like the name
tag should be above the text and it
should have four four lines of
text look Japanese text what does it say

that battle it was so
amazing oh here's another
one

secret you saved all you you're all
saved from the shadow Realms thanks to
SP we all owe him all
gratitude now we need to remember what
voices i g on what's happened Thomas
yeah what's the big
deal why talking about Titan Thomas had
nothing oh sure well if it wasn't him
then it was one of you because only an
elder would be able to have this kind of
magic dragons are not the only magical
creatur in this world
Titan whatever which one of you pull
this nobody here would do such a thing
well there's red I knew it I knew it was
an elder behind all of this you an ex
Elder it's been a long time since the
red sat in
Ito that's red is a rat think or such
language think but that even supposed to
mean Tian you're a real Jer know that
yeah how dare you insult
red you try to destroy the
world I don't hate me because because
I'm brilliant now I'm hating you for
your attitude and you don't seem to be
brilliant I don't know if red is behind
it but this is powerful
magic why would someone do this I don't
know but where any of us able to use all
magical abilities in
[Music]
there there's something about the child
real it drains its prisoners of all of
their magical abilities
a spell like this could undo was all we
still be trapped in there if it wasn't
the SP I mean you can't even res your
fire in the real world I mean you were
trapped under one
log one me the wood of wooden ho sing
you defeated by wood so you should speak
you have strong Magic Dragon I not on
that all the theing villagers are still
trapped in the shadow realm oh know we
must do do something of course so what
should we do are any of us strong enough
to go back into the sh
realm oh it must be Spyro if not you
who yes even I admit Spyro is the Dragon
for the
job of course you can do it you have the
natural ability to fight dark magic and
your power continue to grow for some
reason no that's not that's not what he
said for some reason the cannot hold you
it's quite amazing
really everyone is trapped and not just
our friends in Dragon R Hunter the
professor Bianca everyone from in Avalar
which is a lot of characters and the
forgot the
world which is even more characters all
right are we going to see some
[Music]
FS Beyond
aora red from a hair yes this is
supposed toly continuation after ha G
you cannot leave the dragon RS yet a
powerful creature is frozen over in the
Northwest Port which is the
Northport with the Sea Dragon Frozen in
it once you are strong enough to defeat
this creature Bard that ship to travel
to Avalar and save your
friends F chance of that happening P
then what the more you not do the
stronger your magic will be so you must
try to save everyone you can I'll be
able to communicate with you
telepathically Spyro you won't be
alone let's not mention
Sparks but it's up to you once again I'm
afraid but this time your normal Dragon
Powers once suffice you will have to
develop your new powers and your magic
to defeat this
[Music]
evil this painting shows how magical
energy flows through maybe Spirit
speaking
strong in some places weak in others
magic runs deep in dragons like you and
me yeah he's supposed to be still
[Music]
speaking
[Music]
okay D some creatures can't control
magic they they
look they have seen things things they
wish they haven't seen oh Hunter can
stay there yeah let's not this game and
some can NE control nor sense it yeah
these people are just stupid silly silly
people like money bags and Hunter kind
of based on
them this spell has disrupted the
magical balance of a world Spyro Spyro
spy someone or something is draining
magic out of all of us through the
shadow realm as you can see the Magic's
flowing to the Forgotten world whoever
is behind this must be
there I don't know who it is but it may
very well be read last I heard he was
imprison in the professor's laboratory
in Avalar in
AAR he could have escaped though I hope
I'm wrong spy of red was once a friend
of
mine Spyro if you're tired of walking
everywhere I'll teach you something
useful El used these teleport paths to
move all around the world that's not
what Bianca said but okay I mean she
didn't say how it's going to be but she
said like you you can teleport from any
point to any point was kind of like how
it came
across two money PES oh no I mean it was
one of money bags in in spal
adventure I'll teach you some new magic
so you can to here's how trace the
symbol shown
below okay I can do
that you got it you can teleport
yourself to any active teleport pad
within range to turn on a p just touch

skills per level up
oh sorry
spiral you need to gain more experience

you teaching me what sorry SP you can
you can learn only two new skills each
time you level up more but she speaking
to me like oh you want
ch
I haven't like chose I mean even if you
count the double jump as one ability

strong talents as you do to beat the air
with wings only you have and to feel the
magic as only you can that's the
poem good to know you're not blind are
yeah I'm not blind also this was the
first game to have Sparks talk in
complete sentences I thought that
was a hero's
[Music]
tale I thought that was a hero's T
actually didn't he speak full sentences
in ENT fly as well well I mean
he spoke complete sentences in the year
of the
[Music]
dragon so this this was part from the
[Music]
oh oh my gosh I was going crazy in
there and you you got so strong EXA
oh almost the exact same
[Music]
dialog heat Amber sheep

talk how do I talk there we go oh spal
can you help me out my mom's ground me
if I don't find sinks stuff octopus okay
oh thank you so much I have no idea
where it could be I swear it was here
one that oh sh everything
happened yes how do
I oh wow you totally found it you really
save my bacon spiral sorry I spend my
allowance and running where I give you
some gems wait a second I found this the
other day when I was swimming in the
pond looks like it's worth
something oh I might me dingi Crystal of
elusiveness reduces melee damage taken
are these like equipped or something I
don't
know especially if there's only five of
them or
something yes
but not voice acting wise I'm not
exactly sure what you
mean the first game that Sparks talk
full sentences in actual sent say was
uh let's
see the Year of the
Dragon because
uh this dialogue was actually written
[Music]
out and
then in the and then it works the same
in the ha T now
in in enter dragonfly and then in um a
he's taale Sparks
spoke full sentences with actual voice
acted
[Music]
dialogue I mean like Legend of SP
Sparks second yeah that would be a ha
but he
doesn't CU why would say that this game
is the first time have spark spark
doesn't even
speak in this
game I'm not supposed to break this cuz
I can't pick up the
key Fox doesn't even have always acting
[Music]
here what I miss
anything okay let's see oh here's
another one
[Music]
boohoo SP lost my egg you are a horrible
monster what will people say is there
anything you can do I have six eggs what
you find for me thank you I don't know
where it is could you where I don't know
where it could have gone I mean it was
right here in my
house oh W that it's just I'll just put
that somewhere safe hey SPID if you
can't find any more dragon eggs like s
of them I could teach you a special
trick my grandmother taught
me you knew a little something about
magic
wink well I
guess guess I gave away that
then yes Sparks is the yes Sparks in the
original Spar man voice is just buzzing
yes okay it's okay okay see if I
understand correctly okay the first time
SP Sparks was buzzing with actual
dialogue it was the he of the Dragon
first time Sparks was not buzzing but
spoke
was actually spoke proper herble
dialogue was a hero's tale but he still
ises some buzzing in that first game
where he didn't do buzzing at all that
would be Legend of spider New
Beginning this game is
not but I'm still not sure why you say
this H this game either way because this
wasn't have dialogue this doesn't even
have spoken dialogue in the first place
so anyway I'm just confused that's
that's that's just it and if you if you
can like text Ti like subtitled dialogue
with Sparks that was a uh a year after
Dragon yeah I didn't see a hero stand
yeah yeah but this wait when is this
game come
out I wonder this game come out what's
the question 2005 pretty pretty old game
actually H St of SP are new
B came com came out a year after this
game okay still
still
still this game does not have voice
acting so for Sparks regardless
so so even if I hear tail didn't do
spoken actual nonb spoken dialogue
Legend of spy would still be the first
game not this anyway moving
on man I'm glad to see you some how the
Calamity caused some stuff to collapse
and Rubble is blocking everybody's way
now old one horn is making me c but I
can't budge the Rocks an
in think you can take care of him for me
sure I appreciate it big time one horn
says I got to clear them if I do he he's
going to give me something wor my while
I mean worth our
while okay but like how do I remove them
well
[Music]
fyy this St gu isn't working how are we
supposed to go back and forth to Dragon
[Music]
Shores if the gate won't work stupid
Shadow rims messed everything up while
not everybody has a Shadow Stone and can
move between Dimensions Mr Smarty purple
pants some of us just have to work like
nor
I can't fix this gate by myself I need
you to throw the power switches that are
located all over town that should fix
the problem what do you
say good well go on then come back here
once you flip all the
switches I think there's like one
[Music]
left W gate appears to be stuck shot
only Mur can move it now would you level
up
next talk to me I
can so was that all for you didn't tell
me how many it was I'm just going to
assume it's for one in each
Corner that's the CH this G keep the
dragon safe you
know you got the Relic relics are
ancient magic light that was scattered
across the
land sists no one knows exactly where
they came from but the Markus on the
door match the relics perfectly they
must be a sort of key to open a fortress

as much as he loved it catching sight of
his own ugly
monkey but it's Ni no didn't seem to be
aware of SP or something know and being
a greedy nor nasty frequently scared
himself silly as he clamed his own
reflection in the dragon family's shiny
jewels that he Co coveted and frequently
gazed upon driven by his greed and dumri
meanness nasty devised a magic spell a
wicked jealous awful one to end all
Dragon happiness once and for all for
his foul Parish in nast's world he Froze
all the dragons in Crystal and changed
their beautiful jewels in the nor Tes

because I was already holding a key and
I couldn't uh use the key because uh I
couldn't go back to the place to use the
key
at and those test containers keys does
not respawn so those keys are lost
forever a great game design
is like it's not that I think no maybe
it's that chest like I don't know which
chest this is could be that chest it
could be this chest it probably is this
just because it's is the one that's
first in the yes it was Fountain T if
didn't oh another
key that different if go back and pick
it
up okay let's see what this one contains
then Crystal of
intelligence that's something I
need pure Crystal of intelligence
increases Max
MP yeah it seems to be applied
immediately let me guess I'm going to
find
another Crystal and then I'm not going
to be able to pick it up cuz I don't
have enough space but where am I
supposed to drop these things often to
free up
[Music]
space roxies star for you hydrate that
sounds
good and post the
check bonus stretching now I'm sitting
up straight I think yeah there's not
another one
here but I'm out of
keys you dropped
no
roxies do you know that's
rude okay I need to
save uh Northeast in
there double jump
cave is there a name for this
[Music]
place yeah but is the thing for this
place that was the
[Music]
question no I want to see if there was
name for it oh well
whatever
uh
drag
and then there's like
the jump island dragon
to and to the east just
like places where I
have tests to
unlock h i going to place I need to play
the ANS now stargazing oh no don't case
on the stars but we get to have all
Euphoria for 30 seconds yeah I gu so
let's un let's add place while um I just
go turn this
Talis I grind some XP
maybe I
have 1,
14,48 so I
just yeah
yeah yeah the XP gr is very slow oh it
died but it was no longer on screen so
it actually complete
the it's kind of
interesting now wait
[Music]
I who wanted to tell was is
you say talk but I apparently can't talk
you found the Talisman wonderful you say
it was in the cave I knew it I knew it
here let me plug it into the fountain
fantastic it still works as good as ever
oh Spyro are been meaning to give you
this it's been in my family for a long
time I thought you could use it at least
more than I
can XP oh I got exactly 15,000 XP now is
not amazing that do mean I must have
exactly 12,000 for or is it a XP cap or
[Music]
something
was this just me or
[Music]
is polygons on the Wings by flying weird
like stretch maybe that see
me
did I do every Mission now X has been in
his family for a long time
yes what a nice
house somebody's going to be hearing
from my loal that I can guarantee you
say where's the
M oh should have find it wait where is
he he was that that
place now I actually don't know where
she's to be
[Music]
honest can go and
check
[Music]
what and also you see that meter in top
left which shows the
HP uh it has a lot of space it could
expand is that the maximum
HP I can eventually
use I need one butterfly there we go can
it expand all the way to the right
that's a lot of XP that's a lot of HP
you can
have how can you run up here water
without there quick sand
guess and there's one here too I really
did that okay she's no longer here she
walked
away
[Music]
that's a quick way of doing
it stupid
tree yeah I actually don't know what she
is she
[Music]
disappeared
[Music]
come ah the way you drone this game is
so
[Music]
stupid might work like that in Noti
every enemy killed you get a butterfly
from it would be so hard to run after
life maybe I can go in here again and
see what's going on she fell into the
water and all like far she doesn't
respond
okay too
fire most people don't
[Music]
respond okay let's
see they not like in privacy these doors
are unlocked and uh anyone can open
these
[Music]
so there
that I've been also going for 3
hours I should go back to the
dragonis starting the wor
[Music]
K if I kill
[Music]
like 50 crabs that should probably give
me me L up 50 crab
down watch this
[Music]
nice get me up there oh hello
am oh my gosh I was going crazy in there
you are crazy Amber Ry love with
[Music]
spirro I I really wish I could see it I
keep ke at same time also what's
this also what did my where did my
crystal of intelligence
go power Shadow
[Music]
looseness
[Music]
interesting Village West Gate how do I
open do I use my
[Music]
manic
I don't
know I don't
know but I guess I guess this
is he a dragon I guess this is where the
continuation is
then I should probably just go and speak
to
the dragon yes to see if
they before continue you
know to be
[Music]
sure maybe I get an ability that's
just you can unlock everything with your
spell
magic lock picking
magic maybe that's part of the general
magic he can teach
[Music]
do he is Rams in
[Music]
nothing I'm sorry I don't think you
ready to learn more about General magic
right now you should gain more
experience first I am trying I'm trying
I'm trying I'm
trying
it should be an unlock spell yeah the
moving spell the unlock
spell you see what you do is
you I might to draw one this not exactly
like that but but it could be a spell
that is a
square could be a spell that is a circle
it does go up all the way in that meter
so it's possible that that's the
spell wait that's the same
thingy that
way no I wanted
to or cross yeah so I think I think
those are spells because the if I if I
dra dra Draw Something in
valid okay if I draw something um inv
valid it goes up that
far yeah so regardless of what I
draw I'm goes that low but two vertical
lines it doesn't let go but
Circle
uh
V go Max what was else suppos I did try
square but no that wasn't valid was one
more try to draw
something it went
Max
um yeah good thing this at this at least
of three shapes so I don't have to
remember
them if I go back to this game after
playing after not playing it for a week
that's going to be very tricky
remembering every spell in that
case but yeah I said it's been one week
it's it's
been 3 hours more
speci
sh going XP 50 see that means I can get
th XP by
King These are nice am
XP these
are which is kind so six of those are
like one
[Music]
mission
it's not like a th XP left to the next
level anyway so yeah oh yeah yeah yeah
it was here let's take a look or should
we wait should we take a
look so spy left the Dragon World Behind
and headed for points
unknown somewhere ahead his friends were
trapped in the shadow real waiting for
him to save them not sure everything
this way
but red was out there too awaiting for
SP he spoilers and he was not
alone okay if you say so
game okay there we go that's the
exciting continuation of the game so
apparently it is
red that's how creative they
were so I hope it was
entertaining more
tomorrow they will definitely I don't
wish you should have some background
instead of just being
black that was fun even though I was
late is it normally not fun if you're
late I don't
know I mean I do have the bunny
backround I mean I don't need the but at
the same time it feels off not having
like a background I just two random
squares with
pictures these are red like at as an
integer and this is
why but I'm trying to say is that
what
oh I didn't mean to have you go there
there you so what I'm saying is I could
make it large like this but now it's not
an inch share
scale that makes
sense um but then
also uh what is this supposed to go here
is going to just be well there we go H
so this way it's an integer scale which
means Pixel
Perfect and also space for the small
second
scen
H now we can't see the bottom screen
yeah I know oh Stars quick CLS yeah I
don't know why it's do that as well game
is wa the streaming service is
wa giggle giggle yeah it's not awkward
when that happens for a split moment but
oops didn't you see
that
oops so bunny stpy so we have a few
friends to
join we
could go to some friendly
faces what B is playing hard space ship
[Music]
breaker for example he's a funny fell
isn't
he otherwise we can we it believe but
haven't
R it water b in a way so maybe I should
spread out the ra and e and r a few
different
people you know sounds fair otherwise I
guess ignore than
R the same person over and over
again that's also an option also fanor
playing Power you want to f one yeah
because I do still feel like I rated B
cor like last water bunny was in
September and cor was in
November so it's been quite a while
since I R water unless I did it
somewhere in these empty spaces I forgot
to releast to I read it last known time
was in September
