chat
and and I hope it can be fun I'm I'm
more fun if you write
something I have something to go
on oh all the
hearts yeah post all the hearts he
have every single one of them I see a
fell bunny I in my support Jo are you a
bunny too that's that's us my question
I'm
I'm I'm
not my my question I think that I do
that when it's more obvious when it's a
first
thing I am oh
nice
beautiful so what is your
what
like what's the what's the what's the
correct question here but but yeah I
should probably ask more like if people
have like a first zonea or
something so what is your person
like my my person is the one on screen
of
course that might have been very
obvious let's see where was the sliding
we'll see if I can find
it hydrate oh FY pop oh wow bunny
creatures yes there's a lot of bunny oh
well this is a dragon but there's a lot
of bunny creatures here we got a Brie
fluff we got P Pon do I have any other
bunny
here
I have been watching other bunny
streamers who has shown up on the chat
before that fell down through the
platform my bunny for son is a blue
haired brown spot to white bun wait
white bunny a blue hair h i first was
seeing like a blue
body as in blue hair that way but see me
like blue hair on the top of the head
yeah because my Persona doesn't really
have hair top of the
head no when you touch the wall
there also if you knock this wall you
have apparently don't take
damage
yay
so
yes and upon that that I think that that
looks like a cute design sounds like a
cute design I me I Haven SE I haven't
seen the design but it does sound like
a I I don't know if
I considered adding anything like spots
or
anything apparently P Pon is just plain
white and I say it's it's basically sow
yeah here gous kute thank
you that's very kind of you oh that was
close and
uh I do you like to
see I know a lot of other people do like
oh you can join my disc and then you can
post your a picture of your
okay I don't know it just feels awkward
saying
that can if you want
to no actually no I don't say that
usually and I I just forear saying
it so that's the yeah I think the I
think oops speaking of sliding and
sliding down I think this oh things are
popping in out I think the slide is over
here let
see my
singy I don't see it as a Persona
personally maybe that's just me or let
me be the that's that's all of the it's
a purple bunny plushy with a USB plugin
back inspired by a bunch of those
internet Interactive Kids toys h I'm
not or I've
seen I think I can imagine what it is
but I'm not exactly
sure I don't I can't remember any any
such I probably haven't looked at much
toys anyway I well I no now it's not
like I'm try to keep up with
that okay this is slide I've checked how
I should complete this slide and it's
very silly so you
just and there's the be I was so yeah
what you have to do is be quicker than a
b which you are by
default so just continue down the
slide and then and
whoop you don't need to have high speed
but the faster you reach the
bottom
bottom the
uh the uh more time do you have to
complete the race and I'm racing as a b
but those beehives also make be noises
which makes it sound like the be is
catching up to me when it
isn't
so just going down
[Music]
here and for anyone else who's playing
this on PlayStation 2 this is how you
solve
it you just do the race normal but it's
at the bottom where the actual issue
lies they might have fixed it apparently
considering most people only have any
issue on this on PlayStation 2 they seem
to have fixed it on the KQ
version because the
zone is
misplaced people basically say just walk
around the are and press triangle all
over the
place but what you have to do is go
somewhere over
[Music]
here somewhere but do keep pressing the
button just it's the trigger point is
somewhere
[Music]
here problem is I can't find it
exactly there it is I found it and and
yeah as you can see the game is kind of
broking why is the voice so quiet anyway
back to uh you could record custom
messages that they repeat back to you oh
do you have like a text of voice text of
speech I think it's called yeah like
that or other stuff like stuff like you
funky we [ __ ] why you would use them for
online
K yeah this I don't know I know what
this
stuff
unlocked P liing for slime in swimsuit
slime this is
honey oh no I do not want to do this
again this was a Tor no it wasn't but
just finding that point is so ridiculous
then you have to be that far from him to
get him to talk yes there there's a very
tiny area you have to stand to trigger
it it's completely misplaced and it's
[Music]
tiny honey slime sweet yeah you do you
want to see like just like you you want
to see like pon pon in a swimsuit
sliding down and the Honey slide
is is that is that what you want to
see oh yeah his Sports Fair no
noan not now is
this this is not the time for
that yes
now
we have nice people here I mean I'd like
to see p in Honey slime
girl well may maybe I should take like
commissions
for
drawings I draw
like wa yeah you you see yeah I do have
on Dem art one p the bon bon that's kind
of my art sty it will improve over time
the more I draw of
course but yeah if you want to see
something like that with pon pon doing
something I guess I guess I
could charge for it and
so and the people need a
show is that how hello I'm p and this is
what I look
like I've been here but maybe it's wait
why do why do the be spawn in
disappear
whoa you see that
right what's going
on I don't know what's going
on this is
what happens destroy
this do I still stop doing the spawning
thing it just spawn Stone drops
down yeah when are you going
to take another one there we go I guess
they do stop spawning I because cuz what
I was thinking was there are beast that
are
standing that are
[Music]
standing what's an you know yeah there
now you eat it you can basically
stand cuz these rocks are well they are
affected by
gravity by the looks of it
but but very very very very very
slightly
so but yeah if I remember correct
correctly I
think rocks are huge like the size of
spy's head if not
bigger de be they just buying morning
hello Rocket Man morning at well 13 your
time
[Music]
um what apparently you can't kill them
in rocks in their face that's
interesting okay so I apparently missed
some gems so should I talk to you no
you're not going to give gems I already
got
all I got all
the dragon flies it's
the gems I'm
missing but yeah what the freak
is those rocks are the size of Bowers
a rock at the size of a
boulder how big is Spyro I think someone
tried to make him I'm pretty sure Spyro
doesn't have an official height
just pon pon is I'd say officially 180
cm from standing up to the top of the
head I say that's the official height
because gu that's my height I'm 20
I'm much taller than the average okay
let me go back to level backwards and
see
if I can see any gems I'm missing quite
a few gems
so may maybe I see it more from a
different
perspective and maybe I see an area I'm
not been to like there is this area but
I've been here
so there's this area but I've been here
too or even if it not been there there
was nothing there how much Gems did I
miss
again Rockside Boulders don't you mean
Boulders no no no no Rock siiz
bould H Mars I'm missing 2 26 that's a
lot of them I'm freeze it's freezing
today going to drop down to - 8°
toight that is
cold that is
subzero
that is
freezing
literally small Boulder size of a large
Boulder blocking
Road
yes I think someone said that what they
actually meant to write
was wasn't it the other way large bould
size of a small B
[Music]
Boulder no wasn't it the boulder size no
no I I don't remember maybe it was
that because I think someone said that
what they meant to write write was not
Boulder but
car so a large bould the size of a small
car but then ended up as a large Boulder
size of a small Boulder but
um but that's only true if it actually
was large B size was more small
Bower and
I'm been up
here but yeah that's extra life that's
not I was going to say there's a green
gem now
but I can pick it up because that give
Sparks full
health okay now there's nothing here
firefli there are fir
fls oh there's Collision
here
neat which just
badly
anyway back here so I
[Music]
can make sure I'm not missing
anything so yes there's this
area this
[Music]
area I wait was this something no it
wasn't uh I've been have been bored
lately cuz I have been wanting to do
more character mods for bomb Rush cyber
funk I think for some reason think feel
like I recognize that but I don't know
who to add that someone hasn't already
done that I like and I am able to find
the model
for I was going to say pon pon but there
is no
model well not not publicly relased
yet they oh well I mean there is there
is this Spyro
the claded pon pon
model which is based on
[Music]
spider but then I'm going at some
point finish the H crash 4
mod of pon pon
whoopsy I think I've explored this area
too
yep it's empty
here wow why why did the stalk
hurt that makes no
sense the
stalk why can I only fly flame one of
them so
that am I going the right way
looks like
it yeah
this
dead spks need to cheer his food and
just one B
fight also when you die every enemy you
kill so far remains
dead doing a quarried would look really
weird I assume so
he hurt his neck on his St oh yeah
that's that's why I see
understandable
go come
on okay this one has longer
range
this one definitely have longer range
to then one slid off electricity just
[Music]
by it's just an
upgrade yeah I don't see any other the
gems oh wait there's something
there
I see
something I see
gems I think I found the final
gem by the way bom Rush
C I'm not going to judge missing
hey he a Jad s yeah yeah yeah I saw some
play that yes now I know now I'm sure
which game it is it's by in game where
you skate around on skateboards roller
blades or BMX bikes doing tricks and
vanizing St with
graffiti banding yeah then yeah then I
know which game it
is and then yeah cage bed would be
really
[Music]
weird but I guess that's a game for me
to mod on name to
then
wait oh I see this is back here how much
do I have now I'm missing a
red okay I think I need to use Sparks
now
oh give me a short moment
it's not set to the part
mode okay
now unlock okay let's go where Sparks is
pointing start ging
Point okay you know what let's go
back don't gaze at the
stars Pon is so used to being with her
she doesn't notice when her vanishes
would you
notice if it just vanished within like
like nothing I said I really need I
really need a sound effect that place I
have a sound effect that I was thinking
of of putting
[Music]
for
um good thing for just regular outfit
changes but I need to find a way to make
it actually play properly
like I could make uh mix it up just play
the sound but I wouldn't play on
stream and if I just add mixed up to
play on stream then it would also play
the noise for when I receive any message
which I don't want to play on
stream wait
what oh that's why I can't find that gem
what kind of gem placement is
that oh no I can't find The Gem that is
halfway into the pillar
oh
I mean my armor play way so much I I
mean fair enough I know someone took my
arm
yeah you being pun oh it's embedded in
the
door you so you didn't see it until I
it okay Cloud
n that was the wrong button 14
chems
I think it saves when I switch
level yeah look it
saves look
6965 if I pick up two green I have 69 69
97% fraud what fraud what do you
mean what do you mean Ro man please
explain I need this EXP
expained oh
yeah but I think I walked around this
level a lot trying to find the missing
gems so
may so maybe I should be
using Sparks
already ow that took get
wide why didn't I die
immediately and I think I walked through
this level like five times and even went
backwards I might use Sparks right
away would you say that
fire yeah you don't want me to spin
around this map for like 5 years off the
stream Sparks ver near gem behind
me
what
interesting that's not what I expected
to be
but uh bom Rush cyber Frank there we go
caus modeling is pretty easy all you
need is to name a few bones specific
names and put the models into un project
there has the script that lets you
adjust a few things before exporting to
un F I've been
doing a modding for Spyro oh
it's is up on this
SC okay in that case unless I can yeah
there's a there's a thing
here
which is in unreal and it's kind of the
same
thing specific Char specific skeleton
which specific bone names
and
yeah there they
are okay if I stand here come on
game there we go you can see the sparkle
they look so dull they don't have Max
but if I move just a bit back here now
they're not on screen anymore and don't
they sparkle
anymore how am I supposed to
know that there are gems on top of that
thing they don't Sparkle that was a
thing they did in the first Spire game
you could see something sparkl in the
distance because the sparkling was not
tied to the 3D model but in this game it
is you could say this game is
unfinished okay how do I get up
there that's the big question
now I think I could maybe just fly over
what's the worst thing that can
happen oh I got one
for B brush for BC you don't need the
whole skeleton to use the exact name
same name scheme you just need to have
seven bones to have specific name okay
okay okay yeah I mean if you want to
replace which I did replacing Spyro
with uh pon
pon it's using the exact same skeleton I
could use as custom my own skeleton but
in that case I had to replace every
single animation file as well and
there's a lot of
them h
l un as you want their hands to properly
animate in which case it's a lot of Tri
trial and error unless you use the
skeleton from the
game one must feel easier to just use a
skeleton from the
game where are we supposed to a it must
be from up
there
okay let's get up high
let's get Let's get
high wait where's the where's my
Transportation do I have to go around
everything uh I go around everything
then what happens if I F oh hydrate F to
check I think it's easier to just
Jesus I think that's what I would do in
that case I would probably take an
existing character from the game which
is how I made SP to Pon
p t a lot of
work if I were to add pon pon to the
game also very
fair which is also how I started working
on nice flying spire
H pon pon for crash I took Coco and did
a lot of
modifications so it's basically Coco's
face cuz I'm not going to change I can't
really do much changing to the face
because that would break out of
animations that doesn't
work
yeah you well you actually when you in
when you start
flaming the flame is actually an object
or something created in that spot and as
you run forward if you flame and then
run forward the flame does not follow
along with you you might say that well
that makes perfect sense but that's not
how it been in previous spy
games in the the Spy Games on
PlayStation one the flame is attached to
the model so when you
start
running after flaming you run forward
with the
flame and
uh that is a way
to deal with giant enemies you flame and
then
charge therefore you're pushing your
flame forward rather
quickly hopefully they not jems on that
one how how am I supposed to know
that where am I supposed to
go I need to check if there's chems on
that thing
too okay there are no gems on that
thing at least I confirmed
it
uh spamy
hi also helps with making the m fit into
the game style wise yeah yeah I do want
to mimic the style of the game I'm
adding
the so the style of pon pon for Spyro is
not looking the
same as the pon pon 4 crash
4 I do want to to work with the game
too uh P are you saying that the game
makers
can't change their game mechanics I'm
wait which game mechanics I'm saying
that they while they are allowed to
change game mechanics they should not
change it so it becomes
worse it is like a [ __ ] Cloud spire's
Temple from here the dragon I guess
that's a way
to describe
it
what temples what's what's what's
temples in un of the
Dragon cloud
temples I don't remember Cloud temples
from Year of the
Dragon I couldn't
mind I couldn't mind what it was called
it is worse though yeah it's worse words
yeah it's Cloud
spires he i s I missed the whole level
in the game what kind of level is this
oh it doesn't exist oh what
okay
well okay and then I
need to wait where is this
going okay well
what okay there's a transportation
here so there's that platform I need to
go
to okay let's go even
[Music]
higher I knew it was Cloud
something this game is is an AI
generated here to Dragon oh
my
that's what's going on
[Music]
here what is going
on game is
weird oh there was an invisible wall
there no
a yes if I were to fail had to go
because they're not giving me
many check
points no
continue
h
why can't they exist a checkpoint close
to the end of the
LEL and why does there have to be
invisible
walls and also if you touch a wall you
lose your
flight which is probably the worst part
of the whole and what's with this this
level this
tunnel is
weird
and he can't run through
it doorway apparently so I have to go
around we saw the flying onto walls and
kind
of glitching around that
way in the previous game so they really
didn't want you to be able to do that so
as soon as you touch a wall you crash
land as soon as you touch a wall you
can't start flying
this game
[Music]
over
[Music]
800 level complete not sure why that one
is playing slowly as
well monkey
Monastery wrong
button um at least when we're not
defending the puffy Palace wait puffy
Palace slow Plan F yeah puffy plan
play
pal what's
that wait what's that the level I
explained
now it's with clown n wait was or is
the puffy Palace aart in the level oh
wait yeah yeah you're defending the
puffy Palace
against the
attacking
beds now I remember after looking at
that so the yet is just going to stand
up there and for some reason the
subtitles oh there's one of them look
bunnies little cute
bunnies wait no that was the wrong
button anyway just another green hope
it's not
red there you
go now we can look at the bunny look at
the bunny
stand the
bunny can do
this anyway let's move
on so somewhere there's like a two
should I really go around look for it
should use the jum finder
again I'm listening to my own
ear bunnies I do like
bunnies well I guess you'll be like
that how does this Shield protect you
you're not have it in front of
you watch the
bunnies electrocut
bunnies here we
go I'm a bunny attacking bunnies but I'm
the bunny so it's
okay how does that not work eat
bubbles you better Sab rabbit
sabits sabits
zabit
samit the music in this level is very
weird yeah I'm not going to find a like
a a little gem somewhere sometimes I
just try to
look you can actually PL these
bubbles considering how close I need to
get to even see
gems oh yeah was that the game mechanic
we're talking about
before
yeah
I'd say change things so you can't see
gems from or like sparkling from a
distance can't see the spark from a
distance that's a terrible
change can
shes we got some very
interesting pink trunk
yeah
yeah I think we should ask SP Sparks now
unless someone has some objectives
against
that just making sure if someone's like
no no no you should try to find
it okay now I need to two bunnies one
two oh wait you're you're
friendly hi object of course you do
rocket
man but I object against your
objection I can't listen to you Rocket
Man
good thing those don't sound nice that
wouldn't be that
good unless it's
like attached to at the bottom of this
portal again but no not this
time how dare you go against me do you
know who I am you're Rocket Man
I know who you
are I know where you
live am I allowed to say
that
exactly so how saw you there question my
commands
yeah I mean I haven't used Sparks yet
but I really feel like doing it because
yeah I'm not getting anywhere with
this oh W can this is very cold place
now I am even
colder and I know where your clothes are
not
well um not on me
apparently anyway spark says this way so
I guess
I'll nice
outfit it's see it's it's
my super sporty outfit you
see
oh oh is it okay okay I should should be
able to find it now on my own it's
probably behind this
door no there's an extra
life okay okay okay it's somewhere
here and see if I can find it without
more
help now with even more reduced air
resistance
yes
wait
I guess the dress cause some air
resistance but
um oh there it is I found
[Music]
it I found
it almost 100% by
myself
St that two dragon flies interesting
interesting where wait yeah yeah the
initial Miss mission of defeating those
magicians which didn't
work two
green
983 so close to 7,000
so very close themes then sounds
po yeah this is a progress
place there's a
whole mission portal I not found
apparently oh and you're
friendly reason okay what I me
see I don't have to go down to it 14
gems two dragon
flies what it must be at like the secret
portal or
something wait where where's where are
the can't get out of my
way where are The
Magicians where is
everyone
like where are all the where where are
all the enemies anyway like these are
respawn
but for the
enemies they were there in the other
levels I think this level
is
empty
just just empty
now foric they're dead all dead it is on
my
fault okay you can't go down there maybe
it was that that glitched
area
need a sneaky outfit what would that be
I mean I I have the
uh still have the thread for suggesting
R random s suggesting outfits for pon
pon CH going get
up if you have an idea what a sneaky
outfit
is
which isn't just under
way the sports squ should be sneaky
enough's big white tum is going to
reveal her
location an astronaut outfit oh yeah you
like that I guess you could suggest that
but like
example PJ or like how you would like it
to look
like but didn't you make a cats suit
outfit for crash for cats
suit I did that that's a
Speedway it's a cat
suit I have not made any I made a Pon
suit
this will be empty oh ads I didn't
realize the ads were
playing
um
and then if I find something I guess I
don't
know there we go that's basically it um
because I yeah I probably want find
anything on during this stre minutes
anyway
why are you making egg Steve
noises I talk to
you yeah not bad yeah you're not giving
me
anything how
rude
and I don't think there's anything down
[Music]
here at least I would use I can use the
Sparks pointing
after after the S are
done that sounds like a good
idea
I'm still curious about landing on the
these not that they really lead anywhere
so I'm not really sure what the point is
this spinning around and
around and round and
round this one is at the
edge
so it's possible that this one has a g
gam but it did not drop anything
so I should stop using so many C cuz I
120,000 left yeah yeah yeah exactly
save on oh I was reading the message Che
didn't pay attention uh save the gems
and don't spend it all on
way so the ass are over and I basically
I'm not found
anything so whoever had ads no
problem nothing was
missed just me running around
it's still weird that there is a
whole bonus level I'm not reached yet
what could that
be feels like I've Been
Everywhere I was going to say that was a
yellow J but
nope just a
piece no it really looks like
that
no wait how are we supposed to get up
from
here cuz you have the water
here
okay is is supposed to be like
this cuz he just ends here is it
supposed to be a waterfall here or
something wait how do I get out from
here oh there it is
fly oh my this game was it the broken
water yes and I just don't get it why
does SP a SPID just not fly sometimes he
just he just walks off the edge and
falls
down pressing to jump but then nothing
happened there's a platform there after
I jump down to that place maybe I'm not
been there I don't know
but I didn't want to fly there so I
don't
know on my way over there everything
want to
fine
okay guess this is not a changed game
mechanic it's just ter about
game yeah yes the broken water is here I
really wonder does it really look like
this one gameq
too and doesn't look like this ever
playing on actual
PS2 oh thank you for following Norse
wolf demig godess R that's quite the
title
got no I didn't touch
it just SP mess should be p in by
Thursday oh nice nice nice
my current mattress had a bad spring
sticking out and stabbing into my back I
never had a mattress with action
Springs I cannot imagine how it's I
think I've actually used a bed with
springs
before this
been
think hold I was it was
uncomfortable no no it wasn't the bad
news was so
far that's what it was and it was
uncomfortable like those Springs I could
basically feel every
spring thanks for your help
spirro well okay I use spks now that
way acck

Norse rabbit princess pon
pon oh
wait where
this in
here this is where I came from
there's
something
what
what what's with this level how am I
supposed to get
off
okay up is this way okay okay okay okay
H and Springs at the foot of my bed or
all exposed and kind of cut my feet that
sounds terrible why do you still have
it
ah of course the only the only world the
only wall in the whole game you can
break
through the only
[Music]
one
oh secret W yep
apparently I think this the that's the
only one in the whole game we can break
through but why does the enemies not
respond in that world anyway
Wizard and lower the Wizard's Tower
yeah s was like two of these
towers but for some reason I couldn't
remember why why it wasn't that well
yeah it was kind of this is the one I
actually
remembered
I do like this music better than the
other way this one
is
quite all there's another one how many
are
there this was the last one because now
it jumped
is the
wi going to fight against the wi Unity
sure no I could
try oh I did
it
probably have to activate all of
these wa what only two of those oh right
then I should should ride this one so I
can catch up with the the
one
lightning wait do you want me to say
that wait
Lightning yeah wait which which
sense that
word
like least that would be a
lightning
and now oh all right oh need
one and then I go back
[Music]
here SP is Emperor pal
paltin I don't know I haven't heard
their name spoken use for sing Force
lightning close one and that was also a
close one but in the other way H oh
those platforms can get really
tricky yeah they good in Polish
lightning is
Blasco if you say
so wait shouldn't I be able to just
stand
here I just need to know how many of
these there
are okay thank you for following a
fanboy syan I oh no Spyro a wild Fanboy
s appears in chat I know about the it
just reminds me that of thean I've seen
some art of Fanboy
Sans do like them
boys arram is better not going to
lie rocket
man this is very you the you
say how are there
four it's like what why did you do
that oh that's watch that
one there we
go but welcome Fanboy syan that
sounds yeah I'm excited to have Fanboy
in
chat F yeah because when I jumped he
bumped side of the platform therefore he
could not fly anymore this this game
this game is so stupid sometimes I think
about five of these let me count them
for real this time no it's six of these
not see because they're all in way
F yeah there's six of these okay
fire so steep in this game
one that's your opinion and you're
entitled to it too for me S is very s is
fantastic because silon is pink white
and
blue oh
or that's that's not what you do when we
have new vors
here
that's you can also use pure run to mean
lightning which comes from the slav God
of Thunder
per but yeah word is
basically leak or if you want
PL hav't you just wanted to be silly
apologize it's
fine it's fine you you don't have to
apologize oh I actually got
up what should I doal with these in
anyway I'll be careful this time yeah I
think I remember this level being very
annoying
well I mean well I I have used a syvan I
don't think I've ever used an
Umbreon but I think it's more
about if you like how they
look more than anything
else and there's another one
then I will be done with out
laying think now there's another
one well let's skip over to this one so
I can use
it I think what would help is that SP
this game has a problem with it is that
when you jump off a
platform all the momentum you have from
that platform just does not con is not
included
I think what would help is that the
momentum you had from that platform is
preserved so when you jump because if I
jump I moves like that that's not how
reality
works if they could just preserve your
momentum of the platform you st I mean
sure there's wind
resistance
but with having like the momentum just
being uh Factor door added to
your how should I best do go about doing
this I think I'll take care of these
first now that one is
done but I think there's another
one
uh how sing today I am whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa
whoa no which change direction on this
game I mean at least come on why is this
this game I was doing so well and then
just the game just messed everything up
for me I going to move
spider I'm doing them right I still have
things to resolve after the move
but but other wayse is
okay D they have likely done the moving
with platforms by parent Inspire to the
platform three so to get the momentum
they need to do a lot of extra
fiing you should have considered that I
mean if you're going to make a platform
in game where you're going to have
moving platform you have to build a
system that can
handle it's keeping the momentum of the
platform that you jump off off that's
that's like you have have to do
it so I do I get
yes like yeah I I'd say you have to do
it they're like stuck in the
[Music]
air extra feeling is no
excuse
hey that's that's what called
proy would make jumping flat because
yeah from my perspective the platform
I'm standing on is standing still and
also yeah as the platform is rotating it
should also not rotate the camera it
should the result should basically as if
the platform is standing on is standing
still that that's the goal I want
because that that's what it looks like
from my perspective and that's also how
it
is because the thing is H all of these
platforms and everything is moving on a
whole planet and the planet is moving
around the sun and the Sun is moving
itself
and it's only using like relative I mean
obviously it's not using Because the
actual space of the 3D environment is
not
moving but in
reality is on a moving
platform the travels around big
son okay can I please not do this
again he's going to do it again he's
doing it
again how am I supposed
[Music]
to yeah we hav done this one
okay it's sure speeding on now
goodbye okay good good
good another one good now my platform I
need to get back
to it's
fine okay um I should probably not use
this platform I should probably use
these out platforms actually okay let's
use an out
platform
go if that one is
done yeah does not help that these are
moving with each other now ah oh there's
one well I guess I have just two I mean
I could jump out into
now I'll catch up with it eventually I'm
just driving this
vehicle
it's so Ted this is yes now it's slowing
down again now I'm going to get get cash
up with other one and in reality spider
world is fault I know you mean flat in
in the actual 3D world and the 3D engine
and stuff yeah they the every planet
flat unless you intentionally make them
unflat L and
SP
unflat now this is going to be an
annoying
part I guess that's why this platform
moves so
slowly just so you can jump up like this
but
still having this platform move and
affecting jumps is
it's a bit
annoying okay and then
there's two of
things now I just needed to swap around
somehow yeah it is
moving they are
separating and I'm not going to do a
mistake now because it's only two left I
hope it's only two left I really hope I
don't haven't missed one
I'm going to jump in the middle and
increase my own of jumping at the
correct
time yeah
flat I'm flat as
when
see there we go does that mean
that no spider what are you doing I'm
trying to
look the here we
go I can't look around wait did I really
miss
one I did miss
one
[Music]
annoying did I miss this
one nothing
activate I get everything
now
yes yes it's moved the platform is moved
down yes good
good now I need get up
there I have to wait for this platform
to come there we
go oh that was a scary
jump I did
it
hello I have to do a
magic
battle a magic battle with this
dude should I use
Electrify
okay I did it what skill I can't believe
you made it to the wizard it took quite
a
while hey it's Mor
morus yes want to try theat puzzle
again
so come back
any probably not probably stay away from
that now we just need to reach the end
of the level and pick up the final
dragonfly of this level and then I'm
done with the thieves
[Music]
then so because the end because now I
got rid of all the Wizards so now he's
not just going to say thank you sp he's
going to
say oh thank you my
amazing
princess getting rid of all of those
nasty
annoying am I going the wrong
way no
me that's see was dis from a
distance why is there a bath on the
ground I owe you
all everything for I have doing so much
for
me but I don't have anything to
offer so except for this
dragon
fly wish you can have boy doing so much
for
us far you why are you not
flying oh I forgot press the confirm on
that
anyway now I don't want to speak to
you anyway I can't pay you for the help
but I do have this
bug any and and having one less bug in
this game would be
perfect you
know I hope you don't
disag
oh and then when this level is done I
only got one more was like three gem
gems and one dragon
fly now what is this that's not a
payment that's
sft I any theves then but
still I didn't expect my dress to
disappear when I walked into this
place
that's carrot coins well
spent what's next to carrot coin printed
design hello can I get my dragon fly
now thanks for your help
Spyro did you drop
this well not at all what I hey it's
Mickey Hey
Mickey you're so
[Music]
fly three attems and one press wrong
button but it's yeah it is the dragon FL
I tried to look for before so this is
going to be
interesting I think this is another
level where I tried to look for the gems
I think I went round like twice now I
tried to go around it another time but
the level didn't load that's what was
going
on well I'm glad you
find it's to be well
spent this Mickey
goes yeah at least they don't do
that I heard them trying
to it could be
go in
here oh oh no I'm
trapped that
and they try to Su people for using the
phrase akun
Manata
anyway so yeah I did try to look
for the missing
gems me it's the last level I can
put
and look around a little
bit running around
it
oink and also in a potential remake fix
the birds and repeating themselves
why jump over this lava pole that seems
dangerous let's walk around it
instead whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
whoa Spyro you were supposed to walk
around
it in again it turned out that walking
around it was more dangerous than just
jumping
over
but that's only
because but when surely can't be
as excuse me a secret door anywhere
because no why didn't you reach stupid
Dragon um at least the enemies
I I was going to say is still a ladder
there
no
what a red orange
Mist orange
M just
checking
like this what is this even
anyway
yeah what he had to bump into
everything I hungry but I don't know if
any places are open today due to the
weather where well
um is this a
puzzle
that would be
something use eyes against
this okay okay
ice
flame
lightning uh
bubbles bubble number two
there's it that's the that's the
password totally trust me that does
shine it is a
password
wait
wait wait do I have to Flame all of
them wait now that wait I can activate
one of
them wait
a
yellow
green it's
come something is
activated that one's
encased wait wait wait let let me see
see oh wait no I can't do
that was this J activating
this is
something should I just activate all of
them is that what I have to
do no there's some puzzle here
and I I I'll see if I can solve it let
me
just look around the
area it it
is possible that it should
be activated in a certain order or
something which I don't
see I think that indicates an
order oh wait wait wait wait oh oh wait
I see I
see that one matches that
symbol and this
symbol
so this one
activates
no
h it matches this symbol they have to
stand on
it this is is
my there symol here but I can't really
as match is this
symbol never
know
oh okay okay no I didn't see anything
new
encased or is it not encased
sudden is
encased but not like I
can can I activate the gy on the chest
as
well not from here
okay
okay let's go
[Music]
higher I should have done something
should I activate it with every
ability
okay I'm a bit
confused activate in a specific
order yellow
green let me
see that's blue
purple okay let's see
yellow
green
red
blue
purple
no yeah I guess I'll just have to
activate one of them and try stand the
platform and see what's
happening and Bash the
platform that that's activate a
sound let me go
check it could be something with the
sound
confusing indeed it is
confusing there's a sound
playe when that one specifically is
activated oh there's a gem
here that was it wait 6,800 what kind of
strange number is that
I couldn't just squeezed in 200
more y
follow the lightning sound I don't know
if anyone else here it it's very
local and this is out this is not where
I want to
go the only option other option is who
wait wait wait wait
wait
one
three
or
or
two what that makes no
sense is there an
icon no it doesn't no I've been
activating all each of them so it's not
that I have to activate one of them well
maybe that's it what
wa one
platform no it's it is tilted like that
so you can claim
up this oh okay okay but there's no
five there's two
fours Hest you tried no I haven't tried
that I mean okay red
green blue but then there's two fours
that doesn't make
sense there's no
like this one has four symbols on
it but this one has four symbols on it
as
well but it does have one on it okay
yellow is
fine okay
okay
red
green
blue
purple
yellow yes there we go that was the
password I just
teleport I did solve
it without looking
anything that's
[Music]
everything everything done all gems
all oh yeah because it's 6,800 because I
paint 200 money backs that's
why that's why how do I get that this
back then go to the homeor now let's
press save now if I level it
says if I go back to home world can I
get my 200 missing gems
back
okay I do think that was an interesting
puzzle it was very straightforward when
I saw what I had look for
but
but this still took me a bit of time to
actually find
it especially the part where it was two
fors and that kind of confused
me
well the level complete Game
Complete because the
games I think we like season of
fire didn't never did that with Seas on
Ice no I think the game completed up
anyway no wait wasn't that part of the
ending mon Bank came back the gems
because that was the ending of season
of
yeah see
I don't need to sa again but whatever
because at the end of season of flame
you go back to this start and then need
more bags well I I mean I can't just go
and
Pummel rip I can gu Victory outfit
where's the victory
outfit no bulge this time jle oh no no
not the Victor outet I'll see if I can
like
flame kill ripto again and see if it
changes anything if like after you 100%
again go and murder ripto
again he Li from
Lim walking but with running Miss okay
wait I I shouldn't have skipped that I
mean it's same dialog
right and I just have to be really
aggressive
that appar if you actually like if
actually try to avoid his attacks to
actually try to do a proper boss
spell is really really
hard both in
mocus
I was we read it so you'd be pay
attention to the change
oh oh
myus Pocus you said like that three
times I don't even know what kind of
attack it does
here it's the same kind of
attack excuse me where is my attack not
working
now the game is just
cheing at least I start from the second
face
but
now traing the camera
cuz it's big yeah he is
is oh well I guess I'll be starting from
that part anyway so where is he there is
there we
go Pocus all
right Focus Pocus
he's even big
enough now he
glows and now he's a
monster this did not happen last time
wow ow hit on the
hand oh I need
you wa I don't need you
now oh not that wait what am I supposed
to
do okay
I did Spider
die while not being
dead okay can't reflect
that maybe I can reflect that yes that's
what I want need to reflect
he
what
that wait that was WR H
confusing wait this didn't happen last
time no
no
didn't he's not to
[Music]
monster but I don't know how much I
should do to defeat
him I should overload it
for what a weir
de oh no not that how I supposed to
Shield myself against
that
ow again we supposed too
that they are
seeking Target seeking so this 100%
apparently it's like an impossible boss
battle Yeah I mean yeah
what I supposed to
do now we doing
it
[Music]
oh how do you dodge those SE ones anyway
I don't know this there's no Dodge roll
so like
that the the amount of time you have
from he hits the
ground
until
he
is am I going to charge
it no apparently not I guess maybe this
is a charge
tag yeah if I stand that
close it just does that attack and that
does it in correct Tempo so you die from
it
maybe I can f them probably
not maybe I can charge
them nope
okay that's how we can avoid
them
so not really a big difference between
the two attacks because I jump over
death
anyway when you when
you all you do is press a single
button
that's that's that's all that's all I
have to
do avoid
everything in the right moment of course
but there all are going to do anything
else in these two attacks
constantly like where's my opening for
like
attacking where's your V vulnerability
facee this is the infinite long boss
battle well I guess it's going to be
tired at some
point was
fine I'm am I supposed to
do I mean there's no point for me to
approach
because he's
invincible
yeah and then that happens oh H GL is
vulnerable face is in the rotation yeah
that's probably
way now we see
all
that's is
H
boom boom and then he's supposed to do
that but now he's not doing I guess game
is BU thingy
well this is
fun
yeah there's no
quick what I did say before
so well an impossible boss battle
because boss is never vable
ver that's that's how you make a boss
battle hard make it impossible to
defeat I can't push
the it is 100%
[Music]
but this game is the hardest still I
don't know it's not as annoying as
season
wise I guess it's saved here
you're back again how is this possible I
will take care of you
permanently yeah
ex exact same dialogue even though it's
said separate Boss B because it's
different oh now the ass
playing
can't Mo that
far pocus pocus let see SPID glitching
through the
camera
rip is kind of glitchy too
so no there it
was I don't have exactly learned what of
these yeah I assume
use flame on the first phase ice on the
second phase electricity on the third
phase bubble on the fourth
phase
hus hus Hocus
Pocus I'm just going to create a safe
slot
here
I
tried
what yeah I can't stand as close
because
great when a game lags as it makes
that where is that one so high
up yeah the game is glitched I don't
know
what to
do we sure was someone else complet this
100% ripto battle
instead see how it's actually meant to
go but I don't know it's not
doing
but that certainly isn't
working
out
that worked between
him
well
but that was
different oh fell to
it yeah I'm not sure what point is I'm
not sure what I'm supposed to do or
anything don't know what I'm supposed to
[Music]
do so I
guess I'll take a quick look
online
oh
one no flame button
run anyway
[Music]
um
[Music]
so spal enter dragon fly
lipto lipto
glitch
100%
expire enter driver 100% part
10
okay the boss battle starts here let me
take a quick
look and twice the
speed
and this person is
just avoiding attack after attack Sparks
isn't even eating
butterflies D
and
one
yeah nothing is happening in this b
battle it just it's exact same thing
it's just repeating the same cycle over
and over and over and over
again probably test this fight to see if
it will work maybe that's the thing
maybe you can't defeat the final boss
but the thing is the when I first did
the was when I first
played
um
when I when I first started playing the
battle he did that thing but then he
just didn't do that
thing oh he in in this SP finally did it
after
like um 3 minutes three minutes he did
it the first time
[Music]
um why does this game seem horrible
because it is
[Music]
D yeah he did go into the rumble face
the first time when he up he's rot and
he doesn't
take
zapping his
Rod yes when when his Rod was
vable vable that's what I was supposed
to
do that I'll be sapping his
Rod okay that's time then entering this
back battle but now actually restarted
the whole game not just with main
menu
night SP
fly I will I will create saves SLS as I
go on I mean this is
ridiculous it's not that I'm going to
it's more like if the game bugs out I
guess
the and I switch
ones this face bug out
before was like the gamage bug or
something I like that he's just standing
there
nothing is he me music procedurally
generated or
something then I have to switch
this he's a pro
in which
does
avoiding
oh wa no that's
attack
yeah he probably going to be an infinite
bu
Bell
anything else going
on every successful hit I will make a
safe State because I'm not to deal with
this
I should have pop to play this game
oh okay that was a successful hit I
wasn't even prepared for it just came
out of
nowh Le into the
middle
maybe okay actually let me check the
ven uh
[Music]
where I think I close the video let me
check the video because you should
remember now it did not
remember where oh yeah wait wait wait
here now there something
M what yeah wait he's actually okay he's
actually standing on the edge of this
circle
which it it kind of
D yeah I wasn't I wasn't even sure which
face I wasn't that
right
okay now he's in the
middle
oh successful is number two seems like
same wow
immediately successful hit number three
how many times do I actually have to hit
him
he's walking out of
it
h four how many Health points do you
think you have five or
seven
can't mve
me lives
far
to help me keep track of how many times
I H it's four times so
far oh
oh that was
unsuccessful what that was the wrong
attack
what
to take it oh five attacks and then he's
down even though I tried to cheat with
wrong attack is he going to do
anything
okay
okay had to L the PL
it no not again my plans are so perfect
twice I put my faith in this staff and
twice it has failed me dragons
dragonflies I can't win I can't win well
that's what you get for playing with
your little sticks silly ripto don't you
know magic and dinosaurs don't mix yeah
don't play with the last of me you
little demon I'll be back and you'll be
sorry we didn't hear what SPID had to
say it's final
word there you go there's the Final Cut
shame the cut scenes are so
[Music]
broken well as normal as fairy tales go
anyway pal I'll tell you what though
guys we weren't just going to stand by
and let ripto run this day for the baby
dragons right Sparks or the dragon flies
well everything is finally
back now we can't you can't hear what H
had to
say playing we s what was that I
actually did complete the game for real
this
time but yes um
nothing wrong with did the developing
team they just didn't get the time to
actually develop the game no it's
this this isn't
[Music]
celebration this is
punishment celebration times
tonight
oh Stars
everywhere you're going to see stars if
you were to
do well the game is 100% complete so
there's nothing more to do that so next
time we'll be Spyro Shadow
Legacy excited is there a bunny
constellation H there might
be you can make
one
constellations aren't really official in
like they
are they're kind of
like just made
up my
people and sometimes they can be really
creative
when when they see these
Stars I'm waiting for Shadow Legacy well
you have to wait six
days then that game will run perfectly
fine as well it's just like this game
okay this game has some issues running a
booklet the sign it was no
[Music]
booklet I don't know it was AET probably
like in cover
booklet if you still have
them wom music that's
some interesting music there's the voice
cost Tom KY Aspire and additional voices
break Burger as Burger as Hunter and
additional voices Andre
so as Sparks and additional
voices so
on I think it's the same regular people
that usually do their
voices and the music wasn't long enough
to even cover the
whole the credits and now no I back sit
quiet for the rest of the
guys look testers they actually had
testers
wow a lot of testers too 14
testers well they sure didn't get to
test much at least because I mean or
even if they did test St they certainly
didn't fix
them Billy West righted voes this
game
forward never
straight that doesn't sound like a
name a vog sales team this it' probably
be ug sales team probably not name I
they had tested didn't listen to any
feedback they provided probably or the
testers didn't know it w your work is
your work is you don't let you down what
what do you
mean there's a cryptic message going on
on
here oh well game
over now it's 100% but I don't think
it's saved after defeating bus anyway
so that's that that is
that let's
close black screen well well I I don't
have anything else to do it's it's been
two hours so it's quite a good long
stream
anyway work on yourself
con but I
did update this one so now it's for next
week Wednesday 17 to 23 that's fun well
fun in some
ways the game sure was
weird it was possible to complete
but I should requir a bu
bunnies there's a lot of bunnies on this
stream bunnies
everywhere should we
I
mean we
could go and visit Rocket Man but he's
playing tide tanian tiger and someone
wanted me to play it and I do prefer
going game without looking at them
so exactly I don't want to see the game
if I'm so
[Music]
that
otherway there like pump in unicorn
playing by Shop 2 remastered which is
probably not a game I would to play
anyway the games I haven't played or
games I have played
or want to play want to play
[Music]
anyway I guess are options
otherwise if you will play like GTA five
or
something or whatever else he's playing
that would be
different I
think it work in that case because that
I
would I don't think I would play GTA it
doesn't I don't I don't think that would
be a franchise for
[Music]
me I what what do you
[Music]
say
well how
[Music]
about yeah let's let
visit let's visit pumpin unicorn and
then we can visit Ro man some more
day I
guiss probably I probably have to stop
there's stuff I wanted
to take care
of probably bloodiest raid and
then be a
[Music]
bit or something
