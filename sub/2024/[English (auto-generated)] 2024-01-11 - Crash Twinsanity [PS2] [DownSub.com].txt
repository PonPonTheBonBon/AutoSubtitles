might this P
anyway this
is Crash twin
sanity there you are beautiful now you
can look at pon pon now you can redeem
the
swimsuit you like that
one I find
I think the swim seat is cute your
rabbits weren't biting well no because
I'm a rabbit and rabbits don't bite
rabbits extras
wait so like oh I
see so I get like the go is basically
collect everything and I get all the
extras anyway the extras St lat this is
where I left off that's more rabits but
not the swimsuits team does this game
work on Duck station well considering
it's a PlayStation 2 game I would say
no it does work uh unless there is a
duck station PlayStation 2 but all all I
know is play
one I just supposed to go down with
it probably I don't know what this game
oh I guess I left this door Way ohly
open up oh wait where am
I oh okay you know what let's let's
reset back to where I
was and let's pretend that didn't didn't
never
happen like the only thing I see is I
should stand on it and go down but
apparently I stepped off it and died
because that's how this game
works here we
go this game is a
bit
evil there's been a few moments like
this game wait a
minute I can't get across
here o we can actually see the ground
down there I do like that that's
quite
and we can also
see
fruits and the gem that I picked up like
three times but got the game over after
that I lost it and the game is really
evil like
that wait what's this this is just
death there's the sport right but not
swing but yeah he same as yesterday wait
what same game as
yesterday I'm very confused but this
well let's continue
then many do oh hello C how did you get
in
here probably open went close the door
this is the psychotron gateway to the
infinite Dimensions beyond our universe
somewhere between the 9th and 11th
Dimensions lies the mysterious 10th
Dimension and there we must go in order
to confront the evil twins steal the
riches and restore the natural order of
things with me on
top we require six power crystal in
order to make the leap and we have pink
bunnies yes they were pink bunnies now
the bunnies were white let
see that isn't enough All Is Lost unless
unless
this
way it's such a long animation before he
starts moving
like just jump into it oh he touched it
nice yes oh you can walk around H see
well didn't say we to walk around it and
going yeah I don't like the slide jump
in this game sometimes I tried to slide
jump there but nothing happen I like the
slide jump in Crash but this
game wait for me crash C cortex that's
your
name to many names wait now on the other
side of the scene that's why I should
progress just making sure there are no
secrets why does it make the extra life
sound it's a
checkpoint oh soon put on
the it was funny yesterday when cortex
was being attacked by Humble bumblebee
so let's see if he gets attacked more
this oh here's where we
going quite a loud platform very
loud yes open please I guess it's a
loading so could say it's a wall no
nice how did cortex get through
here I mean he could
certainly blow this stuff up and get
through anyway
but no it wasn't he died in the
air very loud this part is fun Should I
love the game a bit more there's no
problem if it makes it easy to hear me I
might not speak the
loudest I'm a timy little bunny I'm not
very loud as you know because people
said that I might I'm a bit too quiet
sometimes when I speak which I know but
it's
hard I think a bunny represents me
well now they're very generous about
these safe
slots this part is funny I hope I hope
it
is there to the sea I tell you our
Salvation floats upon the Briney blue we
must reach engine's Battleship and
quickly before it sets sail but how
think cortex
think
well crash has
his
ice on
something
okay
was yes just Ram cortex straight into
these boxes
oh
yeah can't be the most
comfortable watch
J
nice no jump
away
oh ah oh yes yes
oh wait this wrong music this game is
buggy or
something oh I missed it whoop I I'll
get to it after the sliding section
because this is likeing all to scroller
well I could pause the
game oh that can't that's no fun is
there is it I don't know if we should
hit
that don't get
checkpoint
and this looks
like I think I
should we
go
do very slow at the moment oh careful
about that oh and
die
who oh open gate
there okay thing
crazy
who
invincibility does not help from falling
to death PR is really
glowing getting his ability is more
distracting I don't know what that does
I don't know I do the same thing
again
yeah I I
I I did not get Mas this time
I this is why I wanted to do maybe I
should give up on
that I can hear you today that's good of
all the crash band good characters who
do you think is the most likely trans I
actually I should have probably gone to
the right there I'm actually
not have any like
thoughts like if you ask me Spyro for
example I was say
Sheila she doesn't have a pouch can I go
straight to it yes like that that's what
I wanted this one time
get them off of
me oh it's
changed now I don't see
anything yes SL C is
inside exploded oh another FR
cryst but why did you store all the
power crystals
then
every time they found a power Crystal it
wasn't like oh it's the the power
Crystal that were fighting over all this
time it's actually a new power pistol
because the previous one has been stored
somewhere
which
where
yeah okay let's go over
here don't know what that does
SP I missed
it I guess
I no I want to take that part coming
through ladies excuse me mad are those
real
mother that was awkward let's try to oh
I couldn't jump over see well there it
is
yep Oho oh wait I already got this gem
oh I died immediately
after hey at least I get a new chance
of getting I don't know what it is
though I missed it again anyway more
time ladies ex
straight chicken chickens on Penguins
okay I should not go into that oh
there's the gem okay I have that
now if I die I can go for
it but that's off the level that wasn't
that
M that me laugh every time oh I got a
checkpoint
so I didn't get that chance to go after
that Jem again oh
well oops he at least
that's there's another one of
these okay feel like I got every each of
them oh gem
nice the one I know I
missed oh no oh I got it anyway nice the
game is quite lenient with how far away
you can can be from gems but still get
them this quite a long
level no
more ah now now you don't stand a
chance
snowballs look it's a
dingodile
so watch out for slowly falling snowball
and I've never been so humili no sound
effects no am of treasure could ever
begin to
compensate he doesn't say
much and he didn't seem to be too upset
about the
house you guys going lie
here
okay and um this one looks a
bit
anyway one this one looks a
bit anyway moving on I have two ways to
go
here which way is the way I'm supposed
to go which
way
this looks more like a
bonus let's put pick up some extra
KN I suspect there's a gem at the end of
this hope that jump to oh that was
close this engin battle
chip what there's a checkpoint
here
hydrate
okay probably die if I try to go for
those maybe this is the
continuation although there are boxes
there as if I oh music disappeared
back
no swing the timer for the SP is not up
yet I'm dying
now that did not work that did not do it
better I need to stop slide jumping is
worthless
man
oh batt ship my mind plays tricks on me
when I'm not near my phone I S you say
engines bowel ship what's bowel
ship whoo whoo wo
whoo that bat did something I hear more
there's one
oh did it sound
twice
nice I don't think I want to know what
the bow ship is
okay what is this big and
open I mean considering the other things
has been in this game
wait wait this is just
back he's back
here okay well I
gu well let's ignore that
then
try
to wait now i s to turn around and went
the other
way but apparently I'm
going apparently the checkpoint put me
see way any way wait there's
a oh I see a jam
Liv
s where is it there it is and
then oh oh there it is oh my dis
place okay
good who wo
oh
nice I guess it was a good thing I walk
back
anyway can I yes so I don't have to mess
with that other
one wrong way
see I know but I found the jam is all
good no back seat please I think I
realized I went the wrong
way yeah I can go for this gem now I
guess and I'm going to be careful now
there we
go while I'm at
it now I can go
back well I guess it does put me
back and it should hopefully yeah it
does keep the gems for me so that's good
and yeah and then I continue this
way that can go
back I'm just helping her so no I
mean I have actually written no back
seating oh this one doesn't work and
because I don't want people
to tell me what to
do part of playing is to I try to quick
enough anyway
um I'm pretty surean is very
chilly well now that I know what that is
I can now go here
instead well was a good thing I still
went there I got those gems i'
been it looks like ice this looks
who what we
got it is not that kind of ice as soon
as you step on
it why did I go so quickly
there might
move I must done something like
that
well o this doesn't look
good oh hello
good thing I can walk around the whole
thing I mean there's no point of me
picking that stuff
up can still do this to get some come
on get some extra
lives CU I going to need those oh I hate
boxes
yeah not a fan of those oh this looks a
bit
dangerous
ooh whoa
W yeah I really need to learn how the
Box jumping Works in this
game yeah I'm trying to look forward
with the camera is colliding with
the with the one can I go stand on that
one yeah I can't go anyway
there I have to go across here
then these things
are
okay
nice
invisibility no doesn't prevent me from
dying
though H boxes is the way is way worse
than than TNT boxes and it's also worse
in this game because the M doesn't even
protect you
from doesn't even protect
you he insta kill
now
go how do I get across here maybe I just
do like that
yes like that I did
it oh
engine
well that was
weird look an
animal look it's a ow
right wa wao that
that that one was
closed ah it seems safe
it doesn't seem to explode anyway so oh
there's a lot of
those now I fell down
in TNT is instant kill too if if you
don't get far enough from it uh yeah I
mean I meant both kind of explosions are
instant kill in this
game
okay doing that PR is
strong I guess I'm not supposed to
continue here now I use B
WS
whoa what is
this I can't interact with
it
oh w
Mouse yes platform there we
go could probably have jumped through
that but I wanted to be
safe they have a r infestation here
oh this one seems to be too
easy this not easy to go for the ch
and
then
ah can spin it oh apparently you can do
that okay good to know don't need to do
oh black rats they got b r gray red and
black
rat wait does this lead to
like lower area but there's nothing down
there there's no Champs or anything
so
jump crash
jump
uh still feels like I don't get notified
when new message shows up I need to do
something about
that
protect yeah I don't know
why hey I've been always curious about
that rocket on n's head how did it end
up on his head
some kind of accident I
was I don't think that answer to
question
but well that kind of Sol
itself oh it was in my
way oops
I triying to be clever
but guess that's I trying to be
CL
this R rats everywhere rats wait where
am I supposed to go down
oh there's a
platform
checkpoint we're supposed to go platform
thank
you can I jump over no it's barely
deep I think engine has a rocket ship
somewhere in his tree oh
no right I could just do that
okay there we
go no oh I did it no
okay probably an easy way to do this not
like that
noan yeah like this that seems easy no
no that's what
further that that I couldn't do and now
I need to be
careful this one's much
F there's something there but I
don't I'm I'm too afraid to
take I can't see the platform because
there's a
platform right I'm going to ignore you
who I didn't say
anything what's with these
chips I'm supposed to go over
here strange Rockets wa who said
anything about
disappearing or did I see that
wrong
probably saw that wrong really looks
like it
disappeared
good now I
am back
here so confused about this
level I guess I'm supposed to go here
level are kind of
looping wasn't right
was oh some fency
nice they
have
safe working
conditions oh power Crystal
can this my save point please
no music
is interesting more of ancient siblings
everywhere yeah oops lure
Engine
line into destroying his crown Nest
okay they made a typ of
like
ow
ow TNT
okay
wow
ow
only unless they want me to spin it the
back like the previous Boss B but I'm
not allowed to spin TNTs you can't
change the rules of
trash yeah if he survives I'm inan a
very weird Boss B at moment know
what I will spin back TNT I will do that
look at
this I'm going to do something
stupid apparently cannot spin it back it
doesn't happen it don't happen Okay I
read this actually know the back of the
rocket head thing engine was a
physicist in the defense
industry there was an accident during
the missile project which led to the
rocket in his
head he used his intellect to stabilize
the rocket and turn it into a life
support
system
what at the cost of his
sanity L for you say hi
hi hello jish Vibes coming in with the
Good Vibes yeah I'm not sure how it's
supposed to do these it said
L like I
see
I actually have extra lives don't really
see anything here I
can leure engine into destroying his CR
CR
CR
yeah maybe I should get the TNT to hit
close to these
scenes if I stand close no that was too
close
floating oh yeah yeah
yeah I stepped up the
platform I didn't know that nice back to
hi pet use use depending on if you
now I think it works on mobile too use
colon write head pads and Pon should
show show up WR 17 head
pads the force pon pon show
up S you cannot write pon pon head heads
it has to
be P pwn 17 or I need to get become
partner to only have one p as the
prefix which means I need an average of
75 viewers per stream but not really
there
yet I mean this isn't a hard boss battle
I mean yeah is more missiles but if you
keep
running and a
TNT
yes that was very far out but maybe it
counts no it
didn't we need to get
closer he stands there with no idle
animation
and then it's just run run run run run
the only thing you have to do is stay on
the track as long as you run me son
can't it could be smarter like yeah
maybe I should throw where crash is
going to end up D
see yes how is it staying
up supped to be so unstable at the
moment and now it's going to be more
sense now just keep
running I guess it's time to TNT now yes
TNT yes and there we go is that a
win
yay oh well that happened
to
how long is it going to float
in come
on
my no no break here no no no
just anyway now I can now I can read
yeah
oh I was able to use colon pon pon bring
up Dem yeah yeah you can use colon pon
pon to bring up all the pon pon emotes
however if you want a specific emote you
cannot write pon pon followed by the
name of the emote you must
write you must write 17 before the emote
you
want you can you can write pon
pon as well but 17 must come before the
because the the whole name of the emote
prefix included it must be uh
together that makes sense and now I have
to restart a whole engine level does
that mean I lost the gems on the no I
didn't at least I
can but I did lose the CH in this level
the whole level
again this is what I don't like about
this levels are so long I mean
technically let's kind of like
how I guess the original crash game
works too if you get a game
over to be
fair but those levels are like
shorter and like boss spells does not
count as part of the
level you get to the boss spell you
completed the his
level oh he actually damaged me this
time
uh let's just say you won't like this
next part me dying now I didn't like
that I think you meant the part the this
part of this game oh
yeah didn't
walk there are many things I don't like
but this game but I'm going to play
through it anyway I'm going to defeat
this game I'm going to show the game
that oh not
him yeah cry cry cry because of game
over I'll do better this time I'll show
you I show you I show you
all the rest are black this
time hey I'll show that I can do this
without
dying well that's
close be
gone
so is there something down here let me
let me check this time than price
expression on the game over screen looks
like he's contemplating his life choice
is has got in
there he has a lot of things
contemplating like
this whoo whoo whoo wo I'm looking
around that's like where you enter
where's with those boxes
there whatever they could have hidden
something here but I didn't that's a
thck
piston
they get a bunch of extra
lives hey what that's not fair that's
not how crash is supposed to
work that's what those works is Stu
like it's still easy to get across here
by using that pass and then you get
the and the gem a just for free without
any effort you have yeah you have to put
in more effort to avoid G than
to and also the game not allowing me to
do that well flop on to the rats that's
just
evil can I just back
track get the
Gem
yeah
good I do want some extra FR
fruties yeah and then I can do
this and then pick it up but uh
so yeah and then this platform
uh good
good in particular he's wondering what
happened to Coke to Cortex took off his
Coco disguise after cortex took off the
clothes he stole from Coco
and crash B us to used to be the mascot
for nauy dogs but not anymore the new
masc from another dog is ell from The
Last of Us well I mean it's kind of
awkward to have another company
character as your mascot in the first
place to be
honest this not a dog never owned a
crash in the first
place
but I me it is not dog they're going to
they're interesting I don't know they're
not travel tail that's was the
discussion last time because we know
never did see her recover from CS
attacking
her yeah how did she end
up did she ever get back her clothes CU
as you know Caron CA has one set of
clothes to wear every day well I mean
there's all the other one where
they where they have multiple sets but
every set of Cl look exactly the
same
avoing
you and then here it was this
way it really looks like they it
disappears
there that's
good bunch of
fruits mask not going to touch
that of the
red all right this
one again got hurt by that stupid rat
behind
it stupid game you can't even battlef
right witht this
okay good and I have seven extra knives
power Crystal
checkpoint hopefully she's not trying to
stick hands up her nose
what what did where did that come
from
she's not
CR at least now I know how to
defeat aome is going to spin spin spin
spin then stop
here this this boss does not have a
health
bar I mean the health bar is a physical
health bar in real life but in real life
in universe and not the H
element
pament this this boss has three there's
three attacks with missiles you have to
lure three
TNTs destroy the
thing and it takes three
second but cortex can did okay I pause
now did something that brought her
intelligence to crash level and we never
see her get better I assume it was a
stun because that
was you fresh me for my
P this say wanted fresh
meat I not sure how I can help you with
that come back
here hey you can wa yo you getting very
close all of a
sudden what why did I how why how do you
get how are you FAS than me how are I'm
running FAS as I
can I miss the me for
my you
see because that's kind of what I hear
you owe me fresh meat for my that's what
I hear but that might not be what they
say maybe I should double jump maybe I
should single jump that's it that's the
trick very peaky
game hey how can you run through those
without the sh still getting very
close oh is he coming back oh no he's
coming
back how does this not count this a
separate
n there's no point of me collecting
boxes
uh just focus on moving and
jumping Run and
Jump that a very high TOS stack of foxes
I had to spin
it oh that was
close kind of hard to see if the need
boxes I call them green box is sp very
green okay I got away oh
oh careful that
crash oh
cortex no that's not cortex that's
engine yeah if only CR flew away are
leaving the sinking
ship tell us where the treasure is and
we'll let you go
silent looks like we'll have to ring it
out of him embryo get
changed what's
trasure where is the sound
effects come on you just had a bus
battle and there was a chase by guy and
now is another Boss B what's going on in
this
game
and where did entropy go oh I guess I
got my question
answered all
P the rats are leaving the sinking ship
rush I my Rush where the treasure is and
will'll
let you go and there's a in engine cut
scenes I can out of skip it get changed
Brio get changed literally yourself into
a bouncy
ball in watch out this
inflation
ow
box
but yeah but like where
is is he like high he he somewhere high
up in the
a what am I supposed to
do oh I guess I'm supposed to
attack
then you're
back and then back the
entropy just going to avoid
these
now used to go defeat entropy I'm not
going to do
anything with
embryo and back
here
oh that was
close you moved around oh you fell into
the
ground that spawn in
there fly somewhere oh is a new level
it's back here to the
psychon we already been here have we
fixed the door
now interesting
platform oh ads didn't realize the ads
were going
so let me go and get some other chems I
guess during the
ads guess like I got that one that that
one what to check
okay no
I to many
redeems I have that one feel like I got
most here I'm missing oh I know which
I'm missing but that might mean I have
to walk past the trigger for next cut
scene I did oh there it
is
okay okay I think I know where lost two
gems
are and I got the all the gems in the
first level and we're going to get all
the gems on this
one but these are more like aren't
exactly how worlds but like starting
worlds for
the each like this in sanity Isle where
they miss apost can Iceberg
lab is actually the level of the name of
the but this is still like the Hub world
I guess I wanted to see bunnies the
bunnies that are not
pink let's check like these are boss
galleries these are Mo oh no more these
are anime Gallery this is just going to
be concept
Gallery
this
unseen Gallery I guess that's cut
content and then there's the last one I
really wish they had
like what you call it h different
playable skins wh don't do
that but
anyway that should be
over so let's
continue probably BR a cut scene no
apparently
not anyway everyone is here to see me
get the green gem which is located down
here wait how we supposed to go down
here like there's the clear gem that's
one I
God sugar don't give me sugar I I like
to eat sugar but be careful about giving
me sugar oh here we
go
yes doesn't matter I got a gem I can't
fall into the water of
tonight but this time I need this one I
got the green gem that's all that
counts the last gem is the
hardest haven't been able to cat all
stream for like 6 months du to school
and work until today how are things
hello
Rook y
I want to say that you've
been' been very busy which is what's
word I'm looking for it's great that you
are
um
um
word putting lot of effort
into oh no this this game the mov too
far too far for
me
anyway I guess I'll pick that up some
other
time I assume this is
where or should I go
in
no then maybe I didn't see where I was
supposed to go there's this thing this
is
new no this is this place isn't
it yeah this is this place this isn't
where I want to go where did he go where
am I supposed to
go I have no idea where it's supposed to
go
okay actually
actually I have actually no idea how to
progress the game now because the game
did not tell me where to go the game
probably told me where to go but I
didn't pay
attention I thought I was paying
attention did I go back to the
boat no he went up here then he
disappeared and I thought I was going to
activate another cut scene to know where
I'm supposed to
go and that's the so so that's to the
engine
chip ices
hings the slep slide skate T climb yeah
so that's do the third
level call only the third level so this
is like the H world go back up okay so
I'm supposed to go up
it is a new
platform but it's the second level
place that's to the uh second the first
level there's L I really thought I was
supposed to go in
here got it fix the opening or
something and
and this is as far as I know the second
level oh
look there's new stuff I think that's
one is new but not that I can get over
here at least that would mean that I
could get to a new
place yay wait wait what's
yay this is
just
H wait he did say I was supposed to go
in here
again right he did say go through
pyron so I'm back here all right because
he has enough crystals where my brother
go look C's back and she found her cluts
again my
crystals which
crystals I
no she got that again thanks to perky
here
must be repaired and only one person can
help my name Nina cortex isn't she
delightful obviously I've made a few
modifications here and there quickly to
my private derable set a course for
Madame amberly's Academy of
evil good thing he has pictures of I've
ever seen thank go come
along but what about
come
Coco
yes nice
colis convenient paintings yes well coko
I guess you're going to stand
here definitely moving and blinking at
least you have that
covered where was it going
again I guess just continue through
here oh don't stand on Coco well no
worries about standing on a Miss
platform above Coco wait this is going
back maybe it didn't go this way oh
wait yes now I'm supposed to go here
because now this platform's okay well I
guess she's she'll be okay yeah let's
just
ignore she'll she'll she'll
recover
hopefully no I missed
it faing the wrong way I'm supposed to
go
here
I guess she C once before exactly should
be fine it's not like crash can do
anything
well hey I didn't step into it hey
leave
my it's only way to
flyy so this is how to Rich and the Ugly
fly I was
doing a bag of those spicy
peanuts I will boring I shall crush you
like a r you are you are nothing to me
for I the great and all powerful NE
cortex you in how dare manate me rested
I will take my
upon yeah yeah whatever skipped it a
good
bit s Squad Rapid
Fire oh you can't rapid
fire oh he has a limited amount of shots
okay hold s l with charge
blast
oops he
died and then I had start all the way
over
here
wait back to stream no more
distractions now I can rotate the camera
so so they really whoop they really
don't like to give me check points and I
feel like after a cut scene you should
like maybe have a
checkpoint let's seems that seems
reasonable at least was a pretty Rand
cut since I can actually skip
it yeah I wish it was like carry
ability out of
ammo there we go now a
checkpoint oh crash is riding in
sty this is quite the place here oh
football I guess I'm supposed to use
it
here
oh
well that wasn't the way I wanted to
send it wow it's
spinning it's huge
too hey hey hey stop stop stop
rolling come
on yeah
yes wa I did
it what it did I don't know but there
are more
here is going to be no it is what oh
that's that's just
rude n it's green what do you
mean
oh here's one this is
insane yeah
I'm quite oh here we go
boiler oh let's play ah yes the old Alma
as a former student
myself
awward
Lev
was interesting
entrance but um I want to see if I can
get
some these gems which are kind
of
of
dog Lift Me
Up
can I use that football on that stack
then who R past
it okay that's not how I
did okay send
it okay actually sending it up in the
air might not work it might be confined
to the
ground
yeah
oh
well oh wait is that se
activating oh
nice nice
nice I mean wouldn't I be able
to I'm very very
careful yeah like this nope I mean activ
made it
but
ah yes the old Alma as a former
Downs I
something and is this this St I'm not
supposed to send those into that no
no and I'm not really wao wo wo dog from
no and I'm not sure how to like do like
a
kick brick with the ball
to get it up in the
air IIT can't stand in this
water and I guess I'll go for other gems
in the future maybe I'll learn some
treats or
something just a watch
okay so cortex falls down and so he was
standing there waiting for crash and
then he fell down and just went along
ahead without
crash oh
my oh
my what am I
doing
wa what was up here again a
gy oh okay
wait
what okay that's
easier yes so much easier to get that
one that's so
tricky yeah I cannot do that oh well
anyway let's
continue ah yes the old Alma Mar as a
former student myself I'm well
acquainted with the many Secrets this
institution
holds maybe s of the tractor
was the part crash stood
on I can't see the stream chat there you
go
um what are you doing playing Crash to
Insanity on stream yes I try to like
this game
but yeah I mean I'm trying to play this
game there are elements that I just wish
wasn't part of the
game so there are elements there
are
really
really
really
but sometimes some things are fun oh now
it's Crash cortex mode again this been a
way use pipes to flush
qu
I'm stuck the greatest evil scientist in
the world stuck in a pipe how could
things get any
worse
when hey at least it was your own and
not someone
else's there you
go that somehow activates okay
interesting oh wait I need I want to
activate this
one face crash game it's not
but I have you like
it
go I don't know more sers here no nope
nope he I'm just a crash two G
only I know which crash game I like
most like I think crash 3 without power
apps is fun press the red button to
activate the FLH oh should I
oh I see I
see
up goodbye
cortex where is he
going oh he wants oh there he
is are you having fun
oops he
died not much of value
lost I mean whether it's your own or
someone else's is going to move
to yeah I mean that's
true I don't think this place smells
that good in the first place maybe this
place smells
great he sometimes
oh sometimes he like stuck to
crash come
on
CR trying to run
cortex oh here we
go
go C all blue vals to complete the
networks of
pipes yes if I don't do that he would
just die if I press the big red
button
go going on his
Adventure some going to had fun making
these
pipes this seems to be too
much I
mean could probably jump up from there
down to this one or something
send in
there oh now he's returned
back wait I'm going slow him over shoot
the
lights I do whatever you need to do to
that
scene one p oh
shoot uh CR is my seconds for must smell
minty right yes it's like a minty
silver
no oh
okay minty fresh
smell oh a gem can you pick it up
cortex yes you can
nice very
good
okay quite slow sequence I can walk
past no tricks of throwing cortex the
right
way nice oh oh oh this looks a bit more
dangerous
let's wait for the next cycle here we
go
cortex meaty somehow that sounds
wor I don't know look at this this is
where all the mint comes from when they
make those minty give it to me and those
things produce
mint oh can I get that
nope I throw you
more no you just pushed away from it
maybe I should stand more
here there we
go the throwing cortex makes him
Invincible okay and then I'll throw you
there okay maybe maybe I could have
Easter got the gem if I have open up
this part first and then just from here
or something but ah e see who wants
that but yeah speaking of crash games I
still believe even though the have
people disagree with me I still believe
crash 3 was built without powerups in
mind the criticism to this I've heard is
that but P three has power yeah I know
but I really believe that powers were
like an after thought
I do not believe that the powerups were
were intended from the start when it
build all the lemel since I've completed
the whole game without
powerups keep I didn't see it I confused
the two
BS there we go and one more spin around
it's like someone blowing up a public
restroom and spraying an air freshen
afterwards it doesn't cover the smell
just as a flower smell
to I don't know how that would smell
like but I don't want to
know I can see that sometimes I forget
top jumps exist in that game and just
slightly jump I mean you don't even need
to do much glitching or like abusing
this engine or anything you can just
play the game normally
you can although not 100% but you can
complete every single level and defeat
cortex without using a single power
up I do tend to lean on the tornado spin
yeah I mean I a convenience but it's
definitely not required to win the game
there are
places where portex we're working
together I said we're working together
there are places in the
game just be quiet
qu there are places in the
game
where uh boxes are not uh
accessible H without the
powerups like the first level after you
get
the oh nice after the double jump
there's a stack of boxes that requires
the double jump to reach oh can I got
this without much
effort wait all right then I I need to
spin um you can certainly get H those
boxes through
each abusing the movement system in
Crash but
should excuse me
okay
okay oh there's another one up
there
um seems like I need to look more
careful in
future is this everything then no no
yeah yeah now it's leading me back hope
that was all of them really when kind of
stands
out I think that's the
point but yeah ignoring ignoring the Box
placements that required for like
getting a box gem as well as some
bonuses again just the Box placements
and those that requires the powerups
aside from
that you can do it you play help so yeah
if they just change those
things
H they could make it so you can play
through the whole game without
powers and you don't have and you don't
have to do many oh so
many so
many you don't even have to do many
modifications
to H crash three to make it play 100
perable without power
okay hello okay sorry um I need to read
the chat
more
uh I never even touch the relics until I
get the shoes though oh yeah I mean yeah
yeah the the relics you can I need you
can still abuse it with like the slide
spin thing but I said without abusing
and yeah the the relics if you really
want gold you need the speed shoes but I
think that's kind of more the
exception I I I feel like the speed
shoes are only designed for the uh time
trials they're not they're not designed
to be actually used
to to solve any of the
levels if that makes
sense um I am by oh wait I'm go go here
I by no means a speedrunner but if I
were ever going to attempt to run I it
might be crashed too I do want
to I get to that
one do you want to do a speedrun off
crash
three the insane
Trilogy go you can't going giveing me
the G
here he was that one of the blue ones I
really hope so because
I it kind of forces you to activate all
the blue
ones as long as you're not like
where did he go now there he is long as
you're not in a hurry and just press the
red button
immediately you should do
fine there you go
and then I assume I'm going to push him
in this he comes back
normal throw away game kind of soling
itself at the moment um
helloo I like games like that it gives
you lots of things to do after you
get like my fav I mean yeah yeah like my
favorite game every night and I like
playing the game 100% secet without
getting any Force powers
yeah I like I like being able
to that's why I like Spyro one because
it has it doesn't have a requirement for
you to complete every single level like
SP 2 and spell like spy 2 and
three meaning that you could do
different kind of
challenges how Ain it rumor is you two
CHS got your Ms and some treasure and I
want to that part I have no idea what
you just
said come on that was at
least easy to
understand he wants that treasure that
everyone has heard about but I don't
know I thought that was going to be do
some cool moves here to avoid that but
nope didn't even need to just need to
run running a circle this is how you
defeats like a lot of bosses in this
game I probably should
oh or maybe I should B slam
it right oh am I'm supposed to tricking
into shooting
okay and then I should for time okay I
see I see it's a bit more than just
running in a second
then oh I'm supposed to attack
him there was a step two to this
part there we go oh it play
Far okay now oh now there's something
different now I can't just run in a
second now I can you stand still is he
going to do one where he shifts
level sling works
too
we
who oh it change direction
oo what what's with me it just goes up
and down
and ow I got hit by
it whoa whoa what was
that I'm a little M Madeo evil again
wait when did it turn
good he was evil in Crash
three and this is
like cuz I only know he's good in Crash
it's about
time which does not include this game in
it's Chron chronology is that the
correct
word it whater this is that jump rope
when he came from Mario Party yeah with
the
Flames
who whoop whoop oh come on I guess I got
a challenge
okay one last attempt and then I had to
restart the whole level
because that's how this game
works see oh no disappointment
bunny
flaming the top of his
head fin got a little too
hot when p p gets too
hot oh no no no no
stop why why why is he so good all of a
sudden no
I'm rash has given up he's not dead he's
just he just gave up too
hard no not that
way oh there is actually a checkpoint
here what is the price
I fell off the
level 600 points well
spent hey you didn't even shoot the
correct
spot
I'm I'm ready cool cool with on
the
thing
oh okay and then this one I still
haven't Sol this third
face
I is well on the
first
like I don't I don't understand
it I don't understand what I'm supposed
to
do
he makes
noise how many stages four because he
has four has
points
that was stage two phas two level two
part
two
oh my well in this case there is no
extra lives because I'm only going to
start over from the start when I die
anyway pleas one
done
go an actual tricky boss
battle well I crawled away from kit B it
does not require you much to get away
from that attack
apparently
how am
I go on for so long and it's so hard to
get away from probably not hard to get
away
from for
me oh close one so close I
died that's go called too
close it's certainly tricky and also on
the second side phase it does like up
and down
somehow but I don't see any indication
that's the
case
okay mean this
works then give away from this
one
okay now phase four which hopefully is
the last
one yeah there's the
one oops move too
close
oh then need
that yeah let's
go go go P
Pon with
no yeah I messed
up need the pom
p with the pom
poms okay now I know what to
do
then crash contemplates in his life
choices
again yeah yeah he definitely made the
wrong choices he's just sad he's
depressed did I turn off the show before
leaving the house to
die
I know crash I think you forgot that do
you think he knows how to use a stone do
you think he has a
stove time to go back to crash T 3 to
check if there's a stove in the
house it's very intense
music really fits the intense
B
he doesn't step he just slides in
CLE there this
one so there you
go time for the last phase what he does
that up
down which I mention like
have
de okay okay okay this time this time
I'll do
it
nice I do damage anyway trying to avoid
it but it was unavoidable was
avoidable that was just
bad w why are you moving this
way have a FR
time
okay there we go final
face face three
done am to jumped over
what now game such
ching
oh that didn't
counts one down
again
oh
makes many
attempts great
stream
again what
happened right I shouldn't duck in this
one oh my
this just
cheating when I step happens that's
come
on prob this time appar ni little bit
heat I
I'm not allowed to jump over it so close
do I need to keep a
distance have I not figured out of
WR but I know I jumped over
it quite close I need that several times
I
now I need switch see this time I could
jump over it I don't I don't know I
switch Direction all of a
sudden which messed everything
up and I would have survived that game
cheap before needed to put food away
okay
now I can jump over just
F I need to D
jum I
maybe might is starting to get with this
thing
G
and just can't see
anyone we go and then want this
thing around so fast I can actually
to
go and then final
face then comes the part that just don't
know how to CU every attempt I do to
avoid
this
well almost went into the fire
again oh how I guess I wasn't enough
and a big
fire
w a new
trick is a very quick I could B react to
it when
one more
try than
two
all right
this getting what I'm supposed to
do and then use this I just need to run
run run
run un as it decides to change direction
all of a sudden
not
that then big
fires and final
peace
last we playing like
fin hopefully I can complete
this then I should go and
get then
fire keep an eye she doesn't turn around
all of a
sudden that
yeah don't want to re this whole
face and there we
go crush your
sleeves and I don't even get a save
point after all of that just a boring
old
checkpoint of Bri standing
around oh I'm
out I'm
free
there
uh save
this oh yeah is up okay there must
certainly be a way
to to make the ball bounce
up oh yeah you can't chy to make it
bounce
up you have to like slow physic engine
or something
whoa whoa whoa
whoa it St to turn into the
basketball I guess I they really
really it's like playing playing
football on the moon
hey excuse
me that wasn't too far from
doing like how you how how is a human
supposed to do
this
I miss it I had to restart my FC
H yeah you did Miss to defeat I'm back
and I guess I missed to
send this send key to
l oh yeah
okay so yeah say something need two
three
so
now I get
my so I guess you beat dingodile now you
see I gave up now I actually didn't beat
I would never give up on a game oh wait

but not the way I want it to bounce
maybe I can shoot it I guess yeah I'm
not I'm not getting this
work oh well I guess I'm
not is this leading to any why why
trying to attack that one
anyway it doesn't lead
anyway did I manage to activate it
without realizing it I must have because
it doesn't have the explanation point on
it
anymore I'll I'll take it that's I count
it as a
success can I guess there's a green gem
there can I access it from
here jump no h that just just evil I'm
not sure how what what I'm supposed to

hard to
jump there is no double jamp this is a
regular
CH there know how to double
