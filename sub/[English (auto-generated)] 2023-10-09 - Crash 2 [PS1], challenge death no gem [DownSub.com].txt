[Music]
W no
speaking I think they introduc speaking
the side game and then they kept it in
the
[Music]
remake Crash Bandicoot 2 Vortex Strikes
Back
I mean I said from that
voice the voice is very
bored like we we need someone to do the
voice okay I'll do
it I'll do my least
effort rabbit
SED C doesn't sound to have
question
[Music]
now about to finish my
burer cold hard crash this is going to
be an annoying
one but I don't remember which gem it is
in this level and if I have it
already singing like blue or green I
should possibly be able to do
it let's first check which gem
is so mag to crash
it's been a
while oh it didn't give me the
fruits
so I'm getting used to this
one
somewhere
oh yeah and then I need
to that is
possible here we go let
me let me go okay let's see where is the
oh no it's the death R that's what it
is and I don't think there's a gem on
this
okay well in that
case wait I should have
finished should have finished the
[Music]
level I had many different
oh no wait I need something to drink
sorry I'm so
disorganized sorry I got something
drinking out
there
and I and I do realize I said I will be
back will like obviously I
will I mean he had his last word last
World the Dominate domination plan by
some mut supposed be band
good yeah yeah yeah sport for the for
the win level why
not to be fair both of the alternative
outfits aren suited for a winter level
and I the um
dress so fair enough okay first thing I
would do no no no
okay first thing I would do is is die
five
PS oh you can stand there okay actually
let me take that can you just keep this
all kind of kind of you can skip most of
that most of it because I'm dying
[Music]
anyway oh you can stand up here it's
actually quite uh interesting how much
of the geometry in the original crash
games you can stand on if you can just
walk
across come on there we go
anyway I died six times now so they have
like
higher you need die like seven times
before it get mask okay okay so that
means I start my mask and I will pick up
that that should make things I don't
know but as far as I know you cannot
start with more than one
MK
so I've seen someone die over and over
again oh that was
close and I have to do the bonus but
that's no
problem well it actually might be a
problem
let me check the
bonus oh the bonus is lagging for
sure don't think this is a too tricky of
a
bonus now this is a very simple bonus at
least the other ice level has a much
trickier bonus than this they just
thrown around a lot of TNTs but that's
about doesn't really make the bonus hard
then I need this can I nope that was not
possible to
do there we go and there we go and yes I
have died it really shouldn't count as a
death they have fixed that in the third
crash but this crash which I've learned
through throughout this game play does
count deaths starting from the start as
death which is kind of weird because the
first crash did not do that the third
crash does not do that but the second
crash do count those Sy
thing
so then I just have to go through here
that was pretty
simple if I'm quick enough I can take it
out but if I'm doing this no death run I
should probably be more careful you
know for some reason they have these
here that I get this
way and I don't get
why and if you found one of them it's
not really hard to find the rest of
them they do jump like the n
jumps in this game but they barely does
do a jump like point but if you compare
that to the Remake in the remake they
can jump as high as crash so you
canot then I need to get that somehow
they can jump as high as crash so
sometimes you can just randomly lose lot
of sheer
unluckiness okay this doesn't seem to to
be too hard
nothing hidden so I don't lose on
that how many tries do you think this
will
take the teally not died yet so I mean I
can still pick up the
Crystal but I
could
yeah another checkpoint here interesting
choice oops that was a waste of a
mask I don't start with two mask now I
think I should start with two mask I
think that's how it works look at they
keep how many MK I have now and then
just add plus one because I should start
with a
MK welcome back thank you something else
might also be making bonus hard
excuse
me hey you're early I'm going to do cold
heart crash no this are you
ready this is going to be a
challenge how
many I should have started
[Music]
this
[Music]
let's do
that feel free to take part in the
prediction I will uh I guess play the
level and you're allowed to do the
prediction now if you want no what
didan just
disappeared
so in the meantime let me just put away
the plate stuff from when I ate sorry
foray I just need to warm up for
[Music]
level
[Music]
[Music]
there you go there you go
up good me bir yeah okay now we got few
people take take part in the prediction
how many times will I die trying
to uh 100% call our crash without
dying there we go got the
submission I will start playing the
level and you are allowed to put in more
prediction until I die the first time or
you know complete level whichever it
is and
[Music]
then and then you're not allowed to
usually I like to don't no longer accept
them when I start level but I should
have started fiction
before uh
so want a mission but let's go I do have
the quick but quick quick button here to
press if I fail H with the exception if
I don't start with two mask I do have to
redu the level to get two mask
now yeah I good two mask I remember how
the game was then good this means I can
do my challenge immediately cuz of
course I will start with two
M and yeah completely level 100% as I
said that means every single
box
and it without dying which I also
stained a box wasn't so first segment
out of I guess you could
five
done I would say six segment
then section two pre
bonus H I'll just
SP standing on the box that's not
allowed
segment to pre bonus complete bonus
time we not on the winner who gets
10,000
cars what it's 10,000 not like
100,000 oh
on want to
see so far the level is easy the hardest
part have not yet come
up I don't think I need extra
lives I don't think I should jump on
these let just jump on that let's check
this not Al
now everything's gone good
good
everything gone perfect segment three
done now I'm my, K I spent half a year
collecting them that's
true that is
true okay I'm not going to take a risky
I'm going to let it
run
she
flashes
here interesting look the game is buggy
so section 4 done now section five which
is the hardest of and I would
think no I I'm not play yet but it
definitely makes it
harder didn't mean to jump up all the
way but I saved
it okay so I got my double mask done I
wish I got the triple mask
here something I should have checked
just forgot to
check
yes this means that if I'm speeding I
can just do that and land probably I can
do it
correctly yeah I mean the
most plushy fun pun off first skill here
yeah I certainly do that
see if I have the skills
required oh that was close just at the
end of the
animation yeah showed off my skills by
running into that
Nitro oh no oh no oh
no
nope that was a
fail one thank you for keeping
track that means I still need to go and
pick up a mque so I can try again
yeah I
can what that that does that doesn't
count because I'm not start restarted
level yet there still
one that I need to start with two mask
no it's not two I have not started
started L
it how about just me being
stupid I just I need to get a second
mask I need to get one mask at least
here we go problem is ah get me too
problem is I need to get to to go I
should have picked up the checkpoints
then I'll do it next time I'll I'll pick
up this checkpoint next time so I can
get through the gold
quickly boom goes the Bandit
yep move
forward this game is so buggy cuz it it
has the same ISS as
in oh no there should be another mask
right
right there is another mask otherwise I
have to chase it at the end of the
level there will be a mask at the
end one way or
another
close with that porcupine
yeah I will not risk it like that when I
do the real
run just need to get to the end with a
mask can we get that one I'm here
they're not not getting distracted by it
on R Run Okay does not seem to be a
MOS one
there's one way to force a
mask it costs five lives no seven lives
but I can make one
appear and in for future attempts it's
going to be even quicker because it
should remember how many MK start with
[Music]
here
[Music]
and the game is none the wiser thank
you
finally the annoying part of this run is
to restart the
level if if game G me two M that's the
start of the level instead just one this
wouldn't be as
annoying I'm distracted by cute fluffy
bunny tummy
understandable very
understandable but the timer is up do
you want to redeem another outfit before
I before I start run you know so I'm not
distracted by uh what half
redeem there we
go run two so still W
this this time I'm try to not lose the M
the first thing I
do in the same cuz that would make
things
[Music]
easier and now I know how the thing
works
too now now to be destroyed by fluffy
bunny
thighs that's
true P Pon got those
[Music]
thighs who that wasn't the way I wanted
to kill
so segment two done on to segment three
which is pretty easy bo
bo bo
bo which which is a complicated one
because I shouldn't have said death I
should said fails on the challenge
because if I die in a bonus that's not a
death but it's a fail well it's not a
fail
technically I will still continue I
guess then because if I die on the bonus
I will lose the mask which I don't want
to
29 boing the boxes segment be
done no that was a
f there we go
and next Super
mask carefully jumping off those and
this I'll pick this
[Music]
up so the bonus does count as Das for
the challenge now I'll just continue
challenge it's going to be really hard
if I die because I will lose my mask but
I'll still I'll still attempt the
challenge I will not just give up it
wouldn't be the right thing to give
up
so yeah though they don't count just
like I don't they don't count for the
just as they don't count for I know
that's the challenge I did I just not
count
them I think that's the best way I'll
just go I'll just continue on with
11 as
a there's two oh my that was just still
me I still ended up after there and I
didn't want to and I I must do think one
way
better why can't spin on boxes and then
don't don't get
stri
uh well I just have to get to the end of
level again I can retry
it
in case I
die I what I I don't know what I should
do is after I die on I going guess I can
do it next
time
no
not
far is dying on the first checkpoint I
spawn at after failing Challenge and I
can just die like seven times from that
one and start with a
mask right
away I don't get any masks from that
point
forward
there we go there's my
mask that was an intentional
T but this isn't the runs doesn't
count because I did say that how many
that's on Challenge on C no I actually
Road on cold h okay technically root
but I did also say that was in attempt
to do 100% on the level and I can't do
the 100% of level if I'm have
died but I mean I've died two times
already so I'm hungry but I at all my oh
no this is doing with the stream
[Music]
now it's messing with
my not cres
what okay attempt
three I
[Music]
one why do you keep missing
boxes
no lost all
momentum go go go well sounds like you
need to buy two
back e less
lower W that was
close it's fine if I lose like mask now
that that I can
do compl area two complete
wait 30 wait how is it 30 this time
um so every previous attempt 100% it was
a
failure this is
weird it's supposed to be 30 not 29
so I gu three done for real this
time
previous times it was
not because yeah this mask here giving
me a triple mask I really don't need it
because this segment here is so short
until I reach
de like it's just this one and this one
and then I'm
here so segment four done
that's I must just some Mr Box every
time
before go go
go
go okay let's see if I
can do this without
Dy
there we
go
forward I could
jump oh I count 100% in one round
because I have the Jem there
oops
well I'll do the hard challenge first
and
regardless well I guess the challenge
required to
runs that's news to that's kind of part
of the prediction you know
and sometimes uh you
uh uh you can't predict everything if
someone knew that that was the case then
congratulations to you I I
didn't forgot about
it because I can't get both box Gem and
that extra gem at the same time I must
choose I can't I can't do that H I'm
fine
bir BX
set
so this still have one mask so should
probably keep it for TNT thingy no n
thingy all let's back
this I'm being very careful
now even though I can basically fly
through this part without taking
damage pressure is on me you
know
P got blown and you're laughing at
that that
penguin oink
oink miss it
oink
oink
okay
scary okay I'm approaching
that that one now here it
is
no
problem here some
simple carefulness and you get
it nothing stupid now
please
jump
over you
38 did you turn
around approach
[Music]
you wasn't what was
up I see apparently not good at this i w
that
worked really
really ah
failure I'm a
failure
welcome back yeah I no idea what
happened there he just decided to
disconnect while I still had internet
and I could still chat with everyone so
it wasn't like I lost internet twitch
just decided to disc obvious or
something so weird when that
happens
when I have not started the new run yet
so yeah I think I didn't destroy the
green thing I SK a bunch of places
too
okay soon your timer is over do you want
to redeem another
out okay what is this attempt four
because I died three
times three failed attempts attempts
four
hey okay back to
sports this is only
Subs starting first
menu I was but did nothing
happen
[Music]
guess we should try to keep numbers on
each segment 22 second one
done like cute love bunny
tummy I'm going to check my posture when
no one else is
doing
that was
one same two
27 wait a
minute that's I thought this was more
than I thought it was supposed to be
30
okay everything
gone I missed this one before no I think
I jumped on that
one and because it disconnected and
reconnected this place adds quite early
on it's supp play during the
countdown
I really thought this was supposed to be
30 but like 30 before the bonus 30 off
bonus yo I hope we don't have a bunch of
ads it is Crash indeed why did it spin
on hello Pon hello your
hero welcome I am doing a challenge run
I assume yir has ter or something
spoiler yo the challenge run is I
should get through the whole level get
the gems of the levels without dying I
can't get bow
that's
oops did that again but I'm not giving
up that's not how that's not how AR crat
breaks game is
buggy am I supposed to get that on
now why not like that
then
yeah they I mean this a de is a still
even though the game kind of cheated on
me there like destroy the Ares without
my
permission let me set up H set let me
set a mask
here so I
[Music]
can for com because I probably we go I
probably F future DRS let me set them
off that too just for
convenience or I can stand on
it
boom Lally you should be able to slide
into the them in the face but cuz they
don't have spikes in the face they have
in the back but not the
face unlucky Pony Pon I'm not a pony I'm
a bunny bunny
Bon great stream uh I just come to say
what uh what's
good hope you have a great stream yes
thank you for calling by even if it's a
short time I appreciate it
give give me some motivation in this
this hard times like cold heart
crash when I'm done with this level
I'm
I need to go sleepy okay good night I
crush is a pain yeah
well that was a silly mistake of me he
is to EAS see that's why I'm doing this
challenge
playing
Dan there we
go yeah and then I we get my mouth back
even though I try to
make make it more
convenient
CU this is nothing stupid up here oh so
close nope did you put that like an
extra life something
he I more players for discovering such
things how's the crash going could have
gone
better
so I've died four times trying to do
this challenge so this is around fif
fifth
five but welcome in
haris it has been empty with
that we go that's every
box
[Music]
[ __ ] four [ __ ] four 22 in sish it's
should 22 boxes of segment
one
okay 27 boxes of segment of segment 2 i
s about 30 but I guess I can't
count but I can do basic mathat though I
guess I can't
count
yeah that doesn't work can do
that everything
[Music]
gone it must been that one I missed a
few times not really sure how I thought
I got
that
s segment three
done
I mean yeah I said I could just take the
risk and attack that
because I would regain the mask here
immediately anyway I really don't need
the double triple mask
here two after the fourth segment
wa 1 2 3 4 yeah think that's
fine
go okay can I do this correctly this
time there we go that's how you do it I
still had mtion for even though I waited
for I don't know how
[Music]
long no forward forward forward
[Music]
forward okay yeah
no stupid mistakes this time this is a
huge middle
finger no mistak this time s box no
mistake
okay there we
go
okay good momentum
here no I did that
again Oops I did it again but it's not
like the lack of mask made me made an
issue for me it was I fell down a
hole 9 fire boxes after
that I didn't mean to spin on that
one I was just in a spinning
mood
I'm being careful
now G so they'll be deliver tomorrow oh
so we're on five now or still four do
you count it four and you count them
correctly as far as I know so this is
attempt five that means I have I died
four
times so it's a currently a four that
counts to to the
prediction
oops oh
nice nice
nice
come on
spin don't want
any stupid things to
happen
I wonder if you're like supposed to jump
over them or something now I don't think
you can jump over
them I think this droup is too low for
that same meant six or something done
1372 I
meant
come with you
you
go over you wait for you to face
away so we don't see
me well I guess that
worked no
secrets there we
go I don't remember how many boxes was
supposed to
be doesn't matter I don't need
it
wa I think this layout is like very
similar to the O eyes level which
requires you to hit like a secret
thinging yeah I like it
first4 what's it4 on this
level
nope I missed the
Box oh where is the missing
box oh they
sink what no but okay well that was a
fail because I didn't get the
but where can
they really where where's the missing
box I like I got every box nice that was
exactly what I
wanted cuz there's no box there there's
these two boxes oh want
checkpoint
um not that bad game come on
game
I'm so
confused yeah oh I got the M from here
too well thank you
game that means I don't need to die
seven times or six times more well where
oh come on I did complete the challenge
but I still missed the
wait where is the missing
box okay was my timer up that's was
confusing oh oh
my yeah I'm not doing poster check but
already
yeah
speaking of uh
unpredicted unpredictive things during
the run this sure is one where is the
mixing box should I look that up or
should I try again and try again and try
again until I achieve
Madness that's
what I thought I checked
everything
oh I
see ibly never have figure out though I
I took a sneak peek prob out
side now there are ah I should prob fig
it out but
still is I I have known about that box
before because I picked it up
before um when I played through the game
on
the
Remake but then I just forgot about
it
is that stupid box hey I think it
because the Remake tells me how many
boxes there in bonus I would have
realized that I miss the
Box my girl bonus has 31 boxes not
30 getting 29 was already
wrong
27
27
okay there it
is how we of the game to put one
day
any1
H and one the that I do like with the
mirror is that the object in the mirror
is actually mirrored because technically
it's not a mirror it's just a glass with
the same object
behind did I seriously do
that
one that was death
six and you know what that
means the prediction is over and we have
a
winner congratulations Jano you win
you win 10,000 cat Coins Plus your 1,000
predicted we
B
congratulations
yeah I didn't pay attention to the scene
oh leing
me my Thal infinite chance of victory
yeah yeah I wanted like at least one
options to be a a
winner could just
continue
well I'll just have to do another
try even though the prediction is over
this challenge run is
not
pleasee me
stuck yes he yes exp have an infinite
number and land on
where yeah I mean I get that but
like depending on which what challenge I
do it it's not likely most likely to
happen
anyway yes because it has an infinite
number doesn't mean it's the most likely
to
happen because it starts from six and
then goes to Infinity there's still a
range there which has a chance of
appearing so you don't have an infinite
chance of winning like that that theory
is
incorrect so it
yeah he's not doing a challeng run yet
so wait where's my
checkpoint it turned it into a
checkpoint when I backtrack I think just
was
interesting you really think I don't
know
that I don't
know I will not
you I will not ask you what you know and
don't
[Music]
know plus uh everything I said is not
exactly directed to you um even it was
something something you said right and
because it can also be like what people
in in
general do you know people in general if
you
have an infinite range of numbers but it
doesn't cover every number but it has an
infinite number of numbers because
that's how infinite work infin
works it still doesn't have the it's not
a guarantee that it will happen cuz it
still has the range which doesn't
cover yeah I'm on another run now
anyway oh no I F
to all right let's see if I can do this
then yeah I saved
it hey elyn hey Panda wait what's your
name I
haven't I'm not sure oh my my
voice I'm not sure if you've told
that I mean if it's not
like Al or
something I'm not even sure if you say
this
Al 12 I guess that's correct number
yeah hey not yeah
but hey
hey as long as I get so one at the
end there we
go she over analyzes
everything okay she over analyes
everything tell her a joke and she
explain to you everything iny the joke
exactly so yeah so it's not because I
don't believe you don't know it's just
that I just like to ni stuff it's just
who I
am yeah can't take my good time
here because I'll lose the double mask
as soon as I step on this
thing as soon as I ride with this
thing
look the texture is mirror in here and
then it still flashes because it's still
active like don't know it's probably not
active
but the flashing is
active you're
adorable I'm glad
you no no no no no no
no this for some reason this box up
there but there's a mask but it does not
show up picture of a
mask I I saved it this
time no try to slide but it was bounced
up going to help
[Music]
me
definitely
definitely more friction in this game
than in the
remake which does
help
oh now you said oh oh
oh there we
go oh oh
oh I need my nice back I actually have
more lives now than I had when I started
the
challenge I started with 9
and like and even before I set up the
challenge because I spent Seven Lives to
even start with that single
Mas oh
no come
in oh well I tried to be careful but
instead I lost the musk anyway so much
for being
careful the ability to the
anyway not that I said not that I need a
mask but I guess good thing to have just
in
case D
go and let's destroy everything here
blow up the
TNT only 90 90
what I completely got what I was talking
about blow up a
penguin 90 lives oh yeah yeah yeah I
started with 90
and now I got
92 oh what did I collide
with think get buggy or
something let me one
here
yeah the game is buggy yeah the game is
buggy this game is
buggy yeah gu thing I had mask there got
dist disted by that bug in
game
to not life past yeah I've lost M two
Liv since I
started since the start of the
game GRE Weir par
there okay can I complete the
challenge
w at least you don't need to kill the
enemies
they like inspired you need to kill
enemies to get the gems Inspire one and
three at
least
wait apparently his hand does
not do the attack
thing go so there's the last fire boxes
they are visible oh I want to strike the
penguin oh the penguin is about to
start three more one more and that's the
fth Box how many boxes in this
level and here we go I got the gem
without dying
wo now I just need to get that on the
gem at least that one's
easier cuz I only need to pick it up
before dying which was the
room I can't say but I mean like if if
if it were so that the progress were to
be
lost I've technically still done the
challenge I can still pick it up without
doing the challenge if that makes
sense
now for the nonbox
[Music]
gam yes you can complete the challenge
not completed
[Music]
yet yeah then I lost the mask Das not
starting with the double mask oh a
simple
mask so now I have to do this section
without a t mask oh
no
there's open ceiling here cuz he fell
down way too quickly
there we oh I stood on the metal
Cate yeah meure how long it takes for
him to fall
down definitely a ceiling in the sky
which doesn't make
sense if it was reality
I wonder if you sp than remake one more
things to
compare well so far no this like how it
should be oh still very close to that
one why didn't I even pick up the boxes
there by the way
um I'm not even here to pick up the
boxes I'm just here to pick up a
Chan
I'm only here at qu
gem which does not involve picking up
boxes and after I get this gem the level
has been 100% oh what are you waiting
for H the level has been completed
100% all here for a death run gem yep
come
on I had my chance last time I just
going to come
on no come
on oh oh now I don't need the double
musket that Lev fine without
it that's another
death
200% in the
[Music]
level I'm I hope I hope everyone is
enjoying the time here when I'm strong
with this
level hey I've only been playing for 37
minutes
yeah it's not
like the game had any issues or
so I mean the stream not the game the
game I haven't had have quite a few
issues
already on my final run that was going
to do the Box just show decid to not
show up for a
while
yeah can't stand on those boxes that's
not how crash
works yeah that wasn't the way I
was
Ling
so I don't really need the double musk
thing
anyway wao careful
there you almost hit
me there you go oh he stopped no I
didn't kind of stopped but then it
went hry hurry hurry why there we go now
I
landed I don't need to take out all
these
okay
boom got to the other
Gem and yeah when you drop down from
there in the death route you land
directly on the final segment so you're
missing a segment that's why you have to
backtrack you also have to backtrack you
too so this is why this one level is the
most annoying you're like you do the
death rout no like first first you
complete the
level and oh no they're B missing boxes
that must be in the death R I guess I
have to do that one
then then you do the death
route and I like I'm still missing still
missing
boxes and and then or maybe you pay
attention like H there's a a wi frame
box here I need the explanation point
let's go through the Des and see it oh
there it is at the end of it well I fell
down so I missed it and now I have to
redo the whole
level and then you do it and then you
manage to get it and then you backtrack
to get the box and then okay let's go to
to the end end of the D and finish off
the D and then go to the end of level wa
I'm still missing boxes what's going
on there we go finally the level is
100% so if then you may figure out oh
wait when I finish death route I'm get
I'm ending up in a different location
than if I skip the death route okay so I
back after backtrack I take the platform
back and then continue the level as
normal and then you do that and you're
still missing a box
unless you're playing the the Remake
where it shows you that you're missing a
box in the in the Bon
11 but yeah I did it I did it oh so many
times it took so long time it
took 1 hour 18 minutes okay what's your
can you see something secret over
there
then what's the deal with this now
nothing it TR makes interesting
noises
so six boxes
w
no monkey
died really
monkey this just a regular level we have
any strange on
it oh
no now there it's a Green platform on
it wait where do I end up when I take
them oh like where do I end up when I
finish this
segment
yeah
oh the rain is loud in it's
[Music]
l
on is that just me when it's Lou rain
loud
can you hear me over the
[Music]
rain oh wait there
are there are no boxes on this
part R is
back
Jam got it without
dying now I probably missed the large
section of the level so I probably have
to redo it for the de box
[Music]
gem yeah 14 boxes yeah I'll I I the LEL
boxum yeah this is the end of
now and 84 levels yeah 84 levels 84
boxes going to the exit with the triple
mask no I want to war with it I can hear
you yeah I really need to pay attention
to what it says up there as I can see
oh and there is two gems so there must
be something special with it okay box
gem
time and this level is so much easier
than the previous
level celebration around fa bunny yeah
you've seen those uh yeah you you've
been here when someone posted those
bouncy
SC I really need to make like a bouncy
barel bunny
she can do like bounces doing the
bouncing but being like IND different
about she does it because she has to not
because she wants
to Monkey
di
[Music]
wa
yeah Miss see bonus and
[Music]
everything is that cortex castle in the
background no not this
level this level can be so
buggy
yeah this part can be actually
buggy it doesn't matter for me because
of got the death in bonuses don't
[Music]
count
[Music]
Fair P Pon bouns yes you yeah because I

[Music]
aome egg
welcome welcome egg welcome
Raiders here we playing some crash
2 and
I let's introduction I'm really mad at
raiding being raided I am and I'm bad at
this game I am pon pon the bon
bon I playing a lot of PlayStation One
games in recent
recently H ho thank you for
reading oh no
on should do the SL
out and not flash rain as I accidentally
did
once
that was a silly mistake of me
so what are you up to and how did your
stream
go than Dark Souls
remastered I hope it went well I hope
you made some
progress and the game
wasn't treating you
bad did you did you have a blanket on
while you're
playing I can can I can just imagine you
sitting there with a
blanket Co being coy coy
gaming hope car are doing well going
well here I did complete like the
hardest challenge in crash two so far so
I'm happy about
that 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10
taada it went well I did the game in one
stream oh the whole game yes
believe so wait how long were you
streaming
for one hour use a shot
game
this was the Cold Heart have you played
crash 2 before you might know about cold
heart
crash I did it it took me like 10
[Music]
attemps very nice the first stream was
about 6 hours and I am dream so I'm
going to have some
donuts and light that yeah you you take
your
rest I usually only game for 3 hours
so and I did this the first time the
first stream of this this challenge run
I'm doing right now I did six hours and
I and I was
tired at that
point so I can
understand how tired you must be
the do
rest oh that was
dangerous
oh 7 I don't remember how I need
to so now let's see if I can land on
this
one good good like why doesn't this one
have a
box
oops that much I was supposed to
do was it
84 yes who a jam without dying as the
title said death is no Gem and the
technical rules are if I die bonus death
does not count then I cannot pick up a
gem if I already picked up a gem I get
to keep it this is how Crush one works
even though Crush one as that R
regarding keys but I'll following that R
so I don't actually have to reach the
end without dying with the gem but I can
just not pick it up if I died
once also apparently the ra didn't end
the Stream So I was live for a while
after joining you yeah yeah it is this
the first time you raid by the
way yes he tried and exhausted because
yeah when you ra it does not end your
stream because raiding and streaming are
raiding is a twitch thing and streaming
is not Twitch streaming to twitch but
twitch does not control your stream so
you have to end the end you have to end
the stream
manually first time e yeah there was
like I didn't know exactly how it worked
first time
right but it makes sense that twitch
can't control your stream
SE something I don't know it's
fine but everyone is
one what you can't spin the bees can't
spin this
bees okay here's the thing this box here
when you play the Remake it's
need whoops
it's
be L this that means I
cannot uh get the box gem wait just this
level 20 it shouldn't be any strange
with this level it should just be a no
no it contains two gems you know what I
will try to get the color J
first which is probably a death
route I'll focus on that one and after
getting it I can see what requires what
would be required for me to get the box
J I think that sounds like a good
ide I wonder the SP
is be boxes
boxers no but yeah how get get time you
stay as long as you want leave if you
need
to don't feel pressured to be
here I
I you can spin them and you can can I
plan to stand on them
too but yeah don't feel pressure to be
here but but yeah of
course oops but of course do you love it
when you're here okay I can still go and
check I can't pick it up the gem I could
my rule but just like in CR one I can
still play the level and even if I can't
pick up the
gem so I can see what is
like what is required for
it when do I think in Crash one you can
actually pick up like Keys even if you
die so technically I should be able to
pick up nonbox CHS while still dying but
I'm actually making this challenge
harder than the was in Crash
one I should go on ground a bit more
often I
think head of K thank you for being here
have a have a good
time
bye-bye Crush dug his own
grave kind of yeah technically
yes oh yeah yeah there's this also look
at this un supicious
boxes whoa whoo whoo
is this where I get
the jam
from yes it
is so now that
I now that I pick okay I can't pick it
up because I'm
di
okay
I'm good as well take care and take
coffee goodbye egg thank you for eting
and have a nice day have a nice
rest have a good
time have have an EG time excellent
time
[Music]
yeah I should be more careful so here's
fine this this part that should
be be out foul
Beast
so I kind of need to get
the I got the box get to the Box jam and
the pur like kind of at the same
[Music]
time I knew you would
come evil
Beast could see be in real life on this
even well not well yeah they not that
evil they they can be
evil he sees a someone crawling under
ground must must smash it with time
me
think when you finish this level you
should work
back pick up these
first in case I'm working back a with
for and I think there should be boxes
here if there are no boxes here then I
it's easier to not you know do this but
I think
here
oh okay let me check the box
hand where did I
respawn I
what it doesn't really matter I still
need to reach the gem I need to pick up
the gem before I die anyway yeah you're
supposed to defeat those things before
you jump up to next platform but
apparently I could jump up to next PL
one
anyway excellent foul Beast
y h
foul f o WL I think it's that's like a
bird which adds a bit to the pun because
beats are not Birds but Beast flies like
bird so there's like a connection like
that
[Music]
can I do this nope still can't do
it
w oh I want enough FL
to chain
here what what of
one who where did they come
from come very
quickly this
music oh I wasn't picking
up foul
yes it's foul not F or something like f
is f o
a
is this level going to be harder than
cold hard
crash where is sh I'm playing
CR one here it
is
should
well there might be a death route but
whatever I can still pick up the purple
G answer playing now
inad
a oh
okay let's restart now instead because
that was a complete fa I should just go
around
it B does not run with
bow
okay foul does not with bone yeah I
don't like English
spelling I I said that before
and apparently I don't like this
level and
I my nose is
itchy that be is
left B did not want to be part of that
why know what happen bounc over the
bo okay there's any more up here there
you go finally got it
woo no they do not
I not this
[Music]
Throne oh now they were
Oh yay I got the
life
okay I'm going need to time this
b w excuse me that's just
cheating come on the be are cheating
now
H stupid
beans
there
you oh where did that jump come from
yeah going to say here what that in the
remake and that that the N around that
box will blow up the
box but in this original game when you
destroy the green question mark
block it does not explode the ne it will
simply just remove the ne from
L even though every box should
technically have some kind of ID con
related to it
so
H when you destroy the the exclamation
box it should
also because it removes the it should
also remove the boxes around
them that makes
sense being careful now
okay I don't know if there's box here
but
oh
my you know
what that was a slow
animation that was a quick one andu one
I
touched just let me squish crash
instead much
quicker
okay even though I did die from falling
there we
go I'm also DED by other
stuff have tired I'm tired of dying
I will start level with a double
[Music]
mask on ground is kind
of
oh I didn't destroy
anything now that's
challeng awesome
Yep that is what I'm
doing welcome swiy
Changas swiy
swiy but the problem is I keep dying so
I'm not doing the challenge that
well when I did
complete speaking of dying when I did
complete cold heart crash 100% so
behaving seems to be a harder level
people speak of cold heart crash being a
hard level they haven't Tred behaving
somebody have struggle with this
level
yeah
that's that's the feeling right
now well maybe more
like FAL bunny
feelings
great welcome Greg and gers Greg and
company gers but what's your community
called
G welcome Benny welcome
Jessica I hope flock or fell FL right
right
there welcome Greg and the flock there
you
go now I remember now I remember because
you
told
so let
do the J at this
one so has Sparkle Sparkle fell oh you
wrote it there too I didn't read
your broadcastter for month subscrib
mon you covered
everything he I'm we going to cover the
H traffic it's perfect it has some humor
to the whole
thing hello FL welcome
Bodil so what what are you up
to PO for I have no idea what that is
you have to tell me what that
is but most of you probably already know
about me pon pon the bon bon most
playing and also because is here I did
cold out crash it was super
easy no problem at
all easy
peasy the level was so easy so the game
tried to cheat
me I activated all for exclamation part
boxes and it only activated three of the
boxes the game start to cheat me that's
how easy level
was
oh Panda you're also here not from the
raid but
welcome we are almost Angelic and we can
take you there wait a
minute
are I'm not sure what you
[Applause]
mean
yeah
boom
boom
okay no well I did we got
with don't even though it's oh nice
[ __ ] okay how was
it there's one
here
wa
close wa that was close
too okay
there's oh that one
jumping jokes don't exist in
Sweden yeah Yokes doesn't exist in
Sweden Yokes don't exist y exactly how
is life it's going great I'm uh I'm
still string
sleeping
but whoops but I'm I'm improving on it
slowly oops well there's a MK here that
means
that there are no boxes in this area oh
no not the not one of
these anyway completed
area [ __ ]
copy
Sweden sometimes SP
Sweden wait did I was I put further back
yes sweet now you WR it sweet then I'm
not allowed to tell jokes here anymore
you are but not like or orian type jokes
well Pon doesn't believe in jokes
exactly please tell him more Pon what
did you do if you're fridge is running
well if it's running it's perfectly fine
that's how it should be and also thank
you for the follow
Villa I hope you have a good time
here here we have silly
moments silly
times just like we
have over at
G different C
oh that was
close that's
silly now you can now you too can use
the kit heart only here sadly but I do
have the uh redeem where you can
pay 100 I think for access to additional
emotes that you can use on any
channel and here too it's very cheap so
and you can GA up
those of first yeah that doesn't count
by the
way also if you manage to fail
oh you manage to fail
this and with a mask which I do have and
fall in between you're not getting up
because these are four blocks high they
fix that in remake by putting two knit
boxes on either side so if you do fail
and fall in the four block box High
for for blck time the walls are lower to
soon so I'm not died yet as far as I
know I guess chat can help
me remember stuff like
that but yeah all hail the long what's a
long
crab what is
hail
it's like some words have not even
thought about
like
putting my my Swedish an knowledge is
limited is this everything
yes what's what's a long
tra hey like the king do we ha the king
in
Sweden is that like
I think we say
like that me
[Music]
just yeah there's not even a Swedish
translation Outland
here crash I have discovered that the
opposition is being masterminded by Dr
nitrus real the inventor of the
there's no Swedish
translation for our misunderstandings in
the past he forced me to assist him in
his plot for world domination he's at it
again that's he will attempt to stand in
our way be on your guard CRA I
understand cortex use the platform to
deliver the crystals to
engine yeah I
guess after after some after some
research there doesn't seem to be any
TSH pH for all H H all you get
like switch
like which long though
not all
whatever using translate not
sish but it didn't give me any there is
no translation I couldn't find a single
translation wiary does not least any
translation
using deep L
for H machine learning translation did
not provide any translation for it I
mean it did trans translate in
nost collect me no I'm not give you the
crystals and also I falling back on
chat so so
yeah and so best I can give a
translation
I don't know what long crab is
so
and customiz life from long crab see no
CH in s yeah
yeah exactly exactly we have very
serious people here in Sweden I'm going
to head after bed good luck B good night
good night Jessica I hope I was not too
late no it
was
goodbye crabs can easily have jokes
withen about them is I want to
translate take care crab imp polish is
crab
yeah okay press and press the attack
button to throw
who comes and we out this
Buton oops I see not
jump
oops if you think people in SW and are D
po p Never Smile oh right I was supposed
to attack I forgot about
that I misjudged it
again again oh I can't slide I can't
jump I can't I can't jump I can't spin I
can't slide why do I have to remove the
slide at least slide does
something yeah that kind of
tells me why I couldn't
do then why I couldn't avoid it because
I didn't have the slide I wanted to
slide under
it here you go do
done okay now moves much
quicking this means
there now it's much harder to hit
smaller targets quicker
movement think
the there's no animation of throwing it
just flies
machine
gun singing
me oh come on I was in the air I was in
the
air
SP I was in the
air there
you
boom
that he excuse me
game
I'm like he
anything there we go
finally
on and then one
rocket who there we
go
okay which is next one this
no okay and then I have
to
there
W will be very displeased with your
resistance you saying how easy crash is
yeah easy easy peasy pish Lev so far has
been behaving not good
why do we come out from that level okay
okay another cut scene why did engine
stick a rocket in your head what reason
they have that Bic I will not ask you
again to bring me the crystals obtain
the remaining five crystals crash and
bring them to me I bring them to me but
I am cortex what's your
problem someone try to take the crystals
from me and defended myself and I'm now
I'm bringing them to you you want to 25
I've only collected 20 so far wait until
I get all of
them I should have all James yep yep p
it
way so engine I think engine just got a
rocket LOD in his
head and his robot is badly built if it
can be destroyed by nothing but
destroy by throwing f it where nothing
was in that
sentence okay what what was this
level is this a annoying
one nice music
and he's Rob bad yeah I that that was
was supposed CU cortex want Dum
crystals Exum crystals I me think
maybe
maybe do you have
some
singing p
p one one one one one one one one one
one yeah that's what they're
saying thank you for agreeing on
that
not me
now but he can probably find
some on the USS
Enterprise good luck getting them
though H ask
nicely it's one one one no it's one one
one one one
what are you talking about this not war
one war
one they are the number
one here we go AR is the D room wa did I
need I needed the all boxes for this
yeah so I need
to a bun
sh
backtracking okay how far for watch the
last
one can
twice not that
one TI the
AG
like
that what's that this last
box now this is the last
box it's safe for me to just
check I can still go check yeah this
should be the last
box I claim it to be the last box I
think I
remember scream and Crystal go
Ching
what
confused not going to go and do the
[Music]
bonus
when you collect the crystal oh oh yeah
so not the the one that goes one one one
one one
one I
see I
understand there C down I need I need
you
oh
okay I well I had the
mask that's
fine 18 boxes I hope
so
no
no technically not a death I don't know
if you like rement count as a death or
not but the game doesn't count as a
death so it isn't a death and crash one
doesn't count as a death I want come
this now follow CR one rules not the
rules what the res is
do we get wait I'm I should have kept
those
boxes so now getting over there would be
tricky I don't know if those boxes would
have
helped I think you should just do this
or something
wow and let me keep those boxes and see
if it
help not destroying
them otherwise I guess I just have to
redo the level
and H keep the mask or something and
wasting another
mask
wait how am I supposed to oh wait I
see like
that
nice it would be nice if I hit it
but like that I wonder if that's the
intended
solution but I will do it as my
solution
doesn't matter what the intend soltion
is as long as I find something that
works that was a bit bit of wrong
direction good thing is this isn't crash
one because that would have been a
this 16 box this in bonus I hope so but
you can collect that
is good say 20 if you accidentally blow
up those
NR and then more
backtracking one one one one one one one
one one
one here we
go it's going good so far I
hope everyone
is this is
actually yeah I like it when it doesn't
show me what's up
ahead
yeah ob one one one one one one one one
canobi
one one one one one1 one one one
one secret
nro well that was
SC
oops oh lucky or skill you
choose easy level easy first
try I me Jo di in the bonus but that
doesn't
count
yay a level that kind that kind of
requires you to get the bonus gem to
even get Dr there's a few levels not
bonus gem
but the th
G rocket oh
no not a rocket level where's Rocket
Man need a rocket man for the rocket
level
this rocket level should be very easy
because you just pick up the boxes
and like there's no alter alternative
paths there are no
gems PA no death
thr Spike I'm not sure how if they show
up on stream or
not oeps
Rocket Man he's burning out his fuse up
there alone oh
no no rocket man what are you
doing
ni don't be
alone the only contact he has with Earth
is through through
streaming he does have a quite a nice
like ship which is in like it's
Furniture like a
house probably sleep
for it feels like at
home checkpoint completely
useless let's say mod the game so
checkpoints becomes whoops empty boxes
not no checkpoints left in the
game Bad death death's perception
here so that
close pon pon hello Dr nice to see you
here I wonder where you came
from you didn't say how it went with
your stream I asked you do you like s or
is it SAR no the singular is SAR the
plural is samur so you R put an O
instead because now ending with a in
Swedish gets the o r s while ending
for Samar would be the verb form to to S
which I have no idea what that would
mean
to do
AEM
H it was fun scary weird games but
fun you play like multiple games then I
maybe like some creepy games yeah it's
only like your you're you're doing like
Halloween costume things very creative I
do want to do like costumes I I don't
show up on camera
any
there we go H got stuck there for a bit
yeah very nice outfits you
have
uh yeah D that's for uh
the we call it the Fat Tuesday which I
think is the English ter too but it is
the same date
as
h
yeah s celebration is with
TLA in Finland Swedish it's called the
fast LS bu that's a word you can try to
spell I don't know it's
different Mr D keeps
making fun of them no how
[Music]
rude he said I look like an Ooma looma
today wait what what was your D
step you dress up like an
Ooa did you up like
Spyro W that was close I didn't pay
attention did
they W I need this
one can get easily get stuck in this
level apparently here we
go what a witch I can only assume you
would post that on your
sorry so I will have to take a look at
that
later and then I can write some nice
things thing about
your I mean unless you already posted I
will check later you
will it will be posted
eventually I didn't know
anything I don't what I'm talking about
no
scream no one can hear you scream in
space I mean you shouldn't be able to
hear laser either but this is crash
crash is not about
consistency not the best level I would
say
there we go okay they do scream I guess
one of them didn't
scream there you go
Jam that was no Des
right I died yeah I died and I started
11 that g didn't scream you're in space
station with you have stuff in yeah
that's true I'm pretty sure I did that
without dying because I they die and
then I quit
the level is so long so I keep
forgetting you know what let's do the
other jet pack
11 Pack Attack yeah because crush is
breathing
so they do have OD F character here
apparently even though presumably it's a
space station therefore it goes on orbit
around Earth and if you're inside of the
spaceship while while it's orbiting
around Earth you're also orbiting around
Earth alongside with the spaceship and
therefore you're experiencing no gravity
because you are in the same orbit as the
space
station which means you are experienc
the gravity of
that and are constantly Falling Towards
our and missing
it
which results in no gravity on the
spaceship so they have artificial
gravity on the spaceship and then it's
same but it's shame they didn't do any
animation for when they Reena
the the artificial gravity
for when you reach the end because they
could have the
uh
the nro box there at the end floating
and when you reach the end it lands on
the ground showing you the artificial G
is
back it's just very quiet
screen
so I hope everyone has a good
time I do like a
mask M dra
maybe are you drawing or not that's the
big question
and draw maybe thank you for the
follow but the big question is are you
drawing maybe I
am it's an interesting
name you might or might not be an artist
or you might might not be wrong I
yeah who who know maybe I'm not
well anyone here
watching M draw maybe you can confirm if
there's any drawing going on every
day we going to do there we go cuz I
wonder why you're going to do
that uh I'm going to guess not if you're
here watching what I
mean you could be drawing and watching
at the same
time okay wait for next
CLE going to be drawing and just find
trying to find something to watch while
drawing and doing watching some classic
crash 2
the that box should be floating and when
I land there it should land on the
ground there an
idea this level so the two check L are
over with so I don't have to care about
them there's only two levels
left ready let's keep the cing
[Music]
don't
know
[Music]
now so it's night
fight and spaced
out okay if I'm not wrong on this one
the gem pass on this one does not have
boxes so for the Box gem I just go
towards the
end and then I do the jam PA
separately who got 265 followers
now that means only 12 more four my goal
of
277 I know it's a weird go technically
Lo to 300 but it's like the in between
go
okay this is a bit
tricky gu I just jump
over there it
is maybe I should do it now and just get
it get it over it and then I do
the do do the regular box simat party
pon
pon oh extra
lives
who oh that was
close we got a lot of stuff going on
here have to
check hydrate
sure and swis
it let me check those off
a lot of people don't know he can do
that but sure makes the level
easier oops I spin too early this were
higher up
okay
and you can't spin most like forms of
energy orbs in this in games and then
just randomly you can SP these CR is
very inconsistent with what you can spin
and not
spin and it does not give you good
information regarding if they're
spinnable or
not and usually hot electric
and plasma like stuff you can't
spin except a few it's so
annoying and usually projectiles I don't
think can
SP I'm
tiny I'm teeny tiny
hey at least there's like no checkpoint
until that platform
[Music]
second thank you for the follow Eevee
99 I do like that that
99 confused with
99 I do like the creativity of your
name
EV I did that I need that pon pon is the
crash Wikipedia
yeah if if there's anything you want to
know about Crash I'll I'll do my best to
answer your
question crash is an orange bandicot
wearing blue
shorts guess like full length I guess
they're not really shorts that's
slightly short not too short I think
it's clear
like I don't
know how many T does he have
two two
giant
teeth see one upper teeth and one lower
teeth I mean
visually in the crash 4 they do have
individual te on the texture and I could
count that and I should just
down I guess you have a great crash
course
hone
y he just got his
head that's something inside funny
joke okay well this shouldn't be this
hard
and I basically have to pick up this gem
uh without
dying because there's no
checkpoints I don't think they came up
with h nonbox checkpoints until the
third crash
game and I've completed the third crash
game on PC and so the Remake without
using power apps well not 100% though
but read
CeX dang I do have a joke but you told
me not to tell jokes on stream I
mean I mean if it's like my style of
joke you can go for
it you know what kind of jokes I do on
stream
P it's B time for me yeah you can have
for long time good
night I understand you you trying to be
stay here but yeah you should go to bed
go to bed
great this is a shame for which time I'm
streaming my schedule might change when
I change location have fun you have fun
too I hope you sleep
when timing was that was me it's not
your style of joke
well then don't tell
it later
GRE I hope
to I got stuck on the edge of the
platform
and I have to get back to watching G
stream sometime again it's been a while
but my excuse I've had so much to
do and at and end of that trouble
sleeping so
basically my full day has full day over
the weekend has basically been sleeping
and streaming
nothing okay I should be able to do
this but I fail to this thing twice now
there we go that's what I need to
there oh thank you thank you for the
mask I do need
one I don't know how many lives this
took should be seven I think in this
game to five in the
mimic think they Chang it to five in ch
three but that's because H you can get
two
level two mon get
start should 10 this the more in this
game this thing isn't go
one oh you want
that do you want to redeem for
that
probably should catch a
team ah maybe it should be who it tried
to trick me
there there we go that's that's way to
do
now to the yellow one what did I fail on
again I don't
remember and good see
spinning seems to dissipate energy balls
yep I'm trying to use
that there you go that's what I
F but not this time and here's the end
where's my gem where is my gem they plac
the gem here nice there's not the Box
gem
though
I got the gem without dying after
leaving the starting
room yeah that's just to save
time y
[Music]
celebration every gem every even
crystals that's also I thing to remember
even the levels Crystal I should reach
without dying
there a way to get up to the
platform one one one one
one why doesn't the fruit make
noise when sliding this make noise
something okay so I
should use this to get up on that
thing okay what should I do
p Ah for
that oops I didn't TR to go that
far I went too
far I'm taking it too
far I got I got I got
fooled I got 30 Clear gems and I got the
five color gems and I got 20 three
crystals because I'm going to pick this
up and then the night
fight I hope you don't mind sound
effects yeah that
was that was the idea for
Spyro
reignited I should make every sound
effect every every single sound file in
the game should replace with my
voice doesn't matter if
it's well S effect which was the idea
the voices of all
characters even the
music yeah for some reason you get
squished by being pressed down on the
gun being pressed down pushed
down I guess it would hurt okay I will
wait you to raise your
arms raise your arms in the
he who want you
pushing no it's me you're pushing sh
that was bad
timing
yes yes yes
yes it would be so
awkward
what we
[Music]
got and and to make things
better when a sound effect is playing it
should mute the music that sounds like
it won't be perfect of
course because I can only in in real
life I can only do one effect at the
time pleas
think it would be a
cineon and of course voices would be
prioritized
over
eh all right what am I
doing this would
be
son I'm go under this platform I try to
go
under
ads thebody wa a
moment he can I there you go that's what
I
wanted cuz the life of is not there
anymore
that's what I wanted there was better
timing this time
too let's see one one one
one now was saying it only
because Benny come in here and said one
one
one
and many came in here and said 1111
because I've said that on his
stream even if he disagrees that they
say
one1 no I'll keep the
mask keep the mask up
there
like otherwise if I like die here it
shouldn't be too hard of a
bonus I just jump over here
yep
wait I need to do
that otherwise the stack will be too
high to jump up
[Music]
on
yeah there's no secret 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9
10
oops but good thing I kept the mask up
here so I don't waste it
Sil the noise silly
noise six 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
1 2 3 4 5 6
7 as are
gone s suit is
gone come
on and after I complete the bonus level
I'm going to die of something up there
up there and I had to redo everything
including the
bonus
well this is one easier
method but so much
slower
oops
didn't mean to do it like that
no I wasn't close enough to the
hch double in differenter FAL bunnies
yep she does not approve of my game play
I Am disappointing the fal bunny that is
the worst crime
now I
need I need I need
to do this SP okay you know what let's
take the slower safer
approach 7 8
9 10 boom boom
boom 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 there we
go don't get all the fruits but I don't
need them because I've already got Max
lives
now the F Pon is disappointed by
everything so how can it be a crown to
be
disappointed I guess you're
right oh I
tried oh I
tried
spaghetti I want wanted Pizza
Pizza we not with a huge pineapple on
top of
it pizza I wanted
popcorn no I was sliding but I was
sliding I died while
shrinking I it but I was sliding I
thought I was
allowed
popcorn but the popcorn are so huge I
mean compar those popcorn like she can't
even put those
popcorn I don't

ponon wants anything I think that's the
thing she doesn't want anything she just
exists

wanted to go
in 5 6 7 8 9
10 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10 10
10 there we go double
mask
guessing I was still Invincible there
that was did not go as
planned I think I took damage there L
time
too oh that was
close
oh can not
di what are these doing here
oh
no tricky platform hitting me in the
head now start over all over
again face love ear triple
disappointment oh no oh
no this isn't
good
I'm achieving maximum disappointment
here I'm achieving disappointment levels
I thought was
impossible
[Music]
d
watch out here I
come and if I do the bonus in one try I
get the reward of keeping the mask and
then I get that double
mask
okay
wh how many Liv have
99 despite R doing the 11 because I
died
I'm sure why I still try to collect all
the
fruits 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
[Music]
10 pleas
AR
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 there we
go that's easy method of clearing
it probably still tricky for something
to
there we
go I forgot to buy butter on Saturday
oh Rel
me open the
gate it's coming for
me
okay I'm going to watch out for your
platform cuz you're a rude
platform I'm going to call a plate form
nowan it has kind of a plate shape
[Music]
so and the platform joke comes from
spyit Trilogy where some of the
Platforms in the code are called
[Music]
plateforms there we go
we got cat sudon Rosco can I call Cat I
mean you've been here before I don't
remember what name you you went with
hat
[Music]
yeah I read everything right okay not
everything not even write something
rude or crude rude voice is so adorable
thank you that means a lot to
me that's that's a quiz why does it mean
so much to me that you said that cute
okay I mean or
adorable actually the can't I
mean technically not Reon I guess you
can make an assumption I don't know I
know I tried to tr to smart but iiz I
wasn't
smart wait isn't this level with like a
death R something and you have to
backtrack blind or something something
something silly like
that
yep oops okay let me check
this excuse me can you that come with me
I'm going to check
things was that intentional H dying
nope
it's just me failing the
game wait does does is that a sound
rabit
St I just realized how I I actually
thought about it before when you asked
if that was intentional I couldn't help
thinking like well that death was so
stupid it must have been
intentional no sometimes I just do
stupid
things okay
so maybe there wasn't any backtracking
here cuz all I see is a gem
and um I'm not picking up the gam
because I died and I'm doing a challenge
run and I guess there are no
boxes boxes
here oh I want to have to backpack this
part then that's it
yeah when I come out here I should have
not picked up those boxes I basically
have to
okay let me test cuz now the boxes
should back let me like see how I should
back
back I think it's a gift like you're
being gifted a cute
voice and I didn't even know I had this
cute
voice I mean is a is an natural voice
I'm like I'm doing the
voice I guess there are no boxes in
me
yep okay so it seems like I should not
take the test
route unless I want to Gem and I only
need to
do come
on sounds like you should come here
often more often cat so you can hear my
kid voice more often and then you can
write things because because I read read
out what you
write H so if you want me to say
something so that's why H I think some
have suggest like you should have like a
redeem or something I'm I mean or a ooh
redeem but I mean if you just write it
in the chat I'll read it out
though there doesn't need to be a redeem
for
it
and there's the
bonus
else then I get here I need
to back
track and here they are yes
guess I'm going to restart
anyway okay I probably have to back
check too far to get the gy but let's
try to get
the I mean you're talking anyway so it
makes me happy I I'm fan of fair
enough yeah I do try to fill the void
when people aren't writing anything
think it's not always
easy but I do my best and it has been 3
hours but and I usually stream for 3
hours so I will try to 100% this level
and defeat cortex I think sounds like a
good idea unless you want to have like a
prediction for cortex how how many fail
attempts it will
be in that case I'll do cortex uh
tomorrow maybe I should do cortex
tomorrow
because I have to I think I have to do a
bit of collecting and then I'm done with
this
challenge yeah I'll I'll decide that for
now I I'll do this
level 100% And then
I and it
day this one is a bit tricky
though
oh
again basically follow crash one RS kind
of make the limitation of this game
to now actually modified crash one R not
harder crash
one wait what I supposed to leave that
behind almost fell
down not going to waste this one on
that in this level they change that
one in the remake to be one that doesn't
follow me instead like it's kind of like
an aut
scrolling you activate it and then it
just
goes h Hello
[Music]
game ST freees like that
don't want that to
happen then there are these two boxes
and it should only be two
boxes don't play and because I checked
that before and it was only two
boxes get me now I got a mask oh
nice oh it's been
too
no oh
well I want to see what the rest of Lev
have in store for
me doesn't it's so close to the end too
yep here's the end okay I know about
about that one and there's the
exit so close and I
failed oh prediction yeah yeah so I'll
to start it during the countdown
tomorrow uh tomorrow starts the
countdown for anyone wanting to join the
stream will start well4 my time that
that is your time minus 3 hours and 3
minutes your current time m 3 hours
stand
just Mak Mak those things
actually almost made a
mistake we done enough of those
already okay so the bonus isn't that
hard un likeing crash three
but is also like a night bonus but that
one is
hard no why does it push me
off no not wrong side this is the
side the uneven ground does make it beit
tricky seeing
uh PS
stuff okay
bonus I do have enough time to do the
bonus there we go and also my made it so
you can't skip this in this in this game
you have to jump to them and then remake
they are on the ground making it
basically impossible to
SK interesting
differences I got some some many w why
does it stand stuff
here I haven't done
that on previous bonus
there we go and the second one is here
there's not another
one oh coming to attack
me and then jump over as
can no I got stuck on the
level
come
on too easy to just walk into a wall and
just get stuck
there at this point I feel like doing
this level tomorrow because I keep I
keep messing
up keep messing
up
go go go go yeah if I
like again I feel like I should probably
do this tomorrow I usually don't give up
but I would call this give up because
I I can do it I just need a 21 21 hours
of
rest there
going around that around that around
that getting the crystals from
time
not give up if you decide to take a PI
from
yeah I think I should see as as sh you
can't skip it I didn't mean to skip it I
just didn't pay enough
attention
each of the bouncy boxes gives
you and 10 that's
10y there you go get some extra lives
here now I know it fores up like
that he comes for
me this
coming Can't Get
Enough little
creature oh ignore
you and there was a pit here yes okay
there we
go I did it I did it without
D
okay whoo wo
hello right cut
scene that an even laugh you have yes my
plan is nearly complete and I have you
crash B to
thankful engine what's happening what's
that is he giving our signal
crash cortex isn't going to use the
crystals to contain the planet's energy
he's going to harness the force and use
it to power the super cortex Vortex he
has built on his space station last of
the ray will cover the entire world
turning everyone into cortex's mindless
flame don't let him have those
crystals engine you fool she's telling
him everything ah yes we're uh we we
back now pardon the uh
Interruption crash bring me
crystal oh M
already anyway I need to pick up
the the effect where the the whole 3
Model uh War warps to the side like that
I guess the interference of the of the
actual s m itself is it's quite an need
effect for Place one I
think okay I just need
the death death
route uh
Cham yeah maybe it should be a death
route when you when you enter it all
sound goes
quiet and there's an ear with a line
across his
head what a stupid
idea
oh above a hole above a
hole above a hole I don't know I don't
speak
English yeah oh
no because the light sources okay
so getting from
the backtracking all the way to the gem
I got the gem right yeah without dying
which is the important factor here so
now I just need to bring it to the
go in zero or more
deaths course I already picked it
up oops
oop
whoops R way you get an extra light
source there because this place is
light okay there or more yes after I
pick up something I'm allowed to
die that was the
rules
so that's it let's do a prediction next
tomorrow come by to do a prediction
that's why I should have left that level
actually because then I could do that
level tomorrow while the prediction is
running but
what I saved on stream as you could see
so let's move
over to the
schedule thank you everyone who has been
