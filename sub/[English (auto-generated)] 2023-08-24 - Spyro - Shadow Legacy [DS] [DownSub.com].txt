no it's a few seconds later every time
and everything and I couldn't time it
follow me
so today you it's going to be
spiral shot oh oh okay
outfits immediately
it was like getting run over by softness
if he he if he's standing on the
in the past if only when he's still
running over you with that first it
would that be very soft and nice
so hello hello hello
[Music]
yeah the pause is fluff only no no no
but for pants
so since this is a
and the DS this means that
it's a dual screen but as you can see
there's a single skin on on the screen
screen on screen
and
so my plan is to I try to fit both
screens like in some way but it's hard
to like make it look nice
but since most of the gameplay will be
on black upper screen and the lower
screen is just the inventory
our inventory I actually don't know how
to say that
um
I think it's
fine
I think to have only one skin I have I
can't switch which screen is showing at
any point during gameplay
and apparently we have wrote this screen
can't spend French or Spanish
how did they let this this type of Zoom
but anyway
well
let's begin
by pressing the
the check mark license by Nintendo
recently
by Shadow legs I said it was a colonial
name according to the to the corporate
Mark here it's officially without
in that case
crazy trademark in U.S and or other
territories are they not sure
[Music]
Legacy
so yeah it's a
I should be able to switch screen so
this is like the team excuse me Inspire
across the whole thing I think this is
the only moment where it splits across
the screen like this
[Music]
very nice
it's kind of loud I think
[Music]
and yes as the comment that's not shown
on screen and I'm like
and they come with us time plates weird
educate their hairstyle
which
and yeah I didn't exactly think this was
the sequel to a hairstyle it does make
sense
consider what it contains
and also the hairstyle music
the music sounds so weird or is it just
me
[Music]
anyway let's start a new game
yeah this part is the same song of a
hairstyle
we're just playing before but I didn't
make sure I could hear anything
sounds fine let's get and if it is too
loud leave let me know let's start a new
game
in a far away time there was a Land of
Magic a young dragon champion of an
Asian
like champion of an ancient people
slumbered away people there are people
where the game on just fine that's good
but how do you appreciate
it was a time of peace and prosperity
and yet a dark and powerful force
scattered strength
eyes in the dark
okay I guess that was all
so
I feel like the game
[Music]
I did test this before and last I was
testing it it was running at 76 and I
was kind of fluctuate I don't know I
can't think it was just stringing at the
same time
it's nowhere
how do I proceed
[Music]
the buttons are not being recognized
but
I should recognized oh wait I'm pressing
the wrong buttons
this is an antenna concept
despite gaming weird
bedroom eyes I see
just the screen sizing I feel like it's
that's not it's the holidays in the game
no more
okay wait this part how do I continue
there we go
oh yeah it's lagging badly why is it
running like this
why why can't
oh this is bad
uh
[Music]
it's not running stable another one
how do I nice
[Music]
[Music]
Anna okay
I was Electronica with the uh
um manufacturer we have
this
spiral hey Spyro come out come on out
and also you press and you press the x
button to continue dialogue that's why I
had problem with continuing that loud
you don't press the A Button input today
and now it's it's just this game is
running so unstable it's like below
below it's supposed to be 60 but it's
dropped down to like 50 sometimes
[Music]
every lock to shopping oh man that's
funny your key must be somewhere in your
room
okay well I'm going to head to
downstairs only figure things out yay
yeah not even help Inspire and why is it
that changed so much
okay now we're playing Spider oh it's
it's going bad is this going to be
another case of
not being able to play the game uh
I like Victoria GNT
anyway let's read
[Music]
this book is called
and Along Came ripter read it sure
after saving the Dragon Friends
Spire saw it he earned a little vacation
but there is no rest for the heroes no
matter how small they are
Shadow inspired and his friends Sparks
streams
like
virus and his friend Sparks and I had
dreams of the rest and relaxation was
with the crypto
a little guy
another little guy here but I can't try
to inspire this dinosaur riding
troublemaker
and despise his small statue and he took
it out on the World to proved that his
wrath was much bigger and scarier than
his modest science suggested
traded short tempered in spiteful ripped
up pulled off deception and your trouble
Loop befitting a much larger creature
forest fire he only wanted a vacation is
education he couldn't even go on
um
for even if he even if even if the
portal that changed where he went even
if he got to Dragon Shores that he
wanted to go to he still required like
50 orbs from Avalar so he wouldn't even
be left into the park anyway
there we go they see instead he received
a pain in the flames
well
oh yeah it continues it all came out
well in the end as part of the future
team and he's a henchmen enough to move
to spell
yeah in one single barrel
oh you can flame it
all right hopefully he lags less when I
get out of this building
and also inspire you prepare a place to
see say key again
never happens
okay oh fine then I have to open it okay
can I
I guess I don't have the key then
but how do you how do you get stuck
in here this is the other Hotel steam is
going to be like hopefully not hopefully
it gets ready when I walk down
is it better
maybe maybe if I get out of the house
then
this is sitting stunning another boy is
lying so much when it takes is supposed
to appear and this is the only portable
Spire game I played growing up the top
down perspective does make sure the
platform a bit frustrating yeah I can
imagine that the isometric games did
better this is like not as much this is
Magic I think
I spiraled the fireworks out of my stove
can you breathe on it for me it can't
help us
you go ahead Pat I'm gonna head out to
the docs before I miss my boat see you
there no that's not how I say Boat Boat
when
let's read fire and wait
[Music]
but
all right stop
there I found a key so I need to jump up
with it
[Music]
but what yeah that would be a
switchboard
there is the bottom screen with the
stuff I have one key 105 gems but
I wonder if I could like
do that on screen in some nice way
also
and the background is like a 2d
so you want me to heat up your stove
once you are drying can't you do it on
your own
[Music]
and I got to do it apparently
[ __ ]
[ __ ] there you go
and you said you said that
yeah oh now it worked
awesome thanks pal I got a whole burst
of choice coming in for dinner and I
have to get cooking
plus 50 XP oh yeah XP in this game
apologies was he okay are there any
anyway
[Music]
um
[Music]
here's a map
oh here we go wait shouldn't this text
be here wait wait wait this should be
white and black background
now level one 50 out of 2600 XP that's
that that's a lot of XP right away
let's see
yeah it's this is one of the biggest
game where you draw symbols it cost
balance and stuff oh that's gonna be fun
right
ah stands inside it and now another day
oh yeah press the wrong button my plenty
[Music]
oh no they directed to the chest I tried
to burn very interesting it's like you
only the other key
you say so
this is Target surf report yeah let's
read it
two feet
winter of the West at five miles per
hour sorry the itself is definitely not
that I don't know what you mean
I I
don't speak this language
now it's nice it's pretty bad out here
too
[Music]
this is pretty bad
I I guess it's uh wait I know I played
the
um
[Music]
yeah it's pretty bad
pretty bad
so
it's what it's whatever yeah but I mean
I'm not going to probably play into the
whole game with this sucking like this
let me
maybe that's you
so um why did you work on those houses
I will um
go and see
if I can do something to make it
run a bit better
because this is unplayable I argue
let's do some quick um
on the Stream
fixes
oh I see
everyone doing
um
foreign
yes I do
I will
set up the uh
and we can set up a
what do
okay that's a bit too much
oh I see
I'm trying to
set things up sorry for
I did today I have everything before and
it was running fine but then I just
decided yeah
not around fine so that was sad
oh well what can you do
I've found a new solution
and we'll see how well that works
hopefully it works fine
then
I'm doing
what I can't hear
at least Nick I only have to make it
work once and then
uh
setting up everything in advance but yet
trouble comes in
does not make it easy for me
but the part of the experience of
streaming
still very warm here
okay
I think
I've set this up correctly
ah oh
waiting shots
um
no
okay
there we go
maybe it works
um
it's uh
well
um why why did that happen
okay
yeah do you want to
how do I see
oh there we go
yeah that's pretty that's pretty wait
how is it running it's supposed to be 16
or 30.
there he goes
it seems to not run correctly I guess I
guess we're not
yeah he's running like half
okay this doesn't work
I guess I guess I won't be able to play
this game then
oh and
I don't have any orders why is this even
if you're running at half speeds
wow
there we go
well let's see how well it turns them
it's very blurry at the moment though
but
I guess that's a trade often
[Music]
can I at least get it slightly better
without
the lying a lot
[Music]
nope
as soon as I wanted less blades
it runs terribly
yeah
it runs terribly I guess
I guess there's no Spirit Legacy today
then
Shadow Legacy
ah the chaos game is even more Curious
to yeah yeah I don't want to play blurry
I definitely don't want to play it like
so slow I guess
that's two games that I don't want to be
able to run
