[Music]

I'm sorry

sorry dragon is first I realized

I didn't even have a

game ready to be run that was of me but

it is ready

now so let's switch

over let's see

we can bring it up on let's switch over

to game

screen the one with

music so what

do the a your level is

[Music]

good red dragon got first got power wolf

good my okay that sounds good

it's always nice to get up

early

cat after how's the day been so far well

I got up early so I definitely feel

better

today got Bandicoot 2 Vortex strikes

back this Bor press start to begin Press

Start yes I will press

start no I will not press start

so yeah I did someone wanted

[Music]

uh

prediction for basically because I'm

going to do a challenge here where I

will

do I'll do the quest one rule that if I

die during a level it does not count

towards

the gem so I need to

start over that doesn't have so much to

do with the prediction really because

but Bas basically how many times can

reach the end of a level and before I di

the first night that's basically the

prediction here someone want that that

so that's basically what the pr is all

about so let me just just

the

yeah GRE every let see we got

have I have to head this thank you to

have have a good have a good day at

school how do you see try

good but let's watch the intro what I

just

crystals of

course crystals of

course but Dr cortex to reach full power

we need not only your master Crystal but

also the remaining 25 slave crystals

from the surface how do you expect to

retrieve them when we don't have any

Earthbound operatives left you fool

still think I'm unaware of the situation

if we don't have any friends left on the

surface then we need to

find an

enemy crash crash crash my battery is

fried make yourself useful big brother

and bring an extra battery for

me where would I find the

battery where's the music there go I

think the oh come on why is why

is why

is OBS always doing

this why can't the picture just

be why does it why does it need to leave

one pixel at the bottom why it says that

it is full size it says this is yeah I

don't I don't know what's what what OB

is

doing it just loves to leave one pix at

the

bottom anyway this isn't the level can I

oh I can't cck this

down and this is

the yeah there's

no I don't even know if you count this

level because this

isn't

yeah I will not count this Lon because

this level is only oh there's there this

level basically only teaches you

the main controllers of the

game no it's not oh there you

go and then when you enter this

area you the game actually starts so I

wouldn't count that one

personally

so deathless oh yeah we'll see there's

11 plus let's know this well well well

if it isn't

crash

hello I apologize for the crude means

used to bring you here but I rather

expect a written invitation turn

down need your

help to Solutions be fun yeah yeah I try

to about black B borders of the game

again yeah hope it looks

fine look sharp and everything that's

what's important okay so now the game

has started let's create a safe

F anyone else wanted to do a

prediction put the toward the prediction

sure this is taking a

while anytime now I guess it's like

first Max is the memory card on the

game Crash be can I say the name as p o

n e o n

[Music]

done congatulations but like the size it

says what's

like 480 720 or

something so like normal round numbers

I'm not really

sure and

anyway we need water to drop in and put

some points on I bet as like

point should I stop the prediction now

because if I'm going to start the

run or should I have like the pr going

while the run is going I'm not

[Music]

sure does it say it's like red versus

Papa at the moment

[Music]

yeah

[Music]

um I'd probably say keep it going in

case there's

any yeah you know if I complete one

level no one no one is going to PR for

zero you know that's what I meant no I

mean yeah because there this case I

cleared zero and or on one two level at

moment that's

like

that compy

5,000 that's kind of what I meant be

stopping the

pred yeah I don't think

[Music]

[Music]

anyone

wa there we go now we got the second

person perfect on on on options three

and so that's three people in

total whoever that was it doesn't let me

now not on this screen okay I I should

bring I should be able to see it here

not that it

matters that's after is done

[Music]

anyway because

yeah it's been like 1550 minutes now

everyone's gotten a chance

chance there go it has ended I I'll

start

now this is the first actual

level how many else will I do let's

count them so I said which I wrote on

the server the technical because I'm

going to play the same as in Crash

one and

the it only countes as a death yeah I

mean if I die I

die for the

prediction doesn't matter how I die if I

die I die when it comes to

fliction make that but for the

challenge H it doesn't count as a

death uh if if I gone from the start of

the level I don't have to quit back to

the War

Room oh yeah you have to jump so many

times on

those oh yeah

I wanted to do the no boxes

first but I guess I'm doing the hard

mode all one first the boxes

first yeah this is little Pro

process

okay they move

so we they

and where where are my

masks bir here yes wa

wao that didn't count

apparently okay you can't spin

them

okay for being the first level it is a

bit

tricky

definitely

for

for that

one can I do this

thing

maybe and I'm pretty sure can't do

nope oh well looks like I have to Dr

11 that's a

shame all right yeah you got to know

what

the Yeah it change

the I can't beat

it have confidence in

yourself the Bon and know the bonus

deaths don't don't count as

this if you ever decided you should jump

on those 10 times that's

crazy that was

easy you can see how many boxes you

picked up but you can't see how many

there are in

total should be careful some FR because

I I probably need

it got the mask

finally been

missing I can't be dark but

[Music]

Transformers yeah I would probably

terrible that Dark

Souls oh

well I don't I can't well I can't

remember if I've seen you play

Crash you probably have

but

don't take that I don't know if you

played it on I mean like you probably

played this on stream

sometime see you played a lot of

games I played

the yeah the trilogy

once cuz it had good crowd control

support oh yeah well then that doesn't

make it

easy I think I saw

[Applause]

that LE the person was playing it had

quite some issues with getting it run

properly

anyway that's

it

minute completely yeah yeah yeah yeah

there those

boxes oh yeah I missed those boxes

because I fail that

jump well that was one one

run well done

crash r on you now listen

carefully main during the course of my

intellectual Pursuits I have stumbled

across a force that threatens to destroy

the world crystals are the only means of

containing textures inside of his hands

it

iser that you bring them to

me are

you are

you CR is not here let's pick up the

blue

gy

I like playing it on my steam deck in

bed that when you know exactly where

theing boes

yeah blue

gem

because I'm not sure if the trilogy does

it or the trilogy does give you a hint

of how to get the blue gy which just

makes it

easier

I want

that oh that

opened is

scary wa I don't have masks it's

fine oh no I want have

boxes

come

enemies see make sure where I'm

going and under hold with

enemies

okay standing inside

it more more of the

more

enemies let's get rid of

[Music]

those oh yeah here

it but now the blue

gem it actually doesn't show the Box

Thing

whoa IO two

runs cuz that's the second r

that's why want bright runs not

levels now I can do the

celebration but how many attempts will

it take to get the box

G

so you are helping cortex gather

crystals yet you have acquired a gem

interesting well crash

know this as long as you are allied with

cortex you are my swor enemy and I will

do anything in my power to stop

you if the fate of the world is truly

your

concern gather the gems not the crystals

if you obtain all 42 gems I can use them

to focus a laser a laser beam that will

destroy cortex and the station he's

created until then I must use my forces

to stop you from Gathering

Crystal I will continue Gathering

C anyway this time I will actually get

all boxes trust

me I realized I've achieved my 250

follower

goal so I should set

it I certain one to

300 let's

go anyway so can I get the old boxes

this

time I didn't mean to fail last

time can I fix the when runs I'm going

to through this level normally I would

just do two but I guess that's the

yeah you luck behind

everything

yes

go should I pick up that first n

probably does not make it this

here

I wouldn't

really get to oh that

worked

like

oh like this is kind of fine fun fine go

that's what I was looking for cuz it's

much

quicker that no problem do

that problem is this these birds

here there we

go why did that one trigger wait did

reset

good

oh

annoying

annoying I guess I'll just have to quick

and start

over start all the way over is that

that's the one of those that does not

reset

which

sure it's probably why I want to do the

blue gem first because and then get the

crystal at the same time cuz then I can

just reset every time I faade the Box

gem cuz this level does not make it easy

so I can do two runs instead of three

guaranteed but then I accidentally start

picking

boxes it is raining

okay then it's it's not yeah you don't

have have to Trav far to reach

this that

one so there at least

that

what

but gu I picked up the

[Music]

mon already had one lils

okay so I managed to get across one

bird oh that was

close so now I just need to figure out

how

to get across the other

bird damn it go

[Music]

finally I did

it where's my

celebrations I can finally get the box

gem checkpoints don't do me any

see so so basically as I said cuz in the

original scrash bar as far as I know S I

tested after you collect an object you

keep it even if you die just that the

gems you only

collect after you you finish a level but

in the keys you can die and still keep

the

key so so I'm going to to do that rule

here too because that's how Crush one

works if I I only have not die

until before I get the Gem but after I

get the Gem I can

die

again who there's the

cation

blank hello aome egg hello

egg what's the throwing blanket

what what what do you mean

like what I can imagine is like you you

just woke up from bed throwing your

blank blanket is showing up on

stream waking up oh it's it's pump

streaming

[Music]

time pring comy f

you are comfy you are

homesome you you are spreading good

lives

here it it's a good time here with you

there you go 62 boxes that was what I

needed right look at that a

[Music]

gem whoa that took only three runs I

meant two runs but it could take three

runs so well that's

that who okay we don't need second

should I

save save because that was a tricky

[Music]

level

go no

go can I yeah I should be able to get on

this

one that should be no problem look the

introducing

n which I never it's supposed to

be okay I guess I leave Le back

behind there we

go now you're die give me 100 points

that's not how

work it do not any of these

way

who

I mean you will get you will get your

points back if I survive too many

times I I can't see anything there's a

mask in in my

face

little

boom boom look a

mirror or is just C

eyes I think that one is there you go

that's the

gem imagine getting from

here

anyway

sp there you go

bonus love the

bounds oh you you got all four

bounds

congratulations you are you have collect

them all which means I do have to make

my own

bounds can I

yes

oh okay that wasn't the direction I was

trying to slide but it

worked I guess that's one

boxes need pound exactly I don't have P

unfortunate oh only got four and then S

four was the ones the

four well looks like you need to get

another

one

yeah I would like to make a bonce but

you

know yeah takes

time I need to get an idea of what

like how would do the bounce

like

me hey

what

there we go why didn't that was

F

weird figure out the bounce pose I guess

it should be fair

P

something why I do this take some f

there

G I want to have like 10 of them to

makes sense for me to make one k did

those and maybe you could ask her for

advice can ask care if I can trace it

now okay no more dancing hang eight it's

two

gems isn't one required like the blue

gem

kid asking kfy to make

mine

not making wait that was a run what I

now four

runs this that

meet now we not going to jump on that

one I know someone wanted me to go for

it

but yeah yeah yeah now I remember

wait it did not trigger does it trigger

on the next round

stream W I didn't touch that I wasn't

even close to

it game is

cheating I don't remember them being

placed like that in trility I mean yeah

in life in point but I thought they were

more in the middle of the

level maybe need TR time it doesn't show

up until next time we go certain

level feels a bit weird

though do I have to do two rounds in

this level

then

[Music]

me oh I got that one

too I'm going to pick up every fruit no

I'm not going to B with those

boxes

wo another extra

life there we go there's a

platform as far as I know it brings me

back here I need it to get the extra

boxes now I'm going to a harder part of

the

level now there's a risk for me to

die

24

lies okay let's see if I can do

this wa that was close I'm already

making

mistakes that wasn't

it so um that I completed four hands

before I

died oh no you know what that

means

poofy I did three to five

runs so that's congratulations to yay

refund no I need three to five runs that

is not a refund time that is that is a

actually valid result on the

lebard

oh no oh

[Music]

yeah three to five yes I need four

[Music]

runs CU I did yeah yeah

what two winners which are Asal welcome

astral and papa

wolf okay one more try I I not exactly

sure what what is

why I quit the level instead of just

continuing is because I cannot pick I

the sub post challenge I cannot get a

box I cannot get the gems box Gems or

not box

gem if I die and respawn from a

checkpoint

there I become a okay that's fine that's

fine I'm happy you're

lucky do

that as far as I know when you enter

this

one approach it R you should get a

timer

dang too well that's very kind of you

right yeah some

people people here need more more points

more coins more

carrots more

can I can I just not

die

please I di twice on this

level I didn't make

like yeah yeah

you H yeah I think you predicted 5,000

someone added 2,500 that means that you

earn two3 so should win

two yeah you should have won

like

no no you couldn't no not 30k

3K more like 6K

30k it was only 7,000 7 and a half th000

that was in the in total points

so you cannot have gained that

much you should got like one like

6,000 plus your

original 500 back or

something okay there we

go try to check these this

somebody okay I fell off this

one come

[Music]

on was a while ago

like oh oh oh oh sorry

sorry I I I this

one from a

prediction yeah I think I don't remember

how much I won one in one prediction

something like 100 110,000 or

so and I predicted one

point because I was Al on that

one then another prediction was made and

I and again put in one point and one or

something like that because no one else

picked that option and I was correct

again and you not eat me this time thank

you yeah otherwise this part would have

killed me anyway

so

okay that was fine otherwise this part

would have kill

me okay so far fine the checkpoint

doesn't help that

much okay let's

see picture is kind of Zo in or is

it okay activating

that and now moving back

in

I just make sure I'm not to see anything

kid

oh can I

get okay this is going to take a few

attempts I feel

like there you go I got

it it's okay when I hope so no you

cannot make mistakes on pun you have to

be perfect and understand everyone

everything

as as long as we understand each other

in the end that that what's that's what

m is I want take no I can't take this

part oh oh well that one is gone

now be close to the edge this is

weird

get me off this

again okay so far let's let's Pi have

full concentration here go pick that one

up don't want to miss

it Go those are so

good

doing

and and chat will be my weakness for not

cheating oh no no they blocking my

path there we go that's the

gem but I ha to go through level once

more to get the the

gym

wa oh another cuz I collected three

crystals three crystals not bad I see

you are getting the hang of it I need to

conserve power I will communicate with

you again after you retrieve the fifth

Crystal

wait actually now I see

that twitch actually gave you

6,667 points as far as I've been told

according to

Twitch H the points you gain should

always be rounded

down H but here they just seems to have

rounded it normally I

guess cuz you can end up in situations

where the total number of points of the

rounding normally is more than was was

originally one yeah was originally in

there okay the only thing that matters

now is for me to

be

Qui what am I confusing this with

another level I'm am I

I really thought this was the one it

does not show time maybe it doesn't show

a Time re it does shot

time yeah I should not pick up

the well that's not how you do

it really of this game

no

no maybe maybe maybe I'm confusing this

for a different level but how else would

you get the now this is this

level how do you do you need to do

something to unlock the timer is it time

just broke in this

verion okay I I give it one more

time one more

time okay what

yeah

I made a

mistake mistakes were

made I I I I pressed the jump button and

then I accidentally held it down when I

oh there we go that's the timer is the

timer not showing up if I pick up the

checkpoint

well don't go into that

one okay can I

make they jumps correctly this

time yay I

did oh do have one b or the time is

short did I extend the

timer yeah that was a failure and is

time it work this time a very short time

are you running faster in the

tril in the

remake the the uh doing the timer in the

remake is so much easier that the that

one was

tricky in the remake it starts at 1

minute and 1 second well 1 minute 2

seconds cuz it's it shows one minute one

second

that's and I think it says zero as

well that 1 minute two

seconds yeah this one start at 57 so

that means you get 58

[Music]

seconds okay little concentration

here

go go go go go go go go yeah just go

through

it wait that's not the jump I need this

is the jump I

need it doesn't

matter hurry hurry hurry don't leave me

yeah I got

it that's they definitely make it E in

the

trilogy well I did it

whoa okay we don't need no more dancing

I need to save that one then that one

was

[Music]

tricky

definitely a difference

there so the pizs wait

[Music]

was

no confusing with the different

level is that other level that has

something and let me like that now what

did it say

hey

what well that was silly H and now since

I used to respond from the start does

not count as a best towards the

challenge and the prediction is over

anyways since uh if I restart the level

I'm going to start from the start of

level anyway attack

me it's not changing

anything so this level contains a the

path which makes it a bit tricky oh that

one attacked quickly to tr to fake

me

checkpoint as far as I know you should

be able to get all G on

this

man would be annoying to

be trying to get a

gem get all boxes when I can't do that

or I know this is a fres do go could be

wrong oh there's one

there there we go that was that was what

I

needed okay

now now the tricky

part

backtracking with I'm dying P the pits

plenty of

pits and they're going to

pee

annoying let's try this again

then these uh turtles with spikes and

Stor

blades stor blades and Stor they they

are kind of

eyb

funny the the bird like

half half metal on

heads organic head and metal

head turle is a metal head

is

H pick up lives I need

lives feel like I'm going to die many

times doing this challenge the problem

is to what was really going to drain my

lives is

that I have to redo the whole level from

the start risking giving me more

opportunity to

die and then this

part really uh that it it is

um checkpoint doesn't really mean

anything I'm going to be careful

here yep there it

is put a

hold a pit a hold there just to mess

with you

anyway they should make noise like in

the trilogy where they make those weird

noises killing

everything attack me I got like a half

robotic body as

well

half half metal butt like one leg

and

he interesting interesting

details

this like I'm missing something wait a

minute is that me something

no I did

not some completely forgot that I

activated the explanation

point for some reason I'm playing

playing with

thinking I'm running on Al the plan at

the

moment a

pilot what's happened

there don't have spawn on top below

me bonus at least here I can die oh ads

let's

uh save the ads

command not standing

on

there you

go this should be

easy what do you do boink

boink he

up

who whoa whoa he moved way too

quickly

H because in the original crash H you

also could die in a bonus and it still

didn't prevent you from getting the gem

so I will not count as as it

this just like in or the difference is

however I can redo the bonus in the in

the original crash one I couldn't do

redo the bonus but I don't feel like I'm

I'm going to go that far because the

difference is also in the original the

bonus did not count toward the Box

count but here it does count where the

Box count count count count therefore I

will redo the bonus and not count as a

this I think the

challenges just I think that's f for the

challenge what this movement is so

weird you read exclamation points as an

L the exclamation point adds comes

SLS

anyway

point

point maybe I should I don't

know bo bo bo

and now let's pick up this again and in

the

remake they made it so those line lives

don't respond if you fade the bonus

after picking them up that's a

mistake cuz bonus is supposed to

reset there we go finally

wao

[Applause]

and I for over as I complete the

bonus the bonus is only for you can only

watch the bonus if you're a

subscriber or through other means don't

have

ads I get every box

now really hope

so oh I don't I don't want to be missing

one box in the

end I'm missing two boxes wait how are I

missing two

where do I meet

what now me I have to do

again where did I miss two

boxes I guess I'll have to go up the uh

one past just checking the whole path

and see if there's anything more and I

don't I don't think this

should the iies box is somewhere

obvious am I

blind oh

well two

boxes

100 I just just did 100 before he sent

but anyway

okay sitting up

straight and I'll do another hydrate for

you

H and mix the tropical fruits in a

juice some

good vitamin

supplement

and Bon okay let's check

this pretty sure I got

these I need

follow thank you for following as

through Malia fan

2003

okay I don't think there

is anything more up oh yeah they

are well can't jump on that yeah yeah

those two are the ones I

missed

what okay let's go back this way because

I just walked up this kind of want to

figure out if I can make the pie smoo

now welcome follow here's your

blanket oh that's a that's a merch

nice

idea pon pon blanket you get a blanket

with pon pon on

it

but uh

yeah yeah yeah don't bother trying to

make the piece to smoothly I just

uh why does that

happen

why does that no I

want why can't you just attack them why

is the crystal

white yeah it was just as it

flashed that's why was

F I just want

to so man

games Smash Smash in

here

do a blanket a soft py blanket with a

print of pon pon across the whole

blanket it's the closest I have to our

pon pon Plus at the

moment

yeah have the on the stream at the

moment

cuz and this time

worked I mean I shouldn't do that

because the game is a bit

buggy

okay we can do that to turn him

around in case you need to turn it

around to bounce on them but I don't

think this that's required any anywhere

in the game it's like an unus

function just as attack ended okay I

just need to remember to walk back a bit

extra after I get to those

four I can do this there's another hole

here there it is and that's

free

okay

go well

checkpoint Just Bounce

me yeah here's the explanation

both explanation point box that I kind

of forgot

the I I can I forget about stuff too

easily and here's

the purple Crystal that I think looks

more

pink and then I go back here I have to

make sure I

don't that H scared

me okay and then there's the two XB here

there they

are there they

are

perfect I can do it this

time

well I'm currently doing a challenge in

Crash 2 where I should complete the Box

cam without dying and I died so

therefore I quit and I have to start

over but I wanted to see what that part

was like so I'm not unprepared next time

because that's something you can do I'm

basically following fres one

runes yeah now

stuff my% kind I hope you are doing well

on that and

are getting closer to

100% I'm

making yeah I have no experience with

that game

so oh no it forced me to

activate oh can I stop running into

those

things oh I'm doing terrible at the

moment no oh nice challenge runs yeah

I've done a few

like Spyro done no flame

run have I done any

out yeah I did crash three without

powerups and EG is ready with a blanket

wrap yourself up with the blanket feel

feel

welcome I bet my Ares is is

n the end

of so things are good is it taking a

long wait how

many how many hours and how many streams

have you spent on that game trying to

100% specifically in your attempt of

100%

you spend extra time

playing

yeah no don't do that

again don't be silly P Pon don't do the

same mistake

again okay so far

so far and I just two

this someone say blanket yeah you're

providing

blanket oh I've been playing it for the

couple month

in well is that like

you was

here

but is that is your months of playing

have that contributed to your 100% run

why do I keep doing

that this is the first run I

believe yeah this is the very first

stream I do for the crash 2

challenge so whatever the stream time is

said

1 hour some

minutes you probably have to subtract

like 20 minutes for

startup whoever decided this should be

10 is

truly there we

go spun away the frge but they didn't

even break

the okay can I do this part without

dying things like that like that

oh yeah yeah yeah

yeah yeah oh no I should have picked

that one up oh no don't to

that okay not not

going great

back oh yes I think I did it yes I did

they to that was

scary that was very

scary I have a demo of CR team racing in

PS1 but that's the only one I played and

it's not even it's not even the classic

crash

platforming oh there go now was the Pres

presentation listen up we are not

without enemies some of them you may

even recognize although they cannot harm

you inside this warp room they can

attack you on your way to the next one

to get to the next warp room use the

platform that appears in the center of

the

room good

luck I don't think they have that one

in remake which makes it strange when he

says that he will contact crash after

getting five crystals but he doesn't do

that I can I can kind of understand like

the dialog

doesn't work because they have changed

it they replace the save place with the

boss

level but they could still change the

dialogue nice well done thank you thank

you

egg with a happy egg you need a smiling

egg

now and

I what

okay now I go take

care stay coffee on I will try to stay

comfy it is been comfy with you here

appreciate you being here have a good

day have a good

day wish you the best

okay let's

see just the

again I guess it's like

here

the glow from the boxes that's make it

easier to

see last one there is not many quest

to whoa bus

defeated he just shows up and starts

attacking me from nowhere while I'm just

traveling to the next war

room why do I come out of the snow beast

portal that us make sense just arrive

from the platform in the

[Laughter]

middle that's so funny I see that reru

failed to prove much of a challenge yet

again this one does Tri business there

are crystals to be gathered 20 to be

exact the plants will align shortly all

13 of them and this will create a power

great enough to rip the Earth apart

properly utilized however the crystals

can absorb and contain

the is that you looking everywhere I

don't have much time to tell you this

you have to be careful trusting cortex

seems a little

unwise I can't keep the data path open

CR you need

to trusting cortex

did I

say

very

very the the voice acting wasn't

this

has at this

time I I don't do like some of the

[Music]

some of the voices but it's no is this

the oh I think that one requires let me

go to air crash

first guys I'm not if I'm correct is

snow be required red gem crash can

provide me red gem so that's what I will

do our crash

first but I was

attacking I was

attacking you trust

me Wasing the attack

button well I

hope

me go

okay okay let let's

see

oops hey ponor in chat guess what what

what's Benny what's going

on hi Benny nice to see you Ben look

look Benny I'm trying

to I'm doing I'm

doing I'm I'm doing crash run rooms I I

cannot die to get the Gem currently I'm

not going for it hey what was that this

work right I'm not going oh this is hard

can I yeah that was much easier trying

to do it hard way when I can just do

that this H does not count eh is

getting yeah I'm allowed to die to reach

that

right hi Benny how's your fantastic I

just

did one and no Lo no my pass bestest

oh you have achieved

greatness

this

on than

swimming watch

out watch

out coming

through

this

okay I just have

to there are no checkpoints here so

since there are no boxes on this area

so oh crashed into the

room oh you were just

spinning what was this

for Mas in night

okay I

enough Guess

Who and this game has that Weir ice

physics if you get if you're physic

stops and then you and the thing doesn't

stop you anymore and you start moving

again which makes no

sense

oh let's get through

this yeah no is it it

didn't he did

it where he

eat

when you no longer when no long stop

prevent you from moving forward

you you start moving forward

again oh this is going to be tricky now

because now I don't have the mask help

me

let's see if I can do this then the

proper way this time because of I said

La of

M wait why is this one not active that

doesn't make

sense is this game buy or

something oh

didn't expect that to

happen of

penguins I'm going

to

and missing everything okay I got the

gem without dying gu there's no

checkpoint so only count is dying when

you spawn from my checkpoint

and because I picked up the

gem that means that I can

die

because after you pick up something you

keep hold keep holding it that's that's

how crash one thinking cres one can

even quit the level and still can't keep

it and don't have t

to these that's the only thing

but

I will

treat

this in level up pickable that's the ter

now gems the same as keys in Crash

one I I'm still limited to what this

game does when I quit the level though

just keep it and keep it I got the red G

that's what

countes

wa okay we don't need to

celebration now I can

do snow

beast I should have saved

[Music]

something so many I see me going going

around to everyone

and rightfully bragging about your

sucess oh now I can get

the nope okay F

bringing it to me because I don't play

the game so it's fine only you I feel

special and

honored yep well thank you Benny

my bad

idea definitely a bad idea but I keep

with level as

the crystal shines

white stretch oh there we go there we

havean

hello I'm already on the sixth level at

the moment Where Have You Been Just

Kidding

I don't remember how long you said that

you will

take it's been it 1 and a half

hours no it's fine it's

fine I would not require anyone to be

here so it's perfectly

fine

that's not exactly what I don't know

what this is

okay pick up these I can't pick up

more here can I I mean I can't go no

there's

eyes but at least I know what's over

there or if case I need to back

trck was delayed I had

potatoes to cook along with our roast

but I couldn't find

them the the living

potatoes someone had used them over

weekend was

you wouldn't that be funny I'm doing

well just finish some squats so the legs

are bit de at moment oh I I need to do

some

exercising you have to remind me to do

exercising I haven't done exercising

today I should do some squats

myself you're late yeah

exactly

okay grind never stops and that's

fine oh look I'm standing on

it the grind is half the fun

spin go oh here for a big

jum big

J okay

so there

little goodbye little thing oh wait

what's this oh yeah this is this

area oh spawn

something okay I'm doing this

wrong I might be doing this

wrong I'm missing everything

now okay I'm I am definitely messing

everything up at the

moment okay now definitely messed

everything

up yeah this was

stupid good death not sking like day

24/7 yeah I spent about 20 minutes

looking for more

and that's why I'm late that makes

sense makes sense working for

that

here are

you what are you saying that I

should you

SL you need a lot of plastic for

that no he

was what the natural one of

course

no why not

B that's

po yeah yeah both both sounds

good but I I'll

do I press the button I'm not sure if

that was there but my when they outp put

some controller overlay on

screen some way some some way that looks

nice something

but not

intrusive but

uh yeah I really need to get some

routine on

my

quing my legs are so today don't know

why I didn't do anything after one they

oh that one came at me at a high

speed high speed

porcupine well maybe your ordinary day

makes you l

s

okay come on

now on P don't mess things

up you can do

this oh that was spe close that was the

Comfort on the blankets are

C

well there was one trailer door that was

difficult to open used a lot of leg

power to open that yeah maybe that was

the no that can't

beat oh look I can stand on the boook by

spinning it by spinning

it oh that was interesting

interaction

goodbye when you slide into enemies you

can't get stuck for a short

moment no

enemy uh I tried to jump over it I

jumped

on okay get rid of that there we

go don't have to worry about that one

again

go spinning on

fruits

wa there we go I got them all

I was standing a jum bar that could be

helpful later on yeah it might

be only you need to do is doing a spin

before land on had a good

timing so far so

good there go oh

no

no I wish I had a

mask but no masks for

me you got the

staran I need the

hydrate but no outfit changes for today

apparently I guess no one is interested

in swimsuit or it's the it's a so SP

okay

sure um cuz I was going to say the wind

level apparently the swimsuit is they

high pick for that but I guess you pick

the sports way

you know because it's a great outfit

because it ensures that the cold air

doesn't get stuck beneath the

dress cuz that's how it works

right so having having a short top make

sure that the cold a can

escape trust me that's how it

works

I'm not even complet red po

yet this is going to take a while why

this this level of level fluffy Bell is

better than swim suit I mean I can

agree but if the swimsuit is a

bikini keep getting

BS

so far doing

wi but this P isn't a bikini so I mean

you are

right that I should make a bikini outfit

option that's what I

meant wo

can't go

up you can't

climb come

on this game buy or

something

anyway I going go past

that so moving on here going pick up

this just to get extra knes back cuz I'm

losing knes I am I getting more lives

than I lose cuz

I I restart 11 yeah I should keep

the okay let's get that one first

[Music]

go well I lost I I had a mask at least I

don't have start but he G that was

completely the wrong

way oh what

what what a

mistake yes bikini outfit for the fluffy

bunny tummy yes see fluffy bunny tummy

see this is why you should call it a

bunny

tummy can you can you say a word for

fluffy or similar is that starts with

B

wa can I do this only 5 Liv going to be

close yeah I know I don't know you might

not make it with so little lives it's

not I mean lives is not the issue

because the knes doesn't do anything for

me you know because I can't die I'm D in

the level

anyway

don't they don't do anything for

me

oh nice

Spike get out of the

[Music]

way oh there we go

oh one of these completely different

platform it's not a red platform and

then yeah and then it goes back okay I

see I

see

do you want the live cheat I don't think

I need

it cuz I said I don't really need lives

so okay now I just need to do the normal

level without

dying oh come on come

on there we go

there there

waa nice one of

these

who oh lag

Spike when does the lag Spike comes come

now

what

goodbye

okay H

this

did I get

box I can't see

anything yeah it looks like I got the

box good good oh this is

[Music]

scary oh

no

no

no h crash

isot don't worry I I get my practice on

that

I I choose to not think of that level I

think I think that's a good idea for a

moment I cry that makes me chuckle why

why are you

chuckling

no don't chuckle at

me makes me

sad you know

what let's do do

this let's do this I've died so many

times come on come

on there we go this game as far as I

know only gives you one extra mask not

you so I can't do better than this but

at least there one

more L for one

mistake of course I could just go to

another level pick up two MKS

but too too much effort

Benny you got to do it all over

again and that makes you so

happy

oh oh Rocket

Man why are you

so

evil but it's so fun funny I have to do

everything all all over

again I'm just a cute little bunny why

am I torched like

this here you

go oh don't do mistake

now okay so I can just take this

immediately oh you doing retro Jus no

I'm not I'm just doing a custom

challenge which basically is the same

[Music]

thing I guess but if there's any other

achievements I don't know pleas one I

mean

there do the Night level without picking

up any of

the shiny

things that's one of

the yeah I'm not going to do that

but I guess I can check them off as the

things I managed to

do hey Benny's

here Benny came in here to tell about

the thing he might she

did she which she's very proud

of

ohing

those

hey I am a proud Time Savers wait I

proud time sa 1 hour oh 1 hour what is

your total

time

two days

F I'm getting my own back for all the

times you laughs at me for that how do

you know I've been laughing at for

dying I would never do that Rocket Man I

is that nice buunny I would never make

fun of someone failing

something especially not making a clip

of

it 3 hours 5 minutes I think

well

idea what so yeah so 1 hour that's Point

H time

say

okay

well

yeah the difference

between

why why did I do

that the beig questions I don't have

answer

whoa whoa whoa

whoa wow

wow I need to stop being

silly this is this where stream

ends getting stuck at this level for 3

hours go go

go

[Music]

oh yeah

this other way I can't come so how long

are you playing today I don't

know long as people are watching I guess

have plenty watches

today

course I'm happy for that

didn't stream yesterday maybe maybe

people coming

that and bionic even came with our raids

too very

nice very

nice uh as long long as people are

watching well we'll be here quite a

while

then oh right I miss it yeah you weren't

even

here bionic is doing 100% thing in that

nio

game but has ways to get

one yeah I'm not sure why I'm doing it

this

way

no really do

this can get

that yeah no

problem for Bon bun what the pon

P I don't know what I'm

[Music]

saying oink

oink okay back to this part that's an

easy

go that's how I do

it and

then

yes I'm doing

it and then I need to get rid of this

thing oh that was close and back to

normal level come on the L level should

not be hard I said this this part should

be the hard

part not normal

level keep it

up thank

you H but at least I was late because of

lost potatoes and not because of this

still what

still what do you

mean oh now I know what you mean Pi me

yeah I

fig before I read

it okay how did I do this

again

that this and this way activate

this and was this section with one

two three

boxes

okay and then this was this

section okay I did

it I

did bonus bonus death does not

count just backing the original

PlayStation one game off crash one which

is the rules I'm

following

crash crash the

boxes okay hope I get every

box this version of the game does not

show the Box count though oh now we

using words here Rocket Man I mean it's

fine

it's but I didn't expect that way to

show if you haven't played crash 4 yet

good luck that okay is

solid uh I just I have played it

before the on it oh I should sled sled

loed yeah

the it

is solid I would not say I would say

that in is more

solid

hey crash 4 has a lot of

issues I me it's well made but it has so

many

issues son doesn't CH of

[Music]

son

no sliding to the

W it's one Dody moment away from

getting

yeah yeah

yeah it's not a like it's a good g game

but it has so many

issues this it's an interesting choice

of War day

I had CR for

Relentless I

mean it has the I mean if it like

it like fair enough if we want to

challenge player

but really really need to piix IT

issues they're not going to mix

it uh what's going on

doesn't this count as destroying the

boxes is this game bugy or

something there we

go but if anyone can beat 00% it's funun

look at the

CR that was yeah this why this wind show

up here instead of there and look

stretched out

platform okay can I do

this no don't

lag that was an easy knif to

get useless

checkpoint nothing hidden in this

thing thank you I do need a mask oh like

I fell down the hole but I didn't look

the crystal I see a

crystal that ceiling

here I can stand on it why is that one

metal makes sense to

me sometimes they just make oh sometimes

they just make these M for no reason did

I get every box tell me I got every box

look at the T I got every box and I

jumped over the gem

[Music]

ction time oh that was that was that was

hard not as hard as cold hard crash

hopefully

not

H uh I'll I'll do that level when I get

it there some celebration now we're

having a whole part party here with

every little p p air

crash I think there's a no death

platform in this

one does that one bring it

back uh the death platform should not

contain any

boxes maybe I should do the this

platform

first

[Music]

moding the game to remove the

checkpoints okay now I don't need to do

this anymore so I can

just do

this

e but yeah I I I tell you all how easy

I mean I completed the original crash Bo

I've completed

um think an actual hard crash game I'm

done I

mean I'll complete this challenge that's

a that's a hard

one then me just need to

see come up thank you you then we did I

say I was going to do death

platform I'll do the death

platform

no do the death

platform case I'll just go back and

backt track there no

problem

no I don't think there any boxes here

I'm not sure if you you get put back on

the is

this look it's a cool cool mix you only

play as one character yeah that's a game

Rock

play why is it so

slow

wait excuse

me sure is lagging a lot

today why today I mean now yeah that is

you don't get returned but I get the

special

gem do you only play retro

games well since um like okay I

know H but since I'm got that one got

that wait did it oh the the Box gem is

the lower one not theer one not

confusing at all let's go and get the

box uh I do play some games on the PS3

it's just that I packed down on the PS3

because I'm moving I'm not moved yet

First St

too I didn't even realize

that and but after I moved I can pack up

the PS3 and play on

it

but I cannot really play any modern

games on this computer it's not WR I'm

worful enough to do

this now that's why I am basically only

playing retro games at this

moment it's my my only me well yeah I do

have a 360 and Wii

U

well but I don't know if I have any

means to

recall but no it's 36 I should be able

to record

from

go and this time I'll do the

bonus it's nice and refreshing though

compared to everyone else to follow well

I'm I'm happy to be able to offer

Something Something

Different yeah I I want to play like

this is why I play like a game like

return fire as

well even though it is a retro game from

98 but it's also a game that you you

won't find anyone else playing it CU

anyone ever played it on

Twitch oops doesn't

count is instant game a game that an old

game preferably of

course that no one has played on

P

cuz the problem is that H when it comes

to vs and such twitch are deleting them

so so yeah so if you don't want to so I

can't see if some someone has ever

played it that information is not

available it's not as retro but I want

to play Skyland again watch someone play

I do want to play gu because of you know

the a spal Universe

game I do want to play that but I do

need figures but

I I can probably just smoth the figures

no I don't think that's it's just that

data it's just some data I don't think I

don't think that is like copyrighted or

something maybe is but

like oh it's not like

I no wait I did it

wrong I did it wrong I'm not getting

access to those anyway I did it wrong

let me collect from R before

restart we

go

one oh

well forgot about those

boxes keeps yeah

keep this time I should not forget about

those

boxes you can probably get quite cheap

for some game store I mean maybe but you

know if the NFC figure you can make your

yeah exactly just an

NFC that was thinking it's just some

data it's not like yeah I don't care

about the

fingure just

NFC it's only NFC I care about you just

need a portal as it was called I mean I

don't shouldn't need

that either I mean it connects by USB I

assume so I just need something that can

smooth the port as but so I don't even

need an NFC I just need something that

can SPO being the portal and that and I

don't even need NFC

inment there go this one I can jump on H

interesting I mean I assume it connects

by USB what else would it connect by if

I'm going to play it on play oops it was

on Playstation right I can play it on

might

P

go let me

shake let me

polish light right it's fine it's so

slow tou a slow hope okay and I to do

this but this was easy so there no

problem no why why does that

happen when I press forward and then I

noticed I went too far forward pressing

back like I press forward and then I

stopped pressing forward he stopped in

the air stop going forward in air and I

noticed now I'm too far forward I'm not

going to be able to land on the box so I

press back to correct it and but when I

started pressing Back start moving

forward

again after that start it seems like

they are

NFC p p fell yeah I fell in a bonus it's

fine it's fine um

the Skylanders this Infinity

amiibo

amiibo oh I missed so many

fres what more is there oh kind of

figures coming alive

it's not a figure doing it is the plat

this is the chip in the platform

therefore they have put the chip inside

cards and even made amiibo cards

so let's look let's look at the

fireworks who and see killed the flower

okay this

time not jumping on that one

go

okay

yeah it should be quite large hit box on

that things I should be able

to Lear it pretty easy when

I

not too much came to Qui I Lear quite

and not oh I just did

that

oh come on get out of

there I can't see oh there it is

okay o that was close that was very

close

no no I

got oh now I need to start

over yeah go I need the games are

playable on PS3 that's good then I can

do it stung but panas I got eaten I

think do you get stung by panas get

stung by their

teeth

yeah because I'm thinking like

yeah I don't think it would

be no I'm trying to think

um with the with the tools available

nowadays I might be able to just know

connect the phone by USB or something

and have it raac there as the platform

by running some app communic unting with

the PlayStation through the USB

port I would not be surprised if that's

an

option deadly

neurotoxin W I went straight into that

one what did I do hello wolf I mean I

assume you've been here uh but um you've

been quiet so hello

again I like to say hello when people

are been quiet for a

mind I'm trying to come on slide

again I'm trying to be

friendly hello yeah yeah one your think

he's off the schol and getting set up

for set up for

work I don't Dre anything this here

now sounds like everything worked out

for you

[Music]

I've been

here I

mean I mean

like I

don't why are you here

when power was writing before I think I

think he stopped

writing what ready for all the stuff and

then show up it was kind of what they

going to but yeah I not good

at explaining things and I'm appar

running into these

bombs I'm not good at this game

apparently oh that was

close and apparently Papa wolf has only

been playing this a bit if I understand

it correctly uh because of crowd control

now we just need this see or the the

trilogy the Remake but that doesn't

matter one or other you can choose now

we just need him

to do the whole game

100% y this morning stuff for Papa walk

it's just

SCH breakfast

eaten w

w I'm so go to the edge of the bouncy

thing how you supposed to do whatever is

you were talking about I do not think I

was here for

yeah okay can I not die at

the end of the LEL this

time okay there's this one now I need to

redo

this

no

[Music]

oh such

sadness

100% yes 100% that's exactly what I want

you to do I'll be your guide

whenever I'm

available I like watching people stream

crash you don't need a guide for the

first version H the PS1 version of Crash

one is much harder than the

trilogy uh the Remake the Remake is

overall

easier yeah but the it's not like much

isier I don't think I don't think the

difference in difficulty is much the

it's only the first crash that the

difference

is higher because that one does not

allow you to die to get the gems which

is why I doing this

challenge

swimuit because it's a swimsuit level

wait it is a swimuit

level well it would be fun

if go co

if you could play as Coco but you can't

play as Coco in Playstation One version

but if Co and then when you play like

this CL was wearing a swim

seek

no I lost my MK don't fall in I'm trying

not

to

yeah yeah no also which I

didn't I don't think but yeah I've seen

you

play

uh play Crash for and I I said that to

iic there and that I haven't watched

much no I said it's Ben whatever I

haven't watched much

streams lately I've been so busy with

other stuff

and eh there's much less stream watching

for me than before but I get back to it

but I've also tried to not watch H crash

4 game play because I don't want to like

refresh my memory what

what cuz I played it

before it was a while

I I don't want to refresh my memory

what the game

is okay can I do this now we

go I mess this up

now got mask just in case but I'm

probably going to do this area up

here yeah

problem is I can't see where the mine

is okay can see is okay now go go go

go nice nice nice

perfect go go go go go spin go go go why

did I do

that wait why am I missing so

much wait

now I know what why I'm missing so

much no wait I don't know why I'm

missing so much why am I missing so

much you lost your mask I lost my

L yeah not

even yeah if you say mask and Les I

guess you get person where what's this

what am I

missing what is this

missing half the

boxes always one or two boxes I'm using

half the Box isn't mque

also yeah mask is Swedish for worm well

want to scre that level

then level is going to be like

[Music]

that

there you

go just same well that was a waste of

[Music]

time celebration well you won

nothing un youant celebration for

getting the lives we see the lives out

of

the out of the yeah there we go now it's

a s by Winter

level I mean you didn't pick it out for

the level just that's just how it ends

out jump on the baby P yay twitching

baby okay I have to get all

boxes in the sing

run without failing single

one this an auto

scroller like that

oh

well oh I could die could pick up the

life and this skip into the water

quick cation jumping

on this sounds

weird I'm cheing on for jumping on baby

anals B animals baby animals okay come

on now

at least they put that tricky one early

on

so no went the wrong way yeah I going to

skip this

one take take take the

life pick up the you and I both know the

baby polar bear deserves it

why

[Music]

think about the same time to respawn and

quicking

that

respawn why I was so

close look what I just see

causing you to miss boxus and having to

restart yeah how dare

you

that's look it's

snowing

yeah how hard should that be to pick up

there we go now I got the

knife come on

now come

on go before the first checkpoint

so I have to start regardless I have to

get in this I'm going to SC up something

I really should just Place through the

whole level even if I miss this

one I missed it

again like that I miss that one anyway

so even if I

got the uh the the double stack boxes

there that keep me see I would just miss

that one anyway

so so I'll continue until I die at least

then I car

St

oh that's not a TNT why am I avoiding

that T I mean it's not a long

that oh you can't do that oh I died oh I

can't restart

yet now I can

restart why is it so difficult I don't

know why

they why have they placed the boxes like

that that's just

rude okay I'll do it this time watch

me wash wash

me I'll do

these

oh come

on there yeah I got that one can I get

every other

Bo but didn't crash in

that anyway so I kind of

f so

yeah that's this box because I misre

it

okay nice green

boxes

go I should be able to do

this this no I missed that

one oh

[Music]

let

start oh crash

box Po's face how

embarrassing yeah they don't do that in

Crash

for what a shame

right yeah there's no

eh there's only the

skeleton in Crash for with the underwear

There's No Other Des animation that

contains on

way how

boring there we

go I just need not need to mess anything

else up which I

need H I still I still

haven't this I I still haven't been able

to touch every box at least once in

separate runs there's still one box that

is so far Untouched by

me so I have to go and touch it and then

I have touched every box at least once

and then the challenge is just doing

every box in a single

run

and the box is up

here all right there it

is and I miss it again supposed to get

that 11 supposed to get that one

prediction how many times this will take

I can have prediction how many times it

will take for the next polar

level

people

so this time I'll do it trust

me at least dur normal game play you can

just use the checkpoints to your

advantage here we go I'm starting to get

better time now oh come

on and then alate out at least I do that

first one more

consistent

well so yeah I think I take these parts

around the green

boxes and then it's just this one around

the

corner there we go that's how you do it

and

now just one box I

missed so it looks it looks do yeah I

mean it's obviously

do obviously

do because I'm pretty sure the game is

not designed that require you to

die that would be very strange the game

design at least it's at least it gives

me a challenge now for

once

I'm almost at Max

lives oh no okay let's restart

immediately

um

okay let's do

this yeah that's that's why I'm messing

up I'm just wearing a swing suit in a

wind LEL oh it was standing on top of it

that should

[Music]

be

okay I need to get into position

here there we go that's how you do

it and that one too good

good okay some

too

don't miss that

one oh that was

close go and then this

side and now I should get across these

bombs box

bombs and then the fine on the

challenge no I missed it

[Music]

no

[Music]

no

no one punish not

impressed yeah I'm not impressed

in either

either there we

go have disappointed oh I missed the

first one that

was that was a new

one

I am a disappointment to the feral

bunny

so

there we go that was that kind of forgot

about that and that was that

one then it

just one challenge

left eating

popcorn and being

happy

I'll be happy like

that when I complete this

level I

see oh oh W almost slipped off the

edge

oh I keep missing

it why do I keep missing

it the eye chest SC do before jumping on

animals is SS he's just riding the

animals he just jumps up on top of them

when they ready he's not sus with that

he he little kid rolls with

it

and he brings the the animal to his

house as well oh

my glad I'm not the only one who think

so did did not make that sound

better I

didn't oh

well I'm glad to help

yeah R was the first choice of word it

was the perfect description what's going

on

here who whoa whoa he just slides

away okay this is taking all

day this is taking all day

crash is going to ride the polar

bear I mean at least Koko doesn't do a

weird eyebrow wiggle before she rides an

one now I miss the first box and the

last box

because both coko and crash rides

animals

in in the trilogy why why can't they

ride each other's

animals why do they have to be locked

out of their

levels coo is respect the she

right yeah she

doesn't yeah crashed it just jumps off

he he has this does his weird eyebow

wiggle and just jumps on onto the animal

right it the

cliff messing up and and M stops and

just throws him off the cliff and then

he while coko instead does not Weir the

eyebrow wiggle still jumps on to the

animal still runs into Cliff but this

time the animal just jumps

off but then because she in then then

she coms with the animal before she

leaves no that was a complete wrong

way

oh yeah and crash jumps on the PO bear

to get extra lives te are so

hard yeah they are made of wood the

boxes are

hard I think the uh ey wiggle was s was

a thing he did in the first game it was

more more align with look a wild animal

let's let's just ride on

it and and it was to give a timer before

the game starts but then they changed it

here so you have to walk up to the

animal before

you R it so they don't need the eyebrow

wiggle but they still kept it in I yes

sing on a

polar

yeah now driving the polar

bear operating the

PO there we go that's that's what I have

to

do

that was all I had to do okay now

let's let's complete this

level oh there's one more challenge but

I'll do it don't worry about it I have

confidence I

have on

Dance

anyway here it

[Music]

comes the last tricky

box and I got it I am the best crash

player

to I mean after doing this like 20 emps

I I I might not be the best crush crash

play is

so this

who yeah cuz he was H riding the tis

what oh yeah crash games has always been

a

bit naughty I

guess which also shows in the names of

the outfit in Crash 4

which is why you can suggest even some

Nory references for Coco outfits crash

Crush let's

go yay I think oh no what puts me out of

100% crash is the time turns H do crush

crash two and one does not have time TRS

on

PS1 and on the Remake they do not count

towards 100% they are extra

material so don't worry about time

trials if I technically didn't do the

time TR in one and two I should go back

and do

them you did did it good job no job in

that

one oh yeah yeah the the first crash

game boy last game with snow

job so they kind of do these

names so no problem suggesting names for

COC COC pump outfit for the mod that are

a

bit

fast

why did I walk into that why did I fall

down okay I'll do the rest of that let

to see what me like that's you're

allowed to

do okay doesn't seem too

hard so let's see if I can oh wo wo wo

wo

oh

no no why is running sideways crash is

this game buggy or

something now he saying that because

people like to say

that

yeah the remakes of

buy okay but

the game have some of their own issues

too nice to know that one and two aren't

required the war are pain they're not

pain they were

easy

RI yeah you can come up with some runchy

outfit just uh put it here and

just join my Discord server if you

haven't there you can go to the general

main

Channel and look up for the name the

outfits the topics that I've started and

then you can come up with brunchy outfit

names for the

outfits at least for something like

the bikini could have

something

cuz that one is a

bit

interesting if that's a good

pry now want

land at least they put you back you

don't have to back

TR they could have been more evil

require you the back

track watch out for that one and do not

fall like I

do there we go hey why did it fall over

the B hasn't hit one

here did Tri

something there it

is no run straight into that

one well that one come came as a

surprise

okay let's do the

bonus bo bo okay okay time for

that

wa you have to take that pass I thought

it was an alternative pass

okay this one requires you to do the

side jump I think I don't think you can

get over there with the normal

jump

woo quite an easy bonus compared to

previous

bonuses

okay I didn't make a mistake

here whoa whoo whoo was that mistake no

I didn't think so yes it

was w w w w

[Laughter]

w

oh no I no no the stream is

dying sorry about

that the

stream was about to

die let me just take some of

my

back

to I hope this stream is working now I

saw it go down to red and was probably

stuck and

stuff H but now it should be

better just a computer cing sometimes

it's strug streaming

oh

ads someone right SM Point

ads this everyone

here they should

it's maybe maybe yeah maybe there a mix

can trigger and send command

a automatically

automatically so I don't have to do man

would be very

nice

okay almost been playing this for 3

hours but I wanted it to go for a bit

longer how much longer I don't

know

there we

go okay there's one here there

this and that one sends me straight into

it keep forgetting it oh don't jump e

and

jump what you said don't

jump go go go go and I fell into the

hole into the hole why is this no in

here that you have to walk up to to get

the

portal covers like half the

vortex

yeah spaghetti I have the eaten

spaghetti in a long

time maybe I should make some spaghetti

I'm not going to activate every

mine they are

mine Ying of mine

no don't walk into

the all the things yeah not sure why I'm

doing that not trying to intentially do

this I want to go 9

knes okay let's see no more mistakes now

avoid

that

boom that's it

over and under that

go first I meant after B no after the

split has been done well I'm still on

the ground it's fine oh all right that

seems affecting them fine

don't jump into that

one

jumped got the Boost and then

[Music]

jump

bonus okay bonus is at Le

easy you can just do that with a regular

jump okay

then next challenge can you do crash too

without the slide

jump no because you can't get cross

here D only 94 lives left and now was 96

lives

left a plus the one I have

currently

I crash when

I am actually doing

this

go wa I did

it

there it

is be challenging especially when I Bell

flop into

the that is not

help okay good good

good the eel deal oh no it's got two

gems look like a green

gem

yeah because

in in CR one is actually only

the G St require no

death every everything else which is

just the keys does not

require

uh

death so

technically no I'll

continue continue I've

done it adds more

challenge

W oh Sports play that sounds like a good

idea no I land in front of

it challenge over for begin I'm doing so

good n no SL jump that

is wait when do you need Oh you mean

yeah you mean I wanted to complete the

bonus with that SL jump

yeah and that was the same in go hydrate

poster

check and that was the same in R three

similarly that I was going to say

that

oh what you're not supposed to land on

those anyway when I did the no power up

run it was only mostly only bonuses that

caused me

issues otherwise it was pretty

doable like levels in general it was

yeah was only boxes that cost cost me

issues oh but the actual levels actually

completing levels was no problem at

all who now I have to back

trck wa should have better that

yes no oh no

okay

well still have a gem

so I will bring it to to the to the end

and then I will take the

boxes

go second

run

no

I think there's a box here yeah it might

activ I don't think it's activated by

the green I think that's the thing they

added

in in the

remake how see of me

but I guess checkpoints are useful for

me

now and then the crystal should be

here

well unless there is another case of n

you got get more boxes because I said

so

no anyway I'll

continue now we got

those although should I should I apply

the same rule to the crystal by the

way cuz I didn't die before I it up

should I

just should I also get the crystal

without dying is that all the

requirement when I can do it is it's not

really going to addend much a

CH because I just get it when I get the

old boxes anyway

so I mean I could just add it to to the

challenge just no one is going to

complain good

question oh it's not some no you didn't

do it fully because

I down

here because that's also a

gem a lot of

gemstone you picked it up

before no it was out the way I okay

yeah I unpick it up right now but I

willo

it

you think I should

restart just to make it more challenging

as a

not you know what I can do this let's

let's just start an actually do the

challenge after this level since you

already got it no no

no no

no I'll show you I'll show you I can do

this I'll show you I'll show

you there go makes it

easy

no I didn't touch

it

don't thank you for not doubting

me yeah I want a dumble mask

here

no invisibility did not last long

enough I had to

try okay there is one more thing I could

do but I do have to stop making

mistakes

do

this oh I landed on it there we

[Music]

go crash got

cleaned all right let's

see and see they can get start

with and someone's going to say that

this is

cheating I

mean oh come on one more one more you

want one

more I hey wait what am I Ling

count I did bu wait super triple double

mask what's going on why I'm not getting

a mask

di by something inter

then there we go I don't think that that

was making it work

but

go so now

I have the

M now if I just can't keep

it oh

my why is it like

this I Le should remember how many times

I've died or I did quit the level I did

not like complete level again yeah

remembers

remembers like how I want it

to oh no I missed

now to get go through man

any okay there we

go I have to kill them because that's

putting me at the risk of

dying okay let's see

there you

go e follow me that

makes

okay let's get rid of this

stuff this

stuff this

[Music]

stuff

[Music]

this stuff there we go now it's safe to

go

back yeah the water yeah don't touch the

Pea

water don't don't touch the watch it

while it's

pain look it's safe wait on this

part look it's

safe I'm back to nor what

happen

okay did I hear

the the boun sound on it but didn't

die maybe not do that

yeah that

things yeah that's more

like this's need the bonus let's not die

on bonus and lose some only Mon it's

just lemonade it's perfectly safe to

drink you cannot plan to die like

that I said I didn't want to die to lose

my mask but apparently I just I looked

at the perspective

why the H they put a invisible wall

there

ridiculous I was paying attention to

where it was

Landing okay

there I guess that was the one

considering crash taking damage from the

water when it touches

it

[Music]

ooh no wait

what I wanted the enemy to respond I

didn't want the wing to respond the

wrong thing

[Music]

respond

he ex are salty

even wait wait that

me what

what

oh well at least I did pick them up

now why doesn't this work why why is the

game

so like that that's what I wanted to do

that's all I wanted

and yeah that's not hard but sometimes

he just doesn't want sometimes now you

die you did land on it you even did spin

on it but

now

no in guess I'll just take this stuff to

the end and complete it I don't have to

worry about this anymore

so I don't have to worry about the green

gam yeah there is a way I need to go

home or 49 or

79 boxes

okay

Green Gem

gathered g g

g okay me your time oh is it because I

got all crystals 10 of 25 crystals

you're on your way I'm running low on

power so communication from this point

will be difficult again be wary of the

pathways between War BRS remember I'm

counting

[Music]

remember I'm [ __ ] and this game also

allows you to even though

you even though I unlocked the next war

room and can fight the boss I can still

redo this level they do not allow you to

do that in a remake for some

reason probably to highlight the new

portal that one maybe I don't

know anyway I got the Crystal and green

g so now I just need to get all the

boxes

okay oh I need to make up this box we

go now

doesn't matter if

I to do

funny for me that would

not my headphones

again music is still playing

so this time I should do it on time in 1

minute 2 seconds or something from that

person and the rules still applies pick

it

up it's basically everything I pick up I

need to pick up before I die the first

time in the since starting the 11

starting from the start of the 11 who no

one slipped off

there why don't I remember the timer of

the first

[Music]

level P stop okay so if

I yeah that's fine that's fine I just

need it's

fine yeah fine fine fine no that's not

fine now I don't have any MKS

then this is not

fine go go go go go go go go I need mask

I need

MK oh

no oh no I messed

up

all

right I can't do this I I need this D MK

oh okay this

is probably

need was there uh okay you know

what get didn't I do that didn't I get

box them I think I did I'm pretty sure I

did

I was one a scon in the rest while

camping it stung me on the bottom of my

foot that wasn't very fun okay I need to

get like

that that wasn't very

fun okay and I get a starting

mask G you say like okay now you're

intentionally killing yourself here just

take the

mask or like oh you intentionally kill

himself you're not getting a mask for

that at least the game does not make a

judgment because how is the game

supposed to

know I mean okay certain

things go go go go go go go go go go go

go go go was the first thing I

[Music]

did don't

miss oh no I wasn't supposed to break

that now just start level

anyway I could feel the Venom spreading

up my leg and all the way up to my

he yeah I got the

gem but I needed time with

G I guess this was the start of the

experimenting with h gems with time TR

in Crash then crash really make a fall

out time turn for every

level

I was waiting for me I'm

rude

okay ah got a gem nice nice yeah it is

very nice can I stop doing

that no I do that

again

was B Quicky I get away from that

one yeah I basically have

to near uper path but I'm wasting so

much time on that

yeah so that does not work so I need

kind of need a mask there I basically

need to not waste the first mask and

have bomb or

something always breaking

that I've done that two times

now he not

war shouldn't water flow through that

port in there you see water

just dropping constantly spawning

watching I only got 8 lives left I need

to be

careful go go go

go Full Speed

Ahead there we

go now it's

Maxum oh I tou It

Anyway of course of

course why not can I jump on there

no see I didn't break the shick this

time sure you can't get higher than one

level but we'll see

so back to

18 go

go oh run into that

one yeah

sure

can do this right

yeah the timing between not not spinning

the bomb and spinning the plant is very

very

short I

think oh I'm starting with

again there we go I'm back

s

[Music]

stuttering he a bit

[Music]

inconsistent the yellow Jam what's up

P wait in in in what

this is

this don't remember how to get the which

where the yellow there was we'll see

we'll

see

both both thing crash three and there

four it's very

easy

there we go

finally now I

can oh wrong

way

no no

a swi it that seems like a good idea

hello

yto hi pon have

one nice

kind girl I don't know

like and like the yellow

gem yellow gem in like in this

game I assume that's what I

mean which never was it I mean the game

tells me which never is is not quite

like at least

that

go H

[Music]

me boosting straight into

it okay this is going to be

hard I basically have to go through here

nope

I was so close to the missing me so I

could doing it cool down get around

it oh no a

checkpoint it's fooled

me I can't quit

yet I don't want an nextra

checkpoint I want more masks instead I

want start with a double mask

do I have to go to a different level

that is shorter or something and end

with m or

something yeah none of these levels are

easy none of them are easy enough to do

that cuz you can start with double mask

it would make this so much easier with

the game clearly does not allow you to

get double py mask that

was oh oh no someone is

leaking one one is getting

leak what am I

doing

oh no the P Pon is leing

back I have to quit maybe I should just

do another D and hope to end with the D

or

something yeah yeah yeah that was that

was that was the worst wor a horrible

that went

horribly okay we go on to the next level

in

then do or

later TR to see if one of these contains

the yellow gem or not you the

back wait this is is this

the this level

with

with the extra secret thing in

[Music]

it

no this what this level almost contains

a bunch of water maybe yeah when working

SE what was my attack was it on that

long is a good idea to put on a

swimsuit yeah when P pom works in the

sew she puts on

her Rainbow theme one pie s it a good

workout

with more

sense oh that was

close need yellow J

pleas let me guess I need a jell

gem

eh come on H for additional box I went

to okay I will just no wait I didn't

pick up G Crystal oh I had to restart

anyway they

screaming yeah that's scream

okay this level is not easy so let me go

back

here apparently I can't do it unless I

jump PE water I mean lemonade not PP

water at one I should I should serve you

pink pink uh yellow lemonade and I

should call it pink

what probably serving

some Serv some juice orange juice

losing so many lives in my

room

get rushed by that pill can I stop just

missing the pill and falling into

water what Mak things

easier

okay yeah really really try to running

into that

one I need to go over

here oh I exploded the TNT but it was

fine

get away from that

one okay that's what I need to

do now I just need to not mess up

here I canot carry my stuff it's

fine okay hurry hurry hry Oh yay this is

the yellow one I see I

see see it was easy so

that Well I this sh in a bikini or

swimsuit at least yeah it's not a bikini

one be

SS see the yellow gem was

easy y okay it took a few tries to be

honest it is easier in Trilogy since you

can just start with a double mask

instead of a single

mask it makes it so much easier

[Music]

uh okay back here then now I got the

yellow

gem really wearing the swimsuit so for

the

seage it's my workout fit okay it's a

very cute

workout you can have cute work

me

see Lemonade oh

no I do not recommend drinking super

lemonade okay

that's look the the yellow gem is

unlocked

they are quiet

now nothing then what's this let's see

got focus on this

first oh nice nice oh

no ah I saw the gem I SW the

[Music]

gem perfectly safe to

drink oh oh nice nice drink what is it

what silver lemonade SE lemon I mean I

personally wouldn't drink it but it's

safe to drink

nonetheless ah

yes

that

that was that

yeah think oops I think I've heard that

one

[Music]

before it is perfectly safe to

drink why don't you drink it then well

I'm not

stupid I approach it from this way

then now it Trigg

for I didn't know what's this

game this game is

interesting wait why am I even trying

this I was supposed to get the the

yellow gem pass anyway

I didn't even have any boxes I

think that was

easy see those makes

noise I can't make that noise

though on oh nice

nice gu that is pretty long oh thank you

for washing the floor and so I got

it where does this leave

then the

[Music]

exit cuz I already got the gem I okay

just finish the level

normally oh my what we got

well I guess I'll finish to my level

normally

then okay I can't go past him nice

jump yeah didn't help me much

though oh my oh my I think I P that last

time

too no my spin didn't

L my

spin

oh okay that works for some

reason I wonder to far behind y due to

the interet is I

had I need to do

that this one is a bit Speedy oh I

missing

here we go no no appar

not I guess I just have to remove

every there we

go wait another little yellow gem

H what's going on here is this where you

come

up I can

experiment so this is just

uh I got it game

nope what wind

[Music]

oh yeah this is

next who at least I can take this chem

and then I can focus on

boxes po check

okay sitting I'm straight hydrate I can

do that cuz I got more

drink yay I got something

oh better than

nothing but I do

want one it's one step on the

way now let's see if I can do

it getting all the

boxes

[Music]

well I forgot it doesn't look around

like me the Hest thing well no I slipped

off it it was

slippery okay so I don't need to G

yellow Jem as far as I know hopefully I

don't

need

[Music]

there

bonus

Bess

un unboss

unboss don't do anything we

G this this is weird game I just told

you it's not doing

yet

okay I think that's one of

them

w

okay apparently I can I have to remove

this whole

[Music]

thing might need

for triple mask oh nice I do want a

triple

mask inis

ability

[Music]

whoa

whoa Bounce from that wait shouldn't

I my

deist oh there we

go connect put no ium these activates

fin all right time to go

back

you to back I told you to come back

coming back to clean is

because the other one

left

no there we go there's the gem I did not

need now I got

everything

well the

build ended just before I got to the

enemy very hard to see

the the that lost but I mean you can use

assume

this this crash thank goodness I hoed

into cortex's computer and found

detailed schematics were an improved

cortex Vortex and a suspicious looking

space station I'm not sure but cortex

might find

[Music]

cortex

Vortex Vortex and C Bear down you know

what this means there's another bar

level can I buy

this oh it's going to be riding a bear

how many attemps will this take you hear

the music oh

be I see what you did there instead of

oh there it's a whole bear oh oh there

oh there oh there oh

there checkpoint don't need

those oh I missed

one

[Music]

oh oh yeah that was easy that was much

easier

so give me some of a challenge

game I say often but but

still

oh

tight I'm

now like you see them stand there and

then like the time it takes you to Res

you should lift it

up

yep but so I have to

start some some way it feels

easier soon your time is

up didn't want the

challenge I want a bad

challenge sportware for Winter level

that sounds

good it's very

appropriate

I guess I guess for plush makes sense

you can have

like a short shot so you can take col

with

her come on which would keep you

warm wash

for back

riding I

see

you Tred to be

clever so yeah if feel like more

things maybe if this time

corly oh yeah we one

to

waa I mean I fail the gems I can like do

this am I going the right way oops okay

I failed that too so I

went yeah but i h can't buy these

[Music]

puns okay we stop making them

then pun these

B P be

P Wing

WI

wiggle those

eyebrows miss that

box it's just a box this on Ice that is

so hard to get I really don't get how

supposed to get

these first

ones

these oh then missing

it

and I don't know like there is sick can

I miss that point doesn't matter

but

no I went the wrong

way but at least we can look at Pon P's

be belly she doesn't have a bar

belly she has a bunny belly

boom okay I did pick up that one without

lying let's go

backing

okay yeah you can go for these extra

lives

but be like it these are the extra boxes

that I did not get what I did to the

level last

time not

problem wo wo wo wo wo wo that one was

strong all of a

sudden I mean visually it does not look

to be that strong yeah I st from start

Lev even alter start of the level it's

still the start of

level because if I enter that Port again

if I quit the end the port again it will

still be that right it is

fine come there we

go

here we go come on come on

perfect and now back to the normal level

of course we I have to backtrack to

anything here I don't think so

no and now I can do

11 time

did you enjoy my

P they

were

fantastic

unbearable very

beautiful I mean they

okay I think the only only one that

wasn't a joke I gu would be b b b

because it's very

contexted and and and I like one pun SP

B so it's fine

I'm not I'm not

biased yeah that one stays up for a long

time

okay one fruit one box give me one life

okay there that's how you do

it like a

pro not like a pro you know what this

means but it gets even

worse because in the crash 2 you cannot

access the special warp room you get

back to regular warp

room and

then you have to find a way to get to

the special war

room to tra to level in the first place

I know and now I can confirm that there

are no boxes here

so it's going to be too hard

to access it I can bring a mask with me

if don't lose it on the

way this SP should that be too hard to

access there we

go this been missing me to the speci war

room then I can go to this

one to only to just toet try it come I

shouldn't do any mistakes this

time and I will not try this time

because I bring a mask with

me

go go go

go there we go

beautiful let's get rid of that stuff

you should make the put level

easier

okay now we got D mask Oh no I

got you got nothing

okay I wish I didn't have to pick it up

but checkpoint counts towards

[Music]

boxes no no don't think con

sometimes it feel like it takes a while

for a box to

break which of course gets confusing

when when ium past it and then I don't

see it break and then I confused didn't

it

break

nice little

skip keep over the

mo wrong timing might

that

[Music]

like me it to be like that oh then we

got the whole party in here and lot the

licking and P do not seem to have be be

laked no you're licking at

Che

here was where I

fa i f again come

on come

[Music]

on

oh this annoy to his

try so so annoying to

retry one and half I got like 50% extra

stream

today so I compensated you get 50%

compensated

so did that like five times at the start

or

something start with us initi mask so I

go to the next place with double mask

O say why is it disabled it is

enabled kind of weird coming out of N I

guess it appears like that to show that

now you unlock this even though I want

have it unlock

and for this also kind of weird to get

to a portal that has not yet been open

I do not know how to do it

make it's been a while haven't really

looked at that

me whoa wa did not want you to do

that that was not

necessary

okay so I don't need to backpack

everyone so now now I'm back here again

I'm kind of looping around on the

level I'm using this level to access

this in the first

place I lost the mask and then beat up

the mask again from the same box

and I could upgrade the mask to a level

two mask for the same

box

there we

go but yeah it's not this part that is

tricky one it's that box for which for

some reason I P like over and

over go go

go I'm

going

I'm going so much at the moment look at

how me

going have you seen someone go as much

as

me yay I did the

bonus

soundless

okay there we go I hesitated a bit but I

did it I did

it I not go for it when I waiting so

long for it that's th no that does not

have

boxes at least isn't at least it's this

one that has the alternative opening

entrance start position this not the

first one with blue platform then they

have to

do that okay I should

not might forgot about these and I had

to start

opening

nice

[Music]

so now I just need

to

I've never seen someone go as much as

[Music]

you maybe someone day I will be able to

show how much I can

go my what the spin sound so late there

we go wo Jim I got it

[Music]

Jame SP timer

over yay that was that was

annoying oh it was so

annoying we don't need to celebrate for

it we need to save

it I mean if it would happen so the game

for some reason crashes that's is

crazy

I just go back and get to gy without

doing CH challenge properly CU you know

I'm but that might have been

obvious

musi

welcome you make me so happy when you

show up everyone makes me happy when you

show

up egg hello have I seen you

before raid

message nice nice red message love loes

hey P hello

Mii Mii M

oh WF looks like you need to subscribe

to

musi here we

go is just slash out

that boom I did

it good news I got the emulator o

misbehaving how did

they C of the lamp stream go I will you

can you can say as much as you want when

I when I focus on this part for now and

then I will come back to no I one oh

no oh no died

anyway hey I haven't played crash in a

very long time and I would love to watch

you played to the big p I have not

played the Cult of the Lamb anything

I've only watched watched people play it

that

and and I have watched a lot of

different people play different parts so

it's a lot it's very confusing for

me like reading a book in random order I

do not know how that game

works I'm currently doing a crash

challenge I've decided that anything I

collect in the

game I must

do uh without dying before I collect it

can die after I collect it it's

basically using the rules of Crash

one there we

go that means I can only do this whole

at this holder on without

[Music]

f

I need to get boxes in one run I cannot

use checkpoints to retry a certain

section checkpoints are meanly mes

me here we

go did I get that one it did not make a

sound sometimes they don't make a sound

we'll see

and I got that one so so if I didn't get

that Bo it's going to be very annoying I

jumped too early I thought I was going

to run off the level so I jumped in

panic oh well I guess I have to start

over stinky going to catch it next time

so I did the bus bus cause you

trouble ohing P that's that's a cute

Point got there hello Roxy cute fun by

the way thank

you

it's thank you I did not draw her myself

I'm not that good hello P Pon hello yeah

Ro extra lives yeah because ex only

matters for for checkpoints in the first

place con

I'm wondering is Crash the reason why

Subway star is

popular I have no idea

maybe Haven s about

that H I guess you can get it

now

and I'm doing

the no this to get the

Gem I my head now have a good rest of

stream F fun chat thank you for being

here

red was nice to see you have a good

day

blanket don't don't say you're not that

good you made your

own I mean they're not as good as my

model stream I think I think my model is

really good that's because I didn't make

it I wanted to like practice drawing

until I get as good as

good

emotes I'm GL you like them I'm not

saying my emotes are

bad I mean I

like I think I could like redraw a bit

better but I think I

should oh no I missed that

again I can I can practice more of the

level though oh

not can you Dr pum in other PES really

well

too wa where is this SP position there's

no checkpoint

there

iy yeah I mean I really miss the Box

anyway so the idea is that I will

use um three

model because you SE my stre models at

least and I hope I can make something

that looks as cute as the

2D model and I'm open for all critiques

for that model because I do want the

replacement to feel

as to feel as

good I feel as good as the one I have

currently I get a check point okay yeah

sit up better get my drink

but yeah I hope I hope everything is

good with with everyone here everyone in

chat ra just included me such

a yeah I'm trying to and I'm trying to

make the bear not get

hurt that means that I don't get a

gem it's for personal

reasons

we go almost run me S one does not help

me actually makes it more annoy oh no

makes more

annoying I need a seat but for my would

give

me

mode that is actually a good

point yeah yeah having having the

shoulder strap there keeping place

kind of like a chest

strap

strap really making you

secure please hit that you're taking

care of

me making sure

I keep good posture as far as I I know

posture like I'm S I don't have like a

camera showing me myself I for C with

that I was a person not comid with that

right use it for

whatever there's no run run run run

there's no restrictions for or how my

emotes can be

used oh no

no okay what I will

do I would continue through the level to

just

see what the level is like cuz you can

do that crash one when you're trying to

go for a box gam it it's cuz through

rest of level hitting every mine just to

see the level to practice parts of the

level you can do that but then you have

to start all over when you do it

boxes in full

speed hey

Legend

but problem is of course I need a g for

that of

course that it's a bonus level and that

you can't access that war from other

than Ser

sec

and it's very annoying for that

reason

anyway let's do this level a normal

level for

once yeah I

mean I had already to died so I couldn't

get the Gem anyway yeah right you got SP

those so it's fine I didn't lose really

anything that was why I was planning on

restarting or like

quicking didn't need to but I did

it what we there we

go

that's

throw it's just

that no no no wait I have

died why is this game

buggy

now I

have

weird very

weird because uh if you die but start

from the start did I die and start from

my checkpoint I can't remember

that that was

dying start start should not count as

the best did not in Crash one it does

not in Crash three so I don't see why it

would be crash

two

no maybe I did die and Spawn from here I

was just not paying

attention

maybe I to take the Replay for that

this very happy here keep me

company here

some you're you're so hold

time a whole

ink

oh

the Heat box of the

flame if if they don't want you to jump

over it at least make the flame

tall have the

monkey shoot the fire a bit forward and

up at the same

time when that

[Music]

happened go it's

your yeah like from the Florest left

side yeah yeah like in Crash

one think I forgot to enable these

enable speak those before which meant

that I would finish level with two

missing boxes and that

would very I good see I died maybe I

died this time

because I messed that

up I have not died

yet oh well it looks like crash 2 is uh

wrong what what can I

say

okay go go go hello

man cuz now I only see a messages

first this is

fine I don't my I don't mind the person

writing a lot of messages it keeps me

comping that's nice and I can keep them

company just

is got to go back now okay

wait wait got to come back

now remember the

white yeah I can't even actually I mean

you're right I didn't even realize I

can't even get okay you what okay you

actually remind me yeah there is a

section at the start where I can't even

get

the

wait what do

the now I'm now I'm confus

myself I been here yes yes but I like to

say hello the anyway you been quiet for

a while if I read too much let me know

now you have not too much I don't want

to don't a blood chat that's perfectly

fine yeah I know that section and

there's there's boxes there

me I can't get

the this level G until I get

the

[Music]

the I can't get the level gem until I

find the turn

next

jump can you side jump that and you can

do some kind of slide jump spin thing

thing that's kind of exploiting the

movements of Crash to get over there but

I don't know how to do it and I am not

planning on trying to cheese the game

like that if that's correct

phrase I kind of I kind of want to do me

as intended but would add challenge of

course F enough

yeah I wouldn't playe the game if think

if the challenge requ

it I can crash three without powerups

without the double jump I could use the

body

slam which works at least in the

remake which lifts you up slightly so

you can get up on a one block toer

okay

H normal game play you would just do a

regular to

things

yeah EG is very

Iggy Like

rules there's no rules against all

languages especially not languages I

know I take the responsibility for right

I'm not a big Channel like that I don't

have

like

someone wrting

some okay nothing show me

yeah obviously having like people come

coming here like wait come here like I

think you can break this like

that which does make it much easier yeah

but but having like people come in here

and chat with each other in a different

language and like that can be kind of

weird

in the middle of Sweden porn and race on

the playround this were my days yeah the

good good old

playgrounds there we

go at least I got that

one doesn't mean I missed bunch of boxes

but that doesn't matter it also means

that I don't have to take death Rong

when I go finally go for the

boxes anyway I picked up the gem that

means I am allowed to die

now me I don't need to do the

B just a waste of

time there we go

time to bring this one home although I

did miss the

crystal there's

that but I usually speak Polish fresh

egg of

[Music]

bells that

reference a b a fresh prince of B

yeah okay now I just need to pick up the

cryst no can't spin that

one no

no h

that first time wasn't brok how come you

decided to learn Swedish Aran fun if you

ask

me how come you decided to learn Swedish

pon

pon was

inv there we go can I I do this I don't

I only need to reach the crystal without

dying because that was a

Ru that was a short

jump a good friend of mine Speak sish oh

long

same oh who's your good

friend and nice

S I mean you mean same same you s on

involuntary I

guess there is

is they not there

yet now I'm at Le allowed to

die I already picked it

up I should the complete level the last

time before I

started that means I don't still need

not to do the

bonus my S did not slide long

enough yeah I have a

choice I also know Spanish or I should

say

Okay crash my

boy my boy halfway there but I'm sure

you've noticed

the the last 10 crystals will be the

hardest to together and my

uh our enemies will be sending their

strongest forces to Fortune I'll contact

you again when you have completed the

next

[Music]

one yes time to fight tiny I

guess I speak Spanish and English I Lear

tried learn Spanish in school but was

bad time he and stuff yeah that's kind

of case for me learning Spanish in

school

too so Blanco or

something oh Sports

play I did not pay attention to

that no it's sliding

down well I'll end my life now

Goan seran K Russian oh he diagonally I

don't

speak yeah I mean that's kind

of

oh I kind of waited for a moment

there level became

buggy there we go that was quick he just

did two jumps and he was

out

we

go well

I quick and

easy yeah simar enough punish

simar like yeah and danish not

finish

SM and they also like just

like San kashuan some on are

more minor dialects or major dialects

and there are similarly cases in Sweden

we

have dialects

that are

different speak different use different

words sometimes sometimes even use

different grammar there are still

similar enough that you can figure them

out I just don't know the of all of

them I've been going for 5 hours but

whatever yay hello po I hope you think

I'm doing

well am I doing well in this

challenge no I'm do this

level everything so far is picked up

before I've died first time since

starting from the start of the 11 wa be

one

oh it's been one yeah finish hands and

TI like that

not it's no

problem just need the

effort I guess most people don't have

that what a screen yeah they they have

interesting screams going to see here it

come here they come

no and casan are often considered T of

poish

but language in the right they do use

different alphabets and polish instead I

mean it helps if you haven't established

cuz that's an issue with

um uh the like in Swedish

many of the D don't have like

established writing or their own

alphabets but there are some that are

different than

not but when grammar becomes different

that they would

be I keep messing

up

now you can do this pon

pon this level isn't so hard

I

mean I'm I'm failing at things that

shouldn't even I'm I'm not I'm not

even I'm not even reaching the first

checkpoint yet so this isn't even I'm

not even failing at the challenge I'm

failing at the level

itself on the normally normal game

playay of the level I'm failing it this

is

embarrassing he didn't know there we go

now I got the depression

checkpoint

no let me because it should be

um box in the

way

maybe I should pick up that cuz it

should be oh

nice

nice okay I'm messing

up yeah we start over now and with SL

languages in general you can understand

them if you speak one you could only

consider

that more slamming BL

well I

guess me nor Germanic languages are kind

of

s but I guess that s I'm try to think

of

another language

group Wonder yeah I got

see I guess po polish I guess language

is

weirdly not

been changeed so

much does make me wonder

if

yeah no I don't

know language is so interesting yeah got

don't know such details of how similar

languages

are but obviously it helps uh if you

learn like two SL languages where even

three

likees

need have more to go

on
