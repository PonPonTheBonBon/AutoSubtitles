one of the drawings I should do today is

the community drawing

but and before that

since I'm still don't have a clear

picture of how I want it and

I want people to be able to

give ideas of how to do it

[Music]

I'm not sure more supimas of Pom-Pom

[Music]

so

[Music]

it's one year black in the other white

[Music]

six fingers no it's not what's going on

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I had a bit of a trouble running some of

the games

[Music]

[Music]

and this next Market

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

she's supposed to be a cat you know what

I'm thinking

but the ears are really long and thin

neck bunny ears

bunny is

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

foreign

let's see

my eyes are basically

thank you

foreign

brows kind of hard to see what the

eyebrows looks like

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

all right

and then there's

[Music]

maybe should just be that yes

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

many attempts to get smart right

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

okay thank you for the follow

um

Memphis

all right unless that's like a reference

me because it is swelling

nature

I don't know which element is f

welcome welcome I'm

doing some art at the moment it's trying

to make some

[Music]

um an email

[Music]

foreign

looking for a bit of

a elephant's teeth

[Music]

the

I don't know how many

people recognize this character from

their two obscure

tea obscure game or something

[Music]

[Music]

before

so

trying to figure out how to shoot in

Nick here

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

based on is based on pom-poms

you can handmade an image response

as of course I need to do that

foreign

[Music]

so

if a managing to make something look

good this must accidentally

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

oh

I am

terrible at business

but I will try

[Music]

[Music]

doesn't sound like

something's playing back here hey I said

to have money back in music but

this is something

[Music]

[Music]

it doesn't say

come on

maybe there's some just weird noise in

the music

anyway back to

Five Points

when I got distracted

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

Okay so

[Music]

in the original image some of the hair

it goes in front of fingers

[Music]

maybe that's not necessarily to do

good

it could mean that I could hide some of

these so you could sometimes

[Music]

all right I will have this finger

these fingers

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

like the original image

that's it

The Mask it out so it doesn't show it

through

then

[Music]

but maybe I should add

[Music]

one more here

yeah we'll see about that

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

if I use this thinner pen

of this character actually got a lot of

detail

[Music]

I don't know this is a good idea because

it's going to be rather small

I would if I had it shading it would but

I got the shading

because I'm not gonna get it

I mean I have never done it

[Music]

and I can't be kidding it if I don't try

oh

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thinking this should answer the heating

I think I should hide it

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

and hide this very much shape that would

look good

okay

[Music]

[Music]

similarly if I add

this on

[Music]

thank you for the following

[Music]

welcome

hmm

anything

[Music]

but

eat something

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

that's it

not that great at

least drawings

[Music]

we'll see

[Music]

because my very first proper attempt at

doing an email for Pom-Pom was this one

and then the last email that is for fun

one is this one and I would say that

we're only drawing a few

I'd say my my qualities input

[Music]

hi have a good stream okay welcome

everyone

didn't

thank you for looking

[Music]

I still find it funny when the first

message she sent her but

hey it's fine

[Music]

[Music]

now

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

let me see if I can do these in a good

way

[Music]

all right

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

something in the background

for some reason

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I'm confused

foreign

[Music]

foreign

thank you

foreign

thank you

foreign

[Music]

and something like that

and I guess

you can

put that corner I think

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

mask out I guess that seems to be the

easiest method

[Music]

I decided many minutes

yeah I guess that's 10.7

thank you

[Music]

so this will be the mask

and

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

exactly turn out with emotion I was

expecting

[Music]

I can maybe do some extra twins on this

laughs

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

that's it

oh yeah

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

my eyebrows needs masking out

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

like that

[Music]

yeah I think I think this isn't going as

well as I hope I should probably do it

more

okay

[Music]

cartoony strength

not try to fit as much contain into it

[Music]

I mean it's not terrible I guess but

[Music]

it's

[Music]

the best time

I just need to get used to it

[Music]

I know and hopefully

make it better every time

but I need

color

[Music]

s

let me see

[Music]

I've been working at different documents

now let's just stay fetch

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

Ty

rate

I am

drawing

it didn't turn out as well as I have it

I'm doing my best

when it is the very first drawing I made

so

open hopefully

I will get better at it

[Music]

paper and dry looks cool all right thank

you it's just me being disappointed as

usual

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I thought that one would be the most

fitting or something

oh

I didn't

I need to extract the texture from the

game can I find find

the model's resource is a resource

website

Which models oh they actually have it's

let me just take this model

and then

in this there should be a texture here

we go

perfect

did you give me the exact colors I

should have

others to be fair these are

without the light engine

so maybe I should

change them slightly

[Music]

and I do have an idea of how to do that

[Music]

think

[Music]

so give me a moment

[Music]

I know

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

bye

which does have more detection

[Music]

and the Bell

y

she walks around with a pen for some

reason

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

and finally the

room

[Music]

okay so let me now

maybe it's a palette we take

and it's Pom-Pom

and then type

shell

[Music]

Dark Cloud

I think it was gone

[Music]

delete all old colors

and add new ones

and now let's let's get the coloring

so scheme

[Music]

amen

means

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

tablet

[Music]

now

oh yeah

and skip that part

is that a good car

I mean

looking at this

reference image it's

[Music]

like between

[Music]

this is a highlights in our eyeshadow

think it might work

[Music]

BF buttons

to get the color like this

you feel like I'm terrible let's see

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

laughs

I think this one was a bit tricky and I

thought but

so

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

let's let's continue

let's do

the dressing

pen dress-ish thing

I should

again yeah I feel like yeah between

between the dark and highlights it's a

good car I think

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

and then

[Music]

the earthquake one pixel

I guess it's working

[Music]

foreign

but maybe

there's a box right

[Music]

that's been scary

[Music]

thank you

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

let's see

[Music]

[Music]

let's see how it matches

yeah I think that's a good car

thank you

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

you can't see her hair short except for

two long strands

[Music]

I hopefully it will look it

[Music]

is this kind of the English

[Music]

her ears are gonna

be weird

[Music]

I didn't even know what college

it's a weird one

[Music]

oh

[Music]

but the inside

might

I mean

I guess

looking at the texture again

that should be the inside

yep

now let me create

another color or the outside of the

earning

I think

unless it's meant for the ears to be two

different colors

I don't know

I know what you can do

we can open up the modeling blender

okay let's

bring our blender on screen

[Music]

to bring us to find

thank you

let's add

if we plan to change Bean

uh

where are the Saints

[Music]

guess

uh it's loaded the materials wrong

[Music]

but there you go

so yeah

the outside of the ear is dark

and inside is light including this part

there's a sharp

oven onion then the whole hallway hey

I can't really see it from the front

it's it's glued to the neck

[Music]

laughs

yeah yeah beautiful she

[Music]

is elasticity

let's have pattern here I should add

Maybe

on the and also yeah this part too

yeah I found a way

part part of the hands should be

but very much yeah

[Music]

I still want to do the ears even though

that's

actually not the case

this part darker but it's actually not

turkey

[Music]

so

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

and then I just need something for the

names

by yourself though because this looks

like you you've done something of

graphic design but when it's very

talented I yes I've taught basically

I haven't done any

whether this been basic

Arch

class in school

I guess

otherwise I'm

foreign

figure out stuff on my own

[Music]

but I am open for tips and tricks

[Music]

and then the eyes

and the eyes are part of the head

texture because apparently she's she

doesn't have the ability to Blink or

[Music]

I don't think so no there's there's no

blinking animation she can't look around

she can't blink

modernist teach me

I don't know how to teach

[Music]

so I can draw just never done anything

for teaching me oh have you done some

like physical art as well traditional

art maybe let's go let's go

[Music]

some yeah paint oh

that

I'm interested in

the parasol but

what is

[Music]

oh like

yeah it might be busy which shows up is

the street

and I've seen some

Quality Art

that

some people can be really skillful

and such art

so why was I was going to do the eyes

that was the

this college probably needs to be

adjusted a bit to

foreign

[Music]

have you gone out and done some

art painting on walls

[Music]

all right it didn't turn out as well as

I hoped but

[Music]

yeah it's um

oh yeah because she never opens her

mouth it's actually nuts

there's nothing

no proof of what the inside of her mouth

looked like the only the only thing you

have in most places cinnamon

and this causes that exactly it's just

inside of bus okay I'll take it back if

I I guess what I said

but it's because the dirty so low

quality

we don't have a high quality of your

reference ahead

well I'm an interpreter by trade then I

have commissioned some legal amounts yes

oh neat

do you have any

photos of those

are you done taking a photo and my your

beautiful flowers

[Music]

but good thing that you

actually got commissions for that this

was meant

the status for about I think

[Music]

I have plenty of photos

yeah you have a Discord server too maybe

we posted any day

and kiss

[Music]

foreign

fighting painter

paints away the fires

yeah it's not really

the most beautiful artwork you've done

it's um it's something but

the part of magic

most photos are actually photographs

oh

most photos are actual photographs

member those things

sorry what

[Music]

else is that they mean it's

well I've been

I was busy watching

and Benny playing some crash

and

waiting for the time for the

parting of my own

fish

and it's been

it's been nice

of the photos I have are not in digital

art paper photographs

oh

oh it's like

like with the proper camera with an

old-school camera

when you take the photos of the photos

here

I was there for a little time too

you did you did some

you did some booking

yeah I got all the Retro teams oh you

did all of them you got the last thing

you actually managed to do the dark

level

not having your photo distinction

I like the double negative better not

having your foot is not digital I mean

maybe not having it for this digital or

better having your first nothing yeah

very good

and yes

old Benny wanting your photos physical

what's the next game finish now

[Music]

oh so you're going to digress team Race

you're not going to be interesting

[Music]

Radio One retro jimin

that sounds

I actually don't know it's because I

don't know too Randy

if if those would be harder easier

if they have some crazy ideas for Tomb

Raider

they didn't do for crash

I'm playing Captain race with like 40

minutes didn't captioning that much yeah

it does

Wellness I said I must I must do every

fresh skin

so I guess I'll do that anyway if I can

understand

[Music]

now hopefully that boy I I'll find ways

to have energy

[Music]

one is pretty much Max percent and I've

done now there's an immense a piece of

cake

easy

I know it might be easy

um

[Music]

so

well yeah yeah it's no problem for Penny

he's he's really good at

team Ranger

he would be able to do it hundred

percent all retro achievements

blindfolded

I watched my first

give the movie tonight again

[Music]

oh yes it is tonight

or you you're like seven hours ahead of

me so

mainly her challenge

100 but like only complete it

blindfolded

or something

[Music]

I mean you should probably you should

probably do do your spiral round first I

see you still haven't done that one

I'm still waiting for that one

[Music]

I just want you to complete this that's

what

so this one isn't

something like this

[Music]

in your feet with feathers

and yeah and and the game has to be on

mute as well

[Music]

and then let's play would get done yeah

when anything spider let me know so I

can watch it so I can see what you have

trouble

because you basically have to

at this point clear out the gems on all

the levels

[Music]

I did some calculations there for you

before and as far as my calculations are

you should be able to do it

all right I mean

it should be possible to do it uh if you

ever able to read that no you should be

here Benny will be able to do it I have

my fading belly at the gym blindfold

with Craig's directing me that's that's

another idea yeah that that will work

that could be fun do it like a close

core stream

please

yeah I'm going to say that and then it

can be

funny I was meant to say great sorry for

me

gay can be kind of funny sometimes so

we'll see how well that goes

it's gonna be a funny one

and since this is a

Japanese character I see

she has five fingers

not four

[Music]

stress test it's a chest test all right

nice if you drink

welcome into the club Benny

[Music]

now penny is also a level one bunny

part of the Paw pants

[Music]

why that one

okay here we go

[Music]

pyramid

a small one

yeah can you find me one

step

anyway I'll help you

now you can do a quickie one

do you like

do they do a big one

[Music]

as I noticed that in the

chats they are in sync

yeah you can do it quickly you can do it

tweaking I mean maybe maybe you can't

twitch allows you did quick enough

hmm

science when

Twitch Plays a gift oh we faint

[Music]

oh

yeah

why are you mobile

foreign

relaxing on your phone

because it was like

now you can do it faster yeah but

a mod

I mean I'm a mod on your channel so you

can be a monster mine

opinion that sofa one

I don't just speak like a rocker you

move around

are you even with us I have never seen

you have legs

I don't believe in hamlets I think you

stuck to that sofa

[Music]

foreign

anything else

I think the problem is that I want

picture is a bit stretched out or

something

I made it a bit stretchy it's

outstretched

good thing I'm drawing with Western

investors so I can change the skin

without losing quality

there you go that's my drawing

beautiful as I hoped I should probably

do like a more

cartoonistine

but I mean it's not terrible the help

that was an option

you're welcome in Japanese

Bots from

are you doing a commission

it's still very cool

Benny is cool

and awesome

and yeah I guess it's like it's more

like I'm showing

what kind what what I can do

because I wanted to draw like

one Xiao it was

he

emotes

or Benny

for payment

[Music]

if Benny likes how it looks

so this is the very first time

drawing this character as I mentioned

before before you came that

this was the very first emote it's it's

been asked me that I made out of four of

one plan

and then I have drawn celron

I don't exactly know

[Music]

what did I made an email I think I've

made them in this order

he and then I finally made this one last

which has

I'd argue looks better than before

[Music]

inserting me to make it

I'm not threatening you what where's my

threat

I'm just making the offer

well to be my artist for everything to

achieve honestly it's not that it's not

I'm looking for the artist's Throne or

anything

I want to

he needs to have a parent yeah he needs

to have shallow emotes

[Music]

not to complete be confused with shout

it is

[Music]

yeah yeah

that that would be his brand

she probably move

it to the side

I am the brand Benny

I am the brand penny

Benny's in the brand as a person

[Music]

can you draw 10 hey being haircuted by

the captain

welcome

Elijah Hendrix

and

well

[Music]

I have really seemed to think of like a

request or anything

your damage to join

[Music]

stuff I want to draw if that makes sense

[Music]

but I do want to uh

[Music]

as a strong tune and I'm trying to

[Music]

filled with ideas to draw at moment so

[Music]

but I'm hoping for

[Music]

yeah

and you remember doing that yeah I

should probably find a better way of

doing

[Music]

a second time

exactly

I hope

what about the pain you're dressing a

certain thing in front of pineapple with

an umbrella in it yeah that and that's

something

um

[Music]

yes can you drop any annoyed face

reaction when he can use it

do you have a screenshot of that

yeah I mean at that point why not like

make Benny's face like taking

screenshots from his streams and making

those into English

[Music]

will be some low qualities kind of dark

if like

I don't think that would be good emotes

because the camera I

if you have a kind of small picture

[Music]

it's not like a photographs

ice cream

dancing can you dance on the couch

[Music]

dancing thing

[Music]

wait we're we're happy that my here we

go here's the penny mat let me

[Music]

let me just cut that

[Music]

so

and I guess I live

this is the penny not like means

[Music]

how is it formatted on

[Music]

yeah it's capital letter on each

let me put it on

load it to my own channel

[Music]

why did I keep listening

this is the nut like this

[Music]

made by Bon pan

[Music]

of notes

because it needs to be approved why it's

not easy

[Music]

I can't show it in chat that's a shame

when I see a funny photo of me okay

helping from one day it's gonna send a

paid for this sexy Canon

I'm doing innocent for that kind of

thing yeah definitely innocent for that

you shouldn't be

seeing such stuff

it's a it's it's been in part of that

calendar

[Music]

depends even your phone I don't know

which skin matches the

[Music]

work is a digital business partners

thanks fantasy well

[Music]

cherries give expenses

my love is a shame is that it was

approval but yeah that's that's the one

that's one

yeah the drawing

draw in

that didn't quite great but I wanted to

do a community drawing of

their people

the idea was and then I still haven't

really figured out how I should do it I

want to like draw everyone so everyone

feels involved that would be nice

didn't find many

unless you send me the pic of you buying

buy boxes of white girls cat

do you sell Girl Scouts cookies

Greg are you a girl scout

try the shortest straw

okay

[Music]

oh it's it's been

there it is it is so short it's just a

ring

and actually make the ring thinner

thinner

they go

it is so thin at the moment it's

embarrassing it

it's

a tenth of pixel wide so it's just

transparent

this is one big kind of one pixel

the Pizza Perfect sir

[Music]

that is the shortest straw

destroy is a matter for it no no it's

not it's a literal meaning I did draw

you a Short Straw

has two meanings now he towel has one

and it's what I'm doing right now

you don't change

I decide what things means around here

[Music]

I can also draw a card look at this

[Music]

will be

[Music]

three of bunnies

there will be two bunnies in this one

and then I just rotate it

there you go

I did draw a card

do you like it

[Music]

oh

the if I'm going to draw the idea of

that I should probably have reference

images first that probably need to ask

for that before I can draw that thing

hmm

and then I have to wait for the person

to come online

[Music]

I didn't really consideration the lack

of

reference is sick

okay you got to teach me this software

I mean how am I supposed to teach it

like you get a drawing tablet

and then you basically pick a brush and

then you draw

[Music]

[Music]

I didn't know he

you don't have an angry company but no

because Papa never gets angry okay

because I need a references let's let's

do more company once in the meantime

so what should I draw

[Music]

I can draw on Ms paint this is something

else this app this is a clip Studio

paint

or actual drawing Greg as a Sailor Moon

a mood yeah when you're when you're a

sailor mood you know what what if I drop

on pon

this is this yeah this is the order I

made I mean

did I get it correct

anything

[Music]

and we got those no I didn't get them

chili they came first before

[Music]

I get wrong about it

and what and what drawing that well this

is just a

Wacom Bamboo bamboo fun there is nothing

special but it works

[Music]

I'm confused you you're not using a

mouse no of course not

draw Cutters cutting and stinky you

shouldn't they say yeah you asked me

that before uh I'm kind of

[Music]

you know what you know what

what if I draw a Pom-Pom

as a Sailor Moon

because I don't feel like drawing

something I feel like drawing pom-poms

[Music]

plenty but it is interpreted inside this

this one I can't duplicate Pom-Pom let

me press copy and paste database

so what if I drop on

S as a sailor you call it Sailor Scout

or something

not it's fake I

think

yeah he has a fake eye

Center I know Shantae

I know who she is

can you drop any but my kids

I I could drop any I don't even know

what he looks like

we have seen him but you think I

remember what people looks like

me I mean going against Sailor Moon says

more Kevin

yeah yeah I mean you're not surprised

[Music]

but

why would I

let's let's do to draw classic classic

Sailor Moon pose

[Music]

this is the only

[Music]

I got some of the feature

this figure but I

[Music]

uh oh that's that's wrong stretch

[Music]

she has so long legs

less drop on

a Sailor Moon

hey

[Music]

it will work and if I know what sailor

is in German it's probably some long

word

that's

not as a joke

because I speak Spanish ah yes I have

matarusi

okay it wasn't

oh yeah that's I forgot but that's right

moment

there you go that's it

[Music]

thank you for Scooby-Doo but twice I

started he looked a good point

I mean

start the description of Bendy is that

is that what

[Music]

happened yes that's what I'm going for

don't let this

let's assess yeah okay

all right yeah here we go

out

so yes let me draw let me drop one point

as a Sailor Moon

a sailor month how how am I going to try

this

so I'm starting with the hand basically

and then

the

body somehow

then

[Music]

yeah this is this is basically how

how I draw

[Music]

okay can you make the ears to have eat

I mean

[Music]

it does have long

one does have long ears but

they aren't seen but I guess

I don't know if I want to make the ears

bigger though

but I guess I could

make

the

I'm kind of going the same way but it's

just being shortened

and I need to reposition the legs here

[Music]

it's it isn't

I'll see I'll see I see

that I can do with this

[Music]

is a

crack pose

[Music]

it's gonna

[Music]

leaning

a bit back

[Music]

yes

no this is the head

obviously okay so let's see

if I

[Music]

there's the tough tops

puffed of hair

so for the ears

this would basically go out

[Music]

because I use it basically this long

but the hair should be going down here

or

hmm

[Music]

ears

but the time is it supposed

can I usually you pick the wrong outfit

you should pick you should have picked

the uh

being a sportswear version

[Music]

let me uh

[Music]

get some more water yeah actually out of

water basically what about one point I

Sailor Moon

what about pon pon dressed up as bendy

and Ben intercept a SpongeBob

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I don't see it

[Music]

oh

[Music]

you confuse me

and the king of the bunnies oh I see

yeah I saw some bunnies in those

pictures

[Applause]

certain bunnies

Penny dress is Lara Croft but with

foreign

on account is that what he's asking for

[Music]

and then they're not really punished

[Music]

you're spending

[Music]

and so in his beloved fake machine

I mean

if I had

like

[Music]

a reference pictures of Penny

and then I draw

Benny as

fastest pumpkin

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

this is um

I'm changed this is a weird post but I

guess it's good exercise for me

[Music]

[Music]

and visit my static

but they're definitely front

I guess they're supposed to be

no

happy

now it looks like all the videos on here

so let's set it up

does it exist in high quality so I can

see the details

[Music]

but yeah because if one point is dressed

as Benny obviously she would hold the

weight machine too

[Music]

her thing is a broken

nah she's just doing a weird thing

[Music]

is this

[Music]

are they actually

[Music]

but the picture quite this bad

[Music]

this looks like something

[Music]

and

[Music]

there you go

no that's that's not what I want yeah I

want this one

this one looks to be high quality

ready

[Music]

but this wasn't a weird website

ready if it's like quality I accept it

[Music]

[Music]

doesn't have an entire quality

[Music]

so

with this high quality I cannot see that

she's definitely doing the

now I can definitely see the sleeping

you see

then there's that one in that one

[Music]

but

for me to actually draw that there's a

completely different thing

and

yeah it should be like the other way I

think

[Music]

I I type electronic hands

I've said it many times

this looks

this looks horrible it is

easiest looks

variable

[Music]

thank you

I'm not drawn away

[Music]

um

[Music]

I'm embarrassed

[Music]

well this is

Anton a Sailor Moon

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

uh well I guess you could measure the

time it takes me to finish this one

it varies a lot depending on what it is

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

she looks a bit angry a bit angry

I can do that

laughs

musics chill love some Lo-Fi

yeah I got

some music I'm going to see if I can

expand the library from another

library but I haven't checked the

permissions here because currently the

permission is if you're streaming

you can use the music and just add the

credit on the about page for the service

and that's it

but if you're going to use it on YouTube

you have to credit each individual song

you're using

and so far everything is fine but after

streaming

I take these votes I made that are made

and then I put them on YouTube

meaning that

following the rules

I have to credit every single song I

missed in the live stream

and if I if I'm streaming for like six

hours and I use this song is about three

minutes something but

that's a lot of songs that's like 20

songs for an hour

foreign

six hours that's 120 songs 120 songs I

had to add to the description of the

video

can't really do that

so the question I hope they can confirm

is that I'm allowed to use

the songs without giving explicit credit

to every song If it was a live stream

that is then published on YouTube

what

you mean what's my YouTube

I mean I mean it's it's fun fun of Chris

cheers

unless unless it's the what's your

afternoon in that case it's

[Music]

the regular channel uh contains in my

spider mods and that's

awful let's play

what's the channel is

expected expected as expected

[Music]

let me just change my own

money

no one saw that

[Music]

even though I said it out loud

[Music]

[Music]

here we have to make silly arts and have

fun right

[Music]

thank you

and I think I think

okay I think that's good

there are other YouTubes going better

and thank you

I think it's going like

[Music]

[Music]

I don't think it's going that well

honestly

especially since I haven't uploaded for

quite a while and the reason

why I haven't applied it and why because

I haven't completed someone in a while

I have a video on my YouTube from seven

years ago oh

yeah I can't really have that's my job

is kind of

I'm gonna need all these uploading stuff

on the net

on the cybernet

because I've been so afraid of speaking

online

[Music]

[Music]

I was so afraid of speaking online so

that any attempts of me speaking

making a video to publish made me feel

sick

[Music]

but here I am now

quite a difference

but I have had

[Music]

I need to learn how to make the proper

looking thumbnails and all that I know

how to make the scenes in the LPS but

it's different for YouTube

I mean yes sometimes it seems I think

they are

quite different

[Music]

you know how to make seeds

and I do

and you do have quite a few scenes

[Music]

you might know how to make scenes but

you sure

[Music]

have a mess when it comes to shortcuts

when you want to do something else you

you enabled some one of the two kids

foreign

[Music]

just take a pic and use

canva.com to make a nice I mean yeah

[Music]

um

what is this

oh a design website

interesting

[Music]

interesting

[Music]

I need my main and chatting scenes on on

oh oh that's

[Music]

do you like here and do you like her

quit I don't know how to say it but I

like the giraffe

foreign

[Music]

let's continue

saying this is what takes time being

distracted by

it

it's perfect it's fine it's fun it is

fun

if I didn't want to extract it I

wouldn't

let's stream online I guess

then I would just sit quietly for myself

and draw

and that wouldn't be fun would it

then you wouldn't see this beautiful

scenery

bunny

add to the fact that the name of Sailor

Moon is bunny

that is when it translates from Japanese

foreign

[Music]

or something

but then they redubbed it or something

and kept it as bunny which was stingy

which is basically

keeping the Japanese

mini afternoon

which makes this funny when people

complain about

no keep it as the original English name

yeah but then people also complain no

don't change it from the Japanese Nation

[Music]

how do you want it I know it's different

people

oh are you using steam Tech or you talk

to me no I'm just using chemo shortcuts

I just make sure my keyboard shows that

cuts aren't colliding with anything else

apparently the only keyboard shortcuts I

have is changing the outfit of ponpon

and that's that's it

dream deck is convenient I I just wish

they made it more convenient to use like

a secondary keyboard

you could just buy a cheap keyboard and

use that and then I could just put

labels on the keyboard with the

different actions

that would be convenient because it's

it's much cheaper

it's much more much more keys and it's

very useful

I don't know how to draw this scene from

the front

so I'm just doing something

shortcuts change I guess mute being

serious and efficient it's numb like who

uses that when

I guess that could work if you want to

uh

mutant unmute by looking at the unlock

status numb lock status

thank you

I guess I'm not using them a lot myself

eat

mysterious

Mysteries that keep me are weak late

there are many misses but by the way

Penny you should have enough points to

redeem this sports outfit if you want to

see some bad timing

[Music]

it's like cap stock with numbers yeah

foreign

mode these numbers the other mode is

anarchies and Bishop is the home and

with these numbers do not drag the

numbers we're currently using our

uppercase

there are lowercase numbers

[Music]

let me show you uppercase and lowercase

numbers

[Music]

so

apparently we have these numbers

one two

three

four way

I'm just going to write down numbers as

if you don't know what the numbers looks

like

seven

eight

live and then of course

the capital letter size and then we have

lowercase letter size which is one

two

no I'm not I'm not going to write every

number yet small eh that's not good

that's not what's happening three

or I mean let's let's do the same style

before

bye

snakes

Evan

eight

nine

or if you want nine

zero

so it's six and eights that aren't

changed they're kind of like

they're kind of like the

capital letter that are unchanged

okay kind of like how F becomes F it's

like same height love this episode

styled a bit different

but most numbers are

like one two and zero or same size as

three four five seven nine are moved up

that's really low which is

they are

maybe considered more like old style

digits but the kind of functions as

though case numbers

that was pretty much only for a high

chance

so anyway ignoring

because I totally didn't get confused

about the referring to but

ton I know heck okay

maybe I am okay

let's

let's do that part

how would that fit on her head it would

be obscured here

I mean I could still add it and it just

obscured

it's a bit

he's a bit uneven

[Music]

to drag it down

yes I just have to remove that hair tuft

in that case

you start to be flat here

the Nam luck on the keyboard is pretty

much for hackers because only program

resist those characters are what

did the lowercase numbers doesn't exist

on in Unicode you can't type them the

only way you can get those is if you use

a certain font

that's hairstyle as the style

[Music]

they are there is also a flag in fonts

that you can also

fonts can have the regular numbers and

then they can have the old style numbers

as an alternative Style

foreign

key

it's the uh

foreign

keyboard says it

like my keyboard has that key

[Music]

anyways

to the left it's the key that is not the

shift Keys like the shift key between

it's the key between the shift key and

set key

foreign

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

space bar if you want

uppercase spacebar would that be be a a

space a space that is a hard space as

they call it

on the breaking space

it was very fun to have you here yeah it

is definitely late for you now

thank you for showing up

love you

sleep well again nice the space this is

about in space

it's the uppercase space bar that is the

case that is above the other the the

lower case in the bar that is located in

space I get it I get it I am smart

okay

I'm not I'm I'm not that stuff myself

but I'm still pretty dumb

[Music]

oh

it's funny a beautiful pumpkin

[Music]

as she cosplay

Sailor Moon

foreign

to redraw the fingers 50 times before

I'm happy

[Music]

okay

[Music]

thank you

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

the technology of a computer computer is

not going to hold up

it's too much devices are crazy large

nowadays

[Music]

and if you type Google into Google you

will break the internet

[Music]

should I do that while I finish the

Stream

[Music]

[Music]

if you know I don't do it

yeah you're right I should probably not

do it

with us all in danger nah they just

they dare started you know

[Music]

never be confused for a while and then

but yeah maybe you should

start and stop I mean stop and start the

internet again another will work

perfectly fine

and that's an awful sketch but I went

somewhere I should be good at drawing

skirts but

[Music]

apparently not

foreign

[Music]

skates

have you seen IT Crowd

they didn't be talking about that before

I'm pretty sure with the heat

and how I have watched it

I guess by the judgment

[Music]

S

I thought you were a human

you learn something new every day

goldfish piloting a human body

couldn't even tell if I did yesterday

and please crashed yesterday but I mean

that's all I'm assuming

based on that you played crash today

and luckily twitch remembers that for

you so you don't even have to remember

it you can pretend you know what you did

yesterday

okay

nah I'm not a human normally a mushroom

because there is not much room in my

brain

Ukraine is almashi and Rumi

[Music]

and I just realized that saying that

someone's brain is roomy could be

considered a new stuff

and but um

[Music]

don't blame me for that one

[Music]

regular guys normally keeping it yeah my

kitten is on an adventure he's going on

a vacation today I actually don't know

he was going to try for

hours and Iris olivian is another

regular

is so I don't know

[Music]

is offline

[Music]

I said I don't know what he's up to

but you know my new regular hello is

company I'm a regular News Channel it

really depends on

like when I go and watch a smaller

stream I haven't watched in a while and

they're like oh hello I haven't seen you

in a while yeah I know I have a like

okay

no hey

actually auditions to watch too so

um

yeah

time sounds really yeah this time since

because I have

you can't have no life I mean that's

true too

[Music]

because I basically only see you you

claim that you have a job but

um

or I had a job maybe it's case but maybe

it is more than you had a job before you

started streaming

because he's doing so much I can't

believe

there's been

any form of words

I like watching you stream

another thing too it's not like

a new things who thinks and like I

like I do enjoy some streaming stream

but some other streamers is just it's

more like

but yeah and I've been busy and watching

other people who are more funny but

currently they are not streaming and

you're currently the funniest streamer

you're currently streaming but you can

easily be substituted for another

streamer as soon as someone else starts

thinking

obviously I wouldn't say anything about

this to anyone

bunny bunny bunny

now bunny is one of my

up streamers in the list of streams

streamers I like the ones

[Music]

by the way

she surely should have a wider stance

she at least she didn't have a white

stance body reading a dress or skirt

I'm no expert I'm only been way

preferring wearing dresses in

skaritinson mostly dress is more than

scarce to be honest

it's kind of like my

scene here I guess

so right by funniness I mean yeah

I would have watched someone who isn't

funny

[Music]

[Music]

that way fun fun we are here at PTSD

from last couple of years and it's only

the beginning

yes why

sorry can you can you write it out I

don't know your

crazy abbreviations

and a PTSD but I guess that's not what

he meant

[Music]

but you probably have PTSD as well

[Music]

sure I

[Music]

pandemic thing totally didn't ruin my

life but anyway

prices physiological operations

sorry I I'm lost

ma'am

I'm empty stupid I'm sorry

[Music]

in my life

now

[Music]

yeah

and also didn't seem like you got my

whole joke before about the whole

States of

Australia being upper Australia double

Australia

[Music]

we are being controlled by fear no I

want to live my life

it's hard for you

yeah I didn't get it yeah it took and

then I did the the states of Austria

being

remember

Western Austria Southern Austria

emperorland

and

you got this you're clever what was the

reference

oh no it makes sense now you're getting

it

wanna make it too obvious

all right it's that part

yeah it was it was to it to a high level

of a judge

[Music]

I don't like simple jokes I want them

more at once until I get to when I was

now I don't understand them

and then I make a fool out of myself

[Music]

yeah wait intellectual for me

because you were the one saying mixing

up Austrian Australia so talking about

people mixing them up

I did some mixing up of my own

and I really thought you would get it

because of the uh

no way no because you don't know the the

states of Austria that's the problem

when I have

you're just leaving I'm based on

instincts

yeah the one of the states of Australia

is in New South by the way yeah Bavaria

Bavaria papadia

Bavarian

[Music]

the movement for tree peace and meaning

yeah

what a panic them make make me a world

princess and we'll have peace foreign

[Music]

princess here I make the decisions

thank you

yeah I don't think I can make a better

hand than that

tell you

I just don't know how to do this part

it's a confusing mess of lines

apparently

so it should be something like

[Music]

unless the site is stretch it on gaming

promise oh no

or do you want that

but my gaming prowess is

powerless

[Music]

I don't really know how to do this I'm

just draw some lines and pretend I knew

what I would know what I'm doing

something like that I'll add those lines

it looks fine then right see it looks

fine

you are fine more confidence you should

say thank you that makes me happy

okay these ears are much longer than I

am because they're expecting them to be

but that was soon

[Music]

I'm going to use this thing

you are amazing bunny

and Bunny boy

you know the right things to say

let me think if I should add a clock or

something on this on the screen sharing

my local time does not dream of me

I guess above the chat I could have like

a bar at the top of chassis saying chat

and then right

[Music]

but don't let feelings Cloud it's your

judgment if you know that quote I don't

okay

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

command seems more organized like I'm

more from Star I haven't watched that I

had considered watching Star Wings

in the order of release of course and

sometime maybe

yeah I could limit time but what's fun

with that

[Music]

it's more fun to do like

let's try this 300 white 11 to like 50

Heights but that's too much water hurts

yeah that's a good one and then I'm

gonna hit black

and then I take my text and I will take

what's font

and

SCE PS3 eroding nothing too

yeah a little bottle Maybe

left the nine and then I write chat

and then

make it latching

like this

too large

just like that

[Music]

and then on the other side

[Music]

I have it saved time

a nice Navy dark

okay this one probably has to be smaller

if I click the fit with everything

inside it

like

now yeah yeah this works

these parts

and then I save it and then the and I'll

call it like

an example that's a good name of it

and then I will

add it add picture

[Music]

it is

by an example let's let's call it call

the element in on

and then it comes out to the other side

there you go okay the text is kind of

big that's fun

when I watched them in the original

order of release yeah

that was that was the plan

that was actually kind of big

there was the plane Benny

Benny boy

you think I'm silly or something

there we go isn't that good

we got like the chat here

and then you have the time obviously

I would have to make it a thing that

actually shows the current time

but yeah that's a thing I could do

if it sounds interesting

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

oh there you go

[Music]

is this good

I guess there should be the

bow on the back which is

what is it too much

of course this should be able in the

back

there should be like

[Music]

whatever

[Music]

and also I realized I didn't do any of

that

and Shout out and stuff on here all

right but I mean

I was basically alone here when you shut

up and read yourself

so so the only people who I could shout

you out to was the people you brought

along

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

obliged to shout them out when they show

up

[Music]

it's just mostly like it's not that I

don't watch hot people out it's just

that I don't bother

okay

I like it no that that was I do shout

people out when they read when there's

like

actually people here so I do that

because I can't just jump back for the

rain of course but I know there's like

people who shout out others when they

just show up in the chat without any

raids

I I mean

I don't know

personally for me when I watch other

streamers do that to other people it

feels kind of awkward at the same time

I understand but

[Music]

like I I want to see what people are

while they're streaming like how they

are when they are streaming and I want

to chat with people and then I follow

I just don't want to follow some random

person and never seen stream before

[Music]

okay and then there's these things

I could add something here but then

if I should

it's not even post when I go live on my

Discord I have set that up to me

automatic

maybe you should do that

[Music]

but that's required setting stuff up

and that requires effort

[Music]

yeah I could but I don't need to

no I don't need to hide it but

I set it up for you

let me ask I'm sorry manage

[Music]

I've set up some of the ones for a few

oh but not for yourself

[Music]

yeah I think the bow for substitute the

[Music]

the thing the head thing

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

I'm also quite excited about doing the

karaoke

going to be

so exciting

and I'm going to humiliate myself

but that's part of the fundraise

[Music]

yeah yeah I don't see the point in

posting when I go live we will see it

let's see also on this

nice grammar

and I kind of guess what you mean what

you're saying that's why I have it

on my Discord I have it so

you have to manually opt in to get

paint about

about banani when I start a stream

so you can just join without having to

bother about being notified about that

of course it's going to be a regular

and notification from that channel if

you choose to

not get a pink

but you can as well let's just move to

that channel if you want

so I can't worry much where it works

much heat

okay that's a great idea yeah

it's this

saying I I need to check my survey

yeah yeah I know that some streamers

it's I think it's rare when they like

pink everyone

of course you can mute the everyone pin

which you should probably do anyway

I think I'm on the one

and I think it's changed that actually

but I never did that nowadays no they

paint basically everyone and I kind of

guess that yeah you kind of on This

Server because you are most likely

watching

these dreams

they are using ping bot no pin cord or

the alerts

and then I have the rolls which I use

Hydra for the

outer rolls then which animal are you by

the way you're a dragon oh

Penny Dragon why are you a dragon by the

way you don't have to answer that one

I didn't take you as a dragon person

I expected you to be something like a

possum or something he

yeah why aren't they a dragon because

as you're you're a person

you're an awesome person

that's what you are

Greg is of course

a giraffe

a lot of people Miss conceive about me

I didn't

wait Miss can see

props maybe yeah yeah fish I mean you

can get a face if you want that

I want everyone to be happy with the

animal they are because I didn't write

it in these in that review

what

what is misconceive is that when you're

yeah you mix up

face understands something correctly

okay

I see Miss conceived is basically doing

a misconception

[Music]

okay

I also known as don't take my kindness

for the weakness of course not

you are a very kind person I respect

that but I also respect you as that

that's not the weakness I try to be kind

I hope people don't see that as a

weakness

I cannot say joke around

mostly joking around about you I don't

know why

you're a funny person Benny

that's why I hang around here to chat

problem is that you stream so much that

I don't get time to watch out these

things

universities

foreign

[Music]

yes

I am the element of love

[Music]

I guess there's like

[Music]

a large bow here

[Music]

[Music]

or something

oh

[Music]

and in there

[Music]

ever forgotten anything now

I think I got him I guess there's the

boots but

to be shown like

powerless socks or something

no I think it's fine without that I

don't think people are

I I was without

it's my drawing I decide just

I've had that said to me like

[Music]

well I'm the one that doing these things

so I'll decide yeah I know I know

[Music]

I just I just like to reflect other

things I'm not the one making decisions

here anymore

if it's you making that that pumpkin

will have much a sorry

um you can't make predictions that are

longer than 24 hours

and then I'm pretty sure there's more

than 24 hours until 2024 so seven due to

the restrictions of uh twitch this is um

is impossible too

there

I really wish you could have much longer

predictions both in time of length of

time and

until you have to design an answer but

also that you can make predictions that

are more

subtle that's not correct way they're

more like passive because currently you

can only have one prediction going on at

a time

and uh

[Music]

it would be nice and also it's like

shows up at the top

maybe more like how they do a community

Point scattering things

because that one isn't this

obvious on-screen one

subtle to be silent subtle now it's

subtle

now you're going to say

it isn't pronounced uh

Balman

are you saying the b in battle

is subtle

because it's like

I know it's subtle

I just can't remember pronouncing it

that way

like salmond

[Music]

Belmont better

wait

oh

hell is silence yeah why do you have

another

salmon

yeah seven seven

that's how you spell it

is

this takes the time to continue

statement

Please spell it in that way and it won't

be the correct way

because it's confusing I think

yeah it spells spell salmon without an l

and if people yes people exactly if

people stop saying it is wrong to spend

salmon without the nail if people just

spell it without the nail it's going to

be the great spelling it's only

incorrect because people keep saying

it's incorrect it will be correct if

people can say it's correct that's just

how it fits

because if you learn that quick and you

could go outside and play I'll send you

a funny word playing on English oh no

you mean

please

foreign

[Music]

ensure that does be pronounced fish

[Music]

[Music]

the Swedish word for salmon is Lux

and it is spelled this way

because that's how it's pronounced

that's why I wouldn't be spend it in the

way it's pronounced

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

light

[Music]

that's a good one

does it even fit on screen

[Music]

what

long tricks

annoying that's the word

yeah yeah

foreign

did you go to the store and buy

a fluorescent light

kind of got to be taking a sharp

underwater

no the the the common

the comments and the common words

nowadays is just that this red it's also

spelled how it's pronounced obviously

spelled according to the Swedish

spelling rules but yes

please rare

no silent letters no we had a

combination of letters just one letter

person

it should be Disneyland

it's a language that makes sense

yeah I don't know

[Music]

I'm going to make as many people as

possible since I'm Swedish

[Music]

yeah of course exceptions in Swedish too

but not not nearly as much as in English

[Music]

even simple things like

English decides that the F sounds should

be able to be spelled two ways

that will be the evidence with the

dedicated F letters that makes the F

sound and also with ph because why not

when it's winning we basically said nah

why would you spell f sound with ph that

is silly so we spell all

all words that contains pH those would

spell with f

so it's easy that way

I am here now

I was missing you

[Music]

I am drawing I'm drawing a bunny or

uzagi from

cinnamon

I'm actually trying this

character in the case

indicates every time you need to do some

ice fishing to regains things before

if she's saying the world or floral

light

[Music]

foreign

get something to eat and take a shower

that sounds like important stuff so I

understand

because the circle about the a looks

like a hole cut in eyes oh because the

the circle consists this circle

compromising the letter O obviously does

not look like a heart for fishing

oh

I get you I get you

you're a funny boy

[Music]

I missed the word you're funny Benny boy

that's what I wanted to say mess that

one up

he's not messing up

I said it correctly the first time

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

to do all that at

about the 13 o'clock estimated the end

of stream in U.S Central time would be

too late

I yeah I

don't know when I'm in this dream

I think I scheduled it for six hours

but the drawing streams have been very

in length a lot I don't like five hours

so

don't really have a

consistency there

is to whenever I feel like it

but this is like

I do want to go for like six hours it's

almost been four hours already

and that letting me on

yeah estimated yeah

oh yeah yeah I mean you did say

estimated so bad enough fair enough

you're win this round

but the voice of the way

here we have Benny Benny's a streamer

his dreams streams of games

he's a funny guy

I like watching his streams

[Music]

okay see you soon all right sleeping

 thank you Penny thank you for

showing up it means a lot to me

whatever lines

oh we can tell you what you're supposed

to do

some watching or something

foreign

of some sort

s

so

um

what did he eat

if I may be so

entirely to ask

it's sushi

nice to see you

I need something to hide me

I heard my name I didn't hear it I asked

hey what did you eat

[Music]

and also asking if it was sushi

[Music]

so how it's going for you Rota

nice to see you

Rota

oh yeah that I mentioned that now

Swedish is for red so

[Music]

yeah

take time for a reminder

[Music]

oh

and what did I eat bread

that means bread

pretty bread spread

that's the face a face of a determined

Phantom pun

to good

she's the Sailor princess

[Music]

I mean she yeah

I guess there's a lot of connections

here to Rabbit and stuff

the main character of Sailor Moon who is

Sailor Moon

is her name is usagi in Japanese

Japanese

for somebody

[Music]

when I say Japanese it really felt like

that no that's not the name of the

language it is Japanese oh wait it is

the name of the language it's

anyway her name in Japanese isuzagi

which means rap

and pon pon is a rabbit

so it um

it all comes together

I only know her name in the English term

in the English dub there's two English

dumps in one in English dubs they

decided to go with bunny

because that would be basically the

English equivalent of rabbit as a name

to match the Japanese name

which I think is a clever idea some

people complain about that

but I thought it was clearly

okay I guess it's the FUNimation that I

know I don't know

I know they're stood up so

bunnies is the later down and the first

step was Serena or something like that

which I don't really know the what the

point of that name is

and another fan of the other character

that has same names

Serena

Japanese the Serena or something

yeah so

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

was in Swedish

[Music]

because for what I remember they when I

made the day all the Swedish dubs

of these shows they basically use the

Japanese Snippets

but then later

Swedish tops use the English version of

therapists

which I get to see is easier for Swedish

so for swedes to them but

having the Japanese version

adaptive Swedish is nicer

[Music]

oh there's no Wikipedia article

[Music]

foreign

website called

the beginning

which means the dubbing website

[Music]

where's the

where's the search bar

and here I got Sailor Moon

[Music]

oh she was called Annie apparently

[Music]

that's really that's what the connection

is there either

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

connection with the name to anything

special I went

[Music]

rainbow that's when that's when she uses

her power

[Music]

yeah as I said I wanted to do the

community drawing but this is obviously

not one of I mean I could transform this

season to give me a try now I wanted to

have like

[Music]

characters

[Music]

having

that would be something

I haven't watched Sailor Moon since

elementary school I really don't

remember much of it yeah I haven't

watched anything ages

I couldn't even remember the name of the

character

so

but at least I know the Japanese name

[Music]

I remember watching Dragon Ball Z

that's a show I haven't watched it on

at all

not a single episodes

not the single scene I mean

that's not true

what grade was designed Saga then fifth

grade was

your art is looking good thank you

foreign

[Music]

I have I mean really depends on what I'm

trying to draw I try to draw this one

it's I wouldn't say it's good though

[Music]

I'm still getting used to drawing I'm

still very near to drawing

so

hopefully I can do some

maybe some emotes for people if they

want

okay once that other art and Amy

okay

who's this character do you recognize

this character he's obviously not a meme

I mean I'm not sure he's obviously maybe

but it's nothing that's it

that's

wait where did my reference out go

huh this is references up here

next character

concept art of the character

[Music]

yeah

that was one I tried to make into an

emote it didn't go as well as I hoped

snap it doesn't look funky it's it's a

it's from a game

on the PlayStation 2 known as star cloud

[Music]

a few people know about it maybe I

should play it on stream

[Music]

and that character is

based on a cat apparently

and her name is Xiao

I wonder

if you say reference

because it is the Chinese word for

flute

oh dark Chronicle

no dark clouds

I mean it was a there was a sequel

called Dark

Nicole

I can spell Chronicle apparently uh it's

yeah it's Tron nickel

sorry

because why would the spelling make

sense

[Music]

yeah dark Chronicle was the sequel that

was what it was called internationally

but in North America it was actually

known as dark clouds too

[Music]

but yeah I should play dark clouds

Chronicles on the Stream

I want to watch my brother play The

Secret of thinking and and now he he

watched me play it

it doesn't that sound exciting he has

played that yes that sounds like a plan

there are bunnies in it too

play the first game

play the second game and then there's no

more games

Dark Cloud the evil version of

clouds not of dark

and there are bunny cases bunny boys

bunny boys

yeah he doesn't like bunny boys

I have bunny boys wearing dresses

[Music]

that's right that's that's dead yeah

I'll I'll do more I draw like a water

bunny

it is

[Music]

bunny streaming

I'll draw him in this in this artwork as

a cinnamon character as well

he's not here easy who is described as

looking kind of like a duck

no they're going for dancing

[Music]

which doesn't make sense unless this are

actually dark elements in it

and it's like kind of like a dog no he

is attack

duck

no

[Music]

[Music]

well I'll get there when I get there

[Music]

I did watch Penny play some of it

that's how I got the idea of playing it

that's why I made the emote in the first

place because the idea was that I would

make the emails for his channel because

he has burning ones according to me

and making their

emotes based on that character

[Music]

is the idea

[Music]

I like playing as the heroine Monica

because she uses swords swords are

awesome

are the main character in the first team

uses a sword

[Music]

but I do like that thing to have

a very variety of weapons

there are other elements that doesn't

look to be too fun

[Music]

with the elements that you like find

I will definitely be playing it

at some point

currently I'm basically doing the crash

Inspire games

on the two game gaming days

and then I do art

so

so I guess I'll when I

finish

I mean I could I could I didn't want to

finish crash or spider I could could

play Dark Cloud

Maybe

but the other character Max is a little

stronger because he's secondary weapon

has a better attack speed marker second

than your weapon

ishika spells which takes way too long

to cast for the damage the deal

yeah it's

a problem when it damage per second

isn't equal between the characters

making one of the characters obviously

better

[Music]

that's that's fun

that's what makes a

Cinder better than spiral in the legend

of spire

because

in this

one of cinder's elements is opponents

as far as I know but spider has friends

in there

[Music]

but Cinders have stunning is sticking so

a self-seeking homing

so it doesn't so you don't really need

to aim it plus it can hit multiple

enemies unexpired

which makes cinder's attack better

Max outs is there

the right pod which is basically a giant

steampunk robot Monica gets to transform

into various monasteries alaf which are

much much weaker than her normal form

that same stupid

[Music]

yeah sometimes they make weird decisions

oh

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

the monster thing is used for one Quest

where she needs to describe as well and

torch to another monster to get an item

or something and that's it

there's also sing in some games but you

get an ability that they only need each

month

our divine stability is useless

or almost useless

well

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

Ty

[Music]

try and catch humans not as good

thank you

and nice nice

message

but the right part that sings the

definition of op has its own HP bar so

max doesn't lose Health by using it and

it hits like a tank

and if it runs out of HP marches tops

out and can keep fighting since he

doesn't train his safety the master is

mentioned yeah they stole his bike that

has health so if she dies he must work

she's still dead

well yeah

okay but taking design

hey hey Monica hey

is that a song I should do on karaoke

I know Swedish accurate for that reason

and Mac's main weapon wrenches have more

cheer build than Market sword added like

they hold here built this thing but

I just have to deal with it

I don't think it adds anything to the

game

for what I've seen

oh

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

and

I'm doing my best

nice of you to show up does make me

happy to see

I see people who I've been watching show

up

hey I was looking for something to watch

African models models

how are you doing let's keep so fine

thank you

um

well I guess he goes

it's uh it's okay I guess

the things I'm proving

for me which is great

let's say

that how much would

anyway

that doesn't have the ability is

handling which is doing a broken weapon

or armor is only as half as effective as

it is well by full durability it's easy

to manage yet that it also depends on

how fast it drains it gerbilt as well

and also because in dark

dark clouds that is different at least

the first game as far as I'm being told

if the weapon runs after durability it

disappears

and all everything you have upgraded on

it is gone

so that's

terrible

which is

and in the early game it's difficult to

repair them yes at least in the first

game they did one damage

but that's only your starting weapon

that comes there they are either

durability but it can't disappear

so you still have it and then you give

one damage

and that's kind of what happened to you

Benny when I was playing

he didn't get a second weapon and he

didn't get any repair because you need a

special repair

pound Earth to repair it

so you are stuck with a weapon

that

not so he could he it was out of

durability and when it's done and not

only does just do one damage it also

because apparently the weapon gains

experience not the character but if the

durability as it is out it can't get

again gain an idea experiencing it

and the whole game is changed

and if that happens that one yeah

and then there

once you clear the first dungeon and can

we see the sharpest format when I

suppose if you can buy repair about it

yeah but yeah

but if

but you need to get to that point first

and

it is

we'll see how it goes when I play it

hopefully the game doesn't

is it annoying

as soon as you get to that part it's

it's nice

[Music]

[Music]

until then he has to have to find a

prayer Palace in chest and rely on that

kindly mitigate the fixing weapons

[Music]

and when he never got a single repair

powder as far as I know until he got the

shop so

it was a very large slow and tedious

startup game

so

is that great

I don't know

I'm still learning

how to draw nicely

[Music]

common problem in games especially are

pretty jeans

I'm usually a fan of RPGs

so dark cloud isn't

it's really my type of game but I'll

give it a try and TV

or Xiao

because she's cute

yeah perfect types of games but it's

more yeah

a single shorter levels

like crash inspire

that's why I'm not as big of a fan of

a hairstyle

but it's a spider came so I would play

it and also the legend spider

and those are not really small

individual levels

I really like it when it really makes

this individual levels

the beginning yeah

and it's it feels weird that because it

really gives the game a bad first

impression

so it seems like something they want to

avoid

but yet it is still in there for some

reason

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I need a bathroom break

[Music]

so I will be back

I haven't even seen this project

what should I say with this

um

thank you

and let's create a phone lift drawings

and this will be

sane or Pom-Pom

now aren't we

go on my very quick bathroom break in

with me back soon working for his family

give me um

five minutes or so

another falcon or something

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

the remedy cheese

okay rabbits

eat cheese

[Music]

missionary feed your rabbit daily bread

that then you reply that diary products

they are not built to consume what

judges lactose which one in their

products because of these emails

Paramount in the diet to make them

rather almond

we probably Stitch as bunny diarrhea

unlike other diarrheas

you can other gastrointestinal

complications yes don't feed yeah right

I generally I

just remember that that was the case

when I started searching

needs more things to spend these

characters or maybe some likes through

some rabbit treats

yeah I mean yeah

I'm going to add more and when I get a

and more activities

[Music]

and like

[Music]

and my mom said

that's yeah I'm going to use the

software that

will have a overlay function

[Music]

which I can then overlay the screen with

[Music]

which we'll be able to do a bunch of

stuff

but I must wait for them to release that

first and with that version I can make

an overlay that is

herself

and then sue these do everything I need

to do

hopefully

it works as I want it to work

[Music]

because I want it because okay

so currently I'm using OBS and then I

have a

[Music]

yes

I can use an HTML that will lay

show Pom-Pom

um

and then I can run code in that that

works

[Music]

but OBS for some strange reason try not

to trigger Things based on readings it

really should be able to

[Music]

better than that other software I

mentioned

is able to trigger based on routines

but exactly what I need

and when I asked them how I would beat

that software trigger function in the

HTML file a file I have loaded in OBS

they said that that's not a thing that

is possible to do however they will

release the what they call the overlay

and version 3 and that should be my

solution and whenever they've done

fixing it

so hopefully

[Music]

if I got there what did I meant

correctly that means that they're new

overlay will be able to support

HTML files which you then can run

functioning when a redeem is done

if this this works that would be perfect

and otherwise if it's if they don't

allow this but I have some kind of their

own programming

I might be able to get through that but

it would be annoying

worst case is that they have their own

[Music]

overlay system and you have to use it

then it's very restrictive and doesn't

allow me to do whatever I want

such as oh you when I redeem is made you

can start displaying a picture you can

choose wherever you want the picture to

be and

and you can set it to timeout after

certain amount of assignments that's

nothing exciting what I need

that's an option I have now but

and that's that's not what I need

[Music]

[Music]

when we did I can I can have more

readings

[Music]

but another redeem I can add is evil

pumpkin which I've created as a pattern

I just need to figure out how I should

like

play as this character because that

would be role playing basically

an evil pumpkin will have a different

personality

[Music]

and everything is set up correctly I can

I can at any point

and show Evil Pumpkin

I I want

but it's everything set up

[Music]

[Music]

any clothes on at the moment is separate

names

and the uh

the Evil Pumpkin the good and evil fun

fun they are just base layers below

there's a pump on layer and then there's

a close on top of it there's a separate

picture

yeah I think I got that

foreign

[Music]

put it on the Queue and

let the queue is empty it will display

it will switch out which outfit is used

and then

[Music]

otherwise it will be in queue ready to

be shown when the queue when it's the

next item in the q's turn

then I'll add more things like if you

really want to serve things at one point

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

am I missing anything

[Music]

the Taft is very simplified but how

should I do it like from the front

this looks kind of weird

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

I mean

there's still too long

English

again

they should be white not not long

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

a bit

[Music]

okay

yeah I guess the only thing that that's

missing in the shoes but I think I don't

want to included

I intentionally left them out

[Music]

I think that's my name

[Music]

[Music]

no shoes forever's done issues exactly

she got really soft paws

[Music]

if you like these lines are sticky

if they are

playing ceiling

[Music]

an Instagram brush but no problem

because you can go in and change

afterwards which brush I actually used

or in this case the only difference

between the brushes is the thickness if

I change the thickness

and that's a neat thing I like with

doing vegetables are using the using the

vector layer of the

instead of raster layer

[Music]

yeah I think I think I'm ready all right

I mean it's not perfect but

I don't like this hand but I really

don't know what

[Music]

I suck at hands

Sailor Moon pass it stand yet okay thank

you Rota yes I'm happy with most of this

just this hand I am really disappointed

with

but I don't know what else to do

[Music]

I just don't look at the hand okay

[Music]

it means

[Music]

is the whole pointing towards

the viewer thing that's really

[Music]

makes it hard for me

you should connect it like that

move that slightly by I don't know

maybe it should be

on this side

I don't know

I didn't know

well yeah I'm gonna do it looks weird

doesn't matter it's just it's it's a

bunch of sausages it doesn't look like a

hand

just I can't figure out what the pose is

it's just

[Music]

it's a bunch of sausages

[Music]

isn't that what fingers are

[Music]

yeah let's color this

[Music]

I treat an awesome back with the outfit

thank you

is that a shark and a kangaroo combined

is that looks like

what is a sausages but a chief filled

with meat therefore what is a finger but

a few filming me exactly I mean I think

it probably has like bones

[Music]

a bone sausage that means people do like

like like like

chicken wings I think you call them

where you have which I would assume is

the wings of a chicken but that's

probably not always the case

where you have

I don't know if it's chicken wings

that's probably not the term I'm looking

for would have a piece of meat with a

bone in it

and people and you eat bone after of the

eat the meat of the bone they eat the

bone of the meat therefore you could

have a sausage with a bone in it

and then you eat the meat of the boat it

would be like

sashes on a stick

I think that's the thing

and what is a body but a tea will filled

with meat behold we have sausages

yeah I combined shark and Kangaroo

together but I usually do it myself as a

little raccoon

I do like that

and what's your profile picture

[Music]

is that is that a it's not a shark Arrow

or is that a

not to tell

let's see so small

that wasn't there

I'll go to your

Beach

it's kind of is really nicely stylized

I do like that

[Music]

I like the name

[Music]

so

let's do some fun coloring

okay depend upon as part of one punch

okay wait let's see

but now I should have area scaling

how much does this gain

that's a good amount of scaling

it's a dangerous Acosta

so maybe I should have less staining

yeah that's a better screening

leave behind the black lines

basically what the tool is doing

[Music]

so for the outfit

and in a very pretty color

[Music]

I mean

[Music]

okay there you go now I see what hasn't

been colored yet

so this would be the

clubs that are white

and then the shirt which is white

[Music]

don't mind this jumbled mess off

[Music]

oh

[Music]

it's just that I don't know what to add

how to do that part

but settling this would be a slightly a

slight difference between

what is

air pumpkins burn and what is the outfit

[Music]

I would do it and because they have

different colored skirts

the difference in our moon characters

so

they have this now they have actually

have different colored bows and stuff

too

but I can't really make

yeah okay and this part matches the

color of the skirt

all right

on some characters this much is the

color of the skeleton

except for for me being lazy I'll do

that

and then

well

I didn't want that to happen ah yeah

right I haven't

these are separate

okay

no problem

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

and I also need

[Music]

all right I already done that part

so I just need

a little bit bite

okay

so the only Parts left are the bows

and the

tiara

enter that

let me just

copy an existing artwork

and Landing this one

oh so small

so small

[Music]

and compressed as so much

such a good person

I like the picture but

is it available in high quality American

[Music]

credit isn't so horribly compressed

okay here we go

[Music]

nope

Owen

[Music]

okay I found another one

[Music]

[Music]

okay now

[Music]

let's see

if this one is better

laughs

I start coloring it

[Music]

and I guess I'll just take this color as

well

foreign

[Music]

and remove the references

and then

my beautiful drawing let me sensing I

guess there's a tail but

shift the table would be visible visible

here

[Music]

because 10 point pops out like that it

would be kind of behind

so it's fine

what is it it's a clear difference

between my and what I can draw and what

like coefficient someone else to do

well let's try to do a background then

[Music]

and I know how I want this background

[Music]

foreign

first off

and let's take this background

[Music]

okay

then or something

[Music]

and then

[Music]

oh

I think it's better to draw this

real party

right

[Music]

now

something like that that's good man

[Music]

can we imagine it's giant Moon

[Music]

[Music]

all right let me try

let me see how that goes

I guess I can't watch

then I might want to cut out one more

like that

is this a kind of uh

the color the colors together is

okay

foreign

combined with one

any of the Muslim Flags

so always missing stuff

so maybe I shouldn't do this combination

[Music]

because I haven't had it it starts

[Music]

and in there maybe I should try to do a

background to get some time and later

[Music]

Channel

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

maybe she's smiling

thinking inspiration from the

my artworks

but they technically have fewer

these are meant to be Stars

to 2 000 pixels I should probably

yeah that's good

[Music]

my lines are so popular there is

they aren't so clean

oh drawing is complete I am happy

it's now it's turned out I might post it

on this survey

not supposed it's on the beyond the art

that will post it on the server

that I posted on survey

[Music]

oh yeah I should post it on Twitch too I

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

but that's more uh

encouragement something

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

that was five hours of streaming today

I think

I think that's a good amount I still

want to do the community drawing so I

must see because the idea I still I've

signed up with ideas of how to do it

because I want to draw people's personas

and stuff

and so one idea I had was I was like

yeah

water bunny which is another streamer

holding pon pon or something

which I wrote protecting pumpkins from

the evil

evil creatures who will take over ponpon

retreat

I shall hydrate

thank you for the hydrate

well and then

[Music]

and I'm tired

I got 123 followers today no not today

Fallout and he do follow me if you want

I updated schedule as you can see

so that's Thursday Friday is correct and

it also says Thursday Friday for

Australia because now it's before

know what to do for our timer for ideas

I said

pictures to draw the picture I want to

try otherwise I'll just do something

else someone to change

now you're ingested wait so yeah

our degrades which will now control what

what are you talking about

it is tardy grades were in the water

which water

the water drank is oh

oh that's what if you're wrong

anyway

let's go

and visit

a bunny streamer

hasn't been seen I guess she's a human

streamer because she has a camp

[Music]

and then I said for subscribers just do

the cheating

foreign

[Music]

400 points one two I've seen three being

very common

as I usually do three but

want spiders then say hello and run away
