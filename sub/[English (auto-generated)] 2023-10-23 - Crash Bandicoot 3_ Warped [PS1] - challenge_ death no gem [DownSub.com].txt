I'm

[Music]

ly Computer Entertainment Europe

presents who do we have

here Studio good job friend you

are have another friend your streak was

broken

but he starting a stage of

one something tells me that's not a

[Music]

streak we got raed

orian for girl show up early today jelly

fish

right stucking water bunny again is he

water bunny here I haven't seen what yet

red

againto VI

mon what streak is on a two day first

streak no it's one

day it was on a 3day streak before but

then you broke

it so you had to restart anyway I

started prediction

for someone try to redeem an outfit

change yeah I me FR first yeah

exactly yes s suck look at

that I did not press any button it did

that all on on its

own and because the was first that means

that the sport

bar the sport bar will appear on its own

in 15

minutes

magic actually B to set it up

[Music]

finally all right almost did everything

here anyway I got two levels left and

then I'm going to face against cortex so

I set up the uh prediction for

that well now we'll see if the Q Works

yep pay attention

at 146 when it say in the

corner that's when you just

switch you manage to set up that redeem

to show it full from the model no I

still have no idea how to do

that

automation but I do want to show more of

the model when I go over

to crash Coco remember it is not only Dr

CeX that we battle beware of ukah Uka my

children he is a for more dangerous

enemy than anyone can imagine oh well

are you trying to tell me that my

prediction is incorrect because it's

just cortex and I did not mention

ukoke anyway two levels

left L

yes well I got the

box

[Music]

[Music]

go found is trying to hide from

me yeah not that great at this

level but I'm doing my

best

[Music]

when where am I I'm very disoriented

that

[Music]

[Music]

no

shoot it shoot the

balloon

okay now I have to start over

[Music]

everything

that's what they saying come on I should

shut that

[Music]

thing I can't R all my

RS well you can if you

see I

mean it's it's easy you just have to try

it you have to try

[Music]

[Music]

this there's a language that that rolls

their

[Music]

bees you see instead of just B you would

say

b or something like that of course I'm

no expert at rolling these but don't

like

that and I only know one word from that

language which is p which

means

jaw

[Music]

[Music]

so

anyway how long is it I don't

know final

box oh damag me too

much I wanted to finish level without

any

[Music]

damage yeah finally they take

away I can do so for a short time but I

can't sustain at the practice in

OFA

I guess yes practice

[Music]

more it's like a

cat and my bunny

ping but I heard the longer you roll the

r the more you emphasize the word

I guess

so I

can't all right this is the Night level

there are no knights in

this they is this during the

night what happened

there

had to get to the middle part middle one

come

on TNT yeah TNT got me and

then

crash eyes lost their body yeah your

crash is his

eyes I mean we are just our brains byot

in their body

so run crash

Run and Jump

too no that means I can't I need to

start over from the start guess that's

the

RS oh neon atomic Galaxy

welcome wait why are you bonking

me died from pet a

snake a brain pting a bone me that's

protected by Meat armor doesn't seem

like the best

armor it's very fleshy

armor when the rules are

basically

I cannot pick up anything on my no gems

no crystals after

dying for some reason he just doesn't

jump skin is actually on Armor I mean

makes

sense

it's our PE protecting the meaty

inside yeah it's ter armor it's better

than nothing

but starting to lose

lives I'm losing to start

lives

it's not really terrible armor it's just

not not

honest here we go I guess I do that

then

oops I didn't even touch the spike this

level is going to end

me

come is up bug Light one cycle you mean

complete without dying yeah that's kind

of the kind that kind of the challenge

I'm

doing I also made it so you can redeem

the same outfit multiple times without

having a timer I basically remove the

timer because it's so it's queuing up

everything anyway so but we see if it

works

then you can like redeem the outfit four

times if you want it to be on for for an

hour I didn't want to the for the like

the being

like showing the queue on screen or

something crash popped

yeah

but to the Q system that is used in mix

mix it up which I'm using at the moment

is very very pretty

sick would be so nice if they

[Music]

could

that but

H okay this is going

go

he's getting

closed it's getting close to the object

switching to the

spare I feel like you should probably

limit the you sign so that you don't get

accidental of having outfit stay

over by hours I mean if someone like

spends it cost like

200 yeah Mommy TR me who are

you socks you

like hung your mommy

yes okay I can't really set a limit to

the Q size because that's not as see in

twitch well at any point you should

switch out Che while I'm

playing and a moment now there you go

now it's switched out it

beautiful it it is

working

yay I think I have all gems but yeah but

I don't think I'm going for that for

now

no the prediction time is still going I

can't spend time on this P cuz I

completed level I

can't immediate pain

here

the bunny is

disappointed also I don't see

um was I miss the Rab in the

PED there was a Rab in the PED I just

didn't pay

attention

message

I'm being judged by little

bunny and I'm a big

bunny re SI

welcome welcome

Raiders

oh

how what what have you been up to

what why did you choose to come

here why did you come here what how did

how did it go on your

stream how are you

doing welcome

readers

with the

wiggle very weakly and hello ion

agenda is Ion on your

agenda playing some crash three

here and my challenge is

to well complete this without

dying

otherwise I have to restart level not

the whole game that would be

[Music]

crazy I'm not I'm not that

[Music]

crazy thank you for

following or

something do let me know went pretty

well thank you you played some spooky

games

oh yeah Darkwood is well did you play

multiple

games I'm I'm really bad at knowing

games

so

whoop I no crash I no Spire that's my

knowledge Smokey Dragoness

29 thank you for

fing

Smokey is that PO

fire I'm trans fale oh me

too also Fatal Frame I think I

definitely heard about H Darkwood and

FAL frame but I don't know anything

about

here we go pretty

easy I thought you were going up there

okay I think the red section is the

easiest so no this I can pick this up

this

is wa I did

it but welcome

welcome I hope you have a good time

[Music]

okay now to complete the level properly

and I still have the rule that if I die

I'm not even allowed to pick up the

crystal currently also testing out

because this is first

stream I have set up the automatic

outfit which

thing

and it seems to work

[Music]

fine I can make the outfits even cheaper

and make them even shorter in time

if I should probably do that when it

comes to

uh uh the 3D model when I'm switching to

that and making a lot of

outfits oh still doing that still doing

that I think the game is a bit Bugg

there I have PS1 and PS2 for retro games

I have PS3 for which has the PS like the

first gen PS3 with the PS2 which I used

to play PS2 games I'm currently if it's

not obvious from the visuals I don't

know I am actually running an emulator

but that's only for the high quality the

game I could just this want run it on

the uh

PS3 it just would look as

nice so

that's this for the convenience and

nicer

Graphics but since I do have a PS3 and

actually a PS1

too that can play this game and I do

have the game itself as well

perfectly

fine and now have to do the mistake

again there we

go five minutes will be long enough I

think

yeah oh come

on yeah I was thinking about that make

it cheaper and for five

minutes the current is only two outfits

that's the

dress

so I don't think it's necessary

to change that

now how did you get hit he was above the

Mommy I think I think what how this game

works because in Crash which I'm not a

fan about

of is that you take damage from enemies

by just touching them which is the case

in like Mario 2

and I'm not a fan of that because uh

that's not the case in Sp for

example in Spire you can go up and touch

the enemies you only take damage from

them when they

attack which means that I think that

even if you touch the head of these

mommy you still take the diamond chance

if you touch the spike I could be wrong

though I'm not planning on this

it oh the prediction timer is still

going H take part in the prediction if

you want only if you want no Force

forcing at

one how many times do you think I'll die

when I fighting off against

[Music]

cortex my explosion I didn't see

anything

oh there's some random L spikes because

of the

amation it's

[Music]

um goodbye but not having to deal with

now starting up the PS3 and making sure

because the capture card I have or

actually the

find cables I have are a bit broken so

the there are some issues trying to

capture I should buy new

C I should have done is a bit different

I think

yeah

I get

everything think

so hope that was ever

seen see me some time yeah it should be

switch back somewhere 31 minutes and

some seconds

oops still knowless I can beat this

[Music]

up and now to bring it to the

go the my go and also I

also oh my I can't speak today I also

have the the room that I'm not allowed

to use the Bazooka otherwise I would

argue it it becomes a bit too

easy no that's I can pick up that

wo I'm give a funny game but never get

at it I play this game too

much but now it's time to face up

CeX okay I just want to

Cate

anyway let's sa

first hope everyone has put in the

predictions it's only 1 minute

left got two three four five

people that's taking part of

it same

often

well

then let's see if it

works there we

go no don't die

[Music]

[Laughter]

stream I'm sorry this is the part where

I'm supposed to be angry full of Rage

incensed beyond belief once again you

have outsmarted and outs spun my best

henchmen I should be rather upset

shouldn't I and in fact we're Furious

but it seems you have overlooked one

small detail you little orange delivery

boy now that you have gathered all the

crystals all we have to do is take them

from you and good luck with

that

Crash Bandicoot for the last time give

the crystals to

me

way there we go let's see they closes

the they close the gate you can't fall

down for some reason they don't do that

in

dream and then you

automatically defeated again this is not

fair yes maybe I should retire to a nice

big beach with a nice big drink woman

with nice big bags of eyes from my head

it's not over Bandicoot there are still

characters I mean that's

fair I wasn't going to read the chat I

guess I don't know if I need I guess I

need it between the

places

oh

I I don't

know well there's a new prediction going

anyway

so and because the it is future frency

in that

because I have to

um I know land behind

it

get through the whole level including

extra area in the

level to get

the come

on oh right this that time it counts

that but the other one did not count

like this one won't count yeah

apparently that one did

weird but the other one

didn't and I go thank

you yeah future fry the prediction is

for that it's only the fail attempt at

getting

the the

thing

so this does not count of course because

I'm not doing for about sing at the

[Laughter]

Lon not doing great at the

moment

[Music]

that's a

[Music]

playing here we

[Applause]

go nothing in t

best

time oh no night track need to feel the

brightness settings I was going in a

music this very cute music for some

reason

Che B St

oh I'm

getting

okay and there's this

section this

section waa wo wo way too much to left

there

I

know oh come

on blocking me from all those

boxes

okay let's see

[Music]

now all right there we

[Music]

go a very C Level for some reason it

kind of go worse this time around

[Music]

last who I skipped over the Gap last

time I at least

got second POS place and I got the worst

time as

well oh

my a UFO six of them

even come on

now I should at least get something

like first

place

gold

certainly not every box not

yet I will I will take care of that

anything they do play full volume when

they appear in the

distance

no did that

again I need to remember to keep the

right

there oh

nice

dangerous police

cars there we go it's nice I have one a

bit up ahead because they are getting

off their own light giving

me more of a vision up

ahead oh excuse me come on and how did I

not get that box maybe I did but didn't

feel like

it an actual better time this

time but still why am I doing so

terribly on this

track really really terrible I'm not

even getting the slowest

time I'm feel so

bad and what makes it funny is that this

isn't even like the challenge isn't even

affecting this

level cuz you can't die on this level

anyway doesn't change anything

I'm just

B the predication should have been for

this level but I do hope

the future

freny level am I trouble remembering is

going to be an interesting

level

okay someone

after this I should keep to the right

here so I can go all there there we go

that's what I

wanted get out of the

way

no why didn't keep those boosts for a

long

time even hard to keep the Boost in this

level because the poor wow the poor

visibility oh that was

close

okay let me

[Music]

pause

go and then the final

St yay first

place y good time now it's way

fine

[Music]

and then if you

do time to check

points

yeah well now the Box

this shouldn't be too

hard

this only 24 of

them it's part visibility

but I do should probably keep up with

the that UFO so I can see

like like this more more uper

hand

surprises taking it slow and

steady driving

m

for an even better

time I hope I get gold

anyway what we here we

go

done no up that up

there

see thank you for following punch

okay let me see what happens if I

[Music]

wait that

happens oh could I failing more I can

have pain that

[Music]

more

ah

okay that is a bit quick

game

just be quicker go go

go I'm just p p the Bon B not go g GRE

go go go GRE

okay H there we

go no

no I should have taken

the the

mosque

oh no stupid light Spike ruined

everything

there

didn't grab onto the thing jumped up on

the

box Miss T

box I don't like the invisibility it

gets after you attack it

once nope I didn't think I got it P is

disappointed by what I did I'm

disappointed for what I did I mean sure

the lag didn't help

but oh bad

timing okay I should get that

invisibility this time can I stop

Landing between this

stuff there we

go I didn't box is break he stands there

well my life is over now oh I could have

done that

way I don't know what the PE is at the

moment but I hope it's working

properly no

here we

go kiding much

[Music]

B come on why does it lag spike

thing okay give me Co now

[Music]

please triple disappointment on that

one all right I need qu much better

time I need quite the Improvement

okay let's see what I can

do why didn't I die from

that and I did intentionally die to

change the timing

cuz when you start the level and when

you die and respawn the timing of things

are

different

go m in the

way

come on can enough to

fire maybe it's that I shouldn't wait

for the

fire yeah there I struggled that

[Music]

much

oh no oh come on Mr the

[Music]

m and it didn't get on to

it what's with this

game

nice

that was good

Quicky

[Music]

oh now don't get the ability doesn't

matter I

why does it move so much forward this

isn't the

Remake where when you press slightly

slightly forward and he jumps over the

whole

box and I've seen other people have that

thing happen to them as well so it's is

an issue with the

Remake what why is restart not an

option

here we

go I cons if I can consistently do that

that would be really

good

W no that wasn't k

I'm so close to the enemy that it pushed

me

[Music]

back anyway I guess it

works no don't get stuck on S

lag

spikes there we

go how about

that the whole game freezes up I don't

know

why question so close to the end of

L

[Music]

here we

go should we pretty happy with that gu

that's gold and I think yeah there's

that and then there's that okay there's

just this one

left and then I will go for the future

freny

we

nice

here and also

[Music]

as part of the challenge I'm not allowed

to use the Bazooka either which US is a

more a challenge of uh G tomorrow where

you have those platform to

reach which I will which I have

completed to

100% if I may

prank

but I think you have the nro explosion

SC at the end of the level oh as I

picked up checkpoint I

died

well one

fade so whoever voted for zero fails

have

[Music]

[Music]

failed and I must have taking everything

so carefully

too

oh so many disappointed FAL but you

voted for the three or the third

whatever the third option is so you

don't mind me failing

once you want me to fail a few times

right

[Music]

oh

nice wait never mind the rabit of

disappoint I forgot to put this option

three yeah silly

you I mean the the pon pons are still

disappointed

but I love gray coming with the star

[Music]

see that's another

fail well

uh as I said red should put leash on the

feral pony pony pony pon

pon that's the one that really deserves

leash so that means the rabbits that

this disappointed at me for forgetting

yeah and there are very many of them

being disappointed at

me talking all taking all the bounc is

on

work L to car of twitch unfortunately

oh maybe to make room for more other

animated

emotes I would

guess but people are free

to remove Mo Emos if they choose to of

course I do need a bouncy feral pon pon

who is who is bouncing in

a reluctantly

bouncing I'm going to jump on

[Music]

this

this you really want to make me bounce

no when here goes my CR money

yeah I mean if you put it towards me you

know it will be towards

goodies

[Music]

[Laughter]

there we

go going of you too so I can concentrate

[Music]

here

nice C it's important to note that the

gem up here is not the Box

gem

the prediction is specifically the Box

gem but I need to do that section to

even get the box

gem pon pon bounces soon

maybe and then I have to

backtrack and I can't use the

[Music]

Bazooka oh I moved so quickly

forward well three f that's not three

three fails I should just quit the level

first before I started

taking one pwn bombs from behind

what you mean like

U feral pon pon

um wiggling her but where's the you

in yeah like

[Music]

that this thing

tight

wait a

minute why didn't the

Box why did it survive that makes no

[Music]

sense bar p p but Wile exactly we just

need to see those ears bounce your

ears see how the ears bounce when she

[Music]

does I don't think the ear would bounce

much it would be like heavy and hanging

down

mostly well I guess I could sketch up

some uh I put away the I put away the

drawing tablet for now until after I

move I could still like plan out like

how the animation would be

like I get everything on

see

nice there we

go how

they

[Music]

okay sketch sketch rabit not no no not

sketch

rabbit an

idea maybe I should this

[Music]

one there we go get get going with you

that's my

expression that

this yes sketch getet

[Music]

that

anyway the game is clearly cheating see

like on the edge of that one and that

was perfectly fine the game is clearly

cheating

anyway um a sketched version of Pon pom

for my 3D Pon pom which you can enable

or something hot sketch rabbit yeah like

yeah Sketch version of ponet

[Music]

basically do I even have to backtrack

anything here I don't

[Music]

hyper I feel like sometimes and I jump

and spin I get full control but

sometimes I lose all

control wonder if I can jump over that

maybe I should try

that may not one that is like up

here maybe more like that now it seems

like they prevent you from doing

that this is soft all enev after you get

double

jump but you can do

that doesn't really help me much I'm

getting bad timing with

[Music]

[Music]

this and I only need gold I don't need P

uses crystals P us

sugar yes wait Sonic is

[Music]

crystals is are Sonic you strings

or

emeralds

no

come on I'm

[Music]

waiting yeah I'm was so confused that

it's telling that nothing is

happening

like driving home from work and hitting

everything single red light on the way

yep that's what this

is yeah the Super

Sonic he uses emeralds not crystals

what's the difference I don't know oh

the clock is

gone

[Applause]

Emerald only

clean okay what color is a

[Music]

crystal

I don't know they call them

emeralds it got a loose Strand ofit St

crash enemy uh I understand

[Music]

their Chaos Emeralds they not meant to

make sense Ah that's clever

CH is a blank

for okay fair

enough it's nice jump crash nice jump I

just I just love it the moment he just

jump over that enemy

and then didn't

die of course that's not the time we

live we live

in come on Crash you can do it you can

step on shown it before

what this LEL is confusing me so much

it's

moment almost feels like his side moment

is uh probably I'm probably Imaging

things

but many colors because blank p

chees yeah I like to step on

them but do you want to be stepped on

too or

[Music]

something it still feels like I'm behind

it I'm still Dying by

it

[Music]

know so

when trash jumps when he lied love

that there we go that's what I

wanted but of course I'm missing the 3

second box so what's

the no I'm going to get bed have

fun I'll try Dr this level is really

gting me some trouble at the

moment how do I feel like you're over

optimizing this hey I'm never over

optimizing anything

[Music]

here I'm going to dra a different

[Music]

timeing so much for

that never get on the edge

thing

nice

[Music]

not

same not over same time probably

executing Neal speedrun

this

but but I need to get I need to go fast

this is Crash the

Hedgehog I'm still confused about

that I am confused I am always

confused there we go was this

[Music]

[Music]

for

final level of this place zo way

there now get St watch

out

exactly when you touch the head of it

you still po like a

balloon twim ra no

wait no jump too

far get out of the

way

but it

[Music]

is oh this

right some reason this feel is easier

than in the

remake um yeah speaking of

that immediately

dies no why

didn't J crash why didn't you just do a

normal gem

play

why didn't you jump

there so many

questions it would be easier if CR just

jumped there we

go

keep slipping off

platforms would be if he wasn't so

slippy as

well another Fain

jump there we go

finally Sil crash don't jump

not

excuse

me

no oh come

[Music]

on

[Music]

nice

nice definely seeing a lot of

time

strong

explosions didn't expect them to reach

that

far was a time saving

boxes Haven seen those in a while

go okay can I can of need

T that a bit too far to

go cash can't swim in on water level

most CR can wasting poet this because he

can't

read as soon as he

gets he Conant he can't keep hold his

breath as soon as he requires to hold

his breath he

dies he just doesn't understand holding

his

breath how about that same

okay this is going to hard now cuz the

timing is

over looked like it was working but it

didn't

jump which I mean is currently my

struggle he just doesn't

jump crash can swim with swimsuit on

yeah oh the queue is empty for once

going see the pump has a switch no she

doesn't she actually has a dress on for

once I assume the key

[Music]

work okay go go okay okay okay okay this

activate now

she's and

see loading up with

the SP r one there we go that's what I

need to

do

keeps still keeps

running that's one of the reason why I

don't like playing Mario games

byway play Mario games but I'm not

really looking forward with CU Mario

controls like a vehicle or something

kind of annoys me but never never

because I play through

time uh

[Music]

oh that was

close

weird is that just

[Music]

enemy without taking

[Music]

damage everything's against

[Music]

on I have don't have time to waste in

[Music]

this

[Music]

exra knif doing the plank

[Music]

turn

there we

go probably to

[Music]

go apparently this I thought that was

[Music]

terrible first try and never

seen

[Music]

one that means I only got one level

left and this one shouldn't be too hard

hopefully oh it's been basically 3 hours

that's

great this kind of when I started this

stream

and this is where I'm ending the

stream when I do have to fight CeX

so in one final

showdown

oh I was hoping I could get through

[Music]

there poof

con

hurry through it the door before it

closes

nice W gold

yes dark

level

here we go that should be all

relics which means I have to face off

against

CTIC

[Music]

CICS whoa whoa whoa ready again yes he

said that he would use the power of the

crystal STS and face off against crun

again yes it is true the bicon has

brought all of the crystals and all of

the gems to me ultimate power is mine

the world as we know it is about to

end well as we know it is about to

end they could have make cortex shoots

like twice as often or something like

that actually make this a challenge but

no is exact same of spelling

[Music]

again I mean he did thr that in face of

Crash I guess still was a slight

difference hey when do you bounce back I

mean you landed on the mine still I do

have the ability to Sprint but I

mean they don't have the

Bazooka I

mean wouldn't exactly give crash much of

a

benefit see with ability my voice with

ability to

Sprint he should be able to

um Vortex should be able to shoot shoot

so much

more she buing in a bit more

extra wait why is the bnny

disappointed what have I done this a Ser

of a disappointed

bunny

hello there we

go

five of to five powerups 45 45 gems 30

of 30 H relics of which one is one is
