hello welcome
so I wanted to
be
hi welcome welcome
so I'm pretty terrible at starting
streets
how I should
begin but
um is everything running fine on the
Stream
I hope so
anyway
but this is kill the World As Seen there
it's signed by a company known as Sweden
kind of a weird name to give you company
the same name as the country it was
Hitler originates from
but
this is how it looks
the goal is to find the key
and get to the girl
and that's
the basics
no I'm not good at starting streams but
I guess it works
and then you have gaps like this and
then and these you have to jump over
and
that's
and then
you also have
walls that you can walk up
very simple
it's simple so far
[Music]
and you also are dangerous like bikes
and since this is a pool ball is that
what you call it
um
it would of course get destroyed by
spikes
something like a quarter heavy well I'm
being filled with air
you
foreign
how does this work that's the correct
action
I thought they set it up to be the
reverse
just give me a moment while I get it
because I did check the air controls a
beforehand but I apparently didn't check
that the controls actually worked in
game
and apparently the controls I was given
were
backwards
so thanks for that so I will wrote the
instructions
so now I
I think the inputs and Battery came
now
yes everything is working correctly now
you can also look down so you can see
where you're going
and also you can do that like I think
I meant to do that
another
point and also yeah
after you collect
[Music]
um
buy fruits
you get to uh
academic foot bonus level
which has changed rules because now
you're not supposed to collect the key
anymore
and elastics
work on every
block
and there we go
after completing a bonus level
you get to save the game
Unborn
[Music]
your message and say it came up with it
another way
let's get distracted by that
now after collecting both keys the Gown
is unlocked
and there's different
and you also have a time limit
though like that fancy from number four
two steps
I've seen a stop you have it you have an
hourglass that
I don't remember how long time you have
on each level probably the same time
every level
but as the time Runs Out
you see the numbers stick down
and by picking up an hourglass
it flips it
don't gain time like it doesn't add time
it doesn't reset the time it only flips
it so the times you have spent on the
level is now the time you have left
just like in our class Works in real
life
no
[Music]
in game rooms
my investments
right
and I saw everything you pick up
not exactly everything
I need to get on the outside
now
that will be this side
but almost everything you pick up
it gives you points
looking up
and when you pause the game you can see
the whole level
and you can see that I picked up
everything
except The Hourglass
and there's also a secret exit which I
know exists in this level
so and the points you earn as you can
see the golden numbers are the points
are currently have collected in this
level
only gray numbers are the total number
of points I've collected it's so cool
well
yeah I would say it's pretty basic
looking but it does its sharp which is
the most important anyway
the points is basically your health
so
uh when you win a level the golden
numbers are added to your total number
of points
allowing you to have more Health
basically
and then when you
release a level
and you will instead
lose
based on the number of points you've
collected so far
and then we have old score
level score and the new score it should
just have a plus size
foreign
[Music]
kind of
secret level
as usual good thing to collect
unless you make a mistake of course
but I want to ensure that I get as much
Point as possible this is after another
speed run
you don't get more points for finishing
a level quick it's only about
much points you have collected
I think that was all and you can always
double check to make sure that seems to
be the case
is that I can proceed to the girl
really short level
[Music]
let's go
let's contend that one issue we're
trying to collect all points is of
course
hourglasses to give you a point if you
want the absolute maximum points which
you have to care for it you should
actually wait out the timer and get The
Hourglass
[Music]
see exactly why I get points for an
hourglass that seems like an hour
you call it
oversight
because here we have pills I can show
you how to peels done
yeah
pills makes you dizzy but they don't
give you other points so they are
considered all the negatives but our
glasses can be positive and negative
no I
do think they should only
give you points
I guess picking one of these makes it
yeah also picking one of these does make
the timing go run faster as you can see
there
slightly
foreign
[Music]
design of the bonus
will
continue with you be used for multiple
levels
and then I can say
good I like the colors it's very
colorful
indeed
so
good bye there's different
and if you don't pick up a fruit from
one level that fruit will be pushed to
the next level
so you can still have a chance to pick
it up
but that means that your bonus level
will come one level later
so far
it stays fine but the levels will be
harder
but this is the
first world I guess
I think it's like 20 levels per word
I think the fruit is on the backside yes
it was and that's that that's all of it
but I don't remember which levels have
there's a level of fortunate because
you can wait out the time a bit
there we go
thank you I want anyway
try to watch out for
should be able to love
I'm supposed to go today
with the next level
here we go
okay not the next lemon and the level
after this baby
and this is a fun level
if you don't know the solution like
it's
a spikes this side no spice on this side
you can only jump over one
now his solution is too well it's
obvious when you know it
work on the side
you can also pick up stuff bye doing
that
oh here's to that one
where you have to walk back
your arms
right I can't you can't jump up
don't jump down or jump
on the same level
here's a level I heard people claim that
you have to pick up
those pills when you jump down
[Music]
I mean you can just jump down on this
side
but it's fine
I need to go here
I'm gonna pick this up for some bonus
points
oh I cannot jump back
and then find the exit there we go
everything picked up that gives fun
however in this level
I have not found any way to
get there without picking that up
oh no I missed the coin
this level does have something
interesting
some music
and I picked up everything I'm missing
is there a clearly level
which listens I'll get the same time as
well
and now we're moving on to the next
world
let's stay kind of the same world but
now it's grass instead of
this is
the previous one was a desert and now
it's
now it's grass
wait a minute
I'm supposed to jump down on again
to be on the safe side
we get everything feels like I missed
something
yes I got everything
the new ball oh yeah
the new balti is the
ball on the cover of the game
the pinky hiding on the back side
that's that's not how you know it's a
near level you got a new boat
I need to cast this liquor
and then you can play and then again
[Music]
limited numbers a number of time limit
amount of time
I think I
[Music]
[Music]
can if you don't relax it you can jump
out it goes
this one
where's the mixed point
now now it's getting a bit trickier
thank you
can sing about something
I should
need to be able to continue yes
and continue down here
it's just some coins
I guess that's all
I hope
[Music]
oh yeah there's nothing on the back side
of this dog so I just did this
thank you
this game is really cool looks fun it is
quite the
foreign
multiple
dimensions
kind of giving all the solutions but
it
oh so this one is longer than this one
wait I can do this
the points
which means I didn't really have to
leave those up there when I went over
the first time
know the solutions
more that's more the case
they're missing course
now there are three coins in each corner
or I have these rubies on the inside
which gives me a lot of points and when
you roll over a corner like this it
actually picks up the corner as well
otherwise this would be impossible to do
but luckily they they take that into
consideration I mean are we are
otherwise there would be quite rude to
be Place those there
now I've shown before if you don't
broadcast the wall you only move one
step forward
in the fruit ties in the back side so
there's a small level
it will be larger
and this level contains these
by Cube
they move in a set pass
so
picking up
coins or such does not make them
move any differently
[Music]
now I'm back at this level
come to check here you have to use a
fruit
maybe I should do the same thing but
with a good timing
even if you're walking around there okay
stages
no nothing hiding here
it just making sure
leave no coin behind
[Music]
wait a minute
not our class but that's damage not
not sure where this level has two keys
if they just can't be next to each other
like that
I'll do something there
it's quite enough for it thanks
oh I see
you get that one I had to jump down that
the first thing I did
well I haven't picked up every
everything yet anyway so it doesn't
matter
[Music]
Brothers
there's 11 to where
that was close I was a bit slow on that
and some people think you have to jump
on it
reside and thinking that's easy
very
today there should be a secret exit yeah
there is does it decide
what it is
you can add items with you ah if people
are just leaving them around
why not
here's a level
what happened there you cannot turn
twice in one move
in space now
can you turn twice in one move
no level of crazy to turn twice in one
move
don't know what happened there
anybody's
is a kind of Eternity but
[Music]
as I said this is the importance level
again
same layout as before
I'm gonna let the installation is
different
because
artists
okay new elements bouncy pets
they make you jump forward two steps
okay I need to
because there's a two-step Gap here I
cannot simply jump a little bit against
that
you get a little bit
and I've got diamonds
and then this top points out a step like
this points out sticks out
yeah
I can completely 40 seconds
[Music]
okay and then you say hi I need some for
two steps so this bounce the pan is
finished
me hiding here no
I can't get
and then jump it again
let's continue
another level
people start with
oh yeah I need to pick up the fruit
first
other one I can't get it now
not land on that side I have to go to it
first this means I skipped the fruit
meaning that that fruit is now pushed to
this level
yeah I have to think on this land like
here
needs land on that
first triple bounce bad which I can with
this one
and then right that's that
thank you
these platforms are only one that
Walmart but they are also raised up one
one step I mean that I cannot simply
jump up on them but these bounce pads
can
because they can move up one step and
forward
one and a half step
yeah that would put me straight into the
hood
I should pick this one
it doesn't matter which I'll be
so now I speak now you can see the enemy
look
there we go level
made and complete
well done no thank you
so I need to drink
and the reason why the game asked me to
save now
when I didn't complete the bonus level
is because that was the final level of
that world
I think
[Music]
and I think I don't know I think the
words are supposed to represent
different
countries around the world
like for some reason I wanted to
remember the first word as like
well somewhere inside doesn't well Egypt
or Sudan
it doesn't I don't think it matters it's
probably Egypt because it's more popular
and
but it should logically be Sudan and the
second one being a
for some reason I want to say Peru but
might be in Brazil or
what I'm thinking about her as the next
world
doing great thank you
it might be this far less called Peru
[Music]
means
and this world has
invisible platforms
isn't that nice I guess the good thing
is that you can see through them to see
if there's something on the backside
but you know there's a platform because
one rule of the game is that items must
sit on a platform items cannot simply be
floating in the air
and now since I picked up the shirt I
get bonus now one step late wait wasn't
able to just do this
[Music]
invisible
it does mean that if you do manage to
pick up the fruit on every level in
order you will get the experience in the
smaller platforms one level too early
we do know they exists you can do this
I should have gone other way
but there's nothing on this side
besides they haven't put anything there
probably only need in this book box
there to prevent you from coming around
oh wait they've actually put something
here yeah here they prevent you from
coming around
consistencies
go
oh I didn't get to say afternoon
I guess you get to save after every five
fifth level in that case irregardless if
it's a bonus line really so this was the
bonus level
we can do this
they scared all by doing that
is this Peru
that coin is two blocks away so I cannot
jump around two
I know I couldn't
move forward
yeah there's no problem okay
because I think it on the back side
and he has a tricky Pete if you remember
items cannot float they must sit on
something therefore there's a block up
ahead so I cannot simply jump over
I mean there it is but I do have to pick
that up if I want the
if I want to be thin
I think it's important thing to remember
if I jump down here that means that if
you go to the other side I have no
problem jumping back Mr said Miss behind
us
and of course
the invisible block is still here don't
forget about it
on your way back rest of it
and now
some
beat
this will heat up the bar but as the
ball is made of plastic I assume it will
melt
you can learn on these three times you
can do three moves one two three
hectic
foreign
that means that's the before the
strawberry
now I picked the
I put the pumpkin on the never before
that white drink
yeah that was the 35th level yes
[Music]
okay
I completely difficult to have this okay
as you can see here there's definitely
more than three I cannot simply walk
over but even if I did no wait
if I was invincible I could walk all the
way across turn around and then jump
over but that would be silly but you can
do this
[Music]
and I want the other stuff
thank you
thank you
so the bonus level is just
not allow me to save apparently
oh I don't know if it is a bounce back
on that
I don't want to pay it
should be obscene now there isn't
oh yeah I see I should do this
I'll do this
and to the other one I did this
thank you
okay time to take the rest
and I've seen
[Music]
there's no way to get the middle one
without doing this
that would have been death
if it wasn't because the level ended but
I assume there's no way to actually
yeah that bottom platform sticks out a
bit but because it's so further you
cannot really see it
there's a fruit
what's that hot stuff
it's been more stuff
[Music]
there it is that far
this is not from so long
I need to get back with second day by
jumping down in this hole like this
that was
not meant to happen
when to do this
thank you
now I can go to the gold
do the exit
which is just a big X
now
do we have these
and that's the fruit
and now
the last tricky one because that one is
much further out
and the key
is on the outside
[Music]
you know
feed the cat
something like this yes
I mean otherwise I deterrent twice and
then move towards it is amazing
there you go
I mean it should be fine yeah
there's a fruit
where's Starbucks
it's there okay
I mean I can get this
[Music]
let's pick it up
there you go I think I got everything
that gives points
oh
[Music]
now for these falling blocks also keep
points as far as I've tested I have
but that's not such a thing I've done
I've tried to really
go through these levels in the past over
every detail like
it could simply be something I missed
but
I don't think there's a way
to get those falling blocks in the
middle
I could be wrong but I don't think this
away
this level however it should be possible
goodness
moving spikes
yeah if you want everything
okay
[Music]
and I'll show you I'm trying to look
when I transfer it there you go got
everything
every single little coin
and now because these aren't following
blocks I can go the immediate Hyatt
Academy to give us
the voice I miss out on the coins
I should take that last
[Music]
so this is the exact same level as
before but now the blocks are invisible
I hope I get this coin I did
because if you roll up on it you
activate the
it
before picking up the coin
yeah so you don't get
you don't get the coin
look that doesn't work
it's one of those bouncy pets there
this is a big and confusing level
[Music]
but
what am I doing
I'm just running around oh I always
think that I should be kept
okay I'll wait a few seconds
so anyway let me see I should get after
that thing
I need to use that bouncer pathway
let's see
sure I can do that
wait that's from our side
I have some coins to pick up
Nature's coins to be kept
on coins nonetheless
so I'm supposed to jump down here yeah
and now I get over here
and the key is here
you can move around with us worrying
about
Let's see we didn't dance into points
it's making time around quickly it's
okay so I can pick your face as well
that
little secret bounce pads
this should be a two spaces yeah it's a
bit hard to see so I should land on that
three space
foreign
if you need this
amazing
oh yeah so if I go
around that do that side so I am on the
underside of the first line I can then
jump down on that thing that points out
move around 30 girls
yeah
so let's do that
time
and up here
and I picked that one up that was an
accident trust me
so smart
there's some info
thinking
I mean maybe it doesn't look simple at
first but when it as you get into how
you can move around in the game
yeah
it gets simpler
I mean it's still not super simple still
I'll admit that
[Music]
not trying to sound like it right like
if it's really simple for me
I mean like yes but
but um
there are still levels that
you give me a challenge
that's it
these old retro games I've played on way
too much
useful
and
a block can only be a one type mini that
because this is I can see it
because this is one of these
grilling types
that means that yeah you can see it in
this corner that it has this on every
side
because it cannot have different things
on different sides it can have different
items on different sides
this game would be a challenge for me at
the start maybe but if you you'll get
into it
you could try it out
helping helping your brain work
there we go ah they added an extra here
interests
yeah exactly so if you do would still a
leap of face at the start there
clearly you didn't have to but if you
were to do that
you wouldn't die
my brain is not too smart
maybe you should
do a few brain exercises or something
you might be smarter than you think
you must be Spartan
because
your own intelligence
I know you are smart
where's the next section
oh yeah because these are only one space
apart I can jump around like that
because I remember them being an
entrance
Mr coin
now
I need I need my coin
I think I left the coin behind to get a
better idea where these blocks are
here we go
and also you don't have to navigate
through those you can just jump over
thank you if you're making me blush
and blush
you're making me blush
so that's my revenge I'm I'm saying nice
things to you too
so this level the only ball
a bit of a Canadian style ball
only tells me it is a Canadian style I
don't need to jump over this but it's
funny
because this is not Iceland and I
wouldn't be surprised if it's kind of
meant to be Canada or something
is there an official at least after
hey
levels
all right let's continue with the bonus
flower
they don't even allow you to go on the
side meaning that you cannot
this is one of those annoying ones
oh my I can be even
more nice to you oh
hey no that's me that would be too much
for me to handle
Zara
oh
to make sure I can if I just roll out on
this I'll miss the coin as far as I know
but if I jump I will land on the coin
that's how I get the last coin
with mid maxi
no I didn't mean to pick that up
I made mistakes too
I almost felt like jumping there but
then I realized I would be stupid
I hope I don't need to go back
are you sure
you should be there
eat it I need everything I want every
collectible we shall see about that
that sounds like a threat
you're setting me like with saying good
things
no no back
yeah it's fine to move down here
saving some time by jumping this exit
okay
and this is a level that actually starts
with a short timer
like I said I still don't know if
on our levels I have the same total
amount of time and the only difference
here is a level could change the
starting time
[Music]
okay now the levels are getting a bit
more complicated
I need this coin if I don't take it now
foreign
I don't think I had a pumpkin before but
I have had
I had apples I mean that's that's a very
basic fruit I haven't I haven't had
watermelon
banana of course more of them even now
there's only three of them
and strawberry I've had that too
so I just go with crochet or left or
yeah it's a left turn go straight left
her and you're straight to the go
you're super smart
I need to make you jump
and your you
I'm so smart I know that you made a typo
there
and your voice sounds super beautiful
sometimes I feel like it a bit
me
I would say I would never threaten you I
would only be super nice day
but you started me by saying it but
saying nice things to
me and my typos
I mean if I I don't know if you are on
your phone on keyboard
but we're not on my phone
lying in bed I do a lot of typos
when I'm watching
some sprints
so
eyes what what was that
ice forces you to move forward
that's that's a typical thing in games
I think I should do this yes
I had I had faith in my lip
and
as you have seen you can roll around
edges like this but you cannot roll
around edges like this I'm pressing
forward nothing happens
but when you're on eyes
you can move across an edge like that
but when you do you don't turn around
the edge
that ticking noise
and I think this one is between yeah
so I should actually demonstrate what
happens so I said you cannot push
forward there and but you can push for
Edge like this and when you do you go
around the edge the same thing happens
when you're on ice
but
when you're an eye is under this Edge
you just fall down like that
hey that's
pretty dangerous
because that could result in you falling
off the level
okay
I wanted to see if there was at least
our parents
no it doesn't
seem like people know what levels are
what
banana
oh no it's coming for me uh
oh it actually did come for me
okay this happens when you die which is
the first time I died or got captured
apparently
you have the old score you have the
level score which you have collected so
far that that would be attracted
a smart move there
thank you
and then you get the penalty for failing
and the penalty increases for every
level or work I don't remember which it
is and then that subjects from your
total score
so now I lost some point
so
that's not fail this time
this
is
[Music]
yeah
next time
and then I do this it's a very quick
level to complete if you just want to
complete it but I want it
if this is a fun lemon because
you know can you just let me down
if I want
a good time
come on
come on thank you
okay there's a lot of games
oh this is tricky
I'm going to get this last coin I need
to jump on it here we go
well done
[Music]
yes I want to go here you can take the
key immediately but if you also want to
pick up the pill
so this is a lovely how to
what do I say fall off the level
and that wouldn't be
[Music]
because yeah
but I want different
Let's Race those wings
don't get hit
me I'm trying I'm trying my best
wait a minute
doing something wrong here
you mean
give me that hourglass
I'm gonna watch all this
let that go past
no don't jump up
jump oh what I'll pick up the first
immediately
up
okay I'm wasting another
points and try to get the fruit
no need to get it through to get my
points back
this
is that that's what I wanted to do
now I can completely
which I did before
let's um
since I lost so much time so much points
I need to pick up this one
we'll pretend that didn't happen yeah
yeah I I cut that out from when I
applaud it on YouTube later
and now I want I can't put you doing
that
it will be uploaded exactly like you
haven't played
oh I do cut down the countdown from the
before the stream starts that I do cut
down from YouTube
God to make it look perfect
in that case I also have to cut down my
voice because now I said that I would
cut things out
[Music]
but if I really want to make it perfect
I would use safe States
is there something on the back side no
tracing
so I can redo every level until I can do
every level perfectly
do you want these rubies
[Music]
shortcuts
now let's continue down here
does that helps back
let's point this house in this game
is there a bouncy pad on backside
so
let me oh is that how you're supposed to
pick it up
when I was going to pick it up in a
different way but I guess
I guess that works too
yeah I need to
yeah the way I was going to because
that's that wouldn't actually work if I
if I would have gone for it
I wouldn't
and so I I was thinking about just
skipping the key jumping over to the
goal pick up the fruit but then I will
be stuck there no I wouldn't I could
just simply jump down from cold because
can stand on the side and just jump down
on there sing
wait a minute
no and then I move around and yeah I
would my the idea I was going to do it
would actually work too
but it forced me to pick up the food
there's an evil game
and I need to put
I couldn't see it
oh there's one there
nice
one block from it
okay I can't completely missed that
there was one
but now that I know where it is
makes things easy
you're a perfect game yeah read this as
a fake
no
here we go
oh yeah
I'm working here
and
okay now on this side now I can pick it
up
no surprises no good
I should be able to do this
yeah there we go
now I can access the fruit
I think I missed one food so far
[Music]
how can you say I'm perfect by not
making mistakes
oh yeah I'm supposed to slide this up
let this thing go past
light up
oh yeah there's a fruit
nothing like suspect
species
let's go
I did it
you're perfect to me that's very nice
very nice of you to say
but no one is perfect we
have lost and this is a new thing now
now I can
stand here the rest of the Stream
and also the time it stops when you pass
the game as well
[Music]
um
if my girl for that key I'm dead
that might move up I'm not around like
that and I get a key
but I don't get the fruit
not if I move the other way instead
I think are different
should have turned around on the time
stopping platform
and now
I shouldn't have jumped oh
that wasn't perfect
in any way
okay
um
there's the girl
and I think I'm standing on this one
here so basically have to move to the
other side
but I did leave a coin behind
but I can't pick up the coin
I can't be Capricorn because I'm not
cute
it's fun fun level of perfect
okay I did pick up everything here so I
guess I assume that's the perfect
it's not perfect because I did pick up
the piano which gives you nothing so you
shouldn't pick it up
okay that was kind of fun
[Music]
Chinese
[Music]
for you
let me share all the point of that was
but sure
I'll take it
no I failed the bonus
yeah I realized how I was supposed to
jump there
but now save states so
oh
did you see that
you should never pick up kills no you
should never well
um
well I mean
I have picked up pills to get a clock to
milk quicker
no oh whatever's close oh look at this
I really thought I was going to fall
into that wheel
or tired
[Music]
I thought I was gone for nights yeah it
was kind of nice solution
yeah let's see
thank you I got everything
I'm at the top of the level again
that's pointy look at quite a simple
lemon
be honest
that sounds like impression are there
any other coins there is a fruit on that
thing so I had to go to the exit first
and then there are the coins in the
middle and then there's nothing else
okay I can do that
there's a girl okay
wait a minute
I will just get the fruit by just going
to the girl
I don't actually have to
okay
so the keys should be on these two
okay
one key
and then the other key is the other one
not that's why this way
and also these time stopping thing seems
to be an item because it's only appears
on one side and I've never seen an item
and a Time stopper on each other
foreign
[Music]
I have been able to pick up all the
items in the past
using save states
but
without it
so now if I'm editing
very large lamp it needs largely
then I need to move over to the other
side
which I see are one way of doing
and then I'm still looking for gray and
I should be able to easily get down to
the key
thing okay
foreign
stopping ability I'm running out of time
okay last one
okay
I can do that
I can't do that
wanted to take a shortcut but it didn't
allow me to but I did it
and as far as I get that I actually
picked up everything as well
I'm kind of proud of that
[Music]
I hope I'm allowed
buckets
no
no left one step two
steps forward
chasing my words
one step two stepper I'm proud of you
thank you
that's it means a lot to me
not picking up these on purpose
because I can't forget how to get
through the
glass
that would be silly
okay
since I don't waste time anymore
let's see how I should get to the other
parts
I have somebody else
I need to get to this part
and then hit spin spin speed
that banana
I can't get back down here
without doing a Precision jump
just in case
is this the way to the girl
no this is the way to go
yeah
I was supposed to go by by the plastic
girl in the beginning so I could get the
Ruby
but
it's not a perfect run in that case I
would have to use same sticks I guess
that could be an interesting
next world
now it's Error of times arrows
what is that on an arrow
you can only move in the direction of
the arrow you cannot even jump over it
it is like there are blocked around the
arrow
wait but I'm missing coins
hydrate
okay bonus
wait a minute
my face is very important
foreign
I think that's it
I got it
I got everything
more arrows
but I want that coin
oh wait I could have picked up the coin
I should get that point now
ah I got both
and here's a princess but I want to go
to the guild
I can't get sticker
[Music]
series
wait a minute this is the wrong side
so smart
yeah the sink outside the box
wait a minute this thing continues
great
there you go
level complete
I was a new ball we didn't mention the
ball
the price stream it kinda
I mean it was scheduled since like
this since Monday
it's a surprise thing
they are I kind of made these breast
streams
for some reason a lot of people showed
up in the previous one so I wanted to
make another
but
so far
not a lot of people have showed up
I mean I'm I like I like your company of
course
I'm still at work waiting for everyone
to bring back the scanners
oh yeah
having to rely on other people
now
time to go to the Gown which should be
on the backside of DC
and here we got
a long
legit one
I think it moves differently
and much slower
it moves it can't turn Corners which
those small small spiky ones doesn't do
and as you remove items they can expand
their
range
it's supposed to pick up
what am I doing
oh this is what I'm doing
hourglass
that doesn't give me
I don't remember this screensaver from
way back
yeah I don't think this was a
screensaver
well I guess that's a solution but
wait I'm running around in a loop
come on
I hear that my best friend and I were
playing a game last night late night
and I saw you stream and wanted to see
it surprise it
but then you wrote a chat message to me
showing that yours then online so it
wasn't much of a surprise anyway
okay I need to break myself my way
backwards so I'm getting there and then
I need to go there but to get there I
can only get from there that part
give me a moment
oh yeah now I see the solution
I know I can't hide anything from you
you don't need it
let me editing your passwords to every
site
so yeah a new feature
teleporters
and teleporters
really simple in how they work
and they're kind of loud as well you
step on one
I guess they weren't too loud
then you'd get teleported
of course
if you want to teleport back you can
just jump on it
should be on this side
there is ah no the exit is there so I'm
going to go back
I wonder not my password to everything I
can
wait do you have one password
that doesn't seem safe
at the user password match everyone
yeah better not
[Music]
yeah you have to actually land on these
before it's the count take care not sure
what's the point oh the spikes are there
so you cannot jump and stand on those
blocks blocky blocks
we can still do that because
I can't
either you can't stand one of them
that doesn't help me much
okay they'll have a second
too complicated now
I think it's
okay so it moves between these these two
now why I why did I stop
why did I look but yeah it came came to
attack machine that it moves further
okay
I guess that's proved my point
it's stuck between those keys until you
remove the keys
that sounds like an insult
oh wait what happened
I'm sorry
and I got the notification for the
stream right as I was getting ready to
go outside to check all the trains about
200 of them today
that's a lot of trailers
okay
am I doing things correct
I don't know
I'm just doing
and hoping for the best
he's in that way if
that
just living and hoping for the best
I guess the video count there on Twitch
is a bit late
yeah
plugin for this
remings thing
it's a bit delayed
wouldn't it be nice with a teleporter in
real life
I'm almost at a million points
[Music]
and sometimes
they can be multiple like there's
multiple yellow ones here
that means that they move between each
and now I think I'm freaking starch now
I can move out to the blue ones
yeah they should be a secret there wait
this is a secret to the girl I should
probably
yeah you should probably pick up that
diamond first
you can do it
that's the motivation I need I just keep
The Hourglass there
maybe that's fine
[Music]
oh my
another is Sleepy point
hello I thought that was scum for it
but anyway
let's do that again
wait a minute
I must
of course that was obvious
laughs
no I can do this
I do want an hourglass and there's one
there okay
uh to get back if I get back on that
that's pretty simple
and there's a key there as well
there's a key in there as well okay well
that's no problem
when the girl is there so I just need to
get an inside and I should be able to do
that with this
like this
all right I've got two more keys to pick
up
like some
like something there's a key there so I
need the teleporter oh yeah I'm sure
wasting time though
that wasn't supposed to do that
[Music]
so many keys
there now yeah
that was an oh no moment
let me focus on getting those other Keys
first
these keys
sure again
why they have
the monkeys close together like that
this is the black man much a point of
that
resetting back everything here
so
well now I know how to get it again
you know
I'm running out of drinks
oh no also a message kind of got delayed
for some reason
thank you
anyway
I need more
smart coins
I need more bunny drink yeah I need to
fill up that will take us in a minute
waiting on one more box of skeletons
I was gonna be back in just a minute
and I came back
of feeling this thing
so
more to drink
on
is gone I guess we should behave
I mean you should always behave
in the we are misbehaving today
show me some Miss behind me in the chat
[Music]
oh some
stuff
yeah okay
I tried to come up with something but
then my brain came up so
oh no bump on his back
to back to normal
your spelling is
something
I think he meant oh no fun fun is back
so back to normal
wants to do this
okay
take those
this one step nugget looks like two
steps
those looks like two steps
hi
oh yeah
I found the solution
you can
oh
do you want misbehaving I can use the k
word
yes I contact
any part is that allowed here
really because I found I
love me
what are you trying to say I
I think you're misbehaving with your
awfulness like
because I found a bunny
where did you find the bunny
wait a minute I'm not supposed to go
look moving blocks
and yes running around like
bunny
foreign
language you're allow in your chat
preferably nothing
explicit
preferably now swear words
in the video on the right side look at
the beautiful bunny
you think she's beautiful I wish I
looked like that
another spoiler I don't live like that
I don't thank you your name lucky
okay one more track
take care
I haven't heard you use any vulgar
language so I don't know if it's allowed
I mean I wrote these rules that you know
oil keeps going to I mean like
not much swearing or something
I would be fine nothing like this way
I mean like
I'm gonna do sweating myself that's too
far
I'm supposed to do this okay
but then I can't get the fruit
I miss the fruit again
my tooth is behind
wait I can get this fruit though
it's it's not gonna be far enough
no problem before it is funny
why am I going uh going there okay
it's not that animal which now what it
means I'm pretty sure people know it
like it's like
I think people are a lot of people have
an idea
it depends on which king what you're
talking about
this doesn't mean anything in English or
Swedish that I'm aware of maybe it has a
meaning in Swedish
987-490
actually it's pronounced similar to the
Swedish word for curve you know the one
okay yeah
the Swedish water would be good River
and I'm pretty sure people are quite
aware of that one
[Music]
wait these blocks are showing up too
early spoilers don't live
because this is for the next one
[Music]
I know the word yeah you know the word
oh
and what's inside the lock and see the
paint
[Music]
how about that
there we go
well done
yeah that bonus level shows up a bit too
early
even though I have missed two fruits
roots
I fell through it
well I missed the fruit that is maybe I
did pick it up last time
I don't remember
all right so I got a million points I
seven
oh
that's how you get the key
[Music]
where's the music of Arthur music
think I can do this
and when it's falling up
that was
airing
no thank you black
okay didn't get the Sapphire
can I just jump over no of course not
this one I wanted
no it's too far away no where there's an
outlet
I don't need it at that point
the music ran away
yeah I'm not sure if that's it
what you're actually supposed to do but
it works
come out okay
no it's oh
what's this
could be too simple get it
I miss the prettiest one
what
bye that was miscalculation
okay I'm struggling a bit
but now I know where the fruit is so now
I can pick it up
it is apparently hiding inside of luck
apparently that's a valid position
[Music]
I'm below a million points now
finally last pack of scanners is here
finally you can go home
yeah that's a safe
definitely
there we go
enough
I can't see this
messages on this thing nope
okay
I get the same so that's good
so is it next one oh yeah it's next part
is it this world oh yeah it's this word
this is a fun world
a new balance one
I need music
[Music]
yeah I need to go to gold first
that's good because it's flashing eye
I guess a kid picked up the bridge
this was a mistake
mistakes were done
[Music]
kill
a lot of pills
a secret Ruby
and there we go
we feel they
yeah
don't eat too much pills
okay let's see
two things
pick that up
the fruit as well
you have some coins
and this is a tricky one because you
cannot jump into the girl like that you
have the laminate
like that
and I open a million points again
okay this looks like a very complicated
why wasn't
for the previous one
this is like a whole level in itself
While others missing his keys
girlfriend
well it's time for me to go ever since
put away now I gotta print my skin is
locked for tomorrow's in the report for
tonight she came along and then go home
because you'll need to move all of them
understandable
um
this is a zombie game
that's my attempt
yeah it looks like I missed the key but
it was a
[Music]
thletic color right
can I get that one
I got it
I am rich
now we got new ones
every time they will make one step
and I make a mistake
and I can move a they have to move one
step and they can move
any free space
[Music]
and the movement Is Random
we have the fruit I don't see whereas it
would be
Rich bunny
with a million point
it sounds like a weird movie title
and that sounds like and that was Asylum
but I saw an invisible Square
see if I can remember that
the left one on the back side
foreign
running out of time
still
anything other funny stuff happening
three two
other things on the other side
yeah the other key
hello
I think I collected everything
almost everything
so I got this
there you go
[Music]
well this level makes me confused
I found money
parts of my kangaroo place
but what you store the bunny
there was that Harmony and you stole it
[Music]
sunglasses
makes Sushi invisible blocks because
that's surprised about sunglasses too
all right
yeah I don't think I can get back
[Music]
I think I look like that you can spin
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
so now this is going to be problem math
[Music]
I guess you're supposed to force the
people that actually
and I don't get no remaining stuff
[Music]
cute
secret books
okay but then you have to tell me what's
what the books say
what kind of books are there
no you don't have to tell me everything
also this is in the future buttons
buttons you can press by running on top
of them
and they activate this yellow button
activates yellow things and I
that was stupid
[Music]
how silly of me and I was even safe by
standing on top of
them
as teleporters are items to be taking up
space
you know what book
they are of Tony oh
attending like I didn't
specifically yeah
I don't know what books they are
foreign
[Music]
okay this is the I mean okay there's
been a previous levels what that bonus
level
which had the
two by two blocks
the pieces are five by four block now
find it foreign
large
blocks you can move creamy they are
quite bright
this is one such thing
foreign
[Music]
the blue things make funny sounds
did it
if that's it that's it oh anything
because we haven't gotten enough new
things this is a bouncy pill
as the plants make you constantly jump
so every move you do
moves you forward
however if you do decide to jump
that makes you move forward
an additional stuff
three blocks that you can jump over two
plus
foreign
oh yeah you can because you can stand
the next to it and then you can make a
long jump of course
I realize that you're late
the first
don't really know why they are I'm some
bounce bills here
but they don't do anything
they don't give you any points either
which is also strange because whenever
you have bouncy PLS you're forced to
pick them up because you need them to
actually completely down and you are
actually forced to become the airline
okay
after that I mean
and because you're always bouncy you
cannot feel around the block no more
now you're making this sound that's so
cute that's too cute
[Music]
yeah like yeah I cannot progress the
level without picking this up so why are
the two of them
I had to remember that this is just
a perfect job
so that'll help okay
all right
five thousand
they should have taken that in the
consideration
you shouldn't land on the edge
in the middle of it
[Music]
oh one of these yeah there's a bonus
level
nice
it doesn't need to be anything or at
least
thank you
okay
okay give them just in case
I needed to pick something up but there
wasn't anything more to pick up
there you go that's the bonus levels
first I need to pick up the fruit
and then I can pick out the passive
yeah I see awesome especially
I was gonna say was there something
secret than Pakistan
can't reach it
yeah whenever you get to channel points
we never get 50 followers
I've got 38 at the moment for 12 more
but then plus two because it seems it
seems like two followers don't count
when I whenever I reach 52 followers I
can
and then
it has to go through the process
again I cannot do anything without
picking this up
why how did you
maybe they want the Symmetry symmetry
and eyes again forces you to move
forward
but because I have the bounce pin it
forces me to do a regular job so I can
no longer need to light
if I just move forward here
jump
but it was I did not
am I supposed to get that key
well that was an easy fridge kinda came
to me
within the time limit that's all that
counts
yes I do would like to see
I would gladly like to save the game but
it should be next world is this the
world I'm thinking of
oh it's the laser world
but another easy fruit
I'm not trying yet about the fruits
see yeah and the music is sensitive
and yeah the laser at the end there
prevents you from going around the block
the wrong way
clever way to use a laser the kids used
spikes but they want these laser
[Music]
okay
how do you
uh what
sorry I don't know what those are
couch
okay
now I'm very confused I obviously this
level is soluble but
that's not the solution
this level may be very confused all of a
sudden
oh now I see I see
when you saw now it looks kind of like a
kid
I don't know she's gonna
partly
it's like stylized
[Music]
no
definitely not if you
not here to
anyway moving on as one solution
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
job
yeah I don't see a really a point of
going on here
oh yeah that's how I get to this
I don't see a point of going around
there except that's the solution of the
level
yeah so it was a bit empty
okay so far
yeah I think I'm
it is wrong
so no wait can I save this
yeah I can say these
I did it you're doing great thank you
yeah I found a solution I was afraid
that I completely messed that up
hello
but I did it
it
I guess I should just time that
yeah and then
please
okay it didn't happen no wait this isn't
working
Diamond but I will fall off the devil
no
foreign
okay that's a simple solution
it's listed
yep
so I can just jump down from here down
there
and now
we can land on the platform
yep
I wanted to see if there's not something
more but let's just completely level and
that's oh no it's this level
okay I guess I'm supposed to be on the
other one
I think that one reaches closer
I feel her glasses let's reset it
[Music]
the exact thing waiting
[Music]
and then I will land on that one and
then I'll let you go on other side
but should I pick up the coin
and I want the coins but
maybe I should ignore the coins
I should avoid it
is younger please come back
looks difficult
it's
should it be too difficult to get the
keys
all right we cut the coins
all right actually
[Music]
and I also got another art class there
so I can
I will wait for it to move down
pick it up
now
time to move to the code
here we go
let me checking there's no secrets and I
did it did it pretty well I would say
so that was 95 levels
are
100 of them
oh
wait a minute
I can start to let 150 150 not just 100
I was wrong 150 levels
you're amazing thank you
the first is a bit of a laser part and
then it's back to this kind of
I see
a bouncy segment
[Music]
I have to make sure that the jumping has
the same
all right it's kind of off in this song
this song is kind of slower I think
the pizza there's a bit of a bit
and if you do think it is unbeat that's
probably
[Music]
because you hear that when it actually
is on the beat
now wait I disabled that one let me go
over
here
need to be able to get over there
everything is just one block off but I
cannot jump down on it
my brain is sticking ticking thinking
part of this
might just come back signs that the
point
kind of forgot that was backside
telling me
that was the solution around time
your brain is so super smooth
thank you
but
I don't feel like
foreign
[Music]
yeah this is one of those levels I have
to disable
the lasers
oops
did you stop picking up stuff
well that was a mistake
it's so much for being super smart
[Music]
you're super smart to me
that's nice if you'd say
so I got the red disabled
and now I can enter that one
she will disable the green one
now
I can take this shortcut that they have
so nice little bit there and I can
disable the blade
and I think I collected everything
so do you like it
[Music]
meaning
Rick told you I would at least five
things
I'm just about it
thank you
why is this level easy it's like they
put the levels
what was what was the challenge there
compared to the other stuff that it cost
you
so I should probably activate that thing
first
how do I get back
[Music]
I can't get back I just used to do a
random jump and see if it's something
happens
I mean sure I can't get the key by doing
this
the fruit by doing this
but
yeah oh yeah I see I think
now that now this brain is thinking
[Music]
how about that
you can do it I think I just did
I mean I do like the view of this all
those coins on the sides
and then when you go back
it looks so empty
anyway
here to go
[Music]
blocks of course of course puppy can't
be too simple and organic
good
so I need a way to activate this one
oh that's how you do it
it has been activated
yeah with your smart trainers
crazy smart brain
okay
the girl
it's cute anyway he's my friend cute
so that was 100 levels
oh no I should say it 100
months so we're kind of back to this
kind of level again
this time there's actually a yellow
teleporter
I can switch it to this mode
and this one acting instead
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I think I need to use that one or to get
back to the exit okay
[Music]
animals that don't give points yeah and
then I use this one
it doesn't really have a point to take
this because I could just this one jump
down
and if it didn't exist it kinda makes it
oh there's a secret exit
I forgot about it
just about your eyes cute and nice
that's that's good to know I will
continue being just the way I am
I mean it's easier to try to be the way
I am
if you no thank you
being here
and making me happy
I'm comfortable
I like the way you are I Like the Way
You Are
as well
you are so positive even if I say that
you are being
too positive
and nice
[Music]
our class there I would like to have
[Music]
what it is
okay
I've been killing
attack that's where I'm going
let's exit
[Music]
okay
alone button
to read it what's the point I mean like
for this point of the button's existence
if I can change the state of it
[Music]
doesn't seem to
oh
it does actually something it activates
the laser
foreign
as far as I can tell there's no red
teleporters if there's no point of this
then don't activate it
and I do have to activate the yellow
because it has a teleporter
but I should pick up the food first and
then I can activate it because well
[Music]
it does close off the fruit area
okay
new out of the way
are you think
there's an hourglass I should pick it up
I don't exactly need it but
there you go I think I picked up
everything
and time for another bonus wait same
bonus but ah it got some breaking point
it's breaking blocks
and they got an Underside as well
I assume I have to go down here I just
wait no I shouldn't
[Music]
that was the wrong move
but on a bonus level you cannot lose
points
[Music]
a bonus let me only get one chance
ew and arrow have refused
[Music]
though the color of the ball changes
every time you get a bonus level
now I think it's changed depending on
which level
it is
a step on that one it's going to
[Music]
I need I need the green to be on
oh yeah and then they have the arrows
because it's not you're not supposed to
take the easy pass
I missed the fridge I didn't see it was
there
it was there all the time
[Music]
okay I have to disable
when all except for one I think
the green blocks the greens I cannot
have the green turn on
she's happy enough now
so I can activate this yellow
because as far as I can tell
oh yeah
red
dress no it's a blue one I should use
them
Yep looks to be correct
no the blue blocks the blue wait a
minute
no
they all block
I see they are blocked themselves
as I'm supposed to tease
that's silly of me I could just have
done that
[Music]
oh wait a minute I forgot to pick up the
fruit
I see a little bun
taste a little one
I forgot so yeah now I read that message
every time it loads like this it like
the color of the ball changes now
it is very
hexagonal
pentagonal Lenexa and hexagonal
as you cannot create a ball with just
pentagons or hexagons
as far as I know you have to combine
those so
this is one of these weird
inverse
no and of course there are errors on
every end point like that
reverse
yeah
blocks I don't know what you would call
them glass blocks that disappears when
you're touching them instead of
appearing when you close them
[Music]
it does make it a bit disorienting
that I want the coins
thank you
I'm just jumping
and kind of have blind gems but that's
the shape of it
[Music]
oh no oh no
these transparent blocks make my head
hurt
s
um
quite something aren't they
[Music]
it looks nice it does have a nice look
in it
even if they are that hurting really
foreign
Cube
[Music]
oh no oh no
am apparently not allowed to do that
okay
apparently
that should be safe and that one should
be enabled
foreign
there we go right
now I need a better position
and jump over it
I think I should know I should
oh wait
there we go that's what I need to press
nothing seems to tell nobody tells me I
should have picked up there
key before I did all that I can see that
um so that was a mistake
I need to do this there we go
enable the green
without anybody
getting a better position
and now
now I did it
second attempt
is this a lot of breaking blocks
you did it yay
I did after
one after one failed attempt
it is counting I mean aside from the
game can't they score
[Music]
since I cannot lose points and bonus I
can just pick this up
so
how am I supposed to do this
because John
that way I can then fall down
but then I cannot
look back because I'm in the wrong
direction
and
I don't remember anything about rolling
around an edge
it is a solution obviously but
um
I don't see it
no okay you can actually move like that
but I'm
okay so that was the selection but I
just rolled one step to a little so I
messed everything up
foreign
there we go
11 successfully completed
so it's been three hours now so
and I got to save it so I think this is
a fair points to edit on
and then next time I play this game
whenever that would be I'll do this
level
sounds fair
[Music]
yeah
it's it's just space no there is no
space
I guess I'll write one or without a
space
records 100 like 111 11 shouldn't be 110
levels because I didn't give you the
last one
and six foot seven
and three hours 19 minutes active
playing Seminole ring passes and stuff
I see women
yeah thank you yeah that one's quite
well I haven't played that game in a
long long time that wasn't that I was
sure how well I was actually going to do
that
and I could just always make a complete
fool of myself
but it actually went well so I'm happy
for that
so
that's that or this time and
you were great thank you uh Hey though
goodbye already
so but at the moment no other no one
else I know is online so I actually
don't have anyone ready it is fun the
it's a tune to the rains I can since I
would like the
watch another Channel anyway
so
why not the video everything in that
case but that's it no one else is online
so I got no oil do you breathe at the
moment
sadly
it's fun seeing your videos that that's
great here
you could read some random person that I
don't know but that's
getting to know them first
just in case I know who they are what
they are like and so on
though I guess I just
have to end the stream here thank you
all for coming
thank you all even if you don't
haven't written anything in the chat so
far
still happy to
that you joined to watch anyway
everyone is welcome

I guess yeah
still trying to reach 50 followers so if
any of you currently watching if you

otherwise
I will just
close down the stream now and then I
will stream what's today's date it's
Wednesday so it's Thursday that should
be more spiral
Aspire 3 with using our flames
you can check the schedule for time so I
don't have the 45 time zones

updated so if you do yeah you can try to
follow if you haven't followed me yet
and it will actually show up in the chat
