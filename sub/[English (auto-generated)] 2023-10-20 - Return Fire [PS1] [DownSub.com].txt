here we go that was last no that wasn't

last that was

the wait was this

the yeah this was the last map I did

that and did that and now it's for this

one yes and then I think that one is an

extra level

but can't skip this one but this one is

the one I'm going to

do

theat yeah that it there we

go

well why not get going two two minutes

left on the prediction to put in your

point but looks like everyone has done

that that's a lot of location for LS

so

I basically have to find my way through

there I don't think the timer starts

until I first select the vehicle I could

be wrong about

that oh someone's already shooting me oh

no they're shooting the

bridge that would actually be terrible

that's how you can start the

level

stop shooting

me I need to take care of you first

before you destroy the

bridge that would be almost an immediate

game

over okay one L on this wall here

here and then there's one last tower

that keeps trying to

shoot trying to shoot me and then H

think the

bridge so that's taking care of so now I

don't have to worry about the bridge

getting

destroyed that would have been a really

funny start at

11

so yes what is the quickest I don't

know trying to plan

out the

moves to

do I don't like the amount of Mines so

I'm going to remove more of

the

need

Towers I do appreciate when the towers

are helping me take

down

okay I'm basically shooting kind of

blindly at the moment

oh there you

are

okay I take care of everything

no good two more

day way too many

Towers now I wonder how far those misses

fly they have a maximum distance until

they disappear in SC

air in

Snag and I

yeah they do fly a beat out of you well

I guess I can keep it up here yeah it

does not fly too far just disappears

whoops to close it that

mine

okay making it

safe or a helicopter

T I can clear off these

mines they sure causing me a lot of

trouble

can't up the time

no there we go that's

fine as long as it's shallow water is

fine cuz when it Bridge breaks over deep

water that surprise

com

okay that's taken care of at

[Music]

least to be

called why they would

like really Beau for no real

surprise yeah it's very video game

like video game video

game video game a video

game see this is

safe this going to be slightly slower to

get across there every

time

so much safer

now okay I'm not

exactly

okay should probably plan out

my yes Sho each other sounds like a good

idea

okay not sure why it breaks it sounds

like a bush breaks or something when it

looks like concrete a

bon pretty sure much rocket launchers

are indirect

fire support weapons usually the ones

that aren't are man

carried

so yeah so I'm working myself up

there and then I have to

work let me just check one more check on

the map yeah there are Towers

everywhere among those flag

buildings so I can't really

if I were to try to enter with a

helicopter it would just be shot

down fairly

quickly me

follow thank thank you for

following now I should just read your

name

alo alo albo that's your

choice no of of course is

but the

Fanboy are you a cute

fanboy

you for

Ling not even saying hi it's

fine to say hi it's always this is nice

KN

that

you decided to open up

the so it's

pretty

safe oh thank you for removing

the I don't know if it should probably

remove some more

mines just to make a bit safer to go

through

here

oh there we

go I'm here just playing Spider-Man so

got you

tapped oh thank

you have have

fun are

you when you say playing

like oh my mind assumes a game I mean

you could just play a film

for having P planted bon bon on

on I got that from I don't remember

there was a stream I who played ins

Spire with pon pon mod and

said and when he got the power up he

said time for pon pon to get the bon bon

on that should have been a

clip but sadly I saw the V on YouTube so

it was too late to make it a clip I mean

I guess you you you

can take a portion which could be good

too know for streamers you can take a

portion of video put it up on Twitch it

must be longer than 1 minute and then

you can make a clip out of

that which is what one of my Clips

is don't think I need to remember

but oh no the bush

destroyed

no you're you're missing rotated the

helicopter that's a issue with attacking

with the helicopter getting attacked

rotate or moves

since

H sorry

[Music]

for approaching

try to destroy that thing there you go

finally making it a

[Music]

bit a bit safer to pass through with a

heavy

thing

here comes the

tank

up here so I can pause through a bit

quicker oh another follow thank you for

following

[Music]

time is that a naral with a chainsa s

instead of

that's that quite the

description

when I chaina another

one

you don't want to meet that in a dark

alleyway I

mean not sure what they normal is doing

there though

but but I'm not going to question it

when it has a chain shot

so so that there go is to get through

there we

go if I do destroy the towers on the

other side it is a bit quicker

to

like get through the oh thank you for

destroy yeah and I do do need access to

filling up the tank as

well hopefully none of those mines are

too

close I guess I can not shoot down those

mines even though I really want

to me

too

oh had some

ammo dang

it a finally Animal Kingdom has

developed something better than sp sp

yeah if it's working too yep don't the

hand n chain

one is that a

challenge a challenge to not angry it no

it doesn't sound like a

challenge I mean I know what you mean

but

I just do okay whatever I thought it was

fun so I don't distract the bite anymore

you

know

okay I do have to destroy this one let

go the mind there can stay but not this

one

Orin I think they're far enough from

just going to say how did the house

survive

that so I can leave those

mines

[Music]

man there you go

[Music]

beautiful beautiful and safe but

thank silan I am a

silan

a

cipan with a silip paty

inside don't eat it don't eat

me

there we

go and then after traveling this

far I can feel the tank a

bit

pick

up like

that

weapon someone is looking at

me menacing

me their house has to be peacefully

demolished and the people are peacefully

evicted

going we

go let's see what's on the other side of

these

islands I miss the tree so much of a

target practice

nibl on p

no I'm allergic to

nibbles oh no there's so many mines

here

enem is oh they're shooting at

me okay I just need to break through

this

W so I can get

into I do have to

also oh no out of

amunition cuz there's way too many mines

there and I don't like it there still

too many

Towers I

think I wish I could be bu the

brid now p is just

selling this war like his

car

what do you mean what have I

done sounds like I'm being aused for

something

PE but it was a

peaceful removal of a

building

right

I think it was pretty peacefully

done it was taken down in

pieces there's still too many towers and

there's like

another got so many Towers to take

down pon pon vehicle are peaceful it's

the enemy and turrets that are shooting

first Pon P pun's direction are all in

selfdefense even

though he sometimes shoot

[Applause]

first it was because I was prepared to

be attacked it was still in

selfdefense

untouched pieces

one destroy

everything

a tent has been has fallen

everywhere

anyway oh no flying routing

appar

stay strapped or get CLA have my

War Tian is parked on top of enemy bags

peacefully yeah you know how it

is I'm reading slowly I'm driving at the

same time

[Music]

oh no I'm under

attack every

direction

okay don't like the amount of Mines

here okay here it comes here comes St

fly

well

trying to get around here it's a bit

hard with all these turrets and stuff

and

mines mines

everywhere do you mine oh

no I

wi

let's bring in the

helicopter when it's good that you like

things hard wait

what did I hear you correctly do you as

do you

mind

yes did ask do you

mine

and apparently I like things

hard I'm learning so much myself oh nice

nice yeah if I had tricked that mine

myself that would have caused me some

issues cuz it didn't thatou same

reaction and by myself I mean like using

the

tank

okay

can remove these

buildings see there was no people in

that so it was fine to

remove that wasn't the building

but it had to be

removed okay see no people in that

one the people left so it's

fine time to fly home

I can find

[Music]

[Music]

home I'm not sure what's so funny what

you

mean what's so funny

your P was funny

okay I thought it was

a a weak pun

but if you enjoyed it I'm

happy I am the p p the

b p

p p p the bun

bun because I'm a Bunning making

puns a PNY

bunny punful

punful

p p

p p p

p b b

p I'm confusing

myself I confused myself too

much confused

Pond I'm trying to make sense of

everything okay it should be pretty safe

to go across here cu the mines should be

removed there of course more mines over

here

but the toast mines are over there oh no

they have mined the old PL they looked

at those fuel tank thingies and then

they say

mine okay I'm backing to shot

some not making a good decision

here

okay okay let's see if I can turn around

here where did you st shot stop shooting

you shot your

friend it was a great

decision

okay it's getting destroyed at the

moment I am moving out po check hydrate

okay me correct my position since there

are M here to watch out

for doing

and change the outfit because i s i

because I cleared the um the redeem for

this swimsuit but I never cleared I

never switched

outfit that was a SE mistake bunny telly

time yes it

is bunny

tummy I tried to come up with like a a

rhyme or something like that in Swedish

but that isn't really oh

no I try to shoot something when I don't

have anything to shoot

with you miss me okay I must hurry

here we

go no don't shoot that

thing I sh

sh went on the

way how rude I I did Swedish translation

would be can

Mar p p resar

can so

close oh shoot this one there we go

nice yeah I knew that would

happen

no I shouldn't between two towers

[Music]

sorry don't be between two

towers that would end badly I shoot you

from both Sid can Mar there you go now

you can spell it

[Music]

perfect

H if you fly between two towers you're

going to have a bad time

yep don't get flanked unless you like

[Music]

it

because I like it

hard what is the stream

turning it's not going to get get better

with the 3

model

better more

bent

okay

when apparently the flying ring doesn't

come when I tank building up tank but

they did come at a different

point I'm obviously a bad influence pon

pon humor used to be so clean and

innocent before I started telling my

jokes

see

it's all your fault

rean only your

fault okay I really only needs to

destroy

the

get through

here bit tricky to go through here but I

really only need to destroy Oh shot

at two times not

three there you

go how do you feel corrupting pon pon

oh actually

reach height Max

height okay I need to go

back

I have Ved too

far that already

destroyed wait I can't it there

here there we

go here's much safer

exit let's make a clear exit here for

the Jeep oh okay there much as much I

was able to clean with what I had

left I mean I'm pretty sure I have most

of the bad influence what do you mean

you haven't said anything

bad

it's my fault it's because of me I

say you too

deep probably should have saved some

ammo for

flyinging

yeah luckily there's not playing routin

so it's

fine

did I penetrate the enemy base too

far went too

[Music]

hard there was a lot of red Rockies in

there

though but I did

survive

I did take a lot of damage so now I need

to go have my

rest without protection I think I had a

lot of protection to be

honest also with the penetration from

two places wait

what no I'm not sure what you

mean

okay I just realized there are two two

other places that

are okay I need to take care of those

first just in case guess thing I looked

a bit closer to the map it would be very

very funny if I didn't do

it if I don't do anything about it

so let's do something about

it in this black building specifically

well getting attack from all

sides there's a second one I had to take

[Music]

care

[Music]

those Rockets came from

everywhere

and which color is the helicopters

Rockets oh they're also red okay cuz the

heavy armored vehicle thing has blue

Rockets if your rocket is blue you

[Music]

should

oh here

is there we go mission

[Music]

[Music]

complete

no the Rockets blowing on your face if

your rocket is blow

see

look three blue rockets at the same

time it requires three rockets to take

down a tower

okay let's finish

this hopefully this is the last round

run of this

vehicle so much easier to get around

here with everything

destroyed no worries about running into

walls I can cut through as much as I

want

can be a bit off the

road need the triple penetrate Towers

yep hit them s and they're down and they

fall

moving on like nothing

[Music]

happened

okay

St need to get more intensive as I enter

the

base if only that was a sing it only

gets intensive

because some of the time

elaps hey they're helping me destroying

the

buildings I don't need help with

that I'll do that all over my own

okay let's start destroying these

buildings

in order from distance from the

exit

okay I think I took the wrong way

yep I probably take a tank instead

you know what would be

fun

custume which your armor now you spend

about 15 more minutes

breaking

things yep but H yeah I guess you could

add that to the list of alternative

outfits for pon pon which your

armor can I can make Pon P's hair white

even oh

wait oh now you

come

so many times shooting it One Direction

and the other one I just needed one

shot helicopter girl

Pawn am I a helicopter

girl insert always joke want to see pump

on doing the helicopter I

mean nothing

nothing no hands no one gets to hear the

crude jokes I'm

making

I no I didn't shoot

in I got six shot on

this the tower

here

so many trees in the

way yep no

one well I hope you appreciate my

joke

oh there it is not the best place for it

to be

in come

on what no I can take stupid Treet

oh this is far up in the left corner I

see I see now where it

is

I appreciate all of you every

[Music]

little square

mm of of P pun

PNY you appreciate it you want to touch

it

coming all of pon pon jokes come on 10

more minutes 10 more minutes oh you

keeping

track that's what you

did like 30 more

minutes

[Music]

you think it would take 10 more

minutes and I'll be with this

die probably I have two panas

around sorry panda you're Panda number

two I mean not giv you chance to T

inspection maybe you should

I mean you have the swimsuit I

guess guess that's the closest it gets

there

maybe Sports where I mean does show

some okay I move

here and I move

up and then I basically have to get rid

of you like

that and you oh I'm not going to get

close to you even there we go well I

think that's

enough bunny tummy it's bunny

tummy let's let's try this

out

yeah he just need an hour looking for an

hour I guess we'll

see

rocks in

way if it counts the time in base or

not it's true there we

go so hard to trve this Jeep but there's

a lot of them that ignored

run run run for your

[Music]

life after all it's not how long I

actually spent in game it's how long the

game is set I

[Music]

spent go go

go and then the fin time is like what

did you vote

for Hour 1 Hour 1

hour no yeah fin time is like 0 hours 59

minutes 59

seconds

it's either my wi or

hand how long you take fun I mean I want

to like intentionally try to make some

this is why I don't also don't try to

keep track of the time

myself

okay 59 minutes and 51

seconds it was a

joke but

that's but that's

amazing that's amazing if it just took

eight more seconds that my joke would

have been a reality that was

amazing well congratulations red it

looks like you

won 8 seconds

from Lucky it wasn't 8 more seconds I

would

think

when red is

happy I hope I pick the right one yes

that's the right one I was was nervous

about picking because what if I pick the

wrong

one you got your points

back I mean he got some points back plus

everything

else

I mean yeah you want like some back but

not everything

yeah oh yeah yeah yeah and then I need

to go and save that information

otherwise I cannot start a

next but I can't press save me I should

prepared to open this website I forgot

about

that that's just me being

sing

oh give me up

moment I just need

to I should have such a page no maybe

iion I don't know maybe I like that page

on OBS itself

so here we go pink

K sadly

lost I

think voting pink or red got 110 on it

yeah 10,000

congratulation prian s lost

2,000 lost

1,000

and no other nope

okay let me save this so I don't lose it

just be on the save

side go save over

done come on there we go so and Next

Level I did that one this is the next

level Ring of Fire

so the big question is where do I

start oh yeah there I start this is some

kind of w but actually what kind where's

the flag

buildings I

think cuz this kind of map is different

from the US

map

yes they have

those I would iume like those are the

flag

buildings or

something H

yes there we go hydrate has been

hydrated

wait

well

well we'll see how this

goes exactly there are fly buildings

everywhere oh

my it look like a map that was take away

yeah

it's one of those Maps

maybe man I'm not far from completing

the

game this is going to be

nice it has been a long game taking many

streams to

complete and I'm getting

stuck problem with Towers being passed

like this is that they country attack

them with a

helicopter

anyway have taking quite a lot of damage

oh no they're destroying their own

walls playing around a

Rosie who's Rosy and why would you put

put around ring around

Ros yeah this take a

while I didn't think you get this far

not due to difficulty but just the way

you were leaning up S like you weren't

going to play it more than two

streams yeah I know didn't know how many

levels there were going to be

anyway yeah I really thought it would be

a boring

game I guess it wasn't that

boring cing up so for

here you trying to shoot me so I'm going

to take care of

you this is I'm saying that and another

one tries to shoot

me but I guess we'll have fun

oh full size wall here

nice something that finally sto

me ah it won't stop me because I will

break through anyway break through to

the other

side oh now they're increasing the

density of

TOS okay I can't get through there

anyway because there mining

way okay the tank is about to

explode okay

nice nice

nice ring around the pon pwn

you never heard the song Ring

Around probably heard it I just not that

very familiar with

it like I heard the name of it

but I'm really not familiar with this

song or anything related to

it

not going like a three or four runs

before I reach the first

flank and then I have to reach the next

thing

there we

go

ring this is first

rest

ring a Tiss tissue We All Fall Down what

okay during gross put get full of poses

ashes Ash W fall

down we had the same idea it's a song

about the

plague well I have not experienced the

plague

so have explained that pandemic though

if that

counts

it's turn1 for

me

we like

oops where should I

like be experienced with this song like

where should I

like Panda here they all the panda the

real

Panda I'm on pom pon slap but I I have

controller in my lap turn tiny I hope

you turn tiny

first or maybe you turn small

first and then you turn

tiny turn too small you fall between the

atoms this of course doesn't make sense

if you s made of atoms you know

hey okay almost there because it's a

song you used to teach English and you

learn English in school since then when

it was that song you used to teach

English

well I don't remember

that I'm destroying everything

now no they used teach it in school

which go

my

school I mean I did learn English in

school

but

dang

it there's a game that goes with it

okay since I didn't know this song I

don't know the game

so you you talk about schools like it's

like a global

monolith not every school see every

single oops every single school around

the whole

world well one thing for sure this will

not take 30

minutes

too much B

okay now we got some P Pon T

sign pon pon is not high I assume pon

pon is

finish

some form of white European rabbit

probably

okay okay I'm approaching the flag

definitely

yeah like flag

building

me come on

oh come

on when we

then when when I learn Spanish in school

they also tou songs at games as

age I fig they do the same in other

countes I

mean

probably but that doesn't mean it has to

be spefic specifically that

one I they do the same on yeah we need a

redem for that

show Sweden meat BS the has spoken but

in Sweden Swedish meatball

meatballs

meatballs yeah of course I

mean

yeah and the the what thing you call

Swedish Fish we call past

pish

oh

no SP like it just

went that they got destroyed way too

early

one oh

no how do do

it

okay I'm playing really bad at the

moment that wall of towers really ruin

everything for

me oh no wait I can't reach it no I

should be able to reach it with the

tank no wait no this looks to be

although on the map it was just one

square this looks to be two

squares that's a bit

tricky yeah can't reach

it

sometimes it feel like I can't shoot

it you need artillery party bring out a

children meat

po everything is going on in the chat at

the moment and I'm

confused artillery meat balls and

smacking tables

and X for Z flying interesting to be no

I don't think

[Music]

so

[Music]

here we

[Music]

go

for

[Music]

there you

[Music]

go

when I guess this could have gone better

but

[Music]

y the wall of towers is almost

gone

almost falling

on like one Tower left

[Music]

here

[Music]

so can I please fully fly over to that

place now without being constantly

attack my R

tows maybe we'll

see

no apparently not

whoop go go go go fly over the big

water the Big

Lagoon hopefully it doesn't take off

the F to each

Here and Now where's the flag

building oh there it

is no no I on that was a

fiasco okay I'm not sure if I can do

this

oh

well guess it had to take a long and

boring way

then it's cleaning out some Forest

seconding

I do much

easier

one

one yeah it would this will be one of

those long Maps take two

hours

I try all the techniques but they

Fain

spect I there are a few Minds here but I

guess they

fine

remember the

Stree

one

one

got all that cleared

off oh such a long way to the next flag

oh

my

do I even have enough fuel to do this

because I don't have anything to refuel

no should have paid

attention

ah there going to be a game over I need

a new plan

I didn't see mine nope that TR sneak up

on

you

[Music]

yeah there wasn't that one I wanted to

Sho

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

de

[Music]

um not happy about

that at least he much safer

now so no more predictions are allowed

to put in be put in

is

for

te

right and then there's a mine up here

and another mine

going of want to go around like half the

not even half the second before I run

out of

field so I'm pretty sure this a game I'm

not even sure am I supposed to do this

because I don't have enough fuel to get

around the whole

circle because going that far down and

then going up all the all the way is

taking up almost all of the

fuel I don't think this is

possible and I'm not exactly sure I'm

supposed to do this level cuz I barely

get one can get like all the way down to

the corner and that's basically half the

fuel

[Music]

just more of this was cleared off

that right

there

come on one

more

de

[Music]

I guess I need to bring out the

helicopter

and clear up the

garbage

okay would be nice if K didn't keep

missing the

[Music]

targets

[Music]

there you

go

[Music]

[Music]

there go hands in

mine

way too much

garbage

clean up so much

[Music]

garbage not a country F if they like

mini bases that flag like

ref

[Music]

feeling and may

me

the map I have least facing myself for

completing

[Music]

[Music]

very first

helicopter

no I want to destroy

that

oh

I missed it I miss that one too miss

that

one

anyway actually make it safer for the

tank to get through very clear off at

the

moment

just moving south in a straight

line water anyway I guess I go a bit

diagonal

now

[Music]

guess it doesn't cost too much fuel to

go down here but it still cost a

lot

another

flank

got to keep an eye on the house

too

all right out the

[Music]

better it's an exciting my

friend I'm going to fous

[Music]

map yeah and definit I I just don't have

enough fuel to

make barely have enough fuel to make it

to the second flag

proving to be a

challenge to be possible if

something cuz I'm I'm so confused at the

moment like did I mean to put like

places to fuel up the tank or something

how am I supposed to do this am I

supposed to only use the helicopter on

this

map

okay you cre

to

flag was in

there I mean the only

chance I have is in if the FL is in this

building

here H otherwise I don't I don't really

see

I'm really clearing out the way for me

to go through here as e

this

nope where that that's not how this game

[Music]

works come the confused one yeah I'm

very

confused on whenever this game been

to whenever had this game been too

measured on map planning

what I'm actually not sure what you

mean

yeah I'm

not I'm not sure if they even consider

this map and the question I'm often

asking myself today play test the

game

[Music]

in this context POS Game maps where

there is one answer would be very

Meed

okay and they haven't done much

measuring meaning that they might not be

like there are multile aners which of

course is a type of what I do

we all know that c RAC was fully tested

and balanced it probably was just that

the developers were really good at the

game I mean c Rising was actually quite

polished game I must I think I don't

think it had

like it have like was so long time ago I

played

it I think it run smooth and like that

probably I had bit of physics quirks

here and there but it wasn't

like it wasn't anything I would like

when I'm playing out don't maybe it was

just for getting it and not like in

Spire where you have actual bugs and

glitches and

stuff

I

where are you there you

are

I

[Music]

d

the answer over we're not having

hands I mean I still determined to

complete this game but some

maps just look at how much fuel I have

left when I come back it was a place to

fill up with fuel and this would this

would be

different but there isn't so

consider how much fuel I had left I

would consider this to be as far as I

can make it but I guess I'll just push

further and further until I run after

the

fuel and then I only have the helicopter

left as an attacking

vehicle and that's and then after that I

guess I just have to use the

Jeeps and get the first genuine game

away

did anyone vote for game

over otherwise you won't get your points

back there are some streamers you like

oh no one picked an answer that the

winning answer oh well all points are

gone and I explain how I don't like that

but everyone has their choice to run

each unless they want no what for game

over oh

all points are

returning I do not see how I will be

able to do

this

no

no

one I'm going for 2 hours only yeah if I

if I fail this map I will play another

map though will not ret trade this map

map this time I will do it in the future

but maybe next stream but so next

week I will not do this map

today I M too close to that mine I saw

it but I m too close to it well I guess

I didn't have problem with running out

the fuel at

least when I run run M just need to

remove the

min

can also move back to

playing

racing but of course now

I'm very

no not shot that a single

time there's a mine

right there too not that I would run

into that one but you

know it's

[Music]

mine

[Music]

I'm allergic to mines I take damage by

touching

[Music]

them someone claim that's not that's not

an

allergy all

right what do they

know

okay I do want to remove you

there

[Music]

you

FR I'm going R out of

fuel

Maybe

very

close there we

go sounds like an to me exactly exactly

exactly do you know

it oh wait it's a tank

time t t t

t

there can go so as straight as I

can but of course it's good to know if

it is

H distance or time that consumes

fuel I mean assuming you're moving if

you're standing still I don't think it

consumes any

fuel

but as long as you move is it this

distance or time that that is it's

moving quicker does it consume more fuel

since you can move quicker on roads

and you move quicker

on Sand or dirt rather than

oh of course they put mines everywhere

like oh nice find their base

nope they have put mines on the that

thing oh actually I placed the

refu this might not

be as impossible I think which M everywh

now yeah and here comes the death

thing

okay

sorry it isoss but it's going to

be this map is going to stay

forever

[Music]

but ni is assuming I can't even reach

home from now

otherwise that was for

nothing

doesn't feel like I'm going to be able

to reach home I could have play but but

like such a place like

halfway like they did put like halfway

when the FI runs out

but so you can reach it but you cannot

then get home you have to refuel it but

I couldn't refuel because there was

Tower in the

way yeah I think this would be a game I

have to strud days in a different

way I think not losing every heavy vle

would be a good

[Music]

idea okay actually managed to bring it

home yay

you made it back

yep

[Music]

[Music]

okay let's take care of some

business let's take

care

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I

no manag to get away from

that that was cl bro yeah yeah loose

everything one helicop got one tank

that's all I

here lucky the fire at they fire at

where are and not at where you will be

yeah that can still be like

that sometimes they do fire where I am

not and where I w't be because

they they have a bit delay before they

shoot like their aiming is a bit

delayed

but it's still tired to shoot so they

shoot at the wrong

things we call that leading your

target

it should

be no I don't trust

it I don't trash you

guys can you get believe

that

look no

flag

what yeah and but

said PR of

course let's clear off this

area

so I can

run I don't need

more

I can't believe you didn't trust those

Towers they look trustworthy to

me oh no flag no flag hi

hello BEP peaceful tank hold your

fire hello hello putu girl what are you

up to

[Music]

PE PE peaceful

P PP the

baby

all yeah that's my nickname I'm

PP no PP

what why no PE

PE what's wrong with

peee oh

Mya so

far come S no peaceful pun

yeah PP stand for peaceful Pawn although

I pwn pwn not Pawn that would be

PP peaceful pon

pon peace was never an

option p is always an

option yeah I wish they would offer

peace and let me just Pi up their flag

and go home with it but

nope guess PE wasn't an option pon pon

P yes P the the initials for pon pon

would be PP that is true red you read it

correctly or heard it correctly I

mean but that wouldn't be fun that would

be a pun on your

name e

see using PP for pon pon is funny

because pon pon

um no I'm not going to get

that

[Music]

what going to be

nothing nothing you have to worry

about no don't worry about it forget

that I even was going to make a

joke

plus the work wouldn't even work the

joke

wouldn't

nothing

okay it was a joke about me being a

trans woman but it wouldn't work because

pon pon is not a the trans woman so you

see it's kind of kind of doesn't

work are you at trans

man what didn't you tell

me

that's news to

me never mind

there I mean I do have enough fuel to

get home but you know

I I have to the comments

now tell us the joke pon pon no can I

can of explain it to you now so mhm

SM and blushing someone's sming at pun

pun and P pun is

[Music]

blushing Yep this is the

L this is a L the

design p is beautiful K pie of a hot

bun but not so much about

emn I mean if you want the hot P Pon

Pond this

prob

name I mean come

far let's some more

mines cuz you know me I would just run

into a mine otherwise

nice

[Music]

Miss

okay the mine there but that's there's

no problem got the mine up here maybe I

can't touch

[Music]

it

I think I can explore that mine but know

I'm not going to risk

[Music]

[Music]

it h

okay I think this helicopter is dead by

the way I can of got but I need to fly

home

okay que

mittens one we a hot dog custom would be

called a hot

P yeah I thought the joke was going to

be in but if pon pon wears a hot dog

costume because pon pon is a hot dog but

you know pon pon is not a

dog hello I'm on lunch break now hello P

hola fly home

helic

success the helicopter came

home with little fan

P I hope everyone is doing

okay

contining this is my stream

now should a hel Chopper have been met

with disappointment instead no because

the helicopter came home and actually

did something good the helicopter was

not a disappointment

I really wish I had the munition

depot better

win

nice

I going to see the tower should be over

here

oh this is a almost feels like a whole

base kind of because I attacking these

walls from side at the

moment

so

it's time to move back

home

again

[Music]

and also if I said

that the helicopter helicopter came home

with little

fan replacing the little Fanfare with uh

a disappointment is not going to make it

[Music]

better I really wish the next flag

building has to

flag I'm not too far from completing the

level

but might just be a toour level

if they if they only had like a place

where you could

repair the

vehicle F so you can repair it fill it

up with ammo fill it up with fuel and

then it's like brand new

him very dramatic music I'm only on my

way

[Music]

home

one two three four places left if only

there was a p to

col yeah I agree with

you the fun quick Kickstarter of

producing pon pon

plushes

on the minimum amount to get a Pon pom

tashy found uh a bit more to get a Pon

pom tashy together with an evil pon

pon with inter changeable clothing so we

can switch the clothes

[Music]

around not the one plusy but I have a

kangaroo plusy with me right now oh evil

F

plushy did

I forget tank to

tank

did I forget what the tank place

was no it was

here felt strange like

H didn't feel like didn't feel like I

went past

it yeah I confused that flag building

with another the next flag

building again can you

like

thank

you no

flying it's

back four more flying

buildings

any more flag buildings and look the

flag building not contain

flag a

Shocky now where did you come

from I'm busy attacking

Towers don't you see

that oh thank you tower for helping me

take down the

tower

okay this one oh

no oh

no okay I need to be careful

here here we

go

and I shouldn't need to fill the tank by

much I should do a very quick small tank

tanking of the

Tank tank the tank tank tank

tank m is

Ling that's more than

half

feeling tanks tank

okay

that should be

left I didn't mean to go back and kill

it all the way I only said this for the

Rundy

okay she made me unsure if I had filled

it with enough I went

back and also you

[Music]

that

of course when I speak Swedish on stream

I'm speaking I'm trying to speak a bit

clearly and then what I normally speak

Swedish and I wouldn't say I wouldn't

use the word as for the Existence I

would say FS

instead

because Finn fins would

be

um it's the passive form of finina to to

be uh to be found no flag could be found

here but you said the fin in flag

here no flag can be found here guess

that is

yeah that there or something the is more

like

the the ex uh B existing or something be

found h no flag

here there exist no flag

here something like that in

English literally translated I think

that comes up more as natural

Swedish

course it's important to know that I'm

no

English English I'm no teacher so but I

would I think I would say theing

and that is

great

[Music]

me there we go

that one has been taken care

of

oh

text yeah read it in the back

home that's when I usually read the

comments okay this one

is making me a bit

scan

oh no oh

no oh no no why am I getting

stuck oh and that was the last

tank

I kept getting stuck on the same

thing I

wi last

[Music]

res

[Music]

kind like if you want to say something

is here

say to yes but you want to say something

isn't here you say n to

[Music]

take

[Music]

I think there's some context to that

whole

[Music]

thing because I think you would say

doesn't exist if

like

if you're looking for something and like

you

should like if you go to the

the I mean if you go to the store and

ask they probably say that they don't

have it more than it doesn't

exist but there's probably some Nuance

to what to the difference between saying

it doesn't exist compared to saying or

like it doesn't exist here here compared

to it isn't

here because I

can H think

of yeah too too tricky to explain I

wouldn't be able to explain the

difference which here doesn't have

something whis tle for

WTF the when here I'm

sorry I'm sorry for failing the

mission okay I find this Mission

here I

wi oh yeah I

need

the helicopter got

stuck well have flag build in there

let's go to

it excuse me why why this m this

disappointment what have I

done don't know they're looking at

me okay I can't go can I how far up can

I go before it's Street

HD oh

no but I'm we

moving

I moving to water what what problem do

you have with that maybe Trigg this I

didn't think it would trigger I did when

count is out of bounds but they don't

send it those when I go out to BS with a

helicopter the helicopter has a specific

trigger Stone when it when it goes

into the the special thing which I've

never shown on stream oh got to got far

off the map

and

yeah

exactly okay that doesn't

work one with flying R things oh no sad

funny flapping the

ears okay I'll go the other way

then how take the normal

way oh no funny flapping ear is

dead how is this he so slow I thought it

would be much quicker than

this it's pamon

again it's own white

funny flapping

ears funny Pon has such big ears yeah

yeah that was the

idea when you when I modifi the

animations for pon pon when replacing

Spyro I want the flapping of the ear

should be the animation when she

playes

basically the ears will move when Spyro

flaps his

wings is the

idea camer zooms out so far as

here the engine noise becomes

quy run car

no

well that was the last je last vehicle

as came

over going towards the Charlie Fox start

the CF what no game over screen it just

boots back to the

well looks like option game over one

which was no one so all points goes

back refund time okay instead of that

map I'll go I got your flag right

here this looks like an interesting map

isn't

it I mean I still have like 50 minutes

of

the of the stream but I can go

further I hav't have problem with

that let me just

[Music]

check H message I got when you check

yeah the starting point which I guess

could be interesting is there if it's

not

obvious and the flag I assume that's the

flag but if there's any Flags here or

Flags probably not here but I mean you

never know we never know when it comes

to these

Maps

you never

know so was there anything other the

server going

on

yeah I will answer the message that was

WR on the surve in B fullness when I get

to that should

I um now I check

messages maybe I should I don't know how

long this map will take maybe I should

feel up

more

okay thank you for stopping by you can

always to me whenever you

want I F into a burning Ring of Fire

I fell down down down and the Flames

went higher wait went

higher what kind of spelling is thisan

and It Burns Burns

Burns of fire teing a fire I got to go

back to work now I had fun watching the

stream I hope you had a good rest love

when last last map wasn't

great it was

fine

it was fine it was

fun so let me adjust

myself

okay so it's been

there my phone which spelling to use

because I was busy

picking right here

yeah are you ready please have everyone

put in their so

far there we

go we got three things

inserted

p face on P arm

don't forget you have

sport oh Spong my is now that's let

go

okay

attacking oh

no

it was it was lagging

for why is it lagging all a

sudden

okay

yeah okay you know I need

to I press the wrong

s annoying annoying his soft buny tummy

yes why is it

lagging it has no need need

in recent

lag okay and something was up with

Discord it was making everything lag I

close Discord I will open it after the

stream now it run

smoothly so

basically what I have to

do

oh not

that that's

not this is a bit

tricky

no why does it turn into

like I got a lot of jeeps

St but it's very hard to

control I must

say that died quickly

very lagging yeah hope yeah it it was 20

frames 20 frames that dropped before now

it say 628 all of a sudden from out of

nothing and all I did

was no can I stop running into

stuff oh there was be so much easier if

the keep just

sto doing what I didn't just tell tell

it to

do

it's so much

easier yeah just go straight into the

tank cuz that's exactly where I want to

go this is

annoying I thought this would be an

interesting challenge means that it

became an annoying

challenge yeah it just goes straight

into it and it stops obviously it stops

because it ran into the thing I didn't

decide for it to go

there how about you

turn well this be a game over because I

mean he's not he's not doing what I

wanted to do

that works I

guess okay this time we did

not do what I wanted to to

do is it lag holding the button down

there is no

lag

not I'm not sure what you mean by lag

there is no

lag I mean there was lag before but I

just started the level and there is no

lag

anymore

oh had an nice run but no it had to turn

straight into the

tank put game game as no option well I

guess I least restarted as

this

game everything went fine until it

decided that it should just run in

straight into the tank don't know why it

does

that everything go fine and

just just that

I'm

course no one's going to win the

prediction

[Music]

anyway

when it

last I mean I guess that's more

helpful isn't it's not part of the 11

what what you talking about you you're

confusing

me you're making me very confused at the

moment I have no idea what you're

talking

about I cannot answer your questions

because

yeah I don't know what you're talking

about yep the GPS Stu and got stuck

that's the controls are doing whatever

they doing no the Jeep is always doing

what it's

doing and it

is it is great that you like hit three

minutes after I mention that is doing

whatever it's doing you ask a question

about that 3 minutes

later like like it's as if I was to

remember

that how did that not hit the

hospital I'm not complain I'm just

observing it's a chat delay must be

quite a massive delay

then

nope

there we

go

hey at least in destroy the

to 15 second delay still felt like I I

mentioned it like 3 minutes ago

and runs into that hospital and I tried

to turn but it doesn't

help well I guess time to try

again

it does not count total time

so this will not take an hour to

complete yeah just just move up there

stay there don't like turn straight into

the tower don't follow the Road or

[Music]

anything that makes the most

sense no mines

nice yes

no refreshing doesn't help no

oh

where did that shoot where I was

going

no move to the

side was trying to move to the side but

he decided to turn

back turning right but it was turning

left

not shoot each other that sounds like a

good

idea there we

go

yeah I mean at Le I drive faster than it

until I get stuck at the building of

course one more week and I'm in vacation

I'm on

vacation SS

nice

very

nice where's the flag it's

there why did that building blow up so

quickly

away yeah exactly what I

want right so it's up Turn Turn not turn

turn

turn but don't turn like

that the level is already harder than it

is

but does not help that he he just a

terrible vehicle to control

for

no

mine's I said that two chaps ago

well I can't help

it oh the Deep wasn't that deep p

know deep wasn't die I just couldn't see

the Jeep did

everything I got out of

that

amazing

no I turn turn left and then it turns

right into the mine again cuz why

not okay don't do wrong way there okay

now it's

c

I know a tent has fallen over

no I didn't press that way I pressed

forward now the egypti something just

turns very hard level when

it keep is doing this

stuff no I don't need SP about that time

at

least

why was it so quick at shooting at that

location

oh yeah on the last deep no problem I

get through

everything of

course

there uh Amo dep up

there like a reasonable thing to

have

how about attacking this thing that's

right in front of you or next to

you

okay

when of

course well at least that's not a

problem

anymore over there yeah was m

h

ha no

did so

well yeah

when you go full this game has the exact

same issue

that

H that Crush B could have

and think Spyro basically everyone like

developer doesn't know how physics

works or like momentum if you go full

speed into something and you crash into

it until you

stop the momentum you had going full

speed into the sink should over you

shouldn't you shouldn't still have the

momentum going

forward 207 rabit not to drive exactly I

can't drive I can't drive with a jeep

that like chooses its own path and

drives into stuff

and and

uh

yeah

have the reverse momentum that no longer

exist once you hit up

exactly a lot of game has that is

year a surprising amount of

games it's

like

I guess the developer are so good at it

so they never run into anything when

they have high amount of

M or they

not smart enough to understand what's

going on in the

game I don't know if feel so weird like

if the object stands

still have like a have like a thing like

if if the object you controlling

whatever that has the momentum

everything if the object stand still

remove all

momentum that should be easy to

end K bu welcome if tell I'm n I'm just

struggling with this level for a

moment hello hello how did you find

me I'm just

curious

thank you for

following now you have 32 points you was

recommended te

TCH yeah it seems like

there are few find me that

way it's nice to

be recommended by

twitch and

yeah I found a few streamers that

way nice to make so many friends

okay you are friendly

right yeah that's exactly where I wanted

throw

it

what I'm not going to be friendly with

this

game

thank specifically when it comes to

Jeeps they see the tower seems to be

very precise with their

aiming and can like anticipate where I

where I'm going to be I mean unless you

know the G decides to turn and run into

something and get

stuck and I'm not the I'm not the person

who blames the games for my

mistake

um I've not done that basically

throughout most of the game play of this

game if if I make a mistake I when I

claim it that that I made a one a

mistake but but not this

level the way the Jeep turns is not

under my control I can turn one way and

it starts turning that way but if I stop

turning it starts turning the other

way and

like and it makes this level very

annoying to

complete yeah we are discussing the

physics of game like this one which

characters of vehle Som maintain the of

the H com stop and it's so common in

games as well so I mean it should be

like one of those checklist if you have

a momentum based physics in your

game the momentum should be removed if

if they seeing that had the momentum

stops it should be

like a thinging if should

check

so to reverse you have to reverse the

amount of the vehicle had before being

stopped basically have to break that

break the

vehicle and reduce even though the

vehicle technically standing still you

still have to reduce the vehicle

speed down to zero before you can start

reversing which of course makes no

sense because the vehicle is at this

moment standing

still I the momentum that should no

longer

exist and that's when you get an effect

of uh why is the character not doing

anything in some

games

why is nothing happening when I press

the button something's happening but

can't why are they so good at

aiming like

I I have have terrible name this whole

time but sometimes

oh R st the

internet

okay how am I supposed to go through

here here then I should

go there we

go of course then I have

to

somehow whoa that was

close

then I just need to find their way

back

no don't get

stuck don't get

stuck okay s move up to

the buildings oh there it

is oh that was close oh that was

[Music]

close

well behind the

hospital not a good place would have FL

to

be

the camera is not doing

too great of a job show me what's going

on anyway I got who almost Dr into that

time

finally after many many

attempts do you like Snuggles SP Pon I

do like to snuggle how snuggle

it's not doesn't

yeah Hallelujah Hallelujah p o n so only

4 minutes 49 seconds and no one voted

for that no one would expect that the FL

the map to be like

this it is however

like 23 minutes past my usual streaming

time I usually stream 3

hours

uh

so I just yeah no one voted for that all

all P points are returned so tomorrow I

get I have this

level yeah this level and this level

left I'll give this one a new try and

then I will also do that

level probably before but that's for

next

week

so

sadly that wasn't a f like a winner of

that prediction

what is playing Spiderman maybe that's

not a good but maybe that's not a bad um

R

it spind the

man well normally you would say it in

definite

form

H I got patreon Discord

YouTube yeah I think it's been a

while otherwise this is R the

fox

no you I'm not but Panda was here before

I guess he was here lurking wrote one

message yeah yeah he said he was playing

Spider-Man which I assume was video game

I didn't I didn't think he was actually

streaming at the same time been the man

there yeah that's how how this switch

name would be

let's start the right message I hope

you're back okay like

this or actually got no Cur on the

screen anyway so for sat Sunday I'm

going to be busy I'm not I'm I'm going

to not do the

stream but I'm back on Monday Tuesday to

finish crash 3 doing my if I die I'm not

allowed to pick up any Gems or crystals

so I have to B basically complete the

level without dying not exactly true

because as long as I pick up the gem

before I die I can die after that but um

yeah I need to reach every gem that I

can without dying first so anyway that's

part of the self-impose challenge if you

like to watch that you got the time on

screen and then they start fire the next

week I'll continue to I'm going to

return to return fire there go that's a

joke so is how I usually do the pon pon

mod for crash for but not this weekend

as said going I have stuff I need to

work on

so

H at

home that I cannot spend like 6 hours of

day

streaming H so

yeah hope hope hope people understand

hope folk

understand s

for f

anyway thank you everyone for being

here thank you thank you hope we come

back for future

[Music]

streams
