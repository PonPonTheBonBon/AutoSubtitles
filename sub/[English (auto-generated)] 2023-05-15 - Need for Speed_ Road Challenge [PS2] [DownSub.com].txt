hello everyone sorry I'm late with

less than a minute

I release us how it's going to get

in timeless

this time

oh something is wrong with my internet

at the moment

it does not like

rabbit stampede

uh this isn't great it's

I hope I was a high stabilistic this

stream

yes this one says it's not very stable

that's not great

I can try watching here and see how

it seems stable so that's good

so as long as it's watchable

okay

yes sometimes it drops down and I don't

know why

so

it's coming to the final mind yeah

that's

that's what's important

so let's

now the onion is back

and you can't control too many with the

controller because I would eat let's

continue the carry of fun pun

picking racy race car driving anyway

all right

and I got my drink

here we go

them

no don't look at that

so we're currently on the

beef

what did they call it tear

or

whatever

so the this challenge

wait it requires the new

oh no

well in this case

apparently need to buy a new car

and pick a BMW

Ferrari 550

or

shed 911.

choices choices

no

I really need to go buy those

well I guess the choice

I I still know what

as you don't want to ask you because

it's fun

it was

who knows

yeah that's not I counted for that one

anyway but that's an unlockable car

you get through the carrier

so it's a bit I can't filter them out

the the BMW has the highest acceleration

Ferrari has the highest top speed

the Porsche has the best handling

the best breaking

so there you go

but yeah I want to see the full space

tracker uh

you want

I mean

is these two seems to be those two you

would

yeah this one a better exploration and

this one has a high top speed but I'm

yeah keeping a top speed is hard

by having a breaking

they make up like compare

two of them three of them at the same

time

so

I guess this is the best I can do

all right that's a short trip

I didn't I didn't know that once again I

was going to be I thought I was was

going to be the next thing

well the time is up

have you selected

to move these two side

wasn't really going to show me

uh it didn't show it because now I voted

I was

right there

I'm gonna departure might actually be

easier to for me to control it even

though it has the worst exploration of

them

maybe it should be between these two

I've only got one more [ __ ] only you

here happens according to Twitch so you

it's your choice

breakfast music

I said it is like streamers see

3 500 but he's trying to stream at 5 000

for some reason

I don't know what it is doing

I changed this during the Stream

or is it because it's

I don't know

it's my current but I can't use my

current car anyway

but I don't even know what I had but one

thing

because that's the thing

and I need to buy the next a class up

yeah there was once I could purchase and

then I want to Jaguar

I mean yeah there I got all these guys

are going to be better

okay

sure why not I can do that

if it's because I want to make it more

interested interesting for

what are you watching

should I make it

like

price typically red

so what what about making it very

very reddish Peach

like that

yeah that's not as strong

not as I heard anything they think

[Music]

yeah I'm gonna

there we go that that's much more let's

let's get that

racing pink yeah

[Music]

only 1.1 million sure

[Music]

all my money

um

hurricane time to do this race

and hopefully I don't lose the first

thing I did

that would be awful

[Music]

entry fee one car

I did click oh it was just very slow

[Music]

I know it's slippery can we do racing

the other day one go

the controller isn't working

because I didn't

allow it to work

um

and what happened

give my moment

it didn't like that I launched the

controller

oh yeah and I also need to change it

back to

dark mode

there we go

let's relaunch the game

it's really not the game I said there

you go

using uh

thing

which allows me to play it in the window

of the mode

now it doesn't count as a forfeit

but it did count it as started race

Rocky pass

[Music]

three two

and because I started doing race or

something

without the

you know what

I want

the button

there we go that's what I'm looking for

why is it going to be so annoying

thank you it doesn't tell you which it

is

and

don't even use anything else here

look behind

no no not that one

No it should be reset that get used to

we could set the lights too

otherwise I don't think I use

use anything else

okay I don't use that pump

and it's proper braking

air force feedback

is buggy in the game for some reason

like

and then I just put it right it's not

fun when it resets everything isn't it

it's one of the other vaccines yeah this

one

this night

okay now let's go

it doesn't work

because it didn't press counseling

and then I need to take this

this is

I love it when streams go exactly as

planned

what was it did it uh did it reject it

because I didn't

have said everything okay

or your camera view

okay I'll set any button then

everything except now I think that's all

I need

this this is it remember

in that case I need to set this quite

High

it doesn't trigger

unless I intentionally triggered

in that cheesecake did it

the names of these are set to the Xbox

controller anyway that should do it

okay one more try Siri

here we go now it works

[ __ ] that's like more at attempts

than I intended

and let me let's

yes

keep up with the car

[Music]

and see how it goes

nice all right suspense nothing

[Music]

I like it

right corner

oh it's not English no he doesn't have

any microphones

he lost all cars

[Music]

that's right around yeah this is when

you're great

[Music]

it's wow it's definitely not so good

[Music]

that's cracking

[Music]

more of this

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

again like last night

[Music]

and if I do lose this race

train the next option to either

retry the race

by cheating and before I accept the loss

and then have to just reduce some races

and then buy a long time

[Music]

thank you

I mean let's reset the game before

they're fine because

they think so okay

yeah I'm not going through this

that's not a problem

apparently

Apparently after 14. I really have to

abort the whole process

sure

I'm just gonna do this again

I don't know why the hell

[Music]

why is it force feedback so bugging

anything if I said to the zero

okay no no it's been doing this

but that is

that's the wrong one again because I'm

stupid because I'm being distracted by

this stuff

and then if I set it to Max

yeah I don't know why first window is

broken

am I disabled force feedback

and of course there's no option disable

force feedback

there are different circuits as new

controls come on nice I love being buggy

okay for some reason for some reason

sometimes he just doesn't want to read

the

another country

and now that that's it I cannot

okay

[Music]

now

and this time it did not read the button

now everything is set

accepted that sound

[Music]

which

are perfect

that's everything

actually

and she says one more

because I set them to five that's four

um

take it

and start gaming

options

controllers and everything but

everything is still there good

[Music]

good

nah let's do it again

let's do it again let me take control on

this property set

hi

[Music]

other the present problems

that's probably what I should have done

now

[Music]

yep yeah I'm not going to win this news

no I think the only thing I have is fine

try to bump the guy in the beginning

yeah

[Music]

I guess so

I might be better

yeah I've lost this race

I don't know I can just quit this

software whenever I want

I need to do that

this is your safety control system

I don't think I can upgrade the car

since I started the race

give me a cat

foreign

so this will improve the handling

this one for the top speed which I don't

need really and this one so I assume it

presumably it is 11 3.

which costs 200 000 and I have seen

something but I'm doing it which is

quality which I'm not going to

but it's not a total because I can't

just stick level C and see the total

cost see I had to accuse one at a time

but I guess I need to do that to win the

race to at least do something to every

device for that one thing yeah okay it's

kind of the cheating way of doing it

turning off the game without exiting

properly

um

well I guess this is my only chance of

winning the race all right moves on

automatically nice

can I not I don't have enough of this

but what I can do is that

should be able to do

exactly I can do a different race a

different tour but again I can go back

to this one and then go for

which which of these did this this topic

one

so basically yeah so I can

go for this gold which is hundred

thousand

minus damages

and then

[Music]

I'll earn enough money to forget the

final update of the car

let's go

let's see if we can win the code now

first this will be like a warm-up as

well

and not only I put the window over here

definitely see the stats well well

you've come to your scene okay no this

is Class B

and also I don't think I can use my car

[Music]

I don't think I can use the car because

I have connected it to the other race

which is I accidentally but for somebody

second then even though it's active like

I'm still going to a different race

it doesn't make much sense but

yeah this is your own little B cars

but yeah this is much easier now that

another time we've got someone used to

the game and

obviously using an upgraded card

and that certainly helps

I guess the difference between asking it

kind of because I did win this car by

using my non-up credit card

but

um

yeah they

the difference between currencies and

third grade and soon

yeah just that yeah all the tracks the

other race is raining and that makes

your car worse but not the performance

because that's that's how rains works

[Music]

is that card running for us

oh yeah this dress is foreign

but I only I don't need to do all Races

I only need to do enough traces that I

can forfeit the rest and still get first

things

[Music]

if I do get enough

in first places

that should be enough to

I don't remember how many races it was

the four last breaths

this should be shorter tracks though

that should be fine

four Laps on this track should be like

do you Laps on their Lucky Pass track

maybe text figure in chess for myself

that's a easy reason it's not too easy

when you want that red car

was the same model as your other car but

it's better stats yeah because it's

upgraded

[Music]

and I managed to win that forget the car

by using another navigation

let's say the difference isn't that

great I guess on his Lower Class Cars

but the difference might be higher on

higher class cars

[Music]

[Music]

so for a second I have the lead on it

like three seconds

for that screen

[Music]

this time

[Music]

[Music]

and I don't have to overtake any

concepts there you go

[Music]

that's your best lap lap three oh thank

you

there's a slight damage to the

suspension so far

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

maybe it's just that

in the nights

blind spot

[Music]

s

that was a white corner

I guess I'll see if I can overtake this

car

in the tunnel again

[Music]

[Music]

there you go

It's the final lap

it is different

and I hope I win

oh wait is it is that

UK track part of this I wasn't expecting

enough he is an inland track

step two you can track

one of them is fine but the other one is

very annoying

okay

[Music]

so where is everyone anyway

I don't know

right kitten is if you refer to all day

people comment me yeah kitten is um

busy during the start of the stream at

least

but we'll be here later

and everyone else I don't know

I mean a little fusially

shows up in the middle of streams

yeah I've been watching people play

Tears after King yeah I believe that

might be the case or they're busy

playing it themselves and because yeah

I have noticed that it's been a I

haven't really had Backpage viewing

numbers but there has been like 46 750

at some point but now it's barely above

three people

so it is not a huge difference in

absolute numbers but it's been dropped

by half or so so

yeah I have to pay attention

[Music]

everyone well I'm getting that game

eventually

there we go that applies whoa

and then I need to that crusty

right on it

it's on a fortnight for some

for some reason I thought it was about

six or something

well in that case no problem

yeah I have considered playing like

this

wasn't as high as up for it as I usually

end up with him since

yeah I think I'm not at all into Zelda

but I think the biggest

the only thing

it's not to say too much about the game

because I but I don't know anyways I

wouldn't really be able to

but I wouldn't be able to tell myself

maybe I shouldn't say anything

I don't know anything about the story or

in the world or anything so

back in Italian tell anything about that

anyway

oh no damage since the car somehow

but I'm still I'm avoiding anything to

do with it because I want to start

absolutely no knowledge or something

I hope I heard that correctly

but yeah exactly

avoiding

everything about that's what I feel

about

like

I've tried to do as well not about that

thing specifically

but okay I'm

it's more like I haven't been avoiding

that game to

to avoid the game people like I'm not

really interested

in the games I think I don't know

usually

I do try to watch for this streaming

step up the game

but it is more fun if I'm familiar with

being too

ah what's going there

I should

stop you cannot see my car

not because I run into the wall that

wasn't what damaged my car anyway

and so I want to slap too

I probably need to play more games so I

can

watch other people play those games

which I haven't played yet

they'll probably have to play Zelda

Pokemon

[Music]

then I probably need a

witch a subscription I bet it's capture

cards because the one I have is is

sufficient to play like PlayStation 2

games

but even PlayStation 2 games looks

pretty bad

but it works

but I obviously don't have the money for

none of that

I have to have this sandwich

which is why I play a lot of balls there

games

they're very specific games

bus Club

they share like two decimal places on

those numbers and then as you directly

through the dust cloud it adds

like one

20 I just think of what he was counting

this present next versus model with f

whatever from April Mill in Finnish

they have per 10

000

looking up as you're driving through the

dust cloud it barely doesn't damage the

car but

I don't know what it reflect drops in

that Forest

[Music]

spider runs better on this game

although I could play like crash or

something

maybe I should do that after all this

but her kids

welcome afternoon

race

ooh

Yep this Valley has found a car

and another Amtrak and a lot of other

races

and I'm in the first position for now

that can change

heat pump

I try to be cute I hope my family is

I can't see this stream stream

under the Bunny with the cover in this

pedometer

because I haven't looked at what this

streaming screen looks like while I'm

playing the game

thank you

the

easiest with having one screen

because I'm

here's a secret everything that shows up

on the screen I don't see that while I'm

playing the game

because I'm actually viewing the actual

game screen to

yeah I would assume there's a delay

my best idea plus if I don't have the

game scheme actually there's no sound

from the game for some reason and I

don't think it will take my inputs

either that matter

so even if I wanted to play through the

streaming View

it wouldn't work

I would need a second screen to see

what's going on on the screen

anyway

when I'm playing out of my PlayStation 3

in that case I can use what it looks

like on the computer

oh hi

so when the cast away the house will

play oh yeah

remove it

I think something I think

like and it gets away

I miss the the mice dancing people

this team is coming to you just fine

that's that's the most important and you

will

you must be able to see all these frames

dropping when I drive through the forest

and yeah some personally sometimes it's

very smooth but sometimes it

dropping the things

it's not the streaming service thing

like it's just a killing thing so

unsurprisingly because it's like from

somewhere around 2000 I think playing on

a Windows 10 computer and it's not

optimized so

it's obviously not doing a multi-cores

Threading

okay but they're knocking right although

it is running DirectX nine so that's

something

oh dang I forgot every sign hit means I

take a shot of vodka oh yeah you want to

signs have it so far not many right

they came around oh no

remember the teams if you want me to say

something Swedish if you want to change

outfit

or whatever

[Music]

yeah at least he's not driving so I I

won't drink but he will drink

don't get alcohol poisoning I'm not that

bad of a driver

look I'm not going to eat a single sign

in this race which is

uh quite a huge thing if I managed

I haven't been paying attention to signs

I don't even know if you hear steady

I don't need yeah I did hit one once but

that never happened

okay

but that's come from now instead because

I haven't hit that sign yet

I should keep it that way

they contamin good this time I'm a good

bunny I can do this

as I says I'm almost run into that

Tumblr

oh oh it it's not outside

don't like that that part is really

really nice

I don't know you wrote something

the reply

I only have a quarter of a bottle

remaining

so

I hope that I didn't think about the

design so I wanted to get a buzzes of

stats I mean that's not strong it is I

would assume

quarter of a bottle of what podcast

okay I don't I don't have this podcast a

certain

Rings or if it is like a legal

requirement

amount of alcohol or something

[Music]

probably the case in you

I would not be surprised if they require

a certain amount of

alcohol or like within a range and

because

that's that's that's what they usually I

like

which is a good thing I think because in

that case if something is called a

certain name you you know that it's

wow that's it

within our range of course but it is

that thing that they came to be

and they do have certain recipes

protected like there is

[Music]

a Swedish sausage

it is called farlicon because

according to be in sausage and finally

is a place in Sweden I actually think

it's called

[Music]

but anyway it is the sausage of Fallen

and that sausage is that name

specifically is protected in EU and you

have to follow

the recipe

within a certain range to be able to cut

but as far as I know it's only the

Swedish name games like that so he could

come and may cause something out for

other sausage if he wants

and that would be perfectly fine

[Music]

finally catching him about catching up

I want to win this

what are some random facts one is

probably us

three quarters

of winning numbers

upside together sign

try to avoid it other thing

that wasn't the sign

but yeah that was one sign

this is not the final nap yet it's the

penultimate map

that's it

yes

[Music]

[Music]

or a second to last if you want to use

like

on a common English words

[Music]

if this can ultimate is there uh the

opposite like second place but instead

of actually saying second place you say

like second to First

[Music]

in the left

it's fine

but of course you have this like second

you can imply second from first

still

the best sign that I killed

[Music]

it's not only that this part is now it

is hanging a lot

lying is stuttering I think I think

correct furnace

like would imply a delay I think

I mean it's not like people speak

correct terms anyway

s first

when they talk about the internet they

call it Wi-Fi even the Wi-Fi is

specifically a wireless

connection and has nothing to do with

internet

let's do the final race

today on that you can have Wi-Fi without

internet

three two one go

[Music]

[Music]

and but I mean sure

like

but they can't the thing is just it

can't get confusing like if someone says

I don't have Wi-Fi

I mean

in my case I do

dream over Wi-Fi

I mean this distinction is important

sometimes

[Music]

okay so yeah but I don't think it's me

streaming or Wi-Fi that is to travel

with

okay this stream sometimes

because a Wi-Fi here works perfectly

defined as the connection that yeah

that I had traveled with yesterday

reason

anyway

yeah the the I think where people get

because people do get confused because

I've seen like comments like people

saying like Australia invented Wi-Fi but

they have the worst Wi-Fi but yeah but

now he's speaking of two different

things

yes Australia invented Wi-Fi as the

wireless connection but then when you

say production has the worst Wi-Fi

you're not referring to Wi-Fi you're

referring to internet connection they do

like the internet for the rest of the

world it was a completely different

thing and related to Wi-Fi

that's why I think using proper terms

could be a good thing so you don't come

they don't confuse yourself

so anyway anything else going on

[Music]

[Music]

oh

okay in that case I'll continue

and the ethernet cable as it's actually

called some people call that a lamb it's

a lamb cable or land cable and which is

also incorrect because you can't play

Overland and using Wi-Fi

the cable is an ethernet cable because

you can use it to connect to the

internet

thank you

[Music]

foreign

signs and trying to win

okay I'm back okay

you didn't say you can't wake up

I checked the bottle okay

um

yeah it's actually still

full

you love your fractions and did

something up hold it

I guess practice is fine

but use like

oh yeah

thinking

yeah if you're on your phone you can

easily access the Productions to be fair

do they look nice

but instead of using a slash sign

a nice symbols awesome

there's access to the three quarters

that sounds so nice

where's the two quarters

in cinema

and I I know that's a half anyway

interesting stuff yeah

I put one hundred dollars

into a stock today

starting at about

190 per share it currently at 5 20.

[Music]

that's nice

[Music]

final left

hopefully it goes well

grassland Wisconsin I think that's a

she has the arcadeness of this cake

yeah I'm just gonna hold it for now yeah

I mean

it makes sense assignment stance that

wasn't me

it's been one of the other places

I think

see I'm actually amazing

because I'm keeping the signs alive

that's your best lap you've won the race

parking on the side afternoon

okay

three two one

I think I won congratulations

um

it's up down this year

everything's working fine

maintaining weighted man

congratulations you have successfully

completed this tier you have been

awarded

trophy you're ready to challenge the

next year

I didn't do this I could do this too so

I need wait how much did I need again to

200

I don't care

drunk guy

I had that money floating around in my

account for a while not doing anything

so I decided to do something that really

makes sense that's

perfect sense

225 000 that's that's what I need

I'll get there

anyway let's do the Chevrolet

oh I need a Chevrolet to do this

I don't have one so

and that's ignore that for them

okay I got girl and everything okay I

got gold and everything

I think so this one which I need to uh I

come through the other races so I should

check can I use

can I use the car I submit this for

another race

apparently

apparently I don't know

in this case

hey clap

you should do like

one laps

this is a knockout yeah

yeah so I should do something like this

instead

okay broken how much does it cost to

repair

I'm going back a bit but yeah if so if I

redo this type of race which is my race

Brazil two laps each and it should be

rather quick

as you get to see on the South Sandwich

she definitely more than I need and then

I cannot feed the car to refine the 11th

a bit of grinding I guess

that's part of the fun right

the license plates not much of a license

plate it's fun fun

[Applause]

[Music]

ction

yeah I don't need to

[Music]

first position but that was rather easy

[Music]

no everything is running smoothly look

at this smooth frame rate

compared to the other track

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

flag

[Music]

[Music]

and also go from b2a

yeah that's awesome it's not only two

left these are eight Class Cars because

I started to conceive it is it because

if it isn't like

the other cars that are causing me

like to happen huh

they do that for it

maybe it's more large and as because as

the cars are you know oops

[Music]

but it is less casual in pressing on six

parts so that's my favorite thing if I

was going to make babies

his tire marks

on the ground is causing some patience

[Music]

because they are building up

they only have a maximum number

and as you create more the oldest lines

are removed

[Music]

of course doesn't make sense okay like

okay

[Music]

yeah it was unnecessary to break the car

considering how far ahead I am

couldn't be no more careful

yeah I guess another thing doesn't make

sense now that it helps right here

[Music]

I would actually be a fun thing to do in

your life

because when because they planned out

and create a tracks

you placed first and then they should

build an exact copy of that race track

but mirrored next to it

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

and then they should

drive I love them more

I guess

I don't know

you're not so stupid idea

they could all be racist at once so no

you strange about anything I guess

[Music]

It's the final lap

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

this lap you've won the race yeah it's

personal there was Zero signs

beefy has been eliminated

and there's no reach hopefully not sweet

snow

or ridges

the skin down turrets when

the game is slowly maybe

bang you're at full 30 seconds ahead so

much yeah well

no that's not

[Music]

Max 65 that seems loud

this is the United States

yeah

it's almost 10 seconds behind

already

I mean it's been a minute but

you can enjoy the music

I don't know what's that

worthy of dreaming in the Sun

who knows betting is that that's no good

it's kind of weird

this scene play mode has Dynamic weather

but you can't do it and she's probably

say carrier mode there's no weather but

you can't set it in like custom games

update hey let's see make custom games

and campaign

It's the final lap

up

found used to keep

all the four wheels just stay on the

ground okay I'm almost 20 seconds ahead

already

that's a cute amounts

[Music]

you see that on your tracks

which should mean that I should be able

to

great I'll be here

but it doesn't feel like I'm seeing

anything

that's

um there was one sign for these rings

that's I think two signs another Circle

so far

oh that was

three seconds in a row

sorry for that

oh that was too much I think

um now it's

moves snow block that was a total of six

signs this race I don't know

that's that was no good they put three

signs in a row does that count as a one

sign

that you get three separate signs and a

trip set of sign

the campaign how many one

congratulations you placed first

congratulations

yeah those numbers shouldn't take down

just because I've stopped

yeah that is 34 seconds ahead

no not turn around again

that's three signs in a row is three

sides well that's six strings for you

or or three shots I think

three two one

that was second one

I don't need nice

I mean those thinking lights

I can hear this race without them where

am I going

all right

it's fine

it's gonna leave me like

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

yeah

maybe it should be like small shots I

mean you could adjust the shot volume

based on it

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

exactly

[Music]

let's sing

[Music]

can I have it

that's your best one congratulations you

played first

oh someone ran into my car I think it

doesn't have any friends

let me check that is our night again

final lap and then I will get my 300 000

because I'm obviously contouring this

even doing my car a car car is about to

fall up first

go

[Music]

each stand on this car is a history

is a memory

but the whole car looks like

[Music]

the whole car looks like Trump love me

yeah

[Music]

I've already did that thing

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

Flippa

It's the final lap

[Music]

not today what I was going for

[Music]

not to recommend him at home

and I took out that side

I just had to touch that wall in this

control of the car yes

that place

there we go

they're cutting our train tracks there's

a strange

[Music]

that's your best lap you've won the race

professional driver no scores do not

straight

um congratulations

who have been awarded .com because

you guys seriously because there's no

traffic

but they have had I

made sure that you're not what they're

driving move on to the next circuit

checked whenever people are driving and

picked

I'm not sure if that's where you buy

first

now I can upgrade it

again very good amazing Sprite

that's how you know it's a fast car

well uh just continue

Memory Lane yeah this will give me some

memories

[Music]

yeah that part is fully applicated three

two

one go

yeah racing straps adds speed

[Music]

there we go

I mean it is my car so I can do whatever

I want with it

and that is how it works right

as I'm facing up against the tuna boy

strange name

yeah that seems like a bad way to build

a road

I guess a natural explanation that would

be I guess that he has from has sunken

and created that hip and then they just

haven't fixed it

because this track is in the United

States

I don't know now this is Canada

I guess

same thing

thank you

actually don't know how

experiencing but no damage

judging by the

speeds limit signs being in one meters

of mice

it is

I did not do anything to that card

I took over the bag

hey

no

[Music]

tips it is my car I can do whatever I

want with it but I didn't do anything

with it so it doesn't matter any either

way

plus there are no judges in this area so

it will be dark that virus word against

mine

not that that driver would blame me of

course because I didn't do anything

oh that was a bad turn why did people

keep messaging me on

keep getting messed in my phone I

apparently

without facility at this time or

something your car sure but just don't

do this to tune about it yeah

I wouldn't I mean my wife's being second

place at the moment but just remember

[Music]

and you will see

I mean it wouldn't be my character doing

this against you like her in the car

this is demo in a car

what I mean

I'm a rabbit girl he's a tuna boy

very different

I'm actually catching up which is

[Music]

a truck I tried to slow down there a bit

[Music]

yeah yeah I I think I

hey

I think I'll lose this race

I still don't know if I get a single

medal for coming second or not

very too carefully as I'm trying to

catch up

which is of course leading me losing

yeah yeah I would love this

oh no the audio disappeared from the

game I wonder why

oh no the game currently crashed

um

yeah yeah I think I'm not going to

bother you like if I'm going to lose

that race

I've lost the car

I have to replay those tracks I just

replayed

by a new car upgrade that car and then

try again

so let's pretend I did just that so you

don't see me sit there and replaying the

same tracks over and over again

someone said it was okay so I'll leave

it this time

I'm not someone argues I shouldn't do

that

I'm trying to do that like

on the types like this is a high State

Street

is a more interesting driver

I'm trying Mary that is on the wrong

side

I'm facing the wrong side the wrong way

okay this time I will not lose

trust me

yeah I hate when the game crashes just

so weird that it happened when I was

about released

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

so I guess

another Fair reason is that this is the

very first race of this this stream

um so

I haven't made any progress yet

no I cannot want to win this race so I

can make progress

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

it would be a shame if something

happened to you

because they in this town

I don't know that

I mean it's a street race but it's going

to do call the police

whether to be fair

could call the race unfair and not the

music hard

so that is a possibility

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

come on

[Music]

let's frogs about it's yeah those are

the

thank you

mild crumbs the screaming France

known for being really loud

at least I think I have problems in the

stretch

I think it's from

[Music]

yeah I totally didn't try to seriously

my home is going to fail

it might seem to always fail to repeat

this race forever

I think so because now that's enough

[Music]

thank you

Carson's

that isn't going to want to think of

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

one more try

one more try

still haven't completed the first

challenge today

now we can hear the frogs again

that sounds fun

that sounds fun

one more try

okay I promise I'll win this game time

game time

okay oh look it's black now you can't

see it right I saw this crazy drives car

should be different one go

watch making that was inspired I thought

the racing strikes color was based on

the color of the card so if you have a

dark car you got the White Stripes

otherwise you get black stripes

other interesting White Stripes would

work better

if I've never car or something

it's awesome

[Music]

whoops

that happened

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

like nothing has happened

yeah I was going to win this race but

[Music]

doesn't it

[Music]

I Don't Mind Games suspicious

yeah

it's so strange

[Music]

package all of his crashes my opponent's

about to win

but I've been at this challenge for like

[Music]

totally mean as his exact challenge for

about one and three quarters of an hour

I really do it because I've been totally

playing this specific challenge

no but now I'm catching up now you see

now

and then I need to remember this one

go

we are the trunks

I think

It's the final left

you have to find a map but can I just

remember

didn't he had a Farms this time or I

didn't

know

there's an instrument in the song that

sounds like

here we go that's nice

yeah yeah

this time I will win this time

[Music]

straight blue screen

hey

not distracted by all the rain on the

Winston King

a little bit all of a sudden all of a

sudden because didn't turn

I think that calls for a random

restarts

I'll do this I'll try I mean when I play

C3 I was restarting the game a few times

too

people are leaving

sorry I'll I'll do it this time please

stay

I'll give my best attempt

my stuff on this last option

I'll do my best

don't give me an opponent that's for

some reason

like a level four upgrade the car or

something

look that girl looks nice to have my

Sprint one go

yeah the piano starts almost

[Music]

it's eight

[Music]

probably because I didn't face up

against whoosh

because whoosh is the opponent you rush

away from but

that's how you can see

that that's how fun you see and then you

you say whoosh and then you're back

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

okay so far so good

and

I should understand anything

[Music]

for some reason I don't I don't know

what it isn't

almost felt like I had less script there

for something for some reason

because it wasn't usual

yeah it really feels like

I have worse grip at the moment which

doesn't make sense I mean if the car

breaks a bit that shouldn't really

affect the screen of the car because

that's like part of the tires and I

don't think the tires it breaks

because the engine is worse or something

then maybe that's how

this game marks

basically I have to run a perfect race

[Music]

[Music]

that happened

you got sucked towards the right into

that thing

yeah time to focus okay now now I'm just

playing right somewhere worse

the exciting Adventure will pump on

finally

win this challenge

forever be stuck

in this endless

challenge of never being able to

[Music]

two

one go

[Music]

connect the display car has yellow

stripes it's a Swedish car this is

because it's blue with yellow lines

well yeah you're getting either way

I'm trying to drive forward and then you

get could be a Corvette and try it

with shampoo next set yeah I mean if I

do get get one I'll do it

thank you

strange slices

[Music]

you just need

anything in front of me

hope the game is like worse because I'm

behind the car or something

[Music]

with espionage

[Music]

maybe I should also get happy still

today

I don't know why maybe I should

[Music]

keep forgetting about that corner

of the corner okay that was a practice

run

let's do three and this time

in that case I might not get

a Chevrolet but

my current focus is just to win that

race

I just want to win

and I will

I mean at least there's no Snape States

or anything

that would allow me to

cheat even more

I'm not cheating

three two

one go

goodbye

[Music]

right here again

what what is this

[Music]

I'm trying to win a race here what are

you trying to do

right

like I bumped the car I used it

thanks see Siana

[Music]

he's using your Technique against you

oh no

not the

pumpkin technique

you think of scraping against the

mountain more

thank you

I got through that section

good kid

and now you still need to get through

the other sections too

there we go

let me know this

I can do this

[Music]

[Music]

completely friendly and I am

here and I'll keep the same

[Music]

I hope I will win

after I don't know how many attempts

I wasn't supposed to do that

or I'm not supposed to do that I don't

know I don't see things

thank you

[Music]

not sure why you have to have a specific

form for third person singular it seems

weird

I mean at least like Spanish has a

different form for everything

what

what

did I just touch the corner and click

the card to to

spin like that

okay so again that's the I mean sure I

touching them about the more but that we

have traveled to massive damage

[Music]

so even though I was careful throughout

the whole Lab a little patch on the

corner there

RFD

beans I guess

wait what's playing

a bit too much time

and keep catching after them

oh you're getting in the way again

[Music]

here we go

they're very

single race against the same opponents

that are based off against two numbers

you've won the race

I didn't win the race

and the opponent has

no complaints

you have one

congratulations

awarded the bronze trophy you're ready

to challenge the next tier yeah because

I think that's one problem

well I guess I can continue now finally

woohoo

and now I can use my well-afted car in

the next race look at this beauty

and now I can print them like this is

fun fun because now you can't see the

present looks like

we needed some excitement in the second

lap yeah

[Music]

that wasn't it's a bit of fun for

entrance fee wow

yeah lucky Mike I should never prepared

repair okay

why are these entrance fees so expensive

I mean I could do this I mean I could

sell a car I mean I don't need

like I don't need two of the same car

this car

which is the same level it's just

send

oh that stock is what I bought this up

to

I'm in 40 dollars how do you say for

five dollars 40 cents

now I have sufficient funds to enter the

circuit

nice nights

[Music]

three two one

go that's last step twice because that

it fell for this

to be serious arcade races

the red bar with white screen

someone

[Music]

did something horrible to that side and

it wasn't me for once

I caught it on my dash cam

[Music]

please thank you

coming to that so they should be really

quick

ly though destroy the sign exactly

this is being in Spanish I'm sorry

happy though

[Music]

should I say rapido

rapido

wrap it up

pedo

probably got this from Turkey though

science

here I try to keep all the signs alive

and then those other cars just

make the signs down

and then I ran over its corpse but let's

get on that

wow now I saw that

all of you watching close to your eyes

from just that moment and no one saw

you didn't hear either

[Music]

I did not

explode

Rapido for taking down a sign and then I

took about a sign on my own

till that sign yes I did

[Music]

I think I have quite the same belief

moments

or maybe you just don't know what typing

or reacting

that's the other possibility

I mean the game is fairly fast so

my personal very much extremely that's

your best laugh you've won the race

but that's what you can determine based

on how long it takes for you to send a

message until it appears on screen

well let's continue

Park the headlines are working which is

important in case it's an eye track

I said if you

think you have stream delay just press

the card wheel change the quality to a

different Corner thing confirm that

if you want to install the colors you

have to change back but when you do

change quality it does

refresh

[Music]

they really need a refresh button

honestly

[Music]

maybe I should like write a

[Music]

because

switch does have a feedback for them

[Music]

when you submit an idea and then people

can vote on it using their own twitch

accounts

[Music]

so I could write an idea about allowing

her basically having here

the fresh bottom tablet easily

and I'm wonder if

um which like I wonder if your client

while the Watcher screen can determine

how much of a stream they eat there is

whether automatically refresh

[Music]

that would also be nice

[Music]

because it's not always obvious when you

have streamed unless you can see

determine how long it takes for a Karma

to show on screen

[Music]

final lap

[Music]

on one requested a change sadly I don't

care

have uh the option to do it during a

race

but I can do that

because I would have to do that and then

I have to do this and then I have to do

this

I could do that

and that will be too hard to do so I

don't want to do that all right

anyway

um dry fast I join as fast as I can

I'm actually now trying to do it as fast

as I can because that would make me

throw off your boat

that doesn't seem like a good idea

do you like the outfit

and now she's sporty

I guess so she can

at the mouth

it's more these 40 hours weight is more

like physical exercise

and while there is

Commander is still requires a lot of

them

endurance and and it is a lot of

pressure only as a car driver yeah

that's not to be ignored

um

maybe you need uh

it could have waited until after the

race I mean you didn't redeem it after

today's video

I mean I

started next to it it's really quickly

but

I mean that wasn't that wasn't a problem

with the enabling during the racer

no problem at all

now I found any character in the car

could look like

that would be neat

[Music]

moddingly

so it's fun inside

why are you attacking

hey it destroying my car

beautiful pink heart that I paint for

with my own money

foreign

I mean you could have

redeemed it it's like closer to the end

of the race that was what I meant

and I said if you have enough

I mean yeah it's like you can still

empty spicy

[Music]

so let's continue through these Hills

[Music]

[Music]

everything yeah I was thinking if the

redeem should show within shot another

realized it they chat juicing

connected clients

the API with Twitter

I am using a service which is using the

which API this service does not provide

any trigger for when everything is made

but the Twitch API such certainly should

have a redeem

the themes in there in their API of

course because otherwise you will be

able to have things happen automatically

when you redeem stuff

yeah wait

what animals

okay we'll see if there are any animals

somewhere on this track

[Music]

nice where

yeah the birds

do you think I can mimic a bird

I mean unless you call me a bird

300 on there

there is a bird how am I supposed to

make that

I I can't make those noises it's like

bunny

oh you want me to make a funny noise

wait what is important I mean that's not

really what the redeem is for I mean I

guess the name of 3D is a bit misleading

um but when you do choose to redeem it

actually tells you more contain what

this actually is

it's more that I

mimic that

mimic the animal noises in the game

I said why is it

nice

what is Twitch doing oh there we go it's

it's that switch face

this point

it's a bit broken

and I repair everything

and also I can

okay I can remove that

early refund you

definitely wasn't really any elements I

can mimic

it is easier for like platforming games

where you have like Critters or

something

and the redeem was actually created for

you because I was playing Spyro

and in spiral you have three one two

two other that makes noise

and there's people things

the girls in Islam in stretch

and again birds are very hard for me to

mimic

ception

if it's like realistic bird noises

that's not going to happen

not I mean

I mean I guess I guess that did find out

me trying and animate here with yourself

so terrible

I'm an anime if you want me to meet with

this Eagles you can imagine if I can if

you want

apologize for us too

many birds why can't be like a cow or a

horse

remember seal

it's a bit the design is a bit late it's

like place where it matters it doesn't

give a heads up

like

oh there we go that's something better

fun has

the Need for Speed okay

um

by the way my name is

I wouldn't even say it's the

name oh yeah

I'm saying

[Music]

nice shortcut thank you and

okay

I guess yeah that that would be okay one

has

I I don't accept one fun has a Need for

Speed okay that would be fun hard before

but um

[Music]

after that

fun fun hard to do without has to hit

now you can repeat it yourself

write that down in the chat

[Music]

that's a battery theme he's such a thing

Sunset that fits

[Music]

imagine if Need for Speed was sold in

swindness

[Music]

I can't write but you are writing I know

what you mean

I saw that coming

and I braced for impact

congratulations

speed is has the hit

or do you want me to say a thought which

is the other word for speed

I can write that in Swedish okay

on Palm heart a bit with our plastic

here so yeah that's it that's pretty

let's go this now we reach

speed look it's attacking

mixed with something else

[Music]

two one go

I do want to

thanks Explorer

[Music]

these tracks I could do it after

completing this game

[Music]

we left the race track looks like a

bunny I do think it looks more like a

tree

yeah more like attack in a bunny

I can't be because I see like the [ __ ]

back in it doesn't honey

[Music]

and there's like the duct tape

but of course there's like a hand in the

front meat like a car like a bunny

what any other animal

that could see that being like a bunny

like

but the smart is a bit too long to be a

point if it was shorter I can see

and now we're driving around it

and that was it very excited

yeah cry synonym for means

everything went fine

maybe

I should screenshot that and like draw

or make the show have you seen about it

I mean

[Music]

and then posting

okay I see the darkness yep

oh you're looking at oh now I see how

you see the bunny

but I don't really see it as a bunny I

see more like a rat in that case

[Music]

a red slouch over oh whatever you say it

[Music]

the snow tracks you off the road it's

annoying

they made it slippery

It's the final left I found out that's a

very weird way inside

don't feel like

that is if it's snowing in that case

it's very slippery and that's very

annoying

track is slippery right now

I just pick up a little kind of snow

[Music]

like it's supposed to show the

uh

[Music]

funny in mid hop

with the hand legs about to push up from

the ground I can't quite see that

I'd still say it's a rat

it's like it's like

I don't know maybe maybe like a hamster

it's some kind of

in such scientific

term here that includes both both anyway

I don't remember what that term is

and then the next comment I can't see

because it's our lock screen write

something more

so this comment appears on screen phone

you know I never touch these things now

is this which original chats too so

it should be

okay you guys is finished I can actually

scroll now

it's fully on screen

he plays first

race and chat now I raise and chat at

the same time that is how I do it

and if I fall off the track and this

track is a boot

look at this

you put the the left side is where you

insert your foot and the right side it's

the very wobbly solid results

like you get one bit off on the snow and

it just pulls okay

the edges of the track is erased so if

you get if you get up on the edge there

you

yeah it kind of lifts up hard and

sometimes I feel like it's trying to

flip over the car

okay I need to

something before maybe in the comments

[Music]

one of my favorite tracks and one of my

worst threats

I hate this track my lab record is one

minute and 16 seconds and my life record

is

I don't know what my left necklace

yeah I'm not going to get one minute

definitely a boot at least we can agree

on that

when I make these tracks

[Music]

then they like

pick some shape

and then make up track based on that

shape

would I do do they just feel the tracks

and then move hands up as a change or

something yeah that's my lifetime

I was like one minute 32 seconds

[Music]

no that's going to be worse

obviously if you're actually going to do

good lap times to turn off damages and

obviously to pick the best car for the

track

and then let's tune it as well this

there is car tuning I just haven't put

it about it

[Music]

[Music]

seconds left is always faster because

that's gonna come

[Music]

competent stuff yes

I know what you mean I just found it

funny

yes that's me I'm honestly

[Music]

[Music]

1.6 seconds 15 centiseconds

did I right now I haven't found this

congratulations

completed this circuit you have been

awarded the gold medal I

think

937 500 crowns

I'm back again hello you didn't say you

were walking you went away you got a

phone call uh okay right now and it

pulled me out of the stream yeah

to the next circuit

don't tell me what to do

in that case I'll do this one because I

want it

for the past that's also with the

fastest car to

I mean it's yeah can it can you use

upgraded cars outside the career

otherwise this is someone could probably

make a mod for it

there you should be easy to be able to

make a mod for that actually

just take the do you take the car that

can be upgraded copy three times and

disable upgrade on those three

snake copies

[Music]

I'm trying to think here and then set

the stats of that car to the values of

those upgrades

and there we go

now you know you can select the login

card outside camera if that wasn't

available already but now I'm driving on

Snowy track with snow enabled and yeah

more Labs even

[Music]

um

yeah you can oh nice

in that case I don't need my pot

it was speed runs it's not allowed okay

it's about speed runs what what do you

mean

[Music]

backpack blue

a maritime is force on speakers but what

do you mean by spin further Oh you mean

just

an upgraded car for Speed runs I mean

everyone has access to that very fine

without making sense to me

those are the stuff that doesn't make

sense to me when it comes to speed

training

foreign

[Music]

things I know it's like different speed

running communities and every Community

has their own dreams

oh no

[Music]

nowadays attack storm

I'll get it

[Music]

I hope something but I said too

seriously

you can use only the cars in the game I

thought you said not a car into them oh

oh yeah you didn't yeah I thought yeah

okay I thought you said yes you can you

set up your car outside of Kenya okay

yeah

no no I understand yes obviously you

wouldn't be able to give some modded

cars for speaking studies

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

at least

[Music]

and then I guess I could 100

by getting Gold and Everything

riding around

[Music]

whoops I didn't mean to tackle you maybe

I meant to do that

this track

in snow is Hell yep

I think tennis I mean I think there's

two more snow tracks and I think those

tracks are

just as annoying

you could have more annoying because I

think those drinks are longer

I want to try and price it again it's a

nice dress

this is like one of the starting tracks

that accidentally comes here that she

responds in this class

knocks you off the track roads

and then homeless oh yeah I shouldn't

read the comments when I'm done

another sign another drink oh you

actually now you need to decide

are you drinking enough

I'm actually only at least after seven

but I will try to get second

[Music]

stuff out I think I want to go

yeah yeah

third place or first place every second

place

[Music]

again

yeah every every time I was about to get

second place I never happened

[Music]

oh whoa don't attack me

[Music]

second place and actually cashier I

might just surprised how cute this goes

sorry it's slippery I didn't intend to

do that okay that was your fault

[Music]

thank you

I haven't actually been drinking yeah

I've been out of vodka by now if I was

then

[Music]

and I'd be in trouble wait why would you

be in trouble

I sleep off the road Ah that's not the

other side

something happened to the yellow car

Maybe

like cutting off that point

that yeah fine so far

fine yeah it's going well

what's that I got my backpack

kill the Snowman

oh of course no man

that's awesome

on it

those

bad things at work wait do you drink at

work

[Music]

what a workplace and then you drive home

[Music]

but it's fine you don't think that much

no

rest in peace no man

you're seven

no no you don't have me

don't ask me I literally I purchased the

league

it's mine

at work now after yeah

I thought that was the case

[Music]

that didn't sound as fun

[Music]

I have to work before you drive home

yeah I know he doesn't mean that either

[Music]

okay

are the other two tracks also there's no

tracks with now enabled

[Music]

it really should be I think

for this game you have like top speed

top race times for 248 times and then

you have it fastest lap time

things something like that oh it's a

knockout

Nice Guys in that case I didn't have but

yeah it's contribution Summit this is no

tracks all all the snow tracks

me and arimian made the Snowman for pun

pun well thank you

I appreciate that

so they meant that I was allowed to

knock it over because

it was for me

it was for me

so I have taken a bottle with me to the

parking lot and the trained officials

before it can be three two

one go

I'm getting to work

with some trees

in your system

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

bye with this now man for fun fun to

destroy

dance party

that's commonly us today yeah yeah you

drink and then you go through the door

no you you you pour yourself a drink and

then you drink it as you enter the

building

that that's the Australian way

everyone drinks at

[Music]

I think this is the worst track to drive

in snow for me personally

I mean I don't like the roads

there is that

[Music]

here it's more common for someone to

smoke weed before work

[Music]

I need to get rid of the kitchen get

away from the top of the fence and yeah

let's get rid of the fence to fall down

[Music]

I think that's one of those

emails

I don't like those emails did it show up

on screen by the way I don't know

actually no

because and

yeah the problem I have with those

emails is that there's

um

[Music]

I wonder how much damage that karate

and because there is no system

like I think they have someone can teach

them but but a lot of those

um

Global emails they have there's not

there's no proper system for how they

are naming them so some names of those

emails Collide sweets like

regular stuff I want to write

and that's Point annoying

[Music]

[Music]

because I actually don't know how the

regular emails on Twitch works either

but all the uh twitch

[Music]

fantastic yeah I haven't really checked

out the codes for the regular emails on

Twitch

that all the

custom emote Channel emotes on Twitch

has the channel prefix no case and then

you have up at least one of the case on

the name of the emote and address in my

case now the address is optional but the

first must be is therefore you have

hmm

therefore

you get a phrase that has a random

objects left in the middle of it

meaning that it will not

light with anything you would write

regularly

and that's what I see those I still have

that you can't

[Music]

and that's what I think those other

additional email Services whatever their

names are as I can remember those should

have damaged that for their own Global

remotes they should have

use their own prefix in front of it

and then set the same requirements

[Music]

so it is organized

[Music]

but I understand it's not as easy to use

because you just want to write something

simple like k e k w which I assume is an

emote I still don't know if that is

so

guys this car is breaking Maybe

foreign

[Music]

foreign

get all this speed from

[Music]

sorry

yes jkw is a touchy twitching that's why

isn't it showing up in chapter

where in that case

because because I have the twitch

I mean I I don't know if it showed up on

the screen though

because I don't know how F1 released

but um

if it's a twitch email it should show up

in the twitch chat

well sorry

yeah and does it show up on screen

didn't work neither screen neither chap

how is it how is it a twitch

[Music]

ing up

I don't think it is

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

because the face is a classic twitchima

but we know the best emotes are the

company modes

what else

started snowing I was going to say

but it was because it

wasn't snowing every year that they

busted slippery anyway

[Music]

you start face but okay

um

and I think you have to add I'm not sure

why it's not chilling I don't have to

add the

emails

and I mean that's just part of which if

I have add something it's definitely

part of it I mean

[Music]

that's all I can say so

I cannot I mean

[Music]

wait and what does this that one looks

basically like

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I could look more into that I guess

because it's

um

that case I should be able to do the

last place to work online

sketches three hour streaming okay sorry

I have

a little bit fat complete the the board

circuits before this one so I have made

so

that is two new circuits I have

completed that's progress

and then

won't and I have upgraded one circuit

from bronze to Gold so that's

there's some progress too and then there

is one that I have built on but I just

completely to get more money

so but I still want it so

[Music]

[Music]

congratulations youth Place second

congratulations you didn't come last

but that's normal so everything sounds

good

foreign

twitch doesn't have such a much it must

be another service you're using

so object that's all I could do

no please close this I don't need this

open thank you

[Music]

I need to repair this suspension why are

these in the wrong order

and prepare everything I have money

I've sent you the

link you can add you must you twitch

that are part of twitch if that makes

sense if that doesn't make sense but I

can't

wait where you'd send Whispers

okay okay

I look at that

and see what is going on three two one

go

Phoenix

switch again

[Music]

please

what is going on

[Music]

oh this looks like a long track too yeah

I thought it takes a minute is this too

and I'll come from Yankees

[Music]

anytime

[Music]

being

um old and

I guess that's benefits

but I'm optimized I guess

whoops whoops

that didn't happen

it did not happen

[Music]

ing so now he's taking this part

is

[Music]

because the game is game it's being a

bit annoying

it's probably because it wants to reach

like

[Music]

7 RPM alternatively modified written on

that like science

monster is 7 000 but it was only getting

up to six and a half thousand

I mean at that point it should still

switch gear or something I don't know

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

what happens if I would actually

drive over

a sign in your life as far as I know I

do have to report it

and if possible a restore design

[Music]

if I can

but

[Music]

at least this road I hate to help you

turn yeah that's nice

I have considerate of them when I

made these shirts

for for regular traffic

regular regular streets

why don't we Bank it

lap two

yeah that was four minutes

I guess

this is quite thick 16 minutes to

complete

[Music]

at least when this track is over

I will get the gold medal

[Music]

[Music]

but that would be all good and then I

don't have to redo this

if I faint I have three disease

[Music]

and I really need to put some winter

tires on this car

I mean I haven't given I mean I have

driven in the winter when you have like

snow on the side to grow Road and

to be honest I haven't been drinking I'm

driving on drugs in 160 but

as far as I know the road isn't

like driving on oh yes

it's like it kind of feels like driving

an ice

track it's like 15 minutes

at least when you're driving with them

and when I'm the one driving the car

it's all those factors

I mean

much which I like to compare to you

father

games like how long does it take to

finish uh level in spiral for example

it probably takes you

should

or for example if you play

like the NHL games

that's

a regular five minutes period and it's

free Period start please 15 minutes

plus uh

water palette

[Music]

someone paid 50 coins

you're right behind it and message

I'm here

about me

the sportswear thing that was an hour

ago

I don't know it's a good outfit for this

snowy weather right

where have you been

now we should write it what have you

been

that's your best lap lap tree

that's your next best track

thank you

the worst part is funny to try and like

terribly and then you cross the

cone Finish Line and then he says that's

your best lab else thank you

I shouldn't I don't think that's the

best lap like is it like that's the best

of this race or it's like this is your

personal best Lifetime on this track

ever

drive whatever

he's supposed to start to two hours

seven minutes of drying

it's a lot of drying

oh that is

I mean I mean not even three hours but

at least it's not work it's my

entertainment the

is happening with my connection

[Music]

apparently doesn't disconnect

the best lap of this race okay

yeah it makes sense

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

when you're in time to catch the last

half of the final race of the day yep

[Music]

it's an exciting snow days

it looks cold

three

I'm driving a Ferrari

Ferrari

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

perfectly

riding around

that's the back part

I will yeah I'm concerning enough on

this race because I don't want to lose

this training happens if you start ever

since

which would be tomorrow

so I would probably get to the comments

after

[Music]

[Music]

regular tournament uh would probably not

much further about coming in a second

final left

yes

I'm okay

that's

it's very nice to hear

they enjoy watching we play the game and

make my daily commentary

and me reading comments even though I

said I wouldn't

I'm radical

[Music]

I guess that's our hands and then like I

remember like three seconds no three

line long comments because I made the

next larger here like a little bit easy

three

[Music]

now fast enough over there you can make

it

[Music]

but I still have the lead

[Music]

and I'm doing okay

[Music]

and I haven't realized how many watches

there are fancy I mean it sounds nice

the welcome everyone really happy to see

so many people watching this

exciting

15 minutes race that is about to reach

this end

where I hope I don't mess up

[Music]

I'm happy everyone is watching you'll

need to comment of course it's fun to

hear what people think or have funny

things to have but

obviously

happy we got this

foreign

news take your dog out

and I

yeah basically take your doctor

I guess it's affects all animals but

most people only think the dogs for what

it's not it's not more the walking the

dog part

small of the left in the dark into its

business after right

that's specifically that action but

allowing yourself

[Music]

the time is coming

[Music]

that makes sense

[Music]

I wonder if they just have time for that

in English

[Music]

I want to Spanish

[Music]

if I explain it good enough or well

enough I meant

[Music]

okay okay

more damage so I don't need to pay for

it

so you wrote oof to that comment

there you go 50 minutes and 50 15

minutes 50 seconds

you have been awarded to gold medal with

only 600 000 that's a bit

tip of them

yeah and when you're in time to catch

the last of the final raise of the day

I think I think I'm fine that will be

for the next time tomorrow same time

tomorrow

in the description okay this is this

tour

what

you have raised this circuit one times

or the second one

your best errors finish was first racing

different

yeah most recent number of minutes was

first

oh and I see I seen that all right

what did six tracks I place first first

second first one step okay now

but why isn't there like

how much money do I have in total

because I'm abbreviated I have one

one comma seven million Swedish crowns

look at this

thank you all for coming and switch back

my outfit which I should have done a

while ago

nice transitions I have made myself

lot of time into it so let's make it

special it will show in five

four three two one

foreign

so

um always uh did I

I really need I really need an outer or

something

did that work I don't know how nice that

looks on screen

but I do have a Discord server if you

and other YouTube channel I put videos

which are free

which are not strings

they're called oh I see

I see

hopefully the game doesn't crash

tomorrow it hasn't crashed a single time

today that never happened

the game hasn't actually crashed a

single time just so no one is confused

so I was thinking about a

one

doing the usual

reading a nice

velvet Violet playing Minecraft at the

moment

yes exactly right

and I have my funny ring message which

is just regular bunnies

because I wasn't that creative I need to

come up with something
