relax in here while okay working

do you want to do that

when I play some

fresh

no wait that wasn't yeah they have put

the Run button they switch character

button which

oh

did I just upgrade all these stickers

two that are not

okay that's it so I should collect

everything that's the first step that I

have everything here

I have everything here

and here I'm using one gem and that

should be the

the jumper

and since I already got everything

finally

clip

underneath is to find a gem pass and

which takes it away

I uh welcome

here

nobody wants to be too nice for me

anyway

always nice to see new people around

them

at the start

on the other one on the yellow pass they

don't

okay that's a run straight into one

whoa

[Music]

I mean if you were here last stream

yesterday you might argue otherwise but

um

cannot

[Music]

waste of time

foreign

depends on

what kind of Animation you're looking

for I have made one man meeting one

[Music]

is this this one

[Music]

it is

getting the girls and I'm very close to

Jimmy I just need to stop messing up

oh that's difficult

I wasn't happy like them and a lot of

people like them and I'm actually very

surprised of how some it is

and

I'm surprised myself with how

how it turned out considering how little

I have drawn

I have very little experience drawing so

what do I keep doing this okay

I mean

[Music]

that's it I can do this if I start

messing up

messing up in here

[Music]

um

very happy that people love them so much

[Music]

ah right I need The Band

this is

too excited to get in the Box

okay

you might have a fun job

okay here yes

then I have the land

is

there but it should still be a good

Empire at USB

okay it's not the only time now

during that case I'll test that yes that

works

[Music]

he actually gets totally jump over and

I'll look

thank you for the pizza hey this is such

a kind person

make me happy every time

the funny messages and

especially funny messages

foreign

it's fine

no nothing hot

miss this spot now

here we go

[Music]

and definitely cold

that's that's quite an interesting

I'm happy with that

you're welcome so many more so

you just have to create curiosity what

kind of like animal if you want an

animal noise because that's like my area

if it wants like human I don't know

I'm still working

on a human version

of an email I'm not really

he's liking how it turns out what we'll

see

another sound

I think that's

which should implement

just should probably post a link or

something

I also if you

I don't know and if you have a Discord

yeah

um

but yeah

wait oh yeah my message didn't show up

because it was command so yeah I need

the gently

and the Discord yeah this is my Discord

Channel you can either

join stream link or copy the link and

through your Discord

and if you only have a mobile it doesn't

should manage you should be able to just

add new server and then let's join the

server and then just

so

in case

I would post my art and since then or

something

I do have a

channel of core basically and I want to

coaster your heart

yeah

this

yeah I have something you might say

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

foreign

what have we got

oh yeah isn't this

this thing yes

no let me goes to this area and then

backtrack

that will keep the checkpoint thing

nice timing

tonight

I'm on my way to 60

strings affiliate strings and when I

reach the 16th I will have five follower

slots

which people can access without being

subscribed

oh yeah I've been seeing I wanted to say

was that

apparently locked up on switch but what

they really should Implement is that if

you are assigned the artist of an email

you should be able to access that email

just like a subscriber would

because you designed it

[Music]

so

I think it is really

well since I have

perhaps

my checkpoints

there you go

here we go

yeah and this and there is the platform

which is I'll be left

I should get back onto

and this I kept down here

let's see if I can back here I do have

this checkpoint

here we go you see

another craft platform

then

okay

[Music]

perfect

and back here and she pointed perfect

this is perfect

you can see you can see I save that

checkpoint me

good kids

[Music]

everybody

foreign

[Music]

yes

I can send

I am on a lot of

let's see service now I watched the

ukulele on basically just one survey

but that one like

15 properly for different streamers

that's

I obviously cannot be active on all of

them so

I'm not sure what what the bad one is

this one makes more sense let's see

[Music]

although

now they have two no no really we should

be able to get over here and you see the

problem

did I get everything yes

now I will activate this section

crossover here safely well as I say I

almost put it down anyway I got the two

gems

but yeah if you want to write me

something private seconds you can always

write me if you want to ask me something

I hope I'm not a survey

is that hey the server is kinda

with

nothing a lot of activity

so that's fine

that means that

you can keep track keep up with

everything

well done

this one must be one I just think

get out of the first one

and that's it all right again I tried to

run

that's not how you run

this evening

but yeah and this also has the this one

has a yellow platform

which I also need to use to get the how

much backtracking do I need to be

nice

starting off when

come on

[Music]

what's that

there it is but the question is

where does it come back

if I'm not mistaken I think it comes

back at the end of this section

foreign

yes this is the end

okay

so I just need to backtrack

carefully

foreign

[Music]

yeah this one doesn't have a checkpoint

inside

you could use a place one here

you guys didn't want to

do you want to be so kind

I'm getting everything

where's your position nice to say

I'm gonna get this one you get the fruit

single tricks

can I get a checkpoint here at least

foreign

um

wait I think maybe we'll get to press

this one

but I mean there's nothing there but

so where does this land

but since I've collected everything

it's fine

I heard that he's gone

no more worries

bunny

but yeah that means that

I didn't expect wait

maybe I was just uh he's taken

what and why did that happen

we are currently at uh

20 subscriber points

descriptions

at 25 and one more

females not will not

[Music]

all right let's go

I mean it's showing painted thanks empty

damn I got this

well

I did it

I said it was at 19

subscribe subscriptions before

I guess it wasn't

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

minutes

I should be able to do this I feel like

completely remaining for it

two hours

okay I will take the time turn

this ensures that I can restart if I

need me

and I want to be

beating around something

you said anything

[Music]

yeah

I might see the ground to just clicking

[Music]

I'm being close to getting all the boxes

in this one missing like one or

something

apparently

seven more

thanks

I

wasn't one

a single Monday

there it is

and that's the gem

[Music]

now just don't miss it that way

that was a great time

[Music]

let's save it

p-o-n like fun

but somebody said and not too much

silhouette and the other times for some

reason

like 20 seconds

surprisingly

well thank you everybody see you next

time

relax

[Music]

left hand that's one that should be yeah

platform I think

it's okay

I remember correctly

let's pick up some extra knives

tonight

standing next to me

foreign

oh yeah I got the extra knives here to

me yes

oh

nothing

explosion

this pass doesn't have any boxes anyway

these are they got spots can settled

this is just a difficult pass to get to

the

[Music]

and of course I assume

like this that one because that would

make it too easy

[Music]

[Music]

there you go

yeah a bit tricky to get to

[Music]

apparently

[Music]

and the hell

it's so close

and then

I think that's my bag

[Music]

no

[Music]

stupid thing I don't have any enough

[Music]

okay

open

and that's the gym

whoa

okay yeah the other one I got the blue

time

Sapphire time must be

one of water which I thought I did very

quickly

but apparently not

I didn't use my

spin missing

perfect that one is clean

that's gonna swim

so this one is the only one yeah I got

the blue time all right so let's check

what time I should have cut in

me again

the only day

where's the Tomb Raider fan Benny when

he took his head

just make me check what time I'm

supposed to eat

now that

management

since I'm close to getting all the girls

and since I got engaged on that hard

level I spent an hour on getting a Time

on I should definitely go for gold

so with lemon versus 19 I think no it's

I think no way it was 20.

I say it's heavy memory

okay

it's the 145

I'll swing

one minute 45 seconds and for some

reason three sent seconds not sure why

those

three that's like

one frame

oh there's no ID game is not no I don't

know

two friends

okay that's one second wasted

foreign

thank you

foreign

that's way beyond my skin

[Music]

[Music]

that hey

it's translating to that one

okay

okay don't waste time on AC

all right

oh it's so close

[Music]

I just need to land on those two

yeah

I guess they quiet behind that and and

no don't jump

like that

I didn't want to have these effects from

timing

then I did that

come on

oh

this is so annoying

come on come on come on

empty boxes didn't explode I expect you

get destroyed that would have worked

but anyway

I guess that's the problem with this

peanut thing it destroys the boxes

and jump jump

all right

jump away

Ninja Turtles

sometimes the game has a mind of its own

he's not so close oh it's so close

I'm now in the clouds

foreign

foreign

exactly where they were okay it's almost

like they taste them intentionally

okay

oh yeah oh yeah

this is the level I'm gonna get stuck in

and that way

let's see

foreign

next day

interesting I guess that one

uh

foreign

[Music]

area

it is something

the moment as I have trouble with the

moment many many times in this game

and it is something uh

doesn't move

I'm gonna ask this [ __ ]

is that

I've had that problem many times where I

jump and it's just I just jump for right

now I jump up I don't press forward I

don't press it whatever that says that's

why I should have the overlay to show

that I'm not pressing forward

some

Force

I don't know why

and then man can I

come together

I see that you found an interesting

outfit

s do you sound like a sneeze

now I didn't

[Music]

I keep learning next to the boxing

oh and

keep Landing next to them

foreign

in this place I had issue

I'm really messed up

candy that's wrong

I mean I shouldn't do this because this

is my bad time bad timing

this isn't that nothing

I'm gonna say my steps so much

okay David me to go in that direction

I'm not trying to blame everything else

but

the d-pad on the place in economics is

something

yeah let's try to get back to previous

ones

3D space

they're actually consistently got

through the end game

are you just done

anything

not nice

foreign

okay now that's my duty

foreign

attempts

I got to stick out

yeah the the swimsuit version would have

been nice for this level but I guess

it's something where Russian

hello okay

a very very short break

[Music]

all right

foreign

I'm getting sick of it oh no

actually nothing serious

hopefully you don't sound down feel

too bad too Tamil

yes I was clear with this area

because he's cleared I'm thinking

because

I haven't seen you talking time oh yeah

okay

that information was hidden until you

got it on Golden

Thanksgiving

30 67.

yes I need the

the one

green gem on this one

this is for Korean backpacking

yes this electric car is a lot of

backpacking actually

so this will be a fun level of practice

but none of this enemies

settings

I got the wrong one but I guess the

right stuff nicely

take this

oh I didn't get this

so here I need you some backpacking

oh yes

uh such a silly mistake

boom

okay Mr three there's that

again PM again

yeah

all right

please man shoot back to 19 years

so I want to need to backtrack to this

thing

because activating these but no natural

kills but not bad

that's when I activate Siri

if any of those

[Music]

hey camera all right keep up

[Music]

with the sound of this specific

[Music]

and yeah here's another one I need the

checkpoints

when I need the the that's the second

area which the

in the enchantment I'm not

yeah

that's last time because it was fun

[Music]

yeah it basically means that is

[Music]

you are annoying

I think that's nature

the green gems should contain the

exclamation point I need and then

a lot of backtracking

it's been so long time I met

and one lemon

[Music]

and come

contents have those boxing

excited exciting then we made that I

didn't get me

thank you

and that's the gem

and next exclamation box that activates

those three boxes I need

something yeah

let me go back

oh thank you Game I actually don't need

backtracking

he just did it for me

so what's the point

um

[Music]

set and guessing I left this behind

[Music]

in case I do a mistake

not this one

perfect

yeah

of course of course

[Music]

foreign

yes

I don't think I win

let's crash four I should perform better

so six more boxes

[Music]

playing City Games in chronological

order

these three other guys

and then

I'm seeing one of these

not in a safe journey it's kind of weird

[Music]

yeah

this is fun I got it again

to me

I got the teachings

I think I got the golden time on that

too

I guess it's just three times

no wait I got this one

one

and two and for the two gems I think I

get all gems no

I guess it's the number of gems

on the upper area without all these

bonuses or something

but nice to see happy people here no

this Wednesday I like last Wednesday

well I also wanted to do the planned

debate technology

or like one person

at the end

hey

it's fine it's fine

[Music]

I fixed it

boy

anyway

honestly the police doesn't care I just

grams I think

[Music]

you can just live

[Music]

let me see stuff

yeah I got 11 more boxes

why are you so slow

[Music]

[Music]

that's fine just when

I guess I shouldn't go to 50.

yeah perfect six more

yeah it's like that last

that's nothing

with all the uh

boosts

right this one here

[Music]

I'm waiting for traffic

now

buy more and they should be here

[Music]

I'm on top of the beacon

I got it

[Music]

perfect

[Music]

um

in a really bad time but it detects

so

foreign

crash

to the

five different colored gems on a special

color gem pass

yes

let's see this

that's nice

okay

it doesn't hurt

Valentine's

nice

and

maybe not make such thing

okay there you go

now

this is the only one breaking but there

it is there's a jump platform

in the Darkness

[Music]

and this is right here

foreign

boxes

I just needs to get

through this iron here you collect them

blue segment now for the green segment

which

which contains

level bees but I mean

[Music]

I said I do want to try to complete as

much as I can of this game without using

a Singapore

that's possible

if not if someone knows how to I like

modifying things like that

I guess if there's a way to

consider the boss completed so I can

guess get to the next one without

actually getting the power up

if that makes sense

because that's the thing you can do in

Spyro reunited

when you're in not that your perception

bosses but you get powers from money

back but paying but if you don't pay him

you don't get the power

so

and with some

free flight

you can

[Music]

get through air yes when you shouldn't

be able to

ah

it's rather it seems very easy okay

[Music]

single platform

and so you can play Inspire 2 without

any power

which is kind of neat

and that's what I want to do in Crash

okay

it's without power-ups just to see

how much I can do without power reps

without supported second image some

areas quite difficult

[Music]

okay

fireworks

oh wait okay yeah I have to take that

but thanks anyway

yeah so after you get everything on the

levels disappearing Etc

any basically have been feed cortex

again

once again sometimes these four speed

pieces are the same Heat

I think it's some other hint like this

thing

what if you collect everything before if

I think what is the person

now we've got concept that actually yes

you can actually not do that this is

exact same but as far as I know you

haven't changed anything but I could be

wrong

but now we're talking about getting the

cameras enough Pistons

yeah you can't get everything before

partying for this first time because

when you collect all the crystal because

you need to collect all the crystals

oops

because you need to collect the crystals

before you can get the time running and

you need the time Linux put it to Camp

that's collecting everything

and when you get it in last uh

Kristen that means that you still have

not done that diamonds I'm running

but you're forced to fight with cortex

[Music]

so everyone you can do that level again

[Music]

which of course they're placed on it

11s Olive ones

nice

oh yes that's a good day

they can only get four of these five

times two stunts before fighting a bus

in 10 15.

weren't

without you

yeah

well

I didn't pay attention

but yeah

I think it's 76 16 bus battle

that's good

well I did it

back Penny Pack

the time twister machine could not hold

itself together

we were lucky to escape

it is difficult to say what has happened

to our enemies but I doubt we will see

the figure that's the second

and then

but I refuse

oh

welcome welcome

Raiders

I am as you can see playing Crash three

and I almost come

here I keep accidentally pressing me

I want to run but that's his [ __ ]

button I just have a few four things to

collect here so

[Music]

he did a shout out

wait what

am I disciple

because

engaged have you heard about Square

emblem but

I have not

made any of them

I wonder considering this is kind of a

strategy

game

maybe it would be something from

try out

okay but I'll be just it went well for

you I'm still noticing history so

I'm Nanny and it's

finished yeah yeah I could always try it

you can see

I don't like it

actually don't forget

but I hope you had a nice dream

and they

would have clothes that was dangerous

amazing chocolate milk

when that happens

[Music]

I just need

to be fast enough for it

building time which I should have

checked for today

I keep forgetting about checking that

yeah I went to probably more time if he

died when I get from

probably we want that one

all right

now

one important one

yes uh not code

I hope it was close I can improve my run

uh slightly and get it

with this stream for a long time

[Music]

curious I usually go for three hours

but uh I know some people go for it

six hours 10 hours

let's say

too much for me see

[Music]

okay how how far off

53 50 okay

I Basics right in the chat

and I got 58 so that's quite Improvement

I need today but I mean the first

attempt

so

let's say it wasn't bad for first of

them

yeah normally

if I should go

but this one I mean it does exist

different reason

okay I can't see that

so

[Music]

wrong

you never check what animals last time

each other

and I didn't expect it

saying so quickly

I can't can I get this one nope

nothing

turning around and getting like

both for five seconds

[Music]

that means that

time for me to

[Music]

get to the other ramp let's be quick

enough three seconds

didn't I do that last time

and again

I don't think I'm doing bad

that's the only one

did I hit two boxes spray

I guess that will hit

oh that's good

can I get yeah yeah I think I missed

that three last time oh that wasn't good

I'm gonna get that one

huh

[Music]

how how hard should be just enter the

girl how did they go around it why is

the area not large how stupid

but at the time I was just wave

oh I was way quicker than I needed I was

I was

stupid games

some sort

well it's proves that I can do it

at least

yeah actually this time run straight

shooting through boxes I just I'm not

sure I realized I had a mask to make

I can

get a jump without making that one yes

finally

[Music]

but it was quick

there we go both nice

I'm just thinking

I get six seconds saved

without messing around a bunch

can I get the new one here

and then I will use it

but

let's see and here I'm fine

don't forget this one but I did get it

so

yeah

you can only face to the bottom no no

need to get around it

whoa

but it is certainly one of them but yeah

one is a deal since I guess they didn't

conceive that one funny

achievements

I hope you like the clock guy edits in

the comments

I was thinking like it was like showing

where chat is somehow that

for the Mist having the clock as well I

don't know if it's interesting seeing

the look at me

and it's just transparent so it doesn't

cover

too much in Chains

but yeah and then there's the box here

in case there's stuff behind it you want

to read

so very soon I'm going to have this game

completely to 100

because I did complete fresh one and two

to 100

based on

Network you have to complete

[Music]

Indonesian game so no time trends

so I'm just off to the boxes but I do

activate the time trans so if I missed a

box I can just restart

foreign

[Music]

15 14.

13 12 11.

when how's the better condition

really good

[Music]

11 right yes

let me say

let's go well so fine

ten

nine eight yes

it's the county box

and looks like I get it

but

[Music]

it's fine

force me two one zero

[Music]

like War

boxes and then I land on it then I

counted as four and but and then my

check they both count then it's

and I'm off by one

then I didn't get out for

anyway

I heard that but only 10 seconds later

than my service time

I'm surprised

so that's that one yeah

it can't be much less now you can

yeah

and then there's this one

which I didn't have a box for it

uh it's one of the

yeah

Coco

fun

level let's see that's fine

I guess what's

okay

it doesn't matter to destroyed by

leaving only box

es

explode when you get too high

[Music]

clock is still there

strange range things

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

area and then start the timer that

should give me a better

time because you don't have to bother

about the interesting thing
