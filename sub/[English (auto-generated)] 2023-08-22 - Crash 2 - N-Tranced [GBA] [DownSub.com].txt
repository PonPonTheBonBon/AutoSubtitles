ated very hard to read that text
the first letter is supposed to be an
end
and I'll say I see
one line of pieces in the middle is
lowly stretched out
and one row because it is also stretched
out there's actually quite a few pieces
this is Joker being stretched out
you seen that happening to some Sprites
on some games are they just when they
when they put this together RBS not
careful enough
let them make sure that the number of
Peaks are wide and tall the picture is
isn't properly displayed I haven't been
this lazy
yeah you have to wait until you crash
four before polish appears
foreign
okay now
who do you have here we have uranium
probably wasn't not spelled on the
native part I mean I would probably
notice it
but that's me
because the logo is
it's like no no kids like nursing about
this game
[Music]

follow the wonderful collect 100 room
before to earn an extra life
Press B to spin and breaks okay
I don't remember what my thing is
running in that
in classification
loves you to bounce on them several
times before breaking yeah I can make it
four lines or whatever one one two three
four five
making popping noises in the mic
yep
crates can be stacked spin or jump on
them to get lost
oh now I spin the way of the root
well this is such a basic tutorial none
of the cards game have had this tutorial
and let's play the Japanese version
do not spin GT crates or they will
explode
jump on them to start the timer
how many crash houses are there
any
question I'm trying to see
[Music]
I mean your head
not in any prior crash game then in
contribution had it but in that case you
actually had a
little crazy
foreign
Fusion how do you do a mini game before
you could build through it and then was
established as an exit scene
but I'm trying to think about the crash
crash Fusion had to get past to the next
screen maybe they didn't have anything
maybe that'll also had you go through
go off screen
nothing that I have when I haven't done
yet
hmm
[Music]
allow me to harness my powers to time
and space to peek into the future are
you sure about that
[Music]
of course since those wretched a bad
cute skip
our thing is the solution is to get them
on our side and I know just the two
fellow for the job are you going to
again to be friends with them you look a
bit mad in the picture though
[Music]
winning
a new recruit
indeed meet my secret weapon
wait what is this one sound like
it's an excellent egg shape it's it's
weird looking let's go with a weird
voice
right let me think
I am entrance master of five
it's notism there you go
[Music]
I need to press that one
crash help
oh that's my continuing Zone
crash wake up cooking crunch has been
abducted find me a power Crystal so I
can look into what's going on hurry
hurry crash but there's not something
behind it wait
so level is
ah I don't think they ain't telling me
to go back yeah I have double check
but I don't have the tornado spin I can
glide
checkpoint
to summon me I will protect you from one
hit again you can fit that
but it's but you were in that scene
oh hello
there's only two types to jump even high
uh
[Music]
I passed two times very very actually
rest or while jumping through body slam
this breaks the crates
crash create will give you an extra life
without everything well you're not going
to tell me anything about this great
what about this great
another trade but you know
hold up hey while bouncing to bounce
even higher okay
what did I call it
that's probably what did I call it
first or while running to slide
he can't cause it about Islam but we
know I didn't remember that tune Secrets
can break all the crates just jump on
one to start timer
as you can imagine taking a plastic it
is supposed to break those website
didn't just stopped crying before it
becomes Unbreakable
do not touch screen need to throw crates
and you probably didn't say anything or
they will explode
the green I need to switch box destroys
all the need to crates in that level
now I hate 22 and I read 23
did you collect the purple Crystal did
you break all of the grains
I guess maybe it didn't
oh no watch out crash
[Music]
just walked into that one
[Music]
something is holding only to crash we
need more power
these Vortex must be the work of entropy
I finally capture that infernal
Bandicoot
[Music]
okay
I finally got
all the obnoxious Bandicoot would you do
the honors entrance
my advantages
he's thinking and we had to pleasure
that's probably the voice used somewhere
else in hyperspace
this great day we're going on here
that's too cool almost all the power out
here crash oh this is the cover this
time good job getting the power Crystal
before you were pulled into the Vortex
but
I need a lot more crystals if we are to
put an end to enter these planes what
happens if you don't pick up the purple
crystalline go into that last one do you
like show up at entropy and get a
completely alternative version of the
game obviously not but that would be
that would be quite the game
that floating island up ahead will allow
us to go to different worlds to and find
Crystal hopefully we can find Coco and
crunch and stop entropy
and this must continue and save other
interesting question
foreign
[Music]
glitched
Prince of Persia and Laguna Tunes
in the picture
quite
some secret handling of
grass of Cortex that I never made
well I can't do it anymore I guess I
packed down my PSP
Crush in this water world you will need
to use your wakeboard to collect the
power Crystal the waters are guarded by
a vicious shark so be careful well oh
what is this fancy thanks to someone
[Music]
this doesn't look natively generated by
the
and Game Boy Advance
look at these water textures
no I missed the Box
wait you need to destroyment boxes
[Music]
I went in a case
now
this time it doesn't finish
Mr Fox again how am I supposed to get
that
is
[Music]
fine
foreign
okay let me
try to get every box
[Music]
and that's pretty
Graphics Works in this game
[Music]
okay I missed I missed the crate what is
going on
[Music]
I went I have to check my too late now
I mean no Crystal then
okay
they're here
[Music]
[Music]
but how am I supposed to get over there
and then it asks me every time if I want
to say
one that was a weird eleven
that's what it's actually
no it doesn't really fit the game now it
does it
and the boxes are on the wrong lane and
look at pressure when he's behind the
box and he'll be in front of it okay
yeah there's no proper three three
Prince of pressure
but look it's the
personal level from
it specific depression
oh the music he's sleeping
[Music]
wait a minute can I can I go down I
don't know
as you can see
the Catholic town
[Music]
I Remix
oh
that can go down here
oh that wasn't very easy
it just still doesn't show up
and it was still glitchy
[Music]
and then they were compressed
the sound
we got some extra lifestyle
probably don't lose them all
ding ding ding ding ding
hey this guys didn't turn around in the
original game
I got Diamond mask
[Music]
I don't know when a pet scorpions do you
want a pet scorpion to pet
s
why was it now again
s n u o b s nope
[Music]
what's new
that's the question I'd like to have pet
scorpion
[Music]
so I must change this
property
I got all the boxes
[Music]
one two three four five oh
Dr gem
box from three to seven
and I got the gem
green Jam
hey I found another scorpions work on
Friday
do you say on Friday when you're talking
about last Friday
foreign
as you say on Friday
in Swedish if you're referring to the
upcoming Friday and say in Friday if
it's the last Friday was
crush this Mayan ruins can only be
Traverse by using wonderful your
favorite toys the atmosphere look out
for only to the traps and edges
foreign
toys
that's why it's using it so much
I guess this game actually like it works
because
that China game was isometric roll your
other Spirit to the exit use a to break
and B to speed up spin up option oh no
is it going to be worse and why is it
B for speed up and eight
that's why
and glitching through the box this is
going to be horrible to play time travel
although it is more responsive though
yeah the layering on the boxes
things to say offline in both parts and
she says that's a verb well
I miss the mouse
I have a very close to the meaning yeah
sounds weird to me because I'm not used
it
and those beings
is to tell you where to go
another house yep
there we go
over 100 boxes
that's a lot of boxes
well
well
thank you
so now I need to check
does it why does it move like that
there we go I want
that's where it came from
is checking there was nothing there
um half pipe
no wait this is a quarter pipe
yeah there's a ramp here it's just hard
to see
yeah
I guess this level isn't that bad
but oh it's floating
I think back what I said
oh my the gravity in this game
is that why it smells so strange like
yeah and that's not supposed to work the
shadow clearly knows where the current
ground is so why isn't this the
Collision the same as the shadow
and why is the Shadow and Coalition
correlating based on different things
that makes no sense to me
okay
why do you have to place this so close
to the edge
oh
I fell over that
I'm missing one
is a little fancy
thank you
it's weird yeah
at least
I wanted to drop down in 15 frames
I noticed
now it's already light so much
and when did you do that wait a minute
what is this
uh do I have the Instagram something oh
no wait I go around here
slightly annoying
hmm
how to get up there yeah that's what I
will figure out and I think I know the
solution
here
right now a little bit of it
but I have to get down again
because apparently it didn't let me
just drop down
well
Deanie
yeah I want that too and it's definitely
purple in this game
well wait what's this
shortcut
Short Cat
yeah it is
that means I missed a few boxes
no well that's a way to get back I guess
there you go
internet
run away away
glove Trucking of course not that way
you rock
this is also one of these probably this
one also got like green yeah
[Music]
no oh no I don't like this
is there are many ways to go around
these levels and you you don't have a
look around feature
nice
it just exploded as soon as you step on
it that's not what it's supposed to work
[Music]
wait
oyster crab on top of this
foreign
[Music]
fresh
the second game on game mode
and it goes okay through it goes
I'm trying to figure stuff out here okay
so you can't kinda get up on it
ah it's very tricky now
there we go
okay that was weird
oh yeah
and they have redeemed to change the
outfit Tower is not automatic saying I
have to change it manually
perfect

oh there it is
wait where did I go after this
[Music]
[Music]
you can't get down but there's nothing
there in most places
[Music]
each
yeah it is quite an interesting game but
I'm getting very scared of how much you
can explore and you don't have a good
camera
foreign
first time
you mean this is the first time you see
the game
[Music]
oh this this Method video
yeah this is the first time I see the
game as well

okay this doesn't even need anywhere
okay fair enough
everyone's first time
all right but there's something down
here
just a cramp or scorpion
or scorpion scarves

so how come how did you come up with the
name Winona

banana

it's called that
so I wasn't sure if it was related

would make it a little bit easier
[Music]
well I don't know please press button

hey his name is
love no
no it isn't
his name is
[Music]
actually this
is
it is different
yeah
you should eat the different letter it
has a different sound
yeah and if you try to replace it with
letter L
then you're just getting the wrong sound
like
yeah
that's that's that's uh
something that uh evil crunch okay
I have a shield
all right
chicken
[Music]
I don't know maybe shoots me yeah he
aims a gun at me
[Music]
foreign
I think I see
so this is the third phase
and then you create this type of thing
oh well one two three okay
oh oh my brainwashed again thanks for
saving me that's his voice now
could you scratch the crystals you've
collected have allowed me to open up a
new area of the island we can get to new
words from there get get
super snight oh no ships line third L
and push R to break crazy
but father
as you slide better than father
yeah no uh since the time in oh that's
that's where you get the next thing no
Bluetooth oh no even cocoa
some some letters originate from other
letters and have a musician line added
to them or more but then then they make
a different sound so you can't simply
remove that line from that letter and
pronounce it as the other letter
is a primer
suffering yeah it's a squeaking after
and the letter G
and
it originates from the letter c with a
line added to it you can't simply remove
the left the line from G and act
everything it's a c and that goes the
same for the the
the
straight line with that
and line across that has a different
sound
even though it looks like an l oh I
don't think you're supposed to be
passing it like that
it does not make the same sound as
definitely
[Music]
yeah I want I want to do that thank you
Chris
so yeah
so can I use it no I can't use it there
I think you're supposed to do that
it's a really long slide
Queen
I recognize that if we cook a picture
someone who follows you use it as an
email I can I can't remember who you
though oh yeah that is true
oh and in midnight
[Music]
someone got mad
do you have this code yes and the
command is a benchmark Discord
and that's my survey
I am
active on the same age it's to be
expected we can chat about all kinds of
handle stuff my interest that you might
know is nice picture and games
oh there's something down here
now
why does it slide sometimes now
it's very
experience game I had it I had this with
him not slimy
but now it's like it's too much
I just wanted to duck underneath these
wow
there you go that's the blue gym and
yeah nice nice
hey can you wait a bit oh and you wanna
ride nice
[Music]
like a server a person one it's like

it is like my server so again I do have
an account there I am has to be expected
princess pon pon
if the community has selected me as a
princess
and so it is
[Music]
uh yes
so the let's switch out sweet then here
we go
I do want the outfitting to be fully
automatic and
one day one day it will be
[Music]
But but so far it isn't
welcome to the Sarah owenanna
I hope you have a good day so you should
say the server doesn't have
a lot of activity but that means that
you can pay more attention to the
activity that actually happens
I do like that
oh whoa whoa
it literally it didn't it didn't just
jump up
it actually attacked me
it went for me
look at that
oh nice
wanna finish
what was this uh Tiki torture oh yeah
open coffins
open the door
open the gate
right now
between a few
it didn't die from that
yeah
yes
all right okay
I am I am a bunny and also there you go
they have the swimsuit by the way yeah
this game uh this game is this game has
the stupid thing again when you're on or
on a slippery surface you have slipper
physics if you jump off a slippery
surface onto a box you retain the
slipper physics
it really should remove discipline
physics as soon as you jump on a box
[Music]
oh well
[Music]
okay I was trying to like I knew there
was the slippers physics active at that
point but I
yeah I really should jump up from the
boxes at the top instead
if I did this
video
no touching
thank you
[Music]
three four five one two three four five
twenty three four five sorry if I'm not
paying attention to your comments I try
to do it as much as possible let me go
see it Evelyn you commissioned someone
for all the art stuff we can see any
tweet
um
and the the model I did Commission
the emotes I've drawn myself
the the background I did to draw myself
as well
and this um
foreign
rabbits I did my make myself
and is there anything else I guess the
chat overlay
it is based on an existing code
but uh
[Music]
I didn't modify it heavily to
be like how I want it
uh how much did you pay for it too much
I guess it wasn't too much it was uh
well doing the trash
it was
um
a 90 euro
or uh
which is a lot of money for me at least
but it was a long time ago too
[Music]
and but that was for a complete religion
character with
the uh three outfits these 32 outfits
you can redeem as well as
the default dress
yeah
an original character that I have
um
basically full of I want to see Puff
[Music]
don't you think you have to shift
on a digimon now my name is
[Music]
not a static picture
well um
this computer won't be able to handle it
anyway so
so
[Music]
but I do have interest in having Pom-Pom
animated
but I'd rather want more like
um smaller animations not like well no
not like full tracking anything
this mean time small
no it is your turn to use the atmosphere
crunch okay wait crunch but be careful
and trippy has added some new dangers
same level but it's crunched with a
bigger bone
package place so this is the first time
you play a scrunch ever
and so far the only time I know about
playing a scrunch
and it's just stepping in there but this
is a three interesting to model them
I assume you're supposed to progress
after you don't know
wow wow
[Music]
this was
face
that's what he looks like when he's not
even
nah this game
okay so what did you say I can't
understand a single word here wait what
we'll talk about you anymore
uh I hope there's no issue with Miss
with the audio
if there's an issue with the audio
people please let me know
why this is I'm not even pressing that
generating button
I'm just trying to tap airplane
sometimes it speeds away oh there's a
house now so
at
yeah
come on
it's a stupid ball
yeah I have to lower the
quality quite a lot
uh well I'm here about the dishes
this is
okay
okay what
this isn't even touching the events
Oh no you're missing a box
uh oh you can add the Expressions
yeah yeah yeah
that's that's what I'm thinking
I want the like expressions
and
some animations for like
yeah
things
well there's a barrel
thank you
some some expressions and some anime
like waving was the same thing
well why where does all the speed come
from all of a sudden
really hard controller on level seven
playing as credit was fine but players
crunched all of a sudden it speeds on
there is an accelerate button but I'm
never pressing it because I'm trying to
do this carefully
just so he shouldn't speed away but he
speeds away anyway
and now this is like downward here but
you listen slowly
anyway oh
so there was gonna be enough
oh
no I need uh
yes I guess if you could like track my
emotions not sure how it would do that
and that's automatic automatically
changed
like trash is heavier I guess but that
doesn't mean he should speed away but
that's making slower explanations
if you don't mind that's perfectly fine
you can send me private messages
this one
I don't get many I can actually get
quite a few of them so
I agree
I might not answer chat messages
immediately but
[Music]
all right we'll eventually answer them
though
and I gotta check my sentence
since I met yeah
and of course I don't expect people to
answer to reply instantly anything
because otherwise that would make me a
hypocrite
oh no options
the single
bar there White Pass I know more options
now it's a circle
now I need a checkpoint
oh thanks
and of course if it's something like
related to these
streaming
selfie I guess
or like yeah if it's not nothing like
private about yourself
and you're free to write it on the
service one
thank you
inside my open about another stuff
yay checkpoints hey mine is bigger but
it doesn't seem to right this is a
single
uh
wait a minute
where am I going
oh there we go
so against that with the shortcut but it
has some boxes on it that would
completely ruin your run so
is it a shortcut if you're going to die
every point is so many
this is again
right
what more of this
I was going to say Forge but it's not a
fork
there aren't anything other than
this is technically the alternative part
and this is the real path
now
why didn't he fall down
I mean if it kills its technically still
shortcut just in leads to where you
expected though but what is it shortcut
to then
I mean it I mean sure the past is still
a shortcut I mean I guess you're right
about that
it's just because I paid the shortcut
doesn't mean it's not a shortcut anymore
okay
so this is an advantage pattern
no well I can take this
there's three more boxes then
it's interesting they should have tips
what's the alternative process and to
the exit
there you go that's all the boxes
and there's the gem
s
but I'm still missing a few no okay I
need to do this first thing block full
of singles
foreign
[Music]
and I guess you could say that too I
think mine was a bit less
[Music]
um
what's the word
[Music]
you are correct that Christ is laid on
top of the boxes
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
in the water like that I guess it's not
grass but
[Music]

I've marked my mind yeah yeah I don't
understand like okay I understand that
they don't want to unlock this spot
because I haven't completed this one and
this one but
can I just unlock this spot but just not
this lemon so I can go past here so I
can take a shortcut

I've heard that this is a bad power
it's raining it's redneck crash foreign
is located in space Coco you must use
your spacesuit and Rocket Target to
retrieve it entropy has sent a huge
Bible that will destroy the crystal if
you don't do not move close enough but
they are create a true Gage to help you
stay ahead of the danger and in crack
three
[Music]
Coco never changes her and changes
outfit as far as I know
so regardless even though I see
something Jet Ski whatever it's called
on water she's not wearing a swimsuit
which I would say she should be stealing
but whatever
and even in Spain she's wearing a ring
around
when she actually been wearing a
spacesuit this time
do you mean that she is actually very
much patient
a pretty special of course
as you can tell
you can't have a girl character unless
she's wearing uh
something pink I got it
let's shoot I can't come back
[Music]
and thanks attention
oh
[Music]
I have weird controls
no I'm missing a box

[Applause]
[Music]
I missed it
another one oh that was last week too I
might not be able to die
come on Fireball ketchup
foreign
[Music]
try again
okay anyway why is Coco so dark in that
picture next door helps next to our
house
which level is this this is run from the
Sun
and a copy level
which picture next to her or even the
percentage I don't think it's an expert
or anything
he's doing that oh you face
I guess that alrighty
gonna kill me if we can already faint
the main objective
finally
okay hi Jake
[Music]

[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
Okay so

foreign
[Music]
Vortex sounds like a name
no jump you guys jump
honestly the Polish I know or not
yeah I mean
I don't know most people know polish
but most people don't have only
statistically
most people don't know any language that
he's thinking
if we go by per language
foreign
who makes these statistics they really
can't get their point across if you look
at each individual language most people
don't speak that language but most
people do speak like two three languages
so yeah
let's see
okay trying to learn my screen name in
all the languages
not even like
English in the first place
so
that would be a papa body
yep
foreign
are related
in spotlights are Germanic and yeah now
my box
I guess we're running this one back then
hmm
I'm sure Valley and evilica are also
related
probably
destroy it
vtv Mustang that's the personal
ity
foreign
virtual TV
[Music]
virtual television
it would be the same in Swedish enough
if that's the
means yes that would be Bruton
instead of turning
[Applause]
okay
I used to run
is this really sound there
okay
you can be my teacher okay
this one can just destroy this
interesting
other I think yeah right I think all
committee is more grammatical correct
correct yeah I mean yeah
foreign
other terms like if this one for
the Christmas that one
and you can also look up terms like
Pope Francis
I guess
King Gustav
and see which trade should be
okay
I don't remember yeah
two ways
I assume this pass is the alternative
process
and thanks so much in this team
but because the game is
Sprite based
all the displays aren't that nice
looking you replace the Sprite with
copper
Pom-Pom
it's sure like if you're all right sir
wait
okay
Rockets
I know any tasty the other side
there we go oh a bonus area this must be
where the gym is
ah upside jump straight into that one
[Music]
cash I'm gonna have to ask you it's not
to ride the bombs
but if he likes to ride the rocket
he he
me
he really hugs the red rocket
until it explodes
then he releases it
there we go there's the I think they
have accidentally cropped out the like
the white reflection on it or something
[Music]
all right I can see right stereot rocket
again
he understood I know it's it's Crash
grabs grabs onto and hugs the Red
Rockets until it explodes
at that point he releases it
my sweetness
the trees is everything okay then I get
everything there are two more boxes
they might be
I think I saw them
wait I do have this no this one which
I've so far not even
uh he looks so weird when he does that
and which I have no reason to use so far
like I still can't reach that box
but the other box might be on top of it
or something
nope I'm missing a box
no grab that grab on today guys
now we can
this is how you go back
come on guys there we go
welcome to breakfast
ah missing a box
yeah I know I know it you can interpret
that as that's why I said it
yeah
it's usually when you stop running
rocket exactly
slip and sliding swings
things
oh it's one of these levels
thank you
it must be plenty of places where you
can just hide a box this is going to be
very annoying
all right nice I'll turn to pass up here
but
Danny can I no
I guess uh
[Music]
everything
okay so I stand on top of this and do
that this is how I get there
this is the alternative part
maybe I can get that checkpoint
I'll get a knife in there
this one should therefore
change the channel
[Music]
[Music]
well let's see
[Music]
I should have taken me
no no come on if you come on this is
this shouldn't be this hard
so what went through your mind when you
jumped on there
I need some
nothing yes my brain is head quite
tempting
wait where's my life I didn't pick it up
[Music]
it's not supposed to
such language
yeah I'm starting right now wasting it
immediately
[Music]
yeah I can do that the next stop
I disappeared
[Music]
I know when I need to go back
ah monkey's heads
yeah I have some
weird
way to face our things
[Music]
some of the boxes are gone I wonder why
oh
hey can I nope apparently not
okay I cannot keep it used
well while longer
nope
[Music]
no
the jump is so terrible in this game
nope I think it's still not getting to
keep it
just that that commands to do it
and this is a big chicken
[Music]
there we go
now we get to keep it
[Music]
I also didn't destroy that box
Nitro
[Music]
terrible old games are terrible yeah
I mean it could have been worse it does
play quite well but
yeah it does have plenty of issues
there you go 10 points
great
[Music]
at least the water doesn't kill me
take point
then it one
it's a knife I do need exercise at this
point I am more referring to the
gameplay improvements and Improvement on
what
yeah it is but at the same time there's
a lot of things they went back on
when it comes to
transforming crash games on Game Boy
things they could have implemented but
they chose not to
[Music]
that they did Implement today
in the original game that made you very
what made this game worse
it tried so hard to make it like the PS1
games
we guess they failed I mean I find it
was actually made them fail as closely
as possible that would make me that
would actually make it good
in here
it's just not
the bonus levels are not
saying because it is definitely bonus
levels
does make the bonus level more
interesting but oh yeah I need to kill
my manually
right yeah
[Music]
[Music]
no problem
that's why it's going to explode that I
was just going to explain that and left
in some mirrored l
he came in L you should have
put it the other way around
oh yeah
stop doing that
his parents lasts for Henry
oh
parallel
image exactly
no
body watching
foreign
[Music]
boxes no stupid hidden boxes that I need
to do that Rocket Jump the axis
it's such a terrible time enough now
it's Istanbul okay
this person is about turkey or wait how
do I climb
I can't climb I can jump
I think
rocket Jam
pocket cam there we go
anymore
oh did you like the scientist more
[Music]
there's something down here
attacking the point oops
perfect is cone
he's again
charred
no okay
you can you can grab the pole and spin
on it
I know I know there are some people who
do
I hear the attack
but
[Music]
oh
I can stand on this but you know it you
can't be sure
[Music]
and doing some squats
[Music]
let's see how I was going to move like
that
how am I supposed to reach it then
because one thing I know about this game
is that I think the objects are not
getting active on until they get on
screen but depending on when they get on
screen the timing for when they do stuff
is going to change
but yeah
good a good outfit for moving around
this much
there we go now it's a different timing
um okay
whoa
maybe I should have to leave
as I need if I'm going to get me
clear gem I need to go back anyway
and I also clear the place out of props
which are scorpions
so
[Music]
and should be able to get up there
later on
if I take the upper path
well don't sleep down slide down
there you go
okay this is
[Music]
I also don't know why that checkpoint is
a metal checkpoint they use method of
checkpoints in press three
or these bones are yes
or where they um
don't have any actual crates or Atmos
meters so you don't have to take that
pass to get the clear gym
foreign
but
that is not always the case
and that was not
oh I'm dying
prime time
I'm doing so bad at the moment so I
guess I only need to pick up the gem and
then I can just
okay game on me
I'm doing so bad I'll pick up the green
gem
and then I'll just go back
[Music]
okay checkpoint
I can't think you're in Jam
then I'll go back
foreign
Ty I don't know
fun to do
and then I'll just go back
laughs
[Music]
okay nope
there we go that's what I wanted
and then checkpoint oh whatever
[Music]
you know what kind of phone service is
this
Jesus
but
yes no no
it's the world was constant no but now
it's Istanbul nut can Snapple been a
long time gone because it happened now
it's Turkish delight on a Moonlight
night there Might Be Giants having funny
song
like is that a song
set a song
I'm speaking of songs
yeah
also in essence it's creatively
Revelations the final feature the final
game featuring is
[Music]
you go to Istanbul I think it's been
placed in
1511.
[Music]
neat
what's it is I only remember who they
are because they perform the same tea
Malcolm in the Middle
okay
I don't know what Malcolm in the Middle
is so
but I do know what Assassin's Creed is
[Music]
nothing down there I had to check it was
a bonus though it was a
s u n b o
a sunbow
kind of like a rainbow but
um
American sitcom about blue collar family
in the early 2000
oh
yeah
in that case I have not seen it
should I go back and do this bonus after
I exploded on a little case
[Music]
yes no maybe I don't know can you repeat
the question you're not the boss of me
now
or maybe I shouldn't have just exploded
that stuff
bring it back
no
and that is the theme okay
yeah Noah no experience with this show
you don't have Rocket Jump but I don't
see how that
would help oh come on Chris
such a tricky jump
[Music]
there we go please no more
thank you
I don't care what they need
[Music]
what did I say again
please no more it's so it's so tricky to
do those jumps because they require you
to go solo low on the road
Sarah
they called the pole before because it's
very solid
I like the one where how is teaching
math come to skate and its place Funky
Town
yeah I'm completely out of the loop here
have fun
no I waited too long instead
yeah
[Music]
this is this is this is going to be
Ace is going to be from lemon
be right back yeah I'm probably not
gonna be done with this level until
you're back
by relax of it
but I'll try
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay
ah one of these dudes
is this pin

that is actually a complete the first
level before I mean was back though

I guess I could do that too
there you go
[Music]

let's see because I can do like
I don't have to exactly mirrored

I was stuck I couldn't move
[Music]

whoa
finally that took many tries
[Music]
and trying to blundering idiots that was
not crash it was some sort of fake crash
wait what did he sound like again I was
I suppose you know he fooled you too
besides they will never find or Hideout
not in a million years
good job crash with a few more crystals
so I'll be able to open the vortex to
entry his hideout
enough
[Music]
the comedy in this game
even crashes popped yeah it's kind of a
half balloon I guess Ronaldo Spain first
speed repeatedly it's been longer and
temporarily float
float like a beast sting like a
butterfly
and current Ripple is considered the
spiciest pepper in the world recorded
against book one yeah doesn't it
determine how much spice like how much
of it you have it's on the chips I had
nothing to eat
oh you don't want to eat pumpkin

why is it why is it crying why isn't it
cocoa
I'm gonna I'm Gonna Roll around Coco
yes take that out contact
I wanna
roll around with you
okay so this is just back
I'm gonna count there's something up
here
functions
Goofy's mind
I'm hungry me too
I'm not like very hungry
but I am getting more and more hungry
and I will eat something after the
Stream
I was hoping to get
cooking but I guess that's
I was supposed to get the money today
but
I haven't arrived yet
annoying me I'm not sure why they're so
delayed now now that I do need the money
to get this thing now it's when they are
delayed
of course
so I don't have oh sweet you don't have
my mouth
now
not that I wanted to be eaten but
okay sorry I'm lost in the conversation
here
[Music]
you can check
and I don't have any message about
the money arriving at the bank so
right which way am I supposed to go now
this is the way I should go
there's anybody
taking up the conflict yes
we'll be taking out the context here
we eat pumpkin
it was gone
I do this carefully then
all these arrows here too but this must
be the
now this is just a shortcut
don't ask me how it is wait
what
oh now I see
yes
that's where I come from okay then
there's this area
oh my this level
versus levels of coffee scene
why is this glitch graphics
where am I
okay I'm here
no I guess I have to start over
so I don't need to take that part
because it didn't have any boxes
hmm
wait where am I
price this part
not right now where I am Coco will
finish his level Gem and he he will
attack him running
yeah
why can't I play as Coco why is it
crunch again like it was so first was
crash then I did tonight
unbrainwashed Crunch and then I played
this crimes and then I unbrained washed
cocoa and trash no Crusher defeated I
killed crash because it was not crash
and then
I'm still playing scratch
why not as Coco
yeah there was no boxes here right yeah
I checked even though I don't have life
to check with
by this respawn
and that's not allowed
but now the game makes it makes you use
crunch yeah
should I use coconut because I do or
even more traps for you this time
because you are so clever Coco
maybe a checkpoint
but yes I have to like hit the box with
crunch or something for it to count all
right landline
completed with oh
rocks can't roll I guess I have to start
all over there
it's getting warm in here is it just me
or is it just warming it
yeah time to change outfit against
whoops that didn't you didn't see that I
totally didn't press the wrong button
there
pull off a bit yeah
put me
there we go
that should keep it cool
because Anthony is cool
back to the game ready to put the
control index
I mean
totally the real game boy I'm holding
I'm not anything to remember yes this
way for the Box
which loops around here
fun fun does have a warming effects
oh all seven wine
when he makes say nice things and on my
blush blush and I'm all blushy and it's
warm
oh yeah
one uh
yeah well I can do this second time
around
I think it's warm or fuzzy all right
technical companies
fancy and also you cannot stand still
with Paul okay so it's technically
moving but it's another pixel
nothing sideways
I guess no the motion is way too so
I can't wait
and then
your
adorable
I'm almost like that as adoptable
sorry you counted off me I mean
actually
if you like
paying for all my expenses and like
provide me with a new computer
I guess you can adopt me
because why does Christ have a heavy
Shadow but not the other icons
don't need
a cross
y I'd adopt yes okay yeah I can be okay
I already called the serious said that
I'm not depositing nothing but yeah you
need to be able to actually be able to
take care of me too
especially as a pet
I mean I wasn't supposed to continue
that way
I guess
I guess the closest thing to adopt me
would be to
donate on my patreon
a small fee every month
so small some every month and I'll be
your
virtual a pet so something
where a thousand bits on
which you can use the
feron ponton emote which is kind of like
a pet
I'm gonna pay for a bits using
the browser and not the app otherwise
you have to pay additional fees to
Google or Apple
oh
I made it so far
and you can do it by accessing
it press nothing but nothing you would
yeah well ever since my hair yep
different different
is never satisfying
it is because she was turned into a fair
bunny maybe she wanted to be an answer
funny
wasn't too far only
now she's disappointed in everything
seeing 19 spaghetti no interesting Pizza
no interest in
cheese chips
it's a cheese of that price you don't
know maybe instead told me what
flavor that was I don't remember
I think you told me what's playing right
yeah I don't remember what flavors
like the
generic name
without any
thing would we have to tear
armadillo
so even though it really should but I'm
adding you
oh
I wanted to see if there was anything up
there but I guess
there is nothing
interesting popcorn no interest in
Pikachu with the ramen
it's nothing here watch this where's
this
yeah because Pikachu is eating that
Ramen definitely not interested
I was gonna say would you be interested
in the Pikachu with the ramen but of
course you will
thank you
and this is just up to these places
[Music]
we take it easy now he's laying over
everything so it's hard to see more why
it is
foreign
animation and then this disappears
and he was moving so slowly and
carefully and then
all of a sudden yes it's ahead
moves up the ramp like it's not
ah him
no interest in a Ramen cup without it
and it's even open
seems was like a closed cup of ramen
like
do you expect me to open this on my own
yeah the final pumpkin has already eaten
she's not hungry
come on
so you're trying to offer a food like
that yeah I thought I don't want to eat
anymore
okay now we tested in another this
interested
I mean who would be
interesting
well
I guess that we know which email is
going to be the most used for this
string
anime box anime two little dance it's
dark it's not gone
do you expect me to eat this it's not
even cooked
all right is that the next name what I
should do cooked ceramics
finally I did it
eruption disruption speaking of
red rocket
I wouldn't be surprised if there's a red
rocket thing is
on this game because in the in the game
where the bird is from
uh when it attacks the ground it
actually
destroys the I need to spin the boxes
yeah I could grab it
you think we cram it
yeah we can roar I mean
[Music]
what what
that's not that's not how it's supposed
to animate coming I guess it is supposed
to have like that because that's how
they made it but that's not the parts of
the lava
thinking game
but then you're basically have to check
every wave
if there's something
[Music]
oh it stops that's why I can't stop
oh now the birds try to land on the
boxes but it went face straight through
the boxes and landed in the lava
there's a polished suit called
saranya
it's known as duck blood soup but you
can also use pink blood chicken blood or
even rabbit plants
the bird is killed itself yeah that way
I don't have to care about the bird
oh
my try
yeah definitely the swimsuit in this
level
we're very hot lemon
[Music]
oh my crush why did you do that
we can't attack you can't slide
so you're supposed to do this
that scene and then you can explore
everything
I'm not sure why they couldn't just have
two buns more access but I guess they
wanted a TNT
oops
that's not what I was looking for
I remember eating rabbit so I actually
don't know what the rabbit tastes like
[Music]
I'm hardly saying that everything tastes
like chicken but considering people say
that uh no car someone is called it
tastes like chocolate I'm not going to
trust people
[Music]
there we go that's what I wanted
okay um
me neither
[Music]
chicken might not taste like anything
we can taste like chicken
and it recently tastes like air things
that
that added stuff for tape yeah
but I mean I like everybody like chicken
without any knife but I do get that
people do add like uh
and
um
spices that's what I'm looking for to
get one two three
yes that's all the boxes spices to meat
and if they had the same spices to every
meat that that can overpower the meat
and yeah
therefore
the life is carefully closed up in the
space and therefore every meat will
taste the same I could imagine
but I would love you that chicken still
has uh
we could tasting things anyway welcome
[Music]
welcome welcome
[Music]
to pass
I hope you're having a good day today
it doesn't seem to be anything here
except
dangerous boxes
no what
well I don't need to dig that fast in
the morning
but I mean people also say that water
doesn't taste anything and I'm cute to
be fair I have nothing drunk distilled
water so I can't prepare them
but I don't think most people have so I
mean sure what it might not taste
anything but that's not the water you
think tap water however I do have taste
so
[Music]
I don't I'm not a particular fan of
Blackwater taste
this might just be and and it's not like
it tastes bad or anything because as she
might know
I'm supposed to get there tap water in
Sweden is very safe
so I wish I could say my day was good
in
that bad
I mean yeah sometimes there are bad
things
I have my friends
I mean I
I was like I am supposed to clean my
house so I can sell it and I guess I
wasn't that productive today in the
cleaning part
I did some but
okay so no no
that doesn't make me want to listen to
something no interesting
because you can't go after
it would be weird if there was something
about all right so first update
meter boxes no
they did the second jump crash
I'm a big sad because in two days I'm
going back home
sad because it's over be happy that it
happened for whatever they say
yeah I do I do
I do know what you mean though that
when when it's over and you have to go
back home
okay
but I assume you have had it really fun
I don't I don't remember what it was
that you
you probably have
told me but my memory is so bad
uh but if you do tell me I can I would
probably remember what it was
no
one
one
yeah I couldn't do much about it but I'm
missing a box want to make sandbox
anyway so
I won't
what is this question
I guess I just had to be quick before
because it gets quick
nope
no no
oh there we go I did it
the skills
and let me wait here
and why is that the problem because now
I am at my boyfriend's house and I need
to go back to my oh
you're at your boyfriend
and I bet he's very
very lovely person there we go that's
what I wanted
that's it I'm still missing a book no
we can't talk under it oh you need to
jump into
well that's a bit annoying
things
no I haven't
oops
y you know him it's Aku oh is he is the
one
oh yeah oh yeah
I haven't seen me much on stream though
but yeah
[Music]
[Music]
okay now
oh yeah
wasn't the one I was going for but
oh here we go
I tried this
[Applause]
[Music]
I guess he was supposed to do that
now I'll take the regular parts
we did not do this you're burning the
streets this is not allowed
I'm more of these
we like to make this then
you're not bouncing on those they're
breaking the rules of Crash you're
supposed to bounce on the hood
let me create the activate you should
bounce on
wasting knives
I know this song is referenced by the
title is never made
oh my
okay now I'm just screwing up
yeah a mask without me
I'm chewing up like that
[Music]
no what
another cell I just remembered I have a
tornado spin tornado spin but again
there's nowhere in the game that has
required me to use it
he's here but it doesn't want to help me
there you go
foreign
[Music]
again
and now now I'm playing like
um
laughs
playing crashed like Lola
I also don't like how it doesn't save
how many masks I have
PT mask I have I do keep the mask for
some reason but
so if I die by insta kill and not buy
something removing my mask I do actually
get to keep the mask when I get the game
away
that's an interesting
probably not a decision they made
I want to wasting it immediately
hey I heard the attack
and now I have
starting off from the beginning with my
life
I was like the whole life system is uh
I'm buying our favorite system
[Music]
[Applause]
there you go
thank you
it's fine
you can can I do this without massively
failing
now it's asking very much of me but
foreign
[Music]
thank you
and the carpets move so slowly up and
down this one
oh my God
it's so it's so slow and moving up and
down it really misses sister for me
wait why didn't the second box explode
that that caught me apart
oh I guess there we go
these shutters are so small and yeah I
mean not sure what is a large targets
but
above them
oh I missed
well looks like
in skill level of the game has increased
dramatically
I'm cold and I'm dying in
oh seriously
you're going to touch
but I heard the attack and why is he
keep doing this
why is the game so terrible at the
moment
I'm doing Terribles in game two but like
I heard the attack
certainly doesn't play the sound of an
attack off after him then
that would be weird
but I mean game is weird
so now I don't get that anymore
[Music]
foreign
[Applause]
[Music]
okay
[Music]
I was cleanse
hello everyone
best rocking man
hello rocket man this is
all right both give me lives
we
he sure is
putting me
through no the wrong one oh yeah Dusty
that I
this game sure is testing my skills oh I
jumped on the head of that one I'll do
that quick
foreign
[Music]
no no I stop oh oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I take that I
don't want to redo that section
yeah thank you
yeah and all those
that's section
where I had to precisely shoot those
boxes to get through that section
glad I didn't have to do that
[Music]
yeah I think
more here
you don't have to back oh yeah there's
things
[Music]
yeah
but it doesn't mean I have to backtrack
but that shouldn't be a problem
that's pretty easy section
especially when those
green boxes are gone
pink green boxes
do
[Music]
wait I can't get up from here
oh no
okay
then I have to backtrack the other way
around I have to backtrack my back
tracking
foreign
[Music]
boxes
but I wanted
I won
I guess I'll do the normal tracking now
oh what was that you're not done that
before
[Music]
what
I was clearly under it
no the game is cheating
I heard the attack
what's up
[Music]
okay
oh come on come on
this is going to be
this is going to be annoying
[Music]
okay I need a mask for the ending
but I just need to keep it the other way
s today
don't attack me when I ride
they take such a time please
get killing
there you go
okay get some backtracking then
yep
striking needed and I died
and now I didn't start over from here
this is going to be annoying
I'll see you just completely
oh come on
yeah
what
in that case I'll let you know why
[Music]
the clear gym
but but that was the tag I was in the
middle of my attack how did that not
count what's wrong with this game
not only games
starting to be being very annoying
but it wasn't already very annoying
foreign
[Music]
oh
okay
much time I know
now I think you can see the whole
line section
again
and I was like keep forgetting this
points
it's a very rich place today
that was the wrong thing
yeah this is probably my least favorite
level now
but I was attacking I was
what
this game is something
anyway I haven't read your comment
because I was so annoying but there's no
one
they just like dropping chemicals out of
the window washing them ignites they're
not strategy because they just
he's just a casualties
that's right
they keep on doing it
without crying I understandable yeah
it is very understandable
why why am I not getting a mask at start
to learn
I keep dying but I'm not getting pretty
much
not like I need it
clear clearly I do need it oh I finally
got it that's like dying
I don't know how many times
[Music]
it was as if this level wasn't already
annoying where's my mask
I know just not supposed to have the
mask after you get the game over but
this game lets you keep the mask after
you get the game away but now I don't
get TV
the release of this game keep painting
as I play
and it is very hard to follow
the rules if you keep changing the rules
without letting me know
yeah you kept it last time yeah he kept
it basically every time I got the game
away
but this was not how it might be used
yeah because the views have changed
and you've been in the challenge
that's bang out of the way
and
yeah I'm not going to be able to do this
unless I get here
you must
foreign
come on
it's like using icej6
oh
I actually got stuck with a double
muscle
I can't move more forward than this okay
how nice it ended
especially not go down there
[Music]
oh what is this
coming playing stuff well well
bonus I mean checkpoint
Arabian Nights yeah
that's the theme
[Music]
there we go
really really another bonus like this
[Music]
yeah as if this level wasn't already
very annoying
and then they're just going to have
another bonus like this
[Music]
okay how am I even supposed to get
between this is
this this jump is so precise
[Music]
thank you
wait wait wait
and then how do you how do I move over
to the next one is there some kind of
very
first level in this like can I can I can
I can I just
shimmy over to the next one over there
we should call it
and that's not an option
because
[Music]
as far as I know there's no social
yeah this this balance will take be
right back yeah you better care of his
bonus time
I wouldn't be here for my mind
[Music]
uh my
[Music]
[Music]
I tried to time it but
[Music]
a camera how am I supposed to do this
is this something
am I supposed to
[Music]
am I supposed to go and destroy the
queen exclamation mark box and then
backtrack
that's the second that jump is so
precise
the first one isn't too tricky but the
second one
how am I supposed to do this
I I really don't know how I'm supposed
to do this I'm so confused at the moment
[Music]
yeah about the charms back yeah how am I
but there's a freeze yeah
up
[Music]
s
ET
[Music]
yes I guess I'll try this then
[Music]
now how
thank you
yeah I really don't like how they
activate S and you approach
because the timing can be so weird
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
what
I just
is that
I guess that's what he does but I wasn't
expecting it
[Music]
[Music]
can't stop shivering I wish I was cold
I'm still too warm
[Music]
I try
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
cycle
yeah that worked
one one less ah why did I did that
that was just stupid
oh
my God ah a mask finally that took your
wine
and I lost it on
[Music]
okay
consistently safe jumping right now
first looks buff on those poles does he
no one loves the code there it's only 32
degrees outside
that's a bit too warm for me
it's easy for the one that's how he is
shivering I mean it's still very warm
I lost it
[Music]
there we go
finally
finally and then I'll hit my no sorry
level nine of them
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
this does not count
[Music]
I'm being so hot
did Chris wants me to fall down I wonder
how did they do want me to find them
okay
thank you
[Music]
what is 11.
I'll take it back
it's still going to be it looks like
you're playing right
[Music]
yeah
China I'm still messing up there
green boxes are gone no more green boxes
round box is still there though but
all the characters
say assume I'm supposed to
fall down to avoid
working boxes
how much
I don't even knocking noise or is it
snow up and obviously there's no
question
another question is how it changes to
timing for that
thing I don't see why it does that
[Music]
it is whatever you want it to be
all right
well this is going to take away
[Music]
I mean now it is knocking there
I will see I should have all 24 boxes
attended
what
is that uh yeah you really need to Prime
that sink
it's so weird why can't you climb up the
ropes things
one two two minus if suddenly falls out
and if you choose fall down manually
falls down it really fast speed
I'm getting a good time with my heart at
that point
[Music]
that was too early
yeah
and then it's a bonus you have to go
um
[Music]
honest I'm struggling them with more
specifically
is
it looks like there's a pro it's gone
this time the discount this time
it's gone this is the time to do it why
was that not so much to read
[Music]
it's broadcasting inside a comment there
didn't have any problem appreciation
[Music]
obviously not the only attorney to do
that
it doesn't have visibility now it's just
carpets
that was the same
way like apartment looking like
[Music]
he was over it but he didn't grab onto
it
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
I got them quite far here but
I mean yeah
so so
precise for when you need to jump
and the good thing I destroyed those
nature boxes because I'm already
struggling with that party man and if I
just if I kept it into boxes can still
try to redo this part
I will do mental
[Music]
oh
I'm a great time crying
[Music]
[Music]
wait
um
[Music]
oh nice nice moving forward
[Music]
[Music]
okay you can grab the roof while falling
down so
why it doesn't happen sometimes I don't
know
artificial difficulty
say like that he's over the Rope so why
doesn't he grab something
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
no no
I don't have to RNA
oh my
[Music]
God
and also a good thing I also got a
checkpoint here
uh because I had to order it
as I ordered it has entered the the
checkpoint the bonus level it could have
already used up the checkpoint
[Music]
but apparently I get a new checkpoint
when I enter anything else
which is I'm just I've got a good thing
otherwise I would have to restart the
whole game just to get and get a check
right there because imagine like I had
to give back
blood it intergrades every time I find a
bonus
wow
[Music]
there you go
I did it
just as Armenia comes back
I am back
and I'm still missing five boxes of
course I am
of course I am
after all that I'm still missing five
also what I mean why is one
I'm still missing five boxes now I'm
using fireboxes
what what
does it go
oh because the boxes are gone
uh
I need to take this path now
okay I can't drop down like that energy
[Music]
like
yeah I'm still missing
[Music]
then missing
five boxes
away yeah and then he came back and I'm
only surprise boxes
back home I am I did completely just as
he came back there
so that way to get back
but I'm still missing boxes
I'm missing five boxes I need to search
for five boxes
somewhere
I mean I didn't take that one again
[Music]
well I guess I just have to find five
boxes somewhere
I mean I
where can I be
not down there
doing that
[Music]
when I meant to make that box a wooden
box and then they
accidentally made it uh
my thumb box or something
I did take these boxes with these are
not the one I'm missing
these are more than five one two three
six boxes and these are four boxes
that's
like this
so hard
maybe the maybe not when they require
exactly though
and then I come back in you have to be
starting to act like you're amazing
rest those boxes are and
what I yeah
I heard the attack
why does that happen
foreign
[Applause]
yeah I was thinking maybe maybe I can
actually repeat the final boss
but but I was attacking why
apparently can't attack a new on the
phones ropes
don't need helps
because even though you are having an
active attack the effect doesn't do
damage or something
awesome
and that was a fan game I didn't mean to
die though but
yeah that's also a thing sometimes you
just didn't grab the Rope
even though he's able to grab it while
it's running down
so I don't even want to hear the attack
but
the enemy doesn't die
okay that was a new one
[Music]
yeah I'm getting paid of this game
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
nice
[Music]
why doesn't that activate
notification
oh wait there are boxes down there
there is one box
okay
but I was spinning I could see the like
this time it wasn't the only audio I
couldn't even see the spin
but I guess I landed
fine this time even grab onto it was it
because I was spinning
and this all right
yeah the mask mask isn't going to help
with crashes and grab onto things
and crack right yeah I wanna try
okay that's one
oh no I'll jump up into it is it down
here nope
[Music]
and I got the game my way otherwise am I
supposed to check
there's no moving the camera button
are you going to hide some stuff out of
screen
sometimes they're testing sometimes
they're boxes you just have to guess
well at least one of the five boxes
which have four more
[Music]
thank you
so that's some progress
oh no actually anything
oh yeah you're watching a glitch State I
couldn't move
that's even more fun
as far as you can see there's no secret
boxes down there
[Music]
[Music]
one after
[Music]
yeah nothing okay
one of the five
[Music]
there's nothing up and then there's this
section
thank you
tell me you guys have anything
really hard to know
thank you
foreign
[Music]
there's nothing here
yeah I don't know why
you cannot the only thing I can think of
is that section
because I have no idea how to go back
so that's not
no no on
The Bouncing box back now I have no idea
my remaining four boxes are
yep
I'm waiting here anywhere
I'm showing you right away
[Music]
do do
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
continue
is it just going to be one of those okay
time spaced out
I think it is going to be one of those
levels I'm not going yet
I can't keep
I'm keep pressing the attack button but
the character does not attack no because
I press the order button to attack
just ask the complaints about the game
yeah I don't know why they decided not
to use the attack button to attack me
and the same problem without the game
too
um checkpoint
if you have
if you have an attack button how much is
it attack button technique
I got the checkpoint
seems like shooting stuff is more
responsive in this compared to
no what
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
I keep pressing here
this is fire I was I was pressing the
flame button to Flame but that's the
charge button I have to press the charge
button to play
there's some some dude which decided to
switch them around
oh
laughs
give me food boxes
[Music]
but I guess I can just ignore them
someone should make cocoa spacing into a
costume
yes her hair outside Spacey to
understand one
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
thank you
[Applause]
that's the thing
you know what the eleven there's still
14 years
that was going to take me away boxes but
apparently I don't know anything
[Music]
all right so nice nice
don't you need extra help sir
that wouldn't mind having a checkpoint
[Applause]
there you go got it
so there you have Full House then
put that next door we kind of need it I
know
I got them one more box
okay I missed the Box apparently
ah another hit that much
King to uncommon
Aaron let's do this
it's a water slide
what happened to Jumping there was no
jumping
all right
[Music]
ninja
not Health boxes why not here
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
let's see
there we are end of 11.
like
wait 21
in trains
[Music]
Yes we made it to entropy secret base
entrance you feel they have found us
destroy them
it should have taken a million years to
find this house
I'm just not passing the vortex I had
all the time I needed to find you why
what
when did that came up
here is making stuff up
you have no you have one last chance to
stop them do not disappoint me again
destroy all bandicoots
yeah
not by attacking me
and you touched me
okay so that's when it gets back
okay
okay
yeah I'm confused
Iron Man coffee's why do you have to
replay the whole thing
imagine
I am confused
okay so that the cost damage is not
utilities
so even though it makes no sense
yeah
for him to suddenly be able to make
damage as soon as he misses me
I need to stop crying from that
there we go
I don't know what I mean
oh he's so quick so quickly
oh my
of course
okay stop crying
I keep forgetting that that take make
first damage when you try
it's like it's like 21 rounds in here
for some reason point one
thank you
is very easy I just started
we got a way to avoid that there we go
is it a second place oh it's just Disney
no it is oh hello
fight with you then
and if I pay you do I have to restart
all the way from the meaning
I do because I don't have any lives left
so
I think there's another attack now
and it's something
[Music]
probably five faces
although why not it's this game
thank you
this game is something
oh sorry I can't knock him
around
lava
no way are you moving
so I can't attack him when he's killing
I mean that I got that
if you didn't knock him
foreign
and then I have to restart from here of
course of course no checkpoint
why would there be some kind to give me
a checkpoint
all right guys so I have not said unless
yeah it is very annoying first part it
is quite easy but
I don't know
here we go
okay that must be an easy man
no
yeah
why okay
[Music]
continue
and offline Journey
it was nice here
[Music]
how's it apparently
despite your dying
and losing a mask you still yet keep it
that can
and I had to do that five times
so hard on Windows
like I need to be finally
nope
yeah how is that
random effect
there we go
I see more times without any damage
be amazing
thank you
foreign
to touch
I'm gonna show it I mean it's not hard
to know where I am because the camera is
focusing on me but
yellow okay now he's doing
don't know anyone as long as it's not
that one like but that case he just
needs to avoid doing it like three times
or something
and like me look at that
go go go yes
very good when I defeat this boss but
there's one yeah no
don't avoid us
okay so white
ish my color is also dangerous then
because it's so big
are you supposed to do a bullet
it's a huge crash character that moves
slowly
I'd like to try out a game like that but
not like this
this is not how to do it yellow
planning crunch is so big yeah I
am so tired
of this game
so hard
like I'm so proudly as possible but when
I'm that far away
he does the next attack so I can't even
push him around
yeah he said another thing can I attack
those things probably a lot I try to do
that
thank you
oh there you go finally
I didn't imagine yesterday without
taking it that way
to move around more that's the trench
I guess that's chicken
it sounds like a hollow plastic age you
know that's what it is a whole no
plastic egg
okay
not much
okay one more time
don't shoot yellow oh and that
I wasn't dead
no
let's start doing
oh I got basically two chances
I'm not going to try this without a mask
if I wanted to remember
I can do every time with a mask with
nail
I guess I could give a farm some lives
where's the level I would form lives on
anime
oh
just now
I don't think it's nice dancing
[Music]
you look so angry in this face
no life
I can see
probably because his travel names gets
destroyed yeah bro that's probably a
good reason to get married
entrance in into doing sport
oh yeah
one punished entrance in sport
[Music]
[Music]
Wonder
foreign
[Music]
[Applause]
whatever the Box
I was crazy probably nothing okay
I will see
I wonder what no not this level
with
one shot
here we go
and yeah thank you Game
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
and I
how is the extra lives cheap
[Music]
knob level
yeah
otherwise this part
thank you
now
it's fine
I survived
quickly
[Music]
aligning with the math
the carpet
[Music]
that's 15 lines
is that like
enough
yeah this is my new thing I lost all my
mom
I'm just like right here
was there a single now there was maybe
whatever
[Music]
start probably not
a feeling that's not the case
dinner
oh that's the distance
I mean it could be because crashes
reference that code before
one extra leg
how's everything will be more than one
I guess I had satisfying with money
foreign
[Music]
when I lost
18 so that means does that mean
well it's alive yeah it's a bunny
I've been going on for four hours by the
way
now let's check the thing
bunny
because if this works as plain that
means that I should get
um extra mass
I guess
by the way I will get extra try to do a
thing with a single mask
but I lost the mask already
it is going to be hard but I didn't mean
to do that
um anyway
there we go there took away my name is
someone count seven
eighteen or something
okay
James
I don't know why why the game of games
are so inconsistently coming back here
try before you get away
so it was seven even though it should be
fine
I'm pressurization my mouth
I mean
it should be fine not salmon
and I'm not sure it was there because I
didn't count
because I thought this game was going to
be more consistent but apparently not
there we go that's step one
that I now he's doing red
nice nice I'm not sure why you're
cutting that more often
Snapchat I pushed it down I was doing
right
yes now now it's doing yellow
because it wasn't that you know
why is it so hard to know as long as I
aggressive he doesn't have
but it's definitely right now now it's
been red again
red is harmless
yep
oh
oh the game's doing that while the game
is away
the game is over
I'm not going to continue
[Music]
so that's that
and moving on to
the rain again
so
here are all the
My Links
I should I did remember this time
