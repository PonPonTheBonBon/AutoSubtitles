more than

that I hope the volume is good

well type A is

fine screen placement is fine I assume

it looks fine on stream there's a a

slight black bar at the top and bottom

but that's just

to not have any blur going

on stere sound we're in the future with

stereo this end this will start a game

I'm going to have to punish you now H

[Music]

punishment what is

this B

spell I I should should have had um the

prediction with this I do I'll do a very

quick prediction while I'm reading your

comments very very quick

prediction I'll say this 30 minutes

because I can stop the timer whenever I

want

okay I need to get this steam version

I'm pretty sure we talked about

the yeah yeah think about because the

steam version is um is the Remake the

steam version uh is the Wii version of

the first game where they have placed a

few assets because the Wii version when

they remade it they

also changed a few things like for

example Clo's outfit and then they

replaced it back with with

a and then in the latest version which

is the Wii version they redesigned the

outfit back to how it looked in the PS1

version

instead and there's a few other assets

they've also modified to look more like

PS1 that they for some reason changed

the

wi I do want to play that version two

just to see the differences and see what

because although H already have played

the Wii version so i' technically

already play that

version

um so but it

has so since I played both the PS1 and

the Wii version before it was a long

time ago and for what I remember the Wii

version has improved certain things the

slight game to play tweaks makes it a

bit nicer to

play just felt better to play even

though the PS1 version is pretty good as

it

is Joker is that a sinly wi Alias for

the

Joker I mean yeah in some some accent Al

when to say joker there will be

Joker I

guess I think in German when it ends

with

the sound not sound but spelling it

Chang to an a sound

Jo oh I hate this speech the bad guy's

voice is a

bit

crashed he's so so bit

crushed yeah I guess on the

PlayStation in the yeah in the Wii

version I also have options to use

English voices or the this made

fictional

language that clo gu is definitely in

the

m a tomato

scorpion yeah I don't know what that is

it has a very sick tail ball on the tail

very sick body very very very sick arm

there anyway or

something okay now I need to move back

on the

way and um Nick is of course

[Music]

key

but piga is still I think it's an older

term for young lady which is still the

case in

[Music]

Danish

so so it could also be like a

key

uh young

[Music]

lady

[Music]

Maiden yeah the key

Maiden if key in this complex even is

the same kind of

[Music]

key don't know because it could be an

old term like for something it could

also be

can I go down

it could be

a of um existing

like uh ter from another language where

they might use the word key for multiple

things that was easy no no

dangerous area that results in a lot of

[Music]

deaths and yeah there's a lot of like

temporary platforms that are you guys

going to stand now and watch

and and watch your house

explod oh now you guys action I'm

learning cut scene by talking over

area where they go bad quality just just

a slight zoom in of the

camera

do mean there we go now zoom in and zoom

out they didn't consider someone

standing here I don't know seems like an

oversight I like

soay I

don't I mean I'm actually like

naughty I found the blue

or

let ah I found the wimp all right okay

let's go to Red Door first

[Music]

then oh you're jumping through the fire

creepy

there we go finally let's look at them

yeah they they are bathing in the lava

and apparently s is the French word for

sun yep I recognize that because I

wanted

to oh here we

go I wanted to make a character

named

the

uh I want a character named Luna but

since the character was based I need

something they went up again

annoying yeah I'm curious about

that wow now it now it's that

I wasn't prepared I was I was unprepared

for I came

unprepared there we

go I didn't mean to jump

down

yeah I can

I

again I slightly

burnt yay there we

go let's see if I can find a blue

[Music]

worm

so I guess I just walk the other way

then has the

[Applause]

H yep here go the

War I because the gate to the blue orb

to the Red Orb getting close I couldn't

go back I couldn't go back and pick up

the to War and the wait there was a

missing po on

there W but attacked

enies still haven't done that I

think wa w w oh there

again

no the BL fell

down and

across here enemy shows up and takes the

or back without Mission again yeah who's

going to stop the eny from doing

that

and without permission too how D

they no good thing I had that

oh speaking of good

same

one of the first things I wanted to add

to my stream was

confetti also secr can

[Music]

think oh what's is

fine there we

go

I didn't mean to move that much

forward yeah yeah so I assume if I pick

this up it's going to close the gate yep

so when I pick up the blue one I'm not

going allowed to go back and pick up the

red

one so that can't can't hold more than

one orb at a

time get rid of you

what there you go you are rescued I'm

about to

die the blue orb is

back I hope they are proud of me

now

yay

[Music]

naughty and we don't want them to get

naughty and I guess this platform is

also moving here not that and then it's

not allowing me to get back or

something so I can't get like go back I

can pick up the he so even even if I

found a way no it comes back okay fine

enough I'll take it back then I was

going to say even if I found a way to

get to back from the blue or red

orb one of those people wouldn't even

let me go back anyway but apparently it

does let me go

back princess over analyzing the game as

that's that's what I

did that oh excuse

a single one it has been licked by Pon

pom but I I I assume that's

[Music]

fine

not

trying no wait I should go

down there was nothing

there I take Pizza Hello Dragon is still

around I mean yeah

ah left a

No it should be a wait I didn't even

start did I start

next oh yeah did

start we don't have many points not many

people participating in

the in the

[Music]

next F enough

like only the notan is being part of the

predictions at the

moment perfectly fine it's day if you if

you have if you if you think it's

funny sadly I can't partake in the

prediction well for two reasons kind

[Music]

of uh three reasons

actually um I still forgot I bring it I

can't partake in it because I don't

actually have points I have an infinite

amount of points but Infinity is

actually not in

value so I don't actually have any

points to

spend the second reason is because I am

the one actually playing the game so you

could say that I am

rigging the results by doing it in a

certain way like for example taking an

extra damage at the end just no no I

supposed to go

down and the third reason is that H

someone who has not been taking part in

the prediction has to select the

result

and

[Music]

and if I take part in the

prediction and all the mods which have

the right to take part of the prediction

do take that means that no one is aable

to select that

result the gold one gives you three

hearts I need one en that's to

be

no no no

[Music]

no there we go now I just need to be

[Music]

quick well I didn't mean to switch that

one but

sure so there we

go don't say I'm not good to

you yeah recomend you're

good I didn't know I'm probably hungry

enough to eat a chip that has been laked

by a bunny yeah wouldn't it's like you

read it by not taking damage at the end

of that last

[Music]

fight well I did take one damage what

are you talking about I wish I could

stay longer but back work go I'll be

back if you're still on while I will

actually stop streaming St where am I

going where am I

we I need that enemy to jump up on that

place have

just accidentally killed it

apparently

finally how that happen somehow they

collide with each

other and I didn't like jumped down and

just

exploded yeah somehow the enemies

collided which is

already

[Music]

somehow somehow

somehow there's one Gap left so assume

I'll open the next door and have to

previously it was three

hearts I can pick it up I mean the only

reason why I come back is

while too I like been there like a few

times uh

yeah but to be fair I've been on your

stream quite a lot and just was a while

prediction it's

simply how many times I will take damage

this boss so now I'm prepared for what

attacks it does what bunny don't forget

to predict you

too are you excited about the idea about

licking

feet Oh My Oh

My My My Stream is turning into a face

about inflation so I mean I shouldn't be

surprised at this

point oh I already yeah I didn't show up

tell well we got three + one four people

have predicted whoa whoa whoa that's a

lot of

points no one else want want to go for

another one I think four people have uh

18 plus stream so sure I'm I'm not too

picky about the

content and let's go you prct it too

[Music]

slippery yeah it's a bit tricky to come

more come on come on come on no I missed

I

[Music]

predictions I should

[Music]

[Applause]

here thanks bu Hy Che

yeah

mying I'm making

mistakes there we

go I got

one

well don't fall enough

[Applause]

good

take the tough ones get of the tricky

ones no I was

flying cheating

[Music]

one no I destroyed all of them stop

attacking you didn't do the attack last

time I did

that cheater the

cheating one pun for

president I could even phras that in

Spanish I know that's like an

English very

common like English phrase person for

Road actually don't know

how how you would normal phrase there

you go now I did it in like three hits

taking three

hits

died wait there a no it is not a face

this is wait there is a third

place all smarts

yeah

one anyway let's start the nexted while

there is a dialogue if there is another

round hello hello po nice way to stop

by p i p I guess

some but pon pon is already a princess

yeah P Pon for

princess Fon is Queen of

Sweden I wish I was the queen of Sweden

yay hey I finally did

it hey is everybody

right now all of us will hide here these

platform should protect

us gu we have no

Choice Dam down here when the time is

[Applause]

[Music]

right okay so

yeah yeah let me take a quick look at

uh what how

the

how

the let

me quickly see how cuz I haven't even s

the

much I even which such

just

I guess I guess I guess that works so

but now

yeah uh I guess you got to do two

options J bir games thank you for

following

whoops I wasn't following somehow how

D what's up well I mean it's more funny

to follow someone while they're

streaming right that was that was that

was your intention right what's up

everything is all right I'm finishing

off cloa which I started

today so um doing a prediction for how

many times I'll will take damage for

presumably the certain Final Phase that

doesn't mean it's the Final Phase

you can you free to put in some points

if you want and um I had to look up how

to say p Pon for

president and so that is pon pon as

president or well I guess pon pon for

president

H but I am the princess here so I

wouldn't be the president anyways

so so it looks

like

we so got one person two people have put

in prediction so far and feel free to

put

ined otherwise I'll just and H stop the

prediction accepting process and then I

mean um but yeah thank you for there we

go now we have people predicting we have

three people predicting So

Far So yeah so s is a perfect Run 1 to

two is a little damage 3 to five is more

damage but still not d de because you

have six hit points in the game six plus

is that I will

fail and then we defeat it in a later

later

on and another rule I always run with if

no one is a winner so if one of the

option which have zero people predicting

is the correct answer I will refund All

Points because I don't what want to just

throw white points I do know I do know

some streamers do that but I don't want

to just throw away points I'd rather

someone get the

points

so well everyone happy well someone's oh

yeah we got four people voting now I

guess everyone's happy now thank you

everyone for taking part oh no we got

more we got more people putting a

point everyone happy now let's are you

ready let's go and see how it goes so

this is kind of like first phase but the

boss is probably going to make any even

more trickier attacks or

something okay let's do this let's do

this let's get the move

on

out no I

[Music]

missed wait oh there

there's speaking of the that was also

attacking the

first no did I no I missed good

questions know an nor Enemy No I was

paying attention to the armor enemy wait

did I start with full health of course

not well it was number of damage anyway

so it doesn't

[Music]

matter I took one hit point I should

have reset my house I thought about

[Music]

that wait you're not hiding anymore you

said you going to

[Music]

hide there you

go but I haven't had trouble keeping

track of how many points

my there you go nice I got the little

loed and I avoided that

attack Oh no you're removing a lot of

platforms

now no

[Music]

uned I got two canons

left

[Music]

one Cannon

[Applause]

n

wellow no no no no no no no no

no

no

no the that they taking

damage but does the death count

as that was never established does this

count as taking one

[Music]

[Music]

damage that's why I should have reset

the house but yeah keep forgetting St

stuff I don't know there never been EST

staish I know is the prediction invalid

now well I'll take damage once and I buy

once when I di due to an attack so I

mean I would count this one

[Music]

[Music]

one

[Music]

go

oh yeah I got

it was that all cannons

yes when I took damage once died once

and the that is still one too the

regardless how we count

[Music]

it put me on a wind shoot me in

another but but what will happen to you

don't worry when all be together we have

to win with both of our strengths

combined I

understand mean you keep shooting H into

every

enemy

5 Five Points I had

18K why did you put everything into a

one hey no one voted for one two so no

one wins the points you get you get

refunded regardless how we want so if I

had reset it I

would yeah death was never as damage I

know but so sorry guys I died I took

damage

once I guess even if I did even if I

reset it and did yeah regardless

everything

isless so you're going to make this boss

fat yeah inflate

everything so you get everything

[Music]

back going inflate everything and

everyone it's harmless

right Mom Dy Thea Le LEF LEF maybe it's

LEF I a Le all this

Kingdom

but we can see each other soon

right we can play together just like

before you're actually you

really you don't really exist in this

world

what I call you from your words so we

could restore the balance of Dreams

what are you talking about it's

true this world is not your

reality

no but I remember

everything the first time I met you play

with you they they're fake memories that

I made you believe

[Music]

them it's

the it's

not it's the

[Music]

truth that strange dream God spoke of

your presence in nor is like a strange

dream

no left sing have S to R new the

world you won't be able to stay in this

world

sorry I don't have the

emotions no I'm not going anywhere I'm

[Music]

stay well

I but

[Music]

I let the Cene place for

[Music]

itself

[Music]

[Music]

oh

[Music]

spee

[Music]

la la la la la la la la la

[Music]

la no more CL

game

um they couldn't even kill him why

didn't kill him I didn't pay attention

apparently GG Pap sound like you

being that's my voice acting I was

actually voice acting I tried my

best the

emotions my precious

hi so

shine hi the sum of letter unique script

a lot of scripts they share some

[Music]

symbols

[Music]

so but uh the the script apparently goes

left to right but they still read the

book right to left which is a bit

[Music]

weird I do know that H some or maybe

Most Japanese books goes right left but

that is because the text is

written right to left it's written top

to bottom right left but it it still

goes right to left in general read

diretion therefore the book goes right

left but this book is Left Right now the

book goes right left but the text that's

aitd anyway enough s the script

someone another you saw is

a that's a

snake I do wonder if it's just a cipher

of a Japanese text and if and that you

could

just get this back to Japanese and get

an actual text from

it but that's probably easier to do in

remake with high quality because a lot

of this is just blurry

snake I there's a lot of text that's off

screen too Al the remix should be white

screen I don't even know if this is the

ending if in

[Music]

there

[Music]

[Music]

p

[Music]

p or

your

Phantom or phantomile or

Phantom I never foret figure out how it

was

pronounced after almost 5 hours well I

could have split it up in two streams

but same that sounds

[Music]

good I still haven't completed 100% so I

guess that's for tomorrow

then there are bonus bonus levels too

but maybe that's so now I can

select just jumps are all over the

place

yeah I do have to rescue so I

got one missing here

here

here here yeah so I'm not missing many

of them Al Another uh difference here

every each of these is zero uh what

because when you replay a level you

basically just doing it exact same level

as you did through the story uh what

they fixed in the Wii ver version was

that they did track they did because so
