welcome

yeah this game doesn't have any many

music

if you want to translate it

you want egg to be translated in Swedish

I guess that's fine

I mean this is an 18 plus Channel I

think I think those words are fine as

long as you don't get scary as long as

you don't get the descriptive

it's it's always a fun joke

Okay so

you want egg to be translated Swedish

well the Swedish word for egg

can I

yeah I can reply to this one is

egg

that's a Swedish word eggy

how many

quite different

so let's pick this whole thing on screen

with this one

oh

what is it oh no no no spanning

correctly there you go now apparently

not

why is it messing with me like this

like why does it

no I don't want to move

like why why does why does obvious want

to leave like one pixel

there we go

what's wrong with obvious

obviously I don't want like a one pizza

yep

I hope things are well it's it's uh it's

complicated let's let's say oh yeah go

north east when I was going to do now

yeah yeah and welcome wait what that's

that's a that's a fun fun you have day

hello hello h

is your is your nickname age

wholesome age I guess

I have saying that with Finnish

pronunciation is quite different

Aggie I don't know how to say to finish

what kind of game this is yeah well

let's let's go north and see

shakespeased as coffee

complications egg whites you you are

eight you are wholesome that means

you're not broken

so here's the map

and now we got some music too

so uh in this game you have this three

plus signs that mean

Point them out just so we should we talk

about the same thing

it's it's one there one there and one

there

those are three buildings that each

one of them contains a flag

and uh

and it's apparently a Quantum flag it

only appears in the last one you break

not not like if you have like eight or

more or something like that in that case

it might not appear in the last one

how did I play this game this is how I

play in this game

and yeah and then you have

remember for it before it

and then you have these towers trying to

shoot you down I've been calling them

flowers I don't know if that's quite

funny

and then you have

no I'm not too far forward no

I didn't even destroy the building I

lost the helicopter

all right have you checked uh the outfit

suggestions yes I think I did that

I might not have at least

uh

yes I think I did that this is

the digital worldly order

demon MC

m not the same system

yes it's an interesting outfit

and I would

maybe do that

um

very awesome everyone has a huge cat

oh oh yeah yeah

oh yeah you like you like this carrot it

is a huge carrot

you can hold it in your hands

so I can point

that's very obvious okay let me try that

again

and it was just a warm-up

and now I'm being followed

get away from me

let's shoot it how do I shoot for right

there so it should work

no

there we go

take some damage from the head

[Music]

huh

why am I shooting forward Ah that's fine

I'm pressing drone button

I'm silly

did you say

that's why I couldn't destroy anything

before

there you go

now that I know the controls Bay

now this is so many Towers here

I might actually be able to destroy

something here

oops nope

anyway there's nothing in that

okay

oh it's from the PS1 I don't even played

on that console marketing day yes it's

some

it's a it's an old piece it's like

actually I don't know what what in this

game is on PS1

windows and the 3DO

and um

the studio is the worst version I think

the places version seems to be the best

version which is kind of odd because I

would assume the PC version would be the

best version

um

what I'm going the wrong way

this PC usually aren't so limited

performance wise

I don't know it's an olden days PC games

might not have been good at that time

not by me I'm just an

Brown helicopter that should be dumb

just because I'm Brown

Clips I saw that coming

where am I going

[Music]

I mean I should have painted the

helicopter green or something yeah I

think in here and there it is

I'm destroying everything except the

required building

okay

that was a failure

you said everything except the building

good game and when they call this game

you hit but they're showing

so how am I supposed to get to this then

maybe I shouldn't have them

okay I'll move in with

they have a vehicle and then I just

destroy everything

pew pew pew pew

I got to get a lesson plan gaming but I

will be back what

too much trees that's good results the

trees

so this is

get through this

I think I only need to shoot three times

on this

is a strong

good girl

and you know get the freaky signing

oh wait I'm under attack

it should be a pause button I think

destroy I guess that's the point

green doesn't really hide you well

against this guy yeah but if I were

green they wouldn't cheat me because Sky

camera because they shoot me because I'm

Brown

she mod the game I make myself pink

and then we'll shoot me because I'm pink

because I'm cute and they can't handle

that

I'm not just gonna go in here in the

story I'm saying you destroyed all my

helicopters so I'm going to destroy all

new towers

that's something you can do things here

that's that's what we're going to do

they just so you just want to do war

crimes and pretend it's difficulties

peaceful and peaceful tank yeah

okay I'm not used to the machine to kill

yeah like

it's going to take some Millions but

that's not the correct term here oops

take too much demos

yeah I'm gonna nothing

one more try

like I'm it's not like I'm shooting

let's destroy more trees here

creating yeah

infantry I think that's the term

it's not like I'm killing infantry with

this vehicle

yes you can drink a bit more there

I didn't really need to destroy that

yeah and that's all the buildings and

stuff be

because I'm not

I'm not evil

or am I

thank you

let's get rid of that

I can move through here a bit easier oh

mine

shut down the wall I wanted to shoot

down there

oh look they're helping me

oh I mean there we go

they're trying to shoot me

rude

no I'm stuck

I'm stuck again stop [ __ ] me

I need to get rid of this thing

getting stuck on it

here we go

everything good for you

probably is going to steal some of you

fuel

you don't mind

I wish I could get some

Munitions here and now now we have the

music

hey

exciting then I died

but I don't know how where am I going

I'm going up there

but yeah you can see where the light

starts on those at towers and I kind of

kind of I'm kind of moving my way in

there

slowly

some good old-fashioned people here

you know you wouldn't expect a Pom-Pom

playing a war game

but yeah

this game is not rated

that should really

do something like that

no

and I don't like how you try to shoot me

there we go

living outside

come on come on come on

there we go

and let's move back

it's going to

destroy some more trees

and I mean this should

oh no wait

I

I spelled some

okay

let me get back into the door

I mean usually just play

racial working what

I've been getting where someone tries to

get all ranks under control oh yeah yeah

you mean like that yeah and I never gets

into any man

I guess there's a war between the

different races

I guess

I wish some of the tracks were a bit

louder in this game

some of them can be quite

um

was confused about that they meant to

say yeah

I was a bit confused too

but it is correct

here we go

president

how many Minds

yeah I'm gonna crush your bushes too

it was kind of magnificent yes

so I'm just going to move up here to

destroy the

the building so you know that the flag

is not here

look a nice

oh no

too much

as much peop let me just destroy this

not g

there's no flying in that so now we can

move out this game

that means that there's only one

okay now that means there's only one

buildings building left which that the

flag can be in and now it is forced to

be in that building

all right let's move on

now the music is

it's going to move down

well mine to pass the road

because we have this

that mine is a bit scary though

it wasn't more stuff can happen

at me

take care of these

say what is your birthday you are the

only streamer playing this game oh yeah

yeah I play gonna

play some rare games sometimes with

repeated so I've been the only stream

and playing some games

but I guess it's kind of fun

or it's no one would really find me

through I have to do this in that case

if I'm the only one playing it

but

it's funny

I'm not seeing this game in so long

still I had to see oh do you have the

PS1 version

I did play the demo on the PC I don't

exactly remember

what I got demo from

okay there we go

it's going to make the opening bigger

well someone's trying to shoot me

get out of here oops I started uploading

[ __ ] it

on your kind of fun I'm happy that you

think so

I'm this tank is a bit quicker too

so yeah I'm I'm happy

you find me funny I'm here to be funny

so

one time in there

is not going to get me

and then just move on here

I should be able to get through there

with

the final vehicle in the end

and then I

just need to destroy this place

whoops those are my whoops

mistakes were made

this is giving flashbacks to all the all

the games that played as a young in good

times I do want to play a lot of old

games

a little bit more more old games

there's like uh

this this uh this is a old game which if

I recall correctly it's called the pod

that's that's the full name of the game

just pod

pod

I don't remember what a

I know it's for Windows

and I don't remember

it was part of some kind of Windows 95

Odyssey

demo

collection

and it was a weird game

to play too

maybe that came with it no no wait maybe

that game was completely so yeah I think

it was the full game it was not the demo

of the game

but let me kill that game and it was a

it was a racing game

stuck

I live in category there's this trash

but the music is a certain we have all

the powers gone

and they've got this flag now we can

play the

but I can't use this one to get the

flags I need to move back

can't you understand

we're back to the intense music okay I'm

gonna use up this tank on this mine

pop the person managing the vehicles

don't mind that

um

back before modern day practice and

monetization I mean I'm playing Modern

games

without any

bad

practices I guess

I don't know I mean sure I played the

remix of Spyro and crash but then I

played crash four

the modern games are played

wait I'm supposed to go here

I don't play a lot of modern games to

prepare maybe that's why

I play a lot of old games

I got black

it's a weird game this

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

stealing the green flag

[Music]

and victory it's just stopping the music

before playing the

internet

here with the

Victory there is a lot of public domain

content onions

music video and just put everything

together

and

play the game

that took 90 minutes

okay or for some reason you can't save

unless you wait there for a moment I

just hit that

moving on to the next World of lemons oh

bloodshot or blood's hot considering the

spacing of the thickness

nice job and fun hello Marco

into emanators might be a fun stream if

I get back in the Stream

how many

they're up there it looks like they

could put more Flags but for some reason

they haven't then if there are four

places

I don't know I don't know if there's

like less places for Flags in the p

PlayStation version

I actually got the whole basic

and you yeah

ammunition does help like I got a uh

genuine PS3 wish I could run the game on

and it would run with less stalker I

guess

but

it just wouldn't look as nice come on

come on no I'm missing him

I win so that's for you to use the

helicopter

okay

Christian

hello fun so again about yesterday I

hope I assuming is going away what

don't be sorry

and yeah I I think you said that you

have watched me stream before but I

didn't recognize your name

and but I didn't want to say anything

but uh yeah according to Twitch you

never written anything and that's why I

didn't recognize you

hey Sarah hello

hello

don't be sorry

too far forward

one more one more get out of here

happy birthday make mistake yeah I mean

it happens

[Music]

and I would be a hypocrite if I were

were to be upset about someone else

doing a mistake or related to me because

I made so many mistakes

[Music]

oh here it is

[Music]

come on come on come on oh the flag no

what is this

that's not that's not what it's supposed

to be

something is wrong

move back to base

I'm confused

well

this is a bit confusing

so I guess we need at least three places

it's always in the third one you destroy

but if it's four places it might appear

in this other one

which which someone could interpret as

meaning that it always appears in the

third one regardless of any there are

but there are levels with one and two

and our potato level will be like 20

places

and it did not appear in the same one am

I even moving on my way back home

[Music]

all right I haven't lost one of my bases

this isn't good

I think I'm moving out to sea now and

I'm losing

I'm losing fuel quickly

may they may they will love you

where

Willow field oh no

it exploded

okay by the way fun have you looked at

my office yeah I just I just told you I

have looked at it yes I saw that you

made a suggestion and I will consider

making that it's it's not it's not going

to be high priority

I will focus on the automatics I'm more

excited about of course but I do want to

make more outfits that other people

suggest

uh like I'm going to do like cheerleader

princess and mate

like that and probably in the end like

the Bianca's outfit

and other characters

doing it basically

yeah I'm interested I mean honest you're

paying me I can consider doing internet

yes

okay let's let's move in and destroy

everything

I don't usually chance so you wouldn't

have seen me around yeah that's fine uh

I have

I have up while I do my college

workmaster ah

I appreciate that you enjoy watching my

streams that means a lot to me

and yeah it's perfectly fine if you

don't watch chat

oh sorry about that

no that's true you're hungry is that me

they're here what have you guys done to

you

nothing that's why that's that's what

totally did not destroy your building

that did not happen

ing

okay that didn't count

come on

they're weird

come on now

okay

okay I'm trying to move on here oh no

they're coming

thank you

what do you have more and I'm not a

drunk I can't I can follow roast I just

choose not to you okay I don't even know

where I'm supposed to go

why did I attack the wrong one but the

attack the one that is not attacking me

wait yeah where am I attacking the one

that is not attacking me and not the one

that did you attack me I think I should

move up

yeah I think I think it's up here

did it

no it's not okay

okay so I need to move through

I should have paid my attention to the

map I need to move through this area

I think

yeah let's get rid of these

these

and then we got some munition yeah

there's the bridge

I definitely need more ammunition here

don't mind me

when did music go it's ran off the music

in this game so weird

oh oh they're trying to shoot me no I

got stuck don't shoot me don't shoot me

I got stuck again

God they shot the tree and that one shot

at three too no

I switched it doesn't that sounds very

appropriate anymore

okay I'm gonna use the tank to clean out

a bit more

yeah I mean if if pon pon puts on a

swimsuit and goes out to war and all the

opponents will be so distracted

or enemies might be the mere correct

word it would be so distracted by upon's

outfit so they wouldn't be able to

attack one

you're fighting here a peach I mean

every level it's like a peach it's like

you're doing a vacay in a tank

I would be oh yeah

a lot of people with are distracted by

pumpkin in a swimsuit to be fine

I'm ramming my tank into the building

well if we act like a mine outside a

building that does not sound safe

okay so far it looks safe to drive

through with that

the EPA

did just one Fitbit over here

we go

at least fully destroy this

girl now a Jeep can run through here

let's save something

let's fast travel back home

needs to be prepared for those water

operations yeah

that's fine

instruction is definitely low on this

top targets yeah of course I mean if you

if you destroy pump on with the swimsuit

you're no longer having an appointment

in swimsuits that would be terrible

then again Pawn is low on set at least

the first place

kids

I got the plank

move out

move home

this was actually a bit simple now

the previous one game beats more of a

challenge

we'll see we'll see what the other

levels have to offer

[Music]

that was coin today

they sure have built these roads in 19

degree turns it's almost like it's a

green based system

[Music]

when I was and because they basically so

far for all the levels of planes so far

they only have two different videos yeah

it's the same media so I will skip if it

has the same menu

this is the new password remember it

it ish a clever butterfly bird and a

heart

I don't know if you if you want to

unlock it this is the password

but but again

I don't know if you're going to play

this game and that's password is only

for the PlayStation version they have

different passwords I know this 3D out

version has a different password I

haven't actually never playing the PC

version

okay let's check them out

oh this looks pretty simple

so I will go down south and then we'll

move my way up

North

East

do you remember moving the wrong way

helicopter you're going down

we're going down and slowing the

helicopter when it loses house or

if you want

and the building is here somewhere

there's the building

we start the building they start

building thank you

okay

so next one I should

like moves through a passage and at

least move East so Southeast First

through the passage and then just moving

East

or something

foreign

game

the the plank does not appear in the

last building anymore

um

this is going to be a bit tricky or it

is they could have randomized the

location of the flag and I've always got

the magic at the last position every

time

that's true

well

I guess I'll move in with a heavy a

heavy heavy then I like how this game

plays the like the first for the music

but it does play different song

depending on the vehicle

no I don't want to destroy the the way

what is 3D Towers which in turn will

destroy the door

it's going to move in here

it's going to move through here don't

mind me

don't see my Towers

this isn't good

to get destroyed here

we go let's

I know all right I made mistakes

hello Abby man

I'm not doing that great at the moment

I'm getting destroyed

okay

getting a bit destroyed

all right who are you trying to shoot

let me just get rid of this building

I think it looks ugly

moves through here

where am I okay there is one over here

okay I'm not exactly sure where I'm

supposed to go I should have paid more

attention to the map

again no need to destroy the door

come here yes help me take down that

Tower thank you

it's a bit tricky to get through here

I'm just going to destroy

everything

oh no

get out of here

okay

unless it's just a little damaging

hammer

am I even going the right way

I don't know

yeah I'm running out of ammo

I think this is the right way

thank you

oh no I'm actually out of the family now

what I guess I'll just move home then

yes it's moving home

the amazing can very

intense

[Music]

and then it just ends the music doesn't

even Loop

and I guess it's fitting because I'm

actually moving home now

then I can check the map

no I want to move that there we go

okay I'm kind of moving the correct way

I think

it looks like it

so uh

all this continue

no more haircut I do

but I know where I know my flag is so

I'm just going to clean out the way

hey hey what's up bunny

I don't think I'm going to chat about

you Tower

oh let's not kill some civilians not

let's not kill the Infantry

there's casual okay

thank you

destroying everything

okay let's get rid of you

not mine what sorry I need to get you

here

see I didn't turn anyone away

because

am I good

heavy armored vehicle

yeah fighting Pines did destroy towering

moving around in the morning we've got

the next one

I was cleared out this area

rid of that

I just need to clear out this side yes I

can move in with it cheap

oh I survive that do you have something

more here yes

and I'm out of the family again

because anything is almost destroyed

anyway

let's get rid of it

let's just get rid of it

now let's see if I can pick up the flank

really really really

soon that

then

maybe I want to destroyed building so I

can

now he's not trying to have the mine

oh

stupid Billy get out of the way

go

there was no one in this building so it

was fine excuse me

as well

okay one more try

really really really really really

thank you

you have that three

it's a bit tricky to get around with the

Jeep so many buildings everywhere

Jim should that first person do you mode

that would be fun

we got plank

[Music]

well

got the flag

my view you even said excuse me and they

still destroyed your Jeep yeah

right to be excused I wasn't excused

oh I forgot about that mine but it was

safe

I'm waiting [ __ ] are you trying to stop

me from taking the flank is that it

[Music]

well

[Music]

Brown tin wings

visit Pan versus green same meaning

again

took 11 minutes and four seconds

come on and then we've been a bit

quicker if it wasn't for that you read

one

shoots me now oh do you want me to city

but don't shoot me

ga

or the name of a lemon

what do we have now

dude more places now

actually and that wasn't the menu I

wanted going this seems a bit incident

for some reason

all right let's um

yes it could

I mean

technically

okay one one down

As you move on

[Music]

come on

there we go

let's repair the helicopter

and let's move on wait I should check

the map

pretty Stark and repair helicopter

I think the game would be a bit more

challenged if you couldn't prepare by

going home

how they're doing like no no vehicle

lost challenge would be much more

difficult

okay nothing in that one

okay

this one I got out of there without

taking much damage

where are the rest of these

that was that one that's one I only

destroyed it's not my knee as I'm

passing through

yeah

licking smirking point

yeah I think I should have checked them

up or something

again I lost its moment

[Music]

I'm back home anyway let me check them

out that did not go

[Music]

well that's not nibbling that's that's

licking

uh it was nice girl

okay okay let's go noise

and that's why I couldn't find anything

wait this isn't North

probably not gonna move north enough

yeah LPA should be yeah here it is

forward

oh

when

and now where it is now

unless I'm

forgetting about the place

is up there

so I guess I'll move in with a heavy

vehicle now

what should I try with helicopter I mean

I can't do this

[Music]

but so much for this plan

[Music]

all right

[Music]

10 countries

no shooting mine

thank you

more effort than he did too

yeah I'm shooting everywhere okay that

was a bad idea that you know

last moment

[Music]

maybe because I intended to move in with

like at least at least a bit of three

Minds I guess that's something

slowly moving

all right let's get rid of these things

yeah

and we're Inc back what did I miss yeah

I completed some missions I guess since

I've never played in the nine eight nine

eight

nine eight time it's difficult for me to

find out how to count the beans in the

right

of Valkyries

pause the check okay

great okay

um

I'll hydrate while I'm riding

here we go I hydrated it I'm sitting up

straight

okay and you go

um

hello red

sorry we bought I had to get rid of I I

I guess he worked as a painting

build this red paint on the ground

there you go

they're going back in

holy

night

[Music]

oh they're shooting at me

out of here

and that's not good they don't like me

using that there

feel

apparently

that was just gonna be quiet

hello to everyone

I'm here it is although I play this yeah

now because it's playing this music it

should restart the

vehicle music okay okay

I guess there's no vehicle I'm using now

right

yeah I basically just need to get rid of

that I can do it with a helicopter that

can then move in with the Jeep

one just count nine b nine beats

permission

good

again

you're an island or ads

[Music]

I can't write the ads command now

we're trying to reverse

hmm

okay

um

can I do that

um I'll try I'll try I can do it I

believe in myself

I got rid of most of these things though

and I think that counts right

more flights

the Jeep is flying through the roads

lines like a bumblebee

okay

so

um

you know what

I'm not taking any risk anymore

okay no more hits

like I had three Egypt fine

last one

yeah I didn't mean to shoot the house

don't be angry at me it was an accident

okay

accidents happened

tricky there we go I need the old one's

not tricky

here we go

see if it's free not getting destroyed

I can't count tonight oh you can't get

denied I can count to 19.

but it's still difficult to imagine

playing the notes

10998 means questions are two pieces

that have won

but no sir yeah but I mean

in six eight the water notes or two

Beats

I'm silly I'm still like curious if it's

if it would be easier to just ignore the

whole second part of the

that's that's the thing I still don't

understand

it's like

nine beats per measure

I guess you don't understand

but that's just

yeah yeah

that that does make sense

you can understood

but yes

thank you

let's clear off this and let's get rid

of this stupid thing

shh

wait why did I get squished by uh

now ask question

excuse me

so who's through that was it deal with

you anyway

we actually got

another stupid Tower here

go

and destroy everything

I will destroy every single piece of

water now

if you're not going to stop me

I'm gonna destroy these buildings

I'm gonna start this building too

and this building and this building and

I accidentally started building and

gives me more ammunition which I need

if I'm going to destroy more things here

we're going to store this I'm going to

destroy these I'm even going to store

this Tower

we're going to start this we're going to

start that and I'm out of ammo

Powell

I guess I'm not destroying anything

anymore

because accidentally destroy the

building that gives me mission

Community enjoying the music yes

no it's actually restarted it does

actually look it's just a joy

so quite

look at that what's what kind of

building is this

you know what

this building is ugly too

I feel like going back

I don't need to

without feeling like doing it

oh no I'm actually out of you

this isn't good

actually I just actually need to refill

that here

yeah no no the warning

no field warning it wasn't warning of

death on the helicopter

oh

someone's moving in

there we go

let me just fill up the tank in peace

thank you very much

okay

now

now

even going to throw some of these

streets which is apparently very hard

yes intensive music

let's go

do

you need something I read whatever I

done to them

destroy everything

even the trees

when they come back here they're going

to be so confused

excuse me where do you come from

foreign

come on

where do you come from

oh oh and all right that's enough

I may see this doing everything

let's get rid of this thing is so broken

anyway

yay let's move in with the Jeep now

I'm happy with how much I destroyed

I just started almost everything wait a

minute I forgot just one fancy

yeah no that was pause button

there we go look at look at the map look

at where flag is this is

there's a bit stuck left there on the

top right beside the flag but

it's so brilliant out nothing left

destroy the evidence of something

destroy the evidence into Martin

oh yeah yeah I'm dumping the vehicle in

the water no one knows what's this okay

what has happened here

I'm not responsible for them at least

I'm just a peaceful Jeep

is moving through the rubble

because I've caused all of these damage

so

crazy

whoa

I got the flag I was so such that I

destroyed this up there I wonder what

happened

[Music]

all right

this is in the way back home

[Music]

I don't think this is the way back home

where am I going

this is it seems to be quickly

well

I didn't mean to turn

[Music]

well

peaceful honking

yes I'm using the

the main instrument of the tank to honk

yes

how long did that take not only only 19

minutes I when it said shoot me now so I

guess I

shot a lot of stuff

we destroyed so much

lost keys

um interesting name

starting in mid position

there's been a female swear start is not

in the middle

or do you like the bottom part there

okay let's

let's see what they can do oh I got two

buildings

a watchtower not bad

is all we need and uh on a underground

base I guess this is tea

garage

I don't know how you say that word

move out no no no no no no no

Pips

okay 109 didn't mean to do that

one

Let's uh

laughs

move up and

[Music]

it seems

they were signing up here

is in here yes it's in here

okay fine let's move out

come where we'll start the place

[Music]

there's nothing here

oh I got hit

okay I'm actually lost

[Music]

thin

are they so

but at least I can go home again

if you love the helicopter

let's see okay there was on the right

track

if I go down instead of being a chance

for the flag to do this to spawn there

because it's the third one I'm

destroying

even though the second one had the flag

once it was confusing

oh I really wish it was in there because

I could probably just move downstairs

with the Jeep pick it up and move up

and a green team would not even notice

[Music]

[Music]

okay where's the uh okay here it is

so it must be in here though

I'm going

to happen maybe this

so I think I would want to really want I

think I think I know which parts I would

want to take which is deep

how do you use the helicopter's Rockets

I switch over to the rockets and use

them but they're slower

here

but I can use the Rockets if you want

this is just peaceful part of the island

they don't close as straight these do

not use a thread

okay the Rockets are slower I do wonder

which one has the higher damage per

second

that one could calculate that

the first bullets cause a fifth damage

uh the Rockets costs are third damage

there you go now is it

tell

because both three and five are prime

numbers that means that the weak bullets

cause three damage and the strong

bullets cause five damage

if you can't call the Rockets bullets

yeah I think I can move over here

so

yeah someone could

let me just take the speed of which

which they shoot them up

yes destroying some trees peacefully

definition of this

and this

Jeep chemistry here much easier these

rocks are going to be a problem

and then a Jeep oh sorry about this oh

wait this is the wrong place

that's

destroyed that thing

and I think

I think this is enough

stuck again

let's destroy this tank and move in with

the Deep

okay let's go

this is going to be the quickest runs

I'm going to buy more of those uh bonus

if I go on a special missions

my own hair the three jeeps and a and a

huge Minefield that was interesting

I want more of that

no don't pick it up

okay

I guess we're going this way now

that did not work as planned

we got ahead I have fun and good luck

thank you thank you for being here thank

you for chatting

been nice

says

I must go now my people need me it's

quite the opposite my people don't need

me anymore

I I know what I mean but

I must care why people don't need me

anymore

my mission here is done

I'm out

okay

okay

if that's what you want

if that's what you want

I will come up and

tell you

that I'm not okay with that

that was coin rude

I'm going to store some of your trees

thanks people are aquatic ah

now here we go destroy some of your

buildings

that's how upset I am

yeah those people are just going to swim

after in the ocean

oh boy

I am very upset about about these towers

now

double Crush

very upset about your behavior this is

not okay you understand that

you destroyed two of my jeeps now

well you're not certainly not helping

I'm committing it

and

you too I just wanted to finish this

level off quickly but no

my jeeps

and I'm very upset about that

very very upset

this is what you get

destroying every Tower I know

I don't need to destroy the other ones

but but still

oh and I'm out

from our lives of munition

and I'm out

I'm heading out into the water now

what's peaceful Jeeps exactly they were

not harming anyone

of course no damage

no harm is it through one hand grenade

at a bush I think

that was it

no other harm was caused

we can actually run over this with the

Jeep we can't turn out bushes so

which is why I destroy that

there we go

I got it let me see if I can move back

it was across here

[Music]

they're going to be right quick but

he would mean quicker if someone does

not decided to destroy my deep

rocking away

[Music]

face

who else

[Music]

I did it

I did it all of my all on my own

whoa

all right seeing this took almost 20

minutes come on say thank you

High Noon the next map looks real big

but this is kind of small map

a small map can could go rather quickly

quick this one too

yeah what are the the funny maps like

the the chess board the

the design field

I thought it would be much more of those

Maps

I should have put like at least one per

one per world

's too far

there we go

I don't know

stupid thing following me

now I don't even remember where I was

supposed to go

oh yeah

oops

oops

I did that

okay one more try

let's move up here

wow it's all already one day

come on come on

oh God he's my name

okay this is

no need to continue with this head coach

basically dead

[Music]

okay and then up to the left or

Northwest

or something

all right all right we're out

that one

boom Tower destroyed

well in that case it's only one location

left

and I guess I'll just need to

clear out the way

I got too much towers

that's all I get in my base

the bases are so different

it's afraid to destroy and stop

shooting

need to get rid of this one

come on

now I'm gonna destroy this building

since I took so much damage that I'm so

close to home I'm ready to go home and

repair

go

no laughing

and if we can go home and repair it they

should have like repair time or

something

that would make more sense than the

multiplayer game I guess

moving down

must really shoot you

there we go

I need to get through with the GPS so

open the doors

no

foreign

got stuck

what a winched

hmm

sleep on

contest oh no my chest

wait how are you sleeping on my chest I

understand okay

I'm sitting up

okay moving on

oh yeah it's up here okay so I need to

can I get rid of you what about you

to the teeth

and I don't want oh no you destroy the

tank

if you'll think

sorry people

wow

okay we're moving with the tank then

clean up the remaining

the remaining area

there you go

no this is supposed to tell me

here we go

let me get rid of the mines and they

don't cause any issues for your Jeep

and moving with the Jeep

you're going to move into the enemy base

you're gonna shoot down the towers

and we need to shoot down the towers and

shoot down the building to open up the

flag

you should then take the tank and run

over those mines to get rid of the mines

wait would that killed me yes it will

but it's for the green ticket

thank you

there we go

that's your dad

let's see

[Music]

[Music]

no good stuck

[Music]

that makes a bit more sense you could

like sit on top of my head while I'm

sitting here

meep

is that

or something

drawn by a quarter breaks

it's

confusion I'll let that release of

emotes that's a very good image

a list of people we could email

9 21 that's not high noon

oh it looks like I did all the tracks

levels Maps move on to the next one Boop

yeah that is

more personal

we got to believe Lucario has like white

hips my yellow tips actually

and a pink chest Chester

is green like the world

because in the infotech is from like

[Music]

I want a cookie we can get tiny oh you

map

I might have a special on this

Island bottom

on the top on the right side the right

side

yeah what's the

but this time these five locations

instead of like eight or whatever it was

and I completed one of them

I meant I'm great

it's moving past here

don't mind me please don't shoot me

I'm not trying to notice they're

shooting

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

the cookies so

I think the Cookie's so shocked of being

numbed and you need an um

like a like a chewing pumpkin

wait where was the rest of these

okay I need to remember to check them

out more often

but I guess it's fun seeing me playing

around aimlessly

[Music]

I'll do this

no

now

the building did not get destroyed

finally

that was close

[Music]

I'm always home

[Music]

it is far east at least I'll move East

[Music]

I'll do this

[Music]

oh yeah he's lying around with nowhere

to be

but I did find a building eventually

okay

I think it's a far away now

when I'm going far west this time

going east I thought before going west

yeah I guess you could read as the West

well I can buy

thank you

[Music]

no one's defending this

well someone is developing this what are

this

now it's defending someone is defending

this

oh no oh no

oh my

evil things rammed me and shot me

It's a SpongeBob reference I don't know

SpongeBob

I mean I know SpongeBob and he's done

I was never

into like the show wasn't that great

everything it serves

this serves such a reaction again

[Music]

I'm out of ammo

okay that did not work as planned

I'll try this then

do any trees

there we go a few less trees

foreign

because I feel like it

it happens from an episode in which show

looking for Buried Treasure and Patrick

has the

Compass Mr Krabs telling me to guide

them East and that's what the map says

and Patrick takes the West instead

because

yeah

yeah

so

I guess east west

oh

it lasted just enough

well

Birmingham then

I got rid of this one

yeah I don't trust

but thanks for your explanation

there's a lot of SpongeBob reference

people do and I just don't get them

when Mr caramelage which direction they

were going it was Patrick I said East

which Patrick's replies I thought he

said we

like this is a good thing it's not

called the police

and Theft

that's the name of the directions

so do you know the Swedish terms for

north east south west

or in this case writing me because you

can't speak you cannot see

all right obviously since oh thank you

for destroying the tower for me

don't feel like I need your help but

thank you anyway

and

there

terms in Swedish are very similar to the

ones in English so if that's anything

going down from here

trying to sink we're going straight no I

don't remember

I think I think it's down

I'm sure I destroyed the trees

no I didn't

yeah I sent it down

yeah I need I need

if this tank just gets destroyed I'll

have to check the map

or not

Whitney

God

that wasn't I was supposed to go

straight

straight just straight

yeah but the Swedish times

wow I didn't see there was a mine there

I don't know let's finish directions

well

it's a

nor

is

vest

right it could also be node

uh Saturday

investing

I'll stay

oh yeah yeah

all right once you start dancing sorry

about that people

don't throw any rest how does such a

large hangers fit in your body the

hangers out would be about as big as the

people

there's a thing no

language should show up in the map

get me out of me get it stuck

I'm going to destroy this one because I

don't like the one

thank you

there we go

yeah the flagship being here I think

let's try me spelling this okay

and nor

I would be nude

Actually I don't even know Swedish

apparently

oops

it's clearing out this area a bit I'm

out of ammo

that wasn't good

that was engaged

noticed

sod that doesn't mean right

West

that's not even there's nothing it's

really [ __ ] it was seed and invest

yeah I think Nora would be Sade

foreign

I don't shoot too far

okay that did not go plan is planned I

already destroyed almost though hello

Carter let's go back

[Music]

and Seed now it's supposed to be seed

eat

best

there you go

so n e s w in Swedish would be n n s v

[Music]

what is happening here to let the earth

oh there you go

[Music]

yeah these towers here

nothing

no

they didn't even hit me

didn't even hit me

and at least you know I didn't cheat but

if he did you did she eats and then he

misspelled it intentionally

that we can silly

I'll pass that in mind just fine

[Music]

I'll do this

hopefully I can hide behind here

Don't Shoot Me

what this thing came

no

Don't Shoot Me

don't shoot me I'm quicker than you I

can't reach me

you can't chase me

it's something I changed now I need to

use the road so I can drive quickly

so I can because I'm going to the dirt

here

that I need a

lately yeah because it's clicking at me

when I'm drying

this is peacefully

[Music]

it's the new video

nope

I wouldn't be a new video it's almost

the same video

that took 17 minutes all right p o n

done

70 minutes

no es bueno

no way not even English name anymore

that would be kind of funny if

each language it never had his word had

their own language

this isn't good

dream

pain

and

they're there

no no flag

no es bueno

the bueno no it's Bueno

that's the helicopter

nice boy though

hmm

I don't know if he's actually in this

season together

it is not good or some something

technical difference

foreign

foreign

[Music]

stop getting hit by everything

[Music]

okay no nothing in that

no no I need to move back home again

guys I don't know where next thing is

now the last half the people just going

down there

but there is one accidentally step

but yeah I only had one hit point left

kind of forgot about that but it's got

an important part

okay so it's there and then this one

there

so if I try to get that one and then I

actually I'm doing the like

the rough a search for the flag with the

helicopter

but then I do the more

clean up with the other vehicles

where was it

now wait

all right

it wasn't there

I think it continued down or something

[Music]

nice

oh there it is

helicopter explodes everyone goes quiet

well

I guess I'd just have to push myself

through everything

look it's a massive base this time

foreign

getting through

Miguel

no wait no wait this isn't the right way

I think it's down

down down

and rotate

peaceful tank oh yes yes

definitely peaceful

I'm creating Peace by destroying the

things that are attacking me

right

that's how peace works right

thank you

don't destroy the fuel tanks

as I considered pulling out

yeah I mean

I'm just I'm just trying to thank thank

the tank

but then it's come then it comes

I'm quite far down I might have gone too

far down

I can go back up and

I probably have to take the map again

anyway

and then I can see that the

the trace of my destruction and see

thank you

see where I went wrong

I don't see the bridge yeah I'm very

close down

no doubt okay let's see okay I was I was

in the right track yes

I think I think because the flag is

there

oh yeah yeah so if I if I just continue

down

to two two of those a roommates I guess

I'm calling them now actually

and in the third one I turn west

winced or I mean or west I mean yes if

left it there

I'm eating my hands that's yeah I'll

have a trouble of biting my own name

sometimes

hello rocket man did you have fun

streaming Rocket Man

you should have raided me

with your

little party and then a kid develop a

shout out and this is Rocket Man

he's a man from the rocket

from the rocket land

you streamed early today I was making

breakfast when I got the notification

I was up early and at a loose ends

thought is

I may as well yeah why not

this isn't the way

here's the problem with the schedule

sometimes sometimes I feel like maybe I

should just stream

I have the schedule I didn't need to

follow this candy I could just throw in

an extreme

[Music]

I mean there are I just didn't change

can it be recovered no it's gone

off man half rocket

would have rated but it was just me so

essentially he

sorry

wait you had several watches

oh no wonder what the watch Rocket Man

someone need to go watch Rocket Man

yeah there's a problem with a serum

person rate this has been like a race

black TV to be us it's perfectly fine

perfectly fine

[Music]

it would be fun if the vehicle could

record

they could they could be an element if

you'd abandon your vehicle anyone can go

and take it and then bring it back to

like base

we connect

deal because there was a noise Bueno I

was making BoRics I spent portable retos

83 and the fourth is tonight's dinner

wow three politics for breakfast and one

for

dinner

Irish Spring okay now we're actually

getting a special map again it's like

three special Maps or like 20 different

Maps or something

it was Minefield it was a chessboard and

now it's Irish Spring and this is going

to be a very hard map I see oh my look

at the towers the amount of

hours

habanero and jalapeno and it still

wasn't spicy

no they're shooting me already

excuse me I haven't even left off yet

this is what an Irish Spring is like

you have just these towers shooting you

when you try to leave your home

and

then yeah

not the flu too far clear Bluetooth

okay

that's not going to work

Irish Spring that's a brand of body wash

and I have to wash my body after this

reference to something

what

being shot at well if you use this stuff

with

a mess or show anything with myself of

your life being shot with a rocket

um I guess

it wasn't exactly was the first thing

ever

thank you

I was like is this is this referring

some kind of war of Ireland

uh um I'm a United Kingdom going

to Ireland

found out who's boss

yeah I should probably

go get rid of mine

I don't like my soul

if that isn't clear

I thought it was your favorite

your favorite drink

okay whatever say that now oh my

thumb but

let's take away yeah yeah yeah it will

I want to clean up this stuff too

because it's fun

summer trees cut I can't move around

excuse me

what do you think you are

here we go

Army is trying to attack

the Irish home base

in the spring

I think they

my name gave all the contacts I needed

now now I'm getting stuck get out of

here I'm stuck I'm going to lose the

tank

no I'm out no I got stuck I'm out of

ammunition

ha ha

math met someone it's not a dream

and any soap that contains it makes it

feel like your Skin's

walking off the bone

when

anything you should drink if you're

brave enough

this is latitude

yeah okay exactly

got stuck on a tree and I did have and I

have no more ammunition to get rid of

that tree

saw a tower here

destroy tower now there it is

going to destroy some of these towers or

some of these trees are not getting

stuck here again

okay

all right

this explosion sounds

bad too

all these destroyed trees

I'm gonna destroy this day

stupid tree oh yeah

around I mean shouldn't the tree be like

twice by being run away

this pile of gravel everywhere

is it get destroyed

so much

now my secret ocean sounds

well I'm safe I'm gonna destroy all

these

dancing have everything here

foreign

how far I've got now

yeah a bit I'm gonna clear that

but oh my I don't like that the dark

line in the middle I've done a double

nine of walls

go

you got those

foreign

getting destroyed at the moment

oh nice those days shooting down the

trees for me

yeah it's just pouring some gravel

destroyed the trees

is this the whole island of Ireland

technically didn't specify if this is

supposed to be this doesn't even look

like Ireland

is gone

looks like I'm more so yeah

it's almost like a pizza word soon

almost like it is

eight of these

I'm constantly shooting

I'm safe yeah

I'm not getting the shot I think

okay here it is

yeah there's a one

since I have I haven't left

I'm going to

no more ammo

okay get rid of some upstairs because

they can take it gonna get in the way of

course I don't think you need to remove

this one I'm shook

I'm sorry for the sudden

I didn't mean to surprise you so much

oh my God oh my

God yeah I probably need to

maybe more towards the sign here

this is fine

over the tree

oh

come on

shooting in mind

I don't have to worry about the mine

all right it's fine do I have blood

pressure drop thing in here

well at least this is Ireland so so it's

not close to you

come on shut it down

I wonder if he's in my basement Scotland

and now there's a map because that's

part of the demo these are my plate

based on Japan there's a map based on

the whole of Americans

no I wouldn't be surprised if there's

like a map based on Europe as well

the whole of Europe

two lines of one

go to the camp place I was thinking

about that before

because I did see a tower placed on a

small island so thinking does the engine

support placing Towers on top of water

apparently it does

the tower is a separate object from

but does it still count as water

just count this land

technically it's grounded on top of

water technically I should be able to

drive over it I'm going to destroy some

of this one here

oh someone's shooting at me

now I'm out of ammo

there's something destroying some within

one second drives through there with the

Jeep

of England

oh my

that would be something

here's the big question

well

um

oh yeah I have some more and some more

ways to go here

if Scotland were to go independent

Scotland would

or it's like every other country have an

official ISO

ISO code or ISO code

the two letter codes

damn which

but what would that be

because it can't be SC because that's

that's already stands for Seychelles

the company is of that Somalia

the company St because that's some other

region

the company SL because that's

um I don't remember which country that

is

it can't be

sa but that's that's Saudi Arabia

it's gonna be SN because that's another

Vision I don't remember which it is

and it can't be St because that's Sudan

the every s combined with any letter of

the name Scotland is occupied and that's

not working

who will now come free for what

oh sorry

sitting up correctly good good that you

keep an eye on me out of on me

they were trying to move my way down the

right side there

he asked for

foreign

already that's occupied

breakfast content why would you pick

French

the

the only

um

Ireland has the code IE which stands for

Ireland and

yeah I don't know no obviously Ireland

and Irish but this is the English and

Irish name combined

with the English name first

let's start that before you get

destroyed thanks

oh no

I know

no no

oh

look at that I did it I was so close to

dying there

I think we're just doing some trees

because I want to

it's my celebration for somebody

on is back

I'm gonna have to share it and they'll

have to say kit that's not how it works

that is not how much going to work but

my suggestion is if because you can't

use

Scotland Alba because that's sa that was

already occupied

uh you can't do as as in audible

Scotland

I don't know how you say

that because that is a

a American Samoa

they're always so my suggestion is just

taking the name Alba and just go with a

B

because that one is not used

Al is Albania

and a a is not available

would that be so Random

even though it is a logical reason for

that name that for that code

going in here and destroying everything

[Music]

I am

getting destroyed at moments yep

America sound like I can't get to [ __ ]

you it is kind of weird how some EV

territories get their own codes

because American Samo is just a

territory of United States

it is not its own country it does not

need its own code

and

not every it's only inherited areas

territories of United States that have

codes

unless they already is part of the

way

unless they're part of the 50 states or

District of Columbia

I should probably need to

story some mines

like destruction yes

you know how the Channel Islands there

are no calories very nice same thing

not to not one Cannery yes at least two

but Canary Island stands for a wait

another Island stands for dogs the

islands of dogs there are not dogs on

Canary Island

all right let's start that scene

because I don't want to work through all

this and then with the cheap

accidentally run over mine or something

whoa whoa whoa whoa

[Music]

I get to destroy it

I just started to think that's awesome

to destroyed

all right back to the tank now

I know it's really dramatic music

wait how am I supposed to do that

these Morse I'm scared

down here yes

no no this isn't good

I'm not doing so well at the moment

okay you can say so

I'm not doing someone at the moment

what was that the second thing it's a

dramatic music

for some reason

this morning

should have it and why specifically the

second tank is so so weird

so each vehicle has their their own main

theme the second time Caster out a

special team seem and did the Jeep while

carrying the flag as a special team

scene

no destroyed it no just try that

I don't want this to get in the way

no I'm moving forward I didn't mean to I

didn't mean to sorry sorry powers

just getting rid of some

foreign

yes sure

that seems Maybe

for tank stop shooting wait should I

stop shooting or should they stop

shooting videos with me

let's make it soon

go go go

okay this is this is quite the map

I can still clear out the potential

mines down there

saving a helicopter for that

magic again

them they need to stop shooting the

peaceful tank exactly I am a peaceful

tank I'm part of the peacekeepers I'm

coming here to piece to keep

I meant to keep the peace

but I can piece to keep too

don't ask me how

because I don't know how

do you think

there you go

right that thing is the Target TV

oh

someone's trying to shoot me

oh they're so far out in the water

can I reached that yes I can

but the last one way too many mines here

the minds that make me uncomfortable

because I need to

have that Funimation

without ammunition

and because I need to

get rid of the tower shift inside don't

shoot down on my helicopter

let's see

you keep peace

what no I said no one no

no I don't [ __ ] man

see you on a ring his arm what's with

this chewing

well it looks like dark dots where they

are destroyed so maybe you can stand on

them

that's the metal one

in many Minds yeah way too many months

too many destroy Towers team

where are the non-destroyed towers here

they the one they destroyed teams

I'm in the trees I can't get three

I do want to get rid of some of these

two I don't really need to but

let me start paying his pieces destroyed

everything so far so like oh they're

helping me please help me

I'm cleaning up

oh wait no someone's trying to shoot me

I will read of you

can you see that

I mean to go do this some of these

attack tank is a sandwich

so much for this Irish summer

whoa how much do I have oh my I have

quite I've got rid of quite a lot though

west side of the flag thing to get rid

of as well

when I hit 200 trees I guess

three minute trees

of mines

don't like those

oh sorry

is it that I can shoot that one

or that one

there we go

Three Trees which I guess

[Music]

okay I almost got rid of everything

I just went out in the backing

reload and

clean up

back and forth back and forth I'm not

going to have a good time on this map

oh yeah there's like six hours left or

so

I want a bunch of trees

that's still at that Tower

all the way out there trying to shoot me

here we go

through

that way

that's away

thank you Tommy

come to the movie

good

so now I just need to get rid of

all the mines

getting catering up some of the trees

this way

[Music]

I know I win

but cut rid of most of the map

so now I can bring out the helicopter

and destroy the mines

come on

there yeah

that wasn't

yeah no more Towers

can I see the mines on the radar

I can't see the mines on the helicopter

no I did the tank and armor to support

me

but my instance not show up on this

reader

such a [ __ ]

not so good

[Music]

I got mines here

that was actually

I'm probably going to move only

[Music]

I've been traveling more on this side

anyway and I think I removed the minds

here

I think I think

here we go here's the lines

too many mine

I do mind

them after mines here

[Music]

I'm going to see I mean I'm destroyed

almost every one of these so why not

everything is clear down there

we have

look how clean it is

okay

every piece of things destroyed now

[Music]

perfect

move down

nice and clean yep

every piece of style every piece of wood

the map is completely clean now

isn't it beautiful

well my dad feel there's still a few

mines

but I won't be running into those

no no worries about that

as this time we're going to go to the

golden

winning the map

okay great

it's gonna take a quicker or slower

across the ground

wait oh look roads they're actually

roads here

we had the built roads though

sure

I have one tank left one helicopter left

and the three Jeeps

we're going to bring this Jeep home

get it out to me a tree

right go home

not every single trees shut down but

maybe Netflix but a lot of trees are

shut down

so much destruction

so much destruction

whoa that's way too long to do

and not even a promise me new wait

how long did I take

loading 36 minutes sorry

thank you for saving

a bit um

technically still have been three hours

yet so

in Parts fireballs

very long time yeah compared to 18 17 12

minutes

now I feel like doing one more

technically not three hours yet

goodness gracious Great Balls of Fire

now this is chicken once again

they calling me a chicken

now let's oh we've got some big

buildings this time

okay

back to our regular map again

the previous map awesome it was

something

generally

no no no no no no no

didn't even treat mine

your garage do I have a sugar rush

okay and then I will come down

I go south east

seems like at least it

doesn't think I've ever had the very

first one ever be the flag

maybe what they do is they have like

when you destroy a building yeah

I was thinking they they just random if

they did a random at that point if it

should spawn the flag

there's so many buildings are left

and when the question is from

good

GNC you want that

purple message isn't it fun

and you get a purple message for only

50.

okay

foreign

yes

yes

pink

next now we got different colors here

now we need red to make a red message

and I can also make a perfect message

proxies can make a mustard message

[Music]

message

okay where's campus

that is

starting mine

huh

okay where's The Flying though

well I got rid of all my helicopter okay

so it's up there should I go over the

bridge and then let's go north

when shouldn't I just be able to uh

let's just do this

let's just do the destructive message

what planes never mind on the road

let's destroy these

move up

and then we destroyed these

let's get this straight

please get destroyed

there we go

shoot me way too much

thank you

okay and then I moved through here I

think

but then I'm up here

yes this seems this seems to be small

huh that one Tower is destroyed

now

hope the fire returns safely how are you

thank you for reminding me

I can see you are kicking up

come on I did I dislike that tree yes

the I am returning the fire to these

enemies

it is going well

then destroying their own trees

yeah I do I do want I want everything

like that just animating some belly rubs

you know what

not building

you are annoying me segment again

and you destroyed my previous vehicle so

I'm gonna get rid of you

and you

and then I just destroyed this building

and then I return home

hey one more minute before the time yes

no it wasn't 19 minutes

huh

our thoughts fell off you

okay I got the free Starbucks today oh

oops see what you did me make me do

that's fine

I ordered uh this additional salt Maple

and caramel cornbread that's quite a

drink

when they first made a pumpkin spice

electrical

let's

just let you have it

I mean

technically they don't really need

ladies anymore because it's

already

made and consumed partly

but

[Music]

so let's see if I can get home

hey if you're shooting your own

buildings what are you doing

all right yeah there you go that's the

red message

ah let's try

oops

don't really miss it again distracted

here with my charm

here is your question because

oh I can't go wrong with free coffee

okay they did they asked if I wanted to

keep the wrong order and I was like yeah

why not yeah if I watch as long as it's

something I I like I can give it down

save save

chicken parts

What's this called wool chicken parts

today's Finals hey I mean it's only 11

minutes over time and that is quite a

great message

this is a quick map yeah yeah look at

this this will be quick

and this time I even got a wall and some

Towers

I don't really need Towers why does this

Tower shut down

I wonder if the towers would shoot down

the

slightly moving

I guess it makes sense

no

the powers does not care about that

thing

since I had a bit of an oversight

like if I'm in my base they should

protect me

stop shooting me I'm trying to shoot

your building

it was not in that one

research continues

when I forgot where these things are why

wasn't it oh one over here

oh yeah yeah

this this one here

okay I can't apparently not [ __ ]

[Music]

and you are distracting me

go

now I can shoot

it was not in that one

oh there's another one here

[Music]

let's shut the wrong way

I was wait how did I destroy it that

quickly

okay let's let's come across on the last

building now what is it

I think it's more than one moment

why is it

[Music]

oh there there it is okay let's see if I

can do it

with me

well it was not in that much

unless you were there then I would give

it to you of course and that's nice

oh terrorists that are correct on your

side

I envision

Division and a lonely Army coming off

what's a lonely Army camera [ __ ] it is

the peaceful helicopter yeah yeah don't

shoot me down and the last one is that

corner oh no

oh no

I need to go around everything

and punch yeah fun fun Army

yeah how dare you he told me only

I feel

I feel the insulted

the character is lacking money yes

Chopper

that would be something

in GTA's San Andreas I think it's fun to

take the helicopter

through the beach tilt the rotors to the

side and see how many people

yeah

you can get with the blades

but that sounds horrific

that sounds like something you would

think

I don't get the attack

yeah

time to mount you at the helicopter yeah

yeah I hope I have fun funds like little

30 years or something

okay I said wrong name sorry I I'm not

sure if I can accept your apology this

this is this is horrible it's

no I am ashamed you should be

and you know me so well yeah yeah you

definitely go

destroy everything okay

but I just still have two helicopters

yeah sorry we must ban this Harry's

but but that's it a fun fun should have

uh Lolly dear uh but you said you even

though she says do

different accents

um not only do you outfit for one point

if she accepts that

I need to go here but I like

distractions

the destruction since playroom

okay how can I be forgiven of what

Mighty fun fun

well

yeah you have to

yeah you have to donate this within this

fund

no it's fine

it's a mistake

everyone can do such mistake

foreign

connected to a wall I don't think I've

ever seen that before

oh no

hey it's mostly German when it's no ride

by or cat's place it's on

the in-game radio

I can't imagine

it would be kids doing like an outfit

swap for future yeah exactly

that would be fun

I don't know you will not change my mind

I don't think you listen to every radio

station really

destroy it thank you

okay

but yeah and having having a outfits

what would be would be fun and cute

okay

where

oh yeah I see my moon

what's the wrong thing there you go

they're supposed to continue through

here

watching out for all these mines

and here it is

I think those are like yeah yeah there

you go

well if it wasn't in this one like where

is it then

foreign

I don't like your face

try to make a bit more safe only cheap

uh whoops that would be too close

one of my favorite GTA and it's an app

for life insurance one of the

testimonials says I was devastated when

I found out my wife was cheating on me

and even more so when she felt

underneath the train I was no one year

at the time and my phone records proved

it

well

that's uh

I don't know

that's something

the kind of

morbid humor that might be your thing

and then I need to take the second

entrance otherwise I ran out without

mine
