welcome

we have a new person here

oh there's the picture

I'm sure why I didn't finish nothing

that's my problem yourself right

yeah welcome sir booking Theo

DTR

I don't know if that's how you wanted to

be said

you can't hear

I see we are into

crafting racing considering your

listening

[Music]

your

first edition here

quick

and early

[Music]

so this is how far I got so far so far

everything

so

everything

[Music]

so

it got five gems from something

the next row

oxide and oxide no oxide is some star

scene anyway let's see if I can

find that

[Music]

see if I know where to go

and I know the controls

now that's back to the beach

no that's where I should go

yeah

all right first here I think I didn't

see the

nostrings

but yeah it continues

see you in the next area

that's hopefully where I should kill

yes there's a spaceship because

spaceships means

what a specialty

gemstone Valley that was amazed oh oh

here's where I get the gems

I see

oh hello

lurking

and here's the

the boss himself

good morning hello

good morning to you

I hope you have a good morning

so this is one of the extra tracks and

then 985 gems so slight Colosseum called

Colosseum slide Collision

it doesn't say Coliseum right

you just

Coliseum

I didn't know that one if that's a word

A Relic race that's all it is

[Music]

starting off in the grass

and here's where I start off with

a nice Adventure

[Music]

I'm bouncing your empty things

this is one of those levels that's

really going to chase my skills

[Music]

yeah it might be considering where all

the boxes are

missed every single box

yeah they're getting cool and more

spreader

all right there they are

here

[Music]

okay this is definitely going to test my

skills

that was a nice that was a nice yeah

hello doctor sliding

yeah

if you would call this sliding

sliding along oh I got it

planning on the along the Colosseum

I just may not be used in my closing

okay I got plenty of time now

oh yeah yeah

[Music]

talk sometimes

I don't think that whenever

you need to go in the grass no I

shouldn't waste time together soon

I want to do that though

there we go oh it's killed

I'm going to first try

oh and I haven't played the game in like

five days six days

yeah we have

however

differently each time

yeah it is it who seems to be into CPR I

would assim

and also

wait he said he said it's wrong but I

let it slide okay how would I say it

great you are a relic okay okay

is that how you spell coliseum

to me it just says Coliseum that's just

they might be how you spell colosseum

but that's not how I expected it to be

spelled like

[Music]

Coliseum to me anyway let's go

and also you see it's more like

that you have not been here very often

or at least not chatted so maybe a lot

of these people aren't like astral has

been here a few times

foreign

yeah

okay here you go

nice all right this is very sweet

that's not nice

I guess I'll use my

skins I got to playing all this

games are in here

let's get some kids stuff

[Music]

probably the only bombs started always

that's nothing oh there we go something

I'm not doing anything

because I'm lost

[Music]

nice but not sure why this has to be a

separate part of the land uh

okay the

coach goodbye

determined the guy sign of the game

there you go what's that the red Jammer

they have the gist on the end

huh that's why

oh it's a cup I see

that was on the track okay so that was

the starting track and this is still the

same which is exactly the same because

that was strength one when I am in the

lead

so I don't have to win every

race I wanna have to win

this Need for Speed all over again

Sports Fair yeah that seems appropriate

for me occasion

well done funny you may eat your dryer

license for now I do have a dream

license

[Music]

to the game

[Music]

oh

my God

that's fun

[Music]

the missile is coming

please give me such being here

come on

campus that is

Captain who's during this time well

Daddy what are you doing

[Music]

getting set for season the trophy is

mine you have quite a lot more ahead of

me

[Music]

that's such thing

thank you

it was mine

oh there's another one my ticket anyway

crash and come back here

[Music]

so

this is the final map

right our second place is fine

but I do take the first position and

rather

now I miss them

doesn't really tough speaking

no stop don't press the Finish Line

oh I got it right right in there and

then

that's another plus nine

that means I have 18 points

yes

3.6 can't keep three points boy

in the same position to the races

oh so now it's like Mario Kart yeah yeah

much better that's the skin than I am I

that's better than this game when I

started

I think you like every card game is

absically basically there we go Basics

oh my God I could see like stem getting

heavily influenced by Marco for obvious

reasons that's because the Kim uses card

is making a Mario Kart clone it is true

but

to me anyway but then probably have been

having influenced by

no fun this is first place I didn't know

when this could steal oh yeah it is

there's a lot of there's nothing about

me you don't know

[Music]

[Music]

I think so

I'll take that

[Music]

no me

is this Mario Kart when I aim for the

box of your girlfriend

what's up because I recommended to take

the box then I do

not

punishment before picking up the boxes

okay

a good color

that's good progression of items

meow oh

like it's here

I think that was kind of hard to see can

I see about them

okay

oh come on

what's the point of the Boost if you

can't even use the booze to boost

um

I take a second place that's fine

I hope they have renting a first place

working the boots they crossed at me

the thing is

the final standings there you go three

point needs okay

so I need to be in the next one

[Music]

assume that if you get same point the

game is currently going you can see that

that's a lot

well I meant the random weapon boxes

called the power sliding this spin out

okay I mean yeah there's a lot in

similarities similarly marketing

I thought it synced this game the

implemented drifting before Mark at it

yeah yeah Marco didn't add the drift

boost was it the Wii version

uh hybrid

thank you for having me

I think Marco didn't add that boost

mechanics

it was one of them yeah the Wii version

introduced the tricks on the boost on

the like ramps

and Double Dash introduce the Boost the

Boost yeah yeah

and plus the Boost mechanic in this game

requires you actually

doing something you cannot just slide

which is something to get tasty

[Music]

how much the meter for the Boost wasn't

in the corner and it's the last place

like in the middle of screen like below

your cart

it's not [ __ ] why they had to put it in

the corner

no I wanted that

I must that means I can try to shoot

through there not that I need to but I

had to cut time

today

I still don't have

any of the fruit boxes

I need one of them

thank you

[Music]

another first place

and don't get hit by that thank you

now I just need to know where to drive

stuff went to Facebook

[Music]

how to navigate

can't keep that in case someone decides

to drive past me

hi

good afternoon

that doesn't have much

but I don't think anything

[Music]

yeah I think you're right it was just

the maintain speed yeah yes I'm glad

with money

before it is

crazy points

out of 36 and and then game game says

sorry I didn't get that six points you

don't get your head gem

oh nothing do you think

every time

there it is

congratulations you

Jim

wait I just checked Marcus these four

came out three years before this game

Mario Kart 64 still in her address

because it wasn't until Double Dash

[Music]

and

[Music]

Sprites instead of three demons which

I'm not going this way

in general

and Tamil is the only unique Market to

me

I mean how is it the only the unique one

shouldn't basically

most Mario Karts be unique

[Music]

I think about it I guess

they trying to think the ones I've

played because I played

the Wii version and I guess the Mario

Kart 8

it's just an upgraded version of the Wii

the looks Deluxe is obviously an update

version of ape

names

oh wait I didn't get it

um

I was saying

okay I need to do better here

so

I have still going in between two boxes

I need to stop doing that

well at least I'm keeping surface

can I get something more useful

what happens

when

I get a second place it is

and that was a very

and eventless series

[Music]

Marcus if I had this boost you basically

controls and and your kit does

from whites to gold and if you release

after the code you get the difference

I should have had some kind of mechanic

pressurizing game lets you drive with

two people

I mean not play again

um okay you mean like that yeah

I mean he doesn't

it does add the mechanic of switching

between the two items

contact team racing

it's just crash team racing what is it

called crash demating it should just be

crash or anything

foreign

maybe you should come back

yeah Double Dash was the best part

it wouldn't be nice if they had because

people argue about that in the deluxe

version how they added the two item

boxes in it that they should have the

Double Dash modes

pick two characters

there would be a lot of work to it

it would probably enjoy that

as an option obviously when it's

replaced who's dances

[Music]

get away from me

wow wow

why why is everyone success behind me

stop making my bosses get away from me

I don't know

this isn't going great

[Music]

that's

awesome

I like that's the item

okay

now you're not getting away from me now

I'm missing every books

you showed me because I think that's

covered up when I activated which I

assume is what these Germans

everything

anyway

we first place

and the tiger came quite far behind so

that's zero points that's good because

that's what leaves me away with a much

nicer Gap to the second person

thank you

awesome monocodated copy the gravity

racing from Crash I haven't gotten to

that kind of racing Chromecast yet so

we'll see yeah I just did I used to

design flowers my friend but there are

three stage of your drifts but they're a

little screen it has cold and you can at

least for a boost camera turns so I did

have a one

I'm trying to learn something about the

camera

yeah that was really funny that is

because everyone knows ones are very

animals yeah one is a phrase

oh no

I have some seals to eat on this lemon

on this church

no stop taking my boxes

damn it no I didn't get it

[Music]

there we go find me something from this

side here you go

I got it

stay on the tracks

[Music]

trophies mind he says as I drive away

from you

[Music]

I did it pretty easy

how does it how does the crate break

without me getting amazing

how does that make sense

when these track does have a lot of

opportunity too

catch

let's go indeed

now

so far behind

respond thank you

give me something in this one

my items

okay I need

oh no it's benches

seriously

that was paintball

foreign

walking

outside

and I can do that

I can get an iPhone

I don't know I have something

can I get something back

I guess but I guess this one is

something

the last laugh was a bit squeaking and

rest

not too sure what they have to show the

first standing and now the track

standing which is exact same as the

previous screen and then we can see the

total coupler standing which is what's

relevant

nine points lead that means that I can

lose this race completely and get the

same point as

the second person

how was the scenes he will see us at

least it is

I guess you need to seal it here

and you're you're quite funny today

yeah I'm kind of behind on the comments

of course because I have to look at the

comments

yes I'll do my best

because

due to fast-paced nature of the game

spider

but

it goes slow anyway

[Music]

why not

you can't pick up those

fruits machines

okay so there's this shortcut there but

I'm not sure if I dare to pick it

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

went to fast instead

I went off it

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

like trash

can

[Music]

I just need to get a single point that's

like fourth place or something

[Music]

so the second place is fine

Tony

now let's get today all right what I

should have set this position there's

like fifth position in this one point

but that's the win another gem one

and let's uh

it's not SpongeBob anymore that's been

like 10 bits 10 minutes ago

oh crash is lazy that's it yay that's

the green one

congratulations you've won a gym I want

to thank you

[Music]

you can State what college

you want the green gem let's do the play

one

blue gem prep

crash is dead

he got third that is and he's he died

before he was awarded the

metal

[Music]

and I uh obviously depends on the

the ruins of the competition but

product is for some places you have to

be there to see your award foreign

hey I was in the secret terminal the

company

yeah exactly

can't catch me

television

all right scene

now because now I have seen

my products you save this guy no swiping

me

I can't use this

I don't remember what the kitties

because I could use something I wasn't

expecting

like this one I can't keep me

perhaps

dining yes

but out of my Lane

there's something else for that

I guess let's break his name

the Wonderland it or destroying it I

don't know

no one should have a spread on the

playlist

that's good track one

no wait okay so there's nine six three

one

those by three points for each but we

didn't have a smart beam just formed if

I need to get points to get at least one

point yay hydrate

wait how did it start it okay wait which

one

maybe I can remember what you're writing

probably not

[Music]

oh it's this one

I think that

that's it all right

okay

do you want more free second place

Nature's instead

clean boxes

oh maybe I find that

no I won't be back

all right there's one here

[Music]

it's starting a bit stronger isn't it

oh my head my boss is gone

okay

no that was a fan of the gym

Queen

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

damn it man

please gem cap in the dragon mines

[Music]

Dragon Vines

the weird one

[Music]

what's that shortcut I was distract but

it wasn't that wasn't sure

that's off the snow tracks

so yeah

[Music]

the app boosts or like a mask maker

I don't know

[Music]

all right cause two in one

all right all right

one on the road

because it does help so if I had a mask

in that area

[Music]

but not this scene

and let's put it straight there to check

wow

that's it that's me

there you go very quick final part of

the left 35 seconds

for Halloween

and a great lead now I definitely have

more than what I can only get

22 points

that means that the final race is an

ottoming good sex

I don't even need the restraints the

game should race today

you're more like you have a little one

the cup do you want to do the next race

anyway

questions

[Music]

here you go

[Music]

[Music]

move

um yeah that's the thing which needs to

speak to my kids if you have the

guaranteed win you could just

give up to a specific place

but you have to give up the race and not

the tournament

s

hey everybody

I didn't even see the TNT

okay okay let's see

face

yep

goodbye

next to the ramp question

[Music]

okay

[Music]

all right that's fine

same

time

let's see my another one then

you can't do anything stuff over there

single one what am I gonna give you this

position

[Music]

this game AI is pretty last Thursday

sometimes sometimes yeah

only three points other cat one anyway

that should be on my shooting racing

game where someone's so far ahead and

I'll just have it after the queen I mean

it was kind of the opposite way here but

I choose to

not do the race because I'm really

really there is I will I will win the

cups anyway

passively again

is pretty quick

statistic game where it's it's just like

all the gems all of them is like in the

same place

[Music]

do some random cups for gems

red Gang Green Champloo gem

yellow Jam Yellow Jam Yellow Jam Yellow

Canyon is there a can go for getting the

gems yes there is another tray and the

goal of understandings

and plus

part events in the game

experience on all the aspects of me

like sure I haven't done these tracks

but

enough forms I guess

his match

but um

I eat something

get away from me

oh

my height oh

[Music]

now I just had four ingredients

[Music]

[Music]

[Applause]

goodbye

[Music]

now how did he get rid of it so quickly

[Music]

yay

first place

oh that was close

yeah

very very close

here we go it's nice okay one

the tiger is not getting a lot of points

this time around but

but cortex got sick of the position

because he was in second position when I

trusted him saying something

[Music]

so he doesn't

try to figure out which position that I

would have come if there isn't it

[Music]

a quick way of doing it just affect

motor position now pretend that's when

we would have cracking down

what now what's up

yeah why would you be sweating

that's a bad foods even sweat in first

place

and I know some of them

oh no this is a more humanized version

and humans do sweats now

just argue that's just an aspect of

being humanized

being able to sweat

ers

all right that's why they keep jumping

over the past

let's go

Quick Camera

hey

wow

what's going on

[Music]

foreign

let's go

[Music]

and I guess also to I think he has more

used to the granny

they found

things

which at first looks like an impossible

race but if I do all these first

might not be as in husband

but I keep trying faster than me

all right that's it for that

all right

I just have to wait again stop cortex oh

dang it's a good touch it

huh

same points between cortex and cocoa

Cole ticks

core kill

hot air skyline of this track

not this track

thank you

[Music]

hey why didn't I get the ball

[Music]

my name is

[Music]

honey

[Music]

this is one of these bags that I just

stopped in and it's um

paint I tried to avoid it but

that was hard

for me

every time I get to these boxes there's

always an opponent here I want to pick

it up

all right

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

what did I do

yeah that's my that's it that's that's

what I feel like a fair bunny that's

that's my that's my emotions

and YouTube can get a fair bunny for

owning a thousand Beats

[Applause]

foreign

of course I need to start on the other

side

first

item seems to be completely useless when

it comes to using it

you get a quick speed

but by far it is

Hello friends

how about selecting

your system for the money

foreign

but

still I still don't have enough points

do you like

I have a definite guaranteed win here in

a very very nice recovery

it's that it's that rubber band in your

practice

oh okay stretch

the yellow cup is the

um

[Music]

the whole crappy space on the corner of

the gems and Gem is yellow

foreign

spicy

I think he made oh yeah

sorry about that

I slipped a bit hey

I don't like the speed was from as usual

we got the mask it gives a better speed

boost

than the uh actually speed boost item

let's go

get away from me inside

[Music]

what is the leading

way

[Music]

next time

what

are you so quick

okay

timer

gonna put him back in time

to until the race starts let's look how

easy

it's going to be two quarters

but I have seen a racing game where I am

travel is missing

oh

now I missed it

in the simple form I ask and you can

reverse time and I realized

would you cut the first time because I

have options

but it's not special

it's not anything

360. and yeah

[Music]

something

we in space this is some kind of space

station here for understandings like

cocoa with two points that was a close

race

Fallen

one

position back it would be the same post

point

and I assume that means that I wouldn't

have one but because let's get our

keyboards

and Coco doesn't seem to be

locals

no reactions for winning you want a gym

[Music]

purple

and

Final Cut

now let's see which channeling tracks

this will be

it's a track one of sanity

but if all right he has the bosses okay

I was gonna say there's too few traces

they're all going to throw items now I

was just there is against

a regular race

probably so far is that the bosses seems

that

I hit top speed and

enormous

let me pick your favorite item and get

it half the time

everyone

okay let me second position I was going

to say but

I lost it

all right

I'll take a second place it's not bad

me versus four buses

all right now let's go

this is going to be tricky

so I just have to make sure I can't make

sure we'll see if papa papa

doesn't get like first again

or second preferably not second again

second again not second

okay oh it's 4 plus 11. first

you're confused about tea

last number of places

[Music]

come on I had a boost and everything

how did that not count

[Music]

here we go

everybody

[Music]

come in from me I said

oh

someone got eaten

please stop shaking that

[Music]

but now papa is not there again

first time but

it shouldn't be a second position

[Music]

is it

[Music]

okay that was a bad position

[Music]

everyone's just spread out

he got second place we had the same

points that's not good

yep

I know you're interested

I appreciate your

hair

that you think I will when this is

[Music]

like everyone has a specific start

position

[Music]

thank you

don't give me something useful like a

mask that's famous

that's excuse me the first thing

[Music]

some more use for it that's one

oh yeah this looks good no

how far is

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

it out

there you go

no get out of there ah come on come on

constantly in the first place after this

but

that was a weird one

I have a five-point lead so I don't

really need to win the next race but of

course I will try to do the best

yeah I was hungry so I ate the rest of

my ghost pepper potato she now I have I

think

it is it bad

why it goes Pepsi because I love spicy

foods we love spicy candy

I love spicy

[Music]

that's

[Music]

it

effective trans

not that chains

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I'll get that away

[Music]

no

let's try to find me

mask nice

I did not put this up here

[Music]

in the distance

huh I have to jump perfect

that's certainly was mine

I can't miss some positions excuse me

all right

[Music]

come on I'm supposed to jump into it

they're so spooky going

oh yeah I have one I have one

yeah you can

Ariel Phantom best reaction

and the turtle sounding is cocoa wings

price do you need

I mean it depends on how much they put

on YouTube

is it one chip

the bosses are very big

benefits only

the

thing

you want a gym you want a gym

so I got everything here so it's only

the turbo track

it seems another time frame yep

terrible track

and I don't like the name of it

it's the last thing

before the final boss battle and then I

have 100 of the game which I did say

today before the stream that I don't

think I'm 100 in this game today

why am I still might not do because that

was bad

[Music]

why do you want to take my dress

have I done today

okay I can do it like that I

hope it worked

I can't see

no okay

oh nice

slam straight into one especially

yeah which is

let's go

[Music]

well I don't guess that was

maybe not the quickest way of doing it

but

another coffee the boxes

thank you

I guess that's such a chance oh yeah

I got two after my thing

no no without this that means all of

them all of devices

foreign

[Music]

on this

am I better at him maybe

I hate turbo track it was a perfectly

fine turbo check

let's try to amazing

thank you you know I can check it

fingers you won you were all alone

born alone the new one first place what

a surprise

okay

and you've got it all my time relics I'm

impressed well it's about time I taught

you a real lesson in speed this race is

from caves

[Music]

because it has a thing in the

[Music]

in the original crash

to three at least

and

you have to battle the last boss before

you can get last time Crystal thingy

Relic this is a crystal already

and and then you defeat

the boss again after getting the last

remix I don't remember what is the gym

no just like you get all the gold relics

first

[Music]

and knock science final challenge so I

wonder if you're supposed to challenge

the boss twice or something okay

cheating on who's the actress that was

going on

[Music]

you have to cheat

I mean I am behind here but

let's see here you go

mommy said I like that let's see if I

can do something

but I'm gonna make sense

racing

[Music]

you're so far behind

[Music]

yeah

I can catch up much

hi this is

[Music]

[Music]

now as we found China's different

questions for beating him wheat and

without everything okay so so I'm

missing one cutscene or something

yeah

or you probably say oh you need

everything before you actually can't

continue

what

how was your week

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

yeah

what's behind me when I dropped him

it doesn't drop anymore

excuse me

[Music]

say goodbye

it's my change

is he afraid

not fairbound try again

[Music]

[Music]

the first time is left

place before they're in the place

second one

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

what

I guess I guess it wasn't that tricky oh

that was like the first proper attempt I

did actually started but

it was that game did I do everything is

it 100 complete I don't know

he has many things

[Music]

so is this the winning Casino sorry Lucy

all right

oh languages yeah you're not going to

find an interesting languages on a

boring languages like

French

or

I don't know what language this is

because it says a fun kind

it's the French language

German Italian Spanish which is spelled

correctly and Dutch

so nothing interesting

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

would see him

am I just not able to spell Collision

Colosseum

I mean

[Music]

Colosseum okay it's a Coliseum

apparently it's not Collision Coliseum

I just don't know how to spell colosseum

in that case

which is just

[Music]

I don't think we can say I don't know

[Music]

I easily see that's an alternative form

I would spread it like the colors am I I

don't know that's enough

for this

that is great yeah that's right next up

that's correct I still it still looks

like it should be said Coliseum and

there is taking one thing that I have to

do have read the ingredients right now

how much would that be

[Music]

and get the fastest time on every trench

or not

like at the same time as engine

time chance

okay what's up counters

uh more chances but how do I check the

number why is he off to the side this is

because

is this place between

[Music]

isn't funny

I don't know because they have different

stats and it doesn't really show this

downstairs

[Music]

but yeah

but you don't access the additional

character from there which would be fun

one carries you don't like

I'll just pass away

I said this is okay

[Music]

one of which characters likes

First National Academy I speed

but I don't know what just starts this

character's hair because I can't see it

[Music]

she's

[Music]

my sister is at the moment

unless they have the exact same stats

during time trial

because it isn't necessary

I mean I got time over

[Music]

there we go

[Music]

[Music]

I should have a character Beats

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I need to go to this time period scene

whatever I haven't done anything to

answer so I guess it doesn't I don't

have any

[Music]

okay

[Music]

I can't even see if I can do this thing

it's not a problem yeah it's fine

never fun to talk to you yeah yeah fun

if you just stare around

next challenge

[Music]

okay

how tricky are the clients

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

lots of the grass stickers on campus

I wanted to jump over it and save some

time

so fast your lunch is up in the parallel

universe apparently if I go to the next

track by going fast

thank you

what do you mean like

my

times

well let's see if you can beat my

fastest time on this track

Okay so

is the uh

oh yeah so I should challenge these guys

but didn't didn't tell me about the time

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

my eyes was the uh ghost time as part of

the

[Music]

list or something

[Music]

slower than myself

that was pretty good is

something because that was really hard

for me too

[Music]

this is the hardest part

and this is the one I have to be

I assume

I had anything I hate it

yeah maybe maybe

[Music]

I still want to get

I don't know

I don't know

right yeah yeah

[Music]

I'm trying and trying and I'm trying

there

[Music]

I didn't get that in

when I connected letters

no no

[Music]

himself

done

[Applause]

[Music]

oh yeah

[Music]

well

um

[Music]

oh this is really everything

this ruined everything

I messed up everything in last night I

had it I was going to win

but now

many times

thank you

[Music]

first connects down there we go

which life wasn't this thick ass

previous of him

[Music]

[Music]

I think it's possible

come on

I think it was to get some green Bush

anyway make my time on this track no

you'll face oxide's best time and I

doubt you can beat that

there has to be another one uh no I'm

not going to do this

no

I'm going to see what the ghost is like

this is just ridiculous

this is used

[Music]

thank you

yeah and of course it that's that tricky

and we're straight in of course of

course I was busy striking by okay let

me just see how this does

[Music]

even though I did that

[Music]

perfectly or something

yeah it's definitely that's fine

[Music]

[Music]

both times now

you don't have to be toxic but a

character but personally yeah

my biggest problem

would be um

I'll just started

[Music]

he said I want to see details from the

start I don't want my cats do the type

chart and then

use the time chart one more time

[Music]

but what else you need I mean I don't

want to be stream with two rappers

yeah

and I usually go for three hours so

he should talk about something else

I don't know

[Music]

but who's friends

[Music]

oh I'll stop but that's much for me

that's better

like how much is

this is the best skills academy

best attempt ever because we're doing

something the best coast

trying not to try personally

it will be

yeah

well I'm not sure yeah

he didn't worry about me messing up any

comments

thank you

now

[Music]

and uh the bad times

did I see myself

well let's see if you can beat my

fastest time on this track

and

let's see

let's see how quick that kills this

is what

[Music]

at least my first bus we had to start

let's see here it is part anyway

it just it is

anymore

baby speed is not the correct option

using a character that is not built for

anyways all right

an advantage

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

go

you guys got obviously you guys 200

Stevie final time

but not sure why I got all that speed at

the end from I went

wait

that was fun

terrible stream

then I just play fresh fresh tomorrow

then

[Music]

I got something against

Sam

is the

yeah

but now we're using a different bunny

yeah so on the 27th I will do the

karaoke to my best best abilities

which aren't much

so I hope everyone survives to eat

so yeah basically there are many places

of the world I hope I hope you're from

somewhere in that point

[Music]

okay kids team thank you does this count

as many 100 in game I didn't unlock the

cat that extra character

so techno didn't but I could add it as

an extra note that that's a thing to do

I guess it's good to take out this

hundred percent again

I did like 100

it counts I didn't understand the story

I guess

so

here says

101 so it counts

it's not like I'm going to continue

playing it tomorrow I didn't like to

wear but

yes

I don't know

[Music]

I don't know

mm-hmm

hey

[Music]

I wanted to read a channel I'm following

but apparently I am

not allowed to

I'm apparently banned from that channel

that was a surprise I'm still following

the channel so I'm not sure Instagram

banned and follow me at the same time so

let's not rate that channel in that case

I have not done anything

and I obviously can't write anything

because I'm bad

so

and

you're probably not saying who's inside

[Music]

that was weird

very weird

have I done

I'm not a troublemaker

when let's go and visit penny has been

here a few times he has been nice

I think it's I don't know he's right at

that time but he's playing Tomb Raider

that's basically his thing

and a doing

what he calls no loads nomads

which I guess is basically not saving

and loading during the game I don't know

I've never asked exactly what it means

that's just what I am seeing

and no match basically

no healing during the games and you have

to survive with your health you have

so

much money

yeah

I don't see I'm not sure what I'm

supposed to do I can't send them a

message I guess I'll I don't know

[Music]

what to see we'll see yes characters

doing the 27th that is in three days and

it will be for if you don't want to

convert these times

and it is 16 my time and it will happen

17 so that's one hour from now

so your time plus one hour that's when

it starts

I guess it's same as the easiest way to

meet you

guys

but you got to all these times here you

should probably find your time

including some extra Arrangements

what's out guys

I'm excited empty nervous too I'll do my

best
