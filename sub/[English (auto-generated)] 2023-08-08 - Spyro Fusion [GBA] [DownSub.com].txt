oh no picture
or sound there we go
[Music]
welcome tea my career missions
[Music]
and now
this is the last round of this game I
only got 90 more cards and I have not
opened my document off instructions
it is nice music
terrible game
honestly enough to have another game
either
people have said that this game it's a
lot of Auto scrollers so it's like a bad
game but it's not as terrible as people
have made it out to be
I don't drink it
but it could have been so much worse
seasonal Vice better game on honestly
after playing through a lot of these
bunions season API is not a bad game
[Music]
it's just the speed waste that you're
ruining speed is nice
it's a decent thing
like a below decent game but it's not
garbage
so I got 181 cars I need 200.
so I got 19 more yet
so
some of these cars are very interesting
yet the reason why I have a guide is I
really need a guide I wouldn't be able
to get all all the cards without the
guide and here's why you
two first cards step one
when you load you save and then you're
going to the secret menu
[Music]
and then you type in the word
oh
vanilla
[Music]
for some reason they have removed the
vowels they have using digits for for it
and
[Music]
code accepted you have received a
hitting card
that's one of the cards and then you
have to input another one
which in this case is
a soybean
[Music]
cards and now we can back out and check
and it says 183 2
of the 19 cards has already been
collected and I'm not even gone into the
game yet
[Music]
secret menu yep that's his spanking
yeah it doesn't sort of goods because
it's when it comes to collecting these
cards so
now in the game
[Music]
next thing next thing I should do
[Music]
is
um
[Music]
let's move on
to where
[Music]
yes I have you're not an enemy
[Music]
I have one
can chase it don't care about that
out there
oops I have one card in the tech Park so
I need to go all the way to Tech Park
ing don't care about that
[Music]
I love you jump into the fire
through the planet Flames
nope
take damage again
[Music]
kill it
[Music]
moving along that's a good sign
I have to damage again this is
a bit a bit on the chaotic side for me
the exit wasn't there
it might be up here I don't remember
oh there it is
jungle
[Music]
dude
this does not sound like crash music
[Music]
I'm having on towards the right to move
on to the next region
because basically on the
first screen you move yeah I need to get
that green gem somehow
no
and then I need to find a portal
the portal would be anyway
[Music]
oh yeah
[Music]
green gems
yes I have not gotten all the gems in
the uh
the bonfire jungle things
we're just flying across here
[Music]
and then I was jumping across here
and then jump across here and then it
showed up but then it was like
yes I have not found only now I found
all the gems the non-red gems in the
second half of Jumper the one part
jungle
I'll get there back to this level that's
that's an interesting level
easy one
[Music]
excuse me
dude
oh
[Music]
I need to get to tick Park first
foreign
[Music]
this is back
[Music]
I don't know
and it Sparks taught me
[Music]
all right Sparks is dead
you're nice
[Music]
that's enough like this
maybe it was some thing I could jump on
here
nope
I
forgot how to get the
Tech Park oh here
wait a minute
this doesn't help me
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
when
I don't remember
[Music]
yeah it's it's up there
but I don't remember how I get up there
[Music]
do you remember
[Music]
[Music]
all right there's more here
sending me
this is how
[Music]
well
can I meet you
there we go
[Music]
jump over you
and there we go
yeah no extra gems take part finally now
in Tech park there is a motorbike shop
somewhere
[Music]
this music is not good however
foreign
we got someone here
I've got a back porch that I built oh
handy
with a hot tub and a charcoal green some
laid back chairs and a great old big old
TV wait
five porch it's like enclosed so the TV
doesn't get wet I got a fridge from all
the ice cold Bears so you can probably
see I got that Big Deck energy
foreign
[Music]
works if you're
like
like speaking you see London English
I got that big thick energy I don't I
don't know how to speak
foreign
English
[Music]
yes there should be a green card here
I'm missing is that a green card I need
can I think can I stick in the work
that's not the card I need
and that's not the card I need it's the
wrong color
and that's not the card I need
this different type of 69
once again
the wrong color
like at least at least have the jam be
at least 100 chance
right wrong color again this should be a
green card
this is the only the only
I'm sorry that's good the only shock
thing I need to do wrong color
okay nice
happy Tuesday pumpkin hello
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
normally you would just say I built a
back porch
before I built my own backboard
that's a very
that's a very poetic way of drinking it
is nice I couldn't at least three
hundreds his name
is
there it is
nope that can I stick in the work again
124
119.
oh there it is again come on
you're indoor yay I got it
[Music]
and that means I'm done here
and to um
[Music]
oh wait
that didn't work
I thought that was supposed to work
oh wait do I have to
[Music]
there we go
attack
dude
so in one part jungle
[Music]
it is um
one thing I have to do
[Music]
and it's the jam hop even though it
appears as any other optional level
portal this level
spiral come on this
portal is not optional
and someone said someone said Jam hop is
a game mode that does not describe how
you're supposed to play it
nice tricks one
yeah there's many gems as you can you
have to get 100
oh yeah they couldn't fit 10 on the
previous page flap
and yeah
at least I don't pay to try yeah they
can't fit 10 in this screen
[Music]
okay what you have to do
oh wow these movements is very quick you
get a 100 gems so I started with
114.
okay I start with 120.
that means I should end on oh my this
this is ability game
neither gem nor hop you both jam and hot
two so far I started with hundred wait
oh yeah if you if you jump off the
platform it disappears
I started returning 24 I just
[Music]
wow wow he's his moment he's so he's so
quick
[Music]
let's start at 125.
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
and he's really quick
[Music]
now oh
when I got the force of the way
things kind of floaty floating as I had
no problem with it's easy besides
motions and design movements it's really
really fast
[Music]
and also then when he does a little
[Music]
I just have to get used to
clicking it
[Music]
so when I reach
200 gems I'm halfway so that counts as a
misstep of the platform
[Music]
my very quick touch I just touched the
platform slightly and it did not count
as me standing there was a as you could
see there sometimes the platforms are
completely random and sometimes they can
just run out of platform
[Music]
so I'm doing good so far
[Music]
ten more to halfway that means I got 40.
[Music]
I jumped off the platform without
picking up the gym
at the Jammers oh
oh I became a cheating
stupid Giant game
it definitely doesn't don't move as
quickly in the home world
[Music]
in their their homework scene
[Music]
yeah you cannot you have to get 100 gems
here
[Music]
now
way too easy to just slip off after from
two
hmm
317.
[Music]
this has an account therefore how many
[Music]
sign movements gets me every time
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
oh wait why did I jump
[Music]
now why did that count as me standing on
it
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
okay now I got to halfway point
and the platforms I have the size and
and I had steadily
[Music]
we started with 271
I need to reach 3 hunts and one
ah this is going to take a while
now we said that gem Counting
[Music]
nice day
[Music]
now
[Music]
290.
[Music]
that's what I started with
[Music]
nice
[Music]
so 340 is halfway point
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
again it counted as me standing on it
this one I did have
so I can apply the jump and yeah like
that quickly jump off it I didn't try to
do anything just happened sometimes
[Music]
that does not count me standing on it
but just slightly touching it
well I'm trying to touch another
platform now I'm swimming 40 attractive
[Music]
thank you
I mean it's Kansas 319
[Music]
there we go
[Music]
it has something to do with me
[Music]
jumping off a platform the Platforms in
vicinity
[Music]
counts as me jumping off them
[Music]
now
if inspired 20 more
[Music]
and that was changes
again now
14 more
walking away
[Music]
[Music]
that's 1 26 or something or whatever it
was it should be halfway
[Music]
such a random number also anyways
[Music]
again at least you got 400 now
at 500 I'm done
[Music]
and then sleeping halfway too easy all
right Mr champ
[Music]
nice switching platform
[Music]
a little smaller
these smaller platforms one two three
land on
now why did I jump
oh nice
[Music]
more of that please
halfway to halfway
also known as a quarterly
31 done
[Music]
more to halfway
[Music]
that's delicious
five more to halfway
[Music]
and one more
and now the platformer halved
[Music]
and knowing
[Music]
[Music]
maybe I don't know if you should count
the gems as I picked them up I don't I
don't know if it helps me mentally or
something
could maybe help
[Music]
I don't know
[Music]
same thing
[Music]
hello I need to pick the other one up
[Music]
okay one two or fifty two
[Music]
three four
five six seven
one that didn't help me
Valentine's lives
I wish I could throw away two Gems or
something
[Music]
I mean
[Music]
I can't do that
you can have an offset of two
[Music]
[Music]
thank you fifteen
[Music]
[Music]
25.
[Music]
I think I'm blanket is with my mind when
I know how many gems I have
[Music]
gratifying
[Music]
that's when I'm performed by when I do
know the champion
[Music]
she's not the same plan everyone
[Music]
45
[Music]
6
secret platform what seven what eight
Forty Nine and that happened
[Music]
hey
the wrong window selected
[Music]
hello Hicks
[Music]
thank you for redeeming this music
[Music]
kitten and papa wolf here
and I'm currently doing a jam challenge
I have to pick up 100 of these gems
without falling off
[Music]
as I almost did it immediately let's
let's not
um
yeah let's ignore that
oh thank you for the the Beats
some nice of you
I will one day make a funny animation I
don't know what what are we doing
[Music]
[Music]
my stomach
can this be like
no cars and I gotta say fast yay
and how many bits have you donate in
total now
[Music]
let me take a quick break
[Music]
110 that is
eight eight hundred and ninety
[Music]
890 bits from the cute
[Music]
and a kitten
from the kids
[Music]
do it
okay five more four three two
no wait this is halfway
now the platforms are small this is a
large one that one has already spawned
[Music]
I always wear like twice as many
platform or something
[Music]
but now
I need to reached 651 and then am I done
[Music]
I landed next to the platform
next to the plate form
and I will continue
[Music]
actually I will do this
[Music]
there we go 600
23
700. I did perform the best when I
started around hundreds like that
[Music]
sometimes it again
[Music]
oh nice
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
I guess they're supposed to be random
but it needs to be some check to make
sure there's always like contact forms
available
[Music]
make sure there's always at least one
channel preferably like two platforms
[Music]
Contour that platform
plate form
find more
[Music]
[Music]
yeah that's when I should add some as
many platforms as possible to spawn
when it still can be big
[Music]
I'm not I'm not going for that but it
just happened to be the case
[Music]
come on
[Music]
plate forms
[Music]
now we slip off
[Music]
this music is cute I mean
I guess
maybe it's very good music stupid game
666.
[Music]
yeah I'm not I'm not doing any
speed depending record in this level
[Music]
this is like the only non-sized
scrolling leveling spider there are a
few more but
they are inspired in this game
[Music]
they are
amazing every level Inspire is a side
scroller and I don't know why
[Music]
thank you
oh I missed it
[Music]
700.
[Music]
yeah I have no idea how many gems I'm at
at the moment
[Music]
70s continue
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
this level didn't look too difficult but
I didn't realize how spider moves
[Music]
[Music]
when
that didn't go
oh
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
forgot about that
[Music]
if you jump the platform falls down
[Music]
but if there is another platform
almost on top of the platform you're
standing on it will erase there as you
jumping off both platforms at the same
time
then you lose a platform that you wanted
to stand on
[Music]
it has happened to me a few times it
doesn't happen often
oh well that's safe and I'm losing it
[Music]
oh
okay that's saying what did I say it
said 638
[Music]
landed between them
[Music]
so close so I wish there was some gems
around this I could adjust the gem count
but this is quite quite some ways to
pick up chimps
[Music]
when I had some seven over
seven over
[Music]
so I just need them seven over
whatever number
[Music]
57 for halfway
and 907
when I'm done
[Music]
yep got that one two
[Music]
three
[Music]
gems so far
[Music]
ding ding
[Music]
40 gems
skipping off well I saved it
[Music]
remember
if
you are about to lose don't give up
sometimes
[Music]
you might just get what you need to
survive
[Music]
well I saw that slipped off there
oh
[Music]
imagine extensive Army famous
[Music]
I don't even need these games anymore
[Music]
well actually do you need them
[Music]
for some money back shops whatever is
stupid
[Music]
they should have made it because
halfway point they shank this double
platform to single platforms
and then after another 50 gems as
Michelle said if halfway is 50 amps so
after another 50 amps the game is over
they should used to have a reduced
platform to zero in Sierra platforms and
just having floating gems combines
allowing you to grab a few extra gems
[Music]
or make the bathrooms even smaller
now maybe that was a silly
[Music]
yeah I'm happy that it then sets
hundreds I know
[Music]
that I'm done
[Music]
ah halfway point
[Music]
I didn't even get the jam
[Music]
yeah I did some scary Maneuvers thing
thank you
[Music]
I'm very reacted by that can I save it
[Music]
now we actually want to be able to see
because it would kept out at 9999
[Music]
it still counts but
which is a good thing
[Music]
but that means when it caps out I can
just die 10 times
of course it's still quite a process but
but then I kind of have a level in gem
counting
because when it reaches 999 then I will
be done but not for this run
[Music]
I guess
yeah that's the next one
should at least be able to cap it out
as I say I'm almost falling up I need to
learn that I shouldn't look at the
middle of the platform what matters is
the bottom of the platform
[Music]
almost missed something
so halfway point two three
[Music]
four five six seven
eight
nine
[Music]
and one two
three
four five
six seven
eight
nine twenty one
two three four
[Music]
five six
seven eight
nine thirty
one
two
three please continue like this nope
four five
[Music]
one more time
here we go when it reaches 999 I will be
done
[Music]
[Music]
this game is very different
yeah
it's not easy to make a mistake
some games is nice with with the whole
platform thing which I assume is an
unintentional design
[Music]
and also how come these platforms are
able to float being able to
with their hold the spirals away
or mess
[Music]
but as soon as he jumps off the platform
that's apparently too heavy for it to be
able to handle
[Music]
now it's a strong platform fell where
are all the platforms wasn't a single
one
cheating game
okay oh no they seems like Japan
[Music]
yeah
it's it's it's a slight pain
[Music]
subscription
[Music]
no
huh
no wait that's this is good
[Music]
it's time to make the platform
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
lands
[Music]
which the platforms can handle
perfectly
[Music]
I didn't get that one the platform
failed
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I need a bit more strategically slower
but safer
[Music]
[Music]
now room set for fell again
that was a halfway point too not too
many but two gems from halfway
five times
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
I'm definitely better at handling
spiders motion
[Music]
promotions
emotions oh that was a dangerous jump I
couldn't I could have made those
platforms fall again
[Music]
well
I'll be trying and trying
I'll be right back I got to get my trash
being back to my house is someone
stealing
trash Bean stealing
[Music]
yeah and
TV
take mine back at some point
I usually forget about it and I'll do it
in the morning next day
[Music]
they used to pick up the trash very
early in the morning but they seem to do
it later now to ensure that I'm not
missing it I I put the the bin out
at like the night before so it's already
out there in the morning
[Music]
they are picking it up later I'm still
going to do it because he stood on it he
stood on it and I want to write
ah what's it stupid game
um
[Music]
and because in case I do sleep for too
long I'm not missing me
yep garbage
I'm picking
[Music]
but yeah and then they just pick it up
and sometimes I don't notice when I do
it and then I kind of forgot about
the bin
he felt sweet
oh my this game
two platforming for the dark suit pose
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
everyone has fun
[Music]
now if it's no jump I didn't do a double
Jam
[Music]
no not stealing I usually put it in the
alley
or the trash people to come pick it up
on Monday and I kind of forgot so
anything yeah yeah
it's kind of like minions because I
forgot to forget about it and it just
danced there
[Music]
the other change we stayed once
thank you they picked up in Friday
morning now they pick it up on Tuesday
morning
[Music]
so when I put it out on Thursday night
and I didn't collect it on Friday
while I just let it stand outside there
until Tuesday morning until they've
actually picked it up I mean
all right I do get a paper on it I just
wasn't paying attention I went
[Music]
but it certainly some way to figure out
which take this
[Music]
I have so much stuff going on in my life
sorry can't just really keep pay
attention to when
private stays changed
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
yeah I guess
[Music]
[Music]
I should max out the gem counts doing
I wish that was simply should make
something
[Music]
no but when it maxes out I have
collected a hundred
[Music]
[Music]
and at 49
it's halfway
[Music]
and it comes
[Music]
I should write this to the other side
[Music]
wow
now don't do that
Oh I thought I didn't land on it I'm
doing so many mistakes
mistakes
at least it doesn't take a long time to
die I'm actually like really like it
[Music]
the United game that takes time Stein
[Music]
oh nice name no
[Music]
I got 10 gems
[Music]
[Music]
my jump
[Music]
as you can go for every gem in the
beginning here I mean not only to speed
up the process but
also to where
[Music]
you couldn't get more used to how
spiders moving around
[Music]
like getting better at
the moving around basically
[Music]
nothing I've seen there was a moment oh
nice scene
[Music]
[Music]
and that's 49
the platform will half
[Music]
getting some multiple big Platforms in
no I wasn't supposed to do that
write the platform to the end
[Music]
please switch background
[Music]
now wow wow
[Music]
I'm going to take this to the game
playing itself
well
[Music]
so hard to land on these platforms
[Music]
oh that was dangerous
[Music]
oh no
[Music]
11th from doing it
annoying
and this is the Stream
it was about to be an easy game please
[Music]
and the Crash game
I'm interesting about definition
[Music]
all right
too too many gems so after I mix it out
I need to collect two more gems
[Music]
so I need to reached 1001 gems which I
can't hold but
[Music]
good thing this camera doesn't check if
the dam counter increases or something
that would be typically signed I like it
it checks what the gem value is when the
mini game starts and it just Waits
something to jam value reaches a
specific value which is competing with
here
if it maxes out
[Music]
another thing that could happen in a
game if there is
[Music]
yeah
this is
[Music]
one
[Music]
I'm like five gems ahead or something
five times before it myself
[Music]
Russia basically max out it
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
platforms
[Music]
which is what the Platforms in this
reunited in in the code
some of the objects are actually called
platforms
[Music]
monster call
platforms some are called platforms wait
this this one did not form
one
like the rest
oh yes
now I need a jump
[Music]
now I messaged him
[Music]
switch platform
[Music]
I wasn't supposed to do that
[Music]
now
[Music]
Mr platform
is quite far away from
getting 100 anyway but but still
[Music]
there's one move so I haven't used is
this
just
[Music]
I didn't mean to do that but I now I got
899
[Music]
this is the number I want
[Music]
and also also one person had a
suggestion or like a tip or whatever
on the gem Hub
and that was um if you mixed up your jam
is tight 10 times
and then you will succeed gem hop after
and maxing out your jump count again
and that is true assuming you can do
jump off without failing which I can't
I can't jump up with that feeling
[Music]
especially when the platforms do that
DP platform
[Music]
[Music]
nice jump good job spider
[Music]
I haven't touched it in my mind no one
has done dehydrates
I highlighted myself
[Music]
[Music]
nice double Jam
[Music]
yeah currently just being like this
[Music]
in the higher density are platforms
[Music]
wow
now the platform pan
[Music]
where are my platforms
[Music]
all right
he stands on the platform and then he
just falls off like
why
why is that a scene
why had the program that further to be a
possibility how do they program that we
have positively if you land on the
platform why does the character suddenly
not stand on planet anymore
the different line of code that checks
that if you if you're following speech
should stop and on different code that
checks if you're actually standing on a
platform it should not fall or something
like that so my following speed stops
but I'm still not staying on a platform
so I start falling again or something
[Music]
no
immediately Fame I don't know
one of those superstitions in the game
[Music]
[Music]
Thinking time what
[Music]
are you thinking about time
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
vacuum bags I will be able to vacuum too
[Music]
for all this purchasing of the other
cleaning supplies have kind of
trained my money
I did that again
so
[Music]
[Music]
where are all the platforms someone
supposed to do this
randomly he has failed because there are
enough time for him
[Music]
that is quite unfair
[Music]
[Music]
today oh
[Music]
eat them
[Music]
okay then
I am I really have I'm really helpful I
am really thankful for your previous
help that allowed me to get all this
cleaning supply in the first place
I haven't I haven't really said how
how relieved like I felt after being
able to
get so much of the stuff I need
[Music]
now heck energy
I have to cleaning yeah I'll get back to
clean too
I put so many bags of Gucci garbage
[Music]
funny thing is
um
[Music]
when I mentioned that I have a lot of
bags I need to like
put some contacts and Company something
that I can just throw it away I guess
there's like
these companies you can rent
basically a big bag which I guess what
they call it big bag
[Music]
just fill it with General garbage
and then at the end of the day or
whenever you
[Music]
agree Japan they pick it up and then
you pay one
[Music]
one
lump sum
[Music]
and then take whatever is in it
[Music]
now it's snipping off again
[Music]
[Music]
but yeah when I said that I like him I
need something like this one of the
common things several people said like
yeah but don't you have like a garbage
collection every week like yeah but
[Music]
I can feed like
I have like about like 60 liter bags
which I filled with garbage the bin is
120 liters it's like a bit like two bags
in it and again got
30 bags
[Music]
that's 15 weeks
[Music]
it's the next four months worth of
garbage
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
our small platforms
come on
[Music]
now now
[Music]
I'm really hard to determine if I can
land on platform
I'm getting so far and then I just do
something stupid I mean
[Music]
I'm getting so far another morning
I don't even know that's if that's new
[Music]
I'm done for now
that forms
[Music]
I would be cleaning for you
[Music]
that's what I can offer a team
[Music]
that's so cute yes
[Music]
oh
I'll put on a mace dress and I'll do the
cleaning
money
[Music]
[Music]
I am watching that platform I didn't
even stand on it
[Music]
so that's 20 gems
I think
[Music]
[Music]
8 49 15.
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
now now
all right
I'm making so many ceiling mistakes ten
[Music]
ushers and 90. 18.
[Music]
3
[Music]
17.
[Music]
hey Mommy
bye
it's not enough
events we tucked the path from getting
hot in a plane
[Music]
19 left
[Music]
[Music]
18 left
[Music]
I forgot about that
[Music]
60 left
[Music]
I said it
didn't make double jumps more often but
yes
50 left
[Music]
I'm so half the size
[Music]
come on spider don't sleep off platforms
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
again this is a high density of
platforms
the third left
[Music]
now I slipped off the platform
thank you
seems like most of my desk currently
just in sleeping off the platform she's
not like
[Music]
so I actually jump so close to the edge
of the platform but like
[Music]
it is like the annoying to see land on
the platform I'm not pressing a single
button and then you just pause it
hello dude
I am
currently struggling trying to get 100
gems in this game out there's a pet dog
and a nice
expected it to be but I need 100 for me
to be able to continue the game
this game out locks out
the rest of the game
[Music]
um
[Music]
this is nice and funny makes
[Music]
nothing in this kitchen
this
this game is
it's a high level of move
[Music]
closest I think is like
I got 85 Gems or so just don't count it
showing me so I just have to keep track
of how many gems I started I started
with 9 101 so take whatever numbers they
subtract one and uh
which is also why I I have to start
because you can only hold 999 Champs
so I don't want it to cap out so I can't
see how much I have
[Music]
you can do it fun I'm doing my best
platform just decided to die
platforms should only fall off all when
you step off them
[Music]
foreign foreign
[Music]
Ty you press the ones to jump and stress
the second time to start flying or
gliding
[Music]
and then in a hair stain they changed it
so
the second jump does the
uh a second jump
slipped off the platform
but you hold the jump button to fly
and release the jump button just to drop
from the air which side I actually find
to be quite
good controls
[Music]
I didn't pick up the gem I never stood
on the platform that platform decided to
fall down you write things so well
yeah sometimes I just mess up time then
he's usually sleeping off at that point
[Music]
yeah
butterfly in this game you have to tap
jump mash the jump button fly because
this camera is not an annoying as it is
you also have to type
[Music]
okay floating down
and also if you jump from one platform
and another platform is too close
the game will consider you jumping from
that platform
[Music]
would you technically never stood on
which is very annoying if you want to
escape from one platform to another and
then both decides to fall but
[Music]
that was a bit stupid of me to do I
think this should be halfway point which
means that platforms are smaller because
they weren't small enough
[Music]
I think it's because
financing isn't exactly locked to the
platformer
[Music]
he's he's shaking when he stands on it
so his positions
isn't properly updated with the platform
and I think I thought I was going to
sleep off and yeah and also you can
stand quite far off the platform and I
think that's what's happening
on one frame he is technically standing
on a platform but the next frame the
duty is shaking he sleeps off
I think that's
what's happening
[Music]
now
I landed next to the platform
[Music]
I got the kitty spider
there we go another every time you die
the music just starts somewhere because
that's nothing
more Spyro and he's stupid
there's not much going on his brain
thank you King
beautiful
now this is supposed to be a simple Game
Boy game
[Music]
um
[Music]
I will get all
[Music]
well the girl needs for me to get one
200 cards
and I got
[Music]
183 at the moment
this game mode will give a card and will
unlock it for other cards for me to get
a chance to win
[Music]
hopefully they aren't as annoying as
this game
[Music]
and I have lift up how to get the cards
I'm a bit of a cheater but two of the
cards you have to insert passwords to
get
those passwords is it password I don't
know uh or not even anywhere in the game
so you have to look up them even get
those cards
[Music]
it's lift off the platform but it didn't
count as him standing on the platform
they didn't phone sucks okay
[Music]
come on now come on Spire all right
students have switched platform
that's fine I
[Music]
yeah it can be more like this
[Music]
where are my platforms where are the
platforms
I need platforms to stand on
[Music]
I will not switch to Nest platform I'll
switch to oh and on this platform
oh I wasn't close enough for me to pick
it up
[Music]
okay now I should have switched
[Music]
I'm gonna write this out to the other
side you know what else close
[Music]
I'm not switching now I'm switching out
those are the dangerous because yeah
that gun has missed anyway
[Music]
oh that was also close because that
platform could have fallen
[Music]
uh 10 more or something like five more
Ah
that's I don't I don't know how close I
was but I was a Christmas sister I've
been so far
hmm
[Music]
that means 999 and I will be done but I
have to start healthy
I was so careful and everything
[Music]
[Music]
it's not exactly how the music goes but
[Music]
this is my karaoke now I need to decide
for when I should do the next karaoke
[Music]
I I I've decided this I will pick a date
and time
so people can in in advance determine if
they are able to what happened there
show up or not
then if you are able to show up
and you get to pick a song which which
you have to tell me beforehand so I can
prepare
[Music]
you could technically pick a song even
if you're not going to show up but that
doesn't seem
yeah I am like it doesn't seem like
there's a point state
I assume you want to
see me hear me sing it
and I want
a fabulary pizza so
[Music]
if you want to hear the same song again
I guess you can spend your
one request on that
[Music]
so I'll be full fully considered on this
for now
and that was my conversation
being a simple Game Boy games I'm trying
to play Super Mario Land and this game
is
foreign
I don't remember when there was it last
time was it like
it was a thirsty
and it was like
17 you can see I think
[Music]
so just add yours just add your offset
to 17 remember to add additional one if
it's summer time
and
[Music]
that's your local time all right all
right yeah maybe I should have already
[Music]
[Music]
I'm a torn bunny
[Music]
oh yeah yeah
[Music]
oh you're 11-2 by me
[Music]
currency access to well I guess
I don't remember which it's those are
crying singing
[Music]
um
nice nice there I will get it
I remember last time he sang it was in
27th of class oh it's last month oh yeah
because you just always yes another
thing yes I meant Thursday in case I
sent this thing I remember because
that's the way I was working and had no
days off and I had a little break in
between where I could watch the karaoke
stream it was really good I really liked
it yeah I have a really good singing
voice very beautiful
myself
but yeah I had to be that anime
otherwise hey I would have been bothered
by
[Music]
okay I'm glad you think I have a
very beautiful singing voice
even if I
don't like me
[Music]
what's the
only one song was removed
and the Eurovision song
and all other songs are available to
listen to on the vote if you want to
hear my voice my singing
[Music]
it was um
[Music]
it was it was fun
I do want to do it again yeah
I was trying to pick a different week
thing or anything in lunch and the
weekend some weekend
and then add some time
whatever time I don't know
[Music]
so I'm
doing at the half point
three knots
this must be a half point
it's still not happening
what ah there we go
that wasn't the platform I was calling
it foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
because I did that one twice and there's
a bunch of
[Music]
instrumental in it but
[Music]
um I guess I did speak about
instrumental to avoid the detection to
trigger
but I was quite in some of the
instrumentalist one and it's also a
quite a well-known song
the one that was detected it was it was
Innovation songs I guess it's
white known and it did quite well I
think in 2011 I think it was forum
but
[Music]
stand there
I don't know sensing the other songs
probably was more popular more well
known
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
when is my platforms uh
[Music]
I'm getting there but like 60 games or
so
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I did practice and well when did you do
that game that's a cheating
[Music]
oh yeah
[Music]
I
[Music]
think I'm like plus four gems
[Music]
54
[Music]
and before
it's a halfway point
[Music]
yes
[Music]
that does mean I need to reach
um
1004 gems when I'm done
[Music]
and good luck on your stream
[Music]
I haven't kept saying
and backpack of this kitchen side I
don't know what this stream it means
I guess it's this one that makes noise
and every time you die it is she
has this sound
[Music]
the only only tasty thing I never would
only does is
[Music]
[Music]
probably got some dance memes
[Music]
different things
[Music]
I'm familiar with platoon
but it's interesting different games
[Music]
[Music]
wait I can
[Music]
careful that spiral you almost died
do you want to die spider I don't think
you want that
[Music]
and trust me
[Music]
well considering not using 10 gems for
failing I guess I technically doesn't
die
[Music]
I don't remember what I had before I
started
[Music]
traveling just
go on
in some TVs
[Music]
platform I missed I jumped on it I
jumped on a different platform
not good if you think Crank That from
spider
oh
[Music]
I lived at the gym campaign
[Music]
four three two
one
[Applause]
after I don't know how long
but I did it I successfully yeah I've
got this sheep
yay
[Music]
I
only took two hours
[Music]
maybe more like one and a half hour
[Music]
in every game I have no I'm not the one
to give up don't mind me giving up on
those two other games
he concluded amazing
thank you
so
I need to find the money back shop where
I can simply buy three cars I need nice
trick spider
oh and also that and now I unlock the
sheep chase sheep Shades cheap chains
[Music]
and yes
escape the Sheep jump

so I just have to if I do this this is
an email game and unlocked because I did
the gem

spell too soon there are no spokes here
[Music]
yeah
oh why was that part called thing called
again gem run Gem Rush I was playing it
for one and a half hours which doesn't
mean I remember what he's gone
[Music]
I mean quite close to the Sheep but is
it that the Sheep
okay let me check
[Music]
okay so I found the ship can't touch me
since when did this sheep get style yeah
I'm saying so hurting
[Music]
ding ding ding
dude
[Music]
I wouldn't mind like
this music being played on like
not being like a Game Boy quality of
music
and but if they
made it there we go
you did it that means I should get 25
gems which I actually don't get
and that's the r sheep
are the r shape
nothing you watch sheep but or she
Hey where's the money back shop isn't it
[Music]
gem hot
it was the hopping I forgot about the
hopping
[Music]
revenge of the sea
the sheet can finally
back spiral
hello Money Bank
is this the one
spin the wheel now
this is not a spin the wheel shop it's
just a pay director for the card shop
[Music]
so
and I don't think there was another shot
here
[Music]
[Music]
spider's dead
I find it annoying contact type things
these ones
I can't look at that Tree Top knife
it's there like is is there something
down here I don't know I can't I can't
change
[Music]
I was lowering it same speed as a
platform maybe he has a shop up here
[Music]
come on money Banks I want to give you
money why are you hiding
why are you hiding your shop
hello class have you seen money bags I
know it's weird that I'm looking for him
[Music]
and a person who has no idea about the
whole
it crash spider crossover wow wet fresh
hmm
[Music]
trash themed scientists what is this
[Music]
I have to keep money Banks money that is
something I thought I would never hear
somebody actually wanting to give money
back money and that was quite incentives
is this the one
bye card yes
I want the phone increase shards
and let me Mark the floor spikes
but on a corner flush by it
and
the level
[Music]
usually supposed to
wow interesting
cream money bag shop
that must mean that I get a jungle Alice
man
you must have mixed up two of the cards
only the two cards are actually
different between the North American and
European version which doesn't make
sense I think they just mixed up the
cars in this in the guide
I think I got all the cards I can't get
in here though
so
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Applause]
yes now I see yes yes
[Music]
thank you
okay let me
[Music]
oh
[Music]
you see there's a gem there how did I
get there
I need to get after that that's the
address I've seen there
I need to get up onto that can I get up
to on a tree no
[Music]
yes platform
now
[Music]
yeah how am I
how am I supposed to get that painting
[Music]
I'm so confused
there is an enemy here so I must be able
to get up there
[Music]
[Music]
I tried
[Music]
because because
I don't see any other way to get higher
like
this is the highest I can go maybe a
secret door I don't know
yeah
you know because I'm reducing so much
High
everything
[Music]
yeah I guess it goes through I'm not
supposed to go through
the jam is bottom please I'm supposed to
get up there and then fall down
and it's not like I'm getting another
ability
[Music]
it's not like he learns one jump or
anything
[Music]
felt confused
fail confused
[Music]
equipment
[Music]
you see this sheep noise for the rabbits
I am so confused
might have been misplaced never mistake
no but
that doesn't make any sense because
people have completed this game
the whole
[Music]
when it didn't look it up
[Music]
when you really need to look up how to
get to the gym
[Music]
huh I didn't expect that to happen that
was if I expected to happen
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
like any I mean it's not like you can
grab
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
this doesn't make sense of the entrance
day where does it where does it lead him
[Music]
anyway
Queens
back out loud
and there we go back to time to go to
five mountains okay
so this should be another sheep level
here
[Music]
somewhere
here we go sheep Shakedown
blame the Sheep
[Music]
nice
how many how many is this outfit
[Music]
I mean
signs from 5 to 423 is
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
okay I see
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
yeah that was close now I just need to
find the money back shop
oh jam Rush
no thanks
[Music]
it's green bean pain
oh
what spider is the one that needs to
screaming pain
when I came running back shopping then
he has more cards to sell me
and Sparks
I'm just screaming
in the screen
and there we go
please just let me mystery game
now
not looking at mystery cards Junior has
been playing purchase cards
[Music]
laughs
[Music]
okay and let me check the other area
they said it doesn't look big enough
[Music]
what is this now another Fields yeah I
don't think so I think spider has to end
up with lava
crisis
North yes I'll buy a Newark
that's one of them
rice rip talk I'll take an ice cream
duck
bye with turkey yes
sounds good too
Frozen Riptide yep and the final card
remember and you know who December is
it is Amber Amber
okay it is the kid Amber
so
[Music]
so I need to go back to the uh
Arctic
[Music]
um clips and there should be a sheep
level here too this one in each world
except in the
final word world
maybe because the
foreign
[Music]
Maybe
it is because the levels only appear on
the second world
something to check
even though it's likely not going to get
me here I mean you still need to shake
because you never know
[Music]
I don't think levels appearance looks
oh
there's another gem there
once
because the only cars I see I have left
to pick up is the P sheep and S sheep
apparently so I need to get it there
and it was the uh
level portal which I got from that shop
that I can get by getting this one so
maybe
maybe some cars are
[Music]
nice
who knows there's this I'm using more
gems to pick up
um it's not that easy
[Music]
another
non-red gem somewhere
[Music]
how is it
[Music]
here
[Music]
yeah you must be here then
[Music]
oh well I know where to go now at least
[Music]
oh
[Music]
man
[Music]
um
[Music]
I'm on my way beating this game now
[Music]
unless the game is beating me
[Music]
brush but
fat
[Music]
what's that one the game is beating me
at the moment
[Music]
but but
[Music]
there's nothing for me to do here
[Music]
thank you
it should be at least one other non-red
Germany's in this level that I have not
yet picked up what may I killed me
where can it be
now it feels like I'm in everywhere
[Music]
thank you I've been here
[Music]
or maybe that was the last and
[Music]
non-red Gem and it didn't give me the
card because I only purchased the card
from the shop which I find when all that
I was able to do
and the Sheep level might not be and
this here because it might be in this
area
[Music]
I guess I'll just go around the liquid
then
my name is
[Music]
sorry yeah
[Music]
sorry
my bad
[Music]
oh that was close
no never put in here is it up here
one day
it's not the one I'm looking for
it's going to be very up there it is
no I think
that is
all right the second one might be here
too
[Music]
no
um again
[Music]
thank you
that was a bit too far down
[Music]
there's a shop which I don't care about
[Music]
is it
[Music]
amazing
[Music]
in the whole area here too
I
have to go around
[Music]
this is going to die
[Music]
actually is even quick quick yeah
to do this
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
yes
ah
where is the port and I'm actually
looking for
[Music]
missing a portal
[Music]
yeah well it's supposed to be another
one here
drag and drop nothing more
[Music]
that's from behind
that's the one I'm looking for
[Music]
oh almost in his eyes
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
sometimes you just have to pee as a
sheep
it did I just not pay attention because
again that sheep level was on the second
area so if three of the four sheet
levels I have been able to find has been
in the second area
[Music]
and the one ship level have not been
able to find
and I've been looking around in the
first area here maybe I should just look
in the second area
[Music]
or should I just double check that it
isn't this I'm pretty sure it is a
bicycle Canyon
please be sure now
[Music]
there is no sheep
[Music]
the four levels have sheep in them
[Music]
funny
pink bunnies are to be killed
Queen
[Music]
is something no that's the thing like it
could be here but now
I never not been
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
championship
[Music]
[Music]
beings like I've been almost everywhere
just oh it's obvious that we've not been
somewhere
[Music]
and I don't know where somewhere is
and I don't want to
when I do have the option to look it up
I promise you don't want to
[Music]
I have been here
[Music]
there's this spot lighting those
because the the turn off
and you leave the area
am I done bye I just kind of see where
I've been why I collected the red chance
have been on one of these platforms
[Music]
you can run it back oh
it's not something
ah it is another color gem this is our
area Okay
okay so that's where I have to go
I see now yes there's a platform yeah
okay I found it earlier
I just had to pay a bit more attention
here's level and here's the last one
okay
nothing
anyway here's the sheet
levels for games move flat
[Music]
oh I see
I see this isn't how it's she or sheep
[Music]
there's not time at least
[Music]
[Music]
is the Sheep
you have to bounce in the Sheep if you
miss the Sheep
you have to
be in pain
come on camera
oh breaks with me
from the gym country disappeared
it only needs 30 what
[Music]
all right
see this jam up again
[Music]
it's the platform on his shipment
[Music]
can I see I'm hop but a sheep instead
well at least I had a complete gym hope
before until this one if I could take
this one it is like a harder version of
Gemma come and see stop running so
quickly
nope I was doing so well the more gems
you have the quicker girls yeah this
this isn't what sharing a sheep wants
what I thought it would be but yeah this
this ship is full with gems
I keep gems it seems like it
it's like pain I can see at least keep
the Champs I collected so far
this is the last card I I don't need the
gems
21 the best yeah I do keep the gems
hmm
[Music]
I guess that's all Assassin this next
penalty gem counting is nothing hard to
do
this time the camera is not
yeah sometimes it isn't so
[Music]
stop moving so
be one more yeah I did it
you have one action in car the ice sheep
for sharing
[Music]
and you know what I just want to make
myself a gym company
only because I said I was going to do
that
[Music]
but like that I progressed I got exactly
what I wanted
at least this account before happens
yeah why why didn't the Gemma level have
that you really clearly have a system
for showing again
or if we're having an accounting
why you're just using him
[Music]
it's such a weird game
no I no I know I missed them
all right yeah I assume too many gems
jeans
well so close to maxing it out
oh seven points
seven more
wow
[Music]
I need to continue
[Music]
knee background I got all the cards
[Music]
my xdm's Max cards I'm not going to make
some roots on crash there
I've got all the cards
in the background
but
[Music]
what I should do now
is s whichever depressed
and there
[Music]
anything
[Music]
and then
I got four subscription steps
[Music]
and then I
it's awesome
[Music]
[Music]
I hope it's not a thing
[Music]
oh now it needs a damaging
that's not what I wanted
[Music]
I don't know he's playing two songs at
once or not I can't hear how it sounds
on screen
so I want to mute it for my own sake
so what I will do
is because I don't have all these fire
cards here that's like that let me think
so I will select that
because I have to trade
uh
boom
all you can hear is the one that is on
your stream you can barely hear the
other ones soon it doesn't sound too bad
apparently I mean that doesn't make
sense to me I do here do you not don't
eat it
I don't I don't
[Music]
I don't know I don't know how it sounds
it might sound table
anime
and then I need to trade
one because I
because of how the it works
to trade you must trade
at least one card
and from Bose and
games
and then
all right not
not that card
there you go
and then to to ensure that I keep the
card I trade a card that both teams have
foreign
other cards
so I got all here I got all here got all
here but I do miss some here
I am
and then and also on this screen you
don't you don't even see the cards that
are being changed in I guess you can
