can always return the previous eyes in

order to access the borders and collect

more gems

[Music]

watch out some of these villains will

drop rocks if you get too close well you

can jump above them trapezing or to

perform a headaches don't forget you can

[Music]

except stranger comments

that's Chinese is completely sucking at

my

and then when I'm finished on the 10

chance 2016 gems every time I'm losing

the skinny ever since I don't know the

game could have been again

it's a little bit too punishing

especially since it has bad platforming

to punch someone for okay

oh

[Music]

nice tiny

[Music]

honey

uh with snow ice

[Music]

melt the ice us

[Music]

away

[Music]

maybe I should drop my balls you know

[Music]

[Music]

doesn't matter though

[Music]

nothing much exciting game

[Music]

I heard I've heard words

[Music]

this isn't bad I mean this is bad but

this isn't terrible it's just just I

think so foreign

thank you

[Music]

I'm still only completed the first one

nice gun right next what not enough gems

enough

damn game is this

[Music]

important

[Music]

oh yeah

yeah I do agree this seems like the most

appropriate outfit for this theme

tracking then why does it have to tell

me how to play this game playing this

game

I might have forgotten

[Music]

apparently come on another every time

you die like yeah you should just play

the game

like maybe you forgot to set the rules I

plan to have

[Music]

it's not on me a transportation so many

pages

[Music]

okay now

oh my why is this slime is so hard

[Music]

and also the the movement into left and

right before we move down is based on

the original position and not I might be

honest

thank you

[Music]

all right so hard to just move slightly

second I haven't been

I mean I can't do this

[Music]

mine

bunny noises

[Music]

that was that cute

there's a monster noises if something

[Music]

what come on game this is just cheating

[Music]

it just faces through your scene how is

that okay

[Music]

yeah another fan of this game mode why

is it so tricky

why am I super bad at this game

[Music]

this is hard

[Music]

this danger in San Francisco

every time you jump on the shield

maybe he's he's angry oh that looks

annoying it's close

[Music]

don't say sorry

I thought I'd say sorry

[Music]

you have said sorry to you many times

[Music]

he apologized to my story

yeah I'm not sure why I'm messing up so

much

green parties because the balls are

facing through the

spaceships team

there you go

primarily

[Music]

thanks yeah sure I could have moved the

slide to do right but I can't lose like

because it goes so quickly just making

it happen which is nice if you need to

move quickly but but

it it makes precise movement very tricky

and it could require such precise

movement

[Music]

it's almost like the orange thingy part

on the front of this thingy is the

actual part that you have to

hit the ball on it

it's actually me but

um

[Music]

this is our previous game from start wow

[Music]

suicide

[Music]

give me something

[Music]

bro oh and goodness

[Music]

okay wait wait the game isn't broken

[Music]

I wanted to move

[Music]

there we go look at that I mean please

[Music]

starts to find us start over when I die

the loudness is not fight any progress

of the legend

and it's not like you will complete the

level in a certain amount of time

you can spend an evening time on each

level well the game is cheating

[Music]

or is that was always right

I didn't know I'm gonna come at the game

for cheating because that's what the

prince like

[Music]

she just wanted some quick 20 challenge

they decided

for some reason

crazy

I thought I like the level is hard

enough but the way I have to go and earn

some gems before okay this is maximum

before I can redo it that's just that's

the annoying part

[Music]

[Music]

stop sliding around so much nice

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

as they couldn't give me a single gem

s

go up here

[Music]

I guess to the balls

because otherwise I have to

I'm still not sure what exactly is that

makes this

[Music]

is the platform I can

it is my thing smaller or something

it seems to be smaller

I'm trying to pick up the balls

[Music]

and this time it's

inconsistent connection

[Music]

what

like if it goes through the platform

it should be picked up

[Music]

I don't know how many gems I spent on

that single level 11. it's way too

expensive

[Music]

tiny seal gems

thank you

next

counting increased payouts anyway

[Music]

[Music]

together

[Music]

I only believe the ones

the other languages

[Music]

you want foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

now it seems to go down depending on how

[Music]

um

well that's that makes

I mean

I think they have potential for

some nice animations here

domination is that

[Music]

they have

[Music]

[Music]

I don't know what I was gonna say the

only thing I have is that the basic

thing has to be the model and turn it

into a 2d model and it doesn't look good

they are wasting make it

look good but they have no money they

left me

one here we go here we go

[Music]

Flame's name is your only purpose in

life

that's that one is so annoying

[Music]

I basically need a headband stamp or

something

in the reality lasts for a long time

[Music]

and it doesn't upgrade or anything so so

like

I don't know how many games

[Music]

amazingly worthless level that just

wasted my time

[Music]

sex again like she's 300 kids I'm

teaching her I mean it's not too hard

after I forget

I guess it is a level I could form gems

at but most lamps doesn't cost me

anything to do anything man and it

didn't cost me anything and I could just

try it over and over again I could Farm

gems problem is I have to pay second

chance to win 60 gems so that's like

perfect games this time

[Music]

that's not really wasting

[Music]

I have

this

fell down well

or you can do that ice crashing game for

free again so yeah and it's quicker and

I don't have to risk losing

foreign

[Music]

never they have the plane system that

you get you get hundred percent

um

[Music]

you get

you get 100 from the regular way of

doing it

but if you risk 100

you will win 200 percent

[Music]

I guess that's the uh

[Music]

yeah

like I was expecting a training burn

unique Trading Card kinds

where am I going

[Music]

[Music]

the bouncing on this

okay right yeah this is this area and

then I can then I can for some some

destroy is back down here again

previous area because I didn't have

money because I spent a lot of time

let me go to the other area by spending

nice

[Music]

good morning

[Music]

oh this is here somewhere

[Music]

okay can I get down here I don't know

because I can't look down

can I go down here I don't know

put your very jump because it's like a

fair way of doing it but where am I I'm

not a game developer what do I know it's

can't see the electricity

this is a good level inside No One

tested this

and no one tells me to start like yeah

you can't actually see it electricity on

the ceiling or not except because I

obviously uh so we country so you can't

really determine if you can

do something about it

no one it's good enough no one cares

it's just a spider crash for Server game

you need quality

even though they made seasonal made

which actually was quite a good point

which was quite a good game for the Game

Boy

considering the hard way

and it made it quite well I was saying

I can appreciate I will maintained

[Music]

I'm avoid you

can say if that's what people like the

level has been unlocked but there is one

thing I am curious about all the

disguise the rape talks but if I do this

level again I mean if I don't have to do

this ever again how does how do they

make this level harder

more enemies more ammo

enemies from behind

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

he's an amazing pie it had the uh

terrible that is

I think you can guess what's inside the

[Music]

let's do this

[Music]

you did it you almost killed if this was

in the way

[Music]

yeah

okay anyways

[Music]

I mean

[Music]

what is the remaining levels

[Music]

and

foreign

I am supposed to

[Music]

be looking for levels but nine or

something

all right maybe it's in previous area I

didn't buy an exploded area

but that's two levels left so

[Music]

I need to turn my key

this

[Music]

is

ships thing does remind me of this thing

where a person cannot hear about

what we can know about a thing

and then try to all right

then try to apply it to other games

where it doesn't apply does that make

sense

[Music]

basically yeah

[Music]

and knock them out

[Music]

there we go

okay the jumpsuit repair okay I can do

this

[Music]

there we go

press the singing button

I mean it was the easiest level

what happens if I do a hard level

let's do this

[Music]

okay it was it there must be tricky

and their heart is level

[Music]

dang it

[Music]

teddy bears Rockets

oh

please

[Music]

Airlines

[Music]

okay save this bye

thank you

nothing to do that wait where is my

button

what car did you mean

okay

[Music]

[Music]

yes

[Music]

this one should bring me internet

[Music]

of hitting lava

is

[Music]

why

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

and that's the only purpose picking this

stuff up

here

[Music]

now I'm using this circle

[Music]

[Music]

that's the square

yeah I wonder what's happened

what can it be

[Music]

there isn't much of this lemon

to these words

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

Maybe

[Music]

this is bringing yourself

it's quiet why are you glitching around

so much

[Music]

all right this is where I came from and

I didn't go up here in must be where I

was supposed to go

[Music]

Ryan Talisman is randomly I get currency

Bridge the portal

[Music]

S

I have posted his colleagues but my

horse does not tend to use

[Music]

we only spread shoes

such as a strawberry is a night

[Music]

because a strawberry

the actual strawberry strawberry

Strawberry

is the yellow seeds because as you know

plants are all about

spreading so it's the seed that is kind

of like the actual fruits of the fruit

makes sense

and a fruit is

what contains the seeds but a strawberry

does not contain seeds therefore

strawberries

[Music]

and the seeds by definition

are are not

and they see that is

just some accessory

[Music]

um

it's not a fruit it's definitely not the

fairy

inside

[Music]

[Music]

strawberries

I think we're cracking culinary since

they are however there is one thing

he didn't eat there you go that's all of

them now I can visit the next one plane

[Music]

quite a second

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

he just sometimes a shot so for some

reason he stem twice or something

and sometimes

when you shoot them so sometimes it kind

of yes you should connect six times

[Music]

[Music]

you did it but I don't get one for this

middle stage and it's not in the highest

stage

surveys are nuts right Botanical

yes yes botanically it is

not and the exterior that the scissors

perfect

but

um give me

it should still be a fruit

because this thing that the seat sit on

is still the same that the plant is

interesting in kind of eating

[Music]

it still serves the same function the

position of the sea is finishing the

count

because it's fine side now parts of a

plan to fall into two cancers

fruits or vegetables

and if the and if the part of the fruit

of the strawberry is not

thank you

the red punch if that's not a fruit it's

a vegetable and maybe it is a vegetable

but it really should be approved because

it's the one that is

[Music]

yeah I mean it's it's quite fruity

in the botanically sense

[Music]

you can see inside now I mean that's

something

[Music]

it could be the seeds

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

sometimes you did it said yeah

and that's Hunter spell just a hunter

ball

foreign

[Music]

animation

Mario on the thing

which is a very new

[Music]

so that would be three characters who

asked me actually have dresses

space could lead to disorientation or

even brain damage

serenation fine brain damage

[Music]

not really much opportunity to crash

while act like

you're sure I'm leaving crash

[Music]

and crash didn't even care

it could cause rain damage decoration

okay

you need to depend on defeat all of the

mini games three times in order to open

this pattern what excuse me

excuse me

of you telling me I have to go

all the way back

to the very start

to just do the mini games all over again

[Music]

[Music]

but many names are different

foreign

[Music]

I guess I can give you that

[Music]

it's not like you're doing exactly

exactly the same things

[Music]

they don't show any sign of completion I

would say no otherwise the game is very

cruel

and you know what we say everybody

[Music]

probably made a sheep sound

[Music]

few gems each time you play but you have

the chance to gain many gems if you win

but can I like

a thousand up

blank

one one

bytes variable comes to 25.

[Music]

they need that

unless you can do supper bites but I'm

not sure if they do something maybe they

use like would be fights or something I

really can't do that but assuming the

game uses full bite to not stop fighting

that does mean

there you go oh is it is it when I

collect every single gem

okay

yes

that's when

it's Bianca I went

and see what

[Music]

let's see how tricky this one is that

many

girls eating each surgery to get her

a hand work done I mean there's a lot of

ahems to work on the internet

[Music]

care because it's really really nothing

interesting

because I'm not I'm not I mean I know

first foreign

[Music]

[Music]

velvet welcome

I ain't got a basket

welcome welcome we're not talking about

anything

[Music]

I am playing some spiral minigames okay

again with a lot of Spider-Man and all

you do is basically

this type of mini game you only need to

press one button and one button

repeatedly

exit one time one time I actually had to

press right

because the game was cheating

aside from that point

the game was buggy but I guess that one

doesn't count

[Music]

yes

[Music]

okay I guess now I like to joke no

[Music]

nope

[Music]

Oh Hey sister I altitude adjustments

[Music]

[Music]

I'm going in there

[Music]

yeah so this is supposed to take the

second shot hits them too early it

doesn't count

intentional design

[Music]

thank you

I don't know I like this flying upwards

or flying right towards

it and also they have spider flying and

then they have the spaces

[Music]

thank you

they seems to be just a 16 delays

transparency

[Music]

and let's say that in my hot frame

ready to get food in a little bit yeah

it's almost been three hours

and I had to continues

going through these levels

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

out of here

[Music]

so

[Music]

since I can at least get

a few hits

[Music]

then they taste there is three times

that's at least five times I can eat

them but it feels like if you don't want

that sometimes as if I can get in two

hits before they can then take damage

again

that's 70.

crystallized Dragon one I only have that

one

crash I wonder if I can train cars over

like yeah but

[Music]

um

you can take the trade train times

oh you can connect multiple keyboards

and train your cars around

[Music]

but who would like to do that yeah

[Music]

no Hispanic

in party mode

oh you can I assume you can present

these games into play mode

[Music]

to store the memory that's up to 255

gems so they must at least use two bytes

and that would be up to 32 South no

Big Steve 4 000 something something so

they could at least learn how you to get

a 99 anyway

in case the game Auto saves

that's besides

me as being there Evelyn

heavy link am I on my phone
