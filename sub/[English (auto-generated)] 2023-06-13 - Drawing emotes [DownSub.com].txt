don't feel precious to write in the chat

it's perfectly fine

so

I am open for this to what oh I got a

message

hello

um

Japanese is that what to go with

Caitlin's

I was thinking is there anyone I I don't

think anyone is called cat

nothing about regular at least that's

this kitten

but cat should work

can't it's fine okay

so I will continue to draw more emotes

and in

hopefully not too many strings

I should have accounted somewhere

foreign

[Music]

that might actually not me

[Music]

I can't find you again

reach

[Music]

online

I might say

so this is the forciest stream on

YouTube day and then I need to do 20

more streams and then on the 20th stream

after this one I will unlock the

following emotes

I went anything too bad but it's nice to

see you and I'll be hanging out there

honestly

I'm happy to hear that very much it's so

cute

I'm happy I'm happy that you want to

stay here

[Music]

some streaming when I'm going to bed

no

so that's

[Music]

the current estimated

or less yeah

yeah but

I'm gonna do an extra stream that is

planned for tomorrow

so I can increase this to 40 and then

I'll hand it is

though it is extra stream the final day

will be the 6th of July not too long

left

just to give you some ideas

[Music]

should I draw a dead one

like like a

cartoon dead

heart instead

we need

foreign

maybe to

really depends on the

sometimes I have trouble visualizing

something

and I just need to use

get a better understanding of different

ways of

making that thing by looking at how

other artists has made it

to get a general idea

and then I find

[Music]

different ways they do it and see if I

can adapt some of those Solutions

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

just cut

[Music]

potato one hour long I did now got a lot

of

[Music]

[Music]

let's see

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

making this report obviously I'm the

same person on the same channel

every time

it's not changing

[Music]

and again it changed the setting right

you can

[Music]

see

[Music]

those advantages I had not much tutors

everything is all right

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

okay

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

so after the face

distracted by the poem it wasn't the

power out well it was actually a very

short poem outage but I guess that's

10 benefits of doing this in a laptop

[Music]

which of course cut out the modern so it

had to reconnect the connection with

takes time

[Music]

of course wanted to

okay I also wanted to write in the chat

that device power outage which of course

can't do for my I think computer because

it doesn't have any internet anymore

so I want to do a different phone but

the mobile internet in this place is so

slow

that

the modern

managed to reconnect before I even get a

connection suited phone

and that takes several minutes

incredibly slow mobile network sometimes

but that's life out on the living in a

small town sometimes depending where you

live

yeah as it depends on which network

you're on too

some do you have a better

coverage than others

[Music]

[Music]

oh

my God

do you like feel like switching

providers

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

and then I want to close the eyes

done

[Music]

please put me in the movement but let me

cut it out

it only has its intended Square it looks

a bit better doesn't it

foreign

I am making more remotes but yeah

you might have expected

because leave you in your heart

party

how do you think what do you think maybe

the phrase is what do you think

not quite the actually

I actually got to read it early on which

was nice like eight people eight people

are sticking around watching and then I

got a random power outage now it's two

people so

that wasn't so great

it'll win

for me it's cute that's cute at least

some positivity

now what should I call this one is it

just hard to something

hurts

okay I need a message because I said you

can about the standard names people use

so people can find this stuff easier

[Music]

love

that's love because it's a cat version

of the love love

love

summon love you I guess it's love okay

and that the high chance called love it

one

well

yeah stretch streamers has spoken it is

called love

love love

oh no I

I miss a spot

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

that same as but shift all this it's

also save us wait what's that moist that

I kind of prefer what

shortcut settings

these

oh I got control of this shift and

control

okay I see

I see

[Music]

I'll keep Ctrl shift s because that

seems to be same as as t-shirt and then

I will put export as p and g as

control of it it's a quick shortcut like

that

there you go

no that's good that's good now press

Ctrl s to say it and then go to alt s

they just export it as a PNG

which should not affect the original

file I mean as the the whole so if I

press Ctrl s now it is same over the

original document and not the PNG

since PNG doesn't have layers and I want

to keep on that dimension

[Music]

okay

[Music]

anyway

llv-e it has been completed

[Music]

and also they were very quick ads

approving yesterday's video because it's

also got this

obviously

[Music]

and what's annoying about streaming and

legend of spiers because they flagged

the music used in it

I guess it is technically copyrighted

but usually it's like part of the

gameplay and usually

I mean I can't

and it's a shame that because I can't

count to claim it and options are

my video doesn't use it but that's wrong

I mean it's Etc using it

I'm the one making original performance

of it that is not

that it's not true

I have permission

to use the audio technically the

and finally the uh the usage of the

audio was on a fair use which it

technically doesn't

hey

someone would might be arguing that but

I would like it does not fall on the

face

um

but I really wish it was like a fifth

option like

and this audio is part of the game

because that's Canada what twitch is

playing video games and therefore

if I were just playing the music

separate from the game I'll relate to

the game I understand flagging in that

case but it's because it is part of the

game

I wish

[Music]

yeah and then

twitch doesn't complaining about

the

that I

I smears out

if I forgoted this

into you

I still have the message

you have a lot of

audio that has been

of this body is

don't

it has been resolved

I really wish because I get the same

same song every time and twitch proves

resolves it every time it would be nice

if they could do something about that I

don't know

anyway back to what I was thinking

before I got distracted by

him by that

uh

let's just uploaded so it gets a route

to Twitch I don't think I have any slot

put it on

[Music]

love

uh wait it's already used by the love

text

[Music]

all right

yesterday

[Music]

or love too

no wait what did I call the other one

yeah nothing

it's love too

[Music]

now I can add

I want which I cannot just call now

without condition

[Music]

and I just type PP

TVP no

[Music]

why are there so many

there are so many channels that are in

some way called pawn and Bun this pom

pom bon bon bon pon pon pon pon Bon and

foreign

[Music]

but I am the only the only ponpon Z

Bonbon the original

foreign

[Music]

I just have to set it as the 1000 bits

as in 10

US dollars

think

now that's what

provided to me is that is 20 US dollars

to have do you have to pay 20 US dollars

in total over your lifetime

towards my channel

and after that you will get it

access to that one

with so far

and we as which is public

taser and kitten has paid

that much 1000 bits

which means that you are obviously they

have access to new love

now

maybe I should have added something too

hard it's kind of flat you know the

heart I mean my my style is kind of flat

but I don't know

maybe it should be flat maybe that's not

a bad idea

but I was thinking it's kind of big and

kind of

being a prominent

and a lot of the

Arts other hair do you have some kind of

shading

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

if you eat me that's how it I ever see

my special someone

what if you're eaten by a special

someone

foreign

[Music]

eat me then I guess it's a love child to

see you again

and the only girl this year again

[Music]

he heard for the rest of your life

thank you

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

must be someone being special

does this special someone you know

yes

have you asked surgery

[Music]

what is

what do you say in English I was going

to say I was going to say have you asked

her out but that's like asking someone

for a date that's not that's not what

I'm after what is it called in English

foreign

[Music]

all right

[ __ ]

I should share it on stream

because it's been a b

can I make it

no

that's the website

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

saved on desktop

now I find it easily and easily be able

to delete this one

add image amp

[Music]

let's image

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

okay

the um Transylvania so basically what is

the translation of well the switch place

which is programs in English

so well first okay so that's the thing

is phrase

in English it is

ask somebody if they would like to be

your boyfriend or girlfriend it's gender

neutral

too long prediction through this picture

well this trend is so interesting how

[Music]

it is this is a great example of where

something that is very very short in one

language is very long in another

language

and apparently English doesn't really

have

a saying

for basically

asking if someone wants to be here

boyfriend or girlfriend apparently

[Music]

and that's interesting

that's the language lesson of the day

two verses sentence exactly

[Music]

how that's just

[Music]

that's how

I mean that's how my languages work

[Music]

when I didn't ask Canada then she didn't

say yes

nice

that seems like he's gonna wait for your

kitten

[Music]

I'm excited

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

I could imagine

I did ask a

ask someone to be my girlfriend uh

I've done many many years ago

and

[Music]

80s

[Music]

it is it is very

it's hard to do

[Music]

it's indeed

since it's just so beautiful other

Swedish times anything is having no but

you guys given something it's very hard

to do

yeah

um but it seemed like he managed to

drink chicken so that's that's great

[Music]

good job

thank you

love nowadays is so difficult

unless

these guys

I don't know

is it hard and easy nowadays

I mean

considering how much like internet

and so many services you can use to like

get in contact with people I would like

it it's easy nowadays

[Music]

that proud and happy for you I wish you

all the luck in happiness she's so sweet

but her voice is so beautiful

[Music]

sorry that's it

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I would argue sorry I would argue with

so much hate in the stack in the world

today it's more difficult to find

someone that has the right mindset as

yourself

all right

I was actually

going to say that because of the morgue

much more people you are able to get in

contact with

the more people you will find that are

of course hateful and who

you don't get along with and

and so on

while with a smaller number of people

and basically without the internet

and you you will find less of these

people but you will also find less of

people who you actually will get along

with

[Music]

and people focus it's just part of a

nature I guess that people focus too

much on the negative standard positives

so

if you double the amount of

[Music]

even though you have if if you have the

same amount of negative and positive

things

and if you double both of them so you

still have the same amounts

for them instead it's going to feel like

there's more negative than positives

because

negatives way more

other argument even if you have the same

amount of negative and positives the

negatives are it's already going to feel

more than positive

I just love to make her happy that

sounds great you should make you happy

and I hope she makes you happy

and that's all you need kitten

[Music]

yeah

if you find someone

[Music]

that you get along with that sounds

amazing

[Music]

but we do have a lot income

but we do have a lot in common with her

too wait what do you mean

we

would say but I do have a thing called

yes yeah but

[Music]

it's a double date

yeah I assume it was a typo

one of those awkward titles

just the correct word being the typo

making it really strange

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

okay

bad phone I'm not going to share my

girlfriend with anyone else

not even if they're going to ask you

nicely

[Music]

I like it yeah and that's something

wasn't

right

I was suspected that something wasn't

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

see she is so smart sometimes I feel

sincere

don't be sent

very smart Steel

[Music]

be proud of yourself

[Music]

but I'm learning something really

special

[Music]

and when I'm learning something really

special for it

some form of

[Music]

skill knowledge

[Music]

actually makes sense yeah you can learn

something you can practice something

[Music]

I hope she appreciates it

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

know

[Music]

hello my progress every day of learning

that that's that's good that's nice it

sounds like

sounds like you two have quite good

this relationship become getting along

well

made to each other

[Music]

it said ponton

yeah someone wanted a second one they're

making it fun

but but I don't know maybe this becomes

a two set one spot

[Music]

foreign

why

[Music]

going away

[Music]

what is this skin or whatever

you're learning

[Music]

unless it's you don't want to share

that's fine too

well I guess now I'm just going to talk

about the stream instead of talking

about my girlfriend even though she's

really amazing internet

oh you're making me jealous I wish I was

amazing

[Music]

activity Fair a lot of people say that

I'm amazing talented second

yeah

they can't handle compliment

the skill I'm learning

[Music]

um

it's a language

yeah you do you know a few languages

that's gonna

you're kind of skillful at that

[Music]

you are amazing see this this one thing

[Music]

[Music]

but 45 decided is this okay

that's what I wanted that wasn't so

Talent not me

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

so

that is

that now

foreign

[Music]

does have a nice language and it's fun

to learn

so what language is it

what's your language yeah

[Music]

what what would be a fun language to

learn

[Music]

Uzbek and these three different

there's three different scripts of it

[Music]

I'll get it and that's not to be rude

anyway if someone would say

nice language I don't think Uzbek is one

of

those like I actually don't know what it

sounds like

it actually sounds nice

but I still don't think it's like this

first one of the early languages people

think of when it comes to night like

she's in

yeah like nice sounding languages

um

but I said I don't know what it sounds

like

did you find the idea of three different

scripts to be so it's the Latin it's

really and Arabic

Scripts

[Music]

but I'm more serious one

I mean I could imagine like a Polynesian

I wish that that could one of those

could be fun

[Music]

sweetie

and that is a fun language

I might know a few things about Swedish

well if you need help with learning

Swedish

I can always assist

ing good use of this

foreign

[Music]

she's so beautiful

oh

it's nice to find somebody to find

aren't beautiful

and in a bit

someone

you adore

and hope she

likes you but I guess much as you do

honey he's beautiful too but I should

keep her yeah maybe we shouldn't like

they start stuff I'm saying

various reasons

[Music]

I guess next next thing is to do like

which Swedish names are beautiful

[Music]

but like what Swedish names would I find

beautiful

like my name isn't even though I'm

Swedish my name isn't really Swedish

[Music]

yeah let's switch track

foreign

[Music]

thank you

I love it

I picked it myself

because I love it

um

it was not the name I was born with

both my parents have changed their names

so

okay so why not me too why why not

select a name I like more

because I didn't because obviously I

didn't get to choose my name so

[Music]

and I didn't feel like the name

[Music]

I'm honest I always find found my name

not quite fitting me

so

[Music]

and obviously

no

I was gonna say that and obviously my

parents approved

that it would because

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

I'm making these types more

body

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

all right

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

yes Swedish isn't

[Music]

too different from English and your

Spanish knowledge

is unique language does helped him

like there are aspects of both Spanish

and English that helps

with Swedish

another cell which I do finding that

funny oh

language learnings service there is a

Spanish to in Swedish course

the English to Swedish probably more

high quality of course that's to be

expected but I think it is like five

this English is made of course Spanish

to Swedish Arabic to Swedish

because there's a there's a common

thing that

is a large number of arabic speaking

immigrants come to Sweden and Duolingo

is often a tool used

to get to learn Swedish that's why they

have focus of adding it

so but I think there was two more

I there's no German this means

if I'm wrong maybe there isn't two more

finish to Swedish

could just visit Duolingo and check

[Music]

that course let's see

I speak all languages because I'm that

cool

no

this is a terrible system

this is hard and this is terrible

[Music]

because you come to speak which language

you speak which is language you want to

go from and then they released online so

you can learn they have show scenes so

if it shows all languages they list

so they took put uh put on these

different languages together in a single

list

they have written all language names in

English

and the only and the and then

and the only thing can determine of

which language it is

how they have written how many Learners

their heart

which you cannot determine if they're

using a common symbol like Hey we're

assassins

remains in

English for some reason

so the English is Swedish Spanish to

Swedish

Arabic to Swedish

one let's see

okay

that was wrong

I hope I get to speak to her in Swedish

one day

I hope I hope so too

I wish you the best of luck in here

language learning

so where when

speaking about learning Swedish is there

is there anything about Swedish that

aren't tricky or

just

have trouble

travel understanding

that I might be able to explain

[Music]

as I'm always at first speaking about

languages

[Music]

foreign

but when I go to speak to her and she

speaks to me I think I'll pick it up

real quick because I didn't know a lot

of words now

let's see seems like you are very

confident

so I hope for the best

[Music]

there you go here's a test sentence for

you

[Music]

let's let's pick some strange not

strange but like rise sentence that you

might not have heard before

yeah

that is

[Music]

thank you

I hope she doesn't think I'm silly

what that's what's going on now

[Music]

[Music]

are you blushing because my Swedish

speaking is cute or are you blushing

because you're ashamed of my switch

speaking [ __ ]

I mean it could be both ways

[Music]

[Music]

yes it is accident speaking is cute I

was thinking because I've been very

worried about my accent when I honestly

haven't mentioned that

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

so yeah basically

[Music]

Premiership

well

she got to talk to her in private nice

so basically I was going to say I was a

when I started streaming even before I

as I started making videos on YouTube

covering the spiral mods I made

and then I decided to

[Music]

let's play which I published on YouTube

which is

which is terrible but it is still up and

then I decided to not eat too much

effort even at home let's play I'll just

at least live stream instead

but yeah before before I even did my

first video one of the beers I had

was that my accent

with just sound to wear ridiculous

or like uncanny valley

finally she's so cute

which is

of what I was afraid of

I have overcome those fears and got into

my new sharp point but

and now people are telling me that I

sound cute and

that's that's really that's really

helping my

my encouragement

my confidence

yeah thank you kitten

[Music]

well I said

until they did this Swedish

price redeem and I'll speak more Swedish

if you want to hear more Swedish

[Music]

feed me sentences to speak

foreign

[Music]

that's why you want

and you want to date this woman you

found because you find the switch accent

cute

this is my general assumption

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

don't be afraid of expressing your

feelings

[Music]

I would ask for I love you

well I mean sure but you could phrase it

in different ways that it could be like

you are beautiful

and there would you like to marry me

and um

and

here have a beautiful dress

and

can I see your underwears

I mean there's a reason for that one but

foreign

best

I was going to ask like

what she does and everything but maybe

that's a bit too private

but

I did some ideas

he just

write any sentence if and

Don't Be Afraid about like for example

that I wouldn't

prove of the sentence something if there

is a sentence I don't want to translate

for some reason I would just redeem it

not entertain it to refund it

no don't

don't worry about that there's no

punishment

or that

I mean

if you try to redeem the same thing over

and over even though I reject it

would be a different thing but you

wouldn't do that with you

super amazing

[Music]

I mean if you were to do that I could

just disable this routine so

there you go

you are so beautiful that would be

do uh

it has a lot of talent oh

fun

I actually don't remember it you know

everything you said about time so far

[Music]

she has a beautiful

name

a good breakfast

[Music]

Taster's going to

uh

that's the word

[Music]

going to

give me give me a moment

[Music]

paint what's the word I was looking for

has she got this feeling going in the

English word

um yeah it is it's like the faint from

all this cuteness

thank you

[Music]

right now she's probably thinks I'm

single oh

she here

I see a mystery

what is he like

Chinese

[Music]

is strictly watching everything he did

something like that oh

my

I hope

my sockets

wait it's hard to see if she's spying on

you is that what you're saying

no okay

laughs

I hope I don't

take energy too far

yeah yeah with me either too but that's

fine that's

foreign

we need a bit of different people here

don't we right

and it's perfectly fine being in between

it

would you prefer you're probably not

like

maybe here you're definitely not there's

a lot of weird people and you don't even

get close to come close today

I was trying to not make it obvious oh

I should have handled the amount of kids

hey sorry you are really cute

so

[Music]

if you want to know something really

she's really cute

Luigi

and I just realized I said that in the

wrong uh that message was supposed to be

afraid of him

[Music]

oh

what's going on here

[Music]

and I was going to say

[Music]

if you want something cute taster

how about

plushie

I have here on the phone one phone you

can snuggle with at night or day

or every every day

[Music]

one night always

cute I would die for a person

we just need to find a company that can

make like

produce a high amount so they push down

the price

[Music]

because I would love a possible fish

myself

like the one that you can change the

closer

on off or not well

I guess you would be able to take off

the clothes too

[Music]

so that would be the main feature of the

plush

you would be able to change your clips

and she would come with the dress

I think I I don't know the best

sportswear I guess and don't worry

yeah yeah I imagine like you want more

with 20 that's that is a bit too much

Mickey wants like two or three

he said it once a few

you know just just serious in backup

is not enough you can have two

[Music]

and when you're happy

basically worn out because I mean yeah

plushies gets worn out

do you just take out the next one

oh my

yeah let's just get dirty and

I was thinking this with black Fair

an extra 30 plus because I find that

cute then nice and soft

but the Fire gets

[Music]

unfairy

[Music]

I think it gets weird over time

[Music]

as it gets dirt and stuff

then you just bring out the new fresh

one

[Music]

now I take care of my bun bun now again

take good care of her give her pets

make sure she

is

cosine but

then we leave her alone

I always say that she's cute so she gets

all blushy

avocado

and that's what flashes are for right

[Music]

so at least that's what I have my

plushies for

is nice and cuddly

thank you

foreign

thanks

we've been here before and because I

kind of recognize your name

we haven't had a few cats here so I see

it is possible like confused with

someone else

I'm sorry but if I do because my

I have I'm bad at remembering people

no

that's just who I am

so if I don't remember someone that's

just me being bad at remembering

it needs a few times there

start remembering people

even people I really like

like technology

one of the year

streamers I

love watching

we're supposed to be streaming

I think she's starting to stream in like

50 minutes

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

because

you're so kind

[Music]

that's not something

yeah my

uh

[Music]

yeah exactly and on this is going to

stream it like 11 minutes

if someone is curious

[Music]

oh yeah she was like and the other

streamers think he was doing yesterday

while I was streaming and then she's

going to stream it tomorrow while I am

you know what

[Music]

us

I need to remember myself maybe people

cannot teaching memory

so

[Music]

tomorrow I will do my extra stream and

it's tomorrow I try to like tomorrow and

Lolly will be streaming fresh and

that's the Stream

I do want to watch alone I I prefer

watching I'll

any streamlining that's of course but

that's the one I usually but because I'm

going to miss most of that stream

I would probably

skip all of the stream and then watch

the vote afterwards however when I end

my stream

[Music]

on that day

I want to watch this other stream

instead of who I haven't seen in a few

weeks now

[Music]

who he whose name is Elsa by the way I

think she has shown up once on my stream

maybe twice

they might have learned a few times that

that I have no idea about because I

don't get that information I can only

see if you chat or make everything

foreign

[Music]

when

did I say I was going to start this game

tomorrow

thank you

now

because otherwise I could faint but I

can't today because I'm going to end the

stream too early

um

but in that case I'm just in the Stream

wait

wait a minute no no no this is perfect

this is perfect I think

sorry for not trying at the moment but

no

of course it's only streaming one hour

earlier

that means that if I I have scheduled my

crash gameplay to be three hours

tomorrow but two hours after I started

streaming little Louis started streaming

so I should try to finish the game

within two hours

and then

I will just

make my stream two hours

and then when lonely starts streaming

basically during the

and I I will make the rate

and anyone who wants to join

and on that because that sounds fun

right

and then we basically rate slowly when

she starts streaming in that case I

actually don't want to miss that swing

problem is of course I will miss Elsa's

stream

uh

the perfect solution

all right let's

kitten is hiding in Panama

another stream where love is mentioned

[Music]

she will be the famous bunny around here

[Music]

I like your personality

thank you

she's very friendly

[Music]

she had she has helped me with

so shall I sing

[Music]

because I've been a bit too let's say

awkward

[Music]

and uh

[Music]

commitment

because this is about to be

back soon

okay

in this case I should be using this

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

for today

our streams this is fun drawings

and it's fun chatting with people there

was a lot of activity yesterday

which kind of makes today feel

empty

but I still appreciated the funny talk I

had

kitten and taser they are nice people

please

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

you're welcome kitten

[Music]

you make me happy

[Music]

you also make me happy

[Music]

and some white shelter

there's something like that

okay

this is

I mean you don't have to use it but

I just added

Yes Man

[Music]

you really should be a really large

comment to be fair

because you know

if you like and then you unlock and then

you read that right

[Music]

kitten

came out for the bunny Brown

thank you

cute yeah that's

that's what that's what it's meant for

TV kit

foreign

is

streaming

[Music]

Splatoon three

good thing

I got someone special to teach me oh

oh

okay

a special princess

shown that should probably be like

slouching

now

[Music]

daddy face

and it's been I was gonna say and it's

been another hour

but no no it hasn't because I had this

this dream restarted it's actually been

two hours

[Music]

am I that obvious

I mean

I mean if you say it like that

[Music]

[Music]

like that

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

rotate about the side a bit

[Music]

oh someone was so nice

nice outfit

[Music]

is getting her outfitting for the hair

Princessa

[Music]

you'd rather be

princess Sun at the end

but yes

otherwise that's good

I assume you use an online translator

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

was it wrong yeah like when you

referring to someone

like by a noun like in his case princess

in Swedish you use the definite form

without the princess

and I guess the translator you used

didn't catch that context so you kind of

have to force it Tuesday

definite form

I see me

another cute spider

[Music]

and Swedish kind of funny like that

here's another random fact

as short

okay but okay

still

um

which I don't know why exactly I do have

an idea but

titles of films and such that contains

the word is the

in English

sometimes that word is removed

when the title is brought to Sweden

so it's still the same title it's just

without the Z at the front

and there are several films that the

this is the case for there are several

where Z is just left there

but one show that I do know that case

four is to show that in English

is z

fairly odd

parents

that's this English title while the

[Music]

while the title in Sweden is

Fairly Odd Parents

you should just touch

it

now there is the other way around

wait no no no this it's up okay let me

correct the English title is the Fairly

Odd Parents

is Fairly Odd Parents

there we go that's that that's the right

place now I got the correct I just

switched which one had the space or not

[Music]

exclamation mark

[Music]

so this Swedish title is the English

Titan is just

slight differences

however

when an English title that does not

contain the word Z

is translated to Swedish and it's

translated based on the English title

sometimes they are creative

but when it is

translate the base of the English title

there's usually translated as if the is

included

and find that

to be kind of funny

but that's because I mean in Swedish we

kind of use the definite form more

and leave it off

probably because it's more of an

inflection of the noun rather than a

separate word like in odd languages

[Music]

things

so using the definite form kind of flows

better I guess

[Music]

I guess all the languages prefers

without it as an article

because it might flow with

a little better although in Arabic I've

seen that I definitely being used quite

a lot so I guess they prefer it but in

Arabic the article is kinda

it's not really an inflection of the

word

but it's kinda because it's fitted

together with the word

so it's kind of like in Swedish where

it's

almost an infection

I like that yeah

thank you

be so smart and that's why I'm learning

Swedish

because I'm smart now what

I thought it was for

probably three since

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

okay so for the

ears

I do want a good coloring

of the tears let me get some

color mixing going

now we start with

okay let's let's start with

extreme cars

this

that should probably use these two

that's a big magic okay like that

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

you know what

well I got to go it's first of all

watching his team I got to dress over

today but I had a lot of fun hopefully

as always in two movies about you know

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I like to make you happy

it's so hard to find a good idea of how

to

they make like what colors tears should

be

and like I shouldn't do a black outline

it should be nice

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

and

him

just doing some

[Music]

reference setting at the moment

okay

so in case you didn't know all that

stuff that thing before everybody's

during my streams I kind of want to

focus on the streams but you do know

that

[Music]

I don't know how I was was that you're

obvious

[Music]

foreign

I've been looking for quite a while now

just to get a good idea of how

like when you drop tears and do like

not black outlines too

is this

number five thing what they're looking

for is

hey it's hard it's it oh it is

I think so

I think so

[Music]

well by evening I will talk to you yes

we will talk

clicking about all kinds of stuff

it would be fun

[Music]

[Music]

yeah this is a nice scent but I don't

know what exactly

do you want a beach Blu-ray

thank you

foreign

[Music]

okay so that's

basically

mixing

oh there's something I find something I

like

[Music]

[Music]

this doesn't even outline the color is

good but

with no outside

that can probably

yeah this is a good car

[Music]

and I think this is a good outline

it's like

yeah maybe this works let's see

no mix mixed up

mixed up some colors

[Music]

maybe this works

[Music]

is that

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

that did Show an example of how to do

[Music]

I think this one is using yeah this one

is using black

I think blackout eyes is common yes

does this thing this wouldn't

[Music]

look good

let's be around

[Music]

is this

no no I guess I'll just have to sell

them into my cards

yeah probably I have to

so

this will be the main color

I'm gonna take the outside corner

that I

am making something like that

[Music]

tastes like

this

[Music]

maybe that works yeah I'll use these

I spent too long on trying to find a

yes for good colors now so I'll just

send me this

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

okay

like that

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

in a set

amount

let me try another set mode

see if I can edit twos

they're having it

Center China doesn't work

yes I really didn't wait

in this point

meaning time

whoops

there you go

thank you

and pun puns

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

he's the kind that couldn't even think

about my kind it wasn't adequate to

describe your kindness

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

happy

birthday

the real life one one

so now now what union can use this sad

pon pon because he wanted to use a sad

Pond pun because it wasn't the said fun

emote

he wants to express his sadness but now

he can

[Music]

I mean I get the joke but

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

sad

it feels like

something is missing

[Music]

[Music]

here if you had

[Music]

oh

he had a comfortable place you can do

everything you want to make you happy

okay I don't think

I don't think there's anything I could

and to this I think I think it's fine as

it is

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

so anyway let's save this one

and make it preparing it to wear

[Music]

publish as someone is making a lot of

noise outside

what is this by Carlton

cry

[Music]

and then when you have it got hands but

he's sleeping up his hands he's gonna

have a home system

it's not just

this one's got sad

[Music]

[Music]

this one is called said I guess I don't

I guess it's called said

[Music]

s-a-d

[Music]

it's very sad

right okay there I got this

I wanted to crashing much

yeah maybe yeah maybe it's sad since we

describe maybe cry it's better

people are kind of using both

foreign

decree

because cry is better than sad he's more

descriptive

how we joined the crime scene

and new emails to cry

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

it has been added

[Music]

and now I just need to

um

sign it too

a position

there we go

is it sharing still am waiting everyone

yep

when did I say it was

[Music]

20 hours ago

[Music]

sounds been 24 hours

is a bit more yeah it's kinda

I'm running out of slots these that's

the problem

[Music]

I mean I guess I could add it no I don't

know

it's a curry one

you wouldn't used to cry one right

[Music]

now Olivia can cry because he can't even

use it

well I mean doesn't cost that much you

only have to pay

[Music]

foreign

US dollars

and then you get access to it

yeah I do feel like the Beats rewards

happy to use large steps

the first one costs 20 next one because

I'm [ __ ]

I I mean uh

that would be more okay with it

at least it's there to

[Music]

Maxine second yeah I do wish

[Music]

I do wish give us more steps

[Music]

because having more steps encourages

people to spend more bits

because currently you need do you need

to reach a thousand that's a huge step

if the version almost 100 that's like

two two

USD that's not much you can pay that

for an emote that you will have forever

according to switch

and then

and then it says 18 to

to reach the next step but you can have

like 500 bits

that is 10. USD

so you only have to pay eight more

instead of instability to get another

one

and then it's only 10 USD today

1000

[Music]

.

[Music]

[Music]

but only 20 more days then I will unlock

the following modes and then I can

make the the ones currently set at the

bits those will be available

and for your teeth

I mean it's watching the kid and again

look at that kid me

[Music]

then those who are not currently

subscribed to give access to five of

these

[Music]

and those

who are subscribed

will get access to five more without

having to pay bits

those who are in paying bits will

basically

get existed more I guess everything will

shift down five steps basically so

it's pretty good

and I said 17 more subscribers

I think

I don't have any

nice in it

[Music]

[Music]

seven more

subscriptions gifted or not

and then another slot will open up and

that means that you will get access to

the crane

but maybe you want the waving one

instead

[Music]

and I will put the waving one

at higher priority than the coloring

what I feel like

Wayne

[Music]

now

foreign

[Music]

people want to use the most are more

accessible

but those

[Music]

so

that the ones people do want or like

requiring subscription are a bit uh

beat the Nations I definitely want to be

that greedy

[Music]

this is

[Music]

make me wonder how she didn't fits

[Music]

[Music]

laughs

[Music]

foreign

I just need to

there's the shape of this

my dress is getting on top of the

drawing happily

I'm chatting a bit in the way

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

all right

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

moment

knowing you

yeah

[Music]

moving your around this

is a nice

I'm just enjoying the meal

really you know if you really want to

enjoyed chicken

there are some redeems that I can help

you foreign

[Music]

don't forget about those

yeah exactly

getting every year in that nice tummy oh

well hello

it's such a very tummy she got

oh my

it's a cute one

[Music]

it's a tempting

wait what's tempting

foreign

[Music]

thank you

it's still warm

[Music]

seven

[Music]

lessons

when yeah I completely forgot the

Boneless switch

boom there's nothing wrong for this

yeah something was beating off

and it's the bomb

the bubble

the bow is off because there's no bow

push this off

her head

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

and just do this it's probably fine

[Music]

okay

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

but so little of these shoulders is

visible

um

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

because I can't

use them on the Discord survey but I

can't use them on Twitter anyway because

I don't have enough slots available

I have to wait for more slots before I

can

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

yeah that's why

pink

right there it's a bit cooler

officially Square tummy

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

term to use

and yeah silhouette is smooth

it's more like

with outline

[Music]

curious

I mean

people usually don't try to tickle me so

I don't know

you want that tickling redeem

[Music]

and now it's just curious just there's

nothing else

well um

yeah I'm definitely for doing things

like

the themes that would interact with pon

pon on screen

[Music]

and this paper I should play along with

it but the

turn along with

tickling can be a bit tricky if since

it's just another terminal you don't

love me

that that's what may be hard

to

I guess belarium edit their hair even

though how I would

say hello

[Music]

all right

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

sometimes the time is very ticklish oh

my speech

so yeah I mean

yeah everything got tickled redeemed

with like a feather or something

yes

but I don't know not having like

me reacting because I I wouldn't be able

to like

myself

I don't know maybe it's not this

probably do you need to

adjust the animation

I mean tickling the tummy that would be

see someone wanting to do that

thank you

and I am open for ideas if there's like

once again you have to make it work

make the tickling work in a good way

otherwise I'll just

be not included it's not

nothing more than that so

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

okay

[Music]

there you go that's my

[Music]

and the people

are just trying coloring I'm fun fun

it's technically a black outside but

I'm not going to be able to fit that

thing

guys can be seen here is the very same

black outside

long village

so

thank you thirsty

I think so

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

and fill everything

what

ah

what's happened there

all right for nothing click that one

[Music]

other arguably

to be separate

foreign

[Music]

four

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

you okay

I'm gently trying some emails

so how how are you

[Music]

let's sing this

everything should inspired now that I am

Snipes people are around here like you

know me

hey

that sounds nice

um

I'm gonna like have a kids stream that

that sounds great

thank you

I have some nice that I can change I

guess

[Music]

I mean I want to I have to keep

forgetting that I needed this job soon

just remember

[Music]

yeah but the ball cuts off at the top

maybe I should

just to do it like that

[Music]

[Music]

and then I need to

[Music]

make sure it's not stealing outside

foreign

I think

this is good

[Music]

welcome

it's a

it works

[Music]

I looks a bit weird in some ways but

I'm happy with it

[Music]

let me just prepaid for it

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

all right

questions

[Music]

oh yeah I keep forgetting that instead

there how much left

I only said my

hello hello

I'm happy to see you

of course

I will add the new email to the server

and

no that's that's that's roads that's not

that's not the one I'm looking for

and this is the one I will give one

yep

and then I would post it here

[Music]

and then

I went with arms high or arm high and

what did I do

[Music]

something like that

[Music]

yep that's another one

the hand is kind of big but I guess it

is too

emphasize making it more obvious

the Emerald's waiting everyone and no

they are

waiting

[Music]

uh refresh yeah I guess I just added it

[Music]

he made

the only emote oh well this this outfit

is way out my reviews

[Music]

okay I'll be back in a second

[Music]

um yeah problem is of course

[Music]

yeah these are the new ones today

but probably is that

these are

um

[Music]

and yeah and

they should still show up on the that's

where however

you can't use them

because you have to pay a certain number

of bits I put them in the wrong order

they connected from

like Michelle

yeah thank you very good messages that

we could put them in quick morning

from lowest to highest

yeah yeah

that's lowest right Heist so that is

what is it one thousand five thousand

and ten thousand bits because I have run

out of I filled up all the subscribers

last already well technically I do have

two more that's that's tier two and tier

three but no one's paying for this

is really random twitch ones I guess I

could

feel those with

[Music]

cats versions

because the cats and more popular than

it takes measures

[Music]

yeah you have basically I have to pay a

lot a lot per months to get those and

that's basically everything yet paying

for tier two and tier systems worthless

now

someone is crazy enough to do it at

least they get something but

I didn't recommend doing it

it's about 97 to unlock all of them

yeah basically but

let's see 10 000 that's

10.

I'm about to use the usually account

a hundred

there was like one

or is it one bit is one cent that is

sent to the Creator our streamer and you

usually pay about two cents to get a bit

not the best donation system there's a

lot that goes to twitch but when you buy

a large amount of bits you can actually

get for a smaller amount of money

so

[Music]

a

so

[Music]

remember if I hydrated I had it

so if I get so everyone who wants the

lowest which is the heart I should get

10 USD per person who gets the heart

that means that you have to pay at least

that amount plus how much twitch wants

I have no control over how much I get

I think so some of the services where I

can choose how much I want

to make it much cheaper more expensive

but considering bits is a Global

Currency that's not an option

I really wish I could set the prices for

you but I I really want like 100 bits

version

100 bit 250 500 750 and a thousand so

that way you can slowly work yourself up

so every every email to pay for is a

small amount or you can pay for a large

amount immediately get lots of them

I think that would be right here

hello hey

madman

you're a dog a lad and a man

and what's up dog

oh it's USA needs to pay that amount

it's not just a shout away no sadly not

but twitch says I still not haven't seen

any proof of it but twitch claims that

the amount of bit bits you have seen

spent

is is

[Music]

you know I don't know English it is

saved they they remember how much you

have spent in total

over

of over a lifetime

there we go that's

cumulative I still can't say it

community

I'm good what's this promising to me

she's looking for some art streams yeah

I am making emotes I'm actually

tired at the moment and

actually finished making her

image I'm just chatting at the moment

about

and if you want to

join the chatting

and then I was going to read

it

or velvet

violet

[Music]

who has been studying for the shortest I

mean

I do want to read Lottery tomorrow so I

should probably read velvet today I

think that's why

I think that's fine she has only been

going on for an hour so I think that's

fine

[Music]

no money was that I'm paid and fight but

I'm plus that I've run out I basically

saw these six

let's let's see okay uh I have six

subscribers Lots at the moment

seven more subscription at the moment

and I will unlock another one

[Music]

and then so that's the first six you see

on this screen which I did can't point

so here's my character now I can point

the four first and it's GoPro and the

two first and second row those are the

subscriber ones then initially there is

the animated one

which still hasn't been let me check

refresh

okay nope it's still not appeared okay

and then the last one on the second row

and the two

and the third row so everything in the

circle because that's when I see

reference look at

all right

currently the Beats emote because I

don't have any other slots

but it's at least something for those

who have have currently have been nice

enough to donate bits which currently is

public information so that's a Mickey

taser and kitten

they get their heart

yeah and in 20 days

20 more streams after this one

so that will be calculated the fifth of

July

that is when the follower emotes opens

up and I will get five slots

so

[Music]

I guess we will uh

so I can make two more

emotes

and that would fill up all the followers

and subscriber slots and not any beats

slots

unless more people subscribe in that

case there's an even one addition stop

and then we basically decide to

which

emotes people wants as followers

following months so I guess that would

be uh something for followers to decide

and not subscribers because subscribers

have access to all of the typical

subscription will run out yeah that's

fine that's fine

[Music]

and that but the problem is if I set

those that are set as follower emotes

you cannot pay

because you can you can just follow and

then you get access to them therefore

you cannot pay these Channel points I

should call them card coins you cannot

pay carrot coins to unlock them I mean

it wouldn't make sense but that prevents

you from using those emotes on other

channels simply through care coins if

you're not a subscriber

[Music]

so I hope I covered everything

if you have any question

[Music]

but for now

let's visit the Velvet violet

sadly the

[Music]

challenge is not available

[Music]

and

[Music]

they got they got this shrimp it's

stampede

[Music]

but yeah basically it's like that just

send it as the headshot appears because

it's a friendly gesture and it's funny

you don't have to stay but you get 250

carat coins okay if you at least follow

along I do wish

which could encourage sending a message

as well just a single message message to

for to get additional care coins

better well it's fine

[Music]

and yeah I guess

it's only two watches that everyone left

I went whoever is here

hope you have a nice time I'll be

watching

yeah oh yes great

velvet

time is running out goodbye

[Music]
