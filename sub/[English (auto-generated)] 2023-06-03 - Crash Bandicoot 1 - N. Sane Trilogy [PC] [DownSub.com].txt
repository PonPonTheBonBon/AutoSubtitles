hello is
Activision presents
a smashing Blast from the Past nice to
see you here
hopefully this game let's fight
vicarious Visions I hope the audience
working
anyways
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
get
all crystals and gems I don't think I'll
be going for the time trials
or should I go like for this lowest
because you're having the three levels a
critical field now it's time at least
maybe if that's interesting
but that time trial would be the last
thing I do
I was given to terms yeah yeah I'm
thinking that
thank you
so let's begin
yeah I did start a save at that to test
again and it worked fine
it initially didn't work fine because it
had it was using wrong graphics cards
the past 10 years [ __ ]
cortex Commandos to World Domination
this time I shall reign triumphant
a bit close
The
Vortex is not ready we have no idea what
it could do
failure again
Escape
capture him
1.0
I can't
too many keyboards
he fell down landing on the beach I
guess on a completely separate Island
let's
okay okay
all right
if that works that works
okay
speed the um
tradition of my strings the controller
input doesn't work for me
all right changed input mode or another
explains why it is more importantly
okay
all right all right this keyboard
doesn't work properly aren't they
I can give tips if you like that I'm
very familiar with these franchise and
no tips I needed
to make the controller work properly
because this is confusing me at the
moment
wait what is this office stop working
awesome
what is going on
I'm getting confused
yeah this promised
I haven't had this software stuff where
I can find that this was weird
that was really weird
I I prepared everything before the
Stream
so everything would be brand new to play
and I could just kept going immediately
but yeah
it's not a compound stream if nothing
goes wrong
Mr is it
okay everything is everything is correct
now
okay let's see
let's see if it works this time
Activision presents
a smashing blast from the past
I will skip the video
[Music]
another test okay so it is working for
me the reason it came anyway
don't they have like the same slacks
where are they all the same slots by the
way
foreign
let's go
let's go
someone's gonna get a bit late
I said no it's going to be here but I
think I don't know I might remember okay
it is actually working
nice let's do this
[Music]
let's yeah there's some
let me do this
yeah
nothing Secret
installative I can give at the moment is
that sometimes you can't get out of the
boxes unless you have to call James but
you know that so
the idea here is that I will just goes
to where
the levels until I get on the gems the
color gemstones
and I would simply
eat this try to ignore
the 11 starts um
I don't think I can get on
industry
that I can get the gems on
yeah
and then go back and find things too I
think it was just two more yes
this was
I don't think the intended that to
happen
there we go that's the first step
what's the next time you can get on
holders I think
[Music]
do you ever have a discount there
is everyone I don't know someone else
showed up now hello welcome
and feel free to chat if you want
and everyone is welcome here so this
jungle is I think you need a green one
if I call correctly
suggest
speaking TNT's deadly jump on it instead
yeah so this one I win
I will not get it
I thought the loading would be a bit
quick
yeah
and I think this is kind I speak wrong
okay let's continue
there you go that's the good one
[Music]
oh no it's
not it didn't last
because
make that thing expand
this last one
[Music]
I didn't need his bonus uh why did you
forget the two boxes out I didn't forget
them anymore
[Music]
let's pick up some
that's not a dead
let's um
Let's ignore that I don't need that
it's only a waste of time
yeah it's like more than
because of those extra
boxes at the Green Path
I can't get the Gem anyway
I wish there was some indication which
gem I need
so I know
gems I can get when I have the get the
first color gym
and so that's why I wanted to collect
all the color gems first why is it
loading things such a Time
I don't remember the team being Muslim
and the uh yes the art thing
can manually see
that you were pressing that button
best advice yeah yeah I see pressing a
is
spinning a large platform lets you jump
on it woof
now I got some hints
hints and tips
yeah where is everyone
but they have the
um
yeah I missed that that's fine I should
use the d-pad
that's because all right I died on the
phone and stuff I was also removed the
mask I don't like that
[Music]
of course I contemporary
[Music]
not my favorite color level but it's
good I guess
I'll find it
I
foreign
laughs
hey let me check it out nice to see more
what would you call yourself
funny funny is
it stalking so much
don't have anything else running okay
it's just games
extremely of course
all right it's not terrible I guess
and that's enough spider I'm placing the
three of us
suffering more
it does
mess up my jumping
[Music]
when it balances is this a Super Mario
yeah yeah
I remember Mario
spinning
I have to eat the mushrooms
Mario
yeah
yeah you start off the start of a Super
Mario and then you eat a mushroom
and then and then it turns into brush
band oh if I'm
honest this one I should be able to pick
up the chairman
come on you found you found the swimsuit
half one yeah
I missed that message did I have half
one half yeah like
90 pan
10 answers
thank you the artist
made it quite well
I wish I could make it that good
maybe maybe
yeah I probably I think I just satellite
is this stuff on high
maybe I should just disable this one I'm
arrested
because
yeah another Dance movie
you guys are cute it's an old game
and this computer isn't
it
no not at least they need to remember
that I actually need to speak about this
plates boxes
Within
containers
viewpoints
no the truth is Left Behind
half one half answer
oh yeah that's why that's why it's
called a jackpot
because it's
some made bunny combined with an
antelope
and that's amazing
yeah
I'm about to call again I have to worry
Portman too
much
yeah that's the gym
wait how did you change to the swimsuit
well you see
you you take off your clothes and then
you put on a swimsuit that's how you did
that's a pronoun and she heard man at
the moment
at Mount
ATM at the moment
it might be the reason why it's stuck on
that but because I wanted to read by the
way like by the way I'm
going to
see her I see I see yeah okay now it
makes sense no no follow yes
okay but that's that's fine
I win
I try my best
all right jackrabbit now I'm stupid
I want to see it
yeah it's not
yeah you're right it's a jackrabbit
antelope
yeah the word I was seeing it wasn't bad
[ __ ] up
that was wrong
this one requires a gem if I'm not wrong
so I will
ignore it
yeah around here are different animals I
do want to
but anyway check it and
add some custom
badge to people
whoa that was close that's or I like
that not maybe not that I lived because
that could end badly but that's
um
I could have a set uh collection of
patches and then viewers can
pick one of the men
then I could have the bandage
represented in animals
then you can be different enemies
you would always be a decade yeah this
one across the gym
another question is
it just me or this song
this is a nice song
[Music]
and
I guess
less time waiting for
yeah there's a lot of crates you cannot
pick up on this one
I guess okay some of them were in the
bonus level which is a team they
introduced in these
15 boxes
this is great
3D column crates I mean here they call
it boxes but
they call them crates
it's probably where I call them boxes
but aren't they called crates in Layton
in the second or third questions
I don't know
I'm not sure what is happening right now
why what are you not sure about
just if you are curious about anything
is that I'm here too
entertain and and
answer any questions
while the
exactly now it's time for Papa
bear don't hurt him
yep
take damage
[Music]
and that's that's how it is
welcome
Marco Mouse
nice to see you here now now it's on
Crash Time
then why do I see no Fireballs because I
haven't found a fire flower obviously
the hydrate is done by the way
if I'm gonna add in front of white
flowers yet you see let's go down here
and hello cooker do you want to add what
hair to joined your attention yes
that was the same enough I can save the
game right now
that's like a cute idea
it's not the same anyway but
that's the first step you take out from
this area you can't use coconut
Rolling Stones
I knew it
of course I have to play as Pom-Pom Coco
I meant
I want to I don't know how to mod these
games so I can't replace
but I do want to replace Coco in Crash 4
which I can mod because it's using the
exact same engine I went
and I should probably not
the idea was to in that case I don't
need the voice because
Coco is already having a nice voice but
maybe I should use his mind is anyway
because it's fun I don't remember if I
can get the jam on it's too many too
many of these for guys gems to get gems
I can't find something secret okay
but I want to see
uh did you see the same icon it was a
runner plant on it oh yeah
there are some printable there we go
there's one
piranha plane
can I get this one
thank you fruit from that yeah
wait how am I supposed to get this
yeah that didn't work
well that's touchy
foreign
now I just took his turn to get
destroyed by the crate
I know
is that is the oh yeah the uh
the achievements does share weapon
screen it's just
I'm not going off to that team inside
the way so
oh wow gets beat up by Falling boxes
wow wow yay
second
hogwired let's go
sadly Coco can't ride the hog
because they didn't bother doing the
animations
I I don't know that's probably why
they didn't they didn't want cocoa to
make a creepy face like freshness
a GTM on
gem on
whenever it loads
again
[Music]
remember in the original it was kind of
hard
this piece kind of slow
down I don't have a
little bit
[Music]
lazy you can write a tag in case three
exactly but not the board the trash one
yeah
really comments already and stuff
yeah
yeah
hips
[Music]
okay I can dig it
why is it stuck to me so much
[Music]
from this moment for it I will count
this
I don't know
I don't know yeah but like why is it
stuttering so incredibly much
I don't have anything running in the
background
so yeah some stuff went out of stuff but
like
nothing that good
take this performance I guess I I'll do
the decision I will go and put crash on
higher priority
and hopefully
that doesn't
kill the game hey
I should drink a [ __ ] yeah each that
you're going to die
should you count intestinal deaths or
not because I will do some intentional
that's
hello Stella welcome
say goodbye to your kidneys
that's why it has two
foreign
[Music]
nice to see you here
and thank you for the second one
commitments come on
whoa
I'm trying to take crash but the game
he's for some reason lagging
so much at the moment
and it's only on this level of Our Lives
I don't know why
it said that
I I could have problems doing this level
he he did massively so
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
what is happening
[Music]
[Music]
and this is an intentional test
[Music]
what what
okay
this is done let's switch to the
beautiful outfit
as requested by someone
how are you I am I'm getting ready for
working oh oh yeah do some early
steam watching before work
nice for you to show up here
nice of you to take your time
to come by here
and we can even
taking your time I should have loaded
Graphics further perhaps keyboard
controls because I basically put them on
lowest then I just say about it
maybe some yeah
who needs
all right
but
yeah I got all now I just need to
did it again
yeah I didn't know what the timing of
that was because it became
yeah I'm not sure if you should count
his death because this is his name is
cheating
because this is not how the game is
supposed to run
it's not timings off and pretty yeah
it's barely running anyway
and yeah this is an intention of this
[Music]
sure hope so and I I think on none of
these tests should count
because I mean this isn't fair
[Music]
attention on this
[Music]
are you running late too much oh
you decided to come here anyway
someone's behind on TV
and yeah
no one's supposed to go under this one
I mean game is starting to run better
but
yeah it is slightly running back but
I I mean
[Music]
cute outfit oh oh
dear do you recognize the outfit
by the way
for anyone then anyone else can answer
that too
it is a reference
[Music]
I guess so it's hard to tell
I guess that should have run under that
one thing
uh
[Music]
maybe after I completed this level you
should refresh this stream to ensure
that
you're not lying behind because I don't
know how much this stream is currently
buffering and like Minnesota
[Music]
okay now I couldn't run under it yeah
okay yeah I'm stuck on this level
yeah what what what is going on
hey what's up
um I don't know the chain is dying
you know what
I have Mexican it was
because it's basically set the quick
encoding
already
okay I do have an idea how to get this
game to a white pattern and
I love you um
I like
that's a kind of new Judy none of you
still around what if she want to jump
because I am really gifted to lack of
what's going on here
as a game is
not now and you open up things
okay finally thank you and then we just
should know the content of that
window
I have been I haven't even started would
require me to get out of bed to get to
my shot glass I'm too lazy so
yes uh the outfit is a reference to Coca
it's at the stream I reset it
I mean yeah yeah that let me change one
setting
I will probably have to reset the Stream
and it
change one setting to make the game Run
better
but I guess that made this Stream Run
worse
but really shouldn't
wait wait where is it
I can smell it I can scroll
but why is nothing in the correct no
idea how am I supposed to find
anything's list
oh there it is
oh it's a no I didn't change that
so it is just running terribly for no
reason
when
I'll just try to
complete the level then
that case I don't have to restart the
streamlining
they're like parts and that ketchup or
something
is it's what Coco is Shawn wearing in
execution and you see her underwear on
over her skin yeah
[Music]
and the underwear outfit option is why
didn't that count
[Music]
it seems so stupid at the moment
tonight
it must unless this dream is buffering a
lot you must be able to see that
how much is lagging and one lagging
being badly progress it still moves the
obstacles but it doesn't look fresh
now I had to jump of it
yeah it completely messes about the time
and everything but maybe
it makes the game unplayable
this is impossible
I have definitely made that easier than
the original
there was a too early jump but how am I
supposed
[Music]
I mean
okay
I guess I guess
I can't even pause the game now I guess
there's only one option for me I have to
stop streaming completely 11 and then
start streaming I guess I guess
it's just how stupid it is
I will keep back when they did
foreign
struggling so hard at the moment
just doesn't make sense to me
okay like the chat
is lagging nothing too
that's me yeah it was okay so yeah okay
the game was still lagging while
while I did disabled stream but I did
cover it in a single try as soon as I
stopped swimming
I have not had this issue before
obviously the game the computer can
perform better way while it's not
streaming but
as we said the desk you don't have to
you can count this one left because that
that level does not count
that's that's yes
I have no idea what's going on with that
level
all other levels was running fine except
that one dying a lot uh yeah it is your
fault
I hope that does not
um
this this computer should be more
powerful than my uh
the stock computer which is not working
because
but it should have more
and performance yeah I mean it runs
perfectly fine now so this level was
perfectly fine it doesn't play me blame
the assistant
I mean you can just
you can't yeah there was one there
even though there's like this
no whole sparked
yeah it's Coco time
and why did they change the flower to a
ping pong he doesn't need more pink
she has enough pink
but don't you like pink
okay I mean
I guess
but
it was nice to you it worked with my
outfit
I hope that it's working to that one
the jump on creepers take the show
confirmed
[Music]
okay
become evil clients
foreign
more difficult and then like
I mean it is more difficult but
I can't get those kids anyway
but it is long if it's
foreign
because
don't care about us I think like a
secret nope okay
I need to move more forward first
and then jump over here
jumping over to the emergency
I didn't know that secret
oh
now you know
yeah yeah I nearly lost
gem on this one basically almost every
level requires a gym
you want that obviously get this one
here
[Music]
don't honestly that there are twice
hiding no
I didn't mean that for her to happen
yeah I want to jump up there up there
I think this should be the end of the
demo
too long
okay I got some extra life
back for the other thing that happened
before
yeah it's quite a lot quite a double
a lot of them I can't pick up
did they say hey two Secrets but none of
the secret has any painting them so you
don't need them
the outfit scene is over I guess there
was some extra time because of the
the thing
these circles ahead
and they changed
with this button
they've changed the uh
the direction of that identity went in
the other direction before
I guess makes sense that
you change the direction of it
and in the way the advanced no
restriction in the original game what's
kind of confusing
but I got so used to it so it was
confusing when this game changed it
I don't remember if this one guys yeah I
think this one requires a gem in the end
of 11.
but soon I will get be able to get the
first colored gem
medicine
[Music]
let's see how fun that would be
okay here's another idea
female
well the name is aquaku but I guess you
want do you want to change into akiyaki
it's part of
making it
making a female version
I'm a step after me
[Music]
well I have thoughts about changing some
of the characters mostly enemies in
Spyro
to be female
I'd like to go along with the
that was completely wrong timing oh I
landed on the platform so that was a
proper
okay I guess that's one counts too that
that is three proper Nets when the game
didn't lag out
that's what I wanted to do
I didn't think I've seen one
I couldn't say oh there I see I need a
job
that's a bonus platform
but I need to jam and wait so I'll make
you know what's bonus just the waste of
time I don't need those extra tires down
here it's 16 48.
maybe I don't need
this maybe I can get the gem on this one
actually
this is wanna yeah this is one I should
be able to get the gym I will get it
whenever I get the color chance again
you did wanted to change some of the
early drawings females I don't remember
if I wanted that
but um because I would require a voice
acting
maybe maybe that was the idea that if I
replace them with female and the dragons
that could require them that would
require them to have well female voices
and then you can have them change
how different the spider
and making a female layer version of a
money bag
possible brain
foreign
for some reason even though it seems
like a small enemy and therefore
the direct attacks it should be fine
look at fluffy dog
I don't know how much the bluff shows up
on the Stream
like a big team
hey what's the uh
right near this
I guess that was a good thing
oh he jumped into the middle I thought
he was you were supposed to continue
[Music]
uh
because it's like a
uh
[Music]
yeah completely so tiny
I need that again
okay
[Music]
[Music]
no I did now yeah I needed to take it I
need to do it after a glitch and like
that
[Music]
it's such a long
such a long Edge taking damage animation
okay
[Music]
I said I was out of the way can I jump
diagonals it's worth a try oh yeah I can
this makes things easier
okay that's it
now I got the timer
this is the correct timing
[Music]
okay do that like that that's normal
student
s now it should be the correct timing
[Music]
too late TNT I need to show everybody
I guess I cannot
I have to do it here
[Music]
huh
that's the correct timing
and there we go finally
finally
did you notice that before you had
blonde hair and crusty I am not actually
paid attention to that
I already got the question yet
I really
after I complete this game I will play
Casting maybe it should shut up in that
in that then and then you can point it
out
now that actually I actually didn't know
that
yeah you have to remind me
when I get there
there you go that's the first gem
so in the original game
the original craft one you cannot die
actually could
you can you cannot Spawn from a
checkpoint if you want to jam
that was the truth and you can die if
you spawn from a starting level but you
cannot spawn the magic point if you do
you don't have to get a gem and
they have changed that from Crush too so
when they made the Remake they decided
to go the same room as the late again
and also you could jump over this at
this point
uh so
so now in the remake and they made it so
you can die and still get the Jets oh
wait a minute
he would still make the college students
at challenge you're still not allowed to
[Music]
die
so I need to complete this level without
dying and still getting all the crates
look at that
No More Mess
y
remember thank you
I appreciate that in that case I must do
the bonuses
and that's if you did this
if you don't do that
if you did this
there we go finally
that's like the 3D messed up is left at
this level
can you get some extra free
and there's a secret in there
and if you did that
great for that great allowing you to
reach this
I like temper levels they make me feel
like I'm not being cheered yeah it is a
quite a nice thing to miss lemon
runtime
oops
you're not that I'll quit unless you
stand on the ground
hey
I really wish there was a restart option
in Brush for
the research option in Crash four was
terrible
it's about so slow
this is like playing spider on the
Nintendo switch
long learning points
you added to Adventures
and yeah uh and if you were curious
about the outfit change
and you should see
and I can have a carrot which you should
have some coins coins count coins did
you have quite a number of that
you get more in the morning you march
points
and that's how it works that was done of
course but you might not have another
okay but yeah you get more in the
morning watch
and if you follow which I think you have
you get you start off with 300.
and from that list there are a few
options
of
some of those three of those is like why
did I do that again
[Music]
our outfit changes
[Music]
so there is a sports outfit so she can
I don't give a kiss but I'm sorry
I will be more careful
and I even said that I was going to be
more careful but
then I acted directly asleep anyway
but yeah
it was a bit direct instead I guess
[Music]
foreign
nicely
checkpoints all right there's this thing
let's see if I can get this
timing is
I don't think any of the times
anyway
I'm a girlfriend now
okay the timing starts to get married I
was good for it now okay
well I got that one
okay
oops
I shall try not to be too Reckless here
uh
I now have the question
no I slipped off the ball
and I didn't think twice on
this is going to be quite Thief
so yeah that's always something to say
okay the sports outfit
and that would be Pon pon's uh I hate
that so far I don't know
yeah
did you add the original list before I
started restarting the Stream
too bad I guess
I want counting and yeah I mean they
should at least count one of them
I think
oh no I can't change it from here
there is the test but I didn't change
the key of it
well in that case I I'll set it to
and like this
I haven't changed the game but
I can't change it since it says crash
that's okay
this I seem like the one who wants to do
that
what kind of what was that what
concentration now
everybody
I say and
take damage
and jump properly there we go
and don't take damage from this
need the bonus
and that's one
you can do you feel like I'm getting
more than 100 fruits every time I die
it's just still earning more lives than
night leaves
are you doing just land on it
but oh well
daddy bats
sounds scary they're cute it's not okay
that's the best medicine
[Music]
and then I can pick up this without them
worry about it
[Music]
foreign
that's how we did
have you been here yeah
easy to say more than that but
I guess he's
you'd say more stuff with a kitten
or something
I don't know
nice thank you
oh I see
in here
foreign
[Music]
total so
let me check
yeah I got I had 21 before I got any
so let's see if I
still have 21 after I'm done
I am surprised how easy that went I
thought that was going to be my okay it
actually counts towards 11.
okay then yeah
in that case I have seen his head well
um at least the deaths on those levels
don't count
but that means I still have to do that
level
that's going to be nice
and not annoying at all
okay sorry about that now I'm back
we will see if he can do it but yeah now
I got I got to the uh so there's two
levels I completed the first level and
got up to the second level I just
um
I messed up with that right and maybe I
can ignore rather than me and don't have
to
you know now I have to work faster
just take your time now
we need to rush it no yeah you're right
I do I don't have to rush it
and it's true
let me just
be calm perfect fit
[Music]
as you can see
here we go
take it carefully over here
okay here get rid of this
oh I said I was going down
all right I need you to get rid of these
bad second
without worry of
dying to these pets
because that is the safe way of doing it
okay and then I need that one
[Music]
yeah I thought I was
the uh that you only get one chance of
getting that bonus thing that was a
thing because in the original game that
didn't count towards the
a level count that was actually made it
easier in the original because you could
just ignore it
but now you actually have to pick it up
so I'm pretty sure the bonus levels
didn't not count
of course the level three
in the original game
okay let's get rid of this person I
think
there you go
now I don't need to worry about that
hopefully it doesn't respawn
[Music]
and he and I don't have to worry about
dying because this that's the stuff down
but of course they would put
yeah
all the gems when you are required to
get all the trains without buying
on the level with this leveling
okay is that thing back no it's not good
and then don't get tricked by this one
notice you need to jump onto decks to
stuff High Enough
I guess that worked
I could have had a better timing
and then there's this one
yeah it's been affected it once now
I don't think yeah I don't think you can
do it on the green one either but this
one I need to jump on anyway so
yeah
I'm just showing you you don't think
damagedy has found something as far as I
know
foreign
[Music]
goes well
this is a technique I did it for this
bonus which
is
she stopped jumping and it confused me
down come back
the other bag is back back please don't
turn up please that's the count
get back to me
okay one two three four five
[Music]
one two three four five okay
[Music]
what was that
in the original game they don't sleep
off trains
so much free I need the food and outfit
they check back by
and two three four five another one
two three four five one two three
one two three four five
[Music]
thank you
I can do this
[Music]
one two three four five
one two three four five
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
okay
I died
this is so much food so much for
dropping apples but I might need to go
pick up
a lot oh
yeah
the professional like PK
cookie was right wait who's Cookie
your voice is pretty smoothing oh thank
you
that means a lot to me I've been worried
about speaking out
speaking out the substance
speaking like um unicorns
cookie from what oh Cookie Santos
bad person
foreign
I'm happy for everyone being here
[Music]
but I would not have any requirements
when I want to drive
that would be silly
call that yourself I have been
in there
copy
like that
don't you can't do that
[Music]
and you were so close last round yeah I
know
I was subclass and then I messed it up
at least I messed up early on
now it's only here in the edge no one
else what is everyone really to be
honest I mean what is what is
with ease
the only one went away uh kitten is busy
um I don't know where Mickey's and Lolly
said she was going to show up but maybe
she'll show up soon
um
[Music]
this is hard to see the chat so if you
do stand on this thing you can't do that
put something inside and yeah for some
reason
is the reason because you're slightly
higher but for some reason in the
European version of the game
you could jump over from the right to
the left side but you could not shower
from left to right side which doesn't
make sense to me
TV
[Music]
maybe I should ask one
okay
but yeah
I hope there's a clear Improvement on my
I should not spin this one
[Music]
on my YouTube videos because there was
quite
a break between my last video and the
business before
and I did that let's let's play series
that was terrible
my third one that's please
it was before I started streaming it was
like my warm up
so I forgot about that thing again get
rid of that
since then I have
screaming
because they're in the whole left play
and then edit the video and
foreign
stuff that's too much work
that's
plus having this interaction directly
with people it's much more fun
yeah the timing of that scene was
completely wrong
I don't like
that scene with trash man
[Music]
any of stuff can just be wrong
okay what's gay it was very scary at
least it's early in the game
early in the 11th
yes
okay let's keep
the red one
again
foreign
[Music]
again
Wellness this isn't too much for a bonus
level
there's a hand tie Bones from everything
no my mask my precious mask
why why didn't that one right
I can't know this on bonuses don't count
which I don't like
[Music]
this
into this bro welcome I should have
moved away worth it
that counts
because the jump button didn't work out
at the Sun
apparently I must wait for that to show
up before I came
the jump but it just didn't work out of
a sudden
that's the thing that's not an issue I
had with
so I don't know
I haven't heard that is throughout the
whole game now it was an issue
add that to a couple of jump but they're
not working
because that's that's not a fair debt
it's not bad
foreign
[Music]
nothing happens I get a phone call
what was it
that's the thing with your phone
thank you
who who would call Cocoa yeah like
who who else has a phone
a lot of people have phones but who
would call him
that's not the one that's on him
I would call something
they probably have fun things to say
foreign
things inside something
outside
the water stream
I'm always shy that's that's
I am shy
I bought this normal American Pizza yeah
it's just in Valencia okay
that's fine
I don't want the pizza with nothing
let's go
and I fixed it
and I fixed the redeem just for you the
one more animal sounds now you can
request an animal sound instead of me
mimicking animal sound in the game and
of course someone can therefore request
me to mimic a certain amount from game
as well
making the iridine better
I'm messing up my jumps now
it's not waste it twice
maybe is it
like this much
let me
um
okay if I disable the preview in
on obvious I hope this stream is still
working but now it doesn't render this
previous Maybe
maybe that helps
because I don't need a decision I need a
premium
and I'm kinda in mood for pizza but I
need to get in shape for my vacation
summer I also need to get in shape I was
supposed
I was supposed to exercise each morning
still haven't started
doing that I really need to start doing
that
I should do that starting from tomorrow
that sounds like a cute idea
I even got I even got the same outfit as
pumped on sportswear just to give you
motivation
thank you
it's actually
indeed I have him back when I started
exciting yeah
I miss you you know it's uh you can eat
pizza it's no problem you started for a
one with more protein in it and you'd
not be able to eat the pizza
yeah yeah I did actually do uh frozen
pizza diet because I'm white and I
managed to this
I cannot
so you can definitely eat pizza and
still be on a bite
I don't remember last yeah I think I
dropped like
10 kilos nothing you can wrap a lot
what comes with protein on pizza
stock package
same thing that counts as proteins are
not a pizza Pam Kebab chicken with
veggie shrimp mushrooms I mean yeah
Pizza isn't like
it's not like a pizza is going to make
you go up in right
blue in your shape you can have like
it's just a different shape of fruit
we obviously you can have like fancy
Pizza I guess
but
you should have a house pizza too
and that's true
especially if you make like homemade
pizza but I think me get me being on a
half frozen pizza diet proves that it's
possible it's not what it is about how
much heat
it doesn't have what you need to of
course see
you should for example not have me on an
ice cream diet
and also not so depends on what a brand
of frozen pizza ideas
I actually don't know it this one was
called and I think I ate my whole
I ate aside from drinks was just one
steam of frozen pizza
one two three four five oh that was on
five
okay just eat a fair amount and drink
water along with it
as you need and you'll not gain so much
I think I think I actually was on a
frozen pizza and soda
and I still managed to this point
one eight three four five
so one two three four five
[Music]
thank you
one two three four five
one two three four five
whichever I said is not a healthy diet
Maybe
nobody knows anything
happens I'm pretty sure that's on the
second right
[Music]
I think it's way too quickly
there you go
yeah
yeah
then I just need to get rid of this one
[Music]
and then the last one
and I don't know why this explodes
immediately
it's convenient but you don't get it
first
anyway
where's my gem
all right got the green Jay
it's perfect
okay it's perfect I I don't know what it
is I like her I like her like
I'm not a fan of the whole goggles thing
she has in Crash four
but
um
but the the way otherwise like have the
character is designed I do like that
more than insane trilogy
yeah it's giving yam but I think I don't
eat that much ice cream as I used to do
when I was a little young now today
me neither neither I don't know
however I created soda and candy stuff
last year
2020 and April December was pretty nice
good job
I kind of quit soda and candy for
economistrations
yay
this learning sign people asked please
the other kings
all right yeah that's it it just said
that's these arrows are squished
together
stupid game you have to you have to
please
I guess these parts too
[Music]
okay I mean I did I do like the Swedish
version because it says that you need to
be good and wait look this way I mean
we can be good and wait you're not cute
if you don't wait
good also means tasty by the way don't
be tasty and wait
I'm gonna tasty bunny
and that's a Swedish uh trivia for the
day
you have to please okay
okay okay
yeah
please make it
Mickey please wait
can I get a chance for this one I don't
remember what is it on the sample
all right
you're the best come yes one bad
a single beds during my day
I will
[Music]
and I will do it when you do
you are funny I love it when you're out
of here
why does this happen like I just tap the
button slightly slightly stanky
just flies forward
you give me something weird
I'm back fix
didn't want to work
today I've opened that lock before but
it's difficult oh what kind of luck is
it
where are you breaking in
where we are already breaking regularly
and why is it keep why is it kept locked
if it's broken
you can do that in yet don't break in
summer illegal yeah you can do it unless
it's illegal then you come to me
illegally
so I think that's so fine thank you for
keeping track
foreign
wait I can check myself
yes it did change that it does work
yes good
because I disabled the TV for better
performance
I need a better community and where is
my better PC funds
thank you
[Applause]
I mean yeah
[Music]
I thought I don't even know is there a
gem on this one
yes can I even see Museum why does my
button look like this works
oh she must pushed back
in that case
but I could still
get out the trains you have to visit the
normal team on this one
I think
because there's a second one of these
so dark
and
oh yeah
I'm not breaking into anything it's
unlocked or not trailer but the key is
missing out
in that case you want to see if it's not
you sure it is
in our driveway I mean yeah to my
friends if someone parks that really in
your driveway I think you had the right
to
that is
reindeer awesome like excuse me this is
my driveway you can't park here
I just got notification in my channel
and the bridge is
could it be new do you have like
why did you park your trailer in a
different country that's a good question
on our property team yeah
you're driving
on your property they have some products
today
and you didn't ask them to
just break into the training
they don't care about it at that point
I need fruits
[Music]
yes
and
there's the last one yes it's just a
second chance
wow
while the law here is kinda if you about
that
yeah I'm pretty sure you here you
wouldn't be able to just break into
someone's property even if they put it
on your property but you could certainly
report it
and have it moved
techno it's not illegal to park in the
driver that isn't yours
isn't it
I haven't thought about that
I mean obviously you just you speak
about your region and I speak about my
region but really because it is here at
least illegal to park in front of
someone's driveway
oh it's like you're not allowed to park
in front of an exit of any kind driveway
is included and so
you certainly are blocking the driveway
if you park on top of it yeah I would
say
I guess that comes that's actually using
the exit you're not blocking the exit at
this point to be fair
now
and I know about the little tricks you
can do on this level but that's boiling
[Music]
right oh
yeah
yeah
okay 10 seconds
and then
why can't anybody yeah
okay but I don't have any more money so
yeah
yeah yeah
it's like on
nice nice
yes I managed to get the Dragonite gem
on the tampon level I don't know how
much it means
yeah I I forgot to keep track of the add
things
okay
yeah
goodbye
so yeah
I do want that Medium
second keyboard Pizza
and then when the Williams beans
everyone without us apparently because I
can't give a sub to someone who has an
active sub
I didn't much yeah yeah it was yesterday
swimming and that means you get almost
an hour at Fringe which is the which is
how I said that I could do like
30 seconds and six times an hour but
that's that's just going to be annoying
and I didn't die while you were gone so
that's fine too okay so but I had that
twice now
I keep doing that
I have some lives to Spanish
I don't need to jump on eat a campaign I
need to talk please
there we go fine I did it
79 or 18. what happened the other one
keeping track of it
yeah
and uh it's been the same for me when I
try to keep track of this
easy to lose track of them that's why I
haven't bought that's Dusty that's
tracking
[Music]
thank you
oh
[Music]
wait they I didn't hear the alert for
that one
doesn't it play the alert because the
screen is off that's a bit bad
oh yeah I don't hear the uh short
message that I need I'll just say it
but very nice of hearing immunity if
you don't get wet you don't of course
you're supposed to shoot BM you can't
choose the recipient first and then gift
it
and because if you press on the person
it says that give give away that's
important I actually never give gifted
anything I mean I don't I would like to
but yeah
aren't you supposed I really thought you
were supposed to be able to give
it uh yeah twitch is a pretty bad at
um
and also answer even if it's going to
pick up people from the community or you
shouldn't at least be those people who
are actively chatting at the moment
[Music]
yeah that was pretty steep because of
the system to do that
Monday is an active hey
but but yeah I do know race range more
uh privately so it would be nice say if
he had one instead of course I mean not
not to say
it's too late no wait I can take that
back
yeah
there's a red gem at the end
I care about YouTube on Monday
I've just chatted so much more between
stage he says that
okay real for death count that's from
bounce Heavens are an intentional
distance yeah a bonus level not balanced
levels yeah and bonus levels don't count
as that's in the game so I want to
counter an intentional that's our only
one I go for
the jumps if I miss a gem I wish that
means I'm crate which is only on the
honk levels where I have to die to go
back
wouldn't intentionally die on a non-hog
level
I mean I don't see the point of this
that's basically what I mean
this one requires the blue gem
yeah I really I really wished it could
in some way to show if I like if I
completely level therefore I have seen
the gem required it should then tell me
which Jam is right
foreign
yeah
I I need to look out more about that for
me to keep
I guess that's good to know for everyone
in that case if you do want a big
specific person you select the person
and then on that person I think you I
don't know how it works on the phone but
I got stuck on the side of the level
okay
but you've you found
um
it does
uh wait let me check the first time said
yeah yeah the first one you gave it to
the community and then the com and then
basically automatically
and then you can select second page like
this person
but thank you olimian for giving me two
subscribe
although one was
not International
it is it gives a reason for that money
to come back foreign
did you still do wait oh
you did
but you you actually managed to just
like give uh the way and and then it's
like that
participant
like giant rock hey what's going on how
is it faster than me I'm running it full
of speed
what what is happening
I'm trying to fasting
I basically don't collide with anything
they make single jump
okay now it's like it's just really
close then
apparently stages
[Music]
my giant rock is a rock and it's giant
rock on ball it rolls oh let's agree
it's a rock ball
is there a way to run back through the
door before your phone
I think
it is possible induction
it is something that kind of like frame
frame perfect something or something
I don't know
yeah or you could say rock and roll yeah
yeah
I mean there's one level called Rolling
Stones so
again how does that happen
how
how is there
I don't care
how is the rock ball quicker
how this
how does this work
I don't know
I'm confused
okay I really need that one
okay I jumped here early on that
I am also you seems deep outside I'm
running straight down
without doing like
lightly inside or something
so we need to ensure
I think the Deep part works best in this
kind of game again I began
what am I doing wrong no I'm not doing
wait I didn't hear
you
but I didn't hear these gifts
never mind yeah
foreign
by the way
um
I wonder if we can change it during the
game
that's fine
I can't I can't do it yeah
good
again
around
and running was starting to have the
time trance
and I guess that's the question because
I can own
because I want to want to ask you more
people
when someone explained
developer
explain to me what's going on
I'm like not not running quickly and I
don't know why
I don't know why
um yeah what am I supposed to do
I am I supposed to complete this level
who once wants pranking I want pancakes
I would make pancakes
I should buy some ingredients and
sometimes
pancakes I think it's 300 grams of flour
um
mixed with 100 liters actually just
hundred half a liter milk
all right look now the ball is way by
I think this is uh and also
Justin oh yeah
this author just a difficulty in the
game where the ball will draw slower the
more it dies
quicker than I was running that's kind
of uh not okay
waffles
and maybe you should stop going 45 but I
wasn't even going any fruits
I was trying to kill as quickly as I
could
28 days so far yeah like
most uh you should probably not count
does this except when I fell down
because the game was cheating because
the game is buggy it has something to do
with it came lagging and making making
you run slower but it doesn't affect
enemies and stuff so just as you don't
jump in yeah that's on the whole level
which has exact same issue
and what the oscares control straight
injection about this is USC directional
buttons because it's very I forgot to
check what's the uh gem on this one
um
it was probably more than four
I don't remember how many it was
but more than four for sure
sorry a file is loading
I think half of it
I mean I don't know
how many did I have after the
Bridge level
talking about this because I did fall
into the pit those counts doesn't Jenny
in this
but when the game cheats
that
yeah I wanted to
foreign
she has played
uh but then what you have to guess now
I'm reaching levels
she hasn't played yet
soon
and it's definitely something yeah this
is like that
I can find it because yeah
and it was definitely not that this by
another game
I haven't this bad at the game trust me
okay
hello kitten
you're having a full party here
foreign
[Music]
certainly has
PS4 has its own problems with game we
play in the game I don't remember it
made this
weird
if I when I didn't stream it last time I
played it to be fair
[Music]
I don't know if I should say that
nickname I was telling you about that
and you think you can call me anything
nice
which is
23 minutes
should I go through the video
it says hi how is everyone doing today
I am doing great except for when the
game is a cheating question I believe
makes me sad
foreign
when I was talking to people for two
hours but I didn't have my microphone
plugged in nothing
that happened
thank you I'm carving Pizza
training Pizza not carving you're not
carrying Pizza no that's it that's why
craving pizza
everything I'm super shy about it but if
you're shy
you don't need to that's fine
oh you pumped it up okay
you should get some pizza inside
I want pizza too
I don't remember what
or if there's a gem this one
oh well it's a regular diamonds
but yeah I do hear
it's
I do hear the the chat messages that's
playing but not the
day Community thing even show up on
screen
let me just check
oh yeah it's the name of
this enabled
and
it sets to be playing

advertisement
I went back to the game

shrimp and pineapple pizza that's a good
combination
and my stuff did not costly acceptance
call it the princessa princess
wait which means princess by the way
I don't know
I have to make my own anchovy pizzas
because no one around here has some [ __ ]
well I mean you could order a plain
pizza and put the jammies on yourself
that's the snap count the game was
cheating
yeah this game is fine I don't know why
the game is so puggy
what is it why is the game so broken
can someone explain it to me
name anyway
yeah I have plenty two nice numb thing
yeah just Tuna on video I don't remember
show us anything else in the tuna Pizza

although I do want like a cheerleader
outfit with pom-poms but
a princess outfit would be nice too
this is
uh near too much
thank you he said okay cheating that
doesn't count the castle vodka
oh yeah if you're going to count it do
you think that's two you're going to
have a bad hey
yeah
right for that before princess yeah I'm
really excited for it like that
I actually don't know how much and the
artists
would charge to make more outfits
yeah because I mean it did cost quite
some but that was to make an original
character in addition to
team five outfits
include I mean including the base model
outfit
I guess an outfit in itself wouldn't
cost too much
let me ask
foreign
[Music]
again
[Music]
no secrets there why this is here
that's a count how many Hospital chips
after this team so
you might
be so be careful
after Captain have
or at least a pancake
I don't know how that would taste
I guess I need that one
okay
yeah invincibility
not sure what I should have it for
invisibility doesn't save you from
falling
oh
[Music]
there we go
can I make this jump
yeah I can
there's more like
the masked man
Right singing
why can't you jump
on top of a stack of sweet
fun thank you mask
cortex you drop the key
[Music]
he's not going to listen to me anyway
very lucky there yeah
gave me that extra jump
but otherwise
where's the
where's that one
is very one of the other let's see how
this goes
this girl
this goes what I must
I think that's your next turn
yep
two lives
[Music]
six to seven two more
oh this one is a funny one
I'm stuck on this one
one month
back on this one once what was the
tricky part of it
do you mean did you mean the bonus level
or the this this whole
this this section maybe is climbing
section
yeah after that is slightly problem
bonus okay
what was the tricky part of that
I may ask
curiosity
fight me
oh I'm missing a crates I wonder where
they are
when
does that have
no and what is it li-fi to design
uh but I missed missed the final number
I went straight to 70.
I got the diamond
when I went for boxes but since
somehow that said the TNT started light
up even
cortex craze oh yeah
and he started light up even without
touching it and it exploded before I got
to jump yeah
uh
well uh yeah I guess the game isn't
running perfect
it was about yeah
yeah the game is acting weird
[Music]
let's do this
cookie looks happy that there are no
crits from there would you be happy to
know that no crates are falling on you
okay I'm Fluffy one
he's so flashy
whoops
you ready
how should I know where the face from
[Applause]
than the rest
down here I shouldn't get hit by a TNT
like 69 I need to find another way
I totally did that foreign
but
this body is what I call it
I can't do this
is your car safer especially one day
[Applause]
especially when that thing is getting in
the way yeah like still in the way he's
awake
[Applause]
[Music]
drawing everybody very skinny lower body
yeah you basically have no lower body
[Applause]
here we go he skips like they
I mean
he doesn't even know what links are
are those legs even the people to
support him
and he basically have to time it here
you go you drop this
[Music]
is strong
there's some diamonds in there picking
them up crash
little legs strong upper body whatever
your cuddly flush the hair
this winter time is up
like the cocoa
it's a sign that he's made him fall into
that part
are you it's okay then have you seen
this
is nice one was first see
hydrate
and keep the kitten do you recognize the
design
mainly and Bones around doesn't cost
lives to retreat
I beat you
don't beat others in the chat that's not
nice
want to paint
pages
[Music]
wait what did I die
what's that no I need a channel
I don't know
the sign looks familiar yeah
oops I'm not supposed to swing this
no be nice now we need a drawing of
a kitten eating a full
I would yeah I guess that should be like
do you want to schedule that
what happened there
I mean yeah this is a stupid secret
because there's basically no indication
other than oh there's some around there
that seems a bit suspicious
okay
so
somebody
but yeah so so the current drawing is to
complete the Lolly
bombing and fun drawing
and the next drawing I should do some
custom emails because I should give it a
try let's see how it gets with the
feedback from the community
[Music]
and then
wait I'm gonna see how it looks
sometimes
and then after that maybe we could do
like drawing for music
like community members have people our
parents
as the animals they are
and I should try to not spend too much
time on each drawing to try to drive
and then we can have like a group
picture or something
here's an idea
[Music]
is that boy
that would be a nice kitchen yum yum yum
yum yum yum yum
let me know what you think of that idea
[Music]
that's what it is so far yeah that's uh
good idea
[Music]
do the redeem I don't do it properly
like the last team ah 69. I remember
[Music]
so
one two three four five yeah I should I
should add the ad so you can add effects
[Music]
okay I assume it's the I really wanted
all right I am I should just complete
this one first I can I can I will in
Celebration
there you go
don't want to make a little bit okay
what's the best
I'm listening
and I've been like while you give me the
pet
I will change it so you can provide a
text with the
now that's that's a point that's not the
mimic animals that are edit
add text yeah there you go
if you can finish this game with less
than 150 deaths I will add a bit more
yeah or deep oh
I mean I had nothing to do
well it's a private deal I didn't expect
him to bring it up yeah
do you mean
it's a commission yeah it's acclimation
I mean of course but but like what do
you have to say is
that's even more reason for why
I don't work
the ones for the team is cheating that's
it those are outside my control
I am honest though I love it's not like
[Music]
[Music]
it's not
yeah yeah like you have seen my previous
team I don't want to like blame the game
for my failure
I guess the only thing come from with
this is time but it's not a big choice
I mean if it takes me 150 deaths to
complete the game investing right now
it's not like I'm going to keep up
playing the game I've done in 15 minutes
so
and also
oh she would do something if she fans
depressed
oh if you want to do that I mean okay
that's do you mean like
me doing it hundred percent
what like mine 100.
what do you count
yes
I think I still would be able to do have
this thousand percent living accounts
because I mean yeah
because this doesn't count as this as we
agreed on
I think I might be able to do that
because I'm basically on the third
island now and you can't survive
running this so far
did they aren't this and I will
and that kind of designed to die a lot
on and this highest part is kind of hard
because the camera doesn't tear up I
don't see where uh
I am doing high jumps to ensure that
[Music]
time in
I have to be more prepared for that jump
and move it too late
and the hints are quick
recall it
correctly
you're probably not mistaken
the switch does load the levels
thicker in in Century than this computer
however this computer does spironol is
quicker than the switch
which I Define interesting
really it really shows the difference
really shows the difference between
optimizations between the Unreal Engine
and this this engine which I think is on
custom engine
[Music]
ERS are cute that's what he's saying
[Music]
that has been complete
I tried to pay attention to when that
start with dirty change
I really need to make it automatically
one point slices here if you have
different adorable I hope nice
how much that means to me how much
how much
how much
it really means to you
this is
a race of course where's the cortex
animations could have been better but
the elemental Mass was economy yeah I
think I think we get two biggest species
with class of Cortex
is the uh animations are just it's like
they have
it just added a lot more frames to the
other animation stream sluggish
and it's might be I had this should be
and also
it's too much effects PS3 is really the
F the air of
um Fox benefits and the game contains
all the system
and it makes it very hard to determine
where
for example fires in that game because
the fire hazards when where like
both and when fire starts to stop oh
let's start is easy but when it stops
you started salmon and the other is also
in which area is the fire inside how
close you're gonna get to apply
the uh
original PlayStation
One games with fires those were
polygons that was very clear when it
starts and stuff
so that's those are the main issues I
have again
and the developer is several of tanks
and one of the developers is on YouTube
and then
I think game hacked I think his channel
is and he has shown off a lot of his
coding and shown however his
um
and
custom code for Cardinals
and then
and as far as I know
yeah maybe you keep doing that
he has a video of him showing off the
first type of red cortex
so as far as I know he was part of the
development team of that game
I could do longer
and
and
I did that again
and
I think they added or he added a lot of
particular effects to that game to
really well
because he had made this custom particle
effect engine and it was running quite a
thick efficiently so you could add a lot
of photographics and therefore
I need to stop I need to stop stop yeah
exactly me for it
so that's why the game has a lot of
opportunities because that's what he
wanted not because it made the game look
better just because you could stuff a
lot of fun
is that the what you call the growing
pains
that they got more power but they didn't
know how to properly use the power
this is a one and Nintendo 64 was the
evidence is saying I had at the time and
that's why like me that's when the 3D
movie started
and they were very limited to how much
speed they could today it really needs
to be efficient
and
never put out the design and they put a
lot of efforts into how they designed a
lot of those 3D stuff
that's even muted and they put another
thoughts in it but then stations too I
haven't played my game cubes actually
don't know how much it's on that one
and that's when they
had a lot of more power and then and
it's more emotions I say and they didn't
really know how to properly use it
and they didn't really use it
efficiently
that's not they basically could do the
same stuff as simple Jason one
and then they could just
do more of it
without thinking
however I have not been a developer in
any form of any of the places concerns
so I cannot actually say how it's just
my experience of it you know and I know
I need when it comes
and you receive kids um
thank you
many kinds you make me happy
and and making using camera suspective
vegetables
hey
pumping at this part I mean sorry I'm
sorry I was alone
[Music]
I've seen the shades
did you have to complain opportunity
[Laughter]
[Music]
so thanks anyways to the Sportsman
hey hydrate
here we go
celebrations I didn't
yes um
and there's a second one now so
the sports brain
has she completed the left and she
completed the bonus and can finally put
on some kids okay
the racer can't be scared went back as
well
extra
all right okay I mean unless he do you
want it back
then
but this has not been activated yet
[Music]
it's okay yeah if you if it hasn't been
uh if I haven't
executed it yet if that's a good time
and you can get it back
Diamond yes I managed it did you eat
I mean I guess everybody subscribes no
one's going to get ads now
as it's coming up in two minutes
although if if it do get ads anyway
because that could happen you can just
close the stream and open it up again I
think I think it does check if you
subscribed at the start when you open
the stream it doesn't do any form of
checks if you become subscribed here in
the Stream which is stupid
or refresh oh yeah yeah if you're on on
desktop you can refresh I forgot
what about that I think most I think
half of you are watching on mobile half
on desktop
the tiny amount on uh function
as yeah already you should have one
not in that case you can just refresh
and
caps
and after this one no
this one
[Music]
let's find that one
why does these have a different design
on the pipes this doesn't feel
I think no you need to do I don't have
the game I own everything
the blue one I will get
the entire case
I will just go to the Gap
[Music]
which I think is this part
[Music]
oh yeah
I need to get really cursed inside
before it opens
you having fun fun in chat
yeah here it is
no it's just
it's just me very very very strange
refresh
didn't even add an accident
maybe I forgot yeah just refreshing you
have to wear the flats
I mean it doesn't work I think if you
normally get that but
if you aren't a subscriber
yeah just refresh in some way
the mobile you can but I think you can
just
basically
that was the at the stream itself you
don't have to close the app
and then
no
I cleaned am I able to do that
oops that was too nice
everything thank you you are so adorable
s
space
camera is supposed to cancel this for an
edge because he doesn't say that the
company
foreign
that's the electrocution animation
which sadly in this game he don't get to
see cocus on the way
that one should make a mod for that
stick questions
no question box is completely familiar
that's how you do it
doesn't
oh my
other her shirt still gets see-through
and
and if we go by the logic of Crash where
the underwear doesn't get see-through
she isn't wearing any bra
he eat
a good time for that comment
I think this is how far Lolly got
since you completed that lemon
I don't remember how to I did watch the
Stream
so here is this is not the collagen I
will try to pick up my Evelina sub kit
no wait she did this level too
I should be able to do this
nope
she needs to do that
what are you what are you
kitten you could ask from on a date I
thought you were talking about yeah
oh
if you want to stay on a date
no what why is that not working
and maybe
maybe kitten should ask me on a date
quickly
oh a bonus level two
and that's my way
what you're supposed to get this fruits
because you cannot stand in the air
obviously
but these jumps are very precise
I need that one
okay except for a second
I mean who wouldn't want to date with
fun fun funny skit and has a voice of a
princess in
foreign
[Music]
I can be a princess
if you want to
see princess
what kind of birds is this
didn't get nicer or something
we can have like a
Community Meetup so not like that you
wouldn't you wouldn't really count that
date but it would be like a hangout
well with all the Nicholas I I have for
you makes sense
these things
do you want to share
you don't have to I'm not I'm not going
to push you to do this
I would share about you as a princess
let let me become the princess of Sweden
yeah adopted by the Royal Family
but that makes us like 50 what
I I I I missed that I missed it I don't
get what you're addressing
one more is 75 percent
at that one you asked
okay if you want
we did this
do we care
now you can decide
except I've ever heard of a game called
it'll bleed for Dreamcast
nope I actually haven't I am open for a
game suggestions
I don't have a Dreamcast and so
uh so I obviously can't play that
I need to find some way to like
if it's like available through some
of them
there's games are
oh no no I got so far

there we go
and then
not actually
and actually are we in there
we go actually
it means
and then
that come here
Community has spoken
there you go
something all right all right
now
wait
oh I found a
key
there we go that's our way I could do it
sorry sorry for sorry for that it's just
happy what's important
uh
more questions
what's chocolate yes uh oh boy that's
that's what you call it right in Sweden
no way I've never drank alcohol beside
this this spider Cedar spider at
nothing
are you sure it's that low that's
I don't even measure it that low
I think you added a Sierra to many
it's like Street Promenade
and no smoking I don't drink coffee but
I do drink tea just whenever I want not
drinking
technically I do consume things whenever
I want
um how about chocolate is numb yes I
want some
chocolate Someday
I'm quite bothered it's just that I
don't bother
I don't smoke but I do drink sometimes
yes oh boy it says sir on the ball and
it's the one I go oh it's going to
release that no
okay
yeah I didn't think that they matched
such a small amount
I can't
yeah I prefer not even drinking that
kind even basic management is if they
measure the amount of alcohol if they're
not drinking it
just who I am
the biggest problem I have is people
have a travel except even if I don't
want to drink it oh look at this
actually we have to be changed this over
we have definitely get extra time out
again
you're almost correct
you would use if someone something lasts
for that amount of time
um would be
when it's an upcoming thing
another one to not die on
very but very well very very well made
written sentence thing and that's that's
good English
you're almost
perfect
so I need to pick up all these boxes of
this one
okay yes I need uh I need to do did this
level has three more that I need to
complete without buying
oh wait is this the one that speeds up a
lot
and I don't think speeding up but it has
another work
wait outside
[Music]
in the original game bonuses it didn't
count it creates twice level instead
that was your way of saving the game
and the animation since this game is so
awkward he throws it very very hard down
but then it just floats down carefully
and then and then when it lands on the
ground it just speeds away
look at it next time I get close to one
platform I can stand on
you can and watch John here so that's
fine okay let's see
yeah
those damn them hard beliefs play with
them
they don't even follow the speed of his
arms
and as soon as and then it lasts there's
a slight bounce and then speeds off
not quickly though but
and he's been throwing his crate so much
here it's been
it's a marking on the floor
I was I was hoping for
my smile inventory broken here we go
here's the course of these lemon
wait they don't even hit the marked
spots
okay that's that one
it's not that too long there but I think
this is the last one
[Music]
I think I should be safe
okay I've got a slightly pushed my
I need that one jump to this side
[Music]
[Music]
I should die and try again
[Music]
um cloud99 I am safe standing here
thank you
what can I see
blue gem
that one's pretty one
oh now it showed me the stuff I had
a little gem I got the blue gym
is the chat Frozen no I haven't anyone
brought it writing anything for four
minutes
uh she beat it on her first try now I
actually I think I fell off right at the
start the first time I started 11. and
but maybe shouldn't count that
but yes it yeah I think that level is
quite easy
nothing fragmenting I think yeah
but it's
where is it what is
what is
a girl 95 I think that's her name
green gem foreign
let me show you how to fight
foreign
[Music]
notification no don't give me a choice
[Applause]
yeah it is going quite well I would
think
aside from when the game decided to
act weirdly
it was quick
what happens if you
yeah I think he's going to break up yeah
I guess you're supposed to defeating
money
I wanted to see if you could a few teams
somewhere else but depends up
I might see those chairs
I mean if you have someone
having guns leaving our world shooting
guns a lot maybe maybe he wants to have
like a
bulletproof Furniture in your office
I don't know
he seems crazy so I would imagine him
having well if a friendship
here we are goofy silly nice and kind
memories
and also
what's your animal we are we are here
have animals
I mean this I bet that he's strange I
sure hope so
but I mean the hottest level seven shown
up yet I haven't gotten to a slippery
climb yet
National cat oh yeah that yeah yeah yeah
right
that's
that makes sense
do I have the gem required for this
lemon
[Music]
I don't need extra Vibes I already got
99.
[Music]
no
no the game was lagging I'm playing the
game
it was lagging but I should have done
that spider anyway
ah come on
nice I promise I will be very nice
would you eat cats
we have a cat we got a kitten
we add on a nice little animal family
here we add a pop hands here
no no they
no name out
what did you sleep up
I'm back but oh like welcome back
nice to see you back
we always happy to see you
I'm messing up
no I want it but I know other foxes that
does
yeah you're a nice [ __ ] yeah
laughing Fox wolf
I mean if you want to eat cats and don't
eat those who are part of the community
now
guys
I am buying a lot
I don't need the chance of our community
everyone else is perfectly fine
Munch of them as much as you want here
we go finally
making you run so far forward
keep it now
[Music]
no I thought it again
no checkpoints give me some checkpoints
[Music]
maybe the Cooper shouldn't be traveling
around along back and forth on a wooden
bridge
this first this very first
first part is really give me time that
moment
and I don't know why
before I crashed Cooper a non-licensed
by Nintendo
oh I guess that worked
the heart became a dog
and friendly
that's that's short moment of
back
uh now
[Music]
if the game is giving you a mask if you
know what that means right it means I am
the best
foreign
[Music]
yeah
yeah checkpoint
the European isn't here okay it's like
this one I think events here so I don't
even need all the
plates anime
can I make that jump
I don't think I can make that jump
oh yeah let's just [ __ ] on real yeah
thank you
yeah I want to avoid working on drill
because that's boring
hey
why did I do that
oh
that's cheating I mean Kim didn't give
me another option
and also when it came in 2015
and then
if the game doesn't give me any option
to get over a gap I have to do whatever
right
can't I just even a mask here
please
[Music]
[Music]
ah this is going to take a while
because I died five times yet
[Music]
there you go that's fine thanks
felt like it was more than five times
I don't need that one
another checkpoints thank you
this isn't it
maybe I can't see it myself
[Music]
oh my what am I doing
thank you
this level is training all my life
I panicked
[Music]
because
okay
I know
that's right dude
there's some white square in the
background it's a Minecraft moon
and my jump like this
wanna see that secret okay
it wasn't a red camera
yeah thank you
smoke
[Music]
no too short
there you go finally I want to skip so
much
how come they don't fast
it would be so much easier if the homes
is about fell off the bridge
yeah it does
it's okay but
it's okay
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
that wasn't good
[Music]
one more try
[Music]
I've had more than one more triangle
they're only one that's right
because I did there you go can I get it
[Music]
where the question is
in the first place
and I was hardly lying on this broken
well
well what's happening
yes I got it there was no ATM on this
one required imagine
I did it
Magic
with the coop as the magic cubas
the magic Koopas
can check that off
the lovely types of it's snowing but no
not magical fats
if I tried that so far am I doing this
bad
I'm still not sure if you want me to
just meet cortex or
slippery climb has a colored gem that
means I need a complete slippery climb
without dying oh you're going to love
this
you break every box that by internal
special gem
I'll think so so PlayStation buttons are
due to this video while I am using a
place in culture at the moment
I don't think you can change that
now this this level is beauty
[Music]
starting upgrade
okay
there you go
jumping on sharks is it chocolate is
that goodness
thank you
foreign
concentration on this
on this level
the chocolate chocolate
wait what is that benefits
chocolate bars I want a chocolate bar
If I complete this game today I should
actually celebrate with a mealcraft
chocolate bar
300 grams
[Music]
I didn't do that
am I stupid or something
oh I remember this level a lot of people
have this level
foreign
from the game
because they thought it was too hard and
then decided you know what we add it
back for the Remake just like a bonus
level it's not not like a snake
it's not I wouldn't count that as part
of the completionist
violence right right
you're not stupid everything you're
smart
my SmartWatch
I like chocolate covered bunnies
you want to eat some chocolate bunnies
I want some chocolate now
you have to worry
okay he thought you were at work yes
it is this that is the only time it
okay
What's the timing of this thing
when I was like but I can do it
I am at work
hi
working harder hardly working
machine
cool stretch
what's up
yeah
ignore your message me saying I care on
Swedish and it gets monitored garments
they started to be punished and nothing
I mean apologies not
but you know Swedish
me this is why we draw the line
yeah cute bunny
you're working hard and hardly working
all right yeah yeah I know you remember
me
me
yeah I think I think there was a
different uh a difference between using
a Spanish word in an English sentence
and using a bullets polish sentence
statement but
holy in Swedish
as seen I hope he didn't find it in that
case
just your message
and should not be approved so you should
be allowed to use the word even though
I think the word has been used before so
I'm really not sure why it was a peak in
that case I haven't changed anything
they must have updated their their
stuff or something
no now I know why already man didn't get
that one thing perfect unpolished it's
because he's a mod I forgot that but oh
yeah but we still get slight ID
that flags as potential suspicious
messages for which mods then can approve
or deny
it
I have had some weird messages not to be
absolute
um
uh we have some bad words in there
maybe important I would like
oh I didn't see any such message being
played I guess you didn't pay attention
funny maybe it doesn't show up on
Notebook which would be bad because in
that case you can't Monitor and some
Modern moments
but anyway I need to get going later
everyone bye bye everyone yeah yeah it's
up in three hours yet
still got 20 more minutes of painting
and it was fun that you did show up
she always
been here every stream I think or
something you do get a bonus for showing
up in consecutive strings

the sushi restaurant
at the buffet
with Sofia

inside
I I understand that you are
imprisoned
and I just cut off your arm but I mean
maybe don't don't pull it through and
then try to kill me I mean
I I cut off your arm and then
in in self-defense
okay
here we go that's what I should have
done from the start
yeah imagine these words though
I did it I completed the hard section
hey it's easy from here on
on this checkpoint isn't going to help
me
like it is a bit more time
let's get the bad time at least I don't
have to worry about falling down
now as you can see
[Music]
okay this one can maybe tricky
thank you
and then and then this
calmly reach the end of another
I got to be get ready for my stream it's
a confirm
getting a happy happy streaming I have
the best one
what
no why did I do that because I did that
I want chocolate now if I get no wait
the store is closer
and this plane
this is
singing the party already after she
streamed
Marabou chocolate would sit fine right
now I actually kind of I guess it's fine
let's find that so far you're almost a
halfway point
yeah this is like the hardest level of
the game am I supposed to go in like
if I just need to reach like cortex
updating this
I'm actually trying to get 400 and now
so
I mean to be a fat I want you to see you
playing the game and see how many days
now I had to go see that hard part again
I did that time never seen it
I said it's better definitely it's more
expensive but it's better definitely
much better yeah
and that's one
is the best but
but it is of course expensive it's not
the pink but
that's nothing
if I would rate it I would say
that there is
here
I said I said
I said
Eric it's not like this
pronunciation guys when you look after
the names but like the other
pronunciation guides when you
yeah
the packaging
Services is the best one probably
because Amazon
it's expensive and then I would create a
milka in like
milk
uh if you are if I were to say it in
Swedish it would be milk
again
and then marble I have to taste many
different chocolates I can't read that
many more
I mean there's like yup

motherboard than that
oh

toplet on and that is
because it's not it's not an English
word
