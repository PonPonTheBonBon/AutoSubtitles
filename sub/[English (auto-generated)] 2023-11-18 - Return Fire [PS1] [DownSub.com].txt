peaceful T you want to

see game is my favorite game should I

play should I should I play um a return

F now I mean I'm not against it do you

want to see return

F I can do it if you want

to

a night of playing

games I

reject I revoke

the well I can't really revoke The Raid

because I never started R he the idea of

doing a r if only you want I mean I

don't have a problem problem with

that now you're forcing

me

okay uh no that's not the wrong one

that's not the wrong one that is the

wrong

one oh there it

is is it showing up oh

look but of course I

haven't prepared any pred

anything

Halloween I it beat out season but you

know half a month later or

more this is like November not

June I'm not posing anything in fact I

thought my phone B

last

let's start a prediction I'm just going

to set it 10 minutes this time

instead because people aren't

really predicting like half the amount

of time is up

anyway so it doesn't

matter so

this is Halloween this is Halloween

Halloween Halloween Halloween

Halloween yes let me change the uh wait

what did I press on

no return

fire let's me switch over this stuff

here PS1 what's this

95 I really don't know how to write it

the original return fire was released in

1995 so 95 short hand but this specific

version I'm playing was released in 96

which is the PS1 version the 95 version

was released on

3DO

3

oh yeah I see the starting

point the start is

the doesn't seem like a map

so so yeah or it might be a spooky

map the

3DO H is that a reference wait where is

the swimsuit no yeah the swimsuit

probably runs out any moment now

well anyway let's a

go I do want to play this second there's

a return fire too but it does not run on

my

computer so the flags are down there

where the letters are so let's start

with taking care of these

towers I I want to get rid of

you H I actually want to get rid of all

of you for some

reason nothing

personal it's only because you keep

shooting at

me so yeah this is also what I'm playing

very and and and there's some people

like what you're playing shooting games

I would never guess

that I wouldn't say this is like the a

shooting game like Call of Duty or

something even though I don't mind

playing Call of Duty I do you want to

play it at some

point what's like the easiest way to get

oh no is there a fly Bing inside that

thing I think there

[Music]

is kissing pon pon on the forehead has a

great music

too let me get rid of some of this is

there a fly

oh okay when you're this close to other

you know you're going to shoot destroy

each other at this

point

yep oh yeah there are flag buildings

there are multiple flag buildings

even so let's get rid of more of these

and here

comes this thing oh it gone it

gone this it this happen

okay now let me

leave no don't get

stuck I want to K clearing out the

forest here I can go get through

easy anyway let me move

home love

that so yeah there's there Supply B in

that thing so I need to dig myself into

it let's see if I can do

that and this map seems much more

reasonable than many other maps of this

where some of these maps have been

crazy one mistake and the map is

over that kind of map sometimes there

they

are no it doesn't get

stuck and I see more flag

buildings I don't know why the flag flag

building some of the flag buildings have

cuz they're supposed to have a Green Dot

and then four brown dots are around

them um but for some reason some of

those [ __ ] buildings have green dots

around them I wonder if the tower if

there's a tower next to it it changes

the color or

something this game has some

music hard to hear only

shooting know not any real deep water

that's very convenient

here although I don't because for those

not familiar with this game this game

has Quantum flags as I like to call

them meaning that the position of the

flag will change depending on which

buildings because the flags are only in

those specific buildings there depending

on which buildings you check that will

determine the position of the

flag there we

go so let

me move back home

oh there's a tree there can I shoot

it Noe I

can't let me go I guess the scary part

of this map is trying to figure out

more all the buildings are but I have an

idea how to get that

I would just there we

go I go in the middle of map where is

the least least amount

of tur

Towers

trouts that me just making a

voice so so I really want to check these

buildings

last to ensure

that oh

nice

no

no no missed it everything's shooing at

me

okay

so oh stuck at a

bush do with bushes let me

destroy okay I've taken lot of

damage that we go home for

now there's a lot of moving back

home if you don't want to lose the

vehle oh prediction Tim is soon up put

in your predictions if you want to take

part in the

prediction the closest predicted time

will win so there will always be a

winner unless I lose the

map but by the look of it I'm not going

to lose the map it's

just but I might be speaking too

soon if we don't at least have two

different opposing

times there won't be any

prediction okay I'm going to remove some

of these

to I don't know if a posing times it

would be the correct phrase

here English is is my first language I'm

just making

UPS okay let me get out of

here stop that

do you know how rude it

is stuck

again so the timer's

up did I confirm

this I hope

so we

got two person PE two two persons two

people oo

exciting well then the prediction is

on May the best guesser

win

so here's the

plan

I'm going move down don't need to bother

about that

one and just sneak through

here no don't can't

St okay we have someone following

me no

Miss there we

go then I just continue down

here oh

Towers

surprised

okay I know a flying thing is

coming no another flying thing is

coming jish

Vibes I don't know where

I getting so excited

sometimes like when everyone

comes I guess I'm more excited during

the stream

and

okay no actually good this way otherwise

I'm going to stumble upon

some hi pon pon hi jaly oh you're the

one who

predicted oh

my

sneaky this is your chance to get some

points with an S at the

end more than one

point yeah still too many

Towers

but there's way too many mines as

well

head patting the hand of the jellyish

jellyish my pronunciation of Stu might

be wrong sometimes

as a yell

sometimes just want to go through here

there we

go oh another one of

the there we

go like

oh destroyed

that yep way too many Towers

here as well as M oh no I'm get stuck at

the

tree no now a flying thing is

coming okay oh no another flying

thing

okay there we

[Music]

go ah they missed

me okay this is way too many Towers

here I was thinking about flying with

helicopter but not when there's these

okay

know

what I'll leave then this is how you

want to treat

me I just came for a nice little

visit

take one

more I do need to get rid of some of

more Towers before I can fly in with the

helicopter if I need to fly in with the

helicopter I do I would like to get rid

of some

mines I can't see them here though but

do I have to maybe I

have the flying H sing we all know and

hate but the

jish have you pet a Jif fish before

I heard the L

hugs bunny in tanks hello Benny yes I am

a bunny in a tank I'm wearing my pretty

pink dress in this brown

tank the tank is so boring I had

to I how to where address this see to

make it

better okay so I think I need

to long distance

shooting no it's

surviv how dare it to do that you're not

allowed to

survive okay

so oh flying

thing oh the flying thing is gone okay

so I can't reach that Tower yes yet I

need

to we go now it's gone oh another one oh

nice

okay someone's Lo loading up without

fit had the jellyfish well once they

went once they went to the beach and

someone was throwing de jelly fish

everyone went okay like there's so many

mines

here don't throw jellyfish what have

they done to deserve throwing being

thrown thrown

here we

go look at these

mines mines every

oh oh two many

Towers I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm

leaving many times team

okay I'm out of munition while there was

munition there and I didn't get rid of

all the towers

oops well too

close yes keep on

missing there we go back to

safety are

youting saluting orian for throwing

jellyfish

so let me see what they can do with the

helicopter

first

okay

so I'm sorry I'm

sorry no I'm going the wrong way a move

move they like mines

everywhere

okay there like these mines

that there we go nice look at that Chain

Reaction yeah problem

is yeah those mine's

here

closer I destroyed it but not mine iide

it can

I there we

[Music]

go and there's like a mine here too

probably not going to run into it but

who

knows

I might do

it cuz it's

me

salting what's

that I don't I don't like how reply em

and replies get small sometimes they do

not

always oh oh watch out the F pon pon has

a knife

a dagger

even I think there's like a kitchen

knife H being cleared out area I can

ghost to

so pon pon eats spaghetti then she

becomes a fair bunny with uh thirst for

blood I guess that makes as much sense

as anything in L about one

one running stre into that there that

mine there I don't like that one look no

more

mines I do wonder if I need to take

these

out oh there's like full

[Music]

screen oh getting attack from all all

sides I'm sorry

I'm sorry if I offended someone

there probably by shooting them

but okay okay okay I'm moving I'm moving

I stop shooting

me don't have much health left but don't

running that mine

now that would be really bad moments

running into that

mine keep missing the

Tre but I do like the one of

the munition depost did

survive who needs a knife when you can h

a attack or

two

the second dagger is attacking her from

behind Okay this isn't going as good as

I hoped but I still haven't lost a

vehicle so I

mean I'm not

complaining now I am

my but

I'm but I'm starting to clear out that

area so I

can so I can move in with a helicopter

again I

guess so much

love I appreciate

it and nice good

Community we all friends

here even though I'm kind of on my

vacation at the

moment I'm taking I'm taking time off

from my vacation to do some

streaming come on I don't need to go

through the trees anyway but you know I

like to shoot

trees

you have to take that into account when

it comes to doing the

prediction how many trees are there that

P

[ __ ] oh using a t to slice up the pizza

that sounds like good good

idea oh

where do you come

from who invited you to the party two of

you who do you think you okay

okay so first we need to take care of

you

guys thank you for cleaning out the

trees for me I appreciate that

I'm

hiding don't shoot me if you can't see

me you do your high up in oh there's so

many oh no another one of

these

boom

ahuh Oh No More

Towers

okay and Tow here

oh wait to minute Towers oops oh out of

munition I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm moving

around okay I managed to destroy plenty

of towers there

I think that's

good I almost cleared out that area so I

can actually use it for

myself to restock my

ammunition well maybe should G pon pon a

sword oh this a double SW

oh I'm looking at the Emojis on

dreaming no I don't have anything to

issoot

with it doesn't matter I can manage to

get home with

this

there we go see oh

no someone is trying to stab her feet Fe

his

PES here we

go um yeah I don't have any to left

there to shoot down

so

don't shoot up

I what happens if your username is too

long and you have too many badges and

you also have the

pronoun I don't know what will happen

head p

p oh whoa

whoa comes in here with the the all the

swords okay I should no there's a deep

water

here

okay I do want to attack it like from

this

side there we

go but it might not have been the best

option I don't know it went pretty well

so cuz then I can attack this one here

from here there we

go got lot of damage from

that oh here's

one no there's a lot of

towers hey maybe I can get them to

destroy

CH oh

no oh

no too many

leave me three of

them

okay okay come on one on

one there you

go it shot between the wall and Tower

how did that

work that's not have this game supposed

to

work there was definitely not enough

space for a missile to go

through anyway time to move back

home I think that was a

success I wonder if I should

um use the

helicopter

I don't like that Tower still there

still annoying

me pon pon found SW and is happy because

who wouldn't be happy about finding

swords I would be kind

of weird out by finding swords I guess

it would make sense

some

POS battle taking

place maybe I can sell the swords to

some

see oh s timer is

over you hydrate and I'm not done

hydrate that's why I really wanted to

clear off the redeems automatically for

me anyway moving

on

so yeah like

here

boom I think I heard explosions and

here

yes I think I see someone there

yes

and then there's towers down there so

let's not move

down and then there's like a secret mine

here I will run into it

[Music]

someday so I better remove it before

that day

[Music]

happens

nice I think I did a good job

[Music]

there pet bunny

tummy no

no my beautiful fur that I brushed so

neatly

make anyway let's do the posture check

and the hydrate as you requested but 17

minutes

ago better late than ever I

guess

but it's running straight through the

death h be right back

okay okay now I should go

down the only thing I'm missing now is

fuel I need somewhere to refuel this

thing nice with less mines

now

there are mines still plenty of Mines I

can see on the

radar not sure how it detects mines with

the radar but I don't know how radar

works so who I to

judge okay so we got one there which I'm

missing

and like

that oh

Fel don't this oh my Fu

even because it's brown and not green I

think this is first map I see no

actually I mean I've seen my fuel

in

like my own base but this first time I

see my fi outside my

base

okay okay

the tank is probably dead if I

continue okay I leave I leave I

leave okay I think that one

well now let's don't not go over

watering destroy second sneak

POS

keep mixing the

trees there say hold Forest but keep

missing the

trees and L his

back I'm cing off that one slowly and

slowly I can use it as a

shortcat a short

Cat come on move

so I just need to continue over the

letters we should can't read on that

map because the letters are read them in

shallow

water I'm back but still don't have any

vodka

well life is like that

sometimes welcome

back now you're being welcome back

you're are

special you are special

you've been here for many

streams you have many

[Music]

points you are very

rich thank you

yeah

okay yeah here it

comes here comes

theing I still

haven't made sure how that song

goes just said I was guy oh I hit one of

them oh

okay

so oh no I did not get it

destroyed this s

good

okay okay I guess the text is still with

with land it's just that the big

map is just not displaying enough pixels

for it to be

readable because the land is a

s can you stop shooting

me

please there we go whoa whoa who that

one contains a lot of

towers yes shoot shoot me shoot me no

don't

shoot come on shoot

me not

you no I'm miss

you we do have well

oh no they're shooting me from down

there from down under there oh no I'm

[Music]

dead head Pet Head pet so I don't have

so I just need to continue across down

well that was a loss of a tank I guess I

didn't have to drive it

back

really should be penalty time for when

lose a

vehicle

shocking with high level of

blush okay I'm going

to break through to the other

side

don't feel like driving around

anymore and now now the tank is

mad breaking through

everything

[Music]

so I got a few more to the

West before I

start like I I don't need to

destroy every

single

Tower I just need to make sure I didn't

get

[Music]

destroyed yeah and then I had to go

across here because it's a

w then I have to go down here CU it's an

L there's a

missing and then I just have to destroy

that one now there's another

one you can't see me while I'm under

waterer it's

a some Marine

tank not sure that it feels so when

being un come

on okay we destroy

this so I don't have to come back for it

then I just need to destroy the last one

where is it oh it's behind there I can

do

that destroy

here then I just need to destroy not

that one

no that one well I'm getting

attacked stop shooting

me getting attack from all

sides

okay

H it can't hit

me okay you could hit

me there flying things

are okay I better take this one back

because I don't want to risk losing

another one cuz then I only have one

left I should definitely have enough

fuel to get back home

[Music]

and then I just need to take care of the

east

side and then I've taken care of all the

fly buildings on the

text but that's not alling there are

more

oh I finally licking one

peek licking pon

pon yeah you should have access to five

of

them I'm that

[Music]

generous

I hope

my attempt of a joke came

across I mean at same time it's my

choice to put them as

follow so yeah there's only three there

and

there more randomly spread

out wa let's take C those that are the

furthest away those that are the most

annoying to

reach it's passing through

here

well

Andress

cuz there there's those three and then

there's some more

today T like to shoot them

trees I can't help

it

so oh

well

okay okay should probably go further

south

oh

okay I said there was three left so it

should be this

one no destroy them there we

go no where are you coming

from no I'm missing them I'm not I'm

doing doing bad in this

battle

okay okay the tower is in the middle

yes no not one

more there should be able to reach it

from

here now another

one and then destroy

that another

one stop

it I no two

more where have you all coming

from another one

oh I guess wouldn't show up a bunch now

because I have to

refuel

anyway

time to move

up I don't really need but at least it's

quick to fill up this is very quick

compared to

fuel R flying things are you there's lot

of

them so now there's

like

I think there's two cluster Supply

buildings and I really hope it's just

those two and not some

more for some reason these have yeah

doesn't matter if I

destroy the Ws below them they still

don't get brown pons below them for some

reason they

have yeah there's that area to the

west to the west to the

West go go go go I'm

going go botom go

p

p p is back in

address probably like six minutes ago

but

still driving tank in

address go go go now now the fair pum is

trapped oh

no

okay they're staring at me okay there

are flag buildings in

here like you can see one

there and

yeah shouldn't be too hard to destroy

them but just annoying to destroy

them

oh flag flag

found FL has been

found stop attacking

me I'm trying to attack your

Towers

okay this seems to be safe enough I

should be able to access this

now but let's just get rid

of this Tower just in

case

yeah I should be able to access

that yay flight has been found

not in the location I was expecting

showed up a bit earlier than I saw it

cuz I didn't feel like it was that many

flag Bings in this level that it would

show up that

early just passing passing by those one

they didn't care

much

one

no okay then now I can just go there and

pick it up obviously if I lose a second

Jeep if and the flag is still there I'm

not going to risk it I will bring out

the tank

again I kind of forgot that I need to

destroy the

second layer of that building and let's

go down here to be extra

safe so many fly planes left

over oh okay uh I have to use the tank

then time to bring out the

heavans but it didn't Cho the

tank pefully destroy the towers so

peaceful Jeep can peaceful AC quiet

flag I didn't see aak anyway

anyway I guess they are annoying

like I mean I know what he

said I'm just joking

around D

out

see there we go is it safe

now mean now it's

[Music]

safe I hope it's safe now I

have I'm claiming it

safe and I will not eat those

words see I said it was

safe whoa and then run into that mine

there go go go

go go into the go and there we have

[Music]

it that look like an

wish we can see what the next map looks

like

same same oh everything wait one of

those AR mind what is

this marrow right marrow Mage that's 57

minutes and 30 seconds you know what

that

means that means that is was less than

an hour so the shortest time

wins and that is 1 hour and 30

minutes

congratulations I'm sorry jellyfish

Vibes K Wings number four 1 hour 30

minutes

let me pick

it how do you

feel do I need that that that that

wait I don't have

not so there we go game is complete

game has been

completed our game is 100%

complete I have finally finished the

game was OD that I do it on this day

though

with kind of an off off scheduled stream

to finish the game

on

what

that was fun wasn't it I mean

technically there are more more stuff to

do in the game

specifically and the multiplayer maps

however it would be more fun to do the

multiplayer maps against another player

there are one versus one

but that would be have to be local play

H even though you could technically run

the

emulator if you don't know I'm

running I do have a j

PS3 but if I were to play on that one

the quality would be much worse and I

wanted a nice sharp

feature I don't know why the password

screen shows up here I mean there is I

it's not supposed to if I if I had a

Next Level unlock I could check

like return fire PS1

passwords refer fire cheat codes and

stuff let's see

uh and we got

invincibility yeah I don't need

Unlimited vehicles I mean that's nice

and

passwords

wait this is a demon oh this isn't the

PS1 here we go

here's so I got how many words are these

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 and then

there's the SEC

19 they don't even have level 19 in wait

yeah they have level so they call them

Levels by the way so they have

two yeah yeah they don't have the uh

bunny heart bunny heart I think it was

was bunny heart bunny heart or heart

bunny heart bunny as The Secret World

they they don't have it listed that's

[Music]

interesting

interesting

well oh cheat codes yes so there is

actually don't know if it even was on

the PS1

version they have marked which ones are

3o they have not marked stre buil

3o

uh they have yeah they listed player

hand cap haven't listed what it is and

they have listed self-destruct which

isn't really a

cheat

just

yeah

so so let's see there is

a yes so they have the

uh like yeah the uh because I saw saw

they had that expansion the 3DO version

uh the PS1 version contains uh the Base

Cam and ex ex expansion of this video

this is like the complete

edition so yes everything's done now

someone should add all these times

together no no I wanted to back I I

pressed the wrong button get me out of

here I press the wrong button there's

the button I should

press so yeah so you got there's only

one so it's basically the same thing

here and passwords to

go H to L world so what I could do in

the I mean these levels would probably

be shorter but if you really like me

playing uh uh return fire I could do the

multiplayer maps too because considering

sing play you don't really have any

opponent vehicles in play technically

have a second player

um but I should probably wait with doing

these so you have like split

screen but it doesn't really change

anything because I mean aside from

having half the

screen um game still works the

same I guess I could adjust the screen

for so let me just complete

this

level as a demonstration and

boom so we still be the brown

team cuz that's player one

today

and yay another win and that's the

password for world to wait you just set

my name d

it can we get completion time and

everything so it works basically the

single player have half the

screen that's the

difference can at least like look at the

map I guess doesn't hurt yeah it's still

very basic Maps here at the start

so so

yeah does it remember everything

here yeah yeah good good cuz it saves to

remember cards I guess it

remembers so yeah there is that I could

do where I could just play against

someone if that's more interesting this

the L Car speech again

anyway let's close

this

so

yes now I didn't expect that to be the

end of the game but that was the end of

the

game now I've been streaming for two

hours maybe that's a better time to end

the

[Music]

stream wasn't that fun so probably

probably I I'll probably just

play against

someone in that

case who are we reading today we have

someone playing Arc survival Evol which

AR rabbit is playing Arc survival reol

called who I don't think I read it

before and then there is another a human

playing

Skyrim for a 24hour extra live stream I

suppose it should be live stream but it

is live stream

so good night P ah you go to bed I would

probably go to bed soon too another

rabbit yeah yeah yeah it's it's BX which

I think someone suggested to raid me at

one

point might have

happened or did I or someone raided BX

while I was in their stream I don't

remember

actually TS

decision alive cream no what what are

you

talking yeah because I not not rated

I so I don't

know but let's go visit bunny bunny like

bunnies and this bunny like is a bunny

let's go visit

bunny gu bunny like

right bunny bunny bunny bunny you're

here for the bunny right you're probably

here because not because of a

bunny but the bunny doesn't reflect

my personality I guess

o oh o welcome

welcome I forgot my links but there are

my links in case someone cares you don't

have to care about

links I should have my Twitter but I

barely post anything on Twitter

anyway bye sweet love you m thank you
