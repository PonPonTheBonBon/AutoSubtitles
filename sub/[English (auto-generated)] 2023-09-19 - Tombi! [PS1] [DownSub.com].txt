mean standing like

[Music]

touching each other

all right I believe the machine room is

beyond the door but as you can see it's

impossible to open it's been left

I guess only you can see if we can't

find

something else then

I don't want to stay in Italy anymore

there's too much homophobia I have

become heavy yeah that's unfortunate

that

how how normalized hatred really is

[Music]

like like I don't even understand

it makes no sense

[Music]

these people look so weird

oh the iron castle door that door is

still old it probably won't open unless

you blow it up with a bomb or something

oh another kiss I need a pump

you want me to make a bomb I

I was just joking I guess no one has

gone to such nice to try and open the

door comes ignorant I do have them

I made it a long time ago but it is

dangerous and I didn't have any juice

for it so I hid it in the jungle in the

highest tree it looks like a coconut but

it actually is really powerful pump

even the diamond door wouldn't be able

to hold up against this bomb be real

careful though wait don't tell me about

it

all right

conversation testing I don't have much

of a choice have you ever heard of the

flower tears oh yeah are you going to

yellow one zugi he used to live in the

mushroom Forest a long time ago but now

the forest you might be able to get the

ball if you practice Ball but there you

got it actually

emo kids wait right here okay I've heard

that at 10 000 year old man who lives

near the large pool at the top of the

waterfall knows all about the European

EU country to Sweden is quite

much easier

points

where will this take me

oh well

[Music]

at least I did the

I mean

[Music]

I didn't think

but these are still in here for some

reason

strange

and yeah

it would be nice if because

um

in the Haunted Mansion

the two angles are the same Zone and two

of the other angles on Amazon

[Music]

which means as you move between the two

different cells it has to load

do you hope that they fix that

I could basically place it down game in

the dream age

until it depends on which constants I

mean it comes out of PC I can play it

wouldn't be fun to try

look I can go across the whole Pond

without touching water

[Music]

the underwater Pig bag

[Music]

trick Village

[Music]

yeah seems like a good idea the same

foreign

[Music]

oh we got something here

who do you think you are entering

someone's house without permission the

10 000 year old man how dare you address

me so casually that's misters and a

thousand year old man to you young man

I find it ten thousand

[Music]

students

I see you must be one of you must be the

one 100 young men in a Celsius man we're

talking about well how does this sound

as you can see the trick Village has

sunken on the water there are 10 match

math beats with numbers on them hidden

in the water if you can find all of the

beads and bring them back to me I'll

tell you everything you want to know

okay the 10 methods

[Music]

however you can't collect the Beast just

by swinging through the water you have

to be able to dive underwater you didn't

ask me through the watching

I don't really dirty looks alright fine

I'll give you one hint just a while ago

the mermaid came by to see me oh I marry

me

he said that she found an important item

that she had lost in the motif home but

she can't quit to eat on her own the

poor child looks so depressed

if you help her by cutting the item for

her then just maybe maybe we should

teach you how to dine

because there's no other way to end the

time remember it should be interesting

at your Haunted Mansion right now

whatever you say

trust me there wasn't me

[Music]

there was no mermaid when I was there

working on my knees

Bishop the mermaid's necklace oh

I probably need that one

the mermaid's probably going to ask me

I'm back here

do you have some mind to me I need to

feel my

investment in barrels of water

[Music]

poisonous right

well let's go back to Barclays Village

and see

if

I can

maybe City Central Park

but that's why I can't reach that place

because it doesn't have a safe side

but why can't I Vision visit the hidden

village it does have a safe sign

[Music]

as long as it's not for you I'll let you

take as much as you want but don't you

drink it young man what

is this

but I wanna drink it and then we concept

of Ages

this world

foreign

[Music]

thousand years old but he called the

mermaids a child but she did look

kind of old when she was bigger and told

me but I can still be as a child but

everyone this kind of told me to sign so

I don't know ages in this world is

strange

[Music]

oh yeah

I do have it sometimes it triggers by

you speaking to them sometimes you have

to pick anything

wow this is Marcus Village is famous

wine passed on for 14 Generations no one

else makes a wine like this anymore like

water are killing this is premium wine

but it looks like water never mind it

doesn't matter I'm not going to drink it

that way all right let's see now these

guys here that goes there and there is

done

put for fuel near or keep one if you

food I mean I'm feeling

well gotta go I'm going to test drive

this baby adios amigo

such a strange

maybe

mermaid just has the young face yeah

maybe nothing

Maybe

or maybe the hundreds of thousand years

old by this hundred thousand year old

that doesn't really have a little about

the 80s anymore

that's almost a possibility

so the thing now is that I just need to

find

[Music]

when you're here

I can still go here

there's one more place

trying to think what more can I do I can

go on the ground

that that thing I destroyed it's a

secret opening a secret passage

foreign

[Music]

I'll do this one time elliptical

that reminds me of things I have seen

because underwater here

pics of gas blenders that were installed

in cars

that's back then that's the yellow USB

man look yeah I I haven't done anything

wrong I mean I said yes really uh look I

can see you're good at swimming and all

but if you stay in the water too long

you'll start turning weird colors like

we see

so I'm sure you want to get out of the

water and just go away I don't know

I'm I'm warning you that I can beat

anyone and anything when it comes to

water

okay

so

excuse me

that was the route

come on

[Music]

stop doing that

I'm going to show you there

okay

[Music]

[Music]

oh I had it

hello

[Music]

nope

[Music]

anything

but I win put our last

[Music]

so hard to attack anyone can always get

trouble okay

[Music]

well that was interesting

keep missing

there we go finally

and this is

[Music]

Parallax planets keep her within my spot

whoa oh my are you complimenting my butt

now

[Music]

wait how am I supposed to get there

going on streams

my leg is possible that's a cute but if

you watch the Pom-Pom mod making videos

angles

interesting path here

that but

what's up here check that out

Bend are you kidding me do you think I

have something like that what did I tell

you but what makes you think I can't

give it to Someone Like You price

keepers are fine if you go to pound like

that you can have this in once

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

there you go I got the thing about there

is one more thing

right

too far

too far took it too far no but I should

go to the August Village

[Music]

because I found pumped and cheese again

and the former Mouse now I'm human thing

looking thing and one's more cheese

and I guess you get two rounds of some

cheese something

me

[Music]

it's a single thing way to break the

game

certainly it is not us and more chance

to get

right

I like the music

[Music]

wow that's a lot of cheese I have to

give you something really special now

yeah I'll take this it's the golden

fruit

oh I see someone so when I got all of

the

one of the five golden knights is what

brought by the butterflies the golden

fruit that only grows in a special place

check or hear it

[Music]

in the way you apply for us on the

ground here it said that there is a lady

there a place where Treasures were

stored

on the ground treasure well she's been a

lot of those so far

so I can use the why now because it's

Unbreakable

whale maybe 100 million years opposite a

thousand thousand year old man

shower while someone else got a personal

General Store what is the one

service car cleaning got the car service

yeah actually that's

car service which was really nice and

I'm really happy

about it is nothing to worry about it

okay my voice so she is here

oh you foreign

well let's talk about the evil pigs the

reason why you're collecting gold the

very source of their evil might come

from the gold by collecting more and

more gold do you stick to unleash more

powerful evil spells whoops I think

that's why they are so relentless in a

search for gold it's been sent from long

ago that the evil Four Sisters the

reciting code you know

what is becoming too dangerous to allow

the evil pigs to go one like this

[Music]

we must stop them before they acquiry

too much gold and too much power first

you must see the pigs one by one in the

evil pigs that you have collected so for

yeah I'm definitely not done that yet

and do some songs

you've been to all the seven Lanes

already it shouldn't be hard to find all

of the evil pigbacks now if you still

haven't found all of them you must go

back to the address but I haven't fully

explored yet

I hope that someday all Seven Peaks

wouldn't be sealed away forever if you

go to the secret room

me

you will find I just hope that someday

all Seven Peaks will see you later

I believe this I was six years yeah I

read it's not easy for you being me

no excuses I want

I'm just disappointed

foreign

that is the dialogue he had

4C

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I have a strange feeling that the evil

pigs are not the only cause

I feel like you told me has something to

do

[Music]

learn what it seeds

two thousand points plus a flower garden

one thousand points

maybe we'll never be able to see flowers

ever again doesn't be dramatic

[Music]

[Music]

was just lying around somewhere

like let's see if again

I got another more cheese

[Music]

thank you

but I got more cheese

[Music]

but before I use the sheets

[Music]

maybe maybe

he only takes 15 cheese but you're

giving 20 seeds so it's easier for you

more stuff but yeah

the remaining questions

what's this

guy is blue and it's so beautiful

now I never knows

thank you thank you very much a lot we

thank everyone for coming to my concert

by singing just one more song

one a two one two three oh wow how long

have you been standing there

you heard me oh wow I better singer what

did you think of my angel-like voice

I'm just kidding in fact I don't even

like being embarrassed I'm afraid this

is a very serious matter

and you don't have to be scared instant

Piggy

[Music]

you're going to do that

[Music]

whoa whoa whoa

what

that was me

yeah

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I didn't count it was close though

thank you

[Music]

come on I should have counted

[Music]

to finally I can didn't see what I was

doing

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

nope

nope

I messed up Timothy Papa Woods

too late

[Music]

give me

no

that was a good moment

there we go and he

finally

now the hundred thousands 20

[Music]

000 points can be returned to normal

let's see the cutscene

how should this place look oh look that

looks much pain

[Music]

my name is

Mike

I know I've been

good time zone

ah do I have a good time soon

thank you

a black pig bag

[Music]

here I never cared about it

a million years

yes I did that one

oh no

what how could this be all Seven Peaks

have been sealed and yet another evil

pink bag and another real piggy what is

now I heard that there could be one more

you will be hiding somewhere but until

now I thought it was just a rumor

pick has to be the one that control the

other seven the ultimate European the

good news is that we have either the

evil people have any gate right here

before us all we need to do is

[Music]

the real evil speak

oh

there's no way you'll open a door Give

It Up Wait it doesn't open

I know

oh no

Master we follow the straw Hmm this is

yes this is something like a test of

which the door closed when they even

beat that was here disappeared so if

seven people get on top of these Seven

Stars the ocean open

seven friends okay

I get it we need to find seven friends

that will need to help us

wait why can't we just find six friends

aren't you one of them

always here until you get back to tell

your friends to come straight to you

don't you dare come get here

no

[Music]

I'm just making that too

I'll explain everything to your family

if you can't cut seven people come back

here anyway

yeah because you are one people right

why not just find seven rocks yeah what

do you know six because he's a rock

and this is the brain it's a rock

well

who should I ask

let's start from the beginning

[Music]

who will deny like if someone was to ask

you if you're in living in a world where

you have an evil

creature using evil magic to make your

world worse and you have someone who can

defeat this evil person and they ask you

like okay

all we need you to do is stand on this

platform that's all you have to do

nothing else would you deny that maybe

afraid that even

it hurts

because I need to find specifically

seven people and I guess it's

specifically seven people I can talk to

apply this one right

so we'll see

anything nice

and I wonder if it's seven specific

people or just any seven people because

if it's anything people that could be

kind of interesting

yeah you're also probably too light

fear is something about these are

friends will return

to start this may be temporary maybe

permanently who knows that sounds

interesting that's that's quite a plot

twist we have to defeat this evil person

but we have to turn you into statue and

we might not be able to turn it back

we will not be able to turn it back even

so you have to offer your life

to make it work a place

hello friend

no no no

I need your

okay he's too old he he doesn't care

who cares about him we didn't like him

anyway

we need your soul

dude I ask

Ed me amazing

train to enjoy my tiny

[Music]

oh look have you seen that this kind of

looks like a butt scene from above or

something

oh no the butts are gone

thoughts that are protecting me from

taking damage from those spikes are gone

he he said but yeah I did say but

what's with that

[Music]

I know we are my friend

you decided my boy you and I are friends

now

yeah come with me

[Music]

you're not a friend you're not a friend

oh there we go and what's he did Tommy

you and I are friends I'll be right

behind you

one friend found oh yeah yeah of course

the person who claims to be my friend is

not my friend but the person who claims

to be my friend is my friend

it makes perfect sense

there while friends two three four five

six seven eight okay

so I need to basically find there's no

friendly mushroom Forest

what is this

share this way

[Music]

but one has kids but I do have a kid but

I think

I do have a picture of myself in a dress

which I posted on the same way

which you are on maybe they see it I

didn't show my butt in that piece

that would be kind of weird

[Music]

well kind of thousand points almost

points one

is that everybody kill us about

something just

nice

[Music]

or and a few my friends

[Music]

okay it's yours my friends

you know what maybe eat friend is in

each Village that might be a thing

so

I go to the Dwarf Village this one I got

the

breakfast Village just to just hit the

village there is the civilization

Village

what more Villages are they

there is uh the Haunted Mansion that

case

okay let's see is that person standing

up here

impressive and Skip I skip most anyway

I don't want the fish I want that oh how

much is

[Music]

[Music]

um Okay so

I still don't have the silver I don't

think

I don't know why I'll get it from

what okay I haven't seen any person

there here from a single person I think

Deep Jungle I've tried to look through

that

the only thing I can think of is that

the Haunted Mansion has some friends I

need to go through every door

[Music]

it's kind of wants the orb oh I mean I

wouldn't mind a like a crystal worm a

little bit nice and cute got that

way you say Pony

messy hundred thousand years old man and

the million years

[Music]

hello do you want to be my friend

[Music]

but I heard that the mighty fish will

appear when you put this food in the

water okay

that's what he said okay let's see

[Music]

we're not here

[Music]

it's always been three hours

and I said I've been kind of tired I

don't know how no noticeable it has been

on stream

and

[Music]

there he is what happens wait what I

already got me item and you haven't

changed okay

do you wonder what the other things

would be

thank you

[Music]

the only thing I can think of is that

every region has

[Music]

imagination

[Music]

it wins let's see

[Music]

it's a personal thing

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

are you able to use it whilst in the

water

boyfriend sound oh there we go EMP Go I

mean I'm scared but I don't go so I knew

it was would be one in the end

immersion

I can probably not this

exactly

and you mean water

fish food I have to try

yeah the fish food in the deep water

that's right

mermaid yeah I mean

I didn't think it would work because it

usually works when you're standing on

the edge

down

if you guys want to see the mermaid

again

[Music]

welcome Jordan

good morning it is quite evening here

kinda

so whether I found one in village

[Music]

did not find the one there

[Music]

should remember

why I found them

one day not one day one here from here

[Music]

from this one

not the one here

maybe there's one in the Old Pond

good morning to me yeah I mean that was

good

yeah okay

looking for some friends and I should

really keep track of which part of this

region I'm into

that's me

no

no

[Music]

I wanted to see if there was some person

on the other side

and I don't think I still need a single

powder

[Music]

so I don't think there is one in the

very first

oh here I got that one and then there's

mushroom Forest maybe there's a person

here

could be a person here

a little chest hairs though

and the many opportunities

[Music]

can actually listen immediately

well I can't kill it but I can't kill it

when it opens up at least

[Music]

but the question is before it does that

foreign

[Music]

and okay

let's move down the ends this is going

to give me the important

[Music]

why does it need to be so high up

[Music]

we go

[Music]
