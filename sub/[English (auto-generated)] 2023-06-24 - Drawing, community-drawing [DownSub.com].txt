thank you

welcome

I hope everything is working

so

[Music]

I should switch over to this view there

you go

and open the

the artwork you also again last time

[Music]

come on

[Music]

and I was curious if I should add the

internet

maybe I should add it invitation like

bag even though she cannot see it

[Music]

so

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

and

foreign

so this should be one of the

new songs added

OBS doesn't really tell me what song

it's playing

[Music]

it just tells me there's hints of sun

it would be nice if it

load me what has a minute to add it on

screen I've got plenty of extra space

[Music]

thank you

now

foreign

[Music]

thank you

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

a victory

quite well I think there could be some

improvements on that but

like for example you can use a vector

I mean a benefit of directly is of

course if if I had in the second line I

can just cut it on one side that's very

convenient

foreign

[Music]

like if I'm referencing a vegetarian

feeling it's referencing it as it was a

rest really

you find a bit silly

and it does it mostly kids

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

but yeah I guess that's the other

benefits after drawing a line I can make

[Music]

no adjustments to it this one

and of course like yeah it's like

slightly off against rotate it

[Music]

laughs

[Music]

which of course

you can technically do if you don't

regular line like this

[Music]

let's let's uh

this is the vector line a duplicate

layer

rasterize it

now the right one is

this is pixel based and the other one is

Vector based but it's rendered in

pictures of coins

that means that if I

rotate it

15 degrees both of them

[Music]

the pixels based must used to pick some

State determine this is not without

blurring

ugly but the vector one is nice and

clean see

it's even more obvious

if you rotate it back

now it needs to even more calculations

[Music]

now this this raster is so blurish

but they make the one is still very

sharp

[Music]

and of course the greatest feature about

Vector is

scaling it up

foreign

difference between the vector and

the raster but the vector line has

another benefit for example in this case

it did change the width of the Escape of

the line you can also scale it without

changing the wrist just keeping the old

width

but being the

what the size of the knee

so you can rescale

a thing

[Music]

yeah so if you add a thing

yeah anything a little bit larger we can

rescale it obviously then you have to

place my chest pins

or or make it smaller

and it will keep the same

a thickness of lines as if you had drawn

it at the smaller scale

really useful features

I still do like the way

I think it's

possible going to sign

unless it's a sign

and

procreate it's another software I do

think they create

blinds much much nicer than

lipsteady paints

I mean also the artists have seen

drawing this software and they are more

experienced drawing as well so they can

benefit from that of course

but the way I seen it

um recalculate the lines they get so

much nicer

[Music]

and while this software does have some

function for that somewhere

to

[Music]

correction of course

[Music]

like it has

[Music]

no connection but

that's not exactly what I'm looking for

yeah

not even crying like that sis

[Music]

thank you

I mean I guess I could have some

no there's a stability

[Music]

I said if I increase it too much it's

Not Gonna Keep Me Up

[Music]

oh yeah how does that make sure if I do

this it does are maybe this

[Music]

I mean if it is

and this collection thing is so weird

oh

[Music]

my God

[Music]

it's just like it by in

foreign

but those softwares don't support

make the layer and

[Music]

they are technically still drawing a

vector

[Music]

because it does the

even if they don't have I don't think

they even have a Victorian option

they still draw a vector while you're

Drawing the Line

and then they come they rasterize it

I just don't I

I want everything it does it just don't

want it to rasterize it and

it's the only thing

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

thank you

oh oh

[Music]

what and what the sign should be this

time then

and this one

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I think it turns out quite nice here

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

additional music this time it's a pretty

previous music quite

many times

[Music]

thank you

music is nice that's good

yeah I did contact the

regarding the permissions and they said

that it's it's okay

if I

it's just a vote from the

live stream

[Music]

God is such a strange name because I

bought this short for video on demand

and

[Music]

and most video online video sources are

votes

it makes sense like within twitch like

you have bought and then you have live

streams that makes sense

but everything is basically about on

YouTube or something

foreign

because they said that it's okay to just

use the generic credit for Bots

every video on YouTube is about so

except live streams of course I mean

YouTube answers live streams look at

about that

technically

no

I know that's not what that means but

[Music]

as can I got in the meaning of something

that was not on the band that is on

demand now

and I like how people use it

that's a weird looking hand

thank you

[Music]

I am

and that means I can cut this off

and of course it's not a strapless dress

so let's add those as well

I mean I was using the uh

around the stream as a reference to how

I should drop fun does it work now

because the dress is gone I wonder is

hmm

no one still oh I got one what you need

that nice

hey yeah I feel like watching this

dream you don't have to follow me on the

inventor because I'm just going to post

the pictures I make

I will post it on

the discursor and inventor entity

I guess it's a nice place to go back and

look at previous artworks to be fair

yeah that's a reference a case

yes

thank you

foreign

by that I mean

only is it

I've had in it I

[Music]

just never work

it's a bit weird and it is

[Music]

oh you kittens

then we pick it

arm hand it's definitely needs to be in

far down

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

that's me kitten I love if he nice

that is it love to share some

[Music]

love and

happiness

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

older songs but still play but

[Music]

a lesson is coming

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

do you

[Music]

know

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

and funny things

yep

[Music]

retails on each foot

and four fingers

the water bunny has

four toes on each foot by part

and five finger inside

how many fingers are passed in your

character have

[Music]

almost

maybe that works

I Define heaven like

or fingers to be cute

four feet were across

is a bit tricky maybe I should get it

from the other way

nope

sounds clean

[Music]

the thing is because

of the

[Music]

United

oh yeah if I

like that

as it's stuck

hey it's basically summer it's

officially summer it's been officially

summer since April I think

in Sweden these different countries have

different rooms running

when summer begins

Tom defines it by based on

[Music]

the solstices

some Define it based on the months

some like Sweden defines it based on the

temperature history

let's make this family

well

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

it is

[Music]

the most common message from kitten is

cute

[Music]

yeah

it's a perfectly fine message

we need to recognize things as cute

[Music]

I'm sorry don't be sorry

[Music]

[Music]

good

morning

happy indictment right

a lot of

worked into my Arts

I have

I really like how

[Music]

funny

[Music]

you're welcome

I do like how how well it's

actually

yeah because I was kind of scared

of how terrible it's I still think some

art

still acceptable but like I did try to

draw

like

human emote

I think it looks like a child

[Music]

so

not happy with that but

maybe it should be like this

[Music]

so I thought they were supposed to be in

this bag

foreign

[Music]

so this will function as the mask

and let's see how are the eyes

one point speed eyes

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

lines

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

hopefully no one gets Nightmares From it

[Music]

what is going on here

what is this kid it's it's drawing is

going on here

this this big

strong and vanish

water bunny

is

protecting pon pon from these shadow

creatures which I haven't drawn yet

[Music]

my legs cute thank you

sessions already

which session

[Music]

what kind of thresholds are we talking

about

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

to find me

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

it's

it's not like that

I don't have that kind of relationship

with butter

and I have no idea if even interested in

even though I'm not available

protecting pumpkin from the dark matter

but also

not letting ponpon get consumed by the

the Shadows

even though she's already been consumed

by the Shadows because I already got a

evil version of SpongeBob ready to go

[Music]

eat

I've seen some wild bunnies in my

backyard yet lately all right even just

some white bunnies not some wild and

crazy bungees and anyone behind me has

the large garden the enable it

large

it makes it far a bit more like

didn't grow stuff maybe

or it's just natural stuff to eat blood

I haven't seen any

yeah yeah in that case I can see why it

would attract some bunnies

yeah I've had some seen some wild

bunnies in real life I do have some

photos of them

not that there is anything on the garden

North

there probably

this means um deers coming seriously

[Music]

foreign

so

it's some it's mostly

we call it roll years

Orange

the Swedish word for Road there is

and and I assume a row and raw are

commits

foreign

however a robot can also mean raw this

is a raw animal

is

which I guess technically all wild

animals are raw and let's see

but yeah it probably means something

else not saying in a nursing raw anymore

foreign

and a wild animal is not cooked so it's

raw

I mean it's nothing wrong is it

of course yeah

raw animal wouldn't be really you it

would be a rot to you it's personal

okay

foreign

[Music]

what is the

what is

[Music]

oh

no it's

[Music]

so it's just the oh word for word there

oh yeah with the old very old meaning of

being spotted or Street

so it's been basically based on their

fur pattern they would be basically

called

potted or Street

that has evolved into

the meaning of there

but in Swedish would put animals onto it

for some reason

[Music]

not sure why they were there wasn't put

on it like in English how it's wrote

here

instead of raw animals

oh well sometimes

sometimes it's like that

[Music]

English is weird I mean English makes

sense in this case the Swedish is the

weird one

he's a specific species of DNA

and learning with everything yes I'll

teach you Swedish

while rain there in Swedish is just

at the moment

similarly to Rua

that it's referring to a specific type

of

the year but for some reason while

English put there on both of them in

Swedish one of them and let the other

one just me as it is

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

I have eaten reindeer

I my pants but I can't remember

being from Sweden it kind of makes sense

but that's mostly up north

where they have the reindeer Farms

[Music]

I had had it when I went to Alaska

that makes sense

yeah if I ever turn into like

Lapland

this would probably be a thing like you

do up there just

eat

reindeer

here yes salmon and yeah

perfect

foreign

[Music]

noise here

mostly like

that might just be me but it's mostly

associated with Norway

[Music]

I mean considering nobody has the ghost

it kind of I guess makes sense

[Music]

okay

I need to turn it into corner

let's split the line

and I can delete points understand

weird

[Music]

I mean I can't do this

[Music]

at least

investment

yeah but I can't do this which is a bit

easy

everyone

and that's about to Salisbury

so much mean

it's a bunny with wings

[Music]

[Music]

and the reason why he has wings is

because

that was what they had back in the day

there's no there's no actual backstory

to the wings

foreign

[Music]

I haven't seen him fly

[Music]

I haven't heard him talk about flying

seven I mean logically speaking he

should be equity

um but or should I delete it online

give me this line

[Music]

thank you

you have never asked him about his snore

I have seen him in the Africa

upside down

yeah that's

that's fair

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

let me check me

[Music]

if I want to meet the messaging

what is nice

[Music]

anyway yeah I would post results in the

dream

whatever friends name again

it's been a bit silly in these things

it's showing

happy cute

that

yes okay go go say that theme

hello hello

yeah

I'll join you I know someone who is

super cute

I mean I of course of course

I understand what the band is obviously

not the cutest button

is already reserved

hello probably

I said hello

emoticent but yeah that would be the

representation of

the

but yeah that should draw you at first

summer

[Music]

if

I mean and I mean I would do

it you know

like if you want

more like I offered

I didn't know what I'm saying

I didn't know what I said

more like if you need a

purse he's a piano what do you think

it

yeah

yeah like you can have an on-screen

Avatar

would they not not any stream CD

because you're obviously in a stream

[Music]

and then you can have a cat a cute cat

[Music]

every now and then I might swim yeah as

long as you let me know

you have been streaming in the past and

random intervals but you never told me

the sun is uh one day I'm just looking

for a stream and then I'll see you

stream

well I guess I'll enjoy it

thank you

[Music]

but it will be great with a certain

someone else there

if I make you

a

sponsoring character for you to have

in exchange for some

compensation for my time that was a

weird boyfriend

[Music]

if I could do it

[Music]

what happened is angry

he has not seen such

ridiculousness

you dark creatures are not allowed to

hurt this cute bunny

laughs

she's too cute

let me put it in a different layer

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

face down

[Music]

I've been doing great things

the channel is a Bitcoin to be fair

let's buy watches

at the moment

yeah I'm basically added to the screen

in here

functions like

the local time here so you can see how

late I'm streaming which is not late at

the moment

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

just thinking about something

new

yes

there's

thinking about how you want to

make your cat I should draw your cat

after so the current plan is

well I have obviously complete this then

I will at least

plan like sketch out the shadow

creatures even if I don't

really draw them

and then I can

[Music]

so it's easier to determine

everything of course every character is

going to be a separate layer so I can

move everyone around as needed

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

what you want to do in the picture

[Music]

oh yes writing down ideas that's good

[Music]

and I was thinking about something

[Music]

oh you're so cute

[Music]

yeah when I start streaming I think

I'm waiting for the first message from

kitten

[Music]

but speaking of people in

first message from people I guess

[Music]

first showed up on an art stream said he

was busy today I think and same same as

what the bunny is going to be seeing all

the years but

thank you you're welcome

sadly they cannot show up

but they might both be able to show up

tomorrow

and I hope to finish

this today I made good progress so far

so

[Music]

so I might be able to

look at that beautiful

[Music]

nice that I said

I don't even know how to explain it

[Music]

all right

uh

[Music]

the beginning

okay there we go coffee

[Music]

and this this is that very often

[Music]

doesn't have much for uh

[Music]

let's make the price they're wearing

some

[Music]

oh

[Music]

[Music]

it's starting to look good

how about this

I usually but usually I did think about

you and making sure you're doing great

yeah that's nice

I

situation has become bad

since

[Music]

since you've shown up

I'm very thankful for that

[Music]

actually hit me

I'm dropping tablets this this dress is

a bit

music

and sometimes because I'm using a laptop

it's basically taking a lot of space for

Detroit tablets I have the drawing

tablet in my lab I'm not sure if that's

a good kid or not

um

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

oh

[Music]

hey

kicks around the corner a little bit of

Starbucks

with caramel and vanilla that sounds

like a very fancy drink you got there I

bet you thought you had Seen the Last of

Me

[Music]

there you go that's my second day

and

you know

I'm very happy

always happy

and today it is more art

[Music]

to finish and to finish the community

right now it won't be finished anytime

soon

[Music]

as active members of the community can

get free to be included

if they want to

[Music]

there is no requirement

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

questions

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

though

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

it's fine

wait why did that not break

in my subscription and

while I was streaming

that's the possibility

yeah I must have ended during the stream

oh well that's a shame

[Music]

it happens

[Music]

yeah you have to send it just

just the two if you wanted to stop here

correctly so you send it emails first

and then you write your text yeah yeah

that looks like a normal

yeah I don't like her which adds spaces

between Nemo all they have to do is

like I understand why but

all they have to do is

make sure that each emotes

uh starts with that Cola and ends with a

colon just like on

it's good this chord allows you to not

have space it

you can add spaces if you want to but

you don't need tomatoes

when I'm going to be ceiling check now

you're perfectly fine to PC anyways

we're here to be silly there's no ruling

against being silly as far as I know

yeah

and for they like to chat

etiquette

regarding like spamming or something

like that you know and you might have

seen that one user specifically penny

likes to do the pyramids and as long as

no one's actually trying to have a

conversation that's perfectly fine

so if you just want to post random

emotes

and as long as no one's trying to like

hey

chat it's perfectly fine

is

there so it's okay meow

the uh

so yeah

just

there are no Dutch

Audrey's regarding that it's it's it's

mostly based on bikini like what what

means right

[Music]

laughing Fox

y

is it kind of

nectarine and then there's the big key

you know

you could have that guy listening

how are you doing how am I doing what

foreign

things

I'm

I'm not excited to show what's what do

you mean what do you mean

they are Circle things

she made them so fast

but he

uh

yeah kids

I like expensive

I just

I made one and can basically duplicate

them I said that I wasn't going to

duplicate but I think it's very

difficulties

but I want to I avoid like

copy all the lines

and things like that I want every line

to be

drawn individually

that that one really should be animated

[Music]

oh

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

oh

[Music]

and that one's loading

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

let's remember it's 46 000 followers

and a second Channel even

with only hit three and a half Stars

since quite the defense

what's the point with the second Channel

it's not like you can stream on both at

the same time

[Music]

oh my God

I don't know maybe there's different

things on both channels

you might just want to follow

one of the things

yes that's fine

[Music]

you will get there too

that

my brain would overload

[Music]

I wouldn't I don't know if I would be

able to keep up with the chat with that

okay

foreign

[Music]

why I personally don't prefer watching

bigger streamers

and because it's more fun being able to

eat and that's basically why I'm

twitching the first place to interact

with these dreamers

and

[Music]

to pick this basically less interaction

per using

okay I guess more after this by and

watching some of my streaming

and Spanish needs help so

thanks babe

all right

that's your grace on that channel at

times

[Music]

it probably needs a slow-mo mode I love

kids

[Music]

slow slow remote is so bad on Twitch so

[Music]

[Music]

happy folks

but the foxes are very cute

[Music]

all right this is

supposed to be quantum

[Music]

boom

I didn't draw these

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

the feet without human beings

feet without beans

this is a reminder to everyone out there

I've seen some

Remus having like

dummy the beans show me the goods

good stuff it should be like show me the

beans and then the summer and teams that

and then that show might be in less

hands feet

[Music]

hair beans

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I'm sorry why you didn't finish it's not

your fault I don't think you pin it yeah

no it that was me

thank you

foreign

[Music]

Beach

[Music]

now I just cut this off

he got no shoes or socks it's just

perfect

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

punch

oh you

can make

it yeah it's like basically like a face

the face left to do

I guess this should be a licking and

licking phone

fun licking something

yeah wait here is one are you subscribed

to uh

[Music]

I'm not it's a

I'll have to

manually get all day

and then you can use the choose an email

to unlock unlike this one

there we go

and now I can use it here

[Music]

but I don't have

a leaking emote

so and then I should have checked if I

even could and I got a big this channel

[Music]

is it the uh

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I got kids

it's leaking

and should we call them give me one

minute

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

yeah they if you're not subscribed and

you have to go to channel unlock it

then they are basically the first thing

unlocked which end points and then you

have the rest of the channels in some

random model which I don't know which

order they are

you don't seem to be up that Glory

so okay first you got most used then you

got online with some points then you got

the current stream eh

and then they are just in some random

motion

like this channel I think I got a

subscription from last and it's at the

bottom

in that case you might think yeah

shouldn't they've been in order

the top one is the one that runs out to

their earnest

no because that one

pretty sure I got that one now

now that doesn't seem right I think

I don't know what you wanted to come in

just somewhere around the morning

I'm subscribed but it's something from

the bottom

right now

that face

one day I wanted to support her strings

by paying for my own subscription

so nice and friendly and happy and

nice and friendly

a surface weird like how

foreign

[Music]

I got you again

[Music]

[Music]

you did hang a bit one day

Maybe

foreign

[Music]

Spanish

[Music]

yeah the words are different in those

legs are pretty sure there's like some

like some really nice

[Music]

you know what

take my knife

[Music]

excuse that knife

and something that's you're meant to cut

foreign

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

with me

foreign

but otherwise it looks like yeah make

this one shorter

otherwise I think I got everything

yeah there's other

oh

this seems like a good idea for me to

take a very very very short

French

and when you enjoy it is crying

a bathroom break more specifically I

will park in there

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

um

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

you were one of the early followers

well I don't think I missed a single

line so I think this is done

now

I should do the

[Music]

air

you scared me everything when I said

she jumped through the roof

and made a big cone

or when I say the resistance that could

also be one of the moon now you said you

said the vixi dead input yes I got

scared

and I don't exactly know what you need

for anything

so

First Step let's just double check to

this this area skinny quick

it seems to do that quickly it

nope

[Music]

and

I think that's something feeling

the body

yeah then

friends I know

yeah here we see some pieces

[Music]

thank you

That's my kind of feeling is it fits

around this little thought

yeah I really wish it could take into

the consideration yeah thinner lines

like the action

like

but I can't do

you know that's now

yeah it needs to be more intentioned

with feeling

it's nice

but mostly

they look perfectly

exactly I will try that now

but now okay now that's it yeah yeah

parking a chicken

hi hello what do you mean

with you

this is an interesting art style

be honest

that sounds great

order because

this celebration our response that's I

didn't

ever have I'm happy

doing a proper proper celebration

sleep maybe not sleep but I will eat

something and then I will work on stuff
