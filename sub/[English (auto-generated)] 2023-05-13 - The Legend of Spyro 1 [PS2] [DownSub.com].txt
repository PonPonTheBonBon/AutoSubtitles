foreign

[Music]

I have to

do

brush through this opening sequence I do

have options to skip cut since this one

let's keep the cutscenes and

I don't know sometimes I can skip

cutscenes what's the matter though it's

like when he starts speaking something

he's a bit weird

I must be tough to lose all the time

yeah it takes a bit of time before you

can start cut scenes for some reason

welcome

pretty

right in the chat if you want to do I

have to fight this can I just move on

I don't get any

experience from these just yet

there's not even

experience option

all right

I guess I'm just speed running this

button

[Music]

yeah I guess I didn't have to fight this

laughs

yeah I'm not getting nothing Friday so

[Music]

I should remember cities yeah it does

Justin

music scanner

you want more music

that's me

[Music]

wow

[Music]

yeah basically

next

I think that's the let me out of here

thing what

[Music]

happened

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

get me out of here Spyro I think my

you breathe fire so I'm just about ready

to blow

you have to wait a few seconds before

you can skip to get scene

I guess like accidentally not skipping

attack scene protection or something so

hard as it was uh so it's got a one this

KitKat scenes and not like it

cross triangle or something

yeah I guess okay now I have the level

up option here but I don't think

because now I have the thing before but

I don't get anything for fighting this

so

nothing

can't just move on

let's

this is actually making it a quickie

missing the job

because

it's a bit of a lip they're making

spiral so uh me and the old man were

chatting and this

is

I don't remember when you start getting

yeah

it must be often yeah gems

did I have to fight this

[Music]

yep

[Music]

can I just move on

I'm not against this

up after the video

or something

wow

[Music]

let's break here

our animal cells

[Music]

[Music]

come here we go

you know they open up there so I can

proceed

no way please come wait can I proceed

that Amway

yeah straight Stitch nice you know but I

don't care

I have a dragon to find

all right thank you for sure I would

realize but it's really dark this game

is so dark

[Music]

it does not Escape

wow

I guess overall Maybe

or assistant

I can make it a bit brighter

it's a bit easier to watch I guess

it sounds like a good idea I think

so let me add the color correction

and then adjust

just increase the gamma a bit like this

so

and then adjust it

as needed

okay somewhere

here I should start getting power up

when I should start carrying out

quickly

nothing

hey when in doubt

[Music]

I don't want to fight you

[Music]

because yeah I don't get 11 from

that so there's no point of fighting it

[Music]

all right

[Music]

yes I just love this thing

[Music]

okay so I still have to hide this

[Applause]

ignite is come here and help me by being

attacked

[Music]

all right

[Music]

I think that was a single

now the door can open

well look at that

okay

hey spiral what was that about I don't

really know

in that case

yes thank you for blowing up

[Music]

wow

I saw how to push these things sometimes

yeah it was another one

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

I can't see their friends

[Music]

what's up

hey there's a signal

because I supposed to do that

continuously level perhaps

you were supposed to live I did the same

thing again

foreign

so when I get into this

first exam clams collected the blue jay

okay now I get the

and this is apparently the most

important message in the game I I guess

but this is

[Music]

[Applause]

still really dark

this is running

and

focus on at least

wow all of us remember anyone

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

this doesn't count as cutscene

yes we could check how much yeah so

you're gonna leave probably not

foreign

[Music]

oh

yeah

ignite this

I can upgrade

should I maybe I should focus

[Music]

and maybe it's supposed to be too much

[Music]

[Music]

it's not a half healthy pad and whatnot

okay

all right

[Music]

[Music]

okay

[Music]

welcoming night is

foreign

[Music]

[Applause]

thank you

[Music]

talk about

oh he's walking I have to wait for him

can I ride on you

into the fighting torture

[Music]

and you seem to address the ability to

breathe fire on your own that's very

impressive and um

I mean the fighting Dojo you have

infinite breaths about

that which doesn't make sense again very

good young smoothness makes sense

what's the point of time practice damage

if I can't

level up

[Music]

foreign

my hopes once more

I'm glad I did

come over here Spyro Yuma

training is just getting started

over here knocking enemies

thank you

wow I actually won awesome why didn't

you sit by

this way home purple energy

[Music]

you did it

and now it's time to move on

Spyro come here let us continue

[Music]

that's it that's it

I don't get it come over here let's try

another

I tell the folks about this

over here

I shouldn't trust that number I could

just as well have three watches

that's what a motivated yeah this isn't

like the slow part of the game this way

oh Marv one an off-balanced enemy

foreign

[Music]

now you're ready to proceed

if you can successfully knock an enemy

back into it I can't even see if it was

a strike

hey this attack

[Music]

um

three of them

Spyro you have taken tremendous Strife

okay now I get the

yeah

let me see I can upgrade

can I be in now yes

after the activated and I'm still in the

training phase wait did I get there

nah

I knew you had it in you Spyro

my distance now

this should be a bit easier to knock

this now since I have updated it

you have so much thoughts

thank you

so far so good

now for the real challenge

challenge I mean

this way oh mauve one yeah yeah you have

demonstrated the ability to

so now time to use the

I am firing here I see

actually

[Music]

if you might have a chance against

Cinder yet

oh you can't skip this as well nice

because this is what I want to watch

yep that's givable

I haven't eaten anything so if you mind

if you don't mind I would actually go

prepare to eat something

I don't know how long it will take but I

will be back

very shortly that way so much it's not

working or something

[Music]

so what's with the poor big guy

if you must know certain things you have

the ability to see visions

the thoughts memories and dreams of

them to see what's happening in places

far far away

I am one such dragon

and in this pool the Visions come forth

oh really is that so okay what am I

thinking now

what am I thinking now

okay now now now now now

I'm afraid it's not that easy Sparks it

takes time reflection and patience

what I do see in the pool of Visions is

that voltia one of the Guardians is

being held on Dante's freezer

spider while I look for details on the

others I want you to venture there and

find out what you can

remember just look around

if you encounter Cinder who run you're

not ready to face her yet

okay so when people are trying to kill

me I run got it

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

oh am I back it's a drink

Mercy King Frozen

seriously

yeah the game is serious yeah it's true

well

luckily the game want to save so

pretty easy for me to restart the game

I need to switch

of course this would show the HDMI

I don't know what this capture card is

an old capture card no longer supported

and stuff

it does have a software update

but for me to get that software update I

have to

does it count that I completed hopefully

save that

to get the software updates I need the

the

key for the product would put due to the

product being so old I have no idea why

where I have this key it's somewhere

and I don't know why they do that I mean

fully understand why you have keys for

oh so I have to redo

that part and it's good that the tears

respawn and that plays with it opponents

kills it

didn't have to say when you shoot

when worst case

I might be able to find

the software update

um through another source I mean because

I do have the capture card

like shouldn't have been enough proof

that

I have it because

I as which I tried to say was I fully

understand like other kinds of software

why

video games would have a key

because this software is let's see

but it doesn't matter if you put pirate

the capture card software you're not

going to be able to use

the software because you don't have a

caption card

it doesn't make any sense

but now I have to redo the whole

[Music]

Dodger part just because the game

decided to freeze

bye

this game is so terrible

[Music]

you seem to have learned the ability to

breathe fire on your own

that's

very good young Spyro

Spyro come here this time see

this part

which I managed to succeed their first

attempt last time

begins

okay it's one left

let's let's mark the three igniters to

have Legends of fire controls

it was so hard to catch those XC for

that point

oh you awaken my hopes once more

come over here Spyro you must learn

well done framing is just getting

started

over here

knocking enemies up into the air allows

many opportunities

[Music]

wow I actually won awesome

this way oh Marv one let us see

thank you

you did it

I know it's time that's our squares uh

you actually

do you get this power as soon as you

enter the Georgia or some point

sounds like you have to wait

let us continue

that's the wrong attack

that's it that's it

come over here

let's try another

one wait till I tell the folks about

this

over here conserve your energy

that's why a motivated Dragon could do

this way oh Marv one an off-balanced

enemy can be very

just place it

[Music]

foreign

let's see if you can successfully

oh strikes succeeded

done yet

Spyro you have taken tremendous strap

all right and then this first Fireball

thing

[Music]

I knew you had it in you Spyro

over here now let's mix it up

foreign

so good

now for the real challenge

guys okay

thank you

foreign

that can't

I don't know if that counts

yeah and the constellation set the

summertime because apparently

PlayStation 3 doesn't have a summertime

a nice nice map beat That pictures

there we go

one pixel off left last time

happened that wasn't visible

foreign

let me skip these cutscenes because

apparently

it's got stuck and that's one last time

but not any time before that

this is weird

yeah that how this works

okay this is

why that made their feelings uh

with the Arctic ring for the light to

Green

I can see it on the health where you

have

when you take damage

it becomes

it has

Paramount quickly they have a jumps down

immediately or how much times you have

taken and then you have the red that

China you'll see how much damage you

took

and then it turns down

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

which is but I'm not sure why the energy

featured has the same

does an animation doesn't do it because

it shrinks

doesn't leave the dark green behind her

it's ourselves

[Music]

[Applause]

experience by from this

nope nothing

[Applause]

okay so when it fills up that parking is

actually almost a team Fab

that's why I use it up quickly then the

light green is what I didn't have I

thought it was just being trying to be

quickly

yes

I am confused

when I use this

powerful immediately

when it's finished

there's that

should we have a little prediction

apparently I cannot because

this one faded loud as well

okay let's see if I can have a

prediction

Dante's Frieza is a desolator Arctic

expense that slitted with the Machinery

of

is it weird that that blanked at me just

keep okay uh

and then I set the prediction to

longest time 30 minutes I probably

don't reach the Ice King within that

time and now I guess you can

um

Fighters

come on

this [ __ ] did that trigger the catapult

[Music]

I guess it did

this Bible starts everything

[Music]

that was a good idea

glad I thought of it

you're glad you no

ah

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

within reason

I can't die from the fall

a very weak

but no secrets

[Music]

no secrets in this game

[Music]

wow

but I want this to eat without using

catapult

[Music]

okay it's kind of hearing

[Music]

like is it a flaming Theory

fire Fury

United

[Applause]

okay let's see

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

here we go

[Music]

found it

like something heavy

and then it was just the oof of smoke

okay there's that camera again I want

that power

all right

[Music]

I want the ice power

hey I want my wrist don't go away from

me

so many

with so many of these breaks

and

none of the strange ones

[Music]

[Music]

no weapons for you but I don't need

snowballs perfectly shaped symbols

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

seven explosion

[Music]

I did shoot I think okay

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

you have done the electric screen breath

okay

[Music]

so

let's spend the line

up

that's all I get from two enemies

but probably

thank you

foreign

oh

there we go and after that that's all I

got

thank you

I'm breaking breakings we have toes

it's very cute

let's see

yeah I don't get much

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

oh

man

but no not you

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

two of them at the same time

[Music]

come here

get around

that jump and Dodge is the same button

why is my own sleep I'm fine

okay

okay

he's dizzy

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

wait

yeah I said something was wrong with

that

that was being orange is the red

[Music]

[Music]

I'm trying

yeah I'm not going to give up yet

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

the how about like if I press jump how

about actually doing a jump

like

yeah I like that do that that shouldn't

stand hard jump attack watch

out touch

can't touch okay

what she said to deal with

I got to follow I don't need to be here

why are you destroying your own face

activate you if this is your own place

but

[Music]

you have it right now

thank you

so is this completely transpire tomorrow

[Music]

this is duck's life as you can see

[Music]

yeah I have no idea what that dog's life

doesn't even stop

s

this is

so yeah

no don't start

now life of the dog

come here

I'm not finished with you

[Music]

I'm going to run away again

[Music]

you know I'm

I've been tricked now

just to the side of the bridge

you know what's this

[Music]

now you'd hit

yep look at that beautiful prediction

you're afraid to predict do you feel

like this missing a person is

[Music]

[Music]

dead

seven minutes left on the prediction

ready

I'm ready but

I don't know let me give me a minute or

less than a minute preferably

because

I discard on the phone is terrible

is it just me or the other people that

we see it like if I set this code in the

background and then open it up

it uh

loads indefinitely

but if I then was close it and then open

it again it works perfectly fine

so

uh I got the message since and uh let's

continue

[Music]

design no dog's name today I get out of

them

and as it is but it's annoying

very annoying

well there's a mighty flame I couldn't

deserve my Flame

[Music]

foreign

again that's

my gems

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

points

[Music]

[Applause]

see it does make sense

foreign

forgot to do that

this is

yeah I should have said something

yeah I'm basically gonna be doing this

part now I have the experience in this

practice

[Music]

I got everything good

[Music]

good

it's three minutes left on the

prediction what do you think how easy

would I do the Ice King this time

is that right there asking

attempted defeat Ice King

no no one has predicted anything so far

of course don't feel pressured

okay don't move me with your snooze

these elements are pretty simple so

okay

[Music]

it's weird how little damage centers

like

it's such a time to live a Charged Up

no it's not

oh

between the animation is slow

but

anybody damage them

nude poop live prediction because

a blind prediction because I do not know

what to expect for this Ice King

uh it's the first bus I defeated tried

to fight last time but maybe you weren't

that I mean that's kind of the

I mean it is part it is a part of line

okay

and you wanted to do something with

General Point said

there you go that's something

okay carrot points

oh

I don't need to keep that

[Music]

matching no it's not changing

it so I don't have any Twisters

so that's one of them

was that a rat flying across the screen

thank you

I wasn't here during that fight yeah

that would be more fun

but I feel better knowing you beating

him the other day yeah I have done that

and pumpkin do it

but as my tradition has been so far

because there is only a single person

who has predicted

the

prediction is canceled unless you want

to try again

because it was only

because it was canceled that they didn't

can we do it again yeah I'll do it again

we need at least two different answers

okay

attempts to defeat

the eye King

this is bus one

single attempt

due to four attempts more than the four

attempts which is

really Spell attempts attempts

there you go

I don't know

another 30 minutes I don't know how long

how long will it take before I reach the

Ice King

yeah

each one you pick

no but

no no it's expanded Penny's so nice I

tried to be nice and kind

so again this prediction system if you

don't know

or I guess even if you do know

but once more detail regarding it

All In

okay you might still have to know on

this prediction system works because

yeah you don't like you don't get your

checkpoints times three or something if

you win

what it does is that it takes all the

challenge points that have been

predicted with

Gathering them up in a single pot

but currently we have a ten thousand

and

I guess it doesn't take that much during

that time

I try to touch

and winner gets the part exactly

you know how it works doesn't mean

everyone else has to work

[Music]

I'm not insane because we do have

at least one watcher

has not predicted

yeah

and when he gets upon pots I bet there's

one more rule

yeah if you and then it looks at

make it a good icing yeah yeah

and and then it looks at the people of

the winning option and the proportions

they have activated within it and then

you win the whole pot based on that

precaution

so if you're a single one and get

everything of course

then we are in here okay

so that's how it works so I was

prediction is the best when you have

multiple people of course

multiple people on the same position

because if you're alone you only have to

predict a single point

why don't you do that from behind

what the style on me

[Applause]

thank you

[Music]

okay he actually hit me

thank you

and then he killed me

[Music]

our enemies recently get all their house

back

it makes sense I mean I get to all my

health back

there you go

time to shut this up more

oops too many

not that one over because it's fun

uh yeah

I

can open

a minute

wow

you can't open the nuts oh wait there

you are

come down from there

yeah thank you

such a big explosion but so little

damage

a nice projectile and nice multiple

enemies

[Music]

thank you

anime

17 000 cares

yeah we need another person joining in

someone should say send a link in the

server and said that it's prediction

time

foreign

[Music]

yeah

I mean it wasn't a direct hit

that wasn't okay

another one of these

no secrets

right a very strong fences

[Music]

thank you

I'm attacking damage

and here we go

find anyone don't see anything

[Music]

miles from there

look

[Music]

I'll test anymore

the camera series I can see him

balance twisting

about just like twice the damage did I

get the same amount

or some men noodle

what

what

is that away

let's track you then joke yeah I give

you this track it down

right

just because you've got something

something doesn't make it a bad thing

pleasure Forest people think to me

like a

um

like for example

here we stay positive and respectful

but I do like actually quite stuff too

that wasn't a

[Music]

um

let's do it

let me out let me out

okay this is what the floor again I'll

just keep forgiving

here we go he's cutscene

so again

I forgot about that

they don't even actually don't drop

enemies

maybe they never drop enemies it's just

that

usually when they drop them and miss you

up

so I made the connection myself

I could be wrong

that's really good

[Music]

how are you protecting yourself

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

yes I am

so on the so far I don't think it's I

made us

one of my favorites soups

I made amazing to the chat

if you have a name with a capital letter

in the middle it will treat biasis of

the heart and inside the space in front

of me it's making it easy to read I

guess

it's just very slightly change

[Music]

[Music]

stop surrounding me

I don't like that

[Music]

was

so smart

and none of you have

why do you attack your own seed enemies

come out of times I'm not seeing from

right

foreign

[Music]

get back

[Music]

come here come here

put this one

[Music]

goodbye this one

foreign

[Music]

there we go

or did something else die

I guess it's

a far long way down

yeah styling

[Music]

yeah I do get it it takes about your

arms

all right

[Music]

this is

[Music]

something cuts off

thank you

[Music]

yeah regardless of what people have

predicted I would of course give my best

try to go for one attempt

of course

but that doesn't mean I would be

successful

that's

yeah I need to

use properly now

okay

finally

[Music]

bye

[Music]

all right I hit you

not anything all right

lightest amount of Health left

well now it's more exciting because now

TP plus voted

are we getting close to the Ice King now

yeah I am actually

[Music]

I don't know

I didn't seem to shrink anything

okay so it seems like you can get it on

behind the next day it just doesn't show

without me

it's about me to show it as well happy

for the wrong number sometimes it really

depends on what it is but

I don't know I just can't make it

okay this is the Ice King I'm here too

early

hey that's him we did it bye

I don't like this it's too quiet too

easy

what part was easy getting chased by

Frozen Mad Men and gorillas

ah

[Music]

well

as far as I know you can't change your

prediction

but it doesn't look like anyone is going

to and then more predictions anyway so

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

oh

yeah

[Music]

but I'm doing messing up

and I'm translating so much

[Music]

all right

[Music]

[Music]

it's just being here

you don't need to remember that

okay

thank you

okay phase one

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

okay I stuck in here at the moment

[Music]

wait from Dirty

[Music]

oh

[Music]

we'll count

yeah the plants it doesn't match

it is meant for a group of animals in

your life

[Music]

there we go

technically it's Timeless

oh wait I can actually

cancel the

timers incredible stupendous a dragon

your size defeating that thing well

there was two attempt we can confirm

that was to attempt

because at that time how many times do I

run I died once meaning that was the

second attempt

thank you

yes yes

my description was a bit unclear I could

have said more like how many times would

I die or something

because when you die you make another

attempt and you skip

continue from the face you died on

oh no

three to four attempts

all 13

000 points

goes to oremian

that is original one four thousand

congratulations

let me know if there's anything else you

want information on we didn't we need

asset to be more people to make it more

fun

I mean I did I did do my best

last

base I guess I must be too aggressive

electricity the spark of life I could

have been more careful actually do it in

one of them but I guess that would have

been as fun either because

or just hydrated

I can hide it again hydrate

you're going to use your points now

yeah I don't know why

I have to wait for that thing to move

down that's the worst process game

right back home

put

why is this one broken

yes start a new one

it doesn't let me start a new one

I've seen a recently changed option

there yeah let's go with the same option

then

yeah I'll pop this out then

be like this okay now

now I can do it

so

what do you say

how many attempts

of the boat

voyage

I don't know if you don't go with deaths

instead

let's hear that how many times

maybe all right all right on the boat

voyage

here it is

perfect run

I want to see this this is it so

or plus this so it's the same option

still but I should have used deaths in

the first one to make it clear

yep

this time

hopefully someone else could join in too

but it post a link

on the server

[Music]

of course most

a lot of fun to use but

and I'll see you again

watching of course

another kitten went all in Meridian said

anyone coming so

okay this time I remember that thing

it's the first let's be like this then

laughs

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

you're still

okay

don't come forget about that

[Music]

[Music]

oh he's captured

[Music]

I mean

of curiosity

that was wrong but I guess it worked

no I didn't mean to jump down

what happens if I wouldn't say him

win

because you don't continue that part

[Music]

I meant to press this first

I shouldn't stand

next to the snow because yep it shoots

oh yeah I can't continue it's a stone

wall

every every

scene with Kane is in

I was just trying to help world yet

what did they want with you anyway it's

none of your business now move I've got

a tribe to save

oh you're welcome

yeah anyway yeah having a difference

that seems for every time

this can't seem more damage not be

different because this will only play

no no no no no no no

time time you sex player

research language

it's okay we can try again

it's okay yeah

the love in the volume

for my

20s

okay let's let's do this

[Music]

special

[Music]

can you guys fall down

I just died that works too

[Music]

yep

okay I think this is part of where I

showed up last time

and I think now I think I got this last

time actually

it came

[Music]

and now this wall is gone so I can come

in here

and then these

things show up which doesn't like fire

[Applause]

easily buy some Wi-Fi which is nice

so I can easily pick them up

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

am I kidding apart from that

now you're dead

[Music]

there's probably so many of these

come and find me personally

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

best name

is on fire

is on fire for sure

[Music]

yeah let's write down my every single

name

yeah

last time I didn't press this one

I think I just went on this one

then I

maybe I did you started

oh

hey

it's 10 radius is so terrible

I'm still used to

the other spider games

[Music]

because I don't feel like he's

planting

browsering

[Music]

s and his Grand thing it doesn't sound

like the same character

[Music]

anyway

[Music]

[Music]

that's easy

let me pick up some chance from this

channel

[Music]

down the Bell leader or is it a dollar

okay no don't knock me down

one thing you should

that Shockwave

all of us gets me

wait with seed is that you're not good

I did why did I respond all the way back

here

all the way back there that was a bit

weird

beautiful beautifully done a Canada made

it better myself I made aside from

succeeded before but uh

aside from that okay

[Music]

how many times do you take to get over

that thing

[Music]

oh okay

with you

stop eating me

why did you

you fell down and died they surely not

survive and fall damage much

uh and then there's that Temple thingy

and the spiral thingy doesn't remember

which one you came in I think the spiral

came off to the temple

and I'm sure it was a temple

it was breeches too

is this the place where the bridge is

very easy to make up

because this looks like an open air yeah

yeah this was the place with the bridge

is

[Music]

saved the first of the bridge I forgot

about the safety

type

as far as I could tell from that moment

that just happened there when a gem is

about to fall off the world it

a jacket

dang it that's how we deal with it

one no problem

there are more than one that's the

problem

okay this is the part I remember

yeah it's like you probably remember the

Aesthetics of this lemon

[Applause]

Parts where you probably shouldn't

[Music]

they could have easily put like

because they have flame men charge and

then they also have the right button now

we're supposed to move on there was

nothing

yeah this was the spiral thing

because when I go through here it gets

attacked yeah they close the entrance

and exit even there is no point of

closing the entrance

there's nothing to go

so here's the spiral

okay

Yep this is why I showed up saying Neo

spots which is surprised in Polish which

I think you can start

because I don't rinse polish

[Applause]

it might come as a surprise I don't

think it's polish

I don't speak Polish

and if you do want to use your points

for something that's all set having an

interesting

Swedish

if you want to hear me speak Swedish

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

pumpkin is so smart smart or watch it

now in two languages

like most people know the two languages

and it's like the average

[Music]

yeah I think I think most comments no

explanation there are also a lot of

people known three languages but I

I don't know what to write

[Music]

um

that's like his face that's friends like

that

I don't know what to wear

which would be I don't know what I

should write

but it's basically the same

[Music]

time

now I can approve the redeems

immediately

[Music]

you could of course also say yeah

indefinite pronoun

I'm really funny down now

which put me in like

it's there I don't know what to write

in the more

[Music]

it you could translate it more like

I don't know what you you're supposed to

write

which is the English equivalent of the

generic

yeah indefinition

[Music]

which is referring to oneself still

producing from you

that was a weird way

you polish yummy

VM Taco top

research

that's

a second

I'm learning so much about languages

yeah this is the language place

if you want to learn about language this

is the place

can I ask me anything

and I myself

another strong history

this is a language school no oh I wanted

to go up again

[Music]

well I'm not teaching your language

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

unless you do something like

okay that happened

the Swedish word for cat is Cat

and yeah

and it's very obvious related to enjoy

the cat

I'm Swedish like

most languages is a gendered language

gendered is often misunderstood but

if you want to know

music could be just

just gendered is a thing that is very

often misunderstood if you want to know

more about like gender I mean

YouTube no languages but

foreign

[Music]

okay

distracted oh no why didn't they do

anything

stop it

ready

[Music]

um

his turn radius

as the deadline point is that he stops

running all of a sudden

I think that's the worst part we would

still like

playing with legend of the and plenty of

spiders spiders in real life would still

be an interesting challenge having the

exactly know like the jump and jump

it's Harper's light distance the charge

which I can't barely turned and as soon

as it runs over a little bump it goes

flying

he can't climb and walk and his flame is

kind of big but he will he can play for

quite a while because this is too much

so maybe it should be inspiring that is

not updated

[Music]

do something

yes

[Music]

thank you

sorry Spyro you're stupid yeah sometimes

stupid

at least this time you were out of the

plane that's our city you can get ran

out of the flame

[Music]

and you have to kill enemies to get back

in your face

[Music]

it will be kind of

kind of interesting mob with a lot of

work though

polish announce that end in a constant

tend to be masculine ends in or or

and it's neutered ah or

I was only writing the Polish

translation what you said earlier

[Music]

because I think the biggest

misconception about gender in language

is that

what is is that why why would why would

the mark and announce as feminine as

being women like and man like or

something like that that's not how it

works

in actuality

it is that

and nouns have different ways of

inflecting themselves and other words

around them

and when they do it in the same way as

the masculine words that's when these

words are considered masculinity aren't

masculine

there's Cloud masculine for the sake of

simplicity

but

but a table is neither feminine or a

masculine any of these languages and

people who speak this language just

don't consider table to be either

feminine or masculine

it just that's just how it's impacts

is that yeah you're a good kitten but

Swedish

but Swedish grammatical gender I don't

think there's anything about nouns that

shows what is common

no that's the case with dramatic

languages you usually cannot tell I mean

in German it's actually in German

in Swedish you completely dead

foreign

Swedish doesn't have masculine feminine

instead Swedish has a

gendered and non-gendered words

they're very hot

gendered and genderless she is for

example journalists in Swedish

but that doesn't mean I consider ships

to be gentlemen they do have gender

[Applause]

[Music]

all right

and then of course next question is why

would you even have

so like okay so the Art lesbian family

just that much they're asking a family

worse and all the masculine and all the

feminine words can match

why are those terms

[Applause]

we could just as well call them

basically class one and class two nouns

at which they do in for example Swahili

but isn't that easy to remember

yeah so in that case you also have to

determination man or woman come first

which also has quite an issue

I guess in German

you can

oops wrong button again I guess in

German you could consider them class R

plus e and plus s

and that's why I'm done

as an Arkham

I mean in that case you don't

even though e comes before r that comes

number is let's see usually people don't

usually get let this spread out to that

place like that

I still think

basically would call them Class A B and

C in that case people will see that's

right

and English is the this side is it says

it's gonna give us a gender and pain it

is interesting about English managed to

get rid of it I like other languages

that sometimes worse implies differently

because if you take Swedish which I

speak and if you have

accounts

and those usually have a plural form and

when you have a neutral noun which are

young less those tend to not have rapid

transform

like the performance the same as the

singular form

so is

which is the case in English

I think

that's just

the worst the worst just behave

differently it's just that's just the

thing

[Applause]

I don't know exactly because

maybe that's why English management kind

of

it's just not add it to the moment

in Middle English golden English

even though it's apparently it doesn't

[Music]

so yeah

[Applause]

[Applause]

[Music]

and tell him basically telling someone

to stop using your math contender

when that's

certainly been hit by left yeah speak

wrong you're basically telling people

well in that case I would like to ask

you to speak English

uh

make all the plurals the same

I don't uh don't don't use the word

cacti I used to work cactuses

or something

don't use the word

men

as clear of man is you should say say

man's instead

[Music]

yesterday

foreign

[Music]

just put some thoughts on the letter A

like man man and man

yes we shot thousands

foreign

spelling

Swedish doesn't have perfect spelling

but our dog is Swedish embarrassment in

English

Swedish has I usually say 17 vowels but

I guess it's easier to just say 18

months

nine short and line long just Swedish

wasn't Mark if it's shorter long that

could also be something that could

improve them

but Swedish at least

[Music]

Swedish at least has

um

it has at least

at nine different vowel letters

and then

it's about tend to be short when you

have a long consonant in the world can

be known when you have a shortcuts then

and long consonant is with not the

double constant between kinda determine

when it's along with your problem

in a barthic system

[Music]

it's how much

and I lost for a Swedish for spelling

and that's not sexy

thinking something all the time I'm

feeling the space here

and whereas I wouldn't mind a spelling

for English but when I come up with like

a suggestion or something like

instead of writing pH one F sound just

use the letter F because for English

has a lot of words with f what do you

spell them

and but you also have a lot of

but there's also a lot of words in

English that starts with ph you don't

mention F sound and while reading is no

problem because pH doesn't make any on

this other f

uh it is still

in order to write

because

he doesn't have long short vows in fact

polish vows are pronounce exactly like

spiders

yeah they're nice you can say yes Indore

short long rounds

yeah I'm dying it I need help

okay he scraped the wood and died

he's a weak dragon

world no spider you have to look out for

the world because he died

the base but what I was going to say was

that and people like to counter this

with saying suggesting a spelling from

Swedish

but I agree that Swedish should have

spanning forms that's not a camp day

yeah what do you think if I would

suggest us

I I would spell it changing spelling of

Swedish words imagine pronunciation so

but the thing is what makes it funnier

is that when people do

these suggestions they always always

suggest a stupid change that doesn't

make any sense or it doesn't follow a

established orthography

my suggestion of changing pH to F is an

establishing link because you write the

word behind with an F

and you can probably come up a lot of

words fantasy

yes your fantasy SpongeBob

pH

you can come up with a long list of

words without F in English

and in Swedish we tend to almost

exclusively use the letter F or F sounds

because it just makes everything easier

am I biased I guess

but having one letter

or one Spanish it doesn't have to be one

of them one spelling for sound this

makes it easier

[Music]

language stuff I don't have anything

more to add

look out Spyro for this little sticks in

my kidney dude but you can I can attack

them just fine there now wait I should

okay the eggs

let's place it on the eyes so I cannot

get it

next time or something

unless you want to hear some silly I can

only remember one silly suggestion so

I guess you need to know Swedish a bit

more before perfectly understanding

suggestion the way this is about as odd

as English with letter sounds oh cat

chicken

those kids are of pronounced differently

yes but here's the thing

Swedish does with the k sound like

English dust with a G sound which has

abstination as French does with the

scene sound it changes depending on if

it's a so-called hard or soft mouth it's

kind of if

a common terms right I don't actually

know what I have to answer so before a o

u

and sometimes it announces me you have

the hard sound and before I E

y

you have the soft sound

that's why you have

it's not

100 true because English is inconsistent

because of course it

isn't it

yeah I mean it's foreign

French

I mean English does the same sound

so

cat is pronounced with a hard K because

it is from an A

pickling is spelled with a start okay

making the chef sound instead because

it's in front of a soft round

[Music]

is because it is the ligature SK

and and including that one

and including that one I don't think

it's fine because that would be like

someone including the sh in English

again that the S doesn't make the

correct sound

it's of course doesn't do because the

age marks as of having a different sound

foreign

[Music]

there's no questioning about it

how to spell it

it's a bit weird but

very much does the same too

so yeah those words are spelled like

they are pronounced

by the PlayStation is over

I didn't keep track of

now you still have a problem

which is the both of the devil

foreign

[Music]

thing but it must have evolved from

something

else okay both because in English French

and Swedish that's probably a lot of

other languages I don't know that's the

same system but for different aspects of

course this is

what it's been kind of the same house

I think it's based on if the bow is

considered wrong or bad

are we getting a lot of information here

let's take care of

they'd like

the linguistics

Spyro and the linguistic learning

[Music]

so big

and I can proceed

and I can return home

no I think he's stupid

he's not like the other place

[Music]

then didn't let me go back even though

there's nothing to come back to

[Music]

and I guess that's

[Music]

also an idea to I just sort of something

else

through those near the doors Two Doors

is first of them for some reason so this

is the which I call the temple

I need to move those balls

for all

the idea of taking these levels and

putting them into shape like it

could be interesting running around in

this house

the battery is fire

oh Kenny skits

you again yeah me again

actually I need to press those buttons

no problem I can do that

big four with a touch of War

bye

[Music]

so many enemies

yeah let's see if he's probably looking

too many of them

whatever even

interesting noise

[Music]

why don't you run

[Music]

okay that must be easy

no don't don't fall down

yeah there's something about this I have

it up

yeah since they have Max size quite a

while

that's next level

let's put some more there okay

[Music]

I'm living here Inspire isn't the

easiest

[Music]

pain

uh he's his name is hey actually

[Music]

I don't need any help of some pain

she couldn't break free from a wooden

case and almost fell over on what

falling into this Sky I guess into the

bottom of the sky

I mean I yeah

he's he's the Sparks I assumed that

Sparks was supposed to learn but

and acting acting like Fox Stars

participate

I'm glad I can't explain this

that isn't it

fun

and it shouldn't act like that

[Music]

so far he hasn't done anything

oh that's funny straw how do I have left

that thing is lucky so there's the ball

I really thought they were like

ass or something

and another time

okay that that one didn't break these

pots that was a terrible yes

but anyway let's play some ball

oh it's the football part yeah

more like nose falling

play some ball

I'm going to eat something breakfast I

will be back

good with using this

it's not good

things part

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

it's terrorist is bad I guess you can

add straight into the wall

hello game

I need to pick up some more gems first

leave no gems bad

[Music]

soon I'm at the boat right now

that's it pretty am I

the

um

damaged

unscathed wait is it

and not damaging the belt but if you

have this prediction I should just

spy is gonna have one heck of a headache

of eating all those ones

yeah

or anything

there's not been a piece since cinder's

Force

yeah I need to open the door but I was

already on the other side

because I guess it opens during the

cutscene but yeah here we go here's the

boss voyage

I'm not sure

no now you tell me

yeah I guess I don't leave the boat on

the scale this time

I mean I could try it like another time

because I can because I can basically do

this I save a second one

and then I can go back to that one

unless I have a backup in case I'm

stepping again

you never know

so I should use that super thing on the

bad things

right now

all right don't hurt me

baby don't hurt me

yes just don't get me

venom ghost

not always

[Music]

considering I've said to repeat a scene

repeat the names and

you said twister yeah I've seen this at

Mister before but I haven't seen a name

like a silver twister

or at least are the restart finder

taste it

so it seems like all the combinations

are predetermined instead of having back

to this stuff and we fixed and stop it

and comparing to the other ones

which would have been more fun

he's very nasty

stuff

or a shot finally

more for you oh yeah

okay that was the second phase

but it's the sun when I feel that

oh Shock Me

I don't even thinking damage

no way

I don't remember

where's my

how am I supposed to take this anymore

oh and it survived with like

wow

did I hit the fire the pie shouldn't

touch me I must have that chocolate but

something went

let's write it down here

one this

so yeah everybody hit the question I had

there was if in case it ends with a no

winner we should probably just cancel

the prediction and give on contract

because I read it yeah because otherwise

all the points would just be deleted and

I read it at least someone getting the

point though in that case I would

super simple I used it to just make sure

I would win the first one

and yes you guys you can see my name is

displayed differently in the chat on

screen not too much about the chat and

put it up

put the space in front of each

and then write the V and there's nothing

and these effect on users

assuming you have any calculator

and if you want your name

or female for example if you prefer

having like the first letter Capital

let's say you can go to

put settings and adjust display name or

do that

thank you

it is fine either way

hi guys silent drum

facing line right here he's right down

on this

I want

to go second place then

a quiet cake I read that but something

else first

foreign

wow

okay stop now

it's not fun when you attack me

as soon as I come by already

thank you

I died already

that sounds like I didn't I don't want

to count that test

is that this was stupid

now I'll do it

all right

there you go

where did you go

[Music]

all right

stop attacking me

do you call me

nice

[Music]

comments

oh nah

hello hello

and R1

I think the combination is

oh Square

I'm already

square circle circle circle

he died

okay I'm just trying to see

oh yeah okay phase three let's go I

should do this cup this time

please

I left the other one

oh no continue Charlie

I want you to throw

this is so bad

oh you're supposed to be dead

thank you

what kind of attack did he do he just he

just walked away

he gave up on the battle and just walked

away and then I died

I guess the game gave up we did that

everyone

I actually don't know how we would count

that

the game gave up on me attempting the

challenge she just let me proceed anyway

thank you I guess

this most I like if the boat should be

here

so where's the boat and the boat is back

at the start

so how do we count that I mean it only

took me

[Music]

it take

I mean I did technically Die four times

but um

[Applause]

and therefore I did four but I could

only do sweat times before the game that

we proceed

but it did would have required me five

or more attempts actually so

I am yeah I'm on the other side

so how do we count that I did these two

attempt I I in my opinion there's only

two values uh Associates one because the

game bugged out and the the predictions

now invalid and our points are returned

or two it would have required me at

least one more attempt and therefore

this third option would have won those

are the two attempts

that

so uh how do we how do we consider that

because sure I technically only did

three attempts but it

wait did I need three attempts

one attempt two attempts three attempts

before I did actually yeah I did yeah I

did four attempts

so which was the second option two to

four attempts

and

I use the university this time and so

technically I would only need four

attempts

which was the second one last thing but

I would cry if I think I guess we can

see but

where's timing Amber hey

wait until kitten Creek is back yeah I'm

gonna decide yeah

I mean the question is should he win

Washington

but yeah wait wait come back

indeed

[Applause]

I'm so so easy

I want to spawn I mean still inside the

forest

certainly there are no mountains

yeah I don't want to continue

Grand traps

or I grant brunch

[Music]

I don't know what I do know what it is

in Swedish

and certainly something enough for me

but

that's why I said it in English

foreign

[Music]

back to the house and that's when I

started impressed

did I maybe that was all

yeah that's never enough

after all that battling I have

everything like second

yeah I don't think there is the max

limit for how much you can have it but

I'm still not sure if I want but I'd say

give it to you

yeah

yeah that's that's what I argue so if we

would hold the boat which I think I

should be allowed to go down to

that would be and if you do agree

that's this we have a majority

[Music]

yeah I think I asked this section right

[Music]

okay I'm back guys just listening but I

don't know what's going on

but I had two words in favor

because it was yeah the bank is stuck in

this area

maybe I didn't skip a cutscene I should

have watched

ah

okay so the game release yes

so the uh the question about was should

you take one attempt two to four

attempts or five or more attempts or

actually actually has averted cereal

days once you see that supported Plus

so I did die four times which would be

this adoption but when I died the fourth

time

and therefore was required to the fifth

attempt which again is the third option

and the game lets me go to the uh

and the next part of the game it didn't

require me to read it about

which are now responsible food

now I was thinking should I get it

now because it's saved as I skipped it

cutscene

I don't think I would still feel like I

actually got a Miss yeah keeping it back

foreign

[Music]

I don't see any ice Kings hanging around

this place

okay there's another bus

okay

should should we uh

okay it was it was four plus deaths

regardless

uh assets uh

okay thank you I'm gonna show you the

two spots on this stuff I mean it was a

weird situation it wasn't supposed to

happen

I will fill up my drink

and in the meantime uh you can

basically yes I'm gonna add this

it will be for this bus and certainly

The Game Wouldn't glitch out on our

butts because it is

okay and I haven't done this past last

time because now I've gotten passed

but it came

acted up last time

but it has been

when when did I started 14 so it has

been

we always already technically so I will

finish this person I guess this is the

end of the stream after that I think

we'll be fine

but I do need some more strings

big dick

some more

I just don't only drink to see the

stream I don't think about suggestion

what a surprise

a shocking elevation

Revelation relevation

and speak English

huh

we put this thing back

there's three minutes left

and uh yeah

foreign

foreign

[Music]

myself

kind of thing I

mean I can activate hydrate

I can read I can read demons here one

but when I do

it shows up as a redeem

which I can confirm or deny if I have

done that redeem

and if I deny it I get the points back

but I don't have points

it doesn't cost me anything and

about what maybe two heads are better

than one

even if one of them belongs to an

annoying mosquito mosquito me is that oh

maybe maybe he starts realizing

so since we didn't have anyone there I

will give you points back even if it's a

thousand thousands I don't like taking

more points away for nothing yes has

volt here I see that months of

refunds yeah that's my policy

all right no more thesaurus for you pal

all of you please be quiet

it is suddenly encouraging that Spyro

has been able to free two of you to

allow this reunion but haven't we

forgotten someone yes there's a company

so nice foreign

I suggest we adjourn to the training

room so that I can teach you some more

the legacy of the great ice dragons of

yore my ancestors who come from the best

of the best of this somewhat big dragon

lineage his long and storied with my

help rescuing terrador should be a

certain tear your pomposity arrogance

and pretentiousness is odious to the

extreme

shall we

I think so that means that I can say and

I have a backup

it's yeah I see them slots to last it

says

there are two of these

and that's that

so

it was fun and

I mean okay the game was a slightly

annoying in the book in the beginning

but it was nice that over the course of

one stream was three hours I mean I was

able to

even get further than I was able to

during the previous five hours how long

does this say again

0.5 yeah

so

I will continue by one and next Thursday

Friday has to be expected

and as I mentioned the

yesterday I have made move that two

hours earlier

don't start a new game next time now no

that wouldn't make sense you're doing

great fun thank you sorry

does it make it easier for you to watch

it

uh and when I have it two hours earlier

because I know I know you said it's

okay

previous like the previous time it's

been

not possible for you to show up sure

not force yourself with you

if you can't

but um

but also I would hopefully not be as

tired

and

also where

trying to think of something yeah

tomorrow should I should I continue

Legend Spyro even though that wasn't

scheduled

if I should see if I I have no idea what

I could do with dog's life to make it

work I will talk to someone and see

if there's something that could be done

and hopefully have it done

otherwise

I just have to come up with something

for tomorrow

and please come with ideas I I would be

happy with that too

the disc isn't scratches it's no it's

not on a disk

all right that's why I prefer copying

over the disks to

do the digital form

should I try this that's the problem I

have I still have everything

stored away I can't really

accessed

stuff

I'm working with my what I have that's

basically

if it doesn't work Spanish but sure sure

I keep cutting with fire

I just don't want this I want to I don't

want to be the spiders

otherwise

no I don't I can't we'll see I'll come

up with something

is good

and then that's all I have to

say for now

so

close down this

and let's visit

me because that's fun

no I need to open it there we go

nice

I need to keep there we go that's the

game I found it

who is

trying to

complete Ocarina of Time at the moment

yeah

something

it has a lot of banished thinking of

I have found a few bunny streamers

although she doesn't have any bunnies on

screen but there are a few bunny

elements on the channel

so uh

as usual

and please copy the bunny message

it is just select and copy if you're not

on the phone just hold down on the

message and then you it should

automatically copy it

and then you just again hold down and

then paste and then just sending it

that's the

that's what you usually do so

see you on the other side

and thank you all for coming and same

time tomorrow
