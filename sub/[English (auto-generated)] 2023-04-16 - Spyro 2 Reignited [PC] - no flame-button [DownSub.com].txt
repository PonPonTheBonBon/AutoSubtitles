hello welcome everyone
Let's uh
I'm still nourished in this
so let's continue
with
the second game
is
welcome
okay okay are you kidding
um as usual let's skip the cutscenes
this will take too long
the same with the NPC dialogues
so let's see everything works I cannot
Flame by a campaign I can't shout oh
thank you steam for reverting back to
the previous configuration
um
this stream starts off badly but why did
it reset everything
um
yeah I
reviewing every stream knows
I I actually don't know why it's doing
this
yes it said that it's perfectly ready
controls
so I have no idea why
has it
uh wait um this
demon is very annoying to control as
well
sorry for it thank you
because if I press on an option I press
it
take some option further up
I press sale I should press the save
button
and it's asking me if I want to share it
now I don't want to share it I just want
it
I just want to use it okay please
please Dean work
you're wasting time
another controller disappeared
yeah I'm claiming steam everything was
working as yesterday last stream
and
now it's just
[ __ ] annoying
yes you can come kitten you're doing
great
this is Swiss steam could work
it look it looks like it has changed my
settings for some reason
I don't know
I don't know why it does that
I don't know why it would reset my
settings
so hopefully the only requires one
restart
and that other viewer who was on joined
early on have slept
and they probably don't want to watch a
broken screen
see if the steamiest ruins everything
from
I should have checked that it was
working beforehand but I Was preparing
so much else as well
the game is starting up
there you go
[Music]
and now
I should have tested if I could have
this is the B button the uh
the right button
textbook controller
that shouldn't work
foreign
I can't run but I cannot flame now it's
correct let the adventure continue
as
ignore that
look at these baskets they're white
and I have to
gotcha I'm going to be
so used to charging everything
so
after that
your stream is perfect and it's
definitely not perfect
but I hope to improve it every time
like having fun from animated
let me check the volume is Max
volume
the notification sound
hear it properly
Stella nice to see you
now
now I'm
I don't know what to say
I didn't expect it to show up
I don't expect anyone to show
so
currently doing Spyro
which
Pom-Pom and I cannot Flame
I'm so happy I'm finally able to catch
our stream
hope you're having a good day well
steam what's messing with me a bit I
didn't use the craft control scheme at
first
but now it's working so
and it's also yeah yeah you're sweet
that makes more sense
I'm
not Perfectly Used to English
might have been able to figure that out
so otherwise
and
yeah
and I'm also very inexperienced
but these enemies I can't
touch
but they sure want to do
smash me
so
I need
100 gems
you must be the dragon everyone's
talking about
at least the text box says rabbit
so he wants to talk
and then
around that one without getting squished
so
I should probably
since this game requires different
abilities before you can complete
certain levels
as you probably get that ability first
and then we'll come back
to this level later
yeah not so
it's a time here
I would be lurking and cooking breakfast
but yay happy Sunday stream I've been
streaming
and two previous Sundays
but yes I've started very recently
so
but this for this
but it's 14 here but it will be moved
two hours earlier if that works I mean
otherwise I can continue
at the same time as previous
so this time
[Music]
whichever works best for
people
I'm running into the woods
currently a scattering
gems
let's get it all over the world
oh no
I fell down
and smashing my head into the horse
that's ignore Hunter
let's talk to Hunter over here instead
tomorrow as one of these orbs
not sure why he can't just
me
I mean it's not like we need it to
defeat this evil
evil Doer
give me
give me that
Mark oh so it shows up again
because the game has to fit in the
tutorial somewhere of course
but the no yeah the next game also he's
a reward points
Hunter is not really my favorite
character
so
where's it we're supposed to
um
save this world using these orbs
and then
which might have been due to
some
hunter in the first place
so
but then he doesn't want to give me the
orbs
until after I do one of
these challenges
you correct the error he has caused
while I'm not
I don't remember how I phrased it
but basically yeah sure it was a mistake
oh yeah this is a problem
that cannot hit this level
because I cannot I don't have anything
to defeat this animate
so here's the thing
[Music]
to get some hands back
because I still need Italian to actually
proceed to the game
so there are two options here
either I flame this enemy anyway so I
can proceed the level
which was kind of one of my exceptions I
added to the challenge otherwise it
would be impossible
or I skipped the whole level and pick up
the Talisman without picking up anything
else
I don't think there is any other level
that has
some requirement use Flame
it's probably more fun if I play a level
so I apply my original rule
if there's something required me
to
use flame to progress the game I have to
use plane
I think I think that's fair
otherwise I cannot complete the game
it would make the challenge a bit boring
I guess
one of the cutest upgrades when they
through the game was giving the enemy
a marshmallow
the end of the stick my marshmallow yeah
yeah so here's the hot dog
it's
I I haven't played this well I think I
played it once
um placing one
I played it first and third came
a lot so I'm not used to I so I don't
have any memory of this game
but I do like the
[ __ ] up some marshmallows
there was metal Shields
in addition to replaces fire with the
Pom-Pom
so it has the furry design from the
first game I do
because that's what she looked like in
the original
I'm sure
this was my favorite as a child I've had
a lot of people like this game
and
think it's often people's favorite game
it might be because I haven't played
this and that I don't have the same
feeling towards it I actually find
inspired to to be the
the most boring of this week
it's weird to see his flame
I shouldn't use it
but the king is the main other choice
but if you're kind of the same with
crash because it's similar they're
similar with crash I want to play the
first and third game a lot
and
the second game
I'm on a plate
I've probably played the crash too
but not in my shines it was much later
and The Last Enemy requiring flame and
that's it
yeah I don't have the same nostalgic
perspire to or crushed it which might be
the reason
okay I also don't like crash too as much
as three and one
I don't
I don't know
although this level also requires an
ability I don't have so
you probably leave it and move although
I do need more gems so I can
that's that money back wants a lot of
money
is a 3D bag
oh
foreign
this one I cannot flame because it does
not require me
to progress the game
I'm going to open this one
this one in that case
as there is one challenge I can do
that only requires charging also maybe I
should collect some extra lives
and the first game I died a few times I
don't remember how many times 18 or
something
I should see if I can die
here at times this time
so this part on record charging so
this should work
if I don't miss them
I have a question about when you create
a pumpkin Mount does it also change
Parks or is that something separate it's
actually
and the spark replacement is part of the
month
so
now it's a glowing orb
I wanted to replace barks with something
but
I couldn't come up with anything
and I think that would fit
one pump
I think that's all
that's all of all of the gems
I like it that's nice to hear I
I'm I'm bad
skipping another dialogues saying half a
word
huh
rushing through the game
when the pond is so cute little bunny
and thank you
this four-legged company is a very cute
bunny
oh let's see
no actually
I added
like a reply
let me see
but I didn't consider adding the ads
later in the message I forgot about that
so if you would write a reply like that
it shows up with a reply
but I should I should add it so it works
with the uh at the end of the messages
one
that will be the next step
to learn to swim underwater I would I
would love to swim on the water okay
okay
so
now
and die
let's let's clear this level a bit more
hello everyone
so
now with the ability to do
the wind on the water I can swim
underwater
it's
in this place are you going to 100
considering I'm not able to Flame that's
going to be impossible
but I want to
try to collect
as much as possible
maybe not
just to see how much I can do without
playing
since that rocket in this level I cannot
Lane
so I cannot get those gifts
so this puzzle shouldn't be hard
by doing these
no I am
that was the opposite of what I wanted
actually
like my family and New York
that's all except one
wait I should I should figure this out
give me a moment
I can
uh and I think I thought anyway that is
enough
I'm going to be stuck at this puzzle
forever
wait I have I have to do that and then I
do this it wasn't so hard
you should do that from start
stop the next place
they are not a great at the timing
accents
I should listen to his accent more
he's hungry and won't be satisfied until
he swallowed 10 fish he's got a
sensitive stomach so watch what kind of
fish you feed him
well I can't charge the fish so
I lost below the fish maybe I should
shop
nope it doesn't work
to clarify I don't sound like that I
mean I yeah I didn't expect you to
have the exact voice
Oh you mean you're only in your family
has the accent you don't have that
accent
or some of you
so I cannot complete this challenge I
did the other challenge so I think that
is everything I can gather in this level
340 is not bad
so and also because I don't have flame
buttons and I don't have a back button
in the messages
hello
welcome to
My Stream
I hope you have
a nice time here
my family lived in a different area of
New York and the mood so they sound like
that and I have different accents yeah
okay so
oh
it's sort of
I think that was what the
guest at the end there but I did I had a
few guesses their side
thanks for clarifying
to yeah
and to me it's just a lot of different
accents in English
so
this level is going to have some large
enemies too
which I also cannot Flame
so so yeah so that was an example on the
previous level where
a challenge I cannot complete due to not
have anything
there are so many different Regional
accents
I've heard there's a lot of
Accents in United Kingdom as well
not sure about like
other places like
Australia
I will
so I would likely
hear that there are different accents
but determining where the accent is from
that would be part
for me at least
taking care of this from Australia that
I can ask her yeah
how much of my variety is there
I'm sure Australia has different accents
might not be
discernible To None or sister yeah I did
expect them to have a accent it's just
how valid they are that's
the biggest question I guess
Sweden also has a lot of accents
but it's a bit harder to maybe explain
Swedish Accents in English since it's a
different language
hey look what I can do
accents in the South being so sick I
cannot understand them in the same with
North
I know they have a large indigenous
population so they cannot mix English
virginity
yeah that's
it's okay
especially if they speak English as a
second language
but could also
in that case there could be a lot of
variations
so
am I even going to get this
because there aren't many goats to
how many girls do I have
damn it so there's one more there
and then I need three more and I don't
think I can cut it
but I just have to say but on your
English is crazy yeah thank you I
I've been curious about how well I speak
English
and also how obvious my accent is
what's up
how over
stereotypical Swedish it's something
like
well PewDiePie is a well-known person I
would say he has
an obvious Swedish accent at least to me
and then I viewed other
like YouTubers I know another one would
be the click but he's not as popular as
PewDiePie though
who also has
I think a clearly Swedish accent
but I don't know how
similar I sound
and I've also been afraid of speaking
because uh
I've been afraid of how I sound well
what was the like accent price
so this challenge I'm pretty sure
requires me to spit
the
okay
because spider eats the parking this
challenge it's not worth it
so
yeah and that is requires me to speed
which I cannot do and none of the other
button works so
the only thing I can do is
do something like that but then the then
it flies awake
do you have a noticeable accent yes but
it's completely easy to understand yeah
that's good
that
my husband knows English as a second
language he has a strong accent but he
can't be he's lost it I
it's good to know that I'm easily
understood I've been also worried about
that and
sometimes I cannot understand myself
and that's
a striking other players is I found
and
when I had a park
so
can I give
it when I got squished but yeah I don't
think I can get further
because I
need to
get rid of more enemies
I only have nine so I need two more
guilds but I there are no more kids so
and that that thing didn't even have
Collision
so I think I just have to leave this now
at least I got the Talisman so
okay one last try
of course
oh I did it
did it actually worked
which means I can gather some more
chance
yay
I'm actually surprised that it worked
I thought I was going to miss that jump
that doesn't seem like I have anything
else I need to get up there
I cannot get up there without the power
up
which I cannot get so
let's exit this level
can it get a single orb but
that's why I have to make sure to
collect every orb I can collect
oh well yeah oh well who needs orbs
anyway
can you please teach me to say good
morning in Swedish
okay a good Morgan
or
maybe I should also type it to get
spelling Good Morgan which would be the
well wait I have saying it
otherwise people just say go [ __ ]
keeping their d d and g
but currently
thank you you're welcome
currently it is uh afternoon here
14 36.
so that would be
if there's a meter
a bit harder I guess
it's good
to start with the morning
and I hope the game audio is not too
loud
yeah I can charge this so no problem
you're well on your oh thank you Zoe
you're well on my way
I mean that would be for later
let's go to hercos
I'm silly and I tend to always say good
morning relax of time
couldn't you say
a good day
regardless of time
I don't know could be different
different cultures
I like the Japanese word for good
morning you say Ohio
[Music]
okay these sandwiches
trouble I think
spanner wrench
it's an adjustable spanner
isn't that a Swedish invention
I mean as Swedish
modification of an existing invention
but
please let me add this diode without you
having
here
and five minutes
I could but that's the sin and you want
to be silly
and I also have to learn your spelling
some
experience with it
it's fine you can spell your way
or I could add a
I don't know what it called
modifying the chat so it's corrective
that would be too much work
thank you
it would be too much compact stick into
consideration as well so I need
diets it's one over there
working I was a hover
that wasn't nice
I missed it oh no this isn't good
thank you
so that's one and that's there's the
other
oh
empty move on
yeah and then there is a challenge on
this one that requires plane
God I need health style otherwise I'll
die I can't die on the first one
right
when did I die first time in the
although the words are longer in this
game
fewer of them
so
I do have some house now I can be
less careful
it should still be a bit more careful
a rat
as long as it's not bunnies
so is that all
right
wait which is power up
which uh which requires 13 more enemies
I could get rid of all these enemies
that's kind of that's a catch I had 22 I
think you got it
I need the power up to kill the enemies
so I can get the
unlock the power up
I need more
they are they are definitely not enough
robots to
destroy
there are some
nice
oh he's distracted
eight
those robots looks like a robot from an
old TV show called Lost in Space
I don't know about that chair but maybe
someone else knows about it
oh
but I didn't know that there is the
achievements referencing the Alex
Daleks italics
be some Rush
from
the British show which I for some reason
Doctor Who was the name of it that's the
reference they made but the robots are
obviously not based on their robots from
that show
so I don't think I can't anymore
wait I can do more
and I don't know if there's enemies
there
do you need a lot more I need 10 more
enemies
yeah I'm not I'm not I'm not going to
unlock that one
all right you just came in The King and
I got that's the word I'm looking for
got in the way
so these are wait can I charge this
sentence
sometimes you can't judge enemies
because they're big a spice
yeah you can charge these enemies okay
sure that makes perfect sense
they are huge
but you can charge them probably because
it's they're considered it uh
uh I catch them
both because they consider this to be a
Chase and when you chase an anime you're
allowed to
margin I guess
or something
that's three
how does that
you can you can see kind of behind
pom-pom's hand
the travel and the game puts the stuff
in the bottom right corner but people
like to put there Avatar there so
four
you can see part of the digits that I
can count as well five
four no it's five you're off if you're
behind six
a lot of running back and forth It's not
a hard challenge I have heard people
have complained that this challenge has
been made
too easy and
it is very easy
so I assume
it must have been harder they must have
I done that
because I cannot remember anything from
the second game
average forever when it was still four
then
foreign
one
okay
nine
in the final Mountain
so do I get my orb now no wait
I just realized
thanks for getting rid of the
SE replaced all the lightning Stones now
you see
I can't do that because I cannot spit
again
yep my button doesn't work I cannot
speak I guess I'll just have to bring
this with me
I'm now an Elsa Thief
cannot speed it out
and those didn't count if only those 10
counted in that case I would have
unlocked that power up
it would have been so nice
did I
uh you can't cut he can't catch me in
the cutscene
I don't have anything
I'm going to leave with it
and now it's gone
swallowed the
lightning Stone I think they called it
so
let's continue the adventure so that was
Zero
another level with zero orbs
that's gonna cost in just this ah no
hard words pronounced
indigestion
no wrong method
so
this challenge this level should work
because I should I should still be able
to charge these to make the move it's
not as efficient
in this in the description of the
stomach yeah
I assume there was something with
digestion
thank you for
the
much easier to understand
together
that wasn't nice wait I can't shut
oh yeah I haven't done a cut Tower
I would definitely deal with you there
we go
and I charge this
is
in my husband
thank you
sea star
for being here
so I just have to be careful about those
fade wielding
it's
not
like babies for digging but this is a
peach
I don't know
I'm overthinking this
but yeah and this level has a challenge
using
if that flame power up which I again
cannot use
too much flaming required
it's it's almost like flaming it's a
core thing of spider
so I can sadly not
rescue your
turtle babies
no I said I cannot do it
at least this game doesn't have
gems in the enemies
so
I don't need to kill them to collect all
gems but there are of course a lot of
other stuff I cannot do you hide
two of these
going to die
and get into the town
and
this one is
too close
I
let's see if I can
I I still cannot climb
but
I wanted to anyway
so oh yes I love you back
let me see if I can get you up for that
Hill
without going towards that enemy please
continue
thank you no continue
the good turtle
and if I jump up you're going to hit me
yes here it is
and I cannot do anything about that
thank you little rabbit here he gets
a turtle talisman
and now
I think
yeah
light level do I have enough orps
because I cannot collect any orbs
doesn't even show me animal orbs wait I
missed some don't put there is no orbs
yeah and that level doesn't show when it
works either because of what's the name
is
active camera that's what I prefer I
didn't know other people's that other
people don't prefer the camera but
I prefer it
although I don't notice much of a
difference
okay
wait Spyro this is a hybrid dreamer I
forgot about they should
n't they list uh how many
black
after you close the
dialog box oh wait I need to get my
after they have oh now I've got three
more
after they have said their thing yeah
like with a money box but but now I do
have enough
but if I wouldn't have enough gems after
he says I need more gems you get that
summary dialog box at the end
yeah that was pretty easy to get the
third one
but it didn't do that very Laura
he doesn't like summary dialogue boxes
she wants you to actually listen to what
she says
so this is a flight level
but now I will do a flight level without
Flame
wait should I do this first
oh there it is
spacing with him this is a bit cleaner
or should I no I should have done the
okay you can shut them
the problem is they are kind of slow out
oh yeah I could do that okay I see I see
I might actually get an all-in-one for
once and
why not use new using Flame
connected back to you
the boats
there we go
and now the last one
here it is
I did it
it actually worked
I got
all
things without using Flame
that was impressive thank you
I'm I'm surprised it actually worked
nice
it actually doesn't work in the first
game because you cannot charge boats or
planes
um but they made it so you can charge
both I was actually surprised that word
I'm never able to finish those stuff
yeah that's
if I say no no there's no summary spot
oh so
yeah
I do know most people have
trouble with just doing it normally with
flames
so but
yeah I
I think
um
I don't know I also
it just feels like I'm bragging I don't
want to do that
um
I think yeah the first hurdle people
have is that the they say the
controllers are reversed but they are
based on pilot controls
push the stick forward
and that's so
so standard in games that I'm used to it
oh it was
I played but yeah I played those flight
levels a lot
as a candy I think you can yeah you can
see that I think this is an oversight
because
that's seahorse
was standing on the ground because there
was no water
this seahorse you will need
of my my voice you will meet after you
get around go around the whole level
but they will already be water there
but you can see that and that one even
before
I wonder if it's like that in the
original game
it's a tiny detail doesn't matter but
I have a funny story when I was a child
the bank the mechanical sharks what
these guys think to me like it came in
nightmares
LOL
yeah I could imagine that
I mean they they do look a bit scary
enough
I do have
I want to remember that we're being
similar kinds of enemies in other games
I played
are also scary
usually because they're
indestructible normal of course
yeah while they are indestructible for
me forever
I cannot do anything about it
rabbits cannot shoot fire so
I cannot do anything about those sharks
now
so now it's the real nightmare
can you just get up there please
please thank you
yeah I'm happy
I'll tell people I do tell people to at
home to jump back into Japan but I don't
do it myself
and I picked that one too
thank you
I thought I was high enough
seems like I can charge all enemies in
this level except those sharp shots
so
hi Spyro you must be yeah
these sharks are
those Champs will also be tricky because
I would probably not get past these
sharks I could give it a try
but I will be one less if I fail
and when you exit the
the EU boats the submarine
aspirable automatically jump down from
there
so
I give it a try now did I get a
checkpoint
oh there we go
now I'm sure I got the checkpoint
let's see if I actually manage just to
get this
yeah look away now now I'm going to
attempt to sneak past those sharks
that didn't work
I think that's a test I don't have a
fixed mindless counter
so I have a manual Discounter
shoot I
knock my fuel yeah
I just want to take one
let me in my brain better say yeah
I was good to say it twice
that was surprising
I didn't know they were that fast
oh okay let's let's not attempt that
again
that was that was a bit of a shock
um
instant death
yeah it's not like the enemies Inspire
one
where they yeah
munch on you and speak you out
I thought don't don't do that is by
three as well other than the enemies
Inspire one or three that are instances
looks like you can't Dodge them now
they're too quick
what I need is this power up
perfect
now I can not do anything
but yeah but there is a challenge here I
can do actually
and Hunter is even willing to give me
two orbs for it
this is a bit oh now it works I got
stuck on a sheep I actually can do this
challenge too
bubs
well now my power up I can't use this
about the end
so
hello Hunter who supposedly
this is supposed to
too many supposed to and I have the can
I get the orbs you have yeah I don't
care about your mentoring I just need
the orbs we need to stop crypto
okay
I will add this to the list of reasons
I will tell Elora
and she's going to be even more upset
with you
okay let's give her a second course
these are two easy orbs
I mean if you can deal with flight
controls I guess
but this is slower I think
look at something else
foreign
so this should also not require Flame
they should be three easy orbs
I really do need more orbs
camera sure likes to
get close
what was the second one is
it was
plastic Christmas
seconds
and now back in down into
this place again
four so three should be in front of it
oh it's just a crap that's pretty simple
number four
it might also be that
um
I tried to press the break button
okay that was just stupid of me
there's no break button in this game
so yeah
so yeah spider one didn't really have
these challenges and
I guess these challenges
aren't really
super exciting
oh it is yeah yeah
so much no I did it again
take out my anchor on that
crap
the sixth one is
is that in the last area
have
Pom-Pom swim company swimming
as fast as you can
she flaps her little wings or something
oh I was I was almost almost running for
that one
and it's just disappears
welcome Yara
I hope
I hope to enjoy this dream
so that's
if I guess it just taught me all of oh
yeah I forgot about the
challenge in the
background
you can use the quit slower option as
well
minority cutscenes
13 36 oh so close
I need a single red gem
if there is any
um
but I don't know what these contains so
too much
okay here's more
all right
those are even even worse so
I'm not stuck in 66.
thank you Laura I didn't mean to speak
to you but
I need to
find Hunter oh yeah and it should just
be that flying challenge
I guess no wait
anything
pretty good yeah I'm pretty good
I mean
didn't you see me defeat the challenge
without using Flames huh
that's not some fragrancing
I don't know what
to Hunter are you
it's kind of a weird
oh
I didn't count because I flew through it
before he did
wait okay wait
another thing to restart the whole thing
they're taking Hunter to the nest eating
oh okay wait a minute I I just need to
eat what was she actually saying
okay
so it's it's a race
in order to win the race you must feel
through all the Rings
first the ring will start to shrink
okay but
but okay so my so I my objective is to
follow answers through the Rings I can
and did I miss the ring or did I fly
through it before Hunter
through the whole setup
or what you call it for this race
seems to be wrong it's not a race if I
if I have to follow Hunter
and if it doesn't count if I flies
before him
I think that's called cheating
but I mean he's a cheetah so
it was a bad pun
I guess I'll just follow him
oh
a sun in my eyes I can't see
so far
as well maybe I did
just sitting to fly through the evening
before as well when it was pink
I'm going to win
up no all right one second place
okay but I mean I came second but sure I
take the reward
that was all you had to say okay
I'm very confused
I do not know what just happened
but I guess I got an orb out of it so
I think I got all the Tasman now so
well done Spyro thank you Anora
oh
slipped on the edge no okay this is a
boss fight
I have to
um
I must use flame otherwise I cannot pass
through this challenge so I will use
Flame
so come on
back up seven you have a lot of hands
buy the one buses on the hair the three
halves three have three hit points
except National had to
I don't know how how you would come to
the Health Point Warrior
metal head because you cannot Flame
so far through the floor
now
yes
two more
this one is a bit easier
and now the final one can I do it
without getting hit now I'm going to use
it
I did it oh
how do I did get the
skill point before those rocks fell down
fully so if I would have stood still
there could I still take damage and
still get this game point
building next world
so first we're completed in
about an hour and uh
70 minutes
so I guess
next world
start with
Crystal glacier
and I hope everyone
has a good time
oh yeah
um
I would
this will okay
these do require
yeah
naming to
and I'm pretty sure I cannot fly over
there
I would like to try
but I don't want to count these stats
is this that one with the cute stuff yes
yes
now snow leopard in this one
what was his name George yes you George
the snow leopard
I might
it's worth a try
but then I realized
I cannot get up to the other place
the next part that I would not be able
to get to
so yeah I have to blame this
I cannot proceed the level otherwise and
I need to proceed the level to free trip
I was already standing on the Catapult
until you teleported me away
and I'm sure I cannot
name these and if I if I don't blame
this they do that so I have to blame
these enemies otherwise I cannot proceed
11.
it will be a lot of flaming in this
level
in a challenge for not allowed to play
there's one more
how do you come to me now yes thank you
and when it comes
pretend you were given a torch for this
lavender
I mean yeah we're no they're not watches
there
that's what there are torches over there
see I guess yeah
let's say I picked up one of those two
brushes
but I'm not going to use I'm only going
to use Flames when I'm required to
explain for example I cannot use flame
on this I have to charge these
but I can use the invisibility to get
more out of it
get more of those and only taking that
much ones
no ball people yes
sorry for murdering this novel people
but I need to do that
but I didn't need to murder both I guess
imagine the bunny stuff so it's fine
so this one is not uh preventing me from
continuing levels
family versus bunny
look at this bunny it's very cute to
have a fluffy taste
and now
hunting no that's not something
I I ran into the walls so the enemy
missed me I'm running
no the bunny one that's right they wanna
battle today okay that's that's
what happened
that's an actual test
okay the bunny one that's four zero
Edition
bust against that bunny
was too strong for me
it's not running away
so what's that all bunnies and no one
comes and surprised me again
I guess so that's it's not about
claiming anyway got in the way hey
another thing
all right
I'm
so now let's see oh I still I'm worried
how many do I have now
mine
fix more and this does these do not
count
there should be more bunnies yeah I
cannot charge them so I cannot use this
challenge anyway
but they might be it has some gems
why can I not climb that one
it seems like a good way to keep up
I mean until
Monday moves it
I don't know how I don't know why paying
money back to make this email but
and oh yeah I cannot I cannot help the
snow leopard anyway
because it requires framing
so
I should avoid
feeling the
noble people unless
sorry but if I saw this one
I don't yeah both of these problems
face this one
this one Destiny 2 plus
similarly here
thank you anyway
okay sure
that sounds good to me
wait you just come on why did
yeah
you're both going to freeze them again
and again and again
I tried to hit that but
see
I didn't know you could skip this
thanks for the Ice Crystal it is very
beautiful
one more try
do I
I must have enough enemies now because I
killed some extra
now since
I cannot charge these I can not help you
with the infestations
let me just collect gems
I cannot help you change the station but
I'm going to pick up the your money
so
that
I I fell down the gap
let's let's meet the snow leopard
thank you
no I didn't I didn't think
yeah he should be over here
and some more chance
I got the gym
let's find George for you
and let's see if I can do something oh
here we go
look a snow leopard
pets
baby Snow Leopard
why didn't you jump up here
seriously jump up here you're not
supposed to go here
you're supposed to go to
I I don't remember this I think we got
this fish
okay catch it yeah try it you must get
closer okay let me try
nope
sorry enough food for you
the fish is
unchargeable therefore
you they will
because the water hurts as well I don't
know why
I guess it's so cold it hurts or
something
I said inspired swimming because it's
like
it is
but I go to all gems
I did not get I mean where is it
what's the second orb
um
but yeah no and now I'm silly the second
orb is the flying challenge of course
well I guess that's the first one
I can't see the flying challenge because
I cannot charge the
things and I cannot do the
no leopard challenge because I'm gonna
charge the fish there's too few things
you can charge
I don't know let's connect some more
gems
I've got lots of gems
something like stems
the two two minute challenges
I didn't know there were so many orbs in
this game that requires Flame
scalos no it's kilos right
I think it's key I shouldn't it maybe
two e's in that case
I don't know English spelling
no it doesn't say speak English I think
it was skinless you can correct me from
now
oh these are going to be a challenge too
it's rid of
am I allowed to say kill
and these are your meant to charge I
mean you can't you cut through the flame
an enemy made that's a fine
oh you can flame through stuff oh that's
going to be
let's create the ability
we are over here
and I assume this challenge requires
Flint let's see
and that challenge requires spitting so
that one I can't do
I'll try to help you but I cannot
promise anything
no I cannot help you goodbye
I don't think there are any gems there
either
yeah
sorry your villages will be eaten I
cannot do anything about it
that's life sometimes
no don't
karma is
a stupid cat come back if I go back do
you count down sit down on account again
like a good cat she did
lying above bottomless bits that's
that's it yeah
okay let's see
please Cat come back come back down on
the ground
and now you did not move
questions
yeah you can keep the bone I don't
I can't do anything about it anyway
I don't think so
wait do they count as enemies if they do
I should kill them
they do okay in that case I should kill
them
well sorry I'm going to kill you now
and I do need 16 so six more
I should be able to correct this bit
Dodge yeah
can I can I hit it multiple times
no only once
I guess how to do that one more time
no
this don't fly over lava thank you even
the lava is easier because it's not
bottomless feet
and that one flies over and lava
you are very good
uh no
that was a failure
I will get the invincibility first
not to be confused with invisibility
which I didn't know the difference
between those words and one of those are
to speak English so that was my excuse
so
and
or actually I think
that I didn't consider those to be two
completely different
hello
oh so close
okay let me just try to get
three more okay this is one I only need
two more
where can I find two more enemies
which I can reach that's
an important qualify it
like these are too far up
can't reach them
I guess not
but I'm so close
two more enemies this is that one I
could
because I just have to
wait yeah I can get this too
I almost got hit there
and then there's this enemy
now it's for only 15.
ah I need one more
YouTube cats are very good okay thank
you
more health and I may be able to get
that cat
I guess I think
I'll see you as well
so I need more health and then I think I
can get that cat and then I can
invincibility
oh wait Kathy sitting no
cat was sitting on the ground
yes 16 enemies now
I can't get this power up and now I'm
just gonna kill you
fast Revenge
it's very personal
connect
is one of these
oh no
careful
wait six that means
two more yeah there's that one ignored
in that one I cannot reach I enjoyed
seeing the different colorations and
drugs and this is
the black Pom-Pom
with the uh
magma features
on the
ears
I'm glad you like it
yeah yeah right I was going to get me
I was I was going to get that cat
because
Revenge
and then I must apparently get that
question mark face
look I missed it yeah
you can still leave
and then I think I missed a few
yeah I'm back for an update took a long
time yeah I wonder why the deer count
was alone
what or oh I saw that
but nice to see you back
sorry no you don't have to be sorry
about that that wasn't
you you're gonna predict how long that
would take
and you're afraid to come and go just
whenever you want
you just missed all the death I
please
cost and right I was going to pick up
these yeah yeah and I'm sad that I
cannot help you
so
yeah so there was still stamps I did not
use and then the question is is there a
way for me to actually reach
here or something no
no I'm not going to be able to get that
done
there's no way I'll get
there
used to have a nice Pom-Pom
ody I certainly say
oh yeah
let me use this bridge
okay turn home
my video camera very fancy modern
that's two levels I think
how are you doing today I am
just questions
is it like
what do you call it
no I don't remember the name of it
okay it's more like
is it is it meant more like a form of
greeting uh suggests everything is fine
is it
like it's all right
how about you or is it a genuine
question
uh which I should explain my whole
situation
I'm really bad at social stuff
wait a minute
I forgot about the climbing thing it's
to you wait you mean it's up to me
to me as well
well
okay
I mean it is I do feel great about
I guess
talking with you people
so I
know it's it's okay and
I am looking forward for the streams I'm
scheduled
but I'm at at the same time
very nervous
I'm about to when
starting these dreams
I don't I don't know how to start or end
screen so
let's see
Maybe
are you going to eat
what are you planning to eat that's a
good topic
I'm happy you're streaming today I was
feeling lonely and it's always great
being with friends oh my that's that's
really nice of you
it's nice to hear
known as a friend we are friends yeah
I'm really enjoying seeing you in
an English art I'm really bad at
expressing my feelings
but uh
I'm actually really happy
I'm really happy to actually see you
show up oh they were closer
I'm not even sure if we get charged
oh I missed nice guy
um your streams are really good
all right well that's an option I guess
got them attack each other
please attack me
now you don't want to attack me now
you're afraid
um
yeah
so
I have some
cute
yeah I
of course don't know what that is so
but I hope
it will be good
and tastes well
cannot
I think I've heard it before but I
cannot remember
quarter of it oh sausage oh oh yeah
cute
cow Bass
is kind of is it yeah is it a specific
sausage or is it
uh just sausages in general that's a
funny for that
but I can
so I can't shout first let's get
police started
well it yeah it is in Polish so I have
to use five for that but
that's honest in your knee I cannot use
five of that things because that's
against the ruins
and I can also get that one
but it might yeah I might need to
fill up my
murder Counting
but I guess the
now I'm hungry
yeah maybe we shouldn't talk about food
now let's see can I do this
no I cannot
you can do that in the first fire
but I guess design means about for them
are you really going to
see
are you really trying to murder me
why are you laughing at me
experts
buying over
Sergeant birds why
what wait
let me get out of here
so I think I need to destroy that thing
to get through because I don't think I
can get over there without destroying it
thank you
yeah I do need to destroy that thing I'm
not going to be able to replace it
however I can speak to this one
a little Bow Peep I don't guess your
cowlicks
I'm not sure why I'm actually not sure
what you meant with a certain perfect
it's still breakfast time where I'm at I
don't want wait why don't you want
breakfast
it's nice with breakfast bread Fast
breakfast first
is that
all right it's fast as in fasting
break from the fasting
but these birds aren't making this easy
but yeah so I cannot push it in
so yeah it is breakfast because it's
breaking the fasting but I confusedly
break first because it's the first break
so break first still works
I made carbonara for breakfast yesterday
I do recognize the term
carbonara
and
that I cannot become exactly what it was
about
yeah can can anybody please first please
stop
I am taking damage from that
attacker
wait I might need them for nothing
I know that's not how are you supposed
to open it but that might be how I need
to open it
the wrong one
so I can destroy some things with those
Rockets because no
now the question is if I can destroy
this thing
oh yeah that's going to be a challenge
it's an Italian Dish and made from
Spaghetti Carbonara sauce and
yeah I'm
yeah
something says tells me that the
spaghetti part is not part of the
carbonara
but it's a spaghetti Al carbonara that
would be the spaghetti version of it
come and cheat me
that sounds good it is probably very
good you didn't explain what's going on
he's with Carbonara sauce
okay so I cannot get you to shoot this
because he refused to shoot me and as he
killed your friend that's gonna read
don't shoot ponton
no I agree
but do shoot me when I'm standing behind
in front of something you should
now
this isn't going to work because I
cannot get this off the edge
because that's by Design so my wait wait
oh there it is
so my only chance is to get to prayer to
shoot it
well don't
they barely moved by getting shot by the
bird
and that's not an option
okay I need to be careful now I got no
Health left
okay we can look at what compound looks
with the fire power up
it has yellow
the bird was so close
come on bird
no don't fly away
it's because you can fly freely doesn't
mean you should do that
the skirt and its ample pairs yellow as
well and her eyes turns yellow
and nose and also tongue I just did that
for fun
yellow pumpkin looks cute
these
I come to death challenge either
right I can still do the cowlick
challenge because there are seven of
them and I only need to get five of them
well
the challenge is in two phases
first five and then seven
so I can do the five
sorry I have to charge you but you don't
want to move on your own so I got no
other choice at least I'm not blaming
you
need to
okay do you want to move over thank you
nice
now let's get you to the pen
okay okay
there we go
that's a long flight
and up
yes you're up
and now to the pen
and that's the fourth one and now I just
need the last one
now the thing I've mentioned about it
I don't know
yeah yeah okay so
ready to go
oh
that's not good
what uh messed that up
what kind of flight was that
okay you cannot charge while you're
hovering okay good to know well I cannot
do anything about them us getting up
there requires me to
fifth
can I do
I would just maybe bunnies can't spit
either
well I cannot gather all the characters
because I messed up
such is life
I can at least get these I just need to
have serve this again oh nice I jumped
into it
nice feeling good pumpkin
together
oh
and this one doesn't move I'll turn
right
and that one is at the start the other
one wasn't that it's not
so
from the start
okay
maybe I didn't speak to him
a bit late speaking to me now
so
and then I need to avoid these things
it's because they yeah it must be
because they are rolling them they're
just throwing them down
okay so I need to use the flame on this
one to progress the level
but I cannot use this
I mean on that converting mix
oh
yeah
I'm about to shoot this one
yeah the bad cat nice
one less energy
dangerous are yeah there's a lot of
explosions of these pairs of
stuff there's lots of explosions going
on here
all right just
throwing TNTs that they
get from their
inside
okay
okay I can charge it
that would have been funny
okay now
I'm running into him
yeah I'm pretty sure I'm not going to be
able to trick the bird into shooting it
never will probably take all day
way too short
foreign
I need to get out of here
oh
sneak you want
showing up in that window
I didn't see you use fire
well
you don't see the fire being used but I
use the fire button to make the rocket
fire
and the rule was to not use the fire
button
yeah the title of this dream should be a
no flame button
so it's not simply not using flame I
cannot use the button at all
but then there are these additional
exceptions that would be too much to
include
in the title
no flame button except for when there's
something preventing me from progressing
they came to reach the final boss
but only for that single thing
and I do Metro Speedway with charge
if we'll see
wait can I wait
can I charge the parts or not
that was weird I see you're doing great
thank you
so I can charge the
this is
I am getting a bit confused at the
moment
okay okay I see I need this
I cannot charge the birds I have to
charge the lever
that is going to be annoying
oh
this is going
right Tony
I hope that messed everything up
this is going to be a very fun challenge
because using flame you're kind of
hitting everything
but you we're using charge you must have
must be more precise
yeah you must be very precise with it
and I should I never missed up here but
I should see how well I can do this
and also see if I can yeah I can take
these
this isn't easy
can you stop moving up and down so much
this isn't the most efficient product
oh how did oh
can I hit the Rope
that's sudden it would make things easy
I just wanted to test if I could eat the
Rope
because in that case I don't have to be
that accurate
except they wrote this kind of thing
got it
I need to remember there is a bit of
and now again
now I'm doing it I'm gonna miss one but
let's ignore that okay I need it while
I'm messed up yeah I can hit the Rope
that makes things so much inside
why can't I
no I don't want you to look I want it
it is working
but I have already missed a bird so
she she was completely on the waterline
so now now it's the real round now I
will do it
let's look at this
yeah starting off good starting up kids
come with Mr bread yes that's half the
birds
kind of take that one
well I tried to be smart there but that
was stupid
I got all the birds
it was one though so I missed it
yeah
I mean it makes sense being a bit
charged in Europe to knock them down
wait where's the next part pert
now this is the wrong way
headshots
it's only give one second that's going
to be hard
foreign
I just didn't know where I was supposed
to go
I mean that's pretty good but it's just
the Arches I messed up on
so since I got so close I might be able
to do it this time
much closer yeah
it's only four arches I just don't know
where they are I should have looked at
where they were first
okay now I'm doing really good
brace it myself I can take that part of
my bed back
around
press it all the way it's coming around
doesn't work
is it where is it
let's do this one I did miss one
oh it's over there oh that was that was
a kid
you can do it thanks for the support
I I'll do my best
I think I should go in here
foreign
so that's not making it easier
low signs I thought it was a warning
signs
I should do it this time I mean I don't
want to do it
what happened
on the way back
foreign
no
I missed that one again
to go with his path backwards
nice
nice
ah
I was so close
did I like take these first or something
oh
all right aren't you charging
wait did I miss one
I didn't miss one
but I did not but
I have no idea what I'm doing at the
moment
nope don't fight so
yeah that was a mess
I don't even know where all the Arches
are apparently
this is going to be very tricky I hope
it's not boring I think I can't stop
doing this if you don't want me to
continue
because I didn't don't need to do this
well I do want the orb so I
do want to actually complete it balance
you're okay I like it because
good to know
I know I missed the part I just
relax
really be exciting when I'm finally make
it
there it is that's the
not for ashes which I don't know where
they all are
missed that one
almost the second one as well
okay that's all the signs
now it's just all the options two more
notches one more Arch and that there it
is
nice through it yes I did it
oh that was close
I'm happy that it worked yay
and now I just need to find the
layer put it all right yeah
a little closer it was doing like two
seconds left or so
you did a celebration time I wish I had
some celebrations
what if I can't even do this wait I'm
not supposed to just fly into the yeah
I'm only supposed to fly into the
those things
um not not that way
okay let me try again
I pressed the wrong button
wait the same thing I just I might just
press this button
to give me more time
good good
not this one
why did it have parties on these bags
oh you're flying up here
but it landed on the ground I could just
have picked it up
and also that one is really hard to get
because it's a plastic ground
so let's see
now I should be more prepared of the
past
third
halfway
sometimes
okay now because I was
I knew he was going there but I didn't
remember it was if it was another one
and without the things
beginning
for a third
Parkway
yeah yeah
it goes well last one
there you go I did it
and uh
it puts
in the guidebook I guess I don't know
how but
it's a magical book
I'm happy with that
priced
oh well they should fix it so you can
charge the planes and boats Inspire one
making it so we can actually do all in
one on those flight levels too
it's quite a fun challenge
but it is
quite hard
and of course if
you're already struggle with doing it
the normal way I can understand that's
not for everyone
and
I I can't remember about the colleagues
and then I'll go back and do them when
why did you run in front of me when
um
if I have too few
orbs at the end
I can to go back and do the public
challenge
or one more orb hopefully I don't need
more than one more work at the end
isn't this music
the
I cannot flame that thing
I didn't ask them a Dark Hollow
doesn't exactly sound like that song
it's kind of inspired by it but I have
to cheat with flame again because the
level doesn't want me to progress
without it
ah
you know you know what
no no sorry I cannot do the trolley
level because I don't have feelings
the only the only way
the only way I could do the trolley
level
uh well or I don't I don't know is
if every single thing is a box and not a
barrel no wait I cannot change the signs
I was wondering I was supposed to
get a lead
to fire this
and then you turn it out there for I
must kill you that's the rules of this
challenge
swimming pumpkin you like one pump on
the swimming
swim in the lava
I'm gonna
let's take a look
I can't really get a good lick
my mom holding your breath is a bit
weird looking
yeah
I guess that's what she looks like once
for me
battling like a dog
that's when she does that I don't
exactly know what she's using too
please haven't turned that off again
oh is it that one
oh yeah it's just that one but I don't
have to kill it because it's just a Time
challenge now
on that
yeah
that's the rules
and you I can shop this
is
and here's the challenge that she tells
can't do that
and then the drama Channel it is on the
two challenges
yeah
no orbs for this lemon either
looks so cute
I'm really happy
you think so
there are a few things I would maybe
change I don't know I just got bothered
doing it
what is entire
I wasn't even close it
or 14.
eight yeah I'm not even going to give up
to the trolley anyway
I like the pink bow and pink skirt but
that those are the best features
please please continue ignoring it
so four more
there are a few more I can get rid of
so there's this one
sure likes to flee
the front is um
you would you're very busy try turning
it up
that's how you kind of try turning up
with me
oh I was hoping that Solitude would go
and try to
turn them off again
keeping me excuse to kill them but
I guess this is as much as I could do in
this now
that's that
a very short level
I got the Talisman sir
this skirt was the well I I did first
make her
without a skirt
I wanted to do a dress like the one
is wearing
as you can see this top part of
but
um that was was too hard
I just made it the skirt part it was
much easier
but if you want to use this mod yourself
and I
it's available on both Nexus mods and
mods DB
I I was
wait I can't
if you have the game on PC it's not
available for other
console it's not available
I find that pumpkin looks super cute
I'm really happy for that
um
I think I can't no no I cannot see the
flag challenge but I can do the duty
monkey challenge
that's good
it's got extra life
and I can do
that I cannot do I don't think it did
that one
how do they stick their heads down
The Rock platforms
also and also your pants
this is my pumpkin bunny
what are you talking about
are you confusing me
so let's do the monkey challenge
monkeys have escaped from the Avalar Zoo
where is it acting up again right this
controller isn't the best I do have an
Xbox One controller this is a 360
controller this is our third party 360
platform
expensive otherwise
but I do have an Xbox One controller but
it's
it's cable is acting weird
I could just buy a new cable because it
says
okay you're not going for that one
is that answer customers
I'm just going to do them extra business
I'm busy and DC
it's scratching his butt
[ __ ]
ing
just making sure they cannot throw
anything I told you
you don't have that picture already
thank you
thank you
butterflies nothing
that should be the uh
we did not available
it comes with both the skirt and without
the skirt whichever version you are
preparing
and it should also have the custom logo
made
which was featured at the very start of
the
stream but
I can't really show it
again I guess I can quit again
service person
I might get this game on PC now he has
to play with the bunny it but just to
play with the pumpkin and as he said
Xbox 360 controller cool and Xbox One
controller are okay
and I
depends on what you mean by cool
um the I do prefer I think three the 360
controller
time was the best controller
better
[Music]
um
and not to say I need to put you for
yourself I know it's a hard topic but
everyone around allowed to have their
own opinions of course
is wrong
because I do like how the
left a controller stick is to the top
left even if it is unsymmetrical it's
not the term asymmetrical maybe the
actual term
is what I use the most when playing game
because it gives me 360 control compared
to the d-pad on giving eight directions
thus I can
you can also go slowly if you find
I haven't switched my PC crashed ages
ago and it's not important enough
I wonder if it's possible to fix it
but otherwise
the rest of the controller is basically
the same as an Xbox
otherwise aside from some second d-pad
placement the Xbox and PlayStation
controllers are basically the same
so
but there are other aspects as well I'm
currently on covering the Xbox One
placing controller
oh no
uh
because at the stick on the Xbox
controller is
concave meaning that you have an
indentation which that some can rest
inside
while the PlayStation controller is
convex which means it's
well the opposite
which I find very annoying because my
son even though they have made try to
make it more grip
grip better my thumb still slips off it
because it's not it's not a good design
I think they fixed that and tasty now
placing a fiber only adds it's little
convex but they added some kind of edge
around it
to Xbox have copyright on that side but
how does it look Nintendo
and also the same with triggers the Xbox
triggers are like a trigger on a gun
so your finger can actually exactly
kinda shaped based on your fingers
while on the PlayStation they are again
the other way around
so when I
play things like racing games where you
hold it down to
accelerate my finger can sometimes slip
up that doesn't have enough still not a
cute design
we need those flags
my face I might run this game oh that
would be good if if it works for you
uh it would not be a good thing if you
buy the game and it doesn't run I think
steam actually have a refund option so
if it doesn't run well on your PC you
should be able to refund it
wouldn't it be worth repairing
um
okay first this was already about 20
years old okay if it's that um yeah
and because uh I meant
yeah voice yeah yeah I see what you mean
one piece is from 2019 yeah that's
it's more about
the performance of it and also if you
have
done anything is that oh yeah that's the
only challenge why I can't press the
back button
s uh yeah it's more yeah it's more about
the performance yeah
and that disappearing animation is weird
so
yeah
and that's my opinion between Xbox and
PlayStation
and I think the there was before with
you
and the way you switch so will you
basically
did the Third Way of placing the sticks
and the buses which was kind of weird
yeah
some puns controller opinions
but I do still respect if other people
prefer other controllers
I would not disagree with that let's go
to fracture Hills
and I don't
the performance is pretty cute yeah
that's in that case because this
computer isn't really I mean I couldn't
run the uh my bunny game at the same
time as
I couldn't run this game at the same
time as running the animated Pom-Pom
so that was
doesn't have great performance
I like Xbox controller
the reset 316 before right
I used an Xbox controller for the
PlayStation 5. it's hard to get this to
work I could imagine
and then
so
but I'm not sure why why is the why do
don't you like the
oh no don't put me I hate me it is enemy
doesn't swallow you
but why why do you prefer as far as I
understand it why do you prefer this 360
over the One controller
unless you mean that is it's harder even
harder to get that one to work
so these things I can feel it because
they can sleep around again large
enemies
which you for some reason can charge I
mean you could date on the hive might be
in charge they only move but none of the
other
and large enemies move when you charge
them
so the game is still inconsistent
360 controller is built more strong than
a
I haven't had issues with that but I'm
not going to duck you
um I haven't considered it
because I don't destroy my control okay
now I haven't had the controller failing
so I like that
about that
person yeah the uh
other aspects I do prefer about the One
controller over 360 is that's the
because I don't know why I don't
know why did they if it was a decision
but the
360 controller has kind of dead zone in
the Middle where the stick doesn't
Center properly
so you have to enable the larger that
zone
this is why I
thank you for ruining my name station I
died how many times did I write now the
chat has been quite active
there we go
this is the success now
it's quite good
yes I was going to say uh
I tried to increase that sound but it's
apparently still not perfect uh the
the center position of the 360 stick is
still not
it's too large so sometimes it's the
game breaks their moments and I realized
I didn't read this one yet
as I died
I don't like I don't understand yeah I
didn't mean that I dropped an extra I
see that station here Xbox One
controller and some thinking this inside
but my Tracy color is still stuck yeah I
think actually
I think you actually correct about that
yeah yeah
I think they tried to make the control
more lightweight
yeah it is probably
hit each other at the same time
bagpipes are apparently so loud they can
crumble Style
and
this is why you shouldn't listen to that
type music you will crumble crumble your
ears
yeah let's let's combine the 361
controller
and there's also less uh
resistance on the stick yeah
it's nice
what about my
two issues I guess is that yeah I guess
you're right about
I want to know that yeah
management
so I was close to getting eaten there
eat my ears on Stone
so safe
maybe maybe you're right about that
I haven't I haven't seen you yet
maybe you are lying I don't know
Jesus
no please don't touch me I'm just a
bunny
I need the help
yeah yeah that's good to know
and now you need to reply the twitch way
and I hope it showed up correctly
because I didn't really see it properly
on my screen
I mean I didn't see
I don't have enough
but I can see the
it's hard to explain it
[Music]
yeah thank you for the checkpoint
I wanted now I cannot charge the trees
as far as I can see nope I don't like
at least I can charge these otherwise
this level would be
more I can let the
last one play out in full
for somebody said you cannot skip these
cutscenes if they are called Cuts in
immediately you have to wait I keep
pressing the button but nothing happens
I can do this challenge
she needs help well
you didn't want to touch me at least
all right all right please don't touch
me actually
I I changed my name name now I'm talking
wait
I changed my mind
[Music]
but now you're going to be Lava too
careful about missing their life
I do have to use Dodge a lot of people
going to do this job
when it's
and I need to
think for that thing good thing I can
actually get rid of a lot of enemies but
is it is it was this enough
no it's not
how many how many more doing four more
uh no I kept probably not doing that
challenge
you are close
I don't think there are anymore I think
it's really
I have to come back here
when I have that
I have to come back when I have the
other ability
so I can
do the other challenge
and I can do one of them but I don't
want to do that because I have to do it
again
that'll leave now but I have three orbs
here I can get back
Dragon Boy
uh hi Dragon boy I'm a boy or a dragon
I'm not sure which offends me the most
but if the bagpipe music destroys the
rock of the uh of the temple that was
called I think how doesn't it destroy
the rocky creatures
and why can't I can't they use their
that pack even if they are aiming their
bagpipe music at the temple
why can't they use it against the rock
creatures
in trouble with this door but I think
some orb power might unstick it thank
you I actually have collecting good
amounts I wasn't worried there
oh I need some help actually
I'm gonna move on to the next level
to be fair they may maybe they can only
play it once and then need to reach
charge their powers
like it's black as if it were a video
game
everyone seems to think your Spyro is
division Maybe
yeah and a dragon and purple
and fire breeding that's the worst part
no
and a boy
I mean sure you shouldn't assume
someone's gender like
okay what's the point of this one
platform
not like I can get up there anyway
but I wouldn't if you're going to assume
maybe you shouldn't assume that pom pon
is male or the female
that's kind of my point
maybe they're not as smart as you I mean
yeah they are they are not these
emphasis are stupid magma kills
and let's see there are
three orbs two of them actually should
be able to get
that's good
finally some orbs I actually can get
I need something to drink
no
but by connecting from 10.
looks good
I mean these
all right
they are so quick
that's a lot of pressure
it was I mean you did
you saw the treasure
uh in The Scorch was the name of the
level the Arabian level with
with all those Rockets oh thank you for
opening it for me why was that so funny
it's not like I can have opened that one
myself
so where am I going now
I am
going over here
checkpoint
oh that was close
budget
and I could touch that one too
so
and I managed to fall down
as much trash as possible
and this path
and yeah and these baskets are
wiped on them
instead of purple
they match Pom-Pom
why did I manage to fall back now I need
to get up again
and for anyone confused
about
because we got uh quite a few a few
people now
it's probably obvious from the title of
the screen but maybe not everyone read
it
but yeah I'm not allowed to use fire
and pressing the play button doesn't
even do anything
right completely disabled it
I need to get over there
and that was quite easy to do actually
now I gotten other Treasures
now I can continue
well done
one more there we go
moving very fast
it does
she's a bunny she's she's meant to be
quick
as a rabbit
oh treasure and pumpkin loves pressure
and I meant and by that I mean both
company in the game and me myself too
you're free to give me as much dishes
you want
I take Ruby Sapphire
and our diamonds and what boy you have
come here
just I
may be
that first
if I access it okay exactly
I actually didn't know you could do that
this is a very cold volcano called okay
now that's the name of it
so this is a funny challenge
which I'm not upgraded
with all my treasures
are you saying that you don't have any
treasure
so I need to follow these oh yeah
exactly I already failed
created this game
I should have not hesitated why is it
okay
and I hesitated again
and I've oh yeah I was supposed to count
the number I have I
I missed that one I have seven I meant
six before
eight
nine because you can see Hunter's score
I think
ten
thank you Hunter you could have given me
this without playing your stupid game
yeah or you can just give it to one
point you're stupid
I I will tell Elora all these stupid
games you're playing
she's going to get mad at you
you don't seem to care about the airline
you care more about
uh I thought he was going to bother me
I got tricked I I got I forgot camping
again
I got six
wait seven
I am behind I'm not doing it this
I said I'm gonna pray for this hey
nine
or is it where is it
pick it up
10 11
12.
I wish you'd reach 15.
this one
all right what's the start
I was too slow
starting
we both have 13.
he has 49
14 15 I won that was very close
thank you Hunter
appreciating my cuteness
I got both orbs I could get
no thanks to Hunter
that was super close it was I'm not good
at that game so that was Challenge and
it doesn't even require a flame
for a potential I don't know if I wanted
to no I will do it uh no
a run with no charge button that
challenge is probably gonna be
impossible
hello everybody
is that how you see me as a customer
is that all I am
I didn't I don't even need this thing I
only needed to move it down so
much
amazing
so
let me connect the trash around this
area first
I don't know there's more here
oh that looks a bit damaged
so that's probably
now
to climb the volcano
without getting hurt
first I need to get around to this part
here
here I can find
out and now it's closed
in the lid on the volcano
there was nothing
actually it was pretty simple you should
try it yourself
okay so I cannot do this challenge
still
not this time
wait
that didn't work
because I like cats
images
what's there anymore
it looks like it looks like I got it got
them out
I want to fly on top of the volcano but
there is a limited height
soda
that went pretty well
three thousand and five
so okay
the plan was to stream in three hours
looking at the clock it's
been three hours soon
so
we do it around final level
still on the one who never left to do as
well
yes yeah
no one's been
the little castle
nope
and then I'll do this level which I
should be able to do because I'm
pretty sure you can charge the trees
I am a pretty
I need to continue that sentence
um
and then
let's do this level
I hope it
spent too long
and I'll run over there
all right that was a large tricking
there we go
give it up pretty funny thank you
and nose
thank you again I guess I just nothing
definitely
this level has some Bloom to it I like
they call it not blue that was a wrong
turn uh
depth of field definitely correct
ly to knock it down
eat it
suddenly
Rose Part
how did you survive
oh yeah I can't charge ghosts good
I'm not sure if it's not
like uh spirits of some sort
oh
thank you
Levy Jackalope for the follow
hello
how do you enjoying industry
and I was also realized that I forgot to
thank you for the follow as well
three hours too late but
I ran in front of it
oh yeah I charge it from behind
it was
there was nothing
some kind of a genie I guess
ounce
so
um
also I realized your name is Jackalope
that's
one of those rabbits hybrids
but I
but a few rabbits here
foreign
can I reach that one
that is the question
do I have to cheat yeah I don't think I
can read it there's nothing to me to
step on
the varsha goods
yeah I have to cheat
so I'm not allowed to use the B button
as it shows up here
but I have to do an exception because
all right I cannot even press the B
button
but they do have a reserve button that I
can press in this
extraordinary moment
when the game doesn't let me proceed
without me actually using the flame
button
because I do need the Talisman so
I'm just going to pretend like
but yeah I can catch these things that's
no problem
still not a
17 yet one more minute
this one as well
I'm happy
I'm I'm actually feeling better
as getting this dream
back into
people
talking about random stuff
and
so we're out there
but that means I actually have to hit
them they seem to be
I was going to say slow
the speed varies
so close
shake it
that's one
so you usually use the flame to catch
them a little earlier
you're doing great Downstream that's
that's really interesting here
if you are enjoying your time here
okay
I do want to be entertaining as well
and hopefully yeah I need it collect
these Treasures first I like Treasures I
wonder if instead of not using the flame
button you limit yourself to a limited
amount to use this for level since some
collectors require this use that is our
sun idea
yeah this level requires one use to
complete it
but the
first level which is the
no I can't
I don't remember what it's called but
for some reason is this where they make
those
those living wooden sculptures
that level how many times do you do you
need to rescue them and you have to
Flame to rescue those
and they
so that would be the minimum amount so
far at least
that I need to press the button for a
given level
I don't remember it was a four times or
five times so maybe it was only three
times
this one is annoying
oh
I got stuck on the edge
so I now put a final one
so I happen to know
yeah peacock
P foul
[Music]
um
so let's see if I can catch this one
but of course and now I am using
the least amount of flame uses just
requires the level at least
at least that you you make cute efforts
you think that's cute
like that froggy noises I did last
stream
which I don't find too cute
is it like help me there
yeah it is certainly got some depth of
field if that's going on here
that's all I can do for now
three minutes past the
that's not the skip button
so
that's the
bat
yes I found your asthma sounds very cute
I guess I'll have today more animal
sounds in that case
should that be my thing making noises
yes this is all the levels
no I don't know
whenever you're ready I'm ready
um
Thursday I think
if I get a stream to work on
so
let's cover that
I can't press the quit button
we'll see about that so
I hope to be able to play are we going
already just just the final words is
that on yes on Tuesday I hope to get the
uh that funny game I scheduled
previously for this week I wish I didn't
manage to get running I hope to get that
running next week
if I don't get it running I guess I just
play more spider
and
I don't know if I should move this
Sunday time two hours earlier or not
yeah I have that put in this okay well I
have that planned I have an update
schedule
but I don't know if I should do it or
not I do take feedback on that
because for me it doesn't matter I just
wanted it for to have four hour
difference between each of the three
streams I have
throughout the week
but I don't have to
now don't move sunnytime it's good where
it is okay I'll keep it as it is in that
case
so one thing I haven't done
is this uh raid feature that uh
twitch has
but no one is online that I follow so I
cannot use the red feature anyway oh
well I guess I guess that's that
uh okay
oh well
so
I should have checked that first before
I mentioned it one day I might be able
to use the read feature but I just need
to find more
why isn't there anyone streaming that
I'm following at the moment I need to
find more people
apparently
so
um that will be it for this dream and uh
just check the schedule for the times
because there's too many time zones too
and that's it
and yeah why and that's uh might be good
to know about that which if someone is
streaming you cannot access this
schedule normally but you can just put
slash schedule in the URL and then you
will get the schedule I don't know why
they've done it that way but
that's a way to do it at least
your stream was very cute thank you I'm
happy you liked it and
yep that's that's all for me
and I'm happy everyone showed up
anything else you want to say
before we
close down
I don't know how a long delay
I like bunnies yeah that's a good good
statement I guess you're here to watch
the bunny play
as a bunny
in
it will be more Panasonic used to happen
yes yes
okay thank you everyone for coming and
thank you for the follow as well
the two follow-ups
and
goodbye for now
and I don't know how to end stream so
