hello everyone

welcome kitten

Edge basically

oremian

and look at this

correct my check

it my

hydrate

a language selection screen

well that's not the interesting part

the interesting part is the game

I hope the volumes are good always let

me know if there's any issues with that

no polished trash polish doesn't exist I

have too many ads wait add still

in that case you can't hear me

[Music]

okay

[Music]

anyway hopefully

I follow

thank you for the follow

ing me anyway

thank you so much for following yes I

appreciate it

so

here's dogs which

is developed by Frontier and I don't

know which country Frontier is from

no I actually don't have a memory card

fun sounds good

and

oh yeah now yeah it's a lot of the same

yes

foreign

let's begin

hi I'm Jake and this is my life no

school no chores no clothes how cool is

that not sure oh yes it's great being a

dog watch this

starting off great

didn't wait a minute before they that's

lazy lately she's been ignoring me well

we'll see about that yeah I wonder why

yeah exactly

[Music]

oh yes she will be mine

Daisy

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

the country's full of bugs

I'll be glad when we get to Lake

minnewawa Wayne can I play with them

nice doggies for pity's sake Dwayne are

you nuts they're full of terrible

diseases but I like doggies way I told

you no

oh

wow

I want them to begin the game

they probably came look that good I mean

the prevented cutscene

but yeah it doesn't

hopefully maybe I saturations Daisy

a chest rescued Daisy but wow

I would give it

Hey Jake how's it hanging come on I'll

race you to the top of the hill

people are so insensitive but I need to

get back in shape if I'm gonna look for

Daisy hold on to your pants here I come

the smell of vision the pillar flight in

case that the boys carrying a balloon

I missed

us

I think that's a better

to jump

it's perfectly fine

let's go

press Circle start yes you can talk well

Jake looks like I beat you fair and

square hey that's Mr Jake to use

stinkfoot so okay do you want to play

another game are you kidding does a dog

poo in the woods okay here goes ready

Jake let's talk more action follow me

Jake

what is the race or should I follow you

good dog come on Jake

here boy

good boy Jake

[Music]

Mr cheek

yep real good Jake

Hey Jake what's up with you you okay you

look a little funny

the dog Nappers mentioned a place name

what was it again

mom says this is the qualities at the

south pole but I think he's cool

yeah they were going to uh

play with Lopez the Chihuahua maybe you

can practice your racing technique with

her I'm off to Gramps now

he's turning on the Anthony

evaluation

first person to you otherwise you can

use this mode to collect smells because

apparently you cannot smell otherwise

collecting certain colored smells allows

you to challenge other dogs all right

[Music]

oh yes life is good

thanks

donkey bones

I mean they probably want meat rather is

that like Burns Razor's status and to

perform better against our dog's been

challenging them

should I like

but if you want to 100 the game you need

to smell the vision

I know

collect all 80 green smells near The

Farmhouse to start the race against the

local dog if you win you can take

control of her

50 purples gets me a bone and the more

bones the better

I guess he explained it pretty easy

and basically I have to run around vice

versa not

music first gives me the idea of doing

eight yellows to play the p marking game

of course

so I assume you have played this image

but near my thoughts are not on that no

that are cute

play with ball

second account yeah otherwise I think if

you press it you drop it but if you hold

it you throw it that's pretty clever

simmer I did many years ago okay

but here's the thing in this game

see if we can make it print not

Jake shoots he scores two more to go

easy if you get thread position

and then

ah so close that's close

oh brother I need to practice

oh yes sniff my butt this dog is bad

this bone

the bonus at the party this challenge is

buggy I play this for about an hour at

my cousin's house and now he gets

explore the hell game or something

[Music]

so this challenge for some reason when

you save the game it actually doesn't

save that you completed the challenge

or is the loading part of this buggy

that doesn't know that you have done the

challenge so every time you save and

load the game you can redeem this

challenge many times any number of times

and you can still collect bones

anyway so I had the idea

coffee now get all eight and I can race

the local Champion hey there friends and

Neighbors

and so the idea was in another

playthrough that I would simply collect

90 Bones by doing that thing and redo it

is

90 times which would be a slow process

progress process

and I will be back okay let me know when

you're back

and

I could probably do like a Wednesday

evening

regular stream

in this place it come too high I think

[Music]

so

yeah and I wanted to see how this would

affect the game if it would break the

game or something

[Music]

okay let's do this

raised I feel the need the need to feed

nothing need to speed

raise the dog along the trail of dark

treats to win he was reach the Finish

Line first and have collected more than

half of this actually is because

obviously

this house races are

hey

One racer has a harder challenge than

the other is there and not that

collecting these streets is hard two one

go

let's do this

[Music]

oh yes I'm gonna win

does this challenge have iPhone off

yeah that wasn't important it must go

over some some kind of checkpoint before

they go like this

[Music]

Lopez is lucky the ground is a lot more

interesting up close thank you Miss

peaches always a pleasure to hear from

that girl could just cry I love to watch

other dogs doing my dirty work

you can use Chrome and like it came to

the ground

[Music]

delicious bon appetit

maybe that's another pun who actually

moved it

anyway should I collect more smells of

the red ones we wore Reds for a game of

doggy doo if I find them the local dog

shows me some tricks

[Music]

so anyway

[Music]

let's continue

finding marshmallows

now that has been done right

I have no it's one another one of these

[Music]

that's bathroom

horse

that is for a quest yep

boy now that's what Jake calls stinky I

saw something a yellow one yeah oh yes

smells like a basset hound I once knew

I'm gonna say something about harrismith

hey there we go nice

a peeing game let's mark the corners to

gain fields and show that dog that I

ruled

thank you

sense marking pee on the scents to

capture areas and square points Okay so

peeing and game

yep nice scent marking game

so I will assume Mark the only Corners

to capture the area

I have no words for this but you have

played this three

two two one go

[Music]

um

foreign

[Music]

yeah

rats how can this happen to a dog like

me how could this happen to me I

shouldn't think

whoa did something die

yeah

yummy ooh the stick

where's the last one now

this is

needed to be better a peeing game let's

mark the corners to games and show that

dog that I'm just playing this game

three two yeah go

[Music]

first

[Music]

[Music]

I just gotta find some of these

too fast it needs a click done and that

works

all right I guess

this one so yeah

versus three or something

even though that's not the majority

because it's three of six

[Music]

so

if I have three more

rent

and a lot of purple

there's that one

this one Quest

there wasn't a quest

[Music]

Lucy would be Queen

oh yeah

nice and clean

[Music]

okay now

oh man what a bummer my amplifier

batteries are dead like what am I

supposed to do hey dog dude bring me a

battery and I like toss you a bone you a

dick

I can dig for bones but this sounds much

easier yeah

it's nice fish is foundations find the

person who split between trains nah I

really find this stuff I mean I probably

need it first

another one but I already got this stuff

here

okay I give you a battery for iPhone

that's that's that's our trade right far

out dog dude but I need three more to

power up my ass but you didn't say that

it's bone City for you you didn't say

that he he said the magic word

that wasn't part of the contract

you're a rude man

[Applause]

where is my spy

oh I'm pressing the wrong button this

I wanted to do this

hey cut it out

whoa I dig where you're coming from man

okay

[Music]

that's the place acting like terrible

that's a high fun fun and chat welcoming

Moon

on

yeah wolf

wow you are one clever little dude dude

just uh let's see two more to get that

bone

uh

must have bones

actually I don't know if this Swedish

voice acne is better worse than English

they're probably at the same level

okay all right

you said follow his footprints

there we go

it needs my first team to dismantle him

to then smell the footprints I guess

they have found the foot please trade

for all the footprint to see where they

need okay

and then lead in multiple directions so

he has just gone somewhere I dropped off

the battery and then

sat down and play Let's see

I mean it seems to be level of

intelligence this guy has fair enough

I think it's still better than chaos

voice

I mean debatable

wait huh

he just was in here and just jumped

around this place and he just skipped

around on his rocks and then he just

forgot English

and here it is

so he's dropped this and just jump

around these rocks in one part yeah this

there's nothing more in here

this person makes no sense

that's what I expect from

person

you can't

keep a promise

[Music]

he offered a bill for a battery but now

it says I have to keep get four

batteries for one bone but that wasn't

part of it

agreement out of sight when I get that

last battery I'm Really Gonna wail

sometimes I ask myself is it worth it

I mean you only have one battery left

but yes you're right it's not worth it

he's a stoner probably keeps his slash

in that game

okay

this person didn't need anywhere else

does this mean that this first Prince

pass

leads to like

because I only found two others can you

can you give up I think I'll sit this

one out no you have to get up

[Music]

you're dark you should be able to do

this easy okay

well don't say this is for going to

trash

okay yeah I really collected that one I

don't really think it's this one

[Music]

and why he's running around this Farm I

don't know

does that mean that the other pass

just like

wait there's there's something up there

I'm blind

look at this

too cool dog dude you are the man here

you go

yeah thank you finally

three more bones please

[Music]

I don't remember all the comments

[Music]

yeah whatever

[Music]

in this game makes sense in the game so

let's think on it too hard I mean

your grammar makes as much sense as

these games to be fair so

I have to

kill your grammar here

nothing in this game makes sense

so let's not think too hard on it there

you go I think I did coded your message

boom inhale

werewolf yeah do you eat bones all right

um and let's not think on it I mean your

sentence was worse than just

there's

I think you're funny

you should you should chat more

yeah wolf is munching on a bone and

inhaled it see what you have caused

with your funny English and you're

supposed to be a native speaker here

anyway collecting so should I should I

go for 100 or should I try to progress

the game quick game that's up to you

you all

as you can't really see far

[Music]

and then also how certain parts of the

level I think I sent the music 100

you're 100

because I mean I could honestly go back

and understand the game it's one I'll be

crying all right

listening to that voice act I would say

speech 100

exactly

yeah that's that's fair that's fine

no not speed grinder

I just came I can't have to

kid

I mean considering the voice acting I

should play it again 100 Hey Jake I've

been expecting you Gramps is drooling in

his sleep again can you bark him awake

nah

nah oh Jake that ain't Fair

take you bad bad boy

yeah hey I was dreaming about the

Clarksdale cheerleading team winning the

big mud wrestling competition Yes siree

Bob of course oh sorry Jake

dog-napped go back to sleep Gramps

she'll turn up soon

a delay

[Music]

Allah in this case

of course

because it's been an hour already an

hour

they will be ads for

non-subscribers

I will go around and find more of the

purple smells because it should be fine

I will spend the following three minutes

looking to find a way

patient Flagship Park mini hint display

[Music]

still confused about the last purple one

hey I'm back this is Hiram J chicken

pluck

no chance

[Music]

just annoying answer that some

characters have purple smells like a

size purpose button here but that's

certainly not

yeah here's his smell

not what I'm looking for and that must

be the

guitarist smell

and that's

another smell I accidentally left there

it wasn't my intention

and there was no smells in here

yeah that last one is

[Music]

the last one is hard to find

so

[Music]

started as well so hopefully the ads

should be over now

oh yes eat my dust

[Music]

it didn't count

what a stupid game that was embarrassing

I need more training

[Music]

I wanted to do a nice celebration but

apparently they didn't count

I suppose you think this is funny

[Music]

it's gonna need to collect these smells

again because

[Music]

do it properly this time then

the game wants to be that picky feel the

need the need to feed three yeah go

and even though

yeah how about you not

I can't believe it

third largest weights patiently and let

me just yeah

I'm gonna win yeah

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I feel years younger how cool is this

[Music]

oh come on

Snooki am I glad to see you I'm going

nuts in here

hey what gives

dear Mary Jane well this is so cool

you're smart puppy Snookie here have the

spoon

what's that all it said

message

bones who could live without him

that is true I wouldn't be able to

really live without my bones

[Music]

probably not what he meant but it's

still true

find eight of these I can do the digging

challenge

oh a deacon challenge

I bet he's digging that challenge

okay what a doggy game dig holes nice

that the dog was able to get the note of

the roof that wasn't on the roof it was

a was like clothing above her

let's say the note fell down

each dog has a trade of coins that they

must take

they witness the dog who reaches the end

of its digging Trail first three okay

two at least this game is four

[Music]

I'm like I can't get the other race

like

what hat fans and I mean I did collect

the most but I lost the race because I

can't jump in everything doesn't count

but did the other dog win or was did the

dog also lose that everyone lost

[Music]

yeah let's hear in this art

I heard like 20 in here

we're trying on first grade trolley

starts

I think I went down the mission with

that dog so I don't think I need to

Olivia

[Music]

oh wait I do need this time

[Music]

I was wrong

because I saw something here

[Music]

broken glass and one pack

pain is that what you call it

[Music]

yummy

nothing related to Burns this is just

yummy

bunny

astronauts welcome

fun to see you here look I'm I'm a dog

now

and I have Dogfish I do like

no wait I don't like it I was going to

say I do like how they have considered

that dogs aren't actually like seeing in

black and white

they are actually a red green blind but

this isn't red green blindness this is

just full color but the colors are

minted

[Music]

look at that yeah I like to feel it no I

don't actually it's not a proper filter

because I can still tell the difference

between red and green here

so it's not correct I would have liked

it if this actually was

proper red green blindness

because not only could they teach the

whole thing about

dogs having red green blindness

oh here's a cat

the naked cat I don't know why the cat

is naked

well at least you have your notes which

apparently makes you happy

we have a meeting goodbye baby in the

treetop when the wind blows the cradle

will rock no wonder the kids crying that

is one scary song oh Brittany if only I

knew where you dropped your doll

three two one go wow

[Music]

oh yes I'm gonna win

yeah

I'm just going to look for some pink

smells

oh yes smells like a basset hound I once

knew one more

one more smell there you go

perfect

[Music]

I didn't see anything

very Swedish theme Here

it's gonna say they are inside each

other now they're right

they were just very close to each other

thank you

[Music]

not that I need to pick up the magenta

because the thing I said

not killing

and thank God no there must be a

different place where you can go up

because I have played this game before

so I remember some some things about it

I don't remember all the details and

also running across streets like this

doesn't seem like a good idea

I smell Underpants

and that's the only smelling this about

okay

why can't you walk up just tell you good

dog

wasn't that hard was it

then that's gonna start

no it's obviously not armed Much Hunter

smells

yeah I'm more of them

here we go here's more of them

thank you

I should have hidden somewhere in here

[Music]

obvious hiding spots

okay nothing more there

oh

nitrates

foreign

[Music]

I have trouble finding dress but I guess

they will show up as I

do the other stuff

anyway

The Edge should be over now I have

collected certified pink smells so let's

continue doing the rest of you

yeah so we got some auntie I knew I

would find more pink ones when I was

collecting other smells let's get some

pink well no some yellow ones

for the other ones the p marking thing

this is so slow always

hurts

if I need to find some food

before I find all these smells

so here we go is more like mini Wawa

calling relay station I mean please Lake

minnewawa calling relay station come in

please

someone is not getting an answer

okay I need

it's a Disney dog oh here we go here's a

person

I don't lay down

be sure

no he thinks he's cute

where's the dog catcher quick oh hello

dog

okay so it has cost me oh

I guess I go uh what did he get hurt by

it anyway

it was only 15 second ads don't stress

oh what it should have been three

minutes

sure I guess he got less of it

flavoursome yeah I really don't get uh

these twitch stuff works

anyway and Jake is at full health so

let's do that yellow mini game which

whatever it was

says twitch instead of having like

[Music]

three minutes

per hour

now just goes through the three minutes

and then there's something let's mark

the corners to gain fields and show that

dog that I rule three okay an hour free

of ants go

I know

[Music]

I want to change my time

this is

[Music]

like this

so I will continue

up

you can do it yeah nicely built that

ramp here

oh Birds

[Music]

on the phone hmm bones

[Music]

there's something in here

look

belts I should take one to that girl

she wouldn't mind me getting a brand new

one right

[Music]

you're right

bring the stores open and as far as I

can see no one is in here working so

that no one would even notice that I

will take it

oh

ouch

I don't take damage again

yeah this game is a bit

okay so this slippers

nothing

I got something

let's use it no I took damage again

seriously

they usually Jake

[Music]

no that was the first one what

what oh it can't be I wanted to do this

what's that oh no it can't be okay you

don't care anymore

maybe I should

I shouldn't bring more birds to the

restaurants maybe that's it that's the

wrong idea

two pictures for the two that rumbling

stomach is starting to get scary

can't be nice food here oh the code is

back

the code is back

haircut something doesn't dispers want

this

it hurts quite yo nothing but rats with

wings

it burns

don't take this

I'm gonna take this

or whatever

[Music]

this game is so strange

but but like

wow you're quick today Dan the man so

what have we got lined up for the good

folks of Lake minnewawa bro okay so I

cannot use this to

Dr voice was interested but these birds

are not interested there are

people that shoot you pastel okay he

cares birthday

okay I got the cheese papers don't you

want it

well

I wanted to print hey chat do you want

else

if it's not for this person Jake is

starving again

[Music]

he seems to be healthy

[Music]

I'll place it down here I'll see the

First Watch

he wears the back again

you see cats

[Music]

I'm a cat

[Music]

I just want to eat you

I'm back welcome

let's see this

here we go now the cat is healthy superb

okay maybe that wasn't good for the cat

[Music]

our number

4821 is that a reference to something

that's back

Ethan's back really

I'm sorry I did you came back in the

wrong moment

you weren't supposed to see that

[Music]

help

I'm traveling

that stupid box was delivered here by

mistake can you move it out of the way

all right

and talk about something I owe you one

so here's some free advice but avoid the

local dog catcher they say that dogs

will get sent to the pound and never

seen again

wanna earn a bone my kid brother went

climbing and now he's stranded somewhere

out on Mount mini Wawa

find him I mean sure look out for the

dreaded rolling rocks but like looks

like I'll never unravel that dog napping

mystery ah well I can't refuse the

chance to have a little fun

he is a bone for getting me out of there

yeah yeah please tell us what I wanted

for all this time

exactly to get a really nice but also

the dog was captured

but it's got three missions to

the red one yellow one

it was the blue one

so obviously I cannot get all the red or

yellow ones eight pinks for a Pursuit

challenge the pink that was extracted to

me yeah obviously I cannot do the

challenge all the Reds red I'm going to

call them red

yellow and unless I'm free the dog

but

does that

does that mean I could connect all the

blue

what would happen then if I don't read

the dark

or display something completely

different are related to the dog

I see

like these challenges that dog's trying

to get away I can catch him

try to catch out the dark before it's

time last night okay sure I can do that

one let's go

jump shake jump

not from need to stop don't jump now

where did we get up here

universe

we were down there before

yeah the targeted fast

I think it's kind of fast but what's the

units we're talking about here

[Music]

[Music]

okay he's fast

I got plenty of time but

I'm losing the turkey

there we go now you're stuck

no no I had it stop

this is game you're playing

come back

here's your Pig and

reach

[Music]

and you're supposed to get tired

[Music]

okay

you can only run for like 20 seconds and

then you get tired you must stop

make any sense

back here

now I have here you have nowhere to run

oh now stop

I opened that counted even though I'm

basically scraping the side I feel ten

times stronger

okay still don't know what I'm supposed

to talk either

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

ERS let's go let's go okay I'll try my

best go

[Music]

this part

[Music]

seven points

it didn't give a lot of points 15 yeah

the bigger than it has more points again

because I got more than

that

large area is much more than this is

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

that's

[Music]

apparently it worked

uh the watches are back welcome back

everyone I know the stream has been a

bit weird

but we got time left

and also

wait what what's this bone that was here

supposed to be like under this

because I usually stream for three hours

I don't need to only stream Studios I

could do four hours well Blues gets me

about I can't boy do I need is that we

collectively send another one because

this one like all the three cents Before

Time Runs Out you get a small amount of

extra time for each Center but it is the

pilot ones but instead of all the others

[Music]

it had nothing to do with the dog

and therefore

it was not locked in with the dock that

makes sense look at this Two bows and a

very strong smell wow fantastic

fantastic where's my bon appetit

I'm waiting for it

hello how are you welcome

Laos

mikelson

Kimmy give me give me

it doesn't didn't mark your messages an

email message on the chat welcome

welcome

dog

now it's pumped on the dark duck

I'm just running around

finding stuff

[Music]

and collecting bones because that's

that's what dogs do apparently

I haven't seen a single dog do that in

real life but

I like it a lot hydrate but I don't have

anything to hydrate with at moment

should I take like 10 seconds and

get it delicious

probably

don't let it says something like

anyway

[Music]

okay as requested give me 20 seconds or

something

and I'll get the

[Music]

[Music]

and now looks knocking

do you think everything I am back one

place gone no I'm I'm back

how how long did that take

there wasn't much left in this

um

whatever you call it

yes the time

[Music]

so hydrate

again back to the game

less than 10 seconds maybe I wasn't

Counting

wait why is he moving

okay I'm ready

confirm that one

okay let's see

now the music is this creepy music again

okay there you go down on safe grounds

another bone

it's late yummy

why is it why was that sticked down into

the ground

a lot of pink we should print a lot of

ink

did you call them magenta or something

and start

or purple Maybe

oh whoa careful now dog

don't want to die

back to the Happy music again

away from that Skinner place

oh there's more up here

oh yes nice and stinky does it and

mountains okay sure

let's go to the mountains

oh it doesn't bleed anyway

[Music]

nice

it won't move okay so that's what I need

today strong dog tour

hello dog do you want to help me

meow meow

yeah sadly this isn't the cat game this

is the dog game this is the woof woof

Let It Go

and back to Jake

it's Jake time

okay

the responsiveness let's be careful and

walk carefully across

[Music]

let's jump oh I almost fell off

jumping down beside him it that would

have been terrible

where's find the human

I don't know

we care about him

we only care about Jake the Dog and

ponponed upon pond

it doesn't seem to be anything down

there anyway

let's continue to the

it wasn't even a thing there

Flames through the whole game first

person

if I'm not super alert I'm gonna get

squished

doesn't sound like I need from them

okay maybe that would be a problem

what kind of place is this where

Boulders just fall down from the

mountain like it's

would be interesting to see in real life

it does be quite scary

there are many missions to do in these

areas

just bones silicone

somewhere in the Candy Kingdom

is that a reference to something

thank you

[Music]

this mountain

isn't that in Zelda and isn't that

does it also have Boulders falling down

honeylicious

they're spreading around the Bands

I'm not over the place

[Music]

I smell Underpants

[Music]

that's what it's all about

um everything is I mean I guess he's

correct about that actually

okay can I make this jump

[Music]

very happy music for this area

I like it like compared to the

[Music]

other music in the other area

[Music]

[Music]

what's going

and I guess Zelda is another franchise

back up back up

close close

I did it whoa that should clean out my

sinuses I did a bonuses around what it

Yeah Boy take this hat Big Brother no

the cable car operator and show him the

map of my location inside yes I will

take it to the cable car operator

there's no problem how to do that

wait I don't think you should lay down

no I yeah wait

if it's only your leg hurts I don't know

maybe maybe like actually

don't know maybe later on inspired

[Music]

um

yeah

that's because like the snow is cold but

at the same time the wind is cold but

maybe you have more heat transferring to

snow which would be worse

doggies start your call the doctor yeah

three only two more this time one go

come on

being one ante makes it impossibly mean

one hour

at least I had to put some effort but

possible

still annoying that missing yummy

wheelchair I did it

dance

Spanish

anyway

I miss I'm missing a pink one

[Music]

I also feels like I'm missing a bone I'm

doing one of the challenges

take it easy there jumping out with a

whole step

that

don't forget the Hat

oh yeah he put it

[Music]

he put it in the hats

I didn't I wasn't paying attention

whoa how'd I end up here

Jake got squished again

after this game add us

to face running

I don't know if that's the correct term

but when you can

when you're inside because the spider

game okay I did that again is this an

out of dog experience

now you're in a dark experience

[Music]

anyway

[Music]

when your Instagram obviously you can

see out of it without obstruction that's

the normal back face calling as they

call it which most games have because as

far as I know it reduces the performance

because they don't have to consider the

back face of every

polygon

but this game doesn't defeat that means

that when you're inside

a boulder like this you see the inside

of it

you know the inside is the back face of

each face

okay let's see

now I actually have to climb up

[Music]

they curve around that corner

okay

[Music]

oh yeah you can wear hats

how'd I end up here it's speedrunning

technique okay

I did that intentionally

I just need to find a way back

thank you

that's that's how you

speed around the game

for 100 completion

[Music]

they took damage at least if I get the

phone

uh get full house again fun funny smart

I mean I didn't do that intentionally

okay

my girl is a person my brother's

climbing hat good human clever human

he looks like he was afraid of picking

it up

there's a map inside now I can call that

rescue helicopter how is he holding it

but now the question is should you lay

down in snow or sit up to conserve your

heat

a bone in my pocket in case a strange

dog provides a vital clue that aids in a

rescue please take it my trousers were

beginning to smell

a very specific situation to have a bone

so long boy have a good day and watch

out for that dog catcher they say he's

shipping Strays off to Boom City

okay

Simply the Best

Simply the Best so I forgot uh

I I'm still annoyed that I'm missing a

single pink one but I can't hold it

coming I don't think I get for like 100

so is it

this Mission I might have to do to

trigger the boom City

at a train

the pump on being silly let's just try

to take a shortcut okay

I just wanted to jump down and it's now

he can land in the snow just fine but no

he just died

he died in the air even

more pink ones

that was quite the adventure sure fun

but what are you trying to imply here

[Music]

I don't like much

you're suggesting

because this should be a there's this

let's go

here

[Music]

to my cat I want to pick you up okay I

should go on the other direction okay

let's go again

[Music]

yeah never mind

[Music]

without

him

you know regards that's the point what a

chat

now I'm just running around my

quietly I'll just attack again

[Music]

I can't pick up the kids or something

excess okay

yes no don't jump just feel down okay a

single person

[Music]

[Music]

that one smells a bit more confusing but

[Music]

I was able to do it

[Music]

at least it wasn't slippery like the

eyes bone alicious but there's also the

uh

sign mini game wow wow

you're about to keep away

take it easy with the car

[Music]

oh yeah yeah not yeah you're not

implying anything you just you just a

little kitten meow meow

yeah I think

I think you're onto something I can I

have forgotten what it is

I guess you're right I am silly

there's nothing here

can't go up here but I want to

I I did actually nuts

I did not expect that

where wait I didn't go after this thing

there might be something up here

I saw I see something

[Music]

and more pink like mini Wawa calling

relay station I'm in please Lake

minnewawa calling relay station come in

please

okay

this person wants something like maniwa

calling relay station come in please

sometimes

and I'm using Prosperity too much

calling relay station come in please

come in please

well take it easy

telephone lines are down and this darn

radio isn't transmitting must be the

antenna again how can I send my message

well how about that's beating the stuff

up so angry yeah how about you if the

cable car is running I could go up and

check the radio antenna yeah maybe you

should

I mean seems like a good idea

let me eat this oh apparently all right

continue the camera focus on it it seems

pretty good if the cable car is running

I could go up and check the radio

antenna he's smart enough to understand

that he should do that but he's not

smart enough to actually do it oh he's

just lazy

[Music]

I mean obviously eating plus that I

should do it

but but still it's very very tired

you're missing a pink one again I'm the

king of Bones this will be like taking

candy from a baby

one go

oh yeah it's a deep one

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

equipments exactly

okay

so angry

you make Mexican

these lines go straight through the wall

you know what I'm so far ahead so I'm

actually gonna go around the world and

also again cheating if someone wants to

my path

[Music]

I said having some kind of mini game

like this between players could be

interesting

need the multiplayer mode

up down

I guess so I'll go to my idea is that I

should go to Boom City and then I go

back here and check that out later or

something for like completionist I don't

know

should I

[Music]

think it sure smells the birds love it

so

picking up this bone

[Music]

bones that's what it's all about but I

still want the last pink one

where could it be it's not there

[Music]

boom

which I actually have to dig for it

bones that's what it's all about

it's all about

with your pink spots how am I supposed

to tell the difference

we'll explore this area

foreign

oh yes life is good

oh you can't jump up two of these that

gives me an idea

still keeping the first person view

because I might stumble upon the Pink's

mouth

which is also a reason for why I play

this game a lot in first person

because otherwise I don't see the smells

because in here there was a lot of boxes

stuff

[Music]

and there are two boxes yeah look at

that look at that please oh yeah yeah I

see something

when I see something

I'm putting an empty Storehouse evidence

of a Murder

wait

here it is

now I just need to figure out how to get

down

so like they murdered someone with a

single bone

the person who was murdered had a single

bone in his body

Ruby

I mean it was like

50 pounds or something oh what a job

she usually jumps through that thing

when I got this man now so

let's go pick up that Bell

thank you Doris

[Music]

I must okay I almost don't I'm not

touching the street

bones that's what it's all about

is it going to say that every time now

oh wait go back

I'll be saving time

because this came across manual saving

living a world without the same I cannot

forget to say

[Music]

okay back to the adventure

hello Birds

I mean I got a lot of

[Music]

can I

press the smell button for the three

button that's the smell button 43 bones

that's the smell about the 43 buttons

okay

yeah yeah

I didn't manage to get rid of the birds

I didn't manage buying any codes

yes

let's continue training coming here this

was

that's not the one I'm looking for

[Music]

why are you taking damage from your

smoking upstairs

it is the train

what's the biggest the train then

I don't want to go to Clarkson and

Clarksville only had one train

as far as I know you're supposed to go

here to Boom City

so do I need to do more stuff

do I need to collect a certain amount of

balance before I can continue

[Music]

stamp this toe on the stairs Aya that

makes sense

key slope

oh man I want food yeah no problem

here's food I'm simply the best

[Music]

oh yeah smell time

[Music]

okay what do we have here

a boat hey you better go to the top of

the slope there's a kid up there looking

for a dog

they were

I'll give to the top of the slope

I don't know

that was a terrible attempt I should not

do that bones

let's speak weirdly

you have a boat

whoops oh no not again that's the third

hat I've lost this week my ears will

freeze for sure

not again maybe you should have um

what is it attention

yeah where is it going

copying this guy up up and away

assuming about it wait how

[Music]

what

the uh

the mountain it fell behind I thought it

was a huge mountain like I mean it looks

it's not huge but it's like large so the

head was like it's like the size of the

mountain when it fell in behind it it

wasn't a hard it was a military ever oh

yeah

[Music]

oh sorry

I've just no sorry I'm just here

there's something here

a camp here

charity cannot meet

empty something dogs can eat right

he said

[Music]

here's a hint

stop these things here

just it was a cat smelling

[Music]

okay

the UFO can change its size okay okay

okay yeah so the UFO was sitting his

head then it decided to fly away that's

why it's constantly that's nice likewise

many times and then it enlarges as with

it makes perfect sense actually I'll buy

that it makes more sense than I had

changed his face

and to be honest

considering this strangeness of this

world the loud Brothers

and Loud say hello Dad

oh it's hello

wait where are you over there we were

over here before what's going on

me and those boys are having a snowman

building contest

I'm on my way

children

yeah when she asked me to beat them

[Music]

Mall yeah that's that's a good word ball

I want them all them

white claw and Maul sounds like a

Pokemon

what do you mean

wow I guess small could be a Pokemon

but in that case it will be spot luck

m-a-w-l or something

small that Pokemon

hey maybe there's some coal in that Hut

we could use it for the snowman's eyes

or whatever bring me what you can find

because the age started while I do this

Miss pigeon's talking at you

I still love you yes I did it again

I just want to say can you please find

they hold can you find some more coal

please that just sounds artificial to me

thank you can you can you find some more

code please I know that's a sentence but

so hard for me to say it she put it in

the middle

head must be cold he needs something to

put on top of it he is cold

sure sure

he stuck the embodiment of code

can you find some more cone please okay

what

do you think

you see me

look at this diaper dog

we've seen a more diaper dog

[Music]

look at this beautiful Shadow he has he

has like a

that's not how Shadows work

his head's made of snow he's probably

feels warm

the to be fair they had could keep the

cold in protecting from it from the sun

it's not that he he's called any worms

is that he is

getting warm and smacking in style that

was a beautiful clipping going on

please that animation looks good

inches would make perfect arms can you

see anything else

all right anything else aside from

twinkle bronzes now I think you want

tweaks or branches what's the difference

between between a three quarter branch

very suspicious

why are the two

tweaks or branches just lying on the

ground here I wonder what these are for

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

thank you

the size I think

[Music]

wait did you drink it on the one I

picked up or the one I threw

brushes can't easily be broken by hand

but sweets can so tweaks are like dried

branches

am I getting you right

another

that's better though yeah there are

tweaks she said it was tweaks

you're stepping on it stop stepping on

it

[Music]

carefully waving that around

I think hey look at this beautiful

animation

stabbed her

what a nice celebration

hey Johnny

is it

Captain R Susie I guess you win the

contest but

the same way I'd come this

you go boy

couldn't have done it without you

okay Jake wants to win the contest then

I mean I guess there was two phones my

favorite three versus two in this case

a little bit there you go now you don't

face a cold when you're doing some

jumping

look is the Hat I need this hat give me

the Hat

I didn't expect this

um

he's the flying dog

[Music]

those are tweaks so tweaks are usually

on a few centimeters long there you go

that's what I think about you snow bed

so stupid

a few minutes yes it is like okay that's

what whoa whoa whoa whoa

boy now that's what Jake calls stinky

That's What I Call teleportation

I'm jumping so much I'm trying to

collect this sounds

what was the two pink ones inside each

other

you just felt the need to

do it

not me plus it's not on this never mind

it's floating about me so it's fine

[Music]

there are so many smells

[Music]

I don't like games with other jumping

that one has a better head now oh yeah

so now the competition has to be but the

competition is over Sandy

so

I think what they want hey take it easy

yeah

hey I'm talking cheating

up here up here

up here

I'm seeing stuff that doesn't make sense

sorry I'm in a race

[Music]

[Music]

or something like that

being

so let's see

okay the game is back

especially about the same now

[Music]

before the game actually precious

[Music]

I don't know if these issues is

specifically

um playing it on this Playstation 3

or if this actually struggles like this

on the original places until as well

there's something sometimes the quality

control is just bad in games

okay

I don't remember that song

the song is

[Music]

not here I raise my foot

I need food is hurt

live here

okay it's not here whoa

what are you doing Jake why are you

flying again

stop time

not a dog you're not a bird

[Music]

nice going ahead

[Music]

anyway let's continue

what happened I stepped on ice and I

just slipped down

like a fool

is there anything left I missed here

with this save point is over here

yeah yes or whatever is it tied again

seriously Jake

dude

[Music]

that would do some more speed

save

slip and slide dog

I mean if you step on ice

like that without knowing

although he is on four legs but Ibrahim

and that's pretty dangerous that's

whoa that went straight through me

I don't know how smells Works in detail

so I will not comment on the

accuracy regarding that comment

I need to criticize the game that that's

kind of part of my my whole thing here

that's what you do here we play games we

make fun of games that's

[Music]

right

[Music]

oh

and yellow carrots I think I know

someone who has a yellow coat rather

someone who doesn't have a yellow kit

at this very moment

now I don't want to kill them I look

scary

looks like me

terrible

Jeffy lives there

anyway let's continue

and if you can seriously take

Sasha

oops they're weird

hi there dog we met treats no seriously

with a treat

what's the point of view anyway

what's the point of him as they don't

give dog treats

[Music]

yeah speed running don't take damage

because you go slow

there you go

no eat the food there we go

which direction do you come from

I think I came from this direction

speedrun don't stop your toe exactly

yeah Cafe this is great please

I am starving wait why you just ate you

ate a lot that gave me how much food I

don't know yeah you're getting a bone

now anyway so

not to use it

after all yeah it was nothing in a house

for some reason

[Music]

mom taught me never to get dressed in

front of strangers so it's technically

saying she's two sandwiches short of a

picnic

oh I mean obviously they don't have a

toasty dress up animation then you

switch out the texture now could you

please help me track down my moving dog

from here

well I guess

my food

I guess what she means I guess what's

her mother man as far as that she

shouldn't

change in front of others

[Music]

but in our children they don't they they

are like they are they can't

they misunderstood what people say

sometimes

but it's a kill where are my dog's

collar then I saw this big red truck

driving she's putting on a car without

changing the entire outfit exactly but

she's stupid they say he ships Strays

like you off to Boom City

and she's

[Music]

and she's also technically saying that

my wife is supposed to do I didn't keep

pay attention to what she said because

she possessed

[Music]

there yeah

it's actually also saying that

[Music]

oh so yeah I need to okay so that's

what's in it I needed that mission to

[Music]

security train okay I see because that

triggers the dog character

yeah the chicken egg thing in the

previous one

as well

but that's the two missions I will have

to do for my

when I tried to do this and shoot the

breeze we

e with red radio is this really

necessary

nice jumping when I do the yeah

careful

seriously

they really need to release like a

PlayStation 3 version backing yikes he's

huge I need more bones before I go

toe-to-toe with him

yeah I mean seriously you go toe to

stairs so

I need three more boats

[Music]

he's gonna say

magic track can I ride with you

oh yeah

it took more damage

you're so funny I try to be funny and

please write the more so I have

something to comment on so I can be more

funny

so there is another mission here too I

am starving I know let's let's talk to

this point because he apparently as a

boat and I have about to pick with him

hey my brand new electronic helicopter

landed on top of that bill

but I think it's broken

and even with all their PCS and games

consoles they just can't beat

old-fashioned dog power

yeah don't think a piece it would get

that down from there I'm sure what

you're talking about dog

is you're like a boomer I know that's a

meme

these kids without

whatever pieces

and then they play with this

radio controlled

you're a special dog it's all the dog

catcher

no I will eat you you looking at me get

lost

amazing

this game is so buggy

can you find some more gold please now

what are you

wait list I need to carry the first one

step it dark and stupid Child come from

calling ever since tip everything is

stupid in today's game

and that's a stupid phrase too

can you find us some more curl please

[Music]

why do you have Jake's points

and the phrase would be

wow I feel the Call of the Wild let's

find that helicopter first though

yeah it is here oh it's working

uh

[Music]

there you go

this game does have a Swedish top so

thanks for getting my helicopter back

let's see here's a bone what's with your

voice that's bad for a morning's work

huh we're getting my haircut back

a bone

can you find some more code please

I need two more boats I don't need cold

but I should okay

okay let's let me check the antennae

and pain eye check out everything on

this level this this

actually it's just one more left

I don't like people don't count anything

because it's a it's so hard to tell and

also

here it looks like yeah I completed the

helicopter mission therefore it's full

color while the I have not completed the

other challenge therefore it's in sepia

but even though

[Music]

even though I will complete the second

one it will not be in color because

that's not how this game works

I don't think that's how this game works

actually because these two were both in

color but I still don't think that's how

this game works

it does

yeah yeah yeah yeah look it's not man

backpack the Snowman I think that one is

in sepia they say being Great Escape

monochrome

Maybe

it does put them in color if after

you're complete no

no I'd

do both of these yeah I did both of

these

I did both of these yeah there we go

that's the roof yeah the third day it

was just a coincidence that's the ones I

did was in color no they don't go they

don't show up in color just because you

completed

that could be a thing they could do but

they talked to it okay

they might have been it is possible

actually when I think more about it now

that I imagine the girls was positive

that they do turning color when you

complete them but the completion check

isn't probably a program for every

challenge Mission scene

I guess so far I've only seen missions

it's going green

is it Birds

I do have something but maybe these

birds will react on it

let me go and get it

so I was gonna say I need to find a

mission

in which I haven't completed yet which

does show up in color

I guess that's the next one

with my pink smells I need my pink

smells

this tree looks suspicious here

nice inside a lot of clipping going on

I guess there are no more space here

so the radio is jammed by a bunch of

birds sitting on the antennae and

I think so

I mean

they highlighted the birds for some

reason so it seems so

then I got to that bird singing that

doesn't didn't work at the restaurant

but I assume it will work here because I

think that's what is intended for

should I

and when you do a stream and if you have

what did it turn black did it turn black

on screen stream or was it only my TV

when you do uh

[Music]

let me see does it could respond when it

is a box here and as we know people love

putting food

place the pizza on the ground and then

you just put your cardboard box on top

of it girl wipers I need this

[Music]

change outfit this doesn't seem

appropriate for this weather condition

hydrate

but sure

[Music]

and try to I turn to remember it was

about the English more time to keep

voice throw away birds are not

interested in me

[Music]

looks warm I mean she does have a kiss

to be fair

and she was wearing a dress before I

guess the dress is a lot more vidy

so

I guess it doesn't change much

[Music]

thank you thank you

[Music]

oh

my God

anyway now I'm here I'm not sure why I

said anyway

s buddy

[Music]

I wanna eat them anyway

they're Birds

indestructment I think

I tried to press the charge button but

this talk doesn't have a charge button

can you jump over the fence

the way too deep there

why can't you jump over the fence not

even down here

[Music]

okay

good yes thank you

Simply the Best

Simply the Best

we had happened

a very simple check at the game could do

is that if you take damage but the

position from your previous basically

the distance you have traveled

when you took damage is very small such

as when you're walking upstairs or

something

in that case it will ignore the damage

as an easy solution I think

but that's like a

simple check he does to ensure that it

does the polishing correctly

and voices share the showing up on the

Shadows

they can also do like proper shadows as

well

it would be nice

[Music]

excellent the radio is working again I

wonder what happened yeah that certainly

was a fine steak dinner but what to do

with the bone

huh hear you bury this or something

what's the problem man

tastes great

yeah seriously this stuff is working

when are you beating up everything

here oh my gosh you're polluting my

workplace oh Sue

you'll be what

I mean first of you beating up your

workplace that isn't really helping the

hurricane

yeah

the nature

Craft Time Market did not get tasty

love that tables animation I

he's crazy

do I need I think I need that 50 pounds

the one more

look no that's not to make way

I want to look at the cat but I looked

after the girl and said the poor table

let's move on to

hotel that I forgot to check

let me check it out then

okay

I was in that one there we go no that's

the wrong one there we go

I just want to double check

yeah

whoa did something die let me

hmm

oh brother who cut the cheese

it's another one

I guess put it here in

Kai

[Music]

another one that's so many

very much stuff came away

put everything there sounds like a good

idea

[Music]

my latitude

49 or 50 yeah

good thing you keep track

I don't have to

I'm on the dog dog

and you keep track so I don't have to

apparently there's nothing here like 50.

and I said like

okay but there's a bone here

you don't have to do anything

bones my favorite but I could still like

wear those hats go to

it's better than this

excuse my sniffing attempt

it's hey there sweetie chops

are you talking to me are you talking to

me

[Music]

tonight is the opening of my Simply

Fabulous new act but I can't perform

without my adorable wigs can you find my

wigs for me sweetheart

again you're another person it'll be

worth it just to see this guy's fabulous

act you think so seriously

I think there's a heavy amount of

sarcasm in that but even the performance

is so bad so I can dance

by the way I found your weeks they are

right here I mean one of them was

literally up there as I entered this

place

it even would give it away

from my beloved wig on my tremendous

Talent will burst forth and all its

Guardians people out here are stupid

sad now I feel this strange urge to put

on a dog collar

I don't know

[Music]

[Music]

all right

but you judge that song what do you

think about it I'm sorry what game is

this now

it's on the dog dog

why do they need a dark color

it passes

because he likes colors

[Music]

yeah you're supposed to write the song

collect two more wigs and I'll throw you

a simply scrumptious Boney Maroney

Maroney

some people think I'm a dead ringer for

John revolta

Randy

[Music]

[Music]

to the music

[Music]

anyway what what do you think about that

song

I don't think the people like he's

missing by kissing that

also if I can't hear music like oh

Scooby that's scrum one more wig and

that bone is yours to own many tomatoes

they have them under the table

oh that other stuff is too loud my

sensitiveness

[Music]

anyway

[Music]

and then he gets all sensitive

anyway moving on let's see you know that

There's No Business Like Show Business

create music I guess

well bless them I saw this wig makes me

oh Shook Up

[Music]

but they're still doing

[Music]

he still try it he still named it was

hating him

[Music]

yes you want me to jump up

yeah I have campaign

give me something

[Music]

I'm confused

okay

believe that no no they were kind I will

not do that that she carrying people

like them

let's go to Boom City

and he stopped hurt or tyranting at this

moment

what's the fastest way

I think it's through that chain

the rat or Mouse is so loud in that

house I think they have a mouse problem

I mean astral Mouse is not here so

not the one

always astral being so loud in that

house

all right this is a ski slab that's not

why I wanted to go

at your tablet pass

I can just go around here and then I get

it

the cafe

that was easy

oh I can

the question was like do I need more

bones or do I need at least the same

water bones

let me check that so

[Music]

like if you have the same a lot of Bones

then that requires like a challenge

between them

there we go one more bill that's all I

need

what kind of check do the dogs do when

they

want to check the floating bone number

above themselves or something

I want to meet in the honestly it's like

I got 26 bones

well I only got 24 so do what you want

it's gonna say no mouse but now it's a

cutscene

I'm covered with dog germs

perhaps you may be in the wrong line of

work Wayne I'll mind your own beeswax

Dwayne

hello Dwayne speaking

well did you collect some nice clean

Mountain Dogs to supplement those nice

clean Clarksville dogs uh yes Miss

peaches excellent I must have only the

freshest most organic animals deliver

them to the boom City dog pound now can

I ask a question Miss peaches oh very

well if you must you're not gonna hurt

them little doggies now are you are you

questioning my genius you overgrown Ox

no Miss peaches

I think maybe he could use some therapy

someone has accidentally puts two ball

guns in the same place

Alpha pity's sake

wait look at last that sign was that

before

and after they start moving before they

move the camera

quality of this game is perfect

okay

organic dogs

aren't dogs organic or what are you

implying here

they really should have had two

platforms on Boom in at boom City

Clarksville and then they can have a

second train in boom City

because Bloons is all only has one track

let's

okay

apparently

anyway and then they could have you

being able to travel from the cities

straight to the first person

and maybe that's just

like exactly leaving shortly

with my PSP trying to come up with uh

maybe they should do yeah

the remake of the game

what a sequence

I'm a dirty dog Daisy wouldn't like it

what a dirty dog in many ways

and why did they cut out the music and

what the music cut back

lean as a whistle

by the way

what am I supposed

awful

anyway moving on

[Music]

being sprayed with skunk does not

prevent him from smelling our stuff

okay let's pick up these red ones into

your race great that's the sky I've

always wanted I did I did my best

attempt okay well the lady went in

organic milk so I don't understand three

she doesn't want plastic dogs okay

[Music]

I need to talk to you

there we go

it's pretty easy

wow I feel like an action hero in a

console game

well you are not

actually here

you are in a console game

pet is going to share around

speech

very suspicious bag

does it say anything on it

it says swaggy

um when does this game come out when was

the swag a proper mean

[Music]

and look this this guy is still naked

twag

yep that's what it says

look at this work was sent back

what is some of these smells location

makes sense

because people are really sick too

that's apparently what's how this game

works see the people are rude

okay

watch the corners

go

[Music]

disgusting dog yeah

[Music]

[Music]

sure

don't mind it

was 18 points

if I step in that you'll be sorry

I think you're the one

okay

oh I see I see

[Music]

um

so if you surround

I didn't even know that was a feature

2003 is when this game was released Okay

so

it's

the people are also smelling yeah

so because I know it's like swag

what's that thing on the internet

and I was curious if this game predates

that swag thing

I mean it obviously I reference

something else but let's just find it

funny they didn't have to write anything

on the bag anyways

[Music]

I still don't have the blue ones

but he's wearing the staircase here

which I didn't get to climb up before

the challenge started

there are some pink on it

maybe there's something up here

maybe there's a blue up here

and welcome to talking [ __ ] here on

boomcities cats

[Music]

quite the glow

now there's two guns

oh yes smells like a basset hound I once

knew

[Music]

pink ones I can get a circle in it at

the end of the game you'll find the body

of the bone that won't belong and the

bus needs to belong to someone

I think it sucks

but if I find the 10 remaining ones

[Music]

from where anyway

we'll take it easy Mr

I have a very bad feeling about this

it's nothing suspicious at all here

this purple smell in there but that

doesn't look like a regular smell

not the kind of smell I'm looking for

it

where are these remaining steps

oh there's one

they're hiding here

yeah I got a feeling that the level of

second end there

so

such frame drop

foreign

[Music]

yeah

wanted

oh you want something hey Pooch how's

about you and me track down the sleeping

Bandit he's a famous robber I hate that

punk my dog lost his sense of smell when

the sleeping Bandit doused him in

perfume

no wonder the sheriff's dot smells like

a field of daisies oh Daisy if only I

could track you down

this is the Punk's bag sniff it so you

can make out his scent and bring back

any clues you find I'll be waiting

sounds like Ma I got a job

okay okay let's see

so you dropped it and then just red

for his life

ran across the street like a fool

and here

apparently as we can enter this game

footsteps are not left on stairs only on

ground on asphalt um

concrete and wait what

he did like a

skip here

[Music]

and it has very very small feet I would

say

the sleeping Bandit must be sleepy

might be okay

[Music]

oh

shall we go in and check what's in here

it's a good idea

oh nice jump

more of those whoa whoa

that was almost a term

you can jump

now here's some cats for me

I'm gonna smell through here

we're out here for that matter

okay this thing is closed I can't go

through there then

obviously dogs can't catch okay I'm

ladders As We Know

[Music]

I think I've checked but now

so I need to get up there so I need to

assembly remove these

okay stop

wait he couldn't move

yeah you're gonna move that long

I don't hold too

and

the log is apparently heavier than these

foreign

[Music]

and also I assume these boxes are filled

with something because they are covered

if there are empty boxes that wouldn't

be covered like this

nice nice job

[Music]

when it's clipping too no jump jump over

come on you can do it can't do it whoa

let's talk about this first okay you see

this platform over here

oh it was empty

well stop stop stop okay

it was a m e

[Music]

gameplay

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

he's holding a gun

take that sheriff

did you have time something what the

[ __ ]

what is going on

oh the bags the sheriff says that a lot

apparently

both what kind of Animation was that

just choose a randomly pug has a

dangerous accomplish who's guarding

their bag of loot sniff around and see

if he can track him down

did it say

[Music]

s oh yeah thanks for running out with a

bell and a bag and everything

goodbye

oh the bag is gone that's what it's all

about yesterday

no my phone

doesn't mean I can enter that building

now from this

and are there any smells in here

[Music]

and also which I didn't trigger

if you do

wake up the bandits he will actually try

to shoot you

which is crazy but it is quite the

bench in the tone

all of a sudden I'm getting shot at

this clearly something in there

let's go inside one

um

give me a low death run on this key

and I've actually managed to die in this

game if you can't that's fine

let's attempt to have a set of stairs

would tell this I do like it when they

have details like that it's just that

this world is actually not for humans

behind the Stars

even though you can't jump up and down

the stairs

but it's very low to the ceiling

wow fantastic

yep you still haven't said Bon Appetit

yet I am disappointed and this is clear

the end of a very close

without a game that's disability

they found whoa that went straight

through me they're going to pound the

dots Maybe

impound the dogs maybe it's more correct

term

all right

stuff that smells are this is a shame

like

that and things

remaining smells inside the building

because I oh

I see that anyway let's see if

everything you find in the trash that

sounds like a good lesson for this game

prayer has been

impounds they're not cars

but but you call it when you put it

um there's one dogs in the pounds

wouldn't that be in pounds

because they're in the pound

this is requires me

hello hello hello and welcome to talking

[ __ ] here now I don't see ATS radio the

station I don't want to talk about

smoking causes

let's leave this place

what's that problem here

because if I do find a train to like

mini Wawa we'll be leaving shortly

[Music]

wasted

turquoise it's actually raining I

haven't pointed out I've seen many

points of that

so switch back

talking what such life

did it really say what I think he said

yeah they were talking about talking

[ __ ]

I didn't know you could walk on the

trains

oh there they are I think I'll sit this

one out

no you need to come down here

they can mean a Wawa yeah that's the

other place

I don't feel that

you should be able to go there and walk

all the way back to the lake meaning

where I work

this

got three more missing let's try it

again

[Music]

for examples

just fine a taste sensation

it's

okay let's see if I can

climb up here then

[Music]

because this box is like suspiciously

climbable

so okay so I heard that correct then

yeah I started the lake in Nicaragua

with a funny name

yeah

foreign

name

say the last pink smell is here doesn't

look good at me oh there it is

[Music]

the last third has been failed

[Music]

example champion Jack you can do it

the good boy he totally didn't break out

your bones but don't worry you're going

to pick up three new bows you can

install in your body

oh

what a fun name yeah Titi Kaka is a fun

name

I mean it depends on how you're supposed

to pronounce it because if you follow

the

Slavic convention it's a tititsata

act funny

look at this

sorry to see

these three bones it should be three

bones at least

bone-alicious okay

oh yummy yummy that was boring bones who

could live without them

you've got three chances to say

bon appetit

when you have paint you are a favor of a

dog

thank you

if I add funny we don't have a user here

called funny

and why didn't even treat you as a reply

it should do it that way

that is because you didn't write and

reply

that funny you are funny

so yeah that works that are really funny

and bad dog

pouch

yeah

that's the joke bon appetit

like kittens

it's everywhere

please don't get remember the cars be

careful about that dogs

what did you mean

[Music]

hey a streamer come here

Run Run free life

he is fast

we need to we need to learn my way

yeah there we go there you go

you're not you're not a clear note

it's quite okay

funny I was too busy laughing about

something I had a typo

[Music]

I had a type of sounds like something

no I'm the one changing you

[Music]

like 70 I need 70. I know about 58. and

that's how you trigger that apparently

to yourself to walk behind

that means I need 12 pounds oh that's a

lot of Bones maybe they should go back

and do something

[Music]

yeah let's go back

in time

back to previous lemons

I like this police car you just driving

around like crazy

that's what I meant to send go to the

cemetery

should I go to the cemetery was there a

cemetery

where's my dinner

hey who is this Garfield

wait he left his dog behind

oh poor dog did you only just leave you

behind

I mean it's always easy so I can control

it down but still the mission is over I

don't need the dog anymore

a train to Lake wow

it's not exactly how I said it but

almost

[Music]

yeah no I said a joke but ah

you want me to go to

the darkest Cemetery

I didn't fully stop eating full stop

wait what

I mean I stepped into train before it

stop but I mean

[Music]

I will take it easy train your lights as

you're as you're about to debate

okay the whole train is bubbling

Crazy Train

[Music]

do you have pink ones fight to find here

but

I want to go back to Clarks Hotel he

took damage by jumping over some benches

he's a stupid Train to Clarksville we'll

be leaving shortly

between the car locks that

he avoided to avoid that train you're

not sure what the train is doing in

opting around it's very reversing

[Music]

that doesn't seem safe

your hair is like two bones I haven't

collected in the Clarksville Center

as if this train is safe that's right

which it seems smooth

[Music]

here we have him

attack himself

[Music]

assessment

no it was a dog

he was smelly

anyway they might be because I didn't

get to explore this area because you

cannot automatically go

but I should yeah we can see it and come

up

come on

oh can I go around that spins

try to go around the fan this way

instead

did you put stuff here

look I can go into this thing

tada

this trend yeah they have a room for

like a train too

then abuse bill

their name is worth the rest of their

place

obviously they wouldn't be a train there

unlock the train to Brazil

's Town boom Center

foreign

and that must be for something

[Music]

oh I treated something

oh my gosh please don't hurt me you

terrible Beast here take this bone

this is steel bunny I mean there was no

one in the visible money but

it took something out of it I think

she's stealing money

then that's what sounds very happy to

have that job

Kimmy give me give me

in 19 minutes

the link to trade me the mama is about

to leave

yeah I hate dogs scram you before I get

my gun

before I get my gun I mean if you're

angry like if you don't like the August

and then yeah dogs and then you acting

that aggressive against dogs

that's what explain why dogs are

treating you badly because you need dogs

badly

it seems like an obvious thing but

people who hate dogs I guess they aren't

intelligent

I mean it's one thing to be

uncomfortable and stuff but like hate

[Music]

everybody experience and said that fully

understand like you have a traumatic

experience or something

the train to let me wait how how would I

say like then

even an article in the local paper but I

tore it up to use as Banning for my

chickens can you find it

where's the entrance

[Music]

he's such a small dog

the small dog is small enough

[Music]

I don't know there's no indication

[Music]

and yeah

now it says pick up what's going on

so okay I assume I should go in

[Music]

it stocks

yeah another press pick up and picks up

a random piece

just a random piece

and then I go in here

except one random piece okay she is

which one it is

a coincidence

they're going oh no I don't want my

status 2000 yeah

yeah

[Music]

it's the one or to the right

spread to like mini Wawa ski resort

that's where those creeps took Daisy I

hope this keeps you strong I reckon you

might need it hello didn't you that's

the permission we know there's boom

swell Town Place that's what it's all

about okay let's kill that fox

we don't need any foxes around here

there we go

foreign

[Music]

likes foxes

not a single person

joke okay so I need to catch the fox and

then they [ __ ] runs away because I

cannot pick the [ __ ] up I mean the fox

is really big so I think

I've been after that

since

disappeared

you earned it

back

Simply the Best

and there's something up here

apparently bone orific

you're not doing everything in this

level

now I have not done the orange because I

lost that one because I didn't think I

need to put as much as

a skunk

when I steal the orange I just love the

smell of toe jam in the morning

[Music]

whoa did something die

these are Fox Mouse okay I need to put a

bit more effort

problemo baby Jakey had Superior bone

power three two

one he has the superior Bond powers and

more than

one way these things are very strong

yes

this was bone this is a word for link

though

if you have strong bones

[Music]

that's basically the exactly the same

thing let's say say you have strong legs

bone alicious

so 72

[Music]

and there's a blue one and the blue one

are the ones you chase around

but there's a single blue I need to find

if the Fox Run Away here

I'm going to the cave

never find it behind out of the fox

and it's black

I cannot

find and killed two red foxes

proxies that I could well at least I was

worse than Fox one so

[Music]

this is here he lives in this brick

thing

that seems terrible

I should say

I haven't seen the number the Polish

word for bone is coached

okay

hey

successfully

wake up the egg it's time for an

adventure we still have to find a blue

one

look a skunk this is furnace

[Music]

I wonder why I have nothing to do with

that

[Music]

it's not my fault

did you before it fell off that's going

very easily two easily too far

I think

I just grounded it a bit and then it

just oof

a lot more fair

[Music]

you know

[Music]

okay okay

are you kidding no I'm not kidding I'm

serious

it's probably out of bounds or something

let me know how to bounce in other games

okay and I've only got six pink left I

still haven't found the blue

[Music]

I don't feel like yo

going in circles

[Music]

well in Spanish is hueso

why not

I mean

because you don't pronounce the age

[Music]

um

mute letters who keeps them in their

language

thank you thank you kitten I'm not

saying you're doing so good that this

came at the moment I'm confused

[Music]

it's a skunk again

[Music]

doesn't have any fur

I must be able to pass

foreign

[Music]

probably somewhere obvious wait there's

something here I found something

I am no longer confused

one more

three

two one

zero

I titties

or naked skunk maybe the skunk should

have been evil in the first place

I have a very bad feeling about this now

that I just have something about me

the skunk is living happily without her

[Music]

yeah

no idea

Jake loves bones where the blue

asparagus I'll just ignore it then

it needs it anime

there's still like 10 more bones this

way to connect is this the this is

chicken farm

so

and what's turquoise smell from this

talk what does that mean

there's still like places I haven't been

to I think

I'm going to the wrong way

I don't know if you could continue that

path

wait I should have it maybe I should see

something

on my travel

[Music]

it is 70 foot next time yeah but then I

need more bows after that

yeah I feel it unnecessary to go to that

area hey go through the 70 bone and then

get stuck after 90 bone which is

the right after

this one smell in this area missing like

I haven't been to the waterfall I can go

there

it should be easy to collect a few balls

in the waterfall

yeah come

it's not working me a lot waterfall

please ignore me

whoa don't step in that all right step

in without chopping wood and now I can't

find my ax oh what am I gonna do

well

this sounds like a job for super Jake

yeah I'm just trying to take second your

ass

so yeah maybe he left a footprint trail

when he lost his ax I bet I could find

it now I said I

anyway I've been the same since that

tree fell on my hand Now where's that ax

okay so now it's an ax

I found it funny when it says ice

here

like

maybe the other types of bags can

convince them

there we go they're a clean dog

I'm gonna see what is going on here

there are fish in the water

species and they're jumping really hard

but finally connected to smell

the reason waterfall there is a

waterfall

I know

eagle

[Music]

it's not what I need to talk for

another dog

[Music]

might like to see a rocket

[Music]

[Music]

I didn't get to see when I don't murder

the sequel and

the bone

at least it's seagull took a bone

which the seagull didn't pick up that

would have been

yeah

[Music]

Ludwig Van schnitzelmacher will be the

first pushing the homemade rocket to

Pluto

this guy's been watching too many mad

scientist movies

everything's in movies with you Jake

five you guys just going to let the dog

stand there oh one lift off it's a

rocket you should do it left right down

he says something funny

what I could say I could maybe do it now

when I get to talk to him again

give a rocket

it must have been that three volt flux

capacitor I used I knew I should have

gone with the 5 volt one

if I can get the pieces back you mean

you could put a five volts in it only

need the three balls are there for you

oh load and explode it

I wonder if I could harness its wind to

power my rocket

I wonder if I could harness its wind

here we go to her replay of it

[Music]

was it funny

pounding a piece of my rocket bring me

the rest of them and I will give you a

reward Beyond Your Wildest imaginings

that sounds like a pretty good reward is

it is this engine from my crash speaking

I wish I could make that noise

I like ignore it I won't even do an

attempt

alone skank

dad always told me Billy Bob never stand

under a fallen tree

anyway

problems

on my head Now where's that ax

I don't think they should have an ax

my little canine charm you continue to

amaze me just a few more fragments and

the reward is yours

so there's gonna be four more

two more I meant it is four in total two

more

I can count trust me

[Music]

what is persons

put them

okay I can see something hard to find

he needs his eye ax can you count in

Polish what no I can speak Polish I'm

[Music]

[Music]

come to Daddy

I want to say anything

[Music]

he's clipping through oh

[Music]

oh wondering which live stream band me

instantly for my name but not not me I

wouldn't ban some of her name

green

[Music]

it's probably uh these probably names I

might bend someone for but at that point

you probably already banned by the

twitch

for the names I could consider Panama

but now I wouldn't buy someone being an

anti-fur I wouldn't totally consider

myself a furry like

I have a person that is like the extent

of my furiness

yay thanks yeah I want to be friends

with people

I've been playing for almost five hours

now

oh maybe I should say stop here and then

finish the game

I would be on Saturday so that would be

over six days I might play this

yesterday but I found the solution so

to make it work today which I couldn't

do yesterday I would take too long to

fix this there is more than more what I

meant

so um

and yeah and I'm tired and hungry so

I should

like me

boom just meal of town which I never

remember the name of so I will

there will hand it there I guess our

company is not I try to be nice

as long as you're nice to me I will be

nice to see you

I feel like neon's underscore Fox would

probably help me helps I don't know I

don't know who that is so I cannot make

a judgment on that I've been in his life

sometimes

[Music]

yeah it had me a name that is

anti-something it could because it can't

controversial

and if you you might

want a more friendly name if you want to

[Music]

be around

people's

I mean unless it's like

anti-action bad thing

[Music]

or something

boom spell what's the name

[Music]

from back sink it bye have a nice time

right now

I bet you're a nice person hopefully

yeah

give up more times it's fun to have

people here

there's that train again yeah

level pump in Lake minnewawa for some

reason

here and then the Adventure Continues

[Music]

on Saturday

and I hope to see people there and as

since

I do want to try to keep the game the

same for Saturday and Sunday I don't

want to split it up again I will try to

100 the game on set next week Saturday

Sunday

yeah versus Dark Age

and so yeah I'll do that

but probably complete the game Saturday

at 100 on Sunday

where's the okay no I don't know where

it is

[Music]

anyways goodbye have a nice time

I have a nice sunny day

and

goodbye to you that's right and I don't

know how to say goodbye

thank you

I will come back soon bye okay

bye bye

same successfully okay good

oh

I think it's

125 124 pounds in total

so

that's that

look the schedule is not equality now

isn't that nice

it's something it was

wasn't before

so yeah

um

not

even enough to construct a grown human

no no and so I guess that's the uh

it's not a human

I guess we can conclude that or is half

a human about the half a human

it might might still be a human

I don't have bad drink at the moment so

I will ignore I will refund that one

I'll take care of that

eh

yeah I mean the ending it now so

I actually don't know what this is

of course like tradition wanted to read

again because it's fun uh someone

I'll sleep with Solace solace

so release No salts I think the Solace

is playing the crown of leaves I don't

know I don't remember if I read it Red

Shadow before

and she's I she's a cafe

of course I know other animals

streamers

so anyway

yeah

those are the times for next time if

anyone here probably not because I have

three viewers I couldn't switch

I don't have their times on the schedule

do let me know I have considered adding

New Zealand and Africa East

that you will be so tall that's the only

issue

so

yeah

and that's

and that's that

and

I do have my usual drink message

that no one is using since carpet and

when he gets to the other chat you just

paste it

that's that's what you do

but thank you for coming more racing on

Monday Tuesday more spiral Thursday
