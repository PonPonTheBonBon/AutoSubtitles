now
what do you mean first with the first
[Music]
well you can't be sucking with your
friends to be fine
let's say
hello I think we've got someone watching
I didn't like this thing today an hour
later
after schedule a bit
[Music]
I'm just doing this
let's go
it's been a while since I played this
game
I guess I need to jump on that one
and here is now
[Music]
[Music]
okay no it's not I am jumped again now
don't do it changed
[Music]
I wasn't even touching
let's dream is the problem it's it's
only been on me
live stream although I mean it's Monday
it's always an interesting one day
that's the that's the rule
come on
and then I just pull down here
I didn't expect me I didn't expect to
land on the platform
I can run
with this run already I was trying
no okay I hope he I have but I do hope
you feel better that's what it says yeah
different bye
I got a little upset
my stuff doesn't go my way
uh yeah I was probably just a bit over
the overly dramatic
good time with everything today
though
As Much TNT anyway
now I heard it jumps down
[Music]
well that was close
no why
okay I guess it's attacking us
why didn't I expected
oh yeah seeing that
[Music]
Little Things
[Music]
when I listened back to my singing
it doesn't sound that great
it sounds pretty bad
come on
I don't have time to wait
again
that's a really not that anyone else is
here but now now people can join
and three
and didn't mean to do that
[Music]
foreign
except the one I need
and no it doesn't
of course I sing bad
experience okay
there you go why did I jump over that
one
no attack both
[Music]
I got almost the level here
and get down
I will eventually get it
there you go that's what he's supposed
to do
no and then it's supposed to jump
okay
now this time I'll do it
[Music]
jumped everything
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
now it's
wasting too much time
am I still want to meet
oh that's close
ground run in Android
there you go
that's how it should be
[Music]
and I should touch jump every day
[Music]
and I should make a single jump day
but I'm learning
and he's still jumping over that one
thank you
and everyone in a speech
thank you
there you go
[Music]
drink no jump stay
nothing
and then here
I was one of these things
but this time I'm ready for you at this
far I'm not cooking yet
I didn't see any things because the
stupid camera in the game
[ __ ]
ing
been jumping in a minute I came back
let's see the chance works again you
know what the chat about this this is on
your screen so it must make me think
[ __ ] okay why is the chat not on the
screen
[Music]
that's in between it
foreign
why doesn't show it
just refuses to show
because I can probably open
the reference that you should be using
now it doesn't show anything
uh
service is broken
apparently
foreign
today
I mean
okay now it's actually showing
that took your mind
[Music]
but it only Fighters they're not showing
[Music]
and how much ounces broken who knows
and this one must be broken
I still have protein there
but because I open it up in
yep browser
I'm gonna just decided to work
yeah it's probably
yeah it's just
it just scream elements being broken at
the moment
[Music]
okay now it's working
and everything is broken
I hope everything's okay hello Rocket
Man
Rocket Man
flying through space
all right nothing could have been better
I guess
it doesn't have 30 plug-in stuff it
stops working this one
apparently against this just
another thing today that's not supposed
to be working
bro
yo-yo body man they're playing a space
level and might start to sleep yeah
rocket man I want to get that um it's a
audio clip I know some people have it in
like a sandbox
and they play on stream
so now I explained it's uh now it's not
a surprise anymore for eight hours to do
it
I'd stop trust me
yeah basically someone
there's a little song
about the Rocket Man
[Music]
and then I play it every time rocket
Manchester I couldn't actually have it
automatically City for the very first
message
thank you
foreign
box now
I mean that's just me being clumsy but
damn
damn
I actually just jump over them
place there are always difficult Rocky
Mountain burning a few up there other
Rocky man burning out these field up
there alone that's what it says
don't burn up your Feud
why does it say there's only one year
[Music]
that look at a number of years but
because
it can affect your stream in the sense
of
when you have few viewers or I have a
lot of viewers it might
yeah okay
if you didn't care what the numbers
anyway oh it says two views now
they shared me
but but that wasn't even closer
I think when I think it was about
something like
Rocket Man burn up in the ass with the
edge all right guys
and I of course don't have to leave or
nothing atmosphere of it
but it was
thank you I tried I wanted land on that
platform then I want to do the super
tornado spin thing
again oh I didn't expect me to land on
TNT this time
instead of jumping over there even
though I shouldn't
huh
I missed that one is fine
now jump
[Music]
yeah he should do it that was the thing
I have on my
[Music]
on the wheel spin thing I wanted to
implement we're just gonna have an
implemented it's been jumping over that
even though I shouldn't
um
no I don't need to learn
this one I need to know
and one of those is called uh call
someone
and
I could call and what do you mean
then he can sing on stream
huh and then
there we go
I need it and now I should be prepared
for this one not that one that one was
cross person well you can see I wasn't
prepared I forgot about that there you
go
right there
we go
come on come on
meeting on three
yeah
I'm a senior stream
when when in that case I will call the
rocky man instead
oh
my God
[Music]
then again
I think you take so long so the 18th
retracting spikes
and interested one
okay I should just
need to spin out of it
yeah don't trust that one no
problems I want to reach the building so
far
ah no no no no
I should have tornado spin
wrapping sure
why not
it will be the first space wrap on my
stream
[Music]
I didn't think I was going to mind thank
you
it's wearing a stream
same thing
but I mean I'm just reading the comments
now
why does it have a hint
somebody wait today
and continue
and then
yes good
now now what happened with my second
jump
because I was doing a second jump and it
was preparing to do this tornado spin a
bad word from swearing
don't mind the ponton swearing above
that is a total thing happened
I don't see yay
do you
arms do you do comms or commissions
is that what are you talking about for
like
uh emotes
like I guess I could yeah I mean
I mean if you like how the if it's like
an animal or answer animal
in the like how I made the pumpkin image
if you enjoyed that thank you I could do
that
[Music]
someone did commission so yeah I did
actually start on a commission I did not
finish it because
um well two things
I I only take payment after I'm done
because I don't want pressure to payment
and if I want to not do it anymore I
should have it
I don't want to like
yeah if it's like if I try and see that
nah this is actually not working out for
me I I want that money out of it you
know
and since there's no money involved at
that point I mean like
technically I mean there's not there's
nothing bindings I mean after I make it
you can just not pay I think like this I
want to send it to you this is nothing
binding
[Music]
they just it's more like a mutual uh
nothing each other there's nothing not a
great time
yeah there's there's no no from a
contract just
you might hey if you feel
and so yeah but but that person wanted a
human and I gave it a try but
yeah the humans is not my thing
but I need to get an answer yeah
[Music]
and have fun
I'm happy stopped by
do you think
foreign
oh
okay
nothing nothing
honor System yeah yeah basically I mean
yeah
not fully though like I make it I show
you how it looks you pay for it I'll
send you this stuff and then you can go
and use it
I would appreciate if you also tag me as
the creator of the emails when you
I guess that could be like
I mean I don't yeah I mean that's a
fantasy today
yes an artist that took on a lot of
comps he had like a year waiting list he
eventually just kind of counts another
one yeah and then you have to pay back
and stuff
and all the team people who don't even
pay back they just can't cancel it and
just quick internet and
that
[Music]
and I know I know I don't yeah I also
don't want to see I mean it would still
be a waiting list if a lot of people
want commissions of course
the only only pay when I'm done that's
just
ease of my mind and I also use of your
mind to be fine
no other questions
I think this game I think it's as soon
as you start falling down
uh you can no longer do a job to jump so
the late the later you do the double
jump
behind you you should be able to reach I
assume
but but
if you wait too long you cannot even the
Right double jump at all
A system that we talked about before
which I don't like
private commission are from fun fun
before she begins dreaming a virtual
honesty
I mean yeah any
[Music]
I mean
because only you don't need to trust me
if you pay after anyway
s take me like what was it
I thought that was going to be able to
do that this time
because she has to go with the regular
tricks just okay if you can dream of the
first one and then
and then
tonight it's been and then yeah
like I think it took like me like an
hour on each one funny much but that was
like
character or something new with this one
[Music]
why did I do that why didn't I just two
not much quickly
hydrate
I still like I was wondering if you
could do strong items in 3D
oh oh items it's really
did I do that project
yeah I'm also done dancing I do a small
highlight just in case the previous idea
for the previous one which I think ready
mm-hmm
but um
[Music]
when I'm not done this video
I mean I guess I have
started working on a sweet 3D commission
which is Spiderman
which is on hold at the moment anyway
but um
I have the curiosity what kind of
throwing
like what items were you thinking in
that case
[Music]
Master Ball
and that shouldn't be too tricky to do I
mean
at that point it probably has extracted
from Pokemon
[Music]
I mean technically it's I mean if you
want I mean it is already here
times
what a heart
oh
that could work
DB problems yes I have no idea how how
much I even charge for such a thing
the
and also
gtpa I
[Music]
because I I know I would make it in
blender if I would make it
does can it exports to that format
in otherwise this probably is from
otherwise this very lightly uplogging
now where's my double jump
[Music]
I like the app lagging that I could use
that could export it to
but format and of course and of course
not this thing I would do first is just
just create
a basic Cube and just testify you can
export it and have it work
um and then
it sounds interesting
when they jump in the wrong box
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
okay so we want the second Steam
initiative
for the certain theme on the items
that is I can understand not just taking
existing ones
with chats I got a headache now yeah
you can always
send me a private message yes
with other things like
number of polygons texture resolution if
that's going to be a thing otherwise
it's just going to be a Vertex color
[Music]
oh my I'm messing up so much
okay concentration
you will do it this time you've been on
this level for are too long
this is the only level
miss that thing out
okay it wasn't this time
and you should do this instead
missing everything nice
oh yeah and leave that
come on crash
why do you
oh why are you so badly guys
[Music]
oh great
comes in
with theory that
um
nine people
a whole lot of people
comes in
foreign
[Music]
enchantment
s
hello everyone and Yuma you might hear
and I misspelled the name because it
didn't provide an optical option go get
it great
I got English today
last
in you
okay
and like um 40 minutes I think
it's been quite that way
maybe singing
[Music]
I'm trying to do this time travel but um
I am struggling a bit
dude oh
sometimes it falls so quickly when you
try to do something it's been basically
just stay in the air a bit longer after
the first thing
gone
it's gone it was half cooked so I had to
microwave the last
part of it
but it was very nothing
I almost raided you when you were ending
in history
oh oh yeah so if break had wasted like a
minute or so he would have had a rate
and then he could have rated with more
people
foreign
[Music]
yeah I mean
yeah you can never create you can never
end your stream because you never know
when someone read you
okay
all right any no
I will get this I will get this
Philippines so they're amazing when I
finally get this
that one
I'm breaking every box except they want
to leave
again
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
okay
I will just have to become the internet
forever seven streaming sleep streaming
and English is difficult polish is easy
English has some aspects of it that is
difficult and it's always silly when
people say English is the easiest
language of all languages now
no it's easy because
so much weird stuff to eat
yes yes it's just because you're used to
them
but English doesn't have grammatical
change no
anyway
it didn't attack me even yes are you
that
pick up Pokemon card is the easiest
language it's hard to communicator
[Music]
so I
they're hard to make clear communication
even if it's easy to see
okay
okay leave it now don't be don't be like
this
I've tried too many times now
this is like watching a speedrunner
it's been anything usually better than
me so I guess it's it's not like
watching that [ __ ]
foreign
[Music]
which is not a secret
oh
oh that was a failure but
I didn't die so I guess it was a success
then
that's all that counts
Okay so
no no no I forgot the slide and then I
uh
win this one because it was simple
now this is Patrick
but never make it to Heavenly is a known
I mean
I mean as long as you're like Evelyn
combine it's fine it just sounds weird
you might
[Applause]
okay foreign
[Music]
I hope it was okay
you found the way yay
welcome
I mean the Poor Paul's community
or Pals community pool party got more
pails
in this now well I might just do that
and that now you too can use the five
fun funny mode
I don't remember what they are because I
said them a long time ago
it should be the hello the
celebration which was some reason it's
called hype
[Music]
even if it's off to die
a private anymore
the um
would be Playboy Bunny outfit inspired
by cheats
Playboy Bunny judgment they play game
you played which I which I totally
didn't watch today because we have seen
each other in 40 minutes yeah
uh yes I wanted the Playboy bunny style
outfit for Samsung
S40 mod
that I'm working for fresh corn
and it's funny to advertise myself here
yeah I have not done anything that I
usually do when it comes to race
it's been very casual when I'm at the
streets
no Shout outsy
but I think it was like
premium and Rocket Man here
you might probably left what uh what's
in here but left a bit you know in here
anyway no one to share that I was kind
of down here
anyway so I am working on mod for crash
four crash four being the latest crash
platforming game
released in
2000 and something
a 2000
no no no no no 2017 was said the Trinity
right and crash four was 2019.
oh it's finally
[Music]
so yeah
the mod is replacing cocoa with wonton
so it will be trash and pontoon
Adventure
replacing trash with a male 1.
and in craft board and
you can also change outfits
so
with that I want to also make a bunch of
different outfits for one
I have fun
no I try to jump and I have
lip so cool should I show
for anyone still here I could show like
one of the up I don't know I didn't want
to do that
all right and did I
let
okay let me
know I wanted to press the wrong buttons
and yeah I should have
all right
[Music]
I still pressing different button sorry
about this
[Music]
there we go and now let me bring it up
on stream
today yeah so
let me fit it on screen as well
no don't now I told you not to move that
one
and here it is
no one to chat with I've been here the
whole time wait did I say no one to chat
with no I said I did not want to shout
out to you
because you already know drink right
so that's the mod I've been working on
and the ship name
[Music]
name
a crown pun
Rodriguez
yeah I know Green yeah exactly
so this is ponpon in underwear but uh
I'm gonna use I'm using this as a base
for because I would have like the
pink dress and yeah it would be
I mean it's a 3D model it might happen
it will happen lucky
because I mean Coco isn't wearing a
dress she isn't really
making
[Music]
appropriate
emotions for wearing this
and this is one of the alternative
outfits oh no this is actually one of
the power-ups
yeah I have to do all the power-ups no
because some pumpkin doesn't turn into
cocoa just because I'm using um
power up that would be windy
and finally
and it's a screenshot from the game
itself while the mod is running
and the game is quite low resolution and
and set it low quality settings because
this computer is not running became that
one so
I this this mod is going to take a very
long time and I will not play the game
until I'm done with the mod
a
but
it's a shame because this computer is
very sensitive sometimes
anyway back to the game
it looks good thank you okay man yeah
um
I did the bad start enemy
and so
um yes and I want to get uh
new computer before I
[Music]
oh yeah sorry sorry for my distractions
and I am apparently moving and after I
moved that might be able to get help to
get a computer and new computer is high
performance allowing me to run the game
and more stable as well as because the
game can occasionally like this computer
and also Run the game at higher quality
so it looks nicely
but this game runs at Max quality
I'm still spinning I cannot didn't pay
attention to him okay
and and then when I'm
and I wanted to like play to do the game
first before I release the mod into to
public
and then it would be amazing to see
other streamers this amount
and if if another streamer is using the
mod they they are
they are free to let me know because I
would love to watch
[Music]
come on
that's what I was supposed to be doing
[Music]
okay here it comes
this time I'll do it
here we go that's what I wanted
no not not not double jump if I done a
regular jump
I might have been able to do that was so
long ago I was there so I didn't
remember what I was supposed to do
[Music]
what do you
went on to you also like that's pretty
tiny
Greg writing my rabbit friend
yeah
so hey Greg would you play Crash four
with the fun mod I might go drink milk
because this Wasabi is killing me no
well Wasabi did summer reading wasabi
I would never do that to you today
because I don't have enough points
but I am watching these things I can get
my pie
there we go nice you're done
be back for one day
yes yes
now I need
it ended
it ended the right before it
our name is a better way to get over
those
foreign
[Music]
like this now
nope apparently not
although if you tried to attack me then
I would be dead anyway
not sure what I did there
I did something stupid
I was having a moment of escaping
now it is happening
it was supposed to drop down
not attack
now now
[Music]
there are they expand so quickly I
wasn't prepared
[Music]
do you have an
animation but they are really quick
anyway
you can't beat you electric monster
there you go
leave it across something
[Music]
I can just do that
I don't need that spin and yeah and
regular example allows me to get over
jump over that come on
[Music]
another checkpoint the bonus platform
no no no no no no I forgot about that
I should have snide it and you just tell
me the spin
that's all that's nice
[Music]
come on Chris
oh no
yeah
I'll get it this time I'll get it I've
only been on this level for
um 60 minutes now I'll do it I'll do it
I'll show you a candidate
[Music]
began
don't you spike me
be gone you found this
burnt base Beach
you found beef
now there we go bonus then not nothing
yeah but no it is not enough space to
slide anyway
now I missed the pot
oh
[Music]
it wouldn't have been enough space to
slide if this wasn't this game because
this game is not nice when it comes to
sliding
I mean these are not expenses like
because you can't actually slide across
a single box
and still do it but
when I've gotten so far I should not
risk it I feel like
because how this game works
there we go
no jump
oh my
stupid very good
if it was killed her she would have done
this without issue
because she managed to get 20
crystals in the time to crash again
Chris got 10 of them so far or something
now they should make they should make
the alternative version of this game
where
um what do you play as Coco on different
levels and you also gather 20 crystals
foreign
let's have a
thing
now but I
thought I jumped on me
[Music]
related
course is a liability I actually don't
know what that means
really understood what it means
trash what are we doing
just stop it dying
it's it's that simple
dying is a bad thing and then he has
time again when I tell you about dying
is a bad thing and then you just go and
die
all right
in in most platforming game there is
this thing another timer
for someone watched redeem someone
earlier that's fine
[Music]
I looked at it what are you doing step
crash
actress
it's for everyone who isn't subscribed
which is a really nice thing now but
someone should make destination points
adds command point doesn't work
badly anyway
I wish I could and maybe maybe that
comes as a feature
I wanted to execute a command as soon as
it starts maybe I could actually make it
that might be impossibility
because
the only three minutes of ads which sure
is an eternity when it comes to people
on the internet I know
three minutes ad on Insta on Twitch
that's like
because uh you can watch a whole film
a picture length filament
during three minutes of ads on Twitch
um but um
but that means pick 57 minutes of
everything okay
and this is very nice
and it would bad free regardless if you
yourself did see the ads or not
so
there you go
so here say if you come in here after it
has this clean you still get ad free
watching
oh yes paper subscription anymore you
can eat
come on
oh come on
come on trash stop failing because if
it's one thing about the next thing
um
why are you expanded
let me press on there I just tried to
attack it but
[Music]
come with you
no no
trash
whatever you tell me about
yeah that that's it
I got new reaction is good
subscribers
he's still missing that one
yeah I thought that was
going to cool enough today
but then when I jumped
and do not have a good Arc to get over
there we go don't retract I mean
don't rotate I don't care if you start
missing
oh wow that was scary no no no but press
the button like three times there
where's my buttons on screen
up press them after falling off the
knees hi guys
oh that was sick that was it that was
that was something
why does it take it sometimes
underneath
no
be right back that's our Indian
he crawls into the bunny Barrel
[Music]
I want the uh
alert commands to write out a different
thing depending which is
foreign
no
[Music]
why why
foreign
I didn't do it
this time until it originally still gone
so until this time
we have to do it
all off my own that's something all on
my own
oh come on and it's not even like all of
my own it isn't even a Swedish
expression
uh
because in Swedish that would be holy no
not probably
yeah
putting as in a completely
[Music]
the attacking hitbox connecting his
weight you mean
um
yeah
holy cell
press in
phone
I guess our own self but I
they will be holy I don't know
maybe it isn't maybe confusing with the
different words
okay
yeah I don't speak English
is not my native language
which might be
evident by my
accent
[Music]
I I must say
I must pardon my English usage
English isn't my native language
which might be evident by my usage of
this damage
no I forgot about that thing come on
press jump over it
yeah I'm gonna command it I did snow job
as it's called cold
too cold
why does that one expand sometimes and
not sometimes not
related
[Music]
remix still not back I still have time
to complete this level
[Music]
so that made that good
but no
they jump around
yeah which wasn't three of them
they need to come
[Music]
[Music]
yeah
okay
oh come on I've spent so long on this
lap about come on
I have eight more levels of this I can
spend one hour per level
this is not a nice level
but why
foreign
expanded and sometimes not
and why am I missing everything see now
it isn't
it's so confusing to me
I am
very confused
oh this one is like Spanish
and now this one isn't
I'm so tired
day
you remember this one
and then did this one
bad jumps by me don't expand
looks like Olivia's pie
foreign
[Music]
and now
I should take it easy
no
no
Oh Daddy
I didn't even double jump
it's way too excited today
I'm back says
what
it's short
yeah we're trying to sneak be sneaky and
beat this level with mine I was amazing
I mean what else would I just
not trying to complete it while you're
away
oh that's bad yeah I mean
it's gone I guess I can't completely
it will feel good after I complete this
lemon
don't electrocute class
and then there's one here
get rid of that
but
it's rushing over that
then there was one here as well
wishing you with that don't gonna
forgive me
and then make it easy here
there we go
it's fine I'm not cooking before
no no no no no
no no
I got some far but I made a stupid
decision
[Music]
and that's what I'm doing now just
making noises
but yeah
but I attacked but I attacked
now it was extending but I thought you
could attack it more and it was
extending
because sometimes they are these
I don't know
foreign
[Music]
tricky
don't jumping and spinny and stuff but
no why did that one expand it has never
extended before
I mean it has but
why did I jump over there
[Music]
there you go much quickly
[Music]
that is how I want it to be every time
but sadly
perfect extent
don't do that extent
one here
and get rid of you and then I should
wait here
there we go
there we go no no how was it expanded
sir for so long
I tried to reach the other one but my
jump wasn't long enough
[Music]
when I was filming about me
[Music]
I am guessing closer to the end
I better get some plot nicely after this
I don't know what those thinking gold
getting further further until I don't
come on
jump jump there we go that's the one I
wanted
extending them who gave you the
permission to extend
all of you have to be a retracted
you
stupid people animals that's not the
correct words armadillo
Spanish March which has been imported oh
nice nice double jumping
is work there or
right then then no don't expand extend
extend
why does it do that
oh why
why do you extend why do you extend the
software
why do you extend wait what's the game
doing now
why was there a dog jumping in
I thought you couldn't thank you you
don't jump Journey
I'm getting distracted by these things
that are extending
like why why are they extending
Mark is the game doing
there better be tacos for all of this I
mean I hope I can get some money on my
bank account in three seconds
but I can actually cook a burger I mean
I did microwaves Olive oregano that was
a half
cooked half right
but I was planning on frying practice
properly
damn
[Music]
now I have to wait until tomorrow
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
No it didn't
and then after this one
yeah should be another one
is it of you and then there's this
section
I almost got me
I almost got myself or something
without extend
close thank you
and close thank you thank you
come on there we go I did it I did it
without all my celebration okay
celebrations I got the best time
that is is silver looking one
third day and I say
okay let's do some underwater these are
easy for some reason let's go back and
get these
skinny
[Music]
there's a three there see if I can
activate the lengthy
it's bedtime for me right
no crash crash
you might spend more than three seconds
a night
I had fun catch you next time
thank you for coming Grace you are a
very lovely person
so I connect with it like that okay
and I hope to see you again great
thank you for putting in all your nice
people with you
how do I activate it
nearly bye
cheerio
is that what he said okay man cheerio
no I can't do that I have to
there you go
[Music]
thank you
okay I guess I'll have to wait for this
then
[Music]
[Music]
eating
it's underwater levels are so much
easier and crashes me
the same as someone's pain
just that they
controls feels more solid if it
definitely feels like I might have much
more control in this game it also helps
that the attacking enemies have such a
short attack
time
they do their pack and then they're
basically over with it and they're so
long when they are not attacking
it really helps making it easier but I
was attacking apparently not
all right
[Music]
they're working man how many times
how many times a day do you say Cheerio
um
now now I didn't want you to go
underneath
oh
an accident landed on top of the boat
[Music]
you get that's what I wanted
I don't know if that like takes more
information
[Music]
it's more of control I still not gonna
have more control over this than
price three and if it's not fun perfect
[Music]
[Music]
now this is currently
there we go that's what I wanted
alone
[Music]
[Music]
I've gotten a lot of money yes and this
one
and I can check this card while I'm
streaming
I can do that too I guess
foreign
[Music]
wow
those are yeah
I activate it
yeah these the controls are crying the
TNT is terrible in this thing in the
working room the TNT didn't even
activate
that breaks the trash rules
[Music]
it's breaking the crash runes
[Music]
ah no don't swim in that direction what
was it we reliable controls I guess I'll
take that back
yes sometimes
If he if he just didn't have this whole
turnaround animation which I really
don't get what why he has I'm gonna be
honest like like I guess I can
understand like oh you want smooth
transition between luck but it doesn't
have any Corner turn around when he's
walking when he's on foot you can
instantly place an animation but as soon
as it's on the water which is already
annoying to control
the original crash game within business
but then he also has this alternate
random machine is even worse it was
already bad
foreign
[Music]
actually
stop
turn hey turn around and then face the
next section that would be so annoying
[Music]
come on
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
this level they were completely harmless
but now they are harmful
it shouldn't activate it had nothing on
me
[Music]
I mean it doesn't matter that he
activated but it should impact me
he didn't have an error blocking
[Music]
why would they act oh I touched me
even though the animation doesn't beat
up
[Music]
me making bunny noise
stop pending about when you scratch
[Music]
yeah they are not capable
but those range they're broken
every every room is broken now
that's what evidence at this point
[Music]
the other one was not active and there
was constantly the amount of time they
are actually but it's really short so
another one doesn't constantly exited
yeah we're changing all the rules now
aren't we
foreign
[Music]
spins so slowly
okay I had a tornado spin definitely
that was like
[Music]
no
no no no no no
that's not supposed to happen
[Music]
wow
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
for the
for when you pick up time boxes
[Music]
they have recorded this sounds
but didn't considered when it is
so the two sounds are similar but there
are differences between them and they
are recorded one of the song and wow
sounds and did not consider that they
you have different sounds
foreign
[Music]
sound
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and I think I mentioned it before but in
case someone doesn't know what they mean
I guess it's interesting trivia
thank you
when you pick up the clock in the
original crash and in the remake is far
so now it should apply that one as well
you hear the ticking sound
but you also hear the
sound of all the fruits disappearing
with that sound
yep best time however I decided the
times for the water lips are bad
spotless
down the hill
so when you pick that up that one you
hear that which is the oh I shouldn't go
up here
this actually not be any problem
famous last words I know
I haven't seen a mask in a long time
anyway and when you pick up a paintball
it is the same ticking sound but you
don't hear the fruits fly away because
the fruits first of the iron are more
fruits and level
and second of time boxes does not make
fruits Fly Away
so we have to press when you hear the
first fly away which
and then when I pick up this time boxes
it also here this is
thank you
it should not be the case
excuse me sad why aren't you shooting me
um yesterday that's three second crates
maybe they'll probably thinks much than
three seconds to go back and forth whoa
nice touch
[Music]
come on
I don't know what what's gonna rhyme
not a must
then got up onto that one it's fine
okay I don't have to wait for anything
no now he shot me
right in the stomach
crochets puffy fish are very petable
yeah
crushed up like a balloon yeah he's very
balloon like
one of the outfits in Crash four
you take this one now
oh my
oh my I'm wasting so much time
it's a balloon and when you die by spiky
things the balloon pops
then
let's see I got this you have a Japanese
third
you have some invisibility
for this roof in the rain there's a room
in the way
I'll explain it
now I landed on the scene
and I bumped up into the team
and I'm calling it a thing because it's
very stingy
I can't keep the mask this time
nope
everybody just do that
let me try that
thank you let me try that as I am and it
didn't happen that was spinning
but I was
spinning
[Music]
exactly I was spinning
yeah welcome welcome
nice to see you
oh there we go
nice to see you to see you I think
it's something
I think
the time running start way Chicago
perform number just
Dynamic accidents again
it's not even attached to crash
I like this last one
oh it lasted just right into what I
think financially give me a yeah
no no
just one second and four 30 seconds
[Music]
even though the game it is a bit weird
though because it only counts tenths of
a second
because the game is running at 16 almost
16.
[Music]
so I guess it comes six frames and then
it increases by one
clean time during one second and then
some yeah not even two seconds
not even two seconds in this game you
have to
shoot the boxes
otherwise it doesn't count
[Music]
and you need to take these
otherwise
you're wasting time
and out of my way no let's shoot balloon
let's go
foreign
let's see
and I would only focus on
nippling
[Music]
not now
welcome welcome
Ludlow and Ray days
I am in the middle of a time trials
in the crashed game on Game Boy Advance
but I guess I can start with myself then
and I'll get to get you
afterwards
okay I am fun from the bon bon as you
can see by my name
how and and I play I currently I'm going
through all fresh inspiring games
currently Game Boy games
and my goal is to 100 them
if I bought this too
Let's ignore that I'm actually giving up
on one Crush game when I was playing
yeah but that didn't happen
and there's one blimp left and then I am
done with the time trial
I will get back to you
yes
you can tell what you were up to what
you were streaming
how your stream went
and then
I'll get to it as soon as
the limp is that which should be here
somewhere it should be very soon
very very busy
shoot me planes Don't Shoot Me There It
Is there is the blink
and I'll put all focus on it
all my clothes
I won't avoid anything
there we go
I didn't
die and die at some point so I can
finish level well okay come on how am I
supposed to do that quickly
didn't I get every single box it's not
like you can move quickly I guess you
could shoot the blimps a bit more
efficiently
against okay back to the Rain
11 11 radius welcome today I was playing
graveyard keeper
wait what is that
I was accepting too much
[Music]
no I'm doing the wrong thing again this
time I pay attention
she she's using different commands
that's because this time I saw it
is
I expected you to write more things I
don't know
and tell me more about your stream why
did you choose to
write me
and what is Graveyard keeper then that's
also I think
[Music]
that there is a very
lucky though
did you know that
the
[Music]
name of the uh
of me off
Lady and the [ __ ]
in Swedish is called
which is kinda like Ludlow
not now
that's not exactly but your your name
reminded that the first time I saw it
and I have not said that
I said it now because this is my extreme
I can see whatever I want
hmm
it now
this is a tunation game
where you become the great keeper so
you're attending Grace but you can also
deforms and stuff like that
oh it's like uh
a tycoon standing
like like those farming simulators
I don't know Tycoon is the question here
oh
next time the advantage yeah
[Music]
barbecue creams
crowns interesting
I do like that
so that was supposed to close
apparently nothing is oh I don't even
know this level I'm dying for everything
here
today
I like harvesting
the Harvest Moon you are on a moon and
you harvest it
oh when it is that not what Harvest Moon
is about
me
oh again
that's fine let me up bonus then now do
I need to thumb down see this is what
they should have had when you unlock
double jumping I need to go down here
[Music]
one jump
and then I have to wait for this scene
all right
bent down again now down
down crash sometimes crash down don't be
on the sofa
it's another space level and you know
how I love space levels
I mean this level shouldn't be that bad
even though the previous Space level
took me oh slightly more than an hour to
get completed but
isn't that bad
[Music]
I think now I'm doing
[Music]
in addition to
playing games I also make a mod on
Saturday Sunday not to advise myself but
you know
I wanted to say something it's a bit
quiet in China
thank you
but it is relevant to me playing Crash
because as soon as I'm done with that
mod not as soon as but
sometime after I'm done with that mod I
will
play Crash four with the mods
[Music]
it's quite
[Music]
some things up
I mean typically find something good the
chance could be broken there is the
expansion there's something that we
talked about
um
it's only occurred me once I think
when I was included in a raid ones which
was my own rate actually when I read it
once that's the correct time
and
I could no longer write
I could make redeems
just redeems that didn't require typing
and
um
but I could not send regular messages
come on come on
sometimes the out sliding mechanic in
this game is terrible
yeah I need to think of things to say
yeah
but I I was part of that streamers
Discord service so
abroad on their Discord server even
though I'm not checking my disaster if
someone want to write down
check this card
I mean I could have her such a game
that's like
twitch is broken I can't know my time
can I make this redeem
there you go that's okay and then I got
you sometimes
first refuses to jump
and I don't know why
I'm pressing the button but no jump
happens
yeah
I need to make the tornado jump
nothing
there we go or a slide jump once too but
this time
I forgot about that thing
we're gonna say why was my mask already
to give us cheating
that's where my mask went
but then they got four messages and
Discord maybe I should just check them
just again
just one message on my stream telling me
that I've started screaming
it means that that's working
this person sent me a picture I have to
read it later this person's brought me
some text
but uh you won't answer anything
well it's not important
it's not Nike time setting if that makes
sense
to focus on the stream for now
you know
oh
foreign
[Music]
I'm not earning any of them
and you probably are
I've also had this buggy
I joined uh a new stream I think
of a new screen
I just hydrated
in lafarian
and I joined the knee stream
but I suspect it would happen on an old
stream too and the counter was zero and
I definitely had watched this stream for
more than 15 minutes and I didn't even
get the
uh singing to press on it just said
syrup and that was weird so so I close
to the stream and opened it up again and
now it said I had like 40 points or
something and I could activate that
scene
sport I'm hydrating
it is 40 time
it's only Spotify it is a fun fun family
time
that will be an outfit in my mod
so if you'd like to
see if you like let's get Quantum Sunny
that's an option in the mode
and when I upload the mod on
I even did it
hear myself
it won't be so many pictures for me to
upload on The Mod page
there we go
got enough paint
can't touch me
[Music]
oh
oh that was close almost running status
no no no one of these
oh no is this level with those ones that
kind of out of sync
wait a minute
does TNT activate from that team the
action crash games
can someone confirm that
okay
I'm being so careful yeah let me get up
wow what oh no you need to retract first
come on
no no I forgot that those things aren't
bouncy
I forgot that those things aren't
dancing stupid games changing the rules
of crash
but in game you'll see more of her back
than her belly
oh no
yeah because you want to see the front
right but you will see it in cutscenes
I could run the game as high as quality
as I can do like a cut scene
in that case I should record every
single cutscene with every outfit
because they must be I can say with
certainty that there's a video on
and YouTube with every every crashboard
I've seen
well and it was it has this stuff raised
it stops changing
oh that one is okay
[Music]
and here's the TNT
[Music]
whoa whoa whoa
and then I'll do the the same thing
I forgot to press the attack button
hello everyone
yeah but then I'll do that but with
every outfit but yeah
so you choose outfit by selecting a
video and then you can watch every
cutscene background
I don't know it's a silly thing
didn't take too long to make
gives me more views on my YouTube
channel so
yeah
but I think I have it
um
yeah
I think I have 16 outfits planned
doesn't mean I'm going to make all 16.
I mean it's a it's a long project thing
is
I got time
so my office will be easier to make an
honest
there we go and then I did that to get
away
I pressed the wrong buttons I didn't
know what happened
all the buttons at the same time
I couldn't do slide under that stack Oh
you mean you want me to like I'm just
like let me try that maybe that's the
point
to try to start on this tank so many
outfit yep
I thought I'd start it
[Music]
no don't attack yes
[Music]
in there
whoa
today
I haven't seen if I can do that
team oh this is a good idea
I don't need to care about you no no
don't explain
no I didn't think oh don't expect okay
and then there is a
What's the timing off on that thing
when it came to
as on stream
obviously wouldn't work
but I need something
because I always had face ideas
it could be when the person who had had
the ads comes back to the stream they
are they are still and
[Music]
and
they cut they come back to where they
left off so they they will be lifting
streaming spine but
and
history have
the streamer can Mark segments in the
Stream
that will be sticked if I use response
for example loading screens is that
when the stream is quiet
and then everyone who had yeah again
everyone has ads will then therefore
skip forward and catch up to the Stream
[Music]
I keep jumping on that one but I know
it's a city
Wednesday in the market in this game
comes in the day now
downloading skins
but but it has a stock raised shouldn't
I be able to spin it maybe I can't feel
it
sorry I can't even test if I can slide
under this tank because I can't even
reach that anyway
I'm still jumping I'm still jumping
the field of view someone clicked on
this game
it's like it's scanned as soon as
something shows up on screen
[Music]
off
[Music]
ers
come on come on trashy candy
um
okay here we go
we totally
okay I'll wait for you then
nope
[Music]
no but
[Music]
I think it's tresponding that stack this
morning I mean okay maybe I don't
remember that but
maybe it was on the previous stream
you can you can slide and destroy the
bottomless box at least
foreign
and then the stack here
I keep forgetting a few things
because it's destroying the time right
well
before you try
now I thought I need to do that
oh
whoa no no no
come on
okay this time I'll do it
now I have everything
will never say it's a joke this time
I'll do it
but I know everything I need to do
it's not jumping on that thing
running into that thing
which is it's not what I was supposed to
do
foreign
[Music]
do the same crash
now why didn't he jump he worked foreign
jump
uh this game
[Music]
I need to play sgma
I wanted to give Shannon pom-poms
but that's why not work
as well
jump and Pawn
jumping down
okay that's why I wanted
no that's what I want to do
so finish it slide and jump foreign
box and then
finally I didn't I said I was going to
do it okay now set it on that jumbo and
I got the best time
but this time
[Music]
but the best time only four more
swim level this is easy
awesome this is easy cut that top
previous thing
[Music]
I wasted more than one second
transmitter
but
come on
foreign
[Music]
called shark attack or something
[Music]
but I see more Ian's than sharks
[Music]
down down
thank you
no not this
can activate it
oh wait but it's what what
does it not
enough I must thank you again you've
been kind of Stingy on the masks
oh no
well I guess I'll use it up
it is much quicker though
[Music]
first end of the level should be here
yep
what's that space time
17.
anymore yeah no fly zone or whatever
it's called
I hope everyone has a good time here
wait I didn't pick up the timer
[Music]
as soon as it doesn't change the boxes
on screen maybe that's intentional
wow
[Music]
I missed it yeah
let me be boxes no I got it
doesn't sound like I got it time though
still try to you know hit the Box
because that's
wow
I'm exciting
all right as soon as I got here this
afternoon
oh playing there I can't see for some
reason
one down two more to go
well my pots
I went
yes now
now my box
when I was shooting
when I was shooting people
why does the game have to be like this
way too many Rockets
pick every rocket you can hit someone
no my box now I completely missed it
I'm doing
I might even need to restart this lemon
all right I'm supposed to shoot me soon
a bit hard to see where I'm supposed to
shoot when price is in the rain
that doesn't make any sense
is kind of weird
which I just
came with like me but I just didn't
compare
[Music]
she was playing a stealth game where he
was supposed to follow someone
but game had third person view so you
could because that completely hidden
behind a wall and still
with the game camera see the person
which makes no sense in reality
oh I got hit by one of the bombs anyway
then the last lean
but as long as I get gold it's fine
no nothing never found nothing
[Music]
three minutes 45 seconds
no yeah I messed up that's true then one
so many times
so many boxes I missed
[Music]
[Music]
there are many verses that means
oh
again shooting on Halloween
huh that attacked me right after the
that's not fair that's gonna read
actually
one down two to go
I don't know
trust me I need to shoot this blimp yeah
I don't have to shoot you
okay second blame
secondly down
any hands left
[Music]
hey
if those looks like hectic damage by
those anyway and then the last
clean
and you have to it's specifically that
part of the game
[Music]
the link is defeated and that was like
dancing as quickly
well
I got girl and that's all the counts
two more quick quick
fun 27 welcome
okay you'll get this stream
welcome welcome
nice to see you here
in some
I don't know why he turns green
doing some
I'm not sure I think you can say jumped
while I'm spinning
and I am doing some crash hunting game
foreign
[Music]
okay that's because they're moving their
jumps are so quick when they arrive they
jump towards you
so we kind of need to know where they
are oh the spin didn't take it out
it was a jump
right oh but it was up in the air and I
was done looking around
foreign
the ceiling is very high up
11
is 11.
three
again the spin did not take it out
but where's my spinner especially the
button multiple times
but I was yeah
When the boxes are fine
it's frozen already waste
oh it's nice
I will need something wrong
okay I guess I'll have to wait for you
then and then slide through the box
apparently have to slide a little bit
higher that is
new pressure to slime where's the
problem where's it from yeah
but come on it was jumping and avoiding
my attack
oh my these fruits
these frogs are
they approaching me this isn't allowed
and then I got the first one I do want
to
throw it away
and because I should be able to edit
spirals animations
Instagram there behind us again we
jumped out of the way
it's wrong I did it again
therefore I do want to make a custom
spiral that is a barrel bunny
which is ponton
yeah nicely
[Music]
and then actually have fun jump like a
rabbit and look more like a rabbit
instead of yeah it's basically how
I had to test it
that's why I wanted to modify I want the
animation
working jump like again
because you love that one
foreign
excuse me
yeah
I do want the master pursue that
they give me some time they are so slow
let's see next one should be Rose
go
and then I did
get over here
now
uh where I'm done with that mask
okay something too much for this morning
another frog another frog
probably take that otherwise I don't
know just some more
where is quit second jump
sometimes it is yes no second gem
obviously I didn't pretend to use just
single jump over that much again
thank you thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
it's doing my day is a fancy maneuvers
didn't bought a gift attack
what a strange creature
there you go so that didn't wait a long
time so
foreign
I wonder what those enemies are supposed
to be robots and vacuum cleaners yeah as
far as I've understood it it's mostly in
the air compressor too
and fresh 2 is much more clear that
there's there's like brushes underneath
them
and then they are shaking kind of like
probably spinning the
Crush beneath them and
the most clear is that I address bubbles
this one
so they have some cleaning thing
three three
nights
again I forgot about that one
concentration now crash
now I'll do it this this is the Run
get this one
now I'll do it
jumping every time
praying for this robot to Dustin
you know
I believe
that it has come to frogs
here comes there from that
I saw you
no don't shoot me
I am shaking
I would do that
but but why aren't you allowed to slide
to be frogs
you're not allowed to slide through
frogs
that would be good to know before what
kind of specialty was that
why
why from special
that's not fair
I kind of forgot about that girl
because I got to know in my I couldn't
lies reference
obviously I couldn't do that around
because I wasn't allowed to start from
that was ping me
okay this is the Run
when the frogs come here
we go
foreign
[Music]
box the next one is frogs
I think we have finally
we should do
yeah
fine if you ever watch it
okay third power student
foreign
this is the Run
trust me
I'm gonna give I'm keep I'm guilt
are we keep
this is I will give my own what's
distracted because I couldn't speak
there
now the slide is rich
and the dragon front me all right I
can't fly frogs for some sneaky
there's nothing on a frog that would
prevent me from sliding in the approach
bro come off that price
because I got an iron because I couldn't
fly in the approach
that in the original crash game too
trying to slide into front
as you can I'm pretty Japanese
right
I said sleep maybe I've slits through
many runs
Sportsman
okay okay I guess it will be specific
because there was no jump thing
and it didn't cost any care coins why
what I mean it's because you can't just
Frozen if you watch after this read
you will see that it does cost stuff and
just a client just does nothing
I mean as you said it didn't it doesn't
increase it over time
so it's just that you can't doesn't
change and you can't understand
because it doesn't show you the True
Value
refreshing yeah
there we go
I don't know what's what's pointing me
over here though bro
cks I did it so many frog
so many frogs and it was going I mean I
could almost go but nah I only got one
left
no it's cortex though and needs to buy
now count down
the airspace level
[Music]
I didn't see that it was hiding behind
your arm between
oh it destroys the whole laser thing
that's not how the original game works
now where's my double jump jam
and inside Hamilton
only one left and then I'm done with
this game
then I can I was hiding behind geology
again
[Music]
come on come on
no
it's one doctor hi
oh
sliding section
oh no nothing's
that is much tiny I'm trying to stuck
with something
[Music]
no no no jump jump
[Music]
it's not hiding again
no I haven't been my double Jam
I've been with my family champ
again
okay I should try to remember that one
it is behind please
there it is oh it didn't lift its arms
this time
it's so hard to see because it's hiding
behind oh no I touched it touching
everything
not allowed to have masks in this level
[Music]
and that didn't lift its arm this time
or I should just jump on it
I'm standing behind the next to the
boxes and spinning why doesn't the boxes
break
with the skin
where's my double dumb
I guess every time I contact up Jam is
because I was spinning and then jump
oh it did have its arms up this time
I also forgot about this game
because it was still being able to see
that exactly it doesn't make any sense
no we did not finish this arms
oh my God
I always have to take them oh and of
course that thing
yeah that's why it doesn't make sense or
of course the face
everything in the ones even I don't
think damage to one of the things and he
damaged him
yeah
performers want to have these things I
think the front of the screen
Edge doesn't make any sense
[Music]
see this is a curling section as you can
see I'm counting this one before but I
have the more Corning
do this
but but
I call 90 we need to clearly it was a
paintable
like it like pushed me to the side
double jump
[Music]
this is Crash Bandicoot what happened to
my double jump
[Music]
that's also the title for crash four
it is 20 the same subtitles like two
games
we're gonna go
name works for me here
this is I think this is Crash one what
happened to my thumb jump and then this
question
as far as I know those are the only two
games with that thank you
[Music]
I mean it was because I'm spinning it
but still
what happened with the slide and that's
the next title
okay that was me kind of forgetting I
need to jump
thank you
[Music]
my name is
something people say like Pom-Pom or
something
which in Swedish one is about p a m
it would also be spelled with an a
unless I mean unless you you're going to
be playing playing that it's not fair
[Music]
all right
I do know they want pants but PA and but
how else would you see it like on
on
um
it's so hard to
doesn't like I don't change it
I mean
it's fine
but it's just that people try to ask me
how it's pronounced like well it's
pronounced you know oh no no no no
that's but that's what I'm saying no you
don't know no you're not
[Music]
but it's fine
I I'm not I'm not commenting that on
anyone it's only it's only when people
ask like how is it actually pronounced
when
they're not not
talking about it
so yeah
[Music]
and that slide crash slides
it is running animation does not have
anything
I guess I'll jump one
I was I was thinking if I do a dump jump
which is safe look at all that thing I
would not be able to get there in time I
guess I would have so hard I mean
come on
always listening the mask on that point
I'm just trying to come up with things
to say
good
whatever
I'm reviewed
they just told it's not open and
everything shouldn't there be like a
three second box or something
[Music]
oh close
let me through wait where am I supposed
to go
I'm nowhere to go
come on hand on it
wow
I guess that worked
and it opened
yeah
I guess it's nothing
when when he said nothing that's right
yeah I kill it because it was a huge but
I also that is I tried to open it right
now
I had to kill him
[Music]
hey if it's not the first this is
the first anyway
never mind
[Music]
sometimes this opens like sometimes it's
up sometimes it's down
yeah how long time did that take
I mean I don't need to continue at this
point
that you can't be very long time oh
thank you I mean if it if I didn't get
attacked by that one I guess you had to
attack me it's that's just how it works
anyway
oh
yeah
but it is the lowest level after I get
this I complete this game 100
.
I haven't jumping
and now it didn't lift its arms
so I should not expect it to do that
I didn't know
[Music]
captain on the side of the arrow boxes
[Music]
it would be nice with someone
consistency because it didn't have
smallest things
foreign
what am I supposed to do
[Music]
ah game me acting like this
who made this lemon
nice it has its armor up and I touched
all the things that
I have to touch something all right
oh
my
okay
foreign
[Music]
just as I was
to attack
base 11 yeah and it seems like the
Spanish language I except that snow now
of course the snow level of Grace
I don't know if there's no level wasn't
waste
I don't think I should go on a spine
spinny things no job yeah
that's no never so I guess it's not snow
lemons in general but it's just bad
level
it just to be fair
okay let's see
oh
King
all right thank you thank you
for the right thing
bonus
oh thank you oh kind of loud so that's
fine
fine fine
yeah
thank you to count
I got all 20 relics on 20 crystals all
20 what should I do this one now
I don't know let's do it again it's a
pretty easy lemon so
it's usually
it's not that interesting but I mean
this question is stupid so
I don't know where the blue one is
carcakes you just destroyed your head
it's colored gem you know that comes
back every time I face up against me
a cookie
no yellow color Jam is gone
could you
goodbye cortex yes leaves
okay this is the I shouldn't be skipping
through this group okay and what have
you done to us
or you would pay a little bit good I
know
it's chasing me
actually have knives now
just keeping a bit of the Dinos
okay
excuse me
[Music]
okay
secret ending yeah and I was giving him
to his Taylor
it's ignore that there's not the first
time I've done it
I need that so I can run through this
apparently
it's so quick
no quick
no what time is what
about that was sliding
oh my
God can I get a chance please
all right
thank you
come on that's just cheating
hey
[Music]
there we go I need to go see that for
some reason unless I got the power up I
can destroy this
well good thing I had a second mask
I didn't see it it was behind a stupid
game
this is this is not how you
make things fine
foreign
[Music]
hello Lily
I was definitely pressing the button
this time
[Music]
[Music]
daddy hang on
I'm gonna get like
I'm definitely lost 14 knives now
where's my second mask I should get it
started now
I definitely need one
facing at home
can you jump over him let him destroy
them instead probably
but that sounds advanced
that turns out way too quickly
maybe you intend to do that right too
much skin for me
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
so it looks like you could jump on
now I just have to reach the end of
something
[Music]
advantages that time
and start early
I don't have any extra nice this time
I'm like ready and it's when I'm fine
I want to start with an extra mask I did
is we're at the cortex all over again
hey Why didn't it move it
well I guess this is going to take a bit
extra time
you're tired
so much stuff happened today
it's like
he didn't even Shoot Me by standing
there
control
well
[Music]
get on extra nice back now I got 19.
I wonder this level is easy so far next
to life so
[Music]
oh
yeah
what have you done you have destroyed
this damn nasty crystals they're under
us during power of the minimized side
and pick them up and everyone sucks
together into a monster
and then the monster comes and Chase
crash
that's fine
because you aren't even a mask right
before the stack up
this time
thank you
I'm feeling this back when I'm hanging
them behind you on machine
this doesn't make any sense
like why why would it be scared if you
crash
again
[Music]
can you sleeping off that that box
[Music]
thank you
even though it should be fine I don't
know
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
oh no
you can do the counties to counter there
we go there's an 11.
no it's
freaking out
let's have this wait this is the exam
ending
it's not the record 30 weeks
we're on reverse stairs
the cash wasn't on the ass
when it was enlarged
in the end that means that they crash
did not get enlarged so now he's tiny
oh yeah finally done boom
on
101 the extra extra one there for
defeating the bonus plan
oh my oh I'm tired
I'm tired
but I did it
finding it
this is my impressed face oh
look how impressed you are you too yeah
I'll be tired now
I did it though
[Music]
stuff
yeah yeah
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
let's add cash on Steam
at comsteen
they think some shapes or something
there's some art
that I guess there's nothing to change
here on when it comes to art
and now we can do they completely one I
don't know
do whatever you might you want
at least the one that's waning
foreign
yes I'll get to that when I get to that
and
I think it's
next crash game tomorrow hopefully it's
not this annoying we'll see hopefully
[Music]
