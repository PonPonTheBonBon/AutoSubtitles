so oh wow what what you

what what is

wow but

oh I actually I was thinking that I

could play another game which is not

like an amazing

[Music]

game I said that another time too but

I'm still playing that one so let's give

it a try

been going up for half an hour oh that

sounds good it is this

game this game here we

go son computer and same in Europe

per

no there we go son complete gent here

present very very

slow a sugar and Rockets production you

should have the crash by good voice

here there is no Cru final data in your

memory card no this first time I started

game what do you think in association

with

Mas

Nakamura HTTP

ww- europe.com

Kishi

final I should have changed the title

when did this game come

out did it say it's here no kurushi

final

um

99

okay we

go let's change the title then K

final and change the

category 63 followers this is a rare

game let's do the regular

mode hey you made this

game what this yeah it's a rocket and

what

it anyway let's go into the final

mode which is the standard

mode I didn't want to brag but this game

although it's it this game is slightly

older than the other game I was

[Music]

playing

let's do normal you can unlock all the

characters but you're all only able to

use able there we

go are you

[Music]

standard seure three looks nice for some

re you can see anyway here is the game

works oh there's a q yes there's a q

each outfit is on for 15 minutes first

stage so this is how game works you

place a mark you capture it and there we

go perfect and then you did you do it in

a certain number this is a puzzle game

if that wasn't

[Music]

obvious I did this in one

move I mean you can save

these unless that shows

up is this the correct

move I think

so

wao and then you're not supposed to take

and break the black

ones don't hurt the black

ones and the music is

very

[Music]

nice able disable yeah you got the

joke AR my joke is perfect his first

levels are very

easy just to get hang of the

[Music]

game I take everything back you are my

best friend again wait I'm sorry sorry

what I should definitely look into what

you

[Music]

wrote

oh no I did something

wrong you can do that I don't think

you're meant to do that but you can do

that

okay after that same time and you you

scam me out of 300

points no no I see know what you meant

no it's a q system so you'll get your

outfit in 10 more minutes when the time

is

14:40

5

you're unable disable can we

C was it that bad of a

joke I thought it was a fun

[Music]

joke I am I am the pun p p p p p pun you

should you should all appreciate all my

jokes I

make

[Music]

doesn't matter doesn't count as a move

only if this roll that count as a

move ability is

able good oh hi

it

excellent a great joke I can only do it

because his name is

[Music]

able

I mean they they fa that

name I'm definitely doing this

wrong

maybe maybe not maybe that was how we

supposed to do it but there we go that's

the first perfect first stage

done N Out of nine

perfect and then you get as th000 points

for each of

these which is the stage size which is

um 16 plus the N extra cut and then some

[Music]

dramatic second stage and then there's

some voice in the

background second stage

is dramatic

dramatically oh there we

go

excellent dies of cringe I'm sorry

excuse

me I'm not

cringe you're cringe for suggesting that

I'm

[Music]

cringe depending which order you destroy

the

SC and also a square can only have one

attribute so you can override it out to

do it like

that lot of tricks you can use those

black boxes have some serious

moves yeah when

U there's a fast forward

[Music]

button so you don't have to wait for the

blocks to move all the way

down there we go that's why it also Zoom

sounds

[Music]

perfect celebration so yeah this is

basically the whole game it of course

gets harder over

[Music]

time don't think that was what I was

supposed to do but I'll

[Music]

continue how about

[Music]

this I mean it

[Music]

works

wa excellent this game is bringing back

your m is B the Blockbuster rent did you

rent this game back in the day

this this is basically same but slightly

slightly

different slightly slight

different but I mean I should solve it

in the same way

now hello hello unlimited

stick good to have an unlimited amount

of

stick we can also move this quickly too

if you

want

[Music]

wa I wasn't supposed to do

that

anyway it

works anyway it first nonperfect um

tried to be clever

but is just a great

great

oh 14 out of 15

perfect such

shame I should be ashamed of

[Music]

myself this is

unacceptable only perfect score is

[Music]

valid there we go

perfect I did b b couldn't comprehend

the cube yeah I can understand

that yeah I don't need

[Music]

this

okay L kind of plays

itself

yeah it's

um

perfect it's it's nice game if you want

to do some

mental

training Japanese are known for their

puzles mental

[Music]

puzzles

[Music]

and then one

more wa

[Music]

no for those who don't know Blockbuster

was a video rental face yeah I mean

that's I assumed it was something with

rentals because it was a rental was in

original

coming he I'm surprised you know what

black was before your time yeah exactly

Rocky man you're not allowed to know

anything before your time it closed down

in my town when I was fairly young but

I'm familiar okay okay it was ex existed

when you alive fair enough fair enough

you get a pass I do not understand this

game how what is I'm I'm solving it for

you how do you not understand this I

thought that was because black wasn't in

sweding or something I'm

just I mean Rocky man is not in

Sweden yeah so I mean that's the first

[Music]

thing I'm un sure if you know this or

not but I'm 8 years old ah that does

explain a lot of

[Music]

things I'm not I mean not 8 years

old

yeah otherwise I have to ban

[Music]

you maybe I shouldn't have done that one

[Music]

first I'm doing this one completely

wrong this is not how Sol

[Music]

this

yeah nine

moves

awful B me is that a promise right I

[Music]

mean is eight 90 and

[Music]

also everything 17 hits I mean it's not

it's it's the only oh look swimsuit that

is

um the

[Music]

um it's not like that kind of punishment

that I assume you

want which one should I do first let's

go with this

one then

this got

[Music]

that oops I reacted too early I destroy

that Black Cube I'm sorry Black

Cube don't be mad at me that means

nothing that's a

failure not even a fail is just nothing

is the announcer is instant embarrassed

and is

[Music]

quiet wait I did that

[Music]

wrong

[Music]

ah yes I'm a valid member of the

community I have to

stay but yet despite that you sometimes

appear late like

today I me wasn't that bad

[Music]

today taking P Pon for

[Music]

award there you go this inside

[Music]

so it's a fun game right what do you

mean do you understand this game now

perfect to be late

I don't

know if you're late that means you have

time to show

up but if you're not showing up at all

that means that you busy that

[Music]

day

[Music]

you should be able to sneak through

here when the block

lifts since the blocks are not Cinders

perfect looks fun still don't understand

well you use the blue x button to create

a blue square which is locked to the

[Music]

grid and

[Music]

then you can press the x button

again that turns into red squares and

when blocks lands on those red squares

the blocks

[Music]

die should done that but whatever

think or does two hits gave you 400

points in that case it doesn't actually

matter then when you take a Green

[Music]

Block you can use the the green button

the

triangle to explode a lot of them at the

same

[Music]

time

and then in top right corner it tells

you how many moves you should be able to

dotin I can do by doing that which I

guess you could call an exploit but I do

allow you to do it because as as long as

you do move you can play several red

SES they didn't should limit you to one

but that's what they deigned

that you want to getting green blocks

first well you have to get them in a

certain pattern because you're not

allowed to destroy the Black Block

blocks

therefore

yeah four

stage oh no the music becomes better

dramatic like I can get that first the C

doesn't start

counting

I'm oh lag bike not W game lag

[ __ ] until I break the first

block somehow I should was supposed to

be able to do that in one move

barrier cuz I got seven out of

[Music]

six

[Music]

that

went that's what happens when you do a

mistake got this

[Music]

first I

win h

[Music]

andoun being so embarrassed he doesn't

say

[Music]

anything and boom

and boom boom look at

that so what about airline

food

[Music]

well this I'm currently on top of a

large

uh

thing in outer

space but I don't think they serve food

up here

you can't see the stars because the

[Music]

uh because the thing used to capture the

the footage which cannot see the

[Music]

Stars this thing is in the way

now and that

works get a perfect that's what sounds

right there is an end in this

[Music]

game

luckily can I beat the game that's the

big

question wait that should be a

[Music]

prediction when I beat the

game

yes no that's basically

it I beat it or afraid to beat

it I don't think there is yeah resume is

resum

perfect the ways I can lose the game is

by breaking too many black boxes so

the so the allines are

no

uh so the area I can work within gets

too small that I cannot work within it

[Music]

basically or I destroy like for each

Black Box I destroy I lose a

line each

um each time I destroy a block I also

don't get the the perfect or great so it

doesn't give me so it doesn't give me an

extra line

either and as the playable area

shrinks it also gets harder to okay I'm

not sure how Sol this

[Music]

Lev so let's go do

[Music]

this

this was obviously not the solution

but I guess it

[Music]

works yeah and also if I if I let the

the bottom right are for great squares

it will count up for every non black

block block that falls over the

edge and also I can risk getting

squished by the block that's also not a

good

[Music]

idea no I can't take

that okay now I can by destroying back

on and just getting

[Music]

that yeah is completely

[Music]

wrong

and the

uh and it will get harder and harder so

when I beat this is the second last

penultimate

[Music]

one could I place

it shouldn't tell well I can't do that

so it's fine it's

fine

[Music]

St I wonder what the speed run in this

game would be

[Music]

like at this point doesn't matter if I

do that trick

because and when I beat this L this one

that should be halfway through the

game and I'm already

struggling not to give any hints or

anything

[Music]

but there been quite a while since I

played this last I haven't played it in

the past if that not

[Music]

obvious no you know I'm just dis

naturally good at this game without

knowing anything about the

game yeah I'm definitely messing up

getting perfect

now I'm still getting great

so

[Music]

right

then you can skip this to there's a

moment for me to read the

[Music]

chat fth stage fifth stage oh look

[Music]

waffles shiny

wles

this is have you s this

[Music]

[Music]

S

[Music]

easy

perfect

[Music]

all right let's see

[Music]

sh and

[Music]

then yeah you get 200 points for every

hits doesn't matter how many you get at

the same time five hits plus th000

points

[Music]

no

excellent

excellent true

genius see the game games myell lot of

[Music]

compliments

[Music]

has a bit of

a moment there at the edge of this

Lev

okay so much for being a true gen oh not

much left level

here getting kind of

tight

[Music]

[Music]

even though I utilize that trick I

thought I was going to get an exent it's

just a perfect

anime but we need someone to not think

that will win otherwise there won't be

any points divide it

out

otherwise they won't be you know

[Music]

winners if everyone is a winner no one

[Music]

is I'm completely nothing this up this

is not how we supposed to solve

it

[Music]

17 out of 10

[Music]

terrible then she say Terri

there we go 7

7 7,800 versus

500 it looks like people are believing

in

[Music]

[Music]

me

[Music]

there we go that's another one

and this is the proun

[Music]

again not to long of a game I

[Music]

guess the L has a certain way they Des

[Music]

sign wait why is this eight of nine I

don't think I use that trick

anytime I just found a better solution

like that okay or did I use the trick I

don't think he

did cuz if you use the

trick it's much easier to get an exent

but right I need you get that

[Music]

one

[Music]

and there we go who so and then I was bu

for Black Box to move before I remove

them but it wasn't last level

[Music]

anyway looks like I do the hydr again

looks like ponon is back in your dress

and out of

space plus the check okay iate

okay this sound in this game

sometimes sixth stage SI

stage sick

stage now

[Music]

it's now the music becomes a be evil

[Music]

[Music]

something

[Music]

can exent on the first one then just

downhill from

[Music]

here supposed to

this

stage and now I'm just

going

[Music]

yeah this is not the

solution it works

[Music]

but there we

go

again

great show how Sur the eighth

stage hello fish Vibes thank you for not

believing in

me

[Music]

oops

I won saying that yes because yes there

some points in both

directions I might showing off my skills

in this game right now

but don't expect that to last

[Music]

forever actually can actually get the

perfect if I use that on one I know

you're going to win but someone had to

be the sacrificial pawn and thank

you for being the sacrificial

[Music]

Pawn I'm going to do my M because I do

want to

[Music]

win all right I need

this

oh still going to do

it I'm surprised it actually

worked

perfect jellyfish giving some good vibes

in here okay last uh round for the

six the six stage

[Music]

sh thank

youing it's not that I have to read

otherwise it will affect my game play

that's that's

unacceptable

all

right stop go

here wait I did in wrong order doesn't

matter I mean I have 30 moves I supposed

to do

eight it's not that I don't believe in

you it's because the point rati is

incredibly in my favor that is true if

you also put in 500 that means that you

will win 50% off 7,000 800 points

right and

[Music]

uh that's a good

[Music]

amount this music is still very evil

sounding long is not too

long I mean it's kind of long

but oh no nice any

[Music]

Works Boop and

then Boop

perfect and last one too thir night

excellent ends with the perfect perect

I'm going to head out now P have a good

rest stream thank you for being here R

[Music]

worked

this man minute is that the L thing man

logo I

see

what

oh the bionic

[Music]

K I see is the one being refer to

[Music]

here but he man yeah

still believe I will mess up somewhere

and then lose the whole

game then bionic and jellyfish will be

happy we

winning that for my

loss but happy for winning the

[Music]

battle

[Music]

W

excellent bread bun bun I like excellent

how the main character in this game

looks like a medieval

peasant I think it's meant that he's

supposed to wear a suit beige suit

[Music]

but but sure I'm a evil

peasant I guess that's the same thing a

modern day

[Music]

peasant hello

GS I don't know what that

is

not much left of the level

there this is seven

so and whatever is called round two out

of three stage seven out of

[Music]

eight let's do that

[Music]

yeah making

[Music]

mistakes I shouldn't have done

[Music]

that

carefully removing the remaining

blocks that was a careful move but

[Music]

anyway and if you're really bad it's if

if the announcer is really embarrassed

about your game play he can demand that

you have to redo the whole

level

[Music]

no

stop speaking of Ming

up yeah that was really

bad now the level is

[Music]

breaking I don't I don't know how much

will be left after this

done

[Music]

yeah I think he might have a concussion

[Music]

enough yep and not much left of the

level yeah but I only have to survive

these levels here so it's fine

like it's very very close to the edge of

11 there we

go great thank you for one piece more to

work it I mean plus the extra that level

took up

because of each level I

do the the back it moves this the first

one of is cuz it's so close to the

[Music]

edge 19 moves that a lot of

[Music]

moves again still making

[Music]

mistakes

F the mistake

[Music]

making not much left of that level of

this stage

[Music]

[Music]

okay made too many mistakes

already

[Music]

ah

perfect okay I I did it

perfect remember to take part the

prediction if you haven't done that yet

is the final stage

now I had not much left of that

[Music]

level excitement builds for the final

stage

wait

stage is it the final stage after the

eth

stage or is it 10th stage being final oh

my it's start lagging now I don't know

it just

stream no this is not the final stage I

was wrong I said that's part of the

prediction me being wrong about

[Music]

stuff did say beat the game and then

specify the eighth stage which is

apparently not the final stage I'm sorry

about

that what's

wrong hello for girl I mean I assume

youve been here this all time but oh no

the F FAL Pon is disappointed with my

failure oh

no okay now now she can be really

disappointed with

me the it's the ninth or 10th stage

being the

[Music]

final is it like two levels per I think

this level

[Music]

massive again I'm not supposed to do

that

they keep doing

[Music]

it that's

one oh let me at least get a great

[Music]

thing

the running back and

[Music]

forth and then I must take this as

well and there that's

it great great not going to that great

to be honest

at least I only have to two

levels L three as

before this damage should work

[Music]

right is it now

ah I should

have bit one step F

[Music]

back

maybe me gu St worked but it's not the

solution

oh no no no no no no no no oh I need

it that was

close worst thing I can do disappointed

[Music]

one great yeah that was

close

[Music]

I'm trying but I shouldn't try just me

failing but on these big

[Music]

levels okay go go go wait there's

disappointed funny among

[Music]

[Music]

those okay there we go another

LEL

right yeah I wish I could change the

title makes sense that I can't change

the

title the prediction they want to sh you

on too but she looks so

disappointed she hasn't learned how to

Cher

yet okay look at this

now oops I press that next 37 hit 7,400

points just like that

that was an easy one

perfect

perfect sh what's this one move okay I

can do

this

done what language are you

writing

okay it's either the ninth stage or the

final stage it could just be that I saw

the eighth stage was the final stage but

the final stage is after the eth

stage

the

okay some outfit for the final stage

if it's this the final stage yes it's

not even a final stage just final final

stage but voice say final stage final

stage okay wait isn't the same

music I mean the music fits

[Music]

but is this new music I'm just used to

the final

music

um what am I supposed to

[Music]

do okay excitement builds

now now is the big moment for me to show

my final

skills now I'm stuck St

block probably block me in same color as

the environment which makes sense

but out what that

[Music]

is

well we go that's a great at

[Music]

least I guess the swim fits with it

thing

right

[Music]

that was

[Music]

close

um yes that's this

[Music]

boom

perfect

perfect I kind of I'm not planning so

much in 42 perfect I'm not planning so

much in advance I'm just going with it

and just see see how things

goes if I get the perfect then perfect

if I don't so

[Music]

wi okay ready more

[Music]

explosions perfect not really sure when

they do this I mean they have space to

do these kind of snakes but they're not

exactly hard

okay that's not exactly how I'm supposed

to do

it you not havep to do with missing

[Music]

him yeah completely messed up that

one

[Music]

there we

go time for

[Music]

explosions right okay last

round last two last

two

levels last two

puzzles

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

piece

didn't mess that

[Music]

up and now I only get a

[Music]

great

[Music]

yeah I should have play probably

[Music]

[Music]

one

o didn't mean to do

that

[Music]

anyway he was supp find

one this mean we get the ending

scene I did

it and then the game is like secret

right on

stage

okay let's see what's happen

now level breaks

down

r r

[Music]

[Music]

figure

and I Now understand this game okay do

you understand what's going on

[Music]

[Music]

now having left this surreal world to

return to Everyday Life you might feel

as if nothing had

changed but there has been one major

change you

yourself your trials have given you

courage and

decisiveness in The Surreal world of

karushi you are exposed to trials in

many

forms and in the Ordinary World in which

we live there are also many hidden

trials

[Music]

lurking the courage and and decisiveness

you have gained will serve you well no

matter what obstacles you face in the

future good

luck yes he was just on a floating

platform where blocks were trying to

crush him and he could

create oh c the bus

demon H created blue squares underneath

him that could destroy blocks and then

with magical power could explode the

green

blocks green blocks can create explosion

and how the platform breaks and if he's

not careful

enough he could fall off the whole thing

and die but now just back to the regular

life and pretend like nothing has

happened

it was a rectangular all along I mean it

was always

one that was kind of what game was

playing

on him in the middle of the road to nowh

it was a

town all the keeps destroyed along the

way were innocent bystanders player um

pon pon Ki final I have an IQ 443

Cube

planner

[Music]

excitement that was interesting

actors in video

[Music]

games but maybe I can find

exciting

to play that

again first name Pawn last name p no

first name pon

pon I already 100 Attack Mode

or that way you could see I guess it's

the same settings

here that character

textures

anyway in attack it's basically 100

selected levels from the game I don't

know if there is exactly 100 levels in

the game number one number

one and your goal is

to figure out how to get the Perfect

Score there we

go

perfect

me the name

alons a

com an

answer oh yeah if you try it once I

think it allows you it tells you what

the solution

is which number

two kind

of ruins the whole point of a puzzle

yeah it doesn't matter try

[Music]

everything I have to wait for that thing

anyway

perfect

perfect yeah and then you

basically

continue like

that two 100 perfect

W or two of The 100

perfect but

yeah perfect wait do rabbits
