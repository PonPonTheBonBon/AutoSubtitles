anything from

so dragons get power from destroying
wood
[Music]
I missed all this or has this recipe
somehow
it's a
experience points for
come on
[Music]
because I don't
hear any obvious switches or anything
although there is a roof I should climb
up on and see if I can cut over
maybe there was something there because
I feel that jumping in everyday we did
it
I should try it again
foreign
[Applause]
[Music]
okay more armor pieces
oh
really simply gets all the other pieces
but this is I saw wounds attacking
enemies
increased attack speed
that sounds interesting
let's probably goes three pieces
got four seconds
that's one Morehead

I guess it's kind of equal
that one fell down like this like
suspicious
but you can't do anything about okay can
I fly um over here

that one's boring yeah I was I was
hoping to do something interesting and
why are you still in the building

the house is gonna get on fire you can't
get down now
[Music]
is this process Expo I guess so
I wanted I wanted like faster Elemental
experience
all right
no one's complaining about the fire yeah
trying to enjoy however as evidence for
them looking at his friend means after
yeah yeah like the first piece
second piece Maybe
even the third piece
that was very difficult time with all
those books
but this is the seventh piece
[Music]
yeah just wanted
obviously destroying everything here
as you got more of these
I like collecting everything that's good
oh hey yes

again spider you've done more than
anyone could expect of it how are you
supposed to come back soon
is that you are here and what's more
you've returned with your companions
well it's not like I've really had much
of a choice in the matter seeing as how
we're stuck together
to me
Mason what do you make of this
never have I seen such a thing it has
the mark of evil likely crafted by
malaphor himself
I feel we shall not be able to remove it
what but there has to be a way how can
we fight back if we're made to fight
like this spider oh Cinder you have done
well to get this far despite this I
don't want to respect is
but allow it to be a reminder of the
bond you to share
your Destinies are now intertwined yeah
so why is it

another surprise their armor hey I mean
it's a prevented cutscene so

by issuing its destruction oh
beast moves to moves too quickly we
can't possibly catch up with it the set
oven Pursuit would be useless useless
then we shall wait for it to come back
and intercept it before it completes its
Circle
pass underground if we are to possess
the element of surprise
the size it is our only hope of getting
into position in time
without allowing malafort and over the
city has been left unguarded
[Music]
these doors were built as an exit to our
city not for going back here they have
to be opened from the inside Spyro
Cinder we will assemble the troops of

skip that one
what did they say
hey
so if I spend too much time collecting
stuff
that I
okay I was supposed to do something with
these
I guess I'll just try every element
definitely not
oh yeah thank you
favorite element
let's see how it looks like you can walk
in here
maybe it's a ghost
ah I see
let's see
[Music]
this is that's why you need these things
thank you so you can fly
so cute by the way what's cute
and that's your show islands and besides
down and not already yeah I'm sure they
programmed me
them to understand in One Direction
release
okay you're supposed to pick up please
and only one
Sim only one who plays in that platform
but when you're holding one
nine
I guess that's something
that's not in the shadow one
that is what he's
that's why that's why I need this thing
and this is the second time in the game
when I said the dragons can fly and
therefore
I don't need those things but
you know you can't really fly with this
thing because apparently this is very
heavy anyway
you hold it
well Cinder activate
wait how am I supposed to get spiders to
stand still here while I go out the
other side I think
it's right stay here
be a good dog and stay there
do we really have to go back to the
surface it might be safer down here
James prior this isn't working
release
it traffic
yeah the chain isn't long enough to
reach um
so I basically have to
[Music]
okay
your voice
my voice is cute
okay okay yeah I'm glad you think it's
key that makes me happy
I want to be cute
that's all that's my whole scene here
okay I will prepare this thing about it
on time
okay
and then I should prepare near
this bridge
it's so cute
it's okay
so
one two
now to other side
three four and then just run run around
like fastest you have ever flown
very we are on a timely
what up that wasn't picking out didn't
run
skip over the debris
[Music]
and then you fly fast this year and
[Music]
they're running out of time
so this isn't the solution already
yep yep it preaches
I mean here's the obvious solution I
just realized
[Music]
there's this thing here
and then I closely
okay that seems too obvious
well I figured it out
yeah you're so cute thank you
it does make me so happy
come on
well and answer why did I miss up the
left ones not the right one
okay
wow
okay I still thought my idea was
interesting I mean this is obviously the
easy solution I was thinking about it a
bit
more than annuity
okay
I online
yeah yes I am still online I mean I'm
scheduled for another hour so
yeah
I understand the first day
online
I mean I guess you say hey okay not a
online I I thought it sounded funny
oh nice yeah
I mean I have a schedule
[Music]
that was quite review
[Music]
strong
that's clearly no it was temporary
it doesn't have something here
he doesn't have a health bar like the
other buses step back I'll take over
from here
I'm I'm singing
I think like Airport
am I supposed to
do
something left me okay
[Music]
sister on me
[Music]
I don't feel like the system isn't that
hey it's definitely not like boiling
what
something is spread with the temperature
thing in it
ah
my way to get back now I can see if I'm
missing them okay now now the fan
started
fire engine fire was situation okay
so it's specifically this one
I have three more to do
that kind of interesting
so yes I guess
I guess I should just find the
three more I can count
yeah I definitely have enough stuff with
this one another smelly
and then I need 3705
three
seven thousand five hundred
which I like less than 10 is more like
nine thousand left to get it can that
should be a problem
but if princess pumpkin's favorite soda
to drink
what is
yeah that is what if what is Princess
favorite so that to drink if she could
decide even if she may be do not drink
soda is a drink thank you very much I I
actually sell them myself
you mentioned one either way yeah
exactly I'll do it I actually have I
have a favorite soda because I was
I actually don't remember
me trying it
and
okay but there is one there
because I
[Music]
think how should I say
I just need to remember
um
yeah uh I have visited a friend in
Hungarian
and there I got to try
one brand but America
and they have a raspberry soda
and I do like it a lot
too much so basically that's the only
thing I was thinking right there was
and so okay
so and yeah
and I wouldn't mind having more of it
obviously it's hard to get back in
Sweden
it also has a very so it says like
it is a great taste it has low sugar
content
I think for being soda I'm drinking red
like it has less sugar than
like orange juice like a completely
and
it doesn't have any substitute because I
know that's some
diet soda types can have like
um like well it's not sugar and it still
has an unhealthy
substitute of some sort
and finally it is really really cheap
which is a pretty
good
so yeah
raspberry soda is so amazing yeah
and it's really really cheap
let's remember setting things
maybe it's an interesting somewhere
I I probably can just you have any quick
side note
[Music]
I kept uh playing game when I started
here
where's the price
wait wait
why do you have a website with products
but no prices
it has
72 kilojoule energy per 100 milliliter
it has like four percent
sugar
you guys think it's very low it doesn't
have any substance Personnel but
[Music]
um
just don't remember the price of it
because it's really really cheap
they also have
they also have a little chicken fish
with zero percent sugar but I mean why
do you need that when it's actually this
is orange okay
was it like this one
um
that might be
um I think
yes that is the one
pounds 59.
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
there we go here's some princess but
Hey Brother ID doesn't show up okay I'm
not 30 we haven't figured out how much
it costs you it's a secret
there we go
of course it's there so you can get that
two and a half liters for one
let's convert it to euro or one and a
half year of
where two two and a half liters
that that is a much better price
I need you
hey that's cheap yeah
I'm not sure why it's so expensive
written it okay
and enough so
[Music]
and
really so it's really good
like
I do take the price into consideration
too because of course I could probably
find myself that I
even tasty but
it's more like the price and
the sugar content I guess
for some reason I feel like this is
[Music]
and it's probably something worth it in
here
[Music]
it's probably fences there
it may be because costing too must
import it and yeah I mean it is heavy
because it's it's basically working
defense
I'm an aggressive dragon can I rotate
the camera please can I use it like what
so this this I don't like I want to see
where I'm going
back to my classified
so yeah it's probably available
let me take over
yeah man
[Music]
I don't know let's get more green energy
is
it
stands
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay finally
oh what is this
yeah now dancing
[Music]
in it
oh this one seems to Flame okay
no problem
I can do it
I said Dot
glowing behind the pillar this girl is
as strong it's still sleeping
not to get distracted by any glowing
lights
you're saying that it's
is it really overheating
should I stopped playing
because it says increasing fat
it's shining perfectly fine
thanks guys
so it's like a
thing
[Music]
okay so that's a scene probably only for
puzzles okay
I was gonna say that wasn't one thing to
unlock no idea
and that was fast
yes so this one didn't have the crystal
and
so
blind
[Music]
Ed oh no it was nice to see I was gonna
say oh wait there's I don't come but
there are anywhere
you need to take care of Defense
[Music]
thank you thank you
thank you
foreign
[Music]
is it
is
meat crisp
my question is does each Crystal have a
specific location depending which one
you forget why do we have to place them
in a specific order and all decreases
are the same
foreign
let's play
I'll say that
so there is one up there right
check it out
so I can go back here and then
oh that is nice one
that that's
gets to vacuum here
at the wrong button
thank you
oh yeah and then I might stay able to
get to the other one
[Music]
like that that doesn't say how I'm
supposed to do it but I guess it hurts
yeah that's the other one
easy
my stuff like this okay
oh I see
oh that's what I think
that's it
differently once done but
no way
I should be able to get in here
[Music]
uh yeah
I really miss a good look around this
place and I'll be used to eat
with the camera
there's this waterfall that means I
can't fly apparently that somehow pushes
them down see if I try to fly around
here yeah the waterfronts
pushing it down just the existence of
the waterfallon which is that
hello anyway I got it to you
blue ones I want to stick it
the effect was almost here
I saved them how was your name again I
don't remember yeah
I was saying it's 37 000 I had the two
two thousand more
so I just go back to the store to start
by the new location
oh excuse me
foreign
[Music]
that's what's going on
does that mean there's like more secret
bosses in this level or something
all right shifts and Iceland
I got it I still
[Music]
[Music]
have to try again
I miss him
[Music]
okay
yeah
I'm just shooting from here
[Music]
[Music]
Don't Push Me Down
[Music]
let me see coupons
I was in The Fairy mode
makes me like Earth's power
they should have made brown or something
[Music]
random stuffy
um
foreign
[Music]
okay
then just wait for another pistol
he's been growing yeah there we go
very quickly
thank you
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
beautiful white
enemy okay still like wait how do I see
it's not that funny it's this many
and
the reservoir okay so there is only one
because it wasn't like one of them one
of each place
one and I accidentally stumbled upon
that one
you did amazing thank you
I thought it was pretty easy but
I guess salad did plan it out how to do
it and things
I think this is in here
is this going to that
apparently
oh they're walking walking
77 I am 45 now
I'm saying that
means
he's one version one more to get
what do you say
all the artists use cloak of Shadows but
Square repeatedly descends Shadow class
with this this is the same strength okay
so that can actually look back on this
one
baby
well
[Music]
hello
[Music]
[Music]
I'm hitting
server then let's see if I explained
anyways
[Music]
let's open this game
or that thing what happens if like this
that's actually open again
what happens if Cindy goes in there and
then runs out of Mala I think that gets
stuck
yeah that would be okay
oh I didn't mean to fall down here let's
try
but this must be that earlier I was
trying to get that
sorry about this part no okay not sorry
I can't remember anything
it would be awkward otherwise
we are here to leave you behind to get
squished
[Music]
he made it
or somehow parents around the corner for
some reason
[Music]
right I guess
I guess I'm gonna go back and see if we
can get up again
wait
wait a minute this doesn't make any
sense where is that all
where did you fall through
[Music]
this makes no sense at all
[Music]
[Music]
like this one there
can I get to that one
yeah there we go
I didn't see them with two of them
apparently there were four of them at
least
and back to the secret boss
wait there's a thing here
yeah the hole is fixed oh very bad
we can pass
thank you
come on
let's say was there anything else
because
just fell down in that hole
and
send anything else to reach out from
there
and then
like
yeah I should say I made Mass progress
now
and this is getting dark in here
I'm gonna take the camera please oh this
one here
oh yeah
[Music]
so
it must be
it must be a continuation on this area
here
and that has some Crystal I can pick up
because then there's also one of these
on the other side
is
yeah because I yeah I
was a team here I actually
dancing with it because I fell down this
whole
because
holy you can fall down through but you
can't get up
see because he falls through serious
there's a hole in the there's a hole in
the roof because you're not the hole in
the sea
and what
hmm
let's just continue and see if I can do
something about that later
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
it's just there in case you run out of
my life
[Music]
all right one time am I doing that so
it's 30 so I need to activate that
somehow
there's nothing down here
must be something with this area
everything oh I see
is that a certainly like physical scene
and where is the time
[Music]
thing I'll eat
I am a bit confused
[Music]
[Music]
nothing much
don't have enough
it seems like you should be able to grab
onto that thing
but
okay okay I see
okay spy you can't sit there because you
can't get it I just bad at it
okay good
how are you gonna play this thing
and then we take this key as you can see
and put it in the keyhole that we found
it
[Music]
nice
and where's the bus
wait wait okay this felt too easy very
simple
um
what is the big
big scary
thing I had to battle
and there must be something yeah
okay
okay
could you sleep but
something experience in here
okay
I guess nothing
what you were insane
thank you
Mr President here

specific place to be looking

that wasn't
supposed to button
[Music]
there I got some simple Treasures
I guess that way
oh look at look at that
[Music]
I am very removing it it also allows you
to get this shortcut that's clearly the
same
[Music]
[Music]
okay that was easy
the second time
[Music]
well it's now finally gains more I'm
gonna
now they have the same amounts I think
it's yes that's in this meter is longer
anyways
[Music]
enemies tell me
it's on fire
place
but this is
hmm
interesting
oh this is why I should use that
swing scene
which way do I go first
[Music]
okay I'll try this swing thing
first
meeting
[Music]
oh that's not happening
I take Camp no
there you go that's
that's the way you do
okay so I switched the spiral
nope that was so sweet
okay
there you go
thank you

perfect nice
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
break through the other side
okay I want to see if I can check out
what that other thing was
what if you let me go back
when I didn't make it back this way
and that's way
Okay so
I need to go to this one thing again
where does this thing come from
maybe I need more help
[Music]
okay
all right
excuse me I did check this
[Music]
I mean if you find the armor that lives
up in the air and starts spinning that
would be kinda
interesting
I think he's pure power that's a
regenerating Health actually that's
that's
interesting power is
specifically for spider
I should have used
out there let's go and get that
I didn't come here
okay fine yeah exactly

about nothing
here we go

free camera
explanation there's a modifications
I don't even know how I would match the
game in first place
[Music]
welcome to everyone
and a weird way of opening the door from
the inside
but
I know what you're thinking spiral
have no worry young dragon we'll make it
I don't understand
is about to destroy everything
but you seem so calm
spend all this effort
if it did not feel threatened but why
should he throughout our history there
is only known to yay
like malaphor your powers go far beyond
what you might imagine
is this my level 4 could have
accomplished anything but instead Joseph
Franklin is amazing anger it's been
continuity great stream yes
then I kind of feel like this late
they believed in him look what happened
spiral
why should I be any different
because I know you
and your heart would not allow
because I believe you are destined for
great things
to bring about a new age
an age of peace
I do not see
role destruction will have in that age
here we are
hitting Kitty
thank you everyone it means a lot to me
glowing door
complete
acidity
let me see one
yes I would change the system clock skin
oh Outdoors
already
whoa
oh you want to
go
I'll keep it up Sparks I think it's
working Sparks cut it out now's not the
time it's never a good time
they might have until midday
you're welcome
Spyro how deep do you think that Canyon
is I don't know
what are you getting at
some awkward scenes faces
my teeth
Cinder you're a genius I have my moments
ignite us can you stall it long enough
to allow us to open the floor if we fill
up the canyon with water it may slow it
down enough to give us a fight
that may work
listen to me
I'm escaping the canyon no matter the
cost
every moment comes you heard the dragon
let's move
[Music]
pressure anything
[Music]
let's hope this is enough
[Music]
thinking graphics
[Music]
okay
[Music]
yeah
admit
teach me
I thank you
you're the queen
you can't do anything wrong okay
[Music]
[Music]
amazing
[Music]
how I make something
no cases
[Music]
something
[Music]
don't take the place on that one
[Music]
watch how it's done
[Music]
I need some power at some point okay
oh there we go there's something here
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
guys my house to work
[Music]
what
I didn't need to step up the platform
but I guess that works
[Music]
then let's climb up and see
what's from here
what is this platform what did that
happen
but did not get anything from that
[Music]
in those things are seems Jesus
[Music]
[Music]
this place also meets one of those
things
[Music]
thank you
coming through
[Music]
no yes there's another one there
[Music]
was everything
[Music]
oh this one
okay
[Music]
open
yeah I guess it's too far yeah I
appreciate you have actually
[Music]
when you find it you can have a good
time
[Music]
okay
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
I'll handle this no
and
[Music]
close camera
[Music]
and you're stupid
I need they have exactly the ideas
it's just stupid
I need to control one of them now
I guess I'm a bit stupid sometimes too
[Music]
thank you
yeah that's how I had to do
and you're smart but I need something
stupid
[Music]
so I meant to go up on this platform
[Music]
[Music]
but watch out
oh it's Valentine
let's do
[Applause]
it let's pull it out
thank you
that doesn't seem like a clear idea to
shower and just water because you know
across this wooden thing
oh that was the one side that was mean
there must be in one of those
they're on this side too
and I didn't miss it so much
yeah because there's nothing to climb
actually
can't be one day
and I can't really bring one across
because this is too big up camp
[Music]
right here fine maybe I go to find the
one
all right
because missing geology
and no one saw that seeing anyone ever
making anything like I can't take one of
these
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
look at this works
[Music]
what was the point of the climbing
section basically just as well Beauty
I don't think this one I I if this was
internal solution
so on the other side too I didn't have
to climb anything
thank you
to be positive in the solution or I
guess they thought about that processing
and I still don't know where the one is
so
[Music]
all right
[Music]
okay
but as I try to pick up
mama
very well
it wasn't that
smart it was principles
[Music]
yeah so there's some quickly racing
walking it's not enough
what else can we do
we have to let all the water out all at
once no no here's what we do we have to
let all the water out all at once
you with me let's blow this damn thing
up
[Music]
oh look I think reinforcements
we better move
all right let's blow this here
go through [ __ ]
parts
ah yes okay
sure
foreign
and everything
or the dragons
because you know what
it's actually been three hours now
I know it's just actually starting to
get tired you know
now a sleepy bun at the moment
and it started to be 15 minutes on these
three things it's a great moment
okay yeah I'm a sleepy bun
[Music]
yeah I was kind of a slow stream today
that's fine sometimes this last dream
and Lolly electric came by that was nice
even if you express myself badly a
heaven somebody
I'm just so awkward
awkward and shy
yeah yeah just
by tomorrow
but uh what most people probably are
exactly you're a kid most people are
excited about is the uh crash which is
on Saturday Sunday
so
if you like Spyro there's more tomorrow
if you want to crash it's a very Sunday
with a quick question
I love you nice people and first I have
a video comment I enjoyed the stream I
got to see
yeah I watched the vote later sure it
was
I enjoyed my stay that sounds great
thanks my stream yeah I had to bless
this hope you have a great evening
though
you did amazing in your business button
thank you for coming by okay
I'm glad he
I am glad that you showed up
and
made your
funny comments yeah we talked about soda
today that was that was fun
so but the thing I was going to ask was
a Monday Tuesday I want to do more art
but it is uh I'm still interested in
doing more emotes
but I have mentioned about doing the
community drawing with our first sellers
but uh
I have have seen that some has had some
yeah more more Watchers
so some have expressed that they are
have been interested in the community
trying
uh but
because people have like these emails so
much
I assume that people are also interested
in emails
so I hope people don't have a chair they
don't mind waiting a bit longer for the
community to join
we get more more time to think of what
or how to how it should be look like and
I think
a b and look like
[Music]
so
no one wait a minute someone has spiral
past the year
as this game they're streaming but it
does not look like spider
[Music]
but what
[Music]
is here
I started two minutes ago so they're
probably going to start this game
yeah they're going to start playing
Spider this is amazing
but they haven't started yet
wait what's going on here
[Music]
okay I see the girl to start streaming
very soon so I guess this is a great
moment to join this team
everything
is fine regardless so long as you take
your time and let's add in your other
streams that you put the effort it's a
great way of thinking I think that's
that's a good very nice message
you're so kind yeah I would probably
enjoy drawing more emotes
and currently
uh
so
I mean
why can't I
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
Let's uh let's let's visit I guess
[Music]

passage I have
just some sharing one punch baby copies

but she is writing comments so hopefully
she
we see it's the rate
and you get 250 where is it 2050
coins for following along

coins for writing a message or something
I think of it
anyway
I miss running out
the way this beginning
