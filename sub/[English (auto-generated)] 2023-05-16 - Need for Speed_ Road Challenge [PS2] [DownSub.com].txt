hello and welcome

and I don't have a very intro

so let's continue

with

the racing game

good luck yeah some people I would

expect to be here right

I'm not here

I need to be better to add informing

people

but

let's begin then hopefully show up at

some points

what is it me or is the game without

let me know if the game is too loud

might blessed me

good evening

are you too loud on their heads

headphones

so let's see where

oh yeah

these two of the circuits on this one

this one bronze in that

and there is that girl

[Music]

so that's where we at

so let's do circuit two Arena

championship

s like he's gonna say extracts two laps

each

we'll be training a Ferrari

550

would that be maraneo

I don't know if

Italian says that what is it paranello

actually I'm read up on my Italian

and hopefully the controller is working

this time

[Music]

and there's no snow go find in Japan but

it's fine

it's just little damage

that's

I should be fine

[Music]

not only the true level of computers so

far

[Music]

well have a slippery

[Music]

and that corner of sharpness shot this

is still still a bit slippery

just a bit

[Music]

[Music]

okay these opponents are actually

more difficult than I expected

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

yeah these opponents are

quite challenging

maybe maybe I need like

a different car

final left

[Music]

oops actual design

yeah that

[Music]

that wasn't that smart idea

huh

[Music]

I'm here

I was wondering where you were

I think kitten would be late today

I hope it's not

too much I mean he's busy at work I mean

kids

[Music]

it is what it is

[Music]

[Music]

yes you can see this isn't going that

way

yeah that didn't make it bad

[Music]

and that's some math talks

foreign

[Music]

that wasn't any good

[Music]

yeah I should give up on this

apparently I didn't get any money from

doing that

that was weird you should get

okay I guess they have to but that's a

[ __ ]

yeah I use the clip command

and slash marking

uh

so I have something to check next time

should I

let the PNG is cute thank you

later taser is that how you want this is

to say is that

it's overlapping the chat a bit

um

I hope that's fine

and I'm serious I don't see

I got that way I should put everything

I don't have space I'm gonna have one

screen

let me do so quick adjustment for myself

yeah that's good that's good now let's

continue

why we did it that much that's weird it

is just for much less

than the word market

foreign accent

thank you

[Music]

okay yeah I've probably made a better

card than this guy

[Music]

yeah just speeding away

from my only chance is to like

yeah I need a new card yeah

[Music]

oh no

wrong way

13 daily

[Music]

I don't see anything

sky

[Music]

whoops

that card is appeared

oh well that's a shame

I had nothing to do with that car's

disappearance

that just happened

this park is spun away

[Music]

another trains today

I don't think the trains are allowed to

go that okay

dance and

of course charities

the mouse together

[Music]

it seems like a safety hazard

we have a train

but that's opponent is sharing still

not too far behind

I have to yeah I'm catching up another

spot

immunity

from this guy

[Music]

aren't so going to take a shortcut

through that sign

[Music]

that's your best lap yes

Scorch okay let's see this isn't the

high steak races it is the one where you

lose your car eight plus exactly what it

is

circuit move on to the next circuit I

did it to the other way and it's new how

does anything work and it doesn't make

sense me it told me that you should be

able to use it

okay how about I switch out to the lab

Lamborghini Diablo SV because that car

was definitely better than what I had

celebration

is like Swedish

maybe this car will perform better on

this track

for okay

I mean you spell it correctly just okay

strange that the four parts or I would

slashed in the watch

oh

that's a shame go

otherwise I guess I just need to make a

command before

apart

for each uses yeah this is certainly

much easier now

get out of the way I've tried to try

again

[Music]

well

trying a bit earlier than I expected

[Music]

what makes this and it would be more

interesting than I'm at the body

underneath this piece is that you have

damages

so you can't try

like Tracy

too crazy

we have to pay for not only will it hit

the damages and make your car perform

worse you have to pay the damage this

thing

[Music]

not like I tried to push it out of the

way it's it's disgusting away from me

thank you

so anyway

it's definitely much better than when I

was playing the Ferrari after this car

isn't pink it's a machine

and ruins my scene here

come to the Sea the curry colored

aside from the society mirror there

[Music]

he says I don't I haven't been peoples

to Mark tips and skin but so yeah

because oh it's uh why why are you

saying it didn't work it meant you

didn't have the permission to

good to know

[Music]

yeah I can imagine I made that mistake

too when I basically saying it didn't

work it's much better text I actually

say why it didn't like what what was the

error basically and that car sure can

handle corners

yeah it's faster which is what I'm more

interested in

final lap

with the

Ferrari I had before it couldn't really

keep up with these cars especially I was

able to beat the car though

I think that's right I'm in the highest

take space

I mean maybe it was easy for me to win

that race we passed out the car kind of

crashed for some reason

which I had nothing to do with it

[Music]

I actually didn't expect the car to fly

so the way I did

what

no no no no no

that was something else

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

see if I can catch up and last few

corners

that was a mistake

absolutely nothing to do with that car

driving off

I thought I was going to decide today

but

just enough to hit the wall

seriously hey

maybe I should have committed to

[Music]

everything went so well

and then

[Music]

I messed up

tell me

now I'm hitting everyone

[Music]

at least some damage but

[Music]

there we go

I'll take a third place

at least

it's not too bad

a place there

that's a that's at least a medal

[Music]

because what is Bush

I won all the cards from him so he had

to

pieter retire his career

oh no

I'm losing the money hey not this fees

so this is the same track I don't

remember

[Music]

the same track

now we just waited half a year before

you drive on It Go

but now wait rain

and actually assorted by color

that was not my fault

foreign

not that I'm interested in destructible

environment but I mean

yeah like if I try that fast into

October just to break the car but

it seems although it was

mechanics

I don't know how much force is required

to

50.

[Music]

that needs a shorter track

final lap

thank you

yeah probably have to sell them with a

certain place again

so I am catching up with one of them

that can be there is a bit broken

I didn't need to finish one but did he

hit that one so should I take like after

no I shouldn't have

yeah

yeah exactly did it turned that way

okay

[Music]

capacity

and

that

that wasn't what I wanted

yeah I kind of messed up this case

[Music]

you placed last

you place la la la la

but I'm streaking that's not funny I

want to hit them yeah now that beats

warm again this isn't good

not good

because of course Summit

why isn't the track of the summit the

none like yeah it's solid and then it's

Rocky pass is the non-snary version

and that is Atlantica and regular preach

they aren't variants I did not have to

but since they have the no the not snowy

version of this track

could make sense to put it right after

this one

these two

yeah I need to stop driving so terribly

at least there's no no weather on the

snow track since

tight on this roads here

[Music]

uh

yep

touch the meat and then the car keeps

sufficient

that happened

speaking of driving better

I didn't

get everything nice

like I didn't take any damage it's fine

[Music]

children

sorry I just

ah I'm scraping everything now

[Music]

they really needs slippery for some

reason

I mean I don't remember those being

slippery unless it's snowing

I mean it makes sense

but I I'll get this road like this is

Instagram okay if you put on like proper

tires

foreign

same bed of course

I don't drive these fast so

hey hey

make it easy

[Music]

black ice that must be it and also

another thing which if you enable the

weather the tunnels has a good grip but

if you disable weather

the tunnels have battery

[Music]

they basically made the whole track

including your thumbs

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I catch up with like one second so far

let's touch that one ah the same except

engine

now we need to damage spawning by like

one point

thank you

this car loves to everything I've had

done I didn't get it

I am confused

[Applause]

okay I should probably have

gonna be slower day

[Music]

[Music]

yep skin design

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

screams

I had candy

and give her to repair in this car

I'm going to have less money after the

race is over in the head before it

meeting our happy Tuesday hello Papa

I thought felt it a bit weird

let's see

I mean if your nickname is Papa that's

that's all right

but it's fun to see you here

um

what does the vtv stand for

interface Maybe

good to see you it's good to see you too

I see I haven't been able to

[Music]

catch a

pure skin

I do want to

try to

vary

explained so much

and of course

[Music]

and of course

[Music]

imagine TVs minus Russian team yep yep

there we go that's

it

[Music]

only mean of getting that

[Music]

that's the case

stuck

[Music]

do you have destroy your sleep scan yeah

that's the that's the problem

[Music]

if I do

have seen you on the Sunday and

groups things for the robotic Garden

when you stream with them

others

[Music]

yeah Sundays

it's the voice

it's basically dumb and then

it's random

Whoever has time

[Music]

so I usually show up on Dom's chat

with this

I'm not sure if I haven't really paid

attention because he's there every every

Sunday

now I'm done family

and then whoever is he's playing with Is

Random

but somehow even though I'm drawing

terribly I am in second place

[Music]

how does that work I don't think I don't

think he's path now

this is from driving down here

I can't fall down

okay but yeah I did that really well I

think

[Music]

thank you

there you go and let's start the car

should that be nice or should I do

something directly

[Music]

and also

I haven't actually updated to Jewel

Santi I have actually enabled the uh

the

whatever they call it

do not recommended for children flag on

the channel

so you are allowed to use apple flange I

just don't know how to basically mark it

on the screen I think that's something

which should do

most people don't Market on their stream

that they have this nothing enabled

anyway

30 30 okay

and I'll see if we can catch up with it

[Music]

yeah I mean that's basically what I have

to take directly from something in this

tournament because otherwise

that was the complete pain here that's

um

I gave it a shot but

[Music]

there's the bunny and as you can see

um

[Music]

[Music]

but yeah exactly I need to do something

with a Beat

gonna win this and don't worry I won't

do anything dirty

although I do have I have had an issue

team

that's somewhere interested in

it is more expensive than dressed

um

it's just a reason why I enabled a flag

my character flag a setting whatever

it's raining

except the previous track and there's no

tracks but it's not attracts are

slippery like it's raining anyway so

so it's basically how it's raining

except for the previous track okay let's

play dirty

it's depth feet

yeah I'm not

like that

there you go

I don't know I don't you're getting in

the way

I don't want to tackle anyone else I

want you to get ahead of that beat

but

for that to happen yeah

what kind of you

just have to stay ahead and not let you

let us touch it other no touching

no wait I'm trying the wrong way

that was close

I guess they're worried

that's expensive reading hmm do you like

it

[Music]

it cost 1 200. it is expensive at the

moment

it's more like

um

you start the trend

everyone's think dirty now

[Music]

I might be

okay that

just enough to touch that much

and not as long as that date is the last

position it's fine

now now to pass this car without

touching it

stacking it

I mean I guess I continue to script walk

at least that sign anyway it

looks like no

according to pulling to the left of

because

this

oh no deadbeat is climbing

oh good

that they've lost it final lap

unit boy must have done something

yeah see that fancy can drive through

now I just need to get in first position

keep forgetting that car is so slippery

so I'm preparing to drive forehead but

probably still reversing

okay

now

I was trying to

come on

the car doesn't even turn by the reverse

[Music]

yeah this

test it could tell it to me

[Music]

[Music]

now I just need to

somehow catch up again

[Music]

Is possessing your car it's not even a

whoosh car but like it was something I

was just scared

[Music]

but I won the card fan Square I mean

sure I pushed the car off the track

during the race but I mean it was my car

so it was fine

okay what's going to win

[Music]

[Music]

yeah

I was like in the lead that beat was in

last was that last

and then everything just I don't know

I don't know

I messed everything up

hundred thousand to repay

oh

they said they sir did I redeem

look at this

that's basically

that's not too spicy for it which is it

as far as I checked the rules hello

hello kitten you're coming in a perfect

moment as far as I'm read I'll leave

which roots

cute yeah

even when she's undressed she's cute

yeah so

yeah as far as I read it

on the twitch rules

everything that was required to be

covered is covered

[Music]

first I don't know if they mean that the

dogs baptized advertise enough yeah

as well as humans

but

admired person following the news just

in case

you want all of which Stars

had the son's house his wife left him an

area that they had to sell his car and

his wife I hope he got a lot of money

for his wife

now his wife left him

and to get the kids

do you think Bush would have a wife

and kids

okay let's continue this spicy long

nails

have you seen the Hot Pot drinks yeah

but they're in a hot tub in that place

it's okay as long as like near the water

or water

or on a beach

you can basically almost make it

[Music]

but I mean

I haven't have ever seen other avatars

some avatars are very and not on an

avatar some spinach too like not

connected to any form of water

have quite sometimes revealing outfits

but actually even even my avatar in

underwear is covered more than some

streamers

so yeah it's fair

[Music]

and that's why I Wish Is possessing your

car

now he went to the amateur big racing

bike

b-class cars

sorry I didn't mean to do that

[Music]

I love that that beat is dead last

weekend

[Music]

we have no career

I mean if I could beat him he had not

every game okay I'm just a little bunny

if he loses against the Army yeah

[Music]

and he had no chance of winning anything

I don't even know if he

while I can see my career stats it would

also be fun if I could watch I see on

the computers carry stats

I mean they are basically just random

names but but still if it for every race

I do it would also save our stats

let's see how one was just done

[Music]

you

person

welcome

this game looks very good for PS2 wait

did I brought PST

opening the first PS2 because this is

this is

um well this is the PC version of the p

uh not off the beat there is a piece of

one version of this game

this game does look what I remember the

PS1

okay so sorry about that so I

accidentally wrote PS2 in the title I

might have actually

and that's my mistake I meant to write

PC

and then this game didn't

it wasn't even released on his

I guess good that you point that out

like that it's not good for me I don't

even think this looks good for PS3 to be

honest

I mean

these are some big public polygons

painted both

[Music]

um

yes Legend of spiral and book box life

and I would say those games do look

better than these

this is high resolution however

and that's true

but not much details in the game

great lap you placed first

on your first first place with deadbeats

came forth okay let me take a quick look

at what I wrote

funny

[Music]

I don't know if you'd update the title

but

then at the same time

though I didn't win however I got that

same set I got the same points of

speaking questions

I have so far only getting first

position or third position in

tournaments I've never gotten a second

decision congratulations you have

successfully completed this tier you

have been awarded the bronze trophy

you're ready to challenge the next tier

so

um yeah and the worst and metal you get

and gives you the trophy of the tier as

they call it even though it's called

most of these are called tours then you

got these Pro caps and the memory lane

I don't know I don't know what's going

on

this game is weird some funny being said

I am a honestly uh kitten do you like

the outfit I don't remember asking yeah

I lost more money on batteries than I

want

but it was a necessary necessity to move

on

like Class B

I should sell one of these cars I mean I

like it being pink you know but

[Music]

but it's not upgraded

so no one

is it supposed to say one comma two

Foreigner doesn't look like it

this gave me something because it's

anyway

I'm going to cook breakfast now with

didn't be here

and let's start the next race and that

sounds good what would you make for

breakfast

[Music]

only forexes even easier

I didn't pay attention that

oh this is going fast

[Music]

you got a man Mac or is it Mac

and Mulligan

wait why are they so much faster than me

oh I need a new car

now I can win this

I can win this I don't need a new car

I need a new car

did I forget to repair the car before

the race

I am making chorizo with egg

and then I'm going to be making some

food PST

that sounds

like a good

breakfast

you should be making breakfast for me

because my breakfast is definitely red

there you know

I haven't had cereal in the morning

it's only bread

margarine

that's it

yeah I'm not doing some great in this

race

so I will live for fetish Grace

problem is if you don't oh she seem to

actually twice that sounds something if

you want to get your money you have to

do this

I made some Italian Dish

the name of which I can't remember

they have to wait for it you get control

and then he quit

and then press continue now committed to

its name I must complete it

I do like this track it looks like a

kangaroo

with a short head

and then quit

and then start last second

so it's very slow and start

and then it speeds away

just balance that out a bit more

and foreign

that's my first ever Force position

so anyway

I would need

a different b-class car in this case

this is only two cards

is that all let's have to buy small cars

okay

[Music]

in that case

let's now use a short pasta like like

Erica Tony with garlic a lot of chopped

parsley

and the tomatoes

or

papers

and too much sauce

tomatoes and tomato sauce

anyway

whichever I heard saying the word

when do you get

banana peels to drop on the other

drivers

I yeah

don't laugh

I think I should still go with the magic

say this which I do have one

that was what I wanted to change

so I guess that you just repair it and

just be good at the game

foreign

no it's not that explains it okay

plus requests 45

000.

I can sell it for 75 000.

or I do this because this is more fun

to pick this car

you purchase that

do not solve the previous one Let's

ignore that

as I sort out the one was fully upgraded

and then I upgraded

create upgrade upgrade

there we go now it's cool

and also I can do this

now it's even cooler

and then I take this boring red car

in solids to get some money back

foreign

[Music]

yeah

lost your coins

[Music]

and then he had to drive over your coins

to pick them up again

but I felt like green production

left banana

he saw a person

a cheering after you promote

who it was

[Music]

[Music]

now I can keep up

but they don't have any

like racing stripes on their cars today

because the racist stuff obviously makes

the car faster and that sounds great

they aren't even fully applications

for some reason I can't keep up with him

this one at the front here and this one

is

unless those other are the

the other

car and they just didn't add Racing

Stripes to them

for some reason even though um other

cars have happened

and then maybe maybe that blue car I

have but Jeffrey

a Lamborghini it was that one is in

Paradise in Star excited

[Music]

tb5

with me and hit some other stuff oh no

you create that chain reaction

now that person is going to

be trying to get in

look at this madman

[Music]

you like it when I play dirty so let me

play dirty

[Music]

I'm nothing I wasn't even doing anything

there I was just driving next side by

side

whoa whoa such speed

that much corn

got a man is back

[Music]

man man lost

just south

I don't know what happened to man man he

just he just gave up on him

[Music]

beep beep

sorry I'm missing comment that's right

or even it's just like Warhammer of

course what can somebody saying yeah

Orcs

now if you paint it with flames it will

go faster

yeah

I totally get that reference

I don't know anything about 400 but yes

obviously

if you paint flames on something it

feels faster

[Music]

and if you paint like bulls eyes or

whatever because

at Targets onto

airplanes and they will hit their

targets more accurately

[Music]

all right

mad man

in glucose

I didn't know he could write I don't

know what my man do because this is

apparently come to her because he's

losing

hmm

I am being nice

hey we are we are on beginners here

in different areas of course

more acceptability to win things into

existence by believing it that's

that's quite ability

[Music]

that seems like it

um

these Libya overpowered

[Music]

oh it's

one more left it's fine this lapse takes

like

a minute

45 seconds

there's not much left

that's your best honest thing keeping

that works from conquering everything is

okay look at that it's about these

corners

[Music]

they don't realize they have that

stability

exactly wow so they don't actually know

it

that's

okay in that case it wouldn't be our

power

and now they have been another reason

can be because they're stupid too I

don't know about the works but

low intelligence

can't really think of good ideas to will

into existence

if I remember correct me

uh painting something whoa

sign type

purple

makes it invisible

it means invisible that's that's why

classic invisible

does purple make it invisible

you like this because

more Hammer now

specifically for the Warhammer works

[Music]

yeah no that's

go in to go

[Music]

congratulations you placed first

perfect

seems bye

[Music]

yeah I think it's pretty dangerous yes

as soon as it crossed the Finish Line

you

press the break as hard as you can

yeah outfit has been active for 23

minutes I did that decide that outfits

went back to put 30 minutes go

I don't know if that's a good time or

not

my kicking style I'm back

and I hope you're cooking turned out

well

[Music]

and that it tastes good

it's well cooked

[Music]

oh yeah now you're doing it backwards

it's kind of like a different track

somewhat familiar

and somehow different

[Music]

and I'm driving through this side up

all right let's catch up with that part

again

[Music]

all right

[Music]

we'll catch up with you

slow down I mean so I can catch up here

[Music]

he came out great that's great to hear

Diamond Hill Design yeah

[Music]

another one

[Music]

I think close to another one

this karma is even

healing signs

you should do something about that

[Music]

someone scraping against the wall

I got a little bit of leaves after

that was some kids okay

[Music]

um lining back and forth

not mad man your car man

and it's so driver it must be called mad

man

I guess I have to catch up again

[Music]

star keeps a distance half moment

needs to do something about this car man

[Music]

[Music]

application

and he's good at this he's good that's

more ideas

[Music]

well I lost by the way

[Music]

why is he so fast at this section

so fast

let's pick heads up

please slow down

yep I almost forgot to play

look at me

I'm tired

I can see I just have to be more I guess

[Music]

come on Carmen

[Music]

final left

[Music]

finally I did something

look like we have pimp

and sure fell down quickly

[Music]

Harman is cheating yeah

possibly

well yeah Garmin gets surface in here

that's good

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

something happened

what could it have been

yeah now he's in last position

yeah I think he kinda

he lost control of the car accident

I clicked around

must it hidden like an oil spot or

something

I don't know what happened

you're wondering

oh look at this point 16 451 wow

the timer for the outfit is over

car stopped working

so I better repair the car for the next

two races

[Music]

hmm

they have some good points now three two

one go

well let's race continued

I think this is doing the track

backwards

that's the first track

I think yeah

[Music]

[Music]

okay we got another one there we go

let's continue

I'll find that one didn't you see the

new one I mean it's fine but

I'm not going to uh

when it is a good one so to be fine

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

I see

what a cute and spicy yeah I guess

both showing up her tummy

but one is like a proper outfit and the

other one is just underwear so

yeah she she's gonna get dressed like

that while she's doing these races

making sure she's she doesn't overheat

[Music]

okay Mark is going to get another second

position if this

keeps

I don't remember which order they came

in the first place

[Music]

I would assume

the madman came inside position both

times and then the first race

look Carmen came in second

then

the community came in forest

that said position gives you 20 points

and second and force together he's 41.

maybe it's not 45 points

yeah wait yes for a second plus four

skills for 1.6

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I needed that pretty early on and then

everyone has gift prepositions

all this time

foreign

Flags doesn't affect viewing numbers

that's good to know

that's your best lap It's the final left

dancing bear to the music

it fits

[Music]

[Music]

I can't

that's the background

what what

you get the damage and damage numbers

are the same

[Music]

[Music]

and when they signs fall over the sink

into the ground

[Music]

count

and reaching the final

end account you

place first

oh yeah it's 25 2016. one

so now basically have to get them

everyone's driving the same car

so my silly day

Mac has to come in the last position

stay in this third position a management

has to come first or second actually I

need to get them first go

this one

oh so they can't keep their damages

or at least

Mac no that person's managed

okay it's good so far yes

[Music]

okay not exactly what I wanted but I

can't catch up that's no problem I just

want to make it a bit more exciting

that's it that's it

and that's a cute card

thank you pottero

I know that's not going to pronounce it

but

I can't help nothing that way

I hope you like it if I say it that way

patara

or if you want me to call you something

else just let me know

I think it's

for toru or something

I see like pottero

it's like I'm reading it as a

well not English

car crash yeah you want to see the car

looks like this

the weight sitting outside the car I've

been driving sitting inside the car then

this whole game

I don't

play games well when I sit outside

hit time thank you

a pink car I thought it was fitting fun

fun

she likes to wear pink in the first

sports outfit is not pink

it's um

I could make it Pink I tried but I don't

know the

I don't think I need a better better

like if it's going to be pink it needs

some kind of designer pattern

[Music]

yep on the cards are in the correct

position

I just need to I just need to get in

first place I just put out and then I'll

see my whole car

that's

okay that's as moment

oh yeah attached too much of the grass

got Carly

lifted a bit and I lost all the momentum

trying to fix down that sign

yeah that was bad wait take that corner

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

but that doesn't matter

[Music]

I don't need to win this race to win the

tournament I just need to get

enough points

well

don't cry with that corner

[Music]

and then I need to take this

and you curve

what's called

[Music]

in our

better way than last time

like that

now

doesn't it was probably better but

still losing

distance

now the leading cars than 17 seconds

ahead still

haven't made any progress

oh it's like me

okay previously it was nice

but it was more like 17 and a half

seconds but it's at 17 I think now sir

in previous

[Music]

at least I'm in second position

of course

but even if I don't win

Halloween Department

which is the most important part

but it's not like in in Mario Kart where

you have actually have to win every race

otherwise you won't get the Triple Star

ornament rating

foreign

congratulations you have successfully

completed this circuit you have been

awarded the gold medal even my almost 2

million

it's nice when it comes up your money

now

number six tracks are going to be more

oh it's another one of these

three of that but this time

Class A

isn't this one the better car

what do I need to buy like

and this is capricated number three but

it doesn't have any strengths for some

reason

no I can't switch many here I need to go

back

you go here

[Music]

and not purchase another one of these

cards now it's going to see

exclamation

up speed

and name

and breaking

yeah I should probably buy a Chevrolet

Corvette Corvette Carvey and Corvette

instead of this one it seems to be

better and then I upgrade it

how about that

look it's pink I need a better pink

color now I wanted to change pink color

to be like

right is that

that's pretty much

like that

the salmon pink like

let's give it up instead

operate upgrade

[Music]

purchase that

and then I then only could go to my

camera garage garage

yeah in that case I can no let's keep

the cars

I have money

great upgrade

upgrade

now it gets some great racing stripes

I got a cleaner right now so I'll be

busy for a little bit that's

um

take the time you need

I don't remember how many laps this is

on this track but I'll leave it on this

track three times so you get your times

three two

one they're four tracks four laps

three times on this time

exactly and this is like

oh

wrong way

[Music]

um okay

that's what I was going to say the first

Racing Stripes room room yes

now the car is fast which is the racing

strats

now as we're gonna say the first

tournament had four tracks point

all right thanks yeah two tracks but too

fast two different so four tracks

and have four races this tournament has

six tracks and six races

but why isn't it unlock yet

and I guess the settlement is going to

be

ice tracks and eight racers

and it is the most

[Music]

and I would likely not finish this game

today

but there will be more racing next week

then I need to decide which game I

should do

study skin

and trying everything

[Music]

but and also

to do some explanation on these tracks

like stand still and look at some things

that's an interest

wow

and after they are very

like there was one tournament with

Empire City this is a track

and I'm not sure if this it has appeared

in any artificial tournament than that

single one

I would like to drive and extract a bit

more

or even if it was two tournaments

[Music]

that track is very fresh

and certainly more fun and Sunday stores

never reach for whatever

Country Roads to think about it

whoops sorry about that

I didn't try it just happened right left

yeah I should probably just stay on the

track I think that's a

the

e

it's man man that's why I haven't

been there you go

so now I sounded that Mac your enemies

Mac because it's written in uppercase

letters

in this drying I believe

everyone's face is enjoying white guys

and then there's a red blue and pink

obviously the pink is the best card

it doesn't think

we have to stay on the track this time

mostly on the track

someone's running off the road what I

collided with the car

sorry about that hope you didn't

pass you on the damages

stop acting

I'm just trying it

oops that's

cool well

of course let me just a little too fast

went off the track

ing a lot of friends at the moments

that's not this streaming service but

again

extremely extremely sending all the

French exists that's the game that

doesn't offend me down

so you see it's being a little bit uh

stuttery that's

okay that's yes the game

[Applause]

it was

a

one as long as I can beat Madman

and next race a better repair the car

oh

32000 wasn't too bad but the card third

was it damaged

[Music]

three

two one go

okay

[Music]

and let's deal with madman immediately

so that's downwards

so I don't have to bother about Madman

I think this track is backward this time

I'm better to determine if the truck is

mirrored or not

I took them a sign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

much easier

but at least I don't have to try to

overtake any cars

out of the race because I started quite

far ahead

and one man isn't lost he's quite far

behind

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

has something to be mad about now at

least

I managed to

make the signs fall over

I didn't hear anything hit the car

I had Birds

yeah

I think your birthday

[Music]

they are apparently loud and in this car

thank you

best left lap three

best lap lap three

is that

[Music]

yeah I would try to say three

it doesn't really sound like he's doing

it

three three

yeah people who can't say three

might say three three or three what

three that was hard to say

hello totally mad man will get over his

anger issues oh that's completely

stopped my car

[Music]

I guess that worked

foreign

needs to go back to the Australia

wastelands Mad Max

thankfully

including the explanation there

I was gonna say that the madman needs to

go back to

places that

because that place could be nasty many

different ways depending on where it is

you'll be

college or garlic on

Gallagher or acrylic

that would be the Swedish pronunciation

[Music]

or even chicken that's awesome

that I give five different versions

the place first well

I taste first

and now I have the most points instead

of that Madman

probably makes that madman mad

repair all that damage

and now third times third time on Sim

track is this like ninth or something

then

thank you

they pronounce it like the third one is

I don't know what is that one plus three

two one I like scan again

yeah I think that was the third one

no it is not night but it is raining

since I do have the first position in

the tournament

you have to really care about

who's doing everything about their

positions

raining weather

yeah at least it's not like raining

anything else

because it's weather raining

[Applause]

so far the car is undamaged

yeah and so

um

about that

oh come on

oh cut that a bit too

much

okay that was my fault

I mean everything is not so far but

I tried to like cut it then

can I have football

you don't really gain much from it to be

fair because

okay that was I lost control of the car

because of the secret ground

at this point I shouldn't have almost

four Faith to reach in place prescribes

me more damage

[Music]

yeah

okay I counted the time between the

message I wrote and the files on skin

days oh do you mean one minute and three

seconds to lay

but that must

that must be on your side because that's

a very long delay if it means it has one

minute

uh but I said you can always refresh

this dream

to fix the stimulation anyway it's the

racing bunny hello world yes I am racing

and I am racing badly it is raining and

I have trouble staying on this street

I'm running into trees some walls

okay I'm actually doing better now

who she's possessing your car again oh

no but it's a completely new car he has

nothing to do with this car and also

I've got the Filipinas everywhere

I don't know don't bother about that

but I gotta fix that

that's no problem

that's here now come on come on

no longer bothered about it

the girl stuff whoosh I completely

forgot that this game is that stream

maybe it doesn't have rain on the PS1

version

another round which brushes you played

now you play the PC version right

don't expectations

but it definitely that's right

it has night it has weather

hit us backwards and mirror wait does it

have us

I think it has those four options

huh is the Wolves again

I want to face out making noise

yeah PC yeah but I didn't say a lot okay

that maybe that explains it

if you play like

yeah if you played a lot I think you

said that you played like police chases

and in that case you might not never

have

change the settings for the track

no someone wants something spicy

what give me

a moment and

great you will get the spicy

and Asana clearly it's confirmed that

it's done

I know that

do you like it

twice yeah that's all you're here for

despise

oh no it pushed me

I had no other choice than me on that

sign

[Music]

what's that

it is too smart for me to see I can't

see it

green and stream is the the game window

covers it too much otherwise they

usually see how it appears in the chat

on screen

spicy pepper

yeah it's very spicy now

and the channel is turning more spicy

but don't worry I won't do anything

crazy

after all nudity is not allowed on

stream so

it's not new version of my avatar

version anyway

so no need to ask for that

just making that clear right away

yeah I'm gonna get a third position I

don't think surf is that bad because

it's a terrible I was driving that's

your best lap you place third

I'm going to hide in the 40s

and it's so cute

oh we have a split first place

[Music]

yeah I think the uh

her outfit is pretty cute and they with

the outfit

and about that I mean otherwise

no leave the pumpkin no

[Music]

when I wouldn't mind like fan art or

something

nothing like

sexual

[Music]

I mean like underwear is fine is that

one go

I guess I said nothing nothing sexual

because I'm sure I mean I can't

love people and they're just like a

perfect

Covenant I wouldn't like it

we need a racing outfit for for amazing

yeah I mean

I don't think it would be as cute as the

dress or the sportswear

or underwear otherwise pretty cute

I mean

it needs to be cute though so it fits

like Fountain scene

and by that I don't really like King

I mean like the general this like if you

ignore any

snap prints or patterns or color

and just look at the general shape of

the clothing that that is what I would

like

to be cute

or I guess spicy but it's like cute

spicy

a cute spice

okay dark math yeah

it does look like a duck

yeah

we talked about that I think

the kitten was away when we discussed

the

lift of the map

when I said it looks like a duck

I can still see a bit of it looking like

a rat

[Music]

it went too fast that

and now the car is on the side

yeah where's the astral Mouse

I mean it looks more like maybe it's a

bit more I was like okay

maybe astral can

say something about

a mouse like it is

which this makes me wonder if they when

they make these fantasy prints do this

do they work from a shape they want the

track to be and then build the track or

they used to build the track and feel

like yeah we should probably have a

corner here and then just end up with a

shape

maybe it's a bit of those and maybe it

varies depending on track

four car you must have good insurance I

don't have insurance I have to pay for

everything

[Music]

maybe that's the thing in other racing

games where you don't have to pay for

damages is the insurance covering

everything did your car lose the

driver's side more I don't know

why would that happen

[Music]

I'm pretty sure that's not the

possibility in the game

the mirrors can fall off

it's definitely mirror because that's

just

a picture

a second it would be interesting to fall

after

tips crashing technology crashing

[Music]

yeah I'm in last position

this is a stupid track but it does have

to be like this

the second

the two tries to pick

to be based on three times even

oh

I still have to concentrate more or

something

I also getting a lot of years now

with the spice enabled

the mirror is gone look at this

but who you signed view mirrors anyway

did you take them off from the car

Houston it reduced the weight of the car

keep forgetting about this corner

I'm messing up

so anyway when we have a bunch of people

here

I do want to plan out what's the next

racing game should be

like this

um

like I could play another one if it's

this game I guess

because they like [ __ ] Pursuits too or

something

and I like looking ask myself while I'm

driving I would even angle the measures

like that

plus I mean I I assume you don't race

with your cars

so

you don't need that for weight reduction

final left

[Music]

yeah I'm going to Forfeit this race

so did you like that parking uh because

I am not going to catch up I'm not even

going to get fifth position and I don't

want to damage the car even fetch

well it's not going really great and I'm

probably paying more on preparing the

card and I'm winning this race

okay what is this that is

I'm still in second position place

and so I need to do something about that

beat I hope that beat doesn't mind

getting dead

my car goes fast

foreign

[Applause]

I have yet to visit Poland

although I could check the paper what it

says

TV5

oh wait man bun is kind of behind it now

was it my Mothership yeah it was not

about that big I had to do something

about not mad

and then you catch up with that beat

and beat

that beat to death

I'm not sorry for that

[Music]

all right

okay

I'm coming foreign

obviously

I mean of other real life people I hope

because I shouldn't a lot of stuff and

computer please

connect

another player within that game enough

to play with themselves I mean

within reason now

anyway I'm just sitting in the car in my

underwear

and messing up

okay

sometimes

slightly obviously load and the car

lifts up I can no longer

losing the grip and kind of my accident

okay and now I got something inside

trying to catch up with this puppets

bye guys capable of going 155 miles per

hour which is 250 kilometers per hour

but um

sorry card I need to

[Music]

I need to catch up with that beat

assistant beat his dad

then when I'm beating

that's the same thing

I mean his name is

kind of obvious joke at this point

it was Boulders I mean if they might

have snow but they're still heavy

a smaller traffic run into them and

remove them from the track

I'm losing distance

my car can go 160 miles per hour which

is

250 seven coming per hour okay

yeah

I would have to check my papers if I'm

going to see how fast my car can go

but I don't think anyone's would be in

anyone would be interested in me going

through the papers on stream

oh

I'm still out

the whole mission for me this race was

to catch up a deadbeat

I'm behind but I still haven't parked up

same it's like 350.

what a shame

[Music]

and I assume you have tried to grab the

2050.

oh he collided with the building

and I collided with the wall

[Music]

not yet it's my stomach eye

and

and at least oh no

and it still needs some fixing

oh hopefully he will be able to test

that out

[Music]

okay

relax

[Music]

okay that beat

[Music]

you're dead

and I did it on the last lap

with many attempts

but I did it

and now I just need concentrating it to

the cone

I love that that bit catch up

this has been an exciting race

okay

[Music]

but I didn't get stressed but I should

be first in the tournament

me yeah

right yeah

some other drivers in first position now

well I didn't think I made

you but sure you can't say that

if you can see hey my question is

empty Highway in the middle of nowhere

no traffic at all

that sounds like illegal activity

uh it's still that it still has too much

points I still need to get I still need

to get that deadbeat I can't get the

first silverware

it needs a little big thing you know

because I'm at the foot you know it

you have to test it out on our country

are in a county that only had one

Sheriff

hola hello and type 31

smiley face

do you like the outfit

one go

I don't know if there's a lot of police

department

[Applause]

okay this man is mad

and we need to do something about this

moment

[Music]

[Applause]

there we go

straight into that

night

he's running to any towns or

too much taste

I don't even have the vehicles for over

six hours out there

[Music]

I guess the only person

[Music]

what's what is my man doing

perfectly pushed madman into a nightcon

track

gosh that's this man is mad

I think okay

that's in the middle of the race

I guess that's that's probably the

hydrate

at this moment I mean I can't hydrate

Justin from them

I have hydrated

see that what's happened when I had it

yeah maybe I need that hydrate

I think you know what else

it replies

too much things for me to eat plus his

replies anyway so I'm gonna

support they're not directed at me

anyway

yeah

woo

yes and if you catch up with that mad

man

no it doesn't matter

keep mixing them up

yeah basically started chasing at the

moment

[Music]

[Music]

okay

hello my man let me pass I don't want to

do anything here

I don't think sadly

thank you

but I didn't have catching up just

are you writing a book today

[Music]

good thing I made it so that

the text on the screen gets smaller in

the morning right

[Music]

lapse three are renting

I'm not catching up with them

it's my birthday

yeah it's like a logistic spot

biscuits

and no complaints for me

let's get the heaven and uh

kids coming and see what people can talk

to each other

as long as you add

the person you're applying to it's good

so it's clear

that it's directed some and not me

will it be ironic for me to have a

first cylinder what

do you mean a persona

well your name is anti-fury

[Music]

I I don't know

if your first son is some kind of

oh

and I got pushed off trashy if your

person is some kind of

um

inverted take on it I don't know

like the anti-matter version of a fairy

and if your name was an anti-matter

party

that'll be something

completely lost a great day

tornadoes be scary we had internet

decisional wow

that's not good I hope you're safe

and

yeah probably

[Music]

Anime anti-matter Fairy that sounds

interesting

yeah

doing so great at the moment

[Music]

like

[Music]

Jason yeah at some point

[Music]

and I might even lose the position

yeah it comes to touch this face

but at least if I get sad

I'll get a medal

and that's all I need

to progressed again

[Music]

I don't like tornadoes you have to say

[Music]

yeah I wouldn't like his Versa tornado

here but they are not late here so I

have actually no experience with that

all I know it sounds really scary

and

I am of course worried about

because of which possessing car again

I know

get rid of this wash

ER as well

I live in one of the tornado to tornado

alley thank you yes

oh I guess a lot of tornadoes

kind of thing and when it became

La B

one fish

what

hello flight

welcome

I am not doing that great in this race

at the moment

[Music]

and that's the third position

you have successfully completed this

this

nothing in between move on to the next

circuit

I don't know how it works but somehow I

managed

oh

yeah I knew it

so I would move all over to this car now

which I think is repaired no it's

slightly damaged

congratulations thank you myself

or probably a girl but I was doing

dessert apparently

but uh

better medalism and that's all I need

to progress the game

I'm doing good that sounds good

okay pumpkin

what language are you writing either

right now three two

one

sorry I forgot to change out it's been

30 minutes

[Music]

let's get to here

I'll be back yes

happiness

he also said when that you were going

away

[Music]

I wish I hadn't bummed

various times

I just random life I'm back now wow I

didn't even know you were away because

you didn't say

see that

that's that's a good one

let's change that one I'm like a

straight away

at some point

I was gonna say yeah this is a good

moment and then I got tackled

but I guess it's a good moment anyway

because I got back and I lost the speed

oh

the car turned really strong hey

thank you

sounds Spanish yeah

I don't know which one

you don't know which one

can I reply to someone

there's a car park there

I was strong

yeah we like statue when I watch she's

in this what she's racing he actually

found the car finally

or car getting hit that's kind of part

of racing

whooshes wishing

I can't see anything for us to smoke and

dust I think it's supposed to be dust

[Music]

It's the final left

oh it's under two lapse

I mean

there's the other two

trainers have four laps

most of them

sure is it two laps

even though we're driving

cars and therefore

the knives are shorter swimmings

foreign

backwards

why is the car saying friend that

turning while reversing how does that

work why is this steering wheel not

working with reversing doesn't make

sense to me

[Music]

some eggs

I am after now

experts so

what's that

he sent them

Emoji something

yeah I wish I saw this chat

like they're on screen chat

but there's no space for it so I can't

see it

I will be able to see it on Thursday

because on Thursday I'm going to stay

let me check

[Music]

um

that was weird let me let me look into

this

do you have a keyboard

I have a key plank

what

[Music]

are you asking if I'm playing the game

with a keyboard

I mean if you're asking if I have a

keyboard in general yes I do but that's

a weird question to ask

hydrating doesn't need to confirm this

so I assume you meant do I play with the

keyboard no I don't play with that

I have PlayStation 3 controllers

that's that's why I can make this smooth

turning

the pickle

or I don't want to leave

okay so it is backwards

oh it's weird

what

practice

cause me this this control has been out

okay thanks all right okay you're

welcome

foreign

not doing so great in this tournament

that wasn't the place I was supposed to

turn around was here

I got confused by the mirroring

[Music]

they just shouldn't have but

seriously not fine

[Music]

sorry about that

[Music]

oh wait

that wasn't the track

armor I'm sorry I I have a very hard

time understanding what you what you're

English

I'm really good bag okay

I should have a BRB command

[Music]

practices

[Music]

without that form

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

time to dance

[Music]

[Music]

I don't want to complain but I'd like

for it this

another random stuff at the moment

I don't know

against saying that

is

raining

Owen

[Music]

stay on a track

well if there was a bunny I would put it

each time

[Music]

[Music]

cast

no grass no crust

grass

just translate into the wall

why is the tunnel so slippery

smells like rain inside it home

I guess I mean there are probably

different versions I mean there are

different version of Monopoly so they

might be one with a plane

[Music]

what I did like about milk seeing that I

just went right now and stuff

anyway what I did like about Monopoly

back in the day was that they actually

did localized about it to different

regions

so like in a Swedish version they make

the a cash

and the Swedish crash kind of is not

Swedish country it was still Monopoly

money of course but

like the smallest build you had was 20.

instead of one because in the Swedish

currency the smartest bill is 20.

feeling for the banknotes

I think really something you think

banknote is that by the time I don't

know I'm not speak English

so

so yeah

[Music]

though the game set so by simply

multiplying all numbers in the game by

20

and changing stocking value to the value

times 20.

that makes the game

still I have exactly the same but the

money is actually

affecting the Swedish currency

which would be what quick people in

Sweden is used to

later versions of monotony I feel like

they have

stopped doing that that

because of course it is cheaper to just

make one set of money for all the whole

world

but you're listening out from the

familiarity of local currencies of like

Swedish people don't deal with

currencies where you have us one

it's your best left

banknotes

or something

yeah I'm not feeling so good in this

tournament I just can't keep up with

these guys the tunnel is moldy which

makes it slippery oh

okay right now is it outside six that's

hot

I can't read your name

sorry about that

should say that's that's like your first

message today

I'm a bit confused but

oh it's nice welcome

[Music]

it is hot

[Music]

didn't call me

wait

Ila

yeah I probably won't respect

rankion is a party say after seeing it a

few times now

that's it's fine

and bad with names I like better than

remembering names

so just using Jesus names is much easier

for me

of course it gets awkward in real life

because people don't walk around with

their names Mrs

oh I didn't see my contractment

yeah I didn't see what the jacket

this isn't going great

[Music]

yeah I wish I had like high beams like

those other cars

if I could see better

I mean I I've broken like

the slides on the right side

still

[Music]

for some reason

I'm still doing better

even if I feel like I'm getting worse

[Music]

food that was close

[Music]

to the one

[Music]

someone's birthday

thing again

if it arrives with that word which I

can't

[Music]

so that helped me

my Champion that's what it is

I I misread your word

uh champion

I assume like considering the spelling

is not really

in this

so I try to do something like

I chose to use my more the generic

language

[Music]

I mean I assume it's not like if an

English speak would try it and say

something like

Iran ion or something but I don't think

that starts supposed to be I don't know

idea what's going on

no it's fine

I usually don't have an idea what's

going on

backyard I'd say her name is oremian

that's probably not how you say it

[Music]

you might say it more like a remion or

something I don't know that was a kiss

[Music]

I don't know

or something

any car is upside down what a surprise

is always upside down

[Music]

in my

life without headlights because I broke

them because I couldn't stay on the

track because I couldn't see the track

because the headlines were bad

but now they are of course voice

can you get out of the way I'm trying to

drive here

well I'm telling him his car is terrible

I mean it's damaged by 28 but since

sometimes you feel like the Turning

doesn't do anything

in fact it's slippery but it's not

raining

now that's how I pronounce it white

yeah foreign

more experienced with other languages

and right

like

yeah I don't think I will win this

I could forfeit this always

I mean I

I mean a fourth position overall I could

maybe get a third I just need to stay

ahead of arasta

so that's my girl currently

I would try to stay ahead of rasta

oh

I lost candies is on the variant of this

track

and it's almost been three hours so I

guess they do these four races and three

two one go

and that will be good for this one

ah yeah

so yeah

[Music]

not a good start

[Music]

sorry about that guy

okay

pushed into the Rock right now

and if it's not me it's the other

Chinese

[Music]

yeah wish just drove into that stone or

she isn't doing that today

[Music]

all right depending on if this meaner

than that

let's like these tracks variant is

easier

this is not nice

[Music]

yeah I need to go for that

[Music]

oh gosh I'm running into the walls

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

yeah this is going bad

be like I am better at this track

[Music]

could have done that man I guess

that it's good

I want to play dirty now that's

maybe I should focus on getting

beat instead

getting up there please go

[Music]

there you go

let's pick our card quickly right now

it's not pick a pickle fan to the bottom

if you guys already recovered

foreign

[Music]

okay

yeah that was bad

now because climbing

[Music]

don't do that

and kitten is back nice to have you back

obviously

it's pronounced

question I don't know how you applying

the transition here I say Pico

or do you see are you saying it should

be Pico or something

[Music]

I think people sounds better anyway

if you were to ask me it would be like

big for meter so

what happened

okay I went to class 91 what is my game

is

I was trying to make

pants of the names

[Music]

unless he meant more like a Slavic

pronunciation I'm like pizza

or electrical anyway

welcome back welcome back

thanks

yes thanks again

yeah like the unit information but

you would say that the universement is

python

ahead of me anyway

I haven't actually like that house but I

mean

it would be Pico

in Swedish

so that's kind of what I got it from

that's uh the prefixes aren't like

English

so I wouldn't say any of the units would

have I in its like

I need to

what is it

yeah yeah like the prefix instead kylo

it's kilo so or

kilo

I guess it could be Pico

attack could be a possibility

[Music]

it's not like people can hey plastic

prefixes consistently anyway

[Music]

although I did say kilo more than kilo

so

much that just happened

okay so I guess

so I did actually say kilo

as a prefix and pick the pickle so I

don't know I don't know

I guess I'm not so consistent

yes yeah I think I got confused English

and Swedish

[Music]

it's like e in Swedish but in English

when I say things

[Music]

[Music]

okay

now what's that

fun funny sound cute oh thank you that

I don't know what you're trying what

you're talking about

you sound cute

you're talking about something that's

beyond my comprehension but it sounds

nice when you're talking about pizza

please continue

thank you

really

well

I'm about to flip the car

we can become a girl is

catching up again

annoying

but I want them to be far behind

yeah I can get a lot of points

and they get a few points

yeah it doesn't look like I'm going to

keep going on this but I really hope I

can get

bronze

at least

[Music]

that would be nice

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

ah a wolf I know it's more like

coyotes but

it's more like more fancy wolf

because there's someone called wolf

[Music]

I keep I keep reading rasta's pasta

and then it's this section

[Music]

Maybe

stay on this road

[Music]

no I don't know

[Music]

okay yes

okay that went really well

[Music]

uh

okay number one

his speaking Journey

but the rest stays better than pasta

is worse than pasta

Rasta is

very worse than pasta now you had what

is it

what is better than pasta first

mixing up the signs

um yes

how

far behind my currently

let's check the standings

oh I'm sorry that is good

I just have to do something about my you

and people

and there's like 40 points or something

and the biggest how much you get like 20

points for four percent uh

I think 30 points for it first position

Sierra for last

I really need to get them to last

position and I forgot to confirm that

there we go I know it's raining

but as long as I get to third position

happy the first one was a mistake yeah

okay I sure hope so

don't want you to come here and say that

Rasta is better than pasta

let's talk about them again

but in trusts yes

down

[Music]

I guess we'll take this path now

that would be great pass thank you

in that part

Rasta will never be better than pasta

and it's probably a night time it's not

so exactly enough rain

I don't know what that stuff means

stupid science

hello breast

[Music]

I'm not doing celebrating me that's so

much for sad things I guess

yeah

and killing everything on the way uh

tunnel

nice

nice dry tummy

[Music]

afterwards again

[Music]

a slightly dry patch there

can we try and get out of the way

[Music]

trying

to win

unlike you

guys you're still in the way

come on

getting him out by you

I didn't want to do that but

it just happened okay

it was so annoying

uh wait

I'm not selling the cartoon anymore I

guess that's typical

[Music]

typical my driving

[Music]

sorry I don't drive like this in real

life

mostly because I don't race in my life

[Music]

[Music]

don't give up I haven't given up yet

but I don't think I would get that good

standing

down

three killed signs

I might be responsible for but

they were in the way

Sean is ahead of me again

but I'm not doing that good ideas it

doesn't matter

[Music]

[Music]

he can still get a higher place and

money yeah

you want at least third position

but in that case I do have

knee to get better than this

rust is in the lead which is not good

[Music]

surely expect uh

it's like they're working together to

experience from

yeah this is didn't go that great

I'm doing really bad moving which is not

surprised because

it has a really bad attraction

that was my best left of my

okay let's see what do I have to do to

get in yeah I basically have to get rid

of rasta that's my only chance of

getting dessert

otherwise I don't get a metal heck crash

no this isn't correct this need to speed

I need to get rid of rasta Rasta

oh nice nice

three two one go

this is not right right

[Music]

let's see what I can do

[Music]

it's backwards

at least

I start off with crushing good good

that's seven and a half

no headlights

I'll pick up like one

smoke anyway

now it's a nice level yeah

[Music]

driving a car that gives over by of

nothing

so let's see that corner

[Music]

see you again

[Music]

you didn't see that

yeah

I kind of lost this

I'll give up this race I'm just going to

destroy the car more otherwise

you place fourth in the tournament then

with my chance of getting searched I

messed up

oh and

and I got barely anything from it

you guys haven't Tracy Jenny in first

position

like

I don't know I don't know how you want

to pronounce it

so that's that's been three hours and a

bit extra

I've had to redo that next time

uh I did my best

I need something assistance to stream

over or something one

I did make quite the progress in that

game but I do have to make more progress

of course

and

yep tomorrow is a break

it was good game

yeah the game is good I think

and the uh

man my driving was terrible but hey

that's

anyway

and it's my bedtime oh nice that's

a good moment

why isn't

that

I don't know what's going on

sorry I don't know what about it so

anyway so tomorrow is my break uh so

it's Friday morning if

I hope I can finish a spider and

uh Thursday Friday

there and then do uh

Saturday Sunday yeah in that case I

definitely should be able to complete

dog's life

I agree

and then

something soft and that's basically I

need to come up with a
