hello

a few seconds

I do want to time the the clock but

the timer

so I haven't I haven't brought up the

game

what's up that's not how you say it in

English

um

broad app

and this music I hope it's good

then what will you do tomorrow tomorrow

will be a surprise

because there is more stuff to the game

oh yeah

someone has to say I have one watching

let me just the position of this

yes

it needs two screens

oh well

I'll work with this so

the car is prepared I didn't remember if

I did that or not

and I guess it's

it's already paint

it

the controller here and the controller

should work

there'll be moments when it didn't work

so

well I just beginning

and begin again and hopefully the sound

should be in sync now I've noticed I

forgot to check that before but

nice guys same guys before

I sit and count down here

three two one

it's the countdown in Sinclair

stop oh yes it's similar I was

think I'm kind of a vampire

that white one

I used tattoos

because you're kind of avoiding silver

medals

starting off trains between long and

stitches that's a good start

been

[Music]

I said I think about the cinema before

I have also gotten a second place in

life knockout which where they didn't

have any emails I said so good

then every time I would have come in

seconds without it

a nice day

[Music]

wish

didn't

[Music]

work

but you know I never came in second

because hey that never happened

oh oh yeah

I can I can do that

wait why

didn't it show up here

[Music]

there is no updates refresh everything

uh hopefully next one shows

upon is driving in a dress that's

hardcore is is it hardcore to drive in a

dress

okay

be hydrate

back to the game version 4.5 is it what

announces the hearing would be a good

idea to do

well well technique okay

I got tackling into that one and

ah

completely forgot about Mickey who wrote

that welcoming Mickey

this is the yeah

I like to knock your face and they're

not gonna race is that much easier

because you don't have to get a lot of

points all you have to do is just make

sure that you don't come last in any of

this

which is much sincere so

for that reason I like it I also like it

because it's some variety

because there's only two types of rice

here

[Applause]

and having still having I mean

it's a racing game what to expect but

and I'm fine with

I mean it's basically when you play

Mario Kart it's just everything is the

same there's a track changes but um

but having a bit of different rules

regarding how you determine a winner is

nice

[Music]

okay

now broom broom

Anton in

sportswear that's chilling

when she's inside because I mean

I don't know what's different but

that's what you meant like

yeah actually some chili no

yeah because she has a sports bra and

now yeah now she's wearing a skirt

instead of a dress

I don't know how well you can see it is

a square

oh it's eight laps oh

take steps

[Music]

yeah we did not realize that today

someone left I imagine finally do like

one

race in this tournament and then go to a

different tournament

and through a whole different

experiments and didn't experience

[Music]

okay that was something

yeah yeah

probably the most racing game is it's

much harder to read comments than

anything depending on drawing

all the types of things

now I am getting behind on the comments

sorry about that Madman

he's never cheated

[Music]

yeah it's hardcore

recording

to me

to travel so fast in a dress

I mean if

you can't drive through the car because

yeah if it was like

oh that's your own fault

[Music]

uh

called theater even though it says see

you later with coffee too and

look nice

and

yeah if it was like

if the if the car was something closed

and she was or I really was sitting on

my dress because I am

and I could see I could see it not being

the wind might match the dress that

wouldn't be that funny

but

well yeah considering her sitting in an

enclosed box without anything inside

that's no nothing okay

is not a problem

[Music]

there we go

yeah I have a lot of comments to catch

up on now

I know

[Music]

I should take care of it on the straight

away here up across the working stuff

too it's great okay let's please

yeah

oh no this thing is blocking the

comments I can't see the prophecy

there we go

pumpkin is looking cute she's cute in

the sportswear that's why I wanted it

a a

if you've got a question you can always

ask me yet

I must learn in Swedish yeah we can have

a Swedish Swedish here

she's super smart and yes

we're also working on Arabic Japanese

version

I mean probably teaching me Swedish too

she's so smart

is very smart thank you

almost

I mean unless you're trying to write

Norwegians

um

when it comes to the verbs in Swedish

you have to think of uh how they work

when you give it as a command when you

tell someone to work you say arabiata so

you have the ah at the end and therefore

the present becomes

but

if you have a word like to run which

when you use that as a command you say

spring there's no vowel at the end

therefore the presence becomes Springer

so there's a system behind that and yeah

but yeah you have to the problem is that

I like the dictionary and teaching

materials doesn't focus on the which is

called imperative the command version

but that is that's what I like to see as

the root form of the verb

and

and that should really be the dictionary

form of the verb

and she helped me out because we must be

planning but I really appreciate it

yeah that's that's really

that's nice to hear that you appreciate

what I tried

yes you

I mean he's just passive mode he might

do something if it really requires it's

not really

I have a lot of

did I drop you enjoy you'll never work

at him

unfortunately I haven't gotten that far

to notice that pattern so I just thought

but usually it has a credit series

well I have mentioned it before but I I

mentioned a lot of videos I understand

that it's hard to keep track of

everything

and back to the game

so

because uh

there are in some languages it's not a

threatens think of the languages

because I know someone from Hungary and

I've mentioned

at some point that I should try to no I

wouldn't say like

learn fully but I've read up and like

grammar somewhere else because I had fun

Hungarian to be a a very logical and

interesting language

I don't fully appreciate the spelling

that I think they should have embraced

Islamic Convention of spelling

but

regardless of that in Hungarian

and they have a similar case like in

Swedish that

to determine how well

have verb it works you should look not

at its imperative form yeah

[Music]

foreign

because all verbs in Hungarian ends with

exact same ending and and it obscures

what kind of

one how the verb would work in all other

inflections due to that

so that's not the form they use in the

dictionary they have picked

a different form that makes it much

clearer and I think that's a very smart

thing to do

not that I

know

[Music]

perhaps fairly to inflect any of the

verbs but

it's

it's just one of the aspects of what my

what I find so smart about thank you

[Music]

and then

I mean English racism taking that long

so

fine

it's fine I'll see if you're right today

got cameras I can at least read them but

anyway

I read half the

something I have this sexist comments

today is a day off for me from my usual

job oh yeah yeah I think it's like

to have a Pentacles thing

[Music]

Memorial Day oh yeah

and because there's nothing

today is a slow day at work today

I'm your creative work

no matter what

[Music]

well

[Music]

if you get paid that's nice

and I meant if you get extra pain more

like

because one of the

other place I worked at you got like

50 percent

extra if you worked on Saturday or

Sunday and then you got 50 extra if you

worked over time

four day at that time you worked of

course

and I I assume you get 100 extra if you

work overtime on a Saturday or Sunday

and also didn't teach um the public

holidays as well

that is nice

anyways

well the game runs pretty smooth

pretty smooth not perfectly

and I'm basically destroyed to kind

yeah I definitely didn't have to do a

different tournament after this one

because I can't have multiple Point

tournaments active at the same time

it's the over Day overtime's Day right

this is a bedroom holiday

part of the kids

ah

we took when I took the job

yes which one yo anyway

and

that won't pay today that's that's

that's pretty neat

[Music]

and I can't of course not say from your

situation that the

you don't have anything better to do why

not work it's double the payment that's

pretty sweet

I don't even matter

that's that's a lot of money

you'll be rich

I wish I got that question are we doing

this thing

well yesterday

was quite an active day

yeah I will

stay still needs more ideas to fill out

really I should make this for the work

without running it in the browser so I

can get that calling scene working

and then

oh yeah I could

get start using the weekend because that

would be fun

just need some more uh I guess crazy

stuff I don't know

like the job is fun that's great

just a lot of stuff

I think my sister-in-law is cooking

something

what's the

correction I know I don't remember

when I've seen at the last lap and then

I

touch the wall and

leave into another one

accident that's

yeah

I mean I've been driving the car for

like 15 minutes now for how

well how long does that cheetah run

and now they can be pretty fast

but they don't run for a long time so

[Music]

when is the last lag it's not crash the

car too much

and then I just hit the one

okay let's see

I think I

like pieces me is that wanna

oh this car is so broken

when the texture is far away it

I got stuck again

it has the side of the mountain the

texture repeated a lot

but as you get closer

it starts again it's just this lip looks

weird

the draw distance isn't great in this

game

and then she comes City

there should be uh

infinite draw distance

but oh no but considering her terrible

this game can run

and even a Mother Computers

maybe that would be a bad idea

yeah the car is beautiful you know

it cost a fortune to repair

congratulations you placed first yes

smoke can be nothing nor to smoke

when I got in first place

ah the car is very broken

I can at least afford repairing it but

it's like all my money

now I only got 750 000 left

oh no wait I can't do other

or

tracks during this race

and I think I got building

ah so hard to control

[Music]

my regular Mouse is

I have these batteries

I think I can use this one a bit quieter

yeah I got girls and everything else so

well I guess I'll just have to continue

and just be more careful and not destroy

the car

my job is notifications team it's like

as long as you follow them

I'm actually required to know some

earrings this since we did business

every day I guess it makes sense but I

mean do you do the business there or

even if you don't do it it doesn't seem

like it

yeah one mistake and we have to go with

whatever

MP three two

broken card

and that's snowing

okay

because it's

not dispatch

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

first place

I think

how long will this strings take no

what are you doing

I was in the lead

[Music]

okay

[Music]

yeah this is very great

see them

right that small jump

okay I'm being very careful at the

moment

again

keep deleting

as long as I can

[Music]

that cars are so much faster

yeah this car is supposed to be fasting

I mean it's slightly broken but

50 I mean

it's so hard to avoid things

[Music]

[Music]

that's your best lap lap free

yep come outside

[Music]

another car ahead

doesn't take care of

that was outside

here we go

[Music]

oh too tight

now it's okay

when the car is

white

lots of protein

I am sitting behind the camera

and this tattoo

take a short break and read the comments

quickly

and also

if you're not allowed to enter the air

dog because I'm not a main surveyed I

can be taken first course if I do oh not

serious

personally no but I still had fun with

large events regarding packages going to

from the memory since

but I mean that's not on you

right

I mean unless you make the package or

something or you're you're in charge of

controlling packages I don't know I

don't know

I'm curious yeah certificates

we have we have no Lots about the final

test and on her three chances up eighty

percent of higher thousands eighty

percent is

it's both high and low at the same time

If he if we don't pass we no longer work

I mean

yeah in that case nothing

it is not two seconds ahead of you

technically that I'm doing that and I

took the lead

[Music]

she's amazing in this game yes she's

she's very good and a designer should

make it but thank you

what's that wonder that you had a grudge

against during that one knockout you

tried making him lose but with the wind

up getting yourself like that yeah who

was that I don't remember

[Music]

we don't talk about that driving

if Jeremy doesn't exist

actually that's very much

that's not I Rave at least

no

hatefulness

[Music]

is that even a name

now let's go back in shape if she knows

[Music]

being a thread for Speed and destroy the

car

let's try to keep the car as unbroken as

possible let's turn right I'm broken

it's not I mean it's been slippery

anyway so

it's snowing doesn't change much

okay so far

it goes well

[Music]

it on

that's barely anything

[Music]

lap five am I fine

now

more and more laps then

Happy Days

no I drove into the side

not getting away cheap with this

Enterprise

yeah drove Straight Like That

[Music]

I'll see in the afternoon

and I was doing so well

I'm inside the orange or something like

last time

all right look I did it

of course the other day is going fast

limited that's a different scene

I'm not sure

but it drives so fast on this section

ah

well so much for

keeping the car in fact

[Music]

I blend the slippery track and all the

jumps on the track too

okay

do you have the need

the car behind isn't

matching up much

this is my Fusion for secondly

like if I can see this

but this point I guess it doesn't matter

lap seven

map seven

let it comes again

putting it behind on us

in Cartagena yeah

there's a straight away now

how did I started with a t oh yeah

another word today that means I can't

take a shot of what favorite road

signing it oh nice

doesn't that sound fun for you yeah

how many knocks down so far

would be if Pom-Pom would actually eat

some food science

that sounds fun I wish I can drink but I

can't

I want to drink looks like I have to

finish the rest of my bone is finished

straight without leaving a single sign

well there's a sign

and this isn't since the track on which

whoosh builds his number

there will be more texts there will be

more signs so don't worry

they will be

uh

even though I'm drawing and not carrying

Mark these jumps anymore

see

karate

subscribers kind of catching up

Christopher is easy to avoid so I can

move it

he was like

one and a half laps left

almost done with the race

[Music]

and then

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

next

eight and a half second I hate to have

been summoned divided by seven

it's just

like you didn't just fast I mean

whoops that's another sign

I took no damage from that shop

probably so broken already

the house team is just going to be this

tournament

we have having fun chatting

they're very good girl in this

tournament because I'm not going to do

this tournament I can't

[Music]

so not much left of this step so this is

the idea that I was just repair the

engine steering and body but leaving

suspension broken

and then I just

don't have to care about the Champs

because the suspension will get broken

anyway and the cards are is fine with a

broken suspension anyway

that's the only idea I should probably

do

because I still can't keep because they

are not catching up

he plays first

so

[Music]

I will be back getting breakfast now

about two and a half minutes per left oh

sorry so we have two signs

yes tea

comments

oh it's about suspension I've got some

supposed to pack that one

this problem is having them in the wrong

order

ReSound the button

[Music]

one

I can still do like a

what is this

Street

like

yeah actually like

this and just

different

46 000.

[Music]

I'm gonna do a quick two left rings and

get some money

so I can repair the other car

let's say let's see a quick discuss

[Music]

three two

one

oh

let's see how many signs I don't make

[Music]

is not sleeping

it's not already broken I wasn't joking

before

[Music]

[Music]

let's see how much I get from these two

large Prince

[Music]

[Music]

they have like a Supercar or something

and I have just that

[Music]

looks like a very SD card

[Music]

don't shut the cards by the keys

[Music]

because this doesn't take too long to do

because I'm grinding

I don't drink any money I don't live in

the car but then I'll

the car and she gets quite a lot

[Music]

[Music]

again

slipper than your shirts it's very

convenient

congratulations you have won this move

on to the next circuit banana peels are

also very slippery what do they think

about

um

uh

um I mean like water could be quite

slippery

so it don't get any preparing it because

so 750 000 yeah

I get 750 000 every time I do like two

laps a lot

[Music]

that's cute that's a good amount of

money so the car is back back to the

tournament

that was that I was actually doing

yeah it can be sleep pretty but it's not

by wearing shoes unless it's some and

there's some juice of coins

I don't know I have not I usually don't

have been walking outside but I'm a bit

more like yeah can I kind of like water

on like

hard floor or something

it's good weather now I should be able

to do this without breaking the car

that's more work but mirrored okay

you can do that

some people are already crashing their

cars

okay

don't get tricked with that sign

[Music]

oh wow

that's a retreat trying to tackle me

I'm not gonna have done anything to you

I mean I have but since you know that

we're not done anything to you this race

and that's what's matter right

now let's go zero signs Pacific

Management science

their damage on the car

perfect

it's really a light voice like that

perfect lap

Neptune

it takes zero damage on your car

and you aren't seeing the league

and you started laughing baby finished

lap indeed you have zero damage

can't be more perfect than that

[Music]

um

him

it was two signs so

[Music]

and a bit of damage

so

oops

[Music]

I just lost the control of the cars just

a tiny

okay yeah that that one should have been

avoid phone

that's three signs

there's a lot of signs in this tractor

that was terrible

[Music]

whoops it sounds comparable because I

forgot to jump

but there's just one jump on this Dragon

it's a small jump

it's good

and the track is quite short as well I

think like that so it doesn't take ages

to do this tournaments

track AIDS attached

yeah there's the two signs

oh I'm gonna touch the

seven one

no I'm crashing the best time to me she

became [ __ ] tonight

which would explain why it's uh

difficult to try

[Music]

lap four

there we go

that's how I take that corner

no no no

I crushed tattoo

[Music]

that's supposed to sign that was down

but that shouldn't have been me I don't

remember knocking that one down

that looks like a sign knocked down too

but I don't think that was me either

sign I'm pretty sure

[Music]

it was it late

should we say signs I think

ah ah come on come on

even if it's like a game is for some

reason lagging and I don't know why

it never is stuttering

yeah I did not take that sign up

still standing

it still standing

lap five snap

it's more than one minute collab

[Music]

that's the one world if I'm straight

into their arms

[Music]

trying to be careful but

it is hard

it's listening

this track is kind of narrow as well so

it is hard to drive faster

I guess that's my two options a short

narrow track or a long ride track

well like this

lap six

that was close

arms running that house

that would be a terrible surprise for

them

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

right

[Music]

questions

[Music]

to last

night

yes so this is like half the night

around half laps left

I almost done with this rings

in a bit more than 10 minutes

of perfecting the race I've perfectly

slapping down Brian versus

much more left if you snap and then it

is

there's one more lap after this

let's just

[Music]

huh

It's the final lap

hello hello I am on the last lap of this

race

and then I'll get

can give you the attention you need

to give me a detention you deserve

[Music]

now we get it all right

very soon

so

it's not much left

I've been driving on this track for 12

minutes so definitely if you want to

finish it

down

and then I will read all your comments

what

crash that

is a welcome

[Music]

properly once in your house well that's

what as best as I can I'm

I'm still very near to this stuff

so I guess that's the

message before the problem with Tracy

game is because they quite a lot of

attention

and like the other games I do I do like

playing racing games okay let's see then

she has to go in his Finish Line and

let's finish the race

there we go

race so welcome

[Applause]

[Music]

let's go over to this rate that showed

the alerts is still broken still broken

hello

evil bread toaster

an evil threat Thursday

I was a bread toaster what what else do

you usually toast

it's a fun name

the streamer told me to tell you a lead

rate oh thank you

yes thank you for suggesting

that's very nice of you

I'm I've been streaming

soon in two months only so I'm very

inexperienced

with swimming

you are amazing Don pianist is amazing

and unfunny I love watching

she has Shane

and makes me happy

she's always so happy

oh thank you

it's conferences I'm glad you have

problem being related

this is a huge rate

my sister-in-law made to shrimp Alfredo

it was cute oh that's that's nice

and that's my shout out

I saw you in in Championship yeah I was

in the uh I was watching

some

something yeah they shouted didn't work

so let's oh yeah it kind of worked but

let's let's

do the other one

does that one work

perfect I wish they shouted Kitty both

but

when you're doing great thank you kitten

funny something I'll say I'm amazing I

don't believe it

yeah everyone else decided to come come

by and stick around you you are amazing

for wanting watch me

crash the cars

make sure that I'm asking very amazing

it is so nice

you're right she absolutely

yeah

yeah that's once

I don't remember how I

found Champion the first time

I usually find most streamers playing

Spyro so that's my usually but I'm so

bad at remembering stuff

and stuff

so that's most likely how

this is amazing

I think it's fine yeah it was most

likely so inspired

and

and that was fun too I didn't mean that

energy which

which spider it was and or if you

if you played through it all or you're

going to play more of it

um I'll watch your streams

well whatever game

but I do like watching People's place by

yourself

So I myself

and Pom-Pom rabbit

currently racing

which I currently do Monday Tuesdays and

then

two one go

I did play spider this one

I think that she does fire

it is an interesting series

and then I play some

other kind of game on Saturday Sunday

[Music]

and that's

basically my schedule

[Music]

and I I don't have a great streaming

setup at the moment I only have one

screen so

quite limited to what I can do

I hope to expand it in the future

[Music]

yeah it's very fun game

and I do want to play every spider game

because they

that's my goal

some sorts that would be interesting

one

did not know what you're writing

another thing was people here

yeah

currently doing this championship for

this eighth lap spray race

quite a lot

oh no

price damage

try to keep

I can't

I'm doing much better on this track

[Music]

another pretty strange

okay I write in English

yeah but you know most people here

understand English so it's

it's the best attempt at getting a

message across

welcome to fun fun the bonbons Channel

[Music]

you're you're a bit late

no it's fine

[Music]

yeah I

am still evolving the channel I do take

suggestions of course

great left left three

whoops

I went straight for that sign

I'm pretty

what games and apparently as well but

[Music]

I also I guess

yeah so

and you want me to say it in Swedish

okay that would be

Canon

[Music]

[Music]

you need to hydrate

I have finally at the moment

computer is taking care of them in this

track

for some reason

[Music]

would be

yeah it's

I guess it's not much different from the

English

[Music]

I'm playing with the controller so

accelerating with the right hand

hydrating means I can't accelerate

I have such a lead sense that problem

I'm gonna get really slowly down here

yeah

I'm not sure why why the computers are

so terrible on this track contract

and because I usually don't have this

much of a need I usually struggle

sometimes to keep the leaves

but now the

and also what what else find interesting

is how

together are the

um

cars are

this

is

I guess it's the first lap they haven't

spread out here

that red car there is

falling behind

lap five

[Music]

the only one of which I had no parents

knowledge was shadow

yeah

one

it's a very it is a very similar word so

it's easy to remember

come on

should I stand down more

Let's Dance

I mean coming from you this is how I

would have seen Spanish I mean maybe you

were writing French someday

I don't know how to pronounce French so

I wouldn't know how to eat

[Music]

but if you include phonetics

cutie IPA fanatics

[Music]

in that case I would be able to

since Master distance

[Music]

might of course be off and it really

depends on how accurate the

transcription is as well

as you can do it

carrying degrees of accuracy

but I don't exactly know how to

pronounce it

[Music]

pinball

it is a very powerful tool

and I do find it very useful to know how

to pronounce languages

which I do use

but a lot of people are afraid but she's

afraid is not the correct word but

find it overwhelming that's maybe a

better time

and but there's a lot of letters to

learn but if you do want to learn it

focus on a smaller number of letters

and like learn the letters of your own

language

that's a good start

[Music]

of course it is quite useful to to have

I still have no idea how to read IPA I

also don't think I pray I prepare five

different boxes

[Applause]

[Music]

[Music]

[Applause]

Papa

no that's not how it's pronounced but so

I basically made everything up

but writing

like a reference I can see the writing

at least

[Music]

it's quite French

[Music]

so

[Music]

[Music]

my fake French

oh it's fake french but for sure thank

you

you think my friend makes me sounds cute

[Music]

that's almost

if this race was 16 laps long which I

glad it's not and I should be able to

left one of the reasons

foreign

that's

that's nothing

yeah that's quite the lead with other

races

and if I get enough lead I don't

actually have to do like the remaining

ones and in fact

so if I give up on this race that means

that a ram rods we get at most

115 meaning that I do need to

do one more race

and then there is that Arabic which I

can't read that means I hungry

because I have learned style read Arabic

like this

and you already made me fall in love

that's in this language yes [ __ ] deep

into my heart you sound itself but no

would you like to share a banana with me

I mean I would take a banana I have no

problem with that you deserve a lot of

attention a lot of happiness in the way

you are feeling proud of yourself

you're so nice you're too nice

so there's two snow tracks it doesn't

really matter which which of these two I

do and the weather is on

the outside is

brightening

so if I give up on this phrase and then

we'll see how much or ramrod is that's

nah that seems like a stupid idea

because

because I'm pretty sure that

ramrod will get at least 5 Points in

that case I should not keep up on the

last one

unless I copy the save file and then

just gambled

now I'll do this race

and then I give up on the last one which

will be made in the first place

you want a banana tea

hidden

and I can really translate

landscape there are a few stars that are

not represented by Latin speaker

and that is about statement the Latin

script that's yeah you're making a Fast

equivalence

and you can say that there are sounds in

Arabic that the English language doesn't

have and therefore you can't write the

English orthography of Arabic

and you can also say

the Latin language as well but the Latin

script the letters themselves does not

have any sounds and therefore you can

Define and

sound for each letter and then writes in

Arabic using these sounds these letters

and therefore you have written Arabic

with access with exact sounds using

black nothing and there is actually one

one alphabet that has done exactly this

and it is called the IPA

of course it has made things so great

and then

and

a few Greek letters but I don't think

they use any of the three characters

wait yeah I think they might be using

that for me

Arabic

transcription the key is to replace it

with the left and left it is not from it

and there you go

so okay

thank you

very much

um

yeah

thank you everybody written out there

thank you I will have a penalty

there we go thank you that is

fine you're being cute kidney is very

cute okay getting all technical yeah I

love getting technical I mean if you're

going to make a false statement I'm

going to get technicality

now it's just that it's it's a thing

that I completely repeat that yeah you

can't write this with the Latin script

then you can't write that and now it's

it's completely wrong you can write

anything with the Latin script it is

just sound of the sound of sound written

left to right do you define the sound

per letter there's no restrictions

and I can't think of someone could

probably come up with something but sure

a certain script might do something more

efficiently

like the Korean script

has a more efficient way of marking

syllables I give that

but

later script it's just symbols

it doesn't imply anything

Spanish doesn't have any of those sounds

now I mean Spanish is a different

language not as polish policies in

different language

Swedish Egyptian language

I know that these Latin script

um

um a Maltese let me check that language

um

Kurdish no not Kurdish

and

I mean a Maltese

might be closer there might be some

I mean you can't you can just make apple

lanterns

no one is

very kindness

and cuteness that's very kind oh yeah

let's let's change the outfit look at

that

oh

cannot

thank you very much

Turkish might have patch if you want to

check to check out Maltese they might

have some of the sounds Turkish might

have some sense

there might be some language like south

of Spain maybe north of

Morocco that might be using the Latin

Scripts

back clothes sheets yeah and it's like

racing underwear

[Music]

but then I crashed anyway

so yeah

I can be a bit nerdy sometimes

basically it's not that all reminded at

that time actually did look at different

languages but was still blinded by the

different languages but most of the time

the argument points down to English

doesn't do it there for Latin script

company

and that's that's the most common

argument people have because

usually things with like this really

confident spell things like I'm

pronounced Latina it doesn't do that

that's a false statement

there's something you can you can hear

my channel some yeah

some random facts obviously you're free

to say state that if I say something

that isn't great

then

and also don't get mistaken that I

should answer

some something that I'm trying to say

that the Latin alphabet is the perfect

the best the script of all

and that's that's what I'm saying

or that every language should be written

it

that's not the dog I don't think

people sometimes have a tendency to make

up

things that other people haven't said

I've had that happen to me many times

[Music]

and

I mean it depends on a phrase it

well well

yeah

well

I'm going to help me now

[Music]

um

anyway

yeah another language is is kind of my

interest and I I enjoy different

languages and different scripts too as

well hey that is

she takes off her dressing like this is

my dressing it is my underwear but it is

my reason here

benefits on my dress before I leave the

car

okay

I see that's the

and as far as I know Latin itself

doesn't use the sun no yeah I think I

mentioned that to you like

no no I don't think I mentioned it I was

getting too bad

this Latin language

he heard that he's fat fundament thank

you one other sign yeah yeah I can't I

can't stop that's your best app I can't

stop thinking out these sides

but it's no one is still there

as long as I stay ahead of ramrod as

long as I get

homework

for more than more points more I think

it was ramrods

and

a kid for Faith next phrase instead win

the tournament

so I don't have to do like eight more

laps

[Music]

sorry about that

I'll take there which I'm going to call

you because I find your name stupid

[Music]

I'll see you later see you later

fast

like a cheetah

also ramrod is something that well

let me pass

what what

great so far

more like cluster

belonging I guess the mountain

yeah I cannot read it as cluster first

time son

collection

ah

sorry about that cheetah

I don't have anything against the yellow

cars trust me

[Music]

three laps done

[Music]

so

[Music]

this has

Scorch has been

quite the opponents

in previous

places

but this really shows I think

the difference by the dots I mean sure

I'm not the best at running at weather

but the weather doesn't really affect

the complete plate as much

there

the human please

[Music]

so

that's not

so there we go

um

point

changing off the force

black and that's half there is

no no there we go that was almost almost

tipped the car over there

she thought dropped and having sex

oh

that's a slow sheets that they are now I

mean they they ran for as long as they

could and then they get fired and I had

to rest

excuse me I'm trying to try again

and I'll see you later back

everyone is back

no don't keep the car over

there cap in the ground

I need to catch up and Scorch again

four teeth are getting passed by a bunny

yeah that's

a cheetah lives in Japanese that's

that's sad

but it's that [ __ ] I can't say it's

family

okay I accidentally captive signs

app

and a 50 cards

yeah of course

as a kid's reaction

uh wrong way

oh no ramrod is ahead of me that's no

good and this car is getting broken

that's not good

I need to catch up with that ramrod and

RAM that rot

and don't stunt

um don't associate rods with anything

else it's obviously a reference to a hot

rod

and

which is a federal car as far as I know

I mean you could find rods to be hot

that's

this is another Channel by the way

and I I know I'm very silly that's my

thing he has to see me thank you

foreign

you want to keep that

so

I just need to pass this cheetah who is

a real cheetah

cheating in the race

or when people don't get the long bounce

correctly and say hey

cheetah quickly

yeah I'm I'm doing quite terribly at the

moment

so it looks like I will have to deal

with the last race

okay let's see

I wonder if there's a voice key for lap

eight because he's doesn't finally

happened eight is the maximum

that doesn't stop they should be in your

voice

it is possible that seven is yes

no

I am catching up slowly

yeah

see you later see you later

don't joke

I got ramrods it's going to grab that

Rod a bit

as in car again

and

it doesn't mean anything else

[Music]

if any what are you saying in chat

I see a lot of texts

[Music]

um

at least that means I can

not stealing I can't do disaster that

means I can skip the message

okay let's finish this and then get back

to chat

and

[Music]

wow

I didn't really carefully

yeah how much I was sliding across the

street

road I was doing what I'm sleeping with

me I haven't really learned the

difference between streets and Roads

just wanted to pass it too if I may

sorry about that you can uh

got in my way again nothing against

yellow cars

this is too many of them and they get in

the rain

so I might not in this place especially

when I did that

it has depends in underways up but

I'll do that

that is not famous and when I get

to

yeah these were the first race I'm not

not yet my first place that's fine

I'll take a donut

congratulations he plays seconds that is

a good place

especially

if that's

enough

[Music]

yes that one is done that one is done

and more on the way

okay okay

did you know what the cheetah says to

their family when the bunny went over

them

no idea

any more science things outside oh oh I

didn't yeah I took out some I took out

some

mustard it too

damn I mean that must have been five

seconds

oh where are wish snowman probably on

the side of the road I didn't take them

out at least someone might have and not

me at least

yes silly that's that's the scene

and the cheetah said sadly I could not

cheat my way through this right race

yeah

this cheetah is trying to be a cheetah

Style

if you had to press for fate for fight

for fate

um and

it will cancel the whole tournament and

I get nothing which is a stupid system

but if I press continue

and then from this race

the air

until it starts

and then I press quit

main menu perfect raise and pressing yes

congratulations you have successfully

completed this circuit you have been

awarded the gold medal almost 40 million

Swedish accounts

keep Phantom

move on to the next circuit

s

I can actually repair this car

oh this tank looks like a very old

that's a crying

yeah this is bad and it's an account

so

I don't have to pay much more attention

than not just not coming last last

lies

this

is the Swedish word

oh knockouts

yeah guys are fun and it's not snowing

three

okay that's it I want to have to focus

on

getting ahead of like one card that

don't want to break the card

so

I'm gonna just stay here among the cars

not doing anything crazy

all right let's check back

[Music]

yeah yeah

sorry about that sorry

I didn't realize that

[Music]

yeah so much work not crashing

kicked

they

are just in there

everyone got stuck in the morning

and now it's just me and girl for girls

okay thanks for the motivation I don't

care for gold

[Music]

assistant

and dogs barking

what's that what's happening

[Music]

therefore

have a girl with girl for silver well

firstly is going to go for no mentals

and that position but how am I

asked the real side he only just can't

get lost it doesn't matter which

position you get for average as long as

he positions

let's go for girl you can still get

killed

I will do my attempt

Memphis

it's amazing this song about sounds

quite loud

I don't think this track has ever been

backwards in this tournaments

in this I mean in this home Canyon

he lost faith he's always lost

that's it's definitely but more again

will be out no problem and we'll

probably have to do a mall again

elements I have silver coins ooh fancy

do you have any gold coins

[Music]

I have a silver medal in this race and

this and the Melos looks like coins

does that count

I've got about that again

and I really should be more careful

about that

and that's the Collision corner

I have some good coins yeah oh nice

do you have some bronze

Sweden has some Nordic gold coins which

is like it's like a nickel

then

no that's not what part of English it is

some kind of nickel

something else copper nickel mix or

something I don't remember

so it's not action filmed

I am welcome later they say I see a kid

yeah she's she's cute when she's

undressed

yeah you know I must be connected

that's why I have so much skin

indeed you do they they crazy

[Music]

events yeah and copper you have a lot of

difference

methods

and steel coins

may I steal coins

cheap fun

I have a Swedish silver coin

[Music]

great left lap three

okay I should try to

not make a huge jump this time

since I got 25 things

okay there was a small jump

and

[Music]

right he's quite bad in his car is it is

it cooking

[Music]

the silver coin from Sweden they fix on

the up per

this stuff

and

566 Adams

when when

when I got that diamond coin

I don't but imagine

that would be something

[Music]

Diamond coin I wouldn't mind the diamond

coin

that would be pretty cool

I'm Diamond coin

okay

it's a broken sign

I I I I knocked down a sign

that's that should be the fun fun merch

that's it

diamond on coins very expensive right

I guess it has to be diamond-esque

[Music]

or something

[Music]

and it's be something but very very

expensive and having it's it's Diamond

heavy I mean it doesn't have to be a

hot coin

I don't actually know what the mass of

diamond is

[Music]

mess yeah I'm intensity but intensity of

diamonds but the mass of like

I was gonna say about it yeah what's the

what's what's the volume

of a one year coin or something like

that what what would that only 100

diamond one year coin be be invest heavy

mess but then I've never used hero I

mean Sweden Sweden doesn't use zero so

which some people believe

the only time I use zero is like um

what's theme and other platforms that

only takes zero

they don't think

local currencies here

at least I can pay in you

and

now

that's cute but I never touched any Euro

Ash

Nathan

that would be super nice to have it put

the

[Music]

But to answer a previous question yes I

do have some steel coins soon

I don't actually know how common steel

is in concert I don't know which what

materials coins you should I made of so

mixture

yes Diamond coin appears on

steam alert when you get a donation from

people Etc great idea that's something

it's actually something

you've won the race I found your coins

and cutting your coins so I've collected

a ton of them the one year according to

your coin but it's simulator

10.00

or the values for all

okay

and actually to be honest I haven't used

cash in a long time anyway

so

like diamond car with carrots in it yeah

in it

you don't be like

um embroidery that's not the first one

embossed not an embossed care then I I'm

not obvious not an action guy but like

you can see a cat inside it or something

is a bit

it's an idea

[Music]

and I do

oh

I have to set up a PayPal account I have

I hope to do it soon

yeah

you can't

hear can well that was not the time that

was a one

ignore what I just hit

my headlights

oh

white car

[Music]

anyway

um

track is so foggy

yeah everything came backwards is that

what they've done they've not done these

strike back obviously they can finally

do them backwards for this yeah

anyway what was I going to say

hey let's check what's going through

oh yeah that was possible to say yeah a

type of donation that can be done is to

basically

subscribe to in my patreon with any

amount you want and then

unsubscribe right after

let's shoot

and

because it's because patient should have

changed that

and so

now when you subscribe

and you pay on the day you subscribe and

then you pay on the same date every

month

don't ask me what to do this regarding

29th June 31st but

[Music]

that means that when you subscribe to

one from the bon bon of course

on patreon that should make the payment

immediately and then you unsubscribe

but then it should not shot you next

month obviously you're free to knock

them so scared I'm very happy for that

and

that's one way of doing SNL donation at

this moment

at least

I'm very careful this time it's so hard

to see on this track

I've never done it backwards and

outside is very confusing and the fog is

very strong so

and they really put the arrows like this

on this wall I have up ahead here

because I ran straight into the

dangerous tracking right

Australia

only step one

and jump straight into

this one yeah you really need some

Harrison or like put up some lights I

can see something because it's very dark

and

still usually seduced in coins because

it's just too quickly that makes sense

but the time only time they use stealing

cars in the units was when they made

more than one cent coin from steel

because they needed

instant or

World War II

a diamond coin measures in carrots

have carrots yeah there you go

um I mean are you just measure diamonds

in grams

I guess I would not surprise be

surprised if they do measure diamonds in

grams in

several places is

and it slowly looks different

yeah I should think of like

it is a nice idea too but if someone

I would yeah I guess if you do a

donation on stream Elements which I'm

using I don't know how that works

I'm probably broke the headlights now

yeah they weren't working anyway your

Twitch channel is so cute

well you are cool

and everyone else watching is me feeling

these things I'm actually not failing

I'm actually impressively

okay everyone sticking around are cool

beans but

I need something better

cool the powers

that's yeah you can set a custom

International yeah

yes himself

um

but which services does it work with I

would assume obviously if you donate

through stream Elements which is an

option but can it do can it trick you on

other donation services

or payment services or whatever like

um

patreon coffee

thank you

[Music]

and it's and some people have a hint and

if you if you're curious someone being

curious if it's coffee

but it is called fee because it is a

play on no fee which is the official

statement

and streamers is PayPal and nature is

different

so it won't pop up yeah yeah I mean I

was thinking if if it was like an API

it's something that could sound a tricky

is

an API for that

some way

can be set up

well in that case yes

like I could use a different like

someone else's PayPal in the meantime

and

that's the reasons because stamina is

transmitter to me that's my problem

and

the question is

if someone makes a donation on

a stream elements

can you see who the man went to

because

it wouldn't matter if it was to my pump

on account of course but if I'm going to

use someone else's in the meantime

and they

there's a decent argument for privacy

[Music]

drink

but I mean I'm not in any hurry

so

it doesn't need to decide if someone

likes a donation

how much of that should go towards

a real spin

but I that's a lot of things I'll get

hit

let's see

that's a lot of pigs

they're discussing strange things on

stream

[Music]

s

[Music]

what

nice okay because I'm basically standing

still at the moment uh coffee is I pay

partisan money into the bank or straight

I don't know about stripe but yeah I

mean if the person done anything goes

it's their own PayPal account they might

see who they sent they wanted to and

that's a foreign

that's perfectly fine

but if it actually shows which PayPal

account it goes to

that would be the

privacy concern if I have

is a person's choice to send their name

yeah

of course

you can see experiments yeah it's not

it's not their names I'm concerned about

this he he's the owner of the people's

account's name I'm concerned about in

this case

yeah but it's good that people can

donate anonymously

um

and it says if you want your name

displayed uh yeah yeah yeah that's true

[Music]

yeah I'm filthy

that's okay

but on coffee that's only

yeah

on the

uh

on the profile page again

maybe someone goes to see who made

donations on my final lap

on my coffee it will say and then it's

there but if I check

the PayPal account that the money goes

to

it would actually say who who actually

made the donation that part is not

elements

and that Anonymous figure this is

um trying to tell me

that feeling for your goal is actually

going

nothing and reset

very satisfied quick

that I can overuse it

[Music]

hello girlfriend

you are in first position

[Music]

now you're not

you're not cashing my own car

[Music]

can I so because and if

it's obviously not possible but since my

car is broken

since

before the next race since I'm the worst

position and get eight to get this fifth

position and I think the payout for the

fifth position repairing my car and then

race and then obviously then when I get

going because I obviously get killed her

hand that's something and

they would simply give me that minus the

fifth position which I've already not

think that that's obviously after this

game right

what

wouldn't that be nice

okay

concentration

crush crash

once again

and it's only four laps so this is

finally

that's a long track it's such a

confusing track

it's such a hard to see check

but anyway I'm getting too much going

now since

the girl wasn't there

placed first

that that wasn't you know Let's ignore

that

uh yes uh

Anonymous he's so cute

and on them

yeah I kind of mix it I think I miss it

a bit Swedish

that's the Swedish word

named if you want to do it anonymously

the person who makes the paper and makes

the paper account could use like one as

the full name

just make sure that no one knows who the

person is I mean I

yeah I mean you can also set up a a

business account on paper and which also

allows you to use uh your business name

and not your real name

is

now I drink more

going for having Donuts

going from from having intern as it

comes up in the bank account as a and

payment

s but instrument itself in between

okay so the person is paying stream

elements and stream elements is paying

me right kind of like that

business is no good to take

uh yeah I mean

yeah I really had it and also the

underwear time hits up since long ago

to put on clothes again

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

so it triggers immediately and

triggers immediately and I also want it

to be

having a Q and everything that would be

nice

[Music]

I'm trying very carefully because I

can't see much

[Music]

our tunnel with lights in but they

somehow don't light up the color I

understand why it is completely dark

[Music]

whoa whoa

what

what do you think you are

I mean you are a good girl but

[Music]

yeah

that doesn't mean

learn how to take the first part

[Music]

oh who Do You Think You Are

seeing me some cashion

there's nothing wrong

[Music]

oh

someone is driving in

off-road in here with the sports car

[Music]

I'm also almost off-roading with the

sports car

[Music]

oh that was Kiss

[Music]

is not backwards

I'm very confused about layout

[Music]

it was like four percent damage I mean

suspension

oops

and I still have my headlights

[Music]

well you know what I said

[Music]

and I I still got some lights and

luckily the

designs are reflective so they they

shine up very well with his really

little life I have

I think

it tracks near

course at night

so

yeah this this requires a lot of

concentration

it's not gonna be only

apps for

fancy lapse and I only got a midline of

the Sun

whatever

yes

thanks for putting the rock on the line

that's easy it wasn't designed when I

ordered them broken the lights on

[Music]

my car

[Music]

I just want to speak with you

[Music]

if you don't mind

[Music]

what there's some collisions going on by

me

some race was going slow on the track

[Music]

and then and then I heard a large crash

now it's not responsible for it trust me

I wasn't the one guys okay and uh

Knight's track ironically these kind of

tracks are the only ones I wouldn't

count destroyed signs because I wouldn't

see if I was eat or not anyway yeah

that's the problem back often back of

the line like this yes go back stay

there not cutting the line I'm first

you're welcome

it was a remaining paid for it but yes

one lap is by three minutes

yeah it is I'm

this is not a bad it's a long track at

night

hey someone's cutting line again

oh when I cut the cut out and

let's see what we can do about that

my best left

that means I'm not running that Duty

see

that was mankind

go back in line

I'm

a car he should be in front

everyone

and that goes for you too

Mr Sports

[Music]

oops sorry about that

[Music]

no I'm not sorry

[Music]

I didn't cry again

okay this time to give up a slight bit

of light it's not much

[Music]

okay and then there's this section

without the lines on the sides

almost

[Music]

come out and my suspension is quite

broken

[Music]

I accidentally drop off the shots

okay Tennessee

but somehow my single light is still

working

[Music]

I need cars just

[Music]

they

in your position when you belong

behind me

um

in my final night

[Music]

can it get out of my way

[Music]

trying to try again

[Music]

thank you

now I want to have this many weeks three

times to go on

and I drove into one of them

[Music]

yeah I can only hope for not not coming

in last I guess

[Music]

final left

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

now

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

yeah

I seen I can't see it

[Music]

[Music]

yep now this race is over

and that's a shame

you have been eliminated from The

Knockout competition

yeah that's that's going to be a really

difficult track to do it again

settings I put

I have

I have the screen set to Max brightness

I mean I can't try I can try again and

then like

check if there's some contrast setting

in the game

all right fix that yeah but I was start

over and because I of course it's a

market competition

I can't see if there's some yeah I mean

this kind of question I can't

do this

it didn't do anything go

maybe that's a fake FX Knight tracks

I mean obviously I wouldn't

make it bright day

thanks

I wouldn't make it brighter really it's

not a night right but

yeah this isn't an influencing for this

maybe that was a full spin

and that was a bit annoying

all right let's just keep it up

[Music]

someone important is trying to get

through here

very important training

okay I I

and I'll keep it quick

and I I was trying to be very careful

myself

but I guess I'll just have to focus on

upcoming last

that's that's my only thing I can do

a Barrel Roll I don't know what's that

kind of lip once

which is actually

[Music]

I mean

which explains why your Paradise are

always kind of how because they just

need all different languages

what are you talking about

I don't have any airlines I'm out on my

own

sorry for seconds

I have never played Starbucks

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

short

[Music]

hurry hurry hurry

and why is it

oh yeah it's seven races because it's

traps

if only there was two laps not four laps

there have been so much more coming in

oops

in that case I'm with them one mattress

you know four laps and it's a long track

team

more safety camera correction doesn't

see the night trains

and

otherwise I guess I'll help you

I think test myself in something dark

and hide myself inside

and it turns out on the uh

the Deep writing

really

that's your best laptop

well that was half the race not to five

minutes clips that was a sign

that there is stimulus snatched

[Music]

scratching the car against the wall at

that speed

[Applause]

plus another sign

when I was hoping to finish this today

but

I might still be able to finish this

today

now

start 121 it was quite long

I will try to win this one hopefully

there are no more night tracks

it's a great game Phantom

do I say thank you to that I mean I

didn't make the case

maybe I should say it's great so um I do

find the game great I mean aside from

the night strikes that's

otherwise is great

so yeah and I really don't like these

big jumps

well

[Music]

it should we make this game

final lap

speed nice real challenge

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

oh that's too quick

driving straight into the wall

[Music]

and it car is a bit broken but at least

it's

nothing Orange

you guys should see that

[Applause]

yes the

I only did three tracks in this

tournament

that took quite the line

and she didn't have to start out and

give me some coins congratulations you

placed first an unintended way you can

restart the race

and but

game is meant to do that

okay as I said every parent everything

except this suspension

and then I'll just continue continue

maybe it fixes does the camera

correction between this is

and everything is very bright now

I think yeah

one go

gives me

I don't know

[Music]

this driver just

asked me

what what

I didn't need to do that

okay

come on

[Music]

and this is awesome

dark track without it being nice

Giant

into a farm

ers

I can catch up there's no problem

someone turns into the water and then I

could see

oh someone turned into that one

oh that was

pretty early

making a nice color and then

[Music]

lap two

[Music]

[Music]

that's kind of disappeared

how strange

okay

uh how am I seeing that again

I send the second match so far

thanks so much outside

you could see this indestructible

feeling here

[Music]

thank you

oh my it's so yeah I know it's

not even a night track house this this

track must be very dark which is nice

I was printing paperwork and saw the

ticket back

yeah yeah

don't know why they made this dark so

dark

they should they should remake the game

fix the darkness on this track and also

it's the headlights sitting right there

and also fix it so you can use satellite

screen thing

because even if this track is dark you

should be able to use the headlights to

make it spicy and darkness

that's what you have a headlight for to

make it brighter when it starts

and previously

[Music]

best lap lap three

[Music]

I'll miss that 20. it gets me

because I broke his mouth

[Music]

[Music]

you are doing great because and I really

didn't aggression someone

you are I don't know

anyway easy well you have a QR

while you are in

and you are as a possessive why um you

are

racing on the boardwalks

enjoy at this point you are expecting

you are

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

is

cheese it's

there

I want to have weird

player

of those and why not make them into

separate pronouns

and skip the whole Apostle and then your

you oh you are Amaze both

in the meaning of you are and

and when you were sick

and then you don't have to care about

spelling no more

you can tell from text

and it would be and it would be kinda

like the uh

how the verbs change just depending on

pronouns in Spanish for example

in German

[Music]

it's the basically how it's used

but of course it's not the verb

[Music]

it's more like being modified instead of

developing once I could tell them

qualities

[Music]

because you are a certain you are the

Technic teamwork that you I mean today

is to work too and then but you work

together as one word because it become

one more

[Music]

and you can also find a lot of other

cases

there are otherwise that has merged so

much fun of different words

[Music]

so that's an excuse me

some questions

basically yeah

congratulations

play first yeah

anyway

let me see how I can do this nice check

to prepare everything get my headlights

back

because I have like

[Music]

I drink

the underway time is up even before I

started to dress

you are and you are also pronounced

different are they how I

you want a new way how are they

pronounce differently I think which

never disagrees with you they might be

uh

differences in certain dialects

dancing

[Music]

okay my voice might be

a bit muted

okay I'll do that twitch

so I should be able to see better now

but my voice might not be disappeared

has to be fair if it's nice I love it

but when it's lighted it's basically her

you shouldn't have the lights inside the

car on while we're driving so

it's basically what I'm simulating at

the moment

in first place I'm going to focus

okay come on

I think I'm

[Music]

done first hidden

TV series it's almost like the computers

become more beautiful

[Music]

that was the sign

s

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

seconds when

it is getting away

I mean

I'm not supposed to get first place

really long tournament that took like

half the Stream

really good swing thank you

no bunnies

so yeah I am

happy with that I feel like

so

to end these things off

and since

how about

oh yes that was fun

how about we take uh have some feed how

about we take a visit to a lot of you

that seems to be my traditional Mondays

going by London with you so okay in that

case I do have to play the game again

tomorrow

and I have an idea for what game it

should be on

Sunset isn't it

so we'll see about that

I'll copy this

the arrayed message

and yeah

so what racing tomorrow and then I will

draw on Wednesday continue the drawing

so I probably have to start kind of

early

or the drawing on Wednesday

so maybe I should start at the same time

the usual time for Saturday Sunday how

about that

then I'll finish it off whenever I get

completed if it doesn't take too long

so it's once they check this at the same

time I will post that on the survey

and

if you're not part of the server the the

schedule is there and you localize time

sandwiches

convenient I will add it to Twitch

schedule as well

so thank you all for watching and

staying around for so long
