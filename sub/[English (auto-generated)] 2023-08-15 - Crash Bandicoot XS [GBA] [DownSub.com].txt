hello

so it's like delay there on schedule

delay

but sometimes

so

um this is as far as I got so far the

first part I'm actually missing four

clear gems no it's morning right

yeah

so I will go all the way back to the

start

and then you have to wait for this whole

animation

yes I got this gem so this should be an

alternative pass as far as I know

example of Boom

don't really okay it's not going

straight into the game

you mean everyone so much to bring

something to me

there It Go

and again go back to the game so

somewhere

the air should be uh colored platform

and I think

it's located in

the um somewhere well surprise bird

oh I don't have any knives left what did

I waste on live sets

one morning

Beast

I think it was down here

oh yeah

and

down here

nice going Pumpkin you're amazing

your brain is amazed of how it works

why didn't I even do that

okay one more try

so down here

oh oh I know

okay so this is going to be a bit

trickier than I think

thank you

nice line

well

yeah they really made a YouTube

basically before

there we go

now

playing a checkpoint zero to zero boxes

thank you

I need to get through this whole area

well well to get the clear gem

well that means I got the checkpoint

when I get got here but

I need to stop messing up

I got to stop messing up

wait a minute two parts

these are Labyrinth

almost the other parts

wow wow

not doing great at the moment

one more try

there you go

oh oh that's something

oh

I really thought I could get a really

like three times why did I get masks now

the game is a bit inconsistent when you

get these marks

no almost feels like it does not have a

counter or how many times you have died

I did checkpoint and it just is just

some kind of estimate

away then

interesting jump there

one extra knife Muslim platform here yes

it was

not many many platforms

that's no problem

thank you

oh

no do you don't

reacted too late

and answer key thank you first

wait I mean

who's this place anyway

oh

so I have to go here to even get the ah

okay good thing I checked this place out

right in the air yeah

because when that's when you get the Gem

and according to the rules of this game

which is not the case with other crash

games

you have to bring the jam with you to

the to the end

you cannot die while having again you

can die

if you get a checkpoint after picking up

the gem then it says that you have gem

but if you die

if you die before you reach a checkpoint

you you have moved back to previous

checkpoint before

I guess this morning

foreign

checkpoint before you picked up the gem

and then you don't have the gem anymore

that was not the case in previous crash

games

as soon as you picked up a Jammy in the

craft game you kept it forever

and here's takes it

pick up these two

oh I pick up it's fine

wait a minute

did I have to finish oh man

thank you

oh

I have to go all the way to the end of

this and I got a checkpoint but I don't

have any nicely

if I die it's

I just start all over

can you believe that I actually thought

that it came over this game before

how to pick up the boxes now

I can get one extra knife

there you go

why not extra knife I'll take that

thank you very much

and there's sexy

[Music]

I think yeah no animations of you

returning to the warp room with the gems

but

when I got back to the workroom with the

gym

today yay

[Music]

foreign

button

into some dude gem as well

[Music]

Dancing Fox

just eating some

okay there's a blue gem you can

somewhere in this lemon

Ade

so in there

in the final bar pal so

let me check the

stats here and I can apparently not

switch page I got all the powers so I

got to the red green and yellow gem

as far as I know in the boss battle with

cortex there was a red green and yellow

gem

so I said that maybe I had to get all

three gems

in the game

before I could battle cortex however

there's apparently a blue gem as well

somewhere

yeah that's not how he tactos

I also only got the triple mask like

once in this case

it might be a short game but

it isn't brutally hard

there are shortcuts shipped in the past

it's apparently

nothing

on off on there

where can the

oh

can that be where it is

or can I reach it from this thing

back to five lives yay

thank you

yeah there we go

okay

oh there it is I got it

now we should pick up the checkpoint

what is the checkpoint

yeah it was performance

see now it's saved up you have to check

and otherwise again

I didn't even plan that that just worked

out

it just worked out

but don't really need it

well the bird moved

wow

almost fell off the platform

internet speed purposing I don't it's

not kind of purple gift card it had a

card in French Fusion

foreign

jumps that's kind of how you have to do

this game sometimes there we go I got

blue

[Music]

and that should hopefully be the last

comedian

now I want to sing

[Music]

and also this clear gem counter apparent

only counts screen again

I think it counted colored cams in the

original

I think that's in here

there's one here too

far

Little Gems

so this one should also have a jam

platform

foreign

or life I guess it wasn't more than one

[Music]

I know it's coming

it's mad about it

well look

okay don't you'd go

don't get much time no

to to see what comes off at the bottom

okay

no what I'm

this game

[Music]

there we are candy

no more often oh man

all right nice I got

mask I can waste

[Music]

okay okay so all right

[Music]

well this is not a big platform stand on

these are empty I still have 16.

huh

oh

the red is the special gem platform

this is the end of lemon what

where's the

not down there

okay not down there

that would be

nice

it looks like Chris is running away from

the mask

[Music]

you're sitting

okay

he's not part of the bonus because

that's not how they work

when

you find the champ platform so it's not

part of the seconds

and it's not posting okay

hello

big toilet not small wait how about this

I've seen you before but you haven't

written here before I couldn't switch

oh man I haven't played any game Mario

Advance crash games before how does it

feel compared to the main set

well

[Music]

then we stick the number of buttons does

sometimes get annoying

and I think crash was the best

on Game Boy since it's just this side

just like fresh hair has had side

scrolling parts

so it kind of works

it's not like

perfect

okay but this the thing I do prefer oh

there it is

there it is

okay I can't get this

because

you do transforming game is 2D sections

you can still move forwards and

backwards like towards them away from

the camera

which annoys me because

that can have all the results sometimes

and this game has nothing of that

[Music]

that's the thing I do like about this

game

I need to jump

how am I supposed to get up there

[Music]

because it's not like I have a

search um

[Music]

so what I don't like is that as soon as

you leave the platform

I knew that dude I suggestively the

platform you can no longer jump

I'm a dream is partner ah I need to

watch it now

working working early

morning way oh yeah dreamy

that's why I recognize your name from

foreign

yes

hope you have a good time good

good day at work and thank you so much

for stopping by

e

I'm trying to figure this out

okay so jumping on top of that is

nothing

there's a crack in the root look at that

now that's yesterday

[Music]

and then there's this

ah stupid ice physics

the sliding right into me

okay I don't know how you're going to

spin

there might be some kind of movement

[Music]

so I do have running but it's not going

to have me Peppa

on the bus foreign

[Music]

or so

no

no no idea maybe I can reach it from

I need to explore

maybe there's a different way I can get

up high

and then back

tracks

I want to see so many times just trying

to figure out how to get that day

[Music]

maybe I'm supposed to use the

penguin just that I'm so bad at

but yeah I like the head as soon as you

leave

the thing with the tornado spin

foreign

start floating

when you lose quite the height

before you can do the Second Spin

this is something I'm missing

[Music]

there's a possibility

yeah

yeah

the

way you can't jump as soon as you need

the platform is being strong here

because

probably fine if it wasn't for that

night to see it's a tiny thing that

really ruins it they're trying to

explain the new stream

and it's the uh

[Music]

okay there you go foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

you should press this button

oh wow

because I mean

it can't be like frame perfect that's

asking too much for our players they

would instead of giving you a certain

window you can do it

but

they only give you a window before

the point where you should press on it

not

often

depending on what it is

[Music]

well where's the ice physics I'm

bouncing on crates it should not be an

iceb16

is because on the left

probably because I

do it on ice when I jumped onto the

bouncing box so you check the ice visits

that's annoying

[Music]

but yeah

thank you

nice and dining

when I'm running to the side of the town

starting

[Music]

to be careful

no need to be asking for now

but oh yeah there is a secret mask that

too

oh

and then it should be these

um

Penguins here

these penguins

and I just

trying to hand myself

maybe not sister the head

well it gives you know what types

yeah the you're very very short

foreign

[Music]

and here should be the cone

not a gem

and then I got the rest except for this

level

there's something here I need

I haven't gotten a normal gem here

yay

I need to get all the crates this time

but yeah so basically

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

they

are just this

[Music]

if you try to

prime it for the on the visual cue queue

if you're just a single frame too late

you won't get anything you would think

explained

[Music]

it's just bad science what I'm trying to

say

wake up wake up wake up

[Music]

wake up wake up wake up wake up please

so

I think that should be all of them

[Music]

46 water I think it should be 4678

we need

let's pick up those

help me

what

that rest position

[Music]

um I'm not sure what point of that one

is

it's not like first gets tired

foreign

area

of course no what

is the way I dropped down this is

Kennedy

Graphics equivalent of the year

moving sideways

hmm

and get the impression that French

translates to Game Boy on his platform

better than inspired it this looks

challenging yeah I have had fun changes

aside from this these small annoyances

and some minor things

nothing but it does play when

and

like tweaking and I think this could

I guess it's a bit late now because

there's a point of

which would be the switch

I love my phones aren't really

restricted to 2D

another mobile phones are great for

gaming

yeah here we go

we are kind of

I need to do the

tornado spinning very

foreign

[Music]

just not stand up champ

um

that's always a thing crashing

which I said which are coming from like

let me just that wasn't doing that thing

well that's how low skin works so it's

okay

I mean

you don't have to do it because most

games do it

because spider and stuff like that

inspire you can touch enemies they can

only hurt you when they do attacks which

really should be right for okay not dog

jump yeah

don't do it I'm jumping for some reason

balance on the real reasoning

[ __ ]

interview

Ing and if

light

things being located in this game

yep oh wait I can't attack that

Game Boy the spider is kind of rough

deep first it's rough

the uh

the second is

error

I have done some tweaks they said they

can't go back

on a lot of improvements they did in a

second

but I still have several of improvements

you still pleasure

but

um yeah you can you kind of have to get

used to how spiral works

okay

foreign

I really don't get the point of

exclamation point boxes

I don't know how

some makes sense like should I do

something before I activate it

that's fair but

culture

some of them it's just yeah yeah you

need to activate these to even progress

to game

yeah but

do here

and I mean that happens

needy to find ways we have to wait

imagine

foreign

sometimes

the platform

missed the Box

I guess another issue with the game is

the whole uh this can't have an ice I

only am I supposed to drop down

I have more issues with game the field

of view is very small

okay I think it would do a bit bag

slightly more zoomed out

um

and also the whole angle View

kind of makes it hard to see like you

can stand here

which doesn't make sense that's the last

pixel you can stand on

and then you can like

fan here

and so you kind of have to look at the

bottom of the platform and stuff to

determine

when we can stand

and it can get away to me sometimes

so the TNT wouldn't explore that soon

um

I saw you didn't go all the way

no

lunches sandwich more

[Music]

um

yeah being restricting you can barely

see wants to jump where some space in

front of me

yeah I mean it kind of kind of

at least it's not in center of screen

that's a that's not been an issue with a

lot of 2D platformer I've had

like the characters in the center of the

screen very annoying on older

yeah

especially on all the planets all the

consoles with very low resolution

at least

at least a high resolution but games

were developed for ntsc and we didn't

even use pulse High resolutions even

though oh it could be higher field of

view like a bit more than that

and they didn't even use it

anyway

um

the plus the cat was in the middle of

skin plus a screen plus it was four by

three

Plus at least on the NES or something it

couldn't even properly beat

like the way the render engine worked

to have a scrolling View

one column of the words of Sprites and

it couldn't be used

I'm making the view even smaller

yeah 3D Platformers were really bad back

in the day

I mean the platformer games themselves

were like

the other can't speak of but the more

the more technical technical stuff

behind it

with the

oh it's a high resolution plus white

screen nowadays that's much more suited

for Platformers

don't you can eat the dark underneath

but I'm taking safely

okay

well I almost made a mistake of running

wrong

sound

one almost on boxes

yeah I do like it in many boxes here

can't you see I'm jumping here

not much space going between

outside from Anthony

climbing section star just about to say

ah

got it clearly a jam and the final box

at the same time whoa why you can't deny

the wrong

that's kind of really sunny

there we go on if she's four or five

hundred she's fine I just need to get

back

he worked

they had this jumps a bit

well no way

I cannot press buttons well I got it

though

is another special purpose scene at this

point

[Music]

20 clear gems

I didn't even know there's no

character so I just need to find in here

[Music]

color the platform this one this one

one

one day I'm going to look for it

I have some ads today because she will

play in like a minute

[Music]

now I don't know if you have abs or not

because some have terrible

sometimes I don't know

whether I'm planning everything 10

minutes

for the first time and they are just

prefer the monitor for me

[Music]

if you were

[Music]

yeah it definitely ice picks is ice

physics on that box so that's another

issue with this game

I played the

and The Originals with Mario Bros

sometimes the ads will turn to play on

mobile I'm still watching again yeah I'm

I mean okay I don't get that because I

have to remember which I was killing

foreign

and yeah sometimes I guess they just

don't have ads to show so

no ads then and that's nice for you

yeah I'm not going to find this platform

before I

die I die and put answering randomly

so

yeah that's it I went back and played

original smart Bros

let's attack exactly I say I've learned

from touching and the uh when Mario is a

really slippery

it controls

so it does not feel good public ads

crashed as soon as I release the button

he stops

as soon as I press the button he runs at

full speed this is what I prefer I mean

this is for Speed but

but yeah for instance

there is no acceleration there is no

breaking because

sure you must have a slight amount of

accelerating and breaking

but I feel like

if you want that like a

do they call the tight platformer

having accelerations

and stuff

I don't think oh

hey I don't think it's like

I don't feel everything is kids playing

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

and and then and then yeah

rocket man I'm trying to read comments

and playing at the same times let me

read a comments and yeah the purpose

sounds nice I've been seeing him again

it I like that it's the play pay streams

exactly

uh for anyone you know enough to wear it

if you're going if you're getting an ad

as a turbo user

you don't get the ad but

the streamer still gets the money for as

if the app had played for that for you

[Music]

and yes that I think I got it in

it's part of affiliate

I don't know I just have it

and in Turbo no checkpoint my checkpoint

the turbo also allows you to use a

custom username color which simply that

you have to pay for it

I guess I mean like

bye

if I get it for free it should be okay

the rocket man is here I'm looking for a

colored platform at the moment

I don't have much luck for anyone

foreign

but

going to level and see if I can find

something obvious otherwise I have to go

through knowing carefully

and and they call it Platformers are not

out of the bonus

and it's the end of 11 and there's

nothing behind it okay I guess I I get

it back a little one

than that

[Music]

I'm doing all right it's my day off so I

get to enjoy this beautiful stream today

oh kitten I'm also taking the Titan

National driver day off yeah you have

been

you are

doing

such a good job

[Music]

I am proud of all your successes

all right

[Music]

since you bounce off maybe I'm confusing

with something else yeah it was the fish

in Cars 3 which also does the spin thing

if you spin them past their spinning you

bounce off each other

maybe maybe that wasn't a scene with

pains

can be hidden like here

but there is no way to look at that one

it's coming down here

looks kind of like this should be down

here

but it isn't it's a nice surprise

I guess it'll be more obvious but I

don't know

I might do this thing tomorrow

I'm happy that he choose this being this

thing kitten and of course everyone else

oh

yeah this game has the same issue with

it has

and when it comes to ice fixes physics

in platforming game I can see something

down here I guess not

um or something down here maybe not

like there's a balances in here

[Music]

and then and then there's the M here

now

no no nothing nothing at least that's

covering

I want to be who's not essentially like

this yeah he likes trash right

must be a lot area

in that case

did you just spun

I'm messing up I can't pick up

these fruits because I'm

but

what what I shouldn't take damages but

land on an enemy that's kind of the

whole point of decaying where you can

land on him please

I find the street very relaxing and cute

especially when I get to know it might

be stupid communities

[Music]

ice physics in platform games is often

it's messed up

in the original trash platforming games

my device is physics

if you had a momentum and moved into

something that stopped you for some

reason it didn't clear your momentum

because I'm not clicking

so if you jumped you were starting to

speed away again

which of course makes no sense

let's see where you were Stood Still

foreign

and in this game if you stand on ice and

jump off it and land on a box that box

has ice physics

or like as long as you're in the yeah

the Box itself doesn't have ice species

but and more like you still have the

eyes

physics behavior of your jumps as your

continuing to balance on boxes until you

land on solar panel

and that's kind of annoying

[Music]

I know my checkpoint

I wrapped it

okay something came

[Music]

okay is it here

[Music]

no but the camera's crossed down

there's some things that

something obvious please

thank you

I didn't mean to fall off it okay

[Music]

thanks

that's more Nike

maybe I'm supposed to land on top of

that

and hit it like that but

yeah I didn't jump properly on the

foreign

[Music]

like here

[Music]

but I don't have an extra large

experiment with me

I got one chance

I guess I'll just look down here nothing

I have no idea what it is

my sandwich

[Music]

it's like I've been there

kind of looking everywhere

you got this yeah I'll try I'm not

getting here

we're nothing up there

uh

nothing off screen that would be easy

very cruel we're going to pick up some

extra

fruit is here

it's extra nice

[Music]

there's one thing I haven't tested in

this

[Music]

uh how to activate that but

you need on that this thing

and some extra knives

that is this jumping section

wow wow

you need to get them too close

all right now I'm the rounding and I

skip this clip again

[Music]

none of that around the extra knife

I tried to jump

I don't like how I can't land on these

[Music]

I'm wasting all my extra lives here

all right

yeah we can't have struggling getting

this in here

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

okay so that's not an option

but different don't activate it

[Music]

foreign

but still

I mean that might be how the game works

if you just

didn't squished a sniping area

ah now

I stood on it

sometimes you feel like they spin very

often and sometimes not so often

there we go

but why I shouldn't kill

Ed

foreign

what

yes did the spinning thing come on it

can be cheating now

I don't know if it is last uh clear gem

or so but

I am struggling

I just can't find

right is this something obvious like why

does it do that and why do I forward it

every time

why is it spinning so often

that's it cheating

[Music]

it's such a smart plan for me

nice don't expect

that doesn't help me anything

John

yeah I have no idea where I'm supposed

to go

[Music]

okay what's happening yeah good to know

I didn't miss the ending okay the dream

ending I actually know if it's training

anything nothing seems hso a

and yeah history

what if I exploded and go back

I mean some crash games aren't as cruel

nope

I'm no idea

I have no idea what I'm supposed to do

I'm out already yes I'm open

for suggestions

obviously don't go and look like I'm

supposed to do it that wouldn't be a

suggestion at this point

we can try to figure this out together

I was in the air

[Music]

I didn't get up on it

platform I play yeah I'm a platform fan

I'm the most platformed player ever wait

but

[Music]

I don't remember this level so I'm gonna

be useless for him yeah

okay let me just

all right

uh all right I can't find a platform

because there is no platform I'm stupid

I'm just stupid I'm looking for

something that doesn't exceed

um you're supposed to pick up all the

boxes why I managed to fail at this last

time I don't know

let me just pick up all the boxes

I thought they got down the boxes on my

tablet

[Music]

and yeah oh anyway straight straight

right in the start so you can't die by

just pressing one button or opposite

and yes it's called no job

that sounds suggesting

it does it

what makes you say that

and yeah you're

like

oh yeah yeah of course he can go back

and forth like forever until I arrived

and then it's going to spin

yeah there's something real can I put

these penguins

being Venus

and another here and I said suggestive

definitely not suited for my stream I

never say anything suggested on this

stream

y

thank you

at least they're kind enough to put

mines

right in front of the first one of those

so you know that oh now it's the section

of these things

suggestion nope never said anything

suggesting

on stream ever

a family friendly space

amp 18 plus adults only family friendly

space don't touch the painting but

yeah

everything about touching Penguins but I

touched babies but took damage

[Music]

there we go I know I got that checkpoint

oh jumped over the boxes

all right

[Music]

I landed on top of it that's not how

that's not how it works again

and it died on tape Transformers to

suggest and

well I did then that wasn't like what

sorry okay I can say I can see where you

came to that conclusion or like

um but that wasn't like what we were

talking about

We're stopped I will be back I can't

keep them ask it uh yeah I I was at

first I said

yeah I don't know are you making a joke

because if we want to check because I

give me a joke

like 69 boxes

[Music]

okay okay I know what's up now give me

some boxes back there

but then what

is the text

I don't see why I'm missing the boxes

it's going to Bear section

numbers

you can't miss I got 69 but you can't

miss boxes because

the better it takes the one since that's

one

they still increase the campaign so

[Music]

touching heat should not hurt you

thank you

and there we go but yeah again again

attached the top of it I die

ah it says

[Music]

nothing any parents tested this game

thank you

yeah

it's the s b n o u

I don't even need to count any tension

[Music]

green boxes

[Music]

there's piano you here

it's an information

yeah because it's not really unreachable

we know

motorbox there it is

[Music]

got unboxings in the bonus I mean the

Pinoy

but now

it's for now

I got all the boxes now why couldn't I

do that last time

that was weird

that was very weird of me but I am a

weird person now this one should have

I call it platform or the iPad no wait

foreign

boxes anyway

how do I know there is no nothing yet

that name okay

sometimes they do that

as always I am wrong in my hypothesis

and

it's just a perfectly since so

okay

I'm not Tech I'm pretty fun

all right

[Applause]

see they are give me some little boxes

in the previous level and I was thinking

you needed to do anything

that's that's what the big green box

which is normal size within the

explanation point

on it is much for you

[Music]

today

[Music]

but it is no rabbit on it

coming extra nice

leading me

nine into it

there we go

I got a bamboo some

[Music]

hey they can't have the same I guess

they can because they're so quick

and I've been already already been there

[Music]

is it only a gym

wait a minute

can't be a gem

that must be the other place

because this this level on has two clear

gems it doesn't have the red gem this is

the similar to the place they actually

had

so I have to go here here must be a

platform

and this area must therefore have

I don't like him you can't slide and

jump in this game

but

there we go great

foreign

plate form

whoa whoa whoa whoa

what's going on now

I'm getting another Mustang but

I died no I don't have a mask

okay all right now I got the masking you

why it's gonna slow down

what are you running from you are just

going to sleep because it's fun right

I'm not a triple mask in this mode

too far

I'll try to make a slight correction but

I

then fixing a jam I got a bunch of extra

boxes

coming into the box stand but I guess I

am

get up here yeah

she needs a bouncy box

I'm too cool for those

how far back do I need to go here yes

because here no study back

anyways

where's my burger

I need my bazooka

I need to backtrack further

[Music]

all right now I'm back yes

that's the checkpoint

[Music]

oh we got the yeah

yeah

crunch do seem like the sort of person

who nor

no not where and what breaks are and

doesn't have more sides to use them

seems to be in the name oh yeah yeah

he's definitely the one who would crash

he's kind of Reckless also also

I realize this

couldn't you just go back this way and

get to that yellow platform

oh

really really it had to do that to me

he's trying to Reckless

yeah he doesn't have any right wait he's

Red Bull he has a without with all the

crashes he's full of wrecked everywhere

but this must just checked my desk

he he is Wrecking

okay Reckless means that you have a

little care concern

someone's being erectful it would be

someone who does have

like

yeah you know the opposite of Reckless

you are full of rich

there's a red folded pinkness

and I'm reckless because I'm a reckful

here we go this to be at least n b u o s

n b u o s

[Music]

now I'm going to get that extra knife

because I am not Reckless

I'm reckful

and breakfast seems like President stops

and has foresight to know what will

happen I guess that's true

fresh still doesn't have any porn sites

the owner has backside

he knows what has happened

he probably doesn't have any backside

either

I work for is a word meaning to be

cautious yeah

yeah kinda

[Music]

similar to how when you're Invincible

you plant thick damage and stuff

air

but Invincible is a thing it's just not

used normally in English

[Music]

[Music]

six more boxes five four three two

dude

wait one zero

it was it was a long two

[Music]

two

and more shifts two and three fifths two

and two fifths

synonym is careful plowing in flower

both means the same thing

what does implant come from

them

don't believe me

I like

and I said you also got the word

Infamous which is pronounced infamous

and for some reason

like a person who isn't famous

two Jets even

same

override

I'm not 23.

I got this one this one down the hill

isn't Infamous more like famous for bad

stuff Infamous is a person who's an

opportunity that's

no it's Infamous it's a person who isn't

famous

but I could see uh inflammable and

Infamous to have Canada in from the same

way

[Music]

or something

two jokes down those things I never did

yeah yeah I made a joke

but I and plus

wow wow that's it I don't think like

sure the way I've traced everything I

actually didn't really mean it as a joke

it was like and I

I can't imagine that's joking as well

but I but hey but but the way I actually

pronounce that's infamous

I think

I said I thought that I made a thing

what have I got

in the famous

like the word important

well I guess I didn't need those but you

got the knee tracks but the pants in the

microphone

goodbye boxes wait

am I going for both gems no wait I'm

just going for

I'm going for a single gem

it was somebody that I didn't get on

this level

for some reason

well it's crazy that's dangerous sir

goodbye boxes hello foxy oh foxes

I can give you some foxes

I can't spell apparently we got this one

this one

this one

this one

even the [ __ ] spouse emotes oh okay

wow yeah

bounce bounce bounce

[Music]

some crazy person gave me a subscription

I know strange boxes over there okay

right here what's this weird place here

Fox bounce I should have a bounce

give me seven more subscriptions and not

but to my stream balance

no

and I guess another animated slot and

then I'll animate a bouncy pump one or

something

I mean I have no problem replacing the

Rainbow on the phone because it's just a

default because this is the Deep on hand

Y and that one

I think that one could be replaced with

a more funny one

it is I I guess it's kind of funny but

hence more fun

nice face so

all right I can't do this

it's fun to use when you're drunk and

everything plans to connect it

it's gonna say why not that drink

pumpkin that's no I can't have it

one for Navy drinks

sounds like everything angry fun fun

never gets angry

I was gonna say is it is definitely over

already I'm missing a lot of boxes let's

just be honest all right I mean the the

the

s-n-u-o-b

[Music]

what is a hero b s n u r b constantly

never doesn't mean yep

dehydrates

and also Rocket Man said the hydration

[Music]

start drinking yeah I have no intention

of starting to drink

[Music]

oh yeah oh yeah yeah I see I remember

one two three

[Music]

and I can't take that let's make that

or

now it's okay

and another I think

[Music]

sporting

[Music]

boom

spotty fun fun because he's doing all

these jumping around requires a lot of

it's very

exercising that's the turn right

exercisable

does she needs to wear something more

oh

I see that's the one I missed there you

go

hiding in the vegetation

hiding in the vegetables

them

can someone else see that one in Spotify

with bare tummy

can I get something like

so I got all the gems

another thing because the people are

here now when I fell forward a cortex

last time

and there was the three gems the red

green and yellow I think but there's

apparently a blue one that I found this

one so I'm gonna put this off the belly

yeah yeah there's like the idea of

having a redeemed for prepping

confidence for me and she's wearing this

first one or other outfits that would

kill her damage if if I were to

actually make more more of it I have to

redrop on point because that's not I

didn't draw that from drawing so should

I fight cortex again after at the same

already

or something

because now I got

I don't know

I guess I should okay game isn't gonna

explain what I should do after I get on

the gym

yeah it's it's a red green and yellow

where's the blue one

oh

I was waiting

yeah there's no place

poor blue Channel

huh

yeah I don't really know how this works

what takes a tries to attack crash

crash tricks cortex into shooting the

gems

and then

your cortex shooting packing goes crazy

I'm very sure

and after all gems have been shot cortex

your sleeves

and this is the same question

it's easy exact same

[Music]

it's the same is it

gem or what am I supposed to do how do I

I'll press up here doesn't give me

something with a pink with a heart on it

oh oh wait I know what you're talking

about

uh oh yeah right I actually needed

relics too because I forgot about that

well but what's the level of The Relic

do I need should I just go for girls

because I don't

did it

well we'll see how well this goes

let's go

bonus is gone

no don't do that crash

come on Owen

Aaron that's going to use it and also

yeah

what's that

[Music]

honey do I need gold that's the question

let me just check

Ed when I could just go for gold

virtually shake your tradition but

uh

encounters oh and

so I need to be a slightly cooking

slightly more efficient there's no

problem I can do that

I say as I'm not

foreign

I need some way to get to the guild

quickly

I find that I don't mess up as much this

then he goes yeah hopefully it's not as

annoying as the autograph came hi this

is

yeah okay so I should just slide on

everything then

then jump

and get that oh nice

and nothing stuck here

I got stuck there

now the jump It's really stupid

Bandicoot

how do you get stuck behind a crate

here I have one job to crack ah

okay

someone got that subscription and how

nice of you

what do you mean

I hope I hope I hope what the real girl

likes that one

now she too can you speak funny email

let's try it

there we go it wasn't too hard

that wasn't too hard

[Music]

to provide me nice and too far away

[Music]

screaming well I guess swimming should

be I don't know

because he's uh spinning okay

not if I did that

because maybe not

[Music]

dude whoa

oh my God around that

downtown

[Music]

and

inhale

excuse me sharks

this is in the shark attack level why

are there so many sharks

obviously there's something that have to

be shark scene and shark attack

oh I missed it

[Music]

and here should be the end of the devil

I already correct me yes into the Mario

bike yeah that was under a minute

that was a terrible run all right I got

the highest best time

[Music]

I'll take it

[Music]

[Music]

where should I go here now I shouldn't

go here

jump crash jump that's the only thing I

asked for you

[Music]

no am I supposed to do that

game you Crash Bandicoot

stop

that's just enough to not be able to do

that

that's my that's my

relax oh

I landed on it

yes yes

who's the company swear my poor ears

wait what did I say

listen damn it it was a quote from

cortex

I don't know that's why I was on this

key

[Music]

and I think time is like

she's one of the Lesser swears

there we go

why was that so hard

it's a whole it's a whole um

as soon as you leave the platform you

can no longer jump

that thing is really annoying me

oh he's picked the wrong box

this is worth one second

now

I just got to take a few attempts

right I mean people are watching

speedrunners so I don't care anything

fine but this is kind of speed running

instead of spinning the whole game I'm

just be trying them normally speed on

his arm I mean they are oh this is most

of time

being honest dude has like this runs too

practicing the same thing over and over

again

it's just

kind of nasty deep on that one yes it's

just

a deep unnamed platform and he no longer

wants to jump

it's the thing I mentioned before you

you get the visual clue

and as soon

and as soon as

um

email

visually it's over

it's too late

you have this whole

window before maybe shortly

as soon as

it it's over

uh it's too late and

first of my third

um

at least twitching much better telling

me they have changed their own system

but I said it tempts me much better that

there's a plane

but of course it doesn't tell me if

anyone in there isn't watching it

because I don't know who

well of course if you are a subscriber I

know that you don't have ads

I press that like button

[Music]

and I think I think some there are

terrible everything games that are act

like that and I feel like a proper

Parappa photographer is one of those

terrible trading games

uh but I'm not sure why didn't I just

jump yeah

um

so they give you this whole window

before that you can play the notes and

then you got the visual and the finance

case because it's the uh music game

audio queue as well

and as soon as on the frame that you

should play it or rather just the frame

after you should have played it it's too

late

and it's considered you that you missed

no I mean on the frame after

this means that two

play the music properly unlike with the

game properly like music properly you

have to play every note lightly ahead of

time because you should aim for the

middle of the uh window you're allowed

to play with him

I guess that gives you biggest odds of

successfully hitting the nuts you have

to play with four

okay

okay

so yeah

another another type of game that also

feels like it's like that it's a written

Heaven I see describes

I actually don't know what's called

reason fever Rhythm

Paradise they have a lot of different

veins

it could just be that the timing Windows

is so short

so it's actually nothing like what I'm

talking about but when I did try playing

it it really felt like as soon as she

gets the visual cue it's too late you

have to press it before

did you get the mission King

which I thought they ruined the whole

game

and I remember to spin across that

or when you get it yeah whenever that

maybe yeah just get him during this time

and it's a bit trickier and then I saw

it

and it's it's the uh

do you think that has killed me the most

in this game for this relics runs now is

that you can't jump as soon as you leave

the platform the whole it's the whole

thing I'm talking about what I'm doing

Instagram because it's the whole feature

I don't want to call it a feature hey

it's not about it's a feature it's a

terrible thing in the game

that ruins the engine of them again

as soon as I leave the platform and I

can't jump I have to jump

all right

before the platform

and of course you can argue when

it makes sense that you can't jump as

soon as you make the platform and

but there's a difference between having

it make sense and having any game that

is enjoying the culture you also have to

take into considering like the delay

uh screen delay I actually I actually

don't know what the screen delay of this

computer is

so

and it might be a frame or two or more

behind

so that in that case I have to

press the jump button even before I get

the

it addressed at the end of the platform

can I get up anyway

um

and there's nothing to jump on there

now I just have to jump up like that

okay

[Music]

but yeah

game design with Pom-Pom

is do you want your game to be good

some things out

now

let's wait for the platform

thank you

and then we're spinning

no no I press the jump button has

already left the platform I

ah foreign

and you make it so you can no longer

jump as soon as you leave the platform

yeah I'm not going inside

because like sure I can't get behind

like uh the idea but yeah but if you can

jump after you leave the platform that

could result in you being able to like

can I extend the platform I'm making a

longer jump than was planned and that's

true

but compensate that by if you can jump

like because it doesn't require much

just

just slightly after learning the

platform

and also it would be nice if the tablet

jump to work

it might that's also I think I have not

had any problem with any of these games

but that's going to be one thing I'm

going to be talking about when playing

first one

every time the double jump doesn't work

because

in Crash foreign

except that sometimes to jump just

doesn't execute

but it should not be any restriction to

the dump jump but I don't get it

in this game you can't double jump when

you're falling down

it must be done before you start falling

down ah slipped up again oh another

subscription

um

I'm not making platforms while in that

case I mean I can

I can't yes

family multiplaying platform is nicely

so that's kind of what's on my brain at

the moment

but like I mostly for like quality of

life

foreign

codes of the keyboard there we go that's

the time

uh gold

and because every keyboard doesn't like

you can't delete the literal letters for

example if you if you want wasd or

navigation you can't read the literal

letters wsd because as soon as someone

plays with a non-quarter keyboard

elect

for example like it's warak or a Russian

keyboard Maybe

I can't attack that one and your

keyboard at your game is no longer going

to work

with the scanning code which is more

technical behind the keyboard is the uh

Canada codes for the physical I was

trying to speak like for the fiscal

locations of the keys

regardless of what keyword it is

for example a German keyboard which is

the quite amazing

and quartz keyboard where y and z are

have switched positions and this

scanning code

for scan codes are the same regardless

so

this is going to be fun

[Music]

thank you

enjoy

I hope you can enjoy these

I know a lot of technical stuff when it

comes to technology

[Music]

no take those uh

Mr punch it's a shiny to mine

I'm gonna miss those again

don't want to do this level again

there's some mines here

I don't know

now I'm losing everything

it might be that the double jump system

starts with the jump and not when you're

in the air so it's possessing it

unintended what do you mean like

sometimes when I make a regular jump and

it actually made the double jump right

away and therefore I no longer have any

damn chance to use

that is a possibility

oh

another hey I missed this another

subscription key foreign

I guess it says gifted our community

subscription or a gifted by subscribe

all right I ran into the edge of that

one

oh

yeah it's a community gift so it's just

a random let's see

how about that is indeed okay yeah yeah

and then in that case I understood what

you mentioned the problem it would be

that they would not have made a good

oh oh yeah yeah I could I could see what

you mean that where before I land it's

just a double gem

that is something I I start annoys me I

love English

when I want to and also crash Fusion

it's it's interesting I crash foreign

[Music]

I'm not learning this level

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

yeah

because I was saying that uh no

getting fresh point if I want to make a

big jump I want to hold there I got

those as well all that counts

[Music]

did you know what I say see if I got

those two three boxes with three seconds

and some more books I would actually got

a lot

and yeah so if I want to make a big jump

I oh wants to press down jump to jump

higher from the box but then it does

that yeah

instead of jumping high in front box

seriously

you can do that then

come on picking

oh

yeah

was it kind of slow there

foreign

and then between myself

now

what was that

okay so press the account slide

underneath TNT that's a thing that's not

a field function

let me jump after my slides I wish crash

was a bit further to the left

at least when you're holding down the

jump button

more good

hey

[Music]

this one was random the other two were

selected

oh oh I see I see

oh yeah yeah nice

there's a different message I see what

you can have still I wonder if there's

another it's the same I can see like

list of users there is a list of uses

who doesn't say who is subscribed or not

like

yeah I don't know

I don't know who else who is a member

here

no problem yeah

the second order

[Music]

but thank you so much for all the uh

for everybody gifts Subs

yeah the only issue is that it really

does it does definitely helped me and

sadly it doesn't count towards the uh

the uh

next emote slot unless I get more and

more subscription before one runs out

before

just I don't know why they've done that

I need 25 at exactly could you could run

over there but not at the same time I

need a higher 25 exactly exact same time

I heard it's been a gym

you get out here the subscribers are on

the list it's love but if I go right now

I can see if I know my subscribers let

me give to someone oh that's fine let's

dance

big tall not small showed up today who

is that subscriber that's the only

currently the only person who has

written in chat is not a subscriber

and so far

I've seen which never came

and that's also a thing and

nothing what happened there

so I've landed on the box and then I ran

off the box I tried to jump but I

couldn't now it came

and but I couldn't jump but because I

ran off the box and started falling it

up

and then I had it on the ground and I

tried to jump again but I jumped too

late so I already have version of the

platform and then I just fell

morning

that's how this can work

then now it came

at least at least crash foreign

[Music]

[Music]

no come on

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

has his arms erased that's when I can't

jump

and and he landed on the platform and

for a few frames

he had his arms down and that's the

window I had could jump with Instinct I

should have jumped

immediate this

yeah

[Music]

I'll grab my sauce and chop up the

steeping pan

so much all I'll stuff that interest me

you could probably build some platforms

instead that would probably help me more

but nice I was spinning up about the box

but it didn't break the bar that's why

we did

I do want like on screen

yeah I was just spinning around the box

but didn't get it

on screen display showing when I press

the buttons

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

hunting test

oh wow that was close

no

[Music]

there you go that's what I wanted but

that's not what I wanted

can't be clapping with swords sorry well

let's show you can

crash could probably run across the

sword he seems like a person who would

please

sword across stick around

and think of the if there's that crash

level with an action sword platform

[Music]

um

this snack of

then now there was no scene

oh now I keep trying across

wasn't because there was no scene

okay

let me start and then just straight in

the middle

uh I won't avoid those straight in the

middle and I'll get

and after that section

right side there and then left side

and I should yes there we go

and then jump again

yes

should you keep to the right side

[Music]

come on stand up

thinks about two seconds for him to

stand up so that was a waste of time

[Music]

can't get across I just want to Landon

to go one minute 20 more seconds and

yeah it's too easy

I wasn't even playing good it's almost

like they don't hold rush through these

it's

you see

forget every box and just concentrate

shooting on the limbs only oh

the shoot button is not they should they

attack button is not just shoot button

knee

buttons yeah I should like go to the

clock

right

yeah I was thinking why are these times

so I only need to

treat of those enemy

that should only focus on shooting

different leaders

and I can annoy me

they still get that

it doesn't seem like

okay it just doesn't make any sound

you know maybe I don't get it if I if I

don't shoot the clock yeah maybe it's

maybe it's been a bit tricky dancing

a little bit weird and I really should

give me it

nice too

oh

foreign

[Music]

too many bombs

then I need to basically get on these

all this

oh I saw some planes

there's a nice one

to go through Dr bombs

and then

I don't even remember all the time was

oh

I didn't mean to press that button

room

count okay so yeah if I like

get the boxes better I could get

okay anyway

like level adjusting the insane

Trilogy would count those time boxes

even like short pressure yeah I know

foreign

[Music]

this is a swimsuit level

and Pronto will definitely just go

I mean

there's not much of a difference for how

much much better is showing between the

swimsuit and the dress

uh but yeah revealing more of her

fur when she's going through goo

just increases the likelihood of getting

view of an on a fur

but he's like a good idea

no drop down

no don't do that

I went crazy

I went crazy

makes it for 011 yeah I can wait for a

rest of this

one yeah that sounds more like something

I could expect from someone

disgusted pumpkin

no no

my mask

you know Mary

I wanna yeah we just rush through this

now

it balanced me up because it was a TNT

and it does that

okay

well at least it doesn't go do this

tooth as much

Maybe

I guess I guess you're right the guild

wouldn't go through the swimsuit as much

as it would go through this

foreign

point

can I

yes I can stand there good

does this count

that's good to know

kitten Creek has been doing his business

I hope it's not that kind of business

though

I cannot I cannot send it and then I

immediately remember what it would mean

but I'll continue with my sentence with

intended like nothing

this reminds me of work yeah I mean yeah

this was introducing worked so yeah

it's actually level two important that

means

that's been she has been a subscriber

for a previous month since month

right that sounds good

I don't know what kind of business

you're using can I see in front of

borough all right it's not that kind of

borough hotel but that doesn't make an

interesting part

but I'm a good kitten

50 Barrel

where where all the bunnies lives

but I do like the name imagine calling a

burrow Bonnie burrow

my phone out correctly to the other one

basic phone I mean I like that but my

reference but I like that for him

the idea is text-to-speech or something

Darkness are the spellings

foreign

changes for me I meant the other way

around

that was wrong

thank you for staying for so long

in this thank you for showing up in the

first place you do this one

I'm glad you

enjoyed it

your stay here

in my technical talks and everything

welcome

I mean there's been a lot of Rick Smith

the Spain's time continuum doesn't hold

together due to all these rips

foreign

oh

wait let's get out of the way come on

no not that fun fun

this is for this foreign

thank you

but I was sliding I was sliding

I even heard the sound of sliding

he was sleeping across the ground

well

that was such a waste of time

I was gonna say yeah

and then I did an extra spin

oh come on

but I need to Demas

I would never be able to use the two

masks in this and I want I want to waste

the first one here and I want to waste

the second one here

but I will never never get to this pet

because I managed to lose one of them

earlier

and I'm not sure I never managed to do

it every time

yep and then that's happened

now we're going to get through this area

without taking any damage

yep

then they get here boom only because

that that's flame server guy how to use

use a flame server for like a one frame

or something which hasn't happened

before

then I yeah

it's always something probably something

that prevents me from doing what I want

to do

and even if the game has to cheat just

to make it happen

nice

I still say they must

be gone

now he says

and I don't want my boobs to be gone

I don't even have boobs in the first

place so there's no groups to be gone

[Music]

thank you

again again what he's doing that

I'm raising even more time if I have to

wait for the film

what

I want mine gone why do we have wings I

mean I'm out there

[Music]

I didn't consider you having boobs still

let me get yours

now I just want mine to grow naturally

and something

like my estrogen

there we go

parachute

okay

okay now let's see

there you go

no why was my attack

the centimeter medication I was

it was once oh

an estrogen medication

well um

I want to set here

my friends hey ADHD I need that now I

got that properly

rapper medication meant for me

foreign

foreign

there we go

there's an easy game to get these

apparently

eight levels done and it's only been two

and a half

she's okay I did much more than just

this

I didn't know how long I've actually

been spent on the quest

challenge so far

yeah I'm probably not going to be

finished with this game but it's not

much left though

[Music]

it would be a bit silly to leave

such a little left in the game

[Music]

I will see how much it is when I get

there

full hour

you have a clock on screen I'm gonna

that's what I could replace behind me no

okay so you can see my interfer time

[Music]

I didn't know if I'm up to late or not

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

okay

um

I have left

because later is really more difficult

especially these jungle levels they seem

to be very annoying

well I I might be able to

um

do the spin there

if I can remember where it is

here

when I should have I should have just

stand stood on a platform and

accepted the shortcut I took

okay I can't do that

I can't see that green twin I can

apparently do that twice

not a third time

and that is a nice donut

wait for me

a nice meeting

foreign

no stupid bird always Birds

and wasted Birds you ruin everything

green

everything

[Music]

yeah what is my second Jump game

I guess I don't need this like I only

really need first speed like this

can't jump come on what is this

fresh insane trilogy

and when I jump forward to land on a

platform so pork cement and

and

the character in question

is jumping across the whole box for some

weird reason

and it happened so many times when I was

playing that game

so it almost felt like an intentional

front kitchen

which does not makes any sense to me

because why wouldn't make it like that

every crash game has some small feature

that annoys me so much

it's kind of nice I actually don't know

if every question has

such thing but

I mean every game must have

[Music]

there we go

every game has at least a feature that

must be the most annoying

yeah

thank you

stupid parents yeah

trapping on my car destroying my

vegetable plants really everything of

course that's not good it's

how to have that enemy can press me

because you're supposed to slide on them

swimsuit time is all right

yeah I might need to

continue this

another stream

thank you

thank you

what am I supposed to do here

oh okay so I might be able to do that

might

if I get thank you timing with me

Mouse

it's in the platform

so I wasn't even close there to the

enemy

nice jump

you can see me I can probably do it I'm

a bit more concentration yeah let's see

but I was in my slide even and the enemy

is blocking the clock how is that here

and this is the 10 of 20 levels so after

this one I've done half an hour

so hard to

yeah all the way up there

um

laughs

there we go

yeah

this is how you do it

all right no burn

I want that because it's probably going

to be another bird

anything now that

middle finger

where's my jump

my

down this game is so annoying me

foreign

and I just drop down

well over there no I need that

I probably need it

that

I think it probably takes the character

anyway but

that one

thank you

a little gecko

ruins everything

and the platform is gone

foreign

things

now we jump I didn't need to jump with

it still has to jump button

foreign

all right

now

that's what I've come back

wrong attack

huh so close I don't know how close it

was even

and that's how many counties

what that was two seconds missed

and

record regarding how close I was killing

the enemy not close at all okay

there we go don't say quickly every game

but it doesn't matter because I have to

wait for this plan for

let's try to offer in person

and I just tried to be really sticky

stuff

doesn't matter how I do it

I think there we go finally

I don't even know what this stuff

continues once you just jumped off there

all right now compass

oh I should just continue

plants want to come back

God

come on give me killed now

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

all right

come on now

this is silly

don't be so silly

no more

wow wow

there you go

now we're gonna see

a bit tricky start there

no seems okay

don't do a spin that's my thing

that's amazing

I know

missed it

I don't know what I can run into and not

run into

[Music]

I have to be careful

no it's this section this section

section

yeah it isn't that what it's going to be

very fun

[Music]

[Music]

come on

all right

um

I guess not

well now

If I Only Had the Mustang

guys

nothing impressive

[Music]

I'm trash champ

and there was no double jump

yeah the scene is so Random

I wonder if there's a way to

hey if it shows up enough

[Music]

[Music]

there we go now jump on me

[Music]

there we go

foreign

[Music]

so much going on in that section

and I wanted to have confidence with it

in regular game

and more fun to see an evening

so that's probably what's going to take

this team

this level

is nearly something

sure it's a Snow Job

[Music]

ding ding bear

now I see

jumped on the penguin just missed

everything here

box

that's how we do it here

sometimes I might say

the single boxes thousand sometimes

[Music]

there we go

no I didn't think that would say I

didn't take them from that instead

and then comes this section

[Music]

they have this section there is a

electricity thing on the left side

now okay I'm definitely not suggestion

stop looking at me like that

yeah if I clicks now you have a snow job

[Music]

all right

and this level is showing some jump in

the snow

there's a singer frame jump windows

I do love some single thing jumping nose

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

I'm also not taking damage from that

standing in front of me

well I thought I was going to fall

afternoon

but I stayed on it I did that again

that's what I believe

yeah that makes sense

let's process if you would call it the

ice bear like in many languages because

I smelled

[Music]

snowman stupid still not called a

snowman I guess the polar Sergeant

melting here I mean

uh the pro but the polar is his tones it

has nothing to do with coldness it just

happens to be cold on Earth

and Mars

team

it doesn't have to be combed

I want my second jump

I want my second jump

all I want for Christmas is a second

jump

when I play this crash game

foreign

[Music]

and then this section comes

then I keep to the right side

two on the left side what

oh my

oh my

two on the left why was there not a

single jump I press the button I've seen

five years

[Music]

let me see when when crash was running

down the hill

he was texting running forward and

therefore

was no longer standing on the ground

because

I guess I'm not going to keep that last

man

right side

and then yes uh what I guess Center left

right left

and nothing left

about that

and then

jump jump left jump kick the left right

and then this comes this section

and a penguin

[Music]

liquidation differences

[Music]

I mean penguin decided to spin number

seven

foreign

[Music]

makes sense

iceberg

them

the penguin started to spin

but I gotta stop touching penguins

I forgot to keep watching it right

Center Left Right water left

and then right now

I don't know anymore

and then this section comes jump jump

keep your left jump left move right and

then this section comes

[Music]

um

there we go and then

there's two fences one two and then and

then and then that's the next thing to

get past

well now I don't have any speed

[Music]

it's a polar bears makes no sense

because the polar implies they live with

both vowels or they only live at one at

the North Pole and North southbound ah

because

um

insert animal which contains desert in

the name

the exists in every desert dessert and

but they don't

I don't know if there's another one with

the suit dessert dessert

[Music]

now polar bear implies that our daily

bread at least one or two pounds

what about this upon if not just

imaginary anyway

you could have

different bones

the campaign is polar bears in inside

the luminos prime

[Music]

with a copy for the breast so it implied

they live in North Pole even though they

only have architecture

I mean if you want to call them brother

Birds they're impressive

earthquake racing

come on

and I want this a second jump

ER

come on now

I can do it I am after a Pom-Pom and I

can do some things

like running into the the Box station

thank you

to the right don't get left

I keep forgetting that

if to the rights past those minds and

then continue or like maybe means a good

job

of mine

jump too early

oh

[Music]

no jump at all I would crash Jam then I

put this inconvenient

yeah why why

in a platforming game why should I make

sure that they jump or it says it should

that's insane that doesn't seem like an

important feature practicing you should

focus on making sure it works as it

should

stay to the right make my job then move

to the left there we go and I missed the

mask

and then I get to this section

and there we go and I've jumped over the

two

start again

and go and let's do this section

across these

[Music]

is

the second one and then I just go in the

middle

oh so that's what comes after but it's

defenses on the left side I need to give

to your side but but then I need to I I

wanted to just press the jump button

which just doesn't jump in in slow

downwards anything to jump again come on

this is annoying

he didn't jump again we just didn't jump

and press the button at least twice

there's nothing more yeah here's another

thing if you have a platforming game

where the character is a little bit

glitchy so sometimes it's like

4C

slightly due to some imprecise

platforming yeah

calculations

um

if if you have this thing or your loud

play to jump

as

slightly

oh yeah thank you uh even after leaving

the ground that also solves any issues

with that as well

what have I got

this arm is like having such a feature

who makes the game over on Play-Doh

and then something but it's an old game

they didn't think about it in time the

real places you can have it

so they have no excuse for not having it

and then I'm going to all right no don't

jump everything

excited

[Music]

and then

yeah I'll try to jump

and then Center

and then penguins

no it was two of them and then these

comes

without any

and then it was just no no it was like

the end of the section

end of this section

and again no

this level we're doing we're showing up

then it's going to be the last level of

the student fight very cheap

definitely exactly less

expect

and this tablet really shows it off

I can't wait until I'm done with this

stain but this spider didn't have issues

just jumping flying I'm like image

that's it

I don't I don't know how

Inspire games

basically jumping and then

the

equivalent of damage jumping as in

starting to play

I don't think I've ever had an issue

with

but in crash games where what platform

is such an important factor that is

for some reason the double jump is so

foggy

[Music]

wow I landed on a platform and I died

[Music]

okay I'm getting tired of this level now

okay one more about the sheets and um

quick cooking the lemon

I forgot the same BS that's on I am

thank you

[Music]

left right left

and

[Music]

then it's this section

and this section up jump too late and

then Center and what's what's done next

oh I was running in the two and then

there I think well

[Music]

another one

now after those two

there's one more I thought there was the

end of seven

oh more BS

double jump just doesn't work sometimes

and and double jump just doesn't work

sometimes

and that's just how this game works I

couldn't even finish my sentence before

you don't jump

anything

[Music]

right now I'm sorry taking it because

[Music]

let's see the the disappointed Ram it is

a very interesting

dancing

rabbits you're sitting at the sugar like

you think I'm gonna eat this whole thing

actually I am going to eat something

foreign

[Music]

ah I didn't need two boxes I need to

jump

and I didn't say I was completed them

after some Venus and there's been plenty

of bees already right there another

moment of BS another one is just as I

pointed it out it happened again

I mean yeah sure yes

game is technical not malfunctioning it

is acting exactly as this program

that's still badly programmed

Quincy

I'm still quite good game I mean it's

not okay

come on should I never get to keep the

mask

[Music]

I just want to keep in mind

okay I have this jump left side mask

middle left right left

jump don't jump

and then down jump jump with the left

side jump close your right side Rush at

any traffic jump around it too early

penguin in the way I need to jump

immediately after the second one

[Music]

and then an afternoon tourist I need to

wait feet before I turn

where's my puppy Chum

why isn't it working

and when I push the button multiple

times I want it to become larger on skin

to really really highlights how I'm

gonna see

me shouldn't be too hard to make such a

on-screen thing really

um this is probably someone who has I

mean obviously didn't exists I can't

speed not just use them but I wouldn't

be surprised that that's not some some

kind of overlay thing that you were

run some kind of third party software

that takes up like after my computer's

performance to just run yeah because

when the developers say lightweight

it's not lightweight

[Music]

is that night time to complain don't do

my stuff because I can't do that

my feet tube is a lightweight and Avatar

is singing you can use on your screen I

mean sure it's probably lightweight or a

Unity software but it's still running

Unity do you know how heavy that engine

is probably not too heavy but still it's

a king engine it's not lightweight you

can't make something in unity for any

audio engine like this and call it

lightweight

[Music]

yep that's not how it deploy it that's

not what lightweight is

what

am I wrong I could be wrong but

I'm not too happy with my diamonds

I don't know what happens

foreign

now

this is how I should think that's

everything but I keep forgetting

[Music]

but press it

probably mean lights made by how much it

pushes the entrance of the engine

serving like yeah I mean that was kind

of kind of like I said there to like

yeah it's it's lightweight for a Unity

software definitely

um but it's still a Unity software so

you can't call it lightweight even you

can in that case you have to call it a

light green Unity software

foreign

yeah someone could probably build a

similar one like

this is my SpaceX software so

I know I know it's developer I haven't

spoken thing I actually don't know I

even tried to contact him

he's asking him to make a V2 rival

in C sharp

left side

okay and that is this section

oh

oh damage and then

it's nice out there yeah and then jump

in the market oh it's so thank you

all right get out of my way

here we go and then there's this section

uh and then there's some boxes coming

here and then there's another one

and I'm not the one

okay press the press this and better

press it too late

three of them

now jump and jump

that's right you're in struggle with

this game

my top jump doesn't work

[Music]

one one thing for sure is is not double

jumping too often

just

try anything

I forgot to react to the scene

I reacted too early to the scene

we're making one

and my dad I'm gonna be gone again

[Music]

[Music]

just this it shouldn't be this hard but

yeah I don't know

okay how can I have this being active

and collide with the box in the box

that's not this destroyed in what sense

does that make

probably

[Music]

because it was so much change

[Music]

this tank really shines through when you

do the time chance

[Music]

jumping

there you go now I didn't take damage

then

[Music]

with penguins

yeah two of them

and then that's actually medium dark

Jeff

forgot how that section went because it

was so long ago I wouldn't they

oh this Amazon correct

yes

and the slide didn't work

twice

it wasn't like one time it was in a row

this line didn't work

let's try it

it's not worked wow

the champions

oh man I guess it can only start to jump

into music all down the platform without

any jump I'm clearly jumping off every

track for me

but sometimes it's just no jump in that

sense

the jump didn't much

it's not like I'm eating orange

[Music]

and then now I shouldn't jump

and then it's this Jackson I know it's

going to rejection now

[Music]

almost

and and then is two

and then there was this immediate option

and then there was those boxes

and there's three of these one two

oh there was only two of this

what

so that was three

and then there's just ending

watch out

[Music]

my place to decision enough time still

Cannon already goes oh no not this

stupid penguin

yeah it was pretty well currently

143 for the internet and I don't even

get killed well I did it finally

[Music]

that is a half an hour over time but I

guess it's fine I got that level down

oh and the last section was a single try

and I got through it

wow

oh my God's pain

[Music]

I'm not the one to give up so easily

so much

so much

tough

wait a minute

someone's using a third dream

anniversary

does that mean is third stream during

the animation

or the third years of University and

it's a stream

going on before

one and a half hour I may representative

universities uh let's go visit

[Music]

she is currently doing

uh

uh scary stream

interestingly enough

so

I don't know how long she will go for

but she's currently doing so

let's go let's go and I want to use a

bridge

[Music]
