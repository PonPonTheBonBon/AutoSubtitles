wo back to the
game yeah some
onio here we
go okay now I can hear okay this is the
track I was trying to go for last time
yeah and I tried to use this
one time to
continue not not much PR
strange p p hello red red
red P Pon is back to driving
cars
just like I was getting food and you're
just in
time just 1 minute since the stream
started you haven't missed that stuff
like it's been 8 seconds into the
trees no
worries
what
starting off with
that no
liing give my dress
back it's it's a nice racing outfit I
Cas there we go
okay I have to
oh SP that's good
one sporty sport way someone's tying to
me you want
to want a c p
[Music]
okay
so slightly worse acceleration but it
should be able tou see higher top speed
if if these cars will move out of the
way
okay good thing I can
restart yes
sleep on conf
slay that's a that's a nice place to
[Music]
sleep here we go smoothly passing those
cars and then going through
[Music]
here don't bump the
wall
C and definitely not got my warm up
yet let's
[Music]
see yeah I didn't mean
to there some strange polygon
there
don't mean to drive outside the track
either
but
well slightly on the Rock
there quite the battle between these
[Music]
two okay and then
the outside still not as good
as like the my first attempt
today it
[Music]
works than
getting getting past these and and I
should do better in the get up
grass don't
belong be sleepy
here also how is this
monacle
I saw the place was very tiny and
basically just
uh but maybe there is a lot of
[Music]
mountains
oh I'm not sure why I'm messing up so
much
today
[Music]
[Music]
well it works it
works
why is the uh I don't know why why the
stick is so
sensitive maybe I can reduce
the maybe the steering is too
[Music]
aggressive
would been easier with Like a proping
Wheel racing
[Music]
whe that's a
controller be quite while for even F
those and red car on we
go now let's see if we can get
what's this
car could probably done that
b as matter how slow I go I still
managed to end up on the Rocks
thing when I go that slow no this other
car might catch
up maybe careful there
just
okay
prise that the stick is so
sensitive it really doesn't help because
I barely touch
it wish I could change it so it's more
logarithmic so in the middle it does
less movement as I move it in the middle
and then the further out I move the more
it's just
moving as far as I know there's no
settings for
that there's only linear movement for
sticks I really want to just that oh Bon
tmmy
yes I mean you should redeemed
[Applause]
it
so there is a bun
com I guess it would be kind of nice to
sleep
[Music]
on
[Music]
the only chance I have is if the leading
card crashes but the leading card does
sometimes so but it doesn't look like
that's happening this
race I'm sure I'm not I'm not draing
perfectly I really need to adjust the
Ste and see okay it looks like the Le
car
crashed
no there you go must
is I can set it to smooth there not sure
if that will help nice and fluffy
yes
[Music]
way
car maybe maybe it does have
be
yeah I'm definitely doing better
now as I drive up on the clip side and
Let's ignore
that
hey
tack fing
paint
[Music]
I will eventually win
this I am I'm getting
better I touched the grass and then I
fly
off
touching the grass and flying up into
space this driver always coming coming
up and
annoying
attacking now le this really far
away
[Music]
only chance I Now
crashes
so no CH ni time okay one more
try
okay I didn't mean to do that
but
I probably lost more on
it
yeah cuz I was in second place previous
race in
this in this
location
no car in the
way they driving really fast
there
[Music]
well
that no why did I lose all control of
car
there staring is still really
sensitive I do wonder if there is a
setting that can change it so a small
movement results in an even small
smaller movement in the game but a full
movement is still a full movement that
would be a
logarithmic
input well I mean that help
second now I just need to get a catch up
with a leing
car
that wasn't too
bad it was bad but could have been
worse it's bad enough doubling the
distance down but
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
there's a
leader now I just need leader
to do a mistake of some
sort whoops I made a
mistake
yeah that was massive mistake I feel
like doesn't matter how much I slow
down just can't I can never do that
corner but the computer is flying
through the
corner the computer is cheating it's
something over
some
what I didn't even know okay seriously I
I really dislike this I don't know why
why this thing is behaving like that
because I feel like it hasn't behaved
like this
yesterday or for some reason I could
play the game yesterday and I struggle
with it
now is there a way to adjust the uh I
really I really really want now I can
adjust only set The
Binding unlock Dead Zone unlock
Sensitivity I could reduce the
sensitivity
um but that doesn't really change the uh
he at least at least might might help a
bit but it still doesn't do
the why doesn't I mean it does help a
bit definitely does help a b they really
should have um
a graph where you can set the uh
logarithmic logarithmic scale of
it if you work with like Curves in
Photoshop or
something okay it is less sensitive or
at least
I I think it's less
sensitive this still very sensitive but
it's less come on why was that
necessary so at
least now I can make finer
adjustments this is actually actually
issue with a lot of racing games I wish
that the the quicker you quick quicker
you were driving the less sensitive the
steering was so I can just push the
stick a little to the
side because if I'm going 200 I don't
want to do like a full um like I I fully
understand that if you're standing still
or driving like 30 50 maybe even if you
push the stick furthest to the left or
right that's the full movement of the
steering wheel left and right that makes
perfect sense but if if I'm doing 200
and pushing the stick left or right I
don't want the full stick movement to
left or right be to be the full steering
to the left and right because I wouldn't
I would not steer the car like that
because it would not make sense at that
speed So the faster I go the less a
maximum steering steering it should
be it could be a setting in the game of
course not everyone might want
that they might be insert
com insert joke comment there might be
people who want to to do I actually
don't know how to express that to do
stupid movements to
like
yeah it was an
also did the did the way work there I
didn't even pay attention to it I'm
trying
to I wonder who wants to do
that someone who doesn't know how to
r i mean okay in some some situations
you might want to do
that but at least I like a modify button
or something to it in that
case
it would be
neat I understand the the softw wouldn't
be able to do that for it to determine
how quick the car is driving and adjust
the sensitivity this automatically B
on because as as of now the car is just
turning too much with losing the
grip someone might argue that well
that's part of the
skill but it's so extremely sensitive
barely move to do these turns I'm barely
moving the stick I'm barely using the
full full range of the stick and
I and such a waste of
position I just have to be so careful
when turning and it's so
annoying
but I still I mean I guess I could sense
lowens but but still need like the
full full turn for that corner in
[Music]
com barely move the sck I'm turning too
much no expect complaining
but
doesn't I actually don't know how often
that is in that case I need like a third
party software I can put the controller
input into that takes the stick position
and convert it
to logarithmic input and then outputs
it not an unnecessary
step the see I had to mess around with
for oh wait actually steam might have
that oh I
crashed I don't know but I bet whoever
would want to do that must be really
cool
no I don't know what you're talking
about at the
moment
all I'm saying is that at least at least
the thing I'm saying is just
that the amount you move with using the
stick should reduce as the Qui as
quicker you
go whoever wants to disable that would
not be a cool person
because you're not going to win the race
doing
that you're going to lose precision and
you're just going
to lose the grip and you're just going
to go
slower basically what I'm doing at the
moment CU I just can't I just want to
Define moments you just want to follow
this curve curve finally but cuz it's
slightly I touch the stick it does this
massive movements and then I just drive
into the side of a wall and this is why
I'm losing this
race seriously I can't I can't do this
I'm concentrating more of the game to do
better here but the the whole this is so
terrible so
terrible H so
bad I I don't
understand
oh yeah oh yeah I see it because the uh
oh no this is even more
terrible yeah because it doesn't have
H okay this is this is horrible okay so
I can't even I
cannot I wanted to like lower the analog
sensitivity so I could
uh
so I could
uh yeah get less sensitivity like like
more accuracy from the stick but if but
if I do that it also reduces the
uh the range of the accelerator so I
can't do full acceleration anymore I
wanted to do like 50% so I can only do a
maximum 50% steering which
obviously results in me to being able to
steer 50% of the maximum
turning but it would make the steering
twice as accurate which is what I want
but it makes the acceleration to be half
as efficient and that's not going to
make me win the
race yeah way too sensitive Ste here
it's why why can't I set the sensitivity
and that s for
every back in my day when I played
emulators when emulators did were were
terrible you had full control over over
the settings of like controller inputs
you could set Dead Zone and and stuff
and you could
set uh how the inut you should input
with logarithmic or not then you could
adjust lot of bunch bunch of interesting
stuff but then as
emulation
Dre they try to simplify things
like oh if using an X input like an Xbox
controller you don't have to do any
settings you just plug it in and just
run okay okay but I want to use the
triggers for acceleration therefore the
triggers has to be mapped to the right
stick instead of actually the L2 and R2
because I want to have the actual modern
Racing
controls I'm not allowed to do that
anymore at least this one I can adjust
the controls
freely
but
yeah welcome to P complaints about
software I only complain about I'll be
I'm back welcome back I want to complain
about subt and software is terrible I
mean I understand there's a lot of
programing and
stuff you
understand
and do you still at the same time it
doesn't feel like it would be too much
to program to allow you to set the
sensitivity and dead zone of every
analog axis individually I mean sure it
will need more settings but I don't feel
like it would be hard for program
individual settings instead of a global
settings for every analog access
X face
[Music]
me hello any
man he found the
star and pushed off the I'm going I'm
not wow streaming early today I'm not
sure if this is early
streaming I mean I usually started 14
started 16 sat
today
[Music]
I'm just trying to win this race but I'm
currently it's it's the same thing when
I was playing like iron
fish I was so annoyed by the controls
camera controls until I realized I could
do I do I really need to because in
Steam I can adjust a lot of settings
when it comes to controls do I really
need to
put use steam input through the mulate
S7 probably what I have to do at this
point just to play this
game see I don't I don't
cuz
so this is the dark
station
emulator well ER I've seen you streaming
a while because I'm it my regular
schedule I think the ear stream I've
done is
[Music]
10
we so yeah so I'm using duck station
which I've got I've seen some
recommendations
for and it does seem to emulate the best
per amount of performance it uses which
is
great uh for some reason everything has
to be
ony wee I didn't know that was possible
to do what my
[Music]
time um
but it doesn't seem to be to be any way
to
contact the
uh duck station
team there's no like there's
a yeah I don't I don't know how would
you report
issues
[Music]
let make sure I not that they probably
want a bunch of feature quests anyway it
would be a feature request let me adjust
the analog stick sensitivity
and uh each axis
individually and also allow me to set uh
uh logarithmic input instead of linear
input that's basically my two two
requests s can stay watch I really just
Dro
by yeah I mean yeah you have worked and
stuff but I wake up in about 4 hours
yeah you really need to sleep
more for your own
sake
[Music]
every just
[Music]
me I had to get complaining after my
system only see more weeks maybe that
money while wait wait HS make that money
while the books are open and the checks
are
blank those are expressions I don't know
them hi
Adan scbe the
Piller
here we
go okay I'm doing better
now no thanks
[Music]
to I think that actually would have
would be like a steering wheel for the
like steering wheel steering wheel
gaming controller
basically
that definitely would help
me new L it was pretty quick I
think
no course the computer just was driving
really slowly for some reason and then
I and I and was in the way and I
couldn't react quick enough
and I lost the whole race due to that
because the
computer got away from the hoing thing
because I bumped the computer
away and of course and then those
computer bump me and I lose grip all day
just
driving good no problem and I'm losing
voice I really don't not sure how they
speed through that corner so
quickly no blank Shack by means they're
not really really concerned about how
many I was you're getting really the 12
of limit set by my boss to make sure we
get
some okay yeah definitely not I'm not
familiar with that
expression
[Music]
okay
what's what's so frustrating trying to
do
this it's just how terrible the controls
[Music]
are and some games just have B bad
controls
like R turn fire had a bad button left
so I changed
it made it
better other than that the contr wer
that
bad
the only issue I had was that the
helicopter did not have
like move the hel I either you pressed
up and the helicopter moved forward in
the direction it was facing or you
pressed up and the helicopter rotated up
and then moved up there was no there was
no mode for pressing up and and the
helicopter strapes up regardless of
which direction it's facing that's the
input method I wanted but the game did
not give me it I just had to deal with
whatever it came
[Music]
me
[Music]
I know my
clothes
see are am
exposed don't look at
me
yes cover your
eyes ah watch where his back
no don't look at me with those King
[Music]
eyes look at bnny belly okay yes you can
look there I
guess my CL is back say okay
[Music]
can I finally complete this level I only
have five more to
do and
straide this really pushing my gaming
skill
[Music]
I might take comenting on that before
but it really feels like if you bump a
computer player from behind or something
it feels like the computer's slowing
down it's like not what you're supposed
to do if you're trying to win a race you
should go forward at higher
speed oh no someone's bumping me let's
stop the car in the middle of the
race might just be me not realizing
what's going on but it really feels like
it bumping others from
behind what are you tackling that
was you want to want to bump me from
behind
yes no of
course like almost every interaction
with the computer is me losing out on
it losing they come is I
lose get a petty fluffy bun buny tail
yes bump bump the bunnytail squish
it
B cck
it it is an interesting looking but
thing
yeah so for
the for the studio model I was the tail
will be made but it will basically not
show
up unless you see p from from side or
something it redeemed to have fun fun do
uh turn around
[Music]
ration
I will see maybe I can get I have a
friend who is an experienced artist who
might make to be able to make one of
those turnarounds I think I don't know
if that's what's called front view side
view back
you my fun fun character as a guide for
making the 3D
model and then I have another
friend who
knows people who would be able to do a
3D model for payment of course
but second place I wasn't even paying
attention
H get a p the fluffy bunny T well I
guess I'll take one for the team
and you can put the uh H okay that's a
that's a good idea
and twitch has considered adding more
bat emotes I really think it should be
like a
500 should be 1 bit 100 bit 500 bit
there's all,
and then like I think it should be and
then it's 5,000 I think it should be 2
and half th000
and
72,000 so this climbing steps are
shorter and closer together encouraging
people to donate
more hey where did the car
go and then I can add it because the bat
emotes are my emotes that I can have
random that AR
Expressions so I can put for
example uh bnny
PA p
pa and Bunny
T and stalling yes you should go to bed
but I should go to bed now good night
again good
night and I keep messing
up and I'm talking about all kinds of
stuff the
model
emot CU I don't see need
for
plus if adding more steps in bit modes
which I said could encourage people to
climb the bit the rankings more because
it's closer to HP not that would because
when I suggested expanding the options
for types of redeems someone said that
well this isn't going to make twitch any
money so they aren't going to prioritize
adding such a feature and that's
fair which is a company all about making
money but if they do add more steps for
beat the modes oh dress is back that
isn't going to directly make the mon but
if it ENC if it
encourages people to donate come on get
out of the way I'm trying to win the
race yeah it's terrible if it encourages
people to um
I should clear out
the redeem Q
here to
and uh
donate more bits that is going to make
twitch more
money it's also going to make the twitch
streamers more
money so they should
be might be on board of this IDE as
well
oh because I because I really do want to
make a PO emote and a pil
emote
and another idea that could
uh also make which money is being able
to and bits over to our user instead of
actually
uh because currently you can donate bits
to
streamer that is taking bits and
and converting it to money for that
streamer and spending the money the
bits but I was thinking just handing
over bits to to another
viewer it's not spending bits it's not
making the streamer
money it's not giving you any form of
reward but that others user can then use
the in its intended
way cuz some viewers just don't have uh
the option to get
bits but in this way another user could
purchase bits and then donate it to a
bunch of
people which would also be a way for
twitch to make
money and find these
two okay finally finally first place
whoa I've been in first place before not
today though but
yesterday let's see if I can keep
it perfect
ads I
guess and also thank twitch for letting
me know that ads were
coming T did not tell me as where
coming he suppos to tell me 20 minutes
in ahead of time that ads are
coming it did
not I think it just speeds past me like
nothing and then it just stops there for
no reason
[Music]
someone is
stuck bad it wasn't the leading
car 100 me ahead
150
[Music]
150 well I'm losing all
speed okay now it's
see if I can do
this fire is
coming and then use full speed to go
here whoa I did it I
won but doing
it
like two viewers at the moment yeah to r
or
something well we got red there no my
clothes my dress is this is this your
form of celebration for that I
won what kind of rude celebration is
this seeing a stick with this car for
now my name was mentioned yes it says
there's TV so I assume it was
red and it seems to be seems like I'm
correct and my clothes were stolen oh
but is back good now I don't have too
sure of
the Secret
pink that sounds
naughty SS it's purple and nice
okay let's see how this truck is
like this feels more like
Mo but it's only reverse
H probably because of the thick
fog uh so it's it's still the same
track and but it's probably because of
the thick F I can see the massive
mountains I really need to go and look
at more of
again all I know about Monaco is the uh
the
uh
the
for
here that's the only thing I know about
[Music]
it get sharp turn
here this is a new part of the
track is that ho in the
[Music]
ground
okay
whoa hly I don't remember the I mean I
remember these tunnels but I don't
remember them being they had pillars in
the
[Music]
middle so they have covered up yeah that
that at that point they had
uh they had the the fence between the
pillars that makes sense not sure why
they didn't thaten other
place who who four
position running off like
this
oh this is going
terrible yeah and in other
news I did report because said the TT
category for C3 racing was gone
yesterday and I assume it's still
gone it's not as seen that updat very
quickly uh
twitch categories are based on
igdb which is a whole interesting thing
igdb possibly based on based on IMDb
both owned by
Amazon and Amazon is also owning twitch
as so igdb being the infnet gaming
database tracks all the
games and has
a
I'm I'm really not sure why there's a
lot of questions I have about that
database that is kind of
weird
anyway uh on they decided somewhere back
in May I think so it was quite a while
ago but it's not like I'm checking every
game how they're doing they merged see
see with the uh North
American modified version of the game
the TNN
hardcore Super Sports at
TR motorport not super
sport really really interesting name of
the
game so they someone decided to merch
those two so I reported it and said that
they should not be merged because they
are different it's not much of a
difference I'm probably mentioned it
before all cars are replaced with what
the game calls truck every reference to
car has been replaced with either the
term truck or a
4x4 all tracks have different names from
the because the cars in season race are
real cars like they have real
names how accurate they are made that I
don't
know nice and but the trucks have like
random things one is called like Ms
Slinger even if Mudslinger is a real
brand of car it really should say make
and model but it just says Mudslinger
which makes me think it's just a made up
name made up car for the game
and then the tracks instead of being
different location around the world a
different location in the United
States which I find a bit silly
but
and the almost every background has put
the US flag on it because why
not say [ __ ] yeah it's all what you say
I mean it is uh TNN hardcore is a
franchise actually I think it's
a uh yeah it's a franchise an existing
franchise that had two games prior to
the port of C3 racing
so if it's a franchise about United
States it makes
sense even though it's comes up from
here so they have made modifications on
the the tracks I this is going to take
forever now I'm just reminded of game
called hell Dives hell divers so hell
drivers I'm out for
maybe I shouldn't for this from here
kidding
um so they made modifications to the
tracks such as if the uh track uh
Africa H divers
okay uh the the track from Africa which
has been seed for Africa where with
African
trees stereotypical African trees that
track has been modified to has first it
said to be
Arizona and then they have removed all
the trees and
bushes and then they like Chang slightly
change the the texture color of stuff so
the tint is a bit different of
stuff but that's that's
it it's still the same
track
we stopped on Co-op Sho oh doing Co-op
can be a bit tricky though with Friendly
Fire
o yeah you better play with uh someone
who actually wants
to win it together with you I don't mind
friendly fire but you actually have to
play with serious people if you have
friendly fire on it has be a
challenge American
ex Patronis his his
[Music]
glory yeah sometimes he can be B too
much but in this case it was like an
come on I always feel at that I had to
slow down H in this case it was an
existing
franchise I can give it a pass on that
but if they did like see through the
racing but the North American release of
it and call it
like hardcore racing just because
hardcore sounds
better and then and and then changed all
locations United
States in that case that that that would
just be I would
say bad
taste it's also the same version of the
game that is released in uh Canada
so no love for Canada enough okay and
also another change they did was remove
all other
languages like that's a thing I
commented on before I don't
like one way I do understand I
understand that because what they do is
they make the game in North America or
Japan sell it there and if sells good
enough they export it so for example if
if it's a Japanese
game they make it Japan if it sell well
enough in Japan they produce an English
version of it and release it in North
America and if it sell well enough there
then then then they make a translation
of it to the other
languages
only French Spanish German and Italian
basically sometimes
Dutch fr
portes and then they release that in
Europe so in that case I understand
there is no all language option in the
North American
version because they're just testing the
market but if it's like a franchise like
they Spyro the Dragon crash banic that
they
are investing a lot of timeing
too I
mean maybe they didn't expect it to sell
well Europe I don't
know like if they're planning on
releasing in Europe and when planning or
not adding these translations
anyway there we go I it why not
translate it
immediately because they are Spanish and
French speakers in North
America they will reach a wider
audience especially for game like Spyro
where you have a lot of spoken dialogue
giving me hints terrible hint but still
hints but for the case of C3 racing
where they removed the language option
for the North American release that's
even more
bizar you you the had translate I mean
sure the translation said car not
truck and the translation of locations
were didn't it do translation of
locations I mean they could just let the
the original English
name for they different because it's
just the different US states I think
it's fine to keep them if they don't
want to translating from English
okay I don't
think that be a big of an
issue
yeah anyway off back to my original
point I reported it saying that really
should be split I did compare it to
Super Mario Bros 2 because it's it's
it's really very similar to super
mar
C Racing and doy do Panic which is
usually short as uh were both single
individual games with no ongo franchise
no prior game no sequels nothing it's
just a single game which was then ported
over to North America in both cases uh
with to to be part of an ongoing
franchise of multiple games
with a new title and rebranding
replacing the playable characters I
guess in this case is the are the cars
with completely new
designs and oh crashed on nothing and uh
modifying the levels
slightly the levels are barely modified
in super Super Mario Bros
2 and
yeah
there are some gameplay differences I
think the
[Music]
C stats are different how many truck the
truck stats are different from the
cars and the one gameplay difference is
that in uh in C Racing which
I which has happened to me a few times
is that if you fall into water it's game
over
you have to restart the race if it's
this arcade mode I'm doing or it's just
last place if it's
Championship but in the north mag
release it falling into water is just
like crashing cars
reset there it there's this
back
what that's a gaml
difference you still have the option to
switch
between uh miles per hour or kilomet per
hour which is the
same as in C3
racing but the measurement at top which
is kilomet at the
moment uh which is measuring in steps of
100 m by the
way because of one this month Place uh
that is
um has been changed for Miles which only
written as a single m not Mi as it's
usually written as for some reason but
they have not converted the uh
value so it's actually still
metric no my dress how dare you redeem
an outfit and the different outfits
coming back when outfits come back
why did you do this to me don't you see
how cold it is the with all the fog and
rain I'm going to get cold not having my
dress
on and I switch this coming
back on the way done
ta the
done when you finally stop looking at
my
yeah now there isn't even snow okay fair
enough and I am a snow
bunny
well
so when they are split up I'm planning
on
uh if they can undo the changes or like
restore we go it's
nice think that pretty nice moving here
now I just need to replicate it two more
times
are you breaking move out to my
way anyway I will add the screenshots
from game from the two games so it's
clear that they are quite different from
each
other but don't find more races and then
I'm done with this
game obviously this is one of
them we B other
ways okay time to see if I can do that
man maneuver no it's not yet it's next
it's over here yes let's see if I can do
this thing
again here we
go but even though I did that R quickly
it was still slower than the red
car new La
record
car maybe I should try the other car I
don't
know I had this leader let's see if I
can pass the red car and
see see this is like one and a half
kill like
know
oh
no
who well I guess I'm not passing the red
car
now appar you can skip over the fence
quite interesting that it isn't
invisible wall
there but it's oh no I'm getting pass by
the yellow car I would never know how
far ahead the leading car
was I still finish race so I can get
some more CS into the
track oh yeah now I'm really messing
up
[Music]
boom Oh no car fell
wish not a very safe X ending of the
track I I I reached the goal but at what
cost okay one more try but I will try
the new car which wi L
evo5 that's the quite
the where
larm
okay let see see how this
goes
and then I will adjust the
settings yes I
race starting of
t
I'm touching the edge of the road and I
start going
off come on what is
this what is this what am I
doing
I'm trying more the Rocks than the as
asphal which I guess is
rocks well this car is even more
sensitive even though I reduce
spe steing or main steing smooth then
instead of
[Music]
agressive
L bunny driving
back I mean the car turned around so I
took my opportunity to First the
car to do like
a a j turn I don't know if it's called
a
oh I mean it
worked the yellow car kind of ruined it
but it worked
[Music]
[Music]
okay I should be able to do
this we're not that far behind the
[Music]
leader and I am catching
up no it's maybe I
caning car might be good
idea okay getting a bit of lift off was
not that gred me from
accelerating now one
lose we see the leader Leader's getting
away
[Music]
only saying losing distance but that's
is exactly what I want I've lose
distance to the
leader till I am delete
oh I got through it but is exactly how I
plan against
but
still need to get used to the
track damn the got too far away it was
like last lap I'm not going to win at
that
[Music]
point out of my way
he enough
[Music]
[Music]
pushing okay I'm definitely doing better
now
and cting too much in that
[Music]
coration
two wa Le's not that far ahead then I
just need to get through this segment
here like that
nice I am catching
up well I thought I was going to grow
over this
Stone
scared there's Le
I saw
Del
enting
them what is bumping is at the back of
the leaving I to do that I'm not I don't
want want to do it but I almost managed
to do
it I'm I'm getting too excited at
possing the leading cars should Ram
right into
it
[Music]
behind nose first stren it
but while all the cars I just try my
best to go
around
yeah don't go cut that corner too
much one on the lift off
just need to catch up the lead
again and actually pass the leader this
time slowing
down
again again same thing again I bumped
back of the car throw up on the side of
the mountain this I'm really tried to go
around but it didn't work out for me hey
at Le I keep deleting need that
moment oh I got
pumped whoa I did it I did
it I won the
race I'm getting better at this not
thanks to the king but I'm getting
better
at
oh new car need some
Skyline let me STI stick with this car
for now again first first two times two
races out of six
completed that means
that it's night
nice
nice
see so this is like a combination of one
and two
then what part of the track is this is
compl new
tracks
who I'm confused by this
track I don't sure if I should have the
first play through on
the these have
on on as a tank because it's technically
not the first play through of the game I
mean it's First Complete play through
I've never actually done this this
specific race I've never done in my life
I
think
oh
lights they put up street lights oh okay
time to go off oh there's a whole city
now where did this city come from it
wasn't here before I mean I know it took
like a side road but I don't remember
any buildings there was Big Mountain
here
before now the mountain is repl oh
here's the mountain again and there's
like a lighthouse over there there's an
actual Civilization
now New Life
record you doesn't see
anything
oh
[Music]
try
I don't oh this light actually helps me
a lot on this P actually so I will do
this
liting and obviously if you
face if you're facing a rock wall with
your high beams on you don't see
anything because that's how it works
right
[Music]
not sure not sure why it doesn't
[Music]
show now it's for
closest and then there's
that why is the lead they so far away
I'm in second
place complete the race
because okay this does I we check the
both lights I at the same time but oh
well it is what it
is probably is the PlayStation being
limited of how much light it can
show even though the light is like faked
I think I think just
the it has like
a in that case it shouldn't really be a
limitation of much how much light it can
show cuz I think it does is that it has
some kind of
um when it shows a polygon it can be a
single color or have texture on
it I'm not getting even closer to the
mus
and then you can also apply like
a add subract or something to simulate
light like
this so every pogon has uh full subtract
in
color until it's supposed to be light up
by
[Music]
the headlights of the car and then it
increases
or rather decreasing the subtract this
Zer
subtraction that gives the effect
of
headlights no
back cuz you're going to car select
anyway so sure where car and why it's
default the car s
even
I'm a s
bunny the further away light does
help I'll keep using
it it's definitely more useful in this
track than some other
tracks
and then this and and then Al
also and there was Need for Speed which
also had this kind of high beam option
which was really
bad all right this is your third
position I was hoping it was six
position
any the second place is right up
ahead that was going slow through that
tunnel the dark light Place tricks on
me
no mo out the way I'm trying
to come on why red car constantly in
way you can actually bump the those
lights I wasn't sure if they had
[Music]
po
well back to constantly
restarting I mean if it goes really
terrible at the start like what's the
point of me if I have an unlimited
number
ofarts let me back on the turn track
there we
go oh almost that would be so nice if it
actually
worked if it flip me around and landed
on know for that would be quite a
shortcut obviously wouldn't be able to
replicate it every every
lap
reset
button why do the car have to flip
around like spin around and face the
wrong
way let's see if I can do this
bad we
go there we go that was much
better
yeah I think what tricks me with T is
because I used the shadow of the tunnel
to DET where to
break the tunnel does not have a
shadow that's it's headlights are
shining that's an interesting detail
take into
consideration
there we
go he the is not too far
[Music]
away
okay new La
record no too early and never seen
is going
wrong
the Bas thing I have to try as good as
I've did on the previous two tracks but
to eat one it's
night a bit too much
froming I'm only human man wait I'm a
rabbit I
AIT ask me for so much driving on the
side of the
mountain remers the camera angle it does
not remember
the light but it resets what camera I
chosen
[Music]
kind
go the bad
start
no come
on
what and the computer got away
[Music]
that
[Music]
phone
[Music]
[Music]
go do not like how I'm stilling third I
have done better
before
we go now a second Le is not too far
away
just to not try too
terrible go and did not drive into this
pone that
time I meant to say not D to that all
this time
but
accurate English is not important
now she can start by that
s basically have to get
a record win this race oh I see the
leader I finally see the leader for a
very very short
time going to
come
[Music]
[Music]
oh did I do so much
I thought it was going
well I mean of course the crash May L
some but apparently not I tried to look
at the distance right as I CR before the
car was SP away guess I didn't lose much
on it I just loose lost the lot before
that or it's did increase and I wasn't
looking at quickly
[Music]
enough
no I mean I wasn't bad
but t a bit of Side Road run straight
into the par and then the car was on the
side not sure that's how it works but
the critics in this game is a bit
weird
so I'm not the best so F
but hopefully I can catch up
to there we go there's the second place
always the out
car
go
well M
nice
nothing
there Le is not that far away which is
good we have a chance
now don't like this segment so big and
open
[Music]
right boy standing still
[Music]
car just just press the
accelerator and get
[Music]
going
the Dy was be days from that
Collision yeah I keep Los like I know I
crash before but why am I still losing
these things to
[Music]
this really am not good at driving
through that tunnel am
I
okay back to the Finish
[Music]
Line let sa
distance
[Music]
350
450
550
650 yeah we
see
my only chance right now is if the
leader crashes yeah lead cross finish L
there the only the only chance I have
now is that the lead crashes and
I P anything
by
yeah
well I went to see where I went who
knows kind of forgot about that
corner
oh well I guess that
right but fourth position in this
location I'm doing worse and worse and
now I'm coming fifth position as that
car has been here P
me that was probably
worst could say time
those wor being
wor the worst one I committed
to like the car bmed me and I lost
speed make
sense
nice of course the red
car responds onto the road ahead of me
what a she
there although I do have a suspicion
that's an intentional design not as me
as a cheat
but in case the computer for some reason
gets Stu stuck or crashes or something
is therefore reset a bit further ahead
of the track so it doesn't get stuck at
the same location
again but it gets a bit awkward when you
crash together with the car that means
that the
computer get the computer so that means
that the computer resets ahead of you
compared to where you reset and I think
that's not too uncommon in
[Music]
games okay I need to
get
[Music]
iav that was been
neat still lost people on it but still
slower than leading here but it's pretty
neat look like like I think that was the
fastest i' oh and then I my stff there I
think that was the fastest I've gone
through that that pmo I still lost 200
M as usual so I'm not sure what I'm
supposed to
do it doesn't matter quickly I go
through the tunnel I always
[Music]
lose yeah
see manag to get 200 me ahead of
me
yep oh more heads without letting me
know in advance thank
you
[Music]
w
[Music]
no I'm so L
controlling
maybe I should switch car
again now I'm doing so
bad
so
bad well I got the fastest lap at
least okay let's
see train this car
then
know that's a day picture and it's night
I don't understand the
pictures pictures are
weird okay let's see how this
goes
okay that was a nice
bump let's
see that bump did help
me answer it over
W didn't tell me I was going to
play s why
is is supposed to tell me but just
doesn't second
pray
yellow car is not the
second because I'm the yellow car oh I
lost
that I'm not sure if the game uses dup
Kate cars or
not the leading car is the blue car I
think I only St the car didn't exct what
tell tell what C was a swort in the
distance as bad as as it's
[Music]
been
hey h annoying the car pushed me off and
then
that
car is of
course still ahead of me so I still have
to pass the car and
then well who knows how direction is
going
bup here lost
my far ahead is Le
now that's far ahead why is it such a
difference between the second first and
second CS
lead it is so much better than one
otheres I just want to complete this
game so I can feel
satisfied
I can finally complete this childhood
game it
pumped
well oh I'm
bumping than
go
now I just need to pass the second place
car then I'll get revealed how far ahead
in need is which is probably going to
be I want bom the edge of the stocking
line losing
everything they don't make it easy
no that was a nice drone shot with the
other
drivers like like I getting bumped by a
vehicle and I got go flying I mean I
was I went flying because I went up the
side of the road but I
was strongly
powerfully pushed to the side by
that that's totally how it's expressed
like strongly
powerfully
some fourth place this is
terrible I remember when I was in second
position like after the St I got in
second decision just chase the first
play first
driver I want to get back to
that and went off the
track and last place can
I increase the acceleration a bit
more
behind
yeah I am performing worse and worse for
every
attempt there's not happing getting
bumped by the oh the
car
oh
second place car is great the
tunnel look like this second place car
is faster
than
than like if I go back to the
other
which I guess is the car that is
replacing the yellow
car somehow somehow went
better obviously the to left the car is
doesn't necessarily mean it's
better in general it is
but
yeah definitely go better with this
car I'm definitely closer to the second
Place second place
here po girl found a
star
what I I bumped the yellow car straight
into the pillar
and I mean sure the I
bro hey why did you steal my dress red
and don't you come here and be blushing
you're you're the one who stole the
dress how dare
you
now now you're
sming Thief see now I have I have a
swimsuit
instead swing oh
you since it still have an interesting
texture to
them a liable
texture for the P for the flashy I do
want her to come with a swim
seat that's a sign of the swim
seat and uh it should be an actual swim
seat TCH like
ex de sign up
[Music]
the being
WI
I am catching up
now the say has a scraping ins side
of Mountain Cliff side
there
only is open
road they like to say scraping the
car
nice
and as far as I know there's no damage
in this game there's only visal damage
but
no doesn't affect the performance of the
car crash as much as I
want obviously I'm TR
to
quite a
difficult need to catch up
it like this this St doubles after pass
that
time and then I'm I seeing everything
I'm not too
far we're not too far from winning this
race it's just
that I just can't keep C
the the only thing I can hope for is e
start Le
crashes
as soon as I bump them it start breaking
we supposed to go forward it's are
raed everyone is against me
like oh you bumping me do you want to go
quicker let me
break slow you
down it's like people road racing
traffic
they in such a hurry try to weave
through traffic traffic traffic and get
annoy that you're in the way then they
manag to get around you and then they
start going in front of you and start
breaking to slow me down like weren't
you in a
hurry why do you have time to slow me
down I never had that happening real
life see don't you and and and the
question comments is always like if the
car is in such a hurry why do have time
to do this kind of
stuff I'm asking cars in this game just
say like we we are race here why why are
you
breaking in the middle of a just because
I touched the back side of a car you
don't need to
break sure you slow me down but you slow
yourself down
F that's another W
in am I catching up okay I
yeah think that wasn't too
terrible
if I just do this next section section
well
enough I did so well and then I
bumped and I
[Music]
B waa what happened there just random
crash on
something
[Music]
no
[Music]
W and I see I don't I can't confirm that
the Sparks there in the distance were my
car scraping on the ground if it was I
was reset very far back which
like
that's that's I think
it could be a upper hand was scraping
something as well
[Music]
sure
because
[Music]
so
oh why does bumping a car make me spin
but just for like
nothing maybe my car is much
guys
only four races left and then I'm
[Music]
done that was an interesting way
of I hope like mono is the
harder like hard than nor way which is
the other one I have do and then I have
the easy track to do then after
[Music]
this so after doing those these the
remaining three tracks are
please
see by the way I will have unlocked
three more cars so
let's
see
no come on get off the cliff
side
still have a chance
here w w don't have much control there
all right that was that would
was as well as before I've done that
much
better
I don't know I'm
doing why why I'm doing keep doing that
now I done that every every every race
now
must keep more to
left that don't trying
me
no don't steal my
clothes
red I need my
clothes how dare you
[Music]
I'm getting
distracted like of
those soon sit
back I'm sure you love it I guess I
guess there was some hearts there too
the secret
heart
he steal my clothes because he love
me
okay then is the segment with
the pass and then going through the
town oh
no did not do that good I bumped the
side and then I bumped another side
I didn't lose much of that okay now it
jumps up in
distance so that's what we say here no
reason yes the silly
prank get pranked P fun now you're in
your
underwear how
silly yeah the only thing I can help for
start the leading car crashes and then I
can I'm not good enough to R
something the Le can crash whenever or
not crash at on
so sport now you get B tmy
without looking at my under
way
[Music]
go that wasn't the perfect not perfect
Corner anything it
worked
we
[Music]
go like how that
place well
car
pass twice as far from Le I usually
am why am I bad taking that corner
now what so good I think before I was
just sliding through that
corner
[Music]
not that's really not a very good way of
think that one because I lose whole
speed
[Music]
[Music]
cons
[Music]
well it said can only wish for the car
crash my opportun to
win I
crash that's what I need leader to do
just bumped me kill her or
something it has
happened
okay that time the just flew off the
track
SW I thinking need bar
[Music]
finding oh and then I got pushed off the
track
[Music]
com from
[Music]
the cuz I'm staying for
place and my goal is to be second place
in that position in that location after
[Music]
that here we go start position it's
better perfect
yep it's a typ coring
there
there's the second place
car
well not the greatest coring but I felt
kind of forced to do that due to the
position of the other racing
at least I got ahead of it
so
it so I
[Music]
can look some catching up to the
lead okay to much
speed I think that's where I am
I
need you're also not gotting stuck on
the side of
[Music]
them
there it does help a
lot
[Music]
here
and
I completely forgot how I to that
corner I have to make a decision really
quickly and I'm not taking the right
decision PR PP wait what is that
PR Pro racer P okay that's what it
stands for I'm not too that Pro
Pro racer
PP
whoops
whoops
I got to head head put for a little bit
soon I should be
out head out for a little be feedback
soon okay
right good out
[Music]
heading I'm not having such good luck
with this
SK leave is not that far ahead uh
can fall
in see if I can do this one two
three there we go that's what I
want
now they after
two now I'm getting hang
[Music]
of
why
would why doesn't
what what can't I
change and now I can change camera angle
why didn't I why could
what what I can change camera
angle
he just decided to press Hey yesto My My
cloes I wasn't weighing that much to
begin my secret has been
revealed
sh sh off fun amazing Beauty sh your fun
cures now it's e
again it should
be you have the
tum are you not
satisfied
oh I mean was probably not going to be
thaton
any that did
not
I guess that
worked
yeah I'm not doing that when if this car
just passes through behind
me he just randomly press this button I
mean I paused it but then just press
[Music]
continue okay that was better I
[Music]
think
okay now it goes one one two
three oh
no I say it goes yeah that was
definitely my Sparks and I was reset
likees back 50 minutes
back I don't know what the scale of this
world
is
probably 20 minut back but
still I'm exaggerating a
bit rest is back no more Tommy
fore I'm stay well and then I
crashed com don't have well of steing
and I
crashed
nice not nice
but
[Music]
didn't get me
that much closer to the
[Music]
either
wow I got like 300 minutes
closer that was a
surprise wish I could
already cross
finish I change if I can why is he doing
that now if I
like could get that like that 300 me
closer while I'm am 2 me away that would
be
nice okay I actually got a good start
now
like now only like 100
away oh saw the spark oh look there's
leader see the leader for once haven't
seen a leader in probably an hour don't
know how long I've been working on
this this
stage call them tracks this
track
this
[Music]
layout get to
comment there's a leader I'm really
close now now I L speed uh pun racing
Super
Pawn
guys look at this car is just speeding
away new La record
actually actually managed to get first
in the first La that's I'm actually
amazed that I man
that
okay
don't bump
me let
[Music]
say he first position
here
well we go not like I'm trying to block
the computer from
passing I'm trying
to stay in the
P that might want to
take and
therefore the computer need to take the
less optimal route to cost me
and allow me to stay in the lead
I
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay I need to keep the lead
for the final part of the map which is
just not much left now on the
map just up the mountain here and then
finish
L and with
10050 and finish find up right there
there it is wa
wiish I did
it I finally did
it I got the fastest yeah I kind of have
to get the fastest left race time to
beat the computer in this
game time the
same I'll create a sa State as
well there you
go only this
one I did not get a new
car so I get so I I get this after one
of two tracks otherwise if is win all
three
tracks I'm never going to use
it the the amount of the amount of
tracks you have to win on before you re
unlock cars kind of
random all right let's see how this goes
then three tracks
remaining
the purle car is not doing that crazy
see he was doing yesterday every time
starting
r i kind of appreciate because he was he
was kind of getting in
way okay third
face like that wa thir
face that mean four face across the
purple and the Red Bar six minus two is
not
I might take it
but there is like where was one of the
cars probably miss that the
car oh at least everyone is close
together and then the car almost flipped
over and I'm in lost but everything's so
grouped together
since can still make
it
is
slippy all four cars I can gr
together kind of tricky to pass everyone
though
with
go
starting to back my own Mass while I'm
racing 6 - 2 is not three EAS
it okay I need to stop going up on the
sides of the track I barely have any
grip there
and okay I'm back hello R you miss that
I want to try I'm finally won on on that
track yeah and then there this part
no my
closeth is that what is that
your welcome back
red yes
chur welcome back thr s to welcome back
red
what do you want to
[Music]
Le no don't the wrong
way I wonder if it can increase the
acceleration more
I also need to take left where the drag
splits cuz that seems to be a better
option back it is quite the welcome
Jester
whoops just throw
off throwing off your
dress
let's try
that first for time yes it's very
appropriate it's sow
11 okay so it's the blue one that kind
of get stuck there I kind of miss that I
pass it's not the purple one how we this
time it's the blue one
F enough one less car to car
about
now anyone's
not is this part that tricks me because
I see the track going off to the right
there but that's not the track this is
clar
[Music]
off so I have been
thinking I might have said this
before um I don't know if I said it
before so for the 3D model so I'm making
every outfit but then when the outfit
switches out for another outfit I want
the previous outfit
to fall like so so the switching our
outfit is going to be
magic and so so with uh so the new
outfit is just instantly going to be put
on Pon but the previous out she is going
to fall off behind her
the uh engine for the 3 models does
support like objects just falling that's
a
problem but then I was thinking that if
you're switching from an outfit where
she was wearing underwear to an outfit
where she's no longer wearing out
underwear for example from the dress to
the
swimsuit alongside the out falling off
her underwear will also fall
off
you should have a dirty laundry basket
with outfits in I don't know how to put
that like P6 and stuff I don't bother
about that it should just be a basic
animation of the of just playing playing
the animation of it
[Music]
falling pre baked
animation I can manage that I just need
to
it just basically needs to uh create
your like in theory P You're
problematically cute what's the
problem programmatically cute let's go
with that oh no okay the purple car is
doing this thing again
okay look at the
speed
they accelerate that I wish I had that
[Music]
speed yeah basically just create an
object and have it play the animation
and after the animation is over it
done up here I should turn
and
ads at least the two chapters are not
affected by it but which is still not
letting you know when that starts Still
Still ANS
me with the new computer with the new
like two monitor set up I'm going to
have so I can see when ads are starting
so I can plan more around
it
we
go best time that I'm
not I think first time I tried to strike
I got best
start but yeah
I forgot turning left
here oh after all I want to make the uh
stream includes whatever
the people like the problem is that
you're
distract it's throwing off my clothes
while
driving that's more distracting to me
I'm just sitting there driving in my ass
with some cl's gone just my
underwe while there's a camera looking
at me while I'm sitting there
drying busy holding the staring wings I
can't myself
anyway
that's
the hey I guess the what I like is
to
sh a bit too
naughty I guess I need a private stream
on Discord
bonus outfits out of
me someone is into death idea I
see
new La
record can it give me at first place
it's
over no one know no one knows what I
talk about unless to back in the
RO and still forgetting to turn
that PP PS private p p pun K
[Music]
yes this time
trer car decided not to
crash AR doing that weird
[Music]
[Music]
turning I need to remember to turn left
up here keep forgetting about
it
red getting very
blushy Red's turning
[Music]
red and no I bumped that
tree okay the leader is not too far
away let's see if I can catch
up if I can catch
up track should wait where is the track
thing
again
this Nar
segment catching up to
snow not if I do
that
drive
way got the split SE segment is right
for the Finish L
here
keep doing that when I try
to new lamp
records
and then
left the lead is about the same distance
from me all the time oh there I see
leader which is a red car this time not
the
blue
a Green
Mountain how does that mountain stay so
green
[Music]
bit of a trouble catching up Le
but
not falling that far behind at
least
here wrong
way I don't think
so oh he L crashed this is my
opportunity still a whole lap left but
still
then I
crashed trying the track yeah I find I I
find it quite interesting how how
Umble invisible wallar in this
game
like I didn't actually think that that
you could drive on the the edges of
track like that cuz even getting up
there is very
hard nice hair
[Music]
time thank
you they bad I lost the first
place
GL Le just have the leader in my view at
least this track
is yeah I would say the first track of
Norway is easier than the first track
[Music]
of and considering the Monaco track had
the blue car as the leader and I don't
think the blue car is part of the
strength the new car is the final car on
know I think mon is man as a final track
you
play and I think I yeah I think I
unlocked mono
last I kind of did track in
the oh yeah the computer crash
again whoa
then I crash
[Music]
so yeah the this red carard is even win
or come second was an unfortunate
Crasher there in the
end I won
yay and I got the fastest La time and
the fastest race time
okay let's do uh safe State I do not do
safe States coming or whatever you call
it oh I do unlock it now let's try it
out where you use safe states to go
back I only use safe State as a form of
backup hello
mam
it's been a
while have you become a drift driver I'm
not trying to drift in this
game
this I'll try that probably have
second more to
left
what a
car
yeah we definitely have
to increase the top speed reduce the
acceleration there a
be not not by
much look at those textures
yeah today my first stream on Twitch
went terribly oh
no
something that didn't sound like
well
sometimes things don't go as he want
things to go I have had bad streams of
my
own
[Music]
um I need to change
this I think that was 100
steps is very fine tuning
I was playing the human
heart
lgb3 sure what human comes in today
but haven't heard about
it everyone has spr go car go go go
yeah I
think my
worst some of my bad
streams I think one of them
was the last crash bad stream I did when
I played the same LEL for 3 hours until
I end of the stream that was the worst
was that was one of the worst
stream no progress in the
game
worst another was when I wanted to play
Iron fish spent like an hour trying to
just fix the controls because the game
in because the game
like
pon pon R
time
H the bunny Idol PS
routine what's a bun idle p
r p p r time back in the
day when you control the
camera on PlayStation one if I'm going
to use uh yeah when you press to the
left the camera moved to the left and
looked more to the right
and when you press right the camera move
to the right looking more to
left I understand that not everyone
agrees that this is how the camera
should work but that is how I Vision
Envision the camera to work in third
person not first person but third
person uh and that's how a lot of game
works like that's the normal setting for
how a camera Works in
for example
in in Legend of Spyro the right stick
used to rotate camera I think it is and
that's and it allows you to invert the
camera controls but the normal controls
is just how I describe
them and I do agree that you should have
the option to in but at some point in
the
later somewhere between PlayStation 2
and like PlayStation 4
it's it became standard to invert the
camera
controls maybe to due to the popularity
of first person shooter on
consoles using the twin stick player
setup H
where amazing um so now you you press
left the camera goes to the right and
look more press left I can understand
understand why people want that and I'm
obviously not going to tell you how you
should have the
controls but that's not how I want the
controls but somehow that become the
normal controls
instead and the sil thing that
like that that SP R is using it so the
normal camera controls is the inverted
normal camera controls of Legend of
Spyro is the inverted camera controls of
Spyro ignited
and um but there are still a lot too
many games where you can't even change
the camera in inverted camera
settings for example I am fish which I I
new computers I can play um and I will
probably play start the whole game over
Compu
and that game do allow you Tok camera
up and down but not left and right and I
find that to be so strange why would you
only want to invert up and down and not
left and right why not have setting to
both like
Spiral just how I prefer that the camera
moves to the left when I press left and
see more to the right I want the camera
to move up when I press up to see more
down that's just
how just how I prefer the camera to
behave
[Music]
because because the thing is
that in a third person view I'm kind of
moving I'm moving the camera around I
around a fix fixed
point but uh that the camera is looking
at the fix point but the sorry I'm
ignoring all the comments but I'm going
through my
rant uh the camera is looking at a fixed
point and I'm moving the camera with the
stick that's uh that's how I missing it
but in a first person when I press left
I want to look more to the left but in
this case the camera isn't looking at a
fixed Point instead the camera is
rotating on a fix point so the camera
camera's rotation behaves differently
and I want it to behave differently this
is again a problem in Sp reunited
because it's when you set the camera
controls are inverted the first person
view also gets inverted so I have to
set to disable the inverted camera
controls when it goes to the first
person view in that game and then when
exiting the first person you have to set
invert controls again and the problem is
that in Spyro you can if you want to
going to like look around you that's the
first person view and it changes how the
camera looks around
and and yeah it's just
annoying
it's annoying I know I don't see any
games allow me to set the controls as I
want
it so anyway let's see what he wrote
about
oh yeah I don't I
don't yeah
mean that message is not going allow to
anyway sorry sorry let let me go back to
your messages here it's been f
25 people entered all at once and began
to offend all the other participants in
the Stream with whom I Community Call Me
Oh you mean yeah yeah you you got raided
by a lot of annoying people this is the
worst wor to me as far they
other I'm glad that I haven't had such
people but it might happen at some point
I hope you ban them H if you have the
more very commun
I wish there was still a confirmation
Banning but I think the best thing is
just to like scroll up the chat One Step
so it doesn't move and then just ban
everyone um it's a little Annoying to
ban 25 people
but yeah do you have any moderators in h
they they told me S thing there
yeah yeah and
it's
uh it's it's terrible that
people people act H like
that it's kind of surprising that people
still like act like that on Twitch
considering how open accepting twitch as
a platform is and how many how many
streamers are so open to LGBT is so
common but that they those people manag
to stick around like that they
aren't they you start to trigger
people and then your
comment you gave examples like I can
read it for you if you
want
like if you want I cannot approve it
because uh of all the things you wrote
in it I don't want those things to be
Pro approved I don't even have the
option to approve it for some reason I
I'm not going to
but is oh is it because it's too
old maybe maybe it's because it's over
five minutes now and I can no longer
it because obviously I don't want any
else to write those things this is only
1% of what they
told says here game got lot of having
C but and
yeah I do have although I guess my all
my moderators are actually not
stream yeah I don't have any moderators
but yeah that point
like as as soon as someone is out to
insult that's that's the directly
against the rules and that's an
immediate B it's just no no if if it's
like misund like I'm trying to think of
something just a disagreement of opinion
that's
fine obviously but if they is
insulting that's that's not okay that's
that's an immediate
ban I know I know I've been bad at
people at least s something
s yeah at that point it's
just pause the game B the people their
message should be deleted
[Music]
and still still annoying still
still I'm sorry if I'm not reacting in
correct way
um I'm not with motions and stuff like
that
yeah plus if I guess it also sa if some
of course you only said that that was
just a small part of what everyone
said I have not experienced that
myself
[Music]
um if people were to come in and say
things like
that I've already heard lot the not not
directly than me so may maybe it would
be different if it was direct than me I
mean I what the hell
like this account only follows man
something like that and follow me like
yeah I reported ban that account
immediately and that account was delet
CU it's it's just an account that there
to
R and then I did got a Follow by this
account on follow those
dbys and and that was more humorous than
insulting they might have intend an
insult but I don't
know probably because I like
[Music]
fan
of fortunate
[Music]
and I really hope you didn't manage to
ban
[Music]
everyone and twitch do try to uh
combat using upter backs and stuff that
[Music]
so I do hope you have like
I understand that auto modding isn't
always can it in the way sometimes but
at least set it to the least strict mode
in that case it should at least cover
like it did for
me uh I've s it to the least
strict think it's it's one of those
categories
that it flagged that should be the least
strict I say it's the most strict if for
when it comes to
misogyny but I don't think it's that
flagged any of that having it as the
most stre has
been guess that's some
tis terbly let's let's
and let's continue here like or School
third years's game got a lot of C for
having camera inverted really depends on
what you mean by
inverted what's inverted has been
different throughout the years which I
used to
explained because what is normal and
what is
inverted people call flight controls
when you push the stick forward to dive
that call calling that inverted but that
is normal pilot controls that's just how
pilot controls
work and that was the normal controls
and H like that was the de controls in
Crash 3 on play one as well as Spire in
play one SP reignited kept these
controls and does not allow you to
invert them which I do think is bad a
crash Trilogy however made the inverted
controls that is not pilot controls the
normal controls and had the pilot
controls in
being mared
second
Weir well I'm lying in bed now see if I
got sign up
prly fair enough Inver for what it was
what what what
what
I don't
like when when it comes to camera
controls or controls in general H as
aside from like movement if you
press because that's a thing people have
comment on
like oh you don't you want you want the
plane to go down when you press up so
you want to go left when you press right
no no no that's that's a complete misund
tting that's not how it works that
that's that's kind of a comment that
that just trying
to um not trying to understand at
[Music]
all I don't know what this is probably a
turn for that kind of
comment
but yeah person stick forward is just is
to meant to replicate pushing the stick
forward can can that stop
happening H in an actual
airplane and when you push the stick
forward you're leaning yourself forward
and you're dying and when I play people
play Spyro I try one of the examples I
do is like imagine if
Spyro is is placed like in his flying
posst preferably is laying on top of the
stick on the controller if you press the
stick forward his nose dips down he's
going to die that's how the controls
work that's why the controls are like
that I do still think they should have
the option to invert the controls but
there is a reason why the controls are
like they
are why they have been like that all
this time and anyone any company that
tries to invert this
like like the crash developer what they
called again H
vicarious yeah when they trying to be
when they try to invert the controls and
calling what is not normal
normal it's just causing
confusion but to be fair a lot of people
call it the inverted pess control normal
so maybe we should just call it pilot
controls and I don't know what call
itver controls is such a triv trivial
option and mechanic to make issu really
be yeah exactly H is such a triv scene
that I honestly don't
care
to make options so people can choose
them yeah yeah it's such yes fight
controls should have should have up down
invert
option as long as you can invert it it
doesn't really matter which is the
default I do still think the fin control
should be the default but as long as you
canver it it's
fine and then camera control should also
have the option to be inverted I do want
first person and third person to have
separate controls for inversion I don't
want them to be tied to the same
invert because
I because see um
yeah because if the if the camera is
looking I explain if the camera is is
looking at a point and I press down I
want the camera to move down it's still
looking at point if the camera is
instead rotating on a fix point on the
point on itself if I press down damage
out that's my
idea I wonder is there this probably
some game that set first set person
control
set
and I think when I mention iron
fish the
uh
obviously medium had a much worse stream
than I had by the way much worse I have
never had a scam that
bad might be gone
already
eh
I still making a
noise i' argue it should be a separate
option to make them SE Yeah the more you
can make them
separate more option you have but I want
to say maybe should too much options
like I like I there's no point of having
like what should the camera controls be
for every character now I can
fire but if it's like first person or
third person that at least that could be
separate yeah so you're going to say I
am fish as far as I know it did not have
any uh camera
controls uh settings and people said
that they really needs to been an option
to invert it and then they added
uh the y axis immersion but not x-axis
only added one of
them
we also have a second mode where you
kind
of use the sticks for each fin to swim
or something like I don't remember or
it's
like no wa it's I think it's more like
you press some buttons to move and then
you aim with
the anyway point
is in this mode they also doing the
their normal control is is you press up
to build the fish up which is fact
opposite of where the fish would
tilt if you place the fish on top of
this thing and there's no option to this
and people asked to have an option team
to but they never added have the
feature and and someone suggest I should
play Iron fish on Console which is also
available for console at least it run
smoothly but I would be able to handle
controls at least if I play on PC using
steam H I can change the controls which
is which is a great feature of steam I
can go in
and uh
invert the controls I can choose to
invert each axis if I want to which is
great so I
can
it's the deci side
controls but when you go to before you
go in and edit the controls you have
some quick settings for the controls and
one of the quick edits is to invert the
y- axis on the right stick which is I
guess a nice feature but again just the
y- axis why not the x axis axis why is
that not an option to Quick invert why
do I have to go into this that and
inverted I why it right I mean it's so
weird I assume it's for camera controls
but again just the why
exist so many Weir decision companies
make more
[Music]
time
[Music]
I'm not going to win this
[Music]
race too far from Le compared to Mar
where was
like8
away that was just twoo
[Music]
s when I was young and play this game I
didn't see the com the com
the decimal point this is decimal Mark
there as a decimal mark because it's
period That's not the format
Sweden that was reading is 2
km 3 km that's not exactly what it
means
and I guess whoa and
rest can I maybe I can
there go one more
try Mouse acceleration is
Notting
it's calling it Mouse acceleration I
think as a
SN but as I was going to say even though
you can every other language in the uh
list of languages for this game German
French Spanish and Italian are using
comma as the decimal
Mark H but switching to those langage
does not change
e failing localization there's a lot of
games that fails
localization localization is
when it comes to daytime number and more
for like that that's something games are
so
terrible this game can't even right
kilometers per hour
correctly um yeah it's it's Mouse
acceleration which I me no at least the
functional Windows is not a mouse
acceleration it is when you move the
mouse
slowly and the it it's Comm convered to
a slow speed but if you move move the
mouse quickly it's converted to a quick
speed it is not accelerating it's just
that it's it's
uh instead of yours instead of your
movement is
linearly instead
of
yeah so if you want to do move you do
precise movement you do move M slow but
if you want quickly to move over
something you do a quick motion and the
mouse will move
further over this over the same
distance to you move
slower I don't know what you would call
it on I don't it's not like I have a
better name the mouse acceleration but I
think that's a it's not like as you move
the mouse it's not accelerating that's
not what it's doing
my problem with it is that it does not
move the mouse by distance yeah I mean
if you don't like it you can save
it I I mean I like it because I I like
the idea of being able to move the mouse
a little
and have it do precise movement and I
can move it fast and
have a quick and
far movements without having to move the
mouse
far but that that's the that's the great
thing about having the option we both we
both have the option to choose what we
prefer and Games should just read the
input value from Windows I
guess the
allways not
always I mean
I mean I guess I guess you could okay to
be fair yes I guess to be fair you could
argue
that you want to have
a what should it even be
called Mouse
Precision what it what
it
what is it called in
Swedish
H here we go it's called improve the
pointer Precision that seems to be much
better term cuz that's that's what it's
doing
it's
uh that's that's like what is the point
is of
it when you move it slowly you get more
precision
pointer Precision but yeah I can
understand having that
option enabled for when you just use it
as a
pointer but if you for example using it
for a first person shooter and using for
aiming that you don't want to
have that's a good point
though
um
call
mation cuz I think I've heard
someone tell me that they don't like
Mouse experation because they don't want
to have the mouse they try to explain
how they don't want that Mouse go go
slower and go
quicker as they are
moving uh the same speed of the mouse I
don't don't know exactly remember how to
explain it
but that's not what most explation is
but I mean at least it's not what
Windows has if some game has is reading
the raw data from the mouse and kind of
implements its
own for M acceleration I can understand
the issue with that
um
oops go go go go
go go go go yes I'm in the
lead uh so but if you never want that
function you should be able to
completely dis the windows but I can
understand if games are read but are
games even reading the
H this an interesting
point also I have big enough M it does
not help me at
all I mean
so I mean if you okay
so so
well then
computer H well disable it in Windows
Mouse
settings and then
uh games that just simply read Windows
Mouse position for each position should
therefore reflect this but if some games
read the raw data from the mouse itself
which I would would guess some games do
H it should not be affected by this
setting and if they have some form
of touch mode it's built into the game
itself and in that case I could agree
with you that should be a second
point
but if it's only read the raw Mouse
position for Windows the game can't
really have a set for
anymore and
just blue c came me
now and let's
see I honestly don't know where you need
get the mouse Mo
okay yeah that's a good question
if you yeah if you're using
Unity if it if it reach the windows yeah
game engines speak speaking of
inputs has some issues
too but um if it with the windows CS
positions and use that as input in that
case you change the Windows settings to
fix that
issue and and if it does Notre the raw
information from the mouse regardless of
window setting of of what actual
position of the windows mon character
is H and you still have that function
enabled regardless what the window
settings set to then Unity has its own
builing
function or your bouse has such buing
function that could also be a
possibility
oh so
close so
close I'm I'm customing
this say when it comes to input when it
comes to keyboard input when it comes to
like okay I can't say unit for I can't
exactly say it's true for
uh uh unreal either but what
these the engines really should do is
read the scan codes of the keyboard keys
not the
input not like the
letters for that yeah because for that's
was thing I tested I I set my I have the
keyboard to set to Swedish because
that's just Community Ty Swedish I can
yeah which is the same layout as the
Finish
layout but it's possible that you don't
use the Finish
layout if you're
programming even though I have no
problem programming this using the
layout
anyway if I press this Swedish
letters they show up as Swedish letters
in the
game in spiral which is using the
unre and then when I switch to the
Danish layouts which is using the Danish
letters
whoa last time now I had CLE
St uh the uh like one of the keyw works
but not the other and the was reading
them of what the actual letter was
rather
than
yeah
that's what what it really should do is
using the scanning
codes because regardless if you get
uh most keyb which are quirky or a
German or like central European keyb
that are
qus or if you get a fren
aeri or even a Turkish F which I don't
know what the letter word of that
is but it's called a Turkish F because
the first the Q position is the letter
F uh regardless of which keyboard you
get the scanning codes are still the
same
gon codes represent the actual physical
position of the key and what the
termines what you get when you press a
key on your keyboard is which layout you
have chosen on your computer that's
nothing to do with your physical
keyboard unless you're using a special
keyboard that might do this but most
keyboards don't most keyboards you press
the key the keyboard tells the computer
what scanning code was pressed and then
the computer using the layout to
determines with see what it outputs
Games should use the scanning codes
because it should then use if you want
to W ASD as your
input and it should use the scanning
codes for those four Keys then it
doesn't matter if the person is using a
French AER the keyboard it's still going
to work just
fine
because because you have defined the
four physical positions of
p and
when when a player changes the layout
like not change when a player Chang the
key binds in the game there we
go and and then press a key that they
want to bind an action to the game
should read the scanning code of the key
press and save the scanning code
and to determine which action the player
wants to do as the player presses the
keyboard it should only read the
scanning
codes or scan codes I'm calling scan
codes scan codes scan codes
yes that's what the game should
do I very
very I would say that would be the
objectively correct method of doing it
so if someone has a counter argument I
would like to hear
it
but I don't see why game shouldn't do
that I mean unless you using like a
typing
game but that's a special case if we're
talking about most types of games where
you WD for moving the character using
like q& e for actions and the buttons
above there for other actions f as
well use scan scan codes for those
and uh of course you need you need to be
able to tell the player which key to
press on in that case which
Windows should have a support
for then for the given layout chosen
what H you ask Windows like what what is
the symbol for this scan code and then
you tell the player to press on that
symbol and here we go
we should hly standardize two part keyw
I don't sure what you
mean but I understand if developers
using Unity unreal or other gaming game
engines can't do this and because these
game engines were not developed with
this in mind in my for what I've
experienced I have
not been able to fully
developed in those myself but testing
around it it might be possible but
developers are using
[Music]
it but it really should be a
standard key keyboards there are being a
lot of different keyboard layout fine
itself it's just that when it comes to
games they should rely on scan codes
most of the
time with with few
exceptions have from H togs left portion
of the keyboard and H right and non pad
somewhere like left side of left I'm not
sure what
now and I have the different portion
as what why you you confused me
now
my keyboard comes in h three
parts a keyboard layer comes into three
like there's three parts of a keyboard
stand of the keyboard layout
stand have the two sections as separate
as you your mouse is from
your
swim hello for like the
swims do you want like a keyboard split
in half I think there are s keyboards
like
that got the keep off yeah there are
I've seen at least keyboards that has a
split in the middle and then you can
like angle it but there must certainly
keyboards that are completely split in
half yeah it I could see it be
convenient to just not have the right
half of the keyboard and as you said
yeah I have the number pad to the left
of the
wsd and then so you can so you don't
have a large keyboard between your left
hand and Mouse
hands I can I yeah um
oh come
on what so close to winning race still
close probably won't
win the now the Finish oh I was so close
to Wi but
now R over restart
oh when I am playing I could take the
right side somewhere else so it's
not yeah and when I need the rights then
I can put the right side M yeah like
yeah so you like split it up move the
way when gaming and then when you're
done gaming can put it back but you can
still like keep it on the right side of
the mouse so in case you need to type
you can
move move your hand from the mouse to
the to the right of the mouse where you
have the rest of keyboard
inside it's something to get used to I
guess but it would be more convenient to
game I can I can see
that
that would be nice an
option
nice yeah and then you just switch
position of the right half and mouse
when you're using
computer outside of
[Music]
thing
or like half your idea where you have
the number pad to the left side of the
keyboard instead of the right side that
so you still have the full
keyboard but the distance
from the wsd is closer to the
mouse not by much but slightly
closer
still not in fresh
place oh ads why doesn't it tell me
about the
ads and also right things since your
writing pure would not be as inter as
it's with now standard keybo yeah that's
that's the idea with the
uh split that you can just
angle attach to the top which would be
where the two halfs are connected to
each
other but if if they completely separate
there but they still in a cable between
each other
somewhere I just need to catch up
with they could they could have two
completely separate uh cables with two
separate USB ports connecting as two
separate keyboards because when it comes
to Windows doesn't matter how many
keyboards you plug into it unless you
have a special keyboard but if you just
plug in regular keyboards and the
keyboards all act as the same
keyboard which can be annoying that
because you cannot set different bards
for keyboard it would be nice to have
like for what like programmers
want programmer layout I
still that's a whole top I
like yeah programming layout
but the uh way and then to pick
the the US layout which I find to be
such a weird
layout to be fair I mean it really
really to me it really appears as
a as
a programing lout it's it's this made by
a
programmer it is not an everyday
keyboard like why would you have a
dedicated key for semi like why is
semicon the unshifted key and colon is
the shifted key that's so
weird and then having dedicated keys for
the the square brackets and curly
brackets is
definitely the made by a
[Music]
developer most everyday people will
never press on those keys and it's such
a waste of keys for like everyday use
and standard as a programming layout but
like an everyday layout for just regular
typing the uh the brackets keys and his
semic colon key
are so
unused and the Swedish keyboard
basically puts these three Swedish
additional letters there so they're not
really taking up much space because was
free space already
P pun rant about key keyboards are
sometimes weird and Implement
implementation of keyboards is a weird
Sor I need to oh and the I see the bot
doesn't even reply good thing I don't
have any heads yeah you have your
subscriber and on my board moving
n n pad yeah to left it would add 8 cm
distance between
us or you could have the main board have
USB port for second
yeah so you have keyboard split two
separate USB
ports
socket USB cabl H so they are act they
are basically two separate
keyboards because in Windows Windows
does not distinguish separate keyboards
from each other
anyway there you
go and maybe because it's only half a
keyboard that each keyboard has to
consider maybe you can even make the
keyboard have fter response rates and
stuff I don't know I I don't know about
the keyboard Hardware that that
much
but because has half the keys I can see
some improvements in
like communication between it and the
computer okay time to win this
race and then I only have a single race
left to
do and I've been going for four
hours it didn't much I think I like 5 to
six hours
sometime talking random stuff talking
about
keyboards there's a problem with a lot
of developers that they develop to make
make sure it works for that keyboard and
then they're happy they don't consider
the V by by variety of keyboards and
then people comment like can't everybody
use the same keyboard no that's not
going to
work you can't
really the I'm always crashing at the
end I I do I do find there in that those
corners of lap one and two but when it
comes the third lap and just I'm just
crashing there and then the car passes
me and that's how I lost every s race
everything
race
yeah we walk
away
pon pon goes upside
down oh no I'm on my back and
defenseless what should I
do
take fun
F okay that's what they
[Music]
do I guess
the
apparently easiest way to make a Pon
Clash happen would be to have a
Kickstarter they have like a tier is buy
one flash for this amount of money
finding a company that is willing to
produce and then have to decide how many
fles to make how much it will cost per
FLH and that would be the tier cost for
the tier for
FL
if you want the
FLH plus plus
[Music]
sh here we
[Music]
go
here well now I trash for a different
reason get out of the
[Music]
way
oh the blue car crashed as
well okay now the order of cars is
really
weird red red is the usually the first
AI blue is the second AI they still in
that over there but the white which
would be the thiri is in first now it's
the
first doesn't really matter much
but I think that was the could be it
wouldn't matter Like A
Champion would benefit
me but yeah that's basic that was
basically my idea for
[Music]
how
to oh oh oh the car get such a lift
after just touching a bit s
um
for finance that's the word I was
looking for finance the pon plush
making I wonder what company could make
a p plush like
that should look good I mean it's still
a plushy so he's not going perfect
but it be of high quality enough to last
for a while long
one and it wants to come with a
The Outfits so you can change your
clothes which is the most important
feature with the p Pon
fing CU that's like
the feature of my
[Music]
screen and also the P should be
be like 140 cm tall I think could be and
nice nice hugable
height oh now I'm starting to get a nice
lead over second car
oh dress is
back
oh that was a nice
flip landed back on the
wheel thought there was S I was going to
lose the race there
but that was a nice uncontrolled
recovery he still inside the T they try
the tries to make it not snow on the
inside it's not perfect but well
it a too quick
there
now I went off
there W blue car is
quick
[Music]
[Music]
yeah oh oh no I got to be the lift up
there
too going to try to rush it to get get I
see
I still messed it up close to I messed
up early this time but I still messing
it up where I can reach
the win the race I thought I was going
to win the race that time
but
go
[Music]
any
Goodbye
Oh take the
car now the order is mixed up
again so close to wi we need close so
close to get first place there when
everyone
crashed there a sliding W place oh
someone Dr in the
snow hey feels like someone's pushing
me no what what's with that snow I just
I mean sure I had quite speed but it's
touching still and his flyer flying out
into
space
something's weird with that snow
there something's weird with physics of
this
game imagine driving and then your wheel
gets into the snow and then you just the
car just moves up instead of
forward that's that would
be
that would be
unfortunate we're ready for the landing
after
that here comes
the
turn here comes there
go nice did not get C to LIF off the
ground bom
fence they just
finish special Forest
what this
now there are just finished special
forces in
oh now I see Special Forces
yes know this is Norway supposed to be
Norway those Finnish forces has invaded
Norway is at least a finish Norwegian
wor
face this isn't
good I
need here we go
150 M
car
[Music]
game oh
bump bump the rock wall no problem there
so got down to 50 m there
but yeah I can't mess it up
[Music]
there a good distance from
[Music]
him no no
oh oh okay actually missed that up proba
on
okay
I might not have a chance to win this
race this point I might just restart it
maybe I shouldn't end it like the third
left and the third position might not
have a chance to
[Music]
Wi okay everyone can't
crash well I guess crashed into
me I got past
them
oh here we
go nice B second
position
that was just siling second position 50
minutes to next car and then I just got
stuck on the side of
this F
[Music]
this
[Music]
out of my
way okay second
position back back to this
again time to not drive on the side of
the snow
one
who
there's the car come here car I want to
pass you
yes that was a weird
gey come here a car I'm so
close
come
here don't be so
[Music]
fast
no I was going too fast down
[Music]
is as I tried to follow the road I just
felt that
way started
sliding and the
corners go
nice someone
crashed
here we
go def the new lap record
nice I think have bu bar at this track
now just keep the
lead I would like to try using these
cars on me
first
races on the r for
example that should be an unlock after
winning all
Races any car on any
track and
also being able
to have a force variant where all the
roads are
open
can't dri around the
explore that could be added for a C3
racing
remake
North American C Racing hardcore
TR the same locations
but North America United States most
specifically
that'll be
quy okay final left
now now to Dr
properly
point which is nice don't have to worry
too
[Music]
much
[Music]
all I see is
a sky of white no Road SE
[Music]
Co other the side of the hill was just a
wooden fence keeping here from falling
out not going to do much if you go there
high
speed
oh I mean I being being bit more careful
I would explain why the part behind has
been able to cash
up
so no
come
on try to be
careful and then
still flying off the road and getting
stuck and then careful through these
corners
this look at that
perfect there we go this is finally I
win
wa
finally after many
attempts I did win
it
celebration slap time yeah considering
how many times I had to redo it
there we go save
States from here just in case oh look uh
buildings on the
coast last
race it's still going to be winter when
the picture is not in
Winter there there's a UK picture in the
winter but that was not the winter that
was a Norway picture not in the winter
and
it's in
win and
night
Norway only
definitely
so and then also picture is doing day
even though it's night least like make
the sky black with stars in it to
signifies the night just still have like
a bright picture of the Beery as if
there's a light photography or
something just random photos taken
unrelated to the
track and I doubt this were taking 40
gam itself they
were or stock photos or
something next
thing next thing to do in the remake
finding what stock photos
are and incorporating the stock photo
into the track
itself and then taking the picture off
the track H to use as the
picture
okay my plans for remake
C3 I still still have the silly physics
of the game because that's like the
charm of game
so
yeah I don't believe I've ever in my
life
used you been driving on this gra
surpris how well it
does r in second place but still wa gu
I've never seen that before come on
Drive why you standing still
REM a bit of room which I think all
three Ro tracks for doing the
night that's
another that's another thing for remake
you should be able to use custom RAC and
choose night day rain
snow
now let's restart that was just the warm
up to get not
track whoa you attacking there all of a
sudden
whoops someone crashed and was in the
middle of the road like that
dangerous
and if it's not like a night track like
this par need to be reflecting and sign
that should yeah there there's quite a
lack of
[Music]
signs that's what the games missing
signs of side of the
shrift
location accurate
science a bit
[Music]
more I'm slowly catching up there we go
there's C
oh St
leading to sexy bar are definitely
missing there's a redeem TC sexy
[Music]
B 30
[Music]
seconds spending all your points on that
[Music]
one ah forgot about
that
I wonder what this quick is really go
full speed into the the wall and then
speed away or slow down and
then see more aspects to the
game I guess the game needs to be more
punishing if you uh H don't one
or go off the
track so you watch you to follow the
track and St down I
guess
thanks
oh come
on come on I still need to catch up and
Le still not
fully I have to
track how it
works
like at some point here yeah there's the
water
[Music]
for don't see these
curves
which is Ben
C then comes a Shar
Corner waterfall it's quite a long
track like that n
Passage
and go through that tunnel and
then
point
oh c up like half way but and then there
was that corner okay I'm starting to get
more used to track
but I I still have
uh still not fully e to
it D oh okay that was just
rude warning signs for sexy
bunny
that was car was just going along the
edge and crashed all the
way let tell the sparks
flying
oh then this is a Shar
com and also
the it's a final final race of the game
it's quite a long
num
guess the next challenge is to beat
every best time that's not l a challenge
this
now
doing this a bit more
carefully it's still BM to same I was it
going so
slow
my
clothes what did you do of my my
dress not getting
distracted my dress just
evaporated right here as I'm sitting
here oh
no ah good CH is back no more
way
[Music]
going down like 50 I still
SL I mean in real life I guess it's fast
B
I do Wonder should could I be able to do
that using these tires which these cars
should be
using
oh
no
sorry not
me come on
Cor
car leing whole first left and then you
just come here
and me like
this
whoa whoa
whoa
what what happened all of a sudden it
just did some random inputs
again wasn't even even not even touching
the de
time I'm going to lose the race due to
that again I have no idea what it's
doing
that
thought that was because I resting my S
over the face buttons that I actually
press one of the buttons but no I wasn't
even close to me guess you press dpad to
change the
lights oh car is driving on the side of
the mountain I wasn't even not even
touching the
dad using the stick to
turn no idea why that one was starting
to PR
there go
oops
not perfect pass but uh I lost
it now go yeah they B that was
better track this
time going to go past the that bit of
bumping one came with some
[Music]
bumping car very close
behind
[Music]
look car is still very close behind
still a bit
[Music]
scary
no bouncing between
the clip
[Music]
sides BP side pump the side
[Music]

oops this part part of the track I'm a
bit unsure
about it's just go that's like what

[Music]
celebration
tiny
[Music]
pixelated
Ser I never show anyone congratulations

W I unlock anything from that or is this
not arcade mode
complete I think that would be I mean
sure I didn't complete
the championship mod but I don't think I
have
p p p
p
p i like these first tracks I have not
got the fastest time
some because I didn't have
[Laughter]
the probably not not yeah but anyway
check mark
[Music]
everywhere
who yeah nothing special
here anyway that's
that game has been 100%
complete because doing Championship mode
is BAS basically the same
thing I was say Championship mode is the
E I don't know if you can start in champ
mode because that would make it easier
because all you have to do is
get the most point oh de mode but
yeah oh yeah I don't I've been streaming
for
almost 5
hours so how
about
we go and visit
someone stream we can
get
byway to end end off the stream now
so
I know someone we
can because someone is having
deat the
B someone you might I don't know if any
you
recom let's see if I can read
[Music]
Because let's see how the ra
works I don't think this command works
though yeah it does work not sure why
the other one didn't work
maybe I made a TI anyway H Luna Emory I
