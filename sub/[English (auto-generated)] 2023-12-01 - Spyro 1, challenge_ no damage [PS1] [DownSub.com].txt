whoa oh where did I left off hello red

licking fun licking chat uh uh

what

and love hearts and everything is nice

every the name doesn't really mean

much I thought that I liked video games

so something about games

controller and then I picked a word

that's sounded interesting which is was

jar will jar be on the high up on the

list of interesting

words oh sorry I I forgot got like 10

minutes and I still didn't start

uping let me start up the software so

you can actually change the outfits

because that is a very very

important feature on my

stream

oh I was going to say haven't I streamed

for month that's not

true I been tracking whoever get got

first I've got I forgot to list November

is November that was mine okay now it's

done

this wasn't why isn't loging come on log

in anyway let's go back to the game

once so the goal

here is for me to not take damage I will

defeat asor and then I will go back and

do 100% I guess anyway

the starting up there you go now you

might be able to roll oh it's been

peaceful here in the five worlds or yeah

let's let's not go through all the eys

that going to take forever here we go

it's

working oh I like that transition thank

you I didn't make that myself took a lot

of effort and I'm not completely

satisfied with

it let's go no damage so

far I miss that place some thank you for

releasing me now we hear it every time I

start a new game PlayStation

display I think I did

it wait what did you do find dragons

first that's all I can tell you uh no p

p in this version of spider no yeah this

is Playstation One

version oh yeah yeah your pronoun will

likely show

up to save on so it doesn't have to Ping

the server every time it only updates

occasionally

and the server doesn't really tell when

a pronoun has

changed but it will eventually show

up oh SP one from8 I haven't played oral

in a long

time Spar spark Health cannot go

below wait that's not skip button this

is a skip button where Nast North

anyway bu tmy yes that's this SP for

bammy let's let's increase the challenge

by saying that I cannot

fail a

flight I don't know if that's a good

idea or

not but let's

start H as S I did the pronouncing

but it's just like how it sounded most

people know call me whiskers is I've

been calling myself [ __ ] whiskers as

a well it would be confusing if I call

you whiskers considering you have not

that as part feeling I do prefer but for

my sake and other the people that to

only

use a nickname that is actually part of

the

username otherwise it becomes

confusing

[Music]

and I will not be able to remember

it come here why is everyone is moving

away from me why they fly inside each

other okay there's another one here

where are you there you

are I think I missed a

train that's not

good probably going to fail

this

well but yeah just okay yes uh just wait

a moment and you'll see it show

up wow I got distracted by aut mod Auto

mod

everything how dare you what

mod P

P welcome P Al

welcome

I to technically uh flight levels in

Spyro are like

[Music]

um you should be able to skip

this there we

go are like bonus levels in Crash where

you don't

lose you you it doesn't count as dying

or taking

damage well in CR you actually L your

mask

though but I kind of messed up I need

that was the warm up okay now now it's

the re why does he he has six toes by

the

way my favorite is Spire 2 R

rage do you like it more than Spire 2

Gate way to

glimmer my

favorite is sp one thank you for

releasing me SP dragons in The Artisan

world then

that was a joke because season of ice is

probably the worst Fire game I've played

people say that fire Fusion or Spire

orange if you

like

eh but is the worst SP game but I

disagree season of ice to me is the

worst I like SP one because of uh mostly

Nostalgia but I do I do feel like

because of the restriction for going to

the next World Is Not based on

completing every single level you can

make interesting challenges in the

game which I like

more do you do you like Stitch you

mean stitch in L

Stitch it's an interesting

character

interesting

fell okay the trains are

slower in this than in

reignited might be specifically this

version I'm

playing oh no I'm missing a train all

right keep I keep forgetting that that's

what the error I did last

time

and the barrels are so

tiny now I'm just messing everything

up little baby

barels

I it's easier to read chat while I'm not

doing like a time

trial that was the mistake I did last

time I looked at chat and fell into the

water just one moment of not paying

attention in was game

over okay let

me since I'm since I'm doing this

correctly now

well and of course if there's

any any problem with the stream do let

me

know I do know that

people

might not always say when his problems

with the

stream me intentionally adding some

problem with the stream just to see if

people

say there you go I did it first attempt

since starting this

run so sorry sorry back back to sh you

can go with jar I can call you jar good

it was controller over jar this level

was a pain in the butt

nah it's my favorite flight

level because you can do it in so many

ways even though I only do it in one

way let me just cross this water back to

the

chat uh does dying count as damage

definitely is there aside from yeah

there is Insta insta kill water and

falling off level that's taking damage I

can't this taking

damage maybe I should clear and I and I

will not like let spark die so if I take

damage I instantly die or

something

because then I don't have anyone

collecting the

gems apparently I'm

missing let's clear out this area some

people like to do

that but I will I try to avoid levels

that I where there's a high risk of

taking

damage like this

level H sorry I I think I beat that

flying level as pon pon o pon pon is a

good

flyer I always be that

now my favor is by one because tin Bell

is for

itated that's a that's an interesting

reason where have I not been in

here and um you should play more PS1 I

played a lot of PS1 games you should be

around

here I mean I do have a list on um my

Discord server with a list of games I

should play I should maybe have a list

of games I have played I can I do have a

list but maybe I should make it

available on Discord somehow format it

nicely or something

let's pick up

those I realized I should have done it

from

here

um yes blue KOA

what it's funny cuz at this point I just

keep changing what kind of animal I am

with the stupid stuff I make up with my

friends

are you talking about what animal I'm a

I'm a bunny a white bunny but I think

everyone knew that wait I'm missing

something is everyone an animal

here there

are quite a

few animal oh wait there there they

are quite a few people here who I either

have like a Persona or they have a Mas

mascot mascot

mascot

um I recommend playing R search forare

it was my favorite PS1

game I did watch some episodes oh right

I never been in here of

regrets

when is it like I thought when you runs

or maybe ah we go 100 out of I see this

when you charge a thing the the gem

starts following you but if you stop

charging the gem stops following

you I should be able to do this without

taking damage oh you cannot jump into

the

portals what did you only get oh because

picked up four gems before I ENT the

flight

level

oh yeah my pronoun is showing up now

whoa good thing you can't do

that as long as I can charge enemies

it's

easy um but yes nice that you pronoun

Shing

up for anyone else wanting this yeah

exactly when it stop Shing that's when

it

stops when you free a

dragon

hello Po Girl everyone is here it's a

whole party

bunny hello Chris I did see you today

chis oh somewhere

[Music]

else CH I look how are you wait is it

let

me yeah

you're yeah I think I think you been

have

fting the lari

emotes did nice lari

emotes part

modes what about the Stitch PS1 game is

a

CR

yeah I've been thinking about playing

through like every Disney

[Music]

game that could be

interesting my other favorite Spyro game

is Spyro enter the dragonfly on

PS2 I want to play it but it doesn't

work on either of my PS3s one of them is

running game in one hardware and

one one runs it on

software the one running out on Hardware

or it's like semi software it's like

it's a software Hardware hybrid I don't

know what son did with that

console on the on the the hardware runs

the game

quicker but the hardware but then the

game

crashes the software at least is stable

but it runs

slower neither runs it full speed so I

probably have to emulate it on my

computer on a new computer that can

handle it which kind of silly I cannot

play it on genuine

Hardware I mean sure I'm not playing it

on a PS2 but PS3 should be able to

running instead of being an animal can I

be a cons instead I mean you can

be you can be summer Dr asil which is

totally not the mod for fire reignited I

want to

do

[Music]

dead I run past it

um how is hot SN am I am I hot snack I a

hot snack to you anyway this is how far

I got

5%

technically so technically it should be

based on how many dragons I'm freed so I

got like seven out of 10 of step

one or like 5%

depending

so

something something

something let's try again and not fail

this

time my S is a ribbon

seal but with what we came up with I

become the cat familiar

to

wait but with what we came up with I

became the cat familiar to a witch

girlfriend then someone knocked over the

mouse fog bowl and I became a mouse wait

what okay so we were cat to a witch and

then became a

mouse interesting roxies welcome thank

you for p

pcking p

p what not sure if P would be so

comfortable being find dragons first

you this Infinity is the best Disney

game because you can play as

Rapunzel and now I have to redo all

this

just because I was silly come

here yes extra lives very useful for

me you know

what I'll do this

level well now yeah probably stop with

like this games on PlayStation one or

something if there's a series of

games try to play them at water or

something go oh yeah I need to get the

key oh yeah and and the rules of the

game is to actually take damage but

these things do not deal damage it does

not

count and that's not me Che

level again cuz it's easy gems to

get if I can't play as pon pon why

play well I am working on a pon pon mod

for crash 4 so but you have to do this

first two levels as crash that's

worst they are

currently

whoop why you flying so slow

Spyro

w w w

w so there's like the crash Trilogy and

the uh crash 4 that allows you to switch

between crash and Coco

fre but in all three games of the crash

3 Trilogy no no no actually

not

no crash crash three is the only crash

game the Crash oh did I miss a train

again that wouldn't be good so yeah

Crush tree three in the

threey I might have missed a

train this isn't good

so it's the only game where you can play

as coko in the very first

level of

Crash Yep this is game

over

ah

oh okay doing this without

taking

as I said I wanted to do the the flight

level without

failing cuz I thought I was that good

should I continue with that restriction

or should I

not your can which

reignited yes crash first there's always

a catch yeah I

know in the SPID reignited you can play

as pon pon

first you first can only play as pon pon

you cannot even play as

SP I try to only play as female

characters in games

same I play as female characters in

games because I'm a trans

woman later taser only plays as female

characters in game because he likes to

look at female

characters

I don't know if that's the

reason

hello real Pand is here now I'm on P Pon

slap I'm not going to complete the first

world I'm just missing

mistakes if there's no female Playbook

characters I look for

mods your look for mods even though

there's a female Playbook character

in okay now okay I I need to I need to

stop

paining you're going to update the

spreadsheet Yano messed it up again oh

yeah no tell Jano to come in here and

write a formal apology this is

unacceptable yeah know it's it's

unacceptable Mo oh yeah it's the panda

that says

moveo hey I mean you're right but don't

have to

out oh I mean if I'm right I'm right

right I mean I like to look at female

characters too

so but that might be

I

[Music]

mean oh the camera didn't want follow

that for a

moment I really I'm not really part of

the pon pon Community like most

here I don't know anyone here some kind

of

guest you can just you you'll get along

everyone is

friendly and some people are just here

very

occasionally red dragon is quite often

here L taser I think been here more

active more active recently but but I'm

also been not streaming much I think I

could be

wrong but is a is a

nice always nice to have you

here

that's it calling

out calling out calling you out

again it's an not

that no no feeling like you have have to

be active or have to know people either

for that matter I don't expect everyone

here to know

everyone I'm here for the fluffy bunny I

mean why wouldn't

you yep

that's what was your nickname again

taser that's what T is here right to

look at female

characters I don't really like watching

streams much in general it's just

amazing I mean it's not just

you it it's a me thing

too it's just a I I'm the kind of gy who

doesn't like to miss out on things I

mean you are free

to picking up and another useless life H

you are free to uh watch the like

the the vs every stream I do is

available to watch

afterwards and there are streamers I

have

uh where I have watched the full whole

stream

afterwards to not miss out on

their

sequence there we go that's the last one

100 100

again I forgot to write down my I still

haven't complet first the

world when understand well I I wasn't

much into watching streams at

all before I started streaming myself

hey move your dead

body get

hit oh vs that's nice also it's R for me

to watch The Vi that's over an hour in

one sitting I mean that's fair you have

the option to

pause

I'm just joking

and but it's

understandable

okay I'm redoing

this I I I need

to I need to complete this flight I'm

supposed to be good at this

flight this is my I said like my

favorite flight or

so so I need to be good at

it this is how you solve it this just my

path okay I say it's this is my path in

uh reignited does it doesn't seem to

work as well

in on the original

game and and then you take like one lap

around here then you have the other

train

there

who and then go back

here to catch them

here wh so much for catching

them and then the final

train and the final two planes

nice double

kill P Pon Hello Panda the real P

panda say I say panda sometimes I say

panda slap those

wings H must tell you something

oh what is

it

I try to well flying into the wall now I

miss the first chest and the

S

well there we go flying up into the

ceiling new record it's new record

everything Panda want to say

move uh I left Tangled running in the

background my play time for the game is

30 hours currently well that's a that's

an HBY I guess I'm not going to pass the

Hub

World

which it's an interesting choice see

there we go I completed one level 100%

And then I did need flight level

100% And then I should try to redo the

Stone

Hill oh wait I already deal with that

one let's see if we can do stone heal

100%

440 this world is going to be very

tricky look they water is

animated so how about I go here where I

took the damage last time and deal with

those enemies

immediately like

that this has been changed in the

remake so we no

longer bounce back back after hitting

them

well get away

spider

boom

boom Oh Rapunzel has to be my most

played game if she isn't then that's

bad is this Borderland

obsession

come on SPID jump over it oh look water

still

water so so so

Frozen there we go and that's the

key key to a chest not my

chest ramming

Rams yes I I'll even though they are

much bigger with bigger

horns than than Spyro and every and all

that fire is still the winner must pick

up his usess

life look at the size different just one

horn on the ram is is as lar as

Spyro

but spy has the right

technique stop shaking

already her not being my most play game

is how my villain Arc

be

yes fun has been horns than the Rams oh

wait what what kind of horns are we

talking about

here there are certain things that I

could guess you could refer to but I'm

not sure if you would call them

horns and wouldn't be PL I anyway moving

on the mental ones oh oh I see that key

is for your chest no I said it wasn't

for my chest are you saying there is a

key for your

chest oh that key oh sorry I misread

your comment that key isn't for your

chest NOP it didn't say I was saying

that there is a key for a chest H look I

got 196 gems

anyway I might be saying that

there

no my mental horn

walked around it little

us

goodbye how many mental horns do you

have I usually fly over here and I've

seen a lot of people do it but I think

you meant to fly over here because the

gems are placed here showing you that

you're supposed to go there this is

working on the edge of the world and you

can see

into the

distance never ending oh it was

ending

Untitled Goose game is the best Goose

game that is Untitled wait but it is

titled now you got a p

message Untitled Goose game is the best

Goose game that has Untitled in its

title

or I guess you can make it I not it

would because it's more or less meta but

saying Untitled because you you face off

this direction when you come up here

unted Goose game is the most popular

Goose game with title in its

title an unted Goose game is one of the

few games I assume one of the few games

that has the title in its

title well it has title as part of a

word

but but but still come

on there we

go sorry about that let's move on find

the remaining

gems I have oh

sorry there you go I had 20 M mental

yeah not metal horns mental horns that

move around

oh oh like a SW

blate finally nice

warm pink message Yay yes if you do the

highlight my message

redeem you get a message in your user

color so y would get like a brown

message they should rename onti the

goose game

to Hon

harass imagine calling a a title game

[Music]

Untitled W 200 out of

200 the level has been 100% complete at

this without taking a single hit point

of

damage yes that's a br message

also it's no it's clearly Brown I mean

Brown is dark red

so

so I started so much getting up there in

when I was a child it's so easy to get

up there I say when I know the old

people who struggle to get up there

there we go that's the last dragon and

then I can aspargus

Argus then I can go to next

world oh a red message of pon pon being

on a

leash do you do you have the other leash

or did that subscription run

out should

I yeah Town Square shouldn't be a hard

level let's go to Town

Square

look at those flips so

flippy so flipping

good that subscription ran out

oh otherwise you

could double leash pon

pon well if your leash is

a subscriber

emote which I think it should be because

then because I mean it's a very special

unless but it's a bit

redeem that's part two no no what I what

I meant it should be is it is okay wait

just it a

beit said post

what is the last ones that's not how

check no it's

not yeah because H if it's a subscriber

what I meant by it should be is that it

should should preferably be because then

you can have the pay points

for emote and then people can pay for it

and use it somewhere

else hint

hint like this exactly then you can use

the

customize emote modify emote then you

can have two leash or if in a case where

you want a leash on the other side

because it makes more

sense now you have a

leash what would I

be you have a you have a leash around P

Pon front p and around her

tail and it's around her tail trust me

oh yeah they they get stuck for a while

and then they die what a life they star

this

anyway oh I F that like this yeah that

looks

better good that you can

like change side when need

it unless that's

like a

second but what it so it ends with h oh

post

check okay I have my check has been

post and the um

yeah when you apply the horizontal flip

it gets suffixed with HF or horizontal

flip but what happens if you would name

an emote

that well that was close to the

edge I don't know what half of this

thing to

do I mean you open the menu and it says

like change outfit that would change Pon

P's outfit if pon pon is wearing the

pink dress otherwise it just it's on

otherwise it will be cute but someone

has queued up for 1 hour and 15 minutes

there only been 24 hours so

far yeah like that but that

will that will come after all of your

generators

roue oh oh why did I feel

that

I will lower it to like 5 minutes or so

I think 5 minutes uh make it cheaper to

when

I go over to the 3D models which will

have many more outfits so it will cycle

through the outfits quicker but since I

only got two outfits to pick

from I I I don't feel like changing that

at the

moment someone yes someone put up

right now in 50 more minutes of

swimsuit I guess I'm not seeing Sports

weon it was before the swim [ __ ] so I

mean you should have already seen it

but that was the bunny tummy

time there we

go oh it did not hit

it h you could have different Tis of the

redeem for different amount of

time what I could have but that's just

going to get confusing no too much

handle whoa I saw someone sneaking

up oh oh

oh oh well look

11% oh well I'm not I never going to do

this go one was completed was was 10 and

then I got 85 out of

200 oh well

okay and this was like run four or

something because have not kept track

and I'm not going to complete this game

without taking damage maybe I'm I'm

putting too much uh hating

myself you should add a pink dress as an

option to I someone else said that too

the stream has gone on for 1

hour that means that ad should play very

soon yes in like 1 minute okay rolling

oh it's been peaceful let's play now is

it

6 wased time we now have 12,000 treasure

or is it

for, 12,000 or

14,000 okay

see I gu should go now

okay

so should I continue with the challenge

because I keep fing

look I pixelated everything goes when I

pause

it now it's very

sharp and I do this now it's pixelated I

the textures text on the pixelated

someone wrote me a message

[Music]

on

so

anyway try to watch the

next yes and

is so

um I wish I could

like trying

to trying to think but uh I I can't

see

why does see me it take so

long

so let

me

okay

so also I forgot to change

the camera to active oh why is this one

set minus 12 by

default

inventory I want like reignited to have

like this kind of view I think this will

be more instead of more better yes

that's how we speak English more good

would be better by uh just having gems

and dragon count or an in count I

guess instead of just a

percentage anyway uh let's uh let's

continue with this so but the question

is should I still like do the challenge

because I keep failing at

it thank you for releasing me Spyro free

10 dragons

in then find the balloonist he'll

transport you to the next World what

about nasty NK I'm going after him find

dragons first that's all I can tell

you and should be over starting a new

run which is only risky in this Dragon

so

far

okay I need to stop filing that's that's

my current is [ __ ] I keep

failing and I was so close to finishing

the level

two but but

now I had to mess up that that's P

Pon P Pon is the one

that keep being

silly the the exploding

art FES like in slow

motion

whoa whoa planes

everywhere eight of

them come here the planes seems to fly

quickly

H

well don't push me into the

water she is the problem oh

no here comes the comments about skill

issue I do have some issues with my

skills I am not the most skillful

player not terrible but I am really

pushing my

limits you can do it that's more like

it I should at least be able to complete

the first world without doing like a

mistake I'm basically trying to do

perfect

friend you also have skill ISS at being

not

kid well who's who's saying that I'm

trying not to be

[Music]

kid imagine taking getting the the

objects in the order they are listed

listed in the order you know they aren't

because I finished the plane before the

Arches yeah they have that specific

order to them imagine doing it in that

order oh glitching through

spidal

cute I'm happy I think so I like being

very

cute I say in a m Voice v I can't even

pick up a single

gem but yeah that that's the theme I

want on my stream I want to be the cute

a I do have a picture of pon pon with

another streamer for

scale

okay there you

go this

level only contains 100

gems

up

whoop p p the pun pun

thinking I was thinking about one of the

outfits could be like a t-shirt with a

print on

it and

then the print can be different like
