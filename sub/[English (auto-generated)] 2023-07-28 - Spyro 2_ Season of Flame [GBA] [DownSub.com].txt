welcome welcome

to

clearly was first and this is no doubt

about that

[Music]

been playing this game for almost six

hours now that that would be correct I

think because a place to

streams

did I quit earlier previously because I

did also play

because this lemon

this lemon

let me check

oh this level

yeah yeah I did quit early

because of this level

yeah I didn't feel great when I was

playing

foreign

[Music]

that's cheating

yeah I wasn't feeling the best ones

playing this yeah

okay Cinemas ah

like that

no I hear them

no it's first yes

I had a bad day that time as well

you can look up badly

thank you

oh no it's like this type

it's They Don't Shoot Many attack even

though that would make no sense

all right come on

Maui contact Now ABC champion

so

no no no

well my shot where did he go I know

another one of tea on my this level it's

just going to be more annoying than this

huge level like there are these things

it is 11 though there's some something

up there

you can go I really need to map I hope

it's so down

okay there's a checkpoint here

[Music]

reconnect

now I can't touch that one

and I mean

the third reason to go here but

kill those

I think that's a good reason enough

I am

out of out of green stuff again

before

it only makes me shoot slower but does

it really affect anything else

again I can load up again

funny persistent one but yeah I'm not

the one to give up

giving up

is not for the fun time

oh wait

oh well headshot

oh

all right it worked if you're quick

enough

let's load up with more

hey wait didn't I die okay hiking after

that

yes nope don't land on that thing that's

a bad thing here

oh yeah stop talking so much

did a few

yep there we go I need

I'll take some more

that I just remember that it's only

receptive practice so it doesn't add to

something would like it to do

nothing yes

I'm getting everything yeah that one

doesn't leave them away

oh yeah

thank you

[Music]

down

wait a minute

it's interesting oh yeah there was a

thing down here

I can go all the way down there but

there was nothing left there because

that team

action secretly deserves an action here

actually

I mean yeah it's it's quite a sporty

outfit

you have to

it's an action sequence you have to show

your timing that's just how it works

okay I've been here no I haven't been up

there but I've been here and here it

ends

yeah there's nothing else there but

there are very success

the time for me to go back

and go up

that

thing

which is over here oh no

stop shooting me

that is very huge

I come in peace

so don't turn me into pieces there you

go

I want to pick up these two as one

the sauce of me ready what is those

weird things

um

don't need to shoot them but it's more

fun

yes

I am very happy with that that means I

can press exit level and finally leave

these plates

to never ever in my whole rest of my

life return to this place

wait a minute

okay Namaste man

oh yeah no I remember I need any power

but

[Music]

okay how far can I go

seemed not far but as

the game works I can just

that was that was a perfect as I was

going to say in this game I can just fly

out and then I'll be put back on the

level and I just failed flying

so

so if I yes oh nice you can oh it got

stuck

yeah she's 11.

that means that all this whole area is

current

perfect

now in this area oh yeah I think I'm

supposed to take that platform that

moves between those those two locations

map

for the long platform

because why when you can fly

I'm not sure what your friend said about

me but I'm sure he said enough that's

about the history but it wasn't nice I'm

going to take quite a few gems to

elevated over my anguish I say one

thousand

I want something gems to English no wait

that's not easy

pays down thousand times and then

look at this mug they're really funny

[Music]

hello Windows error 45 hey you were here

before before I had my voice I like your

avatar money thank you first thing it is

the sporty outfit

and normally she wears this pink dress

but I had it to redeem state for a

period change her outfits

yeah she don't know

it is currently controlled massively I

will make it automatic at some point

foreign

if I was playing as Amber it says young

lady I do hope you enjoy your adventure

right I should go stamp this lock then

hmm

like I I do speak to Sheena because I

want to see what she says but that gives

you the option to enter level but you

can also just end the level in the

previous game you had to talk to the

character because they

the level entrance was closed for some

reason

[Music]

to find the

sporty outfit to be

morning

[Music]

looks like that

looks like the emitter is hard

managing the power of this volcano using

giant lava lamps

or should I do like

oh yeah this is a hopelessly oh please

that's cool

we'll destroy every last one of fructose

lava lamps when it's time to spare no

less

attention

I don't know why I jumped to conclusions

like that oh Sparks always jumping to

conclusions jump jump I do hear

something jumping

you like to jump

okay

wait you're jumping quite nice

could you take a bit easier with your

jumping

there you go

then they predict the moments

please

and watch out for lava

all right and I think machine I can't

jump off the level I think this is a

so I just need to where I need to attack

oh it's another one of these lemons

[Music]

you have to activate these to progress

the lemon

my timer's supposed to jump directly

oh I was supposed to do something about

this

oh I see I know I remember me

and yeah now spark is red

it wasn't this game released before

Harrison

because

I don't remember

but oh yeah I need to destroy this one

[Music]

Maybe

[Music]

[Music]

the hairstyle was the first game

and that I know used the red Sparks for

the additional hit points

and spiders three the original

introduced and additional hit points

after like you could unlock it which I

have done in this game

and but in that game sparks's shine is

stronger yellow

and then it was the regular yellow

blue and green

[Music]

well it appears like this came into

introduce the red Sparks as a as a level

but after Queen

there we go

honey

right

yeah I got kind of distracted

yeah stuff I don't like I haven't got so

much bouncy in this game oh excuse me

oh oh

there's getting made

okay that fancy thing that a bit of a

problem bouncing

yeah this game came out 2002 here since

2004 yes all right

I thought about something like that

[Music]

yes so this is the international parade

Parts I was moving back now right yeah I

am

just kind of neat

it's a shame they didn't do that in the

remake

but they accepted that this is actually

a good design

it only makes it more clear

I don't know

Sheila is dying

Chila died

she got a ball to the face

wait I can take this all right Karen

foreign

[Music]

stop doing that

poor Sheila

what is your what is he

wrote's first porch Sheena

wait I didn't mean to do that

how does these Boulders work they are

chasing

and it's chasing poor Sheena

so we're not done down here yes it

appears to be the case

and a few crazy there you see on this

one

well

let me help you

okay I have another one selling

but on that one there was a gem

no don't jump away no don't jump on me

there we go squish

yeah I'm here just looking forward

welcome with the bunny

what's up I'm happy that you are really

good

luck around here hey

[Music]

dying

nope

no no

sorry seems strong there we go

no here we go

so many sound effects in this letter

[Music]

so I was still trying to shoot so many

things that China

oh that was close

[Music]

okay

I didn't hear me got one oh wow there's

something now

okay

there we go

I'm stuck throwing Granger needs

okay

oh yeah

I'm moving away

there you go

do you like my Dodge today

[Music]

uh why do you have to move around so

much

let me guess

this one here are the remaining

that one and that one

and that one too and that one and that

one

and then go

everybody

and now I should catch up the remaining

gems that I spread out all over this

place

a great thoughts thank you

I didn't even it's 25678 in this game

I didn't even know it worked like that

but

it does apparently

oh my God

and then down and now to the final area

[Music]

which is down here

funny

no what is this

very long attack Cycles that's nice

we have the gems I really wish I could

jump over

well definitely

and you're not even throwing the stones

I think you were supposed to do that

no I never expected

honey

let's see there's a bunny

oh yeah

that's where I came from me

excuse me that was rude

[Music]

there we go

that's all the gems and here's the one

and only

very very you kept a few I meant Dragon

you know a firefly that's what's the

word

flame fly

feeding the monster hurts either

the only good enemy that there was

like yeah

I mean

it is at least in the very next Trinity

they don't have an applied buying

animation

meaning that when I get to when I exit a

level

that they are just Frozen in in a pose

because there's no flying animation to

load

and it looks so stupid because

when you exit

level it's using the flying animation

about which characters so they so the

characters should have flying animation

just so it doesn't look stupid

you see

yeah Sheila wasted some luck I have

ah another five that was easy to go

he captured sizzle

okay let's see

Gypsy Road that's a bit of an awkward

name

in 2002

oh I know that song Oh is there a song

called chip cereal

actually thinking of the other word

I don't know I

it's never ah

I was actually thinking of the other

word

so

it is wait which photos

no wait

no yeah yeah am I not wrong

and oh yeah oh Orange

so let's start playing let's let's do

Celestia planes it sounds nice I guess I

do like the bottles of showing up on the

map

not that it tells me what part of this

but yeah

and is it wrong

uh it isn't Gypsy considered a bit of

offensive or am I mixing it up with a

different word

aren't you supposed to

isn't it like Domani or something I

could be wrong

wait a minute this is back home

[Music]

yeah this I wasn't meant to go to this

and then wait I want to go back to

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

now

[Music]

where am I going

where am I going

that's a Christmas song okay

I'm going to start the planes

yeah don't don't go to a place called

planes

well now I'm looking for story planes

so I guess I'll check one of those today

don't remember which part of it is here

hunting

I likely forgotten about it now

there you go please

that's why the two parts are together

because he won back and went for it

okay same

it's a bit weird that you don't exit the

important itself why did I start down

here not up there

anyway

it's very easy

oh wait am I on

it's fine

though I found another power game this

one will temporarily give you a whole

new power a lightning breath this should

be very effective against

metal enemies and objects where I can

charge Madeline all inspired I found

another Firefly for you and here we go

just throw it out but just hold it when

I you know playing if freezing it

catches here

years

so

oh yeah let me guess

[Music]

nice range

I was even saying it's not going to

update it we're just updates every

second so what

catch them water spider doesn't like the

water not always posted up yeah this is

what I'm supposed to do

oh this is going to be fun

okay all right how did you fall out

it's supposed to be in the question

and that goes back this is forward okay

I'm starting to understand how this game

works so I need

oh what is this

Firefly

ear captured really

that would be green grilling

actually real scene since

okay

it's three

why do you have more of these

are being here I think

you're not too actually the same time

no

no no okay

are you just missing out too much with

me how it works

it's a very short time

oh and I guess I'm not supposed to take

what I am supposed to do it okay

I just need to be quick and stop bumping

into things there we go

under the flashing part is quite long so

what am I here right there

hmm thank you for

so much

I want to be a kid funny he captured

brace

oh 25.

and this game anyway

longer time

and I almost fly over here and yeah can

I almost fly over here nope

using too much height

but I can't do it it's

[Music]

no I can't do it comes back here

this give me a bit of flashbacks to

cookie challenge with it anyway

yeah

wait I mean I haven't checked this area

over here

there might actually be

a cat from here too

Electrify yes of course

okay another attempt

and this time hopefully last one

thank you

oh there yeah there was the last one

[Music]

you captured Brian

it's by saying I collected all of them

now I can actually enter an Evan

this

how much

whatever

this is just a place where I guess the

daughter to Worlds anyways I'm supposed

to go there

this is

what happened

no nothing

dreamy Castle I do like like game worlds

that's kinda

and that's that's an aesthetic I like so

I would probably like this one we'll see

use it no idea conflict that one hour

because it's a following remote

and you've got like twice it like that

sport spray

and yeah please have to fix that I think

people are reporting it

[Music]

on this point you know

sticks on it

[Music]

oh my goodness gracious little dragon

you simply must help us design except

taking a leader

mayor Mooney and set him afloat in a hot

air balloon

now the balloon is out of control you

have to help us getting down please

hurry

miranda.com or he didn't really beat the

theme

please you must hurry

you captured solar

and this bunny doesn't look okay

I suppose it's supposed to be green

because more of a dreamy scene but it

didn't make every pixel on it green

foreign

[Music]

oh yeah

yeah it's probably one of my most

favorite ones

especially the little kid so I don't

know how I would would be scared of that

face

so

[Music]

excuse me I approach him

be captured

okay

you captured cone man

[Music]

I should hydrated

[Music]

there we go

yeah the feral one is for

if it it could be good to know

if you spend

Toten of one thousand uh

one thousand bits on of course my

channel it doesn't matter how much each

one is

oh all right Owen

and it doesn't matter how long you wait

it will remember how much it is

and then when you reach 1000 the Pharaoh

is yours

oh here it is that was easy wait

[Music]

no I didn't mean to fly

I describe this as indifference yeah

like

no comment

right

I guess that worked

[Music]

okay

[Music]

I don't think that helped

let's kill the plugs okay

there's a really fun projection here

I get

I guess you can make fun of me

sequences of emotes

[Music]

so many nice pianos here

it's not exactly a dream aesthetic I was

looking for but

okay and either surprise

nice

yeah and I'm I'm around on those emotes

myself that explains why they look like

that

oh no

don't be leaking

licking the face very nice

thank you okay

at some point

I feel like

they could be better

[Music]

there's something down here

but I need to use that one to visit

grab them

it doesn't seem to come to this place

[Music]

uh

no that was a mess

and yeah there's nothing more than that

well I guess I'll just jump out and see

what I can find I hope I'm not supposed

to find that one because I can't sing

that one

cemeters

again

goodbye

if that's the start

there's some platform here again

wait

and it's a need to learn effort are you

an artist like Korean language design

interest

I mean I'm no artist I wouldn't consider

myself an artist

and

green I made art or chance I am an

artist nonsense

but I barely draw I mean

this

um

because I can actually

show you

the two drawings I've actually completed

and where did those kill

we're gonna put flashy in the drawings

for this of course

and then where where is it

[Music]

oh that's fine

that's fine

I can see if you guess it was

all right how big is this how am I

supposed

it's really

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

so that was the first drawing I made on

screen like I don't know actually when I

did the emails mate did I do the image

after this drawing

yeah

another big Germany

I'm a drawing break now

so this is another deal uh

another streamer and her pets and of

course you know fun fun

[Music]

and

[Music]

what is it

what did you change the screen of my son

I couldn't remember now at least

remember what I was supposed to go to

find the other drawing and this drawing

is also really pink I did draw a quite

high resolution

and the other drawing is this one

[Music]

Sailor One Punch

[Music]

wait

ah nice outfit and better feet

I'll add my two drawings

I have completed

[Music]

oh yeah this one was dry enough

[Music]

yeah so I did another thing I did some

morning mode so

yeah

I get to reference very nice

yeah I think I think the reference is

pretty obvious

thanks for sharing thanks guys

I mean I have published them they are

available online so

and I have um also put them on my

Discord server which I should and

there we go

[Music]

right there

by following the link or

you can always

if you use this card which is like any

trick that not everyone knows about

and that is if you want to join us very

very countryly open the link for

whatever reason

you can copy the link

it's only the letters at the afternoon

that is important

and then you go to Discord and add a new

server and then you choose to join an

existing server and then it goes post

the link in that text box

and that's it then you'll be added to

the survey

um

need to get that one

which needs to that one

and they start platform what does this

platform go

[Music]

oh it just goes here

um

and that was pretty simple

[Music]

Chinese

you can also talk to me when I'm

listening it's not much coming soon it's

quite uh

um I guess you could say sorry

very little activity which I think is

fair that means that you can

actually pay attention to every message

that she's posted

oh and then there was one over here

somewhere I think

right

I'm not misery

I'm not misremembering that

I mean oh no there it is

well it glitched out of existence

you seem like you remember all of

pumpkin's dreams way back

but did you know each other before she

started streaming or something like that

and let's say uh

sorry oh I bet

uh is

you can't stand on it it's not that

because it's a plan for him

and yeah like

oh well I guess that worked

not open knees it's not like it's just

but you never know this could be like

him no

I can't maybe jump on here

we normally shot it for around seven

years now

yeah it's been quite amazing

there we go

attacked me yeah there we go let me know

he's standing there for quite a while

this is just this side

[Music]

oh there we go no

don't be so creep left for him

but yeah anyway that's been there since

I think my very first thing that has

been supporting me every ever since I've

been very grateful for that even if I

haven't even expressed

that as I am actually very happy

around

come on again

and there we go

they're only going down then

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

oh

you oh

I don't think that's that's so it maybe

it's um that was a close color

I hereby Proclaim this day of the Dragon

throughout dreamlands

here Spyro is a gift by which to

remember this day

he kept me company while I was stuck up

in that balloon

anyway

you catch it Mirai

nope not time to go home yesterday

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

oh there we go no not playing

please

you captured hey

[Music]

especially young really anything scary

yeah

yeah it was really really realistic

sounding yard

come on just run alongside the ones you

know that our spider

I walk

out through the door

come on

okay it wasn't some more up here this is

[Music]

no I can't switch the eyes again

you captured Brandy oh

does Brandon need anything else than the

drink

wait that's just by saying that I've got

a stop jumping around

hey sorry I had to run away from it to

be right after I was being uh well you

got 30 reason from there so

oh I could hear some friends herself

Right Step Up

okay that's neat

oh you know I need to shut up for seven

years that's neat

[Music]

is that is that one yeah this one well

that's neat

[Music]

I'm just joking

aren't you gonna sing something

bye real it's so good to see you this is

the testing course that we use to choose

all of our life

Only the strongest the fastest and

smartest can become a dream Knight

do you want to give it a try

draw The Gauntlet easy

the rule is a simple wait why are you

giving me the rules well that makes

sense but in this game you kind of

commit to doing it it's not like I get a

second question of this

there is a simple make to the finish

line

and today to the finish line

okay

in under 90 seconds

if you lose

that won't happen

then I'll bring you back here good luck

[Music]

it won't happen trust me

oh

my

and yeah like it's been been there to

support his investor the adventures yeah

yeah

yeah it's been really it's been great

yeah it needs nice face I mean yeah

they used to Generations thank you very

much

yeah that too it's like

especially like yeah

[Music]

the duties

okay I'm not really on here

Friday so it is okay we don't have to

run away from me

Spanish neighbors are shouting and

making love bye oh make me so cool yeah

I can't imagine that

[Music]

Neighbors

am I supposed to fly over here yes I'm

not waiting for a platform oh

are we doing it like this

[Music]

come on how am I supposed to avoid that

because that's probably difficulty again

[Music]

okay

[Music]

oh there's a queen

[Music]

you can't get me if I'm upstairs

don't take much time well it didn't stop

[Music]

rude platform

yeah I'll do it again

okay this time I want some weight at the

start

[Music]

oh this time I

come on

[Music]

I'm not this planet again trust me

this is probably the last

[Music]

five I need this one

all right

all right

[Music]

I haven't seen yeah

oh I fell off

[Music]

I don't need to wait for that one

[Music]

okay this time I should remember that it

won't start why it's a cute face

nice

am I supposed to go there she was

supposed to go down

spider died

when

where was I

I was that one in mindana no it is

no no that's not the one

that oh yeah this is one

over here

there you go dreamy class I'm doing it

explain it to my head

three me Castle yeah I remember I just

didn't remember where the portrait was

dying

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

oh come on why did I do that

[Music]

also this game doesn't which was a bit

confusing too

to me at first this game does not count

extra lives

as most games do like basically I'm

gonna spiral every press game before

this one

yeah that's been counting extra lives

this game does not count extra lives it

costs the total number of lives

the difference is that in this game you

cannot hold a zero number of extra lives

which of course makes sense if it's just

extra lives but in this game it just

it's not a normal lives

anyway let me do this again

[Music]

without mistakes

[Music]

I can do this I need to believe in

myself

wow I thought that was quick enough

nope I need that team

it's probably I'm waiting a point

clear Candy in

I can use

give me a moment

she's smiling smiling at me

at least this one is nice not to win for

me

not that one

I'm not am I supposed to go down maybe

I'm supposed to get down

and I remember now I wanted to activate

it

[Music]

see that we don't need a countdown

[Music]

[Music]

can I like playing that thing

[Music]

in this this one

can you die

and if they got frozen once not twice

when I have to hired the enemies to be

on the obstacle course I mean

I guess it makes sense in a sense of

making the Obstacle of course have

obstacles but

any pain the enemies

[Music]

no

there is a platform down here

or I could go to

wait am I supposed to be here

[Music]

oh there's something there

I jumped a bit too late today

this is a tricky one

it's giving me quite the challenge

[Music]

dinosaur and I just gave my life

happening original game

why am I so bad is it some simple plan

for me

there's a proton but the animal sheep

they like they like to Bunch up here we

go

and I have these sheep come back

[Music]

here we go we'll find the extra knife

maybe I can deal with that hey spider

try this obstacle course that can kill

you and do massage he she even said that

she would bring him back she doesn't she

just lets him die

I agree it's to be honest

and that should be a clue

yes lets him die quite serious to be

honest

Hello Mickey Hey Mickey

defense

or is dying

three months time

bye yeah it's been quite

[Music]

quite quite the timing skin here

right the quite the time is it has been

now I don't know I don't speak English

English is not my first language

please

she's probably obvious

from the way I say same

[Music]

when you're speaking to friends back

I didn't need to do something about when

you add a message to that

oh

no seriously

I'm wasting more time avoiding this and

I

get from avoiding these

[Music]

things yes

[Music]

[Music]

no no

iron is Frozen

spinal is again Frozen

[Music]

cone

he made it we must know finish line or

[Music]

I'll be back here if you have any

problems

problem and apparently not

though I try and I didn't even

probably less than that

just have to avoid

yay

um

I do care about me though in a negative

sense

bus depot

why what happened there

but what's the part like

up there am I just confused in it

mixing up to them

[Music]

and Mickey is fine it's not anyway

[Music]

an infinite supply of burgers

to move down I don't want to oh my

my this

I've had such a easy control inspired

before it it's here if that sounds good

the

thing it

right now again sometimes just two jumps

away at me

at this part of the game

[Music]

it is so cute using all those foxy

that's that's uh that's what I want my

company must be

maybe I should take some inspiration

[Music]

you can become a bit more cap wow so

much for being careful because it's not

much left of the 11 anyway

came out

way too many three of us up there almost

three

thank you for freezing me at the edge uh

game moment

I was gonna be sent to Austin on a

business assignment tomorrow but it got

canceled so no no need to put it anymore

there we go

Austin Texas thanks I see

oh I do know about Austin Texas I don't

know if there's any other of all steam

anywhere else

could be

I'm kind of losing lifestyle

maybe there's a group of sheep okay

somewhere

pick up two

I see where are you going there another

time instead of this constant time

Austin misery

as soon as you step up of the platform

you can no longer jump

shame he couldn't make it through the

karaoke stream

perfect for I mean if you're busy busy

that's that's just uh what's what's with

this productive

still confused about that part

not like I'm going to go down here and

then it's going to stay no sorry you

went to the wrong platform this round

doesn't count even though it wasn't like

50 lives

camping is run

that's final it's nine lives

[Music]

what is this

I thought this was supposed to be a moon

but all I see is a rocket

[Music]

um green kitchen sponge and

[Music]

Indians are keeping me from carrying out

my mission we got to take off soon but

they've turned off all of the

navigational systems that will help us

get home you got to help us get those

systems back online

[Music]

thank you oh sorry I'm completely

gone apparently

[Music]

give away one give yourself one last

time you don't hurt you

but

okay

is hopefully getting ready he's happy I

think I think oh there you go that's how

it was the technique I think it was

[Music]

obviously

appreciates it this is the exit portal

this makes more sense that this one has

the start of the level

[Music]

oh

those numbers are really tough and maybe

your lightning breath can stop these

metallic monsters oh

that's what I need a mouse trap

why would I have that around

[Music]

this is a bit silly

number two no down here

[Music]

why not be a spin the bridges on the

internet

[Music]

it's too slow day

they actually find

oh yes

[Music]

okay

I mean yeah there we go good

[Music]

here's something

if those are the ones I should activate

for the

Firefly then

you can own that scene but can I always

charge these texts

and Company is a very amazing princess

oh I am a princess

thank you

and a very lovely person anyway today's

question again are in this area and

seeing as they listen on board yeah just

as beautiful as you can be

and keeping yourself that's what you all

wanted to be I will not leave you safe

as a religious what's up

I don't know what to say

and yeah

and yeah I am basically

the information that that

I don't know it's because dancing it's

it's good to be kind I'll try to be kind

of team as best as I can

we should be nice and kind exceptions

hey

do you need thank you friend using

regardless

yeah it really has helped my emotions

and stuff hey crafted steamy

he Inspirations

this is Milton molten kitchen sponge

[Music]

okay I can step on this though

I

I need this one

[Music]

so yeah and I said honestly

even with the information came out from

the survey

[Applause]

be kidnap it's just that I'm a trans

woman it's not the secret

[Music]

yes

I don't want to keep that the secret

there's too much of a burden I've kept

it a secret for long enough

[Music]

yeah

anyway let's go in here

can I keep it no wait a minute

it cancels my timer so I need to find

[Music]

wait how am I supposed to

[Music]

be

they say

there is another room there you can see

from this room

[Music]

oh yeah

why not why not wearing a nice outfit

this one

[Music]

I do like that though I mean I wouldn't

have something I mean I could have

outfits for fun but I don't like

the other people like them again

[Music]

I'm fine with that right in here

[Music]

wait wait I can charge these

but

I thought I thought I had to use the

electricity to defeat them

so I don't need electricity to feed them

or do I need electricity oh what's going

on with this thing

[Music]

yeah I don't think that exclusive to

just picky scenes

I don't mean

[Music]

he looks so sunny in the game you need

to keep this for swearing otherwise yeah

a nice a nice short top

keeping me

and keep keeping her

keeping her tummy nice and cool be

captured me

[Music]

yes I see him

that's the other room

dude I think it shouldn't be a redeem

thing

okay

[Music]

so I can't charge it for to be honest it

is actually easy to use the electricity

but it does become a bit confusing

[Music]

okay okay

[Music]

I tried to come up with something I

think

but yeah

I guess that one should be

um

the idea of

[Music]

yeah

you must be able to say

yeah here we go where's the person I'm

supposed to talk to

there you go

your mouth sir oh hello you haven't seen

our captain have you have to take off

soon and there are evil aliens running

around posing a serious threat to our

mission are a bit worried that about

Captain whiskers he's not quite as Brave

as he appeared

so

[Music]

so

what am I supposed to do then

[Music]

[Music]

something

[Music]

what type of monkey

[Music]

actually yeah

it was someone else that

[Music]

so

okay it was someone's recommending it

originally but then I put more

information

so it's the blue yeti probably have

heard about it

and it's

of course easy to get and set up and

everything

however it doesn't

according to these people who are more

into sound and stuff

it doesn't seem to be the best option

for the money you have to spend on it

[Music]

answer these mice looks like they got a

kill and he's just really badly the way

the dance around so that's just how

alien mice news

about the Blue Yeti today so that's nice

get creative sound I guess

I yeah I guess I guess quality wise I

would say is good

but I guess

because it could have been even better

[Music]

well what happened hey

it's sunny dear

[Music]

it's like good enough for kids

[Music]

I don't even know what that is

oh

but I don't know microphones so

[Music]

inspired cute

[Music]

is that one I'm so confused about this

level

[Music]

I am very confused

[Music]

okay

[Music]

it does remember that

[Music]

I'm here again

[Music]

that's not an altitude in

the other spider games

especially here this does not look

intentional but you can do it

intentional

to be honest

yeah I am global

[Music]

no we didn't anymore I said I saw some

crimes but yeah how did the crime

regarding oh here's the key how did I

miss that

[Music]

well

[Music]

okay and now I definitely lost the key

all right now problem

I know

[Music]

why do you keep doing this to me game

can I charge those enemies or not you

can't have bows

okay

yeah this is a great moment

okay I got the key at least the enemies

stay dead that's actually not saying

they did in the original game

but it cannot maybe realize that

I'm really enjoying the game it's super

fun okay it looks like you were actually

enjoying you're a good time playing

and despite all the distraction and

confusion but I think that I just adds

to the experience

making it very

[Music]

so

it's supposed to be oh there it is

please be the remaining gems yes

tell me something here

I think I think that was it no no

there's a rocket mini game I'm not down

here

[Music]

where was that fortune

go all the way on this line well I can

think

sport cat all right I guess it's not a

shortcut when I have to wait for it

yeah and I'm super bad at writing

well I wouldn't say that you're better

training

I think you

considering

you were going around those corners and

stuff really when actually

to be honest

oh yes

now

hello again he curves up there in the

carpet hiding

[Music]

and I mean getting ready for takeoff

I mean what is he hiding

I mean I assume he's hiding himself but

this evening keep attacking the ship

before he can get everything loaded I

have another one of these you could give

me a pan and hold them back until we can

take off the ship yeah I'll give it

where are they come from I hear a lot of

noise

I was doing my best

maybe I should just charge them

[Music]

what I know the temperature crack again

now I said start over again don't worry

about it

no wait is this

okay

this part this mouse has learned from

you if you think all of you I have I

have joy did your parents

and this is heavenly side Parks whatever

there's no food underneath the ship it's

kind of explode about this type of

definition it's a different kind of

okay

it's alien technology

this one is actually a bit tricky

[Music]

especially when I can't hit them but why

can't I hit him

[Music]

why doesn't it work

s

why doesn't why doesn't Alexa hit them

this is so confusing

[Music]

so quick

I don't guess I could do have extra time

oh my

God

because it sounds like they had to move

the old one has to move out before I

think I'm bringing new ones if I

[Music]

seriously

[Music]

I can barely charge them because it's

not so far

because they keep attacking me

[Music]

two I'm not I decide and I can really

read this is this is going to take all

day

I was on this like yeah thank you you

know my how am I supposed to clean this

electricity I assume I'm supposed to use

things but this is so bad at hitting

down like look at this

this game easy I mean it's been easy

after this point

it's big okay like

why isn't it hitting them

[Music]

oh my

oh my

thank you

I think if I activate NXT stand there

all right

don't seem to have

okay this time they sent a few remember

[Music]

you can't make it

I guess I can't I hit it like twice but

like this city but nothing happened oh

my this is mini game

oh my the voice is the other two it's

not like it helps me to tell me where it

comes from

come on you pushing me mouse if you want

me to help you you have to stop pushing

me around

I am really trying I'm really trying but

this Alex is these surprise sets

that Mouse

the mouse is trying to get

why is nothing happening

it's a spice that oh no our car guy

why is that come on house

you have to speak so much

[Music]

[Music]

hey so much farewell friendly creature

well I died twice

around this five player a nice happy

people

he captured Kazan

[Music]

that's not everything on that level

who

23 Treasures yeah there was that chest

eye

and with us in

um

need some more gems here

so oh there we go

yeah

because this guy distracted by the game

so I didn't even finish my whole point

about the driving it he came

so my point I tried to make

was that

because you're going full speed actually

driving good is complete tricky but if

you're driving more carefully and

actually slow down in insect or stuff

but you understand it's not as fun but

in that case it would actually

Drive

better

late after the Stream

but I guess I should stream a bit extra

today I think because I didn't stream

the game yesterday

and I did just an hour yesterday so

what voice does this picture have then

yes I see a traveler he's coming to help

us

and you have eyes he's small

but has a great power he will help us

free our mentor

and Madame Miro or these are kids I can

tell he has come to save her from the

rhinox

you have stolen her away but now the

future is cloudy I can see no more

oh one

oh okay

I see myself

my mind so

I have had bearings before spends on

[Music]

I cannot activate it

[Music]

eats healthy State as the worst in this

in now

[Music]

there's nothing up here okay

I'll continue over here

okay

[Music]

got played

another pipeline named plane

or didn't mind not just playing before I

think you got MB maybe I just

remember I just

said when I got M Reddit it should be

more complicated

that is possible

two secret rooms hmm

we'll start here

there's not much of a secret room

it's quite a wide room how can this now

it's probably can fit next to each other

this is treasure

El quinoa

and then the second round

it's not as wide on the side so I guess

oh you actually got someone in here

[Music]

let's see what they have to say

oh hi there you know the biggest problem

with living in a medical realm is all

those darn fire pizzas they keep running

around making so much noise

that I can't concentrate on my spells

could you get rid of them

but you get them there is no need can

you get them to calm down for a while so

I can get my homework done

wrist actually

oh

I can do this

one

yeah oh no do they unfreeze that quickly

let's do this

foreign

[Music]

Nike

and then I can keep those like this but

[Music]

does it remain Frozen

and then I don't know how this game

works

maybe they get unfrozen if

there's the other one yeah because

they're five pieces they get unfrozen if

I uh

if I need to keep watching this anything

no there we go all right last man

I see

this is going to be tricky okay

it's okay

yes thanks

validity system

now that I know how this game works this

can actually be cleaner interesting but

the same time quite annoying

[Music]

no

Darkness ah no

no David

I'll have to start early

[Music]

we're quite into it this morning

[Music]

he captured you will like don't see how

that has to do anything with fire

they're killing running after the names

of his life

another room

yay

[Music]

it was actually quite interesting

because

oh here's the key time to unlock that

chest I guess

I'm walking out to you there

come down here so I need to basically go

around and come up again

I remember when it justice

[Music]

bunny

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

don't fall down

what can they eat

wait can I flame this or not

in this game be a bit more consistent

yeah yes I can blame them

really quick

before they start rolling or something

[Music]

but anyway

[Music]

I probably missed a bunch of grounds now

[Music]

yes I need hands

nice and lost it immediately

okay

[Music]

here we go progress

where am I so I can go over here and

I want peace guys

he captured police there that seems more

or less related to Fire and stuff

[Music]

[Music]

no I know I took damage again

I need another frog

[Music]

okay

um

[Music]

I probably have to go back and find some

scones I missed anyway

so I'll take the checkpoint

and then I will find some frogs

being up again

and then I want to make sure

[Music]

hmm

yeah oh

[Music]

my God here yes there's one

[Music]

another trunk

foreign

[Music]

there we go

now I can continue

trucks respond

so much easier to charge in this game

without being basically blind

[Music]

so it's Full House

and now

I accidentally

what's with these stands it was with the

carpet going down the stairs and then

that doesn't seem sane

what do I know

oh

pretty simple

he captured lava that's definitely

started playing that's it it fit

oh this is in here

it's a Magic Carpet I mean the carpets

unfinished Highway who says he's

unfinished

there are two rounds does it really say

easy

because

normally it says easy and then it says

they want to retry these or they want to

do the hard is that right now

there was this one I think

[Music]

another try then

that I am a trans woman which I have

posted on service one and since okay

we've been talking about beauty

I don't remember if I mentioned to you

because I barely mentioned it to anyone

because I said so that's the thing I've

thought about like that I haven't

revealed to all of my friends before but

I'm trans and

and I was thinking that

that could be seen as

I mean not I don't know don't fail in

the friendship I am high enough to read

such a thing but I also don't want to

put such a secret

like such a secret

a burning on anyone

impossible I had the best balance the

best of how much

depression depressed armor yeah

the the greatest the

power on Earth do you always manage to

do and everything are her

the way I'm going to use my very magic

to give you the ability to work anywhere

in the game it's use your address to

select the world and then whoosh

I could use that to him

[Music]

and when you get all of them

[Music]

I won't go there

I want to go there

wait oh yeah this works

[Music]

and then go there I'm trying

come here you go here's the way I'm

supposed to go that's so cute

okay it is

the only team

monkey blushing but I'll do revising is

kind of cute

[Music]

that's why I made

a blushing on phone because it was cute

[Music]

I'm glad you're here

very quickly that was not on fire

because it's a burning out

one of our lovely species is there

anything you can do to get rid of the

love

I mean if it's

fire tag

no

[Music]

he is it fire tank

[Music]

did this

oh no there are four of them

have four of them all right

[Music]

didn't see him anymore did he

stay up there

and you stay down there

and you don't do that

oh where are you

there you are no

okay

anyway

[Music]

yeah yeah at least there's no timer

time around and only three of them the

fact I was basically the same game

[Music]

Julie she's not a competition unless the

Finish you are smart and amazing thing

please

you did the right thing because he's

cute

[Music]

that's what Mickey does he just makes

everyone cry

ing

every time

like can I dress him

he's trying to cry it's only so much

[Music]

okay

and I was saying I think

I really like the name fun funny skit

because fun fun is a cute name

and I speak to Evelyn as my name

with someone

[Music]

someone said it was obvious that because

I had picked my own name obviously that

I'm trans but no people change names

[Music]

gone

please take physically Sterling piece of

God with you hey also this one is also

burning by the way

you captured me

[Music]

okay I think I'm done there

[Music]

we're trying a kid

[Music]

heavily I really is a very cute but I

don't have a name but Evelyn as a

fiction name is not

exactly but my parents have changed the

name

[Music]

now there's that and neither of them are

my friends so

as far as I know

[Music]

I said a pot of Kiss

and I've got a melted gold Maybe

[Music]

oh there it is

now it's just a part of

melted girls they probably put a piece

[Music]

why is that

they're everywhere it is away from me

I don't want to see them

wow all right

[Music]

please come flame again

[Music]

oh there we go there's the other place I

haven't been to yet

a left foot electric handbag

all right oh here's key

I need it for that other room

that other room

I don't know

and there we go

[Music]

you captured Simone

you captured see Mom

anyway

no oh

[Music]

the treasures chest is there a minimum

I must spice

yes I spoke chance to speak with despite

being dead

[Music]

but damn I have more here then

I still have

but now they want to do fighting again

because it once wasn't enough

keep foreign

[Music]

and they were frozen kept Frozen how did

they get unfrozen and bring a friend if

the friend came first and unfrost them

that would make more sense but that's

not what he said he could just be wrong

that's a possibility too

and that's a side note

and when people are doing like a lower

research whatever they call it

going

to determine the lower for a universe

the day

take everything a character says to be

completely true and that the character

cannot say anything wrong on unless

they're intention line of course

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

if you want

if that's your engineering I want to

change mine because I really didn't like

it but Mom used it in my country you can

change the name if it brings a trauma

ability but I don't have a reason so it

was just president side points I mean

you could always say

I mean in Sweden you can pay like

25 Euro 23 Euro it's 2015 switch phones

and then you can request an image change

even name

but I was

brought by nicknames now so sometimes I

mean I forgot my name like I don't know

that I am only called by Nana you here

Julie that's uh LOL

I mean yay yeah

you can just present yourself with me my

name is Julie

[Music]

um

like the sound of the keyboard

do you have a second name

secondary not another friend okay

I don't like that secondary middle name

that that's a good way of saying it we

like more

I I say Julie that's Julie

I think they're like in the middle name

be your true name so

I hope everyone almost counted out

that's uh but yeah maybe that makes

children some countries are very

distinctive and constantly and some are

quite open

there's one another name and then I said

yeah

all right let's change the outfit yes

and it's been swimsuits for 23 minutes

now

and I

think that I smelt it I guess that's

that's the reason

ing yeah hey little rocket man I'm doing

look look at this

and I have this thing that I'm moving

around and speed the light I managed to

freezeman

then

and then they unfish each other

so I had to keep all of them all four of

them from Frozen

without them an easy now they rescue one

of them

[Music]

of course it's better to keep these in a

corner but

yeah as soon as they leave them

sorry

but it's just a fancy on this place

there's no timer so

this can give up forever

[Music]

okay

you have to go to your whole legal

prices

are the last names only one name but I'm

used to it

I have six names okay Spotify yay

I guess

[Music]

first try

[Music]

hey excuse me

[Music]

performance last night

don't make me easy

Uno cards your kids because

[Music]

I don't have

a thread for redeem ideas

there we go now we just need to do it

can you have you

come on

[Music]

okay

[Music]

when someone else got three

daring

oh that was

[Music]

come on

come on

here we go

now

[Music]

now I got stuck behind the pot

so easy for surprise to get stuck in

this game

your one pixel art when he gets stuck

he's not far enough trying to correct

these positions so you don't get stuck

[Music]

I'll take this a panther I can't take

this

[Music]

again

getting stuck on everything

[Music]

I want to change it down

wait where is the last one

[Music]

[Applause]

in rescuing another one of us

[Music]

despite my team is here yeah that that's

not good have some have fun play games I

found at your own time oh no one time

your time YouTube I'm really bad at

these things

the other game

I'm always kind of trying to be

definitely

too awake you can do 11 the level of

friendless in Chinese from kindliness

from here so so much more than any other

person I know

everyone deserves love definitely and

there I do agree on that and you're

really cute at expressing it

[Music]

and and those foxes you obviously inside

which of course is

of Vixens

[Music]

makes sense

[Music]

whether they they really add their

messages if I should share it and speak

to this person every person he's not a

murderer I mean he's

[Music]

and there is scriptures now

I'm a full episode

[Music]

my you never hear of trouble until you

wanted a at its way and I miss reading

[Music]

complete complete complete not complete

ah this lemon

but what do I have left here

oh I had the XC nowadays

somewhere

when I can get rid of you

and I should remember everything here

so this

no it's this one

I was thinking the other one and this

one is my problem

the only thing I had problem is I said

well literally

well

SMS

so there's 100 of these

is

so

yeah that opened this one

[Music]

20 20 gems must be in that because

there's like a tunnel somewhere

I couldn't access

it was wait

where are the 20 gems

hmm

they're hungs which which are what the

relics are that's when yeah

I mean honestly I mean these are ants

but in relics

would be uh this place I have attended

maybe not about dinner

oh yeah you there would you mind give me

a hint I just order this time for a

great pleasure and now I found it

um blessed steam I've run off with it

I've learned him in this area but I

can't go after him or he might sleep by

me could he go catch him and get my

position but yeah this is multiplayer

since it's this is what we should done

about in five pieces

thank you

smashing

[Music]

because there is an

um

or should I say syllable

black scene and which look oh I almost

said

um

okay I can't I can't believe it

I can't even see if you can eat you have

to work

the emptiness

what is this

kind of weird to say

I mean

hey I take it back

[Music]

I can install

let's see if it's a seat reduce

as an optional

with it or she I think

I remember correctly

sound of uh an uh Thief time

now let's just already eat this night

and that's what's his name means

I didn't even catch that

I just said smashing

this machine will look right in order

this will look great in our Museum and

competition like that you know I used to

collect fireflies before I started

looking for Treasure here you can have

my last Firefly as a reward

smash I did not even know about the new

captured views

if

you found all the missing Firefly spiral

unbelievable thank you for not believing

me

[Music]

no

I'm missing out too you're keeping it

for me Nigel

there are fireflies I found

No More Travel of that

but

the bc2

[Music]

or two ones

that's a possibility you

once

[Music]

where

across on this whole level

there is a single gem hiding

I mean there are jumps here

and they are flashing

but that's not the kind of gem I'm

looking for a patsy

[Music]

easiest back down here

[Music]

I mean I take it

I I found it I just just jumped out

randomly just fell down landed on to the

gym and I found it

so I'm done here

[Music]

so there's one level here that I'm

missing one gem that it was

sticky tropics and I just can't find

this gem

under a swimsuit will be kind of nice

for a traffic from them like this

and he did not generally think

excuse me I feel safe

[Music]

stop killing Sparks I need Sparks

[Music]

there's a click now

oh thank you I have some lips you can

see

[Music]

there's that other moment in this

thing

thank you for you don't have like

which uh

it's not for things

hey it's anyone else here you don't like

if there's a moment you think should be

a clip

and you can just press the clip button

and let the automatic 30 seconds thing

be saved

we just save as soon as you press the

click button

and then I will go through and actually

make it like that's no problem

because I want to see and I want them to

make be make them into Clips anyway

and because

yeah I don't always like me on our

necklace is made and I really put a lot

of everything okay I don't have Sparks

into making the clips

starting and having kinds of them

[Music]

plus another reason is that if someone

else owns a clip they can delete clip

and if you either ban a person nothing

that would bend putting in

or and there I found this band because

that's something that could happen

because you never know with the service

like twitch they could just random event

someone

it can happen

and then the clip is gone and I don't

want that to happen

oh that's

didn't mean that I would lose all the

clips with my account yet banned but I

mean if I killed Japan I mean my cup is

bad

thank you

oh there it is

[Music]

I found it

[Music]

that's where it only has more tips to

use when you get shot at other thing

exactly

or anyone else it's not only learning

[Music]

yes and also if people just want to

watch Random clips too

[Music]

yeah

these were on fire unbelievable wow

foreign

[Music]

last time

right am I done with the game because

Sparks didn't say I got all the gems I

[Music]

or is that just not a scene

someone know

someone experienced me this game enough

to know if that's something hey let me

wouldn't know what to do here

[Music]

when I did it I completed the game 100

and it couldn't even give me some trend

music

Mike Mika very creative

but when I need the name

their child unless they've changed the

name that's the possibility too but when

it changed the name no when they give

the child the name which is really

similar to their current family name

and a radius too of course welcome

welcome

hey

Miss Kitty koi

this is given I'm yeah this is still

sorry just uh

at least I don't have to start over the

lemon all right

good

this is uh I just completed uh seasonal

Flame

and to 100

and this is the bonus

I mean a king and I died

it's I see my endless

an endless high score Runner theme

because you got the highest per day

are those elves see

there we go

the game is complete

including the Buns have boobs

so if he's he's a kid

nice things so

and it's still uh

these are very nice and kind and

to say

when I do like I really like watching

airplane games

so

yeah

let's let's exit this this is very

repetitive morning music

all right quit the whole game

okay

I hope your game went well

and

and did it save well I think I mean I

think it's all the saves

Point Dragon drops it's another game

[Music]

Spyro I'm glad you're here would you

like to play some Dragon roads I've

tried of playing by myself

[Music]

still inspired

yes let's play

yeah I think I think this kind of game

why did uh

I'm not good at this kind of game

randomly and see how it goes

[Music]

okay let's trade

oh I see I see

see

no I don't want to I can do that

oh not like

wait

[Music]

do I need to

put back if I can attack is that that

the game works

okay

[Music]

efficiently play this game

[Music]

so

but he has been playing by himself

against himself I guess

so he must be a good

so in this case I must use that one here

what happens if you can attack with two

at once

[Music]

yes

I remember saying but I don't like

actually because I I buy coffee

the last stuff

yeah yeah it's about a lot of

finding

Pokemon every now again

I assume wait a minute

now I don't want to build that one

I don't want to move that one

[Music]

I could make this one

[Music]

this one

aha

and if I did that

look at this I'm doing something

[Music]

now I have King spiral

which I probably will never immediately

[Music]

let's move farther down

I mean

faint of

oh no this isn't cute

this one is in the way

no no he he outsmarted me

oh

besides

my Aspire has also been here but

it wasn't as obvious

[Music]

um

[Music]

oh no

[Music]

let's fight

no he was smarter than me

I can outsmart your smartness

aha silly one

what kind of move was that

I guess I'll just

make another one

you have to move that one eventually

let's chase you down

oh oh yeah

but I I can just move one of the other

one and then I'll buy this one and then

you have to move that one well

uh you won the good games final I'll try

to not make it should for you next time

it won't be a next time night it wasn't

such fun of a game I even won that game

not a complete game 100.

okay

yay fight numbers yeah yeah I haven't

played that kind of game

if there are two possible jumps pick one

please send me backwards yeah I yeah I

basically know the game I just didn't

know about that tune

so that's the game

[Music]

thank you everyone for being here and

it's been really fun

so that means I actually have to play uh

next Spire game next week

and what would that be I should lick

that at first

let's let's go to Wikipedia and check

the article of spirogy

yeah

that would be um

when the next game for advanced Spyro

Adventure also known as attack of the

rhino

I have no idea what kind of game that is

maybe it's isometric I will avoid

looking up anything about the game

and it would be a complete surprise to

me what kind of game that is

it will be fun

I will go into the game completely blind

and hello Gage nice to see you that you

still learned

it will be a surprise to me as well it

will probably be surprised to all of you

so I mean if you so I do suggest not

looking up because it will be more fun

that way

thank God you're so inspiring

yeah so far

down the trinity

and then I did play the original

PlayStation one of the first game and I

wanted to play the third game as well

but that stopped working for some reason

and then I done season of ice which I

will claim are completed because the

game ends

it's not possible to continue even

though people have done so it's

impossible to continue

gun season flame Enter the Dragon phrase

is impossible to move to the plate I

just have to find the different versions

of me

and a hairstyle I've completed even

though the game didn't want to give me

that hundred percent I did 100 hit

Legend Spyro which is a new beginning

and turn on they turned

19. so so far the only games that are

left is attacked of the rhinox or

Adventure

Inspire orange or Fusion

for some reason they gave those multiple

names there is ripto's Quest and Shadow

Legacy

so that is four games

and then there are

I've also thought about the DS games for

the Legend of Spyro if they are

different if they are just like ported

versions which I don't think they are

once we'll see

and we'll see how it goes

so I don't think I have anything about

that

oh I can't hey kind of hearing in

so nice of you too

gift

so I wanted to

do a little late

so

I'll try I'll try to think of

I don't know

[Music]

and he is from Austria Australia

for some reason my brows just stopped

working so

yep it stopped working

oh it started working
