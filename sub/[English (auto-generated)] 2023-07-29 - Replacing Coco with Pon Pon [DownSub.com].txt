there we go this is fun fun welcome
sorry for being
quite late two minutes
I actually need to take one moment
[Music]
oh
[Music]
foreign
so today
the goal is to
make this head look like pumpkin head
somehow
got some elements so far
I came in easily
but I find it are the
brows
got everything below so
response has much shorter ones
like fun fun in her underwear
is the reference
so
is Compton's eyebrows
hey refund the first redeem before and
one ends
I don't think refund was the correct
word redeem
the first redeem
the one code first
and you will be the one who was first
meeting yeah I don't have any painting
I don't have much redeems at the moment
it's just it would be more in future
definitely
[Music]
so
I would have the eyebrow here as
reference I think the head size is kind
of good
maybe the head side should be slightly
this morning but that can also affect
the animations and stuff
[Music]
so I'll try to go with like because it
needs to fit the skeleton
cocoa so
so I would keep
so as you can see on the inside of the
head
you actually have polygons of this
eyebrow
that
if animated properly you have hit this
whole back side of the eyebrow Daddy
that you would never see in gameplay
and you also have this upper Edge but it
does clipped through here so here it is
kind of visible
but depending on what animation this is
happening but this doesn't stand out the
wasted Popkins
[Music]
because the only way you would see these
on the inside
hopefully they
when it shows up I need to confirm
uh would be if the eyebrow is moves away
from the head itself
I don't think they want that message yet
like that
okay
I will hide the head for now oh hello
I can
make that one way
that they have more property I guess
there's like this touch
it properly
at
my first posture
okay it's too much effort
[Music]
no that's not to me
let's see
and we usually have regulars here but
they're kind of busy
at the moment which is perfectly fine
it's the same
if you're busy you're busy I respect
that
your life goes go before my knife
foreign
triangulated it's originally made with
squares
kinda
I mean I can kind of see me
quietness of it
[Music]
there you are
perfect
not that I needed to do that across the
housing let's duplicate it he has to
have a copy just in case
hydrating
[Music]
and I'm feeling that I'm starting sixth
words again
so I wanted this
part here
maybe maybe this one part
and see how she has a mustache mustache
no
don't say that
[Music]
it's just
and then that one goes down
and then I basically connect this I
think but not like that
like that
the photo adjustment needed
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
of course this one needs to be moved
quite forward
so it doesn't end up inside the head
diapers are a kind of seats
[Music]
these
individually
foreign
I want to select them on the inside but
I guess I can do that
you know that is a mood right
the Irish position between those two
points don't skip those points by doing
hey individual position that's not going
to change anything
averaging out all of that
and there we go
and a bit awkward looking but
[Music]
now it's quickly it is one piece
it's a bit Tim man
all right
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
thank you
[Music]
I understand one friend
anyway
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
let's see if I can
make vertex Smooths
now let's
just continue what am I looking for
[Music]
is my smarter lips
foreign
so of course
[Music]
now for some additional adjustments
[Music]
thank you
out
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
against the head
and of course a good position
foreign
[Music]
parts
and it's rotating
outwards like that
yeah the original is further down maybe
put
I do think
and do you think it should be better
please further up compared to
Focus eyebrows
[Music]
yeah I don't know if you guys planned
please
those parts has the visual table
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
adjustments
maybe I should just
rotate those in
maybe this is good
how about that
is about to Beach
any size of what Coco has
I need to shoot him like
a reference art of Coco
even though I have cooked model cocoa
the model
um
[Music]
[Music]
let me check there's a back Gallery here
and then escape to
it's about time
instead of just joking
[Music]
do you see much looks like it's been
basically cropped out from
something
[Music]
I carelessly cropped out here it
definitely has
my respect
[Music]
okay let me just take this one then
be there it has
been
in fact the background removal thing
I'm just picky
um to pick it too often
I was going to ask you I was going to
ask why is this there
we come on
yes but that's because I'm currently
that's my musical icon on it
just
oh you want you want a cute outfit for a
bun bun
a nice looking outfit because
there you go
and the
not miss yeah
okay I don't think I need that anymore
I guess I can make cocoa
somewhere at that size
it's hard to how to get the kids size
because I modified model to fit
component mark
yay
so this
yeah
I guess from this uh cocoa definitely
has a thicker eyebrows
I think I still think they had shape in
general would fit ponpon
yeah all the pumpkin does have smaller
eyes
I don't think that matters much
I think it's fine
I do have to
to change the eyelashes however there's
one thing
the eye animation is broken
but that's just how it is in
when trying to modify
all right hello in this error 45
for some reason I want to read as a
Windows server
but then it doesn't there's no V so
and also there's an o letter and the
pink outfit is adorable Oh you mean this
one
it's beautiful that pink outfit with the
heart
well
I'm not sure if it counts this outfit
because it's just her underwear so
but I mean
it's a
it it works as a reference
if you want you can cook
call me sugar
well
it doesn't really fit your username it's
going to be very confusing I won't be
able to remember it
I am picking about
sorry if I'm picking up
it wouldn't be nice with some kind of
nickname system
I guess it doesn't
reality
damn it
why don't you take it back
and then winter is fun yeah you can be
doing this
all the
you can be the whole operating system
if you do hear any interesting username
you'd be fine
is there an interesting backstory to you
in his name or is it just random
it's something like when I was going to
create my twitch accounts I had Travis
coming up to their username but then I
got error for a fine
oh
and I'm interesting interesting I hope
I'm interesting and
I I meant
I'm interested
I have four or five it would be also an
HTTP error code which in this case a
message not allowed
for example when a request is made
but the message of which the requests
is trying to do it's not allowed or
something like that my brother helped me
create after I run out of ideas
foreign
[Music]
My Brother come on Twitter username
once
and actually don't know if he's using it
still but
I did use it for quite a while
and it was quite a unique username
[Music]
which is
why I can't see it
[Music]
and I don't even I don't know if it's
already occupied on Twitch or not I
could check
yeah
let's see
it's loading a page nope
says that the
content is not available unless I have a
time machine
does that means that it has been an
account that has been deleted so the
username is occupied
now it says exactly the same thing for a
username that obviously wouldn't be
occupied
Pakistan his name is free
anyway he came back to you
but now it's kind of represents my
community personality
and my Discord is a sugar represents how
sweet that can be my four four children
oh
so your original was
error 404
or Windows error for even though it's
not the Windows error
foreign
[Music]
yes it's a shame do you think
passwords
my first one of the ones I got most
common
is
yeah
and then with the last password you
would be able to do recovery to email
but maybe last year email password as
well maybe it was the same account kinda
heaviness error 404
something something
and it smells like a temporary email
thing used for sign up which
I wouldn't recommend it for
Nike
if you're going to have an account on
Twitch
since you live Champions League today
recovery and stuff
fully understanding like Junk's website
that you that you just want to create an
account that you're not going to use to
use use a temporary email
yeah but I'm not here to church
I don't even know what email is oh yeah
that's
that's going to be a problem yes I
understand
and often they don't tell me it's like
we have sent an email to the email
address associated with this account
which I cannot understand
but speaking of that there's one thing I
actually don't understand
[Music]
him we better have people here anyway
it's the whole when you do do your
recovery
from an email or something
and it tells you if this email exists
we have sent you the recovery
information or something
and there was a website that didn't do
that and then people will say that this
is a privacy issue and you can just tell
people that the email exists you have to
be vague
but now you don't have to because all
you have to do is go and choose to raise
to a new account and then when you enter
an email it will say this email is
already used and there you go
so a website that tells you that email
is already in use when you raise your
account could just as well tell you that
the email exists on their system when
you do a recovery
foreign
when you're signing up now when you're
trying to log in they also vague with
use name or password is incorrect
instead of telling you
which which is incorrect which they also
say for like security reasons but it
isn't because all you have to do is
register a new account checking the
username or email if that's the login
and see if it's already in use if it is
then it gets you that one is correct
[Music]
so there is no security
[Music]
and if the it is an attempt of security
is there is the worst kind of security
[Music]
and I didn't actually release my twitch
to my newness card
[Music]
that's good I have only this is my only
Twitch account I've ever had I'm here to
Twitch so
and
[Music]
and it's the only account I have linked
to my export
and speaking of Bitcoin
I do have this concern it's very little
activity but it's a nice healthy place
no no pressure to join
only if you want to speak to me on my oh
welcome it is sorry
[Music]
all right
it's a very simple verification process
and that's only
again it's no no form of security
because it needs to go through but it's
it's just basically
prevents like
spam pots and basic rates because they
have to
you can assume a bit of more process
against him
[Music]
our Bots would have to be built more
specifically targeting the severity
so it's kind of fun of Securities
through obscurity
yes
me speaking of it
here it is
[Music]
Windows error 404
[Music]
I guess you're going to keep the
[Music]
the
product for on this card
actually
[Music]
if anything is in the same number
on all the platforms
[Music]
so
I'm just simplifying the polygons here
no
that wasn't there anything no
it's something it's too interesting
very friendly
I have if I have no other choice
to I suppose
it usually like
you're doing a really Brown so before I
find
not really like
it's inside of me
so
great and this part I'm supposed to
remove
because
one Pawn doesn't have
please kind of eyelashes
foreign
not cooperating sometimes
[Music]
[Music]
all the color matches my picture in here
perfect
and I really need a discuss the message
now
not here which message yeah
I really don't do that
but yes
[Music]
I love the color
[Music]
I do think one or maybe five would match
your
background
close but is it but two is a nice it's
it is nice and vibrant red color
a very warm
hot color
[Music]
it fit for an error
and yeah I didn't modify the cheese here
it was a bit into the mask but it really
depends on what the animations looks
like
animations looks like
I decided to go with the environment
yeah it's nice
[Music]
when it's in matches nicely
no
definitely no complete
thank you
um
I do have to do something with it I how
many days are there
so like that
maybe I should load the text shape
I don't think I have
maybe they did they were like yesterday
and I remember anything
yeah I think I got everything here
so if I separate the eye
I'm going to head to oh
so
the the selected part is a separate part
of the mesh of the texture meant
therefore
and apparently this inside it's not part
of the same thing interesting
therefore you get this very very sharp
I guess you could express this as
infinitely sharp line between the orange
and the purple
but as it ends down here it goes back to
the regular texture so this part and
this part has the same the same part of
the texture so you get this blushy
transition
I went
but interestingly how there's a bit of
orange on this separate part
another eyebrow is pink purple it's
pretty nice
let's bring back ahead this looks pretty
nice
how do I do the eye
does it look like when she opens her
eyes
open your eyes
can I load an animation without
everything breaking
let me do that first
foreign
[Music]
all right
this sounds nice
it doesn't
[Music]
finish I don't feel like I need anymore
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
this one should have yes this one is
please get things now if I just take one
of these
[Music]
all right bye
I missed a message no I didn't did
so
I'm gonna switch back to the Dress
so if I think that one day now it has
this
[Music]
[Music]
and yeah
okay that's basically maybe maybe I
created this
[Music]
okay maybe they were occurring because
aftermarket reaction
I don't know
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
if I just move
I just want somewhere in here
[Music]
it would look bad at least
[Music]
because it looks a bit flat there it
looks a bit odd
the way I did that
[Music]
I think it's because of these weird
pictures it's polygons here
[Music]
didn't add any
property
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yeah the smooth thing it Smooths but
it's not really smoothing it out like I
wanted to
[Music]
[Music]
probably get
I was supposed to learn the animation I
was smelling very much because I wanted
to see if I could get maybe the air I
should have completed separate you
should see me like I animation
so where are the animations here
Coco animations
I've watched animation do you use
[Music]
[Music]
cocoa Crush cocoa hang
I haven't named
the Hemi animation
huh
what happens here oh no
oh yeah it's the uh
where's the crush cocoa hanging together
thing no no that's for the name is weird
but it's probably weird
but
we're defining
okay I'm running
wait so this is running this is just
stopping your turn
that's exactly what he's looking for
foreign
[Music]
let's do something about the pain
[Music]
so the tail
this is something
is it there's a lot of Bones here
and the tape would make sense if it's
basically copies
points inside this point
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
so now I can't copy
and then I have
these ones I don't need no more
[Music]
[Music]
which was giving those weird animations
so
let's hide that one
and now when I import
an animation
and
I mean well let's see how long it is
[Music]
okay
plate
perfect can we play with the other
addiction
fine
but what's weird no actually as you can
see here
no
[Music]
no it looks like the eye the eye then
the left eye is working perfectly fine
here
but in game it's supposedly it's a
supposedly broken
[Music]
eyeballs here are procurement
and that's because let's see how how
does the my underneath the division I
gotta do is look over here from him
this is
that go back to original cocoa
and now let's check at the change mode
this
is very curious does it show up yeah
so let's not have texture because it's
easier
so here are the
this is basically their full face
but most of the head
the results so yeah
all eye does not cover the whole eye
what is uh
red
yeah here we go
there's the eyebrow part so it's
basically just
copying what's behind it
I'm sure them
[Music]
from there today
what we do here
of these have existing values but this
doesn't matter
it creates uh
data transfer
into the top
I think what I did just in case and then
I want to copy
the net behind it
vertex group and I'd really like to do
that
upline now
[Music]
if we change
[Music]
now it should match the head there's
exposed
[Music]
and now it should reflect this one more
because usually you get all these every
single that's easy to tell me to use to
wait mean
all groups
[Music]
it's a good idea to have like a small
device you know
[Music]
normalize all
and there you go and not looks like them
not that it needed because I removed MTV
groups
I wish you didn't create the empty your
stupid image
there is a thing to fix that
hey it's still nice to like look at the
result when I'm actually watching
[Music]
I don't need to create the ears
you also need to create
[Music]
okay let's let's import an existing
model
now I
when it comes to modding
since the mod itself is using content
because obviously I don't own fully
owned this cocoa
pon pon final Pond one match because
it's based on I'm too too the Coco
modern I modified it
and I hope that makes sense
technically activation doesn't own it
either because
they own the original model I own the
modifications neither have the rights to
really use it
unless we get both proven and
[Music]
however the classes will only be used in
the crash game itself
it's fair
[Music]
as the model can be used in the crash
game that that's where it belongs
[Music]
this is why I personally don't like
taking models from other games
and put into another game and honestly
honest is the explicit goal of this mod
is to take some something from another
game and put into this game like how I
did work on the Minecraft mod
ding the levels in spiral into Minecraft
blocks
in that case
I did copy the Minecraft textures and
put into them out
so
I did however not extract the action
blocks because the hair is still sucks I
recreated the blocks so they are mine
but I guess they fall under two simply
it's too simple to be incorporated
universally
[Music]
hurry guys
in this case for the foreign
I
[Music]
I'm not expect it okay give me a moment
to expect it
[Music]
my point doesn't work if I don't have
the model extracted
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
character that is called
[Music]
oh my
I don't think the Filter Works
no it doesn't work
have a question doesn't work
[Music]
a lot
[Music]
I should find this character
[Music]
or sorted by
world oh there you go but also sorted
alphabetically
yeah I don't know obviously check that
as each bird like a hummingbird I script
again obviously
you got tea down there t here T is just
such a mess
but anyway polar bear dancing
now that's extracted
I do want to just
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
import and there we go
I don't need amateur
this is attracted from spider
which has a big
oh
maybe I should just take it the one I
got from now maybe I should try to make
it and it's basically the hair but I
want
whatever I want
that's covered its own texture
I know my vision is that
as soon as the morning goodbye
and it's kind of like unsymmetrical by
Design
I kinda
for my own sake
I want the marriage
is a bad option too
you don't make sense
I don't want any leftover gifts from
this model to go on the other model
mirror
there we go doesn't match up perfectly
but
but it's fine
so some changes in my mind
that's how I want
maybe even this part
okay
or something
maybe that was a bit too much
so like that
how did I make it look on
pond
more like I wanted okay
you know what
let's just add it from instead
seems insane
resources
mesh
there we go
foreign
so the point I want to get here is your
name we got tea
what's that as I said I don't like to
import messages from other games however
since this spider game is also owned by
an Activision I think it's fine again
yeah
hello
very nice to see you
foreign
so
why is it like this
is a split into but not merge together
apparently
no
can I
[Music]
just have these many many
I don't know it's
no
yeah probably 18.
Square findings
back from the start eating a block of
gouda cheese right now before I go take
a shower
I didn't
have some machines
anymore that's such a tiny piece left
to maybe this isn't the animal at this
point I don't know how long it will last
for
okay maybe I shouldn't trust it
might be a bit cheese species that was
terrible but no I'm not
now there's several head starts
it never happened
anyway
[Music]
especially these products
amazing squares
and I'm gonna make
your finger what did next week
I don't know
I don't even know what like this
[ __ ] maybe I would have a kiss
it's an entire speed it's a seafood soup
I do like seafood
because I'm Swedish
[Music]
and it's nothing cheap
quick and cuts for that's a lot of
different
sea creatures
the creatures
I wanted to make a point of that but
secret she's turning the sea creatures
they didn't turn out to be much open
[Music]
[Music]
the shrimp still have the shells because
I need those to make the breath
ah
before him challenge but we
if you need them
it's good seeing you manage to find with
that wits
this shrimp work on hamburger should I
that's I like to make my own hamburgers
and should I try shrimp on Burger
I like shrimp on pizza
maybe that's your vanilla
[Music]
[Music]
I'm gonna mess up
so much come and clean them up oh wait
never had shrimp on pizza but I do like
a she has a pizza yeah you do
definitely
no doubt about that
[Music]
[Music]
hey this Band characters adorable
and that's
is actually the character I'm working on
inserting which detects Us in replacing
cocoa from for Hispanic group
with my own first cylinder thank you for
saying that it's adorable
it really makes me happy
and also welcome Space Rabbit Studio
Space Rabbit
he got a rocket man and a Space Rabbit
do you have any more spacing users here
let me check messages
I hope it will be really nice and then
[Music]
there hasn't been any
we don't have to go
[Music]
here to see that
that is the same list
quite a few years it hasn't been acting
for a bit than a junior person I just
saw the spacecraft it sounded for me
I find it something cute
and
let's see why I'm in Japanese mythology
is a story about where I've been
sleeping on the moon it's a technique
there's there's space rabbits
there are it's
maybe it's Korea's important things it's
one there's a few
there's a few countries I wonder if
there's even more countries because the
reason why they have the Space Rabbit is
because of the patterns on the moon
which in some countries considered to be
the man
in on the moon
in other countries sees it as like a
rabbit
human pattern recognition
has no bounds when it comes to culture
if
as far as now that's why in space very
culture
oh yeah the remedy man
and of course a lot of countries also
import from other countries so
Korea might have it from Japan
but yeah
well I should go and get taken I'll be
back in a bit
bring the string into your shower
bye bye
yeah we found a nice showing
it's fun as a show it can be
[Music]
well it will be
it will be fun with more peoples
foreign
so this one should go on the head
no no no see
[Music]
it's quite large
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
it's not missing
never forget
maybe a bit too large
foreign
by making a male skin
the Space Rabbit is making a mouse
that sounds interesting I got first soda
like
this is my first character attempt oh
the same makes people
nice rabbit
any first try this is a mouse
but I'm interested
and if you like to share
what you've been working on
because I do like
like and throw animals I mean I am one
only if you want to see
if you refuse to share it
and
because I did
advertisement description I do have the
description
and when you can when I do have a
channel push up let's be good my music

you have worked on
showcasing
your
[Music]
anything maybe
foreign

[Music]
it makes it easier for everyone
and you can also see
this stuff
I've worked on that I don't I don't
remember if anyone else
I'm seeing in that channel
yeah I have to kind of
I'm back I got
he's not by any messages since we need
to go back and see
the very first drawing I made and then

I'm enjoying the stream from 14 points
is coming thank you
am I
quite difficult person
I feel like I hope
[Music]
yeah I don't think a high energy would
would fit fun fun as a character
[Music]
and then I I see her as a very calm
[Music]
so
[Music]
I want to make this narrow but I want
each step to be
never in their way
[Music]
down here what I need
[Music]
I didn't do both at the same time
[Music]
you can
go
yeah
yeah I think
I think I got something here
foreign
just
therapy to be process but yeah
the the
Mouse girl does he have a name
[Music]
melty
[Music]
thank you
my name is Claire
it's a nice name
[Music]
sometimes if he likes what I think it
doesn't sound your name
but
I'm just a palette
really express myself
incredible probably probably for my
customers
I would love to see how
Trump progress
and I do hope they're rigging
because one
of course
pretty much program you're working and
definitely
that's probably I don't know see
pronounced out I use blending
[Music]
and a drawing
a person I sign up for me
this space rabbit
I can see some
mostly because
[Music]
I don't yeah a very cute one
Nixon
can work it exactly
I respected saying things
the best part about rabbits are the ears
[Music]
so I'd like to use I think
and the dark tip is a nice touch
which is awesome
like I said
origin screen that's what fun fun has
such
large ears
really
sure of course I like watching
and say it's cute proof yeah
I guess in case of
[Music]
oh my
foreign
I guess it's
kind of the same okay
and the uh
there's a term for it
it's kind of thing so it's not like a
ball like
which we said do you like the team but I
guess
isn't as officially exciting yes more
pointy thing
which has more of a shape tape
but it is been a long time making the
taint for
for this moment
if it was a perfect sweet spirit I would
have sent me some work
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so
foreign
I did plan on finding artists
but I I did contact
the injection written on my Discord
profile so in case someone wants to get
in contact with the same person
yeah
I guess I don't have much space but yeah
it's very little because
um thing funny
I listed several
things I wanted with the character and
that's the character that came out
itself
out of that
and I'm very happy with inside
when I started shifted this side
[Music]
is this cute if you see this character
from behind him she would see most of
the time
just these words
maybe another 15 the ears
so there was a few and
additional things are requested
like

thank you
I'm blaming all of you
not but they have
you're probably just going to do that
and then wait normalize all
that way everything is leaking
[Music]
I don't want the animation TV so
it's stretched out
[Music]
so I better be killing me to get to work

and now I don't know what to say
I guess that's just
bye bye
when I'll test out some animations here
it's like stunt run
and yeah it's this animation
okay looking here
it looks weird but
bigger
when
[Music]
it does move like independent which is a
nice touch
but
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]

[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
like that's not animations
[Music]
[Music]
how about crowning because that's
something
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
Ty
I kind of like how it looks
can't do much about
living through the body but
[Music]
that's a knee
brush off the chest that is between
here
I wanted to adjust that
[Music]
this time a nice looks fine
that's a chain working it should just be
attached
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
completely
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you
something like that
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and now if I upload the animation
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
copy
basic that ahead
and
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
very very Generations
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
together
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
oh
let's see how it looks an animation then
or a specific one I'm looking at
which is really
trusting the
extreme is
[Music]
alive because it
here back last time I said I'd be I'll
treat that as it likely
you are back like you said you would be
[Music]
yeah it's not perfect but
not most nice about the stripes are kind
of
I don't know
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
oh
my God
and this is
no I don't think that translation
anyway
let's do yep another test
[Music]
makes it doing the sharps in here
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
yeah I found it
another one because I went
thank you
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
going to be great
as soon as I'm done with the body I can
start doing the articles
[Music]
you get some kind of things I don't know
how to cheat with the herbal
I haven't been
let me add
making lots of promise
and
going for
[Music]
I didn't two and a half hours somewhere
or something
[Music]
so
anyway
let's see if this is more how I wanted
[Music]
sharpness it switches my phone is
charging but I can still use my phone to
type since we should try to chat yeah
they kind of want to remove chatting
abilities from all on some versions of
twitch for some reason
come on
I guess it is more convenient to type on
your phone while you stream I have this
dream going on on screen but
most people but it has caused issue with
people with disabilities as well as
people who just
say potentially
because
my restrict options
this is worse
it has some slowdowns
that's why it's fine
perfectly fine
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
like this is probably
the
[Music]
Run start
[Music]
because it's really stretched out unless
you like that
enough
[Music]
animation quirk
like it's blowing in the winds
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay so I'm motivation explained
I don't know I just don't like her
stretched out it pickups
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
very nice
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
all right
thank you
anyway
foreign
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
imagine this is very
display type these
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
let's try another animation
what's a problem
what is the next red
anyway
[Music]
oh yeah there is there is a section with
the ball and
somehow
end up in a bowl
because apparently being in a bowl is
better than not a human body
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and it's like a
template
like that red hand motion
[Music]
yeah
compressed like that you know
and same with feet here
okay so let me see if I can
do something about that thing
maybe it here's the body
so let's
take the Armature
we said everything
looking good
I think
thank you
[Music]
I did that right now anyway my head is
about a bit late but forget you
so
[Music]
uh
outfit jeans
that's enough that definitely should be
the game
and I guess I only swap around their
outfits while I play
I was thinking about having the outfits
associated with the
outfits did you spot one to wear but I
can't change the outfit on the Fly
that's not an option
what's it like
oh yeah
he's like me
all right in this side I think
being the most naked version
I do wonder if
what kind of messed up
[Music]
this is this is just pelvis this should
be
composed sign
this is a lot of
mistakes
[Music]
so sloppy
[Music]
I'm very disappointed
[Music]
it would be nice keep it for classical
as soon as you change the outfit it
changed the game
[Music]
but I just have to switch around the
outfits as I play the game which is
[Music]
a problem
thank you
okay let's name this
which reference or something
[Music]
one
[Music]
maybe I'll find
[Music]
a different
what's like the
most useful outfit
oh it has for weight transfer
[Music]
oh and this workers this one funny
[Music]
one side
this will be wait
reference two
[Music]
my name is
[Music]
[Music]
slightly missing there but that [ __ ]
the weight should be smooth across your
enemy
yep
so this is perfectly fine
just remove these parts because these
could cause
some odd things to happen but yeah it's
like smoother person but that's no
problem
look at the arms are gonna lips
of course I can't take into this one
okay
you do have an issue when the bone pokes
through the neck
[Music]
but yeah I need to give a skin or
something
that could actually kind of fun today
[Music]
[Music]
wait a minute
please doesn't live in a line yeah
that's gonna
skeleton
so sure she have
yep perfect
I didn't want to look that nice
wait a minute
why doesn't this even have weights
thank you
again
these spots here
[Music]
[Music]
so much nice looking now
[Music]
this is General cleanup
[Music]
all right and then over here
yeah that
the only thing
maybe I should just
you know what it is then
just focus on this part of that part
I had
a blender calculate what the transition
should be
I don't think it won't be definitely
really bad actually I need that better
foreign
let me see if I can import it if I can
find the name of it that's the biggest
question
because the car the name of the models
in the game and the
names of the files are different
so I bought the density one that's
called
subject numbers 372.
that's the name of it
and there is our One Step One is because
it's you could connect it
and because it's more like an alien
and the one that is
what I'm actually looking for
being a
you're actually not now
there's one called that is that the one
I'm looking for
yes it is
it doesn't even look like a bed
but that's what it's called
actually kind of bad luck but it's
definitely an alien
I should show it on screen
someone put a copyright
on the picture
anyway
where's the status
in the picture and here we go
that's the bat I could see kind of but
like in some ways but
it's not it's not whatever you could
call it alien they could call it subject
but now they call it bat
the names are made
foreign
I could see it
[Music]
thank you
look at this claws
anyway
are these parts like
[Music]
yeah I think these are separate exactly
like
right now in fact not
apparently not
I could do them like that
it's like a security
oh it goes around the world it is like a
skirt
obviously
actually I could maybe use this one
tone mesh as the single reference
let me remove some of the
possible
things that could cause issues
[Music]
and then yesterday I started
[ __ ]
[Music]
and
and
everything looks like it
might be a bit more glitch yep that's
the whole head
that's fine
also this is a good breakfast so I
should do the breasts
[Music]
to me
[Music]
this is gonna be a word of reference
zero it's a bit syrup
a little bit because
[Music]
these three things
definitely another pet
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
maybe it's fine
and
it doesn't want your mind so nice entity
I want it obvious errors sorry
I think moist there are spots on my
breast
this looks so weird
I'm not sure if that's
how they want it to be
oh
this is definitely
[Music]
so many errors
I could copy that one
[Music]
no I don't see that it could be that one
[Music]
it's probably the best one to copy but
[Music]
I want to like like nice ladies
split up
be the Middle Point
[Music]
so
[Music]
all right
[Music]
I want to see how this
is easy like
[Music]
this might actually paint
some nice rings
but there is the best are it is still
and here's another spot
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
thank you
okay that's a bit smoothie
foreign
thank you
thank you
I'm more abundanced
[Music]
I guess I can
make me even this one is a bit awkward
technique like this
this is a nice
all right then
I said I wanted to think
the way the chance this man has a bit of
a weapon forever
okay I guess Bob was just scared
[Music]
you're licking clicking away and then
there's a dodging did you meant to put
them in the other recording
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yeah I think
what I need to do is
sure that these are as far
follow that all of that
this is finally
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
okay that's why she's shocked
oh yeah right there
yourself from the mistake
[Music]
oh no she's sneaking away from me
[Music]
[Music]
I'm naughty
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I would apply the changes to this one
Source wake reference zero replace
vertex groups
new space into
generate apply
because that one
[Music]
forgot about that okay let's apply the
mirror ready
now
yeah so that's definitely smooth day
[Music]
okay
the thing is
very lucky everything
and
[Music]
there's a lot of these that aren't apart
but the fingers are looking basically
the same there are basically the same I
guess it's a bit smoother here I think
it's most of his hair
because here is just like dark blue
spots and that's creating this oh
awkward
rangeness here's like a smoothie I don't
know
well it's just this definitely smoothly
for the foot yeah this is a mess of
values
and this is
much better
so
I'm doing back
the mirror there you go
this means that
[Music]
this doesn't look better now
[Music]
so if I were to import it
again the crown I think
sure I mean the arm isn't perfect but
let's see it's not really interesting
but the feet
up there
like that in the region
[Music]
I could adjust this
because
[Music]
the error is doing here that's
basically the air is doing
is that this foot stuff
it's going too high
this this stuff should be a blower
oh
the food stuff is going too high
probably I won't know this is right
like when I was testing 1. before
and there was a lot of these quirks
today everything anyway but it wasn't
like it but not least
but since it isn't too hard to correct
things anyway
why not just correct it
okay first
and
up to this side I think I should go
and then I started
small spots like this
[Music]
[Music]
Maybe
[Music]
all right
she can stick them off or something
when I cut the the meat
there we go
[Music]
I can't wait
now
[Music]
don't worry that's an idea
[Music]
like that
[Music]
oh yeah
[Music]
probably not not sending anyway
[Music]
thank you
and if it looks worse
but luckily I can just
unmute
[Music]
back here and play that transfer again
I'm going to hit talk
noise wait to see
where it takes very disconnected I want
you to remember
Alex
[Music]
back to amateur
[Music]
I don't get sprayed
[Music]
when she can't make stuff in here
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
I just didn't wait because that looks
[Music]
because
what is it
right and
okay
wait
to name
my groups
so I want your personality
let me put it back
thank you
foreign
[Music]
foreign
at least
foreign
so another thing I want to do is the
eyes specifically
is there
[Music]
because I need an animation that has her
eyes open or something and then
[Music]
like like this
thank you
[Music]
these animations
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
against
that looks weird
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
animations going on
thank you
[Music]
I'm sneaking
foreign
[Music]
animation
[Music]
default toes
[Music]
no motion
was it intended speed of this animation
anime
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
okay there's some weird things here
everyone's
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
so it looks like
oh I can't focus on this but
never biased minutes
it's fine okay
it's just a mod it doesn't have to be
perfect
that they want
but I sure wanted like it
foreign
that's not enough
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
perfect
[Music]
kind of here but the regular taste just
Clips through the
absolutely anyway so
so it doesn't matter
I think everything is good
so the only thing I need is basically
well I'm sorry about that
[Music]
and what I really need is some kind of
and
[Music]
which is
what's up
all the difference
and
yeah what I need is really some
animation that
puts her eyes in this open position
remember it's the whole head is moved
actually I can probably fix that by
foreign
[Music]
like that
[Music]
I said that
yeah
that's like
it's a bouncing one
no
there was the
[Music]
definitely 16 that place
eight
wait I was gonna say wait but since
there's a thing I could utilize that too
one day if if the tail is animated
because I can
there's a hat
how many people say
what
like this
no wait what did I do that
foreign
[Music]
basically need to
[Music]
reset the position of
everything that's not
and here's the eyes
foreign
[Music]
thank you
maybe I should reset
[Music]
but basically just want
[Music]
as I want to
basically lock the eyes open because
eyes won't be animated properly
and I
maybe I should add some ears first
[Music]
[Music]
some pumpkin ears
so there's like these ears already
okay what if I import them
foreign
and see how I can work with that
is one of the earliest characters
Maybe
take this Dimension I want
there we go
[Music]
I actually need
competitive tricks
I've been going for it
almost four hours now
a very short break
and that would be bad
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
perfect
you can have Frankenstein I'm guessing
it's not here
so
uh to hydrate I actually need tomato so
I go and get some watery
[Music]
oh
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
um
that's the hybrid
so let's see if I can
okay enough
[Music]
thank you for the turkey
came as soon as I was you back again
soon as I was gonna break
[Music]
so this is actually a news part
so the Bianca model is actually
oh
yeah
oh we
that's actually interesting
[Music]
that these are actually normally they as
you can kind of see I'm not sure how
easy this is here on the screen though
but these lines are slightly thicker
than our own lines
me
is it [ __ ] interesting
but yes I'm going to use
my ears ears
um
which is what I used for the pumpkin
which is yummy
a little Advanced I don't forget about
it
in the mirror
all right
let's go back to this edit mode
and then reference
a e definitely it'll be coming
thank you
anyway
so yeah I did use this for
Mountain
s
combination of multiple stuff
ready to heavily modify them
to see confidence ears are huge
[Music]
but I could just do that but that that
will make it stretched out
enemies
which is my second banana
speaks so cute
yep perfect for uh
someone let's see
it's
definitely be a thing we should
say fundraise
how how should I go about this
nice
I wanted to be playing here but I also
don't want to
distort
no
what about Lassie he said shut up and
take my button
is this on
the closest is that I have it's
this one
maybe that's more than me after
hey
after you give me the money to
because I
presumably for every person I don't get
some royalties
I mean I'll do it is to have the plush
mates I'm not after the royalties
I'll take some royalties to these two
yeah I hope that's making a dream yeah
and make it rain
[Music]
so what you don't
You Don't Want To Make it Rain Over
[Music]
um some activity here I think some
people what
exactly that
I make it rain
I mean yeah
I'll show you I'll make it rain
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
weapons
[Music]
[Music]
when I said I'll show you
[Music]
this just reminds me of the whole
universal law to talk situation
since as you might know
in the original Crash Bandicoot
there was this
very
described sexy
[Music]
but it could the girlfriend of Christ
which they really tried to push the
boundaries
while Universal tell them to think
pretty easy
if not make her so sexy
that's not the dog is I mean considering
the names being naughty dogs
you don't know someone is making a train
I will considered it's actually raining
in the
[Music]
I'm considered if I should do some kind
of Animation regarding that
based on how much it is of course
maybe maybe I should just have the beats
Rain
[Music]
okay
based on how many how much you
base base simply based on the amount
you donate
[Music]
you're working yourself after the
princessy what I see
let's see
[Music]
oh my
he had climbed to the top spot
can't let it make you have this hot spot
I'm able to because I have never donated
anything but some porn
I assume you can
use
[Music]
[Music]
we haven't got tough spots now
since I only gonna share this foreign
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
people
[Music]
maybe it's like a top 10 list I really
want it to be an infinitely
but thank you so much for the donation
thank you
and
here we go
that's a lot of cheering of you just for
today
foreign
[Music]
foreign
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I guess the length of the ears is kind
of good and no one year mode yes he
needs it's visa to help
yeah sadly they are quite spaced but
they know what I mean
[Music]
I guess you can help me write together
and request to add more steps on the bit
sharing stuff
going from 1000 5000 quite a huge step
I'm like a two
thousand five hundred in between would
be something
by the way yeah I mean yes but funny
anyways
[Music]
and we could have
kind of funny like
the the following the subscriber emails
could be like expected regularly
it's tough
and and then repeats emails could be
weird stuff like this here and what
that's kind of funny
and I don't know what else
[Music]
yes what
I'm also wearing all the way
[Music]
shocking
she didn't expect that from here right
[Music]
oh
that's a
nice looking outfit
I will see how
cute I can make it in again then up
I mean
when I get to that point
is what I'm trying to say
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
is this going to be a mod for the
crashing image no it's not the remix
it's it's about time
because it's about time it's made in the
same engine as Spyro which is the game I
have modded
but the Remake is made in some engine I
don't know what it is it's an in-house
engine actually I actually know what it
is
but I don't know how to mod that game
no
yes that's that's why specifically the
address
so um
currently trying to figure out how how
to best do these years what about his
large ears I'll leave the one and see
let's play the mod when you're done do
you have
it's about the time on your
lunch or PC
you do you will be able to obviously I'm
going to play with it first
[Music]
see
but then I will release it
release the pumpkin
[Music]
I think they can have a piece if I ever
played again yeah he fine I have it done
switched sadly you can't use the button
switch
[Music]
but yeah at the base I actually don't
know how often the game
the
database no not that one
theme
that one
I'm looking for
please
okay
well I'll bring this up
[Music]
there we go
wait why isn't
[Music]
it there we go let's pay
so
I have it on Xbox
now let's do
brush anything
wait no uh
yeah the pop-up doesn't shop okay this
is what I'm looking for there you go
there's the one
currently 40 Euro has been as low as 20
Euro or whichever other currency you
want US dollar 40 USD down to
uh
yeah allowance is 20. that's 40.
that's foreign
[Music]
I mean unless this is like before tax
because this is architect so
but here's the irrelevant part
so in July it was insane all right no
yeah it's end of June it was insane
the end of May it was on sale
start of April at the end of in middle
of March at the start of February
at the end of December
so counting from here which has been
basically
seven months
it have been sailor one two three four
five six occasion so it's about once a
month
now it would slightly go on sale at any
time
and when it does you can pick it up for
half the price
did this shot even show me I had to show
up right what's this charge chart
showing chart showing is the price of
the game so it normally as I mentioned
um
40 Europe as shown here which is the
default price everywhere and then when
it goes on sale this was a summer sale
it was a 20.
it was just a general generic same for
20.
and here again and this is the spring
sale
random sail the winter sale
Autumn sale it was just that's three
percent back then but but since then
it's actually 50 everything
indeed I use is there any deal.com for
my gaming
this uh yeah I don't know what that's
website this one shows the sale history
maybe it does too
thank you
where's the same place so yeah it's
kind of useful
if you can see
it represents the timing between these
things are kind of random so
but also that you should see that oh you
should move to Argentina
[Music]
it does it shows
from many
reputable signs man this one yeah that's
good that's good
this one has a lot of other stuff like
uh maybe that's how it has it too I
don't know so then maybe I should show
it for example it has the Lucky 7 bundle
which contains the true crash remakes
Spyro remix and it's about time making a
thousand of seven games
three releases seven games
and it costs normally well with a total
price of everything included is 2019 120
but it has reduced it to 100 not a huge
reduction in price
yeah I was gonna say that it looks like
a very odd stock price chart I was gonna
ask what's stuck at his well I guess
it's the price of the game yeah I don't
think that's a stop now it's very easy
oh Stella welcome
because I need to pick up this time with
my image level and I was going to say
this
pack
which cost 100 normally
and drops down to
38 and a bit
I assume presumably the same price in
USD I don't know which currency do you
use actually because I can't remember
you and where everyone is from
I think
and there he
quickly saying hi are you happy
something color
uh going food shopping with so young oh
you're going
going you put food hopefully you find
fun what you're seeing
yeah
it's already 68 off which is a bigger
sale on the games individually
but that's based on the initial price oh
yeah but yeah
which makes sense I guess
that's the percentage I don't know
maybe 68 of the discounted prices are
already at discounts price because here
it says zero for discounted price
so yeah it must be
what's up
it's a very okay
not available in Russia
so yeah so that's the games included
games included
and yeah
that's that let's get rid of this stuff
enjoy your shopping I hope
I hope she enjoys the shopping
but nice nice to see some familiar
faces okay
familiar names
doing up
slight tweets here and then
yep
maybe that's better
[Music]
but yes uh if you're going to play
inspire
if you let's
if you if you tell me I will definitely
be there watching you stream
whenever you stream this
if you tell me when you streamed this
bottom ends
preferably ahead of time
I will try to watch it
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
enjoy watching like whatever you see
but it's always getting more fun than if
it's something I'm very experienced with
it's the safety person playing is very
inexperienced and making a lot of
mistakes
I'm an only person who really lets
people like explore the games and take
their time and do whatever
yeah I would love a new spider I wonder
if I don't know if that happens it will
never happen
[Music]
I'm really not expecting
another spider game for any long time
[Music]
even though it's kind of going the same
route as scratch
that
and
the crash remakes were released first
despite not released it's crashed away
for announced first and then decided to
like
why not spy remix too
[Music]
and then scratch got another game but
nothing would expire and crash cuts
another game
another remake and another game but not
nothing a spice bar isn't getting
anything
hey
I hope they will switch I think here I
beat the spider games all before okay in
that case you are experienced another
person okay maybe hello I'm here for a
little bit yeah you're quite basically
didn't and you're hard working I'm very
very proud of you being so
dedicated to her
[Music]
dedicated
I'm very happy
to have found kitten
[Music]
even
it's a nice and cute
I think I found the
the by finding what's basically making
coming in here and using the boxing
parts
and then
[Music]
started using empty
and it's really it really fits
eaten
[Music]
[Music]
um
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
and on the chairs were bless me
suspicious a wet spot that's changed
that's so cute it's not cute I'm making
a mess here
with you and yours too click on get cute
oh you haven't been 60 minutes and
that's instant was supposed to be
what's that
let's see
now
the ears still need to connect to the
head somehow
and I also can't not
[Music]
these things
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I bet I can't spell it
wait there's nothing cable
interesting
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
as I suspected
okay yes now I lift it up
[Music]
but because I said Revenge
and
the Swedish word for
rematch is Revenge
which is what the English word Revenge
so yeah so it's a Swiss revenge and
English Revenge both come from French
not Spanish
which Inspire in Spanish I said it again
in French it means both revenge and
rematch
but of course then the question is but
hey what's the word in Swedish for
Revenge then
that's where it is
it's a complete different word
thank you
[Music]
and
which comes from heaven
[Music]
I doesn't really see where our wire
comes from more than remote noise that's
a saint
that's a shame
shame
well the Swedish word is this one and
what's interesting but this this word is
I don't shape is interesting it's it's
the it's the consonant cluster of m n
and D
okay so it's hemmed just is that series
of consonants are there and
can you say Hammond
it just sounds weird
Canaan
quite nasally I guess
because it's m and n
[Music]
but because
Swedish isn't
crazy about the clusters of consonants
there's actually a different variant
with this word
which is
hemmed
Hammonds is just
Revenge
with like
revenge and not plural but
I guess you pronounce it a Revengers or
something or Revenge Revenge is I don't
know
um
the ownership the Revenge owns something
you know what it means
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
quite big already but
[Music]
I can't make the ears even bigger
[Music]
laughs
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay thank you for the lesson you're
welcome
I'm here to teach you a Swedish if you
need me
[Music]
I'm happy
[Music]
to let you know anything you want
[Music]
okay I have an idea
let me duplicate these as backups
what I'll do
[Music]
[Music]
it I have an idea how I'm going to do
this
[Music]
um
[Music]
I'm arriving
not the chance pretty weekend so I can
play games that's something many words
with that
I can imagine it being nice
[Music]
I mean
but time is for yourself
[Music]
your wife and I went out to dinner with
another couple last night it was nice
a couple lists in there
that are some really nice
invite me
[Music]
um
[Music]
okay
what kind of food was there
you know restaurant food
[Music]
we went to a club that made a
flatbread's own
but that sounds interesting
[Music]
I like bread even though my rabbits
and I like flat six
[Music]
that was a damage
it only sounds good what is flatbread
even let's spread I mean aside from
bread being played
not bread that was first sourcing each
other
um
[Music]
flatbread is a breed made of
Platinum flour water milk yogurt oh
yogurt or other liquid and salt and then
thoroughly rolled into
flattened though many flatmates are
unliment
more fancy words
and even bread is any of a wide variety
of breads which are prepared without
using Rising Asian certain means okay
although some are lemon okay
when you're on demon some are leaving
meaning that
all flatbread are leaving or unleavened
covering everything
such as pita bread I think I heard about
pizza
black breads range from Below
one millimeter
that is seeing 30 sick and that's very
sick
now that they can be easily eaten
without
remain sliced
they can be baked in the oven fried in
hot oil grilled over hot coals cooked in
on a hot pan
and eaten fresh or packaged and Frozen
for lady used you can basically cook it
however you want and eat it however you
want
there is no restrictions
the back to the conversation
went with my brother and his wife to an
all-you-can-eat sister restaurant last
week I would like that too probably it's
like sushi it's like three times more
expensive than like pizza or something
do three times but have a pizza person
maybe they're on par with sushi I
haven't checked it
uh it was nice I had nice chicken oh I
like chicken I basically yeah I can eat
whatever
I think maybe I think crust picks up a
square
second be square
I was left around it again put anything
on it anything anything on pizza too
okay the question is how does this
differ from Pizza
that's that's the question
right do they have anchovies
they did not but I don't see why you
couldn't make one with them now I'm
getting it me too
all the time I can't I can't ever happen
chips and pizzas when I'm making myself
but make it yourself
we should we should make
no one ever has to we should make our
own pizza the kitten are you up for
making your own pizza
[Music]
fried rice okay
[Music]
I wanted to make pizza okay if I were to
make my own pizza is there any kind of
quite clearly outside I've got this
straight away that is there any topic I
would want to
Vermont to put on my pizza that I
normally can't get from a pizzeria
oh
swatchway
I love pizza and I love to make pizza
yeah
it's like to have a pizza that you would
normally get from a pizzeria or other
tasted shrimp now shrimp is common
I can that's like it doesn't like how I
have shrimp on pizza and lucky
and shrimp of pizza is called let me let
me bring up a pizza place that
I've been to
let's see
oh they have a hole
okay I want it like
okay wait
how do I
I can't find find the tunes uh this is
Swedish because I'm in Sweden yeah
I mean they don't have menus
oh
shank beats isn't normal enough top you
can get here like actually
I can only speak for obviously here
I like my pizza with mushroom a lot of
meat
sure and you could also take regular
toppings but make it in a way that
normal isn't made
wait what is it too many options oops
there are so many verbs you cannot find
content
and
okay let me search for like
I'm getting hungry
fifth
okay I I found I found a pizza place
um
thank you
we got margareta
wait
I guess I guess everyone
Pizza contains
tomato too much tomato
and oostage cheese but anyway
so this is the market this basic
tomato and cheese and then we got
Vesuvio with Pam Hawaii with ham and
pineapple
Capri capricious
with ham and
champignon mushroom
but it's specifically the champignon
I remember looking at pizzas
with salami and onion
hey girlie so somewhere it's a very
similar in English
tomato too much
salami salami
but some words are very different
usted cheese like onion
that's a
it is
Opera with ham and tuna
then we got busula with ham and and
shrimp
banana with
ham banana and Curry
powders
thing
tropical which is pineapple banana Curry
let's confessed tuna yeah if they're not
a banana banana vegan me
Maria
marinara with the shrimp and mussels
a Samia I should practice my
pronunciation
um
salami
mushroom and onion La Mare ham bacon
salami and onion Bella
ham extreme
and mushrooms
and then it's like calzone what do you
call it
is like
um
oh yeah concern is is the one that's
what you call it in English
in
baked in which is notified which is just
a ham
and consonant special this place has a
special with shrimp
because she shrimp I guess it makes
sense like Sweden being like seafood
gondola
mushroom and shrimp
I don't know
what what I'm really curious about if
the names of these pizzas
are like common like how are you sure
that one you know and Bolognese is just
a bowl of it's like just like you can
have a spaghetti bolognese this is a
pizza Bolognese
foreign
names but I do recognize these names
this seems to be the common names yeah I
got a pizza I don't know there seems to
be a special one salami
pepperoni onion
and garlic would you we call it white
onion
and the garlic sauce if you have some
especially for the head
cheese
is there a terrific
olives onion a paprika you kind of bell
pepper or something or is that a
difference in public health
and fresh tomatoes
that sounds good Tony special
in English right it's very special
everything
a vegetarian how a vegetarian is this
and it's not vegan because it contains
cheese
a mushroom Olive paprika or onion
pepperoni
it was
that's kind of uh kind of a pepper type
right
I don't know if that's what you call it
in English you know like pizza me too
this is just a name this must be someone
who asked for this
bacon egg black pepper and onion
so why would I recognize that
he might looks really good breakfast
pizza
someone someone named ingamar came in
and asked for a breakfast pizza
that's obviously not the breakfast pizza
here
but is it like
breakfast in different countries
yeah
would be assumably the five cheeses no
it's not
when boys I do know I caught Quattro
that is why divinity
maybe that has a different
maybe that one's like cuatro questions
or something
I don't think I know cancer from Spanish
I don't know if that's Italian
now this this one has five toppings at
least I think outside one is standard
ham shrimp mushroom and mussels but a
lot of these have like this one got
I might I made four toppings this one
got five toppings
I know I know I I selected four toppings
and said five
um I messed up
yeah but this must be Italian I mean it
makes sense
let's start this special ox
ham jalapeno which day dish
taco sauce
garlic sauce
I'm gonna make it
[Music]
enough
Next Movement I have never been a fan of
muscles of clams textures to wear to me
that's what I'm worried about the
detection of it would be red the garlic
sauce that's good but then we got Lady
Diana
now we're going to air Ox ham tomato
onion and
what do you call it in English
[Music]
Bernice
but this list oh it actually ends here
yeah I don't know what's what LC stands
like
the other jalapeno taco sauce I mean
I'll try it it sounds interesting
and then it's like yeah we've got the
Kebab Pizza
which is Kebab on the pizza
and then it's like tomato pepperoni
onion and
garlic garlic sauce
and then they have the special here with
with the lettuce and
cucumber
and the city version
which they
[Music]
do
what is City because this one is the one
I know about and I'm pretty sure
Stockholm is a city
but maybe maybe this like inner city or
a different city when they just came up
with ham over the mix and mix meat like
that
a mushroom onion and garlic sauce
and then you got the Mexicana
which is meat meat sauce
it's basically the
foreign
chicken
yeah
stuff
onion
I mean onion olives and mayonnaise
I'm going back to work now I hope you
have a good day today yeah I'm having a
good day kitten bye everything I love
you have fun and keep nice of you to
stay back stay by come by taking your
time
from your break at work I see
really nice
it's an Italian seafood soup made with
shrimp nuts and Scoot and cut
I'll try it it has some nice I like
there is a thing I
let me look it up
um great okay let me
hi this is just in case
it's called Uh
and
can I find a good picture that
represents it's what I'm used to
be here we go it's basically close to
what
it's been
there we go how about this one
what's this
what's the selling Swedish pizza now I
just went through what pizzas we have in
Sweden I was I want TV Pierre based on
repair ursini
that's up to you and I can't remember
what he said
but I'm not in the mood for pizza right
now but I am
but I don't feel like get one
I'm fine with getting a pizza but I
don't want to go and get a pizza
that's sleek
what's wrong with pet slick
we got on a pizza pension here what
would you call this in English
it got it got
it got mashed potato
shrimp
and he got cheese
competitive other things here I don't
remember seeing English name for but if
I look it up
it's probably going to be very obvious
what the English names for those things
are
the first thing written there is bleach
okay that makes sense I know that word
and the other one is
here we go
it's another word I usually used to
describe
well it's uh
why not it's for a party
no they don't need
I I think it's like
uh
that's open
oh it's cut
place is that what you call the Fish
oh they want shrimp which channel
parmesan
Parmesan Parmesan I don't know
butter mayonnaise
Citron juice no lemon juice
thank you
and it's a Citron
is actually if I if I look up the
the
Wikipedia for lemon
it's a citrus lemon
so calling it a Citron
which is called Citron in Swedish it's a
perfect name because it's just combining
those two words into a new it's a it's a
portmantle
I do know that and because someone told
me that's it no
a Citron is an actual thing in English
Citron but that's a citrus Medical
so
that would be
citrica or something
and the Swedish name for this one is uh
Suka Citron
true
Citron if you want but but this is a
citrus medical this is not a citrus
Limon
anyway enough of food and edible things
I'm hungry now
that's why I went through these tangents
lemon butter
parts
oh yeah oh yeah I see what you've seen
so by putting the bow closer together
like this
I should be able to fit in the ears
behind the boat
[Music]
or something
yeah
period of time to realize
what people wearing was
I'm a bit slow sometimes
foreign
[Music]
but yeah the original question Still
Remains and I guess
Ethan is gone now so I'll ask him later
if it's something
basically if I were to make a homemade
pizza obviously I would take the
obviously it's not effective right here
it's kind of waste to me yeah it's I've
wanted to take the opportunity
to put use toppings on the pizza that I
would not would normally not be able to
get
at the restaurant
and today Pizzeria but considering the
those special names that I like in
Myanmar was the one and
which they really should call something
else
but it is
the bacon breakfast
described him
yeah
whatever I'm on at vodka what kind of
vodka yeah time to move
yeah very polished problem yeah
um
so what's the toppings I would put on
our pizza
that oh no I may not get that right
that's that's the little topic uh Oregon
has said that he wants and and show it
since it was because that's not
something he can really get
um
I don't have any rum either oh
and actually no I was thinking about it
oh no oh no
how about
tuna
I think because I think I like tuna
pizza and shrimp because that's like two
Seafoods in one
say something more I would like shrimp
and tuna
because I do like shrimp and pineapple
but pineapple and tuna
maybe that works
but I don't need pineapple but even
though I do like paint but it really I
really I really do like the taste
and texture of pineapple a pizza
yeah polish problem actually
well
they are like both number one I feel
like vodka is like
maybe that maybe that's more like the
general Lobby
problem number one
the Piero
hirogi is also in a few like what campus
there are some variants sometimes I
think in English you can spell them
differently depending which country of
origin it is or something it's confuse
me but if I ever had was cheese ham
shrimps Curry
and garlic sauce
are that many of them yeah they're like
extra of them
I'd like to make some peony but it is
never any room to make the dough so I
can't even make but make sure
take the
be the one in my dream
what do you want to make I like Maker's
cheeks so much smaller do I die
like that
should I had to be I can't really look
at something from his side should have
really go out this far behind I don't
know maybe
if I remove this stuff
should I should have had
should I had point out this much we
should die
do something about that
can't even make sausage
because there's no room to set
everything up
quiero keep
it
was a finished problem number one yeah
that's kind of what I meant like the
different countries have kind of come up
with both the Vodka although in Sweden
is called a brand been so
burnt wine or
Brandy is kind of thing uh but this is
basically vodka
ingredients wise if I understand it
correctly correct me if you're wrong we
do have absolutely
but it's like kind of invented
Independence or kind of inspiring each
other but this differences
um
so there's like multiple pierogi you
know
foreign
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
let me let me know I actually don't know
if it's if the head is to point if I
should flatten
you know
yeah maybe it's maybe it's too flat on
the back there
[Music]
maybe it's maybe this would work better
for the
punishment but have you tried other
countries podcasts
or is he says that a national scene
foreign
[Music]
because
like as I've said before the the
chocolate I like the best is
um it is a faucet I said fossil which is
a Finnish brand
and the second best
uh
I think I had is
[Music]
uh
admirable no not my I'm fine with
moderable uh
but it's not it's not like
[Music]
so milk yeah
is actually a portmanteau of a milk
which means milk
so milk you can say in English too and
cacao
which in Swedish is cocoa so his wish
would be middle car no that's not her
apartment the milk guys milk cocoa Coca
or something but that's fun it's sweet
[Music]
um
chocolate
it's a Swedish brand
but
I'm fine with it like
and I usually pick it because it's good
for surprise but
it just doesn't have the same taste
it's milka milke is pretty good for his
price too
but I've had trouble finding it
[Music]
I don't know if this is bad
all right if I'm messing up the head
okay yeah but I try Swedish vodka
[Music]
I'm I'm not I'm not a podcast but so I
don't know
that is a mid-rise brand of vodka owned
by New York based constellation Brands
yeah that's not a Swedish
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
brand made by fifth generation 500 by
Tito beverage in Austin Texas
so and again that's a U.S vodka maybe
you should try like
not to use but maybe maybe vodka in the
United States sucks
that's what I heard about the chocolate
that is supposed to start taste like
puke because it contains some chemical
that also contains it is in puke
which is what gives this smell which was
made used as a preservative which is not
used in Europe
therefore European chocolate taste
better but people in the United States
are just used to it
and that's what they expect with
chocolate to taste like and you and it's
like it's
[Music]
foreign
yeah it's a Swedish brand maybe you
should try absolute vodka
actually Swedish vodka and see what they
think
press it for her yeah I mean I cannot
say why is that French vodka crazy cues
that doesn't sound French
[Music]
I'm still working my way through this
green juice is a bird
[Music]
Gray Goose vodka here we go
all right
it's an actual French Market even though
the name doesn't
probably is this word French too
so I should not pronounce it as a green
goose
um no gray is not a French word
and goose is not the French word
[Music]
it is produced in France
uh it is it's just created
[Music]
by Sydney Frank
[Music]
born in Connecticut United States died
in California United States
um
so
where did
[Music]
so he developed it in France
yes he's a businessman
oh
so it's technically still never ever
made by someone from the United States
you're never getting away from United
States with your voice care choices you
have to you have to try something not
made by or in United States
so what is so the conclusion so far is
vodka from United States or made by
someone from United States but and that
sucks but this person
okay
I'm not fond of Father's Side yeah
that's true it's fine
my problem first is too expensive but
it's not about very important yeah
the body says it's important from Sweden
um
[Music]
suspicion
uh is it made in Sweden
oh
okay so apparently it originates from us
from small small bedroom
see the sharp pain Sweden
however it is unknown in Sweden
basically
but then it was acquired
my constellation Brands were 384 million
US dollars
um
okay so it's actually
yeah
um however however
it is not I have allowed to be it could
be be
distributed under the term Swedish vodka
because that is a protected designation
according to EU rules
and must meet certain requirements what
is it failing on
[Music]
Swedish national food industry believes
that landmenon violates some of these
requirements when the company
transported the concentrated 96 alcohol
to United States
to be diluted with water there
so it's basically so so it's not like
it's it's not vodka produced in Sweden
is its its concentration produced in
Sweden transported into United States to
be diluted with water to be sold as
vodka in United States but but it's
considered considered to be violated the
term vodka it's in Sweden
something I don't know
that's what I meant
um
back to the conversation you're way far
ahead of me currently and the place uh
yeah passed in the place I would be
going to today if the business trip
hasn't been canceled
good thing it was because I wouldn't be
here isn't going to ask him right now I
guess that's a good thing I guess if you
want to see I can drink Vodka unless
it's heavily mixed in I I just
personally
don't drink alcohol and stuff I don't
understand I think that's bad case is
Swedish actually yeah eight is better
yeah
[Music]
shopping
it's like West Coast
did I say lean shopping when I read this
because lean shopping is another place
there's Lee shopping and Lead shop is it
lead chirping or something I don't know
shopping lead shopping
I I have pronounce it carefully
foreign
[Music]
and you know what I think of associating
I'm going to say it you can't associate
ethnicity over a nationality with how
you can
help with preferences
or like I can't handle vodka because I'm
this ethnicity or nationality
shown that there is more variation with
within and ethnicity than
trying to fight
[Music]
basically you're not more likely to be
able to handle
manage both care easier because
if you're
foolishness
it's just that you have
trained yourself into being able to
handle
which I'm assessing Polish people do
so I guess there's a point that's a
point
[Music]
I don't know maybe 12 responses to your
bloodline number
okay if I if I try
tolerances passes through your bloodline
I'll take that
is alcoholism
hereditary or genetic tolerance result
from drinking substance amounts of
alcohol over long periods of time
however are called intolerance may be
generous genetic
most commonly seen in those in Asian
descent alcohol intolerance is when the
body has an adverse reaction to presence
falcon
something
[Music]
however
your polish bloodline
okay sure
yeah this was Article Thomas and
certainly influence your choice
of
consumption of alcohol which has
increased your alcohol tolerance so I
guess you could say indirectly
[Music]
but I am not a person who is fan of
[Music]
using pseudoscience so
[Music]
this is out
[Music]
I'm not going to do it every time
but only because you did it in a chain
and and now
it is a difficult topic because I'm
perfectly fine with making jokes about
it
[Music]
but because there is no scientific proof
that the in that tolerance is
inherented
in hereditary
and it shouldn't be past Papa
would you say that pasta passed off as
facts
unless it can be proven otherwise
[Music]
and of course
your polish bloodline and you being able
to
1200 tolerated and your co-workers who
aren't able tolerated too exactly don't
have a polished bloodline
is not a piece
well it said something about intolerance
being yeah intolerant but that's of
course a different thing is it's quite
different being intolerant and I'm a low
tolerance
sorry I can't think about it because I'm
a particular interest yes that is true
I mean where's my non-political I don't
have that benefit no that's no no now
you're now you're going after so it's
something that isn't true therefore
content
unless your speed no no so now you're
now you're incorrect
intolerance was not a non-polishing it
said Asian
so unless your co-workers are Asian
which has nothing to be non-polish
but being Asian
I'm not used to seeing the world is just
polishing Asian but that's not the world
so no
for some reason
I I got very warm by speaking of food
let's spray that out let's see
I think that's better
maybe I want to move that 19 more
rejection
hey
[Music]
back to the bow
and the ears
I think I don't know my co-workers drink
more than I did believe it or not and
they still can't handle vodka so this
could be something around
maybe yeah
as you said you prefer not mixed and
isn't and I'm not an alcoholic expert
but unless unless you can provide
you know
and actually
the worst of facts that that's an actual
thing it's I'm not going to considering
actually seeing
but um but yeah
what's like
a vodka percentage
thank you forty percent
[Music]
standard vodka has been 40 alcohol by
volume Okay so
they didn't plan to order stickers
whiskey okay
risky percentage
hmm
40
460 two and a half
tequila what did we represent
yeah I just I just had to check that
so
I don't know
maybe they haven't intolerance
but
as far as I can see it has nothing to do
with inheritance
but as I also said
inheritance in in
you know what I mean
[Music]
but that's also said there is you still
have genetic variation
so maybe you have a higher tolerance
because your youth
I mean
I don't know I can only I can only know
what I can read
[Music]
and I can search for that specifically
too those holes have a higher tolerance
too I'll go home
[Music]
ah I can't spell tolerance
well first first thing there's not not
any clear scientific proof coming up by
starting this term
last time we went drinking at the very
moment I bought a round of trademark
containment maybe they are they are not
drinking their Liquors straight maybe
they have whiskey mixed with like 50 75
of other stuff in that case it's not
long if it's 50 other stuff there 50
whiskey is now at 20 drink
is that
and if you do your 40 did I say
they're 40 whiskey
a mixed 50 is a 20 drink now and if you
drink your vodka straight you have a 40
drink
when I was only in fifth round not even
started training
sounds like you are drinking more than
them by these
and honestly I mean how do you know how
much they are drinking
maybe you are drinking one of them maybe
they are only drinking
their apartment means
I don't know these terms
and I'm losing my voice
okay part of my skin is like the 40 then
it's short a mess
whiskeys so it's still 40.
I don't know
maybe they are only drinking while
they're out and you are drinking well
you're home and they aren't maybe that's
a thing
I don't know
[Music]
maybe there's uh something yeah
because and maybe this is some kind of
chemical reaction between
when I'm not thinking anymore today
it's easy you're drinking so much you're
running out of it
sadly you must be thinking more than
them
maybe you should track about your drink
and ask them to track how much they
drink maybe we'll discover something
plus then then like
if you really want to go there I'm not
lying argument you also have to consider
how much of your blood is polished oh
Saturday
[Music]
in two weeks oh
oh
[Music]
so long
who are you
okay
you must be sick at the moment she must
go and get the
vertically like you have the
bag of blood pumped into your body you
need a bag of alcohol
straight into the blood
well I'm actually kind of surprised I
guess why
because you know how much you speak of
it sounds like you
you have it
maybe not every day but
every weekend maybe
in this weekend
and you came unprepared
[Music]
and I wasn't feeling well two weeks ago
uh
did something I never did to drink
straight from bother with you need to
listen dancing
okay that's
that's
[Music]
oh
I I don't know how to get respond to
that
thank you
[Music]
my name
yep
this was fun
speaking of fruit and drinks
I kind of want food now because I'm
speaking so much of the food
and I'll be going on for almost six
hours now I kinda kinda as as planned
and I got the ears so you know what
I'm gonna take this
[Music]
I'll test this thing in the game
no only reason that stuff when I did was
everything is I spent like what's on
fire I almost started one let's just say
spinning it back out
that's
I think
take it easy
don't do anything too interesting
but that only left me with us one amount
left in the bowl which I just finished
today
[Music]
was there a reason for your
foreign
[Music]
now I will export this one
I think
I can press that so I just put it
our search export this as a version
no I haven't started if you feel
anything
[Music]
[Music]
so
I got my trusty carrot pointy
he even got it
but anyway you made a missing progress
today thank you
I did quite some
so I really want to see how it looks in
game
and then I think I'm done for today I
got more tomorrow finish up attaching
the ears
and the test will also reveal if the
eyes are working maybe the eyes are
working now maybe it's or because they
do work in animations
but I don't think they work in name
some reason that's the idea for why I
want to do like
remove the animation of the eyes and
like
fix that and make the eyes or constantly
open meaning that you can no longer
blink but I don't think crash can blink
I should probably stop talking about my
drinking habits before I almost
have you
made a checkup on the health of your
liver I mean I don't know if that's a
good thing to do
[Music]
seems like something I feel like I
wanted to
do if I really want to
drink was consuming something that is
commonly known as hurting a body part
maybe everyone is actually honestly
probably consume stuff stuff that hurts
certain body parts of mind
that I haven't been productive
I wish you everyone my liver is probably
gonna die within a few years and then
it's giving me
that doesn't sound good
why why are itself
where is the casual
[Music]
yeah
well
[Music]
I guess I guess at the same time it's
gonna self
connected
but I was thinking if if going to a
doctor is going to be like
another thing like maybe they can give
guidance of how much it safely came from
him
[Music]
oh it's it's starting up good
can I bring it up here
open project
I'm always special about my own
Misfortune I don't get anything
[Music]
in moments where I basically haven't had
any money for food and basically running
out of food and
nope
[Music]
foreign
delete old versions
[Music]
and then I will locate
locate
the current latest version
finds loading
[Music]
and this pop-up is
[Music]
now in this menu as an existing skeleton
and for material search location is all
acids
and an import
and hopefully it should only show two
fats if everything went correctly
importing it says 100
but it's still working
so I actually got
two additional ones but that doesn't
matter
I just met everything together here
place
[Music]
everything into one
[Music]
and then this one should be called SK
cp3704
um
[Music]
and this one is going to be called
exactly the same thing but with ph
pink h
and then
fix that reject this just be
safe
