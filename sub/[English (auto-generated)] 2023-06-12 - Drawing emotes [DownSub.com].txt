foreign

[Music]

hello everyone

unorganized now I feel it

I'm getting stuff

getting a bit late with my snack before

the stream steam has already started

[Music]

well the idea was to

[Music]

do more

emails

so let's load up the previous one there

we go

previous ones I made

[Music]

so I have

I said six

um

subscribers slots until we fill the meat

and the current code can I get the girl

to show up

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

okay I could make it appear like that it

should have already been enabled

but yeah I got 18 out of 30.

with subscriber points

[Music]

when it reaches 30

70 subscriber sloppy when you open up

happy to see you here

[Music]

so I need to decide

which one sound she didn't know and why

is this one oh another person

foreign

[Music]

I am definitely doing better today I

have I was the last at the end of last

week I was kind of feeling down a bit

and might have been noticed on my

streams but I'm definitely feeling

better now a bit late

and organized with my streams but that's

that's typical of me

did I spell that right that is how you

would spell my name so good

evening

I have written it on my about page

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

yeah

so basically just short bounce all

together

[Music]

I've had like one person say every line

or something like that

just sounds weird

probably because that's not my name

it's probably a proper name

okay if that's the same

it keeps

right there I can disable it

thank you

sorry for the slow preparations

foreign

so yes so like

blushing from lewdness how would I even

draw that

I do kinda

because

sometimes I might make a silly

joke

implying stuff but

[Music]

foreign

let me

[Music]

look at the beautiful references I have

they just get an image in my head for

how to draw it I do also want to draw

upon from with the pom-poms because

that's what what her name comes from

[Music]

that's

[Music]

that's an obvious one

[Music]

another

it's messing around with stuff in the

background so

[Music]

it should be like

that's a problem using her ears the head

was cute oh yeah yeah

that

that like that's true

[Music]

let me see

[Music]

I'm done with my snack now so

[Music]

we eat

okay I'll actually separate tablet

a Mouse drawings let's be

[Music]

hmm

if you have if you want to draw an email

of mice you should you must use your

computer mouse

[Music]

okay

[Music]

okay

ages ago it's been it's been six days

far and a half if you want to be picky

no

no I have like a general dancer instead

of pump on here

[Music]

and then like

[Music]

because the edge can't cover like all of

the face

[Music]

because you need to be able to see that

she is or I am blushing

again

[Music]

that I can imagine

[Music]

I'm raising the drawing everything on

the same layer again remember tendency

to do that sometimes

sometimes I want to move stuff

[Music]

like these hands

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

yes they will be

more fun yeah like I've done four before

quality of the stream is good by the way

yes this would be

because I'm only drawing I can actually

increase it a bit more as it looks nice

day

I hope everything sounds fine and it

looks fine

[Music]

if there is any issues do let me know

so I can look

look up some stuff

[Music]

do something easy I can't just quickly

fix it on screen for example if my voice

is too quiet it's probably because I'm

speaking too now

so I guess you could basically just

tell me I'm

mumbling again if that's the time

I have a tendency to do that I've

noticed sometimes I can't even

understand my cell phone

after listening back to my my recordings

thank you

that gives me some positivity

that makes me happy do you know

[Music]

I'm happy people just enjoyed to be here

just being around here

is the most nicer than for me to just

sit alone and draw everything

[Music]

[Music]

different every time

[Music]

okay that's the general idea for me

[Music]

again

still moving on to

a bit more

detained part I need the point

my friends

I actually got a new head

seriously where did I begin

the method there would be carried out

anyway

[Music]

they moved when I do something

embarrassing

[Music]

the ear is quite big

imagine

this is a big year but maybe something

should be showing

let's get here for

do you want to make this more obvious

[Music]

thank you

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

yeah if I hide behind my ears you can't

see me

[Music]

I don't exist at that point

oh this this one what became a bit

strange looking

thank you

so

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

energy we copy and paste

[Music]

and then there should be some hands

again thick hands

I'm going to try

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

this became a bit of a mess but

[Music]

hello hello

[Music]

that's something right

I don't maybe even make it work

[Music]

s

maybe something like that

I mean it doesn't work

but

[Music]

[Music]

if this works I think

night

adjustments

Maybe

[Music]

I keep forgetting you can press space

and scroll down that thing

[Music]

[Music]

I don't know if I should

at a shoulder or something like

Maybe

it would be behind the ear but

it should be like a shoulder or

something showing

the bottom part of it

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

and we're done this

did I do like

maybe I should add the eyes

I beat a lot of stuff and

even

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

when uploaded it

[Music]

when I went ahead one one image so far

one emote

[Music]

and that should be

being did it too

[Music]

like that

[Music]

perfect now it's not perfect

ah from perfect

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

I just can never draw some

there's anything

they would obviously weird

[Music]

and my emotion for drawing this image

[Music]

on the inside here

looks better

especially because

price of an email but

oh my God is that embarrassed yes

coming handy I feel like

it's okay

thank you

so I feel embraced

I probably use it a lot myself

thank you

and this is really really weird looking

straight

foreign

[Music]

eyebrows

okay

I need that ice first

how would embarrassed ice looks like

this oh my English my English is

breaking

like

it can't be like that that's like

laughing

that's like sad

[Music]

I know

what this

embarrassed eyes lipstick

outside

there's like

another worked on one side

no it looks more like sneezing obviously

the blush will help

that's closer to what they want

okay

um

[Music]

[Music]

okay

I wanted like open eyes no I meant

clothesline

okay I think

and

uh

no I didn't want to

you

okay ice can just be squeezed yeah yeah

yeah

I mean that's not too bad but

a bit uneven but

let me put it on a separately

Maybe

and there's a position of the hands and

skin if I should move this too much

further here

[Music]

maybe like that

[Music]

now

[Music]

shorty

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

that is probably a fine I like that

[Music]

I'm glad you think it's cute

[Music]

yeah probably a lot of twists of the

eyes

well I guess that's that

[Music]

these eyes are too bad obviously need

more balancing

but yeah maybe this is

[Music]

so let's first

film

so there's this

[Music]

and then

[Music]

fingers

[Music]

and then add the blush

let's see blush

[Music]

and then I should feel

[Music]

I feel too is kind of good sometimes but

quite bad sometimes

[Music]

like that

[Music]

this is the knee thing

[Music]

let's try to add some

[Music]

nice

[Music]

okay yeah plus for sure yeah it's not

the

[Music]

about the embarrassment without the

blush everything shows up cute on stream

next I'll explain again

[Music]

maybe it should be a bit more red

no that's not friends

I don't know if they should be

behind in front of

it is of course more obvious when it's

imperative in that case I cannot bless

but it's maybe the eyes should be in

front of it but it's in front I don't

know

I don't know I need I need some some

more ideas about to do the blush give me

I short moment

[Music]

when I

[Music]

it's 8 35th

I'll get references

that we're going to work in

this is closer I'm looking for

thank you

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

should probably feel behind everything

but yeah I think I should try to get a

more

consistent

wait across the whole thing

and that was really quiet again

noticed

[Music]

my concentration voice

[Music]

and then I'll just place it behind

everything

[Music]

unless someone has any swimsuits

good timing

everyone should go and draw in their

swimsuits

[Music]

the hands are burning

let's go to the beach

yay embarrassment fun yes it is

she has done something she's

shamed off

[Music]

or is so much someone redeemed the

the more expensive outfit options

[Music]

basically laying everything on top of

each other I can reduce the strength of

this

and then I should mask these two

but it doesn't show up over everything

yeah you know you know the the more

expensive outfit option yeah

[Music]

yeah

I should I should add some blush to put

on like that outfit on

hey

I like it

of course it is

I like it too to be honest

[Music]

but fun Point might be getting a bit

embarrassed showing it off

well I guess that was

and then I press this button

and now it should disappear from

everything else and only be on the face

I don't know after doing this it looked

more like she's sick and blushing

I gave it out of him I'm not really

satisfied with myself

[Music]

[Music]

let me try to move the eyebrows a bit

that was not too Limited

okay

but if I make the eyebrows larger

of course means I do need to finish them

remember just

maybe I just removed ice Let's ignore

the eyes actually

don't see the eye process is in that

case

um

laughs

yeah I'm probably how to fill this empty

space in the eyebrows

that

never had some of the eyes behind it

yeah yeah

[Music]

foreign

actually

let me find another

uh

let me take a quick

and then

get some idea of how other artists

they basically cover up the whole

[Music]

eyes

but they don't cover

if they don't cover the eyes

[Music]

the basically have eyes open

[Music]

maybe maybe I should just cover up the

eyes completely

[Music]

what if I put the ear higher

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

yes yes

[Music]

that might be yeah it might look better

[Music]

let me split off the ear from the rest

[Music]

forget

[Music]

that part first Maybe

[Music]

should we bring your hands along

[Music]

let's see now

[Music]

let's let's activate that again

yeah see I think I think it like a

variety like this

yeah yeah nice pets

at midpoint depth little tube

[Music]

now I can draw more often here

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I think it should it kind of looks bad

yeah

we'll see after I

do

this

right

[Music]

maybe lovely the team is going to be

just fixed it

[Music]

yes you want to hear a slightly knowing

[Music]

because I'm going yeah

[Music]

like that maybe

[Music]

yeah let me just redo the whole build

there

class that off with a bit Crush that it

is my

foreign

wanted to fix everything

[Music]

that was the same person

there you go

[Music]

there you go

[Music]

oh yeah I need to

I could hide it higher higher yeah

foreign

these are quick

and anything

of course

there we go blushing Tonton

it's the perfectly normal pump

she

I wonder if she needs like

another one on top

am I sitting around this way too much

and I can see where it cuts up yes so

this is

demote thank you

thank you let's see

there's the paperback was hidden the

extra folders are hidden

that means I cannot save it

and then I will open it and not that one

oops wrong one

mistake

abort

cover boards

[Music]

okay

that was odd

[Music]

perfect 20 messages that it couldn't

complete the action

okay

[Music]

[Music]

and go over here

and then I go to my

there we go rewards emotes

[Music]

cut this part out

first

I did my voice change

[Music]

[Music]

it's going to have a minute coming here

too maybe I should just teach these

students from the start

instead of doing

maybe I'm making it more complicated

than it needs to be

there you go

me me making things more complicated

than it is to be

whether it's not so you have to stream

anyway but the question now for everyone

um

what should I call this email

embarrassed is a bit

eh great moment you're running

Flash

yes blush

but plus she no

um

[Music]

thank you

flash but yeah I would do more blush

yeah it's good

I could shine

shy

[Music]

let's add that

[Music]

did I still have the head you know

recipe

share like this one movie

because

previously like he is this one maybe I

should maybe I should replace that one

day

actually

when they had this kinda

cuphead

it's kinda

uh

being how old it is

[Music]

not let's remove it I don't need it

upload shy that's why that's why I S H

[Music]

h o h

good because H because in that case it

contains its own

letter name

but why

um is it starting on its um

[Music]

made this one

foreign

immediately

[Music]

all right all right yes I can

now I can't do that

I got today

coming

I don't know

there you go and now for the annoying

part I already use it

it kind of work

but yeah I do feel like I want to

want to do these Strokes a bit stronger

[Music]

awesome

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

happy with it how it turned out

but I do want it to be quite strong eh

[Music]

all right

nice out hey can I have a nice outfit

I love this outfit see you next very

good in it

foreign

let's see how this turns out

[Music]

because I do have the armed one

um

because it actually showed up on the

insert

okay yes that's it

and then I should use this tool instead

so I can have it

drop out

everything immediately

there you go

save

over

since I do have the old one already

to remove it

that I can remember it

then I can't create it

as shine

look at that

let's make it more

I do like this

night Liberty

so slightly updated

[Music]

so hey

what is in what aspect you like about

this outfit

[Music]

when I made that one

[Music]

I need another one

foreign

one more time

because this shirt is acting weird

unless it shows up for me here

like that's it look at my feet about

[Music]

and send it

by the show I was inside this doesn't

show up for me but it doesn't sharp

things chat it's just up on screen

it doesn't show up when I send it in the

chapter for me

yeah I think that one inspired

is it a slightly more

obvious what's going on

that that

one you can use

yeah yeah okay so okay this twitch shot

has some weird

things

so if I press on an email to see it in

larger size we know the description page

about the email so you can see the

matching and next time so the first time

someone posted is this small size but

it's enlarged it's blurry

and then I personally to see the large

size a bit and then the next time

someone posts the same one

[Music]

hmm

it is it is then posted in the higher

quality and then it's Sharp okay I was

just it showed the sharp sharp one

immediately that would be much nicer

[Music]

I keep refreshing to chat being hot oh

well uh

[Music]

as United server

and what was what's next

blushing from leaving this shouldn't do

that

do you want that

[Music]

there we go plastic

highly friends with ears

that is

[Music]

so it has been added to the sermon

foreign

that's such a great idea of how that one

would look

[Music]

we need I mean this is

but um

[Music]

we found it on the sandwich

hands looking weird but

I've never been good with the hands

[Music]

thank you

just don't have a good idea of how to

delete one

[Music]

because I

like

yeah you have you have that spiral one

but I don't know it's

it's not really how I imagining it

foreign

[Music]

though

[Music]

and let me just go through the list of

the other ones I wanted to do

[Music]

and it's good

[Music]

I lived everyone's a little one but

what's up

but

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

wait I do have an idea for a lead one

actually

[Music]

okay I got something

[Music]

you're in luck

[Music]

the whole interesting

yeah I hope so if I can make it look

good

server

oh what a bunny are your bunny do you

want this advantages

server animal I don't know what it's

going to do yet but maybe someday they

might decide for something

yeah it's same here bunny

much

no I don't know what to add

see that when I want to make a new one

which is weird

let's see how well this goes

everyone every time I see these skills

it sounds like Disco

let's go oh wait what is this

[Music]

awesome

[Music]

deal

[Music]

what do you do you want that channel

that kind of dude

the gas if

I I don't know

I mean

I assume it's it's it's

um

[Music]

the addiction it's it's

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

let's see if I can

make it

you can do it would be better than girls

yeah

IDC to

do you have an idea of

one idea of doing it but I might have to

do a vision of it

because it's just a loose idea

I guess it would be too much

yeah that's that's why

might not be

might not be

[Music]

okay

one girl

Bongo is one

[Music]

same time I don't feel like

there's too much

it's more like High

Maybe

[Music]

it's very important to get it correct uh

facial expression here

foreign

[Music]

yes a slam

[Music]

okay um

not starting everyone

[Music]

thank you

further adjusting kneaded

[Music]

[Music]

give me what did I say something good

[Music]

I might have I mean

I don't English well

[Music]

yeah the this this randomized song thing

definitely doesn't take into account

which songs that it has plain apart

please

well I should fill it out I need to find

a second artist

also has music I can use completely free

without

any

well they say they say copyright free

but it's technically not corporate free

just

yeah

yeah

it's it's

royalty free it is

fee free I guess

[Music]

and

feel free

I used chili

okay let me

yeah I think it does because this is

a lip Rambo

[Music]

which is a South Korean or a composing

uh chill hop

[Music]

yeah it's important that

use our music Let Me videos Mystery

online Garden monetize your content on

YouTube so

soulful music produced by real artists

it's free to download these videos yeah

that's that's good that's good I will

prepare it for next time

this is exactly what I'm looking for

and it's like

yeah I have to sign up to use the music

yes by signing up to create Pro and

connect your cell we can monitor your

videos on monthly release energy claims

on videos that use or music so you can

monetize the work okay so they are got

the claim

by stuff

unless I connect it

hey that's

light of a hassle but that

you can use end of the songs button on

your creative dashboard if I track it

over on or create that button you may

notice

[Music]

as if it's weird anything

[Music]

set up you can download sexy songs on

the Creator's dashboard

or your the you can also steam the music

or download

offline playlist

Channel panel

and which one of our community images

[Music]

that image must be formed it's linked to

this okay I mean that's not a big

problem I just put it directly under the

credits I guess

thank you

it's a music copyright transfer between

yeah it is not yeah it is still on the

carpet

it will hold all the lights to amusing

enemies is not royalty free without

music as long as obviously receives the

mandatory credit

if this does not have you does not

happen we take appropriate action make

sure or write something first

they are habits

I mean it's not hard I just need to put

that picture and delete it on the about

page and then they have pizza

this is the claiming part of it that

could be

a bit weird a bit something to deal with

but

as long as because currently when I play

this music and I do get clean from

random songs so as long as I actually

get claims from

their songs it I at least get claims

from the correct ones

yeah but yeah this shouldn't be any

problem it was a bit more than

requires

and inside shouldn't be any problems I'm

a bit I'm a bit

I don't know how I'm even scared

yeah yeah did you like this but I can't

think it's that way

especially that's it yeah

I've not had any experience on this

stuff on the end of my one that's good

is the

this sounded a bit more scary in there

in the info page but but is it good it's

a good pitch

foreign

thank you for the suggestion

they appreciate that

there's some salad of it

[Music]

but yeah basically yeah yeah it actually

now that I think of it it's actually a

good thing because in that case

because currently uh look Rambo and

I have never gotten a claim from and

I've looked from Luke Campbell that must

mean because he assumed I should

Nathan

a little bit

[Music]

not true no pronouns in that file okay

they

um

has

don't do any claims so I do get changed

from other songs mostly unknown artists

with with this song I'm not I tell you

stuff okay that shouldn't happen

but if I only get claims from my

chillhop

in that case the Decay will be go to the

correct and if the claim goes on my

channel would sign up on their service

they will immediately release the claim

and therefore I should not get claim

from random songs anymore

that thing would actually be a better

thing

if that is the case

like the switch picks out this one of

the song that is closest and only that

song and in this case it would be the

chillhop a claim

I would actually not have this

uh

have an HSB remote plane and that should

be some if that is true

that is roughly something they should

focus on because this is actually a good

thing

although I when I when after the vote is

published and it gets those claims I

just mark it as I don't use those music

and then a few hours later the claims

are gone

so it is actually rather convenient

which makes it recommend I have heard

that YouTubers have had a lot of issues

when it comes to claims

[Music]

there is a you know do they get these

claims they disappear after

reporting that I don't

and also I've also heard YouTube

basically have three claims

that you can make big counter claims

while twitch there is no limit I think

[Music]

she also is convenient but yeah I'll try

to use that I'll see if I can use it

next stream

and hopefully

and also

that time is way past

and hopefully no more clips and that

would be so nice

[Music]

oh

[Music]

yeah now you have

okay

someone beat you to it yeah

[Music]

it's a good one

wait I have a good idea

two seconds it will just take a few

seconds

[Music]

[Music]

okay that's that's

[Music]

Envision it

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

moment

program because I didn't bother open it

embarrassed it's just being reproduction

[Music]

let's be married

way yes

[Music]

it looks it looks more like she's being

flirty yeah yeah it's not right

sorry

robo

yeah even though these I do like the

rappy Parts but

but I respect

[Music]

it is Art indeed and I struggle with how

I should do the maths

[Music]

at the moment

just

[Music]

not get a shape right at the moment

you're stopping in briefly before going

to sleep well this is a nice of you yeah

I stopped by you briefly

mostly hurting

and then kind of about the time when I

had a stream so I had to quickly leave

[Music]

you're funny

struggles do you struggle with your

mouse a lot

[Music]

and

[Music]

feel free

here we get a bit silly

[Music]

as you might notice

considering

the outfit at that moment might not be

it's a bit silly

silly is silly is good

yeah

I like the easily

and I like I like being yeah

I don't know maybe it look better before

I start messing around

cleaner lines

[Music]

see how that changes things

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

shape of the head

or something

[Music]

oh that's that's rotate like that

since it is

I got which weed

foreign

still

mostly have it fall down

maybe I should add the second hand

cool

people

oh my my initial hand struggles

I always have things

that's not how her hair looks either but

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

my

[Music]

it might make it look better

it always likes to retain your laundry

first I don't know why

[Music]

it's probably as I

[Music]

I probably start

[Music]

yeah probably start on the wrong side

and then try to rotate it

yeah it's probably because I try to

rotate use the point where I start

rotating as a rotating point and that's

why I'm struggling but I think

but now that I really like the church

from the middle it makes much more sense

to retina

okay

[Music]

[Music]

well

[Music]

um

now

[Music]

wow

[Music]

this one I mean I hope I hope it turns

out well

nurse

you have to watch

[Music]

I don't know a cat scratch your face

today

I'm so sorry for crossing me

I think I must steal that ah sure

okay I don't think I made it up

so yeah

I'm seriously United have a snake Okay I

guess the whole sentence sure

[Music]

I think I heard it before somewhere

another different context I guess

absolute I don't wear anything

underneath my clothes

well the clothes could just refer to

your like outer outfits

um

that could mean you're going commando

I think they turned

[Music]

I hear a lot of messages suddenly

no no comments

no you're you don't have a commander

you're your own

[Music]

let's add that

blushing from lewdness that's a good

turn

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

it could be a slight update I can do

later on

foreign

[Music]

someone find it

can't use one on the sermon

double flashing

yeah I think this is gonna work it's

like

this is

lines of

laughs

in the morning

what

there was a comment on this good survey

for anyone curious they got this Discord

which I mentioned a few times now

for anyone everyone chatting at the

moment they're on the Disco service no

because

more people said watching and chatting

so someone I currently

and working

might

want to miss it

yeah this detail isn't going to show up

[Music]

I just add slight extra

[Music]

anyway let's do

them both blushing

because blushing is great

foreign

[Music]

snack while I'm thinking of what to do

next

the next emote

[Music]

um so here's the killer of all of them

friendly

Now give me uh two minutes or so

[Music]

my normal streamlined so I'm a very very

short break

I do want

[Music]

and they want to make more clothes for

her

she does now

[Music]

okay

synonym for today

[Music]

trying to think of

what more today

it said anything much

would be out of chair today

[Music]

enjoying

playing to try it because wait did I

think do not change that

I apparently didn't change I checked the

title I changed the notification I

didn't change the game

Mother's Day

[Music]

housing

if only if we found it was more

clear watch cat wait what's that

apparently but it's fine

exactly

why exactly

it's the

is that joker missing

is that

well thank you for the theme though

yeah

spinach spinach spinach

spinach Spanish

sing

yeah I'm actually it's actually one of

the things the Vegeta I

I can eat a lot I think that is one of

those that I don't like

but I mean if I eat most other

vegetables it's fine

the rabbits like spinach

I mean I can't even

well I didn't know what is called in

English I can say it in Swedish of

course

but not

okay that's the Swedish word the Swedish

singer or hybrid with

you want to be strong to the Finish if

you don't eat your spinach

oh yeah that's again

you know what we start to finish if you

don't eat your spinach

this Popeyes

[Music]

so

maybe I should accept the difference in

the top

so the next one what did you say

[Music]

I could do said

well you should say I am the angry

because you want both

okay let me uh

now I want to jump no no no I said I

said uh okay hold that idea

I want to drop pom poms

pun pun with pom-poms

that's what I'm about to draw now

[Music]

[Music]

jelly day yeah

I mean her name is

on pond so having pom-poms

I mean her name comes from Pom-Pom

yeah

exactly and what basically uh I really

need to drop

my own

drawing of Pom-Pom and then draw all the

outfits it would be Shirley there and

made outfit it would be well of course

the sports outfit I could do like

different outfit and they swim swimsuits

of course

I could do like a bikini

yeah

much more yeah I had a list of this at

least um

[Music]

additionalities for one but here we go

[Music]

yeah chilly there with pom-poms a

princess outfits yes

a long coffee hoodie or

look at the the Lolly I'll tip basically

[Music]

here I should bring up the Cliff of her

saying that

she she's wearing uh a hoodie who knows

what else she's wearing

but aren't you personally imagine it

being like a dress because I've seen

like

hoodie

address but like in the hoodie kind of

material and with the with the hood it's

with that if that's what they call it

long sleeves and all that but it's just

a dress so and just like just like

ponton and but me too

the outfit is just the dress and nothing

else

so yeah

and um yeah and then made that [ __ ] and

then and then the kind of

[Music]

waitress server kind of outfit

go to General and then you should be

able to find

threads and one of them is additionals

with Pom-Pom and then you can write your

ideas

and post links to

references and such and then I'll

like

uh

magical like girl outfit to something

with a lot of friends and stuff that's

an idea

let's see

with pom-poms but with a little one

of edge so it's almost unfortunately

that is very late I am just checking and

watch malfunctions here there would be

no one from the functions

unless you redeem the underrated one and

the address is appears

did

but uh well I guess if she I would

assume just like we don't know if she

would be a scared and if she does solid

tricks Maybe

hey it's too early for the anime yet but

in five minutes

oh my nothing but a dress nothing

underneath

someone likes it I mean

you know underwear of course

oh

um

[Music]

oh

XD

so let's sing um

so there's

although I could make that could be

maybe been animated

two I could have it static too because

aesthetic one you can unlock with the

points if I only make it animated

that's could be answer because

I was because the reason I came up with

it I hydrate oh hello Jimmy

welcome welcome

we're talking about emails

the prime form one carrots for me I just

figured out after you have I mean have

you watched it at least

from all day

dirty stuff

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

yeah I wouldn't I would like a cat

[Music]

there are those who have like redeems

for you

throw things at

the person I've never been the one who

likes to throw things

because it seems the rude to throw

things at others

[Music]

but

hey look at it

that's such a mouth

look at all these I think it is in here

people from these countries are

associated

hello hello welcome

as I'm from Sweden we have a lot of I

should not know where everyone is from

[Music]

we have people from different countries

here

and they

[Music]

yeah I am

I have that it's my tags only this

description I think I actually don't

know if I have

but it's no secret that I add that I am

bisexual

that I that I can I'll admit that

so

[Music]

but I don't think I pray with that

but I do have the LGBT attack

[Music]

and also I stand for LGBT rights

[Music]

as a person from HTTP and that's lgbtq

and also tag

yeah

I don't remember what

but basically uh on

all of it

I don't exclude anyone

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

yes I am a bunny

get so many bunnies

bisexual plate

[Music]

last year from Sweden I'm from America

your English is really cute good is you

thank you I've been uh yeah you should

hear my English when I started speaking

and then well yeah but then

and then

there was many years before I even

thought about publishing anything online

though so no one got to hear it I love

the hats

[Music]

you know it's a lot of bunnies

it's too long a bunch more appears

yeah yeah and if you go to bunny

streamers you will find more bunnies

there everywhere

foreign

if you don't mind me asking how did

and why did you wanna learn English okay

how

I learned English was from school I

think it's like first grade so and why I

did it was because it's compulsory so

[Music]

choice

and but it's quite quite useful

it's currently the languages in the

world community so

[Music]

then I learned as my third language I

learned Spanish but I barely know any

Spanish but I do want to practice more

Spanish

that's

you know that way about asking

be free to ask me anything

[Music]

and if I don't want to answer it I will

say so

I could ask that but I will have

function on it yeah it's like 16 for it

ah

I'm actually appreciate that you do

recognize that

because

too often I see people say that English

is the most easy the easiest sometimes

here I struggle I do struggle with some

English and the easiest language in the

world it has some easy aspects to it but

it also have some strange and weird

aspects to it

but of course the only place I see

people argue that's English is the

easiest is of course in English and

these are people who have been using

English for many many years and are

really good at it

it's basically like a an artist of

whatever whatever art they are making

saying it's easy to do what they're

doing

because they spend the years doing it

it's not easy

Enterprise skins

[Music]

yeah I see a lot of batteries okay

even here in the chat I see a lot of

weird mix-up of words sometimes it's

just YouTube

typing on the phone and it's hard to

type the correct letters and then you

have audio correct on that

butt crack does still help which would

be even worse without it and then it

picks the wrong words and it gets

confusing sometimes

[Music]

but

yeah

I do find a language interesting

so I wanted to draw like

pom-poms should I feed the whole scene

so I was wondering if I should have a

Andy

the left side or right sides so so back

to the and when he I was discussing here

before I got distracted by such a lovely

person

and so

so someone requested the outfit change

foreign

yeah really nice do you want to be

called the

hex kill it

Mexican there hexane

banana in banana I like banana

[Music]

I would say I would like a banana indeed

or you can call me Sky that's my really

my real name is Evelyn somebody call me

that here in chat

must must after not but happen sometimes

so you're ready for that

uh however if you don't mind it

I do prefer calling someone by a part of

the username because when I watch other

streamers and they call people by

their real name

it gets confusing

and and even after this because I'm

really bad with names too

and and even after they tell who it is

in the chat I will

in another long time forget to eat this

again

[Music]

the boy it is just easier to be a part

of the username if you don't mind

[Music]

thank you cardio Hicks thank you

well I mean if if switch could add a

feature where you could have like a

Alias included with username in the chat

that would be nice

[Music]

that's it wishful thinking

[Music]

Evelyn princess fun fun

and they voted yes

not a single Novo

and I accept it I'll be princess if you

want

in Paradise in school they teach a lot

of technical stuff that is important to

knowing the language I mean yeah if you

fail that sure but

and also yeah sure in the comments

things people point out this mixing up

your and your but pronunciation wise

they are the same

I mean

do you spell it you are there you go

for English that's

good

excuse me I'm gonna make the teacher

stuff with her kids like this is

argument and things I mean arguably

Celsius is something you if you like to

travel for example

I guess you don't really need it if you

just check your own weather app or

something to be fair

and I'll give I mean

announced that it's more like

I think

because yeah to be fair didn't kind of

advanced mathematics

School

and there are several things of those

I don't use however I would argue that

learning those things might have helped

me understand

the more how mathematics works and

things like that

so even if I don't use those

stuff

and it might actually still be

yeah well it's also useful if you want

to move on to if you want to move to a

field where those stuff is more

important in that case you have the they

want to set you up to be ready for

higher education

independent which school you go to and

which country it is a more school system

[Music]

that might not be as good on that

okay

you can call me hex yeah I was going to

ask you if I hex is okay

that sounds good

do a lot of Sweden folks know English

yeah

almost everyone

I mean yeah some people know German

Spanish French those are the three

primary

sad languages in school as far as I know

and

Arabic is common too

I mean common as in

it's below 10 maybe even below five

percent

the Swedish basically 100 English and

then now I said 1995 and then its third

language is down to

12 or something

that's a very huge job

[Music]

should I do the pom-poms of this this

way

in this way or the other way and they're

thinking well in that case I could do it

in both ways

and then have it animate

and then I can have it both below but if

I do this I'm stretched out

and the arm retracted

however they retracted uh

I'm gonna do like one two three four

one two three

that could be cute I think

[Music]

thank you

and maybe

let's see

so

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

Ty

[Music]

thank you

and there was the

ringtone now let's see

[Music]

that

thank you that works making up there

there you go

only pretty well defense lady

it's not important now

[Music]

maybe like

this the mouse oh yeah so

yeah yeah

maybe I can have like close Mouse when

bows are down

and then it's open

or yeah yeah I could do that

nice she's cheering yeah

yeah that's a good idea

that is a good idea

thank you for the suggestion

go team go

you should I would say it should

definitely be the

rain message and you can go stream I go

whoever it is raining

sadly you cannot unlock

um animated

emotes through points

and which that was an option but what

afraid yes I have no idea

still have more remote to make

and we'll see whoever is online

it is raining time

Guess Who's online at the moment though

[Music]

it is also making garage

foreign

[Music]

Target spotted

well hey that is if she's still

streaming when I'm done but I mean she's

doing I actually don't remember maybe

she is

I know I'm sad

stop by tracking a lot during this

streaming but I mean I can't I think I'm

fully concentrate

on the drawing 100

.

well it is scheduled for the

regular three hours

it doesn't seem along it is

we just need to do that

foreign

was

it it was four hours long so one scene

maybe she will still be parting it

dreamy at that time but in that case it

would likely be at the very end so

okay

concept yeah yeah I mean she started but

I mean I would last time I did like

six hour streams I still have two and a

half hours left so

so in that case we both will end our

streams at the same time if if it goes

as scheduled

I think my last team was five hours to

be fair no that was the eyeshadow

that the hand is going to be on the

inside

oh doesn't wait I'm at home iron arm

okay

okay

um let me

do this

oh there's like

a neck

thank you

and then

some way

[Music]

[Music]

and our pumpkins anyway now I put the

reference map

whether this is outside but it's just to

get an idea

of what it looks like

yeah

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

it was

which which means

um

where did you add that if I may ask

and because if you

if you came to additional outfits which

is a set on General chat anyway

um

at the top or it should be in the

message

and one of the outfits is already the

cheerleader outfit so

that is already in consideration

[Music]

if only there were a sad button nuts Act

is the sad pump on emote to express

sadness out of the fact that you're not

making this adventure

Mickey might have a sad foxy mode

and you could use

[Music]

the

button subscribe to this level to tier

one at level one

and to unlock

this emails and more

benefits

but uh one is I wanted to subscribe to

myself

[Music]

I wonder

[Music]

I wonder what it would do if I would try

to pay for a subscription to myself

thank you

[Music]

right anyway

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

and then I need the raised arm

foreign

it should probably be more relaxed

[Music]

yeah more like

[Music]

people here

and they're making me happy

when I was very happy that you are here

[Music]

I didn't do the ears to the skin of the

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

you are amazing too

you know what to say to make me happy

[Music]

oh yeah

[Music]

you're making me blush again

yeah I don't have the

[Music]

I I should have one blushing from praise

when y'all say this nice things

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

okay I will again look up some

good references of how

Tom Palms Ultron

back and

only draw them very complicated but they

should work in small scale

and some draw them without basically any

detail

which isn't guarantee

foreign

foreign

[Music]

into something I like

you make something my own

there are very many editions ways of

drawing pom-poms

and a lot of people all right okay

that's inside okay I have some

[Music]

ideas now

that

intra inspiration from

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

okay yes so

I think maybe

[Music]

that was a bit tricky for me to try

[Music]

so I really need

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

this can work

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

when it's not thrusted upwards

[Music]

so this one should probably be this one

and then this one should

[Music]

I have some

different more moment to it

[Music]

blush blush why are you so [ __ ] wait

what what did I say now what

[Music]

what have I done

[Music]

you didn't say anything okay good good

hopefully

[Music]

I will feel this with some water

okay

okay so you are just chill adorable and

hot almighty thank you funny or well

yes that is

that is

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

the Arabic word for the color brown

is

made a moment

oh they didn't include uh

pronunciation

no problem I can basically do this um

take care

the okay yes

the Arabic word for the color brown is

bunny

which is pronounced like bunny

but you though you emphasize the second

Silverman

well it sounded more like when I try to

read that thing about

a bunny

fun fact

foreign

so it looks more like it's being

thrusted into the eye

which I guess should

maybe just

make it more like this

[Music]

um

that's me he has missing Brown interrupt

[Music]

ion

I'm going I'm going to

yeah yeah that was still that is totally

a country right

[Music]

and rapidly speaking country and then

you're going to see you

sweet friends Evelyn

and I say I love you please

I'm super curious as to what it sounds

like

[Music]

you got the typing at least yes e sounds

like this

Jacques

[Music]

yeah the mixing mode

magnifying that is stuck in my up left

corner and it looks like big scene

investigating yeah you have been

suspicious you have been very very

suspicious

you are on the surveillance at the

moment

[Music]

okay

oh I hear it again maybe

okay that's the second time

it comes like

[Music]

I didn't even know that kind of pop-up

the

that is very interesting

I've since it looks funny yeah

it does look it looks strange and funny

I think

[Music]

fun fun being being too cute

I see those blushing ones came in handy

[Music]

[Music]

it's so cute

I'm happy to pick it for you

that's

[Music]

I like being cute that's

what I live first

[Music]

no I'm glad you gave me a chance to be

be so cute

[Music]

and that you're enjoying it too

thank you

[Music]

hello probably

I see you found

anonymous

and there's two new actually

thanks

yeah

even blushing ones

blushing for two different reasons

[Music]

[Music]

I hope they come in handy for whenever

you can eat them

[Music]

[Music]

which for me is quite often actually

[Music]

because before I have used the I tried

to do the

[Music]

foreign

reaction

but then the streamers has spreaded out

as times three which I do find silly

because that's like reading out the

heart

seeing as a less than three

but being able to use the uh

skincare giggling version

has helped me

I should show that

what I wrote is

made in a jokingly

[Music]

even though I mean yeah okay

it's quite obvious that this was a joke

but

I want to play it

[Music]

plus it keeps me more

bottom ended up kind of weird but

okay this is a super amazing beautiful

[Music]

oh

[Music]

yeah

you really are making me feel so happy

I'm so glad you showed up she's

[Music]

crying Echo the Pokemon

oh oh yeah

you're right about that

Pine

Co or they say pineco

eh

I mean it could be pineapple what did I

know there's no pronunciation guide here

you go with

which is Japanese

Tama

or in French

now I see it oh no I don't see it like

that it will be hard to see when it has

color I'll be lacking Fork meeting real

quick okay

okay that sounds important

you go and focus on that

and have a nice meeting

and and they have that tattoo

it paid

yeah I think

I mean

I guess it's China shape

do you think people okay

it's okay I can't help them I know

people wouldn't care

and then there's the

lowered arm

[Music]

yeah I think I think

that looks that's important

just to give a rough idea

and then I can alternate

[Music]

this is let me not like an attention of

this this is

left up

and it is right down

and then

add a layer and then I especially this

trick

and then there's a guide layer here

and duplicate these

flip them

and then make sure they are removed back

forearm

which is

[Music]

and now it is

right up and left up

[Music]

now with

no she can move the arms

it's jelly day yes

that's exactly

what is and I just realized I was

supposed to add this yearly day

outfit anyway so

black yeah you're going to see a bit of

it and unless I change the skin

again let me get just a quick look at

what a nice looking because you're only

going to see the top

of

[Music]

mix it with pom-poms it's very mixed

with pom poms

pumpkin

that would be cute

the other made one with Pom-Pom

at least to make it animated

and did my best

I saw like a fourth well it's three

unique famous fishing is

all right all right

[Music]

[Music]

still

what is a nice design flashing outfit

don't buy this since about two times

she's looking for the sign

but I do want to have like a design that

really looks like a cheerlead outfit

[Music]

people can see

[Music]

that it is one

what if I search for

a

foreign

[Music]

yeah I don't have the those

but for the service they don't show up

on mobile

and I don't want to like exclude mobiles

and

I do really wish that which would extend

the number of

emotes available though

don't get why they have to be so stinky

especially since

well this guy like gives you

loads of them 50 from the start

and then when you get more popular you

can get up to like 200 or something or

150.

and switch it like

[Music]

yeah you can get 50 maybe if you

partnered

[Music]

I know I just tested it

let's see how this looks like I mean if

you can see it's fair enough

oh god let's turn back 10 practice

[Music]

all right see it's not gonna fit that is

applied to me

yeah if it's a if it's even a fixed it's

going to be even more complicated to

stay on there on screen okay

I got to go back to work here it was

nice to see your effort thank you for

showing up kittens

[Music]

we will talk about it later and I'm not

busy streaming

[Music]

hey

I really wonder what what the results of

those cars the face side I'll talk to

you tomorrow yeah maybe get stuck in the

morning or something

I was busy this morning

I had stuff to do

which is what this is

[Music]

Naman silly again

but this one should be like

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

stay safe yeah

be safe

[Music]

that's excited about stem cells are very

very cute

hey any hard stuff being silly I mean

they actually like I just can't see what

[Music]

okay let me show you

[Music]

that and that you can do

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

foreign

[Music]

adjustments

[Music]

I do want to add like

[Music]

like a bunny print here but you could do

it but

I guess it could show up when

[Music]

lifting your arm

[Music]

that's okay

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

we'll see um yeah so that's the

now I can

copy these

no I don't have that the reference here

anymore

[Music]

my friends

mirror

[Music]

a bit but it's almost oh that was not

too many

[Music]

unpicks it off that's kind of very

noticeable

foreign

[Music]

that's what should be removed

off the flat side

and the other side needs one

of the oven

[Music]

oops like that

[Music]

I think it's going to be so smart and

hard to see

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

ER at bunny University

[Music]

laughs

well versed in bunnies

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[ __ ]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

guys can work

[Music]

on one with the pump pumps is the Sherry

that I've come together

hydrate yeah I picked up with what a

nice good time

[Music]

and off with the dress okay

of course it's warm outside

take off your dress

can't have it

I'm depressed

it is

um

it's warm outside

it's actually not too warm about that

the most popular girl at University

everyone loves her because she's cute

and smart and hot and apparently takes

off her dress when people ask at it

but probably is there actually be

somebody she's popular

do you want to foreign

[Music]

yeah and then when you have all his hair

and everything

[Music]

I know

yeah

yeah

waste waste redeem to put your what to

put your first family in other way

[Music]

that's right

[Music]

yeah I better see it next stream

although that's question if I can see

the next stream because

see you string quite late for me

but I'm I'm sleeping

or something early Cuts like one of his

teams I think one but it was still very

late and I should have been sleeping at

that point

[Music]

during this cartoon around

if you want don't forget to choose your

animal

and choosing animal doesn't do anything

but you know

[Music]

it's

okay fun fun I know it is theory

like I do for now seven streamers and

just

manage never get a chance to sing them

[Music]

or like there's also situations where I

like

they are streaming something

but another stream is because I mean I

didn't see I follow more than once this

restaurant and streamers stream at the

same time that happens

a lot

and if someone is streaming something

that seems more fun

I just can't help

myself but I do try to like

watch stream and see I haven't seen

another one

but it's a it's easier to if it's like a

game I don't see it like

something to talk about

oh really

[Music]

it is

[Music]

probably streamers haven't watched you

know quite that funny

[Music]

what is this

in here

oh there we go a broken thing

thank you favorite color

yeah I wish I can't have multiple things

like investment people at once yeah

yeah pink yeah

oh yeah yeah yeah you can pick here you

pick it your animal and you can pick

your color of your that you want your

name to be

it's like 50 colors to pick from

the people really can't [ __ ] find the

it should contain all the colors this

card has and the one which has

and I think there's a few more

just to fill it out a bit

[Music]

let's see if you're going to see

multiple eyes

I'm in the head to you about it is

[Music]

multiple pairs of eyes

the two eyes isn't enough

I mean technically it's because you can

see

depth and stuff so it's definitely

enough

[Music]

okay let's go with fuzzy five eight eyes

and you can be a spider

I've seen this underwear

well I don't think it's cinder's

underwear quite a lot singer yes Cinder

anyway I just noticed yeah it's in the

scene by the way

[Music]

isn't it cute

let's go over again 10 eyes you can get

everything which animal has the most

eyes

which animals

which animal is the one I don't want to

see

[Music]

I mean I can't watch multiple streams

already like side to side but

my one bunny princess

[Music]

yeah that's

that price

is kinda

more revealing that what she

usually has

okay let's try to do the

proper outline now

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

animal at about 200 oh

that's

a lot of ice

and did you use all of them or is it

like you survives

oh it's very hot

I guess it is hard to see due to the

signs

yeah and just get

but we can make pumpkin larger

[Music]

and then you can look at everything

[Music]

okay let's see

[Music]

I can't go far

back no sir

it was a surprise close up

[Music]

good thing I made the blushing ones you

before that one

[Music]

before that close-up

[Music]

it was a pretty nice closer right

[Music]

everything

a close-up

take a close look at the outfits that's

the only reason

[Music]

but no other for no other particular

reason Andy just

appreciate the outfits

[Music]

respectfully looking exactly

[Music]

inside that folder

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

my first quickly looking at the hot

bunny in the hot outfit yes

it is quite a skinny outfit

but it's not meant to be seen in public

so stop your teammates

you naughty ones

[Music]

so maybe this body first

you know

I know what he said nothing

but

maybe I should now I'm adding blush

might be too much

if I like that chocolate blush Daddy

because I finish like another official

expression doesn't

really go along with the blush

and then I had to change it

that's it I will redraw from at some

point because I do kinda

130 what I really want is to have an

animated

I don't really need to go like well

I mean that would be nice to have a

careful tracking I mean this

this company can really

compare and Run games

and streaming at the same time so

tracking software is not going to be a

thing so I just want some

like simple

pre-made animations

[Music]

okay this

this is a bit tricky right so

like

that

this is a bit trickier than I thought

there we go

I'm hungry

yeah I'm not that too hungry I ate quite

a lot today I hold Pizza

another big pizza or anything

but I'm a smaller bunny actually quite

tall bunny

[Music]

and Mariah Carey

I think iPhones nowadays come with the

tracking software do you think I have an

iPhone

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

and they're probably going to get so

much money from it anyway but

he's feeding you okay

yeah I mean okay okay

thank you

but yeah some some like predetermined

animations for Pom-Pom and with that the

I will use mixed up as it's called a

plug-in not a plugin

it kind of can uh

it's a separate software that can

interact with with OBS which is the

software I need to stream it

[Music]

says I'll have tracking software it's

hard to know what I had still assaulty

with I mean that's that's

just the browser's history

thing that's not anything much to do

with mobiles but yeah

and

thanks for letting me hang today of

course of course everyone is welcome

every

one who is intrude of course

that has

happened

anyway I'm going to use the luncheon

tacos steps I hope you have an amazing

day today I hope you have an amazing

lunch

and an amazing rest of your day because

I mean very nice very fun see you show

up also

absolutely not too thank you or anything

but

did you

and if you feel free to follow if you

want to see future streams

thank you

[Music]

honey oh what kind of Packers

[Music]

status

don't spend English I realized

We Love Stuff

cilantro and papa t or what you have

heard of

I don't exactly know what it is but I've

I've seen like

pictures of it

[Music]

and it seems to be quite popular

in certain regions at least

the land trap might turn off

I might even got an explanation of what

it is

sounds good it does sound good

that's probably how you spell steak he's

just me not knowing how to spending this

cookies

cookies on

you're going to have cookies or do you

want cookies on your taco

people have a good day to you too

should give beautiful person

just let's see if I cook tacos you now I

mean

and imagine it works

I might for trying it

[Music]

[Music]

okay that's probably what I would be

looking for

let's see it's like adjustment to eat

tomatoes

there you go

philanta is coriander

no no I need to know about the coriander

Korean and I always say it has a fresh

Citrus taste that sounds nice with a

strong aroma

and why the head is safe it has a soapy

taste oh I don't like that and uh

easy way to continue

some reason I can't it feels like I

shouldn't know what it is

a green herb

because

[Music]

I always said some

the app

yeah I think I've

been it

just from a little look of it I can

imagine what it would say

taste like

[Music]

but it's probably not what it tastes

like

and this I wouldn't even be able to

explain what it tastes like

[Music]

what do you eat oh okay

I I

[Music]

thank you

apparently it's a genetic your genes

literally term if Sinatra that's good or

if it tastes like soap wouldn't that be

true for most food

[Music]

but I guess I guess there are I could

imagine there are like two elements just

cilantro uh where this Paramount

genetics would tricky someone or the

other or maybe something I didn't know

yes I mean some people like Samsung some

people at least like some stuff I mean

and I don't know how that works actually

I haven't lived in here

yeah I'm curious

anyway anyway

let me not ignore you hello Julie

[Music]

welcome welcome

I hope

it's been a while since I saw you here

last I think

[Music]

I've been speaking for almost five

minutes if I mean it's five hours now my

voices

and I need to finish this drawing how

are you I'm doing great I'm beginning

[Music]

yes I want to leave the underwear

again it's the most redeemed one so far

luckily I think Lancer tastes good I

don't actually taste it try it again I

see you found it you need an email it's

blushing once it's so cute

this

there's no right

she'd been here earlier you would sort

of tight there has been some cute

moments here I guess you could say

or the tasted with this guy that's

something else maybe

no you can acquire taste for a much food

but snap is one of them

Kenny

maybe you can

[Music]

I I mean

that's interesting

I guess

I guess I haven't thought about that

[Music]

that is interesting

[Music]

cute bunny you want me to say that

that can mean

[Music]

that's

Julie is the one redeemed Swedish

festivals

but she hasn't been here for a while she

hasn't been reading for a while

let's Flash

lovely is one of those that eat it as

good it tastes like soap contact Fire

taste food unless you like you

I mean

and if you can acquire taste for soap

this is a beautiful language honestly

maybe you should learn Swedish we can

have a leadership and learning

team

some people because Swedish has

and of course not unique to Swedish it's

common among the the Germanic languages

but since we have as big since we have

people

knowing other like romance languages

here

Swedish has a lot of bounds

kind of like English

[Music]

so

[Music]

Swedish also has tones

foreign

[Music]

language for that reason but I can still

make

distinctions between words we can you

can still figure out what the words are

through context and that's not

so

it's not like

using the wrong tone means it sounds

wrong it's just and and also considering

different dialects use different tones

together

it was

quisha has had result resulted in her

situations where it sounds

really but it's not important

[Music]

thank God

learn another language

you are smart enough to learn another

language it's in your DNA

[Music]

and Swedish isn't too hard of a language

I mean

the most important is this like

yeah actually mentioned that the date on

another stream which were also the tough

because about learning another language

and the important thing about when it

comes to learning a language there I

would say two important aspects

is beautiful I learn it and I'll do my

best it would be amazing video that

Julie

I love to talk to you in Swedish

and we can have a collab in Swedish

3D pronunciation is difficult

it's

I would disagree no I mean it's really

it's really how much you can hydrate

it's really it depending on how much you

practice on it

but yeah Swedish has a lot of different

vowels

and I guess that's one of the things you

could argue make Swedish trickier than

for example Spanish

thank you

and that's I could argue is an actual

objective way of saying if a language is

hard or not

foreign

things regarding

that

anyway

what do I say yes the one of the reason

why

I would like I would love to learn a new

language because I don't have to speak

kinda right now Portuguese English and I

read the Spanish

I know Swedish and English

of course and then I would focus on

Spanish I did try to learn German but

I do have more interest in learning

Spanish actually

even though it's Spanish language

[Music]

apparently ER and ear

are separate sounds but I don't hear it

yeah but that's because

rounded version of

but it also makes the air it also makes

the F sound

okay now back what would I say

uh also makes no way

is the letter name but it also makes the

e sound as the short version of

so every every round is with just two

sounds

so it's e and uh

[Music]

and the difference between them is e is

unrounded and E is rounded it is a

difference between e and e

[Music]

but that can't make big phrases in

Spanish

sounds like or when it sounds like or

when you say it what kind of what

no did you forget

it's also a word in Spanish

[Music]

which means Island

[Music]

but yeah

[Music]

ER and er are different sounds because

the difference between a roundness yeah

or the slight quality uh it's like for a

bit slightly back but you kind of have a

sound in English but it's further back

than Swedish sound

and which is the login

if you say her her fur sir

American version is more like

you mix the r like I think like R

colored

so it's her her

and stuff like that but it should be

more British

hair

Fair

no that's I'm I'm going over to Germany

there

but then so that one is further back so

the Swedish uh is which I probably used

when I speak English is somewhere

between

there's a problem with balance there's

too many of them

and you can

yeah

I guess it should be a

one

close mouth

yes

that should probably be beating around

there I think

yeah oh your habla espanol Pera soy

Brazilian

wrong

you can you can judge my pronunciation

there

[Music]

I had to say the last question twister

it just don't judge the first one anyway

I'm pronounce it I feel so weird

speaking Spanish because I don't know if

I'm from the words what is this is crazy

I mean yeah espanol is at least correct

as far as I know

but the rest I don't know

because I learned both in school Spanish

and English

I just learned Spanish and English is

good

I learned English for like

[Music]

12 years or something in school Spanish

for like three years

[Music]

but I focus only focus on him yeah I did

that I didn't have much interest in

learning Spanish at that time if I were

to

now I do have more interest in learning

Spanish

foreign

[Music]

it is correct I mean it should be uh

I mean it has two separate message um

sentences so you should put like a

comma the comma like periods something

like that

I did so

[Music]

I love English

my English is fun

English to Swedish

and Swedish English pretty good

[Music]

it's really good

obviously doesn't get everything correct

especially words that are more

[Music]

I wanted to find the English equipment

surface

sometimes I wouldn't trust it for all

this stuff yeah it doesn't do great work

because in Swedish is a Germanic

language closely related to English and

Google Translate is english-based

so any other Germanic languages similar

to English it does well

[Music]

but but I mean

[Music]

I'm

[Music]

would probably and actually don't know

how to replace this the one citizen I

mean it's understandable and it's like

it feels like more

and

how would you say it

cute

that's the word I never can see

you know the word

it's not like proper proper I think

but it's like understandable and

and I think your innocence was awesome

like I'm curious how Google does

something

not accepted or something at the end and

I think that's not really like a

fully proper English sentence it's

grammatically correct I think but

semantically it's not like

[Music]

props not semantically problems

I'll be right back thank you

wrote that two minutes ago when I was

thinking

so

[Music]

I would say

if the language is available

that you should use and

a service called The Deep l

it's just deep l.com

and there you go

I just showed a fast sentence in Google

I wasn't really yeah

and that's outside important thing you

need to make sure that the grammar you

put in is correct

and you also two sentences in there

actually so

because I mean if you you write if you

spell it or write it incorrectly if you

want to translate something give

yourself this more likely to be great

[Music]

but yeah d l does have English to

Swedish and I would say that

I am curious of how

Google does right like that

it gives me the exact same sentence as

you got

is this correct

[Music]

is the exact same sentence as you got

there so yeah

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

languages are available and then if not

then I use Google Translate

because that website also allows you to

click on a word and then see other

options so if something seems it correct

or when it's not completely useful

because if you don't understand the

original sentence

it doesn't help much but

[Music]

sometimes sometimes something might not

seem to

[Music]

make sense then you can like click on a

word and then switch it out for

another word and then it will re paste

sentence and then it might make more

sense

because languages say are in complex and

simple sentence can mean a lot of

different things and imply a lot of

things and that would result in

different translations

I've seen was talking about space and

not spaces in stars and planets but the

other context referring to an area we

would have the space to Cosmos which

refers to how to space the correct words

should have been me yet no it's me yes

there you go

[Music]

yeah

that's my best event I gave my attention

[Music]

many many items

can help one of those are great

well when I said with cat and I don't

know yes wait a minute this is a Slavic

language

in Islamic languages the C is pronounced

as s

t s

regardless of content

yeah yeah I think regardless of well

maybe that's not in Polish

because polish is strange

[Music]

but in other Islamic languages you'd see

it's uh

my bro wants to use the PC

do you have teeth

no don't use the busy

[Music]

or you can join on your phone

conception

the pets

my thesis only mine no one else can have

it

oh yeah I moved this down

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

foreign

so

I'm going to draw the

SE things

thank you

[Music]

since this is an animated one it has to

be improved approved though which is a

shame

I don't think these are Autumn Auto

approved foreign

[Music]

yeah because every single animated one

I've uploaded which is two that's known

that's required to be

proved first

even though I uploading our picture

which has primitively approved and I'm

applying one of the

uh

switch

on effects to it so it should no it's

already perfect but what I mean

together

but sadly I can only have

two animated at the moment

so

unless I get

13 subscriptions at this moment

[Music]

um

[Music]

but yes

because after setting more subscriptions

I will get another slot and that will

give me another animated and another

subscription email

still once took a few days to prove

slightly down yeah the few days oh

because uh okay yeah I think the when I

uploaded the response email

think that one had to be approved before

it showed up

but then these ones I made on stream

I lost a image making stream they were

approved instantly

why except the headpad

I assume that is because they have some

AI

checking

for suspicious content basically what

Google discord and stuff has and I

assume they found the

a bit too suspicious

so it was flagged to be manually prepped

and then it was approved

within 24 hours

still took a while but

like after

I salute and at the eye I didn't know

hand Holdings lived there

[Music]

the air confused handhelding and head

bets

but I mean I think a human could be kind

of achieved

oh

but it was approved so it's all good

good Target

[Music]

there's a headpad let it taste it not

let it say

I need to taste it

effects

that's not a pet

even has a headband that's too difficult

one

[Music]

[Music]

that's the only thing I can think of

all right

I'm not subscribed

[Music]

but the I am however subscribed to

tranquion it was here before she doesn't

have a headpad

that he has this one

and it's a cute one

um

and add little little bunny bunny

[Music]

um

it's still nice too good for this world

[Music]

therefore you have to get rid of you

Mary

[Music]

I'm invited to be nice and kind than

that exactly I do

agree that

no don't get rid of me

we need to transfer you to a good world

[Music]

wait what

[Music]

yeah he's too good for this world so he

needs to leave

that's the only logically and the only

logical conclusion

[Music]

you agree too taser could you I think he

agreed to you

[Music]

um

being

I mean there's a lot of beans

[Music]

is very kind also

yeah I need I need to fix the

[Music]

um

yeah why not I don't have beans because

I'm a bunny bunnies don't have beans

as a misconception that bunnies have

beans

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

you can probably find a can of beans at

the store

[Music]

oh

[Music]

long boy

make it longer add like two pieces in

the middle

which I assume you're supposed to be

able to make it as long as you want but

do more to be it right so add two pieces

so I have the middle piece be three

pieces now

foreign

touch them

eat them don't wait

laughs

and right now

I'm doing the cleanup base

[Music]

so I can then do the final night watch

there's like a three face

drawing

foreign

[Music]

but it is like five of them that should

be on a single line I don't remember

when it starts line breaking

and I don't know I don't remember if I

fixed it because it started to because

it really should make it so

he's like

[Music]

yeah I need to I need to find a formula

so like

because they are showing larger when

it's on an emote

[Music]

on screen then it's and then as and then

I should have them full size until they

no longer fit and when you add another

one

it actually fits when it starts line

breaking that's when it has to scale it

down

so that them all fit on one line and not

I don't know how

long that should go on

and up to six maybe in a row I don't

know

and then it can start line breaking or

something

I I have an idea of how to do that

check this out

okay I'm checking

oh okay six

yeah six feet in a row nice

and that's a very long it's so long it's

it's line breaking but if you do

oh Lord if

you alone

it's pot oh yeah it is like portals I

think

[Music]

but yeah if you do a total of six of

them so four mid sections

uh that should be on a single Road

that would be good

anyway

[Music]

what did I did that that's like

yes

oh

cute outfit time

[Music]

all right

yeah I guess I guess the underwears cute

too

even though some would probably describe

this more like hot and cute

shift

[Music]

s

but I'm glad you think it's cute

[Music]

it's of course even platform and arts so

we are cute anyway

[Music]

it's so cute

I'm getting messages on this card

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

yeah I think that's on

and then I

[Music]

decided outside

[Music]

next thing

yeah no because this is the line of

things

so let me actually accurately copy over

them to the other side

[Music]

break one through to the other side

that's a song lyrics

I don't know the laser so

I don't know the title of the song

[Music]

oh no it's nice

a little bit print here let me add it

[Music]

I'll just copy of an exists when way way

in the butter be created

then I will do a proper one

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

now to do the action line art

thank you

[Music]

oh this one something

[Music]

is

about it

[Music]

that's gonna be uh

[Music]

fun fun is cute even if it doesn't

even if she doesn't even wear anything

foreign

to get that one

[Music]

this special one

[Music]

was called DD

now to do the proper full outline

my wheels feel down and only it's time

to do it so your wingspan

I don't remember your well-being valid

here

here that's been the real spin but

but we don't have a license you don't

have a license

[Music]

I'm just joking

are you

[Music]

nah

is

[Music]

I second this is

but I do not

we will do rear wheels beam when you

come up with more ideas to put on the

Wheel

and we cut this today we can discuss

this part I'm drawing at the moment

for example the the food idea which

another streamer has uh

seems like it we will see out of that's

not how it works it's pink

I'm the princess I ruled this place

that's not how it works that's not how

any of these words

are very cute princess thank you

I'm like bonuses

princess because it's cute it's rather

than

any Royal duties

and my royalty this is taking care of

and hosting is

three

I guess

resume with an iron paw

are we ruled with a fluffy part

[Music]

but yeah

that is the uh

[Music]

so yes regular if regarding the food

thing so so

just like how the on the wheel the

outfit has three options and the

exercising has three options the food

scene could also be three different

options

and then

[Music]

there

and then the food things would be like

things for me to

come see

but it should be things that can be

preferably quickly

quickly prepared

and can store for a long time in case it

doesn't show up on the wheel for a while

if you look at iron park for me

baby what if I no this is a completely

a capitalist this capitalistic every

week to give me money

[Music]

pay for a subscription and you get the

emotes okay

[Music]

true

[Music]

is there horror games on the Wheel

habitat watching I think I heard the

Wednesday freezers you see me like

pay this horror game on like an extra

stream on on the Wednesday if it lands

on it or something

because I did prefer it being something

quick I can do

during a stream because the wheel the

idea was to spin the wheel after getting

five subscriptions regardless if they're

gifted or not

[Music]

um

it should be points so if you do a tier

two or tier three I think it teaches

like tier two is two points and tier

three is five points or something I

think

33s has it has been immediately

yes yes that's fine that's fine

but yeah there could be things because

yeah I wanted to like

have a drawing thing on that too which I

would do often and finish with this

dream so it's not drawing me a little

bit

[Music]

I am open for this because uh one idea

could evolve into

completely different thank you

[Music]

learned yesterday even if they're not

feasible

whatever doing this I'm supposed to

really try this

gender looks like it's copy and pasted

they should all be hand-drawn

on

digital

[Music]

is it perfectly

um

possiblyn I got a surprise for you I'll

show you tomorrow

I'm excited

on stream or offstream

[Music]

if I may ask the prime yeah if you if

you mention it on stream people want to

know what the surprise is

offstream yeah in that case you might

say you should have said it in private

now people want to know what it is

sorry you did it to yourself

is it Frankie

[Music]

yeah

I mean depending on

no I don't know exactly exactly what did

you do kitten see what you had done I

think something special for you Evelyn

okay yeah say something like

directly related to me

it would be black here he is

I have no idea what it did so I mean

it's a surprise so it's of course I

don't know at least

I made outfit

[Music]

okay just a strawberry surprise yes

send all the way to Sweden

it's a it's a ticket to the upcoming

circus

I don't know if there's enough coming

circus

you're probably somewhere

circus

meow

round

deep

I'm familiar no I'm not naughty

what does the fox say

yep

[Music]

part part

what the fox does it say

okay I'm gonna drawing this here

15 times

[Music]

eat bananas oh yeah I do eat bananas

from

from the tip

and down

[Music]

I don't eat them sideways

let's show it show it in my mouth

it just it's just eating banana there is

nothing strange with it

any weird ideas you have it's all on you

what

all right which one is it now I steal

that one

well uh let's let's continue switching

around the different how to start

outfits how to wear

no it's Coco's anyway

[Music]

[Music]

eating bananas that why is indeed very

purple

I'm sorry

I shouldn't talk about eating bananas

the Norman way anymore

[Music]

[ __ ]

[Music]

nothing tastes not right here have a

banana

yeah I'm gonna have bananas only

yes do that

just remove the peel from the banana

and

slowly put it in my mouth you know so I

don't choke

I am not into that

[Music]

this channel is rated for adults by the

way

[Music]

you can eat strawberries

the these are tasty teeth for one taste

[Music]

I do like strawberry steam I can have

strawberries and but that is

slowly fancy

yeah I mean you don't don't like

thrust it into my mouth

that's

that's that kid

yeah if you if you like any

[Music]

one

[Music]

my head find it very energized when

eating strawberry

yeah I mean if you give me a strawberry

I might be very entertained

[Music]

that trust you're slowly gently exactly

I'll show inspected

trying to take notes yeah yeah do you

take notes

make sure to take notes

[Music]

[Music]

let's um

see

this is the Thomas jeans normally are to

be honest

[Music]

did that work

[Music]

for some reason when you add a regular

email Emoji it's gonna break Steamworks

I don't know why it's not exact yeah I

think I know why

x wait

X

all right

that's the one yeah I think

that's just as an emote

[Music]

so if I do

that it for some reason breaks

but if you do one that doesn't wait

which one is is the trending as a

performance

there's been a few but I don't remember

which they are

yeah I think it's like isn't it carrots

uh again no roots because it's Swedish

yeah that one does not render as an

emote

so if I do carrots and then

in that case it's fine

I have my stuff to kill which handles

the

Emoji that renders as property movies

and I need to figure out why some of

them are interested in his proper emojis

why carrot why is that not why is that

just a picture of a piece of cake I mean

because that's rendering for why is it

running in full screen last person here

what I mean it treats that is text

[Music]

I have to figure out what's going on

with that

dream of Chris

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

economy down after that

exciting

[Music]

yeah it was a good decision to make this

this

splashing pumpkins they come in

quite handy

[Music]

no it's fine too next

I can tell from left and right lit

uh yeah but you can do that uh okay you

can do that go free wait like a facing

whatever it's called Frank if I don't

remember however if you do spend the 150

points

on the disease on the plastic one

if you spend 157 points or 10 coins

that oh yeah it's Australia because I

still haven't refreshed uh this chat you

can turn that around and everyone can

see it including my bike

which of course it costs 150 points but

you know

it never loves everyone to see see them

and feeding myself

dang it

foreign

because you do have to go

to my channel you can do it even though

I'm offline

basic person chats then go to channel

points like that you want

to customize an email

it and then you have it available at 24

hours it cumbersome

at least it was an easy way of doing

that but

but at least everyone can see it at that

point

[Music]

okay

[Music]

no I should probably do a proper

like this

and then delete it

you go

and finally

added cheek to cheek right and now it's

not chin that's the time

cheek is about the chin that's not about

on each side of the face

and I'm sorry

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

that's the

that part done

[Music]

and it does mean that I have to

basically

foreign

[Music]

way

that's fine

[Music]

[Music]

now

[Music]

[Music]

let's see does it consider

[Music]

consider those in your daughter hidden

are the same thing notice

[Music]

delicate

[Music]

and that was the wrong kind of thing

[Music]

please

[Music]

it is laid on top so it doesn't really

matter

what it is

[Music]

[Music]

then

and name of these this footage yes now

because I haven't closed

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

my Ram is 28 degrees

that would be too hard for me

but here are already two hot one punch

[Music]

you didn't hear that

foreign

[Music]

like that

I say the sun is shining onto the room

constantly the whole day

and the room is like

a

well

if English is important word from

Swedish and like I passed you

but it is important from finishing style

so like a sauna

[Music]

thank you and now

[Music]

I should probably do this first

now since I should

since I'm going to try this on

individually anyway

[Music]

you beat me to that one

[Music]

and like a sauna

fun funny

nice is kindness most amazing funny out

there I speak for everyone

[Music]

but it's my mouth

I don't know if I can actually use them

though

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

don't agree

it makes me embarrassed

[Music]

I shouldn't be because this is exactly

what I like

I want to be cute

basically

[Music]

but I'm socially parked with it

[Music]

I agree with me

I mean you are cute

yeah

if I say you are a kid you are

everything's suffocated beautiful

I love you

on your uh

I can't speak

you are not just a kind

I think

because

of what

what's the cause of all of this

one funny

one funny

I wanted I wanted the first sauna that

could reflect the

what I wanted for this stream

except that I made my headphones before

I decided to stream

it was it was to be perfect

my inner cuteness

well I think like cute was one of me

specific quests

[Music]

it's beautiful she said it you are

secretary

[Music]

oh

you're so fantastic yeah

just

so nice

[Music]

and you're making me

hey

nothing

losing my words

a fine line

I'm depends on where you live there see

it's only four lines on screen you're

outside and inside is just as beautiful

but like cute have you seen my inside

and that's what is

the purpose in life

you got inside and outside will shine

upon a personality God that's what is

making us

[Music]

thank you okay that's

I was going to agree that as like that's

the purpose of life you're inside

your insights

I need them

you are feeling

it's just inside heart

I think my lungs are beautiful though

[Music]

you mean I have a beautiful heart

oh I haven't really thought about

in front of the head

[Music]

that's a problem I just

re-hand this something like that

[Music]

Maybe

as a whole

[Music]

taster and I meet in real life and they

sir gives me a compliment and starts

blushing like that and then I start

splashing because Stacy gave me a

compliment and then we are standing left

she has the most beautiful personality

Aaron is Mr pistache

I'm glad you're around here

enjoy

you people are the best

I wouldn't be this

happy and nice is nice

that's the word I was looking for

well this happened if I

this point for all of you

foreign

such a nice place to be

[Music]

um

[Music]

no it doesn't matter because

all right the heat worked out anyway

because

um

this one is more than one kiss

every time

we start with fun fun foreign

yes

[Music]

yeah that sounds

that would be for the year

[Music]

foreign

hydrate everyone comes everyone

he isn't a confidence and then I'm I

don't know I will be flashing

[Music]

I of course have to wear my which I

should make

um yes

and then I can take an ear and cover my

face

whoosh

is hydrated thank you foreign

I hope to show you the surprise tomorrow

and now he's watching it again you will

love it finally bye-bye kitten thank you

so much for coming by

[Music]

it's always amazing to have you here

makes me happy

[Music]

I am not hydrated at all I want to drink

fantastic today

well you can hydrate every time someone

relieves a hydrated I guess it does show

up in chat as far as they do

well I forgot my pollen mat yeah that

sounds important

don't forget the bottles

the annoying pollen

foreign

but

they

then still redraw it but I use it as a

very very rough guide

thank you

I changed like trying to see both at the

same time but

happy tree

because I still want it

that I don't want it just look like it's

being flipped back and forth

yeah I don't hate pollen it hates me

yeah oh

wait

I need to pick something new

okay because you have redeemed the other

way so much you can get a special one

already here it comes

foreign

it doesn't hate me

but it's sure I hate my body smiley

I'm so cute oh my it's lit glute I can

confirm

let's look at that

it is a cute pumpkin

[Music]

so beautiful

it's the most amazing outfit I've ever

seen on her

warning

[Music]

the other lucky

default one I guess the one I had first

I also had a heart

but maybe you like it when it's front

and center

[Music]

and you like how it's it's cute

[Music]

show me off my other regulations

[Music]

this one was a bit tricky to draw

this collection it's so cute

I mean considering all the pictures I

have one funny different underwear I

guess I guess it's like another

recollection

foreign

[Music]

doing that one when it's up screen

I think we've seen them all now yeah you

have actually seen all of them that was

the last one

uh I mean these two more I haven't shown

today but

those uh

the fish one and the racing one

but otherwise but I have shown those two

before

I wanted to show the last one which

I didn't know when it would be beautiful

with it

I can't wait till the day we speak too

much

yeah we need to I really want more stuff

on it and then when you spin it

I thought I really want because at the

end I don't want like the same thing

come up every time

they I mean what and then a pregnancy

[Music]

from two pure

nah you're you're the perfect amount of

unpureness

[Music]

but I guess I should make like

a special design

Body wheel because the wheel can end up

underwear as well

so it's like rewarding

we need less of that one

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

okay and then

they count together with this one

[Music]

and then

[Music]

[Music]

yep that's right

well

there's a bit of overlapped face

that is my

[Music]

it's meant to go together with it

and I don't think both should be raised

only one side of the time

[Music]

[Music]

I'm going I'm going this is currently

long and strong stream

but I do want to complete this drawing

I will add it to these cards I won't be

able to use it though myself because I

don't

have a

neutral on this chord which I do find a

bit silly why I'm the server owner at

least I had an exception

I understand you don't want like give

everyone who is an address let's

Ministry today

rights to use those which is fine and

also probably for security reason to not

encouraging people to just add random

administrative administrators and press

that word for me badly but I think

[Music]

and then I will do this but let me

just get a slight inspiration by

[Music]

online there so I can kind of combine

foreign

yes

but since it's meant as more like an

icon

let me

[Music]

kiss adding here

that department

that's good that's good I will go

through it after stream but it's good

the more ideas you can

you basically just so so as much as you

can and I'll pick out what I think works

the more ideas you have the uh yeah I

mean one of these you have the greater

the chance is that some of those I won't

think will work and some of those might

be more possible to modify to make work

sometimes that's great

maybe not the most excessive but some

yeah I mean it's perfectly fine to have

less interesting stuff on the wheel too

because that makes the more interesting

stuff more exciting

[Music]

because

yeah

it wouldn't be exciting if everything

have the same thing it comes every time

bye I mean

of course it's nice

yes

and then this one should have a

different color and black

[Music]

I think it could possibly I stand up

feel nice

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

face

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I think that's fine too

the assets you're not going to be able

to see the details hopefully I'm

spending way too much and I think

there's nothing we have to see

that isn't that typically me

[Music]

yeah I think faceless is fine

but yeah it's going to a different color

[Music]

[Music]

certainly helps but everyone is free to

just add more

more and more and more

yeah

and now I did another one I haven't even

gotten that far yet

I left town

okay so taking a bit longer to make the

animated one because they're

keyframes

here things I have to read drama

sometimes hey should I shoot for 10 uh

I mean if you have if you have like four

more ideas please share

let's see something you can hear Disco

DM I forgot I had a spark what no

that thing yes you didn't have a

speckled kitten

foreign

[Music]

you're so kind

it's into something extremely sour there

yes it is if you mean candy or like sour

candy yeah yeah yeah

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

yeah if there's like a long lasting food

like I I so some students had like a

very very

uh what do you call it in English

I was going to say strong that would be

delicious Swedish

which is the whole Topic in the steps

too I hope which I find interesting uh

like chili

pot that's what you got right yeah hot

hot

like hot noodles or something like that

which I for what I've done is quick to

make but it's really really hot which

which could be fun I guess

and I think noodles is like is something

you can store for quite a long time so

that so that could work

I mean

yeah hot in English has many many

okay uh

now I have to restart this card for this

thing to work

right now

yeah you looking at one point for being

here

most

nice looking underwear let's say that

yeah

you're hot

no well he

he said he well I was I was such a need

another design which I have used today

foreign

[Music]

yes

[Music]

let me finish this drawing

and I think oh my

and that was now fun funny it's a sporty

bunny

that's that's her racing outfit but it's

only around the way

address

in front of everyone and them

is silly again

distracting the other trailers

thank you

is there a problem kitten

no complaining

I'm happy I'll enjoy the Stream

it I did enjoy the stream too

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

a stream would then have been as fun if

you are living here

okay I hope you like the gift but there

is

it okay

take it easy Captain tomorrow won't come

faster

I am already excited but yeah I do

really appreciate the gifts

it's there

it is

it is really something

[Music]

oh what a funny thing

laughs

thank you for the 100 beats I don't have

anything special for donating any pizza

[Music]

but you have achieved

in fifth place

yeah yeah it's okay that's good

I don't know if what

could happen I mean what I should

increase

beats donation

is if you donate

according to Twitch I don't know if they

are correct or not

and if you donate 900 more doesn't

matter when you do it so if you donate

100 every month that means at the 10th

months you will unlock one additional

email from my stream and for my channel

but you you will get access to the bonus

one

forever

forever they said they wouldn't run out

and I does not have tweaks

but let me let me continue oh really

kitten I am very very interested see

thinking you're making people interested

staying yeah is it a carrot no make a

yogi maker doesn't give me carrots

and another character I really knows

what it might be

um

well

I could have some ideas of what it might

be

with them

I can't say for sure of course

that was the wrong button

I'm certainly the carrots

carrot cheese strawberry

specialist it's not a drawing yeah I'm

still waiting for the drawings

because I want to see what you have done

[Music]

because you make kid drawings

fine it's a blueberry

what is this

[Music]

what what is this

tomorrow if we get to try yes just

trying tomorrow

it feels like you have said that that

you get it tomorrow for several days now

but

is this an email oh it's near mode

or an emoji that's why it doesn't show

up

but why does it show up like

that on the twitch chat is like a circle

with stripes on it

red

it's one of the very new ones so it does

it twitch doesn't even recognize it and

it does it doesn't exist on my system

either she doesn't even show up as text

because when an emoji isn't recognized

in the chat field here when for example

when it's in the carrot it's just

displayed as a regular emoji on my

system so my sister must have the Emoji

but tomorrow yes yeah

okay

but I'm at work tomorrow uh tomorrow I'm

off work

maybe you said that it will be Tuesday

for yesterday or something

maybe I misremember

okay I'll keep this off work tomorrow

and tomorrow I work

he didn't work on Wednesday

every hour no no no no no hints need I

mean it's tomorrow I can wait

you don't need any hints

like last time

not saying that was fantastic

a really small one no no no hints needed

give him

I mean I give a gift in itself is so

much

I appreciate hard games even if I can't

express my appreciation

and he really appreciate it

it makes me very very happy

yeah I don't have to add anything more

there

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

keep confirm same thing

okay so there

can get hard because in my heart oh yeah

I guess yeah everything about doing bump

on holding your hearts that's that you

need to make one of those two

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

I mean I guess I could let you know

tomorrow or something I don't know

[Music]

no need to be curious unless this is

okay

yeah it's

totally

no it's obvious that strawberry

chocolate covered straw it's a box of

chocolates

I would like a box of chocolates well

actually actually to be honest

for the amount of money you spent on a

box of chocolates

spend it on that chocolate bar and you

probably get like two three four times

this month and I rarely take it

and honestly honestly

because someone will probably argue like

it's this thought that counts or

something but like it's a nice gift like

that but if you really really want to

defeat

if you really want to

and give me a nice gift

hey

obviously I'm not going to ask for kids

doing

getting more

the amount you spend

is something at Europe anymore

but but don't spend money on chocolates

for me

[Music]

but nothing

special I can't eat chocolate see

kitten can't eat chocolate so therefore

he's giving the chocolate to me

no no don't give the fox chocolate no

Mickey what are you doing

and the ones can't eat chocolate

very very cup because I got shot this is

this is an important important thing

and there's slides missed I guess it's

part of me because it is a common thing

to say that dogs can't eat chocolate

which is correct but most animals can't

eat chocolate it's not a dog thing it's

an animal thing

technically we humans can't eat

chocolate I mean we can that was a wrong

essay

chocolate is also toxic to humans let's

Okay like that that's a better way to

say but we have a way to break it down

so it's not toxic unless you eat too

much so the body no longer can break it

down

in that case you'll get sick

so there we go right so that was an

important thing

[Music]

so every time someone says dogs can't

eat chocolate I really want to say

not that I want to wish that kind of and

know it all person

yeah

most animals can't eat chocolate

but technically you're correct though

it's gonna eat chocolate

and fox is like it's not dog but it's

like

any day

I don't know if it's the family or

something

[Music]

thank you

more dark than a cat is

but I'm not mistaken

hey

so it's an amazing and money

also on the 24th I got something for him

so much

yes

book club

wait a chocolate wait what is that some

language

I don't I don't recognize the spelling I

mean it's it it's Swedish but I am is

friendly no I mean I can eat chocolate

but it's just something else

yeah this fox eat chocolates

yeah I think that's that fox is a bit

sick looking at that pain just ordered

uh one troy ounce silver coin

actually how many grams is that matches

things in normal units

foreign

[Music]

precious metals

box is canine breed like that oh it is a

sitting in canine

I thought it was yeah I thought it was

like his place in feline or be like day

or something and

candy day so it's like catfish and

doggish and then Canada split up in

a canine and

bull pine or something like that

well I could be wrong about that

and Bears or something that is

because bears are more related to dogs

than cats as well I think

but foxes are more related to dogs than

bears

Daddy

but I could that's just what I remember

gonna be wrong

it has a cheetah on it oh is it a fast

green

polish

and it's Swedish it got that weird sound

it's not

this is

it's a it's one of those weird Swedish

sounds

not every Swedish dialect has that sound

if Finland

speakers because Finland has Swedish as

an official language

the Finland accent and some other accent

I think abnormous Norton parts of Sweden

I think I could be wrong with that

doesn't have the ah that was very harsh

sound at all and replace it with

instead so they say chocolate

[Music]

and the air is everything

I wouldn't know how many grams

well I mean

that is for the Electric System was

invented so someone like I ordered

uh 50 pounds of that oh here you got 50

pounds but that that's like 48 pounds no

it's 50 pounds according to me

yeah that we wanted to get rid of in

Europe that's why metric system

because one gram is one gram and nothing

else

[Music]

I don't know how to convert your answers

to regular ounces the cup converted to

my team

that he's saying well

Pine is that something else

well we'll pick this apartment I

remember that

what beats

and then there is like Evie isn't that

like a dog rabbit kind of thing

like a fox rabbit

Umbreon is kinda

also rabbits please

only thing I know one draw islands is 12

1 troy pound is 24 ounces whereas a

normal pound is 60 normal ounces

but uh

yes this means that that's right and and

I know that the one troy ounce is more

than a regular ounce if you want but one

troy pound is less than a regular pound

isn't the English system fantastic

yeah I've always

have a nice day

at work I hope work is fine

thank you

empty

get exercising

I guess everybody here on DM's later

kitten

people arresting me on Discord

I just have to check that stuff

no it's just a

someone started streaming message

and speaking of steaming do you think

Lolly dear has been finished streaming

because I have been like almost an hour

all the time yes she's done streaming

the no raiding

[Music]

no they didn't learn anything

our current function is commissioning me

art what

no pets

you know

hello

Penny welcome

I appreciate I appreciate it come by

um but you are currently confusing me a

lot what are you talking about

[Music]

I'm committing yours

I mean I'm

I'm trying mine

my cheerleader

emotions

and also I know

a few more hours yeah the your redeem is

so cute

because

yeah I was I was thinking of that

reference to something

silly

this is a sales team

[Music]

we are being silly

then copy our this one

[Music]

but I should see if I can make it

[Music]

no

yeah yeah I did move it I think it's

artificial

no

there there

my name is sometimes

yeah maybe I should

be transparents and see what I'm doing

[Music]

foreign

so there we go

that's more natural it should be

positioned

roughly

and laughing at him and

oh I think

nobody wanted to do there was to change

the outfit to her

the fun fun isn't showing her tummy

anymore

but uh hey I have a key system

[Music]

it's

[Music]

way off screen so that sometimes I just

do picky about things that doesn't

matter

[Music]

in fact thank you

so I am

[Music]

I what colors should everything be I

mean do you like pink as a dress

but maybe

[Music]

kid yeah that's why that's why I had it

like that

[Music]

I did find it cute

[Music]

it's kind of hard to see me

[Music]

there you go yes it still start hurting

it

wait why did it

something like this

that's a bit silly

[Music]

so it filled out so the pink filled out

all the lines

but still miss this corner

[Music]

uh they feel tool in this program can be

a bit silly sometimes

[Music]

but yeah and he just need an idea for

what the

[Music]

color of that should be and then I also

need

s to connect but that should be another

problem

[Music]

yeah that's the problem

yes

[Music]

but bad tummy yes bad tummy

but I mean give me the function please

please yeah I was yeah I think that's

the Middle East Ern

if you want to make sure uh

it's it's good to throw it there to be

fair when you have suggested the

realities at least well yeah yeah if you

do come up just read some emote idea you

can add it to this uh suggestion

a topic on this setting

uh did I have face part on this he said

get done

[Music]

this that's an obvious one I guess I

didn't

because it doesn't matter if multiple

shows up

a face palm that's a simple one I don't

need too much more description another

so

let's get the suggestion

okay

exactly sure if I wanted thicker with

pink pom-poms maybe I should go with

yellow actually

using yellow will but good

or would that not mean that's nice

I mean I can try I can all change

but yeah this one is

probably the wrong color

at me

and then I

like that it's like quality difference

maybe it shouldn't be white maybe we

should put pink

maybe this part should be Pinky

kissing oh

that sounds interesting

should add it to the list

yeah and that's what's with the blushing

shouldn't be like blowing a kiss so

she'll be like

foreign

[Music]

I think that could be nice

[Music]

thanks

I did this matter now

[Music]

and let's see that one minute

maintenance

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

make good no it doesn't but that's

outside anyway

okay that has looked good

no I didn't want to do that until I

messed up everything up

[Music]

I promise messing things up

yeah I hit something like that

something

that's what I wanted to do

but he decided to do something

random

[Music]

[Music]

all right

[Music]

[Music]

this is about the

currently pink body

puns

[Music]

go and then to make sure

that I can change the turn something

that's a bit silly

and

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

full-scale once and I want different

Skies to look nasty

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

yeah yeah I was going to try to make

this in yellow

[Music]

it is a perfect car not too much

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

yeah

I think pink pump the yellow pom-poms

would be better because of that case

they are distinguished from the bone

which is pink already

that's a good idea

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

um

beautiful lady

would be a good chilly day

he was here on everyone

like share on everyone as she's here on

I don't know what to do

yeah this is taking a long time to

complete

I have not done yet

okay same I mean what

happened

I wish I could give it some wraps

redeem when she's playing her Sports

out with our underwear

[Music]

everyone in famous

I mean technically you could always tell

me your episode

regardless of what she's wearing

I think

that is one of the animations that has

to be like triggered and around

automatically I will that I can that's

yeah I really wanted to do animation

trigger like things that happens to

problem and that will be something

attitude

when I get the

one mix it up

fixes when they release their update

when all that stuff will be easily

available and doesn't require running

[Music]

on Chef's third party surfaces

[Music]

something like that

and then it should be the other way

around

thank you

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

and then I just need

and those aren't that one

[Music]

said these these things I had to do

something about

[Music]

[Music]

it I mean I need that incorrect

[Music]

this one should be on bathroom

that's that's how you want to do

[Music]

and those girls together kid

[Music]

folders for these

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I should probably do that

things individually

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

and now

[Music]

and I think this is all

right

fine fine

thirsty

it's such a cute activation

[Music]

I do love it

[Music]

but I can't see on it

[Music]

yeah he doesn't need more than that I

always

so that's the three frames

[Music]

to

I'll start with

[Music]

yeah I think uh sheer or or Pom-Pom

pom-poms

what happened like here

pom-poms

[Music]

um

the scraps it good enough

[Music]

because like edit share is part of jelly

day

[Music]

so I think that might be the best one

yes he's down there because yeah it

lifts up

it's a cute pumpkin you can do it uh

you can adopt

I think I'll stick to here in that case

and then

yeah

[Music]

uh all right that was the same but for

some reason no explains but it looks so

weird

and there's this spring

[Music]

it's Sports

and also I guess and honestly this chili

dad which is wearing both obviously

have a bare tummy

of course like

you just can't see it but

but of course she would that would be

[Music]

people

looks amazing

I'm thinking

that I sleep around the frame too should

I add I think I I should add some kind

of bounciness to it

somehow I don't exactly know how

[Music]

so like probably just stretch out

the arm slightly

[Music]

the celebration

[Music]

and yeah if I do

B drop on

which I probably should yeah when yeah

so when mix it up does release its

update I should really redropont and

have the

and make all those outfits

even further

there are probably they won't release it

every time soon so

[Music]

yeah because what I am thinking let's

see if I can make it work

if I make a

copy of this one

and then I basically take all of this

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

stretch out

okay not part of it

because this part needs to be unchanged

[Music]

[Music]

don't need that part how to move

the difference means I had to read Duty

and then like

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

this part

[Music]

I'd refresh this chat for me

give me the armpit

what do you mean this part

which is the a Bend of the arm which is

that

okay

Bend of the arm or something is called

in English

but in Swedish we just call it armboge

[Music]

armband

[Music]

okay if I'm going to do this it probably

has to be

saturated

[Music]

like that

yeah I think I think that was good okay

let me do

[Music]

lift up two and right up two

absolutely

and then I really

can't finish

[Music]

and similar on this one I need to copy

over these

[Music]

thank you

it had something on it

[Music]

[Music]

this one should have been good

technique this part should be good or

anything

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

getting a bit of

bounce in the street

[Music]

of course I need to

[Music]

if you do those parts

I thought this

[Music]

foreign

just re-ed it again

[Music]

if I did with the filter

[Music]

whoops

and because this thing is on

there

hey on

party

[Music]

and of course

which thing is fine

everything is fine the third one

foreign

[Music]

oh yeah I forgot

no problem

um

so this is the exaggerated

[Music]

BF

slightly before the intended one

[Music]

foreign

flight

bouncy feet I hope

[Music]

and then it should be on the way

let's go

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

it's just going to be a new moments like

a short time

between

I can try both see whichever works but

[Music]

because yeah I can hold on to the

stretched out frame it's just stretched

out poses for a while

[Music]

I think that would be good

[Music]

[Music]

another question is just which speed you

should play at

[Music]

well now again I would stay safe and

plan I had an amazing time changes today

it was it was

you you added a lot to the stream I'm

very happy that you did show up

and hope to see you in 3D streams you

are such an amazing person

[Music]

and you are abandoned

cute

and trying to think of things to say I'm

here well I'm here here you are great

too kitten foreign

[Music]

yeah I know that

I know that fratia actually meant her

what's the present

okay sir

Arya presents

[Music]

um

I'm still here that's good

that's good

okay there we go

yeah I think this can work

now it's just the timing that is the big

question

[Music]

let me save this one

so we'll document

there's here before I export it curves

okay I need to keep it in good quality

of course

[Music]

since I

yeah definitely more speed

seven out of 30 minutes great job he

have been going up for quite a while now

yeah don't they

[Music]

all right

[Music]

it was meant to be

half a second at five seconds

[Music]

[Music]

okay I'm the timing I have to tweak here

so now it just feels right

okay I want to say it's normally I

forgot to see it normally and there you

go

[Music]

okay it is good

yeah

do you feel like it should have a bit

more speed

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

and

[Music]

[Music]

tonight's more tweaking and I think I'm

happy with it

but of course I

would like some opinions

[Music]

now let's scan it down to

the intended email size and also yes

and the last supper for underway okay

so cute

underwear which has not yet been

redeemed

[Music]

oh wait

[Music]

let me do that again

[Music]

how do I

[Music]

now this is a bit annoying

[Music]

foreign

I clicked on that one

[Music]

I click on that one now what was the

where's that not an option I need

because when I export it as the gif

it wants to make the outline the way

it's transparent it makes it transparent

towards White

and I don't want that I just want it

but that would just look bad

[Music]

as to be expecting

[Music]

and I I need sorry yeah this is this is

probably one part I nothing what I'm

doing

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

okay

I have to

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

outline

Conference of onion behind it

you're right there you go

okay

basically

trying to figure out

[Music]

think I think that will be good

so let's do it for all of these then

that that's brand new

so basically how to do it

transparency from everything I love

alternative

and then

across the tune

just wants to

if you could just consider I don't know

the background to be black instead of

white and

within the diet to be

what it should fade towards

that would be nice so it's face towards

black meaning that it's the outside that

is black and nothing else

oh

I can't don't have to be do this

[Music]

doing this

then

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

doesn't show up

and Export the exported One display

faster

[Music]

there's some celebrate transparency but

not anything what I'm looking for

[Music]

[Music]

anyway let me

export this

and post it on the server

[Music]

and so it's probably not going to play

correctly because that's just what

that's just how it likes to be

so now add it to General shed

uh

[Music]

I mean it's actually playing fine

so now we can go to the

the general chat on Discord and see if

you like the speed of it or if I should

adjust the speed of something

yeah

he's nice okay thank you

The Bouncing as effective it doesn't

really

it's so much

and if I try to increase the pulse and

the length of that it's it's actually

expand

I guess it's just I guess it adds slight

[Music]

Improvement

[Music]

so it's just not one

maybe she's training purposely unboxing

well I guess I guess time is my

understand I don't know

in that case

I will go ahead

and save it

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

so I don't know

if I could go bye bye bye yeah this is

better again

[Music]

yeah unless you're willing to give me

like

[Music]

emergency starts

sadly

[Music]

I mean I can just

they will still be in the like the

galleries I can just add it anytime just

put it back it's not lost forever

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

twinks

[Music]

[Music]

yeah I do think that's better actually

giving a bit more speed

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

extra picky about animated ones

[Music]

so I mean this stream has got done for

too long

but uh yeah

the sharing is so I did three emotes

this time but I mean one of them is

animated so that counts probably for

more than one

I will add it to the Discord server

[Music]

so

[Music]

I will add it here up

oh it says

[Music]

go

and there we go

thirdly only if you have a

[Music]

and this got Nitro

hey which one was this

[Music]

oh I didn't hear it on the list even

[Music]

so

yeah I think that's an option no no

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I was going to end it here so

[Music]

okay because I've been streaming for

almost eight hours and that's

[Music]

a lot for me

so but I'm very happy with everything

you're done let's turn here much

[Music]

and one animated image and so we should

definitely go and do our trade

but if we can use the

blushing one we can probably make a

funny message like freshmen's inside him

which is right

[Music]

we could we could yeah yeah I know I

know Izumi cat Fox he was here I don't

think

it was only a hydrate I think it was no

messages

and

yes that is true

[Music]

[Music]

hey we streamers we can be better at

adding

the pronouns because

it's kind of hard to tell if if I should

refer to someone he or she or if they

prefer they

if they are

[Music]

and animated until soon is actually

staying with others but I think it's

fine

foreign

I can't make it somewhere else that's

fine that's fine you will be in our

memories

we can write the funny message like

I don't know it can't just post that one

if you don't have it if you don't have

subscription you just pay you

hey what 107 points and you can unlock

it

okay and the nearest

[Music]
