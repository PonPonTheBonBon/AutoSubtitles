they removed the
Trophies the items you you win they've
removed them one by one

balance I guess that's what the sixth
wing
congratulations you win a trophy thank
you
again
more kicks
you can go faster through turns by power
sliding to access the power slide press
and hold the R1 button while turning
hard
sliding itself makes me go quicker Maybe

steady
[Music]
punch let's go
[Music]
oh shiny trophy they don't like to shine
in this game
um
they didn't have the effects at the time
they do simulate Sunshine missing some
means I guess this game has quite low
graphical quality
they live on nature of the game
I'm doing fruit let's finish it up
so I wanted it
let's stop picking up the boxes I want
to make
that's
yeah get out of the way crash I know you
just got me fireworks

he'll explain it now
congratulations you win a trophy not a
trophy
[Music]
get a turbo boost while power sliding
wait until the smoke from your exhaust
turns black then press the L1 button if
you wait too long you'll hear a backfire
sound and miss your chance for a boost
well you don't have to press
specifically and run an armor you don't
have to press R1 to activate the Boost
and element in it
[Music]
but you can also hold start using L1 to
do the power slide and press R1 to boost
and I do appreciate that you are allowed
to find it because I did this very sorry
[Music]
[Music]
let's go

it is around fine he just didn't get a
big shopping any clothes now so
congratulations you win a trophy
get around a tight turn yay you want to
face a direction quickly
brake Slide by pressing and holding the
square button while turning hard
that's that
[Music]
it doesn't let me
turn it that quickly
[Music]
I mean this one seems to turn quickly
yeah
yeah it doesn't need to turn it on
at all
okay
and then compared to
yeah
dude in this one
[Music]
well I guess it doesn't actually say
anything
it kind of turns harder at first I think
hmm
then I'm not sure if there's any track
yeah
this this track with a tight Cornerstone
the computers are boosting around this
it's not breaking
[Music]
all right now
you think that there's water thanks
[Music]
it is kind of hard to see the smoke
not a black one
3D
[Music]
okay this is
turned
oh my God
okay
driving me to the next corner
hey
[Music]
foreign
yeah I had some downloads issues today
actually upload seems fine
[Music]
trying aside from the day
let's finally tell me who's got trained
that only means that's the
obstacle system okay
no I just
it's avoids
[Music]
you can drive faster than this
which is nice
[Music]
I want for the road
passionate driving
but that was first thing and everything
I guess that doesn't count
no ghosting off the tracks
this isn't modified
destroying
too bad
I feel like I've seen or something no
of course
of course I had to I had to fall off the
track at the same day
oh
okay we'll need to drive like that
[Music]
probably
wow the first time I drove into
monasteries
[Music]
because there's the meter in the corner
leaves the shelter boosting
[Music]
if it was placed in the middle like
okay
voice film
[Music]
okay online
[Music]
which I guess it's not too hard to see
the smoke
[Music]
now it is nothing very safe way far
behind I like totally empty yeah
[Music]
you're not gonna cross me
did you find a bit confusing how
yeah so the upgraded TNT is Anita

press the clip button
s
is that second click
but then I've tried to keep out of
whatever it is
