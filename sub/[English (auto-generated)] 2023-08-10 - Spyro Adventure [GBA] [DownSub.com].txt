right now Adventure
had some
it's just getting stream started
that has now
been resoled
[Music]
so
very rescue
lets them
yes
I am
15 minutes
yeah and I didn't know what's what's
wrong with me
with the connection to Twitch today
but it seems to be working now so
let's start a new game and let's begin
with some
blindfolded
all right
forget it that's a thing apparently
okay let's do some voice acting
ah we're here at last
you can remove your blind phones now
I'm finally going to tell us what why we
had to wear blindfolds professor
well my secret lab would be a secret if
everyone knew where it was
anyway I brought you here because I have
a couple of great surprises for you
traveling in that
the first one is over there
go ahead and take a look
yeah plus oh
let's turn off the speech FX is just
annoying
oh yeah I can walk through things
baptized symmetric spiral
I think I recognize this creature
it looks like
I can see some kind of toy projector
you should like dripsters 3dp
this is Rich though that machine is my
most important secret invention and wait
a minute are you telling us that we were
actually looking at Rift himself
they're correct that people is actually
a tiny rape in the fabric of space
wow with this we could always keep a
close eye on that crafty rip though
why is rift are always around
I can see why you would want to keep
this a secret from him precisely now
then in my other surprise
is not quite ready to be presented
foreign
[Music]
in just a moment it's gonna stay
I won't start responding
that's
wrong
[Music]
um
sorry I bacteria where I was
foreign
[Music]
I see so
okay
would a Spyro would like to practice
spirals skill without fear of getting
hurt running training course nah
okay you know what let's actually date
he didn't even say anything
excellent Spyro you first ask Spyro
would be to destroy four baskets press
the B button to use your breathability
talk to me here when you have the start
all four baskets a good luck spiral I
hate him
let me see you okay
these are M oh this is a big one
a little big one wait that was
oh yeah there's the first one did it
really doesn't backyard salad but
well done spray you
they're missing a comma uh expired with
uh next time it would be to destroy four
vases the faces do not burn so press the
r but you need to charge them
talk to me here I want to Aspire to
destroys all four ways it's a good luck
spider in the seat now he did it
as
I'm going to continue speaking
production levels Inspire again
basketballs
safely
this one should not be chargeable
because it's big
but it was chargeable because this game
doesn't follow spy rooms
Spyro much now it's a charge or use the
Press ability to destroy the training
dummies
towards me here once you who's you
destroyed all four enemies good luck a
spy okay this is this professor is
weird
did you say four
yes do you really
impressive spot
I now try jumping to jump simply press
the A Button
jump over there and talk to me when you
get there
I'll give my best attempt thank you
simply amazing Spyro
now it tries
pirate liability to Glide Mr a button
twice wants to jump and again to the
Glide start glider for example to get
more distance
right over there and talk to me when you
get there
our Splendid job spiral Spyro is
incredible and now spiral should use a
spiral hover ability to hover press the
A Button while gliding
however at the very end of a Glide to
get one last bit of height and distance
Glide over Glide and hover over there
and they talk to me when you get there
okay if you say so professor
congratulations spy
Chinese concluded absolutely
I think the professor needs to turn down
with the painting suit
in this place just a bit yeah what's
with the what's with this aspiring
you can leave the spiral training area
by dropping down there
practice makes Spyro perfect so come
back and I can't steal a spiral
are we going back to this training area
or was that just
singing he wanted to say Professor
secret lab prototyping section
oh are you back how did you like my
playground it was really great
it was really great Professor
anyway I'm finished allow me to show you
my latest invention
but later at the automated assistant
wow it looks impressive
what does he do professor
's purpose would be to assist me in the
lab isn't if you want to follow her
oh
make him do something
all right then Butler why don't you
bring Spyro some American Cookies
cookies for spiral milk
cookies cookies to his cookies
to cookies
oh dear I think he's malfunctioning
Professor he's out of control turn him
off isn't done anything yet
it's judging him a bit quickly there
all right wait I forgot to install the
off switch I can't hear me off
he's just standing there and tapping his
feet
oh no it starts moving
when
[Music]
maybe that way oh it's explained and
that's why I need it but something has
happened to the people machine
okay and that thing all right
the hole is getting bigger
shorting out but they must have
uh overloaded the machine
yeah we need to do anything we can to
help Professor just tell us what to do
listen very carefully spiral ah Arch is
an artifact with a very special
properties with which very special
properties and something you listen
carefully but yeah I can't speak
carefully and a very special properties
that was the previous line is and if
every lead has one or is the heart of my
secret lab to created people now I'll
need a heart room already object lens to
close the giant hole
okay great we can do that how many
hearts and where do we find them there
are 12 left well hey that's
why was the previous two games like
he's not playing
real I mean depends if they mean 12
different levels in that case that's
not too many
but like 12 worlds maybe maybe they
meant maybe he speak 12 levels how many
levels burden in season of Fire
flame and eyes
hey
almost in this sentence there are 12
lands outside this lab
yeah that kind of how worlds work I mean
there are
there are
196 lands outside of my house
such a way way to finish it
and one unique heart in each one
all right how do we get out of here
yes I have an advice that will allow you
to work
to any land it's right over
are referring to this I'm in my work the
mines
doesn't he ever go on vacation I think
yeah it's like
so so
is he going to be the final boss of this
game too
so you have the second spiral
season of blame
for this game
and also the spiral and crash Fusion
no I forgot to enter the dragonfly
that's five games plus the remake of
course but that's a remake I did too
many
what do you know yeah I was just doing a
foolproof plan it's really weird
and suddenly an enormous hole leading to
the professor's secret lab appears out
of the air
spiders is terrible you must do
something quickly
I'm going to bring all my rhinos through
this hole and then warp them through all
the lions in standard domination the two
issue
any speak of the hole oh
ass it's the same English Dragon Shores
Dragon nests region
oh it says
no no we've been warped to the dragon
Shores
we better track down all the hearts and
find a way back to the secret lab
I am as you grab one of the professor's
notebooks I use it to keep track of what
progress you can look at it by holding
the L button and pressing start
okay
[Music]
dinosaurs
eight things
parts of the lens 12 things as he said
ability items 12 things Keys four things
bonus items five things game totals
nine thousand gems wild Hearts zero
percent 14 minutes only 40 minutes in
the game finally started
okay
we're just pressing
please okay pressing
so there's no map anymore
this is your online connections from
this one too
and then that exits back not to the menu
which option there's nothing we can
escape
okay there's no map anymore so obso we
basically back the season of ice
so they
didn't learn anything
[Music]
no back decision oh can I go back here
[Music]
virtual playground virtual training area
so this is just
came
with spider for some reason
dinosaurs Dragon Nest region
when it is all the neurons
so it's like
oh that wasn't that was a test
that she went up
I saw you
oh
and these these animations it does have
seasonal Flame
how it kind of shows in advance
oh here's Terry
my rhinox suddenly appeared and
stoleness toys
all we have left to keep them amuses the
heart of the Dragon insurance
though isn't that more important like
Mission dragonfly ripped is nothing
compared to a large group of board kids
okay I guess I guess world domination is
not as
the annoying ass and some more kids are
packing
well if we find the toys and bring them
back can you give us the heart
of course here's a list of the Dead toys
return them and I'll give you their
heart
[Music]
option
on a map shaped as a puppy we just got a
quest we use the quest section of the
channel to check on your programs
I'll get somebody that
oh I see
oh here are the toys
make a sound like I think we got a
spider I can figure a rip the action
figure
a Bianca action figure oh I want that
something I can pick it with cool
glasses or should I say shade be like
speaker
[Music]
Beach boxing gloves
action figure and an 89 action figure
covering all the important characters
and then the heart in return okay let's
let's go find some
action figures or a fairy
the fairy Shrine is just up the Escape
but rhinox smash the ladder
but that's a shame all right teleport
you up there but Richard check that
spell a lot of the library what
I understand wait
oh
hello
[Music]
three different than the action figure
yeah but let's put it
I don't know what it calculates the same
oh spider right next up here I have to
stay there and all my toddlers fled I've
looked all over the place but I can't
find them can you keep an eye out for
them
sure if we find any of them we'll send
them him
oh thanks I'm weren't thinking about
them yet you just standing here and
worrying instead of going out and trying
to look from yourself I also of all the
toddlers are are gone
why
like again what's more important that
ripped is taking over the world or that
some kids are bored
or are the toddlers not the kids I don't
necessarily I didn't speak English
this game is weird
what was that one of the toddlers did I
just kill one of them
like a sheep
the ship runs on it's two legs
and the GPS sticks oh the there's no
there's no extra lives in this game I do
like that
the extra knives you just this stupid
thing games they thought let's get Rowdy
I guess yep
wait is since when since when were fives
pink are they just making stuff up in
this game
oh
I mean you found me I knew you could
never hurt I could never hide from me
spider roll
do you know where the other keys are
they ran off probably taller lens what
to this
okay
I go home now can't spinal you can have
this box of fun bye now
[Music]
in some point with a lid on it yeah
that's
usually I'm watching sports
let's talk about fun
oh it becomes in handy
okay
let me check the channel I guess
[Music]
and look at this they have scaled up by
like 50 50 so every other pixel is twice
as big
they can't have like two pictures one
large and one small and uh whatever it
really just going through this game
[Music]
this is a box with a lid on it talk
about fun pet little dragon toddler
again it's just uh to us when you find
her hiding in the dragon Shores let's
keep it for now
you think this is one of those games
that started as continual yeah I do feel
like that that's a good point
it really doesn't come off as a Spider
Man
this main Inspire I mean that yeah it is
something that has happened before so
that is a possibility
it's cheaper it is respond that really
come to the fairy Library there was a
small information in the dragon Shores
that wasn't emphasized I just never seen
it anyway
s keep killing [ __ ] there is no point of
money Banks
let's check out the library then
game
fire Library oh yeah
yeah really yeah
let me know
oh I see anyway
it's so chili even the flutter box have
to keep flapping to see one
I bet if you warmed up that flutter
bodies will help you get out of the
library yeah yeah
let me check that as well
okay so wait very library has eight
things to get
[Music]
I'm sure okay okay
[Music]
let's
and this is not how it's supposed to
work
can you do me a big big favor
the pilot light in the horse has got out
any light the pilot light
for us so we can get some worms in here
us all up spider let me give you
something that is a short healthy art on
your journey with this very scroll you
will have the power to breathe an icy
breath
it's a special the writing glitter
into the writing glitter is in light
this gives the ice breathability press
select to switch to it and the B button
to use it
okay so it's
I already have the electricity
electric I don't know it looks like it's
a green
oh I was supposed to drop off the head
the very very quick these five sorry
weird
destroying those this orange potatoes
is quick
Prairie Library main horn
so many face it's almost like I'm in the
face
trying to help
burning embers just suddenly shot out of
the air it's quite a loud thing down
here so it's hard to speak
or the heating man the books are in
danger
you must have blown too hard when you
lit down your hearts to spiral but you
would blame spiral
eat spiders please do something you've
got to put these fires out you're
speaking to a highly breathing dragon
I mean okay sure he can use Ice Prince
but but I mean
I mean he is a Firebird
anyway
I'm not going to comment on why they
have water inside the Library that's
apparently something
fairy libraries have and I'm commenting
on it
and anyway let's put out these funnies
what spider is playing for it
hey Spyro
there's a little red guy with a horn on
his head in the library's eggs were in
that section
he's asked not to be disturbed though I
did hear him remember your name
okay let's see
can you make less noise
he sure likes this sink of Spyro
cannot charge it yes
and the
uh another one of these
let's charge this but not flame they're
in a teaspoon that's fine
why do they have sheep inside the
Library
this life is so weird
everything is weird
something exactly
foreign
gems
oh it's sorry I didn't remember so we're
being green but I guess they can change
color I mean
Inspire stealing
well
[Music]
I am taking the temperature right in
front of the eyes of the face and
they're not saying anything
I got some bad news so we raped us back
he's got the professor and um
anything and I would have dragging
around Sesame speed
oh my that would explain all the these
noisy Riders
I don't remember so being so stupid
like sorry I need to restart my
[Music]
conversation
apparent and this game doesn't work like
that
okay I can apparently not restart the
conversation
whatever
I'm not speeding here I'm standing in
the corner
and I know that's the
is it what is the seasonalize
oh
really no I'm not no no I'm going
getting I'm get
I didn't mean go in here
yes
whatever crypto
I don't care about you
I'm going to leave
I didn't die
foreign
I want to see
guess I got that
never see my opinion
not yet sorry we're still working on it
oh dear our River
I want to go over there that's where I
want to go
let's see I heard from
apparently
I need uh
the
there's another button here or do I need
to press pause
is that the same
yes
no I can't enter
the vault
and hopefully no one closes it after
Spider goes in
money bags Vault oh he's wrong
again
what is this paper money
security cameras
yeah I don't think
I think this this is another case
because I've seen a game which counted
in which current which currency was gold
and every time it refers to the currency
it refers to instance gold except for us
in one mode which was the same currency
but then it referred to it with the
dollar sign
it's just one of the Wind
things
I guess I guess
I guess that's something yeah
the dollar sign is not a universal
symbol for money yes so these stories
are ripped or action figure each smaller
and ugly just like the real thing
can I
know
[Music]
where's the uh
[Music]
other oh
seconds
it's one of the points to end the dragon
Elder is looking for
okay let me change that
so
oh I see I see
I got two things here
now I got this
one of the toys has been found
Fair Library main horn
so
yeah so these are only the Sheep
let's switch to fire
oh
I didn't I didn't expect that to happen
so this is a funky and now can you give
me a lift
where are we going here okay
what time is it if I choose
this isn't Alexis it is wind
[Music]
I wanna I want to see the sheeps in
reignited the piano or anything like
that
I want this no no no you're bouncing
around it it's gonna Bend up and then
run on the immediately
I think spy should be rewarded with all
these gems for
for putting amplifiers on the books that
he has been blamed
for causing
so you could argue away peace they want
to blame then maybe he shouldn't be
rewarded but
it's not his fault
he just
also they said that the place was heated
up why why did I need to heat this up it
should be he can knock her on her
already
so happen if I cool them down
the morons aren't the same in the track
yeah
what are morals
but this one needs me here okay
our pink chest I like that
so one more book
let me turn
25
you look like that
[Music]
when
foreign
xyzen section
all I had to do
okay sure
we can't read any of the spells in this
book buddy girls with magic this book
gives you Quick Escape ability spiral
you can select it from the menu to
return to the dragon shirts from anyway
as Adventures it's the only World in
this game
I assume from that message
another bit of a downgrade from the
previous games
it
does seems to have a lot of stuff in it
and it suddenly variants but I hope you
shouldn't give it that
wow that was that was high amp more just
just everywhere I need to find a lot oh
wait a minute
I have five four keys I need to find and
then I need to go around and unlock
chests everywhere
oh this is going to be fun actually like
[Music]
when you hi mate hello don't worry I
haven't missed much
thank you
I mean I would have been playing for 38
minutes but
I did this game is so weird
yes
glitching that graphic
well
there are large candles here but the
pain they're called Enlightenment for
you
seems like the most obvious thing
okay so so red are one green or two
yellow are ten as usual the dude is
still still this is not flame 25 is
turquoise or like
something like that
but uh
in this game five is pinch
what's the same thing for me to do up
here
it's not
when
maybe those chests contain stuff I need
I'm still using a burning book
Maybe
the wigs are flammable apparently yeah
oh
yeah there we go
I said I wasn't gonna comment on it but
only do they have water in the very
Library they also have Islands
can you be a bit quiet
and there is the last book wait
nevertheless stuff defines panel let's
go tell bubbles
I could look at the destination of these
sheep
wait where are we going
someone's been here
I think I'm going back
[Music]
oh apparently today is National book
celebrity
okay yeah yeah it's for for which
station
yeah the national
there's a lot of Nations out there but
I've been kind of like a kitten is a
kitten where was Bob no I promise was in
here
humidity
I'm sure you'll be the nasty monsters
gun thing inspired yeah this wasn't the
place I was going to get here
I think kidneys the fires are out oh
while we were trying to rescue books I
noticed this one book doesn't belong to
the library why don't you take it to
return for your help spiral it looks
quite old
yeah we find like
we found this garbage here like we don't
need it
we can we're going to get rid of it but
I mean you can't take it it's a reward
[Music]
it's old and smells funny just like
kangaroos let's keep it for now
my books are safe though that's good
as far as the fan game these two years
have to be put out the fires you started
in the front let's see okay friends of
Sparks finally did not cross the fires
if spider had crossed the fires it would
much more stuff would be burning and
second you did not put off the fires
this is the
and this could come in handy when
zero the art
[Music]
I could come in handy to use spark
anyway
I'm like action figures there's a
kangaroo actually
and I will Define them on find the Moon
am I done in Fair Library
those
chests I need the keys for
yeah he's told me that before
no I haven't I was specifying my machine
the parts maybe those are any I can skip
those that are because I wanted to get
started a little bit
this game does not allow you to start
over the conversation you get one chance
and that's only
this is such a weird game and there's no
point of killing
and these because
because there isn't any extra lives
no
what do you want a good Heavens my dear
a dear friend Spyro I was just out for a
strong when I happened to walk across
this ghastly little plaything
and right how much do you want for it a
Spyro I'm surprised at you however Mary
mentioned those have its maintenance
costs well I want to say I part with
this a trinket for our Audrey 300 gyms
how does that sound
nah oh that's too bad you just
especially can truly appreciate this one
of a kind item you haven't even shown
anybody looks like
they're one of the toddlers I'm supposed
to say no I never supposed to save the
dragons
what does the sign say
well one of the signs says banana that
way more of those other signs say
ing that thing
he doesn't even repeat the dialogue
oh lovely lovely James I knew I could
count on you spiral here's the item as
promised
around spiral oh
screenshot
you have your own action figure this is
a really cool fully possible toy but
eyes are
all over the place
and also the pixels aren't even correct
like on like every pixel is supposed to
be like
when every pick is two by two pixels in
the
in well on the Game Boy which is shown
as 4x4 pixels on Me on the stream but
that's besides point but but one of the
eyes has one straight pixel
and like
it's gonna
kind of someone off
and I don't know how to manage to do
that
if Moneybags the wobbling back and forth
like he's holding it in and I'm about to
burst
yeah
burst with money
it's one of the toys the dragon is
looking for
okay first step is Sparks if you're
surprised that Spyro has his own action
figure you couldn't have known about the
Detroit beforehand and that that was one
of the twins that's what I'm trying to
think
[Music]
Mr
Grimes thank you for following
I guess you're now also part of the poor
Pals Community welcome

yeah this is this is too much for me
then
this way to the triangle Coast let's try
to
wait I I forgot to read I was just I
ever seen
let's go back
Gourmet passage okay
all these race because yeah I'm I'm
broken at the moment
s yeah
I
foreign
doesn't even sound like lightning
I don't know I don't think
it's not even anything here it's just an
empty place
apparently
oh okay
so um
yeah I wasn't done
we're just talking about the previous
previous gameplay
[Music]
yes it's really I know it's in Swedish
yeah um
but um
and
I'll tell you I'm trying to get
everything in order and everything
while I'm
watching
[Music]
I'm trying to put their things in my
head
you know Swedish polish
yeah I am I am a Swedish bunny I can
speak Swedish
all right all right
I I like languages if there's anything
about language
okay wow
which one wants to have hydrogen
wow
so um
yeah yeah right so I hope it's dreaming
and everything went well for you missy
and of course I hope it went well for a
great and
Mystic learnings as well
and also as a as a Swedish picture
making the
sound is
takes a lot of effort for me so I guess
it should be Grimes but it's just easy
for me to say Grimes
it's very nice time
I'm getting lost
yeah it was fun
dead by daylight which
the part of the game that creeps me out
is the the hook
both eat it is it oh you want me to say
green greens oh
there's no e in it you're right
you are right about that
okay
Mr greens
it depends very well it was a lot of fun
so how many levels do you manage to
complete
because when I was watching last time
which was
a few days ago
it were you were worth doing that you're
running gun level I think and they did
it
many many times
Ryan rhinox have taken the bridge out to
the dragonfly Oasis oh is it oh
is it hey
random gift shops to the community
Rolex
he was here once
I haven't seen him since
I hope it comes back when they want to
see
and probably will she usually stops by
here
maybe maybe when the Royals gets
notification maybe he wants to come by
again
me and Papa was officially stopped by
himself he he will be happy thank you
forever for donating the gifts
we made it to the green dragon of in the
clouds
well I have no idea of the game but
I think I've seen pictures of the green
dragon
say I don't know how far that is
or how many levels that is where
so who's carrying who
he's he said to give one
oh c-r-i-m is your initial
I see me
and where does the Zed come in
laughs
[Music]
visit the yeti
or is it your thigh Yeti
that and Getty
but I guess it's not selling goodbye and
Sergeant's birds parrots
and let me just check this area first
and then we get on a very very
I guess
this way to rabbit have you know what
change of plans I think I want to go to
the rabbit habitat
foreign
I see
can I see what oh I'll do something here
it's a beautiful flower smells great too
I like the king cheese
I hope it goes in handy
that wasn't even a spark noise
yeah the voices are different
inconsistent
tonight
whoa
I'm not sure what that's my
no no
it's probably cannot swim no that's all
that's me
can I
this seems to be the same height this
now I should have learned more like that
okay now um that's not possible
when they explode and eyes fluffy
kind of brutalness well this is a quick
test so
okay let's go here then
yeah apparently this game is quite
linear
so far I've only been able to visit one
place at a time
unlike other games there are no portals
or anything this is more like
yeah
Yeah a different idea for inspiration
work
like a lot of breaches I mean seeing and
stuff like that
but now I have some
oh yeah 30 barebacks let's get this
early
my own voice is now consistent inside
there I mean that's true I mean I do
feel like I'm not doing my voice
consistent when I speak it makes one
interesting
this is pizza
because
in case uh look at all those fun funds
[Music]
because
as some of you might not know already I
am a trans woman it's not a secret
so this was not the voice I used don't
worry
so it's something I practice but I feel
like I'm doing it very consistent
and I love
that's not what bird looks like because
that's private plan
no that's not sad I was expecting to
meet Sergeant bird the first thing but I
guess not
don't explain why it doesn't look like
Sergeant bird because he's not such a
Sprint
help my squad leaders on the other side
of this water
I don't
I don't like one of the Jordan is like
that in text I don't know
it just makes it hard for me three
because I'm not a native English speaker
I'm not interested okay
I didn't expect it makes this change
aren't Penguins good swimmers
we sure are but not when there's our
Waters is about
oh like that one I've been trying to
figure out the same way to ride that
Waters across the water
you could try breathing it with your
eyes but it's my same responsibility
hey that might work if you finish that
one on Thursday and then we could write
it across the way how are you supposed
how are you supposed to ride it if it's
frozen
solid
you can probably move that from the
wires around by using your window oh
please watch out for iceberg
they're dangerous
okay so I'm just
what else I used to do this I see all
right yeah because it's icy
and let's see uh
did he die
when did Warriors go I guess there was a
dead
started just showing Grims the Emoji
designer by yourself oh that's that's
that's fine
don't be sorry about that
and then there's
yeah they they
yeah there's the
Fair
the third one the princess one
[Music]
and the animated one
as well
another part I think
the qualifications for being here
your voice sounds good anymore more
confident than a few months ago when you
can see yeah yeah definitely feel more
confident now okay
and apologize
about to be that one it's broken
millions of shots of Earth's Lawrence
wow that icy breath of your shirt is
heavy
love to win the rest
you need to free that shallow patch to
get to the main barracks that is super
breast mint it should make your icy
breath powerful enough to get its job
done do I get to keep it maybe I can't
keep it
this breath I mean defines code and
refreshing
no Again Sports voice type this gives
you super easy breathability spiral you
select to switch to it on the B button
to charge it up and release it for an
icy blast blast
okay
so oh it's just upgrades this you know
what wait oh yay
what
oh I see eyes no I see I see
all right
oh that's my time write it
thanks everybody
yes
so the I really just can't upgrade
that's pretty neat
oh
why is barbed wires
what is this
nothing you can charge
uh I hate to rain around the but it's
bedtime yeah
can you get that cake
it must be late for you at the moment
fair enough people want to go to bed
[Music]
I mean one thing they say
I was going to use this for
hey don't forget to raise that shut up
to get oh this one yeah see
[Music]
no yes like in season of plane
with this guy at this time it seems to
be a permanent upgrade
oh yeah
love love love
is it really safe to leave or just
hanging around like that
also this is the icon for wind
this is this is possible electric breath
maybe it becomes electrified
you speak that was you laughing at that
was pretty rude up here
doing that
finally
got that fish
and every dead fish is lying across the
edge like okay
oh yeah these things all soaking gems
and you keep the when you keep
remembering that that those aren't uh
hey quarter that these aren't
decorations
I guess it makes sense for sergeant bear
to have lots of
these cheap really respond quickly
and the fives in this game well I didn't
think for you sheep well I guess it's
for the ice
I suggest here staying as fire
have you done Spyro
yes I'm done here then
kind of
answer over so we are continuing this
the barracks
it's my flame View
rude to not die when I flame you
well I guess that's
oh I see there's another walrus
but
have them be but that's not how it's
been a beach
can we tell how do you do your voice
like this where is your uniform Soldier
let's see um we're not Soldier I'm a
dragon
because dragons cannot be soldiers and
Spark here is a dragonfly
I'm a very busy penguin so I'm uh
somewhere up with it what's your
business
we're looking for parts of the land
we got one stone here but you can't have
it
Burns missing and rhinos have stolen his
Brides metal collection
without those Metals our heart is the
only thing keeping us up Spirit around
here
okay then we'll just find Sergeant
parents balance for you how's that
you do that Soldier and I might just
give you a medal myself
yes the heart will be fine thanks no
that's fine
foreign
foreign
day
some enemies leave their eyes behind
after she killed them and it was
possible you then step on their eyes and
squeeze the jelly out of them by a
satisfying squash something that doesn't
sound satisfying
that sounds disgusting
it's disgusting okay excuse me
tungsten
why specifically have walrus
are you freezing I can help you with
that
yes
oh and then it goes back in the air
and now that she definitely freezing
[Music]
oh
but so she stopped surviving first
thing
I got two parts now
hence can I wear them no
oh no another one
attention Sonia I've got a mission for
you and we are not soldiers
we're not even penguins
[Music]
your mission is to locate my man five of
them were standing at the Outpost isn't
that isn't that where there is supposed
to be either way
your mission does not involve
questioning orders Soldier
thank you
when it wasn't
I guess it was
I'm just making sure that I understood
my mission correctly okay
sounds sounds like
sounds like there's an issue with the uh
the waters
wow you froze all that water saying now
I can get back to you can't wait
but it was confirmed that Penguins could
swim in water and there is no walrus
here so why didn't you just swim both
fish
hello
stupid penguin
[Music]
well
you weren't supposed to do that
[Applause]
I shouldn't be able to just do this okay
no need to
Blow Away
okay what I'm curious about
this is a long path
wow
and what happens if I
help me I'm stranded I need triple back
to the base uh also you need me to
freezing
and then I can speak to you right
[Music]
well we first saw the water saying now I
can go back to the 10. but
the water just on froze
no it was in the flashing animation
what is this
and lovely flower it's pure white and
has a long stem it's it's yellow it's
like beige
[Music]
let's keep it for now
question they're lazy
yeah
I can't print anything they run
another National stroller because this
this one
let's do it anymore here
wow he throws another one
basically how they all speak the same
thing
wait I was supposed to get up here
oh
was it designed
because because you are not allowed to
do that in spiral to the original
Trinity you can also do that in season
of playing
and
I don't think any place in that game
requires you to do it
wait where's this person Frozen oh wait
this is a flame again when it first one
one of these all of these prints
because it's basically
what is the uh
granny you need to finish this
oh yeah
get back
and streaming now you knock your penguin
why does fire say anything but you can't
swim and then they say like oh yeah
that's right
the only only sanity for spider they get
the current is not that's what the pain
was to get across but I guess I haven't
been here yet because I haven't been on
one that's that's tight
spark is easily entertainment in this
game
and he also blames spider so
maybe I should have
spoken to
where's where's this place here
why is there for Prince here
what is the fight for Prince it is a
five-legged animal who stood there
I don't know how else to explain
thanks for helping me get back to the
game
thanks for helping me get back to the
camp
hello again Lieutenant hey I see your
man made it back all right
you should have recovered all my men did
we get the Primes
no prices however since you're out of
uniform I'll give you this spare
that uniform is way too small for me
and it's way way too big for me
um well check it anyway and there's an
order Soldier
needs military looks great everyone
looks better in a uniform than you think
I mean a uniform is just a form that is
unique
a uniform it's an outfit that ensures
that everyone has a uniform outfit say
that everyone looks the same
collect everyone of the same rank Plus
or whatever
so it could look
like anything
[Music]
so um
I wonder if we'll need this I don't know
you're questioning him thanks
I got 3.5 18 here
how do I get back
I'll stand there and didn't move it on
so where'd it go
this hand uniforms out just like piano
enlistment process and inspires would
enjoy that it's not even the uniform
they're wearing so
it's bad
[Music]
so
wait this isn't about me back
how do I get back
I'm stuck here
oh
wait what was it
why was it Frozen
all right this is how I get back okay
I had to keep permitting
because wasn't there something more for
me to do over here
or maybe there wasn't no I think I was
done here
no idea it's more here
[Music]
I mean where am I and why is there no
map in this game
the previous game had a map wait why did
why did they take a step back
and remove the map
wait oh yeah it was up here
yeah and that was a win
yeah they're only wearing hats
those sheep look old they're probably
appreciate the work by here
but if they appreciate
oh that's exploded I'm also you're
supposed to change the outsheets
A fitting outfit for the climate I think
so back in the game
the map made game two weeks did it
nah
I I don't think so
I don't know
Lift Me Up
I give myself a part of those Metals
soldiers I haven't had to sell yet no we
still haven't found them yet
just let me get up here
[Music]
nothing has changed I'm not even left
the area
this assistant
here
trying to use this
here we go
puppy
you're a walrus
yeah frozen water is almost looking nice
uh yeah
okay so this is where I progressed the
game
[Music]
I mean it's not as terrible as season of
eyes only give it that
really isn't like a spinal game
well it
you
and once again he cancels it
so now
let's practice back
you can now see about there
is not come wait maybe it's a timer that
makes them respond
here
where is the other red button
and I went maybe I should go and see
what's done there
went explode event
Rescue Mission

I read you are lazy you are the laziest
Penguins ever you should be fired
I I guess yeah sure they might not be
able to fly if I know
fair enough they can't fly
but certainly they can walk
I don't know
[Music]
definitely they can walk like
[Music]
nothing I didn't mean to do that
okay these things are back

time

[Music]
there we have you
grab on
I never have you grab on
[Music]
come on
and you can do it
[Music]
oh they just happened to walk into it
again I guess they can't watch
yes Johnny bird can be close to them in
that case they are
ready to be picked up by something
at least the ones he rescued said yeah
[Music]
they're now enough
bring it from the dice okay
okay
and this level reminds me of
um worms
the video game
[Music]
they must have had worm system
inspiration to make this King
don't get a good shot
nothing of any loss
oh it requires more than one
okay
oh
[Music]

Bentley turn yellow
hi Sparrow are you on another adventure
I have to go with you but
digging things up kiss me very busy

Bentley originally he was very offensive
with his words now he can't see
archaeology or something whatever it is
do you know anything about Hearts
Bentley yeah do you know anything about
hearts
do you have one Bentley
we need to find as many as we can and
you might just have one
you're not using one to dig without help
if you have heart
we're not using the heart of the yet
they said and get the to God give it to
you but it hurts so in the moment
I'd get it but rhinos took my climbing
here okay so if we find your gear you
can get the heart for us
yep usually it's not my stuff so you
know
it when you find it good luck spider
uh this is just fresh Quest start to
fetch Quest

the journal to check on your progress
but requesting game
there's one button there
but where is the other button
I want to freeze the sheep and then
stand on the Sheep
oh
[Music]
maybe it's inspired
um
long time ago I tried listening in the
USMC
collection
the night before going to me yes another
decision I think oh military enlistment
processing service I had to stay the
night in a hotel in a tomb Town San
Antonio couldn't sleep due to all the
noise outside

but there's the other one
let's see that was pretty easy
oh sorry about that sheep
okay okay last time it was okay sizes

snow was nice anything
but that stay at
Maps most boring day of my life 10 hours
she's going for one room today

oh
and this is a small Sheila actually
she's wearing boxing gloves for some
reason
it's one of the tallest Dragon animals
looking for
boy

we found his money back involved in the
yeti serenity

but why when we started kangaroos of
course you don't have clothes but but
she has never bought some day in her
life
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]

definitely if there's a company that we
need to make like a large hours say one
meter up to like one and a half meter

[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I'm back
to some more
play a game gameplay
normally Sheila crushes enemies
unleashesive but well not normally
I am usually she stumps them or kicks
them
however it is true that in specifically
a season of flame
her stomp attack is a butt around stump
it's a vision
but which isn't a bad way to go actually
what do you mean
bye yeah yeah
I'd buy it when I was I'm assuming even
a prototype in that case but when I I
still buy a pumpkin
yeah
it would be amazing to have such blush
I would love it
oops
and I used to know someone who made
plushies I have a few of them said
earlier I think that's the same it's
now let's
but yeah like someone making a yeah
there are a few people who like to make
custom plushies but I don't I don't feel
like
to really get like the price down
because
[Music]
custom plushies made by people can
sometimes be quite expensive
and this way to Rabbit habitat uh so it
would be buried if it was like a company
Mass producing but still made in
somewhat high quality so they might
still be more expensive than like
most common plushies
but
but it's a Pom-Pom Dash that you can
switch the outfit on
I'll do the hydrate which I
can change something
[Music]
and
it was just important Isabel plushie
from Animal Crossing so soft and curly
there are so many so many words
yeah I didn't eat a burger today chicken
burger
there we go this doesn't look like a
rabbit habitat it's just a big mushrooms
and it's not Sheila but I did commission
a mama and baby kangaroo pen

kangaroo

out there the heart of the rapid capital
is in the magically sealed container
[Music]
oh yeah
another one came by
the last was what was going on yeah
[Music]
thank you
for giving away another gift sure
you're so you're so kind
[Music]
two for too many gifts
and that name translates is something
you're around places in English
[Music]
too many gifts
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
here are your second facing gift then
it's second place in bits as well that's
not bad
if you take a whole street it's
[Music]
more pizza at the moment
105 to basically
but I mean already because
[Music]
yeah it's just donates for the next and
please
this is what I was trying to take uses
do you see
but I do only 3995 more to unlock for
instance why is it it's pretty just a
five or five thousand
yeah it's it's only five thousand yeah
I need several rare plans to make this
battle that will unseen oh I got some
plants
plants
[Music]
we'll get the plans for you Bianca just
give us a list of what you need
thank you
there are seven plants on that list some
of them may be difficult to find
well let me tell me where they are
return to me with all the plans and I'll
open the heart container for you
we just got a question the questions
I see you got the lovely pink chest here
a little bit of this
would you
[Music]
Chase
so
yeah let's
have that
this is the quest
do I find the Bianca action figure here
[Music]
oh that's the book becomes storage units
I see
there was so many things to pick up
oh he's barely equipment stuff
and the medals oh yeah I only got some
of these
eight grapes
oh is that what I get from
ba
oh yeah
that's some of the stuff and that was
all the active question there so I
haven't got a single heart yet
the whole goal of the games is Canada's
hearts and I've not got a single one yet
did I go in here
wait this yes
this is where I came from
all right
[Music]
let me
wait
let me hear just
this
case first first
so anyway I'm back here now
I think I'll need to make Bianca my
personal assistant from now on
maybe you should switch the car twinks
Patrick's was the drama worst attention
Bianca can't work on their own tricks I
don't think Bianca should be an
assistant
just because she's a lady
[Music]
she does have a nice pink dress
[Music]
but honestly Bianca's made better tricks
than her own hair
[Music]
go ahead cool I wasn't drinking
[Music]
and I will eat a burger after the Stream
[Music]
I can kill this neat
so the tornado is like a charge
speaking of yellow
that's that's one strong yellow
thing
so that's that area cleared
I was drinking on a Tuesday and missed
the stream yeah
whips
I guess it's that shape is in peace
I get I I guess I guess you could say
that that ship took the piece
oh
[Music]
but I so much that I passed out for
about seven hours face down in the
bathroom
and then you were like oh I actually
gonna watch the stream now
where where's the Stream
and this is another place I have to do
to download something
there's one button where's the other
button
[Music]
yeah voice
turn button
as important the whole thing you reset
let me go find the other button first
yeah there it is
oh the the thing stops it from moving
so if I do that and
do that do this thing down
[Music]
oh it goes all the way up there I didn't
know that so hard to press the buttons
[Music]
jump up
press the button
and I tried opening twitch when I got
the notification for the stream but my
perception of time was not really today
because the stream was not hardly ever
yeah I guess you when you woke up you
saw the notification because I guess
that's that's another another issue it's
with twitch if the stream has ended the
notification still stays up I guess some
people like that but but something
something like the end of the day when I
checked the phone because I better check
my phone I have like
20 notification on Twitch from streams
that have started or something
oh this one looks pretty
uh it doesn't
scope it was the sparkle that made it
look pretty
neat is a stethoscope known any doctor's
Spyro
this could come in handy
and he does know the professor and I
would assume the professor is a doctor
no I had an application and at least to
my perception I open it immediately
okay
[Music]
okay
you heard it passed out for three hours
woke up still
[Music]
not getting impression in mind
let's see
if I got it correct me
but no
more
[Music]
there we go
because there is sometimes I haven't
heard that
quit
you can't move it across this
that means
that this one is used to get up there
which this one also is used for
and this one can be used here and of
course because these are connected you
can take that one all over there too
and so what's the point of this one
[Music]
yeah I'm here
oh there's another gym
thank you
hey but it only felt like I was asked
for 10 minutes when I read about seven
hours oh
no
[Music]
[Music]
yeah I think I'm done here
so where am I supposed to go now
I got the wing when I got this thing I
can oink well I found Bianca that was
nice
internet makes the ship extern
yes oh yeah it worked today
yeah
something everything is
oh yeah I know I should be able to do
more things
[Music]
not that one
and I guess this one isn't really
shooting so I guess
nope
what's that
doesn't doesn't reach
and I've also badly found any of the oh
dragon children
wait this is this area
let's see if you're missing anything
adaptive
now I have to no I don't know I got to
name him and that's not the name there
we go
anyway
it doesn't seem to I mean I kept playing
out the best thoughts
as a spider dies again
dying is just some minor inconvenience
okay now I'm back here
[Music]
like everything likes to explode unless
they fall into water that's them from
exploding
I wanted to do that there we go now I
got it explode
and then that was pretty easy to get
sticks done anyway
yeah so here is where I should progress
dude the banana planes
banana Savannah jungle Zedge
[Music]
hey you gotta help me
wait wait I forgot to help that other
guy
I'm stuck here and I'm gonna get back to
work can you help me get back
and would you get stuck here in the
first place
I fell into that banana trap
I shot me in there
[Music]
spread me out here now this plant is
closed and I can't get back
each trap has three plants
tree plant three plants Heat their roots
that connects them to open and close its
plants
[Music]
magnets now
they look so happy
hey way to go and speaking of going I'm
gonna be late
[Music]
thanks pal
I can stick around to chat
even though you're sticking around and
chatting at the moment but I'll leave a
little delicacy here for you
[Music]
okay
I guess I'll have to pick it up then
excuse me this is not where I wanted to
go
it is a stream
[Music]
this is not how it's supposed to work
[Music]
what
more than what is with you
[Music]
I want that scene
[Music]
close knit
oh wait oh wait no I see maybe I do this
but now it works okay
this pepper is hot you can handle it
though right spider he
this gives you super flameability you
select the switch to it hold the B
button charge it up then release it to
fire away
yeah and it's a projectile
yeah that's what I'm going to use on
that
sing
[Music]
anyway
I I I I have that thing
oh a chili pepper oh there was a Target
back in that order yeah
and also I didn't do that
balance the bunny challenge
so I have a few things to do
yeah yeah
I know it I don't know anything
I need to do this thing again
what did I did it
I mean so much takes why is internet
like a quick use button
blaming fairies
June 13.
oh wait wait wait
oh no it's Butler
I don't want cookies spider I want
cookies and milk
that spider doesn't want cookies and
milk he says putting coats as if that
implies something
you crazy metal maintenance
Butler has cookies and milk for a spiral
oh let's short second it up again the
explosion is breathtaking
foreign
cookies right
here
oh
you have a very short
there we go
oh wait wait I need to do more
no come here come here
and of course also the uh
balance blocking the
there you go
and now that stone just explodes
nice work spider
let's hope that's the last last time we
have to deal with team
probably not
probably not
gonna know there's an opening there but
five things I have to do
[Music]
so much going on at the moment
[Music]
so much to do so much to see
I certainly feel like I really like it
wait wait what I'm run off the options I
run out of stuff to do and now now I
have like the banana Savannah I have the
target scene I have that cave that's a
butler just opened up
well it's three things but let's see
and I still haven't done this thing you
know here which I forgot well but at
least I missed the first 20 minutes yep
the battle showed up in the first and we
did Butler is a mechanical scene created
by the professor
to
to assist around the lab
or something like that
hey man ain't gonna mean anything that
name isn't spoken I don't remember if
that was your voice voice rhinoc
infestation
three two one
that was a night I think go
not even a kill message
50 of them but there's no timing so what
was the Titan counter for me
I'm making up my own music
halfway there
it's at least no Jam jump
for some reason I just realized there
are panels on the floor dictating where
these will show up
[Music]
it's very obvious
this last one
I was just curious
[Music]
and apparently I attacked it
this one is awarded the Penguins for
outstanding heroism is one of such Birds
missing medals which Mo had for some
reason
this is your Mo have to say about that
well I want to see if I can get
something okay

those kids are gonna greet me with the
heroes welcome
yeah except we cleared out this room for
you
honest money join the union then come
and talk to me
tea cookies
[Music]
oh excuse me
that was a bit of ruling
except that in it doesn't work in that
context
wasn't it
because I can't think that that was
really easily
yeah
so who replied but if the professor has
been kidnapped
well I guess the Butler repair itself
yeah I knew that's the fairy fairy and I
don't want to take the fairy fairy to
the very land

effort this is the middle of awarded to

come back to playing
look at this same
oh so the I see
[Music]
the pink ones
it's just purple
I as I don't get a pink and so I don't
get a pink spider
that is
highly disappointing
why have one of what why is make the gem
pink if you're going to make spider
purple
hello sir
this is the same character we're looking
for some heart
what you say well we've got one here but
wait don't tell me rhinos are somehow
prevented you from letting us burn weed
bye that's really cute yes we keep the
hearts in a special safe one that only
I'm able to open but rhinox have made
off with my tools which of them are kind
of openly safe
all right then if you give us a list of
your tools we could try to find them for
you
oh sadly I'd be more than happy to lend
you their heart to get my tools back
to get the results back
then your heart if we get your tools
back
please don't use good luck and hurry
back
we just got a quest
good yeah okay so yeah
oh excuse me I look rude
I'm supposed to get up there
right here
we have to find Tunes off to find the
biggest carrots to open the same
yeah no wait I don't know
[Music]
I'll explore the area
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
it's quite an interesting area you can
explore that is completely empty and has
nothing in it
what's this
which which three-legged person can jump
on these
what is it like for spider
[Music]
man
with nine seconds
thank you
what what's going on
this is when you do the first jump and
then you land and land you with your
hands on down onto
it
[Music]
I guess it wasn't bloated because both
are in the going at the moment
I was too far away for it to be loaded
I'm guessing it's an A plus anyway
oh this button
oh wait you got me I need more practice
do I just press this
now I need to press the other buttons
and I know I'm not overtime but
I I don't want to clear out this area
wow I thought it was fast I had to try
harder from that one
okay let's charge
yeah definitely can charge I don't need
to jump running
apparently
I think it was these are clearly pink
the new
this is a small jar containing a celery
powder this could come in handy
okay what happens
if I disable this thing
[Music]
uh
yeah
[Music]
I guess having inspired change color in
every distracting
let's say I'm not to change coloring all
the time
every time is it like
I have it
does not allow spray to be pinned and
then I want to get up there
anyway let's see
