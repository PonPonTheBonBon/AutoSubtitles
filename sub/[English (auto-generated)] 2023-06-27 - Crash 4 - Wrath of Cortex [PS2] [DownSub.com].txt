welcome

is good

and I'm loud enough to be heard over the

game

let's slow the game

and I still can't use the Red Stick To

Me

and continue trying to get this

okay

and you've got the first day

the first redeem oh it's starting off

with the racing outfit

um

it's warm today it's actually not too

warm today here

Okay so

try to get this this these boxes and

then just

get on with this lemon

I tried too many times yesterday trying

to get all this but

yeah I was keep doing things like this

and then he's missing

and when

there's a care of them there apparently

and he has falls down

there's this little child whoa there was

a gap here oh well I guess I lost the

race

I guess the car broke

I'll continue now

come on I was clipping through that one

yeah

this is annoying

no I

wanted to use it

without cable sometimes this reconnects

very quickly and sometimes not it wasn't

nothing

it looks really hard to try it's

um yeah it is

like slides around too much answer empty

machine it has a real time on

like

I've been going One Direction and if I

turn

barely turns

he has to go straight

and it feels like sometimes it goes

really fast and sometimes it feels

really slow and I have very little

control over this car

so

this is going to take a few attempts

being strong is taking the

rates more than winning the race I

really wonder is I mean that took a few

you had three attempts I don't remember

it took it took a few attempts to

actually stay on the stretch

that's it just taking trades

none of the other pressure teams has

been this difficult

and now the

attention guys

playing placing two games

it looks fine on the stream though but

just a misfortunate bound stand and then

a Mystic race

it's just too easy to miss the crates

that's

[Applause]

I mean I guess it's not too hard to miss

the crates about going like

this I mean it is easy to miss them

like I want to be careful but somehow

the vehicle is hard to try when I drive

camping

is weird

you're not at 34 cases a lot actually

compared to as well first three money

when you're riding a motorcycle and you

had like 12 crates

is it quite a difference

am I and answer if this was a real

vehicle you could just turn around and

get them

yeah the car looks like he just does

what it wants

yeah physics is just

all over the place

really should take time

and I actually don't know if you can get

the Gem from the title in this game

you can in Crash three

for this game has its own release

don't hide down there

yeah it weighed this way off

NASA the camera is terrible as well I

don't see where I'm going

hey

it would be nice if the camera was no

winter

preemptively turned before it turns

in this corner 70 so I can see where I'm

going

I guess while it's mode and I'm being

extra careful this time

a bit too careful with this game hey

well well going a bit too fast there

I think I'm terrible

no he could just step out of the car and

run along the track

and how about this thing

yeah of course of course

everything went well

until that point

yeah all games cameras tend to be bad

yeah

I feel like

camera and crash has been fine

in Life Division activity I mean there

are moments where it's

crap I guess

I guess

except when you're running towards the

camera in that case it's really bad

it's not been seven minutes so it's not

like

long time on this track yet okay

and this is supposed to be asphalt I

thought this is sliding around a lot

where's the traction

and I guess it's a lot of sand on the

roads making slippery

you're not even going that fast exactly

bar is sliding around

it feels like regardless of which speed

you're going at it it doesn't slide the

same amount or something

come on

this is ridiculous

but it is sliding more if you can pass

it but

where's the break and start

this is actually

maybe this isn't a break from the car

who needs brakes anyway

s I'm not losing lies

as quickly

we're still losing quite a few lives

is that stupid ramp

basically I've had to do this part but

this round

all right I'm gonna try to hear more

because this item there we go

I got it

I have to see if we can get rest

for now I ramp with the Box on it

that's not good

yeah that wasn't good I missed that one

oh

she got it but then I missed one so

as far as I know this is not the second

race like this so

that's good

as in class three I think

about it I had three or four of these

races but at least races were good so

that was fun

didn't expect it to be first place now

that would be cool

that you only need first place if you go

into the crystal which I've already got

the

when I reached to go and says sorry

don't get a jam you need even though

that's not the requirement or anything

I figured out how to collect one he's

like a terrible person trying to figure

out how to do this thing

and the touching the edge of business

card bounces on everything

that's how you can take it

foreign

that means nine more

it's more

oh no another one of these

and then makes

it taken outside

for

me

to

all right knife

one

yeah I got it and I'll just

park at the end

well I did it hello probably

that's some celebration I spent I don't

know how long 30 minutes today on that

trip right

oh by the table there's a jacket they

are prepping on her eskimo roller of

course it's not there

level to work man

[Music]

thank you good morning a good afternoon

I did it yes of the many attempts

after many time let him

me a missing boxes were cried really

curious walking out of the car and

get this and we're here but he's lazy

what kind of car around that's awesome

option

oh look a boss nothing

that's an attack he just oops

I'm sorry about that thing it stands

there

we go yeah checkpoint that's nice I like

that

what

lips

and also

I didn't think attached chicken funny no

wait I I looked at the wrong one

very very appropriate outfit for this

level

I don't have any ridiculous

all right

he's supposed to pick that up

I'm curious about it yeah

I suspect I missed one

yeah slowly oh oh no

him green

carefully going down here

I see one can I get up again

I got it

oh here we go here's somewhere

and and another bus is actually

attacking

for once

helping him is an inboxes

foreign

not like that

now

what I wanted to get clear out onto the

teams

what's that yeah I can see it there

then this part again

[Music]

smoking start box

top 25 oh

now I have to redo that again

oh that's close

that way there's no boxing

towards them

okay now

being careful is not connected fast

oh

and then this a little jump

come on come on

yeah I basically have to

move over to next the next platform

of course

okay terrible physics when the platform

moves under you

yeah

you don't actually move along with the

platform you actually have to work a

normal platform

otherwise it moves away from under your

feet

[Music]

currently

not the boss

nothing much arm

happen not to let's go there

huh

as far as I could see anyone no no no

box is down there oh yeah

get rid of all those

and there's the last one perfect and

there's the gem

and that's that

well I got the gym so

there's nothing of this indicating it's

a boost of some sort oh invisible one

no I'm stuck here

all right sounds like that was

some sort of small round thing

this one just

nice color

it it just goes

Pizza in the the same direction you went

over it

doesn't try to correct you for the pipe

or anything

no I'm going to be stuck here forever

because I can't get back to that one

foreign

just I have to find the exit and there

it is

[Applause]

another level complete

[Music]

um I know

hope you brought your sunscreen cause

you're gonna burn

Bang Bang

yay I did it

and now it's a let me put the air

these terrible levels

why do I need to spin them I can just go

shoot them

11 where special effects will keep me

particle effects

but there's no way the end starter and

all right checkpoint I do appreciate

that

all right

things are these

it's just some lights you don't make a

sound they look so big but yeah they're

killing it

I don't know what I did by just

something

something random

I wonder I wonder why this level isn't

my favorite

and get off the scene

sure I kind of need it to continue but

oh I'm missing a box

that's silly of me

and it looks like the end

and let's just check that right anything

hiding there

yay I'm working again

particle I think

I guess it's more that the portfolio

part of like it's bad morning

and we should have party flexi article

in it I was talking about [ __ ] face

in this game

but this game is just nothing but

punishly face there's nothing else to

talk about

I should have made crash into problem

effects too

okay what is this

what kind of

weird

oh well I do need to activate those if

I'm going to take the

gym

oh I see

that's it was that makes things supposed

to damage me or something

it's still hard to tell what's going on

here

can't wait to be done of this game

a new type of crate

oh no it ended

I wasn't paying attention

explained when you need me

all right so yeah anyway

S no

bonus

okay let's see TNT okay so I need a TNT

foreign

there you go

I'm going to start

nice jump Fahrenheit something

so I'll try again

up

here

to me anyway nothing over here must be

something later in the morning

Yep this looks normal

it might be those detect mates

I wish I had my mask but

I lost it because I didn't plan anything

quickly

Owen

quite

can I

oh there's things Emily

I know him

that works

but then I didn't know what that was

supposed to go after that

[Music]

it crashed crying

all right that was supposed to go down

on uh

forgot about that

I could probably just jump up this

straight away actually

thank you

thank you

so I will try that this time

what

what what

I'm not allowed to jump on them because

there's an invisible proof about them

okay the cable this level design is this

yeah I wanted a fair level but this is

rather cortex

should I say this is pretty good foreign

yes lines that was exactly what I want

just slide after I think

oh my

I'll I'll do this I'll do this I'm very

close to doing it

and then it's done

I'm gonna trust us to explode properly

outside the screen it's a crush game

[Music]

all right

I guess I actually can use it yeah okay

that means let me see four which are

those more and green

completo access

as it gives you one life at a time

because it probably can't display more

than one

crash head at the time

and as this happens

is

[Music]

some kind of a bug where

the future

those three things just

breaks immediately

right

[Music]

together

up here

watch out for Dallas

yes I caught piercing would be annoying

if I didn't

okay missing one box or something

[Music]

a trash can would never do something

that's evil

that I should say

those were some terrible symbols

[Music]

when I think crashes stashes

yeah

ah the triumphant hero crash

ing Ash

well that hasn't happened let's finish

this

isn't this this terrible or spell and I

mean and that counts of other bus

battles in this game

so

oh yeah it's this one

run

then just jump in this one

and then it crashes the weight stand for

an eternity

and then

if we get close enough you can use that

and then you run back on time

you can't do this without dying

what what

I say as I almost didn't die

but I guess they have a storage of three

of these mixed suits there is that just

run further first backwards

that's okay oh

that was the same

I saw that was beside it okay I couldn't

do it before that time

change the area I can get it within this

large area

this is a bit more careful

because this thing should be able to

jump so I can't jump I can just can't

move forward

and it also has to move forward all the

way up

he can't just stop perfect after he gets

the heating and then run back towards

the next one

okay because it's crashed he isn't

intelligent

and I can actually don't need to chase

him anymore

now you have to cash together all the

way

foreign

[Music]

or not

how am I supposed to see them if crash

is blocking the view

okay this bus is actually

little terrible design faster

there's a lot of a lot of the things

they do it doesn't make any sense

here in the messages

I guess okay

no no

no

we have terrifying everybody

well it somehow explodes

around I wish

okay

oh but I was jumping

into jump is slow in this thing

don't worry

foreign

it doesn't drop the stones

and it runs away they are rolling

towards you too

foreign

[Music]

why is that mine is marsupial still

collecting those crystals he's defeated

Rocco and Wawa I'm beginning to question

the value of your super weapon

I don't need another mask's help I could

take this crash punk out with my metal

arm tied behind my back

oh crunch stop being silly Uka he will

use the elemental masks no need for you

to lose any beauty sleep

and stand by Master doesn't do anything

great

I'm still not sure how I like

defeat the masses I mean

maybe they are transforming into these

big creatures and then I

kill a creature there for this story all

right

this game is weird let me

fill up on my watching and then I will

tackle this

the next group of five levels

spin

what five minutes so far

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

let's continue with level 16 Avalanche

is this a couple level I think

it seems like a bunch of hot air to me

somebody

expected

funds

is too expected

[Music]

thank God

bonus platform

thank you

[Music]

and it is needed a cocoa

as her own move sitting on

nice that scene is coming to the camera

but Kirk is just the worst crash in this

game

[Music]

there's one move that crash doesn't have

a move that crash could do in the

previous game

wait wasn't there that's my here already

why is this level doing actually I can't

even sneak

even though those seems to be designed

in such a way that

interesting platform

even though they are

seem to be designing

no try to be quick

[Music]

but I wasn't quick enough

oh

I need to see this man

thank you

they can't just jump over there

electricity need to be quick

it feels kind of like

a dog's life for this music

building up filling up more and more

and I'm serious which is Peak where his

song ends and then just cuts out

and start showing

[Music]

nice

nice to lie for me

I get nothing

and that's one a single one

in these oops didn't watch out for those

oh you die if you run for it okay

I can't nothing thank you

I get a bit more careful this time

[Music]

a bit more careful sometime okay

don't wait a bit there yeah now I got it

oh it's a bit more careful

I know it's late to that jump

thank you

for now

I did

however I see

I did my hydrate

[Music]

come welcome

soon very soon

sorry about that

unless you have like

um

[Music]

thank you

now

twitch terms now yeah that was in the

slime

okay I'll try to get

I don't remember what it gets from your

Instagram please

I have pain pills

please

control some of this thing is so weird

now

because I don't remember if you get like

but I obviously missed a lot of boxes

wait what

how did I see the jam

what

oh how what

yeah because I would like to start the

boxes that's why

that's why uh

that's why I was beautiful

back to the level

wait it wasn't you I forgot to check

that was the thing I was going to take

I'm stupid sorry for being stupid

makes it fast forward

the patched forward okay so yeah there

is there is a second gem on there there

was that was a crash was blocking the

view so I can see it

so there is a second here on this which

certainly is the slalom part

[Music]

and I obviously need it

I'm going it

[Music]

is refreshing 311

[Music]

automatic are they using that they can

make platforms to spend in the air

[Music]

go at some extra lives you're gonna need

that

since I will do a lot of you trying here

what's the point of the Mask really I

guess it's to

in case of in case of hitting a

nature

why do I try

I need to remember

red on the left

oh yeah I got it

whoa

sad fishing

[Music]

point I know what's happening with my

internet

all right

I seems to be fine now

nice sound

it's a lot of non-like traditional crash

platforming levels in this game

[Music]

I mean there's some traditional here but

student crash will start using

oops

I think that makes him worse

and I'm not sure what's the point

barely okay that was my phone

did I avoided

welcome make mistake

been here before

that's why I like everything

and also look at these climbing speeds

yeah see you tomorrow maybe I might be

on the other side

you have no idea what it decides to make

it like this

it always makes me question

did you think this was fun

foreign

[Music]

moving towards the

so I'm actually against

why do you have these here

this is how you can jump up here without

the power up you can approving why is it

perhaps yourself

you really don't need the power naps

especially with this at him

this is weird

look they give you these paragraphs but

I don't require you to hide it

personally you don't take damage from

the existing you just release

the other way around

here

anyway

I shouldn't look so deep King Steve the

mechanics of the game

that's my thing

[Music]

got this

dog's life feeling to the music

oh here we go here's the mix it

like

you can't do that and you can't reach

that

you mustn't have to try to aim for that

thing

look at this beautiful Amy here

it was on it

because it moves

why is it over the hair

why is it what is going on

I wonder why this isn't my favorite game

foreign

very annoying game

of the wild aiming controls

obviously there is no control settings

in the game the aim is inverted

nice timing

because today the only thing that I

trash couldn't do on his own is shooting

the

nature

why is it doing this

and also the shadow is really

I mean I could still shoot it was still

the aim myself

how's it if you think that way she'd

just die

and and now I have to do this thing

again

because apparently

there's a such thing as a chicken

Bradley

oh this game

I got it twice easy this time I guess

this game sure is something

you can give it's fun to put but

sometimes

who it sure can be frustrating

and the thing is

the

previous game Cars 3 on PlayStation one

but much better in electrons

like

outside it's issues but

not this much

I don't trust you okay you get to me

foreign

crash game lies ahead

[Music]

the show is everything

yeah take a mask that that's something

bad

and also

ink with the Bazooka in Cars 3 if you're

trying to aim more to try to left

Crush would actually turn

it would be different if like

if you took damage and lost the suit and

and this suit could these things crash

couldn't normally do

and that would be neat but then that's

not the case

do you want to try to play through this

section yes regular crash

I don't have the tools to allow me to do

it

oh that's what I can touch

back to me

maybe very nice still don't get why the

earthquake exclamation points like that

looks like a challenge to get this

and also the explanation points up here

before the

ah they're gone good

what should I

shouldn't go

can I get a checkpoint here so

I could see where this leads

and if there are no boxes here I could

at least go to the end get the jam and

then buy

foreign

count

foreign

taking everything easy here

[Music]

the aiming is beautiful

but sometimes it's just lands on top of

them sometimes it's

just moves back and forth in front of

them

oh no

this isn't good

like this

it can be on one side or the other side

it's just a simple press of the button

apparently I can't shoot Vine it's it's

changing position

it's not it's not like I can time it I

mean this is the ship

in that case

oh gosh these boxes would have been

destroyed by the boxes below them

that's also I will change

as far as I know

they might have changed that in in the

insane trilogy

but in the original game if you had

regular boxes next to Nitros

and then you activate the green

exclamation box

it would actually not destroy the boxes

around us

unless they are in a loaded area

okay you should something much

I guess I actually did much time at this

time

I don't want to time it but

okay

let's get this one

and I have too many masks

again I can step up the level I guess

okay so I got the jam

now I can complete the regular lemon

seniors walking across and then

and then crash

thing just explodes

yeah I can't handle that there's

what I see

get rid of you

know what

let's get it up here too

maybe I can reason from the other side

foreign

Okay so

we've got both gems

empty continuing with next level

fresh steroids is this a jetpack lemon

it's in here

accident it does comments I saw

meaningless

but each of them oh it's actually Coca

Coco cortex as a symbol an armada of

space stations that are ready to strike

the planet use the lasers on your ship

to destroy them

okay

I should go and find this

wow

thanks guys go around and find some

boxes to destroy

and destroying air

as far as I know I think you're supposed

to

excuse me

trying to attack

your space stations

thank you supposed to take this

bring down the shield

actually

wait what honey last one

that's one of them

what

what happens

[Music]

give me a standard I left away for half

a second and and then was over

here came most friendly destroyed only

the boxes

and uh

hello Irene welcome

they're shooting me from behind that's

not nice

thank you

they're just trying to strength

straight into me that might be what

happened when I just randomly

if you came this random start overs it's

almost

time straight into me how is that fair

thank you

yeah how is that as a challenge is what

I mean

nice

because they can spawn new enemies to

try me with

that it's not like I can use that

directly

also I destroyed this

space balloons

and they thought are other than 69.

so the store these space balloons and

then they dropped the boxes down

down hey

we're in space

there's no down

two oh there's one

and then

you know I have one box left

oh no it's all the way over there

I got it nice

yeah it's just suicides

yeah I did it

is there a Planet close by

I couldn't see one but there's a small

planet some way

but there's no Planet below as far as I

can see

still wouldn't make sense because I

would assume because if everything is in

Orbit everything moves up and has the

same like

as the velocity enough to keep

themselves in the orbit and that would

also involve the boxes being in orbit so

even if you destroy the balloons they

will still will continue their orbits

so yeah perfect so it's lemon hello Greg

there's a lot of stuff about space

racing games and movies that doesn't

make sense yeah they don't get space

destroy the orbit

well now I'm underwater or inside water

actually

so it's a good time to wear a swimsuit

oh hello 10 tackle

[Music]

is that a

is that a love and everything you're

sending out

is that some abilities in giraffes have

that I don't know about so I didn't

destroy me

the Bible suggest that you're staying up

there

I think I love being

yep

giraffe said well no but I love beans

they're just going to destroy everything

now

thank you

I want anything I won't let anything

enter the screen hey why are you

entering the screen

you said that you weren't allowed to

it oh

are you you made them

because I actually haven't haven't asked

that before if you made your own

excited

uh

like a spaceship needing to bank to

interns in space

the fuana needs to Bank in space to

there's no atmosphere you provide lift

for banking

yeah

I got someone

oops I died

I got someone to make them I wish I was

10.

you're right do you have talents

well they are beautiful so

you found someone

's here I didn't know that because I was

destroying everything

thank you

just want to be sure I had left anything

down today his Trucking a bomb

are you having a good day

well I mean

I defeated those

make sure I haven't left anything those

crash levels I guess I've had a good day

oh man

oh no and then they are very very

not giving many checkpoints this game

foreign

am I stupid

I mean I am I am stupid but

that was too stupid

maybe bubbles means that it has been

destroyed

right there

[Music]

foreign

not to see on the box system

I got a checkpoint

nice

wait that wasn't

mistake

I'm destroying everything here

another thing that games enemies get

wrong about space physics the spaceships

engine you need to completely generate

boards such to maintain speed because

that would just make you go fast and

faster which would make stopping or

changing very difficult that would make

for boring gameplay to test that I mean

with it

I mean if you're going to make it about

space you can still make it realistic

and work around that

foreign

but having the fish walk on this seat

don't worry

and even though it's a fish you should

be able to move really because it would

be boring if you could swim freely as a

fish and you're gonna okay we're going

to set it in a certain environment you

can have to work around that

honestly that's my opinion at least

okay I guess

enough being able to see the tentacle

determines if you just tender color

oh that was close

foreign

[Music]

just destroys

now

[Music]

and that fish looks like the background

what

oh yeah I'm supposed to go around on

that

let's see

if you're gonna be tired

I just need to be up even more High cake

that's my special day

foreign

they have to add arrows to

let the players know where to go

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

I don't know if it was posted yesterday

no

patched enemy

and Counting these as part of practice

oh my oh my

you know what insta kill for breaking

the boxes wait happens for students

thank you

I guess that works

I'm not sure how I did it differently

but

the Heat box is something I think so too

large

there's my current issue

my device here

oh that was so fast that was the first

one

no I was in a hurry to get to the button

please say that I got a thousand

all the boxes

I'd sure like to put these

oh yes

we started at the end of the levels in

his game

and I can crash two and three where

they're working in Middle

Burg Heights we still have to get to the

end of level two

as you do let me know if my voice is in

sync with the game and I could do like a

test counting bouncing bounces

on trades like here

Boeing

Point boy

I can make a small adjustment

s

[Music]

two three four

five five

[Music]

that was silly

[Music]

very silly of me

but it is pretty fun

I want to see if you could do it on

the bouncing

that's the one your intended to sneak on

anyone that's just not bouncing all

right tips

okay now just messing up

let's see

that's something

[Music]

thank you

I can't okay that's that's not how the

rules work the game is breaking in some

rooms here

I I wanted to get off them

off it

in a safe way but apparently walking off

it which you're supposed to do

is not valid

well let's see

oh what a sentence well no I activated

TNT

I was gonna see how am I supposed to get

through here it just stopped

in that case I can't get do you think

please

I'm trying to decentral regulations

I'm not sure

[Music]

the giant fan blades do stop

occasionally

and this one is this so we can move

because here first one short moment

because even they noticed that climbing

was such a slow and tedious

[Music]

but instead of making a clamp faster

they just found out it was nice

interesting design

[Music]

thank you

foreign

wait a minute

yeah there we go

what a simple Landing

it's a belly fluff at the end

this game does give you a lot of extra

lives in bonuses

it is nice

[Music]

as you can see where am I supposed to go

foreign

above it

was it yours

what is your favorite crash game I

actually don't know

it's like fresh one or three

they're definitely not crashed it let's

be support for this

I definitely not this key

I do think this game could have a

potential as a remake

everything annoying about it

it's how slow the game is

her three is mine

that's understandable it is a good game

another city we make is good to

you again got you on that

wow

go to gym

Crystal too

did I miss the crystal at the end

[Music]

okay that was pretty easy

atmospheric pressure the final mask

hey look the orange boy likes to fly

time to earn your wings kid

yeah they didn't have much of a script

to this game I feel like

whoa whoa whoa

excuse me

wait LPS what are you doing

okay

[ __ ]

huh

listen hi we've got so much health

foreign

foreign

why was that one so short

and

so

I don't know what happened there

foreign

okay let's see

celebrations and

cheerleading

yeah

when I was 69.

that time too

now I'm in a lead we have

this needs to be in here

and I might actually win this

[Music]

something's happening huh thank you cage

by the beats

that says sudden

all of a sudden

nothing tied to that but it's early but

some people have

I should probably set something

not much else left

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

left

[Music]

well here we are again I wouldn't

necessarily call this irony but don't

you find it a little odd that we keep

meeting under these same world

nomination circumstances why not just

give up and let me win for once

don't worry Dr Cortez

now that my elemental powers have

reached Max

this little game wish he was never

created

oh

maximum compass

capacity elements

that didn't happen you didn't see that

this one you can stand on the moon now

this is just the

it's very moving

that's a bit weird

yeah this is one handles

foreign

Ty

you got in the way

I don't need

oh that wasn't me

it just got destroyed by its own

it wasn't tricky buddy

explosion must do remind me more

informally

Bear died

so why not might not

whatever that one contains but never

know

what

foreign

normally is an exclamation point at the

end of level

that doesn't mean there's actually this

one

that's it targeting with my suitcase

still kind of terrible

I still feels better than

oh

I didn't expect to happen it still feels

better than

the much

[Music]

don't worry they're my quickly back

wow wow

what happens

wait

[Music]

point point point point point point

oops drama

a mask in a bonus

that's that's crazy

no no

now

foreign

whoa I was sleep after him

this is Nick

how's everything

I can also tell from me

one two three four five one one one

see foot forward no no that's all the

boxes

yeah

my test okay Slide the fire

you can have a glitch here I need to

approach that's perfect

someone should look over those leaks

I'm destroying every box except for the

balance in the Box

foreign

I wouldn't trust the platform that is

floating across lava but I mean I guess

if it it's my only way across

like these these four

yeah I would probably not trust floating

platform

but there's a skeleton in this game who

is the engineer

this third person here

I am holding down the

the

oh now it starts aiming

weird I was

I was holding down the aim button but he

was walking around for some reason

oh oh no

another one

yeah it's safe here

oh there's no

well I don't think it like four

I'm not a dead person

I don't think you need the test platform

to get all the gems I hope not

yeah I'm pretty

cute amount

boxes

my direction must be slowly

wait a minute

if I'm missing one box then because of

that one

foreign

exclamation point at the end so I don't

need to destroy all these

[Music]

perfect

so well as I said I must go for 100 so

why not go to back and because I asked

that last yesterday if I should go back

[Music]

and redo levels to just achieve 100 or

before defeating Vortex so after the

cortex

I got one after one without saying

before

like

yeah basically go back to level eight

hundred percent

if possible

I will however

try to go foreign

platforms

see that attached to you by me

parking there

rather than any form of explosions

now it's fine

I just need to worry about the color no

the Box gym

huh

yep yep wait

and I lost my mask from me

I mean I took them from this one but

yeah maybe no I didn't have two muscles

I only had one

and I lost it

you hit my life back

then

oh my okay so

and

need this probably away

around it but

wait a minute I'm tight

I forgot about that quite

I was supposed to get here without dying

but at least I got here now so now I

just need to redo this without dying

[Music]

[Music]

okay uh

so sorry sorry I didn't as I said that

was a bit suspective so let me go on

with the redeems hybrid

and swimsuit

it's now really

yeah it really I can't wait until they

release the update for the

that scene

so I can use it for to automate the

outfit changes

oh my God now I got the two masks

Owen

oh I got the checkpoint

wait I shouldn't have checkpoint

why is it that wait it doesn't matter if

I can't check right now because I'm

dying apparently

because his death

and even if I don't have any checkpoints

is that line

what

laughs

it's safe

[Music]

ding ding

your thoughts I can safely pass soon

and then I need to get rid of this one I

mean I got a double mask

but now I think it's actually been nice

let's wait for that one

such a short timing

I mean I had to wait for that lift scene

wow wow

what happened

let me get through the PFT so I can get

through here

you can do it safe but at least I'm

still way too many

how am I supposed to get through this

oh I mean now it's time to jump over

just yet

if I

had welcome

yeah I suppose I should stand on this

and duck

oh that was close

this is

thank you

enough this this is a bit dangerous yeah

I really don't like her but

oh I see I see I don't like how crash

game loves to do it when they use the

same platform design or two different

kinds of platforms

all right so in this case they use the

same platform for the moving platform

and the phone platform

and I think actually actually I think

crash one through three

have that much more consistent that

moving platform and falling platform

have different designs oh there's the

red one you know what that means

So Yesterday don't forget

this level

as the red platform

red

and red ribbing

I seems a movie

or if you want to say a red gem

that would be n red and stand

which

um

for like English term would be gemstone

and Stan is Stone but Adam that's more

like

and it's definitely niche

precious yes testing is right and this

level I also use the same platform for

the movements but I guess those are

retracting ones

so yeah it means precious

Stone

[Music]

can you spell Edelstein

[Music]

I can speak even slower to make it easy

I own the Crash Bandicoot Trilogy team

oh nice

this isn't part of the Crash Bandicoot

trilogy but nice

I hope you enjoy the games I do like the

games I think

they are like minor issues with it with

the trilogy the remakes I meant to say

but not really like you that ruins the

experience everything

there's

I hope I get back to a good point

but the messages floating in front of

the face getting attached

why can't Coco use the

can you throw it here

okay

this

whoa whoa whoa whoa take it easy

could have hurt me

is that what you're trying to do

oops okay so I don't need the red gem

for the Box Jam

wait let's see what you've got no I

can't spell it

okay Owen

and then stand that's how you spell it

[Music]

one more try

wait

next question

that way

I can't okay I can't do that that was

annoying

what what is this

[Music]

I guess that sound was the

[Music]

I was gonna say did I die or not

I was in a Quantum state of being dead

and not that at the same time

did I ask the question then I was dead

you got this pumpkin welcome it to me

happy to see you here

I will oh nice

I am doing my best

and my best is sometimes not enough but

uh shh I'm sure I'm trying

[Music]

oh what

[Music]

uh I should do like a no jump

let's see

oh don't don't step off that

okay along it's very hard to see where

where I'm standing

what

is that touch

you don't touch any drone

[Music]

[Music]

anyway and one more try

[Music]

the uh

and the gem

sections of these levels

oh nice tiny just destroy everything

all right good she's up that one too

of this game really are a challenge

which I guess is the point

but sometimes the challenges don't feel

very

like like this not this section this is

a fair shot like this

it's more like this section

[Music]

where am I supposed to go

where am I supposed to go

the level is ended

up

let that one have fun thank you for

joining cage Plus

it was fun that he he came by

have a nice sleep

because I've seen you will be doing

oh

nice nice

so I will defeat this level

now I got a double mask

because I

and that I had apparently

and this girl

come here here I assume it's the regular

girl

no wait it's The no no it's the gem

basket

it's like

find the camera

that's that's why this section turns

around and

foreign

[Music]

wait a minute

[Music]

I should have used to wasting my

mask

actually

never that bad I should do this

invincibility boosters through their own

area

like that but it's like

there's an invisible wall to the right

of that bounces in preventing you from

jumping towards the right

don't ask me where is it it's like that

two words and then

but the bouncing box is not placed right

in front of the

the what you call it

awning I don't know anyone

so I have to move to the right but I

want to move diagonally

that makes my charm shorter and then I

can't make it so I have to do it

it wasn't a mouse

just just landed and stepped off

I mean I guess from a realistic

[Music]

if you go to Boston those they wouldn't

be bouncing on the edge because that's

where they are

these courts are placed but it doesn't

need to be realistic

that's when someone says but you asked

about having more at least expenses

I think there is a limit to how

realistic you need to make the platform

need to be

[Music]

because this level just had an invisible

one preventing me to jump out onto that

scene so

so I think it has

one

no what

how close they need to be

I was about to say Coco which I mean

it's just syllables of the same cinnamon

so I guess

and does have a

so-called belly flock by stomping ground

Stone

yes I do wonder what that scene will do

and

there's this one already got and the

chocolate as well not really sure that's

that power is

I want the jam but I'm really curious

about that remember

[Music]

because I haven't checked this oh it

doesn't show up again

but yeah so cortex gives the power up

and then there's the power up here it's

a weird placement for power up to be

honest

[Music]

for a more powerful Bell flock press I

have to jump and then press drag by the

top

okay

so it's just long earrings okay

[Music]

very good so apparently there are no

boxes here so I would just

so

that just somehow means unbox someone

absolutely level

I don't know how I didn't get the boxing

in that case

oh wait I know how I didn't get boxed

him

because I think I thought I couldn't get

the boxing because I need anything

maybe I was dancing

me I am silly

like that that was silly

[Music]

so yeah I think I just think you know

what the box is because

that's not it

I think this really in this game is that

now I've turned uh paths regardless if

they are colored Gems or this

broths they have they don't have any

boxes I could be misremembering as in

boxes you have to collect

no now I now I remember it was this

bonus I was doing

and this bonus

so annoying

so I gave up on it

that timing did you see yeah it was this

thing

and you see that timing

someone should say my replay on that

foreign

I hope so

but I will put

it

on anything

every day

okay now I should get the boxing too so

I got the bonus Jam

I will not will not get the box Jam

and I got the power ft

[Music]

uh

that was nice and then I have to well at

least I get to keep the bonus boxes

although it looks like

no it wasn't

and that was something

like

I was gonna say it looks like a Mr TNT

but it was just a window

[Music]

hopefully this one doesn't have because

it was the other cocoa lemon

where I activate the

exclamation point and it activates

boxes in a different part of the bonus

lemon

hope that's not the case here

I do know about that but uh

you see it's unboxes

yes it was waiting at two boxes

uh but then I get got those two too I

was a bit worried there

[Music]

foreign

nice nights I should probably say for

that

and then I can continue

[Music]

so many steps to just change

oh

yeah

[Music]

don't rush oh no I love these seven

this level is the one they have on the

Wikipedia page for this

[Music]

Wikipedia in Swedish is Wikipedia but

it's funny it's the same

thank you

around at this level

oh yeah this lemon

oh you can't protect that one okay

where's the wild west lemon

look at that face

I I missed it back and what's this level

um

don't get to see what level is called I

mean they clearly don't have enough

space here to fit it uh

I think they put the level names

games

it was called Gold Rush yes

do you feel familiar with this level

do you feel at home

will with all these cactuses and I did

say that intentionally another one or

another reverse bonus

what what that wasn't even the correct

desk

it was water it was supposed to be a

water day

I was trying to make a corny challenge

your joke was so corny I didn't even get

it

oh it's a Race Against Time

maybe not

one two three four five

it's so weird when they activate when

you're shooting

establish crash Foods

it wasn't me

it's set up an extra lives

[Music]

oh my God you attacked the birds

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

feature but

is unreliable

and another

week

section

what would that light

I guess it's supposed to be like

flashing

that's not how and the light source is

like light effect is in front of the

lamp

all right so yeah yeah this game needs

an overhaul

safety please okay

timing okay this is twitching

how do I

find something

I don't use any boxes

when did he get all that speed from

well thank you for the bouncy box

I I really need

it's like you put the bouncy box on the

first climbing section to show that

bouncing this and then you get to the

climbing section and then you have the

neck and then it should be a short

timing section

so so the plane jumps down and then you

have another climbing section

without the uh

bouncy box and then playing it realizes

oh I can just jump up

to any point

I don't have I don't need about it

and that's how you make

oh nice

oh nice who is Swedish for politics

so oh nice means not nice

it was a nice in Swedish it's a bit

different from English

nice in Swedish is basically only used

for when something is like

it's not it's not the kindness kind of

nice

if that makes sense

did you have a nice

and it's us not sarcastic that's I mean

you can use in sarcastic plane but that

requires sarcasm done of course

but uh

someone does something

yeah

look at that

someone does something cool but hey but

it's not cool it's nice

when you use it

and you can spell it in Swedish or

English way that's up to you

[Music]

I was like that thing

foreign

and I'm walking into other expenses

how have you been it's been

been I I've been I have existed

that's

the best for Saturn

no that was too far

oh do I need to start all the way from

here

oh that was

kind of scene left me

embarrassing I know the stupid of me

sorry for my embarrassment I'm

humiliating myself here

[Music]

okay

that's Chastity can I shoot that I mean

no of course not

you would be able to do that incredible

bye

I mean it kind of makes sense did you

take damage from when they appear but

be a bit more fair please

[Music]

of those

what if I just shoot this thing from

here

to bother about that

huh oh there it is

this week

this is the correct amount

now just wait for a timing

and then I hit it even

beautiful

[Music]

but I do still have that gem to pick up

yes

I'll bring you something

I'll bring you a spin

[Music]

okay not time this time

pick up that chain

oh no he hurt his foot

oh no I know I need to go back to Fourth

room because that's how this game works

[Music]

this game is showing something

I was also thinking and with the outfit

changes that

[Music]

yes you should when I get the automated

system running I can make it

I can make it a queue

and then

yeah I was supposed to not die let's

pick up the important boxes

well that was close

didn't see it it was kinda

Melody

I think yes I can't shoot the bed

because it's not packing I can't see the

bag

it

oh okay

I'll take that life

I've lost a few

and I do Wonder with a remake

G maker

because they can't really make a review

there was the idea I had for spiral

obviously not going to do it but make a

second Trilogy of

uh entry dragonfly where they

make less buggy and performary

and then

then they could also remake

a hairstyle

yeah

but it would be nice if they took a hair

stain and then like made it more like a

traditional spider game

because they it's it still has its

segmented designated areas

they could be I mean

so they could make it be like uh

yeah

okay so those areas are portals instead

and then really making it feel like an

original

traditional spiral

and then

boys add action gems to the cameras

instead of the

way the test now where you can

well the gems doesn't respond enemies

respond and they continue to give you a

chance

at the gym baggies are also not feel

great

all right good thing I had my mask

I really need to be careful bye

it

got another mask and

boys why is Dr cortex wanted

what has he done

I mean yes there are a lot of things to

be fair

I can do this

blood

whoa does disappeared

I wasn't prepared for that

I can just join this the normal way

okay that's the gem yeah get rid of that

one damn and girl I got it whatever Dr

cortex is founded for his innocent he's

been set up

[Music]

he but my question is more like what has

he done to that word oh I got to kill

them didn't let go learning the level

right but I guess the whole level was

kind of yellow brown itself

it was hard to tell me

oh no

another one

a day anyway

another hamster ball level yes

another one of these

Sapphire

plus one

a lot of boxes a lot of fruit

soon

now I didn't want to make such a

um

this grass here kind of made me think

about some boxes

it's just in green

but they are up here

where there is no practice

one because I wanted to go down here yes

that was the issue to ensure

these things are loud

and why are these boxes flying

oh plasma balls

you experience with us

those are fun

Maybe

nothing okay what it means

and I assume there's nothing up there

Loki

nope

and this is going on

yeah this is a game of

knocking

why are you being smoking now we just

wanted more particle effects

wait what is something over here

another

feature boxes here

an alternative pass

it doesn't really give you like the

okay now I know there is nothing there

it is

because there is there is a tight run

and

these two here's a tank journal and

shown in time travel you could like take

a shorter route with going around those

natures and stuff but that part doesn't

even look shorter and this pass with all

these boxes might have tracks time to

track subtraction

so

all right she could survive a bit there

interesting

well I have one

I have one somewhere around

oh nice

I like this piece

it's very

this kind of theme

[Music]

but now I see this past down here but

let's see if there's an Xboxes here

that's probably fine hopefully I don't

miss any boxes at the end

and the height of that

fall I should have just tried the ball

if it's

I think I should go down here

I sing

okay not not anything

they really should have put boxes today

[Music]

I'm going up

but then is that right

you should take this checkpoint because

according to rules of this game

boxes that are broken regardless of when

they pick up the checkpoints that appear

before the checkpoint

these counts towards the checkpoint

it doesn't yeah that's the one

okay there was nothing here

going up again

okay

the last one wasn't a boss okay first

boxes boss says okay that's

interesting

I don't know if I don't miss a box now

this is very confusing

which I guess is the point

but it's a nice addition of the fruit

because that's just where it had been

okay so I have to go around with

something

[Music]

nope I can't touch them

it doesn't seem to be any boxes of this

whole thing

that's that's convenient

hello hello

welcome kitten

yeah

it's been

where have you been

it's all these are on stream

I haven't heard a word from you

have you been in here

lacking

thank you

yeah

all right okay

okay

and then we got

hopefully this is all boxes it is not on

boxes it might be more article

no because there was a box oh that means

five boxes

they really missed five boxes

you know what that means yes I'm packing

up some stuff ah

[Music]

it means that I'm

right

and want to continue next week because I

really don't want the video then let me

know

and I still have like uh after getting

those last levels I still have to do

some more gem fetching and then I have

to do the then there is like additional

like in part three in this platform in

the middle today I have plenty plenty

left to do in the game

[Music]

so

[Music]

again should I do it again

can do it again

I give it I give it one more try

encore encore

foreign

which I think they might be

and you got this I think

thank you

nice to see you here

very happy to see you too

me Rocket Man number one

you are

would have came already I would just

woke up

oh yeah

you've been sleeping late

last night

thank you

and then wait so after I do this I do

have a planned read

for someone who should be streaming

and hopefully when when I'm done

I was working night shift so I'm not

doing it yeah yeah

I had something that you were supposed

to do so it makes sense

now you're here

maybe you can join the race team

just to say hello

well what happened there that was a

strange Behavior

okay let's see so I checked this path

it's only those two I can go up slightly

more to check yeah

then this should I just check this

corner

there's nothing here

fell

I had a good time watching the stream

okay the bed are you going to bed now

oh okay then

I I didn't expect it to go back at this

time

that's Joy

now I had problem oh no

what

that doesn't mean

that doesn't feel great

that doesn't sound great at all what's

the problem do you want to talk about

right I don't want you to feel bad

I am here for you if you want to

if I can make you feel better

no more mistakes

[Music]

press it

it is possible

because

look I'm alive

oh a weird accident

that's it

because I gotta checkpointe

that sounds like he's

drawn towards those

day trash

oh nice

when

I guess that's the end of the stream

then

let's see I know

oh well

oh it did something

he finally died

I just need to check

if there are any

Knights on this path

because

there is a pass down there

and that might just be where the boxes

are hiding

sure doesn't make it easy

especially if you get stuck

back on

up hey what's inside

it was just a little troll

is there's a different way to get down

there too

about here

because I was supposed to check every

part

yeah you can't just go yeah yeah they

can't be any boxes there because you

can't you can't even fit okay

definitely didn't have to put in that

box this day

let's get a balances

there is one other place

traveling on the wall

there's one other place I think those

boxes are located

okay I'll go down here then

and it might be

all right

I do get that down there from

this this area anyways let's let's just

pick up the boxes up here at first

up up

and that's this

it is this place

okay is for his garden

so actually there are some boxes here

he's starting

yeah there you go there's Canada

some extra lives for fresh

he doesn't want crashing at those

I just need to get out of here but I

probably need to get out

[Music]

please be sack

all right there yeah

now I can go and get the gym

and then that's that's enough

okay and then there are snow boxes in

this and yes

[Music]

and that's it I should go straight

no

[Music]

it's kind of kind of an area between the

and now I have to go back here

an area where where the water and you

pay I guess it is neat so you can stand

for something

thank you

at least there's no problem getting back

just run around in

like that

we should really make you see

you're not terrible

boss

and guards

guard this place so crash don't go in

there

but I am okay I'm only going to move

this far and not not a step further

okay I should go straight down

here we go I did it

foreign

he does something

there you go

and that's all the boxes

and triple can move very quickly oh yeah

that's it they they are in many many

different locations for some reason and

they also attack

that's something

kindly just stands very much side to

side but

but bye

barely an effort

okay now I see it on stream are we happy

now

I'm happy with that

so

that's depression for this week

more crashing next week when I will

continue the game of course

tomorrow is my rest today we'll take it

easy yay save those dreams and then

I will

[Music]

beep playing Spider and the you know

Aspire here's tale

next and on the second Friday after that

and then more drawing on Saturday Sunday

where I will draw the next character I

guess
