[Music]
welcome and I have
[Music]
not really prepared apparently
not connected everything properly
there we go
let's begin
[Music]
the game volume should be a bit low this
time because I
listening Back to the Future
the volume was kind of loud and I think
I do think it could be wrong what is
that
[Music]
I do believe oh oh
the sound from game for Advance it's
just louder
[Music]
and okay Gem Rush
these levels are something
me
[Music]
[Music]
I found that way
[Music]
it's fine sleeping
I don't think I gained as he promised
but hopefully like like the gems yeah so
oh
[Music]
we're spinning these gems out everywhere
[Music]
okay so you must be able to get up there
somehow
I don't really have to take it from here
[Music]
it sounds like you can balance and
understand
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
okay since I
[Music]
don't think about something
okay I'm bouncing on the roof without
the ceiling
[Music]
hand too
[Music]
oh yeah
[Music]
it's very very not too much much time to
[Music]
everything you didn't get to keep the
challenge okay
less mistakes the time
[Music]
nice nice
mistake was made you really don't let
you do many mistakes
[Music]
wow it's so hard to get them to these
platform with this on them
[Music]
[Music]
and now I don't access these stems
[Music]
well this is
[Music]
it's so easy to myself
[Music]
down here
at the gym
[Music]
all right
the way Aspire is you can't just turn
around yeah he has to step forward
and everything they run
like sure it doesn't move doesn't do it
much but that's little he moves is
enough to ruin so much
so many times I think due to that little
moment
initially is not having killed it
[Music]
and now I just fail together then
[Music]
nice jump day
yeah I I would have had a shirt to run
but the jump fade twice
[Music]
very very picky about the jumps as well
[Music]
and the way you can step very far have
said the platform
and still stand on it
[Music]
again just no chubby just steps off the
platform and then he will attempt to
jump
[Music]
yeah this is going to be very tricky
[Music]
and I'm probably not even going to get
anything from this I have to at least
complete one of these
[Music]
oh yeah
I managed to kill the enemy but no
and also got the jam but there we go
finally he did it that's what you get 40
gems
nothing
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
yeah
[Music]
I can send it something yeah here we go
a bit of that one
nice double jump spiral
[Music]
okay I got that one let's see one down
here yes that was the last one
[Music]
oh
[Music]
that was interesting to say
[Music]
nice I can't see my progress or anything
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
okay
well
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
I've been Bond moves like that she did
and then next level
[Music]
tonight yeah it is just the same level
same
same enemy in the ball is just moving
so much quicker
[Music]
it's so quick so much cooking
[Music]
I can't go sick yeah
I think it does some some kind of
if the center of the ball isn't
touching the
the platform or something it doesn't
count as anything
[Music]
okay the last one please
[Music]
it's behaving very nicely
thank you
[Music]
thank you
so quickly
making small adjustments is so hard
[Music]
hello neighbor hijri
[Music]
that's a hundred oh
[Music]
this game isn't this yes
yeah
[Music]
why am I supposed to kill
I don't know I don't know because it's
not overview or something
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
how am I supposed to know
thank you
[Music]
alternative write this down
[Music]
okay let me write this down
[Music]
what do we have
triangle
we don't have a rhombus thingy but we
have a square a circle I meant to say
[Music]
we do have a square
[Music]
some reason I've been small enough
[Music]
oh yeah then it's a
star
[Music]
and finally across
there we go that's the CMOS
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
yeah that works different
[Music]
okay then
and this this thing you can do which you
only can do in the air and we're not
being able to press the button to charge
or something
[Music]
okay
so I've done the star
so I removed that from the list
thank you
[Music]
what was that
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
so instead here
[Music]
triangle here
and this square tin
put some Aspire type
[Music]
[Music]
I don't know about these
[Music]
I can't try to complete one of the ACC
what it keeps me
[Music]
and it almost completes one of these
most but I did miss a jam
[Music]
pretty much because it moves pretty
quickly up
and so I missed it so I basically need
to be at the top of the screen
so when that happens I can move down and
pick it up
[Music]
like oh it was so slowly backwards
[Music]
hanging no more
[Music]
ugly cheeks please
[Music]
there you go I got everything
you did it
oh do you have nothing
nothing okay
okay so I can basically ignore all of
those
and that's the square circle
that means I have done all the levels in
this world now I can go back which yeah
it's quickly but it's fine although I
can see that level so
[Music]
thank you
and the portal to the next place is
here
now next World Prime new levels
I had them listed again
[Music]
just
get right in the back
[Music]
ah I know
[Music]
I also don't know which words I've
gotten on Jameson
[Music]
I have done some the first one
[Music]
you have to track so much notes
by yourself
the cross is done
all right
[Music]
when I have to do all of these
it should be easy to navigate now
[Music]
that's moving on to the next area
[Music]
listen
that's from the list
and here wasn't any level this was just
it's this one yes the quarter larustis
which I have completed
I'm just out of here
[Music]
but it doesn't count
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
okay let's do this
[Music]
[Music]
like how am I supposed to see that
[Music]
headshots
[Music]
screams in agony
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
yeah
[Music]
building scientists in the head
I am very
[Music]
repetitive sound
oh
that wasn't Fang
I like this game's fan
[Music]
okay I want to keep back this time
[Music]
where's the gun
oh I don't have anything to shoot me
[Music]
finally girl he did it that's I have to
do it one more time
[Music]
this is probably the hardest one to do
because of the year
not being able to see what's up
[Music]
reacted everything
[Music]
and when you can only hold one ammo this
one
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I can't flip and shoot at the same time
I had to flip over and I really try to
shoot that signed in the same time
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
thank you can avoid them next time
foreign
[Music]
there we go
oh I took damage anyway
[Music]
and I thought I was clever
[Music]
oh I got one
wait for it to pass
oh I was landing on a scientist does not
damage the scientists
[Music]
give it
[Music]
okay where's it going there it is nice I
did it this means that
this circle is complete this one so we
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
chickens
[Music]
okay so they're not watches here
[Music]
thank you
so here would be the first punch
maybe they are healthy decor
ating
I just know
[Music]
what torches here
unless they hide them on beneath below
behind that's right
[Music]
behind the portals
if there is one
let's get something
and please can you give me something
[Music]
you want to sleep
[Music]
laughs
this one
and this one
it's a funny and this one
that's all of them I think
I guess I didn't get anything from it
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
here but I don't think
I think that's just to be shown I don't
think they do anything
yeah
foreign
[Music]
level one
time to do level two
this takes two but if you shoot really
quickly
if they take morning too
[Music]
which I don't think
I know
I don't feel like enemies should have me
to be disability after you hit them
anyway
unless it's like a boss or something
[Music]
I didn't know
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
but this way you can choose
right instead of counters not push-ups
250
[Music]
there you go
quite a long level
but I have to do it one more time
and then I'm done with this area
and then I have two more ones
[Music]
okay
[Music]
take damage from that
[Music]
actually
I think its sound is from he's actually
from the bullets or whatever you call
them and getting destroying one and then
we're getting heat it's because it also
makes noise Awards and the wall is
obviously don't take damage which person
you know
oh
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I took damage
[Music]
[Music]
another way
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
exit
[Music]
which should be over here
[Music]
five mountains let's see which levels I
have left to do here foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
Ring of Fire
two times oh it's one of these
okay level two shouldn't be too Hardy
just slightly quickly it's not much
quicker in these levels
[Music]
the way it moved
[Music]
it is
[Music]
worry about that anymore
[Music]
it's the third level I'm worried about
because this time the ball is really
quick yep
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
infinix
yeah
no I didn't do that and Pen
[Music]
drop the ball
[Music]
come on
there we go
[Music]
it moves that wasn't fine is it going to
take a while I'm just going to do this
[Music]
there you go
if ball is still on the screen I have
not lost yet
[Music]
yep
these shows how terrible the game is
the phone is still on the screen
[Music]
there you go
[Music]
I wonder what is harder the
magnet working minigame or
this minigame
[Music]
over slowly
[Music]
perfect he didn't
I have now completed the triangle we
removed after the list
[Music]
me I do like to eat funny I've never
eaten bunnies actually kind of thing
[Music]
right spiral
this is not that one was count
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
this one is completed
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
that's just an assumption actually now
maybe she was like yeah you still have
lemons left here that you haven't
defeated three times here
[Music]
this one is simple quick and easy
[Music]
beads
[Music]
[Music]
and now the third level
and now they are even stronger
I think layout is a bit different
[Music]
all right that's nice
maybe this is a bit tricky
thank you
[Music]
yeah it looks really exciting layouts
well
[Music]
I Mark the stars then
bracket and clap
right
sheep
[Music]
now
only this Square left then
[Music]
anything that they did will go with
shape some of my I don't know letters
numbers
yeah
This is Dusty flash on this does that
mean that
Square level is
releases three times
[Music]
what is the square level
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
I don't even know what it's going to
square them at least
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
I am a bit confused
thank you
[Music]
hello
[Music]
and Korean stuff
[Music]
oops
thank you for the product
[Music]
how are you doing
um all right yes that was a slow day
today not much activity yeah
it's a champ has been very quiet today
so I'm happy that you should have
just binging up and hopefully this game
I don't know how far
I'm talking so far
I am looking for a square lemon of
course
ha
and
that I have found it before
Maybe
maybe it was here
there's another thing
oh here it is oh it's completed so maybe
Sparks must correct about me going
through that
oh no
I've heard the untreated
and thank you
well I wanted to post more there
but I just
you should never take my time to post
anything
I should like like this way
[Music]
can I have a follow back uh
um
[Music]
well it's it's just that
okay I hope you understand that if I
were to follow everyone here
about me that would be
a lot for me to follow in harder for me
to like give check if you've ever seen
nobody understand
and I of course of course most people I
haven't asked to be fair but
and I shouldn't like if I start
you know follow for follow it
[Music]
it's
no let's
see that you don't have to follow me if
you don't want it it's that's fine
[Music]
I respect
[Music]
and I start off with painting
so this is the last one
and I just need to make sure I finish
these levels
three times are you complete them once
[Music]
I don't know if you're completing one of
these more than once before
otherwise it's basically 10
runs to complete
[Music]
um
[Music]
[Music]
okay nice soundtrack what is it like
pinkish and like printing paper
[Music]
making any
blade from you because lady
from a lettuce
[Music]
no problem so far there we go that takes
it
[Music]
and then
another
introduce miles
[Music]
I don't care I was actually shooting
everything
[Music]
we need to do that
[Music]
[Music]
no ceiling
[Music]
sounds head
that one I can jump on me
thank you
[Music]
there we go yes
[Music]
I have to end up there now
yes
spiral plus one
that's the circle done
[Music]
more crazy levels do we have here
[Music]
and then I'm just see if I can get all
the training courses one
bring them
bitter flights
this one shouldn't be too tricky I hope
[Music]
um that's that
this one will be really a little tricky
[Music]
and strengthening that one
so far
[Music]
all right
keep to the side
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
you know the way you didn't eat but only
once earthquakes actually
third time to charm
all right
more than a little too far
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
he actually stuck this time
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
just sneak past there we go
[Music]
done
[Music]
that's done yeah it's one of those
falling to pieces when it throw
molotovs there's something on the
outside here I can get it
I see this
[Music]
excuse me
and there doesn't seem to be another way
[Music]
what was that
[Music]
[Music]
yeah I don't know how to get there
[Music]
so I think twice
[Music]
I think I twice got on all the gems in
previous ones which should be two and
three
and then you just suppose
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
and then I just need to pick up
and gems
okay and that that case I'm gonna go
this way
[Music]
grip tux excellent okay
oh there's no blue on this
yellow one pretty quickly
this is
something here
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
okay
this one is well there you go
but that one is going to be tricky on
that other Russian
yep there you go
[Music]
nope
[Music]
at least I don't have any lives or
anything like that
[Music]
nice nice
[Music]
let's take out this one here first
then we can take out the other one
anything now
[Music]
uh
I'm sorry please
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
there we go
[Music]
perfect
[Music]
now I just need to take out the last one
now I've got come on
there you go I did it oh that was scary
spider pose four but that's Square done
it's only one and last 11.
let's start
dining somewhere
[Music]
let's start to return the important
awesome
[Music]
[Music]
a pepper anyway
[Music]
it's just the same as the other one but
now we're going towards the right
anything
[Music]
[Music]
very empty lemon
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
with time but
you can fit through
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
might be interesting
[Music]
level
I mean look at this time it has to be
friends when it is defined on level
um
[Music]
it doesn't seem to be
[Music]
getting much of a challenge okay
I say yes
she shot at
[Music]
um
Run Shooting
wait no okay
[Music]
don't worry spiral tank
[Music]
all right
I can't get anything more
no more mistakes well I almost made a
mistake there
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
I'm fat
get out of my way yes
look at this year 130 James yeah I want
a training card spider pose five and
that is the star
so now
let's see if I can find the
[Music]
portal where's the place to be important
[Music]
thank you down here instead
[Music]
I actually don't know my important is
spice or is it over here oh there it is
now
[Music]
the professor has to say now
you need to defeat All or defeat all of
the mini games three times in order to
open this portal and put the lips open
now I mean take parts
[Music]
would be like I've been here before
I'm not
but generally feels like I'm
[Music]
let me again track
levels pick tag that seems like a chunk
of chocolate that is easy
[Laughter]
[Music]
it can be 50 gems and a 110. that seems
like a bad deal
hahaha
evicted gems we have a tug of war if you
lose this you lose I'll keep the 50 gems
if you win I'll keep the 50 gems but
that's what you attend
[Music]
to be fair you can do it again and then
get twenties
Thirty and they forget 65 percent
[Music]
so you don't have to pay for the mixer
very easy
[Music]
hello my name is
do you care about
oh I need to get up there oh yeah I did
it
take the flick no no ah
one of these I just realized which I
wish it was simply based on the name
I love you
why have the worst mini game as part of
the final round
[Music]
okay so I need one
I guess that works
[Music]
I don't even know what happens when you
can't think they get all the way down to
your line
[Music]
oh I can't touch them
I see
[Music]
step
what happened last time when I
not all boils
but not all of the balls fell off the
level did I hit an enemy because I came
too far down
[Music]
thank you
it can happen I don't think that
happened today couldn't have been what's
happening
[Music]
but as far as I remember
what levels only makes the ball
faster
[Music]
it doesn't actually
oh
it still doesn't even test animation
even though I already won
yes
I wanted to worry about that and that's
a win
[Music]
spider pose AIDS there's other parts of
my poses
well and then I'll just have to do it
with a cookie bar but as far as I can if
I'm nothing wrong with me
the enemies don't actually move quickly
[Music]
wow nice nice
oh everyone did it so nicely
but then I messed up this isn't even the
hardest level yet so that means that
um
[Music]
we get more time
bottom
[Music]
one
[Music]
hence
[Music]
the thing moves so quickly
really is what's really means speaking
[Music]
the platform section if you just want to
turn around
what you have to do if you want to use
the flame
it's just a little it moves a bit
completely
and in this
when you press the button it does a
little
it starts moving around it quickly but
then it slows down it has like inertia
built into it but only when it slows
down if you just head add that a slight
acceleration
[Music]
I would make a nice movements
sometimes you just goes stream and enemy
[Music]
oh nice nice the the that was really
nice
hello and then hopefully I don't need to
do any more of these ever again
they don't look okay it's just the ball
going quickly
does mean that
okay
you don't wasting as much time
[Music]
almost everything almost the whole
screen was cleaning I have off after
after all of that
standing out over my waist
[Music]
spread the hair to drop you I dropped
the bone
thank you
[Music]
no all right you have this harder ball
below
[Music]
all right
okay
[Music]
oh there we go
wow no
take it easy I did it
oh
that means no more Deep Thoughts man no
more bones for me but hopefully there's
no proof that they might be eating
requirement
this is the end what does crash out say
let's do this spirumi
[Music]
is
Square Skywalker
[Music]
nice start
[Music]
wow
this must be level one
[Music]
and
I'm already struggling
[Music]
okay
one for now
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
all right
[Music]
again I didn't want to do that I want
the cheaper trying
and this is
yes okay so I had a choice of getting
shots
I didn't have anything to shoot me
okay this is level one
and it's already giving me a challenge
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
fella
[Music]
okay I can't take any more damage I
can't
let's just get started
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
press the wrong button
that is of course my fault nothing game
before
[Music]
wow
[Music]
there's a little too long
[Music]
I don't have anything shooting and I had
no ground to stand on
what
as far as I could see there was no
ground ground to stand on and it just
sent me 10
anime at me
without giving me agenda that
[Music]
nothing
damage
[Music]
and this is level one
I can't wait to see what level two is
like
then of course oh come on
avoided that
[Music]
oh it's so picky
really
[Music]
so kicking
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
all right that wasn't supposed to shoot
can't
I didn't shoot well I don't think
I said it again get shot
[Music]
and that's that's a great options
to be honest
foreign
[Music]
another one
another one
[Music]
I really want to make sure you dance
I wish I could hold more than one man
[Music]
all right
[Music]
well again what am I supposed to do
I'm really trying to wait out that one
don't make this one level easy
it's very unfair all of a sudden
the game was the game was tricky
annoying
DDS and whatever
[Music]
haven't been unfair I guess because it
controls properly maybe I can't stop
being a fan before
this level is really
it really pushes down
come on some picky
yeah why are you so picky
I heard it flipping sound but I guess I
press the tuning
no
not [ __ ]
[Music]
in that part I'm not changed yet
Infinity oh
[Music]
come on
few things
[Music]
I'm shooting me
[Music]
oh I can't do that
okay come on
[Music]
that again
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
do that
and if it what what
[Music]
I'm getting confused
they're really touchy
oh a nice picture
I don't know just
now it just goes
and
[Music]
what how
you're not supposed to work be able to
walk up those
what
when you are able to well I what what
[Music]
you need some some new ruling game that
I didn't know about
yeah
you can't walk out from things
[Music]
but you can walk up them if you're
upside down
[Music]
[Music]
yeah this
this level really takes the energy
[Music]
[Music]
thank you foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
this is the new
base age Speedway
oh my
why is it giving me his
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
okay okay
what
oh my game come on this isn't fast
[Music]
I can't forget
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
I think I know what the reason is but
it's very technical
it's because they always allow you to
fall down
as an action down on the screen
and they haven't taken any consistent
situation if you're upside down or not
as you guys pause that before yep
[Music]
do not and that's any less
I'm saying
I had nothing to shoot with there is
that thing I can oh my and this is this
is the level one is the difficult
the difficulty is definitely has
increased so much
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
like that
I can't see I can't see what the other
side of level looks like
um
how am I going to make the correct moves
if I can't pee
the ground I'm going to
[Music]
remind SPF uh fan made Flash game
someone made a crash
where in one Hospital
and
[Music]
the boss is throwing random boxes
basically metal crates uh or TNT 20
something
and you're supposed to spin
the method crates to spin it back
but but you're not supposed to spin the
spin the TNT because of course the team
Plus
but this row is very quick and that's
the only thing you have to react to you
have to end this what is being shown Is
Random so it's just a guessing he
but that was a fun game
[Music]
with this game
oh I wasn't paying attention because I'm
starting to get tired
okay
never so bad
I didn't see that how am I supposed to
see that now I'm complaining about 11.
it's a kiss
it's so bad
everything else people are complaining
about prior to this level
nothing compared to what this level is
supposed to do
[Music]
the way you can only hold one rocket and
they had to pick it up
I mean okay sure sure there is a
platform there but I can't see it I
don't know where it is I had to guess
and if I guess wrong it came over
because the things that can
[Music]
shut down
[Music]
yeah I had nothing to shoot me
hey shut the early game away I mean
we stand in that picture
I mean and I wanted to try to just do
this without taking any damage that
doesn't matter because there are
inspected parts that I have to guess
where to land
and I don't even know at the end of 11
looks like
I haven't gotten that point
again
and suggesting damage then because
that's okay
they didn't see that one
was I able to see that I had no idea
I wasn't paying full attention as I'm
tired
[Music]
um
this level is really draining that my
energy
[Music]
okay this
ah
give me a moment
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
okay
[Music]
eating something
chicken short break
[Music]
detergent for the stuff
my fresh mine
I should be able to do this
oh it's starting not starting up
particularly
[Music]
oh yeah
okay I wasn't supposed to shoot the
first one
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
but then I don't have anything to shoot
left on it
[Music]
[Music]
walking up here
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
all right
[Music]
okay so I need that one but it's so
tricky to get him
oh
why did you manage it
exit I finally did I guess that helped
to get me some rest and then I did it
[Music]
you like two attempts or something
well but I still have 15 more times
[Music]
at least
at least it did show me that I got far
I wasn't too
good night
[Music]
[Music]
like when I feel failed before I was
very close to the exit sir it didn't
require too much more of me or I could
between
[Music]
I was trying to
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
okay next is she
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
I think way too much damage that starts
this is going the other way around you
can barely see that on screen
[Music]
ah
there was one again was it even on
screen can I even
Fair
[Music]
hello
damage
[Music]
I guess it's a bit memorization so
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
it is going to this one is safe
[Music]
okay the crumbs one there and then
but then I can't do anything about that
one
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and I have to wait there
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
excuse me
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
what is that then
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
like that
enough
[Music]
I was ever supposed to avoid that
[Music]
huh
[Music]
[Music]
black kitten
we're on a game yeah I know
it is
something indeed
[Music]
but it wasn't too hard I guess but I
still have to do it one more time
[Music]
let's see if we can do dessert variant
all right
almost easier honestly
almost awesome
yeah because
basically it throws much more enemies at
me and it constantly gives me things to
shoot with so it's less of a person I'm
more like I basically have to shoot
everything and pick up anything
it's much more straightforward now
which technically makes it easier
[Music]
I didn't have to shoot that one but it
doesn't matter because it gets what a
new missile immediately
it's no longer a puzzle it's just a
shooter
whoa whoa whoa
I'll take that back
thank you
I have my lunch break now oh nice
having a nice lunch
break it's fun
I'm saying
no
[Music]
important feeling strange games
I will defeat this game
I'm gonna break it
laughs
[Music]
well she's too quickly there
I'm just screaming yeah
and then where's this section where they
all of a sudden since all of these
[Music]
damn
scientists thank you
hey
well well I guess that worked
I don't have any dishes with it
I missed it to me size they had to me so
if I miss both
[Music]
and to music is kind of about to want
more like the crankings that allowed
here
[Music]
I need that
[Music]
what is this
[Music]
now it's much better for him it sounds
like it's someone here they have metal
trash again maybe that's how they
recorded it
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
okay I kind of have figured out
everything here
just need to be further foreign
[Music]
[Music]
again I can't see the platforms I don't
know when I where how
it's so unfair and it's insta-kill too
because you fall off the lemon
foreign
level and then insta kill
[Music]
there's nothing more relaxing than the
high school scientist
they're here I mean I guess I could just
[Music]
all right
[Music]
I just take damage but
[Music]
[Music]
okay how about this then
that worked
[Music]
fine
[Music]
this pixel anyway
painting it thank you
[Music]
space change tell us when I sure want
that one
after all that work
oh this guy's done there only the
triangle and second left yay
no my
[Music]
no need to get up here
[Music]
doing that
[Music]
at least this one is so much or black
ones I haven't seen these in ages
[Music]
so much more relaxing this this one
comparison I'd like to see stuff
that I do wish it was a bit more zoomed
out okay
well now it definitely in space
Bang
[Music]
oops
[Music]
a nice space uh back back from space
[Music]
drag into space again
foreign
[Music]
okay
[Music]
um
speaking in space
[Music]
[Music]
there's quite a difference between
failing and challenge in this case to
come straight to all the games whenever
when I failed here it's like
such such a bad feeling
[Music]
the whole level from the beginning
[Music]
come on I tried to avoid it
[Music]
back here
[Music]
and go
I crashed into going but it didn't count
oh if I just had one hit point left
over there made it
[Music]
okay there we go
try it
I am phase one better
shame
yeah that was so stupid
[Music]
it's traveling to space twice I think
yeah they are
stopped taking damage
and then here
this green black stripes which is an
interesting combination and marks where
the walls are but it also marks where
space beneath it makes it kind of look
like
there you go
you did it the triangle has been
completed
but I have today too more times let's
just say basically the same level just
one hands on the stuff
thank you
[Music]
meaning
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
you could be somewhere here
yes
and then I just
[Music]
well at least they don't have any
like this stuff
and then I just need to get to this area
[Music]
thank you
and then
yeah
foreign
[Music]
yeah those are beautiful
[Music]
can we show our heads animated ones
right there
of course
[Music]
there are other things I wish for more
than just animated in English that are
bad kids but that kind of more important
at the moment
[Music]
and
oh spinny things
[Music]
okay this size doesn't seem to be
difficult
more easier easier
[Music]
first time I got hit by something
ah come on I'm a little Diagon I mean
that's that's funny
okay destroy me
[Music]
[Music]
I know what time once oh
maybe I can help you with that
[Music]
okay I forgot to fly into the space
station again
[Music]
okay
can I keep messing up here
[Music]
now keep to the right side then
spinning things
[Music]
[Music]
there we go
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
that means that is only a circle left
and portal Rush 100 gems I don't think
so
[Music]
[Music]
but here it is
gravity well
knock them off okay do you think I can
do this again without moving the only
time I moved what I said wasn't in the
game was cheating it's only one time
[Music]
foreign
can I do it again
[Music]
well and this last time
knock him off
oh they actually got me on off first
time I lost these
anyone
[Music]
crushing confidence man and that's the
circle that means that I have completed
every each of these levels three times
as well
[Music]
oh that's back
[Music]
how much further no okay so I can't feel
further down I'm not sure how I should
probably supposed to know that but
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
all right
what are in here anymore
[Music]
I don't know
maybe they have changed the roots
regarding towns where it works
anyway
[Music]
nice gaming the voice actor put that
lots of working today
an action for spelling
[Music]
myself
[Music]
[Music]
oh
wow thank you damage
thank you
[Music]
how am I hey
thank you
[Music]
the only the only confusing part is how
do I get to
[Music]
that's one it's very hard
[Music]
I said it's like one left there comes
with it there you go
thank you
can't reach it
why is there a time limit
[Music]
yeah it wasn't a time limit
this might have been more fun
foreign
[Music]
hopefully we won't be hearing from those
two again
thanks for all the help trash
while we see you around Spyro
you can count on it
credits
[Music]
here we go I think that's all the people
who've made
the game
[Music]
because they didn't do it
the program positioned next
[Music]
thank you
play testers have a oh it's empty enough
Travis Blank then
[Music]
um okay
[Music]
all right
[Music]
that's like 20 people who play test the
game
yeah Digital model what did they play
test
you're amazing oh
kitten
yeah did I
I don't have an average training card
yet I still got like 25 minutes left
then to stream
[Music]
so I guess I'll try to get the final
cards
[Music]
um
this is going to go on and on
Matthew gay
I can't actually make the credit score
quick I can't skip this guys but I can't
wait to scroll quickly if only I knew
that
booklet
quality assurance
nothing there was not a single person on
the quality assurance
more testers I think it's looping
but he can't
now these are different people
[Music]
I assume the conditions was like the
major heading and then you have the
subheading but it looks more fun but
there are no competitions for this game
that's me um yes thank you
you have one hand to James
or nothing
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
at this level and I'm sure
maybe I have
maybe you don't get a card getting every
gem in this level
[Music]
the next thing is I still don't want to
go back there
[Music]
I guess I
this is like a oh such a
such a slow cursor
I guess this is a Guaranty way to get
cards for 100 each
other
it will be three hours but yeah
[Music]
foreign
46 gems
I don't want to schedule over 100 GM
secret Cathy gem
let me test that
now I got 90 I lost 10 on that thank you
money bye thank you
literally told me how much the gem was
worth
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I know there anymore well
that's
all this stuff those one
positive
first three post four okay close by oh
six all the kids sitting down I got them
so seven in both eight
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
okay here's the idea of getting all
these party cards in this game and then
transferring all the expired cards over
to the trash game
[Music]
I love the flip that's the worst team
oh there it is wondering
cameras now thank you
[Music]
what
happened
foreign
[Music]
no
okay
[Music]
I don't think so wasting
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
so bad at finding levels
[Music]
thank you
yes this is the one
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
although I do have to
yeah this will be the remain outstream
anything else going on
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
oh wow
[Music]
nothing much
well
foreign
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
hey showing ads in the meantime
[Music]
well and gets this early
[Music]
not that is
perfect 11th Street
[Music]
so I could go with a different money
back stuff
which isn't as expensive
[Music]
two minutes left
oh yes we have it so
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
I hope you remember that one thing I
can't teach today well it's not well
well
alternative
oh kitten
I'll have to take a look at that after
after this game
[Music]
said he said and see see
what happens
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
one minute left on the edge
[Music]
[Laughter]
here I can't be the only one who thinks
the spider is very dark hunting guys
probably not differently not alone in
bed
he's he has actually been animated
quite adorable in this game the only age
I have with the game is that they are
basically
taking 3D models and crush them down to
these Sprites instead of actually they
could still have used like a 3D model as
the base they really should have gotten
an artist that's why you can see the
shading on spiders flicking so much
because it's not optimized
but yeah they should have gotten some
um
bright artist a pixel pixel artist to
actually
create these
as pixel art to be actually used in
front again looks like a puppy
well he's meant to be designed based
like Cassidy so Anthony everyone is back
[Music]
I didn't manage to get uh 900 still
during the day
I win
[Music]
okay since all right let's go
[Music]
let's be a week back
Fitness on the way back

[Music]
maybe I need to take that portal then

foreign
[Music]
[Music]
again
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
you're getting a feeling that there is
not
going to
[Music]
and this
oh my goodness
[Music]
let's spin the wheel yeah
right they're using a different meter
here
this this one right then what's Max I
forgot what is that um
I gems that wasn't that great
and minimum and back back one step okay
good
yeah
[Music]
I like about 15 P.M
okay now I should pick this one I think

foreign
cards
[Music]
well this one gems about nothing
is that the gym someone

[Music]
as far as parties in his team
after some reason I managed to get the
orange
everyone
oh I'm not beginning
I ate this
I mean it is a loss
hooray you want eight I mean you pay ten
but you won eight
only seven fourteen
maybe he's better than
[Music]
figures came out
like the crash one
[Music]
there we go right today get the same
over and over
[Music]
all right
[Music]
this is like I'm getting the same over
and over
[Music]
[Music]
uh it's on the pizza lights
foreign
[Music]
each
okay
I really I still haven't learned this
one
[Music]
so I put your thing
[Music]
thank you
so if I do that
[Music]
thank you okay
so a little bit less and I get the
purple yes
perfect
I need to do more
[Music]
now I should
there we go
I figured the game out
and now I don't get it
[Music]
they're not cheating again
foreign
[Music]
rest
now it almost feels like I got every
card
[Music]
doesn't feel like he's giving you one
more time
[Music]
move on from this area
[Music]
and to the Arctic plate
and there should be a stroke here too
[Music]
and I should know what to do
shops are one is here
crystallized Dragon 3 I'll take that
which I'm going to you want to take that
too
I'm Gonna Change
and I guess I got everything now
also are the crosstalk cars crash cars
in his company didn't really not have
crossed that crash anchors of spider
first
those are across that crash coins right
[Music]
and now
think that what you can determine is and
that is this crosstalk crash car is
because you see the black in the middle
middle that's what appears on there
the crash cards is eyebrows there's no
black one Malaysian black eye but it's
not in this shape
that's these crosses okay and now let's
do them many many times from this normal
cars
[Music]
no more cards
thank you
[Music]
so let's just
we're going to the next area
[Music]
although of course
[Music]
it is already
four o'clock
I think 19 o'clock here
[Music]
so I think it took the wrong route
[Music]
anyway base Shuffle okay
iron box
item boxes that only only I have
three box
es
okay I actually didn't have that one
spring okay it feels like
spider game there's
Matchbox crash cards
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I mean I got almost everything here
these things are missing
and these I might be able to purchase in
their motorbike shop
these actually no others are probably
winning in motorbike shops as well
these I actually don't know where do I
get these from
these two
and one of these must be
[Music]
the one of the last gem in that world I
haven't gotten yet
170
[Music]
but I don't get I haven't not gotten all
all the cards here or kittens
