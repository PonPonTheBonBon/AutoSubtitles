timer I think would be
fair let me adjust the position there so
I can see
because yeah I going to got
38 so if I go back down to the
bottom I can see how many gems are
missing I like clear out those
first
[Music]
I can't get further
down so
here everything's cleared out nice
nice hi
[Music]
po yeah and then then red might get a
chance to do the take part of the
prediction everything is cleared
here I think
some oh here we go there's a level what
was what did that
[Music]
level
H it's a box to jam but somehow I
managed to miss
boxes did I means like a sacred pass or
like a bonus or
something great
start okay
so oh no that's not
how get
away I'm in a hurry something is chasing
me I know I'm not
oh nice that's that's how get past this
now I try to
jump
okay
like
like there's a bonus did I just not do
the bonus or
something I think I need this
bonus oh that
was are secret boxes
somewhere like in another
bonus
no
wind
okay 22 well I'll continue and see
what what's going on
here
who oh
oh oh I
died that means no gem for
me I I I'll continue to level and
see what I'm
missing then I'll just have to do it
without
dying okay the bir took that box
good
okay
oops died
again
well
guess good practice on the levels I know
how to
W that came out
surpr this is the end of 11 got
38 there like 20 more
boxes I didn't mean that I meant to
[Music]
jump
what it game I can
experiment yeah I think I went back and
like there we go that's what I wanted
did the bear here
but that doesn't really give me 20 boxes
why
are why doesn't the jump work
sometimes I hope everyone is doing
okay crash is flicking all over the
screen
why is the jump not working sometimes
what am I doing am I
just everything went fine
yesterday okay now me messing
up I guess I've been messing up all this
time falling down
holes not for doing proper
chams what say
Skip
hello yes this is the polar bear

there I'm going to try I'm going to
try
go he

like Corner not sure why like why I got
that
feeling what makes me think
that
yeah this strange feeling I
have yeah there's an invisible one there
okay so I'm not allowed to go back go
back there what there I missing
then
yeah I'm okay that's
good for some reason I feel like there's
some some other stupid thing in slamon
let me
check yeah and when the prediction is up
or the timer is up I will go a battle
cortex
so take part in the if you want it's
only for
fun nothing to say
is the more people take part of it the
funnier funner the more fun it
is okay because I have one idea here or
a
secret
and because there's one special moment
whoop this
level it is
here this is the only place where
you
y why 34
94 there's a big this we can jump down
and get to the other boxes
hello I mean I do prefer you're not just
telling me what to do I mean I just did
it but you
know you
[Music]
know oh no box there anyway
so again some
second ah I could just jump up there
yeah should be able to get up here
again yes there
well oh oh
no pressing the wrong button
all oh why
okay I guess I'll practice this level or
[Music]
something okay that's not
do that's not how you
doing
let me activate
this then I can get
that I try to jump out
it righty
to that's what I'm
doing wh no that one is a bit annoying
there uhuh
Aha and then I can
also Sports F that's a good
one hello red are you back take part of
before it runs

round yes yes dropped 10,000 on the
prediction nice nice
nice Jordan Kitty hello welcome back
than you Jan I hope you have a good time
take part don't miss out on a
prediction just reminding everyone about
this prediction it's going to be a big
and great
prediction and as usual if if there's no
winner after the prediction is well
after done what the prediction says H
all points will be
refunded
who and it's
SP
W and let's see how
the how well I
do I jumping on every mind oh speaking
of jumping every
mind then I
continue spine jump spine
jump I believe thank you
Jordan nice to see people actually
believe me in
me but I'm not just fake
bunny but I do not take any offense to
not believing in me I mean otherwise I
wouldn't do the prediction in first
place if I I was upset that people
didn't leave
me come
on that's just
shud I I lost my
mask oh
my this going to take a few attempt is
this hard
than okay you know
what I got to give you I'm going to use
the tools the game g game game gives
me because the game gives me the tools I
will use the
tools I just wish I could run okay
only need to do it seven
times why is how many times I've like
done it before be sling down the hole
down the
hole just what you like
88
good thing I only
losing
94 100 how much
that that's
47s
50s 47 50 of life every
time go am I not allowed to have masks
on this level maybe I'm not allowed to
have masks on this
level I take this as an I'm not allowed
to have masks on this level
oh rude of the game to do
that
one I could have just I don't know is it
EAS because you're not they like why why
are not allowed to have M on this level
I guess that's a tool I'm not giv being
given then yeah this very slow now even
though it wasn't the
[Music]
bar but
um
no
but um yeah because like oh you can't
use because if you get hit by the bear
you only take damage and survive and
then then the game something I don't
know the make
like Crush 2 is one of the weird Crush
things
oh the timer is almost up put your final
predictions before the timer is up 7
seconds left 1 minute left I me ah so a
bit more than 3 seconds left
but final moments before the prediction
is
up
no 40 seconds
left
oh 30
seconds
only a few seconds
left let see if I
[Music]
can 3 2
1 the timer is up Ear I can just make it
longer but oh well
start me is a long time
but and didn't start the prediction at
the start of countown that means 20
minutes into the dream
itself
okay I'm fully back now and on my PC
hello
red
comy I don't know how many has have
predicted it only shows up in the
chat oh my you know what let's go f
CeX
and I want to I need a a manual way of
tracking first and automatic way of
tracking first I me
[Music]
see but there we go the first has been
you are first
first tried to get it but had issues on
the phone
for it's acting weird okay let's do
this crash versus
CeX come on come on come
on come on come on come on
I'm not doing so great oh he's quick no
I thought that was close enough oh
no not anything
oh yeah I'm not doing so at just do need
to
[Music]
be I'm not doing great on this
level
like what's the context here FR game
cortex all 25 crystals and now cortex is
fleeing with
them and they have like a cut scene or
something oh I can
yeah oh
well that was one F yeah I'm not doing
great on this
I'm already not doing great on jet pack
levels
and not so well on this like how are we
supposed to get Clos in there we
[Music]
go
and now it's super easy okay
now jinx it for myself come on get out
of the way stupid things I'm trying to
catch
cortex no you're not
touching
[Laughter]
[Music]
Wow Come on move forward I'm holding the
button crashes takes damage from
nothing well I guess
see the missing cut scene is
when cortex uh does
his cortex Vortex and
then then slaves
crash and then that SP crash loses a
life and that's what they
missing there we
go no no you haven't seen a Last of Me
Crush
Bandicoot
things then sometimes that's very hard
sometimes that
e crash what are you supposed happen to
Cortex and what about the cortex Vortex
what about
Forex he still up
there you got it this time don't lose my
10,000 points please no no they won't be
lost regardless of what
happens red you want
red defends
come part participate oh we got actually
six people
nice and you won for once
red
congratulations
part I also got a lot of followers
today before I start
streaming see any followers from there
rain yesterday and three new followers
just this morning that's five new
followers
since between the end of last stream to
the start of this
stream GG other
participants 3,000 a bit more 3,000 90
points goes to Red congratulations red
you did good this time
good
good that was
exciting but of course there
are th gems to
collect plenty of GS to
col
so I'm I'm planning on on completing
this game today what should I play next
time or I guess crash 3
[Music]
PS1 but should then also do some kind of
challenge in that
one or the same challenge
Maybe
[Music]
R let's go back to level
[Music]
15 and see if I can do it this
time unbearable this level is unbearable
oh no it does reset the desk C or the
lemon game thinks I'm good
again just give me a mask that that
would make this J a bit
easier oh no uh apparently it was very
quick at the start did just the game me
realized wait a minute the the the the
polar was supposed to be
slow
no
oh
but then when I finally completed this H
section then I have to complete the rest
of the PO
level
oh I only need six more
followers and then I achiev my goal of
277
followers
h y y
y so uh red how does it feel to
be getting back that tiny amount of all
the points you have predicted with top
five it would be fun if they had uh
and I guess it's too late for me to do
it now and do have information about how
many points you have with in total and
how many points I have won in
total
like and of course the total predict
minus toal one is how much she
lost so you have a plus
minus I do this now be too
hard yeah
between what that
here
this section's being quite
tricky okay doing good so far now I
shouldn't say
that
d when I get the bouse back here
so need to care about
you wonder that
mask get bad
timing this is time I go for don't lag
on me
game
oh
oh let me see if I
can I should have picked up the
MK
can't pick up oh yeah yeah that's a
thing you can do in this game they they
do not allow to do inide game they love
you to do first
game my issues with this
[Music]
game next I
oh we can that gun
that I did not bounce off
that kind of question that happens
too there's a hole in the fruits there
but it does not go through
it
I guess it really shows the Polish of
this
game you can't just do that I didn't
need to make it so
complicated and oh yeah that's one of
those you could get a
bounc which you don't need then I get
another mask there it's so
long and here's the platform where does
this bring me up from the hole I think
yes oh explos rest okay
good okay let's see if I can do it this
time and the sport bar timer is
up times it will take me
to complete
this well as long as I don't pick up a
checkpoint 76
likes
and I was 99 when I
started oh
yeah I did not pay attention to where I
was okay the kind of SL jump I'm kind of
bad at
it even is quite lenient about how you
can do
it
I should definitely be able
to yeah I
think i' argue this level is harder than
cold hard Quest
I'm say basically every level behaving
unbearable they are
challenge C hard crash
[Music]
easyy py
show my shooting at the one and you're
standing and shooting at
nothing okay so
spin
there we
go now I get mosque number
two and if I get to manage to get
through and keeping
this
no stupid controls I do not remember
crash one being
this like
this in Crash to when you turn around
around there's there's a slight delay
before he actually turns around it
doesn't
it I don't remember CR one being like
that let me yes I lose the two much when
I get up
okay no I keep them
nice so hopefully I gotam
Bo so a hard segment went
done but I guess
the this one
done
4 I returned with a sausage and bacon
sandwich
sounds
nice oh yeah and then you lose them when
the section start and I immediately fail
I have to restart from the
beginning
I the very first ho just just
immediately
FS oh oh oh
[Music]
no all of that work
G
such such b i
Am
actually just die at bar seven times to
make it
slower
so you got uh what kind of sausage do
you have in your
sandwich a fly in my
face
B yeah you like them B don't
you again stupid crash two
controls maybe it was the same in crush
one but I didn't feel like I was
affected by it too much I think it's
affecting me more in crush 2 because the
platforming is like more requires more
from me
I have no
[Music]
comment I think you should comment on
it
I want to hear every juicy
deta up bles he
p
I really can't jump down Prett
early I don't have to worry much about
that point
point
oh in front of
me should have G
there land to
CL how much space to
land this is quite a tough challenge
he and I'm not doing so well on
it
oops not at this level is not too
long
goodbye that
one ni get up
there but I can probably get yeah from
here
yep I don't have to worry about that it
just take a bit longer to
do jump completely wrong
there it's not like I need to mask oh
wait
there
go
I could probably have gone previous time
but I'm not taken any
risks where's the
bullet
second
but I was
spinning but I was
[Music]
spinning well at least I get to
keep getting on the
M oh oh oh yeah this time they're too
tall
hey is here welcome you miss the whole
prediction by the
way can I guess guess who or is who who
is singular and plur right
guess who won the prediction I figured I
would yeah s it's only 30 minutes cuz I
was doing this level
before while predition was counting down
I'm still not done with this level so I
would they have did the cortex level
just to finish off the prediction and
then I'm back at this level again wonder
why just continue this level if they
come down was
long I would say red
dragon yes you are correct red one
finally oh my Miss messing up
this I'm Ming up this this is is bad I
only got four more gems is this level
and then it's probably there like two
secret levels and one more level
this challengeing me this hard this is
harder this is very hard this is one
I this is the one I'm struggling with
most at
moment I got rid of everything
thank you bear for removing the
rest there you go get my GL last back
[Music]

follow they die if you go too far away
what's
say pon pon is a bunny who doesn't wear
so definitely

us name otherwise I won't be able to
remember nickn names and also it might
be confusing for other people who I'm
talking about and like what would you
niy or
like maybe sock that that could work
too not hard to say and it's Unique
too
be cool to be a bit careful
here
Bo that wasn't too careful but it
work that was that that is what counts
if it

mask
some reason when you get up
here no no no
no oh my oh
my keep keep messing
up at least it's quick to restart at
least I'm back did you change your
avatar outfit so was it like this before
maybe I'm remember yeah it's it was like
this every since you watch your first
message it's been the thinging of hat on
stream Rocket Man one welcome Rocket Man
no dreams the outfit has
changed wouldn't be weird if I had this
outfit the whole day though and you
didn't
realize rocket
boy I hope
yeah everything went all right Rocket
Man you
were last time I saw you but I
hope yeah here no it's understandable
it's it's fine it's fine you are not o
obliged you have no obligation there we
go changing the freezing to be here so
you are free to come and go as you like
and you don't have to be sorry about
it I mean it's not
like
Panda got the
star
there a star like you
are it doesn't do anything but it's just
a random
redeemed I'm saying it every time just
to be clear as people don't feel like
they're wasting the points you feel to
redeem it if you want but it doesn't do
anything can I find it in the
description though maybe I
should it doesn't do oh St is
everywhere
alian also got a SC star do you like
your star Adan did you get good star G
Star there is no counter for how many
stars you
got
there we go let's get rid of you cuz
you're
annoying and then I miss jump oh my this
star boy
hyp Mr star
boy almost forgot my star don't worry
and Hello Panda Al hello
me phone always want to spend store for
some
reason well that would not be the Swit
word for Star by the
way but it is the swiish word for
standing so this at least a Swit word
Swedish is just English word which dots
and cir
this I was going to spam the star canot
redem one star yeah it's a it's a one
per stream redeem
per per once per person per stream it
this I mean if it if it actually did
something in that case I would would
have like
multiple I want I want like different
kind of celebrations like or
rman rman have a star rman that many
stars when he's flying out there with
the
Stars I have no idea why my pH would
have switch on the keyboard really
depends on how you set set up the
keyboard I
made it so my keyboard has multiple
languages and then I have a language
switch button which is really convenient
because then I can
just it's very because I usually just
write a single language at the
time then I switch to langage I want to
take very
coming
oh no my
my my face is
itchy
okay okay okay look look at this I'm
doing hey
you're
don't
I still want to spam it I don't care
there
nothing but I wouldn't feel great about
it so I don't I
refuse I
refuse I mean I guess
I'll this star is more like a hello I'm
here I don't know it doesn't mean
anything you can use it for whatever you
want but it's supposed to be like a
unique one time
redeem
regardless oh that's not how we defeat
it doesn't matter well I'm losing all my
mouth I don't know what this star is but
I'll wa with pride you can get one the
next stream or if this stream stops
working again like
yesterday the one star oh sweaty
socks thing socks is
could be challenged to some
people the K St
ending which is a b ending in
Swedish which is why I can say it
tox
okay no not this isn't that CR is
supposed to work not not a brag or
anything you
know
as a half man half rocket it makes me
feel
comy I thought you were like flying in a
rocket not that you were half a
rocket H do you keep track of your Star
Stream nope I don't bonus round bonus
run is
over was a quick bonus round I did it
again he did the exact same thing
again okay you know what
let me practice this
[Music]
then no Bret man is half man half rocket
always has
been to be honest I'm not sure what I am
just depends my me sometimes sometimes
you're a man and Rocket sometimes you're
half a rocket half a man and sometimes
you're leaving
rocket it really
depends
yeah
what
and then there's basically is this
section left which should be the easiest
section cuz they consider the polar bear
to be hard to
ride get this section can give a bit of
trouble but I I will and there we go is
this all boxes this 56 yes it is all
boxes no it isn't obviously not I missed
two box boxes so after all of this work
I still miss two boxes still missing two
boxes so they still still have to find
two boxes somewhere so even if I manage
to complete this this challenge I'm
still going to miss two boxes
somewhere so is your top half a rocket
or is your bottom half a
rocket and didn't try to be Rocket Man
so he's stuck at R rocket into his head
but he didn't but he isn't Rocket Man so
his plan to give himself super powers of
a rocket
fail yeah where like H let's see if I
can find these two
boxes
finished skip two boxes maybe I just
skip two
boxes
maybe I skip the two boxes at the
checkpoint or
something so I collected
box and it doesn't matter if I destroy
them or the bar destroys them it still
counts six boxes at the
moment not there are any boxes here for
the be to Dory
cuz this is down the
section there is invisible one
there top half I'm no use in the game
top half here
man why don't you have any
what
why don't you have any use in the dating
game I mean sure there's probably a lot
of people who wouldn't be like
interested in like a half man half
rocket but they're probably people who
are
there's lot of jumping on
here
okay there we go and
done yeah rocket P why
why I'm
to I'm sorry I don't
speak
sorry I don't speak English what all
matters

beon
go and triple
mask

section okay so it's beenin jump spin no
jump and then run
oh destroy that box please thank
you
slide W I did that I did the wrong order
but I got through and then the find an
easy section which have not failed
on
uh
things last multiple
attempt uh I'm going now
therefore I'm saying that I'm going to
jinx it I'm jinxing the
Jinx and it
worked there we go I did it without
dying W celebration unless someone's
going to say that I did
die
well
yeah you can't go around is very
awkward I wanted to do a victory laugh
but
too many invisible WS
everywhere oh
finally yeah
victory that means
that that was the hard I I'll say that
that was the hardest level so far to get
the box gem
on so I got three levels
left
[Music]
H three more and not box not necessarily
box Dam
but that's one oh yeah I need to find
the which I can do from
here
wait a
minute no no no let's go
to think it's
behaving I think that's the level which
has
the which is the one I'm looking for
Princess P fun I'm very happy there we
go there it is and I have completed cold
crash out that's an easy level in
comparison it's going to like a bit more
and I have
V just check yes there's V if you don't
trust
[Music]
me hope you are behaving and no I'm
not I'm a oh
see or I'm mixing mixing this level up
with other big level but I I'll check
both oh yeah I'm mixing up with the
other one because this one has
G no I didn't about to do
that oh
my
oh my I didn't feel touching I'm
misbehaving I'm really dir jok telling
really dir J on stream yeah you're
you're
very you're very
misbehaving I got this
secret but that's not the secret I'm
looking for so this is the wrong
be
I'm still going to check just in
case it might still be the right one but
I think it's the wrong
one
no doesn't
matter
[Music]
what come
on
we that's why I
wanted I don't need a mask even though I
died
before don't mind that I check quite
nice have got that but no it's maybe I
did
just
oh another checkpoints they're
everywhere jump up jump
up
jump
K definitely not the correct
l
and this is the
level nice jump it's way to easy to just
get stuck on Geometry of the level okay
this isn't the level I was looking
for a White Horse rolled around in mud
the
end is the white
horse horse version of pon
[Music]
pon plant food that must be the one I'm
looking
for since I have the emote which is the
bunny version of P my P bun is already
bunny but the emote is the one where pon
pon is a par rabbit this is not even the
correct LEL this is not the correct
theme
even just a horse that rolled around in
mud okay so I should
go mean this doesn't seem
[Music]
right
[Music]
crush crush that one looking for a White
Rabbit roll in feces Oh Oh
My no this is not the
one yeah I'm not too experienced with
crash to
that means
poop
yeah tell me more about
it should
be
heing that must
spe that must spe Lev was actually
looking
for p
yes this is
L you see this level is called ding it
because
[Music]
it's I don't know the
speed W of
speed
you see this level is called D it
because this level allows you to dig on
the
ground as you can see and the other
level is called the be heavy because
that one features
B I mean other one that's spe
pie be
F but I do not
see what SL like
that
I don't see an option to dig on ground
here I don't actually see any a be
so here we go oh no I haveen died but I
haven't
died here we are here's the
Beast this level could have been called
behaving because it has
bees the other level could have called D
it because that level actually fees
ding so now my memory of the two names
basically okay I should digging it just
takes quite a while for okay fair enough
I'll take I take what I said
back
how long is it
to what I
miss yeah there it
is there we
go P are solid or semi remain of there's
Ro too there now I can get the RO okay H
that was not digested in small intestine
and has been broken down by bacteria in
the L int contains a small amount of
metabolic waste products such
as
uh uh this this bacterially altered
B ruin B Robin and there the Epal cell
Epal El from the Ning after God very
interesting okay man is that something
you knew about and is this an original
text by
you I mean being a rocket man I I assume
you're are very well versed in all types
of science because that's what people
believe years welcome the real Panda and
not that fake panda
alime Honey B P
pan let's
continue St took that straight from
Wikipedia I'm not just some [ __ ] Guru
well you never know I'm not going
to soon
things maybe you're just that well burs
in
[ __ ]
you
know might be your
thing and there we go back to normal
level and I suppose there wasn't
anything behind
me it's real to
me everything is not real just saying
I
mean is kind of high quality plus if you
go to some other
encyclopedia Pages you can find on the
internet which should be considered like
high quality they contain errors and
such too
so so some of the high rated uh web
pages you can find on Google when you're
searching of course you can you should
Google eh I should not take that part it
contains errors while it is not errors
on so so there you
go nothing say it's
perfect there are errors in a lot
places you think people would do that go
inter get the end
[Music]
line do you believe in the
man who lives who lives on Dr
Lane I did not know about the muffin
man
bonuses
my
that's easy
SpongeBob is this a SpongeBob reference
in that case I do not know about
it cuz I don't know much about
SpongeBob other than him being
a one the kitchen sponge and that he the
Swedish name translated to English
becomes SpongeBob
square or if you want mushroom Bo
because there's no distinction between
sponge and
mushroom Oh I thought we were making a
Shrek
reference
uncultured
what
I
it I messed up I'm actually down to
watch this trick movie again maybe
should let's
watch all three St
movies a sponge knob a square n oh
Rocket
Man a very funny
J
[Music]
I get
everything yes without dying far I
know I'm prepared to the entire movie
from start to finish maybe don't do
that that would be unbearable
so two more Al those the two gs in the
[Music]
[Music]
secret let's
[Music]
see I think the easiest way to get to
the secret down
here
you need to jump off it I I I'm glad
they changed the buttons to navigate
this in the remake I having separate up
and down
buttons so you can just walk off
it sorry too late no it's not too late
you can just not do it you know going
get every on away okay I mean not
okay
why is that jump so hard to
make whoa double
Mar can I jump over here
yes here we go I need well I technically
kind of can do it with
this I waste
out just die it's probably quick but
waste of
life there we go that's way to
it some what this isn't like like quotes
from Shrek this is just a
song can I save and load from
here want
see we see it works H after fail the
challenge so somebody want told me words
roll me I the sharpest to in the shade
yeah I'm missing this
[Music]
G she was looking kind of down with her
finger th in the shape of an A and a
forehead good rest this his soul it's
the song that plays at the beginning of
Shrek I know that but like it's not like
original Shrek and something
okay this is going to be a hard
challenge
because if I die I have to
quit and start over that wasn't boost
and I
play will never forget what you
[Music]
said thought L my blood is now
[Music]
yeah we not talking about room here even
though really thing is even to me it
always says that the anoun says
R but
um I do know it is supposed to
be you know how to do this
here we go and then I should go on left
side of that
thing I will practice this
level also hi
hello so let's see I go here I jump
here and after I
destroy these pleas I miss one I jump
like this yeah that's how I
do and I can take
that and then I got under oops almost
fell down and watch out for those and
then I should speed over but that was
fine and I just make sure to don't
double jump next
time then so quick jumps but not too
many
jumps can when I personally who
shouldn't say what can do NSF and one
wait
nsft not save for
transmission NSF PP
not not safe for pon pon okay having pon
pon as my name shorten to PP might not
might have been
unintended I keep doing that
not safe for twe
ah don't worry about
it if it's nsfp it's also NF
NS wait
nsfp here oh it's n of L is it really
that

[Music]
celebrate W
celebration
[Music]
[Music]
okay
so the final
one this
this yeah there's
one first I know
do is that one level I did not do the
secret area of should be this
one
H
where
[ __ ] hey what's there
what's
wait that wasn't that wasn't
the that wasn't the level I said I was
going to now I'm not paying
attention oh wasn't what was it
calling
[Music]
uh
it was similar to
the something
similar I just
try hanging out there we
[Music]
go hello
my gaming day and gaming
stre what's with the
um what's with the
[ __ ] Pap with the wiggly
wolves wiggly
wiggly I do you need a bouncy pon
pon
indeed yeah indeed it's a very
interesting
message I have no problem like swearing
just I choose not to do it myself
but but yeah it's not necess that like
excessive
[Music]
swearing
I couldn't go on there that would been
so
cool that's
definely wait why that done not allowed
I already allowed it
before swings and bad
kurva are you calling me kurva
wolf or is that
for that's fun a to mod pick that up I
mean it does pick up
like verland word
for ver slur for gay people and so I
mean
it seems to trigger on a lot verland is
just a word Play version of French
that's actually not real like language
itself
so I have no
other idea why it would pick it pick up
on that
word oh look at
that if it wasn't because it picked up
on it being a
s
for are you trying to see which words
you can
write this secret every want
to does it pick up Swedish for words
well try
it
as SW is cool I
mean no it
isn't wearing is
immature and this is the only area this
move is used as in lifting up units no
other area in the whole game is this
move I'm not against swearing but I I
feel like when it when it's like
excessive swear swearing which is Cas
sometimes and especially when it's the
same swear over and over again I just
find it
silly cool sometimes I I don't find it
cool at all it doesn't really change the
cool
effect how cool you are does not change
if using
way yeah CL there you go
niome
this one should just have a simple box
SC
right how much backt tracking do I have
to do I going it split past
L is this it's going and why is this oh
it's called totally fly because you have
a flying scene with you it's not like
it's a flying or
something let Crush two doesn't have
flying levels unless you count jetp pack
levels I'll continue your level and see
what you
butet
holding okay TR but I am not sure which
is the most severe I don't want to be
accidentally I mean I don't take offense
if you don't mean if that makes
sense nice
yeah you used the word kurva before and
uh it can be offensive if used in an
offensive
way but of course it can be used in a
non-offensive way and just that's
a me it
means think
it as far as I know an insult to
women H but it is not used back common
name
no yeah so as long as it's not used that
way it's not problems but of course if
it's used that
way then then I would have a problem
with
it well I guess I wouldn't
because
speed pass of this level or you mean
from press
three I mean I'll see what this level
has to offer that's why I'm exploring
it oops true I like to shout it now
instead of it's more fun to
say and and also yeah which is not it's
not proper it should be CL H is more
like of a if more of
a safer version of the action board
which is y
and it's like if you would say freak
instead of Fu that Mak
sense yeah let's ignore those box this
for
now let's see
oh no it's not yeah this is next
one I was
lighting they learned I always use the k
word at work no one knows what it means
so I don't get in trouble
for yeah you should use it I'm holding
down the jump hey I just used a very
offensive Swit
word to son
yeah it's I actually not sure how how
sever that word is H it just means
thousand but it can be used like a
explicative SW Sweden has boring jokes
and Sweden has boring sares Wares isn't
that Ty
sweets there there so how can
I do
it I can't even learn what is
are
annoing okay so there's like one
there okay this is going be
annoying and there's one there maybe
they are after the
mushrooms yeah they
are and then I can there's one
here I need something here no no it is
so they are add the
mushrooms and another one
here oh he's one behind here too
almost okay and then boom boom
boom
boom yeah I'm definitely yeah there must
be
uh a bunch of them in the uh
bonus
skipped T no if you say it as Tuan
instead of
T like a difference but this it means 1
th000 bloody
sweet PES are intense to say at
least the polishing sentence
where Cola is one such way or if you
want to increase you
say I that is as because
how yeah it's essentally curs someone
see I makes makes
sense tou makes
sense
policy devel This Way
Corona it's
so
s seem like a coin straight
forward
we
go oh
no oh is this one where it just
goes pretty sure they made it happen on
both of these
levels no wait for
me follow me
it has left
me 16 I think that's correct amount
right okay I'm I'm going I'm going
to come on how was my hit oh
my
oh my oh my oh my oh
my hello EG egg
WF and
Sh the dog's blood just right my up my
own stting going I have a n in the but
once it comes say hi wish you more good
thank you for going by it's very nice of
me oh no I died in the
game
notsy
[Music]
what yeah that's that's
likey okay there's one
here there's one
here there's one
here one
here and one
here one
here and one
here let
go okay we're kind of fig to level out
let's try it for real this
time
speaking of swear words is there a nasty
Swedish animated TV show just like South
Park well there is a TV show that they
add in United States but they only add
the first season because they didn't
think it
was suitable to show the rest of the
show if some if remember correctly I
could be wrong though um it was a kid
show I like s spark which I guess isn't
a kid
show but there
that not sure how Sweedish it was though
CU a lot
of a lot of the shows are
like like made together
with like multiple studos something I
mean that's cas of even shows like takes
Animaniac for example it has been also
developed developed animated in South
Korea for
example it's not really considered South
Korean show because of
that I was supposed to finish Lev just
check if I got all boxes but I got stop
I got I got stuck on un Invisible
War I like the soft par so but or is it
some insult another kids that they
they're sent to some camp where they
sent through a tunnel of insult or they
all s of insulant and the rection is can
we get here again I need to hear his all
again I I say
though was so many goose in the words I
could
learn but you know when they try to
teach kids what not to do and uh the
kids didn't even consider doing those
things and then after that they do those
things can I do this this time no more
things I'll do it this
time I'm not here to fail I'm here to
succeed
I want to be
successful this is the last Gem and and
100% in the
king and also I have not watched South
Park if anyone is
curious I made that episode oh and that
one episode where it ends with the the
town discussing who is isn't allowed to
use a certain slur begin with f on TV
it's Bri SL for cigarette by the way ah
you mean the word
[ __ ] am I allowed to say that word you
know
considering of course saying the word
h uh say say saying the word uh with a
British meaning for like that and you're
not using it as a a slur and it's not a
