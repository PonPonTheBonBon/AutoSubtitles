taada this is what I was playing
yesterday and now we're moving on to
skipping rock I hope I got that name
Qui spongeb oh wait sorry sorry I keep
forgetting to start this
thing just give me a
moment it is starting up
it has to log into the Twitch account
unlimited STI welcome back I swear this
game music here being a rabbit all I can
think of
[Music]
is
well I hope I'm not being chased or
anything I
counted we got one prediction in there
are is like 20 more minutes to predict
and wait let's see uh it's kind of
started up it's connecting or
[Music]
something there we
go now it should be work now now it
should be working you should be able to
should be way quiet I'm hunting
rabbits and now you can do the redeem of
the outfit with my SP magic h
spear
no I cannot say what these Magic Helmet
can do but a spear probably isn't that
effective against pon pon with
than however I do I do not know if I
have a tank in this level
but there's the bridge and then there's
like a lot of towers I
assume and then a huge field of
flags flag
buildings
go is this a whole
Forest yeah there's a big forest and
then I'll just have
to I got a full set of vehicles on
oh
yeah
sorry trees but I had to remove
you this is my
Island okay
after wasting a bunch of
ammunition time to restock
and there you go that's a clean pass now
it should be easier to move
up that was more than half of
it really this this h of vehicle should
be able to just run over a
trip
I guess
not come on
Destroy there we go
finally
that oh here we go
again let's move
on those people can swim out to the
ocean oh
no
the amount
of no there's Str to
reach in
going
make get a nice and clean path
here
so I definitely have to remove more of
the towers before I can move in with
helicopter which is funny because the
Polish word for helmet is H what is
pronounce the way would pronounce it
yeah I guess that's
true helmet
helmet and my father is
poish the more you learn about these
characters oh
my so many Towers too many Towers
and do many of those as
well
oh let me
be I just a peaceful heavy
tank you know prop say is
playing up the trees for better for a
minute we got a few more Towers to take
down well I do know about the popy deer
but I'm barely watched
it
but I assume you mean meant to unlimited
stick so much more peaceful now uh
wait there's still a lot of towers
left and way too many
mines out one more of
these
we go another
one I could remove some of that with
helicopter but
based on a real
person
Frank
Frank
Rocky was born in
Poland
a real person born in
Poland
H I believe
that no reason not to
yeah
who they don't have any
rot come on
now
three of
[Music]
them come on stop
that way too many of
them so I may have actually heard that
somewhere before but it's pretty
neat maybe you've been here
before and
heard
okay
time to going to say the flying thing
coming already now there was a
tower as you see
Tower
what don't move
that
there you
[Music]
go now we should be a pretty safe
for going a
tank
for
and then
well still M's up
here and those things
to come
on
yeah looks like I need to remove some
more
mines
nice I may let's
see
y then I
will to move hopefully I can reach do
without being shut
down
uhuh not that that was that important
but this one is more
important
[Music]
okay
doing some ging in the
game now with the
uh offending M's
[Music]
gone so much easier TR through here
now good thing there wasn't any mines
hiding in the
forest you would make clear the force
with easier
maybe there's a lot of trees left here
even though there was mines
there
oh
oh someone up here shooting
me why do you show
up and
you
oh nice okay you know
what I try to take you out this
one man
there go one of them
G do it work yes the swimsuit is
active
perfect
I don't like
streams
time yeah if I'm going to skip over
those
rocks considering the name of the
level I better put on my
swimsuit
I made my prediction too soon I saw that
was a bridge with t i side I didn't know
you were going to have to pull the
bridge out the turrets I mean the bridge
was green so I
mean was different from the brown bridge
that
was so yes I do have to build Bridge
myself out of
TRS
people put in your predictions time I
soon
up I wonder if I
should if I should use a helicopter or
something or if that's
suicide
this because I
kid this mon of the map on the countown
came in I didn't notice the TR but it
was large it wasn't small what you're
talking
about it was
huge I made it green and
orange timer is soon up put in your
predictions we have two prediction two
predicted values so far
here come
stay okay it Le one dead
yep it took a deep in the
water I wonder if I can use the
helicopter how my phone the actual
stream screen is barely a third of my
phone screen well you could have SED in
just Tak a better look at map I don't
know there a crazy
suggestion just assuming take a map and
then zoom out or Zoom you know go the
portrait landscape
mode missed that one
don't mind
me oh CL
okay
good
shakes what are you shaking
about but you got to storry
B thank you for showing up makes me
happy the controller yeah yeah all right
yeah yeah for some reason you can't
check a controller you just wiggle it
about I should make clips of
that thank you for stopping
by take it
mouse that was the tower I
missed
oh oh get knocked off
course
oops Yeah but it's so much
better says me something you're ready to
Victorious I hope I'm Victorious I hope
you managed to put your vote in because
you
came quite
late hi
[Music]
hi hope you're enjoying the
emotes let's take care of some
things no no
no that was a waste of a
helicopter oh
no okay no more stupid
things
do it correctly pon
[Music]
pon I am starting up I doing wrong
one
okay I'm got to the wrong
place let me get out
here too far
north I'm leaving I'm leaving trust
me
H say that was pretty
[Music]
successful pretty
[Music]
successful what pretty
an prediction Time end no I mean it
maybe it
did it ended like very close to one
great
joint next time
speedrun Speed Run the game 100%
[Music]
completion yeah I would like to see a
speedrun in this game finish every
map
okay
[Music]
I'm moving I'm
moving but say that was pretty
successful
[Music]
again
oh scary
scary cuz I only have to clear off this
area
wait do I
think
on it facing
me
[Music]
miss
it now faing away from
me
nice both Miss
[Music]
Bo wonder if this more efficient
clearing after the for more forward
there we
go it's always raining November in s
well no but is so annoying when it
rains the when it does get banned when
it comes like
November or just
[Music]
Placebo
look can
stop wow no
nope whatever
it's not like I need coach
anyway disappointment
[Music]
bunny open and wi this so slow
comparison to the
[Music]
helicopter hey at least I got rid of
plenty of towers already
and one thing I can appreciate is
the yes this map
how oh I can't go over like that okay
and now I
know so that's a your
Ru okay so if there's some construction
on top of the deep water like a bridge
or Tower I cannot go from one to the
other this is a because her bunny food
budg is riding on this prediction
oh oh
my is she she is she predicting with her
bunny food budget that doesn't sound
smart
thank the man
down
dang
it and if she loses she'll have to eat
that pizza with pineapple on top that
she s is appointed
about so now switch from the first swi
to the second
swi and there's a hydr
in I think I did
that Sly done
me yeah I should
have
this is going to be a tricky
map building the bridge is taken
away it's not been that long
yet if your prediction is
correct
for
can it just
fly why doesn't it Fly front of
me
and they were never flying in front I
mean sure it makes sense but they're
like Mindless drones
literally there were plus there's an
insect here me at the
moment cuz of course
ni they're like mosquitoes yeah so now I
need to use the tank that makes it hard
to shoot them it's already hard to shoot
them
so well a bit too wiggly wiggly wiggle
I
of course now I don't have
a I'm reversing I'm not taking R
now
if only it could have like larger
area mosquito
drones cuz some I supposed to zigzag
between
this
M sport right oh my the S isn't even
over
yet and
that
on
okay there not much left but you have
need to pet bunny time if good
luck okay 10 more minutes of swiy though
but
yes the bunny time me is good luck Not
bunny
po especially not bunny pors with po
pants those are cursed
okay so so far so
good
I need to get closer
to no another
drone getting to trying to concentrate
shoting
drones and going over
stones and one is
down I got
it that was close it's so hard to shoot
for some
reason like these
trees didn't hit a single
one not much left there I don't have
have rabbit food as a kid I thought it
was fake until the kitchen part fell off
and there was a bone inside it was a
fake bone okay
did he get
scared did it have PP
pants like some people said that they've
seen poants on bunnies but this it's
probably probably poads it's just the
skin under the PO the
F like I mean they have P
like
so they still have like that
but
yep
yep fell into
water oh well that was one tank G I'm
going to lose this
because
oh more getting sh
[Music]
s yeah they should have made the this P
pass twice as
wide more Tower
[Music]
turrets
yeah I'm
going oh my oh
my went too far forward
there
don't P the tank
Pro I'm usually not this terrible at the
game but I guess I'm terrible now that's
because GRE is
watching me I come this far so I can't
be that terrible can
[Music]
I it's K oh no I made fun of you too
much I guess karma is getting
me and rightfully
so come
on
here comes the
Drone and went too far for it I went
game
over there's no idea if I even try to
destroy those towers with that car I I
didn't even finish
line all well time to start over
yeah let's clear off the forest
first
come
on can we get
easy I don't have to deal with it
again time pretty
quick so one now that that's cleared
up let's bring the real
guns three shares for peaceful
deforestation
yep
the peaceful deforestation you ever seen
I need to remove those
mines I need to quickly get rid of
these
go
boom okay there's not much left unless
it
this is a peaceful deforestation
indeed bringing those trees we need to
build a wooden
tank oh sportsare
time
that at least the bridge survive this
time
was another Hint by it wasn't the line a
bridge but Towers is because bridges are
straight let me show you can maybe have
but not dagal like
that I mean I guess they can have made a
special one but nothing in game has
anything
diagonal
okay hey why are you coming
already I've just got to the
island
okay oh I hit that tree not the time
that was the what that was what
exploded like oh yeah I blow up the
tower
nope so mostly cleared
out I should maybe be in the helicopter
and remove like
mines like how about the mine before the
bridge I don't have to go around it
every time I'm I'm going to run into
something
come
on it was the mine I wanted to shoot not
the
somewh there we
go I would have blown up anyway
[Music]
but
don't go too close
there
oh time to move
home
and maybe they Mak s on very for station
cuz they keep
missing come on
[Music]
land at least
now
much safe for
there and also safe for
here okay
let's they're trying to shoot the pre
they're trying to shoot me but they keep
me
missing good get
miss the
tree come
on have you SE seen the first St in this
people
before let's remove the last
mday okay
let's do this
actually with the helicopter I should
remove the like the outer
Towers
that but that I
mean
Towers we been at this far out this
might be a bit too
far
[Music]
no and I fade and I fail again oh my
those towers are
[Music]
annoying already lost the
helicopter I feel like I should restart
immediately
TR find at the
TRS
oh I don't need help for
me what you what two of them oh by
Third
I
well already manag to lose one
helicopter
I going going to
like
H thought I heard a flying greasing
approach Maybe maybe it
[Music]
was my fa this is
upset
[Music]
hey hey must be the
shooting shooting turning
[Music]
w didn't feel like one of I didn't feel
like I was hit by last can I just

already was R was
blank
Dam it
again let's get rid of
everything yes some trees
survives
come on shoot them shoot the
trees
come
on that's most of the trees
anyway I barely shut down any
trees and see bunch of trees are sh
down think this
that Minds even more
awward
location away Way
tree well let's bring out helicopter
immedi to get rid of those mines and I
guess I just have to clear off more of
the to should not bring out hel too
early this this one going to hurt a
bridge NOP yes it
did
need one of this the
forestation
one
I did you survive there we
go Rubble of that one I
well more annoying placement on mines
this
time
blank not even
laying suppos
I'm going to go to bed makes sense I
mean yeah understand understand it must
be really late for you
g have a good
night thanks for stopping by thanks for
leering have a good
stream it's past
midnight
1:00 drone
orang it does um
hey excuse me where did you come from I
was peaceful driving
already not g me
stupid
there was just one mine there inter
see come
on don't get stuck in
Forest let help for the def
station wait I need to get rid of the
mine
first he's not going great for me
it
it's only been here for 1 hour I just
started this map because I have to
restart
it any need set off a large explosion on
the whole
islanding
everything come on get hit of
it
okay
exing Ser the
trees it wouldn't be more interesting if
it was easier to hit the trees
because then you can be because then you
could kind of use the forest as a way to
hide
yourself because it would make it harder
to hit him that would be kind of
interesting to be
honest
well I would think it would be
[Music]
interesting
okay I'm licking popcorn
Pon corn
ponor okay there's like one
line unless I can approach
with maybe I shouldn't risk the
helicopter I've been risking my
helicopter too many
times
okay so I need to get rid of
these
so I can
safely second can have safely approach
the island without get me helicopter
shut down because that way take care of
my helicopter H one is kute hey hello VI

outfits
automatically I'm going to way too far
out
Welling that
Tower ignoring the tower that is
actually shooting at me and going for
the towers that aren't shooting at me
that's how we
do
okay I'm probably
going way too
far oh stop
shooting great that that
worked not perfect but it
[Music]
worked swimsuit yes that's sound and
also hello Pap wolf I don't know if why

saying what I wanted to know what an
actual cute Swedish person would call in
Swedish and she gave me a non answer I'm
distro
when I'm
sorry that was
close too close
I'm sorry like I don't even know the
cute sound would
be
Harding wait that's not having grandm
I'm
sorry it would be the definite form of
planning morning C crazy in the morning
I am trying to put my head on straight
it's not fully W Wen up yet party with
jellyish
Vibes jellyish Vibes coming with with
one person
party the
count oh that's a two minute Towers let
me get up
here SC out Towers can't really reach
them I say time
which is
[Music]
[Music]
annoying
so there go oh yeah I just s if you
saying e we
could imagine
that
yes that would be kind of fun however
um this
know
ah okay has said that was a
success me slowly but slowly but
safely okay so I have this suggestion
sent to Twitch and where the idea is to
uh make the
uh have a redeem where you get a list of
uh I call it a drop down there but
basically making it a
list of what
uh of a predetermined option it's kind
of like kind of like a the text input
theme but everything is predy determined
I like how it would
work it would be really useful for like
a lot
of especially outfits you're going to
have like 30
different
okay I'm going I'm going
and you can vote on it just using your
Twitch
account nice how about
[Music]
that and say that was a successful
run eh interesting roue that would be an
interesting
redeem
and
yeah keep
message someone told me a kitty b b in a
swimsuit is a flying is flying H yeah I
guess I
am I'm hello red I'm just wearing a
swimsuit and I'm flying a helicopter so
know if the hel op is shot down from the
air and the bun lands in the water she
have a swiet on
already it's being efficient you
know no don't shoot
me
oh all on
[Music]
slowly slowly slowly working my way down
the forest for Forest of
powers you heard wrong it's a helicopter
now it's a
helicopter laughter is a abundant in the
mouth
of I your suggestion thank you 61k cheer
de once
one if you want I mean it is a cute
bunny and if you do want to help me out
economically you
know not saying you have to
but n that was a bit of a failure of
me I many ideas this could be Greatful
yeah yeah I think it would be so useful
to have that I think especially as I
said I want like a lot of different
outfits I've already made almost 20
outfits for my pon pon mod and having 20
different redeems for every single
house try to think
what I know you got the biggest badges
but I won't give that much which I could
don't don't tell me thr
off
ni there you
go slowly getting rid of those
T anyway I had
uh going past
this
there
[Music]
just give me a moment to catch up with
everything here was in game that should
pause the time you
know he
because and yeah has been crazy with
the with the
redeems uh I would
say I'm trying to think like
laughter maybe Viper could agree with
this
translation I I I would say
I need to get
a uh in it's an English translation of a
Latin phrase res AB in
or one day got a Swedish attempt at it I
need to get this emote I needed to get
this
emote now I'm going this way
apparently understandable what
mean
out of
here I got read of some of those towers
and that's a
progress uh I have an API that transl
takes to seal the dialect Lang like
pirate and Yoda would
be oh oh yeah yeah I I
see it would be yeah because my suggest
does not consider also having a text
input but being able to select one of
those options and then proceed to text
input or like or like it would probably
be better to in the text input have like
a drop down on it that you can select a
version or something could be really
useful for your TTS as well so you pick
just TTS get the text input mode and
then there's like a drop down to pick
TTS
voice
that could be another addition to my
suggestion I haven't considered
[Music]
that why is it so
soon7 this game is so Weir with the
camera
[Music]
missed I think I'm kind of mostly done
there can I just get rid of these Tre
thank
you uh what is to destroy with a PS4
controller oh oh yeah should I send you
a screenshot of
that nice color in a f door p p what
what are you talking about
wi yeah lots of people have multiple
voices yeah
yeah yeah that should be I should go
here
now need a TTS that turns this stuff
into Swedish for
you I mean the TTS wouldn't translate
but yeah I
get I should have a TTS
pet
we
[Music]
go all need to
watch
beautiful how many T left to shoot down
I think I saw an API that good to
[Music]
translations could do it reasonable
actually tot has a B has like benefits
that you can add context to what you
should translate I'm kind of working
myself up bit too far from the
towers let let me try to get
closer
and you can
also
yeah yeah basically keep
context why don't want
to something you can't do with most
translation
services if it actually uses this
context to change the translation that's
a good question
I
know why is it so zoomed in I don't get
it it has been more SE Downs
before
[Music]
can
[Music]
I change the
uh not sure if it applies it immediately
or I did good but I
realized I didn't want that sorry
um
um wait why this
plank what was it
now oh oh
yeah here we
go here we
go and hopefully it can apply controller
change immediately so
yes H I never asked GPT to transer
anything I'm not sure how good it is
well I have and I
can't ium
that
nice but I haven't like
I've Ted try to translate into all
languages to see how what it what what
kind of texted outputs but I'm not not
try to do
like try try to ask to translate Swedish
right to see what it
games too many times up there going
[Music]
back
my
[Music]
message oh
yeah I'm working
[Music]
very as soon as the time is
[Music]
up
okay yeah yeah so
uh I need to remove some more of those
Towers then I see if I can cut straight
over the line of
towers because previously I tried to fly
along the towers line but that just
ended up me with me
failing but it remains that
there it looks
at
than go nice
[Music]
nice when I hit it something
[Music]
so I got I got some towers down so
that's
[Music]
good ah nice
nice but yes
now we
still yeah yeah I think I think that's
good
let me see if I can
like cross straight
over and see if I can get rid of some
towers that
way
like
[Music]
this that
counts and what I'm
here there you
go
can enough those
[Music]
mines not a perfect
run the previous time yeah I took out
the towers next to
the
may I should
just do the carpet pumping I think you
call
it I try to fix so the bot tells how
many bits you have donated in total when
you make a bit
donation so if
wiper
wants to make a
donation D thank you for
following be like bunny flying
helicopter and shooting
[Music]
Towers
[Music]
what
way ah still satus is still
alive some of

on the
moment well I hope I I couldn't when I
tested the code
for the uh Bon naations it did not give
me the it didn't work but I don't know
if it has to be proper because sometimes
it just doesn't do what you wanted to
do oh there we
go I'm moving I think that was a
successful
run
insane got managed to hit a lot of those
turrets tur
[Music]
Towers
it sounds like people are writing stuff
nothing showing up but I guess people
are not writing
stuff I see the I heard like the sound
of a message coming in but see up here I
don't know what's
happening
but I did once have a BG that didn't
allow me to write anything
so oh no I
know okay have I used up the helicopter
too

to okay let
me
shoot some with this
one target
practice Bri is undamaged this
time do like
that can I reach that
one
ni yeah those are way too far out I
can't reach
those okay so um
I like the [ __ ] on Tre
okay when you predict for how long it
will takes me to complete a map you had
to take into consider consideration and
like shoting
mes
so there's eight jelly Shing around the
feral pon pon has the pon pon turned
into feral pon pon and now there's Shing
H I only have two helicopters totally
because you start with two helicopters
in this 11 totally not because I lost

[Music]
need see that's that's
very that's what I
like I call that a
[Music]
success I going and Destroy some
Towers I did not lose my
helicopter you know like a few segment
there without Towers
if I continue like
this eventually the line will not have
and as long as there's no Towers there I
can then more safely just destroy the
whole thing with
helicopter to deal
with looking away they're not looking
away
sorry
h cuz there's a tower
[Music]
here oh it
survived there you
go oh no this
[Music]
sign i' say that a success

the the other
tank the
tank I mean this isn't that tank we
go
nice
nice oh and
[Music]
run
[Music]
that
[Music]
and here comes the
[Music]
Drone take I'm
[Music]
St yep it's it's it's just
a
one t left in that 121 clust
day 11 all the T have has fallen over

12 10 is just still sitting in
there
is
there we go one almost St tank but I
didn't that was
close and never have miss the whole
thing okay you know what I get me of I
one
too
they never saw it
coming ants are sooning over and the
audience is
back I might PR for everyone being
here making me come
[Music]
company well I'm out out on this crazy
military
Adventure this
military they're looking at
me
there we
go I'm say that a
[Music]
sucess so so now it's just that upper
part
[Music]
left then every tower has been
removed I can just
Traverse this line of towers I just
still need to remove these I wish I
could drive on top of them but sadly
that's not an
option
W oh there was another helicopter
gun
yeah
SP okay it's still still kind of need to
remove those Towers on the sides
there know I need toar Learn to Fly
Away I do want run and then I fly
away
[Music]
there we go
[Music]
thanks having D
[Music]
it
there we go that's a that
[Music]
message
yeah I need to get get out
here we
[Music]
go nice nice
[Music]
[Music]
here still L good to hear attention
enemy turrets ignore
me attention wait no attention
please
so what I'm thinking for
this what I do want like
this 3D pon pon is one H demon
outet have
like H there would be like a puff of
Magic Smoke and then she wor a new
outfit but
oh not hit that one or that
one I go home so I I must not have shot
them but as the new outfit is put on pon
pon the previous outfit should like f
[Music]
off
FL to the ground like off camera so you
don't see it
anymore so have PR just flies away I
think that would look
funny with a flash of light and she's in
her KN
outfit I
mean preferably not like anything
that's
right
you
know that is not like a flash a flash
Pang all of a
sudden I think like the audience for
some reason have the power of
magic changing your
[Music]
outfit
[Music]
thanks now in is own FTI turn
or mod cover changes then screen
disappears N I think I think I think if
uh puff of Magic Smoke will be
[Music]
funny the
uh
it would be magic so pon pon is not
controler her outfit isly
changing the all can still go f
sometimes T it but f is not changing I
like for on her was what I was thinking
the outf changing is under control of
the
onions I still like the P of man my I
guess I appreciate the the
[Music]
ideas oh no next to so
close
again
[Music]
not much left to get rid of the
[Music]
final then I just need to travel across
all of this infiltrate any
ways uh yeah yeah
[Music]
I I do appreciate that even it doesn't
sound like
it so close
twice land the next to
Tower oh there's like six towers left
there six towers
left that will take down the helicopter
in like two
seconds 13 T have fallen five still
stands and they're still in there
surely our T won't fall
down definely
[Music]
not there we
go
run helicopter
[Music]
run run you better run I run he better
run faster than a missile in this
case maybe it was just one
[Music]
run
[Music]
[Music]
so
was it two times
[Music]
left oh I'm not even hit that to
before there we
go Okay so
[Music]
they got
[Music]
upset go go go go so two of those Towers
meaning that now I on them destroy
[Music]
them how
much because the base up there is can of
big
prediction seems a bit close but time
99 that's a lot
of oh there's a lot of T
there and 015 at the
end 99 9 9 9 9 90 one
fine
you're sure you lose that's the spirit
that wait that's the opposite of The
[Music]
Spirit Well
that's it it's what it is it's it's it's
what
it's
[Music]
yeah
[Music]
that was
terrible I L predictions unless rock man
bats in which case I win I guess you
have to convince Rocket Man to take part
with the
predictions in that
[Music]
case P pants they they fun funny wasn't
that terrible I actually had it
was he has no carrot coins I kind of
took all of
them when he doesn't have any because
he's never
here hopefully he's not that kind of
person be right back
okay
kind of person is
like I would watch your channel if I had
points but not that I hurt anyone using
that argument for channel point
but but I don't have any channel points
so I don't want to watch your channel
but you will have points if you were to
watch my
Chanel
anyway hey the L message is missing yeah
you didn't send
it or
anyway yeah your Lu commanding get sent
through
so whatever however you sent it you
didn't not
send
well well the problem is that they are
reach
here I do need to take care of them
never really step half my
fuel and now to
come okay I need to take care of
here okay I guess I have to get
back
[Music]
did not turn
enough
annoying but I might be able to
uh I might be able to approach with the
helicopter
now
yeah I just wish it was like two turet
whes more of a challenge remove but
easier to get
across well like if they didn't zag them
so much here don't get get that I mean I
guess it makes it the more difficult but
still not exactly sure what the exactly
more
much what then yeah you know Mak any
more
when I D starty some
timeway so that was this Su sense
[Music]
they're so engage than
drones at the
moment where does
it like on the map it doesn't look like
there's that many Towers but when I
approach there a lot of
towers
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I want that flying for shame the
[Music]
tank
[Music]
I hit like one Tower with one
bullet like a f of a
tower okay
okay the thing is I don't want to
approach that have like one piece of the
bridge destroyed and like okay I can't
attack with my
tanks that would be so
[Music]
annoying maybe I just need to do carpet
boming
in
not that this is too hard
but oh
[Music]
yeah
destroyed a bit
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
more
of
[Music]
course I am taking it carefully
here maybe I should approach with a tank
instead
[Music]
h
no there we
[Music]
go those was are dangerous to play into
helicopter
[Music]
[Music]
okay what me I manag to
do I start beit
there gu I might be able to approach
with the tank
now
I don't like to go across here
but oh what ah now it
doesn't now it has a perfect
line almost
perfect
[Music]
no I should have moved for it's so
annoying to get across
those so
annoying so annoying
can just be nor Bridge or just a
straight line of
towers
okay some
[Music]
but
wow but using the d-pad for controlling
the tank is not easy
to get stuck don't get stuck
not fly on its
way not not
here
oh of course I manag to explode that
one I'm not doing fantastic at the
moment
you're doing fine
I thanks for the
assurement your assuring
statement
[Music]
[Music]
well
anyway I did destroy some Towers
[Music]
there that must
counts
[Music]
just to complete this map at this
point there no want
we
maybe I should just fly in full K them
full of bullets
blits I only need to destroy the
flagman it's
like just two other flag Ms more
[Music]
specifically
oh there it is okay I'm
leing okay now better idea where the FL
is
they have the flag lock down
[Music]
yeah
because they have three left like
buildings I want to destroy the one that
the one that's very secured the one
that's kind of in between the wall and
then leave the third one to have the
flag which is like the most open
one
but yeah I need kind of need
to I should have sted map a bit
[Music]
more there we
go
no I shouldn't have done that I well I
guess I to take
any
only got one left one fell into the
water and the other one got blown
[Music]
up I should have missed left even though
I'm telling me myself that every single
time I still I'm doing I'm St we doing
[Music]
that oops can of L to change the swim
SE n don't wor about
it
yeah because that's totally not on the
platform but
okay okay I guess it wasn't on the
[Music]
platform
yeah I'm going to F this because
I navigating those not that you he
navigating this is very
tricky and I just need to stop failing
with the
helicopter I can do this map just that
I'm keeping enough f
it think I keeps telling myself to not
fail
it and I know what to do but I or I know
what not to do but I keep
doing I'm getting too
greeny
oh I need
that the F tank
even got
Stu is there another
one not that I can
see only chance now this
just
know
and who
knows don't I have enough feel to get
home
but
okay it looks like I have enough you to
get
home
should I
think cuz it's going to spawn like 50 of
these all
one
okay
so [ __ ] Dam it I just had a phone calls
with my family I'm trying oh oh no that
I'm so messed up sorry for bring it here
I'm broken just need to say to someone I
guess not have Vibes that does not sound
like something good happened at all at
quite the
opposite I'm sorry to hear that
wiper hope you
have I hope you have some people to talk
to otherwise who
can not not sure if I'm a right person
if you
to me but I don't
know I know what I can
do
sorry it's
Sam
that
go too
far okay I want to get access to
that
okay this is not
doing let me
turn okay I don't care if this can
attack the no come
[Music]
on why that one why that
one
oh
no really sorry I didn't man to keep the
mood oh
yeah EV so people
gu can't
be I assume
it's for
you
when I'll try my best to get this flank
and then we'll
have celebrations for
victory okay my
idea for doing
this is I will go
north
and
then I will approach with a Jeep from
that
direction
there's a flag
annoyingly then I just rush through with
the Jeep
here destroy this
one rush through without setting up that
mine go up
here now come on doing so well
here here and then I go around
[Music]
here go
and what do you want and then I enter
here another
one this
it
and and then get to flag that should be
easy let's go let's get that
flank easy peasy no problem trust
me
don't say the drones are coming while
I'm going over the water that would be
so
annoying that has happen before but that
could be because
I been
going too far off the
map but they have no yeah I gone with a
Jeep across deep water before long long
distance and it was no drones but it can
be different per
map
though some maps might not allow you to
cross waterer but I want to use all the
abilities this is slow but now I'm
approaching
this section here where it goes norise
slow over water yeah don't rush
this I said I only need to move the
flag like out from there because if I
did get to PL mov if I lose the for some
reason I don't have to travel as for
next
then really hope I can reach the
flank okay there's a mine up
here two of them well nice
nice and there's no mine there accient
loading
it then
I oh I didn't know we could run over
okay you
can and get the flag and move
out
I'm still not out of the danger zone
yet there are those towers and of course
the
mines oh no who W well it
worked what are you doing
tep
[Music]
here comes the
Drone I said if I Le move the
flag it will be better next
time now I don't need to bring it out of
the
base
anymore
okay time to get the flly in least I
know I'm allowed to
do I know I lost the
prediction I'm just glad I can finally
complete this man
oh again one map one stream that's going
to be the trend
right also when I completed the previous
um
uh the previous map which was the first
map of the C
World it did not give me a
code which means that there's no world
Beyond
this
although I mean it could be another
world it's just that it didn't give me
any
code but I got access to both wordss at
the same time but I
didn't uh because there's one thing when
I press up in the menu at this moment
the it still allows me to enter a code
but that could just be because that's
just how the game works even though you
unlock everything you might be able to
press up on last World and still be able
to put a code for some reason
okay the flag is up
here
oh right at least I
can come on pick it
[Music]
up wa
okay now it's safe now now I had no
problem getting
home now it's more a question of how
long it will take for me to get
[Music]
home make the music going slowly across
the water I've done that in one other
map that the
ja
map with all those Island that was
annoying map but I didn't complete that
map too and that was that was a long map
at that
time then there's been like a map that
took 3 hours to
[Music]
complete yeah I still think my idea
about being able to secure a base and
then starting from there would be so I
don't that I think that would
massively improve this game so after you
get through this pass and get up
to the island there with the three
turrets shoot down the three turs
and and enter the platform there to
unlock it and then you can start from
there
instead makes things so much nicer it
will make the game easier of course
but makes things more convenient
too
[Music]
okay rush rush
rush only three watches and half of like
six watches before half of them left
well I guess they didn't get to see me
win level finally
woohoo
[Music]
W yeah the same me as usual
all only 1 hour 42 minutes and 27
seconds it's only because I had to
restart but that was the actual time it
took for me to complete the
level I hope things will be okay I hope
so
too
well that means that one the longest
predicted time which is 1 hour 50
minutes is the
winner
congratulations and
celebrations next
time
Halloween and the starting point is all
the way up there which it really should
be kind of all
wings I mean I can understand if they
want kind of a picture but this isn't a
picture they could just rotate this
18° so that you always start at the top
of the map if possible with the
exception of special Maps where this
isn't possible but yeah that's the M La
for next
time moving on to the end screen it
hasn't exactly been 3 hours yet but no
point of me to start a new map hope
that's
understandable
so now this schedule looks a bit
weird no streams next week yeah so my
plan now is that I will just put all
focus on just fixing the remaining stuff
of the house and just selling it and get
get all of that stuff
done and my an exy about this housing is
building up and I
am not feeling my
best
so so
yeah thanks for seeing my
head we don't have anyone I haven't even
left yet very
early all right we have oh I know who we
should R I definitely know who we should
R there's no question about
it it is a person playing
Crash but it is a bunny playing
Crash and on PS1
even I mean
[Music]
a
and
[Music]
a lovely bunny he's a great St right I
do like everything
there let's send should we send a feral
bunny no not everyone has it gives you a
reason to get
it because it's a bunny you
know yeah that
[Music]
one but
yes thank you every for being here it
does make me feel
better it makes
me more
relaxed and I guess
I'll keep you updated on the server how
it
goes I just have
to
yeah we'll
see we'll see it's so much uncertainty
that's kind of what's building my
anxiety which is
yeah training
[Music]
time
