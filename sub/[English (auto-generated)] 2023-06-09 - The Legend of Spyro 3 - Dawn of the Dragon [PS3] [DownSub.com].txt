because I didn't [ __ ] team capture

card

how silly of me

and it's flying in let's bring up the

picture on the screen

loading

kill

and then

there we go

perfect

and I basically figure out how I should

get it to show up on today which I could

do before I start streaming but

thank you forgetting to do that

oh my internet is not lacking in some

mode for some reason

oh this isn't cute

um

yeah

I don't know I think that's so bad at

the moment I can't reduce the video

quality so it will look terrible

but at least it should be stable at that

point

is working nice nice

let's continue and I

put my tea again

hey it's dropping friends

what is it doing

[Music]

welcome everyone

sorry for it uh

yeah we're like

a refreshing we are at one

uh

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

again

[Music]

is that yeah I guess someone asked me

any questions

and I would say

it's um

I mean I'm still playing I still enjoy

it so I guess you did enjoyable

[Music]

you know I shouldn't mix it up because

the attack button is the same time

[Music]

I was jumping

and another video this audio at least

it's not what

[Music]

there's audio okay this movie with this

video I can see the picture what what is

going on

it says that it's dreaming

like

although it says that

what are these numbers wrong

OBS reports five thousand

minutes

okay let's see can I mute

yes it's muted

oh it's quite

quite a long

like

when I checked the stream it's I'm

currently

I'm currently opening the

yeah

you think the armor piece I'm way behind

behind of that part

is why is it so behind

you said with you like

it

I don't know

this is a massive delay at the moment

for some reason

inside

this is just the opening date

I guess it's not

yeah it's still really the perfect thing

hey I'm confused

all right

okay okay okay

this one

all right what does this have immune to

stun on that sounds nice

I will do that instead

ah

well um

if someone has an idea for how to make

twitch catch up

I'm I'm listening

probably have to wait

yeah I mean it before you

I can get an answer sheet comments

to hear music

does this means I'm bossy

[Music]

yeah Mike here might be dropping frames

it keeps getting behind for us sometimes

if something else is up learning back

here yeah I close the browsing

come on

right

[Music]

well I I am reading so

[Music]

and I said

a while back

okay

if someone has an idea how do you like

make twitch like get there

because it's twitch being behind at the

moment

I could just make twitch

now that would be nice

getting quite hard am I supposed to go

up here

because I am

huh

[Music]

this is oh yeah this is this is

okay is that point is not earth

and I'll see

you got Chuck is hitting it

[Music]

it should definitely be more ahead now

[Music]

well

I think this one

[Music]

time bye welcome

yeah it should definitely be better now

okay this is one of those

thank you

and the chat is no longer delayed whoa

[Music]

this church is a lot of Highway

[Music]

yeah no it's weird

[Music]

this one is so expensive

oh oh no such an expensive power

[Music]

and that was controlling oh she was

fighting in

okay

try to remember that I spent on my phone

okay exactly

[Music]

all right

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

Rock

s

[Music]

there

he died

yes I switched out last night

[Music]

for green energy

of this stream

well I'm happy you've been here here

appreciate it

yes I struggle as I said I'm still need

to streaming so

in experience with this King

thank you

take it

I'll go in here

That was supposed to climb up

or something I don't know

it's not much of a secret boss

oh yeah I

oh

so you can think things around on

everyone

yes daddy

mark

was Henry

I think you can run on that one too

and you also don't need that because he

can play

this game is so weird

oh wait a minute

this is where I want to kill

is the secret enemy

and it's not blue that must be nice I'll

take over from here

when you come up

oh hello

[Music]

yeah I spent across anything

[Music]

okay forgot to keep tracking

pew pew pew

oh I got the chicken nice

[Music]

oh ice okay something better right there

maybe I should after you guys

just find it yeah

it's so cheap

okay

[Music]

it doesn't do anything

my turn

it's supposed to be wind

yeah it's supposed to be wind

y

I guess that's part part of me using the

same color

you can add some wings but as poison and

I understood some tiny details I'm

missing

you miss them might as well just be more

furry gems yeah

come on

foreign

[Music]

okay

this is going to be tricky

okay now it's okay

but I guess there's some extra details

to it

it's so hard

I got it this isn't

it yeah so this style isn't Earth it is

toxic

so I guess red means

near or Flame

what would it last me

yellow would be electric but it got

really be Darkness

[Music]

[Music]

all right here we go

[Music]

[Music]

okay

[Music]

respond

[Music]

okay finally

we're away from us Crystal

[Music]

okay oh

[Music]

this one is tricky

almost everyone has left hey my dad's

terrible I'm sorry

fish

[Music]

ing

and I understand me anyone I mean that

with quarters of two years in it which

is a lot of people

no

[Music]

I'm missing so many

but toxic is so expensive and apparently

like removing the masks

[Music]

[Music]

instead wow

[Music]

it takes us time for the Champs today

maybe I should give it somewhere else to

heal maybe I should go up up here

okay

I think it doesn't really have a way to

fall down quickly

okay I guess I guess it's mean because

it has a bit of a wind sign to it

but

[Music]

yeah finally

dancing

okay

let's see what happens if I go

[Applause]

pick this up

ah

yeah

okay

and then go back

I need smart spots thank you

how nice

I'm about aspired together oh then yeah

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

foreign

I couldn't kiss that second break

[Applause]

[Music]

I think okay

you defeated anything

[Music]

so powered

okay

celebration

first we don't need a spiral

but this is just here checking up like

this okay colors

needs more

let's collect some more green

and I was hoping for more but

bye

I need to uh yes I need to pick up those

somehow I just see one of them down

there

let's try that

I think this is out of Bounce

all right all right it wasn't on this

this is

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

let's get rid of this one please

okay

yeah it was really a nice meeting like

myself bars for their opponents

[Music]

thank you

and also yeah

I think I think that's my biggest

thing I really I feel like I'm lacking

from the Sun game

around the names addition I guess but

but really the health part I want to see

I want to see if I'm doing damage and I

want to see

destroy that one

this is just one

and why did the music start and when I

picked it up

this is not this exactly

[Music]

hydrate

[Music]

and press the wrong button that was

release

thank you for taking care of me

thank you

and you can't see around the most well

it doesn't look like he's supposed to be

able to run

[Music]

but I only got one the white spiders

from behind

you don't even have

hey I'm I'm carrying the big thing

oh this one this one requires two

hours but yeah

those other ones uh open both sides

one of those

they actually made the animation for it

where is

the other one

clawing at the gym

what is left to okay so these are like

submitted

this one requires

four four well 42

000

wow that's a lot

yeah

okay let's use that element anyway

perfect enemy

I'm friends really

[Music]

anything

[Music]

I guess this power is about this one now

all right

[Music]

get that word

yeah the thing is

I'll learn that I can't play

so I need to find one of those

unless I'm supposed to

maybe thinking English

technically

I don't know if she's locked when I beat

this up

it does okay

at least I had to test

another voice but I'm using because I

picked it up

well okay in that case that's not the

solution

now where can the last one be

the last 32 second one

that's after bounce

why is that flying

why are you flying back back and what

I want to explore

this this

unless you're supposed to do that

I have questions at the moment

Follow My Lead

let me know when you're over here I'm

still thinking

don't you worry

okay

like a wrecking ball

okay can I do that to the other places

then

it's nothing to

hold on to me all right

thank you

is the place again okay apparently not

missed

the attack

foreign

[Music]

like

I don't speak that quickly

I didn't speak I did it here because I

wasn't here yeah I see it yeah that's

what I'm from

package

doesn't seem too much attack the

Destroyer

exactly take it

did that

now the Destroyer

well you are here now I seem still

hey man I mean hey kitten

yeah I got excited it became weird

there's the other crystals after

Destroyer okay I can do that let's start

with this question

okay

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

alive

excellence

a huge business

destroyed part of 12.

[Music]

oh I see another one

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

when it was like last week

[Music]

I think

[Music]

oh that looks hot

okay there was no way to go

I think

but now the system is overheating his

boss is too hot

I see some two two of them even

good

Ness

okay let's see well when he got this I

mean he's been dead every time

oh look at this these stretched out

pictures

[Music]

maybe the eyes stretched out

probably yes

I think it's this isn't you can't go

around it was that one okay

oh there's one

there's another one

oh Treasures

[Music]

yeah I

will return I will await your turn

because the door returns

[Music]

okay let me see

how they fly up

I can write down

barely fly up

[Music]

thank you

I wonder if if I there's like

because I don't see much space for

like seven more

sadly I would have found more of this

[Music]

vegetation

I have obviously not explode everywhere

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

ah

traffic being properly fight

and probably fighting

the only way I never tried to fight

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

oh

[Music]

Captain destroyed

stop

please

all right

[Music]

go there we go stand still oh you're

dead

nice

[Music]

paper in his face well he shouldn't have

Walking Dead obviously

[Applause]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

are we going inside

I'm just going to the passage and still

outside in there but they didn't have to

do that one transition wait

[Music]

okay but what what was the point of that

I'm still on the outside

we just want that transition so I think

I could I could already apply there

[Music]

they gave me free flight and then yeah

so many strange views and without

regards to Free Flight maybe they

shouldn't have given you free fight in

that case

[ __ ] just that idea a crazy idea

obviously they would have to read the

signs a lot of the levels

[Music]

because like yeah here you're not

allowed to fly for that game

[Music]

we won't even have to fight this is

going to be prevented so often

now I've seen the last thing has

happened yeah

of course

is this really pretty

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

on this thing

let's just started especially

specifically built to fit spiral and see

the first range so this must be a nice

Spider song armor of this thing

he's sure there's a fish Pearl so

now I have this which is a nuclear hit

all night

I don't know what that is but for sure

maybe it stops blowing yourself

oh no this level is so weird

I'm so confused

[Music]

oh I see it

I see so I'm supposed to go here

but then they like

[Music]

this oh so close

the point of that wind I guess it gives

you a bit of a challenge trying to go

across there

if I can

foreign

[Music]

which game is that

[Music]

okay that's all I had to do okay

strong wind

I just

[Music]

I just had to run across the house

[Music]

okay oh

I should play this game

birthday modifying one of the races to

become bunnies and then I would play a

stat race as a bunny

but I don't know how to mod Sky himself

again with a bunny mod yes

this probably is somebody not but

probably not what I'm looking for

so anything I should do up here

India

hi

I don't remember the songs

[Music]

but I guess I'll just

continue next drawing

I found something

different animals that's too much effort

well I would like that

I mean yeah especially it's like cats

and so expensive it would be fun to do

different kind of ones

we'll see

if

I like get support

um

funny

wait how am I gave us that how many was

that oh there's another one

yeah yeah yeah yeah okay

am I supposed to be over there

it's getting funny

anything

here easy

okay so that's why I should continue

can I convert mine at the house

with any hands

[Music]

oh there's a blue one

[Music]

thank you

nice

spider fail

Ure

speaking of spider failing

as he pushes his head straight into that

lava Tower in the background

let's take flower showers

[Music]

you can see if this is

yeah

only a little bit the other dragons

Brian is pretty spider

it hurts but it doesn't happen

[Music]

you're basically standing inside that

place or should I use it together

all right

a safely

[Music]

I know seriously

[Music]

went towards held here

okay which way is the continuation just

this path

[Music]

and another one

is there something more up there

[Music]

maybe maybe I should do it quickly

inside

okay

that's how I do it

and yeah

do they have breakfast Colleen yep

so I got this one somehow

oh it's back here

I see why am I supposed to continue then

oh yeah I want that one I want to give

it to me

what is this

some kind of joke

now what are you doing

yeah

yeah

no okay get out there

sister here all the time I'm gonna

remember this one

trying this enough for the power I'm not

going to use that anyway

I think something like that although I

take the feeder powder

oh yeah it's enough

oh

maybe there's nothing

three times more

spider has a lot

[Music]

why am I sick person now

I'm basically back here

maybe I should give up to that place

again

maybe I went up there too early

yeah I did no one is supposed to come

here

okay

whispy

cheesy what do you mean by cheesy

I'm doing what the game last night

which is the part of the lemon hence

Jesus what part the totally meant to be

together which part you talking about

yeah I see

[Music]

I see what's going on

and happy nice cheese

oh

I know that's true I think that

see why why give me free flight if I'm

not supposed to hit

it was my Snapchat

I realize that

I'm gonna realize that when I took it

but then I feel annoying

in 11th science

[Music]

[Music]

okay

thank you

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

this game is really interesting it's

it is interesting that's why I want to

play it it's not like fantastic

and it's definitely not as fun as the

other inspiring games

I'd say

also since I have the new way of playing

the games

a different way of launching games on

the PS3 days

I should try to play a Heroes game yeah

[Music]

if it doesn't well

[Music]

it's annoying because I really want to

complete on games on stream

we should just climb

that don't need mine

[Music]

special

hit their heads are sucked into

different

[Music]

but maybe you're not thinking about

going in there are you come on Sparks

we're gonna need you to lead the way oh

single frame building screen

background sleeplessly

thought about

I'm still pressing up they've released

after they started walking

what happens

start

I think he had a game the game got to be

confused

[Music]

at least it's not dark side because at

least in this game if you keep watching

fortnite they will still go forward in

dog's life

he would start walking ready let's go in

the action Direction you want

but it's inspiring fine

I'm pretty awesome let's move

out all right

[Music]

side see okay

[Music]

let me know if these two characters on

the way and then if there's a practice

[Music]

anything

it sounds familiar yeah

okay that looks like something

to the walk down here and I noticed the

only thing here which I assuming

before I progressed

safely

[Music]

oh yeah I'm supposed to continue down

there and see let me see what's going on

current land

keep balanced

burn lines

yeah this is why I should break these

if I find these I know that I'm on the

right stretch

[Music]

and if I don't see anything that I need

a hair replacement

but

okay

Legend the spider one thing

I guess it makes more sense in this game

because of this game

you can't go back and

regenerate by old crystals

thank you

didn't mean that to happen

I got done with something very

specialist

something

that's exciting

[Music]

come on

this level I'm done now

okay what am I supposed to do now

okay something special or a special

salad oh

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign wait sure sure

I can't change

yeah this one we have to yeah overlay

thingy but

okay but they must release an updated

version because currently

bought any of that

like I can have it

automatically change

it and but this one

idea

yeah I am confused what am I supposed to

do

and

[Music]

because I I can't I can't teach anything

that requires

it starts over there

and it can't be anything that requires

anything because it is so I can't

change a

and event

s

here confused

If someone knows what I'm supposed to do

yeah

later taste it should show up hey it's

your time to shine

but obviously missing something and all

the games but

you haven't been I don't think enough

games you previously burned out anytime

now of course you could still be cheap

now but it could be something anything

obscure

I don't know what to do

follow me

in fact it's somewhere to start

but I don't have any

I don't have

again

top of the life only

okay

and a battle against metaphors

QuickTime event or something

[Music]

point

fighting part

yeah and you can't really do that mighty

cheese around it

I got something special for you

people feeding this due to these lips to
