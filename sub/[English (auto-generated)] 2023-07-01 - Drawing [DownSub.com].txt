so

so let me start the background music I

wish I was supposed to expand Friday

but I haven't

so

I defined it in the

long list of things which I should like

I should clean them like I don't need

the input speed anymore I would play

that

when I'm done with

Russians in Trinity I'm done with

added

I think that's my problem I added games

but I never removed them

[Music]

foreign

so as you

can see I am

made my own emups

and since I'm not exactly feeling like

drawing the community drawing today

which was the actual plan

I'm going to draw emotes instead

yeah

because

I said I'm going to unlock more Lots

very very soon this is stream

extremistics

you can see it from here

thank you

you can update this number right now

I have it on my about page

and I can't do that

now

yes this is team 57

which means on the fourth

is stream 60.

[Music]

and that

is

[Music]

there you go

[Music]

and same sickness is when I unlocked

emotes

[Music]

the specific ones what did people say

they wanted

[Music]

got it

serious

[Music]

oh yeah I got it

so far three suggestions of which one is

mine

[Music]

now let's make this

[Music]

oh

in a c

[Music]

I'm not sure how to mark this

is there a

probably not

at that time

[Music]

I should know I should learn this stuff

[Music]

maybe there isn't like

I don't know even what you look up which

doesn't help me find it either

um

bear Steins basically

just not Owen

but there's like

one vote for that

that

one and

last one that isn't even included

[Music]

the one I got for is

a separate one or not

that

that seems to be completely different

but this one as well

this one is one

in this one

[Music]

then I got a sad one

this one

this one

[Music]

this one

or this one

and this one

[Music]

so going solely by the notes

which is not a final decision people

more people don't love it to

type the cheese

it would be that one

that but for sure this is got all three

votes

and then it would be

that one

that's one another one

which can work I keep my kids

so

what followers

can have a mess because there are places

in the order I mean I mean

these

subscribers

[Music]

so this is this where you make your

emotes nice yes it is

and you are free to to uh are a of this

which I made so far which is 10 of them

which five would you argue should be

follower emotes basically the ones

anyone who just follows are allowed to

use

which you can use whenever your

subscription it runs out as well

yeah

but they are of course free too please

subscribe to hit that would help me

economically

anyway

but she might not be able to access all

of them at the moment

using one of them is

like bits thing which I had to do you

have to pay it once on the mid sizes

[Music]

that's fine eh

I'm not sure I need to think about it

yeah yeah

think about it I can basically post

them on in

a chance my

I want to post them in okay they did

actually send it one you can't pick

because that can't be a follower image

so ignoring that one

[Music]

so it's basically these ones

[Music]

which of the following

which five of the following

would you

like would you sit there

[Music]

all right emotes

let's do that can I pin this one message

dancing challenge

[Music]

I wonder if they cannot delete their

message they can delete everyone and

this is my instance yes I can apparently

not delete my own messages

[Music]

I think

these icons

yeah I cannot

delete my own message

but I'm

the channel I'm the streamer I should be

able to

okay

[Music]

let's move

I need those up

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

except the singing One

and the other four people are into being

in a full agreement and should be the

one

hello

Alexandra Gabriel Alexander Gabriel

welcome

I'm happy to see you here

I was working on this emotes

last drawing stream and I didn't

[Music]

on that mess

it's really not in the mood for that but

can I do

yeah when I was drawing this one I had a

headache or something

I actually I think someone call it a

migraine

and it's basically where I had a very

bad vision is that a good turn but I

could basically yeah

what I don't know how to describe it

like

I could see but it was a lot of

[Music]

light

so it is what I could see that there

were lines on the screen I couldn't

really

the individual lines

I would say I made the drawing pretty

well I think even in regardless but

certainly didn't help

[Music]

that is that's okay

foreign

[Music]

so

[Music]

[Music]

I do need an idea about the

crown chillic

that's an idea

[Music]

there is no quality

there we go

high quality

[Music]

okay and then one minute both

[Music]

[Music]

okay I need to have

it mine

the science of the market just got rid

of an existing one

foreign

[Music]

drawing of it

[Music]

[Music]

I do want to play it a bit safe I think

[Music]

it happens it's best to take this like

this nice and easy yeah

I mean

I couldn't be drawing that thing because

I couldn't really see that

but and the stream that seemed earlier

than I wanted to

but

I do feel better today so

[Music]

it really isn't any

[Music]

oh the design I could incorporate

[Music]

this is an idea let's see

[Music]

at the same time the design must still

be simple

you see this same design

what

different designs please

there we go

something different

foreign

[Music]

depends on what we eating it is

[Music]

uh and I will finish up

fresh

I'm basically onto my schedule

but today after Mario

third crash Force crash well

I might be able to finish up crash on

the third

meaning that I

maybe I could start in the next crash in

the fourth

which

I was thinking about Crash team racing

it's the like finish up thing

crash PS1 games

even though I have technical play the

PS1 crash games

that's what I mean

did my girl

maybe you can do online races with that

is I mean the Game Wouldn't doesn't have

online but

I should probably complete the game

first

and then if there's some kind of online

because I'm I mean

well I do have a

the hardware here but I do run down the

emulator because not nice quality I can

use

and modify the controlling layouts and

stuff like that which is just convenient

[Music]

so

[Music]

I mean crash team racing it's confused

and well I don't have that one

I really have to get it at some point so

I can

let's do it

but yeah I do have a physical copy of

okay

I just gonna question racing and I do

have a physical copy of application well

actually I do have a PlayStation 3 with

backwards can pretend I actually have

two of them and both containing an

action hardware for PS1 I also got an

action PS1

yeah that one is for switch places for

an Xbox one I don't even have any of

those consoles so I can't even say so I

just not only can I not get the gamers

cannot get

I don't even have the console to play it

on

so but there was an idea

and

yeah and normally do you set it on

stream so I guess I can say it on stream

too and she suggested that uh

we should play

probably meet other people too depending

on how many players you can play in that

game

yeah

does it say

no

number of

layers

no it doesn't say

well it says in the screenshot say ace

so maybe you can play like eight people

online

so adding like

playing with viewers shouldn't hopefully

not not be an issue

and I'm up to play that game and that

would therefore have to be on switch

because that's what knowledge you had

because as far as I know it does not

have a cross-platform play which some

games do

and I really wish that was more common

get why they don't want to support it

in time

[Music]

and it would be fun

sure

[Music]

but in that case for me to play that

game

but

I would need people because I can't

afford a concert I would need other

people to find one for me

I didn't beat press stop but

yeah the button just show up on screen

it does this

I didn't see that

I heard that spy will be playable Rush

team Rumble and still no Spanish for

like I wish they could like and if that

is a wishful thinking

that if they're not going to make it

Inspire 4 can I at least like

update

the United

and fix the bats

do you like

to remove the uh We've rendered

cutscenes

[Music]

with Indian cutscenes

but there there are reasons for why they

should do the in-game cutscenes which

why I think it's terrible the way they

do not really I really dislike people

hey developers if you run the cutscenes

for many reasons

yeah

and

but in Inspire one of the things they do

is that

the names of the places you go to is

written in front of the portal that's

kind of like in University

[Music]

and that's the case in in the intro

intro to

second Spar game

where he looks at the portal

the portal has the name

Dragon Shores on it

I mean sure even if you can't read it

I'm inspired says Dragon choice

you know it's important to playing

shorts but

actually having named dragon shorts on

the portal is still in better than it

being blank

but YouTube's

it being a prevented cutscene it doesn't

have the name of the name in front of

reporters it's just a blank portal it's

just like stupid

like I think

and they can't just add the name

on Independent cutscene because they

want to support all the languages

so

[Music]

they can't can't just add English name

they decided I know the name

[Music]

here

actually see around

[Music]

okay now it's perfectly round

should I add

Lloyd

or is it adding too much

he's probably adding too much oh he

always wanted to make custom lemon

subscribe but I'm a bit scared to start

I did like a Minecraft in version of 11

that was fun

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

it's a lot of work though and I still

haven't looked into moving gems and

stuff

so if it's going to be a completely new

level I have no idea

[Music]

yeah I said I forgot to find something

team

I need to keep things consistent

foreign

[Music]

I basically decided

that

I don't know I just felt like drawing

one day and and I started

what was the first

I decided

[Music]

first one I did

foreign

well I guess I guess I started drawing

Legacy

is a good opportunity to

this thing

down and then

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

there we go

I think I did this one first

I just

laughs

decided to draw it it's

foreign

s

especially this is

um this is

kind of shoes for two

one point is a bit Gray

oh that is cute

oh and

maybe I shouldn't have to chat

it can be a bit covered I guess

too much fluff

[Music]

it way too much of yourself

so so yeah I decided that that should be

my

I think I did that one first and then I

did the

and then I did the emotions

and then after doing the emails which

you probably answer some

and these drawings

and with the sausage fingers

and nice background and

short skirts but

details

thank you

[Music]

sailor pun yeah

[Music]

foreign

I've drawn some stuff before

but I mostly

but yeah why this thing I decide to

start crying

I don't I I don't know I just felt like

I want to draw a lot of tea

[Music]

for me I can see my I mean I felt like

I wouldn't be able to do that

Friday

but then I just try it and knit one

point I mean I

[Music]

arguably

if I may

wouldn't say like my drawing is

that good

[Music]

I mean no it's good but like

there's a lot of awkward things I don't

think the face should be and I can't

point at the screen I don't have a

pointy

[Music]

I should have pointy

[Music]

let me find it one day

now I can't find a good point so

ignorance

I want to find like a rabbit pointy

but since I can't find that

I just ignore it

I mean this is

wait

I have a good idea

foreign

I actually have a really cute idea

this is this is just for fun

and after I ended it I can use it more

difficult

and then I of course have team

foreign

Bell

here is the face

the only thing I noticed is the shading

is a bit off between tone and it's even

supposed to say that I like I mean yes

uh

still a pointer

um yes

black outlines but the other one says

color that line I wanted to keep that

another detail but

and only

and lonely has a

shading which I didn't include

but that

what was that

this one should be locked

no no so yes so there's the gradient

still

which

I added because it looked away without

it but it says

it's not my voice

but it still seems I don't think I made

good

like this weird wave that looks weird

and I don't feel like

it just doesn't look there's a lot of

small details and it just look weird to

me

but this whole ear here

and oh of course this spiral looks

terrible

you can maybe

so yeah there's many things I

next a lot of the lines looks wobbly and

amateur which I am I mean I'm a chair

drawing but it's fine

and then

do you think

[Music]

this picture

does show it the best

your your artist bag is acting up

which artist punch

like I think

yeah this hand is the worst

[Music]

and and yeah I like this ear he looks

terrible I think

[Music]

and the shoulder hair doesn't look great

and like how this arm is this that's it

that is terrible

and I don't think like it does this card

doesn't go correctly and this card

probably shouldn't have it that short

but yeah the Legacy doesn't look like

proper probably in the food this food

looks terrible like this is small here

it's big yes I mean I don't think you

have to worry about

how bad you draw

because

all these terrible things is not going

to

bother people in the end anyway

well why try to make it again in the

future Indonesia yeah I I hate I mean I

if I if I feel like it

that's what I said about the emails I

want to redraw the emails

[Music]

we draw every emote because as the more

emails I make the better I'm getting it

[Music]

then I have this beautiful thing here

[Music]

from Arctic games blue means I have

fully completed 100 although

in Crash Bandicoot 3 you can't I only

got gold you can get a high rating but

that's not really considered 100 in the

game so I could go beyond that

so I am interested in

or playing every game

so I made this beautiful team

but yeah

so I hear today I have completed stories

that's one screen but I'm going for 100

it's like six more

12 more things to pick up and then I

will make it blue

was a weird game yeah I did fully

completed so

it

but technically never complete that

which is in here spider dragon on PS1 I

did fully completed 100

Dragon but the game just locked up

I could play it on my PlayStation 3. and

then complete it that way it just

wouldn't look just nice and I wouldn't

be able to use the really nice

controllers

I really need to figure out how I should

make it work but I could play play the

second game on PS1

but it's technically did not played the

reignited to just complete 100 without

doing any kind of challenge

that should probably do that when I get

the Amber mod released

I think that sounds like a good idea

and similar for crash or completed crash

one two and three and centrally and I

make it not lock two things here

as if that's an option

I don't think okay is an option

to do that

get that out pretty much enabled by the

way I don't think that's an option

make it or whatever doesn't matter

so I still have the PS1 version of the

crash games today

[Music]

one name

I like this point as you probably

haven't black outline something since a

bit more

in midnight

hmm

okay I need uh no I didn't want to do

that

I also it's fun to do that

no and then again

that thing is gone

and have things done

yes hello kitten it's a carrot pointing

second point I think this is cute and

freak for life

without carrot

and then we have Princeton H2

your neighborhood someone took race rage

I mean it's quite a common username

I think I think

but he picked a different Discord name

which I'm obviously not going to say on

the stream that's up to you and

is

different that's okay point point point

then I can bring it up and hide it

whenever I need to

yeah like I said for a

shiny

which which her name is now

okay

oh she actually went shiny the photo

room

oh she actually didn't change her

this good name but that should be a

twitch name

that's the one she wanted to use before

it was occupied

thank you

and that's

I guess that's a topic too regarding

usernames

because which is the whole thing about

I'm not going to argue about the whole

thing about it the Disco listening thing

just

don't care either way but um

but people argue about how their

usernames are taken and so on but the

the use names I see people argue about

being taken seems to be quite irregular

needs

I mean yes it is a shame that if you

manage to get your username on one

platform but not on another platform yet

I didn't get pumped on the bonbon on

Twitch which on Twitter and but I do

have it on Twitch Reddit

Discord

[Music]

other platforms

and oh hello tells the pineapples

do you slice pineapple and toast them

hello hello welcome

but the thing is what I wanted to say

about these names you have to come up

with a username that is more unique you

can't just pick something common

but please you need to plan to handle

this Stickman Games it will be fun yes

I should do that someday I will do that

and I will let you know please call me

thirsty

yeah

yeah no problem I was going to come over

toasty

I just like to

welcome people by the full name

or pineapples

no

I can't call it

but yeah I usually send down to some

kind of nickname this is quick and easy

even though I like to say one of these

these names this is not the funniest

thing to be fair

Alexandra Campion

might not be here

anyway that's

like three words and a number

and that's certainly going to be

available basically everywhere

if someone has almost intentionally

stealing it today

his name is

and that's his name there's the

pineapples it's also likely going to be

available in a lot of platforms

foreign

girl which was the previous name on

Twitch

don't end with some numbers I think I

don't

to change to

Channel

oceanity pottery

remember

which he did

and that name is available and she

should probably reprint herself as that

name on every platform

if she wants a consistent seasoning guys

not everyone want that then that's fine

and I kept seeing people like say so

things like

yeah I have my public username on

Twitter or something but I don't want to

use that on my Discord well don't use

them

and then they might argue like

but in that case someone else might take

that pretend to be me but you can create

a second Discord account which is that

name so you can occupy it

but you don't have to use it

and then you have your private Discord

account you used to talk to people

[Music]

but uh yeah I don't see

[Music]

and since this code had yeah

of course not recommended Discord has

the accounts opportunity

yeah I just feel like people making

videos

but that's just my opinion

[Music]

that makes sense

happy work it's been pretty [ __ ] today

so anyways yeah it's been

it's

I'm happy you find it me around

have a nice day

hope everything goes well as much

[Music]

[Music]

so yeah

and I was going for you kitten

here here very cute right now okay

[Music]

other people are probably not find me

cute though

[Music]

if my drawing was good I mean I

think this is it it kind of feels weird

to me because the thing is I don't feel

like I'm drunk good and honestly

[Music]

because when I look at

in this drawing this was the very first

emote I made another software I made a

whole other drawing

[Music]

and then I looked at

me

[Music]

wait where's the

[Music]

this furnace

all right

I'm looking at your house all day hey

let's see

then I compare it to

[Music]

me

oh that one is small can I

can resize it

let's size it in same size like that

okay emails are small so this is going

to be blurry and but yeah

I'd say

comparing these two

and aside from the pluriness so I mean

sure okay

I could try to make it a bit same size

another person on this side there is

same size

no longer blurry

and now mine looks like she'd have to

I think my emote looks very bad

compared to like a competent artist

what is my pointy

like the pointer is very large maybe I

should make it smaller

[Music]

uh there is now half size

a bit annoying

it gives me exact pixels but I wanted to

have have it in size

haircuts yes type 50 as that

I said bye

so anyway so yeah I said like the hands

here I find looking horrible the hair

tough that I feel like should have been

different like operatified compound has

like the arms this is basically fingers

on top of arms there's no hands

basically

the mouth look weird

the whole head looks shifted like the

neck is quite incorrectly positioned the

whole head looks very Blobby

there's a lot of things I could

criticize about this picture

and

[Music]

so

that's why I find my art to be terrible

but

[Music]

I'd say that over the course of drawing

these emotes this time I should have a

point because this is ground software

let's say that's my skills has improved

like certainly

this one looks better than this one

so if you if you just continue drawing

more and more

you're going to be Barry because that's

basically how getting better works

foreign

people find it cute and yeah they are I

yeah they are cute

so that that's the

that's an important distinction like

and I'm not saying they aren't cute I'm

just saying they're

[Music]

like

aren't really in the sense of badly

drawn

it can be cute and Badly Drawn at the

same time

it's like cute

are you saying I'm badly drawn

I know that's not what he said

but I had opportunity

so I took it

no

I know that's not what you meant

but I took the opportunity

[Music]

you know what I mean yes

so just

give it your best just

just draw

because

another part of drawing is the technique

as you might notice if you've seen my

drawing here

because what I've seen is that when

people draw they try to try to draw the

final line out immediately that seems to

be the common error people do

in that case I can understand it's not

looking that great it wouldn't look that

great if I tried that

maybe you can teach me one day I mean

look at how I draw I'm I'm trying to

figure out how to draw a base by just

looking at how other people draw

oh my

goodness

speak out

something then

let's pick up this one let's be a bit

risky

[Music]

so I made the original sketch so okay so

this is the original sketch it looks

terrible I mean

you might argue no it doesn't look

terrible but that's the thing

the other thing that's the thing with

doing a sketch even if you try to do

this but yourself and it's the same when

I did the sketch

yeah when you do the sketch it will in

some for some reason it looks better

than when you finally are when you are

done with the final obviously the clean

lines looks better than the sketchy

sketchiness of the sketch but for some

reason the sketch looks better than the

final artwork incense of

our things

like when you look at it when you look

at the sketch and imagine where the

lines would go

it looks better than the fine line art

and multiple artists have sent this

so it's just an effect

but then you get the next step and it's

not clean up yet and then I do the

cleanup phase which I

[Music]

if you need

deceptive hold up

this is

a fun

yeah we can

we can do some art learning

and of course the two biggest factors is

to begin

most people some people like

have the mentality of I'm terrible at

this

yeah because you never do it you haven't

ever done it of course you're not going

to be good at this but if you give it a

try but no I don't want to give it a try

because I'm terrible at it

yeah I mean

you're never going to be good at it

because you're turning because you'll be

that's attitude

[Music]

and never go with the girl with that

kind of attitude

so you have to stop having that attitude

which can be hard of course I mean

[Music]

but yeah yeah you have to overcome that

because that has been nothing like

when I try to like

please ever play video games with people

and people are people say two things in

that case like one either they have

played the game and they say like I bet

I'm terrible at the game

but yeah yeah I get that but

but it's not about being termless Jamie

is it I mean if it's still fun to play

and plus you can get better at it if you

give it more some more attempts

or they say like

what's up Sam's gonna say are you shy

the other thing

is

[Music]

yeah the other thing is I don't know how

to play the game therefore I don't want

to play the game but I can teach you

it's not hard

[Music]

some things are hard

[Music]

interpret that as you like

[Music]

[Music]

he can teach me a lot and I'm willing to

teach him

thank you

for a small finial

foreign

you have done so much for me so

I am willing to do it for free

[Music]

and also

some people ask me if I draw with a

mouse or something no this is a drawing

tablet if I would try to do this with

the mouse

it wouldn't look this great

so yeah so it is kind of like the

investment you have to make if you're

going to do art a drawing tablet there

are cheap alternative you don't have to

cover a really expensive one if you have

someone who has a drawing tablet you can

learn that helps

like that's

and the drawing tablet I'm using at the

moment is actually my blood restoring

tablet but no one was using it

and you got it because

[Music]

no

but but it was a cheap one

thank you

and I have considered upgrading but

because I can better for anything

that's not going to happen it still

works

and it's fine

[Music]

I don't really need to okay

[Music]

[Music]

that's why I love you

the kitten

[Music]

I love the every little thing you don't

because it doesn't work as great because

that's a song

I really just think she does

it's magic

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

that if you like

I'd rather you help me with

another

issue I'm having at the moment

I really not happy

to help me with the drawing tablet

probably fine with this one

oh I know what you mean

you might not know what I mean

but I can type T I can write you what I

mean

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

other plan I have

[Music]

which I just need to decide

[Music]

come up with which day it will occur on

um

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

did life is spawned on his heart right

now

but it will get better soon as

things will change for me

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

work around it

I will make it work

change

spontaneousness

yeah I have some fun

this is going to be so weird

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

okay

um

[Music]

since I have that one

nice pieces

yeah provided by chin hop

incredits in the about page

[Music]

I tried to pick up pick out

very specific size

a lot of the songs on that side is

very similar this is a very

particular way

because they want like Lo-Fi

music

but like almost every song sounds the

same

like I get this low-fi but it's

certainly a bit wider

genre of music

that probably

skip that to 90 of his audience

difficult one step

you're pleasing to me

[Music]

I really wish I could have its sandwich

songs playing

[Music]

but sadly

which is what I did

on my birthday stream

that was using a vmc as a plane

[Music]

I would take like listening and see as

the player but as I built in the tune

and obvious and

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

but like my

head choice of music

eyes outside

looks different but can't really play

but you still not play that on the

Stream

[Music]

but there will be the one there

it is

[Music]

you wanna see anyone

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

something

is it the twos but I don't think it

would fit in here

like I said

basically I have to find

are they

[Music]

to do the herpes thing probably at the

hair feel better

currently I just

foreign

so now it wouldn't be such a great idea

[Music]

but it would be fun as soon as I say

get to do it

[Music]

I will

feel better when

get things changed

[Music]

I never remember if I said it doesn't

swim but

I'm going to move

so as soon as I'm able to get that ready

[Music]

to finish up the remaining stuff I have

to finish up here

then when I get ready

removing I'm probably going to eBay

probably finishing up remaining stuff

let's finish up here

I can't wait for something else

[Music]

and then

[Music]

[Music]

that's probably when I because then I

didn't have to worry about the things

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

okay

hello great

to thank you for the evening

okay fun fun

Charlie's back

yes I enjoy near me

I was trying to type a message to

someone here

[Music]

you have to

after

the one I'm done streaming

stuff like that

come back to this thing so uh

eat at 15

I'm glad you're happy I'm happy to see

people

[Music]

I'm happy to see more people search when

like Jake and Charlie of course I'm very

happy to see kitten that's not going to

change of course

it's great to see it's great to see

great here

is that

the other tracker is following hello

Draco or yeah Draco I guess

[Music]

um

it's just boring message

stream is basically still on the

development

but I'm happy

you are here

so for the concentration of this drawing

sometimes I

I hope

things are great with you

all good yeah I'm getting great

and yeah I prefer to follow when the

person's day for proof that I followed

and stuff

apparently it shows up in the list

regardless

for example

[Music]

after the

rain

yeah after the rain yesterday and I read

it iriela

Ariella followed me back

and then

I was on another stream and another

streamer

Chase Anthony started follow me

just randomly

so I got this I mean sure it does I

guess it's not proved to anyone else

there I guess you got the point about it

anyways hey

prom dresses yes you can use the redeems

to change the outfit

anyways I was pretty excited seeing a

bunch of tech support and oh you're

working Facebook

yeah I can imagine exporting

whoops

anyway

she

yeah

that's it

hope you have a friends

thank you

no you should probably sleep

I can imagine

you haven't been sleeping for a while no

I don't work six four oh

don't touch the word safe one I had to

do something for doing my own stuff oh

self self tech support

I can imagine that being quite annoying

too

helping another person at least you

probably know what to do because most

people have problem with common stuff

but solving something yourself yeah

that's when you don't know what is going

on

yeah that should be annoying

I mean helping other people is annoying

too because some people can be quite

it's annoying when you try to help me

some people

it's not like

a person is fine

nice and all that stuff it's just

helping them with tech support parts

that

it gets annoying

but I can look over that

[Music]

they have something that was so easy to

do in the past it's not more complicated

but it feels like hacking

yeah some some stuff and I can't think

of anything else though

especially what do you do like only

games that certainly

could be the case

I got to go back to work have a good

steam I got kids stuff ready I love you

have fun

goodbye kitten have fun

love you

nice to see you on the Stream

[Music]

it's me happy every time I see you

even if I just express it so much I'm

better to expressing my feelings

that's a problem I have

and then he get a super Friday let's do

like

I'm probably going to be

who

posts pictures like on what's going on

sometimes

takes one as a picture I meant photos

the photos he takes

kinda are a mean pictures in themselves

obviously I'm not going to post them

publicly or sharing them only

unless I get his permission

[Music]

attack

quite mean about

um

if she ever didn't really mean something

you can make it a real template

you can come up with a new meme which

consists of this catch for me

[Music]

oh

[Music]

I

[Music]

challenge you to come after attention

you mean

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

what does my thing look like

anyway it will be added to what they

mean and what is called no you mean

[Music]

and then it will be sourced to my stream

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

and then

in the

in the Stream itself I'm saying I hope

that a challenge people to make it I

rest of your stream I will talk to you

tomorrow but I hope you have a good day

I love you bye

thank you for sharing up kitten I love

you too bye bye

[Music]

and I hope work goes when

laughs

this tale will be the rest of the

streaming

I'm trying over and over and already

[Music]

so let's detail I'm not confused

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

where's my load rate by the way

[Music]

a load rate is when I

eat something

or when I go to the bathroom

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

to make

and I'm actually happy that it didn't

turn out to be quite bad either

I didn't say either

at the same time

doesn't neither neither do I say neither

neither I don't know

be very meaning I don't know which is

more popular words

like I'm most losing like I think it's

like South British

pronunciation

mixed with like Swedish

and other

differently and but I don't know what

situation they prefer

[Music]

but I do find it funny to say

don't

my Northern British

because the boat

exactly pretty pronunciation but it's

close to the British pronunciation the

Northern British

position

and in Swedish it is also bought

[Music]

in Swedish

and it's also the

English word for what the English word

bought

when you have bought something and now

you are in the position of it

which is nothing it was the actual word

I was looking for was both

which I I just say about because I mean

but

another Stone

instead of stone

[Music]

and they finally finding system

and that's that's a whole uh topic I was

talking about with somebody streaming

with my

like point across probably

it was the whole idea of doing an accent

when I speak English I basically have to

do do an accent because I have to learn

how to pronounce things in English

and I have to teach

some pronunciation

[Music]

and the sure I could

pick any just that I've heard so much

consumed so much British media that

I'm gonna sometimes

more used to the beach pronunciation of

things

[Music]

I can say the word

they like go tomorrow and things like

that

I want to know how to say it in it

different way

[Music]

tomorrow

tomorrow

[Music]

[Music]

come back

I don't know

looks like another one this is a bit

annoying being turned into

bunnies

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

me

yeah one of the music

I like somewhat amazing I like

is the music in

motor race boat racism is a racing game

but I should maybe I should play that

so that's also

the third game

[Music]

[Music]

it made it a lot

game
