welcome to another day
by you
are here State Street
this is a forest come soon
stopped
so it's the uh
last or
next to last
or something I've been playing it for 11
hours
let's be
story I do remember this story
I should
um
like that
Stone
I've just
twitch says that there are no viewers at
the moment
apparently
and I'll continue yeah I'm gonna see if
people show up
should I just stay
the volume of that
might use eyes no
all right it's one of these yeah
thank you
yeah they must have decided at this part
of the game that enemies should give you
the gems as soon as the test animation
starts
while
before that
they decided that you should get the
gems after the death animation ends
foreign
before any Community checks
using
oh it's another ball thing but what was
it called again
ball Gadget
a ball can't get
[Music]
yeah I don't know
and make it Pink
[Music]
I should have probably made it pink at
that point
all right it's the best
I see
I see wait
this might not be the
oh
okay I'm not really sure I'm supposed to
get past this
so if I jump that doesn't work
if I don't do anything it apparently
Waits
okay don't do anything
and then apparently I should jump on
this one
burning
okay now I can't just do that
okay now it works
I'm supposed to take the other out
yeah because I hear something
oh thank you came
so fast okay I can't react
I guess we have to wait through a few
seconds for this thing to be working in
there we go
okay I got it
foreign
I hope this is just a bonus area and I
get back from here
[Music]
sometimes I can't just run through it
actually points I don't have to go
through that again
and that's an egg
no uh wait yeah
that's what it comes from
two and I couldn't even see that one is
it even possible to see it
okay I mean that was just me that's the
acting
oh yeah and then I also asked it I see
you must be able to do this multiple
times
I forgot about two of them
[Music]
a nice curling out of the level
I could have landed in it I mean I will
be taking the wrong direction I guess
can't spend his View
not much time to react to it
so the the whole
thing I'm back in the same place
no
I'm not starting to go back
I don't know
oh okay good
but I probably have to go maybe they
haven't seen to get back anyway
feel free to browse by Finders
foreign
oh perfect timing
[Music]
I need to know that it locked Pizza
diversity is
defrost that one
you know logically it would be better if
you just defaulted
last one you used
Okay so
[Music]
to the one
like a good dragon
nice
this is probably something I can do with
that or maybe it's just a timing thing
[Music]
okay
very stinky very clear this whole area
and that's Miss likely that
it doesn't add more
over here
I'm gonna freak out
yeah yes double checking
oh there's something else
oh
purchase
wait sir
so each place has their own account
except these two cases they have the
same count
Ries
[Music]
now I never went to that one so it
doesn't activate it sadly so I had to go
through this thing
oh well I should have
done that
but I guess it didn't it's like
like I didn't go here
not shifting something here
cards
okay
I guess it was a good thing I went back
here and
thank you
I'll ask him I passed away with that
now it's way in there
oh it's so sorry completely ignore the
chance for it for this sometime
playing the games again huh yeah
I play
I I am playing
and I hear stay every Thursday and
Friday
as I mentioned before
so
I think I care about this area
this is not a fun track to go and all
the minor fours are actually same
collection hell is yeah I really should
like
informable
and I don't see why I did anything could
have just not done it
also the ball gag has two dragons and
two night teams well I think I found
foreign
I mean
but
playing with it
this camera
that's what I mean
I
don't got it
just let me fail a little less here and
we'll see
I've got to jump okay naps I didn't see
like you had much fun trying to find
what you said I don't know I haven't
even tried finding it out yet
so
I'm just trying to get through
at the moment
because I failed to get to the
foreign
trick but
it's so unfair because it's based on
memorization more than unless the first
time you go then it's just I'm fine
get no time to react
anyway back here
nice and that's not the stone I can
destroy
well
okay I haven't done anything with this
So currently
I do have three eggs
and three light gems
so let's see how many exist in this area
of course I don't don't know how many I
found on the track
all right
but I need to find the dark gem
or Crystal or something
now hi hello
and also hello everybody I didn't say
hello to you
I'll get you a text
there is a common bug you might want to
look out for I haven't said that to her
before but sure if you accept the light
gem challenge of a mini game immediately
after receiving the Dragonite you might
not say correctly and you list it
forever
okay
let's say it now because this is later
again that many games like a smart
cousin after getting drunk okay that is
good now
foreign
what does this one contain
I like him
perfect
excuse me
approaching
the ice power up is too powerful
another one of these
well it doesn't instantly kill enemies
it allows you to instantly it hey
it allows you to easily kill enemies and
is also as far as I can tell the only
one you can use for second enemies
should it be something on this one
at least this one
and let's continue
thank you for the warning it's uh it's
quite a good to be able
basically waiting for it to finish
saving right
this yeah this looks like a bonus area a
judging by the shape on the map or the
other one looks like a corridor to the
next area
that platform is where the Visa
teleported if it gets too close
oh
I never get a fight that we search
what's the point of it we said Why Can't
This Be
I have so many questions I hope they
have a question about Kings
sometimes games make decisions that
to me it doesn't make sense
you have to say
[Music]
I did I do speak for my personal
experience but I can add to me
we can about it but anyway
regardless
I think that was all we put that there
yeah
there was a spawns minions and then this
is interlivion
oh a sign oh no I signed
[Music]
right
wrong way oh
I already got this one
well I guess I just have to do this
you know I usually find valuable stuff
in these places
yeah but do you know what you said to
you Hunter Hunter told me what he said
to him
I see I still like the question do you
want to try for Dragon Age
I'm very stunning
and Amber standing in front of Sergeant
Perez you want to try for a dragon egg I
don't think they're compatible but sure
this is an adult Channel by the way
anyone below 18 should not be here
if it's usually the hardest one in the
game but sometimes you can catch him in
his absolutely long turnaround animation
yeah
I've noticed that
they uh
plastic right and that's a shifting
button uh they have really really nice
General animations and if you can take
advantage of that
but you can easily catch them
oh I didn't need running them
fine
I won't go to the gym
this tunnel seems dangerous
this is all the matches and then
then money oh oh oh but is this a boss
doesn't die
I did it
and now you shall be rewarded
adult Channel
wait Sparks can't even eat those
butterflies
are they finally getting revenge against
him
apparently
[Music]
um
you're only one Dragon egg
okay something up there do you want to
try for a light Cam that seems even more
biologically impossible but sure yeah
the demo of the mini games doesn't go up
to the game it feels a bit random yeah
it feels like in the middle of the game
they are the hardest
that kind of hard it starts
and then they become easier and it's not
because I'm getting used Too Many Games
obviously because
maybe I am because they are fine okay
he's actually getting into them now
let me get through
those shoot buttons to shoot twice as
fast
at least yeah because it's it's level
without the doors opening and closing
that one is really really annoying
that should be one of the latest
foreign
bus time
I can't cheat me
can't I
need to defeat this okay now
[Music]
all right I mean I have one anyway
so
also that bus at the end is probably
some weird after the test it doesn't do
anything and you don't have to sheet
stand yeah or you'd never get all the
dragon eggs or like gems you need
are you weird
you really really weird I got everything
beautiful
so well I'm sorry I broke your legs very
no no not this way
title over here
sorry
this way right yes
now how does that I'll talk two Sparks
again for a funny line
okay I mean he's not funny but sure
there's nothing else
I didn't know
if you refer to something else
because I assumed that wasn't the line
you're looking for
this that's not
so anyway
maybe it was a different
meaning game
hey what happened I was push back on
this moving
increase the freeze the lava to ice
you can do it
if you respect him after getting the
dragon egg he says I can't say no to his
fire
I wish I could that's yeah
probably yeah probably if you say no I
have to light him and then taught him
again I guess
is that like every sign or
specifically that one
yeah these are moving I didn't pay
attention
time to Quick real dragon
you know what I have never eaten a
grilled dragon
moving platform no enemies no obstacles
just
clearly moving platforms where's the
what's the fast forward button
now so the
ninth
black line living with announcement
[Music]
very that's it
um pieces X2 yeah yeah I'm playing I'm
playing on the actual Hardware so yes
so that's that's not an option
it was kind of a joke
I mean half a joke I mean if the
PlayStation 3 that does have a speed up
button for placing two games that would
be any keychain
ah near me wait I've seen this there's a
new this is risking of an existing enemy
right
okay so this enemies also drop the gems
after they disappear
okay okay
this
actually I got it thank you
guys
ah worthless chest
four five uni 45 Legends level this door
to the secret area
oh
this one looks scary
and that was easy
wait let's see some ice
now that's the wrong button I press and
paste I press the flame button it was
the wrong button
okay
I see I used two people just stimulating
the game your capture is looking good oh
thank you uh normally I would I would
expect people to uh upscale it some
emulator which is the benefit of course
but um where am I going in I'm not I'm
not I'm better to explore this area
wait am I going back I am going back
and but yeah I would say people I would
see people upscale it to so it looks
sharper which I haven't because it's the
it should be original resolution
and there are five types of discrete
enemies and two unused ones oh
unused
sounds exciting
I think
they shouldn't
wait why must
all right so this is an empty room just
meant to be like a labyrinth
you almost did that oh no that would be
terrible if I cheat
I don't want to do that
oh there we go
[Music]
yeah I'm trying to do this White
glitchless
because my goal is to
complete the games as intended
I mean
not like wait is this all
I can't guess this is this is all they
have in this area
wait what's
when bumping into so much
but what's going on
come on all right now there is more
stuff
I'm going to die
[Music]
but as long as I pick up the lighting
first
thank you
wait a minute
why is that not a secret
there are a few surfaces in these final
levels that is completely intangible
it's not very easy skips yeah I've seen
some some of that I don't know which
they are and I'm probably not even going
to test them out them
I'm just going to try to do it
legitimate
that's intended it's more fun
no
[Music]
I'm tired already
as you can see when is that meter going
to disappear
and that was close
but close
no one shoots a hair close thank you
is that a Dutch expression thing
of course I don't know how to say
nothing in Spanish
sorry I'm near just working
such a buggy enemy
I don't know I can use the story Rock
without easy
I guess I can just pick it up I don't
really use them the only time I use them
is when I accidentally used them
what was that rocket like before I even
saw it
saw me
excuse me
[Music]
that was rude
now I have to start out oh
I'm gonna yeah I should go now I'm going
the wrong way
wait what
that's what am I doing
so that's back
that's foreign
oh
okay
no come back
yeah
come on pick it up
wait isn't that
incredible scenes in that should have
the face now it
of his voice
very different
please don't shoot me this time
try to shoot me
but I was trying to shoot me again
like how am I supposed to
oh
I see
I mean I can't just jump around the
teeth
subscribe
yes yes you can I was I was actually
going to say that in server but about it
like and today you can come and watch my
stream and just have your cozy Friday
with with pumpkin
and my continuing level yeah I should
probably go back to that place
stop spinning around
spinning around more and more the
further into the game I go
this game is so weird
so
can you like
no
I was thinking here yeah this is a very
clever like jumping side to side with us
around another thing
oh wait it might be to this thing
yeah this that's wrappers
okay that isn't much
icework in it
the anime is definitely gets really
annoying towards the end of the skin in
here yeah you don't say
okay
Kelsey that sounds good
can you
please stop thank you thank you for
freezing it let me finish it I wanted to
destroy these things now I want this
thing hopefully it contains something
important
foreign
which is important because I'm looking
to get 100
and next thing is to get after
let's see
well sorry I need help
I think I have an idea
does this work no it's not working
okay I thought that was clever
can I still think I was clever
but I mean unless I did it wrong I mean
that's awesome
so okay now I definitely tested that
let's see so there is an area in there
okay
where am I
switch page
so it's between there so it doesn't seem
to be like a secret passage there and is
it some secret it doesn't show up on the
map
that's a possibility
and this music
well
I'll continue and see what shows up
what
now
don't do that
tackled by uh
something
I don't remember what element was
[Music]
why does he say that
excuse me that was very rude of you
today
like also if it's moving so slowly why
can you move it so quickly anyway when I
get close
I mean it's a clever way of attacking
but it doesn't make sense
thank you
what are you doing
again
let's stop doing that
oh I see
what
why is there something jump here how did
it get there
what made it spawn over there
why why are the floating green gems
what is going on with this game
okay
and also
a
didn't do that
and also getting to seek a platform and
then getting like 50 gems or how many
that was
foreign
anything over here
press according to the map there's a
whole area here but
maybe it isn't anything the map you
can't stress the man
it's
sometimes a GM's model detaches from its
object instances it's probably got a lot
inside the wall then you broke it
when you broke your chances up
perfect that was wrong way
Justin
[Music]
the game is breaking more and more the
further along I get oh no
you got spared wait
there we go
normally I'd be freaking out right now
desperate to get underground but for
some reason I don't feel that bad maybe
that's because you're already
Underground
hey
you're right should I explore below
ground
but you are already on the ground
so how are you going to
explore
so you're going to explore under and
you're getting around okay
if you want to try for the dragon egg no
this is very inappropriate
oh no not blink the animals were
probably painted these things
screenshots from a level that took easy
to see how they could have accidentally
included some non-explorable areas
makes sense they should have done like
the Collision model or something no I
mean I mean it makes sense that like if
you have an open area even if you can't
explore to hold up an area it's still
open and open area on the map
[Music]
and whatever I don't need gems
all I need is for him to die
there you go
underground section
okay
no more
okay
that clearly doesn't work
I need
a different thing
to do here
wait a minute
if I'm going
I mean and then what I'm doing at the
moment
you should freak out I mean you're an
active volcano or something
it seems quite
okay you can't get after just a stupid
jump it seems like a situation where in
which is quite freak outable so
come on
oh there's anything behind
quickly punch the giant spiders
there you go
and I didn't get any bombs
punch it
but but no bumps
oh
I feel like this is going to be an
annoying level
oh I wait I mean what's the point of
that platform then
what is going on in this level
huh
can I say 100 speed or inside me when
reaching this level
foreign
I'm already not happy
hey speedrun stretch
wait a minute I still don't have bombs
finally
now I just need to remember the bomb
button
so
um
oh yeah and then I have to get back all
the way
hey
good
Ness
I should have picked up the checkpoint
bits
[Music]
after destroying the gym or something no
I mean it's something way do you see it
doesn't matter any
lesson 90 kick back
probably
okay
huh
perfect
[Music]
I tried to attack me
foreign
[Music]
giant spiders
definitely
oh you lose the chance oh and then this
place
did everybody go back all the way
okay
that's such a he has such a slow
exploration that's why
yeah it's
yep
you want to continue
well
no but
do I have my choice
okay
[Music]
set
quite a level
wait where are you going oh yeah
mate doesn't seem to be a jam up here
nice
one day I want to go but
no shopping
wait a minute
oh yeah it was the first gem
because I didn't get to keep those
orders so I will just
be experiments these lemons are so slow
Dutch no no
anyway
hmm
now let's find this
foreign
a lot of spiders okay
it's been life
hey at least there's no phone damage
I know I don't have to walk after them
but at least I'm sure I'm not missing
them
I didn't mean to say that
I want to make sure this area is clean
by the main
yeah the store has been lined though
that would be giant spiders
come on platform
anytime now
oh there you are
yeah but did I spell it correctly yes
that you did
what
I'm waiting down here
foreign
run
okay so in the previous area had those
two and then there was that suspicious
big one which might have this is that
one did that missing
questions
I think it dessert
I'm going to pick up the checkpoint
because
reasons
oh yeah oh yeah I know what I should do
here no waiter yes I can do it
up
I should play it safe
it's the motion of this thing is so
weird it moves at the constant speed
until it gets these two points and then
it
gets a little something
come on let me let me land first
[Music]
perfect
and then I have an idea for how to get
to the last place
is
dearly
and it's safer
by taking this off route
cheese it cheese it okay is it
is
now cheesy cheesy
I like cheese I like cheese too
put
I know how to make cheese and I don't
oh
Probably sounds able to give a stalk of
wait why are you giving a tutorial
now
[Music]
yay
my name is Amber
you're already wondering if you want to
try for like gym
no but
dark shards
okay back here back again
[Music]
okay Seth that actually fell behind that
fractured rocks
this is remember what fraction was
but then I remember that
the name of her fractured heels in
Swedish
since I made that much
for that
which I'm still waiting for are slight
code update by someone
foreign
which
maybe I should care of this area first
but let me try
this area first
hey
and also I forgot that this was here
I technically didn't have to
thank you
and then I just need to cross this
because I didn't finish off with that
one
that's fine
because I can just do that
apparently
first try
well I mean you could argue I've done
two trades before and from the other
direction but
I just ran across the whole thing
it's just trying to cross that was
singing and I made it
somehow
and if you've seen on my
since we're waiting for these slow stuff
anyway
my
[Music]
Discord survey I put up a
picture of which games I've done
oh wait there's no
same
maybe this
on this picture
there you go same picture
this is the full picture then I hope so
[Applause]
again you take points for that
good and Tippy
I'm platform here and yes
a lot of radiation going on here
hello I am here welcome Kitty
I'm happy could join
no what are you doing stupid spider
let's just got up
dancing foxes
happy foxes
that was shooting in Spanish
I don't really like this
what drop one please
I don't feel like this level is larger
when he did the second time around
I guess
I'm on lunch break sounds good
I hope you have a nice lunch
Hannah
and this place up here seems no it is
more
he eats more they might be
bomb dispenser here
dancing bunnies do you want a dancing
bunny
is run like this but
no bomb dispensary
oh my
the spiders are back
come on
[Music]
well if I'm not down here anyway
[Music]
that's right
in the end of that
having broiled mold for dinner tonight
oh hey you're playing that one character
that I can't ever remember to think
blink Blinky no blink
what did everyone thinking
see I still probably don't remember that
isn't worth the memory don't worry
that's exact time that's why you don't
remember
nice stupid spiny
your memory is intentionally
suppressing
the memories of
blink
oh yeah I got this from up here
I see
that doesn't work
that kind of death
anyway I just got the
SE
hey that's good it's been a fun day
yesterday night oh what did you do next
yesterday night
oh I actually died
that was so fun
should you spy this
shitty thing you can actually shoot
don't shoot as many times
very simple
no
hey
in my name if my eyes didn't need to
constantly require being cleaned and
moisturized by a sweeping motion of the
eyelids I wouldn't remember his name I
mean if you didn't need to Blink you
wouldn't remember pink
we almost had a tornado last night only
87 chance of that happening but the
weather was so cool and amazing also so
attorney
[Music]
Ronaldo
I'm messing up it man
enough
in the timed
for fun wait is it timed
uh it's already not fun
and then you add a timer on it the
minigame will actually fail you after 30
minutes ah
it's that time I started minutes I feel
like this is the only level you'd ever
come to hitting that time limit I mean I
would definitely hit that time in it
I am terrible at this
this is the time I remember from the
checkpoint or
[Music]
what
especially if you have to backtrack
please remember
there is another
one down there
so if I get the one down here
foreign
there's another way through here too
it was just a lot of hot and cold air
moving around but other than that it was
fun all the Neighbors in the
neighborhood but just outside looking at
the sky waiting for that tornado
it's only when you're done at the dragon
egg light gem one already and yeah it
remembers time after it I will at least
it remembers
otherwise
I would definitely pay
oh good
but there's no on-screen timer it just
oh don't don't change direction like
that
how rude
change
now you're supposed to change direction
there you go
that was easy
oh
when you choose
okay
I didn't expect that to happen
like when I see him on
his casual toss about bomb
he doesn't seem to be
you know concerned that he's throwing a
whole bomb
when you choose to play for fun the
minigame gets the time in
and
and you can set your own best times oh
it's it's a time that counts up but it
will only count up the 30 minutes
you can you can have a timer but that
time it would only count up to 10
minutes
but you won't lose the level though
oh no this one's 13.
and there's one tattoo
well there's last two so that should be
easy
speaking of easy
not being able to land on bathrooms
ah
no cheese this time oh
that's sad
It's the weird canopy line
I didn't press anything
just it just fell off
dark shards 10 blink bomb
there's a blink bomb
for some reason
hey it's a weird caterpillar slug yeah I
don't know what's with them
I could hear your heart sink from the
head
yeah
excuse me excuse me
it's kind of fun
why do you have to meet
excuse me King I'm trying to play here
and get through the future we get
geometry
okay one more try
once more try all the last summer time
I just jump
I don't even need that thing
now
can I just jump down yeah
now let me destroy this
don't touch me
let's hear you
I did it
that was dangerous but I did it
yay
finally that took you why
how many times did you die
do you want to play again for the fun
yeah I'm gonna
say oh there
is this one in the correct term she is
in this situation
can I
oh no no I can't
so give me a short bucket
okay
okay some hydration
all right he wanted me to say dancing
bunnies in Swedish
dance
now you can try to write it
so let's continue
it was quite the uh
adventure with link
so let's continue
oh yeah dancing bunnies I forgot about
that yeah can I
I'm just gonna say I'm gonna die in here
okay
foreign
[Music]
well that's not much of a challenge is
it
now is it
[Music]
okay let's get back
foreign
can I
that wasn't what I wanted to do
wait why isn't it
unless it's showing me anything
what is going on
[Music]
well apparently it seems to be broken it
doesn't want to work
oh well
you don't get to see it
I wish I could see it and show it but it
just doesn't want to work
foreign
[Music]
why can't you just capture
like if you do uh
window capture why can't it just capture
the audio at the same time
and I'm sorry if I do a website capture
why didn't do anything
yeah whatever
freeze I mean
but
yeah at the moment
long Fox and cute and very yeah I wanted
to add
show a video
but um
it just didn't want to show anything it
just it wasn't even a blank page it was
nothing
and it was really weird
I can show it on like
website capture but then I have to
mess around with
109 first I got it right the second time
I still haven't fixed that
this is going to take a few times
to get them whenever he decides that
what they should freeze
I don't know I don't know what I'm doing
wrong
like
Mustang too far away probably
it's a bit picky about how close you
have to stand
what is it because I'm
too far from the stores probably I
probably need to be close to this voice
like that that accepts
what's that
sorry for vaccine but you can easily
jump past the first couple of pounds
yeah but in that case I will
I will
but like why can't you came because I
don't know
slipping through everything
[Music]
yes it's just a crazy idea I don't know
a hook shot oh
hello Papa wolf
also you need to hit pause with the
front half yeah
I haven't I've been doing that like
okay I guess that was I don't know
crazy
yeah oh yeah
foreign
[Music]
like that I guess I guess that was too
low but I mean still
sometimes it's very easy to do this
sometimes it's very hard to do this
[Music]
that one seems a bit too far away
wait a minute
[Music]
oh no
I didn't know to learn that I should
just have Lounge for a second
and patting the little fun fun
is struggling
[Music]
that's everything
yes
perfect camera
hello
rally [ __ ] bad
[Music]
welcome in
to the channel where I'm currently yes
completely fainting
is a deep linking for being a bit too
picky about how you do this stuff
like
the time you have to do the
trees
and jump on
it's a very short time eh
I do still feel like if you're clipping
through it it should register
I mean I'm not the programmer here
I do like it when
I like
programmer
things
it's perfectly okay for
play people play the game I made
that I can see the character
clip straight through the thing they're
supposed to grab onto
they're going to feel great about that
oh I see sometimes that's not going to
annoy them at all
okay so I assume
this is where I'm supposed to go but I
found the light gems I guess as you can
see
this one
no no no
uh well at least this wasn't hard I
guess
without saying yes you can use the eyes
as you're jumping towards it
I think it's more like
no
very particular way you have to
do this scene uh so because it goes this
way
wait what are we supposed to do up here
I mean there was a few games but games
are worthless
my reward is nothing
you can't sell
oh
and why can't I destroy these Stones I
mean where they aren't these exactly the
same as the other ones that them
supposed to start to progressed 11. ah
Charlie you're first thank you fantastic
that was the wrong one
I press the flame button
which costs
and they thought that they shouldn't be
on a checkpoint after all that
okay I think what they think you're
supposed to do is basically jump and
freeze at the same time
but jump closer to the thing
please watch me
but for all the platforming yeah
or I'll follow this platforming uh some
sportswear would be
suitable
like that
he's just
[Music]
sure exciting yeah
well at least I got stayed
Jam second just continue here
and this time I might remember to press
the
foreign
[Music]
Something tells me
is that bonus down here
and why is the target not a circle it's
a bit it's a bit stretched out
this atmosphere is like they made it for
like
they made made it to be super square and
they forgot that the TV isn't Square
it's 4x3
and also the team isn't 4x3 16x9 because
apparently in 2004 they didn't watch
screens
it is not that a hairstyle doesn't have
white skin support that's not the weird
part the weird part is how
enter the dragonfly has white skin
support
wait
nothing related to this scene
[Music]
can I checked out dragons are set fired
the second bird mini game
why would I want that
[Music]
time
okay
okay why would I watching myself with
even
more
I mean if it was like an extra level
that would actually be worse
okay stop shooting so much
thank you
oh yeah yeah right
oh yeah now he's shooting in
ah pressing this one this
oh there it is
well I should get up there somehow
it looks very big for full swinging
yeah I was going to ask Alice
wait a minute
[Music]
well I did it
that's what comes
now
why does the flying come so late
and it looks pretty second of me does it
does it look circulate here
it does I mean it's like around but it's
not like
it's an oval
because that's not a circle but it's
winded and it's tall
I mean that's the but wait give me a
moment
if I pick out the game
and change the aspect ratio on it to one
by one
this looks like a circle
but obviously the game is all squished
together now so yeah they must have so
as far as I can tell they have made the
red color in them one by one and then
you stretch it out on home screen
I mean
I mean that that really shows the
quality of this game I think
the explosives are here still actually
does have white skin supports it's the
man is
the money
it's there are many questions make it
clear the game wasn't designed with it
in mind
yeah
I mean
understandable
okay
okay Rollins welcome all right
everything is it's destroyed
it's usually pretty circular perhaps a
different pieces yeah
well yeah this is the PST version
[Music]
so and it's
not very exactly
that one
wait a minute
I think wait what's supposed to come
here
no I wasn't supposed to go here
all right back I go
foreign
try to turn around
but I jumped too early
there you go
now
I wasn't supposed to go in hanging
some way oh wait I see I see something
that's up here
thank you
okay actually probably he still has a
thinner frame buffer than GameCube
interesting well
and getting
learning more about the game
there's so much to learn about the game
and then I really don't get point of
this
button on each side of the door and you
can just open and close the door
whenever you want why not have the door
open and close when you approach it
this is our developer sing or something
like
it's level loading but doesn't make much
we need to slow you down so you don't
rush to 11 maybe maybe that's the reason
foreign
out of scanner range
no that's when you're going back
haven't been here yet
um
I don't like this and sound of this
Red's lamp
oratory
[Music]
okay stop shooting
yeah the devs worked hard to make sure
levels would load in time once you know
that he'll start notice lots of view
bands and puzzles just let the play Down
slim visibility yeah
like
that's that's what I've
gotta know but
I haven't
considered it
wait you can understand this
okay what does this thing
wait never continuing
yes
oh the point of the whole Auto scanning
range scene
oh timer
foreign
[Applause]
attached something
collided with something
where am I going okay so I enabled some
bonus in here that I should take care
first
okay
that's probably leaked on the ink
because I don't hear like them
oh yeah chest
which
is
350 Gems or so that's means 600 GMS or
so to buy the Lockpick
ah what a waste of chance
so I got nothing from that I actually
lost gems on that that was worthless the
worst
present ever and I jumped off
well that whole thing could be annoyed
him
hydrate that was that done
and I keep learning new things as well
for example I assumed exives respond if
you don't collect the egg and then they
even come back but apparently the game
actually saves the exposition appears
there when you come back oh that's
pretty neat so if you kill a thief I
come back this leg sleep is still dead
[Music]
it's pretty nice actually
why are these different why are this bad
why did this look like the platforms
that didn't do that bouncy thing
I didn't even press that
I mean I got money but are there any
more
of that to unlock
it's probably actually
56 thieves are so slow
there we go
[Music]
68
hello mister
there was a while ago
you can see more like Dead Sea yeah
Zoom
is tricky
and this lab I'd have just made the
doors open with a key
yeah that seems more reasonable but I
guess that's what you have to do if you
need
loading sounds
this is the loading Sound Room
wait where am I going
I took the long way here I am
yeah I definitely do it long way out
so I switch door
so yeah basically gonna see everything
oh wait this is the so progress I guess
considering the design of it
thank you
oops
so
let's
let's solve this magic person
and uh
I'm surprised nobody has analyzed that
already lower wise since it's supposed
to show the place obviously oh yeah
oh no I'm trapped
but
what's the what's the point of that
thing by the way
it's before you get to double jump you
can't enter that area
or leave the area
the minute
something is strange
am I
because
thank you
I am confused at the moment
um
lets me
floor this area
probably something obvious I'm missing
it's
eyes attack says I am silly
I see something
yeah this breaks the game streams
I mean it's it is green it's not red but
it is glowing and it looks dangerous you
shouldn't touch it
because there's another part of the game
where it is glowing but red and that one
you're not allowed to touch
so
but I guess glowing green is a locate
touch
even the trash says that you're not
allowed to just loving green
there's only glowing blue you're allowed
to touch they should have made it
I didn't do this
I can't do this
Maybe
maybe here should be the one to analyze
that or or every
of some of the Puffs in this level are
quite strange and hard to figure out I
think they were a bit pressed for time
yeah I know this definitely noticed that
this seems to be less polished than the
start of the game
is it going to okay I guess that works
okay
[Music]
okay
[Music]
why is it that uh flying just doesn't
work sometimes the same with loading
skin that one is also strange
yeah
that's
I do the double jump I hold the fly
button because that's how you fly in
this game
if you don't press fly when you're in
the air
you uh hold the jump button to start
flying
but sometimes the flying just doesn't
happen fall down basically the the
second jump and then the flying starts
to happen
so when you see
did I jump up behind it
that she couldn't teach
oh no
a cliff
I really need to set it up so I can play
Clips easily
but for some reason I didn't want to
work
so
but like half a minute to spy
foreign
about that
[Music]
oh am I okay come here
I guess so
oh
got the attack by the backswing
so
if I've got the instructions correctly
and
you should be able to just
nuts
okay
as soon as it go down in that first
cousin
or something either
ah
stop shooting me
he's very on
if you rude and unreasonable t-shirt me
no all right another one
background power
wait am I
okay so this is a wave
back
with this eye okay
wait a minute
yeah I think this came was a bit Rusty
at the end
wait I lost the
is over here right
yeah yes
go ahead bye
if I went out
so the uh
we
can all right come from the lottery
okay what's the
not sure what point of that one is
oh wait it looks like it you have to
activate these parts
and these are placed in such a way that
looks like
the other place
yeah
the lace is a space far enough apart so
you can jump through you just gotta hit
this sweet spot yeah I I thought sorry
but I wanted to do it like broccoli
thank you
wait a minute
how how does that make any sense
I mean
and now I'm doing
great at the moment
but when did you get trapped in there
with me I mean you could just died the
laces
I guess
no way
no wait I said
finally
put this person
wrong power only because I had to use
playing on that scene
I should probably expect electricity
from a distance as I approach
foreign
[Music]
yeah that's how you get that just kill
yourself
now twitch is going to fly my video for
saying that
the high side species look like that
right so this side is actually about
so back to the
before inventory
and spend spend spin
I can shift I guess that's because I
only had one point to choose between
you can also jump back out
so
I assume
that's exit which is that place
so let's go to the next place then
they make strange noise
oh wait I missed that thing
to work back all the way
yeah I'm back to see exactly I need that
I forgot my backyard
because he has a house
I couldn't get more than one then
he has loads of them
okay starting to annoy me
so
yeah no idea how I was supposed to do
that
[Music]
oh there's like can I reach it from here
nope
it's too many years you can't spend all
the time
exactly
I want to spend all my gems on all of
the jars of bugs
have an infinite amount of lives
I would have a lot of lives there
okay it's probably this part
and now these are these
things
[Music]
button
nice it's I think that's the
continuation
[Music]
70 eggs
oh you're here too
wait
oh you're not another one
foreign
no nice camera
Mr pendant Gap in the Amber model there
foreign
gems
well they spend a lot of gems
[Music]
okay
aims to be yeah
I didn't mean to go down
but there's a hopeless place down as
well
oh it's another timing thing
oh let me guess the button has it at the
bottom
I won't go there
oh it's floor blue
well in that case I can just drop down
wall jumps on those
because it should be like a button I
think this
and then just race towards that thing
[Music]
now right
I made a mistake
thank you
very easy to see with us in the way
and
what's dying
come on
thank you
I did it
the enemies that constantly fire are
officially referred to as dumb
it doesn't always address checking but
here
photobombing seems to align with Amber's
personality
maybe maybe she's that type
yay
wait a minute
that's back
yeah something fell tough
one more trying
now it's obviously what I'm supposed to
go
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
so I guess this side is clear now
present it doesn't really tell me it
tells me the total amount so there's two
more nightmares which probably that area
and then like dark no the dark camera in
that there is that probably can't
progress through nothing until I get
remaining two dark games anyway
oh
go ahead and spiral if you if you've got
money oh there you are my favorite one
celebration
how did how did my bags even set up all
these places
yeah analyze the planets and everything
in here
so the planet which is the sun can still
figure out the how long is the the night
cycles on these things that one seems to
be almost facing the sun constantly that
one must be very hot on one side and
while every planet seems to be doing
that so I don't think we can use the
rotation of the planet as a guide
or maybe that's why this planet has
constant pain constant nine in different
locations because they are facing
always facing the sun on one side
really can't be that cute for the planet
oh one that actually requires is playing
okay
the One Flame one electric
I press the flame button
foreign
[Music]
let's continue
I got a checkpoint yes
oh yeah
I'm invisible why can't I do that
where am I going
okay so there should be some
bonus area hidden
and also this one is definitely over by
now
I didn't need to make that automatic one
day
it will be
oh hello
then maybe I need to talk to you about
something I don't know why is why is
this place always so dirty anyone with
thinking army had been through here
oh I I forgot it has
yeah okay
an army has been through there oh
there's light gym
laughs
so that was one light yam
and there is just one more
that's no way
yeah that was what I could collect from
there
I think it's not shooting and shooting
each other instead
I didn't see that one
such loud lasers
[Music]
well that was weird
why are the lasers this is
you could
so
oh this one doesn't require any
activation
unlucky just open
for the dark gems wait how many dark
seams are they
40. I got it all only 10 more eggs and
12 more light gems
is still left so the last remaining
light chair must might I was almost
saying Master no might be
in the last room
I thought I said yes
is it going to be slightly annoying but
over here
and that's part of him
Elegance
been
that's always quiet celebration
boom
well Hellas since it looks into the soul
infestation and got here
unless it switches area soon as I'm
walking here but they might have some
now I traveling isn't going to have a
light team here
well I guess I just have to find it
later
because I'm clearly
wait
it's it went quiet
because this is
dark gem goo nothing
I don't know this is the boss kill I
forgot about that this is the boss key
game
what were you thinking going after red I
don't know
I thought I could stop him after you had
weakened him but as soon as I got here I
was captured and locked in this lab
Red's forcing me to work on his new
improved Army
capacity
I seem to have made things a lot worse
hey don't worry I'll be out of here as
soon as I heard how carols here so Spyro
okay oh it's it's cozy Friday
you're not so much of a challenge I'm
sure I can do it again and don't say you
will allow me to win but I will win
anyway
cut the spider in another other gym
wait where did they eat at that bro
I've got him
I'm got him wait
wait what are you doing
thank you
well it's up to them but now
why am I supposed to do that let's see
those explode okay
waiting for that stuff to be over
they say
and now he's getting closer
he has pretty demand aim and then hit me
wait
okay
why is he a standing there
at least the previous boss fight he at
least try to destroy the things that
will attack him but he did spawn those
things so so a good question is why he
even spawned using
in this case I assume it's the professor
bombing the Rockets
he's just standing there taking out a
hit
and will it require different abilities
each time
oh wow
camera died
how's he turning without moving his feet
there he's standing on a revolving
platform
enough with the laces dude
foreign
okay so that's like a set of details or
something
that's in the East armors like the the
leg part is clipping through the foot
he said she
nice
nice okay
quality
okay since you just just run as quickly
as possible
oh no yeah guys I suspecting this was
going to be different things
whatever this is going to do then
electricity nice
yeah
brilliant
and it's the last one going to be eyes
because you know what is worthless
foreign
spell so far at least and compared to
the first one with red that was very
annoying even though I found it
easier
oh electricity again
I mean okay sure do this as far as I
know there's nothing in the game you can
act wait what
let's burn anything
there's nothing in the game you can
like any puzzle element you can activate
your eyes as far as I know
wow
foreign
I see
I get to your comment after I win or
lose
20 seconds out but
okay
and one of them trying to shoot me
can't do more of this I'm sorry
if those were like in
existed throughout
all these faces that would be different
yeah but I think I think I'm not going
to make this
we need to find the one that was on the
other side
yep
perfect timing there like two of them
didn't shoot for some reason
for the rest did
each face is made to take off exactly a
third of his house so if you didn't
quite deplete all of it in time they'll
just reduce taxes but only shocking from
it
okay
that makes sense
yeah that actually makes perfect sense
and
that's what I think all the games do too
[Music]
yeah
okay
well close
[Music]
maybe I'm just you should go close yeah
and then it
this is crazy
excuse me
that was very good
foreign
taxi counter Dutch
I came she came next to this insect or
something
am I just missing something I mean how
about let's put this a point those
lasers they can't can came out of no way
[Music]
not nice
no I don't
know
stupid key
control this if this game is so steep
for some reason they have decided that
Viral Amber
turn really slowly when you run
I mean
that is true in the air conditioning
game two but at least that game you can
instantly turn around
this this has like a small turning
radius and it doesn't it gets in the way
sometimes
so
I almost got everything in the first
first or
the first time again
anyway
I also don't like like maybe speaker
frames that's the biggest dragon with
this game
and there are so much
wait
I could take damage from the same thing
two three times sometimes
and it is not for me
no I saw that
foreign
fun don't run off the level this time
we leave the monitoring radius is very
short it's small but it's big I mean
you're shooting a bit too far away I'm
like
I mean you are you even trying to hit me
hey where are that
take too long
I have to go through the whole section
just to damage one more rocket
foreign
this one though is
yeah it's not important is taking damage
multiple times in a row
yeah so it's basically
yeah how many frames of damage will this
pass
one frame Sierra frames of damage
was was left over
okay
so much writing exclamation points ads
at the moment
because I'm early
but I can't give it to myself
[Music]
wow so much damage yeah
I didn't even see the electricity
but it's shooting so slow
they're supposed to take out the third
of them this is going to take away
okay can I boost them with some
electricity
okay let's see
foreign
oh nice
yeah I would probably not be able to see
that
which usually takes three seconds
probably take me four seconds
uh I'm running up again
wait while there's another side
[Music]
kill him kill him
yeah I said four Cycles
there is got unlucky yeah
I mean I was always on the other signs
this is consistent
thank you
so funny
he's dead
shocked by his own
so hold on I'll finish him off should
you though
are the butterfly still there
why are you afraid of me now
oh Spyro
he just have to get off that easy I'll
take it from here
yes yes put him there
[Music]
my credits I did it
eurocom entertainment software product
software not protection that's not part
in it
introduction John Williams Suzanne
Watson the sign Terry Lloyd will Bennett
this is going to slow I can actually
read names
[Music]
I I don't know what that means I'm
probably shouldn't know what that is
game programming they Pride more Andy
Brown
in a second John Stevens
near the past I did
ask me to fall behind too far
yeah
so
they prefer supporting a tiny red in a
jar is one part of the game that is very
importantly I know about the
character in a jar thingy
as a meme I don't know the context I
don't want to know the context and I'm
never going to click up the context I
just know it is a thing
and
[Music]
and yeah but they do put characters in a
lot of jars in games
probably
you probably list a lot of characters
that the characters or other creatures
that are
like
like sapien
in jars
I kind of like this section but he'll
still be alive for it oh
John Williams I've spoken with him
[Music]
who's John Williams
and do you mean spoken in person voice
chat or through chat
next I think I know the thing about the
jar
I can imagine what this
[Music]
thank you
Mark sergeant
30 minutes 50 seconds as Guerra
instead
is someone got 50 seconds
oh they got David's
his seven minutes 48 seconds I got
you sure are proud of the day scores but
scores in what
one of the certain Bird levels but which
it's an insane
over email oh
neat
yes Stuart Burns
I guess the J is dead yes they're
differentiating from others to get Burns
good or could not be part of is actually
the lame
I mean it's neat to speak to people
which is kind of a weird thing for me
since I started streaming and getting
more popular is that I've been able to
[Music]
talk in private with other streamers and
it
feels weird still
so
[Music]
European localization manager Barry
Kehoe
but you didn't localize like you didn't
change the spelling
of the game I think
you didn't like it isn't it using your
spelling
I could be wrong
[Music]
and see what spelling that you see
International president and
cool I mean the international president
the president over the the international
now it's the
president of the international
Department of that thing I assume which
name is offsprings I don't know
[Music]
and I never got an answer on what those
times were for exactly and they might
have forgot to do
yes I've played this is goofing off yeah
hey Michael
golf he's the voice of Charles
[Music]
Groove in Skyrim among other main Lords
he's also Osmond Sadler for Resident
Evil assuming it's the same person not
the one with the same name
but do you come follow the what
this basically the scene
I don't remember the name of it
uh Actors Guild I just remember the name
of it when you basically
your name is unique and you can no one
else can have your name
and then
if you part of it if if the company is
part of it they
probably I don't know they've discovered
this part with you must be part of it
too
to be
in the production side and remember and
and something with if you're part of the
active skill you cannot do work outside
the actor skate
which from the sound of it sounds bad
but
it's probably valid reasons so anyway
you're come we're based in the UK I
couldn't tell you I don't know much
about actors yeah I don't know much
either
or either
I mean
that's list everything's done
all right you can't hold the button or
that one
one by Logic
so which levels do I have this area
but yeah I can use it no it's that's not
that's the back button because this PS2
game is not using the PS2 control this
isn't PS1 controls
which is annoying this game is annoying
what a surprise yeah I got stuff to pick
up here
celebration
yeah it's a little bit more clean up
here
and I think
so where am I going
somewhere over here
oh yeah
it was in here
yeah that's this room I didn't have
electricity when I get caught in here
suddenly it should be some secrets in
here yeah I've seen the door can I
control
oh yeah
don't be green
oh excess there you go
oh you're going to take this lap
okay
okay
I don't think this works that works in
this game
jumped over it
so that's the egg that is one more egg
and three more light gems
down here chest
chests more chests
that very scary chest I can only
teleport 313 more times
so where am I so this is back out
foreign
[Music]
the one that stands out
yeah this one area is cleared up I think
it's something
here yes
there it is
I need to get there
but this is
Frozen but I still get get attacked by
any
oh no it disappeared
and also this game has insta killed
floor
so I can't chase it Cheez It
and then jump over the water
[Music]
perfect
I got it
did that go up here
don't think I did
not that that's I guess that's the
benefit of picking up the chest and
stuff
I can see if I've already been here or
not picked this up
so now I've been here
oh there it is oh this one I can't speak
to knit breaker you collect all Dragon
things from setting it the blink mini
games
no
not the blink mini games
creepy sounds
yeah this is the point I progressed
before
yeah I just went through this one
oh
I didn't like it
now this is a spec but maybe hi
that's a punishment that's a reward I
mean it would be a punishment if I had
to complete them at least yeah
nice eyes
they get to beautify
yeah I did this
there's one thing I like you
and
where can the
losing the cage blink if for some reason
she says
standing in cage
and there's this place maybe I didn't go
here
well I am
oh he's probably hitting himself for
pizza
I don't even hear the light sets
it must be the other area then
here
casually stands in the cage
when you're the most beloved character
in game
oh yeah
no I should have this power
I mean I don't really get anything from
it
wait I do
it now I know
come on Sparkle Danbury
we got the door to break down
and there is
[Music]
so now it says one more and
I wouldn't be surprised if it's
in the area over here
probably some something I couldn't do
over here
nicely getting stuck there
might have been some ability to cry or
something
oh I just didn't go up here
and here's light yeah there you go
everything connected
[Music]
also after defeating ran twice it should
give a money back stability
teleported to go to a different brands
as well
I don't know if that's a possibility but
at least it was
make it more convenient
my favorite
my favorite palette okay that one is
done this one next
so
which is clearly an area I haven't been
to
and obvious and you haven't been to here
but why is the telephone
two eggs we like it
and yeah there is a thing you can do
this on
but
you can reach this place
is it up there
yeah from up there
my my yeah
this was a bad place to go to
I do
[Applause]
or maybe I can find something
interesting
but I'm here just hunting
that's Escape
now the hunter area counts as
this yeah
keep pressing the correct buttons
is that the piranha okay yeah
random one day
be that funny
temporary glitch you can do
yeah here we go it was kind of a great
place to do this on
I think up here
or I can go up here ready
okay I want to start running but
now that's the head pop bash thing
no running for you
I'm going to do that's doing it
let's press the correct button it's
going to be yeah
a repetitive joke of mine
but
I did it again
I press the play button
hey it's going to be hard too
not be used fun fact you can reach this
light jam with a simple Glide from the
moving plus yeah okay you're okay yeah
this seems to be a poorly developed
design
[Applause]
only designed area
yeah yeah you can probably fly over
there yeah it makes sense
can't wait
and let's
dehydrate
and the person you jump is not
slide off
so
now
to the right
[Music]
and now to the right
yeah no this door should open
okay
no
hey what are you doing kicking me
but there's something there
now I just need to get up from here
huh
what should I do here
[Music]
and then
how do you get across that fence
okay okay that was just silly
okay don't spin
interesting
there's silly Dragon yeah
silly dragon
yeah I'm not getting much oh wait there
it is
I was supposed to go to this cave
over here yes I am over here
thank you
collecting these gems
cheap
said Facebook
dies
a sheep can't stand cold they just flick
over and die
an egg Thief
while exercising immune to the cold
and are unaffected by
well you need to do that
[Applause]
all right
we've got the egg
now
hypothermia yeah
what what did she say
I got I got all the exposure one yes
and I got something about it because of
that
no
dude
[Music]
again dude
okay I need
yes I can't die on this lemon
that would be silly
I don't have a bike Jerry
okay uh let me get the bike
he wasn't far away let's just do here
feel free to browse over here
if you buy one
when you are at zero extra hit points
that you just
put your his point that's Max and then
plenty by another one
once
that requires intelligent programming
and what I didn't consider that
because the lack of intelligent product
okay
what
am I
am I even supposed to go somewhere
there's something more
come on I was I was I was charging wait
you survived
excuse me
this when do you survive eyes
this is hardest taking out with ice than
it is sweet electricity so
I get everything notice one egg and one
light gem left with one of those other
areas
nothing down here
[Music]
I need to jump
this is one of those other areas where I
didn't couldn't do the one jump scene
that is nice area
neat nice area
so which area can that be
because I was there
that's a hunter's area which area would
that be
one of those earliest uh
earlier areas probably in that case
okay let's see
or something
get up there anyway
because I'm bad at this what is
there's nothing there
[Music]
did everyone see anything
so
I went I wish I had a point day
so if I continue
[Music]
okay this is continue see I'm sorry
about that thing see if I continue this
is continue right
there might be something
oh
there's a whole Sparks level here
comes the park even monkeys stupid bats
yes and I'm popular cheap yeah
oh it's gonna be fat
yeah
do it for me Sparks do it for me
wait am I supposed to do it now you said
you were going to do it for me
speed run this level
thank you
oh wow wow
thank you
what's the point of the missiles anyway
[Music]
well done
technically the fastest way to move in
sparkly is to match the everything hell
of the Boost button but see if you think
case yes I assume you get like a boost
but it doesn't drain as much
oh hello
not because I got a all the eggs in one
set so she won't help me there
yeah like that
I guess
but it basically it's important
I'm dying it moment
hey excuse me I'm flying here
thank you
oh that's close
oh I see what they do
thank you
I didn't get the gems everyone
I got the light gem
where would I you turn into a worse and
worse character for every game
no obviously not
see he not even the Sparks like the
Sparks level so
that's everything and that's end of the
realm
done
I always save the game on stream
and it's been three hours so thank you
everyone for showing up I don't know if
I should do like
on Wednesday and then continue with an
expired game on Thursday Friday next
week
or
oh
yeah because it's only 64 light gems
and six is six it's only six like them
and six eggs left so that shouldn't take
too long so I could probably put an
extra stream on Wednesday
so
that was
history for today
I have a good one thank you for showing
up
and you did amazing today he said thank
you yeah that's um
those levels some of the some of the
level is really tested my skills
soft Labs didn't really hit some levels
are there too
flew through
yeah
now
this
um
okay this is
social is so I have
I can't spell the Discord server
um
Patron too but I don't think anyone is
sick
playing on kitchen which is perfectly
fine
it's only if you want to be so kind this
is what's my streaming habits
and then also the YouTube way I post
videos for you I haven't posted a video
in a while but I should probably do that
since I'm fine
I will I will do that
soon I can't say sing
eventually
so
how about
visiting
a finish streaming
from Finland because that's what I
finished living on
who is currently job making art
throw in
a self-portrait I guess
he is thank you
hey I hope you can come in
here
was it a
quit coupling yes
take away today them pronouns
if you would be using that
if you've heard to refer to them in
first person
which I assume you usually don't do when
you in chat you say or something anyway
that was it I don't think I have
anything anymore that
my actors are very unorganized and
improvised as usually
so thank you everyone and
I got one trip today I only go there
with that
when yes bye bye everyone
foreign
