hello
we got that full part in here hello
bunny
hello Rocket Man red dragon and I have
never came on in anime lacking bunny
[Music]
I'm gonna feel this conversation there
hopefully it's a only good for there is
to say it does look like
things are getting better today
I hope you share some of you good luck
here
Rocket Man
Okay so
[Music]
now
and Benny with one from upon Bandicoot
says pontoon
and also a foreign
[Music]
can't wait to see you humble cortex kids
like good looking mess
and let's see if I can remember which
lemons have the remaining color color
Gem and I've tried to figure out
guessing that's all on my own and um
and I would wish I said yesterday I
would appreciate it because no one just
if no one helps me which levels there
see if I can remember
so far
think this is one of those that have
even if this isn't color German I think
you can get the gem on this one
even without yeah any call previous
question anyway so
slippery climb is one
yes and sleepy time is the red one that
one and you know
and yeah it's up to me too and pick it
up fumbling in the dark has one I should
be sure but you need the one from
um
the the like the last platforming level
or something no that's it
well not that bad but at least like
and let's
delete the message and then
repeated the Francis can at least
like
I really don't like family people
and unless it's like
obviously that they're oh okay now it's
okay
unless they're here to advertise
that's a different scene
[Music]
you
[Music]
go whoa
[Music]
oh
oh I failed okay I still think this is
one of the gems I'm going to the train
yeah man hope that it doesn't count as
back seating what you did ask me but I
mean it's kinda
it's like I I knew about that one but
utility like
yeah it would count his backseating if I
didn't know about that one already
because I mean
you
basically you telling me which levels
they are by asking me if those levels
are correct that I mean that's that's
basically telling me which level they
are
hope that makes sense
oh are you doing restaurant now
there are no retro achievements for this
this version of the game
I mean
I'm playing the power version
I'll check right
I don't wanna paint I'd be terribly
upset yeah it would be very sad if you
were bad no
it would be very sad if Rocket Man was
banned
any bad bunnies get panty yeah he had
the people who advertise people who
constantly
likes don't listen there
a repeated offenses
and so on those get banned
I think uh aside from people it's just
coming to advertise I mean that's they
are not part of the community anyway
they have I have no problem Banning them
you have people who try to be part of
the community I just feel I I just feel
bad Banning those people
I think there's been
can only think of a single person who
has been banned
or actually for their participation in
the community
because because they were told multiple
times to stop doing something and they
kept doing it
so that was Van Worthy
Oh Me Oh My you get the rainbow Jam for
defeating cortex first time oh yeah
all right
I remember that feature
and then at the
I should set up a prediction for how
many
how many attempts it will take me for
defeat cortex I usually do this zero and
then one two
then it's like three prime or three six
and then
Plus or something like that I don't
remember what I usually do
I don't even should do that to Cortex
because it is kind of a tricky fight
maybe I should do that
you just started immediately
because everyone is active already
because I I do have the prediction from
when I was playing Spyros they have it
kind of already set up so I can just
press start here
and here we go how many deaths
against
cortex
let's go with that
and let's go and see how that goes
[Music]
yeah
funny silly kitty I don't have
leave to school uh iron sand have a have
a good day at school and I hope your day
is good
your community is growing Japanese
will take over
which
thank you fun if you have time you can
always put in something for the
prediction that you don't have to only
if you think it's fun
but don't feel like you're happy
annoying moving on
no more mistakes here whoa as I say I'm
almost jumping off the platform
okay this is how far I got last time
actually it's like up ahead
well almost fell off again
and I remember if that's that featuring
native crash game on the Remake where if
you spin
and you keep your momentum
which is kind of wire most or most of
the desks I have is due to that
if it's just the
if that is that something they have in
every every Church game like
because I'm getting
um
do you say tripped up right
every time it happens okay let's see
no no
oh and
seven and a half
thousand I want the two tests I guess
I'll put more on three to five
ten thousand on zero and like first try
okay oh my
God it's like 850 on read the five
I hope I can satisfy you by doing it I
think a try and get that
totally real rainbow Jam nuts no one
else has heard about because no one else
in the history of crashes ever defeated
cortex first Stripes that's obviously
true
okay
I'm already starting with this level but
hopefully I'm not strong that much
better quote
I have a good feeling but you know I
appreciate that you have a good feeling
about my skins
yeah I think I want to be
me I should be fine there so I can get
back
I almost made it again
so there we go continue in 11. yeah I
think I went beats three to five because
that way it's
like CIO is only one like and
one value one to two is two values three
five is three values and six pluses
every other one now that I cannot think
oh let's try to press the spinning
button
I was too late I think I'm starting with
this lemon and then when I get to the
end then it's like but actually you need
a color Gem and you don't have the
correct one well that was it that would
be a set set thing for me when I reach
that point then but I'm pretty sure I
can get it stem
wanna see we'll see if I'm correct
some of you might know
it might be
and if I'm wrong
I hope you have a really good time
watching this Dragon if I'm right
well it's going to be great when I
actually finish the level and if I can
stop like that's what I wanted to do
I know I can probably jump over here but
I'm I'm scaredy bunny
seven thousand cars please
yeah you need you need those carrot
coins to buy carrots with that's the
only thing you can install cards for
buying carrots
well if you're hoarding the character
and then bunnies can't eat so you have
to spend them
how does putting above the Sierra don't
believe in you they believe in me and I
mean they believe that
they're a bit more honest that yeah
yeah I'll do I will be able to defeat
cortex just not enough single try at
least that would be to be able to do it
I jumped already all right no that was
fine
at least no one has put six plus
those people don't believe I will
be doing it in any
you got them all the time number six
when I have confidence in myself saying
that
yeah
5006 that's we'll see
I haven't played this game in quite a
while though but I'm being very careful
now
the Heights
become more and more carefully
I haven't yeah I haven't been striped
story cute
um could have had that prediction for
that first
you're close to being the boss and my
favorite one and I I can't stand and
making Misty
hello
um girl that was it I felt like I didn't
video her name
but true again
I started saying Portugal
yeah I'll do that but this time I'll
must stop before I continue
oh no oh no oh no
this time I can do this no this time I
can do this I say and jump off the level
it won't let me vote that way
you should still be able to add more
points you can only add it to the one
you have chosen but you should still be
able to add more points
if I can guess your favorite boss I will
different games
right
sorry I don't speak your English again
your favorite body in the this game is
my favorite
but this is not funny boss so
I actually don't know which is my
favorite boss is in Crash attacking any
any of the crash games
I said I like cute stuff
like cocoa
right there
but Coco is not a boss
are we talking about design or gameplay
why did I
just hit the wrong box box crash and you
have to pick the correct one
whoa no more mistakes and I made a
mistake this was before the checkpoint
because we have similar haircuts I
haven't considered haircut yes
or what do you have I mean I've seen you
because you have time on your stream but
there's a country remember what's your
haircut is like
it's not really been the picture of you
have been focused on
what I can say all right doesn't matter
meaning I've spun away one so that's
enough
there we go that's a good timing
now I'm making good progress when I
don't have the mask though
okay I want to put jump right there but
that's this
we
I just look at papa
yeah I can just look at papa and then I
know what the haircut you have where I
can just look at one of your
but I keep doing mistakes look at one of
your previous streams and look at your
haircut there
hey I'm I'm struggling
and I'm sorry if I'm strugging so I'm
like
yeah I hope it doesn't spot anything
but it's good is to give each 100 and I
need this gem
also why are you spinning the ton of
tokens but why would I keep them
yeah I was waiting for someone to ask me
why would I collect them
oh and I only need spin one
in that case I don't get bonus
I like it sure like what does the bonus
do for me it allows me to save the game
but that does that's what the gem does
too and I'm off to the champ
and it gives me extra knives and yeah I
need some more extra lives I think
I don't think they do anything else
I waste time I guess
that's all that thing they do
[Music]
and I I think I'm wasting enough time on
this level
[Music]
I meant so what about it actually but
what happens
it doesn't work in ring anything like
that the road doesn't work in a trilogy
why is it timing with this thing so bad
uh
whatever happens in this game if you
were to collect
the second or the first token as the
last token
do you get do you still get to do the
bonus
from that location instead
reconsider that because you can
backtrack
it would have been interesting thing to
test
so annoying the backtrack and crash down
bunny
um
all right and do you not need that for
the gym nope
boxes in the bonus I'm so confused no
the boxes in the bonus does not count
towards the gym
I can't see anything
that throws in the way
that's the difference between the ignite
that thing I'm gonna say that again
truly the trilogy is a good spine with
the United
crashed oh I did it again
okay it's here I failed last time
I'm gonna apparently I didn't move
enough dying on me and I almost messed
it up again
there you go progress this is close to
the end
for being red and hot they don't give
off any indication for being hot and
here's the home stretch
and I need to do that whoops
oh
there we go first try
celebration I got the gym
and what color is this Jam
it is yellow or orange I don't know they
have weird names for these gems the pink
one they call called Purple like the the
clearly pink Power crystals in crash two
and three those are purple apparently
toxic waste yeah this one should also
have uh
congratulations thank you
I need more lights to switch them away
to six
kind of running half the knives here
okay
let's see
this is a scary lemon
what have I got
mad right
I guess I'll do a quick highlighting in
hydrate
answer
and only if you want though because
there's the prediction going
it should either be at the top of the
screen or if you click on the channel
points
click WordPress
there should be at the top of that an
option for
and then you can predict how many times
I will die while fighting Aquatics
these spell cortex quickly
no no
[Music]
so if I'm having masks going into the
bonus and dying in the bonus doesn't
that remove your masks
I don't want that to happen
[Music]
I think an empty emptied bone is twice
yeah these red ones are really scary
because I can't really
determine where in the city space state
or
and now it becomes really scary because
now
they are one right
I'm safe here yeah
no
I stood a bit too close okay wait uh so
I need to restart but
side
[Music]
here
no
okay
that's why that's why I don't like these
red ones
because there's not much art can I stand
here yeah I can stand there
stand here
there's the last one another that I need
it but I guess
foreign
[Music]
let's do the bonus then
getting back those extra knives
I can't hydrate enough now you're right
yeah if the sake of the bunnies
everything nice on you for some reason
relies on you
or release
wait
can I stand
yeah I can't stand I'm not going to
remember
okay and let's do it foreign
[Music]
[Music]
and Raiders too
hello
oh how's it going
what further you have to
let's do the quick first comments
[Music]
and no game why does it say that oh you
had no category set
and I'm looking at around me there we go
that's crazy
hello Raiders
but why are you playing in that game
okay no I lost it again
[Music]
with me I need it for red ones
you Beast
and just beat
nayo Neo Neo
[Music]
which language is that
no
dude
oh maybe I didn't oh
there's some
development
during the raid
excitement builds
Neo okay I can say Neo
but I like you know
stand there to be safe
okay it's Japanese okay
yeah so they don't really use that if
songs it's like ICC twitch might have
messed up when I changed it from all
over here yeah and I've seen
some people say that I want to change
category which doesn't save it or
something and that's possible and that's
my test would be true
sometimes it's
all right not saying
hahaha
mean it
okay let's see yeah
not obviously not to blame you
it is a possibility
also that yeah because you think I've
done that and I forget to press done so
it doesn't save it but yeah it's
probably twitch messing up a lot of the
team because which is messing up a lot
but I need it
that's actually and also I didn't even
get to play the bonus again because
someone already done it once before so
that's also why the bonus don't count
bonus gemstone
yeah that's actually good to see that
because it still I think because you
know so what's the uh
you said you maybe haven't done
completed the game
so what's what's the development I don't
even know the game now it's been
strapped instead of time
yeah it could be that too if I clicked
off pretty soon
yeah maybe
starting much more closely
yeah yeah it's hard it's hard to see
like
Queen start time I got that prediction
going for cortex the final boss
how many times will I die when I fight
cortex
his house far is so long
compensating for something
no I mean no no I didn't
it's music
so now it's going into the no in that
case I need to be over here
yeah moving up
and then it goes down left
and there we go
and have this boss fight yeah
I think they could have done him and
made him a bit
more difficult
he's a bit stupid
Nike
you can certainly do a big bad job
attacking crash at this point
it doesn't even try to shoot crash
and he doesn't he is uh I lost I guess
I'll just rest a bit
um oh yeah I still have the deals and
extra missions there yeah okay that
not full done yet
might jump into the new game plus after
that even more content so this one I
might be able to take the Cathy
challenge
so I'll see if I can I'll go for gym
change the knocks Inspire one for having
guns
but this MF is winning a machine gun
I mean they have like
yeah and they changed their hand grenade
to two barrels of explosions as well
like
actually
try to remember
and yeah because the Inspire 3
in the dino level
aren't they
enemies with and guns in that
but but France is considered for all
their own audiences
[Music]
so
[Music]
and also it's not like pin stop is
playing by the dudes
now I don't want it it is of me
I can accidentally spin away alive but I
cannot spin accidentally spinner for
intentionally a token get out of the way
oh thanks Mike
yeah I am I am playing on emulator
otherwise it wouldn't be
this nice looking
and this is
yeah I can understand people having
trouble with this level
this is not exactly easy
there we go be gone
yes
oh no
come here
another hog because one wasn't enough
well that was close
[Music]
enough I'm using any boxes
because they can sometimes well well
like
because it's I guess this computer isn't
really
there it is I see it
okay
no I didn't
climb on
head and sleep
Hello Panda
welcome I was about that message
wait I didn't spin
fresh tomato spawn on its own
are they climbing on top of I do have
kind of big heads
no and now it's safe
oh that was close
that was scary
yeah this is a good design
well there we go
come on come on
yes
do you appreciate the shadow
come on give me the gem now
let's say I missed that yeah a box or
something
yes
oh that was that was scary
thank you
[Music]
the dragon the red dragon even
hello what do you mean hurry the the
prediction is running out it's only is
on a
one on one minute 50 seconds left how
many times will I die when I fight
cortex there are a few
some of you can still put in
slippery climb this one has a red gem
still time left put in some more
pictures
that is not obviously the number of that
I mean this is one called Series yeah
number of deaths
I bet there are times you'll do it on
the first attempt yes
thank you for believing that I would be
that amazing
but yeah let's put it on
the sporty outfit for the what level
mm-hmm
so much rain
okay
here's a question of money
that sounds really takes me to do this
lemon
here we go the dead of all levels
these chocolate bars have nothing on
them
yep I'm still stuck on this level of
course I'm trying to get the jam which
requires a perfect run
yep
this is usually try this game which
requires a perfect round on every level
music quite an interesting challenge I
mean you could you could still play the
trilogy whoa whoa
the cruise platform
with the uh same rules
right now I mean you can't do the
not playing the bonus you have to still
take the bonus
hope you do show me
oh yeah I'll show you the prediction
timer is over
well someone else has been put in
and I've been at my phone
and which
I want to see this total
here we go
no it doesn't so many told us properly
damn
show me the totally dropping here
anyway a total of 20 600 points has been
put towards team prediction
half of those points more than half of
those points is a perfect perfect fight
against cortex well
I hope I don't disappoint you
it's going to be exciting
I really wish I could have the timer
longer
because that's kind of the kind of
prediction I'm doing now
no why did he do that status that was
rude
I got maximize
and didn't spend ten thousand points for
Sierra for nothing now he spent ten
thousand twice or zero for ten thousand
points
do you like it when the numbers are high
this makes it makes it exciting
at least I got here in time for the
prediction yeah I started early this
time because it was a lot of activity
early on a lot of people who are
predicted might not be here anymore
but
I should have said it at that time
and if you if you if you put your points
to a prediction and you're not in the
Stream when the prediction when the
result is picked in the prediction and
you still get the points
all right
and I do my usual rule that if there is
no winner everyone gets the points back
yes
if I pick no winner as the winner the
points are thrown away and I don't want
that to happen
in London like Corner platform
yeah completely wrong timing
I guess we'll wait
is it better
if you didn't don't then I may use
something to wear it I mean it's fine
it's an 18 plus thing you use a pet bird
no way
yeah he might call call crash a dick
I know it's hard to believe just me it's
that much to me
is this a good timing
oh
okay
maybe I should count right there
yeah that was a good timing
no it's easy
well the platform almost messed me up
there you stupid chocolate platform
chocolate bars
yeah and from here on it becomes easy
hmm
I didn't speak I didn't say that
now it's just
moving platforms with no desks below
no there's that's there an element
is it so much easier
and also if I messed up these stairs
I just land down there again
this one is a bit messy now
let me let me just
thank you
now I can do this I just have to restart
oh yeah you're not you're not subscribed
do you want to do something about that
Benny
more likely to come and
left final bunny for you maybe this not
excuse me as many professors
all right completely wrong timing wait
that country start now and I don't have
to start
oh you should check it
I wasn't very community that was when
I'm sorry
I'm getting and I'm starting to run out
of lives now
okay
yeah you know she left me for doing that
I was I was too scared
and then I messed up
to my entrance
not give me that was not me
maybe one day when I'm rich with the
money coins I will forever subscribe
I mean if you subscribe
you get a higher rate of money coins
you don't need to be straight
but that's an idea Brenda said now lots
of points and you subscribe for 24 hours
and like yeah
not properly subscribed but
casually manure for those days
let's go to the platform okay
and now for the easy part
there we go
and it's just a solid stairs
solid Stars
when we platform what oh I fell off
okay completely wrong timing now
now
take me a few attempts
can I platform
all right now back up here
scientists
wasting a lot of science stuff
hey what I played last time
almost failed again
isn't that typical me
yeah yeah I mean it's a difficult part
and you fail on it multiple times in a
row that makes sense
oh and here we go
now I don't want you stupid hands
and if I enter the bonus I'll I'll do it
but
I don't need to do it
or I thought I missed that one
foreign
[Music]
no stupid head for me
don't enhance the camera are cortex
heads
because those give me keys
oh I did it
what are you doing crash
that's not how we bounce on a bird
I mean I don't have experience it's
bouncing on birds
okay I should not do a rocket man here
we need that stupid head anyway exactly
doesn't do anything for me just die on
it lose my mask
[Music]
foreign
it was funny though
lights out this one has a gem but I
can't access it unless I have a
different gem
shots my head
um
but it was it was pretty funny watching
that obviously it was sad too
or for Rocket Man
[Music]
I think it was a time trial where you're
not allowed to die a single time
which is the same as doing a profession
to be fine
[Music]
Andy
and the incentury they still have
requirements for perfect runs because
those are quite more
ironics
I am saying he's going for 19.99
why are they afraid they're going after
100
foreign
extra knives
rats
oh no these ain't good
I shouldn't I shouldn't
I shouldn't spin them
as that activates that can't
accidentally
I wish they could leave a mask on the
ground when they break the boxes like
actually don't get that
Germany
yeah here
so they have a model for placing a mask
on the ground because if you send
that's my
guys if you send an enemy
into a regular box of with a mask
it breaks the box and leaves the mask on
the ground
but not these boxes for some reason even
though they have a must
which they use
because here's the yellow gem requires
which I don't have and Beyond these they
still have masks but not in boxes
because you by the way you wouldn't be
able to break these boxes oh my God
after taking the yellow gem
confusing game design
it just confusing me when games are
inconsistent well I did it
and 20 000 points in prediction because
like whatever means
I hope someone wins
[Music]
a heavier by triangle rocket man I
didn't mean so no don't cry
no rocket No Cry
this one I can get to gem on because I
have the blue gym that is required
yeah I'm annoying lives again good
no
rocket No Cry
yay I think for celebrations
you're running low on lives again on
nice and left oh I wish I could do
something about that the sure the story
short stingy about those lives not
giving me more than 99 of them
I mean you can only have 99 fruits what
I do wish well it's the homies
when do you have night night knives
that the fruit counter would stay at 99
as well until you lose a life and then
attract one more fruit and then
as to having the fish account get up to
100 and give you an extra life and
that's just thrown away
they have to build it up tonight you
need
silly
I'm used to be okay this one contains
this hat
I do want those heads
or ads
new explanation I don't want those heads
and all right
it's
exclamation point it's
[Music]
usually message I wish it could do that
automatically it's just a message per
hour
I could set it up to like send a message
every hour automatically but
that might be it out of sync
okay
so I don't remember
no no there are no boxes because I will
come back
there is a stupid box up there
do not let me go back
forcing me to proceed through this area
anyway
not that stupid head this time yep it's
only two levels but not stupid heads
foreign
[Music]
boxes this is not allowed
imagine why I'm so careful
okay I must candy band again
in real life I would be pretty scared
about
jumping on platforms like this
is floating gems above a black and white
I want no life for me it's not like I
have
wait I could pick it up anyway so what's
the point of that
as I'm pretty sure if I go back here
I've got to see the spider there it is
no box is missed
open
now
[Music]
oh
oh and I touched the edge of the
platform here
it must be in the mouth Kelly
oh well I'm trying to hear it again he
stepped on the platform and didn't like
slicked off
without collided with the side of the
also
a sportswear timer
is up
I wouldn't be scared of these jam
platforms
oh no are you sure you want that
wait I need to set it too
show me about that one
let me set it to the
um has seemed funny level
not 11 again I guess
not this game though but
I guess you're attractively
[Music]
and because I already beat that from
trying to grab one about something
outfit
and you don't think you can make that
long of a jump
would be pretty creepy trying to jump
across this
comments
now the best must be coming
no that's okay
I'm not which is my fell off of already
fair enough
[Music]
yeah yeah wait I can I can I can see it
happening
I meant
even the very first platform
which is
somewhere up ahead
these are moving quickly
this is isn't this level
routed in thicker shadows in the trinity
in the remake
yeah because as soon as you step on this
platform and it starts moving that
quickly
[Music]
Henry
you're probably going to fall off it
is keeping your balance on that
excuse me tricky so I'm hydrated
as requested by the audience whoa
whoa yeah I don't need to I mean I can't
pick it up yes
pick up this one yes they're fun
[Music]
because then we can do this
[Music]
Super Mario 3 the world where
you can have 999 lives
but after you have that many lives in
Click not life it changes the first
number to a crown
you can click Crown 0 0 to crowns Crown
99 which is one thousand ninety nine
lives
and obviously that way no bets
and after that the next nine becomes a
crown so you have count from zero
two Frontier 99 and after that the last
nine becomes a crown
so you have crown Crown Crown Network
lives
which in its Crown stands for tense
am I wrong
yeah
they must have seen that
there we go
bonus round one attempt
I mean if I find this I'm just
completely ever collected Gem and then I
just have to retry this level and
connect me three masses again
oh is it
no is it Islam
oh yeah
now
huh
I win I'm going to collect the gem then
but I'll be back
I'm not crying no key for me
I spent the fruit away
they won't pass through that way but I
didn't throw it something anyway how
does that make sense
I'm spinning like crazy I'll be back
to it yeah I need a bonus
[Music]
everything's gone
[Music]
it's a shield or a knife
I'm doing that
I need one
extra life I do need that
almost lives
[Music]
you hear her dancing in my life so yeah
if you could only change
I wonder how many lives I would have at
this point we could count to nine
A Thousand Lives
foreign
should be uh
clear gym
and I'm gonna just go and get the
and there it is
yay
we're now here to replay the last one to
collect the key
thank you
Castle machinery
is a very easy level to complete
it's another one where you don't need
that chair it has a jam platform but you
don't need a damn platform to get a
chance
and it's very easy because you don't
even need to
completely level
drawing timing
bye bye
what
what would Coco say
[Music]
impressions
crash going to the White Jungle locate a
new
laptop battery for me
that's totally what she said in
question
something like
I can see that
this one
[Music]
okay okay on this song
[Music]
well almost fell off the platform
the plate form
dogs out too far
what I think I'm jumping too far
not bad
no pets
there
and this one is jump on
there's a face here
Second Face done
you don't know laptop batteries growing
the jungle I actually didn't know that
I learned something new every day
I do like this song it's a nice song
community
attempt to
come on cortex this level is not even
hard
I do have you even set it up like this
sometimes I do like that
oh I did it give me the key
[Music]
I got the key
do they have the key now can you just
quick 11
I mean it's it is saving
so logically I should be able to just
click the level and not have to go to
the exit
I mean the exit isn't far away but
it's yeah same state and check you could
do that
you know what it's it's interesting to
know
live State great
they forget yeah I guess keep the key
good then I'll just continue
casting Machinery if there was a jam
required to complete this level
like you don't you can just do this
[Music]
and then you can enter the exit deck and
you can completely level immediately
it's like certain knives but I'm
actually going to collect the gem on
this level so
so
so I would actually have to clean the
lemon
you need it taking all of those lives I
wasn't meant to fall off the platform
there
I can also just pick them up and then go
back
nice
you're right
I'm sorry for my actions
okay let's see he's on platforming
Section here I think
I think it was from that checkpoint
Lolly said her famous quotes I don't
know if it's famous that she would kill
me for saying this level is easy
many of the other levels
[Music]
there should be a section up here
where they yeah here
I don't really go like that I don't
remember them being that weird
sneak me
[Music]
[Applause]
I love camera
and do you want to follow along
not like you required or anything but it
would be nice to have a camera
thing never told me to learn
I want to go down
get any ones
[Applause]
oh it's a pleasure section up here okay
I'm not sure why you're collecting this
I don't need this
I'm not used to having these many lives
that's any crushed to do I actually got
the game over
here yes plasma section yeah here we go
now
now I failed the platforming section
of me let me practice the platform
section
there you go that's how we do it
I got the game over on the second level
of this game
oh
all right to be fair
you don't have many lives at that point
to be fair
let's just scraping his face against
that wall
that we had lavender you have to do a
leap of face down there
because it starts you down there and
just had a Green platform take you all
the way up
all right
I hope you enjoyed that video fun fun
anyway we're moving on
everything
cute bunny
yeah especially when she's not wearing
her dress then then she's very cute
[Music]
screens it yeah let's go with another
outfit
without fit
yeah let's let's just do the same way
and a swimsuit is one of the outfit
options for the coupon mod that I've
been working on for crash four
which I can use for walking levels
water-based levels
I've probably has to switch around the
office
randomly I can see
I don't know how to do with the outfits
in the game
last one now she won all of it but
outfits on stream that's why I should
make the uh I was as I said a bit before
that I was going to redraw by pon pon as
a
2D picture and then I was thinking about
maybe the slight bit of animation
but people seem to really want pon pon
to be like a 3D model
where people like how this 3D model
looks
I'm personally used to pawn pun in 2D
but
why was he touching them
when I could instead of spending time
drawing a 2d pump I could try 3D
[Music]
instead
and then like but I will still do like
the outfit
and where is the Judgment button is
redeemed
are you in the Playboy Bunny outfit well
I don't have one like that for the 2D
Pom-Pom but but hello okay sneaking here
talking about
some sexy bunny outfits
yeah that would be interesting but then
no no it wouldn't be annoying to make
because today would just be a teacher
yeah that would be an interesting outfit
to do as well so far it's 43 the Pom-Pom
that would be my model on stream
I could do outfits
you know plenty of outfits and still
have the outfits yeah
here this section is the one I'm talking
about here they go in order inconsistent
water and consistent pattern they don't
do that in the remake
and here's the exit
well well crash dating
idea I have a redeem for all of the
outfits in the game and if someone
leaves an outfit you use it for the next
level if their teams are made use the
default dress
okay actually that's not a bad idea
have a nice I have an outfit redeem
or like yeah I do them in the order you
redeem them in so because I see the
order and then I just confirmed them as
and then I do them
that's not it
and then I can still set a timer on
Netflix so they can't be repeated too
often
if people like that idea
wearing a sore coat to a circle Mr coat
trench coat of it
well I do prefer keep the outfits if to
be honest need to be next part I forgot
it was another bus
this bus is so forgettable but if there
is no Playboy bunny I might get a series
button area
all the scenes but what are you talking
about
he takes damage when he uh damage the
game for some reason they're like
attached to him
um
yeah just play the um
crash for
mods for
hey mod and then you can use the Playboy
Bunny outfit as much as you want I do
still need names for those outfits so if
you are on the server
survey
if you're not on the discus already
command is exclamation point Discord and
then you get the invite link
if you are on the survey
go to the channel guys I'm not attacking
people
there we go
and then go to the general chat
uh top right this should be the the the
threads button which is like the hashtag
yes rope
symbol with a chat bubble on top of it I
call it a chat bubble let's beatbox
the lab
yeah this is the last gem color gem I
need before I can get the next color
change I need this color gem so I can
next kind of gem
but should I defeat should I go
for cortex first or should I go for the
next content first
okay
and Harry from Beast oh oh nice idea
nice idea because let me type that down
how do
beasts Stars
Beast Stars
and because they because I do want one
to dress up like different
known rabbit characters who actually
have
notes
and they cannot eat clouds preferably
female rabbits as well
and
coaches
uh Bianca Cream the Rabbit
characters but there's apparently quite
a limited number of video game rabbits
that are female and is going close as
well
or cute adorable as he said yesterday
because he was playing
oh it's the stupid head yeah
it's really nice like I think yeah I
think he didn't do any form of
exercising his was drinking us quickly
stuff I got all the muscles
so don't drink creepy stuff for muscles
uh dress she has different office I
guess I could talk to the different
outfits slow level that has had someone
suggested the
uh basketball
[Music]
which he had in at her introduction I
assume
I could eat that one
someone wanted that one so I should
probably do that one
no when I was spinning I heard the
spinning
I guess that
I guess I'll write down a Lola Bunny do
you even though
it's standing on online already on the
list I can update that one to be like
the different outfit she has had
I don't like the sound of that
foreign
foreign
[Music]
keep up the speed day
okay
foreign
[Music]
I mean I mean it still looks good but I
placed in one game but it does not look
good for like a modern
post 2010 or
because I don't remember if this game is
post 2720 I think something
near that cortex yep I guess
I think I guess the question remains
should I go straight for cortex or
should I go for the Jets
finish up the prediction
so people can feel good about winning
if they win
yes people have been excitingly waiting
for the result of that prediction so
yeah I should be able to see anything
and then I can go back 20.
now back to the remaining
that's after that
no way
Christ
in there well
no no I missed him
uh
did so well and then and then I messed
up
I just messed up
oh that's me
[Music]
who is that guy yep
yeah if it is missing
foreign
the worst words I think you can say that
I think you can say [ __ ] [ __ ] and
stuff like that on skin
I just did this but a on on the chat
then the chat is fine with that but
[ __ ] that's that's crossing their
mind
oh no no no
starts crossing the line
[Music]
hey I have set up like
um
if if there are terms that are basically
hate speech
it should filter them more
sticky mods this is
bloody mods
so when are you gonna do two right there
question mark question mark question
mark will I do Tomb Raider great what
are you going to do uh crash or spiral
on your face
he's really good at acting
okay guys
he doesn't know how to properly pet the
panties
I don't mean it
do you mean that game is an electricity
and this is good
oh no problem careful about the
spaghetti they don't know what they can
do to you when you play the Tomb Raider
games I guess if I played too many games
you play Spyro reignited with your
Pom-Pom mod
preferably with the skirt
because you completely without this game
yeah
or something
the way she meant to be
shouldn't be a version of between the
model one outfits
very fun fun
but that fun fun is less answer like it
more and more like in funny things that
I would just be creepy
sounds like a typical
[Music]
nice yeah that's um
almost home
boom
and now we're back here
I did it
I did it
okay
they won't respond
I think these skins
oh
challenge sorry for us can I not sure if
it is a challenge anymore like a trade
bad timing
again next time
everything can give me the jam
I got the jam out
okay
boom goes a dynamite
and there it is that's the yellow one
[Music]
as as easy as as easy to get as the
color of the gem
diamonds
Shine Bright Like A Time celebration
the Great Wall how long did it take for
me to complete this and finish the time
is over
and let's see how quickly can I complete
this level
[Music]
none
that was a hard lemon
okay so because this game is this game
um I have to make a Save State here
because if I defeat cortex became wait
okay
it is prediction time
we want a special outfit to open during
the final
like I don't know what Sportsman
a very difficult underwear that is that
especially outfit you want during battle
going for fun fun to face off against
your opponent
in a in an epic battle where she will
defeat her opponent he takes operators
I mean I guess it's to distract your
opponent
okay do you have a discount there
hopefully this is here
okay
third episode so far let's go
did I make it changes in time yes for
the final battle
come on
snags
kimchi this seems slower than in
between here
oops no I took damage
you can only take damage one more time
hot coffee
something happened but I'm a middle of
the battle
I have to
no he's done
now I need to go through this whole
section again
not the whole section there
I need to find a green one there it is
Boom
come on cortex
nah what are you doing
no took the damage again no I'm shooting
again
no no
no
come on when this add Mickey's
subscription thank you I'm sorry I died
I wasn't concentrating on the
subscription I think it's fun
I made I made a terrible mistake
try to avoid it but I didn't pay
attention to the one that was already in
there
I'm sorry for everyone voting cereal
and that that happened
did my best
laughing that much
but now I'm gonna make a mistake
oh no I walked into that one
and now
I just didn't do that mistake
one test
to hear this
because the fight part is not hard I was
just making a stupid mistake
the first time is because I don't have
full
not fully aware of every pattern I
almost knew them but I got more used to
it's the second time around
yeah you came just in time for the final
battle
foreign
dragon
and the Mickey subscribed
is on the fourth month I think that
means
yeah
four months three completed months
you're on your fourth months now
what months after my curiosity Street
that's the misleading part
you really should have said it's before
it's important I I well I don't know how
many times have you been not subscribers
I'm really really thankful for being
still being subscribed I'm really happy
with it
while I'm watching Chris probably put
this reminds me I need to play the
catchment codes I bought for myself
but now fixing my PC new CPU paste and
stuff nice
hope you have a good PC do we have um
do you mean did you get
by the
the which is the Crash Bandicoot in you
both for yourself itself
I think yeah
I'm sorry oremian
yeah please
record this Mickey doesn't care
the bye bye monitorium
sorry was that not English
yeah and that is Consulting so
yep
deadly
I died once so one two two wins
First Step you got distracted by itself
doesn't count how was it distracted by
the sub I wouldn't say I was destroying
myself and that's kind of part of
streaming you know I'm not the isolator
from the chat the chat is still there
though I don't think
plus I wasn't distracted I didn't die
and when did something happen I wouldn't
I wouldn't blame
and now I can clean this up
I want this are you sure that Oneness
one to two deaths is correct yes
uh
did 20 20 600 points are going to be
spread out
wait how many people
two people
of which one voted Benny is seven wait
let me let me do you
sorry so I really like to do this
10 600 in Spanish
who was the other person that said to
you
who are you who are you that's it too
because I can't see you can only see
that spelling
you can't scroll back enough in time
whoever is for do anyone know
like two people said
zero which is Rockets man and uranium
who else about it a red voted
three
which is the red is alone on three
so someone wrote that one two
no no I'm not a picture I can't seen it
that's stupid
it's probably s1000 even
anyway and let's let's give up points
then
I hope it's possible no iodine once
sorry I died once
again
[Music]
two stars twenty thousand six hundred
goes
accuse
to
T and this
that means that the penny gets like but
he only already say his counter should
increase by 18
204 which is a lot of points but some of
that was is already he won ten thousand
six hundred points
what the what the [ __ ] put ten thousand
okay
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
bad word this is such a great
job Japan
and you know every week how is it read
do you think I I didn't even know what
I guess I guess that's the thing you
could have like
yeah
why am I doing this
the what people actually have wrote it
on doesn't show up for the streaming if
you think I
if I if you think I picked the one
that's what about today I didn't even
know he voted on it
it's definitely not stats that's
definitely the reason
[Music]
almost made a mistake
[Music]
now come back here in the point of
meeting next
and I still need to wait for me to come
back if I can jump around it
[Music]
make this first edition
this platform
reset the mask
and here are the final boxes knives yeah
this needs some knives
and that's the gem
and then I just go through all the way
back to the first level and collect all
the Jets
game Run time Yep this is Chevron time
no no don't worry I don't think he's
actually he's making a joke
there is the purple gem according as far
as I know they call this a purpose yeah
I mean no this stuff does not look
it wasn't that City because I didn't do
like the last bonus
this game is weird
[Music]
anyway back to the start
having chicken pasta from Frozen and
warmed up yummy broccoliage
try to share with me since that was easy
and that is an easy level
as he did overestimated the darkness
part of it so this is the first level I
have not seen a gem on yet
that's this one requires the green one
so let's go back to the finishes
if only if only it were like that
I'm turning jamming although Swedish
doesn't have that sound ironing
definition
how
how sick of a Swedish accent do I have
okay
there's some words I say
where did she
that's one of them
killing more scary wait did you laughing
at that
I thought you'd like discounts
[Music]
this
them Schmidt that do you need that one
skunk it's a single screen
wait are they
I think the bonuses
prior to the bonus I do they disappear I
don't keep starting with the next bonus
are because I did not do this product
but this one is gone
that does make sense though
damn time
I like this kind of they're cute
they do look very cute and the uh I
needed pretty much they added these
colors to them which is a nice pattern
and also the gym have a specific order
it's not the order I picked them up
another game
yeah I'm in the bank
this great gate it in this gate is so
great
it's great is banging maybe I should
check on it
only made that joke
but I only know it because it was posted
in uh
yeah when someone was to tell their
British problems also this bouncy thing
if you do this
and one of the British problems the
person has what that when their neighbor
said
your friends is banging and then ah
thank you about myself
but no no it's actually making awful
noise during that
oh
Great Gate yep
guns he's stinky wait
are you shy
says that everything is stinky
what is Cheyenne
run crash run
foreign
skunk
I remember
me yep
silly fella
so it has been here a few times
SpongeBob that's a good one
I'm very dark purple outfit it is not
black it is very dark purple
foreign
monkey
wait is there something where I need
[Music]
this is useless knife
okay
then let's move on
no another one is this something behind
this one
yes there's a box there
but then I still need to pick up the
advanced box because otherwise I don't
get the gems I don't have to go through
this one perhaps even though there is no
boxes here unless I can jump up on that
scene without
those I can it's not exactly sure what
the point of this is because the only
reason why someone even would go to this
extra area
is if they are going back to get a
chance
dude
if it was like an enemy you bounced on
wow
I had covered a couple years ago and the
only last effects I have for me is see
it is skunks now spend like coffee to me
that's interesting
Mumbai
I'm gonna drink this because it was an
interesting side effect
thank you for being here
I'm very glad that you spent your time
here
and thank you for participating in the
prediction even if you lost
Ready Step okay after all it is the
participation that comes not the win
please
foreign
would you rather be a dragon or a
dinosaur
or even this dragon
forgot that one heart and it's probably
many more hearts
speaking of that do I have do I have
some of their
okay let's let's suppose post on the
hearts I have
my ads
okay technically I do have that too
spell heart why why is called love
yeah
and then called heart
there's nothing no other variance people
tend to use there that's the one ones I
got of course the Modern Love is uh
which is difficult and the
that fox thingy love is a hike training
about they said it was a temporary emote
but I still have it they're not sure
what I mean everything's temporary you
can see but let's pick after wolf in
here
I need to get that box
kill
plenty of hearts with love I have more
in the past it's just that yeah
the random
yeah that's not the one I need it's the
second one I need to go and pick up that
single box that is hiding
[Music]
this one
it's a single box
annoying
now I can't go back
if an answer but I might be back where I
left off
okay
[Music]
come on
[Music]
things
yeah that's why I died
[Music]
I guess you can come up to anything
get the correct angle
right agent
I'm gonna go to bed
thank you for being here thank you for
having fun here
it's always fun having me here you're so
nice spending about it's funny trying to
watch CS5
and I will play Tomb Raiders someday
I just don't know him
because so I think that's the one boxes
and those Flames looked realistic it's
probably nice flames and I do like those
over what they used in the brass of
Cortex those names are just only
good night says in
stinky neck where's that go
ah sorry Neko guys snuck in here when I
was
when we were talking about hearts
and yeah yeah there you go stinky bunny
yeah yeah
hello shy
welcome
let's
wear dreams yes yes we have some swear
dreams
I assume it should be sweet dreams but
um
I don't mind you swearing it
I'm on uh
can hunt
you should be sweet dreams
but I just said that but okay okay
yes I guess this dream might be a bit
behind right
I have lost 34 brains
so that's like one second actually even
worse as I think it works
that might actually not be exactly what
determines how
and what what is delay delay can be
completely related
yeah the delays mostly because the
computer
[Music]
the singer boxes
there's not much today
less than five seconds
yeah because I I read swear dreams and
then I said it no
then I said I knew it was sweet dreams
but then then after that you said that
it should be sweet dreams
so there must be some care delay
and also why did this one scroll now but
11 watches well it's a whole party in
here
time for me to not fail
I'm happy to have so many amazing people
here
[Music]
on this crash adventure and it's on the
main
about it to 14. I do have my clock
right corner there
what network I started stream it's only
been two hours so maybe I will be able
to 100 again
um
that would be nice I guess that that
means I can't start
the next game and then I guess I could
play crash two PS1 as well if you want
that I wanted I was the only thing you
know by playing the first one because
it's it is different and the second
answer is also similar rules wise
yeah
you did Trinity to the remake
I mean I guess I should say it all the
way around it
messenger remake is accurate to tell
schemes
so it wouldn't really change much
can I played those unless people do want
me to play this
then I can do it
pass hit pass all around I like to watch
OG crash team
I guess we cannot pull about that
I mean if there's like an hour enough to
this change let's let's have one black
and because
I was all the way singing maybe I could
play like OG clone war or something
oh should I go for it
our girlfriends this time
[Music]
OG crash too have you tried to Insanity
I do I have packed down my PlayStation
PlayStation 3 is a complete
otherwise I would
so I would say
let's say
that last question was if I should be a
princess there was a while ago next game
[Music]
crash two
PS1
because I have another game
I don't know uh PS1 so
hey do you have was it you know I mean
do you ready but
excuse me
thank you Ty I could no no I picked up
my
at no yeah yeah not like I could play
the first two Guitar Hero because those
songs are original and
covers of the actual songs and there and
so I could play the first two on screen
and I would like to
bad time
let's start with this anime
let's let's just quickly simply
next game on Monday and Tuesday uh
Thursday Friday will still be here
expire
I will still be spying Orange
wait I'm not supposed to guys fight off
papa papa I don't get anything from it
and leave
and then Rolling Stones is
oh I'm good at guitar here especially
when playing bass guitar
and also playing
because I could play it
back
yeah because because they
first guitar here is on there
please Pleasant team
I mean I can play that but I don't have
it I don't actually have
a guitar
and controller for PlayStation
I can use the controller anything is
fun I don't know
I do have a guitar controller for Xbox
360.
of course and I do have Guitar Hero and
Europe and games
for
360 but to those are using the original
songs not covers
they don't have their own original sense
that's a bit confusing see there are
some covers
which is a good plane
but the number of songs that are
actually kept in Streamwood is so
limited
[Music]
kind of thinking the point of that
um
it's in this place is
trunks they're going to die now oops
once again died anyway
no
wait why can I please normally you can't
quit while he's responding
[Music]
yep there we go now it worked
stealing me I just walked off the
platform
near at this point
[Music]
oh my God
yeah yeah this this thing they changed
in two two three four five six seven
eight nine ten
instead of being a tense fruit it's a
hint
okay
no because there's a box on top of that
that case the two kids
let's say that one is different
[Music]
trying to sort out my wires because
they're a train wreck
yeah Tangled device
can easily performance
well I guess we do it this way then
all right one more try
this King screen oh it's going crazy
I was supposed to land on this
as soon as it land on its should
activate it oh
missing one
coins
against the gem now
foreign
[Music]
if you don't hear from me I've
electrocuted myself
oh no
wait what kind of cables are you
sorting out it can't be computer games
in that game if they have that much
power
celebration
I don't like this 28 or 30 minutes
television
[Music]
okay
that's native Fortress and then the
first island is done
and remember that the pole is still
active so you can vote on it if you
haven't vote yet I have not looked at
the pole so it will be a surprise for
the result is again
since the phone is minimized for me
I don't know how many people have voted
and I I really wish I could make the
results hidden until the time Runs Out
and better well
I also wish there was an option for that
or predictions too it then how many
points are put too much
each option how many people have voted
to these options so they just put
question marks to show that these values
are hidden
and then
but still having the total number of
points shown
which can be useful so you know if it's
like if someone up with 10 000 points on
I can't point
yeah
that can't change how many points you're
winning 15.
but I would say it's more useful for all
stunning predictions anyway
no no executing rocket man yeah you're
not allowed to tell us yourself
and I think that was actually illegal in
Sweden
some time ago
I've heard and the Chevys was a sink it
was true that committing suicide was
illegal
I'm not exactly sure how you punish a
person has committed suicide but
um
foreign
[Music]
remember
this is a nice Flame
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
look at this area let's go up into the
sky
right now
been up here in the remake so everyone
has been watching this remake I already
knows about this plant
thank you
and then
is that
I think I need to go back
remember exactly
how this level worked
I can't suppose it got back
like that I think so let's continue 11.
he punished him by Reviving them on time
and Olivia will crash two one three
against one
and yes
stupid cat rabbit
but he's like a cat rabbit
uh
grab it
all right
anything
[Music]
[Music]
punishment for committing suicide is by
being revived
and you have to continue living your
life just as it was before no
celebration and there we go this is
another gem
you assume the gems are just in the
order
and the the levels are in which where
the latest Jeremy pickup is at the end
celebration number two I guess because I
was like yes cheering modern celebration
okay I'll do the question I do they all
crash three as well there's two and
three
up the creek well let's go update lost
city sample ruins Road to Nowhere here
we go
another Bridge
I also
um
he showed up there
I didn't really
I did comment on your to Insanity
comment but I really didn't comment on
that you should have sorry about that by
the way
because he posted that emails you can
post the uh
evil Pokemon
because I think some people like it
oh apparently they don't die by anything
they sure are stories
hey it's okay I thought I could kill it
with invisibility
apparently not
I landed on it
and then
yeah try to spend now
I'm barely see the platform
and here's a thing I don't like about
that thing
this is like not awesome
because
this one actually is this
which I can use to activate this which
activate this one which I can use to
activate this
stack and activate that one this one
didn't even have an outline before I
wonder if that's an intentional sign or
a mistake
if it's intentional I don't like it if
it's a mistake understand but people
make mistakes
because I'm not really sure why you
wouldn't have that because if you have a
personal because that that's the thing
I'll try to figure out there like how
would I solve this and you don't even
show every piece that I have to work
with
that that's not nice
that's just
brilliant
I start with our friends game and then
you do that to me I mean I know it but
before I knew it
and try something
coming here because I can just jump over
here
we go
and then this platform
[Music]
Yep this is fun
and then I need to jump back all the way
there we go
did it did it I hope I got the Jam I got
the jam
yeah those Hogs look really scary
yeah they do they don't ask carrying the
Remake especially when they sit down and
plants
I mean I'm a rabbit I don't pant
I don't even have plants well
yeah one pair of pants
I do have another tattoo
anyway
I mean I guess that's Underpants
which can be called Pants
by some Dynamics
Underpants yeah I do have that
to be fine
but I don't but don't wear a dress
trousers
they make the jokes at one time
I'm not wearing dresses
most of times they're not playing
trousers because I'm wearing interests
remember it doesn't have plants but sure
what
handsome plants
and in British it's just friends yep
Fountain has pants
in terms of Underpants
as you can see
some people will know what the what the
underwear is the reference to
but not everyone might know
now and the reason why I wasn't as
excited for plane crash 2 was that
but
I I might have to take too much crash I
might actually need to break it off with
another game
go stand there so maybe I should play
Clan away
oh well I'm not buying any pants
dress and pen is
yep
that's what I'm wearing I'm also wearing
a bra
okay I'm actually not wearing a dress at
the moment on the way on the way
I'm gonna do that
but that's because it's still it's still
kind of warm in here
this one this room gets kind of hot
it's not like anyone can see me so
enough
is Coco's on the way from freshwater
when she gets electrocuted or just gonna
think I said exactly
and since crash has the same underwear
he basically have the game I would
assume that retractively that's the
underwear Coco has been wearing since we
start
oh well oh I've never had oh well
whatever came in yeah that should be the
title of this
gaming
because I'm only winning everywhere at
the moment while gaming that's it that's
not against the juice right because I'm
not on camera
there's no way they skipped 11.
uh skimped and let's go back because I
don't want to go back again later on
I'm gonna skip the level
I'm actually not done
this point
because I have this type of whole lock
you're nothing but the whole High
riding all the time
just never was a while ago I played
played in the room oh oh yeah yeah
exactly yeah let's play this level on
the original game
you know no time
and the only time I'm getting here I'll
get these two comments after this level
language or next time I like
[Music]
let's see
what's this oh oh you dropped this
screen grabs carrot it
whose character you drop this queen
and that's what this was
well I'm a princess not a queen
and if someone says like but if you're
the ruling
if you're if you're the ruling Monarch
why all your friends is not our Queen
who else tell that to
uh
well I guess technically the president
of France
who is
who is a Rooney princess princess
who is a ruling Prince
[Music]
I assume if they elect a female
president that would be princess
the ruling president of France is the
ruling Prince or princess of Andorra
so I have no problem being having a
princess
did I get it
come on
okay I I guess 40 rods to the auction
and that's never liked it depressing me
turkey
[Music]
there is proxious glitch and
it is Crash I guess
[Music]
that way
do you like Darude Sandstorm
Rocket Man is alive oh he had us there's
Sandstone no I don't remember how it
goes
thank you
[Music]
I'm Gonna Keep mixing boxes
and yeah another one is very hard to
keep past
[Music]
leaves my creation leaves my the creator
of the bed
Rocket Man
running through the atmosphere
I only should have that can't clip I
just don't
know her
[Music]
ease because I know some people do have
uh
you can't understand bones
let's play
so there we go finally image the first
checkpoint
I'm gonna take my man because I'm going
off the gym but
that's I haven't gotten that part before
no I missed it
missed that one too
and I got the checkpoint so I need to
restart anyway
yeah anytime
um
no size but scene stinky bunny dropped
this song wait should I drop the direct
sensors
we are number four well I don't know
that one I was never even not into that
meme
he's half man half a rocket ship that's
that's
creepy if Rocket Man had a model would
that be like a rocket [ __ ] man
because the rocket man could certainly
not be just be uh
a generic term used for people who fly
Rockets
if you don't want to imply
any
national terms
[Music]
there we go there everyone everyone is
that which side
I did it every box I got every box
and yes next steps stinky necklace
is stinky
distinctive heart it takes out for
harambe I know about that meme
but like
[Music]
the elevation
[Music]
now Island 2 is done now I can move on
to Cortex power
by the way shy uh
I don't know if I remember if I said
that to you what was what kind of
sentence was that
but as you might know I am working on
the
a good song we are number one I mean if
you like it
I'm not saying it is
some part of
I I I never part of the whole museum
[Music]
[Music]
um
and you might also have remember that I
have sex multiple times
that's fun fun does not have four pads
however because there will be some
outfits in the game that would be
alternative outfits
I was thinking that
one of those outfits would be
um turn into a Cocker Spaniel
and the cocker spaniel will have the
prophets
and then and then he would love it
because it's perfect
[Music]
all right
what's the animal boxes now I think that
was just a checkpoint
so then I go down here but I think
there's a lot of back and forth
[Music]
and then on here
I can go back here but I'm pretty sure
Starbucks is
fine
wouldn't that be a food
[Music]
it sure would look maybe
that should have made me look like a
fuel let me just look at this area and
then because I died anyway
hands
you can pause the destination
[Music]
okay I can't can I
all right no no no
we um
this one really why can't I just get
across it
why am I striking so much
like this
okay so I need to
so when I get back which I didn't really
get to see because I died and when I get
back on the blue gem I need to drink a
bit
I think I used to that box there's a bit
of backtracking in this level this level
is quite elaborate
they are on the logo at the front of the
building is falling up so then there are
also more places in the level where it
says cortex power and every time it says
that it's still missing or like here
still missing that all right you sure
keeping it just up to
and you step around now
I don't know boxes here
when I want to stop a mask
yes you can't find something like that
nope oh my well at least I get my mask
back now
onto 18th I have something
mask
[Music]
continuing with this level
and I also
necklace stinky number one yeah
the stinkiest stuff on them on
mm-hmm
funny joking I hope I hope you don't
take offense
I mean you call me a stinky bunny stinky
pinky cat guys that I think Nick was
scared because rabbit is usagi
um
[Music]
yeah I didn't want to dress for that one
there's a scene in the glowing green
scene what is this Green Scene anyway
it's very gooey
no I don't need to care about these
things
convenient
[Music]
and then I can just run over that line
of boxes but apparently I can't because
there was some bombs in there they
immediately explode
[Music]
okay I guess I'll should not pick up
that buff
how annoying foreign
packs
yes now it's two metal boxes
I'm fake welcome back
I hope you had a good time away
whatever you are doing hopefully
something important
but you got dealt with
[Music]
fam Daniel
stand here
yeah who's Daniel
and why is Daniel damn
as you can see that
don't need that messing up everything
for me
I wanted to activate this one
and that's everything gone
care about the content
[Music]
what is this
how silly
then I need to backtrack
it has one box
foreign
now
I'm building a multiplex theater in the
bunny Barrel that way we can watch the
cliffs so very straight
no no
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
but he didn't even comment on my idea
but but like what what do you think
about me yeah
my Quantum mod for crash four it's like
do you like it do it doesn't comments
do you want to play quest one with my
Pokemon
would you play as the uh
cocker spaniel so you have four pants
number one bun yeah
that's some other buttons are a bit
better than me
they have more followers more Watchers
more
subscribers than I do
[Music]
they are they are doing everything
foreign
wants to
what about
Cooking Mama do you want me to play
Cooking Mama
[Music]
I see yeah man never caught you
oh my God what is that
do you want me to wait is that
I don't know if that's a game where you
just pretend cooking or if that's uh one
that I like before the recipe and
cooking in real life
because that's that's definitely a game
having like a game that is cooking in
real life
and a quarter myself cooking in real
life
how many times should I say cooking
oh come on
foreign
I actually did it
celebration jumps no that's good let's
see let's determine this way
I completed the level
it became a bit sweatshirt and
yay
thank you for the celebrations
[Music]
left
one time left
sparkly shiny gems
I guess they have to do the bonus of
this last one too
tumbling in the dark that's the one I
don't have to jam on
one left gem
let's see
[Music]
this
[Music]
can I get my knives back
all the lives I've lost
I'm in my time playing the game
so they wanted to make a harder dark
level but they made it optional not only
is it optional it's unlockable too
audible sharpness
which doesn't make any sense because
they're not
they're so sharp so they make a sound as
they're flying through the air
[Music]
don't spin them
it was fine this time
I don't even know what what is that one
is
oh I need it spider
's
oh I'm almost down in the Box it would
have been mad I want that but it takes a
long time
I'm walking spider
no
no
now borrow another gem for me
a big moment here
must be some sick battle dust in the
hair around her spirits
yep
yep complicated when your eyes filled
off sick metal dust
definitely
definitely don't breathe it in
so much I'm getting is extra
nice
there's no way
it's dark
that happened these dark levels don't
have much of
like
they're not
what's going on now
they don't have very many boxes
basically only have like one box where
the next class is
to spend time picking up boxes
I mean
if you if they can have boxes lying
around in the Bolder levels they
certainly can have them lying around in
the darkness zones
well since sometimes I feel like I'm
collating with some invisible ceiling
[Music]
questions
okay let's move on
oh no oh no
no
when
I don't know if you got the checkpoint
or nuts
so close to getting to
the next mask
[Music]
[Music]
what about
not a mask today
[Music]
[Music]
I'll do my best
I think I am I'm feeling this is the Run
whoops
yeah almost far off there but it's fine
I promise I don't follow this again
all that matters
[Music]
I'm on the platform it's okay
[Music]
let's come back
[Music]
walking spider
no
jumped too far
[Music]
come on come on come on
can't do this
are you supposed to jump back
to me
not much for now
it's pets
that bits are nice bit my hands brush my
hair
you can brush my hair undress me
everywhere wait don't don't dress me
which will keep doing it on stream
it's in my dress
[Music]
whoa I need to
get to see my dress again oh
I'm wasting in my dress
will never keep my dress on
[Music]
it wasn't instruction it was yes
hit one bunny I mean I mean sure if you
take it
if you uh
order uh
the large Pom-Pom plushie with the
removable clothing
you can't take off her dress if you want
to cuddle with a nice spray
[Music]
on the ground
I mean he's not going to be anything
underneath anyway but
you know all right
and for her sake
she would feel better kissing to keep
her hand
week
where do I press one
but we we just need to find a company
that's willing to make one a mask not
more multiple mass produced stem at a
low price
good quality
it needs to be
good price
there we go
but now I don't see where I am
oh come on
beside the platform
so yeah
and then I do want to be like human-ish
proportions response can I have human
Express questions and so you can buy
clothes from the store and just put on
her
that would be
oh my God
and I will of course want one for myself
as well
the system has champ
[Music]
agne more with this level than I do with
slippery exciting by the way
[Music]
when I spent
let's spend the longest time on because
that depends on the length and level
but the level I have struggled most with
which I guess would be the number of
tests okay I like that
let's counter per level
time I did die a few times on that
[Music]
wasn't it wasn't many days
France how much did he
warranty attack again
here we go
[Music]
I'm too short this time
it's all been like half minutes
I don't know which people are here who
actually need ads because almost
everyone are subscribed anyway
[Music]
I'm still here yeah yeah you're
subscribed
make a subscribed
Rocket Man subscribe
[Music]
okay I mean starting down this level for
a while now
I just want to complete it
I heard my name yeah I said that you're
subscribed
so you don't get ads
[Music]
you don't get it yeah I'll try I'll try
I will try
oh come on now I'll do it this time
spider can't spin because it doesn't
collide with anything
it would be an Xbox for right now
oh
I miss caught away but
um I got an ad it was bought and what
you should not get an ad because you
subscribed
and that's your subscription is over and
it still shows you as a founder
chronic plane crash bandico P that's not
an ad
[Music]
calling me an ad
that's really dude
[Music]
no
oh my God
that's another way
[Music]
I'm pretty mask in the game is an ad for
the game because he's in the case
this chain point where where that's
that's not how that's not how it works
[Music]
does not have any of this works
oh my God
did you catch Stacks without the masks
something
all the way
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
what stupid spider not bouncing hand far
enough
ah well let's hate you guys
you will look bad
oh and it's literally so struggling
[Music]
but I'm I'm trying
whoever says different times the hard
level has not tried this lemon
or I'm just bad at this level
[Music]
I mean I'm I am better this is
I will not deny that
there are probably lots of mistakes I do
that
and after you might not see
[Music]
okay
go so far
you can send that to me no no I slipped
off the edge
nice problem
only last for a short time
yep
uh slipped off the edge there I say so
sad
I almost have this
oh my God
[Music]
almost handed that one thing
[Music]
put this
[Music]
[Music]
all right maybe I need to hide it
they do reading this still still says
that say rocket man has voted on number
one
[Music]
expensive but anyways
survive
foreign
[Music]
keep track of the killing myself
and that's
annoying
[Music]
right now when no because you don't wear
it I'm doing something
but it is there
the inner knife
is skin touching class I guess
like yeah she's she's not wearing
anything underneath so
just like she's not doing anything
underneath underwear aren't they
it's an open space
something nice
funny
[Music]
I need to decide
and there we go I made progress
no
but you're uh but you need under the
underwear too exactly but being nude
under the clothes is not what the term
is if it's underwear or not
underwear is what you wear under clothes
that's what's called underwear
but the swimsuit is the only art topic
and the only piece of clothing you're
wearing normally
when you're wearing yes
[Music]
there is the closing next to the body
but it is not under lensing
so if there's like a term or closing
that are next to the body
regardless if they're under
understanding or not
then you can use that type of those
things if it is such a thing
crash yes
this is the original crash and I'm going
after the last gem
which which apparently is a big strikes
for me
[Music]
he needs a mask anime
then he's fumbling in the dark
it's been the other way
it doesn't activate anything
okay
chopping spider
that's fine
well why is this time between this so so
weak
[Music]
go
you can activate it on my own terms
[Music]
okay
let's see
no what is this what is with the game
happy Tuesday pumpkin
Moon
what is your favorite of the original 3D
well I actually don't know
people people like
normally like the second crash
that's it I don't know
every time I'm going to play the second
second parachute when I'm playing today
what's really yeah I almost get I was
growing he's such a great time
uh crushed too I guess I had to get
through this one I didn't know what it
is
me
[Music]
I didn't think we're inspired
I like the
I think I like yeah I think I like
Simplicity I guess that's that that
that's the reason
um
that um
I like I like the first spiral because
it's just so straightforward and
considering uh how little restrictions
they are with with how you can play
levels you can do interesting challenges
in it
and
Crush two and then the Spy Two has just
too much stuff going on in the game
I mean it's very sweet as well but
you know I don't know what it is
I guess
saying goes for crash I'd like to Simply
set the first crash
Crush to introduce another a lot of
elements that I don't know what that
means
the thing is this whole thing but he
didn't eat please and
thank you
stuff
[Music]
come on now
come on come on you can do it
hey I'm here now
don't need it anyway
yeah die
[Music]
I keep
I am one of the few that likes to work
the most
yeah I don't actually don't know if I
like tea
probably only finished
because if I guess that's it funny which
probably people are going to say things
and
I played the first and third of both
crashing spider when I was young
I didn't play the second of crashing or
Spyro
that wasn't until I got much over there
[Music]
and I guess I am
very nice the
the issues especially spy with all the
mini games that having all these
Mini-Game smoothies and making the game
great
but I give you the password
3 because I'm gonna start the reasons
from the way
what have we got
I mean the bus games have the same issue
yeah I know I'm running out of knives
[Music]
come on now
one Pawn
spoil me you know what you got
a spider I think
this double spy name
and then there's this section
[Music]
and then there's the first jumping
spider
now I got stuck in a wand
oh come on you know what uh I actually
need to use the bathroom
that's distracting at the moment
no as soon as I come back
finish this level
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
let's see if this helps
wash your hair I did
of course I did
where is it
you can't see this it will come back
wash your hands
such an accusation
and I have not yet to come back
[Music]
with such an accusation
I am I am a very clean bunny
and I'm not
coming
I even tried to be clean shaming
it's been Zone
evening tonight because you are my
stupid things these chocolates I have
[Music]
gone now it looks nice
and that's that breath got sliced
but it didn't react sadly
[Music]
it would be something
and this is dying by me please
[Music]
this is the Run
I think this should be a Spider Man
[Music]
again
knowing you
[Music]
thanks
[Music]
there we go see there we go it just hits
it take a Boston break and there you go
and I didn't
and they and then there's Bakers on my
bed for the winter couldn't they had to
participate itchy I hope he gets over
nature soon
and I'll show you mine yeah I'm using an
app later as they call it which pulls
out the hair which distincts things
stings I guess it stinks too I got it
complete and now and now it actually
changed the Level Society too
so what I can do
I really need that bathroom break but we
have a new yeah
Ivan and color Audi Speedway now I'm not
the speech I'm yes 100 in the game
super fun
and that was question one and places one
yeah I hope you stay uh so yeah
I even even or even that's up to you uh
I see you like crashing
I don't know how you found me
um so this is my the end of my stream
but I will stream more
Thursday Friday
and then
that's what it's going in there we go
that's the times I remember swimming
all right I usually shave and just keep
on my stations song patch so yeah I'm
using the ability which pulls out the
hair when you pull out the hair it takes
time for it to get it like I have shaved
my beard before and it's more anyone who
didn't know I'm a trans person
and these dragons and and then it
regrows so quickly like in just like 24
hours and 48 hours isn't it
I didn't at least in 48 hours it was a
no smallness double and I don't like
that for
um maybe obvious reasons but I played
pulling out the hair
and then it takes time before it regrows
and not every hair
regrows so if I redo it multiple times
the beard is getting c99 and yesterday
was the first time I actually did a
whole beard and that's why I am
happy about that because currently I am
actually miss one hey but
it's it's so much nicer of course it's a
bit I guess you could see sore at the
moment it is resting a bit but
hey
it is nice to not have it
I said yeah
right after the recurs I'll do it again
this would hopefully be easier and less
of it
so I was thinking uh that um
I'm going to fix my pieces this is here
but I think hasn't seen see you next
time that would be a such thing
yay
whoa well done yeah shaming's like that
yeah Jamie is annoying
so
yeah I was thinking should we visit
there yellow
guys stay as a nice
Goblin Goblin I think
green
who is playing
something by Lucas art
and when let's start the raid
finish Goblin yeah
that's a good description
and I usually use this as my
message I don't have anything else to
say I'm not that creative so
me I think it's it's in Phoenix
yeah I think that's
stormy yeah
you want me oh yeah
[Music]
and oh yeah yeah
I got the
Discord server and other stuff let's see
whenever I
have more more and then when I upload
