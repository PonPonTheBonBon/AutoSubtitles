[Music]
all right
it's time to begin
and of course the audience a bit of but
I can allow to
[Music]
um
I have actually not checked if the audio
isn't sequencing
yeah everything is
the wrong one
[Music]
I think we do that with it welcome
welcome
[Music]
and of course the Wi-Fi is messing with
me at the moment on the phone
the music in this game it has this
I beat what you call it
a nice music and then it shifts out this
part
sent a message but then they decided
that it didn't want to connect so he
didn't want to send a message
just forgot that I was sending the
message how annoying
[Music]
that was my height rate
[Music]
so someone asked what's missing what's
going on
no
I hope the picture quality is better
this time last time
thank you

so first off my girlfriend
I'm almost getting run over I got all
the bones I wasn't there I was I meant
to look at this screen
and then there is the park but I haven't
done anything there so I guess that's a
good
place to continue
look out
so
welcome by the way
I didn't welcome you

like the other levels
foreign
[Music]

road let's see if I can find it
[Music]

[Music]
in that case I will start
closer to the edge here and see there's
this man there's a bird smell there
[Applause]
[Music]
I'm here for watching them
I'm working on this side
by this time across the traffic
[Music]
[Music]
smelly burn
[Music]
well I guess we're going in here now
into the dog pound
for the mood
this place is terrible for my allergies
Wayne I'm thinking of opening up a
hypoallergenic dog grooming parlor what
so people like you can enjoy playing
with doggies Hey guys you're late yes
sorry we had some difficulties Miss
peaches is in a very bad mood worse than
usual oh yeah
when I brought in my load she blew her
top said boom City dogs were filthy said
she wanted a nice clean Clarksville dog
to be the first
to go in the big machine I think she
wants to hurt them nice doggies Wayne oh
for pity's sake Dwayne stop sniveling
my specifically the way you put that
extra soft I hate this job
[Music]
in the machine
[Music]
and Lux marks with a t
I wonder if this keys are like very bad
feeling about this
[Music]
yeah the music is a bit spooky
smell burn apparently
I am moving
oh dark
[Music]
and look behind no
not okay
um
[Music]
is like yeah they locked in the Darkness
[Applause]
[Music]
okay the dark side back
did the uh did the dog hold take
a pin down I have a very bad feeling
about this okay that's the third person
okay there's a dog I guess this much
must be him by
see the dog
[Music]
I'm not trying to manipulate the camera
doesn't work I can see a bit ahead
but not much
still chasing
you're going the wrong way
[Music]
anyway
oh there it is
[Applause]
yeah I can't I can't pick up the key
when the dog is the class wow that's a
weird Trip Man
uh he's going on a trip
okay one more try so there's one at the
house and the other two have found
locations of
I have a very bad feeling about this
huh
I can't see the key first
okay got the key
let's
yeah the duck tries to be clever but I'm
too clever for you
yeah
okay let's use first person I need to do
it
let's do it
Prince Jacob has a one level name
or stock what I jumped on
seriously where's the dog
oh
I should talk
he's smiling too much it's distracting
the dog is nowhere to be found so
[Music]
there's duck
no that dick stop getting stuck on
everything
[Music]
that's just how this game works
okay let's hurry up to the house
[Music]
and find the last key the tension is
getting to me
this time
I guess I'll just
Rocky oh no
and if I don't see any in front of me
but through the music
there's no talk behind me I guess I'll
just commit to it again
for the best
what the heck with this dog catching
business
I'm gonna pursue my dream a program in
computer games
killer
you got the entrance to miss Peach's
place
you're giving up on your job and the
news
[Music]
and
boomtastic
pick up these posts oh tastes great
[Music]
Kimmy give me give me
[Music]
bone-tastic
this bird isn't spongy
no way I'm a dog not a mountain goat
and you can't interact with it it is a
bird another way three bones yeah
just lying around I'm pretty sure there
are more bones here
oh yummy
[Music]
making up all depends
there's the Frog again
[Music]
you know out
my bones don't have to wait give me give
me
[Music]
bone I don't even have to stick for this
one
what's this sound bones wrong button
again no there's a random one watermelon
somewhere
but that's the back button
one more bone somewhere
maybe it's closer to the house
client welcome
now that's the final part of dog's life
looking for the final bone which is
keeping underneath whoa my favorite
no I should have all the bones for this
level
[Music]
now let's
there's a dog guarding the house
but these dogs have some kind of burn
hierarchy bonarchy
because I have more bones I'm the better
Dutch
oh sorry Miss peaches you disgust me you
filthy little man yes with pictures but
you two are complete idiots in fact you
have done well we have one of those
Clarksville dogs is perfect for my
purposes nice and clean
lean yet tender she will make a soft and
sensitive treat
sliced diced and mashed into a delicious
Pate by the big machine
once I have tested it on her
for production welcome Inns uh can I ask
a question Miss P Dane no that's all
right Wayne Miss peaches is in a
generous mood today ask and you shall be
answered uh you're not gonna hurt that
little doggie now are ya
[Music]
[Laughter]
hahaha
hi hi I don't think that parents of a
dog is going to determine how they will
taste after being
sliced and diced what's this the big
machine
something tells me that Miss peaches
isn't making ordinary cat food
no she's making in what did I get oh
there's a button here
can't read it
a defined hurt
emotionally hurt
this looks like something else though
too Daisy I can't hear me Daisy I've got
to turn off the big machine but how
they're the same air
well I guess I just follow this
hair
I'm not sure what that part of the
machine
danger flavor
in this channel
I wonder what the first step of the
machine does
oh no the door is open
[Applause]
after this
oh there's another one here
myself behind
what that part is done
let's continue up here
I guess nice shadow run away
we need to jump down I mean it's up
there okay anywhere there
he just
jumps whenever wherever he wants
but I guess this works
it is
stuck the saw blades which are full with
blood
they say even though this is going to be
the first
dark guys why is she on the way
[Music]
can you see anything
[Music]
another set of bloody sublets Rusty so
that's enough that's clearly red not
Brown
that is clearly blood and there's blood
splattered in the machine too
yep
oh there she is
only safe
and that's the last step of the machine
I guess
be careful okay well okay
I can try that
I'm just quite straightforward
tomorrow
I did it I rescued Daisy oh yes she will
be mine
she cannot step out of that machine at
any point
[Music]
didn't you you disgusting creatures
now you will both be transformed into
just gooey food from my precious kitty
cats
into the big machine speaking of food I
had beans and cabbages for supper take
this cat lady
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
slicing
dicey mashing
Miss peaches is
cat food
cans or all the scans in the well I
guess the villain is not it I guess the
story of a dog's life my old friends all
threw me a swell homecoming party back
in Clarksville
Gramps wrote a book while I was gone the
story of his life but the lawyers say he
has to change the title
my old guitar playing buddy finally made
it big with a smash hit record which I
guess you probably own
Wayne and Dwayne opened a hypoallergenic
dog grooming parlor now that Wayne's
allergy is gone he likes nothing better
than to hang around with his doggy Pals
and have a great time
and as for me and Daisy
oh yes now she is mine
see you next time
[Music]
and a bunch of credits
[Music]
how long these credits are
so what did you think
only like 40 minutes 30 minutes to do
that last part
but now I can do the 100 which my
people's doing in remaining time
yeah I've been quite
quiet
too long because it's understood
yeah I don't think there's something at
the end of the credits you did it
welcome Papa thank you
the I guess the game is too challenging
my son wanted me to complete it so
[Music]
I came in at the end did you actually
see the end or did he have to come into
the credits
yeah I don't think it's necessary to
watch all the credits
I don't have made me anything special
after the trends anyway
you can't skip
[Music]
there's no case it doesn't seem like
there's a lot of credits
at the same time whether it's low
instead
[Music]
just kidding to take care of this second
that's a great feeling
foreign
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
what mixture is easy to
they'll be able to hear me because of
the pain of my existence that is the
soft frankly
now it's the challenge music
[Music]
all right
to do
I can't sleep
[Music]
but I said it's so secret combination of
buttons
[Music]
it's so funky in in games
[Music]
practicing and manual design and all the
science manual
[Music]
with manual approval
right
[Music]
everybody at Sonic computers in Europe
qualifications
internal submissions and localizations
she made a difficult shot with easy
staff and territories who were involved
in casting for impact
we want them mention who they are we
just think
yeah I don't think they covered any look
like they had looked like say anything
but they didn't cover it they didn't
cover the both sectors they didn't cover
the people who worked on the other
languages
unless that was the localization team
party yeah these guys weren't long in
this game
popcorn popcorn popcorn
so I just basically restarted the whole
game
oh let's go and 100 Adventure
I don't know how far back it's
resets the game
see
as long as it doesn't say I have
anything oh it says that 80.
because the name saved
isn't the game great
I also forget that there's the opposite
in this game even though there's inspiro
so this was the period of moving over to
all the saving but not every game had it
so basically
yeah I basically have to everything I
forgot that I had to say before doing
the end sequence
but whatever
let's go back to the very start uh
let's not scroll back
that's awesome quite annoying in this
game
every single level and the page 20 is
quite slow as well
while you started the End by accident
anyway well
well you can still leave that area you
don't have to drink your tea
which I would assume you can leave that
area
because there's a dog house there too so
you can say
[Music]
well I didn't do much before
uh
during the last area anyway
[Music]
jumping train a train to Lake minarama
will be leaving shortly
yeah this train will derail at some
point
as usually stops his toe as he walks
upstairs
being the physics systems
there we go
back to Clarksville time to 100 track
visits Clarksville
that train track is rough
and the trains are reversing
is that allowed
[Music]
now it goes forward a goings forward
they must have turned around at some
point
[Music]
[Music]
it's the step off on the face and what
okay
so I got four more spells here and
that's the last bone
um
and you can use this button too
[Music]
which it kind of like the Sparks thing
we're gonna Point towards the next smell
ing human smells here
[Music]
somewhere here
[Music]
comes your brother
but
[Music]
it's like up here
because the only place is in the
direction doesn't point up or down at
least Sparks was that
[Music]
do you get a general idea of where it is
in like a 2d
defense pop down
[Music]
okay
what is it
maybe it's like inside the building
without climbing on the roof
oh whatever that's right
you must be inside
oh there it is
a dog just fell down from the roof and
no one cared
and he's hurt
he only feel better after he eats his
bone
oh yes life is good
the dog fell off the roof no wait that's
not what is up look at cat
no a kitten is not here so I can mess
with a cat right
let's move on to the next area
is complete now
it's I see it's kind of hard to see like
here's two missing bones
what is
today's
okay I guess if it's not really clear if
there is a missing bone or not I guess
I'm not missing about but they sure
could have made it easier to determine
if there's a bone or not
made a count or something
[Music]
okay let's go on a snippet here
oh there it is
I have a very bad feeling about this
because he doesn't want to jump over
just jump over already
[Music]
okay let's move
here I see something here no there was a
human
but it is still in this direction
hopefully it's not on the roofs or
something
[Music]
I don't know is it
now I did here I'm blind
[Music]
and
the last one summer
[Music]
inside
okay track this dog
[Music]
oh yep
thanks
Doug has been trapped there for hours
the owner doesn't know where the dog is
oh the dog is free
I won not my problem anymore
[Music]
it doesn't seem to care about the dog
anymore well
wait a minute so there's one of the
bones
lying on the ground that I'm missing
because I suppose you think this is
funny
because he gave me the bones that's not
doggy want a question though
are you trying to insult me
practice that kids
this is surrounded dog house oh yes life
is good okay I didn't pick up one of
these bones
that was why I'm response missing one
okay I got all the bones good
[Music]
I'm not sure if you need a sign for it
and here I'm missing one smell
no problem I can pick it up
[Music]
straight ahead
[Music]
okay straight the hands no way I'm a dog
not a mountain dog
you can jump into it
that I can climb up there anyway but
man
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
where is this
does that really give me a direction
that's coming up
is it
this is over here
[Music]
inside this tunnel
the deep tunnel but there's nothing in
here
can I get on top of the tunnel no
it's not a mountain goat
[Music]
right it's here
uh silly of me
yeah this is eight enough this one here
I can show why this
anything out I'm ready to be annoying so
here's the mission which you can do an
infinite amount of times
so I can do it now and get another bone
is once you have up here but it will cut
it comes on the
bonimeter which is looks like a steak
below all the smells
and then of the completeness and I have
to work
this I can probably cut through this
make it a bit shorter
depending on how quickly he wants to
jump off other
it seems like damage that that might not
actually a good thing nearly actually
restored from happening comes up and
then I have to walk all the way over
here well the same
note and then I have to work back all
the way to
and then I have to do that 90 times
and after doing all that
what will I get from that probably
nothing
[Music]
just straight ahead
that takes forever yeah that's I think I
forgot about the word
among other bird
s smelling
deep
[Music]
yeah
I know it's the experiment I don't have
to do it if if people aren't interested
[Music]
I am forced to pick up two bones so I
only have to pick 88.
phones from that challenge
I'd say that's actually saves me
and also I have to put the ball in the
hoop three times each time without
mistakes because every mistake I have to
retry
every mistake will just add one more
attempt
you don't have to do it three times in a
row at least
we just have to
think it if that's not how we call it
three times
that was a long jump more like that more
often
[Music]
hydrate since no one's
redeeming that
yeah I think
30 minutes on their outfits is a bit too
large actually to be honest
thank you I'll head right again
[Music]
a small heart rate because a little big
hydrate before
[Music]
so where was that blue smell
I mean I forgot about it I had
disability
on the completed wrong side thing
[Music]
wait what
[Music]
why are you directing me
this doesn't make sense
[Music]
yeah this doesn't mechanism to me let's
go into this tunnel and
like
[Music]
can't dry while hydrated add hijacked
too but I won't be trans
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
I don't exactly know how this sniffing
thing works
[Music]
I did the blue challenge once and then I
failed it and then
and then I couldn't find it again
has this spawned forever
nice to jump
another meaningless tunnel
another music slim Style
I want to do like free cam or something
in this game
[Music]
that would be more fun
let me go to water again
because I thought the bluesman was back
on that
on the edge of the market
but maybe I'm misremembering them
where's the blue smell on this level
anyway because it clearly says zero and
not eight or twelve actually
so
it can't say anything other than zero or
twelve at this moment
all right
there it is
has it always been up here
have I just been stupid this whole time
we have been sleeping sometimes
sorry for being stupid
[Music]
I never find the time to be fun
[Music]
and it's like a big spouse and a new
location every time with me that would
be interesting maybe that's the case
oops
because I don't exactly know how this
game
I wouldn't exactly say that I'm mad
terrific
okay
that's everything here
I got everything
what's the next one
so this is the last area
this is complete
complete
complete
complete
missing one in the water mill
how am I missing one at the one where
was the watermel again
was
yeah I don't remember what it means was
but they should be probably science for
that
follow designs
wow strange race
coming to eat me
[Music]
okay let's see
thank you
it's the chicken farm and the village
[Music]
and music
it's it's the new PS3 remix of this
music it just stuck gets stuck said
Farmhouse Village fields
okay
[Music]
watermelon
oh yeah it didn't work here
is the Watermill the place we go with it
IX yes it is
you know somehow Mr bone here
ready to do the two missions oh no I I
never picked up the bill
oh yes
someone put food on top of
come to Daddy
I'll live in my relax
it was more fun when they say hey hey
hey hey I can't do it
anyways
he says X in every possible way except
for just X
so I am now done I'm pretty sure I'm
done I can double check so this is done
done done done
then
done and this is like me tomorrow when
your battery is done anything
looking good
I swear that guy voice clicked this from
the a game called Big muta trackers
big mother truckers of course
I see I see what they did with that I
thought it's just so when people say
that
what game are you playing big mother
trucker
anyway
chain just came in
they sure have
dark moments
[Music]
before train the train leaves
it didn't barely stopped before it went
away
okay then oh it's shaking as it arrives
[Music]
I'm not surprised that the person would
voice out both dog's life and a game
called the big Moda trackers
sounds about right
that's like about the what I would
expect
[Music]
okay
so
let me find more of the Phoenix Maps
first
then on the animation
powder inside okay
let me go inside the cafe because you
are receiving by the dog in yours Peach
is talking at you I still love you yes I
do now today
human smelling human
[Music]
another cat
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
we've been hiding inside
but yeah it is
sure love putting them at like the
border of the next area
now as you try to pick them up you're
accidentally walk in the next time yeah
[Music]
Swedish phrase oh sorry sorry I didn't

[Music]
there's nothing wrong person I know but
yeah
I wanted to hear anyway I can't go to
that person and see if it's just like
at some point
[Music]
anyway and what more did I have here I
have one more bone it's probably
attacked on someone and like I said done
the mission oh there it is
[Music]
you'll need lots of strength if you're
going to look for my missing dog take
this bone
[Music]
oh okay so you gave me a mission to do
who could live without them
and I tried to do the mission because I
didn't understand what you wanted me to
do and all I had to do was to talk to
you again
what
it's not
our sky
that you mean else can
Jack else
thank you
I don't know which whichever they used
in the games this is completed
is
and it doesn't change any of these
things
[Music]
camera stuck
sadly
so
there you go I can do that but then I
said don't remember no I don't remember
how to do
thousand Swedish

Mr Bones

what's another one two very close
together
it's packed a healthy smells in one
location
gosh armpits
it would be
and someone wanted me to speak like
Swedish foreign
like I I think I got the messages from
at least two people maybe more
but they think it's a terrible idea
another day is like for the game in
Swedish this will be like if it's
available and in that case I need to
basically check if the game is available
and I have to basically
maybe disable it the redeem or something
and don't ever give allows you to change
the language in the middle of the game
this dog has a lot of time
but we're not done yet we have one more
challenge
[Music]
at last a peeing game marked the corners
let's go three two step Circle go
[Music]

find my dog

[Music]
I mean know what your dog is

in that case this song is very slow
[Music]
this car driver is like crazy now that's
the that's the person getting Pummel
pelted with tomatoes Tomatoes Tomatoes
big Seafood I told you not to wander off
I need you to get rid of some rats

bell that's where those dog Nappers said
they were headed with Daisy
time to find and rescue Daisy oh yes she

I hope not Redskins last
no can I get through here and finally
smells then
[Music]
well too often sweet
doing some slime I'm here okay a few
smells there that's what I need one more
[Music]
you must be outside I'm walking into the
wall tip the trash cans yeah it wasn't
possible
foreign
there we go
car
that's not training but
I'm gonna post down left three bones
left I wonder what their response
this car gets run over
there's a car this dog got run over by
car parking
there they are
knee bones
Two bows in it one outside
you need game audio anyway
so that was the hotel
and this is the end of the road so let's
go back into the other place wait I
forgot one thing
[Music]
oh
well
let's jump that far
I got the same
someone had a box at
age sorry about that
who
adds a certain interval wrote the
write a message basically it got a safe
that was clever
and but it would be better if you could
make the Bots only do that to certain
depending which game you're playing
let's go out on the mountain
because I think I didn't pick up all the
smells here
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
limited even though it could probably do
like a full frame rate while I'm
streaming from the console but I can't
but I don't know if you can't lifting
floor
dog food
but I don't know if the game itself runs
I mean they must run it
[Music]
don't fall down oh they're fighting
outside if
[Music]
welcome cat Rollins I was fantasy here
there's some
Dark Adventure
rabbit on a dog venture
a dog is sniffing for smells from for
human smells
I think these smells just appear
[Music]
come on come on
now it is three centimeters across the
building
[Music]
is apparently not up here
hi
hi Collins cat
Rollins a combined cat
combining Captain Rollins Collins
okay
hydrate
[Music]
do you you
no I'm a dog not a mountain goat
another thing mountain gets would jump
down either but
okay
my question was do you want to be called
cat or rodents
or cat Rollins I could say different
things in short
[Music]
I know you're blocking the way
[Music]
you're in that way
like it's cats that have nine lives
here maybe
[Music]
glitches
[Music]
apparently not
I want to Spencer
why the area
how are you I'm doing well cool
[Music]
it is cool when people are doing well
waiting for the moment I can be cool
okay
he didn't like the jumping around
is it not about here
I'm so confused of women
not so what are those things connected
to you anyway
they're bending but I don't see anything
it's connected
[Music]
family I can't really find food up here
[Music]
well
one out
I went there but
there's a pass up here which I'm not
sure if I didn't explore
look at face
[Music]
[Music]
yeah this is slow
[Music]
yeah him what's for lunch
I'm about whenever we find the last melt
get your lunch
[Music]
maybe it's like Alicia on here I never
explored this I think
[Music]
jump up jump up thank you
yeah I'm confused for the smell is
oh it was hiding behind the tree there
it was
oh yeah I forgot about the outfit change
too
okay time to get the bone so you can
feel healthy again
[Music]
it's working
[Music]
thank you
oh tastes great
perfect
[Music]
98.
[Music]
can save it while
I'm here anyway
I was good to do
it's either cleared
and it's before that I guess so
[Music]
Iran
[Music]
well in that case I just have to find
those two remaining smells in the
previous area
[Music]
[Music]
mountain top
what's for lunch
I didn't hang out any no yet
so there are somewhere that direction
Direction
[Music]
make that
[Music]
we're looking the way as usual
[Music]
am I missing something obvious here
[Music]
so I think I'm missing something obvious
here
no way I'm a dog not a mountain goat
yes there it is
that's kind of miss when I walk back
[Music]
takes damage of everything
wow at last
cartoon
that's what the klanoia says that's
another game I could see
[Music]
the middle door did you remember
foreign
[Music]
which was really big on Wii
the second game of PlayStation 2
and then both games were
very mate or enhanced with the switch
[Music]
yes
[Music]
yes
welcome to the ski slab I've ever done
anything here
finally I have still haven't found
before
red spells
and I'm still doing hand markings
[Music]
oops sorry about that
are you in a stalemate here
foreign
[Music]
as far as I know since this I think the
drive on the left
because it is a British game they travel
not because it's a British gameplay I've
seen them drive on the left and I assume
that's because it is a British developer
still I put that U.S flags in some
locations which I really don't really
get
[Music]
sounds perfect
[Music]
this is something for local dog yeah
probably
let's find
[Music]
I still haven't found all the orange I
did
[Music]
except snowman smelling like a bird but
I get there is a turkey waitaki
[Music]
I think a second one out
why are you controlling someone else's
body can you deal with everyone
[Music]
I mean I guess you still feel the pain
so
this that argument
maybe the uncomfortable because
not for the other toxic
there you go
this is obvious
am I changing
[Music]
and yeah that is exactly what I wanted
[Music]
nice jump
respect get back to Jake just start the
time in
[Music]
[Applause]
okay
let's go
watch out
[Music]
and someone fell into this though
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
the duck is Frozen
[Applause]
these bones doesn't even look juicy I
mean look
one of those looks like a plastic burn
so two more I've done the two so that's
the orange
wait a minute
two more bands
I got the orange red and
pink
but doesn't one of those
in all three give you bones
no I'm confused here
[Music]
I guess the other Smith on this
slope here which is hard to navigate
trust with slipperness
[Music]
they're dry as a bone
[Music]
I don't want this other yeah it is
okay
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
okay I got that
[Music]
now I just need a way to
hit that one
[Music]
thank you
but that's how I do it
no problemo baby Jakey had Superior bone
power drink is tired one go
[Music]
this one pretty easy
sleeves
[Music]
I don't want her to have anything to do
with you
I don't think I'm
here girl yes everyone
foreign
[Music]
oh yeah that's this one you don't get a
bone from
[Music]
it's now or never knucklehead
[Music]
where it is a closer child
[Music]
it's now or never knucklehead
laughs
you know it's staring at each other
concept
[Music]
that is quite a trick
[Music]
a goodbye dog even though you're around
this area and I don't really get the
whole yeah now that comes I think
yeah I didn't get that one thing
you get if it's like a character that
just shows up for a certain cutscene and
then not so many disappears
but a dog runs around this area so
you don't like the dog has to walk away
I must I don't think most men games that
don't even have a sequence of the dark
walking away anyway
this game is so weird
a lot of decisions they're delicious
can you find some more color teeth
now I refuse to
[Music]
there's one more here
I found enough account
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
I'll just try to now give the area
all right
watch him and smells how am I supposed
to find the human smell
are these things
[Music]
I found the human smell
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
then yeah you're basically standing on
the side of the company like just slip
and slide down
[Music]
they're still in a statement
[Music]
Wahoo at last
well let's see
don't forget to save
[Music]
I'll try to basically come
meet with what was I thinking
what's this hilarious
I need to check that
I'm just really like Canary is missing
but now it's the whole
complete
yeah double checking complete
complete
complete
and complete
complete
and this is Boom City and even that was
complete but let's move on to Boom City
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
uh I didn't remember
[Music]
oh well
yeah of course yeah arrive in the train
closer to the cafe
to then
luckily this Trail lives in like two
seconds so I have to step on it again
[Music]
[Music]
it's a bit of the scenery you've been
cutting it through the ground there
I mean it is a bit of a camera cutting
through the ground so you see the black
void
you know some the picture it meant to be
like the next thing you see when you go
to that area
but I'm arriving by train not working so
the picture is wrong
and doesn't the picture change depending
which area you come from
train
our audience the exact same questions
we'll be leaving shortly
now but if I take the train do you
regain your health well well take it
easy train
and also should have realized the train
that is facing towards the tunnel is the
one moving to the next area and the
train facing away from the tunnel
it's not moving to the next area
the train is
I don't want to ride on that train it's
so jumpy
I mean again the camera is clipping
through the ground there or what is
going on
now this should be the angry angry angle
they should have used for the camera
I went back to Clark's well I should
have checked with that
I asked guy and see what this sounds
like in Spanish but that train is
getting ready
yeah
be careful about the train
yeah he's basically recovered to the
whole train right he probably ate some
food on the train
so anyway I'm complete this area was
complete as I confirmed
wait monster the mission
you got the sheriff
but it's the sleeping bag this was Too
Faced mission
I was confused about who the person was
and then there's the park which I did
too but I didn't see it
in the park
so let's do some speed run
I like it a lot
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
bonealicious
hey my music Wicked thanks little dude
yeah
Jake you doofus
I think that's his wrong son
he plays this song A lot but that's the
wrong song right
thank you
[Music]
we are going to have cash kittens and no
no
it's easy
foreign
[Music]
yeah
yeah I'm playing this again
[Music]
thanks little dude that's only two more
left go for it
[Music]
what's that Alika okay
that's an existing song you can play
that even though it's your own
performance and therefore it's okay
anyway
[Music]
yummy ooh this stink
if you say so
he loves playing for that so
[Music]
okay at least I know
about it
can I say step on the bench
get out versus wait one more piece would
be awesomely Sweet Home Alabama
this is different
[Music]
because it sounds like other devastated
from The Simpsons maybe if someone
should check the credits when it's game
I think I did maybe no maybe
foreign
[Music]
I've got more bones than this guy three
time to have a little fun with this part
don't worry this channel I should edit
videos this channel is 18 class now so
you can go ham with your jokes
everything okay don't like
it don't don't like me a really explicit
like thing for my own eyes to say I
can't think
but I don't feel like you have to
restrict yourself too much
[Music]
and if you are you the other person
which I assume is either
Seth Rollins because Michael may be Papa
Maybe
[Music]
some of us one more
[Music]
so if I forgot the party because but you
don't try question
[Music]
that's your thoughts
[Music]
thank you I do have bad memory and I
have trouble remember my name
nothing good combination
probably have to appertain things
because I have a picture
[Music]
you can probably leave more than art
combination
far out my brain in another dog's body
[Music]
is that some kind of new scene theme
though
[Music]
I'm just going to take care of my kitten
good to think kitten is not here to see
me stir me these kittens
what else am I supposed to do
kittens are running away again
yeah I'm so slow the cats are so fast
yeah but if what if I give you the
chance can you just hold it
[Music]
okay that's three cats
[Music]
or cats
and there should be one more cat but
I can't
I'll tell Keith okay
I like to
to read your two messages after I get
this
[Music]
does that count
that's counted my hero now I can feed
them even if his name appeared I
wouldn't recognize that no but we could
confirm
if the if the name was part of the
credits and therefore they would add the
name to indb
in that movie database
um
because they had a credit stand to
confirm oh yes 100 and it's twisting
but when games don't have voice cast
which is 10 when I don't which happens a
bit too often and they cannot confirm
because the therefore it's harder to
actually they have to go through other
sources like
probably find that tweet from inside
Japanese saying that oh I played Spyro
or something like that but they had to
do for reignited because reignite
doesn't have voice casting credits
it's terrible
but anyway so
that means that if they forget the name
to indp you can check here it is and
then you can go to The Simpsons because
they have confirmed voice cards because
it's not a game
yeah
and then see if you think it's the same
name there you go
that's what I meant
that was a lot of words
dude I'm gonna write a song about you
I'll call it the awesomely Wicked dog
yeah
meanwhile I'm off to find Daisy
something tells me she's not too far
away
this game requires like skipping
cutscenes
names
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
okay let's continue
[Music]
dog still has Birds others
the running challenge
three
takes like three seconds
the time gets down to Sierra as soon as
he cares
I could have didn't see all the time was
[Music]
hello do you want to see a trick
I'll show you a trick look at what I can
do what an ugly dog stop that
okay
before
it's too early okay and that's it
oh it's my mimic time again
[Music]
oh
take and take a take Jake Jake looks
uncomfortable
it's now or never knucklehead
[Music]
[Music]
is so broken your move my man
[Music]
I'm gonna add in one more part
[Music]
and then something complicated
yep
your move my man
filthy mutt
[Music]
I polygons are really made for these
animations
my dog again working in by the tree then
walking out the hardest side what's it
what's the whole point of walking away
like that
oh hello dog again
such a strange thing
okay since I'm basically done here
let's save
and then I'll trigger the
[Music]
hair into that
[Music]
anyway
don't mind that sound
thinking a triggered the
this thing
[Music]
if that smells hey it's that cartwheel
dog come back here and then I walk out
from this place
I think I should be able to do that
promise they can't skip past scenes
[Music]
this place is terrible for my allergies
Wayne I'm thinking of opening up a
hypoallergenic dog grooming pilot what
so people like you can enjoy playing
with doggies hey guys
yes sorry we had some difficulties Miss
peaches is enough it's relaxed
oh yeah
when I brought in my load she blew her
top I said boom City dogs were filthy
said you wanted a nice clean Clarksville
dog to be the first and it does did you
say yes I did say no I think she wants
to hurt them nice doggies Wayne oh for
pity's sake Dwayne stop sniveling
sometimes it looks like you're just
adding animations
had something
foreign
[Music]
I'm gonna see if I can do that
you need to replay this part the whole
cutscene or not reply anything I have a
very bad feeling about this
don't catchers here but I don't see the
dog
[Music]
oh there's okay
yeah I could leave
and now I can stand here without
thinking anything
[Music]
thank you
so in that case that's installed it
[Music]
bones who could live without them
[Music]
and then I guess the next one is on the
street too
because
yep there it is
here
it's further along
[Music]
this next one
[Music]
maybe this one nope
[Music]
again
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
this is not going to give me the bone
when I find on the
on these Maps I don't think that's what
oh it is there
I don't think that's how it worked but I
could be wrong
so now
the dark still hasn't burned
why
dog doesn't have any bones
I got out of Depends
I'll get it
there's all dogs no like the other dogs
have had like
turquoise spells or something but that
one has bones smash like a pearl
a bone
okay so this area is clear now no it's
not
I did I did oh I didn't
yeah I did these songs right
am I stupid
am I just
yeah he doesn't have a bone anymore
that's completely bad
[Music]
and the dog doesn't have bone anymore
okay
you did the song sheets yeah
I did this there's no more bone here
a bit
that's about 2001 am I stupid again
ah
I like it a lot
there's last one
let's move over to the next time yeah
the most annoying area in the game as a
green one I think it's a new one
it shouldn't be blue
let's pick up this street smells first
I'm not sure what it's sweet smells like
human oh brother who cut the cheese
assuming by
that's the partner of mine
okay just pray
[Music]
because the purple ones
[Music]
because I remember this
because it's the most annoying of them
all that's why I remember it
if you think the cat mission was
annoying
[Music]
and about dog
oh yeah this very fast stock is not
going to make it easy
[Music]
go
[Applause]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
in the morning
[Music]
look
another U.S flag
I guess I mean yeah it's like a
combination of
because they're they're painted the why
they're driving on the right in this
place actually they're trying on the
left is like minawa
and
in
better repair
I don't know which side to drive on
I think
[Music]
really pumpkin
yeah really
[Music]
[Music]
I mean
never mind
get hold of the cars
that is good because in that case I can
actually do the recognition or like you
hold up each other
okay in that case actually not the
degree murder too dark
where's the
oh yeah the purple one is
I don't know
everyone is
not that one
it was lower
[Music]
I just do it in a stupid daughter that
might be it it might actually not be
that hard it just I don't know which
attitude order is because that's one of
them
[Music]
not one of them
[Music]
okay nothing in here
[Music]
I should leave a person in that hotel
room
[Music]
Maybe
[Music]
okay I can see that there is nothing in
there but I do have to step it up I
guess
press this one
you have to go into
which is just so impossible to get out
of because the sound you have to stand
in
so precise
[Music]
[Music]
exactly how it came handsome game
because
I just can't find the area you're
supposed to standing I have no problem
to getting out of the other one
I currently have struggling getting out
of this one
really dark
they drink the whole mission this is
this is why this mission is going to be
the most
annoying one day finally
I don't know how I did it it just worked
on a sudden
thank you
[Music]
I need that Maps I can Mark out
which path I should take is this I think
this might be the amount I should start
with
[Music]
delicious
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
you know where the last one is
[Music]
that's a sad problem
[Music]
I should probably end with that one
just need to figure out one of the last
ones
that's the next problem I don't know
where the last one is and there are
those but not that one
[Music]
just walk in there while I'm
running past see if I can remember
there's actually two more no it's no no
that's not what I meant
[Music]
and I know what where one of those is I
don't know where the other one is
[Music]
what happens
personal you don't want to have today in
specific order performance
[Music]
[Music]
yeah I promise Jake is tired juicy
[Music]
okay now that I open this up and I know
how to do it
let's do it for real
because now now I'm figuring it out I've
been thinking the wrong one but just
do that annoying one last just end the
whole thing there
I don't have to leave
[Music]
that seems like a cute idea
boy now that's what Jake calls stink
[Music]
s then
yeah
thank you
[Music]
maybe they tested by doing this specific
order
I don't even think about it
[Music]
this one is done from exiting and now to
the one that's hard to exit which is the
last one
[Music]
you should don't have to exit now this
is
okay that was pretty easy I was just
stupid before when I struggled with this
one
like I heard they tested trying to leave
this building
okay now it worked
and as the next annoyance that dog which
has is holding up the jacket at the
moment is running around here and and as
it approaches these these move up to
letting dog run under meaning that you
cannot revised
if the target runs past so the dog being
stuck here in traffic
it's a good thing because then it's not
messing up the Mythic
he did it I'm actually surprised
[Music]
yeah let's eat some random
so where did I put the green smells I
didn't put in an environment
in the remaining pinks means

black
squares on the sides because attack
taxi cars don't look
and it's that's the only way every
single taxi looks like it all around the
world
of a single other design exit
[Music]
and same with the police cars they are
black at the front black and black and
white in the middle
that's how every single police looks
like around the world not a single
difference
[Music]
[Music]
over there

play some video games and you'll see
doesn't matter if it's

what a terrible dryness drives
on to the
payment
you're driving off the road
you're driving like the side of the road
he's going to kill someone
okay
oh yeah there was more smells up here I
couldn't reach because
with a gun decided to shoot dogs
innocent dogs just looking for smells
as an illegal YouTube
I guess it's not illegal because police
is doing it
it's more like a safety hazard
which is awesome
I've heard basic like
I suggested the police shouldn't do it a
second thing because it's dangerous and
people say yeah but it's not illegal
yeah no but still dangerous someone can
get hurt
like
just because you can legally run the red
light as like this
please driver and it's technically not
illegally you're going to cause an
accident if you continue doing that
[Music]
that's what I'm talking about now it's
silly
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]

there's a lot of double child in this
area
okay this is the place
and they do have to stop by the red if
they're not
um related to an emergency yeah no but
Simply the Best
what they're supposed to do and what
they actually do and if it's considered
illegal yummy

all this area is completely
hey papa thanks again for your help
house
dog's life
company
[Music]
you dark sleeve

let's go about
20 minutes that same person
Maybe
maybe back to the park I got everything
here
am I complete now
and my complete
so everything here that's pretty
location everything here
and then it's just duck pound so let's
say first
[Music]
he Life Is Life
I see
do you spell spider s-p-y-d-e-r
and box
aw I guess
now screw that
probably
yep I am sad and that guy bought this
Roman
balik from
GTA4
picture
should I play GK
and discussion again okay it doesn't
play the focus in just this part
Ramon
all right if that's
let's head right before this Mission
let's do a reason first I have a very
bad feeling about this
I am still hydrating come on let's move
it
and jump over here
I found his off to me
correct spells I'm sure of it
I don't have any spells I don't know
what you're talking about
[Music]
okay
talk
okay
do I have to talk after me
this level is scary yeah listen to this
music
I won't look back where's my review
mirror
let's do it
is this the dog pound or underworld I
think the dog pound is the only one from
the Thomas
foreign
and I made a strange noise anyway
yes it is both
[Music]
getting to me
yeah that dog is
straight behind
that's not a good time
thank you that's a frog right
all right I can't do it
[Music]
that's the that's my best attempt okay
but at least
dog catching business
I'm gonna pursue my dream a program in
computer games kill it
you got the entrance to miss Peach's
place
[Music]
cute fun fun
now the dog is a scary dog
okay
now let's pick up on things oh yes life
is good
bones that's what it's all about
fantastic
fantastic
[Music]
you should say
um
if you don't say it
I don't know okay they see that's that's
the first I can do
and let's face it fantastic
I guess we can do that too let's
increase time
I don't know how he said if
I don't know anything
without enough to be heard
[Music]
from his shield then but
don't know how well it works I like it a
lot
[Music]
so and then I think there's just one
more bone yep
and then this game is 100 complete
bones who could they live without them
125 out of 125 months
call that a success
hmm
and now I can say
so I have the game saved at 100
[Applause]
and also one more thing around the bones
that's not the correct page go back
I also have all the moves
unlocked which is the
back one through five and I guess that's
the one the ones you unlock
so I guess the last thing I don't need I
mean the game is 100 complete already
there's no point of doing this this last
last part how do I
grow out
the only thing I know how to do that is
holding a cat
I guess I learned like the last mission
there too
I can't skip this sorry I remember you
let's go over the comments in that case
filthy little man yeah
can't wait for you to run Tomb Raider
you seem interested in the community one
of those clocks I'm about to be fair I'm
not sure if I'm interested in the
community I don't see if I'm interested
in any Community to be honest
[Music]
[Music]
foreign now
hello
it's um
can I leave this area
because now I will unlock the last area
yeah I can leave it
I like the last air I like the so now I
basically unlocked everything
I guess you could consider the game
why is the center after to talk about
the last thing
okay so now and now I can consider the
game 100 complete
for real
let's eat this food as well
let's save again
even laughing their face is socious
that's a good that's a good way to
describing your face you're
ready you're ready trust him ready night
night six is pretty easy the levels I
play are quite difficult and I also play
challenges yeah
I'm ready
when should I start
let's kill Daisy
what's this the big machine something
tells me that Miss peaches isn't making
ordinary countries
oh my gosh Daisy Daisy
hear me Daisy I've got to turn off the
big machine but how
okay let's uh let's have her killed by
something honey okay this is important I
don't even know what this thing is a
heater
this is like
um
giving me
I'm trying to think of the name postal
too this is postal 2 vibes
like the sound
the look of it everything
you probably have used the same
I wouldn't be sad I wouldn't be
surprised if you actually can find these
exact songs
[Music]
okay there we go
thank you
oh you can actually the this is an
actual dot because it
because it tricked the sniffing because
it does funny
and someone and that's how I'm gonna
show something about this is this is an
action dog what are you talking about
an actual
an actual dog and
thing
I'm not going to get a good look
it's slicing and biting
okay too late
jump down already
there's a Jake
you calculate basic die if you don't
turn I'd say no
[Music]
I need some bloody machine
and I mean that literally
and there's some Daisy cat food
[Music]
again then you just respawn
there you go that's the um bad ending of
the game I guess
I'm about to complete the game
I don't care
and I got cutting means I just want to
do that too
yeah that's the game a hundred percent
complete and I managed to do that within
the three hours of this stream
nothing horrible ending I thought it was
an amazing ending
she died
I bloody saw blades
but literally
you didn't get to see her spin sliced up
but
oh well
you don't get everything
and then
Jake
barely didn't want to jump off the boxes
so I couldn't
see it properly
and then you also even got to see they
can't can't cat food hmm
wasn't that great
getting Tomb Raider now
same rate should I should I start the
game register next
game which would be tomorrow
I mean I don't have anything else to do
though let's move over
ending screen which still doesn't say
anything about stream over can you see
which I should add
yeah you got the bunny transition I made
it myself
and bending backhand yes it's very it's
a very funny thing
it's sliced up and put it into a can of
my it's a cat it's it's cat food
it's a cat food made of dogs
and I got your triangle
pyramid because that's how you would
pronounce it
is a good games
or
kid game
time to go to the store now yeah that
sounds good
and there's a lawnmower again
so
I I don't know if it should
start a whole new game
with just a single stream tomorrow
and then got into that a week later or
if I should start the new game on the
next Saturday
so I guess I could do that thing I
wanted to do with the game on Sunday but
I said it's a very slow and boring
process so maybe I shouldn't do that I
could do some small game that I could
probably play through in like three
hours
or
no that's a bad idea
let's not statisticated
um yeah I don't have anything else
or I could do that thing tomorrow anyway
I'm still balling possible no I don't
want to do they have the ball impossible
level
I just
it would probably take me three I wish
to complete it
I don't want to do that I I don't have
the mental capacity just
do it
I don't think I have anything else
exactly
I could do C3 racing Maybe
because I didn't complete that
or something
unless you have something
yeah that too
yeah I didn't complete that
although I don't feel like playing it
anyway because I got bored of it
I just have to come up with something it
would be a surprise surprise stream
tomorrow
oh wow
doing something
and that sounds good right the price
change tomorrow it will be what we
should be
exactly a wild card that'll be nice
so
I'm here
I need to
thank you
so
thanks for staying here I don't think I
heard anything else dude
finish off with so
I rate I don't know who to read
Benny

the Fate may cause
STDs I don't like that name
he just finished a speed run but it is
he
got like four four people

Maize Maize make
the grocery shopping
stop
because STDs

don't think it's gonna work
okay bye bye
