I completely forgot to

start the program even

oh can I

was sitting here

preparing the final stuff bringing up

the prediction on my phone and

but uh

yes so

let's see if it shows off the screen

there we go now

Let's test this okay

something's going on do we have a few

people

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

kindness

for the game and continue

where I left off

oh yes this is rolling monster so yeah

yeah it seems Seems yeah I have no idea

what this whole thing works

because I'm too poor team enough

forwarded to try it out

anyway moving on

so no coins for me until another 24 days

um

entertainment

her place is a clean you

at last my portal is working again

congratulations let's go to the moving

Creek there and explore

um

hello Rocket Man nice to see you I can

also see that message before if you're

point

another pool of lava here

at the very start

pick this up Sparks pick this up

some beautiful graphics

rhinox are running rampant around here

I'm sorry he's insane

I don't remember who says it

around through the first one I bouncing

the second one

it's like

I mean pushed by this line

those guys remind me after giant right

you can't find Animal Crossing

hmm

well I was going to say

they might be beasts on me but I don't

seem to say anything they're based on

another

form of clay creature

Ricky

look it's a girl Dragon you can tell

that by the Bell

that's a Slugma better catch it only

this

[Music]

thing first this last slugs

[Music]

flowers you can't have flowers on this

area

be sure to keep your friend Sparks the

dragonfly healthy Spyro do you believe I

can't do that

actually I feel a sense of doubting

almost got sliced

speaking

out there keeping Sparks at Full House

thank you let's do that that's what the

ah no I couldn't do it let's let's not

look at Sparks being hurt

because he takes them into the sky we're

spies that hurt well

it's right again

I press the playing button

um

this switch to

I inspired last time so what about in

the name of the scene there's nothing

again

[Music]

is it a reference despair

multiple shiny master ball

a shiny Monster Ball where did you get

that from

I don't know what the

slug my [ __ ] look like and how you

determine I know how you determine if

it's

looks like

and sunny just makes me want more than

just a single Color Spot

elaboras welcome welcome

let me know if I start a prediction now

you can only do the positions I mean

but if some of you have to leave at some

point I can start it curly

you guys let me know because the later I

can start it uh

although I might actually reach the

person anyway so maybe I should start it

good morning did you know that the

master ball

in the Pokemon games it's just the

normal what is the musical

this music

man

no I mean

visit here music describe guys here

awkward I didn't know this was a thing

named Sergeant bird is currently an

important Mission inside of a cage tough

tough for luck

don't think I've ever used a spike in

any place in me neither

be like me as always but I hope you have

a great stream yeah let me know should I

start it let's start a prediction so you

can do the

uh

and so your phone numbers you can do you

put in your points because I don't know

how early I will actually reach boss

because it's basically this level one

won't happen and then it's main option

of flying lemon Spyro you're just in

time I saw two egg thieves run through

this door I'm not just in time I'm Spyro

the Dragon that confused me with Justin

I'm having it let's go let's go

as many points as you want we already

have one prediction one person that's

looking fine

funny bird is in a cage shame

well I guess you just have to be

executed

awesome where's the music this game

also have never played a spider game but

I know that

that bear is a Siege and a charlatan

I guess you could call the money back as

I see

I see every stone and something like

maybe he has film and stuff and actually

stoned patch

yeah

and because he does sell using that

doesn't make massive

but if he is throwing things together

he's the monocolory it's always

no it is priceless uh oh yeah no wait I

thought it was the opposite when

something is sold one thousand when

something is so cheap it's uh it's a

steam

[Music]

prices are not as stealing

come on spikes

you're supposed to steal the teacher you

notice that

who are you too

I think that's my money back is a thief

when you

plastic spider is gonna run a stealing

gems

that's clearly it's not the ownership of

spider

the initiative made the arrows invisible

the first time around

so you don't think this is a broken sub

shot because everyone I've seen what's

in playing this who doesn't know about

the game will always come around and

look for a switch of some sort

there is none

Moira is it not finish and it's a

character because this is a pillow

Moana

activate the supercharge you'll be able

to catch him yeah so so this exceeds

does not used to they can't do I mean

look it's it's pink they can't use

Superstars themselves on the spider it's

just that this this is a fast one

you know it's the first one because the

red one the red is fast

enough

very good

you can get in two laps nope

well close close

no

I'm a massively snake

no because

is it one left picky oh it feels

no one else

oh that one of my scrapings there we go

escape in the back permit

we have three people putting in

prediction now whoa whoa already

one thousand towards there it is

10 and a half thousand times when I will

do my best

excuse me it's fair

bent on my oh wait I started

spent all my coins on this don't let me

down oh

hey I basically have to if if you write

that he's got the Scottish accent don't

want my coincidence they don't let me

down

I have a garden or gems in this area

when I just need to rescue

use this one

yeah and I do have the key and these

things like everything respond

that's a CQ

you knowing if I have fancy gems on the

ground Finders Keepers I mean he

sometimes are some random breaking vases

okay play spiral without bringing a

single base

[Music]

foreign

oh yeah but I don't care what I'm

thinking so

that wouldn't be me and honestly it's

always

a wife regardless of your Disney My

Portal is

let's go to your world and she shall

sure

she shall Sean

yeah

Dragon if the Dragon

okay let's see let's listen to this why

one my friend

[Music]

oddly enough the rhinox failed to see

the humor in the story and stuff my

friends in the jail behind you

humorous

oh no they're naked

no I do I do want them what outfit is

doing

the considering which outfits kind of

what kind of outfit characters wearing

but spiraling trash I don't think the

the bunny suits outfit I made for Hong

Kong is

as bad

keep using that ball

first time now

another one

yep

oh my it recognizes my bisexuality it

sounds like a funny story it does sound

like a funny story

someone crashed your vehicle this is a

really funny story

hello tutorial time if you want a quick

summary of your progress in a world you

can press the select button to open the

atlas page for the world you are in okay

let's try that

[Music]

remember this is the level this is in

the world okay

I mean I don't I think they are very

inconsistent about what a world is

foreign

you've got a world with words inside of

it which worked inside of it

and then in this game they've added some

areas but at least the Subways are not

called worlds because otherwise you

couldn't go one step deeper

[Music]

and very confusing

the more he's

I mean he's underwater sound

yeah let's find it it's fine when

they're on the water

[Music]

repeat this

okay yeah

[Music]

no flame challenge

[Music]

nice

there we go straight into things

[Music]

and then that's

[Music]

and this is an animus that's what you

should call him now an anonymous

[Music]

don't say that it could be confused with

the banana

but that's why you need to do the

difference in

the

emphasis

and a banana

I haven't shared something Anonymous but

I just sounds really

foreign

[Music]

just say anonymous

I call it

Anonymous yes

if you see an nns you can also there is

another word that contains that yes

other people that maybe it's usually

imagine is it possible trouble

let's jump

in a row

that sounds amazing let's go with the

Chile

everybody get more distance when gliding

oh you don't say it's almost like I just

did that

come on stop crashing the damage

[Music]

anyway

oh no dots

Sheila yes she loves me

kangaroo not Sheila did

you can do it in half the hover over

here yeah I do

born

it's the uh

it's level with the explosives

look it's Sheila

you can redesign

can honestly inside come on

there we go

do you want to translate oh hi my

friends are trying to take down a rhinoc

fortress

I love the smell of Siege dry knock in

the morning

laughs

good morning

to you too

when

it's half the time on the

election already

creature

that can swim

now do I wonder what happens when you

put other characters

foreign

[Music]

I think you can do this in

anything like that but in this game you

have to do that

[Music]

I'm using these words

out from the confusing this one

and there it is

no

is one of those

you can play as any character on this

level or any other level of water and

every character you can play as inspire

can swim

and ideas that only inspiring Sheila has

a swimming animation all of the

character videos load and that's the

second part of the tournament trial

[Music]

thank you

rhinox have built a fortress on our

beach and we're gonna blow it to

Smithereens sounds good

[Music]

all right we totally start the timers I

wasn't ready

no missed

and I only need to do this wow

I just need to turn

to complete this I don't think they care

about me and Miss only the Cannons

I don't know anyhow slabs fast

plants me with me

yeah

this is actually a shovel another Spain

yeah all enemies is instantly fine

yeah

but yes as I said

every character ends until every

character inspired inspired it's really

reunited can't swim including agent line

because when you're playing 89th level

um

and you know that's engineering from

swing and it's drowning in the water

a reference to how all primates can't

swim no that's not cheap

um

it's quite a quite a view here

it's quite a lack of water I would say

[Music]

by the thing is Agent 9 can float swing

in the united is just that the water in

the level with agent line it's your

spiral one water it will hurt everyone

who touches it

they didn't make it so agent nine

takes damage from any water he touches

that's not very nice

it's just

pretend he promised me

animals

welcome

hope you enjoy some spiders to me

doing a prediction at the moment

foreign

that doesn't count to the percentage

100 games

I consider it 100 thing when it gets the

percentage of the game to its maximum

value

unless the maximum value is bugged in

some way so in Crash I only collect gold

relics because that's what puts the

impressive energy to its marks the

platin are easiest bonus

skill points in this game does not

affect the percentage so it's just a

promise

let's go to the tunnel 11 more minutes

for the prediction yep take your time

make a decision put in as many points as

you want

ultra high speed well how real do we use

is throwing it into the tunnel look at

all these bubbles

whoa

that was quick

I'm sure you'll do well against the bus

so I'm there

is it Wireless in Searles so I want this

Rosie you spawn much higher up here in

this game on PS1 then

we

[Music]

oh my this is this is going to be

impossible for me to do

that should be a prediction how many

times you take me to do this level

that's not even hard button this isn't

this is much a harder one later on

definitely feels like everything is

being ahead it's probably smaller

foreign

I don't think this is regulated at all

so

on the TV I mean yeah

this sign where they is doing the egg to

test the tunnel but they have no no way

to retrieve it

and that seems like a massive oversight

this is sticking at least I don't die

anything

well

I want to test what happens if I don't

see here he doesn't stay in the middle

of the car on it he actually you need to

turn in the corners

right now

oh

that makes sense when I didn't took out

the enemy yeah

come on

yeah this is definitely a six plus

attempts

it's a race against the prediction

timeline

we will reach the bus first

yeah I'm not I'm not going to do

completely

however long time is left because I

can't see the alarm one of the darkest

sounds in frames for some reason

how did I drop the frames

computers acting weird

here we go

power and there's one hiding

why did I do that for some reason this

feels easy I mean okay

like I would say the steering

I'm going to say it feels easier than in

very nice but honestly this is United

but it feels like the steering system it

feels like it doesn't go as quickly

uh it feels like you have a better

or Spyro

and

I was in this

last part

this part is almost impossible in the

united but yeah it's easy

Dynamic characteristics what do you say

a Duke

Duke

which squishy eyes

anyway finally I gotta think

that took too many attempts

foreign

[Music]

uh you see us standing in a different

locations

let's do this let's let's battle the

enables

Grand Old Duke of Yorks

did you want

okay

this is how we do this spell

okay

obtain it you have to become

like this is hard this is the main

prediction

I typed against

this minibus

was actually kind of tricky

well if this is an indication around you

against the boss well

good luck everyone without you okay

wow that was kind of hard drive

wow that's the first time Pluto was ever

lost

oh

Jackie

Jackie he's also a girl Dragon which you

can tell by the Bell I'll try to keep

track of that now and apparently 100% of

the character's headphones

honestly you're going to claim that

yeah

duke or Jason or girls

but

I'm not gonna say it's wrong but

I'm not going to argue I can't be named

Jason which

simulated developers are thinking that

he's lost into purple airplane you have

time but it was blue to a rhino

who for whatever understood just

recently to this over

[Music]

wrong there

[Music]

I think I think I got one in here

oh no reaction

no reaction

s

Jimmy's Jimmy Jim James

oh

then there is this part here

points

my plan worked that dumb octopus dropped

yeah

have you seen boluto he looks like he

could be a rhino yeah

primer is almost over make sure

we make sure to put in your point before

the timer is on

make sure make sure you're satisfied

with them I want to put in

is like 10 000 points

put in total

is a lot of points

you know that's one of them

complete

[Music]

switching that please help her

[Music]

yeah I should have kept trying some time

actually I could use it during the lemon

let's head over to the balloon

well thank you but I'm not sorry I'm a

dragon who just slammed into the one

number

is I'll do this one first

well you can put in some more points you

must have gotten more points in that

Rocket Man you can put in your remaining

my mouth

and so can lenient I guess there's only

a few seconds left just Spam the I had

10 points but

four three two one prediction over my

little boys is obviously behind

okay

I actually don't know how how much after

it is

like

between 1 388 of them

and also you get the gems like

destroying these things

so this is how Speedways Works in season

events

for some reason

[Music]

they give you different values also

depending on what you do

that

400 and also All-Star you don't have to

get that all in one

because you get all the gems for each

category alone

no only number one required that's only

for bragging rights

so that's what you get the egg for it

right

yeah and online gives you the egg yes

okay

in a row oh

oh I hope that doesn't happen oh Rocket

Man but I will do my best as usual to

win the first time around so

I am sorry but I will try to

win on a first try

hello

I have a question if she been playing

sauces because it does yes that really

works

fun

did someone say something

those things are right here you know

there are resources

sauce

okay another one finally shoots himself

around me

also I took out this hater

architer

that's true

depression finally the most exciting

part the race with the butterflies

the butterflies

[Music]

hey it's time to start before I close

the starting line

um

this is sound effects manual sound

effects by one thing

going

boom

um

[Music]

that's Precision thing Giver is a

completely different font that's a

simple Place versus left

the number is a different from from the

one that counts the maps but but the

for the architect is written a

completely different front from

everything else but this is somebody

threw that quickly together without

yeah someone probably changed his later

on let's just pick comic sense or

something

and make it else change later

no one changed his name

[Music]

in first place

[Music]

what is this music

the composer of dog's life make this

hmm

of the uh of the the kind of challenge

music in that game

it obviously doesn't sound like it but I

mean they kind of theme of this music

of them yeah I will I will do John

there's nothing you're learning

yes I will I will I will do all manual

sounds

let's challenge now the buzz with your

girls big young boy Bianca strikes back

oh wait this is spiral two Bianca

Strikes Back

listen carefully you stupid girl I'm

only going to ask you one more time why

haven't you disposed of that infernal

dragon

I I've tried to scare him off your

highness

but He's Just Not Afraid of Anything Not

Afraid Not Afraid why have I been

training you all these years playing

constitutional quality Magic

[Music]

with all the NPCs are speaking good high

quality whip up a monster

and eliminate him

I don't care what you do you useless

brat as long as you get rid of him

I can't say that you can kill him that

goes against the age rating of this game

you come here

[Music]

bunny

years

switching those

is that something important should have

to be announced

when I heard the Sorceress was planning

to Ambush you all got here as fast as I

could no worry well thank you Sheena

I wouldn't be able to do this without

you even though I will be amazing

are you ready

let prediction begin no swimsuit

kind of sound effect was that

distracted when we had some effect

okay phase one is well face one is

pretty easy

oh this is this oh I went in with banana

house either

I'll do this

someone

um keep my distance

[Music]

Easy Does It

exactly

it's only the first bus

go

they made this past very annoying and

very nice as soon as the fire is up

you basically have to charge almost 45

years up otherwise it starts charging

you and when it does that

you barely moves back no no

that may be

now

don't explain sometimes thank you

yes oh it was scary

this is a bit scary

it says

I think

like I said yeah I mean you're about to

explore one to two

not zero

not sure what you talking about

thank you forgetting that's

inspired on like crash it doesn't reset

your health money on tour bus it's gonna

I mean so much quick you sometimes

oh yes good encounty to begin to fight

with less than the Full House yeah I

don't know you can make the whole

predictions

[Music]

for some reason it's faster now

so I don't know what's going on in this

moment

yeah I'm probably going to die now

because

some reason is faster I know I didn't

die no

wow

okay now I died with full house at least

so you have that

if you want to count the first one or

not he started at packing that wasn't

supposed to happen

he doesn't attack until you hit 13 first

this is weird it's weird but he's he's

faster for some reason

now than the first time around

definitely because I have no problem I

mean sure I took that first time yeah

there you go

now he's scared

yes he he doesn't attack he doesn't

attack

okay he still doesn't do the flame thing

that's my point until I attack now he

doesn't see him

so he cut me off

I said they kind of caught me off guard

every day

I've never done anything

when it charges he barely go backwards

wait where's the flame

now he's getting all tricky

come on

Speed Run 50. see he doesn't attack

doesn't that hey hey get out of the way

that's how it's supposed to be oh ads

for everyone here

I see that's how you see he doesn't

attack he was cheating last time

it wasn't my fault he wasn't his baby

thank you

there we go there's an actual defeat

okay sir Grayson which is not a female

dragon if I died one or two times

depending on the count it so I was fair

enough

in that case doesn't

he doesn't make it dumb and ambiguous

in case they've never been so happy you

will win

it's just slide them out

I guess it would be like some

let's check because I can check this

yeah my favorite game hello you came a

bit

after fixing us anyway yes rocket man

predicted 7500 got that back that's

another

750 points not it's not a massive win

like a price but there are 950 points

it's something

okay Dragon you've managed to survive

longer than I expected yes but you

haven't the slightest idea what sort of

dangers lie ahead of you yeah I spent

100 Knuckles 750. whatever eggs you

found it

[Applause]

[Music]

thank you

everything

I did I wanted to write down every

character in

the Game Boy Advance games

ICP the students

now I usually rescue the Twitter first

but

let's do it in a different order

which cap which level is the other level

near

shooting it

oh he's shot one of those

I'm just that one too

shooting it

what are you doing

it was supposed to be dug to go ice

fishing today but rhinox have blocked

the path when I saw why can't control

okay I've been trying to clear it away

with this cannon but it doesn't even

shoot straight I haven't been able to

hit a dang thing on morning I mean you

hit two things you didn't quite well to

be honest

and it shoots pretty strange as far as I

could tell

it's just a ram thing

no

there we go

friends

right off screen

[Music]

[ __ ] this madness

[Music]

so you're supposed to fly from there

down there to break this

but I think they just made an oversight

because

defeating the whole purpose and that's

all we know thing

I guess put it from the window you can

kind of

see the eyes better and realize there's

something suspicious going on

and

hey spice can I beat this up

Madness this is Sparta

vaccines

yeah sorry sorry for the 50 point loss

day

by hatching themselves otherwise they

basically would start anything

[Music]

main yard main yard

anime dragon

[Music]

way too many times

[Music]

the Renaissance funny points

no problem paying that let's go and

watch the greatest show of all time

anymore what is current

but you can get you can get a high

pollution in the reflection a lot of

selection above

enough to cover her properly

use my big ice dance

it's protein they come in and smack me

with their sticks oh I sure wish I had a

partner some were courageous and strong

and handsome and purple who breathes

fire

you have a strange voice

messages

I think you're supposed to skate on the

ice skates not like step

tiptoe

oh that's a quite a high jump spider

can't even jump

it's more of above the view

[Music]

does make it easy

to see what's going on

well I was sliding out

I stopped this animation but okay

that's okay it didn't hurt as much as it

looked

[Music]

I I don't feel my outfit security is the

appropriate for this winter level

it's a bit cold

[Music]

[Music]

that's what you say what do you got for

her

yeah but

[Applause]

we did it my best performance ever

we had took a few attempts where are the

journeys

Cerny

[Music]

nah it's fine

well

[Music]

it's a nice thing

should I start a prediction for the next

episode already

this

[Music]

chain

and then I'll uh yeah that that changed

the predict points we just go back

whatever if I do is

[Music]

back to them nice I can't can I hovering

around stand nice

there we go

can if the challenges are too hard for

me I would feel better breeze

which is a good Dragon I would assume

because of the boats

that's simple both here like an opposite

Point dragon

[Music]

so I think it's one area left now

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

you want you don't have to put in all

points

but the more points there is in the

prediction the funnier it is

[Music]

I wish I could put in some points but

all points are completely

in wait can I reach a Redbox over here

now let me try them

one points are in a completely free so

don't worry about spending them on a

prediction

banana

is there

that was a video

she just want to see what happens this

is possible that they see if it is

that's not funny

you should be hard yeah this is much

pretty much easier

[Music]

is that with the pain here

[Music]

right now I keep messing up

everything

oh we got got one person predicting

exciting exciting

there we go that's what I wanted to do

Scout

that wasn't too hard was it

easy easy

I would I would expect the active

minions one but

I do not

unless you can't put all the same

time trying to do it yeah I want to see

it was completely messed up

so I guess I'll just have to change the

thing they all would go anyway

[Music]

so

that's something

don't forget what prediction

it's about next next bus

will be exciting

there are no insurance

I'll do that

and they have one I'm doing the next

boss who needs next course animation now

is

one

the time we still have oh I won't see if

I can remember anybody

[Music]

trying to trick me now

we're so far behind

yeah almost been there I think it was

slowing down for me

it was like it wants my into chasing

no wait that's the whole point you think

this is some kind of game

like

[Music]

most of the dragonhead king details I

guess it's either about Pinkie piece

red yellow green

purple

television this time hd's sunglasses

wait how is glasses are girls scene I

mean both are girls scene

[Music]

and how's the glasses I guess one more

thing

they are so adorable

[Music]

yes like Papa wolf right now

Miss

should we decide

but it is

I didn't say they were just that she had

gone around so

anything

[Music]

again

[Music]

another loss of life

back to 10.

but how do these baby dragons have

things like bows right after hatching

for me well they are magical dragon

Maybe

well I recommend you go really loudly

this time it does not believe me premium

does not believe in me

I put up ice blocks this morning so bad

nice blacks okay

be within a single try thank you

everyone

thank you all for believing oh there is

this

it's over there how do I reach that

burnt

oh you shot the ice block eh must be

beginner's luck

yeah thank you for believing me as well

No One Believes I have skins

I have failed to show off my skills

before but but still like

I have no coins left now oh wait

did you put in everything oh it's a

cutscene

[Music]

yeah I got one person who I have cookies

specifically a rocket man is putting

87.4 points well everyone else has

really has to put in points now because

there's a lot of points points now to

win

let's just be the biggest the biggest I

think oh there we go that's the last one

because it's like 20 000 something

points I Believe in You You Believe in

preventing at least one watching

mistakes

yay

like yeah

but let's go and talk to money bags

bunnies

no extra nice

it's okay if I kill bunny it's okay

[Applause]

Dave

hello Dave

it's a safe messages

[Music]

okay

no one doesn't even want to put in like

one point towards okay probably should

at least putting one with me

please

[Applause]

I think

I'm gonna learn it up there if I made

the first rescue

first day exercise

all right Steve

do they still do it here when next

disappearance when there it is

tutorial

[Music]

hi Spyro hi Zoe you should just have to

say hi she didn't want to say anything

else

[Applause]

[Music]

you can of course use this against other

things like this one

or this one is obviously you don't want

to do a head brush you just want to do

that

name's not here man

I guess he's not

wait where's Jason

yeah I mean he deserves it

foreign

[Applause]

[Music]

anyway that's too exciting

not easy as a base model I can use

Trixie that sounds like a gas thing

let's go

so the exception for girls you're

wondering and not worrying about is if

they have glasses

[Music]

[Applause]

okay if you wear glasses you can't have

a bow that's why porn fun isn't wearing

glasses

[Music]

all right

because I decided

you know

[Music]

modesty

I guess that's a name

again

yeah this is annoying

that's probably not this annoyancing me

but

he has to hurry up again

yes they are

well I do have to go back to the first

one and do the spider now the new spark

level because I do want to do this box

levels

and get the benefits from those and

actually be able to use those benefits

so I'll go back and do it because that's

the oh no wait I should have

cancel cancel I should have rescued and

Sergeant First

actually it doesn't matter because with

the final

Sparks I should have the level of work

ability

I can use Spyro I found

you finally let's let's go

sportswear that's a good one

hello Sparks maybe before you take on

the nasty crawdads I should give you

some help no you don't need to give me

help any other experience

Okay so

okay so this is a decent mode

you can also move quickly by charging

like all right

then they can use the stick you can only

actually point in any different version

well

21.

there finally

now for the hard part

this is hard

actually I should fail on your travels

you'll notice and listen to the to the

annoyed

like this

you'll be able to deal with these guys

much faster if you use the power up

yeah it's a previous tutorial stuff

where she sounds good

looks like you're ready Sparks No not

many let me start it away

that I mean it's gone

oh no

I'm not going to do this without any

sparks without fire

I have done that but that's nothing

crazy

[Music]

that it is possible today

okay

[Music]

thank you

red key

okay let's see yeah

I'm dying here

[Music]

okay

thank you

let's Maybe

there you go I know one mistake

now they've been done oh

boy

cow

different from that from the second one

that wasn't what I wanted to use but

I guess it cannot do the job

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

all right

foreign

[Music]

doing here

Nora that should be a gun no bow okay

and no glasses or any type of accessory

I guess that proves my

Point Frozen

I mean most

level complete

most girl dragons in the game have a

better of some sort

YouTube

okay recommend you must have more coins

you can put thirds position now

nice work Sparks you've beaten the

Crawdad King and found the Lost egg yes

not only that but some of the Dragon

magic seems to have rubbed off on you

now you can pick up gems when they're

even further away from Spyro yeah that

would be a convenience

yeah I should have

yeah [ __ ] and rescued Sergeant bird so I

could also do that I don't know

but I didn't think about it

because I'm a bit silly

all right

[Music]

no coins again

the sorcerer has caught this naughty

bird letting off Rockets

but I'm willing to release him into your

custody provided you pay his outstanding

fines

okay

oh dear Spyro you really should pay us I

think he's pining for the fjords oh yeah

yeah he's got to die too

he's prepared to die just look at his

eyes

[Music]

he have seen things he wants to unsee

better thing you do today Spyro than you

have ever done and

first James Bird

Sergeant bird 9w68 a waiting order sir I

think you'll have to find your

commanding officer for that hey what are

those things these are the latest

military hardware

so why didn't you use them to escape

because because I have limited ammo and

I wanted to conserve it

all this

all right you could still have done that

from the case I thought dragons had all

been dead for a thousand years or

something well the rumors of our

Extinction were slightly exaggerated we

just wanted a little peace and quiet

well if it's peace and quieter

cheerio

he's got Rockets oh yeah yeah that's

true he got he got some zero kids that

is true

foreign

foreign

Banks

a nice person land then we can find it

must have seen [ __ ] what thanks

[Music]

the different character whoa

I wasn't prepared for the future

that caught me off guard even though I

did like the rocket

it was quite a big explosion

the best skateboard Mac

the world

yeah

let me get this week

I forgot I hit this egg inside the

Statue yeah you could have told me that

they're hilarious

that wasn't crunchy with you peanut

yeah I saw the audio in this game is

quite punchy

and that explosion sign is not the only

trunk shapes it's quite loud too really

woke me up

[Music]

let's do some skateboarding

and this will actually be a challenge if

I remember correctly in creating that it

seems to be quite busy but

in that time I am hungry too well I

didn't eat before I streaming it

let's see you Sean and

struggling economically but anyway

s uh I'm just going to explain me like

15 minutes

isn't this the wildest skateboard park

you've ever seen now I've seen my other

ones so like once we have wild plants

growing everywhere

let's do some let's do some tricks here

yes go up press the x button

I can do that I'm just going to crash

yeah we

now try doing a roll you can roll in

midair by holding

yeah let's try that let's try to roll

okay

roll

whoa

okay

okay out there now PTI nice

now let's see you pull a flip

flop flip ah a free gem thank you

my name is the front flip

wow you must be a natural I am natural I

mean I'm not artificial if you think so

hello

foreign

[Music]

now that was a 900.

let's see if you could have some real

points on the giant ski ramp do

I am very cocky I'm the cockiest cop

wait

no

no I'm not

I didn't say that moving on

you said something happens

yeah you're hearing things just that's

the thing you think you had right before

I did not say that thing

your border yeah I'm being chained by a

master border that's exactly what I'm

being trained by

you know since then

no not going to make that joke it's an

obvious joke but

moving on

[Music]

apparently this is held on to that egg

look it's a girl dragon

oh without a bow

yeah

one competition there's nothing spirited

going on here

absolutely not

[Music]

wait we need to respond down here

[Music]

I'm already fading

my sound is so red

now I'm I'm messing up

uh in messing up

wow

[Music]

what front flip

in a single oh in a single trick I got

more points than he has gone in total

oh and he's actually putting on a

challenge here

yeah you don't get as much air in this

game I stream reignited making you doing

like these tricks much harder

whoa whoa

no don't crash spiral you have one job

and that's not the person

if I remember correctly there's some

kind of trick you can do but I don't

remember how you do it don't be like

this

well it's definitely not like today I do

not remember how you do the tricks

all right

I'm still going to go down this ramp

okay

1400 points

and then we have this scene

was it pretty quick I wonder how many of

those it can be

for attention

[Music]

nope

but I mean anyway

can't believe it I can because finally

Alex I don't know if this is a boiler

again

but it looks exactly the same as the

previous dragon and so Simmons again

Ryan

Okay so

sweet

you had one job spider that's set

handling on fire because he's keeping

for nice and some yellow

okay let's see if I can get skill point

then

well too many

okay

how do I give up

when I can ID

fart stuff hunting yeah

like [ __ ] dude

like every respectful Dragon Within

one two three four five no

keep messing up come on

should be able to do this

come on now

one two three four five there we go

that's what I wanted

to try

one two three four five

whoa that was about anything

like it doesn't count as it's the same

tree

okay

okay I'm I want in that case

and I have to be more creative by doing

this

one two three four five oh no

the only thing I wanted to do is

probably tricky

foreign

I should be able to get the course

record now

one two three four whoa there we have

let's get fine I need

oh I won't shut up

no

anyway

5151 Point new cars record

how about that

and it's gonna keep changing it first

one you ever had one from being wearing

Sportsman while skating around

this is like the most appropriate time

and when when one point is painting

around she's putting me on her

Sports brines okay

wow

can I no we're not going to be able to

get back to you nope

not even close

that was nothing spin how was it turning

look at this pain seeing has been left I

guess it still counts because I'm okay

so I'm spinning

I feel like your underwear would be a

bit unfitting to the action that is

true but without your otherwise it's

really the proper attire for most

activities

foreign

so

I left a doggy scene

it's the same kind of dog thing

[Music]

previous game

this spiky back this bike top head

the post doesn't bounce around as much

hey

wait let's move on

see another dog

[Music]

shoot me

please

oh

you're doing this uh thing right here

wait for the other one to stop attacking

before you start attacking

before

okay yeah

I'm done

wait where did he go

[Music]

and I don't know

[Music]

I think so

the dog thing is that inspired Stone

else's phone doggy Stone the bone first

in the surf beds

okay

catch with my pet wolf Farley

accidentally threw his ball down this

hole and he went in after it now he's

stuck down there I feel so helpless

sitting up here listening to his

steadily softening whimpers

don't cry wolf Never Cry Wolf

[Music]

he said that

no I don't we'll just hear it again

don't cry anymore this dog does nuts

this move does not cry

he's a happy one

happy to play with his phone

happy to have

apparently and me

hey

[Music]

the way it flies away when you get shot

[Music]

jammies

[Music]

lot of trash is here extra knives and

everything

yeah

licking themselves in an appropriate

places yeah if I you find a dog licking

yourself while being located in some

inappropriate place it's like a

graveyard or something

foreign

yeah yeah

all right

I want to be talking about dogs what

were you talking about

cats

rabbits

penguins

[Music]

the aiming rock is a terrible

and here is his own sign

apparently step inside I'll jump

Sergeant James Bird

makes sense that you can use his own

sign

what do you think we're talking about

yeah

um

yeah because I was like eating a

specific spiral I was eating the ball of

the doggy

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

after all it was fine if he keeps

putting the dogs balls in his mouth

that's just what's happening

[Music]

I don't had one ball refine

[Music]

okay two more bones and I know why one

of them means

I still wanted one

what is it this time right okay

where's the other one

what is this one girl what's the name

one here

oh there's one here

at first straight through it

[Music]

so I just was in here there is no it

bone or a king day I won't say about

boy

now

[Music]

let's go switch back to spire

yeah yeah but no I am off

now

let's have spider pick up the last bone

[Music]

you like this donkey

[Music]

especially when

one point is making me into in this

that's it Stefan

[Music]

new prince and princess pump on making

in Endless

oh scandal

pick up this one when I'm here

they can be fun here that's good

I don't want to be funny I don't want to

be entertaining

[Music]

especially when I call myself cocky

and nothing else

[Music]

oh

and master border as well that's a good

one

[Music]

nope from the gym sorry left

[Music]

what's seven or maybe yeah then maybe

they are at the

let's pick this up maybe I can have this

I was going to keep it as a souvenir but

I don't have room in my luggage

luggage around

you've seen me in the survey we're

supposed to be funny oh

dance but they for for you what do you

say Okay bunny fun is very innocent

I'm not too sure what you're talking

about

it

[Music]

okay

beautiful dance wasn't it

[Music]

I wouldn't be here if you weren't

entertaining so you don't have to worry

about that

I mean I thought you were here because

he was supporting me not because I was

entertaining

well I guess you're not here to

supporting them just kidding

yeah

no one might ask which head I mean um

well

[Music]

yes that's a good question

that's a good question look at this this

is perfectly innocent outfit for fun fun

nothing wrong with this other one

she's so cute wearing this

anyway back to the game I said no I said

back to the game back to King

I had to do both oh and fair enough

people find that to be very cute

that said it was cute too it's kitten

funny

surely you must be able to stand on that

[Music]

definitely and I will find the last

remaining gems using it because that's

easy to navigate you know

now

I'll keep finding the bunny actually

yeah it's just like innocent

sorry

can you stop doing that that's very

inappropriate I mean because the topics

has been going on here I guess it's very

up yeah

it's based off of IRL references

please

but in innocent I am a references

[Music]

I mean yeah yeah I always say that it's

such a well-known costume that an

association with its customers cannot

I mean obviously this association with

costumes down but

someone know that the implication or if

the if anything are lost at this point

I actually don't know what the outfits

fully implying and which of course is a

bad thing you know that's why I

shouldn't have made mate but

I wonder what happens if you put bird in

a whirlwind

okay

headphones princess

but one could say that skeleton was

playing oh there we go

he's a boner

oh maybe you should go and talk to the

master border Hunter

so I found one that means that there's a

fine in somewhere

this person

why don't scan this area first

no no no no

[Music]

okay

I don't like the

tea here

and it continues to move in a certain

direction it's way too strong

if that wasn't that strong it would be

trying to find

yeah I don't see

I don't see it up here anywhere so

[Music]

when they were trying to see a shimmer

I guess I have to check the skating area

or something

[Music]

it's not here

unless it was that enemy that died

it is possible that it is that enemy

so let me

Can I exit as

Sergeant burn

you can leave him to himself yeah okay

he he he's a skeleton he is already dead

he doesn't have much else to keep

that all the what I did oh okay

living alone or

doing

the thing like that one from face

skeleton you know the one yes oh yeah he

actually do well kind of erupting while

I might as well enjoyed I have to leave

yeah I mean that's fine

is perfectly fine

and it's nothing strange at all I think

it was like this enemy here

this enemy or something

[Music]

maybe I should pick up one of these

oh I shot it

can I

oh

seven right

stop doing that that's cheating

[Music]

come on

come on stand stick finally

can I get something no

I think it's my view

thanks

nope I guess I got to Camden

in that sense the gym is someone else

keep running area or something

only one of these times

apparent enough

I guess he just died and came with the

champ anyway

[Music]

it's not the only thing that is

oh my

that's um

that's a naughty joke he needs

God's enemies spinning out fire not on

loogies

but I mean maybe not as gross as your

conversation

[Music]

um

naughty ones

okay

if someone has a well they had a farm in

his mouth

now

here we go five

foreign

[Music]

all right

[Music]

they're using the same buttons as for

they have like a sun mark on them or

something

[Music]

[Music]

finally

foreign

hey

I didn't do that again for some reason

is soon finally down the whole line in

such an irresponsible name here

[Music]

there's definitely no purple gem in here

yeah I felt like I should have seen by

now

so

and I think there's more of these suits

in this game what are you barking at

[Music]

I didn't do that I'm running away

but it's raining again too yeah he stole

the egg for me unhatched it

and then rehashed it

[Music]

bottom heads

[Music]

you didn't see that happening you didn't

hear anything happening why are you

crying

[Music]

never travels you're hurting

and they was cried for once

okay it must be yeah

because what else would it be I've tried

to look donkey got hurt

yeah the doggy was

sparking

they had to make the dog stop fighting

did I miss a balloon or something

I mean this is possibility

yeah that's the banana missing

I found the five I'm missing and then I

break it in the next two or something

that means there's only two more damage

another time

but it's fine

yeah I want to

finally

spiders

and I'm thinking Skipper with me

James gemstone I got it

maybe something else

bye see the collection

so that is three levels done

we got a Spooky Swamp

and a Panda Garden

and this book is from Pastor Sheila

level

no I know I know what a leather is

I'm very experienced with ladders

I've used them in real life on this this

watch my timer is over like

15 minutes ago

Shayla yes Shayla

Sheila means girl in Australian

we're streaming

[Music]

yeah spider is immune to fire why is

everyone naked

I'm playing very nice very profess you

put clothes on every enemies

[Music]

definitely jumped for being hit

[Music]

yes

people Chinese keep an eye out for them

right

yep

[Music]

good thing I agreed with me with a

comment you wrote before I said I think

that's why it's It's a Spooky swampy

spot everyone's naked spooky

oh no yeah I don't have any good

compound regime and I would probably not

have one

let's see

[Music]

it would be really expensive

[Music]

behind yes I can

but of course

[Music]

doesn't let me into it yes

there is a scene in the way

I mean the key

all right why didn't you pick that up

all right let's shot

don't worry

this is a character boy

Michael

[Music]

boy with very big team

thank you

I mean you kind of see that that when

I've been modeling something

you know

so

doesn't have anything secrets

all right

[Music]

because everyone wouldn't really do that

well oh those piranhas were quick

and very quick

only the power of gems can hope to move

it

when no I don't

need to pay yet as I've driven before

and I'll prove it again

no need to pay money Banks anything

[Music]

you just go across here

[Music]

it's always in a very quickly as much as

it is

fine

no it's fine

join me no no damage run sure that it

doesn't work on anything

[Music]

I guess it makes anything

[Music]

when all lamps are lit there is a secret

in here

show you

oh that sounds exciting

skill point I will I will make all lamps

early but they aren't like yeah they're

really

now now they only

this one is

four lamps are nothing nothing

I missed that one when

[Music]

for me

last bananas

wait these are the five guys from

seasonal flame Frank

yeah maybe they are

not the one you're collecting against

those are different kinds

little one is open

what secret lies behind

who knows

[Music]

all right

no no

no no no no no

he didn't get eaten he drowned

when they did that for spring around

are you stupid

if I killed this son

hey you are brave Dragon thank you I am

brain

[Music]

come on yes now let's see if I can find

that

key

[Music]

Stone spider

but that's exactly what they wanted

oh what's swimming what is fine

[Music]

but I guess if they keep on fighting you

it's kind of hard to swim

come on this is getting insane

something to see me

[Music]

yeah I meant it without taking damage oh

no

[Music]

and also there's a bit of a waterfall

here which makes no sense at all because

there is nothing to put there's no

reason for the walking to behind on one

side

[Music]

come on

no I'm just being silly

father isn't even recording yeah it's

just still there's a water stealing

I don't know it's like it's it's what I

pointed out in the in the previous game

I don't know how the machines in the

water which they are in real life just

not that

way they were made in that game not so

such local and small hills or like short

angles this game is even worse it's a

sharp edge to the water when you find an

edge on the point

[Music]

around

when it when you when you're out

swimming with cut on the water

let's deal with the meaning was first

but I mean it was a tree

yeah

those are the mostly

things ever

selling breakfast

that was a mess

should start from this distance

you can't just do it as I mean

you actually have to turn oh no

it's nice well it's quite uncommon

pretty quickly

[Music]

and I remember most did you you guys

here you don't bounce back when you hit

them

hit the bomb I think you do oh yeah

YouTube

thing and last time

the living dragon

when it's not as in spider Adventure

where you have water rises

install waterfalls oh there was a lot of

rice that I don't know

it's Sheila time

this challenge though this swamp smells

so sweet if you say so Sheila

it's a swamp

I don't think this month

but I'm not going to judge yay Sheila

with her spot in the back

okay in this game

[Music]

we've been destroy these

it should come back

from 1989 an inside edition come back

yes as far as find a hard at least

but who knows maybe not just people

being wrong

[Music]

because that's one of the differences

people say that makes these channels

easier United

[Music]

yeah I need to come back

here

that doesn't make it to be Tony

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

and green

[Music]

I never even started by three

ingredients

and then there is also this one

Maybe

you had to stop two times on but they

don't use it they don't work that fast

they're not so excited to show what

point of that one is is the only one

that is two levels tall

whatever reason

let's go with you first Here We Must

Destroy the egg cage but we just go boom

kangaroo can help you can clear the path

for us will Sheila help us

I mean I mean Sheila can bring the bombs

yes yes it's bombing time okay let's see

which parts do you think

which which one do I have

to focus on

this Road Miami

and this rock

and this mushroom

can't control the camera which is

annoying was it this fashion

yep

of course

and I don't remember which mushroom it

was

that no it's this one

yeah there is this rock

and then yeah and then he wants back hey

it raised that up as soon as he was

going crazy okay

sure

[Music]

it's

yes I can like

probably just stick the camera is I can

see where he is

well

[Music]

yeah perfect

and then I don't we start this one I

think it was this one yep

and then obviously that one and this one

and that should be

one failed attempts and then 60.

oh is that or is it gonna use it

heavy yeah they're blind I guess look

it's a girl because it's about oh no

he's hot

one egg cage remains will you now help

my brother

if you clear my path I can blow up the

egg

you can play with music again

[Music]

[Music]

see that was standing next to it

okay one more training

this one

foreign

[Music]

peace

peace

and then it does take a lap around here

I think it's fine

until it reaches this one

and then I just need to

I would say

okay that was actually pretty simple

I am Michelle Michelle look it's a girl

again because there's a boat

eggs are all free yes two dragons are

born today

she loves my hero

Sheena sure is your hero

how much you're missing now

oh 16 16 gems from where

let out basically yeah

[Music]

I did bring the key

yay

not I'm not sure

we can't touch him

yeah oh there's one

[Music]

14 morning

well I guess it's outside here

I guess I'll start over from the

beginning

and also yeah I'm not jumping to the bus

I guess I'm at three hour mark now

when it's just one level and then

there's the boss anyway

[Music]

I might not have stuff I need to do so

TV fan

[Music]

and I don't know how long it would take

me to find these gems

now

[Music]

that sounds like a plan yeah that means

you get to one of your points back

[Music]

I hope that does

that's fine with you on

[Music]

[Music]

stupid things

no

I got on the price here

it's not like

there are some writing outside of the

door unless they are in the door

which could be a possibility I guess

and now I'm gonna just bring something

out into the way back

there's a that there's a path inside the

door which is down inside

oh let's see

what do I have to lose

exceptions

oh yeah you told me

nope

[Music]

nothing

um

search

it wasn't any gems in this area

nope

oh

this prize in this water too

[Music]

there we go that means that now

I think it's about four left yep

[Music]

they also move this exit button

another change

because it didn't have to do but it did

anyway

thank you

[Music]

now I don't even know what it is

this danger to being there

[Music]

obviously somewhere I'm not looking

somewhere I'm not looking where they are

hiding

[Music]

I keep thinking that's karate Direction

yep

afternoon

[Music]

no idea

[Music]

foreign

ability

at this point

they might just be in here finally on my

audio I mean it's four missing so it

can't be one yeah

it must be at least two gems

two sea of Fortunes

[Music]

[Music]

what are you doing

here why this one doesn't open up on

your completed both things

and why isn't it because

[Music]

it's not like I never really have to get

streamed

foreign

game

yeah maybe she knows the clumsy one

missing gems wait what's this one closed

I think it's weird the other one was

open

Ryan I did clean this out obviously

it was weird

I thought I found an area and I found

this one but no

nope the game is just weird

[Music]

yeah at this point that might need the

Xbox jump when you get oh wait there it

is

we missed the gym signing in here

oh James have been found

5000

Devil complete

celebration

[Music]

cell embrace yourself for celebration

oh that was so many red teams

but that was partly 500 gems of value

another background I used for the game

over screen inspiring one anyway

I am

five minutes every time perfect that's a

very good time to quit said game

even though it's just save the game but

we have someone here who wants me to

save the game manually honestly

are you happy now

all right excuse me

celebration who do we go and celebrate

to we got we're in BBC from wine you

know what out of the lab

or is streaming and I haven't read it

anymore I haven't right

right

and she has what you treat her

me

what I tried to do when she did it no

wait no I did it like this video after

you heard it

and let's see

because I

think mushy

I wasn't that long ago

or did I forget the right yeah I spoke

that I forgot to write it down like it

was on the 13th 2015 reading

in that case I forgot to write it down

or somewhere

because I like to see when I lost

training someone

so

if yeah I mean

write it

particulated after me she it's possible

to remind me if she did on the 13th

which is at least it has I forgot to

write down

and she's playing comfortable there when

it's a cute game she normally plays

um that by the Light

and I can say that I pretty much the

exciting game but she's playing cultive

lime and that's quite much more fun

foreign so I think that's that's worse

that's very worse visiting and she's so

cute and pink and I can't

and cats are cute

especially uh and she needs more people

active in the chat

actually how many years does it say [ __ ]

then she's dying on me at the moment but

that's what's

I said 11 watches you still got a few

breaths what six more refund coins yeah

I can do that he's going to

automatically

and refunded uh anyway after to 24 24

hours after they started or the timer

and I don't know which it is it's not

big of a difference there

but I really should have a long timer

because you should you be able to do a

long time

you're so nice

well okay keep forgetting uh

yeah I got the links and like that

nothing more special about that

there we go now

I guess we'll go and visit the music

in a few seconds
