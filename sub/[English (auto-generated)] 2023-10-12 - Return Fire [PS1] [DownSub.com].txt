R
stamp someone
start
any no I didn't Cho
that why didn't it go
back
anyway W we're mad that's next level we
got getting first if the first first in
a road so far I
think because I think wasn't first last
stream I can double check yep it's
true starting over for one and I got the
star I got 277 followers today got one
yester yesterday so we will see how many
followers I oh s starting up
good there's a lot of work this level I
will stick to
land so back to this game I don't know
how many streams I've been doing this
game for but this is just another
one so now this music so awkward acqu
the
many okay this level doesn't seem to be
too
hard no I'm always late on Tuesdays oh
oh we like wet
oh is that what you
like where's
the there a
control Oh no I got
shot no I got shot twice the audio
volume was a bit loud on
the I'm missing
everything okay you know
what I'll move back
[Music]
home well
then how rude of you
guys
no sorry sorry I don't I will
not okay now no that wasn't
great we like wet bun but Pon pun isn't
wet yes because you should wearing a
swimsuit you know
yes just to clarify but there is an idea
but it would be annoying to
implement that you have like a redeem to
pour water onto pon pon or
something to make her
wet I assume you would like that but as
it would be a bit annoying to
implement yeah hope oh is
understandable okay we just do some
carpet bombing on this one I'll bomb
some carpets with
carpets no I made a
mistake but the wet fur isn't soft or
fluffy and definitely not fun to
pet you might be correct about
that okay I don't care about that loss
cuz I destroy the flag
building and this level shouldn't be as
tedious because all locations with the
flag should be easy to get I'll just
start by removing the locations that are
far away maybe you maybe
want maybe want to
[Music]
redeem that makes pon pon w
it should be down here I think
yeah what where oh there it
is I okay I'll get
that no I didn't get
that hydrate
I mean I could maybe make the wetness be
like um texture
change in that case I could apply it
like to
anything actually gets splashed with
water
yes maybe not like hydrate but an actual
redeem that is meant to make p Pon
w
which will H have the bow be like
hanging down being on way too much
work and I'm an easy no I don't want to
be too ambitious with the
model oh too far away from the
world
oops I didn't mean to shoot
that to
far too far far
out oh I got
one Mo like okay the helicopter is dead
that's not Lester is ignored now oh no
the helicopter's back a surprise there
we go
finally I know you're destroying your
own
base that's my
job oh destroy it no I missed it next to
it
like get Splash with
water that is H so I was thinking
because
um that is actually a redeem that Miss
kit cor has what you can just pour
water and then she has one that makes
her dry again but
then I don't know if there's an actual
visual
difference if that's
just all right this isn't the helicopter
I need to shoot them three times I try
to measure the how how much damage each
vehicle
makes and it has been very tricky
because damage vehicle does changes
depending on what they are shoot
shooting and I can go to I can go to
everything equation done so doing the
equation isy pretty simple like I Define
the tower Health as 100 just for the
sake of Simplicity you need to shoot the
uh with a tank there's three types of
bullets the missiles from this heavy
vehicle the missiles from the helicopter
and then the
rest only only these missiles the
helicopter missile and the heavy armored
vehicle missiles that have different
damage
so five tank bullets requires to destroy
a tower that means that a tank bullet
does 20 up to but not including 25
damage
but but yeah let's ignore that and just
focus on that it does from a fifth
damage up to a force of
damage so and uh when uh using the
helicopter it only need to shoot a tower
twice that means
that the damage output of a helicopter
is 2 and a half times stronger than a
tank H up to but
not whoa whoa
whoo uh from Two and a half times
stronger a tank up to uh but not
including five times stronger than a
think and and that makes sense so far if
everyone knows
mathematics
like if the tank does one fifth damage
every
time if the then the helicopter does two
and a half
fifth R only requires two up two but not
including five because five out of five
is of course Max damage that's Destro
ATT I hope that makes
sense and then uh so
yeah just it can't be it can't be five
times
stronger but it can of be weaker and two
and a half times
stronger so but then I tested shooting
uh at uh the armored vehicle because
that has the most health
and using the tank bullets you can shoot
it 52
times that's a lot it survives a
lot but using the helicopter I don't
remember what the number is but whatever
the number is it's you take 52 divide by
6 and2 that means that the helicopter is
6 and 1/2 times stronger than the tank
is when shooting this heavy
vehicle that doesn't make any
sense because the helicopter is not
supposed to be if you when shoot in the
towers the helicopter is not that strong
because if it's six and a half times
stronger than a tank it would just one
shot shoot the Destro Towers in one
shot
so it has been a struggle trying to
figure out what the actual damage is
with the vehicle
sry so you could argue
that the
uh I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing
here I'm just running around destroying
everything
the
uh Hey excuse
me and yeah the flying root thing also
has uh the same damage output as the
tank with one exception it cannot one
shot the Jeep it must shoot it deep
twice I like to tank and every everyone
see so sure that that must be uh that
might be one of the rules for the towers
that you cannot destroy a tower with one
shot but regardless of how strong the so
the helicopter might be 6 out times
stronger than the tank and therefore it
could in Ser one shot the uh Towers but
but the rule says that the tower must
survive with at least one hit point left
if it was full health and that could be
a
rule but when testing when shooting the
a tank now I don't remember the any of
the numbers between using a tank and a
helicopter
however H the helicopter is not six
times
stronger in this case six and half times
strong keep forgetting checking the map
where I'm
going so the damage output of the
helicopter compared to the tank changes
depending on what you're
shooting should what armor this thing
has
the more it affects the uh oops okay I
should check the map where I'm supposed
to go
the uh the more are okay can I on the
correct
P the more armor it
has the more it protects against the
tank but it does not protect as much
against the
helicopter meaning that the helicopter
gets relatively stronger and stronger
which of course does not it's actually
the other way around the tank gets
relatively weaker and
weaker do the
helicopter become some type of type
efficiency
go so much stuff here no I'm getting
shot from
everywhere no I really don't like the
way the are
constructed
when time to move home
then don't like those mines I
they let's just clear up here so I can
just pass through without
issue okay
bunny went sugar yeah there you
go destroy this
thing and then I can move through here
well don't shoot
me I am a peaceful
tank
so that's the history of my research of
of these
games if there's anybody D want no I I
don't know if I have any
details I have for example not measured
if the
fuel what I know the fuel is only
consumed when you move not when you
stand still I could be wrong about that
but I think that's
case but then the question is is the
fuel depleted based on distance or
time while you're moving that is cuz you
can basically only move full
speed I going do more of this
stuff I'm going I get through here
easily there we
go okay now I'm going to B basically
destroying
everything
okay I know they're shooting at
me
okay let get through here so I can
destroy that
thing
and then lastly this
thing there we go now I can move on to
the island with the flag thing which
might not even contain the flag but
recently in this late level seems like
the next to last one has the
flag whatever you call that
pronouncement we said p
you said PE PE
no B PE the
PE I am running out of
bullets there's a tower out here in the
water I don't
like okay not you
but okay I only got one bullet
left
it's somewhere on that island there not
exactly sure how I should R
it but it does not cause any
[Music]
issues
I'm moving
out don't mind
[Music]
me okay I do want
to there we
go see if I can like
remove some of the more annoying
mines but said f might not even be there
so but I have a feeling that it is is a
peaceful tank yep moving mines so no one
accidentally gets exploded by
them if there was a way to disarm the
Min with without exploding
them I'm very GL
there I think throughout my play through
I've only had a situation where single
piece of bridge has been
destroyed and was on the SOS
map
there we
go we just passing through don't mind
me no wait oh I can destroy this
wall instead of going
around and hopefully the flag is here
because I've destroyed so
much I'm stuck
nope I
one then it is in the last location
it didn't shoot me what I was correcting
myself okay in that case I guess I'll
just have to move
up I am running out the
you is he
ah too many
mines
no it's Sho
me no lying
ring there we
go now we have Tower
here
go
finally but they way too many
mines okay I need to remove that
building in a peaceful
manner people in that building was not
killed and that wasn't the building so
it's
okay
okay I probably need to move home
anyway yeah was that wasn't the building
either so it's
okay just clearing a paths for the
Jeep so it can speed through
oh no mes evil non peaceful
mines just a tent in which tomatoes and
a red paint are
stored interesting that that they stored
both those things in
it so the the building is to the left
there which I missed with my helicopter
which would be so commun if I could hit
it oh well
all right wait is this this
moment I should use tank the other
tank the less tanky
tank I used the tanky tank first now let
tanky tank by storing them together they
increase storage
efficiency I mean this B the paint
except could be stored by all the
Mar which
then yeah whatever
whatever no I need this
joint
whoops well
worked
I didn't mean to tank it but
sure just shoot
it when I
escape yes shoot
it you
fools
yes shoot it
something
oh no my
shield my precious
shield no my
bullets I need to get
home
well the area is almost cleared out
so
so
so many
mines oh the towers the tower I didn't
destroy is still
here how does that
work I destroy
Tower oh thank you
for for
me
so many
mins one more than
to
it's fine it's fine I have plenty of
vehicles in
there and then I destroy the flag
building there's no flag oh
no that would be kind of
tragic we get rid of stuff here
cleaning up the mess
AIT here we
go only many Towers left
apparently
so there you go
peaceful I just need to destroy this so
I can find a
flag
and then make sure the pass to the flag
is
safe I mean this might shouldn't be an
issue but just in
case the will St but that was not my
fault they parked a mine there they
cently place a mine outside the hospital
and say like
well on how close am
I like oh no you destroy the hospital
that's your
fault how dare you destroy the hospital
let's see if I can pick up the FL
now go go
deep a deep
it's up here right come here much safer
whoa whoa
whoa trust me I'm not drink cting who
water and
Whopper I got a
flank
all speed
[Music]
home that that's how was suppos go but I
down we I did
it the C up so much I can use Rush with
a vehicle he
me still maybe we get a final beat on
the one of the three Last
Words I'd be drunk if I wasn't almost
out of what say what no don't get drunk
you know what I think about
that op
OPC op e is that is is that how you
write PC uh but instead of p is all and
C is e or
S my attempt at the joke was terrible
please ignore
it I didn't I don't mean blacker drunk
yeah
but I'm still concerned about
you because I don't know about
you how
how something is like oh I just just
want to be just a little bit and I like
half the
ball okay I'm playing home
now okay
I need a better plan
here well actually maybe it isn't so
hard as I believe it should
be I do need use
bries
okay just have to ease the back pain and
wrist pain and shoulder pain knee pain
and whatever other pain I decid to show
up yeah
okay I know
that yeah and not of the towers please
don't shoot
me okay let's
see somewhere up here
yes I know it's
going I now I'm missing
it okay now with it
gone wh don't shoot
me now I can play back home
[Music]
hopefully so that's much better run than
a lot of my helicopter
[Music]
runs
[Music]
whoops
[Music]
[Music]
yeah I still haven't gotten to exercise
I've been speaking up for like months as
should
do oh
well such is life such is my
life oh here it is M right outside
it hey why didn't Tower get blown up at
it
mine
that ain't
Fair okay that wasn't the one I was
going for
but okay if I
go I have an
idea I hope they don't mind me like
wasting
[Music]
helicopters I'm using them key
[Music]
okay oh thank you that shooting down the
other
[Music]
Tower okay
[Music]
here go moving
on
got well he hello
butu
girl now I'm
playing return fire I don't need to
shoot
[Music]
this please don't mind
me I'm just a peaceful helicopter
scouting the
area I mean I'm not scouting therea I'm
passing
through
[Music]
yeah have the so does the chopper do
more damage to concrete buildings than
the tank but no it was the opposite way
didn't you listen to my whole
explanation
before or or do you mean
like uh
wait yes that's what you mean between
the putting a helicopter and tank
shooting a concrete tower building thing
yes the helicopter does more damage I
was just slay Heretics and could hly
partly fair enough fair enough yes two
shots from the helicopter five shots
from the
tank it's okay you don't have to listen
to
me
[Music]
yeah I had no
choice
so I do love to listen to you thank you
and then we got Link Link fun P this is
so Random I played this game when I was
a
kid me too
actually surom see me I've been playing
this game like every Thursday Friday
for uh a few few weeks now this quite a
long game to like
finish to complete every
level but yeah and I play like 3 to 4
hours because on some levels are just
too
long that's that's what I've been
doing now going too far for up all
boom
wow this is where like the four last
for what would you even say
that or forc the
last World of levels to
complete um then done with it and then
then there's only three levels left
three three worlds left many levels
though can be like three to seven levels
per world is quite
inconsistent those are L need to leave
in a few all but it's okay if you have
to do things I accept
it
okay yes this was uh available I'm
playing the PlayStation version as it
says in the title but it was also
available for PC and I played it demo on
the
PC okay I
need should have remove this with the
helicopter
but
no oops I should have I should have
repair it first before I need that oh
man l
why are you laughing at
me for a
failing go go p p liing towards the
she
CH is
that on my me I don't speak English
English isn't my native
language
sorry but it was funny
yeah you were like
oops oops I destroyed the whole
tank I guess it was
fun I'm not sure what they're trying to
shoot me while there's that Tower in the
way but when it's Tower it gets
destroyed and stop shooting they're like
oops but it was an oops moment I had to
say
oops oh no they're breaking down my
Shields
me get
through oh destroy the bush you can run
over
him oh this m shooting at me
oops couldn't really pass through it
pass by
it try to be
sneaky I'm sure he wasting
these was I'm running out of each
vehicle one at a
time
yeah that's me just
running trying vehicle and then
oops it got
destroyed
the second move
forward now there's another
one why have you built so many Towers
here it's almost like you want to stop
me from coming to or
something has the Rand I'm
feeling just passing through don't mind
me oh nice Garden you know what that
means oh there it
is found the
flag
almost like it's a defensive line now
what what do you
mean what are they
defending okay I'm out of bullets time
to move home oh
no got two shots left and there there's
a flying thing coming at
me oops I don't have any shots left and
I have flying thing after
me
leave me
alone I
know oops that was the last
one I think you missed the word
there
so so then I just have to clear up a
path I mean I could just take a deep
break now and just go
through what does the fly do I forgot I
you need to pick it
up capture the
fly the defending P cute
re are you defending
[Music]
myar really singing along with the music
kind of
offit and then you bring it
[Music]
home
yeah see I didn't I didn't need destroy
more I destroyed just as much as I
needed
[Music]
oops a star for linky link the star
doesn't do anything by the
way you where
it they defending pwn C I'm not really
sure what they mean by that okay this is
same video every time we finish
okay it's been a bit different
month and then you have to wait for a
certain amount of time before you save
sure why guess I forgot the word usually
I me the same word in English so that's
why so you would say how do you speak
English if not speak English or
something like that s sounds a
bit right how do you speak English if
don't speak English or something like
that it still sounds weird in English to
me but well what do I
know wait what was the level
name all hello p k i see you okay this
just un
more thank you for being here so have a
good day I have a good day I think the
starting position the middle as far as I
can
tell
a bit annoying to get around with the
tank so basically should take the
corners start talk why you are here for
the
day yeah me too it's almost one
one but this was fun to watch thanks for
having thank you for being here linkink
linkink linkink no I'm restricted for
what my tools
are I have a good
day and maybe you show up tomorrow
team although I'm streaming quite late
for you
so
understand
understand Tuesday mon Monday monster
Monday and Tuesday
earlier it's time is very
slightly doesn't I need to
B that was that
hel
when
I guess I'll just go a lap around level
well yeah it's not really proper grammar
in English don't me but I often do PI up
to
[Music]
have oh is this still my base
cool well not sure go place that mine in
my
base
oh and
animazing but yeah you can still AIT it
in Swedish to it just needs
to sometimes this just sounds
weird depending
on this one is here without any
War don't think I need to destroy these
destroying
everything another
one
I
know
anyway clear it up a
bit I was I was going back to base
anyway
so probably sounds weird as weird in
English as it
doesn't Probably sounds as weird in
Swedish as does
English I wonder if there's like there's
certainly is situations where you can't
un with it in both languages as s
situations you can but I wonder like
similar similar situation grammar wise
but I do wonder if there's situations in
both
languages or you can wa in one but not
the other and in the other but not in
the punk tank
welcome oh I see glitching this level
look at this water yeah that's not how
you look lazy programmers making the
water wrong I'm not seen water being
wrong I've seen one piece of land being
wrong I'm going the wrong
way well welcome ptic nice to see you
here do you like my
bunny
I like that
emot yeah it's a funny
one okay let's see I should go
down why get
stuck who he's sniffing
Snips P P's face oh does my face smell
good to
you I don't need a tank my
tank don't get stuck CL
p
have to way here for spr that's a good
one home
home
yeah you belong under the
a
that was a waste of me collection I done
that yeah there got an
outfit so Punk do you like the
outfit it should been
some
I like it likes it I like it
too
so oh here it
this one defending towers are many of
them should leave this building
actually cuz it's so close
by
so I really should start with one Fest
way
cuz the it's a Quantum
flag its position can be altered by
which buildings you're
checking while you can't fully control
it you can uh affect it position
regardless
so Dam go cleaning out the way a
bit making ping through a bit
easier got me sent to waste anyway since
I'm moving back
home I yes live through eight as wow
wait why did you have so many
heads okay that explains why you were
quite
I mean you shouldn't have ads when you
join at that time because there
shouldn't be in a pre-roll ads when you
join a stream uh
well I'm happy that you lived through
those
ads but that means that you're going to
have
57 minutes of ad free watching which is
so yeah you have to suffer through 3
minutes of ads but after that no ads for
a really long time and I think that's a
good trade off isn't
it plus I can do like a single ad
message can I only have to bother about
ads once per
hour I'm not the one bed by it but I
mean I'm still bothered by
like I understand it's like a necessary
anyway so hello Punk nice to see you
punk D wants me to get the H card I
might I mean if you don't want one
you're free to get one and give it to
me I mean I don't need one I already got
a card
but it was a stupid was a terrible
joke wasn't even a
joke
so that's one flag
building so nice that the the green team
decided to color code their
whole
base there a bridge there you actually
don't need honest you want to move quick
course which is nice to
do here is next flag
building which is also pretty easy to
get through
so all
should also destroy it
last so we move
on but yeah pun I as I'm probably why he
didn't answer me H because you wor in
the
head about The Bunny model I have on
screen do you
like destroying
everything destroying everything
and
also any sporty
outfit party pon pon I'm always run out
everything even
mines can I get down by pressing this
button or this button this that button
where
there should be some but that but I
actually don't
know I guess it might be a shooting
button yes it
is a shooty
button
what a
and I even didn't even check the map
there nothing thing I said I was going
to
do oh
my
okay clean up
junk
oh I can stock up
with fuel and
munition
just getting of these stupid
Tower this is the next place for a
flag
I'm basically just moving around the
whole
island shame the fuel doesn't charge up
that
quickly
yeah I should probably move home
and repare the
[Music]
vehicle
why are they so
angry
probably that more than
enough that is more than
enough
wait I shouldn't goes through the
base base isn't safe I need to go around
it ground
it so since I cleared out this
area I could take left on the bridge
this
time which tech means that those places
are kind of as close
as the other ones
anyway but I could do some kind of
rushing destroy if I building rush out
and see
like let see I check the map and see
what decision I make
but
what strategy I
take let's see no wait there is no there
is no such
path
just have to continue
then there's one
there so I
could do something like
that
but I've been going like
clockwise and go like
anticlockwise
counterclockwise by going up
here
my is
tanking death destroyed
just came
here oh well since I'm not too far from
the base
I'll go home andair
and then to
a view of the area on
ground
I have a better idea
of yeah so yeah exactly so I get there
and
then I continue around like that I
should be able to see the flag building
attack the flag building and then like
work my way
work my way down and
around and the clockwise only focusing
on the FL
bings I so far destroyed one with the
helicopter in the
Northeast and then I will take out the
north northwest
West South West South Southeast finally
East that is my
strategy if you don't like that strategy
oh
what there
go
I do need to take the bridge
over for safety
reasons do want to get rid of
you that's purely my safety reasons for
my
safety going continue around
here
that is the one I
destroyed can I reach that Tower from
here
okay no don't shoot
me
no don't shoot
me
okay
okay yeah
WI
it kind of
works can I speed through here
yeah good
good
boom okay
so the strategy kind of
works I am making progress which is
smart counts I
think oh too far there we
go yeah yeah so I destroy that top
northeast corner so I just need to get
rid of those and then um very soon
access the flag
Ming
[Music]
Dam dramatic
music
[Music]
K okay on classical music still want to
do karaoke
again
just need
to get the
songs and have everyone select one song
and deide the date and time I should do
it
them oh yeah I tried to destroy that
building but I run out of munition okay
how much health you have there you go
no
one I
more
okay
yeah you get to select one
song our Koke session and it would be
one
am I already tank this damage
already they go it be easier to
travel
oh no the people leave the
building here's a t passing
through you're base don't mind
me a tank a
tank
and
tank and PS are mine and streets are
mine yeah I can't waste these vehicles I
have to
go is I have to like go around
everything this is one of the longer
levels yeah I'm basically at that one
and then I oh the next one's going be a
bit
[Music]
annoying prob not
toing
[Music]
don't fall off the
brid
and then quickly pass through
here if I shoot it every time I pass
through it eventually should
break
who whoa whoa I'm moving
out
go my
shield
go
I
know come Mo yes
straight than
okay one less Tower to care
about no oh that one missed that one
destroyed my
tank oh no there's one
there my little
[Music]
tanky now I just need to find some fuel
I think
oh I'm
moving yeah those was that comp
back
[Music]
how
feel
no no I know I
[Music]
know no mind
me that might have been enough to get
home I managed to get home wa okay so
base yeah so just started Toof Road
there so I just need to get across the
bridge oh and then I'm probably going to
be so
attacked can get so attacked after
[Music]
that
oh hold on there's something in your
ear it's dead Panda P here what what do
you mean that panda panda is
sleeping
oh he shot
me I he this war now wait this all been
[Music]
War
[Music]
go Ching everything except the this side
Target
that was tricking and I wanted it to
be one so there you
go
restocked
refu okay there's one Tower left
here oh missing
it and then is
this
I that went better than I
expected no let me
be
that's me
be when corn it's so hard to heat
them
okay oh thank you for cleaning up the
way but there's so many Towers
here okay this isn't
good sorry I have to run the other
way well I guess I'll just have to go
home again I think I still cleared out
quite a
lot I think that went pretty
one I still have to go around
bases go through
them
is them he more shots just in
case and not that can of shots
more we need for a few more
[Music]
bullets there we
go
oh no oh so no drinking shots it's okay
I have your
shots no drinking shots
[Music]
sorry not
sorry wao I got a bit too close to that
one guessing the tank didn't explode
that was very close to than go B and hit
points
[Music]
left but it's still holding together and
drives yes is
fine so yeah so I cleared up the upper
part there I can just shoots into that
Gap that I accidentally
created and and no no then I go down
there okay I see I see I see how I
should do this should be pretty simple
now and
[Music]
then
[Music]
d
[Music]
got another opportunity to ref I think
something with
there oops too
close
and the buttons are
here so let's see if I remember my
[Music]
plan
Bo so yeah so I go up
here okay I didn't create the hole it
was hole from the
start cuz it was a
gate there we
go
no come
on
we invited
you why are you shooting at
me
okay I didn't mean to shoot that but
whatever and then I just
flee full speed
away and then to the next
base
[Music]
it's
okay it's
okay cuz that's the last one I want to
destroy the tank I just need to go
around everything
again
I'll try to not let this tank get
destroyed first thing I do is run into
water success so far making
progress
[Music]
I not refuel but it's
okay it's
[Music]
okay
[Music]
wow I didn't need to shoot the second
time
got it in first shot oh attacking your
own
building I could probably sneak over
there but not taking
risks no I'm missing oh no my
shield okay destroy this building first
that's
priority
okay I said that was not going to let
this tank get destroyed so I'm not going
to let this tank get
destroyed
well I manage to keep the
tank and then I go back to
the now this building is empty let's get
rid of
it okay I survived
that
so then I we just
continue the have we and continue down
they you should any way I was
[Music]
go
and they fa to that's why oh yeah I need
to decide what like which dat I should
have the K on first before I can ask
which because people don't need to pick
a song even I'm actually going to be
there
but don't she have to on
there if we don't know what to pick you
don't
need
so maybe I can shoot that uh flag
building when I enter that area I should
pass through three pass three flag
bford and then when I get to that
area I might be able to shoot through
the
gate and hit the fly
building such destruction who made who
did
this
I'm going to be a safe set to take B
more often
gu I saying tank
I'm tanking the
car so this is the second flag
building then it should be the third
one
when it run so quickly into
the container that you bounce off
it I
know
go yeah so I started going up here
I'll continue oh hello
Tower yeah so the idea was to get rid of
this
one basically see if I can reach the fly
building yep I
did okay this one is causing me issues
actually let's not take any
risks I to get lot of damage from that
attack so better to go go home and rest
the
tank liing
popcorn that's is a ppon each
PopCorn by licking
them putting a tongue on the popcorn so
it sticks to the tongue and then
bringing the popcorn into the
mouth yes very happy with the
popcorn
just making more
distraction
[Music]
7
perfect so I got those two left those
two are going to be annoying to
reach oh the rest of my armor is out for
deliver including the B
get
kid very
good
okay and might been finish very soon
this
is driving
around and I really want to destroy
those two remaining
ones and I so I don't have to deal with
the flank being in
there let's see if I
can
the
he passing through don't mind
me thank you for not minding me oh w
w yeah I got
[Music]
play I was going to say I was going to
drown
there
but no I managed to
survive no not another one one of these
things can't see I'm very busy with
being
attacked no it's in
here well that was
awkward can this thing stop shooting
I'm try trying to clear up the area for
the say the area is pretty cleared up
now and say could get in there without
issue is
maybe yeah I did should be to get in
there that shouldn't be any
ises please stop shooting the peaceful
tag especially you like
cring well I did not expect the flight
to be in
there
it it show up quite
early I wonder if these building
contains a
blank oh right there are Towers there um
you know
me
think I need fuel
but probably not fuel the Jeep
anyway than a than if you love me Jeep
Okay Jeep a
Jeep anyway let's just me passing
through here please don't shoot me I do
not deserve
that I'm a very peaceful
Jeep
because who that was close because even
if I run out of fuel for on the Jeep the
flag is still going to be closer so next
Jeep should be able to bring it
[Music]
[Music]
home getting
[Music]
stuck
[Music]
face bo bo bo
Hello Panda nice to see you
here slept well in the
ears well I mean it
worked I didn't mean to do that kind
of I forgot where I was supposed to
[Music]
go
that ref of the Jeep wasn't actually
necessarily enough fuel to do that
travel
[Music]
well oh I guess the panda wasn't dead
after all now why would Panda be dead
panda is just the panda the at
[Music]
moment
and
[Music]
I'm selling me early I mean I can use
for St player too
maybe
oh there we go now it's playing
it 1 Hour 1 minute 34 second missiles
and
Mayhem there we go that's every 11 on
this world moving on can I find one that
takes like 1 hour to play what bacon
grease okay let's go with bacon
grease I'm starting all all the way
North okay let's start with clearing off
this island here
start
bacon
can I the towers destroy themselves as
SW is that going shoot Towers not feel
like shooting each other a bit more
there we
go okay start we going back home repair
refy stock yeah that's like more than
half the island destroyed by
that then way you said that was just
perfect I don't know that's
pretty you think I'm sitting bad yeah
sitting
bad
okay I it's to no why is the flying
roots in coming
already
for
[Music]
it says if your Tower is placed on the
deep water you can drive on it just safe
that is good to
know answer over welcome
to what's it called again something
bacon was not called
Megan who going to Dy more of this stuff
that's a feel
like I don't like you
three
I'm happy with
that okay this is going to be very
annoying the mine's intentional place
there
what
finally I'm running out of munition but
there's no way to fill
up oh
yeah two more munition
shots
one
and I
missed I
win shouldn't be too hard to use the
helicopter can I cleared off that's why
I wanted to clear this
off but really show them I destroyed
every single piece
of
stuff yeah shouldn't be too hard to use
a helicopter here
I
hope let to
see i' got to think of
them keep caring with me shooting them
oops I shot the
building no that wasn't close
enough okay here we
go
no flag so
[Music]
far how many B on are in a row three
three of them except on the edges so
maybe I'm able to
like
shooting one after
another without having to shoot down
the
towers well like this I can shoot them
once and then I can move back and shoot
them
again
running there you
[Music]
go
[Music]
there you
go one line of bacon
[Music]
complete now it's time for the next
blind
of it was
delicious have had bacon in a long time
actually have bun eating bacon
Bon
Mo
[Music]
on I didn't miss one building or one
shut it down
once
too far
south no no come on come
on can't think of it I haven't had b a
long time wait didn't you have bacon
like
yesterday H disappointed
fun
oh yes there was meat bones
okay that didn't go as
planned wait too
far still pork but not bacon
okay bacon
balls I guess pork bork pork bork pork
pork pork balls could mean something
else or maybe that's what why you call
it pork instead of pig because you don't
want to say pig
balls what with in the peak
balls
[Music]
that was that one
okay no
no no I hit
it
[Music]
there we
[Music]
go still no
flag and the flag could be
anywhere someday I'll find the flag
and I said bacon so many times that is g
lost it
meaning bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon
bacon bacon that could be anywhere or
it's
nowhere is now
here there's a lot of more places to
check so I'll just
[Music]
continue bacon bacon bacon
bacon
[Music]
I'm shooting misses on bacon
buildings buildings on top of
[Music]
bacon this formation of island is known
as bacon
Islands
I didn't mean to shoot
you but I got hit by missile that's
Chang the direction of the helicopter
resulting in shooting the
[Music]
tower
the flag could be just about anywhere
it's so hard now not hard it's so
annoying trying to find a Quantum flag
that which position changes depending
which order you destroy the
building that's it flag bacon now okay
I'm looking for I'm looking for
bacon where is my
beacon the flag is placed in a building
designated holding a flag okay that
makes sense these buildings are placed
out of bacon what now you lost
me okay let's
see say the
helicopter
[Music]
if it wasn't for a bon need to be cooked
although maybe I can cook it at the same
time like same length as the meat yeah
having bacon on buret could be something
I could
try but really the on how long the Bacon
needs to be cooked
for at the same time I'm fine I guess I
could do it
[Music]
something but I don't have any
experience cooking
[Music]
bacon or as some people said when it
appeared in seden B one cuz that's kind
of how it could be really
nice which doesn't really make sense
because the SE before or should be
hard I couldn't I can't understand
pronunciation
[Music]
but yeah I think this one is the one I
should go down next
yes
[Music]
strike need a beacon to locate the
beacon beacon
beacon yeah I can't find bacon on this
level there's so many bacon
buildings
but none of them contain what I'm
looking
for see
[Music]
nothing cooking bacon is easy you say so
actually easy than because it's S size
means it reaches to correct temperature
faster oh no that doesn't sound good
then my bacon will be cooked before the
burger and then the bacon will reach
critical
mass
boom I got it
that believe me stats doesn't oh no
that's no
good oh I missed that
too I did hit that one good good P you
hit
it
okay so now I just need
to those are next to each other those
are spread
out okay but this one I missed now I
actually hit it
okay but this one I completely missed I
[Music]
think yep now I ha
it okay there's only one place left
where where they can be back
on well after it's properly cooked the
only thing that happens is is it gets
crer longer it cook
and it will get to an
infinite crispier and crispier until it
get so crispy it's
just piece of metal you can also use a
lower heat if you want to cook burgers
at the same time I could cook burgers
and lowest heat currently
so the lowest heat that is
possible
[Music]
h
no
and bacon wasn't even in that building
anyway see the bacon the bacon is going
to be in the last building of this
destroy or Le
one no it's going to be in the last
building actually two buildings
left it's not going to be in the last
buing but just because I said that it's
going to be in this one okay it is in
the last B thing I've said all this
time there it
is why am I trying to shoot a bit is not
shooting
me okay how do
I oh
no
no
h
okay I need to clear way too deep to the
flame always the last
one yep R face and Pon P's face Oh
faceing I thought you were a panda not a
car
what sound does the panda
make
know living with natural light only so I
need
to destroy everything on the diamond so
I can get through with
tank with a che and don't move you
you're a phony bony you're justff
phy why is pan
phone that doesn't make sense to me I
thought Panda was a
panda
but it is real exop
Panda it's a real panda with an
exoskeleton okay there we
go
they try to throw hand grenades at the
helicopter okay I'm going to Mark the
way for the je just P the line of
Destruction that's how easy is just here
I'll probably find
it you know
just in
case anyway that should be
enough I do there make noises I
believe kind of gr since they're Bears
can't they make different
noises yeah bunny
say okay it's quick if I go over
here
well what down here
right
yeah they do I
think bunny
say go go go go you found the flag now
bring it
home to your
[Music]
family took many buildings to destroy
but I got the
[Music]
flank
[Music]
ur
ur
still okay the password to the penal
World flower bear heart I'm
PL wolf
Spain let's go I would love to play the
trumpet
par what what what is this this orang
sheld thing
called it's called a parly oh wolf
map oh my sure they are aggressive
here well I'm sorry I'm
sorry it is indeed a wolf
map
oh your pace is the
butt
yes
this the
literal place where you come out
of
and it is
brown yes that is exactly what they have
done what what in the butt yep it
is it is brown and circular on the map
even technically a square but
whatever there's also an elephant map
and I also think you came out like
out of the
P okay he's that me safe now
definitely safer so I need to move over
to over to the across the map to the
other
side I don't like how you try to shoot
me it's a it's a weird feeling I
have
Gates you're curious about
Gates oh a
w i w I can actually get through there
we go oh no
Forest my biggest weakness
weakness Tre
everywhere okay it's getting
destroyed time to move home
again
let cleaning up a bit up chunk
here see the
chunk so it's kind of cleared out there
I think the W have some infections
everywhere this part is fly
functional a bit mechanical but then
there's all all these green infections
everywhere on the
world some growing stuff on
here oh no an exploding
dis
okay where's point with the gate in the
middle of the basing you don't see a
function you can go around the
gates
no oh
nice time to move out of
here time to speed across here whoop y
did it no damage
taken butt Spas
whoop the joke of the
butt
I don't think removing the infections
with missiles is the way to go when you
want to heal our wolf
but but that's how we do it here okay
so there those location there I think
there's location on T as one but I could
be
wrong
but the question is is should which I
should go with first
because it's not really hard to hard to
go across here with the
Jeep but it is a bit annoying to clear
out the T Maybe not maybe it
isn't
there we go there is one of the
buildings yes shoot
it thank
you
why are you shooting
me what have I done to deserve
that I'm a peaceful tank don't you
remember okay I'm
leing so it's not in one of
those
you have try to shoot me before so I'm
going to destroy you whoops that more
here you TR to shoot me before
to making a bit
safer okay
so destroyed those two things that
contain the flag and it didn't contain
the
flag so there's one left on this now and
then there's on each paw it's on a
three-legged
wolf and then there's one on a
t let's see if I can infiltrate the eye
or this s snow
snout that hopefully not be too
tricky hope hopefully well shoot me
already move
up trying to shoot me from there
instead
okay
so I don't need to care about this
space so I can move right past
it I do have to care about this this
space
why are you shooting me I'm not even
attacking your
base yeah there's the
building does it container flank
hopefully not it does
not
so then I can move
home so then I only have to focus on the
P next next focus is the pause
pause this thing I
have I guess guess I only have paws on
my feet as my feet on my
legs my arms still have hands fully
functional
hands so they s the model of P Pon have
four or five
fingers cuz the drawing all has four
fingers and uh
the model replacing coca has four
fingers but you know I have four fingers
in real life if it even can't track
fingers because if it doesn't even track
fing doesn't really matter although it's
kind of annoying trying to get down
there but I'll do my
best if I try to use a helicopter it's
going to be destroyed
immediately don't even think I'm going
to to get close to
them I could clear off a bit and then if
I need to go back home I could from
theast
helicopter just peacefully going around
yes shoot it shoot your own
Towers no I'm dying the wrong way I know
have to tank
control
okay oh no not this
thing oh no it's destroyed no thank you
for your
help
oh
no okay so far so good I should probably
not take the helicopter yes
yet probably need one more round
basically not cleared out anything
yet although if I go all the way down
with this thing anyway I could just try
destroy the fls like
Bings
don't shoot
me
please why you trying to shoot me you
destroy your
friend
okay
so wh to get around the corner
there oh
no R seeing something
way
go those the grenades at
me
okay I think I destroyed one of
them so I should be able to like enter
with a helicopter and shoot the other
one without issue with less
issue with so
mey
with that lot of
isue okay what if I go for the Tail
inste cuz it really doesn't matter which
where the flag ends up being
anyway and at this point I rather not
have it spawn at the tail because I
cleared up so much other
stuff we
[Music]
go
[Music]
that's pretty
simple I count every flag building that
this is destroy let's see if I can
destroy the
other the the other pole on this three
leged Fox
I assume the two back hind legs as you
call them back PS back legs are like
layer on top of each
other okay it's
here
it's
here that that looks
crazy
I do have an
idea I do have an
idea
excuse me what are you shooting
at are you shooting at
me okay excuse me infantry don't really
care about
you
if' had an day to eat Caroline Reaper
cheese PL if I had
any
when and I wish I had some cookies to
eat
okay okay oh no
oops it's fine it was just the
first I only lost one of these and one
helicopter not doing that
bad
just cookies
cookies with some chocolate
on yeah I should remember like
things which they are causing me some
trouble
and then take a shortcut through
here you are annoying too that was
pretty easy to
destroy
damn Nice pronunciation thank you
peaceful tank makes it sound that wor
rewards
yep I think they should be enough to
clear the way through for the
team cuz all I then do then is
I take the Jeep down
here through
here through
here don't RK it running over
my there we
go through
here you never
know and then use across
here o wrong
way
sorry didn't mean to interfere with you
Towers okay I'm not doing so good at
moment okay one more
try
should be this
[Music]
hard going through here completely save
[Music]
here down here go across
here acoss
here ATT this one quickly get out of
[Music]
here
away doing some target
[Music]
practice
right next to
[Music]
you go go go okay I got of one one so I
mean I could probably sneak in with d
but like snag the flag flag
snag with before the tower man shoot
me and if they manage to shoot me I do
move the flag more towards West meaning
that it might be even easier for me to
snag it the second
time although I will not R the
30y
[Music]
probably could but why risk a Jeep when
you can make it perfectly safe cuz it's
a waste of
time come on it's easy I can do it
I'll show you I can do it I can at least
try with one Jeep I got three of them
I'll show you I can do
it I am p
p and if we
don't say that something it's not
possible I just want me to try it even
harder
well let's
go oh is it
here go
go
there
no I got
stuck that's not going to push good
thing they had such bad
aim have St encouragement see I got it
now I just need to get home but that's
not no problem I got here without any
issue so no problem getting
home yay
[Music]
you I should go here and drop it off in
that
[Music]
building to
Bo well see was no
problem no problem at
[Music]
all I meia again it's only like 10
minutes left 27 minutes so probably not
be able to do a whole 11
in in
just like 20
minutes
but next one is this one and that one
looks to be taking quite a while to
complete Treasure
Island let's take a close
look mive
celebration where are oh they're in the
middle wait how am I supposed to get
there you know what I'll take a
look I'll take a
look
can oh
no there a lot of
tows prob placing Tower so close each
other they shooting each
other but then do I need to like find
the PATH across the
water
yeah I complet this 11 one
minutes
is not disappointed I mean it's
disappointed it's not
amused by my
failure I'm
sorry
my flying R thing is
coming all right time to go
home there
go you all f for their favorite food but
no one knows what it
is it's a special kind of
carrot maybe maybe it's that only I can
feed FAL pom pon if anyone else tries
she doesn't trust you doesn't know what
kind of food you're give me
her
no no I can't get across here this is
the wrong
path okay this
is okay time to go
home oh
no what you
me
survive me like one
HP swim away peaceful
tank swim
away I should have analyzed the map
which PA am I supposed to
take
like this this one but this one doesn't
seem to lead anyway
nope I get here and that's
it
and you Tower just keep shooting me and
it's
annoying
is this the correct PA
then now this okay wait it might
be still again oh
fly okay so go there go
here getting stuck nope no I can't
continue to
here I'm not allowed on on that
island tanks are not allowed on this
island maybe I should go there with a
helicop
in
B ring a cute but
deadly
hello socks yeah I don't want
call that seems a B Rude yeah can
probably do this with
helicopter I don't think there are any
Towers on the island you just need to
clear away for the
Jeep hello again hello hello nice to see
you I am a very
very this bunny is able to maneuver many
types of
vehicles watch

in the
water
hello how about not being
stupid this time I should be less
stupid that they asking a lot for me

or helic Choppers if you want to like
it get it but
sure and let's just s the an has to
play uh come on
isn't it
PL
oh don't s
here yeah
know
need learn to control
the so I'm going to destroy
these too
far I'm out of
ammo but this
be weaker than tank
shots for for these building normally
for other type if you shoot a tank or
shoot a tower or something there's just
as
strong is I might be wrong
though the just as the ammunition ran
out let's go pick it up
let's go pick it
up so I guess I completely
listen less than one or more exactly one
minut cuz it
is 19 very
soon
indeed this is the most peaceful Jeep
you ever
seen it will go there pick up the flag
with with without any form of
Confrontation without without any form
of
offensive uh
actions it's okay
um I saw I had it but
no even though I had a very safe and
fast up
north let's take out a few more Towers
they have been asking for
it
all right there all way to
destroy one more time this time it
should be safer I removed three
towers and
some Tower remains
wh can you go
there I don't know if this is
quickly do
that
because because it's stand still when
you deflate
It Anyway let's pick up the flag without
doing
any aggressive
action throwing some
hanger oh
no
annoying
thing last
de take 50 minutes or something
then at least I does have to destroy the
building
don't no one more
Jeep yeah I lost another
Jeep another
Jeep let's pick it up and move on I
pretend like
[Music]
