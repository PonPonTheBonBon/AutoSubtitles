hello everyone

so

um

oh great

steam is messing with me again

I need

you know that

yeah

I started steam I went away

to prepare the stuff

and

steam hasn't even started

hello yo

I need to do that so

now

still starting up yesterday fastest

so

I think the issue I had with steam

before was that I didn't

close I never close them properly

it basically runs in the background

and then

therefore it never seems these settings

I guess

the biggest yeah now it has say the

settings

right

now it still hasn't say the settings

everything okay so every time I restart

Steam

it resets back to the previous settings

it's not the default settings it's just

one of my older save

D settings and I don't know why it's

doing that

if anyone knows why I could probably let

me know

she

but let's start the game now

and it's it's starting up so any moment

now

and we will continue Spyro

two

without the flame button

the game isn't there so quick and

starting hectic so it's starting up now

foreign

a bit earlier

okay good so the game started let me

bring it up on screen

and the controls are working correctly

so there we have it

right I think I hope it's all right

so

why did

boss did I complete our levels before

I quit last time

we'll see

good

and I hope the game audience at the good

level as well

oh yeah it's doing that exactly I did

complete other levels

so now I can find

so this is

I don't I don't get this

all right I tried to adjust

that uh

I need to write down a list of things I

need to correct

and if someone can help me with how can

I get steam to remember

these the layout I've set up

that will help a lot so I said

I can't charge but I cannot Flame

and some of these options I have to

attack the enemy

like this I can charge

that

but I cannot use all the options

this was can be quite tricky as well

so let's see what this should be another

Barrel hopefully now does it work

because I have to flamed it

right hey Stella

yeah so I cannot

get these bombs to ignite

and they don't explode on impact either

now I'm only going to get bumps right

yeah

so the second rule is that if I cannot

proceed

in the game

due to not having Flame

I am allowed to use Flame

although I say the game would be over

here and that wouldn't be any fun

but that's the only exception so far

you're doing great

I need some chicken

but I would also like something to

attack with

something that isn't upon

or Rockets okay so this is the rocket

phase I assume

I don't remember

yeah that's probably also going to be a

rocket yeah

so now I have to use Rockets

do they come in with more yeah here you

go what's this

more Rockets

and so this is this bus battle is over

we can go back to not using flame again

I like it was meant

how did that one means

okay

that rocket didn't exist

so is it a mix of everything now oh no

not Flame

please give me barrels I need balance

wait what did it all right there it is

I like it

oh there you go there's the prayer

please don't get rid of it I missed

but this is going to be a challenge

oh yeah

so I don't know if I'm going to have the

option for barrels

for all remaining hit points

all right that's too bad I didn't

ignited

yeah I'm probably not going to get

barrels

I need to stop messing up

and this is probably a chicken now

oh no

I knocked it the wrong way give me a

barrel

for a chicken

to Quicken that

yeah I wanted to knock it away

and I rolled in to it

give up our chicken

I can hold this

how how long was that actually

uh they are active for a while can you

drop something

no I didn't see what it was

so

oh yeah give him the eggs

foreign

I'm badly trained oh here here's the

final barrel and I'm dying

[Music]

and this isn't going

as great as I hoped it's a bit random

what the items arrives so doing it

without Flame

no fun fun

that one is a tricky to avoid as well

so you start with Barrel so let's see if

I can do this properly now

how long can I

okay now it's just cheating

oh

thanks for the follow a Potter again

so

um

and then it's already the Palms

and then exit

gets an hour I need to wait for next

deliver of eggs

and

these are Rockets

and I think there should be Rockets

two times

r or bomb

so I'm I'm learning

tricks

more bumps oh there's a barrel

and worked into this one

foreign

[Music]

again

so

something more if they didn't drop this

so slowly

now let's make it go a bit quicker

I was working one eh

no I destroyed it

I'm just going to delay this battle

saw a rocket

two rockets

no barrels

are you going to release any commentary

eggs

no you did

drop an egg

on the way over there

I didn't see it

they didn't give me the eggs can you

please give me the eggs

okay

this isn't apparel

I love you

these rocket indexes

so the final one give me a barrel

I didn't see my

simmer for final

now getting bombarded

please apparently so I can finish him up

properly that's not the pattern

[Music]

one final Barrel

they come in like they have eggs

this isn't a great start

um

I could have skipped the whole boss

battle because this isn't really what

this run was meant for

because I can't really do the bus belt

properly with only charge

okay he doubts himself that was good

foreign

I had only one hit left

and then I messed up

and currently I'm missing every shot

see if I do that then you can construct

they are the eggs

all right I thought I could do that

oh no he's eating the pumps

foreign

what's that

it's in this

not making it easy with it the way they

dropped the eggs

are apparently

it's exactly what I need if they always

had a barrel as an option

but would make this possible with only

charge but

alright indeed

you can do it yeah I hope I can do it

I

on the bed got stuck

I really hope it's only four left you in

my Barrel

oh look at her

three is left

see if I can do it without a mistake

keep shooting

so eggs

that's a rocket even without judge a

good techniques deleted

two rockets so I'm going to assume they

won't be an embarrassed look

I'm awake

oh no I messed that one up

because they're coming in with eggs

and that only one hit left

now let's see without

oh no it's charging

I started missing it now

and

I mean it's not a bird no don't eat it

[Music]

yeah at least you didn't regain Health

from it which I think is a possibility

okay give me another band okay so there

are barrels I have to wait for a barrel

there we go I did this

it's a bit of cheating using flame I was

forced too but

I did it

tick took longer than I wanted

you did it yay

so now I can move on on to the next

world

Escape Market scenes

I should drink something as well

so

yeah

so well I guess I'll continue to see it

how much of these levels are possible to

do with omnicharge

so this could be a tricky level

since there are several large enemies

that I will

that actually will change

so let's see how well it goes

so

and I'll already

can I reach you oh yeah that's good

Sonic

back to a normal level

it feels a bit strange but

so

20 enemies I should hopefully be able to

get 20 enemies

there's a lot of these small ones

but then there are those

are the different pink they want the one

with the elephant trunks

like that one those are large enemies

so I can take out these

and try to avoid that one

yeah that's another one

so

and yeah I should also see how many

and I I get to Chase

they're more of them they are everywhere

okay

um

oh yeah

yeah

I can take you out

nine

oh yeah I need those this one

so far so

foreign

[Applause]

this should be a vortex in one song

right here let me let me trample me I

might Sophie

yeah there it is

but

I would like another frog

oh

oh your Chase me quite far

I didn't expect it to run so far

now I am up here

to take a shouldn't be any elephants up

here I hope

they're quite strange elephants Pom-Pom

got squished

this evil elephants

shouldn't

I don't know if

there's this whole thing with elephants

being afraid of mice

uh but what about rabbits

and now this rabbit is dead

so I got to check it here

so I just need

to take out these again

like that

I'm not like that

oh yeah

okay

um

I can't move

I'm wearing these

that's 20.

that means that the power up should be

in it enabled active

so I can

Chase those things later on

but I can't swim in that so I need to go

down here and then there's

we should have

a

money bags first

forgot about that

that was the first thing I should have

done

no that wasn't

don't do that

puffer fish

and platypus

strange creatures

and then I should I go

I guess I'll finish up these levels

first and then

if there's more time I could go back to

oh yeah and then you get

no more telescence you get warps instead

which is I do need more orbs

I do need 40 orbs and I only got 14

that's a lot more orbs to get there's a

minute works that are locked out

like

I should be able to get a second arm on

this one

but that

would be a bit trickier without Flame

because he needs his spark plugs back

uh no I didn't start from here I wanted

oh there's

okay

okay that was

that wasn't too hard

but there is one that's very hard can I

reach that

only uh

charge not like that

maybe this one can help me

and I should be

there

I did it

so it should be three more

through

I think this is one of the trickier ones

around running around the whole area

oh yeah

so yeah not supposed to do that

get me up for me

or did it go oh there they are

waiting for me

okay I want to take you out to Houston

do anything

so I'm gonna try

[Music]

it doesn't feel like I'm getting quite

I assume you should be able to

just

catch up with them but chasing

I mean I'm not

getting pretty close

yeah that

the other two should be since as soon as

I get this one it should be

but that's how the truth should be

kicking

let me get you

I get what id

camera angle that one is so weird

let's really see what I think of

if I had

Flame or something I could just

same from that distance

I actually have to catch

ketchup

[Music]

no no

if they were just a little slower

well thank you for getting rid of that

didn't I

will you please leave me alone

I am trying to Catch a Thief

he's not

too easy to catch

can I do this

okay

oh that was too quick

too far ahead

okay

this isn't going great

and this elephant

where is it okay

and I can't go the other way

so we need to get up there

and I need to take one more lap

and this is going to take off

please

let me catch you

struggling

catchinist

that was so close as well

come on now get

please slow down

feels like I'm getting very close there

at the end and then

due to having to jump down and then jump

up again I lose all this progress I made

it again it's impossible to do

it feels like I'm at the same distance

here every time

doesn't feel like you're making any

progress

okay

hello Wolverine

yeah I don't think I'm going to catch up

with this one I think I need to ignore

it I can't spend the whole stream trying

to chase the same one

so

I'll probably have to ignore that

one it would work if I had

the flame

I think I had many moments where I could

flame that one

but I don't have any Flames this run

let me explain wait I don't need to take

out this anime so I don't get any gems

from that

it's actually just gather up a few more

gems and I didn't I guess I'll just

get squished okay you want to scooch me

once

aren't you said the same with that

okay three times

[Applause]

how do I it's too hard to get up from

the water

let's see

I wanted to go into

the cave over there

okay in that case I have to

go

the other way

after this so I need to get

your hand

even more

now

look at all these gems

I really need to play spider one day I

only played it one time on an old demo

CD for the PlayStation one but it's a

lot of fun I do think Aspire is a lot of

fun so if you have the opportunity you

should try it

and so I guess that's enough

um

but it's of course not for everyone

I've seen a lot of people

since I I tried

watching People's stream and

there are some people who struggle so

much they don't even find it fun

sometimes it's due to them ignoring all

the instructions and just

um don't understand how it's supposed to

play okay there is an issue

with

this game because it's not made for the

360 controller and so the dead zones are

wrong and steam is not

think remembering my dead zone settings

so I need to

now this is

how do I set the

calibration

so I want to

have to increase the touch sound

but that would require me to restart it

the game before I use this I assume

oh it seems to be better now okay I

guess I don't have to restart so uh

Aspire is fun just a bit hard

certain things can be hard here

so

wait ahead bash I can do this

okay I don't mind if games can be a bit

hard never still doing this

can I please stop doing this okay let me

just restart the game

Spyro

I

this is

Sue

I do have a Xbox One controller I just

don't have a cable that works with it

and I guess that that's for him and to

the previous fire stream I guess that's

the problem with the Xbox One controller

for some reason the wireless doesn't

work in it

now the wireless Works in it for some

reason the batteries doesn't work in it

that that's the thing bad resistance

doesn't work but I don't have a cable

that's so I cannot power it I can't do

share the wireless otherwise

it's a fun let's see

it is a fun game I like playing the

spider games I think the most important

thing is to get the controls and if you

have the controls and understand how you

can control Spyro I think that's the

biggest problem

people have playing

um that

sometimes it feels like Inspire isn't

doing what they want and want him to do

I mostly

foreign

people have yeah is that

energy

I can give a very quick demonstration as

soon as the game starts up yeah

let's move down here so for example if

you turn a camera and then you are still

doing this

I cannot

I didn't do this last time

tilting down

and it doesn't matter how how high I set

the dead zone it shouldn't do this

it kind of makes the game unplayable

and it is the controller because if I

plug it out it's

this controllers bro it's a third party

controller I don't have money from Bank

controller

no

and I was thinking that's it

nice it is even worse now

and steam refuses to incorporate with me

for me

and allow everything

yeah this is this is an instant Green

from Steam is the biggest problem I have

right now I just want to have some dead

sewn on the controller and so I can

it's

I I probably have to set this dead zone

really high

let's let you max out the control the

dead zone

and then I have to restart the game

again I assume but is it correct now

okay

okay so now it's doing it okay

I guess it's working now good good

nice still doing it

I need a new controller if I only had

money for that

uh or a new cable I guess that could

also work

that's that's probably cheaper

oh yeah you can't do anything with it

steam is missed yeah yeah

esteem is really annoying

it doesn't save anything I have to reset

everything every time I start that I

don't I don't get it

it hasn't been hey like when I said I

when I set up the controls the first

time to disable the Flaming which is the

whole point of this run

and I accidentally set there wrong on

Amazon or is that the wrong one so I

disabled charging instead

so so I went back and changed it so I

disabled flaming

and it worked that time but every time I

restart steam now it goes back to the

previous settings so charging isn't

working so so for some reason it has

saved my settings but it doesn't want to

resave my settings and I have no idea

what to think

yeah steam can be a bit confusing when

it comes to controller config

I wouldn't say confusing I I would just

say that it's it just isn't saving

it does save but then it just resets

back

next time I start seeing

I mean okay if it's something I have to

do which I for some reason did the first

time which I don't remember yeah in that

case it's very confusing because I just

don't understand

what I'm supposed to do

because it should just be to

yeah how am I supposed to play When the

camera does this house this time

and I can't really play with the

keyboard and mouse

and if I go to settings and controls

there isn't any

excuse

all right I don't have a back button

no

and

there isn't any options for that zone or

anything which seems Seems like an

obvious thing to include

let's pay for this one this one so yeah

and Sport doesn't want to pick up some

gems so let's get

it again

anyways from that so yeah

if I had a controller that wasn't

because I think the game is built and I

guess team too is built for an Xbox One

controller

the 360 controller had to be that cell

so if you place the stick in the wrong

position it will

move it kind of

let's make it back to him previous

levels

of summer forest

and it does this as well

I need help

I wanted to go back to pick up some orbs

because I have too few to even Challenge

and Ripta

so in this level

I don't want to talk to you

I want to go and

now wait I cannot do these challenges

so this one requires

yeah that one so this requires flame I

cannot do any of those

that one requires Flame

Australian Flame

uh yeah and I was doing this again I'm

trying to read this one doesn't have

enough enemies I can kill to get the

power up which I require to get these

forms

this one

this one I shouldn't be able to I should

be able to get two of these

and if I do order

and you came also I can use the

but but the strange thing is I have I've

been using this controller

in all previous streams and it hasn't

uh

behave like this before

so let's go to those two orbs

that shouldn't be much of a problem

hurry up

all right continue

why did they

turn around so quickly

so

I miss me

so and now

I should have the ability

to climb here

to get these two wraps

and this challenge I should be able to

do with charge only

I mean I must hit you as well

not there we go

was it three on the first one

yes

and that's one word

how many is it now

[Music]

16.

and then I should hit a second one first

and then I need to find 20 more orbs I

want to see if it's possible

are there enough orbs you can get with

shouting only

[Music]

they do spin oh what no

don't stand there

until you feel the urge to suddenly jump

in

why do you want to jump in this thing it

doesn't even

how would it go into that one

the survival Instinct of these Turtles

isn't great

and funny versus turtle yeah and this is

tail

Bunny versus a lot of turtles

well

yeah the bunny has to save these Turtles

from their stupidity

that was all and that's the second orb

foreign

so let's continue now

so this I could get and then there's no

more there

wait a minute can I get

oh yeah I should be able to get one more

here actually I just realized you modded

your own character into the game and

that's good yeah

this is

I haven't I haven't even mentioned that

no this is this is how the game works

normally you see this just

is in the game

perfectly normal

that's

what I didn't touch the network let me

try again now it works

yeah I haven't disabled that button

thank you I'm I'm actually quite happy

with how I managed today

in cameras for sure likes to zoom in

through the body

it's it's not perfect

the mouse

it's a bit weird

I first thought maybe an extra outfit in

the game it would be nice with outfits

they didn't consider that

but it looks cute thank you thank you

I'm happy I managed to

make her look cute

I think a few people have said that she

she looks a bit creepy I could see why

but as long as you see her from behind

it's fine don't look at her face

I wish it was in the game yeah

that would be great

thank you for the orb

so there's one oh I'll remember

something nice

the face is very you think this face is

cute

I wanted to Flame

there we go

I do have a serif flame button just in

case but the regular flame button I

always default depressing isn't working

so

I this shouldn't be any more hair I can

pick up so next next world

like that

this one no this one

so this one

contains an orb somewhere

nearest kid face it's it's great that

you think it's cute

it is um

Bianca and the rabbits in the sand game

basically took her head modified it

made the because her cheeks in pointing

points out

so I made it Roundy

just

stupid sheep

okay there should be one more orb on

this level I should be able to get

without flame I just don't remember

where it is

wait I think I remember where it is

and I'm not sure why I didn't pick it up

before

I'm going to go to the secret area

close your eyes if you don't want to see

where it is

oh I missed all right I know I didn't

okay go to your secret eye

so I'm now inside the secret area

it's pretty looked off

there's more gems

I can't see my eyes are covered now you

can look now

it's fine

I'm already gone into the secret areas

and no longer spoiler where it is or how

you get to it

foreign

I mean watching the spiral gameplay

might not be the best idea if you want

to avoid spoilers

should maybe be able to go from here

because there's the word

it looks good so far

yeah I should be able to do this

these baskets have white details

but now

let's see if I can yeah the dead zone is

messing me up

so

I think I paid for every

Mondays now

but you have to pay for every money bags

up when he to the last World and then

you pay for the head bash

and then the seconds

on the only Speedway in that world and

that should be all the money back so you

can pay for

and that should be everyone except for

one in this level which I've saved

because this

while I'm doing this run

I could test one more thing

I mean I should probably make a backup

I'll have just in case

no it shouldn't mess anything up

unlocked everything

but a bit of experimenting

but

I didn't want to launch Chrome

thank you now

let me just make a backup of your copy

just in case

never know it is

so I have a packet of it now so

so the idea here is that these money

bags for some reason

oh it only cost 100.

I

I hope that don't come into it

and then it's a start but then

you can do this

what's this about

wait can't you pay him again

oh

okay this is a bit of a slow process

I thought it was

I've been a bit quicker okay

okay let's ignore that

the campaign multiple times

but

it should get everything back yeah I was

hoping it cost a bit more than a hundred

so it would be a bit quicker but that's

kind of slow process

now let's see

if there are other near-disc requires

flame this requires Flame

oh yeah I was going to do this one but I

messed it up

so yeah there's so I should I need to go

back and pick this up again

I accidentally put one of those cows in

a place I cannot reach

but let me retry that and

not mess it up this time

Let's ignore all the enemies

yes

and then there's Canon I have the flame

it hit me while I was standing on it

[Music]

and then running across all those

enemies again

anyway

that was

no I just wanted to leave please let me

leave

all right I actually don't need the

cannon here

and then I will go and

get those two I

let me speak to you so I don't that

isn't getting in the way later on

and then

and then get rid of you

and it was this one I accidentally

pushed up there and I cannot get up

there without Flame

I will leave life far

so that goes

yeah a little further please

walk over there

slowly

a bit more

and that's enough

there you go

okay that was a bit weird

at least I didn't lose it

oh yeah and I cannot go up there

let's round this up

they are quite round

huh up

foreign

[Music]

and now

and then I push it down

wait what

what's going on at the moment

now finally

found your cows

yes here they are

although I'm getting attacked

I guess that one counts as long as they

can't

yeah

and then I also need to get the last one

from that other area

this Birds doesn't make it easy

not in so four and the last one and then

I will get that orbit

cannot get it to remaining ones

I think yeah I was able to get this one

up from here before

charging

head first into the cows

could you maybe get a bit further away

from the wall maybe just a bit

maybe this works anyway

oops I fell down

but I don't see a cow hair so I guess it

worked

and no more gems here I think I got

everything here

and there's the cow you're kind of in

the wrong spot

please walk up

yeah you're not making it easy yeah

hello Julie

Welcome to My Stream

and now I'm trying to get this cow

to the pen and

but it's not cooperating with me

hello

yeah I don't know what to say

Harley I'm

a

well

I guess I'm

getting over my frustration of steam but

but otherwise it's great

my hopes everything is nice with you

so now I'm getting the cow through here

finally I'm getting this orb

oh you're not the only way over there

he don't want to be pushed around

anymore no

maybe if you go to the pen you you won't

be pushed around anymore

and I think outside female by the way

oh that was close so give me the orb now

thank you

Hello Kitty in game

yeah look at this pon pon with a huge

bow

so that's the orb from that level

the only one I can get without flames

which these two requires Flame

that one request Flame

here

should be able to get these because yeah

because yeah the there aren't enough

enemies normally on the level to unlock

this supercharge but with this new power

up I have with the new ability actually

I should be able to do it now

on here is going to get what popping

yummies

I have the thought and no one else

except you and one other streamer

okay

it's intentional yeah I guess that

actually makes it better

no I got eaten

poppinium is our little secret

it's like an inside yoke yeah

[Music]

yeah thank you I was a bit worried that

I might wasted my time

that was close

and no one knows yeah

I like it

it is fun to save up in yamas one

is that

for I don't even remember how many I

need for the I also don't actually need

to rescue these Sages

anyway

I can I can play the last one info I

hope the game volume is good as well

do let me know if

any of the volumes need adjusting

all right

it's good volume that this sounds good

now

and now for the last one and then we can

listen the Beautiful song uh I got eaten

it's good

good

sounds good now I got three of three

confirmations

so now let's see

I have I need 14 I have four

oh

oh yeah wait there are many more hits

years

here there are more a lot more

shaking with heart

yeah that's

that's my feeling when you

showed up

perfect representation

so

that would be nine

so only five more and they should be

I keep forgetting about this bush

and I can't do anything about it and not

yet at least

and they are

let's see

one two three four five six

so that should be enough

so let's do it let's get

this stupid shots

I just need to escort this stupid

Alchemist

he doesn't need I have to take the

shortest route

and stay safe

please

I can't find my name out yeah I did I

sadly

I haven't been lucky enough to get a

random gift from

a bunny streamish

so I have a catamounts

and unicorn

yes I want to kick some butt even though

I'm going to

I don't know how to bash them in there

bunny

I tried looking around for cute bunny

as soon as I can have my custom emails I

I will be adding bunnies

muy bien

he have some funny pets

yay

thank you

and reading text at the same time

but there are

scary naked guess what

I'm scared of searching for bunny again

oh oh yeah it might we need to be

careful about searching for Banyan which

I have found one

money streaming

who is not a scare Nick I can't get it

so uh did I get power up though

Trump I can imagine oh yeah

I'm traumatized by that one

and yeah I'd like that one it's

traumatizing too

you're scaring the viewers

okay let's do this

okay

first to face

at least I don't have any essay but is

to deal with that moment

okay and are you traumatizing me

okay the evil cat is actually quite cute

cat being

intentional

that's I don't like

the sound of that

so there's the other orb

no cat could be evil yeah if they try to

they they're just going to fail

but that's on orbis

Orbeez

I want to see that I mean this must work

to get rid of those

evil bushes and trees

right

yeah I like that

but not

uh those bushes apparently

yeah I guess I should move over to Next

Level since I got the only orbs

but I need to get my revenge

no way that was a fake one uh at least I

got one of them I'm happy with that

and then she collects some more gems

because SpongeBob likes Trashies

one of your favorite Donuts

cats eel

you see this it's laughing and fish yeah

that's

that is the most evil thing

okay let's see

okay we're going to ignore the control

now

foreign

for that

the oh yeah I should be able to do this

one

and while it's loads I should post the

captain looks I have

all right

how does this work

this is how it works

I guess so

and they even work in a custom

I hope all those previous emotes also

worked in the custom chat thing

because I haven't

been able to pay attention exactly how

it Renditions on screen

I do see the shatter of course

[Music]

kids

they are cute and I'm happy I got a free

subscribe to that one

so I could use them

I don't like the white backgrounds and I

contacted the

streamer

who wants to do something about that

we'll see

maybe I can help out

yep

and this land has some

why do you only attack me you just had a

hippo thing or positive

finally

the tree is up here

I need to do this so I can get to the

actual place

where I can do the challenge

oh you got stuck in each other at night

eat it

cats

yeah cats are very cute we need cute

doggy I I

I would prioritize some Spanish Feist

I wouldn't mind cute tags for some

reason like I do think

if it wasn't

too much

if it wasn't because I can't bother

taking care of a pet I'm not going to

get a pet

and if I had to choose between a dog and

a cat I do think I would prefer a dog

but when it comes like a cartoon cat

cartoon animals like different emails

and stuff I do think cats are cutie

you know cute animals I want bunnies

animals are cute yep dogs are fun dogs

have fun pets

I guess dogs can be fun in many ways and

here's a thing I can't do without Flames

had to cheat a bit

that's part of the challenge

so you know what I just did that

oh here comes

shaking with heart

I like both but on the head dog my whole

life yeah I only have pet dogs

no

do this challenge

is that what

and the sound he was making

I wanted to make a puppy mouth but I

don't know how to do art

hey that's I guess that's the next dish

yeah I don't know how I would draw

okay can you do that please thank you so

I'll go with ghosts ghosts could be cute

too

cute sounds really cute

no that was horrible the previous one

was better

now I'm not going to try again

I mean I guess that's cute that was one

of the

oh yeah it is well because I paid for

that one though I can't go and do the

flight 11.

one of the redeems I was thinking

I was that

I have to do

one of the animal noises in the game

or and it doesn't have to be animal

noises specifically but

one of the noises

some character does it so it's so not

like speech or anything like that

I'm freezing to death wait

you get yourself a blanket or something

it started to open up the stream on your

phone and crawl into bed

oh my God please do yeah I'm going to

yes yes give me 50 followers so I can

get the

Channel points and stuff and then I'll

do it I promise I don't know how much I

would charge for it but

am I starting that's honestly free

Channel points you don't have to pay any

real money you can't even pay real money

for it

can see blankets

blankies okay I should be able to do

this challenge which again no Flame

that's

that's the whole

this whole

around

wait where are they

are they there

yeah scream for your life you come to

burn where I'm supposed to take that one

okay

so far so good

kind of taking them in a random ordered

mode

I want my blankies don't worry popping

yum you can do it

I like the encouragement

I do appreciate that

even if it might not sound like it I

don't know I don't know how it sounds

oh well

it is hard because you have to charge to

attack but when you charge you die bump

and these are quite low to the water so

I had to pull up quickly so I don't

fall down

I mean this is going surprisingly well

to be honest

but now I'm missing one Arch that is

I did it

surprisingly well that was a bit too

easy I feel like

but now the orb

if you ever need any help I'm here might

help with uh encouragement

or should you play it again for me

hey

I'm done but I like helping

that's nice I do like helping too

I was trying to be positive

oh I see

sometimes it's hard to get the context

for a chat I do feel like when I'm

writing in the chat I write my messages

quite long it does help with adding

context

but sometimes I feel like I'm writing

too much in a single comment compared to

most people

I mean I would say that I do write more

per comment than most people

[Music]

oh no I was so close

yeah I am good at this I didn't let him

say that but he said it I thought he was

supposed to be good at this

wait I thought I got I was

let me try again please after

here comes the sharing

nine oh yeah I don't know can you see

the number

I I'm going to reach 50. 14 15 16 17 18

19 20 21 22.

23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35

7 38 I always feel like 38.

so you really won't do nothing

okay it can't actually barely see the

what the action number is so that's cute

laughs

in that case I don't have accounts even

though it was kind of fun to count as

well but yeah going to reach 50. that's

good

so

hello we can see it it's readable

distracted me today

no

um

I wouldn't blame you

it is really double I do would like to

it's very common that I've seen a lot of

students putting their character on the

bottom right but that's where Aspire

likes to put the numbers

so

I got that one

this one I've made I think

yeah there you go

no

sometimes you feel like the Turning is

very slow

animals are blessing

I like chatting with the mess

too lazy

I must say I mean if you write text I

can read it

if you write the notes I can't really

read them

and then my head facing forward shaking

cat foods I think it's cats

cats and glow sticks shaking

in

uh encouraging matter

might matter

I don't know

there you go this time I was busy trying

to look at the emotes and somehow I just

did it

okay I take it

he did it I somehow I did I wasn't even

concentrating and then I just did

Paris says through the Rings

I don't

can someone explain to me like why why

is rings in like capital r

and like grab the loot with a capital l

but if we look here it's like keep us

with Capital H but then it saves well

lowercase t

he still did it wow that's amazing he

rocket thank you I don't know how to

this is uh too much

too much for me I'm not used to this

this is my sixth time streaming in token

I think

at least that was twitch said so I I

assume it's correct you are so so much

at this again I will

say that's because I played it too much

way way too much

like you can drop down wait no not there

I think that's a trap no maybe you can

drop down those

I can probably drop them both and then

you can

go down like this

swim down into this cave

and back up

service and look an orb

for some reason

that one was really hard for me to get

let's just meet one Speedway again

because priest one went so well so why

not jinx it

do you make mods yeah

no okay

Bank checklist

I have made ponpon of course

for what games do you have mods uh I've

actually

that was quick

I'm only modded spiral reignited

seriously

and I have a modified

let's use that term all the games but I

haven't really

that one's a bit tricky to reach

but never really put together a full

proper mod for any other game

poor Pom-Pom

wait

wait how did I get each all of them

I I don't know how how I keep

doing it doesn't make any sense to me

oh no this is the wrong way

I did what did the game put me in the

wrong way

oh so cool

yeah

let's see no no

wait is that more

another one yeah I'm not doing so great

in this

and then there's birds left yeah this is

done that was close yeah I think I

should go the other way I just didn't

know which way the game put me when it

comes to those distractors things

I like it it's a lot like your kid first

time

no no wait what are you doing

the

I like that you find my

personality is cute

I'm

I'm really

struggling when people say nice things

but I also try to say nice things to

people

too

I want to spread positivity

but I'm really bad at

taking positivity

yeah I think I think I missed one

so not the quickest turn around

oh there was on now I just need to know

where birds are

they at the end of this tunnel no they

aren't

they were probably at the end of the

previous time

or there are here actually

and I need to fly up all the way

up up

was that a double

I missed

that was a zero so I guess that's it

even still have once yeah whatever is it

timer that low really

people say I'm cute I just can't accept

it

but you are cute

yeah yeah

the hitbox is kind of large on these

that's good

with the ring sounds

almost fell down there

and then I should be able to do that

light up light up

don't apply a by the way

now what and then I learned the next

state

okay

[Music]

um

I ain't my grandma

you can be a kid gremlin

so

yeah I'm getting better at that part

give me extra time and then I just need

to

how the bird birds are here okay let me

take care of the birds first then

that was a double

didn't chase the birds but

no it's instant Cambridge

that wasn't the bread this is this is a

little tricky

I might need to still take this

bye extractor things

because they give me more time

this game is a bit

um

what was kind of balance was that

and stingy is probably the time of about

giving me time it's plus one forever ago

this plus one for every ring

rings I get because they're so easy but

but it counts

okay let me take this

tractor things yeah and they're like

three wheel things

but then the problem is of course I have

to run all the way to the parts

did you just be down here

so wasn't too far

I collided with the birds

no I started flying Charlie

I'm gonna do this

that's another one there's two more

where are you

now I typed early now I got so close

I think I have it now I know how to do

it

I was good

I almost have it soon just one more try

and now now she did

you can do it

Central encouragement now I should see

if I can do

see if I can no I can't do it that's the

motivation I need

private timers are in the stomach

camping now

and these I get three seconds from

and then run all the way to the birds

I wonder if there's a quicker way of

getting into the bird

and then I just need to

concentrate here ignoring the chat for a

moment

and there you have it

I that's a

white cat

with

oh my God

yeah very small oh my God you did it yes

I did it

with the help of your encouragement

I couldn't have done it you're amazing

oh thank you

and when

now anyone could have done that they

we didn't have practice

that I tend a lot to say

no

idea yeah

no I did actually challenge another

streamer of doing it and

it is actually kind of fun seeing

where are the birds

I'm going to spin around the same area

and it was funny because another stream

I did this on the first try and not even

now

so I felt like I was doing something

hard but it wasn't too hard too at the

end

I get sick

wait a minute

press the button I don't have available

and then shoot yeah I can't do that

counter yeah this button doesn't work

this button doesn't work this button

doesn't work

it's there

yeah I can't shoot I'm sorry Hunter

honestly no you don't

a spaceship no sorry I cannot fly the

spaceship I can't I can't cheat with

spaceship

so

foreign

thank you kitten

I would like to see you play the Inspire

game

I do like people playing Spider doesn't

matter how good the art game actually I

do prefer a few words at the game

because it's more fun seeing people

finding ways of trying to

complete levels there is that one where

I'm possibly able to get

I'm just not good at it

and that one I can't get

and then

that I keep pressing the wrong buttons

the back button doesn't work

maybe I will I'm not that good but I'm

gonna try and that's that's what's so

great

that's that's why I had this

self-imposed challenge that's what you

call it

to

um limit what I can do so

during the Speedways

without a flame does make it harder

but yeah

but that's a

I think I read kind of meme oh there it

is some about it that

no it wasn't

the Enderman it was basically two people

talking to each other and one person

says like

invite the person into doing something

and the person was

and replied with something like I'm not

good at it

yeah but because you never do it but you

can give it a try but I'm so bad at it

yeah but if you at least

do it at least

yeah basically

I don't

going back and forth like that

and I do get the feeling that's similar

to when people

when it comes to the flight levels in

the spiral when people say that they are

so bad at flight levels but they never

do the flight levels because they're bad

at them

which is why they're bad at him

so Club temples this is actually uh

interesting looking level I like the I

do like kind of the cloud and

cloud

scenes

I do like cloud and candy theme which is

interesting this level is doesn't have

any candidate

which is the bunny streamer I know

can't a cloud scene

having fun is the most important out

excuse me I'm reading

it's the most important thing even

if doing challenges yeah yeah I wouldn't

do this if I didn't find it fun

but here we got an impossible thing

because I'm pretty sure I cannot charge

this

and I cannot continue the level

without flaming so that's the exception

I'm not good at flight levels but I will

try to get better at the game

it's

I would at least when I'm watching

Steamers I would at least prefer even if

people don't try to go for the

all-in-one

that if they at least try to get the all

the four in multiple separate attempts

because that's at least

a challenging enough

yeah let's get rid of this

challenging enough

to do you

I already spit that one out I didn't get

another one

but yeah but some people just keeps it

gives it one attempt and then never

tries it again

of course

uh

I'm not going to force any streamer to

do it or like complain about them not

doing it I would

they still like encourage them at least

going front handles and it's like at

least like a compromise

but

okay if they refuse to they refuse to

I don't want to be annoying

so there you go

yeah that's the biggest problem these

big ones I have to get rid of them

if it weren't for them or if I could

charge them

I wouldn't have to cheat so much

you're not annoying you're cool then

thank you I

put that

yeah I haven't

well I actually watch one of his streams

but it is

um more fun when you do speak so if you

can get

a microphone or something if you have

something available

I think you should just be able to use

your phone uh you might not be the best

but that doesn't matter

what quality isn't what

it's important

it is just hearing

your thoughts and also reading comments

you are super nice popping yum that's

very nice to hear Julie you're very nice

too I'm actually very

happy this I must run in front of it I

must I was happy to see you

wait

you were inside that wasn't supposed to

foreign

what happened there

I thought did I touch him or something

love you that I didn't really ever

comment on here I've got to start by

this

cheating agency

yeah okay so let me know when you

do your next dream because yeah

you don't schedule anything and you

basically stream at random times

uh so I don't know

yeah so I'm not ready

and it's basically it's for every stream

actually I do prefer if people

I understand that not everyone actually

streams according to school it doesn't

work and twitch doesn't allow you to set

any of your times

okay I didn't touch him so I guess that

was the problem

so he didn't walk all the way in

so yeah if twitch could allow you to

basically sit at one time stream

and so you could

and I think that's the because people

people say that yeah check my Twitter or

Discord or something for upcoming

streams but

if I'm going to follow I don't know how

many I follow right now more than 10 at

least

maybe up to 15. if I were to follow ever

all of these people's Twitter or Discord

that would be a lot to keep track of

and I can't do that

I hadn't scheduled now because I'm bad

with the time yeah I understand if you

can't have a

schedule if you don't follow it and it's

mostly

a twitch fault for not having us way to

support it but yeah it does make it

harder for me to

actually know when you're streaming and

I said

I can't follow everyone's Twitter or

Discord that would be too much

so uh

that's why I try to keep a schedule

myself

so everyone can look up when the next

East

and it tricked me there you go nothing

no more flaming

Spyro

I usually just like in my friend's

stream when I'm home

I tend to

do that sometimes when I'm home I just

I hear I can't get that so I think I got

all the

both gems and of course I guess I can

clear these

are a bit more

yeah usually when I'm home check whoever

is streaming

and then I join whatever stream

I do try to write something

but sometimes

and then yeah

and then I must be quiet in a lot of

time in the Stream

kind of hard half lurky maybe

I think that's all

okay

all right let's stand on the plant

so I cannot cut that thing

I'm too awkward in streams I feel that

I'm really awkward

I feel like I'm awkward at the moment

you are natural though

but if you think I'm an actual at the

moment you must be a natural too

because I think I'm awkward

I mean I'm just

I'm just doing this

I'm just sitting here talking

getting confused about that level

because I'm supposed to

I leave the level

because I found everything

you're very cool fun fun you like to

you like to give me a lot of compliments

and I don't know how to answer it every

time

but it will be much more interactive

than what channel points and everything

only is it depends at which states that

I have 33 followers at the moment but

only 31 counts towards the

the the affiliate thing

so I guess two followers aren't

like

approved

or something I don't know

because I think I have one person who

has only followed me and

and I've only watched my streams and

that's possibly a system they have in

place to prevent people from creating

multiple accounts just to follow oneself

you're doing amazing thank you I tried

this thing once but I barely could even

speak

I feel like I think that's more for

kitten to answer because you've been

around for a long time and it's brought

me a lot and I do appreciate that a lot

and

how my first Dream is in Demon up it

never saved so it's lost but how I did

on my first stream I felt that one was

awkward

can I get this one with parents

I could get a barrel of the barrel

that didn't help me

no I cannot get a good barrels

I have taken away

with the barrel

I have to ignore it in before I die the

first thing was amazing

I mean you say that everything is

amazing so maybe I shouldn't ask you

I really liked it you do enjoy it

but it does give me encouragement to

continue I think I think that's what he

what would help the most having someone

who is as supportive as kidneys

boots

oh yeah I can do this

because I did have this ability

because the first Dream I played through

spider three

even though this is by two but without

using any abilities spider had cotton

sins

and spray one

and this

sometimes

can I confuse it with that to run

because I keep forgetting all right I

can do this I'm actually allowed to do

this just just flaming I can't

I will try to speak in my streams but

I'll probably get mixed up with English

and Spanish but that's fine you could

just label your stream I suppose English

and Spanish and encourage both English

and Spanish speakers to show up

I do wonder I could imagine if English

speakers are less encouraged to join

multi-language streams I wouldn't be

surprised

you can have Spanish people showing up

Spanish speakers

yeah

and the problem is muscle language

strings unless you do speak both

languages is that

if the person speaks one language you

might not what

if you only speak one of the two

languages you want to understand

what the person is saying sometimes

that's what I get for knowing three

languages I mean speakers languages

which is on your stream

I mean I know two languages so I mean

I'm not sure what you're talking about

and I don't feel like

okay I'm getting pummeled at the moment

so I actually don't I don't know

yeah I don't think yeah Flame the Box

you know I can't do that I'm a bunny I

don't have Flame

do you think I'm a kind of a dragon or

something do you ever have to fly for

some reason because I heard these

magical wins the wings does not cram the

flame

and for anyone curious the yeah but

that's not disable Flame I'm disabled

separately from the month

it would be kind of fun to have that

awesome on this one

yeah

I know it's a little Spanish but I

understand it all

it

that's outside

it is to to me easier to understand the

language than to actually speak it

yeah

English Spanish and French that's a nice

combo

it's kind of I was gonna say that's

quite the

um romance combo

English is technically Germanic but it's

quite heavily influenced by romance

languages so I guess it's a romance

combo anyway

you just can't keep a sentence in

Spanish oh

you wouldn't say that you are

whoops

fluent enough in

can I stop shooting me so I can get up

here

I don't have to fall down

Spanish was my first language

wait I sorry I'm confusing to people

here that's what I get for trying to

play the game and talk at the same time

let me get everything straight here in

my head

that's what I get for knowing three

languages English brothers and friends

that's nice combo science was my first

language

so

yeah so you speak Spanish fluently

um and

you could do then English was my second

and third of us French so you could you

could just I mean you could stream in

Spanish in that case encourage Spanish

speakers to join otherwise

but it could be Spanish English combined

but you in that case you have to keep

these sentences to

yeah so pause okay because that's what

you

yeah you said that you you probably get

this piece of food English and Spanish

yeah but of course it's important to

your game not because we establish if

you're going to stream but but you give

your best shot and you will get better

at it every time so don't worry uh about

that mixing up it and such you'll get

better at it

I'll switch up another yeah but the more

you speak the better I add it you will

get and then I need to safety what's

really right as well

it is important message

I know it's a little Spanish but I

understand it all you do understand all

of Spanish

we just can't keep ascending in Spanish

Portuguese is good oh yeah yeah yeah

yeah it's kind of similar to how I

to Norwegian to me because it's so

similar to Swedish

I can't speak Norwegian

uh

but I can understand it I wouldn't say I

wouldn't say honest that all about

Norwegian there are still things I don't

understand

but I've tried to learn

and I died and Norwegian words so I

can't understand which matter

and now the chat doesn't want to scroll

down

please please switch

work with me so

there's too many languages I want to

learn but someone said you shouldn't be

afraid of mixed up language while

streaming just do it

yeah

you give your best and

it's attacking the first time I saw it

attacked

I mean the worst thing that happens is

that you mixed up two languages that

isn't

that isn't a bad thing

you're not gonna get punished for it

I'm currently getting punished

I know they'd be kind of hard

I had my Affinity I mean yeah English is

I mean

if you can still understand Spanish

I can't understand why you would focus

more on

using English I mean you can I don't

know Spanish

because

um and it's called

selfish stuff there yeah you have to

learn English and we can speak so you

get to talk to the popping you

English was harder when I was learning

it yeah English was really strange when

I was learning it I was

I don't remember when I started learning

English probably when I was seven years

old

and then we said

I think it's from seven years

and you start learning English in Sweden

but it might even be even in younger age

now

but yeah English was really strange and

the strangest thing I can remember that

I found English doing is what the whole

whole thing with

a 15 yeah I'm not going to get this

how in English use what's called a

definite which when you use the word is

the or the when you when you don't

stress it and because in Swedish that's

you kind of inflect the word

you just add a suffix on the word to

make it a definite word

and that was what I used to because I

only knew Swedish and then English puts

a whole separate word in front of the

words make it definite that was strange

but that's actually very common in

languages so it's actually English what

so it's actually Swedish that is this

strange language here

when using suffixes is quite rare in

languages for definite form

let's continue

can I ask you something if you're free

to ask yeah anything uh

and

you you're not allowed to ask me if you

can ask me something you just have to

ask mate okay now that was just

kidding

um

can you make a redeemed to speak another

language

I could depends on what you mean exactly

do you mean that

if I if someone wants me to do say say a

sentence an English sentence in Swedish

I could do that

so you basically just write your English

sentence and I will say this which

that's no problem

but if you if you want to write a

language and have me speak it in another

language

in that case I have to look up a

pronunciation I have done a few

languages so I can speak

I can hopefully pronounce a few

languages

but I don't know what station means but

people could write things I shouldn't

say so that's not

and so I need to keep up

that was reply I'll let your reply be 80

I keep the ones that probably undirected

me I read them out and I play a game

that uses Swedish for The Voice lines

because it plays on a Swedish Island

a Swedish island is that

it is three main islands that could be

if you know the name of it it's ooland

which is technically Finnish but they

speak Swedish gotland which is the

largest Swedish Island and the smaller

is Ireland but then there's a loads

loads of smaller islands all over Sweden

which it also could be

oh this could be a fictional island it

could be that too but I would like to

know more about that

so like there's a friend streamer that

has a redeem of five minutes of him

speaking French because he is French oh

so I should just speak Swedish instead

of English I don't think that's a cute

redeem because

that would

five minutes kind of long time and then

people won't understand me anymore

I don't think that's a good idea but I

could do the whole

you could use that to make a itax suite

for a minute it's cute I would like it

well in that case let's let's go for it

let's see how well it goes so yes

um

probably ethical

um

let's make it oh yeah

[Music]

and

oh all right your life story okay was

that fun

oh my God

I really need to learn yeah you can try

to not sweet I I'm I'm in capilan's

relationship if you really want learning

uh I need 15 so I got 14 12 something

and yeah your he obviously know Swedish

considering what he wrote

I read it so cute is it cute when I

speak Swedish

let's rock

Maybe

13 so I need two more I keep forgetting

what number it is

you sound nice and cute and is it a year

is a nice and cute kitty

I mean give me calling you kitty that's

that's kind of a nice and cute names

then

it's a place I want to visit a lot when

I have 70. but yeah

our place

I would guess like

do you want to visit Sweden but it

sounds like more like you want to miss a

certain place of Sweden

or maybe you want to visit Finland in a

Swedish being part

pinyam you sound really kids being

Swedish maybe Swedish I've heard Swedish

being described as more of a

and because we just has a lot of

vows

because it's like at least in my dialect

is 17 of them

all vows are monothong as they're called

and so with 17 different vowels I could

see that becoming more of a

sounding more like a song

I had my chance there and I believed

just any places with it yeah I I would

like like I mentioned before I would

like to meet meet you seems like a nice

person of course you shouldn't meet

strangers on the internet but

beauty isn't astringent

okay I know how to get these now and

that and then I get knocked out by the

windmill

that thing here go down

or is that a thing I need to do

all right now it comes down

yeah

we didn't know what what a Swedish

islands that was and then we go there or

something

so I need flame for this I can't do

anything

Now check my please thank you

I mean I've also thought about just

playing spiral in Swedish because it has

been dubbed to Swedish

and then I can basically kind of like

explain how everything works or

something

do you have a cool place to recommend

because I don't know for me just that

Sweet Misery I mean for me it's Sweden

is just Sweden

so I don't know if there's any place I

would recommend

but I need more money just to visit them

around here yeah I understand that

me too I can't afford traveling so I got

the power up now which was the girl

and because I died this one returned

anyway

should I speak to this person first

clear the tractor path okay let's do

that

oh wow it's very quick and I can't see

anything

not really

understand the breaking animation but

it's kind of getting in the way

oh no I failed

oh no it is one of these again

cheating

cheater

when I was young my family needed a

vacation to Sweden my father has a

friend he moved to Sweden so we stayed

there near our Coast I remember it was

awesome I should ask where it was yeah

that would be nice to know

because I mean unless all of Sweden is a

coast

as it is like a

what do you call it in English

I

there's a word for that in English the

Swedish word is half Island which is

much easier to remember

English is Anthony's language with all

these strange words

I think I know it is but I have no idea

how I even would

pronounce it

I need to clear off

the last pumpkin that

I didn't make that jump

I actually two of them there you go

that's all three

thank you

I have traveled to four different

countries

and they were cool Mexico Canada

Australia and Belize

I'm going to travel again soon maybe

back to Canada

oh you traveled

we travel they have traveled a lot

and how many can I actually been in a

few countries but all countries are

together in Central Europe

can I drive around with a car

so that would be let me see if I can't

remember oh that was all let me get that

question mark jar

and so it was Austria

czechia

Slovakia and Hungary

pretty sure those those four are in a

group

as far as I know my European geography

now let's see

where is the jar

oh wow I basically never left EU yet a

meaning I mean I don't need it I forgot

that I've actually been to the United

Kingdom too but I did that when it was

in part of EU so I still haven't left it

um

I wanna travel around the world

sometimes I I do want to visit other

countries outside the e as well just

easy to travel within here I lost this

yard I don't know where it went

I go back to the start and see if it's

there

I never left Brazil before coming to

Portugal oh wait I only went through the

start and there was no jar here I had to

find a jar

and it's so different I can imagine

Europe and South America being quite

different

I mean every

every country and even parts of our

country can be quite different which is

why I find it so silly when people say

that

my country is so diverse and different

in different parts of that that applies

to every single country there's nothing

special with your country

um

and then

yeah I have no idea what is the jar went

oh there it is

now I'm back on track

and I mean unless sure if it's like

Andorra or Lichtenstein maybe like Lee

kitten style I think and maybe San

Marino those are tiny countries maybe

they don't find that much diversity

within that but

it's behind this wall I think but but

yeah yeah there it is

it's kind of hard when I'm constantly

getting attacked by these things I can't

destroy because they're flying too high

they're cheating they're not nicely

spawned on

I'm mad at you

Mexican abilities

were able to go they quickly but uh

Australia was a long trail I can't yeah

Mexican and Belize are close together

and Australia is quite far away

most of my friends are Australian yeah

I'm actually

surprising amount of Australians I've

actually gotten I have seen

because you basically ah

when do you when you consider a stream a

friend

because it's kind because you do still

have quite a connection with this

streaming by typing unlike for example a

YouTuber who just do the video

independent of the

after com commenters

oh yeah that was nice nice guy

but for streams you actually have direct

contact with this streamer which which

is actually why I

moved over to

and watching and doing screens

is strong she actually connect on metal

enemies I think I think this is this is

all I can do here so let's leave the

level

and kind of getting half distracted by

the shot but but it's fun it's fun this

is what I want

because yeah I kind of

mostly alone so this is actually fun fun

yeah they are they're my mods

but

should someone be a mod here

I don't have a mods

I would probably need mods one day

I guess

your head on that stone

the chat is a fun place it is a fun

place I love being in the chat

I can see you've learned the value of

orbs thank you Professor What's Your

Name by the way Professor I can't call

you Professor that's like calling

someone

I don't know

that's like calling money bags I'm

A salesperson

sales bear

I think I would like to consider all my

friends

all of them we are friends right

Julie we are friends

I love seeing when you show up in chat

what makes me very happy can I get

through this without taking damage

no because I cannot hit these cows

attack on shoot forever right

yeah yeah I can't do anything about that

mods are helpful when you get invited by

bad yeah but I think I got my very first

stream there was some

spam message that's showed up like in

first minutes or so

I haven't seen anything like that since

so I actually made

I need to continue I actually made a

French

from another stream where we are mobs

and last year I traveled to them because

they live near the French Quarter

basically made amazing new friends

because watching YouTubers yeah

yeah

people are very friendly I think I think

it is because of the close connection

you have on the twitch compared to

YouTube because on YouTube You're

basically

uh no bodies and you write your message

and then you just leave the place you

basically writing your message in stone

and then no one knows who you are but on

which you have more direct connection to

people no more like a direct

communication that was what I wanted to

say

so that's the people that are

more friendly that way I feel like

because people are much more strict

about how rude you can be on Twitch

compared to for example YouTube

I remember that yeah the spam message

so cute ban them it helps a lot

I'm glad that haven't happened me more

than once so

so

happens for a lot of stuff but you need

them here most of your

stream so they can help you with shout

outs and planning bars and trolls yeah

definitely you are so correct about that

can I can I no I cannot goodbye

I'm going to die

that orb is impossible and the two other

orbs on this level

are these it is another orb that is to

finish the level I still cannot push the

back button I don't have a back button

yeah if

people I have good

contact with

thank you like I would say the ones I

had the most contact with at

watching other streams

would be Julie M kitten but I am getting

to know more and more people

not to

I hope to see beautiful in more often

on other streams and things like that

too

dancing Pikachu so there is this one

maybe I should learn one of those rocket

ones in but I need some help

oh I was almost missing that up

let me just pick up this here please

ignore me

yes

ow yes a parent I really appreciate the

way too she works with having moderation

and stuff

technically YouTube has said our also

but who uses that it also helps with

carrying more and more communities by

everyone having

art another one

yeah

I would like to I wouldn't mind yeah

that worked oh I need to I took damage

from it anyway so so much for so much

for using that trick

and so yeah so I wouldn't mind like

helping someone else modding if they

like in return help promoting

and for me to like help each other out

that will work

you're doing great fun fun with strings

thank you

going all the way up

so here's the power up

and here's the orbital nail machine game

should be able to get

because this power apricot is fling

yeah

I'm pretty sure I cannot charge this but

I can give it a shot or a lack of a shot

see what they did there

no that didn't work

but the flying is still useful so I can

I'll keep it

yeah that isn't working

so

yeah then I

collect some more gems I guess I don't

need them but

it's fun I like collecting gems

I like the sound of these

that was a different sound let's try

again

there we go

I can't I can't do a balloon popping

sound

and that's my best attempt

this contains a lot of gems

so

Hey listen

and then I need to

I guess basically charge this

and then collecting these and I think oh

there's one up there

I'll be right back because this is

something for a club

it's tomorrow yeah fun having your hair

yeah

surprised that

signature I always I always have a fun

surprise

it makes me happy

I I have no expectation I don't I don't

expect anyone to shop

no no yeah

I guess the good thing about that is it

makes me extra happy that people do shop

and if I expect people to show up that

would make me sad if people don't show

up so I shouldn't expect

so I guess having a low expectation is

the right thing

I guess I guess the correct time would

be no expectation

it but now I think about it kind of kind

of feels a bit true I have no

expectation for you to show up

now

assuming I shouldn't expect you to show

off that my am I that might be sound

better maybe I hope

I I don't I don't require you to show up

you you come if you want

and I'm always happy to see you around

there are really a few levels in this

world right I think this is this is all

the orbs I can get

because dude okay

your stream makes me happy I've been to

others and you have been to all my

stream and I wish it was because as far

as I know you cannot give Channel points

but I do wish I could give Channel

points to every person who has shown up

to my previous dreams like a bonus some

amounts per stream

so you don't have to start at zero I do

hope you start at 300 because your phone

away I think that's how it works

well I had a nice quote Oh

expect nothing appreciate everything I

really like this one yeah I think I

heard that one too that's kind of

basically what I meant

but that yeah that's that it is a it's a

very short

uh concise way of phrasing it's it's a

good quote

I want to make you feel happy about

being a stream that's why I showed up

even if there are problems in the

beginning yeah there's been problems in

every spices now how fast is it's a

Steam not making it easy

so I wanted to do double check this on

purpose and let me do it go through

these

all three requires flaming requires that

that frames

let me double check because I don't

think I can do more I think I got this

is the end of this uh

end of the game for as far as you can

get without flaming

so two of those require flaming lamps

you have to Flame the lamps and the last

one requires you to spit which you do

with the flame button

this one you have to Flame the fish

this one you have to spit the hockey

pack and Flame the statues

here you have to this one is annoying

because I could do

uh one of these requires spitting but

the other two I should be able to do if

I could kill enough enemies and the 10

enemies that are part of One Challenge

doesn't count as enemies otherwise I

could unlock the power up and actually

get the two other orbs

so I mean they are technically locked

out

that one occurs is Flaming

and then I got the rest

that requires flaming fish and the other

one requires flaming

sinks

that requires flaming two for two of

those

the third one

is the bones which requires spitting for

one of the bones otherwise I can get all

except one bone

make a count the cowlick number two

requires uh Flame

to get them out of the pit

and then there's two orbs for the seeds

which were quite spitting

one is a car is Flaming that's the

traveled with the trolley a that

requires flaming

and the other one requires using cannon

which also flames

Scorch yeah that's freaking flaming for

the black keeper if if I just didn't

have to shoot down the flat keeper

because the second part

after shooting it shooting down doesn't

require any flames

that's what I could do but I cannot get

involved and then that one I did

that one okay spitting

and then at rest and then in the final

word world

that's one of them I can get which is

chasing those kangaroo looking things I

think maybe they are kangers whatever or

whatever they are and the other one

requires fitting so there's one orb I

can get

that one requires and using the ice

Flame

Metropolis that one but the one I just

did one requires flaming the bombs for

for the arcs and the other two is

shooting down those sausage I cannot

charge

and that one is

flaming the bugs actually then I tried

charging them but I don't think I can

get up enough so I mean I maybe I could

get that one and that one record

shooting so so one more orb and maybe

two but adapter can get that one so I

could get one more orb getting to 34 but

the game requires I get 40 to defeat

crypto

which I cannot so this is actually the

end of the game

so

I guess that's it

the bonus is being here and chatting

with you it is it is really nice having

you to chat it

[Music]

no I mean you're not pretty either you

could just like

pumped it's reptile when it was standing

in front of you or something I don't

know

I feel like Rift is more brain than you

um you're doing good yeah this is the

end actually so since I was planning of

having such more minutes but I don't

know what else I should do so

you're my favorite twitch streamer do

you watch anything that's my next

question do you watch any other twitch

streamers

thank you

excitingly waiting for the honest answer

maybe or is that a maybe not I mean if

it's not I mean I'm at madly your

favorite and also the worst twitch

streamer you watch as well

so I mean that doesn't mean much

but let's not have favorites

I'm just one of those you come back to

watch

you're the best

it's really nice of you to say that

even if I travel and travel accepting it

I do have alternative things so I guess

I guess this is the end of the adventure

and then

I'll start the Inspire 3 on Sunday does

that sound good thank you for the comfy

stream yeah should we see if some

streamers online

and see if

can try that racing again

I tried to do that last time and I'm not

sure you have my letter went

I'm still getting

used to the whole

thing here

I'm not used to

and I don't

have any options here and there

I have to go through this thing

yeah okay it doesn't do it easy for me I

guess I just do it like this

close

because I have to close the browser to

to give the computer more power

we'll see whoever I'm following is

online and then we'll just give them a

little visit

we have a

nothing

oh there we go there we go I got

something

let's let's go to

a nice a nice friend named Roy

he's he's really really nice and it

would be really fun to actually rate his

channel

so actually I do have a reads message

this time and I know exactly what it

should be

the winners please cooperate

uh so all we do

is

yeah all you do is copy this message

yeah

please

copy that and then as we get into his

Channel all you do is paste that

in the share in the chat that's all you

have to do

oh that's how you actually can hear

the command slash rate

that makes it easier

and then

we'll do that in the hopefully for the

best

can I

should should I be able to open it here

so I can

I don't know how to do which works I'm

still learning

so

instead of waiting for the full

countdown let's go over now and see you

on the other side

foreign
