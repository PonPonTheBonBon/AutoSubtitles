I'm feeling

better the computer is of course not

feeling better it's feeling the same as

you

should

[Music]

overworked let's

see if I

[Music]

can find

I

find a reference picture that I can

use

hello yes chil would be a great idea

let's

do

wait just the

commment maybe it just

that

no

was oh that's

S I made that type

so I think that that that's a a good

reference so the the uh skirt would be

similar to

the school

girl okay got this SC here but I wanted

to make it

different so first I need a

new place to put the outfit what was

going to this which is it's

[Music]

replacing there you

go it's the party one what's that called

called internally I need to know that

go Skins here go it must

be

party party Pony no no that's

the that's the Unicorn

[Music]

out what is

the

h

trying to figure out what

the clown it might be clown

actually oh post to shake

okay spr

tag welcome welome I'm pring for a new

outfit a CH to be

specific I'm not done thatan got first

today that's the third first in the

row so if

I open this

texture

yes it is

clown

good I can now name it correctly this

is

clown and it's going to be replaced with

SH so and it's going to have Pon pwn and

it's going to have

Theo

duplicate and put in here don't need

these

anymore and I go to R name

these can I spell clown apparently

almost

not and I can't

spell

B nud P well temporarily there's no

details so don't worry only detail is

s you can see a

f her bow is new too is being on

white but I idea where they

[Music]

from being all

white no don't look oh no I need to look

from her look there we

go now you don't see her

front okay I will add the sorry remember

all the notes

here this Coco clown is I can find I

don't

forget

so cheek no don't look at her

butt that's not making it

[Music]

better

okay

[Music]

I'll take the I'm not when I want to

recreate this card cuz I want this scard

to have a different sign a similar but

different sign I'm still going to I can

still cop like this

[Music]

part not sure why I made it this way

but and still get like the IDE of um how

long it should

[Music]

be makes it much better you want like a

fully

nude um outfit

option me of course you want

[Music]

that

who

that well I guess

[Music]

fine and then how big was this SC some

something like

this should name this clown

skirt

he going pulling in the clown so

how I wonder if this

uh that not

help

I wanted to see

uh I can look at another C model that

has a skirt that actually the skirt that

I can use

[Music]

as

okay I got to S my

[Music]

name I want to do

this oh yeah

yeah okay

okay I see I

[Music]

see so it will have

like yeah this is better okay

okay the p in their life and this is why

you should have

a the p p

plushy which I mentioned every

stream so you can dress her however you

want or in some cases

undresser okay so what I want to do is

make like

[Music]

like

that I wonder if I'm doing this

correctly

[Music]

now

I want the pet ears yeah yeah

that's very nice outfit and then go lay

down in bed petting her ears that sounds

kind of nice

actually real life P Pon pillow

[Music]

ium well I was thinking a whole plushy

3D and everything not just a not just

like a print on a plush

hello oh my

still can I do

have how much is

this 22

okay

[Music]

[Music]

here we

go

now let's do the thing I wanted to

do

me I can work on

this oh real size yeah so I was kind of

what I I think made

PR

wait H yeah I real knif is basically the

same thing if I understand correctly

but I'm still doing things wrong here

just can I do anything

correct no it's supposed to be correct I

just seeing things

wrong well anyway so if you if you're

not seeing like a PR on upow how would

that f p p work in that

[Music]

face and I did so much work on us straps

and the

editing and yesterday and it's Bish

shows up in game

anyway if someone went to

it's

I'm just coing some

me I hope I hope you

cozy we had to have a good

time well I hope people have a good

time

like

this it's like a this like a or

something

I know those CS might be r as

small good time

oo good time switch pun

[Music]

pun

okay

so so the idea is that these will go

together like

this

and then

this

m

yeah if it's if it's too small that's

about

why so like this

I should probably not smack

them Infinity

[Music]

[Music]

small you probably just close it make it

close like that

and I should probably pull every Point

together I'm still

experimenting yeah I think I think

[Music]

M good o

[Music]

time

[Music]

and the final

one and there we

go how many

like one two kind of like three with it

top One

[Music]

D and how this F

on

yeah the house car should probably move

[Music]

[Music]

forward

okay let's do the

[Music]

uh youing immediately

I could probably our L this

too if they're the same

am

now the same amount

I

[Music]

what wonder

[Music]

One

kind of like in the

selection

yes here you

go 279 275 let's

go find this is

10397 go

100 I'm tired today oh why are you

tired

51 what let's go with 50 25 5050 I can

this why are you

tight I here to talk to you if I if you

feel

like there's anything and I and I'm free

to

uh if there's anything you want uh

Wonder about I to talk

to to talk to you about

it I didn't get much sleep been thinking

about

stuff yeah I've been there's been a lot

of things going on

lightly and

[Music]

uh and maybe there's a few stuff we need

to talk

about

so you know so we

like understanding each

otherly

like understanding each other about

everything is in

[Music]

there and know I got to start

this

[Music]

there go now it's evenly spaced

[Music]

out

[Music]

[Music]

hey just a bunch of stuff that I blame

myself

for yeah if if this stuff I I think

about

but

I think I know what it is

about I don't think it should be so

worried about it now things things

things

have become

[Music]

[Music]

better it was it was really bad at

moment it's better now

[Music]

so

[Music]

[Music]

now okay where can I fit this

so let

me prepare

[Music]

it I I have a bit tired myself I haven't

really been able to sleep that

well yes I also been thinking about a

bunch of

stuff

so this will

be

clown Shan

name oh

[Music]

yeah

[Music]

now I went in

there

I can

delete no it's it's a bro I need to

delete because that's one's not going to

be

included but

the mo short sign possibly going to be

shown when you look at

now which I would imagine some people

I'm say this as Coco

clown what a

[Music]

clown and I should probably

save H that I need and start w c m n r

right

[Music]

there's I wonder

I

[Music]

n

[Music]

t

t

t

t

t

[Music]

[Music]

okay

and

[Music]

and

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

oh

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

well here's the Sleep Shop's

[Music]

[Music]

answer

[Music]

well here's the Sleep Chop's

answer

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

you

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

oh yeah so

[Music]

be so I was thinking maybe I should make

these um slightly

metallic like slightly

[Music]

shiny J with the star do you like the

star I said I want I want some daily

redeems people can

do that I would actually do

something oh

and I like the start of the show well

you're the start the

show

[Music]

so with this I should be able to update

yeah look at this this is what I

want if I do

that the pink pink on the inside here

should be a bit that's see

[Music]

that's

[Music]

[Music]

there should be what you did and

[Music]

then

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

and if I

don't like it I can always change it

back that

me I do

[Music]

that

[Music]

is

[Music]

a

minute 1 2 3 4 5

6 this 22 but is a bit uneven I

guess it's a bit short it

back

[Music]

thing

thisr I need to make it bigger

[Music]

top do cover

her I don't want that

she does need

her

me

[Music]

[Music]

clown and

then this one

too and the

B now baby PE there go that was

pinky

yay yeah I think I want

to no what this

one something like that maybe now it

start clipping through on it

now of course of course wouldn't be that

easy would

it okay um I I have an

idea we can any one just like last

time

oh one one more

room

thank uh

ni by the way can you turn on the button

from thing in plan I didn't even know

that was a

thing but

Pro no I can't I can't enable that

because I don't even know what it

is

blender Buton

prompt I

Le yeah I don't know you what it

is

how to display key pressed in blender

okay 1 minute 40 seconds plus adds

okay that's just going to add another 40

seconds

okay was just

one okay let's see what this

say yeah it's not a function in blending

so I cannot do

that well now that the first impression

said in the video well you need you need

I

will I

[Music]

[Music]

will it's an addon but I don't want but

then I have to install a bunch of I how

to do that

hello welcome today I'm making a sh

outfit so I'm going to take

[Music]

this and do um

intersect like

that

[Music]

like that I

[Music]

[Music]

think

okay this might be one

[Music]

I I hope things goes

well

I guess I can I

[Music]

mean

yeah

so uh I mean

[Music]

good

I guess I could see if I can add

it let's

see

here

go and then you have it

here

um

this

on

W

after

20

starts

well this is

good I hope it's to

uh

[Music]

no

[Music]

no

[Music]

I I hope it works

fine and that it is

readable

text it doesn't put the plus sign

between

[Music]

coms and something it doesn't if I click

on a menu

[Music]

option if I C here it

registers but if I enable this and then

click outside it does not register that

it does register that press that one but

it does not res this

one is so sometimes it doesn't show

[Music]

up that could cause some

confusion

[Music]

for

[Music]

[Music]

it's very slightly

different

okay I'm trying to see c't

[Music]

see

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

so what I need

[Music]

is

[Music]

just is to some

Buton so if I type it doesn't change

anything if I erase it it only see some

of

[Music]

these it does not res it that or that

but if I press why it's

[Music]

one

like such a weird ad

[Music]

[Music]

him

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

but it works

so I got a comment in

[Music]

the

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

B

[Music]

[Music]

all right

so

[Music]

at Le it shows up sometimes I mean if

[Music]

shows

[Music]

[Music]

a

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

you

[Music]

[Music]

around

almost corrected the

hene

now one go

left

[Music]

there

go the old one only need the new

one this

is let's call

band

[Music]

and

there this part I

[Music]

need

[Music]

so

[Music]

here SC has a nice color yeah I think

he's

[Music]

nice

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

nice y

corner just like the CH

emot there

go

[Music]

perfect

[Music]

the next thing

is TA of course no again it's

[Music]

just

we'll see what I can do about that I

have some

[Music]

ideas

I think this is enough for this

cing I could add like a like like this

[Music]

and a pink ass strip across this part I

will I'm also thinking if I should add

something to the bottom of this

character which CH this is

enough

[Music]

uh

because the chil the school girl it has

this D set

F and which I find

[Music]

nice and it should have Somey

see and I fix this I think that's the

yeah still

but as it Clips through so what I can do

is just delete the upper part of

the you can only see more more lower

part think that in that that I would

fixed

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

it

but I think I'm happy with this

[Music]

otherwise

this look that expected

[Music]

to

[Music]

know see this part

anyway that's me am I me being

I been we the Sportsman for too

long an hour

now it's

fine nice actually it was worse Wai for

an

hour

these ARS have very

low activity which is

[Music]

f

[Music]

I think this works and then I just

remove the top part of the voice Stu go

into the

C I think this

part I wish it some more looks like

a the cupcake

yep

[Music]

what's uh chill outfit if not uh Pap

on

to

[Music]

l

[Music]

so it looks fine from below and now the

short is clipster here

anymore but the P

do oh

no but no worries everybody doesn't need

di below part

[Music]

anyway this part of body doesn't exist

is way way because that makes sense

[Music]

um

[Music]

see if makes

sense

oh w

[Music]

w yeah something like that all let's

start with this

thing

there you

go now have body or body shs AR clipping

through the SC

[Music]

perfect

yep she she she wears a scar like a

cupcake because pon pon is like a

cupcake it makes

sense this makes perfect

sense

and then I will copy

the loading

loading time now there

go I'm copy the animation

information

from this

[Music]

C

it's going to

be okay and then and then my usual

tricks which

means because it say values to every

single right groups but there's only

some of them actually prob most of those

are empty but they still exist in this

list for some reason don't get why don't

get why so

CLE and

owns and then more ice

because

there we go now the scch should be

animed I can do like

a wait a minute why is this part not oh

because I did the

intersecting why does that bre

it everything else is except that one

that's interesting let do something

about

that

it's weird

d and for some reason I can remember it

but it is kind of

[Music]

weird

when it's

clean not all

go now I'm back to doing the post there

we

[Music]

go that looks normal

as normal as P

SW being animated as

Coco Pon is just acting as

[Music]

Coco so good thing that

works

[Music]

what I will

[Music]

[Music]

do

is that I

[Music]

will right this

okay so what I will do is I

will because I

have

here

okay she's not going to hold the pom

poms that's just not going to

work but I will try to do this kind of

top shes

here so I will look

at

some reference images

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

okay

I

[Music]

I

[Music]

think somebody

[Music]

I so

[Music]

I will

take this part

[Music]

guess I would take as much as

[Music]

I

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

it looks on there but I can't make it

look maybe

[Music]

[Music]

can't

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

yeah I don't know what I'm

[Music]

doing more Ultra maget map I know that's

not what stands from being well this is

just the mesh itself think actually not

even the

UN so you're wrong

[Music]

regardless I yeah it was I was seeing

like black and through

I can understand

the

[Music]

[Music]

confusion

can I do now

intersect

no oh nice I've seen

[Music]

him

[Music]

[Music]

okay there you go that's

more I love a bunch of

this

so I do want

the I probably do the upper part of the

her top to be

[Music]

like

wait where's

[Music]

[Music]

that anyway so yeah I want her top to

be not like tight to her body I want the

bottom of it to I guess flare out if

that's great

turn

[Music]

let see if I

can make something work

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

some

[Music]

tic scps to it just as piece the wrong

one

function I do get I have sometimes got

got one two followers after raid

depending on where the raid is but if

someone do the exclamation point s so

which is us the one with bot which a lot

of people have which they usually

include a link H I rarely get a follow

from

that so the twitch twitch command

is the one

preferred if if you want if if you want

people to actually follow the

training I do

both but

anyway as I was curious of course you

don't have to answer if you don't feel

like doing that I was just curious what

the what what your stream was about what

the chat what your

chatting yes I'm I'm

curious It's sced happy like it but yeah

I was going to look into what those gaps

were I don't

why oh yeah there's H cuz there's no

I that's hard much cuz there's no gaps

here show catch

up I just catching up and

playing and dead by daylight is the name

right I didn't stream for a bit cuz I

had surgery been oh right I

think you mentioned something about I

can't

remember my memory so

bad but than you mention something

but I hope it went went

well and

that's that everything went well with

that and that's you're recovering

quickly so if I go into this mode I

might be able to see what's going on

here these two are different from so

it's the

is yeah I think I think these are just

incorrectly placed

here and this should just be

closed yes these are the same

points

okay

yeah so this one should have been moved

down and then I'm going to I'll just

close it like that averaging after the

point I think that's

F there you

go so I just need to so so so now that I

fixed that I don't have to worry about

that so let's

do top or shirt what they call

P what that Chang the

[Music]

sign and I

got

[Music]

so I probably will have to oh no that's

that's going to make this stream not

feel so

great but

yeah I hope everyone has

a good time

here

it it's quite a slow stream

today not not Soo

active well anyone who wants a bit more

activity is free to chat I'm open to

talk I like talking to

people about all kinds of different

stuff I talk about random stuff oh there

we go hope you have a good time here

I'm

trying I have

a consum my

own travel gu you could

say so if I put make that

yellow and save

this the same dialog does not show up on

scen can't do much about that but you

can see my C around and then then I go

back here and then refresh this

one there you go now it shows

up I could have like a strapl left toop

but now it's I want it to look like the

one on the

emot I was out most the days at the mall

so aart

of I'm pretty tired I have to do no it's

fine it's

fine it's fine I I

understand and no

I no one needs to be sorry about being

quiet if you don't if you don't feel

like or if you're tired or if you need

to go if you want to leave anything I I

respect any

choiceone no one has any obligation to

be here I'm I'm course happy if

you so I'm not just here alone

but

never be sorry if if you're busy or just

need a rest or

anything I can't

can't ask for

more you you're so you're so nice for

raing is one I would like for now unless

someone says they like C and Pepsi I

don't worry about that because I like

Pepsi more than

C and for Cola like drinks I think Pepsi

is my favorite I would still prefer to

buy the what which is called E EA here

but and their own brand because for The

Taste compared to the price is the one I

prefer but P Pepsi is still I think the

one I think tast best there some Rand

coration

then I will come back and fight so far

you don't have to fight

anyone yeah cocaa

has which I assume which I think I

understood when it comes to the term

Coke I never got that because

[Music]

it's I never I never got why people call

Coca-Cola Coke because Coke is not even

part of the Coca Cola name

but what about the the I know I think I

like I think I had like ones or

something I can't remember

things so how do I want to do this sh I

going try

to yeah let let let me try instead of

doing texture paint because that kills

the

stream for some

reason I will do

uh it doesn't kill the stream but it

make the stream lag a lot how much I

lost so far eight frames dropped much

better than PR I like

thousand because I'm from Texas and our

Dr Pepper

is

I it's all

soda i h s by mistake ah that makes

[Music]

sense I think I had the peer

once yeah when comes to favorite it's

important

to consider the price as well if someone

else buy for me and they really don't

have problem with paying for it why I

can't take

Pepsi you know like if my parents is a

[Music]

pain

kind I just like

soda he usually when go to the store and

grow

whichever takes my fence in that moment

yeah that that would too if you don't

have any special reference

any that that makes it

easy so I'm trying to figure out how I

want to make

the cuz it should be like v-shaped

should I try to draw and see how much

it's how much Start

Ling I'm not much of a soda

person so that

person I think I think most of us are

more like water

people 70%

water I shouldn't drink as much as I

think need I I I went to a whole a long

PA of

drinking crazy

amounts I'm glad I'm over

that cuz as soon as I draw it's going to

kill

everything I'm scared I can end the mode

but but as soon as draw I think it's the

L here's me who stres to drink water I I

had trouble drinking

water that's also MLP what what what do

you mean by MLP am I Little Pony I have

to drink

water it's good that you're

taking I I have such a

trou drinking

water

I I'm

scared okay let's see how it

goes one that wasn't to man I forgot

mirror mode I've got to draw the correct

texture actually for some reason doesn't

like at all man that's

interesting interesting and no frames

dropped okay maybe I can draw fine now I

no idea what it has why it has such

strugles

before that's that's

interesting that's very

interesting

so I will I will just add a reference

picture

and

emotes this will

be sheer

large that's very cre

knife and let's add it

here add

in there we go add image

reference we go into I have a folder for

everything related to my

streaming but not everything chair LOD

there you go there it

is that's the kind of top I want to

make

po to check oh my hydrate is out you

know what I would like to fill it with

some cold

water speaking of drinking and water and

I will be back in a very short

moment as will play in like 20 minutes

so let me just play some ads and then I

will be

back

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

so back but the ads are still playing

for another minute so everyone who still

has ads are not able to hear me so this

this is some secret time with pon pon of

course you can't prank anything secret

because everyone can read the chat but

everything I'm

saying you can't hear

ooh yeah so the potential people who

have ads are Egg and

musi I don't know if they

ads because some have um the turbo and

and I can't see

that it would be nice if I could see

which on I

have but I could understand that could

be an issue Harris does not have ads I

know

that uh hope P said that thing oh har

add over see it's okay that confirms egg

welcome back egg it's does still say

that some people might

but whatever whatever hello egg I will

do your hydrate now and I sitting up

straight now I got a head off and start

friend D oh thank you staying for that

still I do appreciate that even if you

me I'm very

little I do apprciate I appreciate that

you came by came with the r and also

made a great message so it's fun sip sip

oh I wish I had a strawberry juice

whatever that

is it's just water just some tap

water I do like the tap I don't like the

taste of tap water but I do like this

tap water more than the tap water or

that's

was back in at my pets I don't know why

it's such a difference or might like to

have more more now than before anyo

stream thank you I will do my best I'll

try to see if I can make

this and have a good good DND

[Music]

[Music]

session

[Music]

I'm falling over no what do you mean

[Music]

stop

[Music]

[Music]

I want p p water wait wait you don't

want p p bath

water I feel I don't see how I feel

about

this I thought you wanted special p p b

water

how far down should this go like where

does it breast starts

anyway I I think that's

[Music]

fine cuz this this is one which more

like flat across here because that's

that's a close should work across

breasts they don't like they aren't like

vacuum sealed to the body

creting perfect outline of the breasts

that doesn't make sense but that's sure

is how people like to read the model

breast I mean I'm no breast expert I

mean considering my lack of

breath but I want find it weird

looking

okay this doesn't work OB this is the

way whoop there you

go on the back side I and imagine me

like high up I guess but I could make it

low if you like to show a bit of this

part I'll take both but can't drink bath

water and and with tap water out I can

drink it from your M instead of the tap

o I mean I can't have you drink the tap

water from my

mouth like if I send you the tap water

you

know and I would probably not sell boss

water that would probably not look good

for

me although even though all the

criticism regarding the backw water sale

I know happened was more towards the

people who bought it more than the

person selling

it

so I'm actually surprised how well it's

drawing this time I'm not sure why okay

so this is like the first draft I think

and should like go around the

arm is this working or do would you like

to see I change this I guess green and

white isn't the easiest to see but

that's very true well sounds like you

have to come by and visit me

someday is this shaking it or should I

change

[Music]

it and someone wanted this text up here

and see what

that why does it every so every click I

does you can hear the clicks now wait

before it was double

clicking right now this

one that's

weird I went up twice

before come on that was weird but there

we go there did again is only if I click

quickly okay let's

see

yeah sometimes it's just skipping a

number oh I forg it w

100 but I haven't I haven't M like 100

times because sometimes skip the number

another reason why I haven't have

to okay so you need to meet meet so you

wait what's all are all all the reasons

you want

to see me you want to hug me you want to

fet my head you want

to I don't

know choose what outfit I should for her

technically you could do that without

see

me to to drink tap water from my mouth

that's

oh

can't spill all the secrets but but I'm

curious I need to

[Music]

know if you were to get to choose what

outfit I was I was wearing maybe that

should

be maybe that should be part of the pon

pon he can choose what outfit I should

wear just like you can do on

[Music]

stream taking

notes

when and on Tuesday

what what time is it I'm checking the

stream to check the time it's

16:44 h it's on Tuesday which I have

added to my twitch schedule I have not

added the server

schedule I should do

that

um which will

happen

uh so it would be at 19 my

time on

Tuesday

on T yes and that would be

when I wish it could show me

like

this one says every time Z it only

contains some up to Time

s I'm that

serious

okay so

it's oh could could come

oh why these pon pon outfit stay

currently I'm actually wearing a p dress

and it's like I think you call it ple it

got this folds in

it and it's it's very light it has a

very it has more like a rough outside I

guess you can see but a very smooth

inside very

nice silk I don't think it's silk but

like basically silk

SM it's very nice I I like I like

wearing nice

[Music]

toar it sounds cute I I do find it like

it I like

it which I've said a few times

now but now pon pon is wear s

it obviously would be a terrible idea

but I had a silly idea of that I would

change my own outfit in real life to

much out but no one see sees what I'm

wearing anyway

[Music]

so so it doesn't really matter

that was my was stupid

idea imagination is

powerful I guess I could show you what

the well I did show one picture of me

wearing the the other

dress gu show what I look like wearing

this

dress I just still wonder if this I made

this making these straps too

white maybe that's

[Music]

fine how much is stream like nothing I'm

not sure why when I did the drawing last

time it was lagging horribly but now

it's

fine it's

[Music]

strange

very

strange wa I hope hope this works you

got like this back

this

front I should want to

add where the pink outside should

be but of course it needs to be

consistent

distance and that's that would be a bit

tricky to

do and now that I do this maybe the

waste of the straps are find it

offro

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

so

oh

yeah definitely not consistent with here

of the pink

are

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

when

even if you don't feel too comfortable

joining my server you could always add

me on this

and talk to

me I know

just I mean it sound kind of fun to

J

[Music]

it shouldn't be too tricky to find me on

this since I have the same username as

[Music]

here and now that was included on the V

now everyone who watches the V which is

basically no one going to add me on this

not that popular yet so I don't have a

load yeah I don't have many friend

request barely

any it's no

problem not yet at

least

so that's that let's see if I can add

the

pink

[Music]

[Music]

bunny is it f oh

they have me turn

on I I

can doesn't matter

[Music]

much I do wish I could enable local

mirror mirror this area

only it's

fine a stretch

that

[Music]

then yeah this is fine

let's save this as

the

top

same

um what have

I

there yeah now it's back never

mind just now I

can't focus on making

the

[Music]

picture

point

point we can have all kinds of cute

t we can talk about outfits but pon pon

[Music]

okay so let's open this

one so yeah yes

[Music]

myself

yes going

[Music]

on

oh I'm

see I'm seeing it's just this part of

[Music]

see I'm so

sing sorry I'm not even switch

here don't even know what I'm talking

about that just adds to my

silliness

[Music]

so anyway

let's follow these lines first I will

add you got the

star you know what that

means

I say as if you know what that

means well so

me congratulations you win

nothing you get nothing you

lose good thing

s yeah I

just I just added the stuff and

nothing it is nothing it means nothing

you get nothing it is it's just a just a

random

R but the idea which I you might not

know about my

idea I want to be

able to do uh that people should be able

to no

then do a daily

redeem

[Music]

and the daily redeem is something that

you

should some item or something that is

given to you in text point of course

sadly you're not going to get that real

life item I'm

sorry

yeah but I don't know I she doing this

[Music]

again

[Music]

anyway so anyway was I was going to say

before I got distracted by this

winess what start

this now it's still

not

think I know what's doing this

but it's because of this

[Music]

thing right now it's perfectly

fine yeah

[Music]

everyone is allowed to make the daily

redeem after you make the daily redeem

you are the B is going to tell

you you have redeemed this thing you are

given this

item and that's basically

it and it's going to randomize which

item you

got and then it will count how many

items you got in

total

[Music]

are you one of the

itms well I

mean I me H pom

FLH has like a special rare item could

work but I said you not getting these

items in my life sorry about

that but I was trying to think of which

items

that you going to be

[Music]

rewarded but um I have one idea what I'm

not

sure so it's probably going to be like

common items R

[Music]

items

[Music]

Bas based on how like a bunny streamer

has you collect bunnies every day

another streamer has and it count the to

of bunnies you have another streamer has

[Music]

you like you might know about AA

it has to redeem uh flower every day and

counts how many you have

redeemed things like

[Music]

that and then there are streamers who

have

a those redeems that actually don't

count how many you

get

[Music]

there's one stream that has like a

random Bean in

[Music]

it it give it gives a random name of a

bean but it doesn't count how many you

have and

S of course you know about l who has the

random R random is it's not random it's

just the same every time the the will

tweet

so this is not with the pink outline yet

but

hopefully

this will look

fine on the M let's

check and update there we go look at

this it's kind of it's yellow against

white

so I guess not EAS to see but this work

right

and then you got the bottom which I want

connect this

to and then there's some clipping issue

there

[Music]

but

[Music]

see

oops

right let's me

see

no it probably need to

be looking good wrong hum

I

mean oops I

mean maybe maybe you should have Leck

every outfit of P Pon clean by licking

licking the

bit too too

[Music]

much I find me saying

as find me stating What I Hear in

correct is very

you mean it's

fun that's a good

question or or if it's like another

another outfit pon pon could have that

has such a

feature h i mean the triangle bikini has

showing off her breast a lot so there's

that

and all all needs to be shorter a

shorter skirt shorter top

po window yeah what bunny where's your

POA

window where's where's that redeemed to

have your outfit

changed oh what B found the star

congratulations now you get some

attention what I mean I have

my oh oh yeah yeah you need to tell me

when when starting stream H so I can

show

[Music]

up I it after or before I end my

stream I me I don't have a fix time when

I end the Stream

So or my like more what time would it be

my time which would be

easiest in like two 2 and a half hours

okay in that case

um that would be my when I ended uh

yesterday so

maybe what if I end it I end my stream

as you start your stream like plan it

out like

that so should I have like

a pink

bottom

some of the reference art has that so

may maybe I should have that that sounds

like a good

idea like iside even if you like no

pressure If you make it it's okay I

don't want you to change your PL I

didn't even have plans in the first

place

can't change any plans I don't

have

yep

let that

first

whoops

there I one need to let me change the

let me change this as if I'm asking you

for

permission and then and then yeah says

no we're not going to let you change

that you have to have it

as my you need to have it as you made it

so

far no changes allowed

okay I can make the bottom a bit pink I

might go get some ice cream o can you

share some with me you want a scoop yes

the sh looks like eyes and teeth why

does

it oh I mean ice

fear I can see what you

mean

okay I'll bring you back a i yeah that's

that's what so we going to have pon pon

meet up someday we we invite water Bunny

and

hares and who else would like to come or

is able to

come be right back yeah you're getting

your your ice

[Music]

cream I don't forget to give me

[Music]

some give me

[Music]

[Music]

some I think I'll

doal height

means that

so I'll do

that and

that this is map is incorrect

right now I made the bottom pink

tops and

bottoms that means if I go back to

blender and update this look now it's

pink but it does make me feel like I

should I should make it shorter I make a

copy of this so this will be short

long and this will be

the short

[Music]

shirt so I'm going remove the bottom

bottom

row in that

case I do need to make this

[Music]

one

[Music]

flat so let me just

quickly

change

this and save it so I don't have to

switch views backing for it saves me

some I wish I really should set up a

shortcut for

that uh no update no yeah I think I

think this works I think this is a good

length of

the this one should probably prob will

be a bit

short you are

back nice welcome

[Music]

[Music]

back

oh and now it tells me about the up

coming an it's so bad at doing that okay

wa shorty yeah that's good that's

good I seen the pink line the top isn't

shorty I only made it short enough I

think

so with this I should

uh

[Music]

prepare

some I Rize all of

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

these

that's not good

oh yeah I know how to F

[Music]

this oh put an outline on

[Music]

and put it on

[Music]

both and now I can

delete there we

[Music]

go

[Music]

I could delete that of

[Music]

this and

then what I do

here

[Music]

It's

s there that's how I

did behind p p but it's

okay

it is

[Music]

[Music]

okay these I'm going to use for

things like

here so have

[Music]

shirt any

shies not

here

I guess there's no difference

[Music]

there the metal one e

still so the pink one we have

SL

met a nice shim I need

[Music]

I and

here I want

[Music]

add this to make it appear PL

[Music]

so the shirt is not furry next

[Music]

man I'm finally

[Music]

here pink part

[Music]



there we

go now if I go back here you can see

it's furry but I can update this

so now it's not

furry now the reflective stuff should

good there we

go the pink is just slight not that

much

white p in Black

for black

for pon pon in a first seat how about

[Music]

that

[Music]

and that would have same so you don't

think a full first suit is not the same

as a nice

I turn that sh off the

[Music]

hips maybe you're right okay I should do

the P print

here what

[Music]

here so I'll take

[Music]

the buet print from

[Music]

here that's

that

[Music]

maybe imagine if I had a f l turn that

actually sounds kind of

[Music]

exciting

let's see if I

can actually enlarge

this with the power

of

AI we probably not going to look

good but let's try

[Music]

it I might need to

[Music]

and not it's

F let's call this

one on

[Music]

PR and

then which she not showing up on

[Music]

[Music]

stream

enhancing just C the

a invent info

[Music]

[Music]

stream

[Music]

one okay now let's bring it in here and

see how it looks after upscale 16 times

the width and height I mean it's not I

mean from from this pixelated thing to

this thing I mean it looks bad cuz it's

because I kind of left some artifacts

here on the

sides I actually try to make some

something out of those but doesn't

matter very wly but that's doesn't

matter doesn't

matter I we just use it as a reference

[Music]

anyway so like it's not doing a good job

I but is doing good

enough I have actually been playing oops

now can't see around with artist AI par

system I think like combining an artist

and AI could be a interesting

thing I use an a to

get ideas and then you

then you as an artist

actually finish down

here make it a proper

SC of course the problem with AI the AI

M that is currently is that they

basically just taking taking everyone's

artworks without asking

first and then they're doing a backwards

system where they basically if you don't

want your artwork included you have to

go to them and tell them that they can't

use it

they act first I was going to act first

ask L but even asking in the first place

they're giving you the

option

so idea again want to have the artist

take art company who feed their own art

into a and then take the out yeah that

would fix the issue I just mentioned

because in in that case you have all the

permissions because you're using your

own art also the artist put all the

exit but you don't need to own the AI

but you own the uh the

uh memory of

it I was like yeah that's kind of how a

lot of buus works too and like I I would

because if you are a furry which I guess

I am

and one of the burus that is very

convenient use is

e61 and it also follows the

uh ACT first and don't even ask it it

does the same thing as the AI I see

us and

uh they are hosting other people's art

and just let me double check one thing

to be sure I don't say

[Music]

ining okay actually doesn't show up is

that oh yeah yeah yeah it does show up

and they also have ads on their

website so they are earning money from

people seeing the ads of content they

haven't even asked the permission to

have I'm there in the first place

so

does a lot of BS

work

uh but they would own the yeah yeah I

mean they did the train result they they

own

that I do find e61 to be a very useful

website and I will admit I have used the

website to find references because the

uh because I can just go to that website

in this case I want to look for sh

leaders I can just search for sh leader

and I can find the

art because if I go went to go to De D

start Che which I can do when people do

tag but I can't be as specified like I I

wanted to find like a a Shad there with

the kind of pled skirt and a short top

which I'm designing for p Pon and I can

find Art

I can't be that spec specific

on and that's what I don't like about

easy one problem is of course the lack

of

permission it say such a well well known

website at this point

so I wouldn't say they're really causing

much issue at this

time I don't remember if they were the

website or it was another website that's

went with the

uh rule that if someone had published

some digital media that they because

they have the rule at moment

that if you have to pay to see the art

you are not allowed to repost it on e61

which is perfectly understandable but

had but before I don't remember if they

had the rule that if it was like a

5ye grace period or

something if if you require people to

pay for it but after 5 years they're

going to host it on their website which

is not

okay but I think they changed that but I

don't know they one

that

they H went with the

[Music]

same same yeah that's not going to to

it

is so there's the bunny print and I

hopefully this

cute effect on it makes it look fine on

the

outfit

let's do the color

and oh I forgot I have chity visible

Okay so

um it's not exactly how

good and I forgot to hide the

reference I can adjust this by adjusting

this part

here it's kind it's almost

good so close to being

good

so close to being like

you thank thank you

[Music]

are you saying that I'm

good I'm trying to make it I fail

sometimes but I'm doing my

best okay so what I will do is I will

separate the

E from the rest of the

body I like this song

I have to head out have a good s fun yes

hey thank you for being here it just

been fun chatting with you have a good

day and I wish you the

best

[Music]

and they will play

ad good time to leave there we go

there's

[Music]

ads so I will try try

[Music]

to

lower size of this ear like

this actually I hav another

any I going copy this and make it a

smart object first thing is this still

Vector

Arch oh no it rest rest

it

but there still Vector in here what I

need to do is enlarge this

one it's 8 *

8

now it's good and then back

out and it's huge now

but so let's reduce it to 12.5

was the original

science and then I do

that don't

like

oh

yeah I think what I need to

do is try to balance out

the I Tred to balance it so much I can

on

picture so it looks fine here this is

what it looks like now but I probably

will have to adjust

the I probably have to adjust the

texturing

here

[Music]

so it's more even like

[Music]

this

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

yeah it's going it's not going to be

perfect

[Music]

but and also Shing

to

like

this

like I need to find another

solution hey that looks

fine

[Music]

okay I think that's that's

good so let me take a quick look

[Music]

at

[Music]

[Music]

if you do have

looker

[Music]

[Music]

w

[Music]

[Music]

sh

come

[Music]

yeah

[Music]

me what you think

that and then I want

to

[Music]

[Music]

I wonder if the pink should

have doesn't have anything

there that's not iing on it

[Music]

give

me I wonder if this should

be

strong

[Music]

[Music]

let's try with strong my

[Music]

think is that going to be a

difference

down

here

itops a be

dark like that

[Music]

[Music]

so

and it's going to be there we

go is a bit more

shiny shiny

PR so what else yeah should do

[Music]

[Music]

do

let's do a height map of this

shirt I have some ideas of how I want to

do

[Music]

that

I'm going to use7 as the

base wait now

see and then

for the

[Music]

yellow and it's slightly

higher that's

[Music]

maybe not because the difference in

height is

[Music]

[Music]

small

cuz what I then

want is

[Music]

the of the

shirt

which should be

[Music]

here

no just

uned I need I need

[Music]

to and tort G

map

this

[Music]

okay let's open the new map since it's

been fly exported

now just take a little bit of time for

to

do that's a new

[Music]

one

[Music]

and now I can follow it

properly this

steps

[Music]

there go this one

scene I want other

[Music]

one

[Music]

then one seems to be going

see

and annoy seem on these

two do that

[Music]

easy

one

[Music]

this it's going to do

[Music]

it

so come

on so what I'm going to

do

pressing WR buttons that's

fine

[Music]

there we

go and then I want this to be in the

midle

and being

one cuz this

now

position

there

go I don't need everything else

here just this

br

turn not

it and that

anym what I could

do is it supp to to

track

then

this only makes sense if

i s this

[Music]

much okay I May these

[Music]

works okay

so yeah I think this is good

enough let's save

this and then open Smart Das page. net

Mark normal one that's the

website and open this

picture this isn't show

stream it

show or save this n

map and copy

it this is high map I need

that but do need this m

okay let's con convert this nor LA

[Music]

to If someone knows how I can set up a

script that does this aut automatically

for me I would love that so me so much

time

of course no one sees what I'm doing

with these popups don't you want them on

stre

S cuz what I'm doing is I'm

creating SP of red green and blue

chanels so I can then set these

to

subtract

add and Le

50 guys what what it's doing

[Music]

now cuz it should combine this with the

fur texture here I think this is the

most easiest to

see so it go like light and dark there

and then meres

together because if I just did

the deleting outside

here it's like a sharp edge here it's

very hard to see so probably not going

to be that easy to see in game anyway

but I put a bit of extra care in

it like if you look here really really

careful you might see some yeah in that

case you're probably not going to see it

in game anyway but you

me so it's

very and apply this

boom I got like

seams

this is like a print that's on top of

it course the effect is a bit

[Music]

[Music]

strong let

me

there go g with that this effect is a

bit strong I think that's

fine maybe it

just so let

me go back here and reduce the SP

of by

[Music]

adjusting right of

[Music]

this as the effect of this thing was a

bit strong as

[Music]

well

[Music]

with the effect

reduced but still keeping the strong

effect from the one

day because I still want

[Music]

the I still want there to be a visible

Edge from where the B the transitions to

the

[Music]

clothing

[Music]

[Music]

for

[Music]

[Music]

oh same thing

again m is a way to create

reset adjustment

l

I should look into

that

this should be

softer

Shar

[Music]

something oh yeah I know why look

[Music]

Shar there we

go

before after see yeah now it's

these things are softer but Edge to the

body is not

softer first that one I want strong so

this the

Ed like the they so it looks like the

clothing is on top of the body not like

painted onto the

body now oh yeah that's wrong that's

upate up there we

go that's

better I like

that pretty

good I must

[Music]

say

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

hang

[Music]

[Music]

it

okay now

see thank look C shirt this one I should

make

[Music]

like

and that might be SL too much let

me

let me jump back over this and see if I

[Music]

can

[Music]

me can REM those all

[Music]

[Music]

right

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

there you

go

[Music]

no

Chan need the pom

[Music]

pom

[Music]

I

[Music]

see

[Music]

[Music]

why

[Music]

[Music]

where

[Music]

what

[Music]

now looks like a very short up

but this is just a

reference or this

one a

mess okay let's see this is

pupp pupp

[Music]

I from the

B

[Music]

no

just call this back

up X Happ

just okay now

wait

clean wait

normalizing

[Music]

let's go this copy up

sign

clean bir this

time

[Music]

[Music]

I think that's

that

[Music]

[Music]

it would be neat if I can make the sh a

bit more like

the I don't have anything

tight so

[Music]

I think that's

[Music]

that so in one and a half hours what I

should be start streaming so I will I I

feel like I'm done with

this I said I don't feel a need to add

pom poms because she going to hold the

stuff like she can't really hold them

stuff

[Music]

floating Som have with that that so I

publish these on my Discord

server

put the link there for any one

[Music]

curious tail goes through the skir but

it's fine the tail is doing a bit what

whatever he wants so that there you go

that one now maybe I should check now

seems like a

got oh yeah yeah yeah there one more

thing I wanted to sh so the SP is based

on this outfit this but there is one

design I would like to

do leave it like

this yeah because I actually don't know

how I would cor so maybe I should

just so I'll go back in work a bit more

on this

one cuz what I'm doing on this

one is the

body so maybe I should enable our

[Music]

multi let's say it look look like 4 and

a half hours that's pretty good for

whole

out see I'm working on

[Music]

[Music]

this we go or I should copy over the

[Music]

the black suit from the

[Music]

[Music]

other but I will

this

one or rather this

one as far I can see the patter legs are

the same this time and then think that

was the case for other one so I one I

had

to they like

[Music]

separate it also got FS like that and I

wonder if I

should that maybe

do got

this s like different people has made

[Music]

[Music]

this cuz this actually C like this line

sign which makes

sense like

this

I don't know how it shows up here yeah

should show it's a bit fine chat but as

long as no one's right no one's right so

it's

[Music]

right and what the for star set of

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

texes

[Music]

yeah here we

go yes

exactly

[Music]

different but for now I just need a

suit

and by su I mean part what did I call

[Music]

here anything

sound

see okay that part doesn't show up the

stream

anyway

copying please wait there we

go use this because this more LS are

move is not the case

anymore Don need

this

anything we have

it have

[Music]

what's the

connect I see

[Music]

[Music]

see

yeah I don't think defeat has any

patterns on

them

anytime now please export the

T

oh sure oh

no just going say this a really long

time this

time

talking mus at

this

[Music]

second

I'm sure the computer's working hard

but I was hoping the computer would at

least survive

on that's bnny start

streaming let's

[Music]

see

someone special somebody

[Music]

bu

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

h

yeah

[Music]

[Music]

I look this chat

message

[Music]

I'll be chatting it the

but

I you wonder what everyone is

up it does vary a lot in the amount of

activity on

stream sometimes there's a lot of

activity in sometimes very

Qui

I am however I'll be jealous of the

streamers

you do manage to have more

regular viewers that I show

up when I when I visit the stream and I

just always I see the same people

[Music]

[Music]

there

[Music]

I that I get

it they are pretty good streamers

so I understand

[Music]

it

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

s Happ

[Music]

baby

[Music]

oh I don't have one

gravity let's say create uh Coco

[Music]

gravity

15 that means I don't need to use this

one

anymore

there the face

shift

yeah let me have these instead of course

we still

have that from those

but I'll get that

later what important

[Music]

are

this stuff so maybe I

[Music]

should

bik so let me fix

those

by checking what the PO and stuff should

be on

the this aiting

[Music]

[Music]

actually first defition should be count

e

down complet

black something like there this it base

[Music]

B that's not

going

nothing let me go

FC I want Coco looks like

this let me

[Music]

that want

CH or

Nick

there should be this part

[Music]

[Music]

this is completely black why need do

completely black for

uh F shift is f shift completely

[Music]

black the friend shift

is

actually

okay

okay

[Music]

he

rtion of

[Music]

48

so this is the shade it should have then

this question this

[Music]

[Music]

part

[Music]

[Music]

you

[Music]

[Music]

it's nice ni0 let's

get

[Music]

was the

FC me

this and

green

F

again then we have

M this one is not metallic at all the

other one was interesting short

[Music]

nor M that's not going to be

[Music]

anything and

roughness

now let's save this I

can

gravity

[Music]

gness I don't guessing much just didn't

have it

does need to remove the effect

[Music]

all

M looks nothing I don't I

really I think I have one

this

[Music]

yes picture of the metal which is a

lower resolution CU it doesn't have

anything

on that makes the file size smaller

[Music]

so CV M non

color CV

r on color and finally gravity

in

there you

go I just need to make sure these things

appear

correctly by adjusting them

here

[Music]

so what I can see here is that it is

[Music]

um around is slightly on the lumpy

[Music]

side

he

I don't know if that

comes but I can help you oh no it's

working don't

[Music]

now

this

[Music]

better let's see yeah definitely live

better

[Music]

[Music]

now it appears a bit round there it's

bit a bit pointy now missing off

to we go now it's a bit

Rish well I don't like how it's side

like that not sure

how here it is going

[Music]

straight I do understand

that the lower part makes less pixels

than the upper part so it's so when you

make it I make a straight line on the

texture it appears to be larger the B

I show it steps like

that

[Music]

yeah

[Music]

[Music]

yeah wish I

could yeah that's

better save it I have it sure

immedately oh well

[Music]

so when I look at

this the top one is a bit too stretch

[Music]

out

[Music]

and the line is too wide at

top yeah there we

go so two

white

and that's test process

but this one is a bit too wi

one press

CL um

he yeah that's b

b this one is a bit stretched out

too

making sure it appears round and

larer a small

side

this one is very checky

appar there you go that's

[Music]

more this

is

[Music]

[Music]

more that's a very lumpy

do

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

well speci with this

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

in this and po

messages for last one and a half

hours and now know

here

[Music]

was someone said that they were going to

be here the whole stream but they

haven't bar Liv in

here

and I think they went and did something

I don't think they should have

done which is the reason why they

here something that made me a bit

disappointed I not

because I told them not to not to die

decid for station should two or not to

but they said that they willn't do

it then they went do

again

[Music]

this one is almost too

[Music]

morning there we

go and then there's

this there's almost perfect I

need like

balancing there you go I think that's

[Music]

good

of experimentation we going to have fun

I will still read chat so I'm not

actually going to be blind for in in

real life there such a

disappointment

but I should like have blindfold P or

something the p is looking from

screen

oh this is a start ads message in AOW

stretching I never added a

stretching posture and

stretching
