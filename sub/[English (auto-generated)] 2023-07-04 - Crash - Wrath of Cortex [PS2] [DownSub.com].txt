and let's see
let's
continue with the time chance
and last time I was trying him
[Music]
G
get killed here because I'm six cents
seconds from getting gapped
I was
I was struggling so hard last time so
I had to quit
now
after a night City and
upper a nice breakfast
I thought she's been able to do this
please
okay so let me guess last one and
okay that was just the warm-up now let's
see
if I can do it for real
oh I didn't follow but it was a waste of
time
and then I missed those and uh okay
kind of messed up then got out of the
piece I lost my focus
no I keep doing that sometimes
truck is kinda off to the sides
it does make me wish
I did that except ions
make me wish you
stitched in detention as an option
before you start level
foreign
as I've seen some players
forgetting to pick up the clock when I
get off the turnt around
it's outside of oh nice
and a nice avoid it but I should contact
him
avoidance of potassium too and then uh I
got stuck it's just some sometimes you
can have full speed you can easily turn
but if you hit the wall
and you lose your momentum
and that
certainly makes sense in the direction
going
but you still lose your momentum in all
the directions
see him going to the side
even though you weren't going in that
direction originally that direction is
also going slowly
all right
you could try to pick up anything and
now oh yeah I completely lost control
over that then I kind of lost the sticky
I didn't take control of my life anymore
all right keep up that one
I found this jumped over there that one
okay
okay
he tested
and shoots
across and then he's he
entered the one extra in the middle and
it's that one I softly get hit by
that one one single strange shot
it's the one I managed to get goodbye
multiple times it's not the first time
sorry about that pain nothing away
uh
I tried to slow down I would have made
it
if I just went a bit slower
but this time I feel like it's going
great
this time I will do it
it's so far
it's that one but that's fine that's
fine
foreign
no
Perfect Landing left one
against noises
distracting me
a few hours
all right I'm getting distract you the
moment give me a moment
and the destruction is over
something back get back to the game
that's kissing
not such a loud noise I'm saying that
was sudden
not that I normally care but
it was distracting
the flower goes well
she ain't left like a demon
episode
ah I guess that ah
that works too
yes yes
that's how I like it that's not how I
like it though
why is it probably important two seconds
getting here two seconds
okay
nope
thank you John that could have been the
run I wanted but
all right oh and
wow nice
yes
thank you
the one
yes three
it's slightly before you do that one
yeah
but then it's just this section
okay
now I got stuck on the edge
it does feel like it's
facing
the time with the industrial changes
that was a good one
this one not this guy this previous but
it's still great
foreign
it's it's the platform it's moving which
causes the ball to move so the platform
is moving to left it is like the
platform is pushing the ball to the
right as it's moving to the left
I guess in physics makes sense
because the platform is moving
underneath the bomb but let's see
time the ball is standing on top of it I
don't know I don't have V6
so the thing is I need to push much more
forward than I do
Apache
try aiming correctly but I'm not
compensating for taking that platforms
like never do it
if you buy a constant file
basically have to move
things with deep water
which I've obviously don't want to but
that's what I have today
yeah yeah thank you
try to do that but that was good too
no no no this run is over
there I mean it's over 45 now is that
the capture card is messing with me
nice
I'm happy it's the cave on this thing I
have broken cameras
I need cables
because the head slightly to my
annoys with this level
I got a nice little kitten Hello Kitty
welcome
I'm happy that you are here
but you can do it now I just ran into
that one I swimsuit
welcome cake too
before I swear I missed that
it's kind of focused on this level
swimsuit for the snow 11. that seems
hard yet appropriate how are you feeling
better
yeah yeah
I mean I felt better since yesterday
yes I really remember saying it I didn't
feel good and
yes yesterday I went to the store and
got me some food
she was what I needed
and I now I am all better
very
but not cute enough to win this lemon
I yeah yeah I'm glad you're doing that
hey
thank you kitten
I just wish I was there at this evening
thank you
ah did you jump over that one
foreign
I should have used the gun
this level looks hard it's
it's ah yeah
it's not hard I guess it's just that
if you're going to go through it quickly
I guess it's many places where you can
make mistakes
Engineers want to completely level it's
not really too hard I guess
it looks like that picture
no
and it is the physics that doesn't make
sense to me sometimes it may maybe it
makes sense I've actually never been
trying to roll upon being inside of
polynomics
just that you can easily turn
but if he hits a wall it's it kind of
stops all momentum
and not just the momentum in the
direction you're still need
or something I don't know
[Music]
at least that works right
down
to this part
yeah I should have just jumped across
over there
you bumped it first okay and then
yesterday
okay
anyway about that if you have to wear
else
but that one
it was
[Music]
sometimes sometimes he doesn't care in
the direction I want
and a nice
straight into the natures
thank you
foreign
I hate pick everything except for that
one box
no but I got time
to wait for this one
those new drawings you did were super
cute
I mean
new emails
wish I
and the way thing is on sea of them yeah
I'm not sure what's wrong with twitch it
was supposed to be a 60th day today
maybe they have to
there's lots of the lick one which I
don't have a space for it
I guess I guess twitch I guess this day
has to be over and then even though I
have technically streamed today
I guess they want today to be over
before they unbox the following months
and when they are unlocked that means
that subscribers gets five more emotes
families well technically it's kids five
money makes everyone gets five more
emotes
if you are just a follower and haven't
donated a single bit
like less than a Samsung it's
technically
and you are
having you have serial emotes and zero
plus five is five seconds
maybe technical again
[Music]
man enough okay you take this fight this
time
they have hotels and then I have to go
in between
I thought I had enough speed to get
across that one
[Music]
all right I guess I have to try to go
around that one as well
this part will be the like him for the
girl
starting
yes apparently
so apparently
excuse me and at least
went weird
here the bits are accumulative
and subscribers are not
so when you're supposed to get
25 subscriber points to unlock the
second image
the second extra email slot we have to
have 25 actin points
the closer I was was at 20.
but it has dropped down to 11 now
because a lot of the gift subscribers
have run out
145 seconds that is gold
try not to
icon
under 45 seconds
foreign
seconds I don't think they have done
that
hello look right Panda yeah I did it
after many attempts let me say
you could do it
Thanks for believing me now uh
just a regular it is the
decided that the 11th previous screen is
outside View
I don't like it was made for white
screen but this game doesn't have white
skin support so it's kind of weird
all right did I climb it then that one
even though I was spinning around
all right okay
I got I died but particle effects it's
like a bit of [ __ ] line I was just
killed by Green Line
it's hard to determine where they can
damaging stars and things
for these things but this time
yeah music community
[Music]
posture it like that
okay and now I just um
excuse me I need to continue
yeah I probably need that one
what
I win and then
are we
will be back I got to do something real
quick but then I'll be listening okay I
cannot die by this
I don't know
seem like you
wait so
this thing that looks like fire these
are safe
but the green lights
are deadly
yeah
I get the swimsuit is a few things for
this hot Lounge
I should pick up
I'm supposed to get some specializing
foreign
there we go
no of course of course the game that
allows you to keep your mask and at the
start of the time trial is the game that
doesn't remember how many masks you
should start with that thing started
attack yeah start of 11.
unlike previous questions
this part anyway so
that's like I didn't have to read it
I lost it again
I guess it did hit the propeller
yeah yeah this is from aside from
I don't mind the ball levels but this is
probably the level I
it's like the most
hand part fresh
which is annoying level with the
with the dust roots and everything at
least that's more of a fair challenge
this is just isn't it
fine it doesn't hurt you but some light
does
but
it really looks like lights
just it's so hard to see where it start
starts and ends
the hitbox and crash is TV
because there was an idea of ranking the
levels from hardest incense
I really want to rank the most annoying
to the least annoying
The Mask I've known
I got that part and
oh cancel it
I didn't really raise any true because I
mean it wasn't green
all right
foreign
oh and then jump over that
all right
that shit's fine now
put down today I should try it I already
look at that
would you look at that
[Music]
it's just a stupid ball level
I'm not gonna get partner from that one
but otherwise
that's one
room that they haven't really tested the
time it turns on
[Music]
anything else
breaking is the worst case the detention
I lost the best game I guess
yay
problems with the TVC so that was too
hard
that's just how
yeah this level
not even at this sound
I care for the few more nice
one fruit thinking
then I have to
some Farm
a wonderful things
Farm Life somewhere
what level of these is the part of life
song
11 with a bonus that has a lot of
relaxing
there we go now let's do take care of
green
there's a note
tap on the stock activate boxes with
times on
[Music]
my key
to get a set let's just really dancing I
think
no I missed the same
whether they get destroyed by the
Avalanche that that comes the team
five seconds
they don't
drink it six seconds
enjoy is this this way yes I run past it
but I got killed but I did me six
seconds it's six seconds and after the
Vlog now another that I'm going for it
they really went all outfits the
challenges of this game
but yeah I would cut we got it if I
quite voids
I didn't get that button
okay
um
[Music]
but I'll start with that double mask
oh
yeah
yeah
climbing
[ __ ] up that was a waste
slimy
like it is four seconds there but
it probably takes me more than four
seconds to go in there
very useful triple master
that
get this thank you
[Music]
deep down
[Music]
again just just shoot these
as far as I can Rush when it comes to
expired the shooting
that sounds coming soon
I should have picked that one up
I couldn't run through that one when I
get it wasn't it was one of the strong
one
it
is man
all right did it really
how many times since do you have left is
there a lot left beside the hotties
levels are called this time scene this
is the um
attempts
from 16 of 25 11's
so they should be nine lamps left
stupid solid laser
[Music]
foreign
I really really want to
know
what's the developer that sets the
climbing speed was thinking
I missed the camera
wait a minute I should just do this
really me
before captain
uh just realized that's a thing I can do
ah
you know because it's the chicken it
close
reduction out
robots going between
different stations
that is this thing
that's something
you did take it
oh I did it and then get past this
they have a double mask now
I'll just rush
through this
I didn't need anything damage
yeah let's go to your friends
wait this girl
oh is that a blue
so hard to tell
I thought that was pretty quick
ly
pipes five six good I should be able to
do that
yay did it count I need to go
I need the gold before it counts I don't
need plasma at least that doesn't count
as 100 in the game
it's just like a bonus scene I do I have
listed that on my
on my list of completionists as an extra
thing
okay let me
which
you can't wait for the day it is
when I make it automatic I will try to
make pon pon
something more
I'm not going to have tracking anything
but I do want to do something more with
pumpkin
I should probably redrop one for myself
and then I will draw my own outfits
right don't cry
I just have to die five times now again
one two very wasting lives
that's how they make it happen fans
if they gave you two masks at the start
I would have to waste 10 lives
that would be nice don't know why my
phone can't stop making oh I got it
sometimes it doesn't make a sound
like yeah I didn't get one
how cheap after him
I already get one
double mask so and then I will get a
trip mask when I can run through that
section which is what I need probably to
get
the pasta time
instead of having to bother about
daily without having bother about it
like just we're gonna release something
here
I just didn't want those of course
not not like that
it's just the stupid metal boxes really
gets in the way there
[Music]
I'm spinning
but I wasn't close enough
and I'm you know any comments at the
moment that would be nice don't know if
my phone account I didn't ignore it did
you just wrote that and I didn't
I will have a maid dress
and apparently
passing in the air stops your momentum
and that's really some strangeness to
this thing
enemy
that's because I fell down
yeah they're kind of blocking the
yeah it has to wait until it was built
is over before you can die from
which really should override
any form of usability but
I double jumped that's another thing
inspire
basically have a slight timer as soon as
you grab onto it that we're pressing
jump again which is what you use to
release with doesn't release
alternatively
have a different button to release
because currently
The Purge button
yeah it could work as a release button
because
the charge button does lift up his leg
but
that's it doesn't do anything
I need to spin that
we're about it
then it's Rush
I will just skip this I'll see
you can probably skipped it quickly but
let's stay quick
this is mask
I can take
and then I just Powers through that
and then just jumping through that
and then no that's my sahaja ignoring
no
major is so nice yeah
okay okay
this section
thank you
get stuck
yeah they like I could do different
process I don't know
I thought I would be able to control the
most closest sign but
okay that's like the early
yeah you have to wait for the
invisibility before you die what's an
oversight
but it doesn't mean that if you get
three masks you will be able to stand
down there without dying
thank you
foreign
was so slow in this game so the first
time I played it I had to look up online
how you would be able to climb faster
but there isn't a way to find fasting
this is just how fast your time in the
game
stop getting stuck
and take this
thing
don't touch me
all right
I'm gonna say I'm going the wrong way if
I had to pick up that
mask which for somebody I didn't see
foreign
foreign
Ty
is it that much
foreign
[Music]
section
I will waste a mask on that enemy
because trying to jump over it would be
so hard
and I will not waste time trying to
shoot me
and then I was used invisibility to
destroy the TNT
and also sometimes I get stuck in those
methods
things
sometimes it feels like it can run
around them sometimes
I wonder if they might still pick
something
I wanted to go
no can't get my enemy
now I like the enemy
We Can't Stop
foreign
[Music]
anyway one more try
apparently I've been struggling with
this opening Video 17 haven't been able
to test my planet
and
what happened there the jump what kind
of jump is that
was an awful Tempo or something
I need to handle it
yeah I don't know what's happened with
that jump
all right
stuck in there
climbing or something
again
okay yes got stuck didn't start climbing
because I only pressed the ones
just
nothing
nothing
Stuck In The Box
yeah why am I listen to The Following
don't love Elizabeth
[Music]
I should have slime
slides I cannot
apparently reach this part anymore so I
kind of forgot what I'm supposed to do
foreign
are you being annoying this stuff I
can't spell tomorrow
yeah I kind of
you know anyone
that makes that three
not the mask
and I need that
because I didn't have any mask anymore
yeah there was a terrible around
[Music]
foreign
I managed to beat the ball Heaven spoil
it
41 seconds and some more
seconds in this month
[Music]
so quite a good time
So currently I'm trying to strike
through this level which in giving me
huge trouble at the moment
don't know sometimes the
uh like I think that jump was Professor
was jumping
it's an angle or something
but sometimes they jump this he doesn't
want to go anymore
thank you
I can see that it does hanging portions
are slowing system
yeah I always confuse me
[Music]
some game design I was confused me and
the house mention it when it shows up
that's how much it confuses me
good
both
guys
don't touch me
like that here is the mask
foreign
[Music]
okay in the previous times sci-fi or
blue it can time is platinum or white so
the these three times are very very
close together
very very close together
and then you go so
it's particularly generating
cartographic generate it doesn't do
anything it's just there to show off
that they can make a lot of parts
effects with this engine
all right all right is this the cocoa
flying level which that means are
suicidal
ruining the home game
of space stations that are ready to
strike the planet use the lasers on your
ship to destroy them
okay but
yeah like they're so suicidal
foreign
I I somehow lost the whole Space Station
and also I don't I really don't like how
they put the clothes
nice
because I barely started playing a
compound game
no no
can't be a [ __ ] fan
save Simon
let's try it quickly
thank you
foreign
welcome Aston
and Navi
cortex the voice is key which voice
[Music]
I can't even start detention
please
there's my way
oh come on how many hits this is left
like Disney you have a chance to try one
hit
uh
one hits left
to destroy them
foreign
hits this time at least
stop being so suicidal it's not a fan
it's not fun
it's not fair it's just spawning more
and more enemies and then there's
wasting that then you have nothing to
lose with dying I lose the whole
challenge but I
don't even remember what time I suppose
again
all right
I guess this is amazing
and
types because I can't lose life second
my only Airlines
it was quick eh
[Music]
I'm still getting the attack right I
need to burn like one minute 25 seconds
or something
oh I can't see your message
decided not to show me
enjoyed it's outside of me
sometimes
sometimes fishes like that
it doesn't scroll down all the way
a double suicide thank you
I'm going to talk about suicide a lot of
things
challenge
but maybe if the enemies weren't so
suicidal
I'm gonna be quenching the worst enough
time to 35 already
yeah
they got held back but it was ways to be
immunity
well monsters
oh
again it's just one heater so left
uh
I guess that's my luck
and that was another suicide
I can see him I said because someone
that's about something
well I'm trying but I'm getting
destroyed but it's suicidal enemy
what am I supposed to do
your face in my ears
but that was enough to take his time
and suicide did that hit me from behind
or something
that's a very hearty it's the house no
it's not this is a different kind of
BS
like that was
myself running into it I'll take that
foreign
back here one minute nine seconds
hey
and then I get last night instead yeah
the times are very close together
I only went with gold
cut myself some way to enjoy with this
but the silly people haven't cut it and
never put this sauce oh I didn't get
sauce oh hello okay man
yeah
one stuff apart from me
I mean yeah
if it if it's like subway they do make
it in front of you I guess you were busy
doing something else
you can always make sure that they do it
correctly
I can handle it's not being cut in half
I have knives yeah I don't mind like I
don't care if you cut them I mean they
just cut it
I stand next
I don't know
it's like this touch
he kept some
with no sauce that's unforgivable oh
what sauce was it
they had put sauce on it very little and
it's all at the bottom here please they
put the sauce on it improperly
our girls needs a canopy on her ships
she's just exposed in space
I didn't even consider that
oh there you go
I went to find out
all right
did I die from that thing that was
hiding
yep
okay don't get stuck
uh I don't
yeah
under what level help crash has his
goggles I mean
he has
at least
stuff
exam
underwater boat
this
uh I wasn't supposed to kill them
foreign
swimming
it's a Time
what
Okay so
oh my God
you take the one but not the same
why do I get extra life in time
that makes no sense
but I was attacking
right
oh yeah I want things
good thing I see
thank you
it's nasty of the months
okay must be beautiful cheese
yeah she doesn't feel the same as crash
she's a completely different character
with her own mother letting me
this this level is
going to be something
I really don't like how you can take
damage to the enemy that is
attracted therefore you can't attack it
comes out
thank you
like ain't getting in the way
how much time is standing here
let's think if I started going back
then somewhere at the end here
three
come on
this is a waste of time
I think I heard this sound
but it hadn't
it's me to the rocket or something
[Music]
come on
I wasn't touching it
okay that one would have crush me it's
early but
right now
foreign
no I didn't mean to go down
yeah I'm missing
community
nothing great
it's hard to see what's coming coming
ahead because
he's in the middle of the screen
actually
be kinda forward
yeah it feels like me it doesn't
and it's not white screen
you know how much you can see ahead is
not much
oh I didn't take damage the same okay
still getting stuck on that one
it's just hard to see
you're seeing ahead and planning is
cheating
kept missing it
we're not even here yeah there's a lot
of lagging back man
what is it perfectly fine of course
[Music]
I just haven't had so many luck messages
before
that one States through it how is that
there
but it is a Time
okay what
it's so hard to see those small fish
especially with the other
fish in the background which aren't
enemies and then there's some fish in
the foreground which are about the same
size that the fish in the background
which are enemies
and it is a reason why
he's actually my favorite Clements
now
foreign
if the shots are going straight through
the fish
okay that's not fair
I want to kill them see I have to kill
it blocking
I guess the top part of it is unkillable
but it can hurt me yes I don't know
excited
foreign
anyway
I've never seen near me
destroying everything except the one I
want to destroy
okay then
that's why I went in here
no
it's so much
and then that is somehow stuff like that
might never specifically
thank you
on the 11 pushed me into it mmm
no
okay
going to be nice
no
you know
if there's nothing here
foreign
[Music]
and this isn't it
stop killing stuck
I I don't mind it being one and
something but actually move up
it would help a lot
a small fish
just uh I'll keep going down here
and that one is pretty quick
it wasn't touching me
[Music]
this lemon
and it is starting to get warm
if I need to go up
but please please move up
fish
candy fish
thank you
and a key active when you feel something
I'm just gonna say that that one has to
explain by that
there we go
man
I like that machine
okay now
let's try to avoid this time
it's going to be all careful and
actually
but here we go
that wasn't that terrible after all
and I got girls oh you can be quick
I'm happy because I finally
I am happy with that
wait was it did not need to be too much
quicker to get next
and next one and that was the 100 too
bye dolly
[Music]
yeah
I mean compared to Summer levels
that was a terrible that was actually
wait
there have been worse levels but yeah I
do so prefer
running on foot I feel like I have some
probably like yeah I feel like I have
much more control
all right
no let's try that
okay
thank you the new stuff and don't start
thank you
good timing
now
now I need to slide jump
without camera mask
s
and this is the annoying part at least I
only have to do is one spine
that's what I'm doing this
foreign
I guess when this song to be interesting
something
that was worth it
but the loop points a bit terrible
phone was not meant
there you go
foreign
okay okay I have an idea for how to do
that
like I know how to do that
I see how everything works
thank you
[Applause]
oh what kind of small jump was that
yeah probably
it's America day happy Easter
America
which might be America day
yeah that was like the wrong box to jump
on
[Music]
that to me it's a normal Tuesday
but did I take damage from there
sure
I just woke up kids came to the plate
oh again I'm making mistakes
because I'm happy you're here
should I do something special for
and they
had this Swedish national day and the
watch me
I'm not much for it
okay okay okay
happy to be here
okay I'm making mistakes I'm making
mistakes
and speaking of these things
please
okay come on wish to jump
make a swimsuit that is the Swedish flag
I mean I guess I could
change the pattern of it and so it
matches the Swedish
Olympic swimsuits whichever design I
thank you
it's nice
that's it that's that's an option
and those like this and what do you do
on sleeping day well it's just there
nothing it is a day off but
I don't do anything special
stay
it was previously the day after this
Swedish flag
wait what could I do
yeah I'm so confused I'm so confused why
could I do that before
like first time I was doing oh probably
the second time
I could just do this do this Spin and
then just
drop down and
it was just nicely
gliding across to the other side
let's now
he doesn't do that
thank you
um
it looked at the date Sweden
Independence Day is my anniversary well
I mean it's not a Swedish Independence
Day it's just the Swedish national day
you know you know since Sweden doesn't
have an independence from school anyway
anyone
a couple days before
this weekend
it was a good question
but yeah
I think it's uh something about the
I don't know if it's it was previously
the the the the
day of the Swedish flag but Sweden has
multiple flight names which I like the
birth of the king Supply thing
the name day of the king
it's the birthday name day of the
king queen and the Crown Prince or
princess
[Music]
okay that that one I can do that one
again
I would guess them I mean I've seen like
Sweden gotten in Canada Michael when
where how
I mean
when when did when did Denmark own
Sweden I do know that it was the uh
uh joint
uh Palma Union but that was
that wasn't like Denmark owned in Sweden
which I've seen claims being the case
but
that that's like claiming
Germany owns every EU country or
something you know because we're part of
the European Union
Sweden still had their own King During
the Calvin Union
so
okay
so I'm not really sure
it Release Me
it's stuck on that
no
what a stupid clever
language
oh yeah yeah that makes sense
and then the adaption of the National
Council yeah I was going to say that I
think I think there was something
because I'm funny
okay right up on that and I think it was
something about the Constitution too
and but I wasn't sure if I was confusing
that but then March
the speed
if they can damage from that one
I might be able to get through without
taking damage
oh this time he didn't want to grab that
so yeah
I like learning about to see this
country and stuff for me
even though you're ready to talk to
yourself but yeah okay here's some
is important
Swedish Sweden has specific days or uh
for the flag
and which kind of gets silly because I
tried to look up a flag days one week's
opinion but that's that's only specific
days in celebration oh
yeah
the flag
the Swedish national day was for example
previously the Swedish flag day which is
listed as one of the days
and but but
the the flag the days where you use the
flag and not the days where I
you celebrate the fact
and and today there is no
black celebrity the day of the flag but
there are days by the flying seats
that makes sense
I think in Sweden there is called flag
days because that's this
sorta and that's it that's
the flight days are the flags days the
flags at least which can be seen because
the buses and tramps have Flags
on the front
[Music]
and it was meant as the day or if I
didn't think time can pass previous time
I will take two times a month
previously that was the only day we're
supposed to
have the flag up privately and after any
other day
how did I get across that corner before
so of course the national day of Sweden
is of course another one of those flight
days
and what more days
are there I should know them
are cute
it should be uh the U.N day I think else
is a finance
really I get oh yeah I got serious that
one yeah
I guess makes sense because it's really
so do you remember
yeah I should have slide jumped
but now it feels like that corner isn't
working for me anymore
it must be more than
there isn't many things
foreign
maybe the election day is a Friday
his name is
we can scan at that one
no
cut the corner this time
now Champa
if
you go
it just slightly
everything is
prepared but your dick always yeah
that's kinda
when you see a photo City you know it's
in the United States because of all the
flights there is a photo of a city in a
different country it's much harder to
10.
so strange with flags everywhere
every day
thank you for being here
I'm gonna get some food I hope you have
a good rest of your skin if I'm okay
thank you Ethan I hope you have find
some good food
bye bye and Josh
enjoy your meal
yeah anything
actually complete this level now
you only have to go
let's do it need to be somewhat quick
we're not going to be too quick
could be a bit more careful
[Music]
no
this is the last Market damage
2011 or something
that's right let me get that that was a
waste of time
probably say to me if I miss it that she
just didn't know it I got you nice
yeah she's just doing this part
a little bit
there you go
happy
yeah I'm not sure
I know it's not a fan about being able
to release immediately after grabbing it
[Music]
all right
actually I remember one more day I sing
I could be wrong there
but if Finley they finish Independence
Day might be a Swedish flag day
but you gotta
why did I do that sounds silly
I don't know maybe someone should look
up which day is there
let me actually
I think a very quick
because I'm taking damage everything
you just have to remember
I do get a lot of lights there
this one I just have to clap know about
me
I'm gonna love you jump right there
that one and then I have a record this
fight yet
I'm running
ah thank you
that mask
let me see
all right yeah I don't think you might
say anything I need it I did it I said
if I go to fail I'm going to drink a
short break but I did it instead
[Music]
here we go
so only five more
okay there was a few more I have like
there's no expected 1st of January which

which is the Christmas Day
even though it's the 24th that swedes
normally celebrates
just like most of Europe
and
that's a that's quite a lot of them how
many of them how many of us that that's
six seven eight nine ten eleven twenty
seven
and then so that's 18 well 17 during
normal year 18 year election yes
a few important I expected
I knew there was somewhere I wasn't
expecting to be that many can I forget
about most of those
it's definitely getting late for you
goodbye good night
thank you for being here
mid-summer I heard it's a big deal
yeah it's just some it's it's a big deal
big celebration I haven't bought this
about that
but I would like to actually do some
kind of Celebration I do like cake so
I've decided that maybe I should do like
what to me is like a classic cake which
is uh which is uh do you know what
I should put it on screen
eh
that's a very end of it not exactly what
I'm looking for
okay there are some
you can't can I find can I find one
that's
I have a vision of how she looks like
not none of these pictures are
the exactly the way um been ambitioning
it that's the closest one I guess I'll
take it
no actually
I take this one instead is that exactly
what is it good enough
to get my point Acres
so
let me
what did I say
oh
wrong place
yeah right
yeah
oh hello welcome nice to see you
maybe next year you can have some have
special stream but
hey what you would you
yeah do you have any ideas I don't have
any ideas the basically is like a
whipped cream cake with strawberries you
can
remove the vegetation if that's a good
time then you don't have to clean they
decided not to remember
uh the the values I'm thinking has the
whipped cream more like an edge around
it and then you put most the strawberry
slices in the middle of it this one is
mortar the the correct decorative
decorative that's my it might be I think
hey oh okay this is it your first no no
no this is a
um I don't know if it's traditional but
how I envisioned
or close to what I mentioned uh how
a cake would be for the mid-summer
celebration here in Sweden
strawberry and whipped cream cake what
the insides is well against the cake
bread thing and
other stuff
vanilla I don't know anything
strawberries on a cake yeah
that's where they belong
my birthday is do you remember that
when I say this is the 6th of May
that it's not my it's not my legal
birthday it's a point one's birthday
the 6th of May yes
I do remember pumpkin's birthday
decorates make with Summer cake for
stream next yeah yeah that's that's an
interesting yeah maybe I should make a
make a cake and then show it on stream
tonight
not really a strawberry I mean if you're
not into strawberries
angel food cake with whipped cream and
strawberries got tips
and then they would need to do for
kidneys
it does look interesting
and I wouldn't mind trying that
kind of remains
it kind of reminds me of a sponge cake
but it does since look like one
but this circular shape of it
but it looks more towards the cake more
than
SpongeBob I haven't had a sponge cake
a long time
Spanish cake in Swedish is called a
sugar cake
a bowl of good taste
red velvet or lemon drizzle is the pump
all this cake that's giving me kind of
make more I want cake I
you're excited for cake
okay uh oh
nice no more TNT
okay let's see how many attempts this
will take so this is the 21st level
from me
so that's
these are four more limits
oh I didn't get that one
yeah let's see
okay I got the cake for another like
three months but some God has some
working through some on a restricted
diet
uh I hope it goes
uh
good food yeah you're strong
after that I would remember this moment
you're strong
okay working sweet and I hope
and I hope it worked it
you recovery
I don't know what to say I'm too I'm too
introverted
I wish you the best
I'm trying to stay strong
as you are strong
your mental strength
is strong
I didn't know how to do this that
sounded weird
you have strong in Memphis I don't know
she's using strong strong strength
sounds Maybe
yeah it's not very worried
yeah
oh let me step that for him I'm bad at
just staying away from spices
I mean spicy is at least
yeah us a lot spicy
yeah I like the
make some stuff spicy
it's some added spiciness something
them
cow
all right okay
okay
everything is going nice now
I mean soon
there you go
that's a realize I don't have a master
pin
so I should do something about that
which means I had to die
you know the spicy bottle
Ramen that's my favorite package
Ramen I yeah
I wanted to I still haven't introduced
the wheel yet I should
and
be one of the things would be maybe
spicy very spicy Ramen
assume that's something you can store
for a long time because it's like dry
hunted and it's quick to prepare
there we go now I got the mask
because in this game for some reason we
are allowed to keep it when you start
typing
don't waste trying to get a mask in the
audition crash games you don't get to
keep it
so with the extra mask at the beginning
that should
be a bit
oh I'm back again
let me sing
all right
and then oh look I stood on it that's
not what crash works
and then I get this thing and in this
game it lasts for just a few seconds
and I don't get to use it
no it ran out just as it was but come on
jump up
jump up crash you can do it
for myself
another invisibility
problem is next
next problem with with this game it does
it doesn't destroy all the blocks above
itself so this invisibility is really
terrible
but I didn't get to the end
and I got there
that was blue right it's so hard to tell
especially since I had something
ah that's
oh my
[Music]
if you like spices really good and the
flavor is really good as well
but I don't think yeah well I probably
would might be able to find it I don't
know I don't think
like I haven't checked what brands are
not any available here but
maybe maybe not
[Music]
I had one ship and it destroys Me Maybe
maybe it might have even here
anyway I need to be 96 centiseconds
quickie
so basically one second
just one second and here's the nine part
if you complete the lemon
oh actually
actually because a complete level with a
double mask I actually get to start this
level but the double mask
which means I can start a time travel
with a purpose must
however if I do fail which I hope I
don't
and I started level with Sarah mask and
I have the dice five times again because
this game
yeah not really screwing up
so it's in this game where you allowed
to start the time
this game where I love to start the time
trial with uh with the mouse
and it is the game that does not
remember which mask uh how many times
you have died in the level in previous
attempts
if I have the option to start with a
mouse why wouldn't I
start with the mask
I'm going to pick up the streets I don't
lose as much size
as quickly
the number of fields in these boxes are
random
velocity there we go
for the funny light ice cream
that attempt to stop talking about
sweets
no I'm also trying to reduce how much
sweets I'm eating
I'm trying to keep my shape
giving us a step up to chat for my day
spices cheeks
less
and it just sounds good
a regular spot I haven't had
yeah I'm not gonna create that moment
nothing I'm going to do like one second
quickie than last time
I had to
and after this
getting stuck on boxes
the singular spicy chip
I think this I could be
I could be wrong but I think this is
singular in Swedish is
ships
empty one is the ships as well
they would say at ships
so
I need to hydrate
because of the swimming suit is over
since a long time ago
go back
Okay so
foreign
but compared to previous crash games I
think previous cash came here and he's
built for a short time did they mix up
the timer for the two invisibilities
like if I if I was failing this quickly
else I cannot use the restart time
thread from the menu because if you pick
that option it will clear how many times
I have died at certain levels I need to
die five times again
wasting five more times this game is so
it's weird
things yeah
I want to play through this crash
eventually I'm not sure if this question
I want to see you played certain
questions
I mean I want to see you play games
but you play games when I sleep no
foreign
why am I still messing this up
since we have a lot of people here
and now on Sunday if you are have the
time to I'm actually going to do my very
first collab
it's going if you are on the my Discord
server it is it's on the schedule if
otherwise you can check my schedule on
Twitch it's written on Sunday
or if you can if you know what your UTC
offset is do you take
it will help it will happen on at 16 so
yes subtract from 16.
I think
no I don't remember in timestamps
I only know Europe in Europe West is 17
18 19.
I know that
but for other parts of the world
right here on here
as long as you know you're upset just
take 16 and plus your options
yes that's how
yeah
like I can
a candy the versions but and that's
right
and I've traveled during progressions
but
I usually just take a quick quick look
at what the map what they call
Corrections like
okay that was okay
so let's mess it up
and
foreign
[Music]
come on I don't even remember what time
I was supposed to have but that is
well well I still didn't get cold
oh fun fun I saw on the crowd control
Twitter they kiss crash Panic could
remake
wait what's crowd control Twitter
control with the crash game
oh is it the uh twitch crowd controls
thing yeah
[Music]
they are making some support for crash
game
[Music]
and
what kind of current
yeah that is what trash game it means
unless Alice is like are they going to
add it to a insane Trilogy or something
okay camera control would work in such a
game anyway
no it's this level
let's go
11 for some reasons here this exciting
section and I completely forgot that
thumbs up hurt
all right
specific parents
they need to put the timer at the bottom
and not only talking
trust me
yes
all right can you just walk next to it
all that said
well no not
uh
okay I'll try without the mask
yeah
okay second you skip past him
yeah that does twitch strategy game
inside and flip screen increase crash
speeds small fresh speaker okay but is
it
big or small tacky
well
all right
I kept that one
oh yeah
this song is so weird and gives up in
speed and then loops and
it comes slow again
[Music]
okay that I can't determine
what's the
they don't want to put any timers up
there
guys
interesting choice
oh
it would have to be the PC version
because it's always surprised or not
uh yeah it makes sense
it wouldn't be nice if they found a way
to do
oh my God
yeah but wouldn't that just be like
saying Trilogy or something
because that's the remake
there you go that was nice
oh something was going to fall down
what about invincible
yeah it's been some nice things like
invisibility
treatment mask is keep a mask or take
away a mask
whatever the chat is like
apparently that it will be a thing in
the district level 3 mask or nothing
ah or a spinning
okay so I just have to
well the speed of hands don't have care
about anything
but not sure nothing officially yeah
yeah no I'm
I don't think like crowd control would
fit my channel though
no kick it down for me
when it's really
work I guess
with the way I I'm trying to complete
the games
to get a mask
okay
yeah I hope there's no time is left
the staircase
oh I saved myself
I think
I really dislike the whole
if if you can release as soon as you
grab it empty
that's it
that's basically had no reaction time
already I have no time to react if it's
a gram or not
before I press
a little bit too hard of a level
yes that last section yeah it feels like
how it should be over but then he just
continues
that was squeaking
ignoring the parent
sorry
boxing away
I hope the university Master this I like
the music in this level yeah I really
wish they could turn
[Music]
that was nice
oh that sounds nice
Let's ignore the other numbering
yeah if they I wish they could read and
remake it I wish they could
make it on in line with other crash game
by changing the rules to how they should
be
because the levels and everything would
be the same it's just
just use the proper classrooms
I think
nice I got the mask
thank you
chicken mask
the mask is inside his face
since the basics I have the engine
trash
it was a gap day it was like
fix the house but time transfer
that's what you mean yes they should
actually make the
time trials proper times
they did that there is an updated
version of the game not some places too
let's see I don't know if the Xbox
version which is latest version which as
the time comes fixed
expensive thing
[Music]
is it's too hard
just have to remember everything
and fix hey like
yeah they're like all right
spinning too early
because I don't think there's any
anything any possible anything in the
game but we encourage this specific and
different synonyms
there is a statement which is annoying
oh
it went
chocolate pasta this time
but I didn't get the Chipmunks this time
okay there's a gap here okay
oh
the Ham's the bar levels over why I
quickly
they're fine and it's I just it's just
getting cold that is a twitching
is it it's basically yeah it's TNT that
those things should not have been
activated
a TNT should only be activated if it
falls down at least one step
and there is a box on top of it
I did that again
not in this game
yeah they activate when they land on the
ground
doesn't matter
and how they fall down
it's only if they fall down and land on
the ground I think they activate another
kid why they made it like that exactly
the ones who made the game I have only
seen
pictures of Crash things but let me play
the question
hmm
maybe slow
foreign
foreign
thank you
finally
no
I haven't gotten that far in level yes I
wasn't really prepared
for what was coming
[Music]
down some wide hitboxes oops Yeah
yeah it was that
tried to be safe to do a double jump
like Inspire to grab onto the
bars but that's just my expression These
Bars because
unless you jump too low meaning that you
won't reach them in that case you have
to do a double jump
private boxes
so
it's a confusing mess
foreign
wouldn't be too hard but
it's levels with climbing section that
really makes it hard for me
brush crash what
bright heat boxes again
connected
oh man
oh my
God
I guess it does have wings
that's kind of hides info
you may reaction time sometimes no
well
at least I'm not playing to the obvious
window
what it plays like
it's like 15 frame second and half a
second delay
okay
well I am on good way to the card
section now
box it in the way Association
yeah I really don't like money there's
no sliding
through the pump sections
Dynamite
no
I wanted to say oh how what happens if I
activate this I wasn't allowed
anyway so
foreign
climbing section again
tap
that
that's gone
and
okay
now that's far enough
and again
and that's gold
no I gotta go I got a hydrate okay
hopefully
that was the last annoying level there's
three more levels I don't remember what
they were but I don't think
but I can't remember any annoying ones
I thought it was yellow
hello no no no that's not that's not
what I said it's Sapphire gold and
platinum or platinum obtainium as it
should be or
because you say blue it should be blue
yellow what
I know I wasn't
too clear about my message I wanted to
give it a short but that's basically
what I meant
[Music]
okay this is this level but I don't
think this was annoying
the only Annoying part
of it okay I should just take a left
pass but the only Annoying part with
this is if the gold plant is very short
which honestly I believe it is
okay
maybe it isn't
it maybe they
foreign
[Music]
but however
has not yet proven it 'd be annoying
thank you
why is it safe now I'm the one with the
one
times
have to trick him around him anyway
well
of course there was a bouncing this
three
because each other
do you think he needs
space yeah I got I got they actually
approved as a single frame gift I didn't
think they would do that because that's
basically cheating this system for the
approved it
at least the music is good guys it's a
bit of the repetitive side but
it it has some specific
there's some action to the music
yeah I think I'm
okay with a lot of music in this game
[Music]
granny
[Music]
welcome Benny
innovators of course you're all welcome
currently
playing
fresh Bandicoot
brass of Cortex
is
trying to get through this ball running
levels
no no no no no no no no
no no no no no yeah
hello Cinder fur
so let's do the obligatory
oh you were playing gigs I didn't know
that penny
what a surprise
yeah I was I was there watching before I
started streaming
and you were playing that game pretty
well
okay
it was an interesting game
I can give the the series a try
and
this it is a 3D platformer after all
right for that one
he doesn't even go all the way to the
side to stop me feeling so
silly
yeah I should probably take this path
what's up okay
while I'm on this platform let me
continue this game is a lot of fun it is
fun it has its very frustrating moments
especially the ballroom 11's trying to
get gold which is my goal
but otherwise it can be fun and also I
have a lot of pieces if it came it's
but they call it a love-hate
relationship
I love the I don't I wouldn't say I love
the game it is fun to play but there are
several things I really really dislike
about the game
yeah it was fun because you just need
retro achievements yay yeah I never get
you're like you're created those games
Danny it's time to actually tough hey
well actually time today is pretty easy
in this game because the on the PSD
version because they haven't properly
sacred times
instead they have overestimated
how much time you need
this is why I got yeah which was in here
10 platinum and
I haven't I haven't really tried getting
those I was just giving them
yeah I'm not I missed the clock
and crashboard three I remember being at
it being a bit yeah yeah that one they
have probably set the timers
to actually give me a challenge
but I would say this sad game
yeah no sorry challenge
unless it's a ball level like this
these are foreign
I hope you enjoy me
struggling through the time difference
it is a nice feeling when I actually get
you get a girl that then
but the struggle
he struggle to that point
so
any particularly
yeah I was supposed to get this one
I want to have much of the time I wasted
trying to pick that one up
and I hope I remember the path again
you can see the end of teeth you cannot
see them stick out on the back side
they could have made them longer
yeah am I supposed to go down on other
side I've tried that
so
balanced off the wall
I can't I need to
look
very interesting levels on the piece too
because she came yeah
it's um
they had something interesting ideas
like the ball I like
and that's I I think the too much
physics
they kind of made the acceleration a bit
quickly
when it is
but the ball feels a little too heavy to
be enjoyable
okay
you think making the ball a bit lighter
will make it more enjoyable
it will still be a challenge
thank you
[Music]
and then they could make
I don't know
obstacles here yeah that's a headache
I'm going to run out and watching
I haven't also going over time
but
I don't have any limits left and I
wanted to completely skin 100.
so
we'll see what the time is when I finish
this level
and I might be able to tackle the
remaining two
because I think the remaining two are on
foot without any climbing
which hopefully should no wait this is
this is something dishes
but all is this at bonus dream tomorrow
I'm already doing a bonus drink tomorrow
grandma is for keeping track of my
schedule
[Music]
unless you mentioned you did a second on
his dream tomorrow
I mean yeah codes
depending on how quickly I finished
spiral
I I could then switch over to Fresh
here comes all the messages
he gets this
a little bounce there
you can only cross here which I don't
know if they pretended it too but
considering the ramps they have oh no no
no with me
one second trait is not for it's the
weight I see inspiring is it's a
hairstyle I have
12 Collectibles left
and then that game is 100
there we go
oh oh I almost messed up
well I want now I missed it
when should I go
I haven't been here yet
yeah I should go this way
don't shoot me don't shoot me
okay there you go
good start
the timer is forever stuck on one second
come on go down
valid results within three seconds
the pushy things
I gotta
oh that's funny
stuff there [ __ ]
there's no fall damage but
hey
should I go again
oh no he's the same
can I get this one and then I just don't
need to get shot
he just shot at me
oh oh that boxes boxes boxes
it's like
nine seconds yeah
and then I just need to remember it's
possible
see if I remember
true
no I should go constantly
no no no no no
I beat the game but I didn't get it
cheap
oh oh so there's achievement for a
beating the game which he did and it
didn't count it
yeah that that's sad
I'm sad to hear that
this is so much
so much dragon
fell into the french fries it really
looks like french fries I haven't had
french fries
do you know the Swedish by far french
fries
okay
I know the Spanish words
but the Swedish part is just the French
word which is two words
it's spelled the French boy
uh
so it is home fit is the switch
pronunciation
well the French Bay however Palm Fleet
can be shortened to poor mess
which is just the first word pronounced
as written
yeah
that does make it easy
and that is this one as you can inside
and this time without that
that was it's more like chocolate sticks
because I have brown the eye
then I used to go straight down
and corner
and a stupid way Independence Day
bends the wrong way
I did it one minute four seconds and
it's cold
easy
if it wasn't girl that had to fit right
at one level but I got gold on the first
time I got
fritas
pumps promise
I'm not far from that this one they have
been more reasonable when it comes to
the times I'm a same
so there's only two lamps left
and I said she'll be able to do them now
even though over time but this three
hours is just
suggestion
Great Balls of Fire oh no it's it's it's
it's that 11.
let's see it wasn't cheated
yeah they speak like
like
that one
okay let's see how my all right this is
gonna think
and am I getting created during this
level I see
and I showcase my lack of skills
twister climbing section that I
completed during the whole scene
foreign
[Music]
look at crash face his expression saying
five of us did there be so many of these
hanging sections as I said it would be
on the market in a second you clearly
are more hands again
but this is the only part
that's that extra part which is because
the other hand in section is
close to I need to be before I can
release
foreign
foreign
what was that
[Music]
that's made me wonder can I do
no no no
nope that's not an option
charging distance
I guess I could even close him
okay and then I have to wait
but I didn't get that one
this spinning tornado thing is very very
not usefulness
and I thought I thought you got much
more distance in the previous game
but in this game you barely get anything
is there is that an attempt to prevent
you oh no it's bad that you see it that
is a possibility too
I I do accept that it might just be me
being bad at the game oh is that how I
do some climbing skin
keep forgetting that that thing is there
because
it doesn't need to be there hey
what's up
it's so annoying
in that side dude
okay
there's also an invisible roof so so I
can't even jump on top of that box
can you give me some extra time
oh this level
it's such a beautiful lemon
it's there for people to question why
it's there yeah sometimes it feels like
that's it's a sign of certain things
why is this thing here just so you have
something to ask about obviously
oh there we go
whoa whoa whoa whoa I didn't even know
it was a almost falling over the edge
enemies
what is this
is this oh no
I like broccoli Style
I wish I saw more of the leveling height
well no
can you see robots
no I missed the mask
I don't know what those are
sweet
no
stupid controller I
drop the Stitch
if I just wasn't playing enough with the
places you're controlling
it doesn't happen often but when it
happens it's
be really frustrating because it's not
even my fault
just badly designed controlling
and again
I wanted to react to do with double jump
if if it didn't release
so quickly after grabbing answers
so yes is that a thing in in Century
because this they are climbing sections
in those games too
and as far as I remember those words
he's frustrating
something tells me that if you grab onto
it you can't release it immediately and
I really started
oh
I am
I am still trying
but I am getting hungry
so
so I will give it a few more attempts
I'm almost there I got pretty far in
last time
so I guess I'll
I'll do it this time
this is the time
this is the time I'll do it
don't pay attention here
okay
I got the time
stupid box
how am I supposed to avoid those things
anyway
don't you see a huge mess thing
that might make
walking towards you
maybe you shouldn't I don't know just
walk across the whole
coronary now
so close I'm getting it
what was the last singings but yeah
there's a lot of memorization
finally
watch out here I come
oh wait oh wait there's such platform
why is it so tired
okay I think I can do it
I said that was the time
what was that
Jeremy
and the in other news this is the 60th
of affiliate stream which means uh with
this I should unlock the following
months
and I did try to do a very short 20
minute stream before the restroom
to like
gain the system or or how you would call
it
um
and just to clear it's 60 and different
days that I have been streaming on so it
doesn't count to like 60 short streams
in one day that's the only comes in one
stream
and about that short 20 minute stream
didn't even count it doesn't show up one
is that like it shows up
now I cut that one it shows up in my
streaming history and everything
and but in the total statistics the
statistics over across all streams it
doesn't show up for some reason which is
strange
so I was hoping that it would count
giving me follow remotes and then
you would have access to more emails
during this stream but sadly locked
a lot
that didn't turn out to be the taste
yeah I kind of forgot about this again
and as you can see or maybe not see
mom
[Music]

this type of trash is a bit difficult to
get all time boxes for example for the
best time but I don't care about the
best time I just came back here on time
