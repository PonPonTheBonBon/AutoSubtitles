welcome oh a very nice I haven't even

started up the

character service

um

that's why there's no picture

but is it quick to start up the game is

started the console works the

it's okay another great startup stream

but it's the classic one pan at this

point

and this drink called the next skit it

was down and read before I don't know

why say the video

there's background

for some reason it's not perfectly

aligned but

take one pixel off for some reason

but but

shows the picture rather immediately but

then it takes like

another few seconds for it properly

get going

kinda annoys me how just like why is

there even

that's the outline of pixels that isn't

even covered

because I have seen yeah it should be

set to use

where am I doing other stuff at the

moment they're not playing the game I

guess it's

crazy for thick

it seem fine to do that but

[Music]

that looks fine

just for some reason a single line of

pixels

[Music]

there we go now it's gone

it will never annoy me and or

if I was waiting so

I guess I'll just begin the adventure

[Music]

crushing the laser inspire a new

beginning is an odyssey feature

when you see game progress is split

when your game progresses being all the

same these icon is displayed but the

thing is when it starts out the saving

that's at a random Point you're not

you're not warned be sure it's not out

the same and when it does start to save

it takes half a second and then it's

done

so

the idea doesn't do anything yes yes

vaultier it's good to see you as well

but we don't have time to work yeah we

aren't anyone to do that yes

okay okay let's give it

a volunteer

sync

oh yeah and then he's going to walk

slowly

he's volt here is supposed to be quick

quick like an electric dragon

wait uh yeah it is on the other side

of course it can't be on the

you walked all the way there

and I'm waiting for this to go down

it's like a it's like a comedy

but anyway I have the chat in front of

me this time so I should be able to note

the

notice

updates

when they write stuff and when you do

redeems and stuff

prison hold square to shock the dummies

near the targets using a left and a

stick

throw the enemies into the props to

shadow

I need to play this game again why not

okay so I use this

that okay

oh you can't you can't stir them

backwards you have to

okay

it does work somewhere

you grasp the concept excellent could

just give my

way I just need my paired bubble

days after the damage and then I chase

again and then press and hold square

distracting damage with your electric

stream when they are in range defeat all

of the dummies before the time limit

expires

cable is

to go

we have the benefit of the electricity

is that it reaches further

foreign

[Music]

over here

well I did fail

everyday also

yeah this isn't going great

my design lives on the purple Power

because I've been this one

perfect thyroids I don't remember what

it's called

Perfect Two at once

okay no more you're a quick study after

all

purpose him this way oh Marv one no but

it was a thing in the way first triangle

to the electric Arc

Arch Arch no there's no age in that that

is this will entrap it

in a cage in the air run up to it and

press jump to jump up to meet it then

proceed to melee the dummy

we would we but with with which buttons

it doesn't say and of course I'm also

missing chat even though I have set it

up so I wouldn't be straight

great great work fun fun

um

Pikachu's but oh yeah right and the

electric spider because it's fine

and The Legend of Spyro electric spider

I think you started streaming right

after I rated

because your campus in the list yeah I

started 20 minutes ago I started the

Stream

so I could be back for another rain no

you don't have to do it I mean you don't

no worries don't worry about it it's

fine

hi hi

[Music]

in this game is the short and

see if I can do it

did you work it yeah it works with uh on

battery too

long time no see

yeah I don't remember when you lost here

but if we the common girl as you wish

being cute

I have considered maybe streaming

slightly earlier

by that I mean one hour maybe and but

that would overlap

then I would miss your stream

okay some of that worked

[Music]

oh wait okay so it does that okay I see

then I understand

being cute spiral come here yeah it

should be easy for me to know this at

least different place hopefully

that time

how does this work

I didn't I don't know

it's

Okay so

yes I just have to do that again

attack them

hi

sue me

this is fine

very close to see

or make it maybe I should make the chat

Lachey ah this was my favorite spiral

game is this your

I don't think that's

just

it's nice to see people having different

favorite games

the tutorial yeah stage for his powers

are

very pretty time limits

try harder yeah you have today

come over here yeah I'm here

okay so I should just do it on one of

them and then attack them okay I see

it's a really good game

I do

like which is

which which one is attacking like that

one and then I should

yeah I don't really understand how this

thing works

and that works like case

but

so many of them and

okay so I need one two

lift them up but then they need to be

hit by a second one we lock them in the

air or something

foreign

with your electric Fury

electric Theory sounds a bit strange uh

what was the other one called Flame Fury

that makes more sense

it is something uh

something on E

electrically uh

give me purple Power

thank you

I need some more proper power

okay I have

rested large enemy I guess it comes

after the Vietnamese

but this one yeah

even larger here we go

then they

need to press RTR not LT

here we go

training is complete for now oh

therefore now

yeah I guess there would be more

training because there are more powers

and then waiting for the Statue to raise

up

so yeah I wouldn't expect someone to say

this was would be one of the favorite

games

but uh as I tried to say was

it is still nice seeing people having

different favorite games actually so

it's actually nice to find someone who

do

enjoy it why

um

it just doesn't seem the ice Guardian

was taken to tall planes you won Sparks

it's a bit it's quite slow and

repetitive and uh we should run right

but it sucks

yeah

perhaps next year

just go

now yes sir

it doesn't feel like the controls

allow for

quite

could just be me being bad at the game

but

I don't feel like I have the same

control of Spyro

like I can't I can't

strategically make attacks

you Sparks

I think this was when Sierra Games took

hours I think I think I think this would

be serious well they've all been driven

underground by Cinder and her forces who

have taken over the Trap Shrine I sense

that's where Cinder is keeping silver

yeah right

never easy

nothing worthwhile ever and I wish you

didn't

so now you're spouting wisdom hero boy

come on

I don't mind Sparks talking but he's

quite a jerk in this game

um

oh God why does he look like yeah I

guess that's uh too he has quite quite

damn parents that

um

I mean his flight is terrible in this

game

that's how this fight

that's not the Sparks I know and love

yeah

I would say that the relation between

Sparks and spider has become worse and

worse of it of the games

I think you know in the first Trilogy it

was fine

and then in the force uh enter the

dragonfly

there was some moments

where they that things they weren't oh

life I guess

now I don't remember what it must put

I can eat

and then in a hairstyle it

I think it was more things

they said that I wouldn't consider

friendly

I wish I could play those games

and then and then here uh Sparks is a

complete jerk

but a beautiful day it's made

we're going to feed and play the same

time this was actually the first one I

played maybe that's why I like it and I

love seeing the just the design of all

of them

the store and everything really sunny

we are fighting and

yeah that's probably why

which is also why I like the first

spider game the best

there we go

because yeah yeah because updates buy

one first and the most

and probably why I

I enjoy it

now I want to upgrade this

yeah not I actually check these parts do

we do it no one likes the Sparks I don't

know maybe what do you think about these

parts

Liquid Fire I can do this I can probably

do that

uh

it doesn't take much damage from this

maybe I should try the electricity today

oh

I'm down

he was supposed to be my wonderful

little friend yeah

him

[Music]

okay I don't have enough breasts they

take care of last

and there's no crystals in here too

[Music]

and I can't knock those up

like I said

just continue or something

wait I got more

that's not enough

besides it

no you can't

oh I see

that's

don't step on that

yeah I prefer when he does he doesn't

talk oh dude how about spider 3 when he

can't talk but it doesn't say full words

I love this spiral but not these parts

do you yeah I fell down and the camera

is not for long

okay

I don't want to take a closer look at

him the camera doesn't want it

he's had this kind of weird

I don't know where I've got it down

this place is a mess

here's your tail strike on the Block

erase that whole time

needs strike

that it tastes right

that's more like a butt strike

okay so I need to find two more and then

I have the enemies gotten stronger or

spider weaker because a single plane

could kill them in the past

[Music]

although this is a new story yeah

yeah

he got to make lunch it sounds that

sounds nice

maybe we can share what lunch you're

making

[Music]

and this makes me want to play it again

Frederick

they still get strong as a girl I I do

get that

[Music]

but I mean yeah I guess Aspire is just

Wicked in this Trinity

[Music]

oh brother

see spice doesn't want to help on this

he just comes up yeah I think that

myself

I didn't want to do that

I can't do this

wait where did you go

but my power

no I didn't get it anyway that's good

[Music]

I was just trying to help world yet

lower and Kane need no help oh just

about to spring into action huh forget

this guy Spyro come on

what did they want with you anyway it's

none of your business now move I've got

a tribe to save

oh you're welcome

can't Sparks that's how it feels like

when yours is a jerk and see now when

someone is a shark

another one I said Jack I wonder if

you're going to laugh on this no of

course

don't eat me where's the that's the

button

don't worry

not that inflict

ions it takes him out

I got this game on Xbox I might play

this game again that would be fun

we're going to stream that

see how you do it

different strategies given an eye on the

leveling up

I think

though

well

maybe I'm dumb here or something

but that was the wrong thing

goodbye

[Music]

here we go and the

redeem messages

like

in the list of redeems I have it's

working now that's good

like

came from there

I turned in there so I guess I just

continue here

we have

only full house again yeah of course you

are now you could fall down

I took four damage

interesting

[Music]

let's do something here

got Crystal's here

that's nice

he's a bit weird when those animals

doesn't try to play

this looks suspicious

let's guess I have to run

yep

wait what's there

is that also one

I guess I could just do this that's the

problem yeah this isn't there that's not

the stop Flying button anymore

foreign

explosion

I'm not really good at it but I will try

yeah it doesn't look like I'm good at

this

like currently I'm very confused of what

I'm supposed to do but I guess if I

press this one

even though I don't need to

it will open a secret

message

don't you have to go around

Miguel

steps

and over here

watching out for dancing and now I'm up

here again where am I supposed to go

across that Lodge

and I really can't do it from this one

why am I messing around so much

is why couldn't one of those below which

I could get up that way

and as I forgot that that's a positive

because

a lot of times the

leaves like that are invisible walls

[Music]

I guess I mean eyes yeah exactly this is

a different part

if you go over it instead of stupid oh

the enemies

let's see how what is this

nice

they are weak to fight

I mean who is

[Music]

they actually contain stuff this time

I've destroyed a lot of these without

complaining anything

okay more of these

who did the attack

[Applause]

okay that's those taken care of

those hurts to land them

has that party mode

think it

came before I go

make sure to upgrade the fire

and it didn't reach the next level

I don't need to deal with you okay

students

[Applause]

hey attack me from behind

that's not fair

with me standing far away and sending

boss of fired at this way

[Music]

can you fall down please

oh you don't have much health left

okay this looks like a button let's

press it

it's not very present

this is how

there's another button

it's our same designer or apparently it

is

interesting

more batteries

Vietnam

now I'm paying attention to the chat

I was bad at it

last time

there's nothing up there as far as I can

see

yo I guess I'll try this

practice

and that worked

The Sounds they make they sound so I

don't know

weird

yeah come on

yeah I knew something was up with that

because it might be something down there

that's the same

well I guess um okay do you know that

now you've asked him down

are you laughing at me

how would you

do they sound creepy

they are creepy

oh

thank you for demonstrating how this

thing worked

and why what did my double jump again

okay it would be easy if you didn't

stand at the edge foreign

there we go

there was nothing to create action

[Music]

he sure had the Magic Touch

we missed

you missed again

[Applause]

all right

you haven't took that much from that you

didn't

you should write five pretty good

just continue

a rock Mustang do you survive fire

not that one

apparently fire is strong against Rock

I shall remember that

now he had a theory of

eastlanders Final Stand

what is that

since I haven't

no idea how this works but if I upgrade

it it might be better perhaps maybe

we'll see

because it's pretty bad at the moment

I don't like this bridge

can I go here instead

oh that's close

okay oh here here come

they are coming

[Music]

[Applause]

all right epic damage

yeah

okay

I guess this bridge is safe three of

them demonstrated it but was safe

it's running there

oh no that's one of those it is

[Music]

wrong way

[Music]

I see moving so slow there you go

okay

maybe I shouldn't says okay yeah

annoying at the moment

open it

just about it I just want to kill you

can you just let me please

save the first time Bridges oh

can he run a bit straighter please

okay we got another rock thing here

okay I'm doing that created moment

foreign

that's very nice of you

that is fantasy see you here

any funny words

there we go

do I need to climb this thing no there's

not Bridge

so I don't need to climb this thing

looks interesting I do want to climb it

Sparks wants something here

good place parks

yeah I don't know what he wants for a

second I can't do anything about this I

mean I can try to do this

but I didn't do anything

let's just continue

[Applause]

okay

what

hey

I got through I didn't mean anything

let's party

oh you're not allowing me to escape

but there's nothing to escape too yes

you know

and you're not allowing me to progress

that makes more sense well done

thank you Simi

easily

I guess this product is easy

I don't know

okay with something

and it might I might marry each time I

say it as well

foreign

[Music]

ones

that works

the way you say my name is adorable oh

easy me

thank you

that's a cat box by the way

another way of combination of a feline

and a uh candid

foreign

circles

come on fell down

okay

that's useful but I don't get the gems

so I still have to go down and get those

if I want them

nice going there

I don't I don't mind going around a few

more laps

the enemy died from that

huh

I accept it

but now I miss the gems again

I want the blue jets

foreign

[Music]

spikes

I really wish they could jump up I mean

if I like

it clear a level I should be able to

jump up tonight

[Music]

you understand him help me to do one

level that's fine

[Applause]

walking is important okay okay but I

think jumping is important too

I can't find me now

one-on-one

let me ask power up first

[Music]

I think one of this is

that's pretty well

can I do again

now I'm free to go back to that place

that doesn't lean anywhere thank you

yeah I don't get that one

but I can also proceed which is of

course my product another one of these

why do they need these

this grand entrance

you're not that special

no I'm playing here yeah exactly take

damage

stop attacking me

oh you didn't die

however I am a boss hi

at least I got a lot from that one

[Music]

and here we go here's on the box second

gets back Health mom and some enemies

too

foreign

all right

one oh wow

I destroyed the bridge

it's how am I supposed to cross now

all the stuff up there

and one thing

unless I can climb this thing

because I could climb here

no I don't see anywhere to go after me

[Music]

that is more here

over here okay

like two different voices for me

okay can I get there there now

yeah

what's

this

oh you missed

that works

look at that bridge she's still

not to destroyed so I can get across

this one

unless the sides the store hit

as soon as I step on it

you can understand so far

oh

this looks like

use the water wheels to move ahead how

do you know

oh it's never easy I mean it looks easy

but

but how how do you know

all right

did you break it

it's broken now

okay it's the same as you should press

these

oh hello are you coming to greet me

where did you come from

actually

and another one

this place doesn't look

a good place to use fire

this this looks to be

I don't think you can burn easily by

using

a hundreds for six seconds

yes I have been hydrating a lot sir

you know how to do it again just be sure

[Applause]

I got that redeem down

I really want like some kind of my audio

notification

there we go hydrate

yeah that was a little bit wrong

oh I see I was supposed to stand on that

platform so I can get up

[Applause]

the puzzle is basically press the button

to continue the level

there you go

another one of these

thank you

audio plays even though it's destroyed

so I'm gonna please come

here they come again

[Applause]

goodbye

[Applause]

yeah and then I get the gems that's good

oh

oh

I mean obviously common enemies when I

press the button so I'm not sure why

this one because it's a different

different enemies sure but

it's not like they had a small cat or

unless I missed it for some reason

didn't have a small cut scene when the

first enemies came which was technically

new enemies

a different kind

but there is that the one I heard okay

all right all right

no don't don't fall down

now you have to go around and go back up

again

message yes

[Music]

there you go goodbye

yeah I didn't have to help jump down for

that

I said it was two of them

you can't shoot me

I found that all the way

thank you

well that's that taking care oh no

another one

there's push more buttons

peace to come from nothing

yeah so many of them

yeah

it is

break some ancient faces

make sure I level up

second level

it doesn't Chase it

but maybe I should see what it does now

do I need to find another button oh

there it is

button found

see what it does now

okay definitely since

[Applause]

no I need another button

why it is the last after that I pressed

that one

oh there it is

yeah you don't have to reacted

too often

thank you

this is

oh

did you survive that

[Music]

okay

step back a bit

hydrate

there you can't hit give us that on you

like it barely

hydrate

no that's taken care of

how does

[Applause]

oh yeah

[Applause]

no don't divide it down

[Applause]

don't drown

okay we're gonna see everything

okay I guess this one

yeah see they wait

you're doing great pumpkin thank you I

am actually

doing better today than yesterday

maybe I'm new to the game yesterday and

more familiar with game now so I missed

this one

I do try to vary stuff to check at you

but

I often end up doing a lot of the same

thing yeah see what you got yourself

into

[Applause]

yeah he needs a cane now

[Music]

you have learned the ice cream breath

okay

no I don't have that that's upgrade

that's a shame

press down to select I settlement in the

future you can open his price further

in the level up screen

leave the ice Guardian cereal

retired fairness

so basically what triangle attack

um

spoilers

yeah I haven't really paid attention

maybe to see that said I was supposed to

foreign

[Applause]

yeah here thank you

[Applause]

yeah it definitely disappeared

[Applause]

keep up the good work

I think I expressed can be useful if it

was Stronger

so

yeah this is not quite a rich one 11.

but he's close

it's I didn't expect to get that yes

this is like the first step that is

Quick Stop grid

come on

you're dead

remember this animation

it's hard to tell me something

well they are guarding this thing

you can

[Music]

I mean now I must have enough Champion I

still get upgraded

it up

let's try that then

that's not nice

to

figure a stun

[Music]

aren't they three

this is the third one

no no

[Music]

spider died

again if your life works like that eh

inspired diet is due to a phone even

though he has wings

[Applause]

yeah sure

throw those things far

and I always fall down again

[Music]

okay

there's something about you

ah

it worked pretty great on this one

did you have to walk down

[Music]

but I'm using ice on it

spider died again

let's keep trying yeah if I had a life

you can

I wanted

I don't remember when I died in the

biggest thing

[Music]

poor spider

what's that uh yes we're freezing

thank you

oops

all right let's do it

okay let's do this

let's do this foreign

the third time now maybe

this is how you defeat this

is too easy

you set a thing up here

there's something here

guess

that it was not a bit confused here

yeah

oh

are you supposed to go through this to

this side at least I think

and I just jumped over everything

and I guess there wasn't anything else

here

yeah going over it doesn't help

so let's continue through this Forest

oh what's going on here

I need to take care of this one first

and today I also thank you so anything

but I can just walk on me

foreign

yeah how about they don't

[Music]

so I can't destroy that platform that

would have been fun if I could

not get

blasted by your own

seems like a good idea to

avoid your own explosion

another one of those

okay I used to dodge like that okay like

okay

Mr this is an option

foreign

ah

a

I touch backwards and Dutch boys yeah

Dark Souls fire it's the whole

dodging attacks

and attacking

when the opponent is busy

but

that was nice

how about

how about with it look out world

[Music]

oh

my God

let's do it

yeah or I'll just do this

that doesn't even have to worry about

dodging attack we kind of feel like I'm

missing part of the game

I want a dodging and attracting

if all I had to do is of the attack

and never touch

and if I have

so I can't do that if there's just one

enemy but if there's two that really the

option

but if there's two I can also not just

try to touch anything because they are

doing attacks

the problem just disappeared I heard it

now

as you see oh no more I haven't even got

to read the free enemy here are you send

me more

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

and I'm about to die

oh you didn't die for me

goodbye

we have this on here

a few of these

okay they're just respawning

I mean I am guessing nowhere here now I

saw that it's full

perfect

oh why are you starting my crystals

permission

I touched too early

thank you

I find it weird how they can do their

attack and I think I have the strength

to go on then do the and then they get

stunned

they do the attack and then they

realize that all right it was supposed

to get stunned

thank you

okay the big enemy taking care of

and the tunnels are now open

[Music]

the invisible walls

not letting me proceed

yeah it must be tasty what is this anime

and why isn't this

you mean button so I can look

you don't like the look of these

[Music]

it was fine

[Music]

okay I'm not the battle are either

I assume

they can

go again why don't you get out of here

and leave me in peace I'm the Bossier

nobody else boss of what you're all

alone lonely until I kick these bums out

which reminds me I can't stand here

chatting with purple dragons and

mosquitoes hey whoa whoa Who you calling

a mosquito besides

oh concerned about our welfare now no

need we can take care of ourselves

anyway we need to get to the shrine

and now spax is

doesn't feel great about being insulted

maybe you should consider

when he insults others

now he will never learn

that's not too easy

hmm interesting shape

something tells me something to go in

that

[Music]

wow

[Music]

it is quite of a labyrinth that looks

like an accident

that might get up

might be able to terminated

stretches here

the treasure means nothing because it

only gave me

purple green and red which I have maxed

out at the moment so

yeah I still haven't used tea

the ultra attack the remote code flame

Fury

it has a place like this doesn't give

you much

place to fight

[Music]

so many Treasures up here

foreign

[Music]

ooh Treasures

okay

there is something with those

maybe this [ __ ] has to answer

look

boss maybe another one outside

it looks like

This is

Love suggestion yeah

if you give me treasure I will love it

that is a gift

I would treasure see that's a good joke

so this fall damage in this game

that's a bit silly

and let's play football

I mean I don't think that's but

magnetic balls of stone can you kick it

or we can

that's far I mean they're quite heavy

oh

there we go

funny

I'm glad you think so

I'm happy to be funny

wrong one for sure

I can't charge with them

it makes sense I guess

okay then that yes I need to get this

out from here

there you go it's cute

it's funny being cute it's cute being

funny

wait

I think it was a Hitler

she's being funny now this wasn't the

way I should bring them around away so

that was a waste of time

yeah

okay can you

cooperate with me here

it was outside here yeah

a nice head bathroom spiral and it lands

in the theme

which last one

where is there okay I went the wrong way

foreign

[Music]

there we go that's the score

that's Square four zero

and Kane means a cane

he's standing over there

well since it doesn't seem to be any

more enemies

I guess I'll just get these crystals

and also I must make sure I don't

press one too many thanks

this game you press triangle to go back

and I guess that's the whole Topic in

itself

if you want to hear something

interesting when the first

when they place it no it's only two

people I don't know who to you too are

it's kitten is one of them and the other

one is like

Izumi it's about 100 wrote last

yeah otherwise it might be odinian

but it could be anyone

I mean

maybe maybe

lonely still lucky

but it isn't

to meet others one left there

to be concerned

for first left

Earth Cannon it's actually a stone

Cannon

you mean

it is made of stone and shoes wood

I think there's a good opportunity

I need to climb up this thing anyway so

hi hi kitten

and here you are here yeah our almost

out is here yeah but I mean is the

second one then

cannon fire Stones now it has like a

some kind of wooden

structure on it

and why is it smoky

what part of stone is smoking it's so

heavily this

dude

the shrine God has not been appeased

since cinder's forces came he is not

happy

so is anybody fun around here you can't

possibly face the god of the shrine

alone

[Music]

not all of us are loners

I'm not going alone

well maybe someday you'll learn that two

heads are better than one

even if they are pinheads yeah what

a chinga

see they are kind of roots against each

other

let's put these plants

oh here we go here's a close-up spire

it's quite Dotty

who are you calling a pinhead

yeah Sparks

obviously

look at this Manchester expire

look at those platforms

unless you can stand on this and then I

can get that back

I'm not sure I like the looks of this

thing

now you tell

thank you I landed on Oxford there's

nothing

they could have made it an achievements

or something

oh this thing

yeah the music changed

hey

[Music]

right now

that's not nice

[Music]

but you're still alive

Staying Alive

oh no

using our firing a wooden boat

I guess maybe maybe you got about

another [ __ ] I don't know it's a flying

boat

all right

but it has certain parts so it's okay

now it's good it's more wood

but it seems to have a stone outside

and this must be Stone

knock their eyes twister

a liter of crystal

okay

he checked my he only has a certain

distance even though it seems to reach

longer

Anna don't destroy

even though I did stand one opponent

into the other one

it looks so weak

Just Bounce Off

yeah that doesn't seem safe on this boat

you call it

time

to remember my training still on fire

okay I have to start over now

I didn't really reset everything

foreign

I think that

this fire doesn't have spire

foreign

it doesn't look good now does it

oh yeah

oh yeah

[Music]

we go

okay so I

knocked them off I just have to be

actually not knock myself off

[Music]

the presidency

are you touching

and why are you touching

foreign

back

come from two minutes

actually works but

doesn't

like him

okay phase two

foreign

but

oh yeah can you face two I assume that

this celebration was because the did I

just check my

uh yeah it's already maxed out

the

leveling up power thingy

can I use

can I use this back

went down the boat

okay

yeah it's fine

foreign

[Music]

but now it's even more fire everywhere

let's stop killing them

foreign

[Music]

Tracer that's an interesting

[ __ ]

sounds like horse running

last time we lost we lost him on the

hand

warm shifting

sounds like a weak animal to shoot

let's track you

yeah let me help you finding your dress

there yeah

Long play

okay

three quarter another streak wandering

one thing around the streaking at the

same time

fracking in the dark okay now

oh bye

foreign

they have so much health

you press the wrong button

I'm going to press the other button

all right

let's see okay if I actually took quite

a bit of damage yeah

if you miss the enemy

don't die don't die

he died

the one thing you weren't supposed to do

dying

foreign

[Music]

leveling up stuff so

okay one more try

one more try

okay stop hitting me

hit lifts hard yeah hey

here here's the next difficulty spot in

the game

but I'm not uh um

I'm not here to give up yet

stay for the exciting battle of

this game

I mean this is actually our channels I

mean I love that kind of control so like

I mean the gameplay is fine it's just

based on their repetitive side

and I don't

feel like

that's why I want to like play through

this game so I can play the second

episode Game and see we got the first

like

say this

nice Miss

and I know the first fire game isn't

great

and they did improve on it for the

second I know it's sickness of games are

technically

improved over the second game of the

first part again

even though I like the first part again

regardless

but and yeah and I expect

to see similar improvements of The

Legend of Spyro

so

come on guys

foreign

he's probably more efficient against a

group of enemies than I guess a single

one

I was hitting him how are you hitting me

do you think it's done but he's getting

hit

thank you

foreign

who hate that

okay phase one done

not much left of this boat

a moon pal

are you back in the Moon

that's hardcore

okay nice

but I guess

the great part

aren't part is great

thank you are doing the cave

yeah this isn't looking good for the

boat

okay

I haven't deal with you all right now

you're right

yeah if you just know if you stand away

and like historic bombs

that would actually be really good

yeah okay for me

okay so I should use the fireballs

I can't think I should start from the

side space please

okay up there for some reason

I'm hitting it

[Music]

cold warm you know so many of them

but this is probably the second one that

has a worming name it's worm why would

you want probably somewhere

[Music]

what's your name rotten worm

name

silent eyes

or you I guess you could read this

silent this but I mean it must be silent

eyes because it's like a team where's

put together

foreign

or something like that

oh yeah and then there happens to be a

city in your case with that spelling

called its Bridge

foreign

manage to do it correctly

so not like that

like that

yeah there you go let's throw some bumps

oh

okay

maybe it's something after this can you

stop doing that the last like half my

heels

it didn't take any damage

what's going on okay they finally took

some damage

say you're the last one please I mean I

said no please don't spawn another one

of course

actually that's the last one

would be easier to deal with it now

no no stay back

I like I like money attack it doesn't

connect

all right

damn that was a nice dancing

okay please don't come like your face

for now let's say this is the end

and the end to this boat I'll be around

now just above

I'm going to die from smoking Iration

yeah this

this boats

this boat will fall apart

I was well

I mean it was kind of fun actually

actually getting a real challenge

fireworks I don't still have any

fireworks I don't think my computer

wouldn't be able to handle the effects

like that

I did have the idea of any like

apparently it's it's fireworks it's like

a crowd sharing or something it should

probably be a crowd of bunnies steering

I also consider having like a

stampede of bunnies going across or

something but then maybe that should be

like the transition screen

but

I don't even know how I would do custom

transitions like that I know several

people have maybe this OBS plugin today

because there is the fade transition

but I'm like I just want like a bunny

Stampede transition that'll be cute

okay there's two parts here

just

I mean

can't I just did this

okay this is

maybe this is the correct pass

ing foreign

on fun faces okay did I press this

okay

it still feels like I'm going the

correct way

um

the boat is

a strawberry that enemy was named

Shrubbery oh

yeah I thought it meant like a horde of

bunnies is a strawberry first

up

okay

thank you

my kids reader from describe thank you

not

come on spider you haven't seen anything

I want to know if I'm supposed to go

this way

there's a button here so I guess this

must be great for me anyway

but this seems to be to leave all right

right

keep pressing the wrong button

oh

okay we got the frostbone

horse bone I meant weave Rambo how many

weed rambling on the bed you don't even

happy I didn't even know what impurities

[Music]

that enemy was named Strawberry you

should capture it for the king who says

knee

I haven't really watched that thing

[Music]

King

night I can't read

[Music]

though

thank you for punish is called a Bluff

phone yeah but I said

it's worn like a group of a certain

animal

s

no I said a stampede

that was the word I used do you want

[Music]

what is a stampede of money Scouts

[Music]

thank you

a whole wide assistant

it died

anyway hey

don't show where I'm going

we love seconds

do you want that Thicket

you require two tickets to enter this

area

funny marriage sounds like a Navy final

skirt

came straight from Skyrim

yeah Skyrim is an old game but it's not

this old is it

yeah because game is up is like the next

generation of concerns yeah but this

game must be all there I assume like

quickly

possible you think just pick me

[Applause]

inside me

[Applause]

go

yeah and they have two-sided Collision

but okay

[Applause]

[Applause]

I am

now doing some

out of bounds

okay I guess at least I have to die I

can't die

hey wait

this is why you don't have two sided

conditions in games by the way

[Applause]

a group of cats are cloudy yeah this

game is only by two generations two

generations this game is from

PlayStation 2 and scaring me some

pleasing me

so that would be one generation

so good that I mean

all right same data

as you say loading data

in the year of the dragon you know wait

did I press a new game

they do that really

am I stupid

hour at PS1 if this would be PS1

graphics

I didn't really have to

change the connection it's because I

first there is the restart

oh I read and edit

I'm not sure

I mean it does say let's just buy one

piece too so I could see

see what you mean oh I did actually go

down and press new game so

oh well uh

and there's a

save states on the on the PS

I would

yep

that will be a two-hour stream

I could

play

whatever it's

so another idea

is that

inside I've already played through this

game

and also I need to do glitchy

how about just skipping straight to the

second

Legend of fire instead I think I have it

on the consoles

yeah I should rather play the uh

nationality at

a policeman

I also need to add the uh

dog's life which I should play tomorrow

and then

they're also quite tired too I really

need to I did consider moving this

stream one hour or two hours earlier

because

it is I'm doing actually this was more

of a test during this stream this late

but

yeah problem is I'm

of course getting quite tired

and so I can't

uh

started hard for me to stay awake

I feel like

Dancing Yeah yeah that's awesome it's

getting quite dark too

but I do have one hour left of streaming

now

how about

try

a different game sleepy Pawn

on

a game that

did I is this the original

probably

yeah let me copy that

and now come I have connected the cable

yet

sleepy bun yeah I'm too sleeping

I'm a bit sleepy I'll probably already

did that that's how sleepy I am no no

that's sleepy pumpkin

I need it was a different message why

does the game make you see When

selecting a new game anyway yeah I was

going to say that and that's also a bad

design because the original

a Playstation One games didn't say when

you selected a new game uh and like I

know Pokemon doesn't save when you

select a new game

and

um

so

I just need to do some modifications

here because

otherwise this is going to be it's still

going to be quite tricky but

and then I should bring this game up on

screen just in a moment

okay there was a few more numbers yeah I

would have prepared this but this is

going to be a

extra stream anyway

this number seems a bit weird

okay there we go

and now start the game

and that's yeah I'm gonna need to move

over the headphones

why did it

oh the game started full screen

I thought what came it was me how do I

change that

why did the concepts that

I turn the console off

apparently pressing name power button

doesn't do it

how do I set this game not in full

screen

because otherwise I can't

see the chat and stuff

and that's not maybe I can change it in

the settings in the game

options

full screen ah here we go

and then I could do a bit higher

resolution

there we go

let me

bring this green window up on screen

that

source

and every height

it really shouldn't

load the source immediately because I

really should select window

before it shows it on screen

actually don't know if it showed it

immediately on screen or not but

just assume

and there's also sound to this game so

I really should only have one source

and there we go

it's usually doesn't play the sound

unless I select the window

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

I'm gonna start the game and see

because it's supposed to have music

[Music]

nothing

the music is there oh wait

yeah okay now I hear it is it

okay okay

[Music]

and it's quite loud of course okay the

music is that yeah I just didn't hear it

on my computer that was nice so uh why

did normally new game is starting

exactly well I guess being five hour

hours is a tip

I have completed before so

kind of loud

I didn't care too much and honestly

do you fun

jump start econometer exactly that's

what I'm trying to fix

that's the wrong way

is this better in body

and now the control is working perfect

so would you like to continue now let's

start from beginning

much better okay so we got one watches

what's up before and then just drop down

to one again why is

twitch messing with me now

because I should preferably select the

correct and game I'm streaming on Twitch

but uh it had no problem giving me all

the games with hamster

but it's not giving me a single game

with hamster ball

it doesn't give me anything at the

moment

okay I guess I'll just leave it blank

instead

so it's a simple game

and I said where did kitty go kitten

where are you I mean or even if it's

piping so he must be the single watcher

videos leave as soon as I was in place

by anymore

so

in this game you are a hamster

in a ball

and that's why it's called hamster ball

lemons

last episode

but he wouldn't just leave it

[Music]

now

interesting

I did too

all right go around

is that this game has quite this the

time limit and I'm not that great at the

game okay and not see me fail at the

same level over and over again I

doubled the times

for each level

it is easy in the beginning of course

it will be

intermediate race now that's time I'm

not sure why I didn't do that last time

last time I just reset the timing

away with you eight ball

I don't know okay I'm just confused

now

[Music]

a nice game yeah there we have you now

it says poor again

yeah I can't trust twitch

welcome back I'm back where was you

where were you and where did you

and why did you bring two watches with

you the weather is crazy oh you have a

problem with like

internet connection

thank you

it is possible that the game has uh

paint safe where it doesn't add

whoops

[Music]

because it's supposed to add the level

time to the next level on your plane so

you keep your time and then it adds to

that time

and I can assume

it

I know

I don't know that was so quick I can

assume the uh

doesn't do that if the 11th time is 100

or high

first one is 120 started so since I

doubled it first it's 120 the second one

is a hundred but that means that means

that one level is 110 now I'm gonna

reset it

yum yum

also I don't care if the mouse mouse

cares is showing on the screen yeah it

can it is a cute game

it's only not where I'm a rabbit Ball

but it is is hamstable

at least hamsters are

like second best

nah maybe kittens are second list

I don't know because let's go

how many how many times since I'm dying

oh my

God I mean grab itself that sounds

important rabbits are obviously the best

you want to ask me

that's

that's now

question about it

and the music is interesting in the game

too

but oh that's no that was boss

apparently

well click pause button I guess

boxed

the oppress but what does the cursor set

the operation this is an interesting

place

and that is the time with ads it came

with 30 seconds that is

double what it normally gives me which

is 15 seconds

do you have like

over three minutes at the moment three

and a half minutes

it will be

late now it's gonna be harder

I will need that time

because if the timer runs out the whole

I was so close excuse me every time

around South the game is over so oh I

got up a bit

Sonic now

Sonic clip thingy

I can move this back side out

isn't it

neon race

and those are some bright rainings

and even the bar has some brightness

around it

well that wasn't a really

I'm not sure why I trusted it

this is already

oh oh I see

yep

that was a small enough job

I wasn't trying to get for it but

I'm not sure well since

oh oh nice

well oh it's speeding up very quickly

Allison

at least you get a lot of checkpoints in

this game

level

the ears are weird thing at the bottom

of it it's like an m

and a combined

expertise let's go

[Music]

with experts or just to raise music

heavy music

yeah here is when I need the time right

now stay in your halfway

it sure

quite nice with those

sometimes

should really replace you

and I picked their own sightsee

with the correct side but again got

sliced

not the best score but

I don't think I don't think that matters

so level complete

Padres okay this sounds interesting good

score

I'm keeping it over it to 200 seconds

that's good

oh yeah all right

let me I go this way

now it's killer world

then I just go up on the side of the

devil like this

oh I'm small eight ball

why was it smart

yeah whip now let's define this is

quite these strange levels

and now I'm also Smiles now it makes

sense that there is a

there you go you trick it off

but you killed eight ball

I think I killed the second night party

ding

and there's the sideways goal

I did it

nice going

to brace

I had two brace this is well yeah two

bracer

yay

cheer

I should get into that hole

why are you blocking my way

running away

another baseball

okay sure

okay okay come step

bouncing around

the the hamster gets a very dizzy yeah

that's how I stopped at Corners I fall

off

there was another path I kept making

wish would have been easier

okay this wasn't too hard but I am up

what instead of 11. but

I think I should to get about

the cheese getting to get somewhere over

200 in the next

in this wobbly race

that is

not blessings

now

yeah probably things is they can't

respond respond on them I like this one

thing better I take that back

move up please go

I guilt

and it went well

yeah here's when I need that extra time

[Music]

bye I did that for

yeah that's the response I was going to

ask what's the point

nope

this

isn't easy don't climb up nope

thank you

yeah hey can I respond

there we go finally

don't mess this up

yeah no not going to be

class raise

okay this looks

see

them under 200 seconds now

[Music]

let's start by falling off

this is like basically like ice

oh I did

oh

[Music]

it is hard to stop on this

you didn't respond really quickly

no I don't get us 10 points whatever

that is

and also not

yeah going down this going down the

funniest days yeah sometimes it feels

Wicked yes rushed this level and let's

die let's respond so quickly

if is it ice level

it is ice level

guy rate

I know

theme Parts I don't like this

goodbye

now

notes

the hamster exploded

it was a quick test

let me do

thank you

yeah we gave it permission too

such a thing

yeah I travel staying on the track

[Music]

I was going to ask what was the point of

that

was the point of that

that couldn't stay on the track so

didn't do anything to me

just send out more

managed to land on the path which I

assume is just decoration

it means left

explosion by that last thing and

magnifying glass I think it's called

a master race

and hydration

I need this for the masteries

and now it can add to it on the 110th

yeah I don't get this game sometimes

thank you for the hydrate which I did

anyway

you're so smart

I don't know if I'm smart

well it worked

tap it stop it

but I got rid of it

no

something tells me I'm not supposed to

go there and I was saying with the flags

and things

just there to trick me

how about that

I know

Danny and I did that thank you

I didn't even need it

always

I was hoping it was tilted so I could

just follow it along

oh okay

there's like a bonus Arena

every level

maybe not the first three I think you

unlock those that's by default

but every level beyond that

[Music]

I guess that's another challenge to

actually find them

everyone knows that that eight balls are

the natural enemy of the hamster yeah

place an eight ball oh what's this all

I thought it would be more levels

impossible I see now I need the timer

because this level is impossible that's

what it says

um

oh I don't get checkpoints on one square

with me

[Music]

bounce Undercover

ready yet we're not the one in the next

time one or something

I will be right back

there we go at least I got this

checkpoint there

no no no why don't we break back I

probably won't be here when you end this

stream I got a pack to pick you up

downstairs and set up but the bus could

sing a Pom-Pom and you wish you would

have fun like seeing you playing games

they're so great

okay uh yeah it was amazing to have you

here too and I was fantasy right I have

um yeah

happy

birthday

[Music]

yeah I need a time of this section

these

is

finally I did it

okay

that's so impossible is it

this looks like a very possible level

wait what what

Sam is supposed to clip on the other

side of this yeah like that okay

whoop

so this is Sky erase but

not much space to be on

and now checkpoints of course

I'm trying to get slow

because there's no weapon now everything

crosses came

well well well you can't even go slow is

it seriously enough it won't snow about

them or something that's passing fast

pass

because I'm trying to make this look

slowly but

yeah I promise that you cannot speak up

by this

[Music]

now

slow concentration smelling

when I got that far down

now that I would like because that makes

it easy

foreign

it was impossible I guess

bomb porn is my name

last

well I got that part

yeah I lost the time I know you need to

roll back okay run back

I could give it another try

all right let's get there yeah bye

[Music]

yeah I'm just dreaming

duck's life

on tomorrow

then they would be now let's play play

the second station of Spider-Man's now

next

Thursday Friday

okay I can recap attention by one no

I don't know if you want to

there's only in here currently I think

lonely right there

you know I I don't know if you can trust

twitch I mean it said he said one before

and then one

yeah I don't know

and then when they

start there

and then my kitten showed up again it's

jumped up to four of a sudden

as far as I know how are you even

supposed to do this

with that

and all of a sudden it worked

so yeah I don't know if there's any

skill involved in that

yeah I'm doing terrible as

so

all right it asked me if I wanted to

continue I don't want to continue

I wanted to find the secret Areas

instead

as I got more time

so the first three doesn't have one

doesn't mean there's this level is even

so short so they don't even have place

to put it that way

now

got rid of the bond the eight ball

at least the game wasn't live when it

said level is it possible

yeah

and then intermed idiot it's the last

one of those I don't have any areas at

start

this skill required for that last level

is a bit too short for that kind of

final level

and the controls are way too finicky to

you

by that kind of level design I think

that's

because you just don't have that fine

control when using it gonna controller

when it went better that's when I was

using the mouse

the I used a mouse control the hamster

okay this is the first level that

actually has an area turnout so let's

see if I can find it

I mean it could be anywhere but let's

first

find anything that looks suspicious

that's a good start

like something like this

or like this

but it should probably be something

that's highlighted

[Music]

something

bouncing out of the ordinary that way

I did see something down here before

which is this lack of raining here

so can I press a board race and then

[Music]

yes I want to do that

it's always the same yes and then you

have the

party games

exactly you get to keep it

it's good but that's not the back button

how do I exit but that's a good way to

go back now I will continue and then I

just complete this and level as fast as

I can

foreign

[Music]

mix but I could still do it for a second

completion

because I don't know it's gonna be fun

splice

just

I'm filling out this three hour stream

okay

there we go let's see if I can find it

in the tower race

and a lot of these levels do have two

starting positions

and that's well basically for the two

player mode

you can race against someone

this looks suspicious

this exercise

90 left suspicious enough apparently

this looks suspicious

but there's something there

then I need to take this part

it's like suspicious what

I was kind of things that is that

yes

it doesn't click like it's

I mean I can ask him back there

card

nothing interesting out of doing an

ordinary day

let's continue

this is good so

out here

that camera doesn't finish photos

here

okay finding this one might be actually

it must be somewhere the camera actually

can't go I would assume

I mean it's certainly can't be behind

here that would be true

well I guess I missed something

suspicious I mean I think this is very

suspicious looking

I can't probably have to start over

what kind of thing did I miss

[Music]

I mean I could just try rolling off

everywhere but that's not fun

I'll send it over here she could put

something there

over there

and now I'm basically doing what I save

and be fun

at least you could not get penalty time

I think the game should have that

many possibility

it would be if it's somewhere here or

something

[Music]

I guess not

Jackie

thank you

and you can't exit there and I'll check

that place

they don't want the other direction that

there's nothing

nothing here out of the ordinary

I I did this no no

okay if it I just need to take this part

[Music]

third case would be if there's something

here

I mean

this would be off here for example you

would accidentally find it but just go

into level normally I guess you could

argue

[Music]

this thing big snap

I mean certainly it can't be here

because this is too close to the ground

now she's like a checked everywhere

[Music]

all right

and can't really find anything and

like you should be here

wait why did you spot me up here okay

I wonder if it's based on high so if

they have some kind of kill sounds or

something

if you go

through a kill so you will die when you

land regardless

[Music]

yeah yeah I don't think I'll find this

to go through

another thing it would be interested

here

should appearancing more to change

this wasn't as fun as I thought

these two how hard it is to find this

yeah I mean it can't really

oh [ __ ]

I guess that's one way of getting out

yeah

nobody have any time

I can't really find it

yeah if they're going to be that

difficulty

but anyway

let's regardless

let's just

yeah I shouldn't stream it if I go to

it's late eight days late in teeth I

should sleep and it's not even the full

thing I was just yet yeah I really need

to move this stream earlier

uh like should I but the problem is it

this stream is like right after a lolly

streams and I do like to watch her

streams I'm not sure why it's there's

red but it's transmitting a full quality

but it's actually dropping frames now

I'm not even doing anything I close the

game

I guess technically these things open

between the training performance

this is for a controller that doesn't

matter

I guess this internet here isn't perfect

okay now stop dropping frames

no no it's background again dropping

frames not sure what's going on

so well yeah let's uh

played our livestock's live tomorrow

uh times written here

it's not summertime it's not between

those days so after that day so

everything is valid

yeah you have your time still there

you're the only one here

oh thank you you are here why doesn't

I have no idea why it doesn't say he

confuses me

How can there be two people the right

thing and it says there's one watching

I'm confused

I should never get dressed since twitch

it gives an estimation I guess I have

plus minus one I don't I don't know why

it can't be accurate

does it say one Watcher for you or

something I don't know

yeah I want to share this one on my

screen yeah exactly and it's obviously

you're obviously two people here

I've been there all the time yeah I was

I was wondering if you had left

you sure

you two are one per your half a person

each

yeah I'm confused oh My Ghost oh yeah

you're a ghost

oh well

um

it's just my legs are watching

at

at what

that comment confused me

how how does that work

so um

yeah

I would go to bed now I'm going back bed

luck because I'm half a person oh yeah

and uh okay so just legs

makes more sense for like the upper part

where you have

eyes to watch which yeah

regardless

tomorrow dog's life

and I'll figure out what to do it

spiral Legend of spiral for next

Saturday Friday

yeah that was pretty silly

you were too silly for me I I'm probably

just too tired at the moment

okay yeah so

so yeah

I don't know what I should do

well I should end this stream but

yeah bye bye

yeah I need to go to bed myself

bye-bye thank you for watching and thank

you for being here all the time as well

even though twitch didn't want to

recognize it

uh it does

which kinda

because it is nice to know that people

are watching and that's why it's

annoying when it doesn't when twitch

gives me the wrong number

and like yeah origin is typing and it

says one person okay in that case LOL I

have left but apparently not

and sure I can hide the number but it's

still relevant when it says I'm watching

10 watches in that case it's not

it's this one it's so few people that

but I guess I just have to remember that

I just can't add plus one or plus two or

something

anyway

um

technical details aside

that's that's me when I get tired I just

play a lot of random things

yeah I better end this thing now

bye bye
