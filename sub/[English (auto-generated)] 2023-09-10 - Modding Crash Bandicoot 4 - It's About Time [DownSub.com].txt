hello my beautiful

be inside us now

I don't know

my beautiful

pause

oh okay that's how we're starting off

really

well let me

all right Daddy yeah yeah okay

[Music]

oh

oh oh everything's happening at the same

time let me

let me switch over to you

the the we

the blender page here and I'll get you

the chat

you know very very

short moments oh no almost like

chocolates I need my chocolate

give me any short moments

[Music]

I got natural cleaning

yeah something for that

so what do we have now

who who did having sex

when it's starting to be

removing the dress because of course

that's already

red it was ready

I I forgot to run out the rabbits well

how was it here prepared you got a lot

of time you got like 10 it's nine and a

half minutes

it does take out a little bit for this

team to actually become available after

press the

screen button

sand is nothing

and

you know thank you for the 100 beats

that that's very kind of me

just hundreds from nowhere oh no you

pushed up some people let me say wait

someone is missing on the list again

so weird

sometimes sometimes the name is included

sometimes it's called

what theory

someone has to look back in the previous

streams and find one I mentioned the

ladybug

okay A bit Stampede a very tiny

tiny stampede

and get loved one

oh no hey Daddy

oh another new set

I I heard this I I maybe haven't seen

that one before

but yes that's another one again

today I want to make another outfit for

a wonton

it's going to be

um

which I said on the server I want to

make

um Bianca's outfit because Bianca is

from spiral kind of like a

neighboring franchise what do they call

call it before

I don't remember what I call it before

kind of related franchise they have

nothing like in common

more than their own but the same company

started off as exclusive with franchise

on the PlayStation one

can spread out after that

I often miscon often misunderstood to be

the property of Sony but they were never

owned by Sony at any point

they were owned by

Universal from start owned by the

universe only

yeah owned by Universal and then

activation bought Universal Studios

might be a ad in between I see I think

universal student might split off and

become its own sing and took the flashes

with them and then activation bought

that

I don't I don't know the exact details

good

yeah

and and also as I can see that when you

use the

when you use emotes with uh

what skin tone modifiers it doesn't show

up properly it's just for the skin tone

modify separately

yes

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

no I'm sorry

I'm such a disappointment

with me

[Music]

even though I've basically been calling

myself Stephen in a lot of streams

so I don't think I should be considered

the one that doesn't that knows

everything

I can't be wrong I will admit that I can

be wrong

and I want even insane the typical thing

I've heard a few people say that I will

be the first to say that I can be wrong

with

obviously I'm not

the first

bad expressions from here to me anyway

I am only a rabbit and Candy mistake

so I'm I'm

trying um oh yeah I was supposed to

check is the skin robot the one I'm

looking for

I'm looking at folder name

um

if that's the one I'm looking for come

on

hello Jay

hey Pawn how's it going

I walk I walk up tired I but I'm I'm

full of energy now

[Music]

so that's fine

I'm waiting for this thing to load

oh it's a bit slow

so

Robert let me just check if this is the

texture

we are called determine

[Music]

wait let me

[Music]

because there's like two there's like

yeah wait there's also cyborg but I

think that one's called something let me

let me create

Russian

nine thousand I'm a bit

[Music]

okay yeah this should be the one I'm

looking for yes it should be robot

good

so practice now

before I can rename this to robot and

then Bianca

but I do have a question

I should open the preview window first

okay so I see what I can show my stream

let's see what

advancing your disappointments for it

it's a practically if not literally

impossible to know anything

well if we get rid of most things

you can know what's left

let's destroy it

says stupid though

it's not good you have some questions

picks up on how you talk about yourself

and it's perfect basically every part of

your mood because

thank you

[Music]

I mean I'm not I'm not like serious when

I say that I'm stupid

so don't don't think don't think that um

that I believe that I'm actually like

stupid

like that

even joking affection how do you know

[Music]

I mean

it seems to be terribly dramatic

so

[Music]

and I don't almost connected basically

like occasionally usually when I do

something stupid

so

I think I call another man I think I

call spyra side franchise to crash so

that therefore therefore therefore I

will

uh can I add Bianca as uh

skin option here

um yeah good now

no I didn't bother him I have this one

yeah okay

so

oh yeah yeah because she's going to wear

a dress

I need the underwear included

foreign

robots but it will appear as Bianca

so Bianca since Bianca is a rabbit I

think it's very busy

so let's go to spiral fines after MPC

by three Bianca contentness

[Music]

and it should be the kids

Oh no I got

yeah yeah

that means skeleton

don't need this skeleton

way so many

I'm not sure what this happened

yeah

evil pump on time

even in Spanish wait

did this

why is my dress

these these underwear even

before

[Music]

everything everything

a temporary

image texture here

this would be

textures yeah

this one there you go

somebody said that can't be in separate

Administration

and that should be robe I think yeah no

is it the same section

was it cloak yes it's clock

wait

oh yeah this is a cloak against

I do like the uh I do like the cape from

the PS1 version more than me

I mean this makes sense though

because it ain't the outfit she had

before but

because psychology class in college at

the same time if we like

people think everything affects everyone

the same way

I'm not kid look at my glowing eyes look

at my sharp teeth

which probably just looks like two white

dots on your screen

well let's see if I can fit

the dress on

that seems like it's not

interesting entries that's supposed to

be there

I don't know maybe I should separate

this part first because it's getting

getting in the way

[Music]

nuts

so many so many pieces

that everything

all right sits around mode

that looks to be everything

thank you

so now I can select yes

I like the cloud because that too

and I I like the cape that she has in

PS1

not so fan of the cloak

he's even from Fantastic

[Music]

I don't drink blood I'm I I'm an evil

bunny I am not like a vampire bunny

why do everyone think and drink I'm

drinking blood just because I'm evil

I can be evil without drinking blood

Little Things

maybe I should make the Thanksgiving

I've already cut my wrist with with the

ceremony of that in order to fill the

challenge with the necessary blood

circumstances why did you do that

[Music]

yes

he's my friend when I was thinking my

own drinks

I'm sorry

[Music]

my handy said you like the cake she has

in this one

bangs wait what cake

what cake what what cake are you talking

about now

pom-poms cake

my offering has been accepted yet

I am displaced

let's look up her dress because I need

sex inside

I'm not sure if she's wearing shorts or

my boy shorts

don't look I'm looking at the dress

or evening

wait can't I

hmm

point

okay okay

what I have to do is

instantly things

[Music]

and then I can

foreign

deselected

there we go

now I can separate the whole entrance

and have it placed on there you go now

there's a good

anyway it is

I don't know if it's shorts no I I like

the imagining boy shorts because of the

design that's that's just me

other people are free to disagree me

no no one is allowed to disagree with me

I'm even fun fun

It Ain't Good Steer I think

she has she has she has a lot of things

it's just as like she would be a bunny

although I have shortly

for some reason

no my dress is gone again

anyway look at this shortfeeds very very

short

why did people keep staying in my dress

our purposes

okay can I cancel my understanding

Universe yes yeah I was even if that was

what you're referring to like

like what what

um

that I like the

no oh no now I see what you mean

[Music]

no I said

in the original Inspire one this part

three on PS1

and I like the cape

that yeah it has not not her cake

I don't think she had much egg in the

PS1 version she didn't have

bigger boobs and it's quite pointy boobs

and she did show them off a lot

in the sense of I don't know leaning

forward

none of the other characters does that

okay there's actually one another

character that's bad because she does

take sex in

she has the exact same ideal animation

in smoking animation as Bianca and she

she and she has big boobs so I wonder if

that's the reason

no

um parts of the sheets

well let's combine them that Arch that

part combine

so you say anything else no I think that

all of it

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

and if you look better with the dress on

people would be less in kindest thing

what do you see you say I'm looking bad

in the dress

I mean I do have other outfits like me

sportswear and swimsuits

[Music]

if you if you like to see me dressed in

bed with them

[Music]

so

much

[Music]

I could shake it down like this

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

and it works

[Music]

Bianca is very

narrow comparative

energy and the address is very short

I would say she eats rainbow shorts

because the

they are like

very very tight to her body the the legs

of the those shorts are very tiny which

you would find on like potions

[Music]

you know

wait I didn't do much there we go like

like that like on my on my voice

no

that means we can look at her

um

yeah maybe

foreign

[Music]

this one is apparently called

okay let's call it clothes cape

and for this

our cool beans yeah let's copy this part

this will be

shoes and this will be dressed

there we go

now there won't be any really proper

animation to the key that's that's going

to be a bit

tricky to deal with

but finally

[Music]

okay

let's see how I can do this

[Music]

this part separates really

[Music]

against the whole dress should maybe be

stretched out

because of

[Music]

because it's too short

it's quite shorty

look

now a launching opinion

I should have checked on Bianca

I guess a bit too late now let me

let me input a second Bianca I can't

have enough

[Music]

second Bianca

up

this evening

so let's just

take up each

no yeah I don't know what a person means

yeah

and here sir I guess crotch

so it's like I don't know is that that's

not that's not a long race this thing

and I

mark this area as I can see okay

[Music]

let's do it

and then

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

so

I think asking each other that

and then I'll do a quick measure

[Music]

so it's like a third feeling

she has a very short face

scared his first time I sure support

and our body coffee

with with the short side just her

panties anyway yeah

but I guess that's the case for me at

the moment

beyond the wires for body carry no

dresses needed

time for the length of it bye

[Music]

foreign

so maybe maybe I should just put it just

halfway between

[Music]

and it's this short yeah I think I see

that will be good

now let's see if I can

actually make it big properly

[Music]

I probably do something like more cocoa

when I instead of actually

foreign

body into the outfit

this sounds like a very good to see

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

God damn

basically this eh

there we go

59 degrees and then

foreign

[Music]

cake

with cannabis on there like that

[Music]

it's definitely too high up

[Music]

foreign

I need to handy

yeah so this would be the

thing and I already texture the rest of

the body as the drinks

down to a certain points where

I wear the skirt when pinning

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

is this marriage oops

end up

okay

that's my that's fine

and then movies

[Music]

and let's add

this bag then spray tanky TV welcome

let me

today

hi hi bunny

I am

a

I am not a money and white bunny

and today

I am

this is the actual pumpkin

a foreign

[Music]

and I will

add

ponton to crash benefits for me

[Music]

[Music]

again hey this is the first time you're

checking but nice that

nasty heavy bag

I hope you

enjoy and if there's anything you would

like to ask

like yeah I don't know I think if

there's anything he cares about

[Music]

I am open

about the bunch of stuff

[Music]

laughs

yeah trying to put this on there is

going to be

[Music]

tricky

oh yeah the English I'm getting anyway

let's hide the ease so I can work

yeah open about lots of things sounds

pretty sassy what

no it doesn't

[Music]

it's only sassy if you think it's sassy

[Music]

it's my next I'm more open about myself

than I was before like

okay

hello

that is the French

that doesn't work I say

like how I wanted it too much

but like yeah before I was wasn't open

about being a trans woman

but I tried to be open about that now

[Music]

do we put inside me and you or something

[Music]

this Amazing Spider-Man I just used

something

[Music]

that was

this one

[Music]

Dango

not a starting day becomes something

good

I can't get here

that's probably yeah

you like yeah you have you seen

have you seen the mods have done and

that's a very very quick round stream

[Music]

this is the base model I made makes my

underwear that's the other way I'm going

to show one day like

dresses and sets

I made a black skin tight seat very nice

all right did some of my routines uh man

yes you did okay and sometimes I think

it's

mediums

I made a swimsuit

I was starting I haven't done that one

I also come on show it to them here

very very nice

and

it's just learning there you go

ask girl as well in all pinks

and yesterday

okay

outfits

and right now doing Bianca let me see

how easy this would be

I hope it doesn't make you laugh

when normal fun made all of

utility would probably start to help me

happiness

well you are right

but you know as after taking over one

punch my memory it's kind of hard to

differentiate What I've Done compared to

what she's done

for me

the biggest is you're taking our minds

so what are my memories

thanks

and email companies

is me

I'm controller's stream now

and no one can stop me

because this is not a reading to stop

being possible

when the damage with

some waste all those points and

everything evil pumpkin and someone

else's reverse back immediately

yeah that's a common problem mixing some

of these memories video on yeah

do you have experience with that

oh yeah sorry yeah no that's somehow I'm

gonna miss that point and you need to

hide the part of your substance but it's

stressful

well there

whether that's a lot that larger part

yes

because

um there was several moments where I

everyone was like things people talked

about

and

and they

it wasn't I I don't know

some things was applicable to me because

there was a trans woman

but I've been saying anything

even though I wanted to say something

and it just got annoying so I decided to

yeah

yeah I don't want to hide it anymore

people have

already accepted me as a woman without

part yet anyways

so I'm pretty sure people want to be

hopefully not change their mind

foreign

at least I haven't noticed someone just

yeah

leaving

[Music]

because most of the people I have

got in contact with are people who

are very positive about the whole LGBT

community

qi

QA Plus

I think I'm coming like LGBT equipment

anyway

so uh

yeah I'm not surprised the people

wouldn't be having anything against me

being friends

yep

yep yep

thank you

but of course none of this applies to me

because I mean even fun

all right trying to poop me

but I'm evil

don't poop the evilness

it's good

vertex Smooths

because it's gonna

[Music]

eat like sharp edges

much Sharp

mic Sharp

vertex smooth

does it

have a castle he knows that

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

my name is

laughs

remove Sharp

unlike

it is Mark Shabbos a clear shot

there we go

will apply even more as in itself since

I need to hold you so you know not to

eat

foreign

plan is to make everyone safe

and

I didn't know what you were playing with

me

I will

not say thank you after buying something

at this door

[Music]

not very terrific

I know it's the most terrific thing ever

wait isn't terrific good thing

horrible horrific

incredible terrific

[Music]

all right

here we go it's

[Music]

thank you

even finally doesn't even know equal the

words a little bit terrific against him

[Music]

now uh

English is in my native language

I'm sorry

not saying it's your side

dmit I said very

experience with

[Music]

I'll take over the world and make

everyone speak Swedish

[Music]

and then

foreign

spelling will make a big noises

[Music]

so sweet spelling isn't perfect but

I did so much better than me spending at

least

foreign

because you don't want to learn Swedish

Knight evil pump is only their

preferably evil like seeing one suck

after every pack that's horrible I would

never do that

snipe this killing some of the mirrors

there after he attacked

[Music]

and go out to your garden with the pair

of sisters and I will and then I will

cut one blade of grass half the length

of the average

can you please dimensions

well

if you take the word photo in Swedish is

photo

and because it's

[Music]

oh

you just spell it FL and that's it

it's really simple

[Music]

it's scary simple

[Music]

there are some words that are a bit old

but

I will not deny that and then it hurts

the whole day

[Music]

all right okay

and front and background system of

spelling which Spanish owns the uses

beautiful

and Camera in Italian

yeah I mean sometimes that happens

foreign

for speed camera

and he's a thought corner

and then again start coming

enjoy glasses

have you learned so much Swedish that

you become a teacher that's amazing

[Music]

oh

my God

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

yeah

I'm tearing him

yeah Swedish doesn't have um teach and

learn as separate words it's the same

word

and to make it learn which is something

affect you affecting yourself basically

you have to write it in a reflexive way

I teach myself Swedish

and

[Music]

otherwise it's the

yeah it's basically

it basically you take the English word

and only use the word teach

and never use the word learn

[Music]

this was an interesting aspect of

languages when you just don't have a

certain word and have to work around

that

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

Swedish and Spanish has verbs for coming

like a name something like that

[Music]

[Music]

so used at the very best to signify what

your name is that you are

setting a name that's being a verb in

itself

the first question is okay that included

extra time doesn't mean support even

purpose of a team

I have my own mind back

it is fun fun time

playing happy to be myself again

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

and when I left with the turbulence and

when a language likes a certain thing in

this case having a very far for being me

and

so when a language likes that you can

say things like my name is or I am

as uh my team go around that

[Music]

but if you do that in a language that

already has a proper verb that would you

otherwise use to signify what the name

is that my common effects

[Music]

I feel like if I would say in Swedish

Evelyn

Anna I don't know to me that kind of

sounds weird

[Music]

to me it kind of sounds more like I'm

saying

and but it is me who is Evelyn like I'm

trying to emphasize that

[Music]

[Music]

my machine is the savings

[Music]

there we go

[Music]

and then

30.

very nice

I think this is working

there's cold cold coloring call Clyde

and then I will move on to

foreign

IX program

this one seven insert

and do I need that no definitely

so here I will name these robots and

Bianca

now since why is this a night

[Music]

again I can't run over fast enough all

these chefs champions

but

yeah stop eating everywhere

they are stopping yeah if I have

and oh it's kind of covered up so but

fair enough then

I I guess they don't have to carry in

that case

[Music]

yep and the misaligner is in my book

that's original but I mean it's covered

up anyways so it's not like you want to

see it

so yeah it's going to be covered up I

don't have chat you don't need to fix it

even though I kind of wanted

my emergency

uh yeah this is very careful

[Music]

Evil Pumpkin but yes you wanted to say

hi I'm making breakfast

very nice to keep

water thank you for stopping by

um

being a breakfast it's gonna be 4 P.M

half an hour

at home yet nothing since

I got up up I got up in 10 30 I think

I got a pretty late I think

that being a singer so yeah I think five

hours

follow me steam foreign

that's fine

have a good day we'll have an evil day

yes

someone's blankets

and you still you throw the blankets

always up and then heading out

that does sound nice

like if you had like a sick

and now I'm I'm still speaking when

you're trying to leave it

I think secret blanket so I don't think

blank is correct word word but you when

it's like raining or something and you

just throw it over yourself and

[Music]

I think I've watched some YouTuber

who described such kind of

type of

shield from rain in the olden times

before like

umbrellas

but like maybe it was more of a north

northern European thing as well with

Shillings like this one yeah that's some

kind of cozy we wouldn't get dirty

quickly

[Music]

you know the best one is the coffee I

think it's team yeah and comfy

enough since nine so

yeah okay so yeah yeah to be fair here

I'm actually eating breakfast and it's

much kind of the same thing bye take

care have a good day

[Music]

I mean have an evil day

so

[Music]

yeah so I got this fixed

sorry yes I can see what I'm doing

so next thing I should probably do those

things

okay good care of everyone

yeah these these things

[Music]

stretching stretching

[Music]

ah

nice things

let us hide second seasons

[Music]

there we go

and this orange product I'll just make

the

test of protection teammates

thank you

and this what was what will this be

called

um

what what kind of thing

I got apple juice

it says 100 Apple

it is not 100 Apple because I mixed up

watching you don't have to mix it out

but

I do think it's a bit strong yes it is

and by mixing that I also get more juice

in total

yeah it lasts longer

so I think that's a good thing

of course it does reduce the Apple

content but the other content is your

step Watchers

yeah it's fine

Pepsi puppies

it's not pilk at least right I also got

a bag of Carolina

uh

cash

oh line

a Sweet Caroline Kelly

[Music]

team

[Music]

I heard that I care extreme

and I really should do one for the 200

following

but I'm not much

one day

and I want everyone to get a

opportunity to pick one song

[Music]

except great

sadly I don't think it is here because

that would have enough

although it's more of an inside joke so

where I can explain it there's no

problem

no it's only because Grange had his own

yeah

they're extreme

and I try to find

dance for him to do

but he rejected every option but I did

try one it sounds at least but he

basically kind of rejected every option

because he didn't know the song

eh

but I

wouldn't reject any songs on my care

extreme I would like I would I will I

will reject some songs if I object to

the lyrics

other than that

okay because

uh

there will certainly songs containing

lyrics that I

don't want to sing and I hope that's

understanding

[Music]

yeah your first message was it's always

it's nice to see other very Swedish

person thank you

on this one belt it's got a bad flag

complete the inside of the bun

let's do this

that will

[Music]

do this

Okay so

[Music]

I would basically have to enlarge things

until they are on outside

[Music]

okay

let me see

wait a minute

[Music]

[Music]

shouldn't let me get these accents

[Music]

because I'm an exact body

I'm working in my own model currently

nice and something that has bothered me

is how you create the inside of the

mouth

yeah yeah probably many ways of doing

that

I could show objects here as this is

what

and Coco

and

well

basically

the mouse

goes to once

funnel here kind of identities on

a large cabin

inside of it

is easy to see

and then inside that you have the key

sometime

which might occasionally

keep outside

that's the continuous one

so when you look into the mouse

it's probably

yeah yeah it's something something like

that

I hope any of that helps

foreign

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

scratch

or anything

[Music]

or like

you need a transformed

[Music]

hmm

and I'm like a slight beat like that

foreign

[Music]

looking up for this they will have

questions yeah

[Music]

let me fix that

it should be robots that can like you

can see

[Music]

but she doesn't have a purpose

that is Bianca has quite a tight skirt

so you don't really hear that

easy being happy

[Music]

[Music]

another blushing

[Music]

uh

[Music]

let's add the data transfer and where

the hell

to thank you

[Music]

chase skept the guys 88 moving welcome

thanks for the following

celebration

for everyone being very silly out there

here you're free to join if you want and

anyone

and you're also free to be quiet too

that's perfectly fine

but it's absolutely no pressure to do

anything

absolutely no pressure

foreign

then I can select every Point like this

and online the TV series for one and one

of these should be carried up completely

by what I want about

it in spaces well

another skip

oh oh you should make that redeem uh

message type someone can be aggressive

type of happy so like

decide

yes that is something I wanted to do and

wanted to do

and but that I will do that when I have

the bonbon resign

so

I will have

one Within

which is to check outfit

[Music]

you pick that one the description

because you can have descriptions of

their names which is clean

and we'll list every outfit that you can

redeem

and then you just in English it will

give them numbers too so you can either

give specify the number or write what

kind of outfit it should be

and

[Music]

it should take your request and put it

in the queue and

and when the current outfit timer runs

out it will take the next dance between

the queue so the the redeem will not

have any cooldown and

that's the idea

[Music]

also in the description on the underwear

team sportsfree well it's it's my

Sportsman

[Music]

um

I mean this means it also says Spotify

definitely a copy and paste there

we both are immigrate

well I guess I have to correct that

because apparently it's a priority

let me change this

it's a quick change

have fun for changing their hair

you wouldn't see it

um

and then the other one

I have compensation to her and then when

okay here we go

it has been corrected

but the very spot me yeah I mean some

like uh regular anyway which is like a

training bra and boy shorts it is kind

of sportswear like

[Music]

so these are the parts that actually

will be

[Music]

the

leadership

to be able to take these parts when

[Music]

yeah just me

let's take these parts

no I can't

want to do this because this shows where

let me see

[Music]

okay so yeah

those points are definitely colored up

those

about behind him

that one is visible

but this one seems to be funny

don't close

but I can split them into Giants and

then I can release the no triangle

now it's completely coming up

[Music]

so now

when I include everything yeah there's a

significant Gap now

[Music]

yeah perfect

[Music]

perfect

you can wear it in very specifics points

I mean if I were to put on

[Music]

since

I do have

boy shorts in my life

I mean he who's to say that those aren't

just very

and then we skipping shorts

[Music]

oh okay

[Music]

you guys want to do that but

you are

so silly

now I tell the area I'm not stream

that's

I have voice to access my other hands

I think I said that on another thing

that was when we're here since my

[Music]

laughs

no I no I didn't I think I said that I

was

I was only wearing underwear while I was

dreaming I think I said that

because it was quite warm that day

[Music]

I mean hey it's not like

I don't think anyone can see me

[Music]

weren't you only in your underwear when

you're streaming that's increasing

[Music]

I mean who here to say those those that

have camera

do you know if they're covering up their

buttons

this fine one

um cold for you

[Music]

this is the default color

[Music]

I think this would be different I guess

I have to then

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I mean I guess you're not alone

let's see

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

nothing stringly

it sounds like you should stop using

switch forces watching streams

maybe you don't say much of an option

[Music]

and again I'm making me

anyway

right on my phone but watching on switch

and the switch played by the Bahama a

few seconds the details coverage on my

watches on switch while my phone is

Charity I can't remember today

[Music]

as well

everyone's going to consume on

[Music]

people are going through more

[Music]

[Music]

as I guess

would be someone's King Jesus

Orange

Boop like that of course currently there

is no

next effect is just plain orange but I

don't still have the perfect benefits

I know how to make deep from rabbit

blood

foreign

right

let's start with this because that is

maybe we should be separate a bit more

laughs

and then I could

um

made it

unless obvious

ly

reduce the strength of the Epic

so there's more of a hint of it

foreign

[Music]

hello

yeah it does a kind of distinct design

so

I guess

I guess

thank you

[Music]

let me see

foreign

yeah yes

I think that's me

I'm not nothing else the anime

beyond the main floor that it's

kinda ridiculous

server

and what more should I have

reason

[Music]

like I would like to add it but

yeah it's definitely right here

poppy style play style

delicate magic companies

wait

um

I wanna

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

maybe it doesn't need us

much

yes it is

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

split this up anyway in the end so

why not speed them up immediately

[Music]

Okay so

it's always effect

so

duplicate these pieces over now I've got

these pieces

now to move them into appropriate lenses

30 38

okay

378

and then

but

[Music]

see you soon

one

fifty centimeter

blood pressure is 19.

28

.

24.

[Music]

I'm not a bit closer

and then

8 15.

[Music]

299

54.

when they want these next

but not that peace

but not that one piece

17.9

[Music]

9

and I don't need to say much space here

because

[Music]

they have much large pieces when they

may expire

for some reason while I make cocoa

a lot of small things in the mix

so annoying to copy of energy

[Music]

there's a difference

called in here again so right there some

thermometer thermometer

oh shows 23

that sounds like a great temperature a

bit on the warmer side for me when it

comes to the room temperature here but

needs to be warm right now it doesn't

need to be a bit cooler I think

you have a snow bunny

I won't melt

there's also another 10 he must make a

melted one point because it's too hot

anyway after the texture

ah

I did not Swap this over to use

and taste it being annoy

and Roberts

[Music]

I should maybe update the uh

roughness and

a little bit

[Music]

foreign

original picture

oh it goes a bit brighter

you want Barber to take the heat from my

room please it's so [ __ ] hot then in

my way please the sticky not so fun and

siphon out of the heat piping him I'll

start watching it up

don't let any really heat Escape

[Music]

by the side from sifa

the form

this now that let me see this example

oh yeah let's just go to my portions of

it anyway but but still

[Music]

the heat wave so just paint you to the

way or a hole

when

but then the winter comes

open your windows during the night let

it let the warm air in out

in a cool night temperature in

and then early morning you close the

windows

before it gets too hot outside

and practical iron inside

make sure to cover up the windows with

blinds of sort so you don't let the dirt

sound like shiny

[Music]

some ideas

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

it doesn't have much the houses are made

to keep in heat

but yes but if there is no heat inside

there is no heat to keep in

and they built to like keep the

temperature the same not that change

damages

I mean they're not

greenhouses that you don't

let Moana in

I don't know

kind of works for me I guess

it kind of built similar

these walls are pretty sick

keeping the temperature

because it's isolated so it's it's like

it so it keeps the heat in but it also

keeps the cold in if it's cold okay my

experience

but it feels it feels like they're

keeping me

[Music]

gold in this one

[Music]

foreign

if

do you know which side of a rabbit is

the furriest

now

the farthest side of a rabbit is the

outside

for two and that's not what I'm saying I

guess you might be great

Panda you're like I hope this is enough

that's it right but

Red Dragon

one point

black eyelashes but eyelashes are not

fur

[Music]

[Music]

in front of me kiss my feet

my little purses

on my knees

foreign

yes I did comment that

[Music]

is the idea of running airplane because

of the Lamb

you know since that would be cool and

then I have a bunch of followers which

can be

watching this

like

[Music]

I would like the multi-game so I could

replace the lamp with a rabbit but

[Music]

doesn't seem to be any like

big mods to the game so it doesn't seem

to be

ECT mod

sadly

[Music]

forward

okay that's quite

detection now

let's see how it looks

so this is our looks at the moment

and then

um

let's put a new texture

[Music]

and it's like dark but

very big boiled up

I think it's kind of like

[Music]

I think it's possibly gone straight

like this I don't feel like I'm you know

[Music]

there we go

if you want to plan for me to keep

lighting dresses I don't know I'm really

like being dressed

I'm gonna have blisters

is way too cute for me

I need I need something cool

something

[Music]

nice little kids

[Music]

I guess the only other texture that we

need

to generate here

wait no one had this

here

[Music]

[Music]

now I will generate it again

but it should be set to leave me

[Music]

on the way

and now decent if I have any

adorable

these clashes with my Eve only son's

business

this is that's not right I agreement you

don't mind everyone here with aim

I am I am

the night

I am Japanese tonight this this does not

suit my team

[Music]

everyone will make fun of me

I think it's cute

[Music]

I need to get this outfit of me

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

before and after

so now if I sing this

[Music]

enormous

[Music]

um

so this is the one

I wanna you know

and then update this there we go

I don't think a

now

there's nothing I didn't expect me

[Music]

okay

well I mean I can just take off my

underwear you know

that would be very inappropriate

do I think Julie can

no

I feel humiliated

[Music]

by my own followers

I think they shouldn't was

I generated in here

yeah maybe I should set this one as

this one

thank you

and that's translation

foreign

let's see if this works

what's the worst that can happen

oh

McDonald's

foreign

magenta

that's not how it's supposed to look

at him image

another 10 nice thing

um

I wonder if there is a way to

thank you

reject the shape and turning on it yeah

that is

and let's change the mouse so I can see

it there

this looks to be what I'm looking for

but

[Music]

um

do you want to see certified

[Music]

because that makes noise

nice

[Music]

[Music]

well that's got an interesting niche

[Music]

yeah this might be

closer to water liquid mind

[Music]

yeah of course

let me see yeah let's just try this

hopefully it doesn't take too long to

bake it now don't wait

stop

[Music]

I'm gonna stop defensive 20 minutes

I gave some effects

notification

but

[Music]

[Music]

this has the effect on the people

the neat effect but

it has an interesting

it's not what I'm looking for

could be because I canceled it

let's let's have it run fully

that red island is a very nice touch

baby by

name

[Music]

[Music]

okay

as far as

I can tell the eyeliner is not the it's

like I don't use making my sound of

similar for only term but I am this

person can tell there is no way

red eyeliner being used but it is the

I think they call it eye shadow

battleship is a specific tool for it

though

but yeah

these are my little late to the party

yeah you're coming in here with evil

pumpkin

um

and then you come in

I have missed the whole party

what's going on here

[Music]

I'm sure what's

why it looks like this

this is that part for this

yeah I'm in confused at the moment

yeah I want to do something but

apparently it doesn't work

[Music]

if you search for eyeliner you'll see

that's kinda adding

like eyeshadow doesn't seem to be

specific usually

above as perfect

[Music]

well I guess I guess

yeah okay

looking up eyeliner it is giving

it is usually adding

thickness

to around the eye

which on pon pon I guess it's hard to

see the black

eyes

when we temporarily look at pon pon

there's like the black around the eyes

and I guess that would be the importance

in an eyeliner when I read with just

Financial Insurance

[Music]

okay

but hello rocket man you are

yeah I'm trying to make this thing work

but I don't get the word

[Music]

I don't know wait okay can I come out

okay

uh I covered it to my appointment

now

otherwise I'm not getting too much

because I want these Rewards

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I don't I didn't need to make myself

pretty I am not sure

foreign

[Music]

States

[Music]

online

[Music]

it's kind of working like this

do not fully records and

even

actually pretty easy huge

[Music]

well I guess that's that

I'm gonna call these

eggs

[Music]

so

[Music]

I know there won't be anything

you know the only kids but have to

wonderful especially when she tries

everybody look at me I am dark I have

glowing eyes how is this cute

if I might eat 18 but not consuming a

lot I will explain your blood and not

come see me

[Music]

anyway that's my

and then she also has jeans

[Music]

Watkins

no I dropped it

anyway

[Music]

oh yeah and then

all right okay

get back here

design only to know that the

that's the anime

[Music]

they just need to

normal oh yeah for better name of this

what's that what you see that must be

amazing

you know what

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

so now that looks normal

and see it looks not because

um

that might explain a little bit she's a

fan no one told me that is

I can't expect you won't you know what

I'm saying can I drink

um

air pumpkins

[Music]

what what other dresses they have how do

you have the red dress

doesn't it

foreign

[Music]

no more Dresden

red and black with hearts all you want

new and that one

let's switch it up in

the evil design still with hearts though

so not fully anymore

please

I see what you like man because you rent

[Music]

in pompa's face becomes random

so there we go that's more I like it

that's more like you

beat them in mind going on here

not exactly what I'm looking for

now our savings

as

n temp

okay

[Music]

is it because it's uh

maybe maybe that's funny okay I have an

idea

[Music]

[Music]

let's check the wireframe

this isn't this isn't how I'm waiting

next night

very bent

[Music]

when

what happens if I move this up

oh I can't get this name

is not interested

it's interesting

foreign

thank you

sometimes

but sometimes it refers to stop smoking

when I thought I was the evil one but

you keep seeing my dress so clearly you

are all the evidence

paint receives

yes because it's an option doesn't mean

you have to use it

[Music]

anyway all right that's right

it's somewhere more accuracy

anyway hopefully I can get rid of this

by generating an example it doesn't take

forever generate like this and see

evil

more evil than me even there because

oh but if you were to taste my blood

it'd be quite spicy since I eat at home

only 240 grams a bag of Carolina Reaper

is

in other words the same season

I'd like to try such sour that's cheese

my hot and boiling blood even certainly

but it's really modern I should also

turn into Evil Pumpkin

oh

it's the scars so there's the

but of course I'm up to make something

changes too even

the scars on the end

that makes no sense

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

three four three thank you for following

is it because I'm evil

follow me bro

evil fun fun dress even

I want to know how she got this cars oh

um

[Music]

well

easy

I wanted to explain

[Music]

I wonder if I should

[Music]

um

[Music]

[Music]

scars does not come from any accents or

anything

they when I when I became evil funds

indeed

the boiling blood just

approach the funniest

things start to apparently the part

I don't know how it works I'm just evil

[Music]

[Music]

yeah oh neat

you can breasts open I got scarred on my

chin that came inside dang ball spot

when I grew up my bed

lucky I wish I had

no beard but

so many new followers today

I have 229 followers

my goal is like 250.

[Music]

it's a depression

I'm totally not trying to surpass

someone else with 244 followers

I am not trying behind

only 15 followers more

foreign

there's a lot of modifying here

let's go back to

Danny

and important things

not closely

right somebody

that's a weird artifacting but it's fine

I've done so much

team

I know really things no you didn't

[Music]

have been my

wait yes

they have been my idol for

a very long time

[Music]

and it's kind of kind of surreal that

time

it's a bit more followers

is this on stringing things so weird

I'm doing something I have so many

people

watching

Sally doesn't reflect on my YouTube

videos

okay with the alerts on the December uh

maybe that's been converts anymore

we use some giving you

I said

if you do have issues with

because that's the thing a lot of people

say like

um

like follow me on Twitter in case you

have issues get the notification about

new uploads

and like yeah but you're going to post a

lot of other stuff

so

uh

and if I'm going to follow every

YouTuber I'm trying to make sure I don't

get

um

[Music]

you know so I don't miss any uploads but

if you keep posting other stuff we see

people of course gym because this is

kind of their private accounts maybe

it's the problem but they're still going

to processing it related to the YouTube

channel

as well or just other things they find

nice looking

but

if every YouTuber and then following is

doing that it's going to drown out the

action recent I'm following them in the

first place to get the updates about new

uploads

and now I have the exact same issue

again I don't see the uh I don't have

issues with singing yeah

new Outlets anyway so that's why I'm

looking for in the first place but even

if I try it's not a sneaky however

if you do want and this is something

they should possibly do is that if you

do want uh if you

if you do want to make sure you don't

miss uploads from me

what you can do is actually join my

Discord server

and where we of course of course all

this stuff is posted that's what however

you can

um

go to roles activate the YouTube alert

role

and then you can basically just mute the

whole server

and then and of course there's not a

quick one you you don't have to verify

yourself

and by not verifying yourself you can

just mute the welcome Channel because I

assume it's going to give you a

notification for every

person joining

and then

there we go

or you can use

it is so nice if you do better for

yourself but it regardless but then you

all you have to do is mute the

let me go to myself and check

[Music]

yeah you you mute the category that is

called text it will mute every channel

and future channels added to that

and then you just keep the rest of them

yes it has been 50 minutes it has been

16 minutes

there you go

yeah they're trying to boost engagement

on the platform because staff makes them

more money yeah I mean that's another

reason

I'm thinking before you joining my

Discord server I'm using everything

except me at the alert channel which

gives you alert about new uploads on

YouTube that's not going to give you

more engagement so

I think I am being fat

after we knew about kids bunny yeah I

mean if you want to go join the meaning

is

very lucky man you should you should

make a Discord again

enjoying the service

those eyes are always watching yeah

they're kind of looking after the

designs

again

[Music]

but just a game

the selection disappears with me

I'm select the software

I don't know why

it is very

so what's up with the

this is a normal map

I know I'm working too much of it but

it's really good dream

is the model the extra that's shiny you

know because everyone likes to touch on

I mean

[Music]

if you have a pumpkin plushie you can

touch pump on as much as you want

[Music]

never mind I guess I guess the most

realistic way for me to make a plushie

at this point was possibly my

looks it would be if I

get in contact with the company that

could even produce these plushies in the

first place

and

preferably must produce them so they get

cheaper but still being 2D quality I

want and with the pictures I want

classic features

and we go

how does this differ from the previous

year this should be more great

[Music]

[Music]

if I can't forget this

so yeah and then I contact them and see

like

how many

[Music]

plushies

there was like

okay I'm trying to figure out let's see

how many patches I can people in my

community are

honestly able to purchase that's mean

and if you actually get plenties in the

amount of plushies

yeah we can

see how much that will cost with the

company to produce those

and then

then having some lack of kind of

[Music]

Kickstarter kind of deal

and if that's funded

that's money is going to go to the

company

and then they can produce the basics and

send them out to everyone

is that a promise

of course

I in the time of evil

of course I'm not evil and yes it is a

genuine suggestion that I think

and

is there is an idea that might

it might work

and it features of this plush would be

welcome back hello I have the controvert

my brain was taken away

foreign

features including being able to change

outfits the plushy itself is not going

to have a

like the the main touch body is not

going to have any clothes I know some on

some classes like certain clothes are

built into the body the the problem that

should not have anything like that

okay and then you can change

access to anything you want

including anyway if you

really want to

so you should call it a very interesting

yeah you should come with that machine

so she's not making an address she

should have her

pink dress and Splashway and swimsuit

preferably aesthetic I wanted to be have

like humanish proportions so you can

purchase clothes from just like regular

human clothes from store then put on her

as one

foreign

[Music]

I guess my brain was taking control of

her but I was feeling away if it was

going on

I guess that makes sense

[Music]

it's hard to explain

I'll probably do that actually but I'm

doing a bad thing

it's not kind of

instance

[Music]

so yeah

that's my idea thank you

and also regarding promises and such and

one and one thing I've seen I've seen

people been worried about is donating

money to actually starter that might not

get enough money to actually fund this

project but that's the whole point of

specific Kickstarter that if you don't

reach a goal you will not be shocked in

the first thing it is

so you don't have to worry about that

[Music]

okay

it's working

[Music]

as in each genuine through this moment

and there we go

foreign

actually

is there any guarantee that I will

actually send it off to the company

well technically not but as a streamer

with direct contact with all my fans

that will completely destroy my

reputation if I try to take them on and

run away

and

then it would only last for me for so

long so it's really nothing

is there a guarantee that the company

will produce the products no no not that

either and I guess

but that's

but that's just how it is there's never

really any at least a company you might

be able to depending on which country it

is in

might have some legal

auctions

that you can pursue

especially when you can see if it's a

large amount of money

[Music]

anyway

well almost half past when

he is half past 19.

I have an Isabel Clash from Animal

Crossing

did you take

it took her out of Animal Crossing and

see

would be very touchable

and if it's your opponent plus you can

touch it anyway

her fingers her tail

you can even put her nose

you can even touch your eyes

depends on how much you want to like

consider alive

some people just have have a plastic

color with something like

clay

that's fine

if you pay them to this contractual

obligation from the research them

exactly so that way

there is legal ways to be on the back

also just being sassy and yeah of course

but it is still good to really make sure

that everything is as it should be so

it's it's still Fair

[Music]

anyway

so a let's see

the spots on it

foreign

[Music]

well I guess this wasn't much of a

difference

[Music]

anyway

it looks good

[Music]

the question is is it correct that PS2

it is

Shane smash so it's easy to tell

I mean yeah

it would be easier to tell if

I could check a second hand

let me introduce the normal map

like I can't see how the normal Edge

looks because I don't have a normal head

energy B curves

inverted the green HD but just in invert

with checkboxes but whatever

it's a normal map

no it was normal

color acrostic core

I must be calling

now come on

now he went to Alpha normally yeah okay

when it is

two

maybe one

now I have no longer accepted

ah

let me copy this over to the correct one

oh I already set it up okay

[Music]

like

that's to be quick you know

everything needs to be fine good good

[Music]

very good

I'm happy with that

the only thing that remains is the

Shields and cake now

anyway let me continue well presumably

you'd have a contract yeah yeah

everywhere I was finally the two

Fluffy's wine if you want to have some

that because that'd be big

but it will not be any toe beans because

bunnies don't happen

I'd wrap pumpkin soft belly inspection

everywhere you want

you can play with her

you can brush your hair and dress her

everywhere

imagination life is your creation

if there's no reason for characters

University practices

the chicken yeah it makes sense

it makes sense

therefore

I have taken com missions and not any

money and therefore there is no and no

contract sign no money changed

therefore I would assume there is no

obligation for me to complete the

service or product

[Music]

of course there is no obligation

obligation for them to pay at the United

States in exchange for me not being

stressed about having to complete

something or not yep

not even fulfilling I assume you can you

know

foreign

[Music]

s

[Music]

husband is only going to be sad because

you don't respect her

being less tools

[Music]

[Music]

even though they've been soldering it on

me so I don't know

play with her team yeah that sounds that

sounds nice

yeah

yeah everyone has been paid but you

either have to provide a really

fundament yeah it makes sense

[Music]

how do I say pizza

that makes perfect sense

[Music]

[Music]

oh yeah so

[Music]

when it's um wait why are they different

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

obviously I mean

there are obvious reasons

because not everything is perfect this

match

maybe yeah

[Music]

[Music]

I would definitely like to have a

pumpkin Festival

that would be so fun

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I think fine

[Music]

[Music]

the girl is for me to have fun from

flashing for myself and then

everyone else just have the option to

buy one

maybe that's not it does not like going

it's only to him for myself

[Music]

okay now kind of something

let me know

it would definitely fine you do to us

can happen

thank you

[Music]

it's Pawn spice a bit strange to anyone

else like you think that we had back a

nice at the end oh it's

um

probably it's the computer behind the

steps

yeah it's probably the computer brand

you're hearing because the computer is

working a lot to make this work if I had

you know I completed it wasn't so

week and I had to work really hard to

they get this work and with better

Cooling and maybe a little bit more

correctly and perhaps perhaps I like a

desktop computer

or not like

we are calling in the desktop it and

because I want to place it on the desk

but it's our way from the microphone

that way yeah you would also not near

the only for that reason

it's running a bit hot now yeah it

doesn't run as hot when I do the

yeah when I run the PlayStation games

because those are a bit easier to run

all of this stuff

this is probably heaviest

yeah I wish I could do something I I

have I tried to put on as much filters

as I can which

[Music]

and I I do have the my special Echo

reducing apparatus

are cardboard box with penis to reduce

the the

to reduce the sound fairly

[Music]

I mean I'd run hot next to it

oh oh my

I like the friend's name again

practice sure

that's a very fancy name

thank you

so her feet is

camps thing

let's see

no way

why are you taking that part

I mean it is shorter but

obviously it was a logical positive

[Music]

thank you

all right these parts okay

and then that in shop application

scheming stuff fancy names

sure

let's remove this

half decimal cream in here

I didn't mean to create

for some reason these two parts are not

connected each other

the match

of temperament

okay I don't need this opening a lot

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

and

[Music]

selling

I guess I'm just enlarged things

but it fits around the feet

[Music]

but not perfect in it

my current job by analysts data to

determine areas at risk of employee

engineering creating action planes they

wish to eliminate schedules I mean very

it sounds like a quite a straightforward

description

um

one mistake for it I mean

it's a big fluffy explanation

apparently stage of mine

where where were you in one of my last

jails that place was a test drive

well presumably Earth

are the place where you're working now

here we go

[Music]

thank you

so many

so many parts

outfits taken all day as well that's

fine

it is fun which is what matters

yes

[Music]

foreign

thank you

Elaine monster

I just take data from recent

observations and tell my co-workers to

make sure employers are

placing it means

in short of saving me

I think going around and bending in

places

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

that saves me so much

[Music]

but yes and it is

once a good which I didn't think before

there's a point out if there's something

wrong with the Stream

so I know if I had to fix something

okay sometimes I am aware of this and

I'm trying to get myself

[Music]

sometimes the game might be a bit loud

but I forgot to change though the volume

so it's playing at max volume

[Music]

that has happened

[Music]

since our company here the volume it's

playing on the Stream

and which is

because yeah the I have like

amazing catchphones yeah so the audio

doesn't get uh

[Music]

so the microphone doesn't speak up

[Music]

but that also means I have an

independent volume control

is about another place on the Stream

yeah I'm not this is a bit tricky

um

this pattern

so I'm I'm able to use

so the legs can end up here then I can

remove the rest so I only need to get

this part to match

it in some way

anyway in Europe here

[Music]

actually I have two jobs at work I'm

also the guy who handles the scanners as

well as this scanning system

anything

oh yeah

[Music]

lemon beans

okay I need to

I'm happy at all today's

[Music]

and we can imagine

simplicity

all the um should maybe

wait let me see if I

know

hey

starting again

well

just

select it like that

and then I came up

shortly like this

[Music]

right constant

foreign

[Music]

but I don't have to make it like

like that

I expect

so bad

[Music]

I still can't take this off it's just

good luck with the scanners guys

of course

[Music]

[Music]

no one knows how to work the skin is

[Music]

okay um

I'm always always struggling with your

feet with shoes specifically

okay

I'm not sure how

[Music]

everything else gets fine except this

point

there are separatist but is that I can

still stand up there

[Music]

separate it as well

[Music]

can't join right yes so

I heard it separate

[Music]

so

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

and this

[Music]

I know I just split them off but let me

let me try

I guess imagine that's scary again yeah

I I do want to test that first

[Music]

right okay let's see

[Music]

I started doing

things

[Music]

one

and a half

right

[Music]

he said the wrong mode

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

normally

[Music]

and but sometimes you don't fix them

[Music]

because you're tired of fixing them

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

so

I guess this would be an interesting too

huh

yeah that's a scary game

[Music]

[Music]

because I took a day after soon we'll

hit the sword and we'll lose money

one sounds like

you should be compensating anything

seems like you're doing a very important

job

and she will be well paid

[Music]

nothing great

hello

hello and this is broken

hmm

thank you for the rain

and hey I'm sorry I'm welcome

hello hello

hey

Jason

get ready

let's do

shout out coming

is broken when I was playing Call of

Duty infinite Warfare

hopefully you won't hit my ass at just

that moment because as we're teams

how did it go

how did the stream go

[Music]

I hope you had a good thing

here

Dimitri can I see simchi no they are

different that's why

there's no symmetry it's it's been the

same

infinite Warfare was a roller coaster

now I'm thinking of modern boyfriend

that's why I recognize the name because

I haven't really followed the equality

scene

I play like modern warfare which was

called use it foreign

Black Ops

like every Call of Duty game there like

for the campaign for example and the

summer explain

and then I couldn't bother anyplace

they meant too many qualities

[Music]

I wouldn't mind like playing those games

or stream them like for the campaign of

course not not about playing

since I have played it could just be

another series because I kind of

sometimes go through the whole scenes

and things but it's so many games

that means there's a lot of inspiring

games to prepare

no so that's great dying

well

yeah I mean

that's my

I might have been

[Music]

emotional about other inanimate scenes

so I get it

why don't he play any of this on stream

why what

I don't play any games off stream since

I started streaming if that's what you

were about what you're asking like why

why

I said I said that it was an idea to

play it or something

you're asking it like

you're asking it yeah he has a favor to

play everything off start stuff off the

street

it was years ago I was playing this

thing last

they completely misunderstood

the uh seven of your questions

but um

yeah I do not play them

and after those games

I'm just not living letting those

schemes

yeah he said that's right as I sent the

message

okay fair enough say enough

yes

I have a

I'm just not thought about playing

Pokemon

but yeah

but maybe I should then

it's an interesting idea

and then I would go through basically

every Call of Duty gaming is because I

think that's kind of my team

every one of the empty name from start

to finish

[Music]

even the bad ones

I'm gonna go bye bye now that's right

that's fine if you've been swing

don't feel like you have to say have a

good one thank you

have a nice day and everybody

why not

okay yeah thank you Eric thank you for

meeting

thank you

very much following myself yeah I could

play that too

I could play

I could play this

as well

and uh yes

a good Kingston

I think I think like

I think yeah

yeah Call of Duty like when made at

least when I played it maybe maybe

they're terrible now

because I haven't really followed

because I played this long again also

maybe they aren't so well made

anymore what's it mean when I really

want to show to me pink in it

[Music]

like there's a lot of clipping I see

here but I am going to delete the lower

parts

of the beats animated

[Music]

see if there's some clipping that

doesn't matter

yeah I can't I can probably not

immunized

do something like that

there we go

boom

short and stummy

let me do that balance balance it out

let me set it bye

nice I guess

yeah I can't make them

Point here to

to reflect how it was before

now I just need to fix

[Music]

yeah I like them please

yeah

the others

pointy Shades you like pointy sheets

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

my boss appointed

American now

right

there we go

this is broken cinnamon and me made me

eating

foreign

you need

a crazy thing

I guess you're right

I guess you're right it's not amazing

it's it's investing

keep well spent points

it's not wasting if you enjoy it I guess

TV

[Music]

yes that's better

how about them shoes

this perfectly fits his feet but I mean

I don't know it's like I noticed that

they don't perfectly fit

I think someone's going through a thing

that they've done perfectly hey I got a

slice of an edge

foreign

[Music]

Origins

enable the body again

and then

again

or two

attacks

[Music]

all right

[Music]

that fiction Beyond

[Music]

continue

[Music]

sound

the same time it's like that it's gonna

I can't can't see anything

[Music]

[Music]

now that

does not help

thank you

[Music]

now let's

and that was that energy was fine but

what I did after that was not

10 minutes

my name is an insane's enemy

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

there you go

[Music]

when you're there okay no need to be

moved forward

thank you

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

oh my these are some textures

let me

see if I can quickly

[Music]

copy everything

Johnny is

I think oh and then when I damaged the

shapes I'm done with this and now

because I have been okay

be sure

you know what maybe I should take a

break maybe I'm not done with this today

yeah I think I think I think I should

probably stop yeah

I haven't gone in the office uh six

hours

and I did go on for eight hours

yesterday so that's I think this is

enough

it was a missing waste

oh no no that's intentional

[Music]

like this this whole thing should have

been here

[Music]

yeah like huh

thanks yeah

this should not be here

that's probably covered

are there

wait

[Music]

this part that is

that will cover I probably have

punishments

that will be covered

under the

the

up in the skirt which is this is the

inside

not going over enemy

I guess it doesn't

mean and then this is gonna cover up

everything

then it's that much

and of course this is

taking extra time to show up

so yeah

thank you

very simple cards and codes you don't

drink too much it's not a substitute to

be one

have we done that no we're not done but

um I'm done for today I have already

targets but definitely have a retarget

because

this one if if he's streaming still

he looks magical thing cheeky

[Music]

it might have been a short stream

it might have been showing

[Music]

17

let me check

uh

must have been a short stream

this

I didn't I didn't expect my attention

let me check

[Music]

yes and what's some yeah I had someone

in mind to read

we should have started one hour ago but

I guess it was an hour's long stream and

really I really thought he was going to

do like a

[Music]

I could have just completely

misunderstood I've seen

and yeah first checking you late like no

I should check schedule of latest Dreams

yeah he has not he has no stream today

so maybe

no no no no no

now and then I read the message

carefully it should it should have been

a 24 hour stream

starting from one hour ago

oh I should definitely not be too late

but there's no stream so I'm not that

sure what's going on

[Music]

uh

watch team for sure what short stream

are we going on with six hours I was

just a short stream no I was going to be

the uh someone who was going to have a

birthday stream uh but my

that didn't happen

so

that's a shame

[Music]

because I haven't traded him for quite a

while and he

this is nice funny and creative and very

fun

and this was going to be a birthday soon

you know I didn't I don't know where it

is

it's not here

so let me just check the server

and see if there is no there's no

announcement

and

let me check the channel chat

no no message there

let me just check them out

oh wait I'm not

I didn't didn't have any announcement

can miss them

nope there's not even a new another

thing yeah I have no idea what's going

on now I'm confused

I'm so confused

[Music]

I don't know what's going on

I guess we'll just make someone

understand I'll give up on this idea

that means video comments first

hey it's interesting video hey

hey I hope you're gonna kiss me for the

raid and just say hello and then leave

sorry if I'm taking time

yeah it's it's good options there's also

rain Fox

option
