[Music]
it's so much louder than
[Music]
yeah beautiful
non-repetitive music
okay
let's begin the new story so is this the
continuation from my Crash Bandicoot
Sports then
I don't know why this game lies within
the
yeah
in time zone python
in the in the the chronological
chronological thing
hello
continuity
I mean
results
one of the mysterious space station
orbiting high above the Earth
cortex remind me why I keep you around
you have failed me one too many times
did he did cortex fail okay
in the first two games because he didn't
exist then so he was the only failed as
far as we know he has only failed
and that's the only time I guess one
time is one too many
all these years trying to Vanquish that
brainless Brandy coot he is one of he's
one of no importance to us we want to
check over the world
or heard it all before little scientist
what is so different this time
smoker
I think
officially always says
I I have a little I have a little tiny
and to bring Earth's puny inhabitants
down to size
[Music]
turkey number of test students and
moving Swift down to the game
is the current who wouldn't give
sandwiches yeah you've paid me one too
many times but I've only paid you once
exactly
all right okay back to the stories
what was the voice thing at last my
luxury minimizer is complete
there's links will bow to my Superior
intellect
oh it's continuous automatically okay
other than it became a
finally after all these years chip used
tables
sorry I
after all these years of abuse the
tables have turned who's the leading guy
now
I knew context I am you really you will
look up to me
I finally won no nothing can stop me not
even a little burnt dude when it crashed
also be shrinking down if he's striking
out the whole planet and also the mass
of the planet wouldn't change so he
wouldn't really be able to hold the
planet because the planet is really
heavy
and he would also be squishing the
planet
so are they on the planet at the moment
and are training and look at this
polygons
unless I get out of those polygons
Coco's hair is like
be polygons as you go down
ah cool that's not his name his name is
aquaku he wrote okay okay before
the quality of this game
Rush Coco the world needs your help
Portage has shrunk our planet to the
search for green fruit we must stop him
it looks as if cortex is using these
crystals to power his shrinking machine
crash if you can find the proper
crystals from around the world I think I
can build the device to reverse the
effect
good luck Crush missing comma you should
you find the crystals so we can put an
end to Cortex evil scheme
which was strengthens again and now
Finland well I guess a
start with the first lemonade
well that's the story then
weave story
I guess that's why they cannot cut this
off from the crash Lord with
the
the new crash for game
crashboard too
yeah okay let's let's do some jungle Jam
and short loading times I guess
so yeah this is
2D crash so it's
my eyes don't crashed forward I'm
playing Crash for a long time
to the commercials so basically the size
color parts of crash at least it has
been a part of
like crash gameplay isometrics
spiral gameplay
so
and if only your quality of these games
and really the same
[Music]
bonus bonus
[Music]
b-o-u-n-o-s that's not how you spell
bonus
[Music]
b o and u s
that's how it's been bonus
I'm not a native English speaker even
though the word is spelled exactly the
same in Swedish I don't I mean me saying
the letter names in English my brain
I usually don't spell things out in
English I don't know if I got everything
like this like button brings everything
ah this one actually shows the Box
counter for any it replaces them
oh I saw it I was going to miss that
tricky platforming and bonus itself
well I guess I'm gonna going back
checkpoint check out these points
your English is better than that of many
native speakers
all right thank you
I have had a few I have had a few years
of practice
[Music]
maybe I should pick up some
it's the sound of this game
yeah ah there we go
clear TM
s
look at this it is time travel too yeah
that's going to be fun
I mean like should I like
no I need a speed chase or something
correct
and strengthen the
[Music]
almost feels like these controls are
almost I do prefer these swimming
controls
you hardly sound
but he did not spin there
and these controls are definitely I do
prefer these controls for the
platforming games
not perfect
but they do feel much easier to control
don't mind me
right that's a bit delicious referring
the controls ever
again but sometimes they do get it yet
that's right whoa whoa
careful day
yeah they're basically ripped everything
from
homework
[Music]
although I don't remember if this is
came from him
because yeah I didn't tell the game show
the released on the screen on the
countdown I kind of forgot that
are there speeches in this game I S
think there are
it's been basic that in every crash game
since
instruction
yeah
I probably shouldn't like goes to the
time trials until after the cortex made
me
but like I focus on
the crystals first I will I will pick up
every grade if I can
get the let me snap and get the clear
clear gems if possible
[Music]
and then I will
[Music]
go back and pick up the teenager gems I
was unable to get
away from this place
there's a lot of shipwrecks in the
background
a lot of them might have caught he's
been up there
I think so many shipwrecks
there we go clear gem
what about the exit of the level
[Music]
so here we got two clear gems B well I
guess this is
the day I can spawn and I'm checking
they are doing a little dance
foreign
[Music]
yeah I went to some kind of
that's what um
back to licking
um some kind of introduction animation
when the level starts it's just boom
that will have started
I don't know what is this secret area
secret area yep I'm hungry again
wait can I not
it is possible it's just
fine
the this game is not gamey that's going
to be annoying
I think nope yes it was about the day
um anyway
s
instead of spaghetti to the rabbits and
she's just sitting there he expect me to
eat this
[Music]
no little bunny I expect you to
just look at it
[Music]
yeah it doesn't sound like a bonus music
this sounds like something that would be
in crushed in rinsing
oh my God
and that sounds nice when this was
actually ripped from Crash team racing
um
I didn't get it
[Music]
but that's all the boxes
which I'm an extra nice now
well this game isn't brutally hard at
least
then the Firebox is still quite a lot of
boxes
now so this these small numbers
the small numbers are very sharp and
pixelate like pixel art design not
perfectly but the big numbers they are
kind of ripped from the game and crushed
down into pixels
crash extra life is kind of similarly
whoa I wasn't prepared for that
some
creepy bird just came and attacked now
all of a sudden
can I read
there we go
um
and I go down here and there's nothing
really dude
is this the extra gem
yeah
what
next time I was prepared for you
little parody Okay so
and hopefully it has nothing up upgrades
power-ups okay crash grades
someone jumping even though I don't like
top jumping I actually never stop
talking Works in this game so I will not
comment on how dumb Chinese is
I mean crash is also allowed to do some
single jumping
there we go that was a thing of jumping
oh my of course
now watch it become brutal horn later on
yeah
this is only the first world so far so
we'll see about that
I can get in some tummy time
so what I must put it up here
no there's a platform going up and down
wait 10 reason
well I guess there was nothing there
first there is a person in the first
thing was brutally hard for me I got a
game over on that now oh oh that's
that's
I need
because that's the 11 is premium
production
[Music]
okay
he's one of the easier levels to get a
gem on this one
[Music]
apparently because I've played that game
so much even as a child I said it
doesn't shine
whoa whoa whoa there is no coyote time
as they call it
the coyotes exist in Australia so if we
call it as a different thing I know
it comes from the Looney Tunes but
huh
an infinite number of scenes
yep and there's no no such thing as
soon as you step off the platform you
can no longer jump not sure why they did
it like that
China even the same thing to be honest
[Music]
because it means you can't really make
well
it's also kind of hard to see where
platform ends
no coyote you know staying there but
they do have dingoes
because I have something good time
oh time for Sweeney
[Music]
at least it's slow it's not like
good
whoa whoa whoa whoa now I missed it
well I guess it speaks now does he count
yes it does count good
they're chasing me oh the green ones I'm
not supposed to be here trust me
no no I suppose whoa
now I jumped over this
all right I need an extra mask
that one
yeah
the parliament stop stopped there Stood
Still and then and then and then the
screeching sound came and then
threw off the crash
and then yes he's creeping yep
from nowhere and you see the 3d effect
makes you mean weakness I guess it right
yeah I guess he didn't decide to make
the whole game in Cedar 3D although that
would be kind of neat to see
to be honest
[Music]
it was probably playing terribly but and
that's besides the point
S
I keep spelling it b-o-u-n-s it
so it becomes bounce
[Music]
and I do know that that's a joke that
Candy Crush go sweets but I'm I'm sure
he doesn't spell it like spell it out he
just says it's Bounce Around
[Music]
it doesn't spin it out
well
I want that extra knife
I don't need it but I want it oh my
bounce close one yeah yeah that was
close one more training
[Music]
b-o-n-e-s-n-o-n-u-s
there you go
how am I supposed to get those yeah see
it's really hard to jump
yes I should do that I'll take that one
too
one two three four five
metal plates
okay
if you spin that
I got all the boxes
22 out of 22 boxes in two night wait
where am I supposed to kill now I guess
I'll just do it even leap of facing
foreign
but
Oh missing one box but there it is
spelling it wrong now is Bounce now bye
oh yeah not made such a degree
uh first but I came and I forgot the
name now it's for just in slime
there is taking certain phrases and it's
switched out one way then
is it 11 day now
I mean I guess a lot of the level names
are like that but these level names are
like
too obvious if that makes sense
already uh b-u-o-n-s
oh and standing on the boxes that's not
allowed
[Music]
yeah
once it's a bonds round
22 3 4 5.
what
you don't have two of my ones
what's the point of this blocks
instead I said is there anything on top
nope
[Music]
yes
oh
oh my
[Music]
in this jumps everything then how am I
supposed to know
well I guess I know when I get this here
I guess I know because it says 47 out of
the 47.
not many fruits in that bonus
I know original music just copied
straight from Crash
console games wait no turnaround
animation
wait how am I supposed to
oh
like this of course
of course
one two checkpoint
checkpoint
come here
one two
three
what
Instagram
you're just trying to jump
one
two I guess I could just do that
all right less I do need host
the game is trying to do something and
don't sniff the need for a change
I didn't do that
and now
no I don't have
another mask
do I need to yeah I probably need to go
back
oh there we go
everybody wins this
and then I get to the end the game says
like
when you need to have color Jam do you
even get the one epoxy so
when
there it is
my life
foreign
six more boxes
five more boxes
died Grandma boxes
three boxes these don't count I'm not
sure what the point
fine
one
two three
four five
oh I don't get it
anyway
I got everything wait which is what
counts yay
another uncut gem
[Music]
last time and it looks to be under water
some information a lot of Celebration
okay
three hit points sure
oh
[Music]
you're destroying his
so this is basically
tiny tiger in
brush three
this is
attacks
what
and that was stupid of me I tried to be
quick
he does his attack until he stops
and just stops there
and then you can attack him and then he
sends out his
animals
what if one of the bosses is
[Music]
got something more to do
than just being a stupid monkey
[Music]
and then he
does not get a tank whenever anything
well I know where to go
okay I went back

going to do like that
underwater Dingle and died
laughs
time
[Music]
swing crash swing like your life depends
on it I mean that should hit this [ __ ] I
guess it doesn't hit him and for some
reason those go through his Shields but
I assume
crash can't
and you did that last time too that's
the same
dark time
[Music]
I didn't go for it but I mean
hey
all around here and relax I guess
what what
is this bus what a stupid boss

Jeff I jacked eye Yeti

[Music]
and then
there we go
energy million f71
what a way to end the 13th
whoa Here Comes flying seals
well not many boxes left in
here they are
look at this gem just Dependable it was
actually an animation
all right I haven't stepped on the
flashlight
yes
rocket racquet
this is another
non-traditional
so I can see that
but I can't cheat
and hold down the button
oh
yeah
because they need to get so I can see
I'm pretty close too
wow wow wow
what are you defending yourself
it's because yeah the pack doesn't mean
yeah
checkpoint at which point have do I have
to change
I'll do take some health
oh
oh no I'm missing boxes

yeah I want to go back and try again
[Music]
oh now it's flash it's nice when I said
shitty
hey you missing me
I can attack miss me if you stand still
right here
that's a quick way to keep doing that
crash one more
day again
[Music]
okay
the audio and
music goes on at 75 it can be even
louder
no no no
stop shooting me
I just did the hydrate
can also have house points on the scene
I'm shooting very nice
Bitcoin
so hard to shoot these you know
foreign
boxes
[Music]
I've seen anything one box
I'll do this
hello
hit
and now
the final
because I got all the boxes I assume you
need to find out
it will make sense if there yeah
don't shoot me you're dead
um what does it shoot with anyway just
stretches out his hand and his bullets
flying up the view and no animation
nothing
but I guess I guess he flew away but no
we're going to Crystal anything
in
yeah
just hanging oh this is hanging this
lemon this is gonna be interesting
Sunday
has a place I see you soon that's how
they are like
okay hold on to your heart you need it
yeah
this is like a Speedway level
yeah but still apparent one because
she's not timing
one is actually functions
and one that actually had trouble live
scene
wait
yep
one two three four
oh no
actually it's okay okay now
go
nothing suspicious here
yeah like they do these
uh
things that you have to
activate to continue but
[Music]
can they can you go back because I
kiss it oh
fancy musician I guess
thank you
I guess I guess when it comes to the
bonuses they are the most creative
[Music]
whoever make like I I yeah
[Music]
so I don't see any point of having that
scene because you have to activate it to
even continue
[Music]
can't seem like him
there's no point of not activating it
but my life
[Music]
maybe I can get it no
[Music]
of course I can do that
all right they
range of doses is very short one two
three four five one two three four five
one three four five one two three four
five similar boxes somewhere
[Music]
wait where's boxes
let me see two persons
is here
when I got an extra knife which was my
box says one against I had to go back
and
find them then
when to come in shine if you go
okay
share player did it crash band to the
right one
yeah watch it
what's that English
[Music]
but yes I am playing
[Music]
fresh
Bandicoot on the Game Boy it is
[Music]
all right I was not sure why I can't
jump this must be slightly high against
me
oh wait it's just oh I see it's those
two boxes that's and there's nothing to
explode this with let's see
I see oh you can't just jump over there
well in that case
[Music]
very much
you can do that
[Music]
that's a way to also get it
there's a bit of a possibility
how to get the extra knife
[Music]
frame
miss me four five two three four five
six three four five six seven four five
six seven eight
but
[Music]
so I will be missing too because those
are the two negros anyway and happy I'm
happy to see you again shy
I have a cleaning am I I'm just
perfectly fine

player today
I don't remember
all right wow I can end there
oh sorry I I looked at the chat
I went into that one
party
[Music]
oh another one of those
I'm not exactly sure it might be
a train
maybe there's a way to do it
okay
I didn't
oh that's a scary one I'm using this
this box can get together
or anything
all right because it activated that one
do they indeed
how many boxes left
yeah that slight thing is real terrible
in this game hopefully I don't need to
use it
we go
but that was sliding
crashed on your swimming The Shield
slime
yeah apparently this slime
need to be here please don't forget
about that
I accidentally pressed the attack button
but I didn't feel as it was that close
depending how much
apparently I was
wait wait
almost looks like this mice have
sunglasses
I am bathing at the moment
all right
Pokemon for this game replacing the
trash price with compost brains
this
I need a green one
I just wanted to take like a cliff say
look I didn't mean to be an optional
I need you
yes
to get all the gems
follow the
box system
around
let's party
like that
okay it's straight to go now
you have some shoot because some extra
because of the lives I'm missing well no
gym that time
shark attack
I thought it was short
[Music]
no not many attacks from YouTube okay
so but we'll see
no shiny gem there's a coffee near gem
babe you're in Chinese
[Music]
[Music]
okay there are a few shots here
these are supposed to have a chain
attaching them to the ground
yeah you can apparently not even attract
those
whoa
those things you definitely can't attack
final crash I guess you just have to
I guess there is nothing wrong with him
they can't become a dolphin after
touching a chip knowledge making a ghost
[Music]
[Music]
dolphin same thing
[Music]
we never go backwards
I think
yeah
that time he became a balloon
and you can see the polygons because
they have ripped it straight from the
play the games
even though they need this Sprite based
and therefore there is no restriction of
how many programs they can have
uh yeah they call geography season
limited right now
this place
funny tomorrow
I guess
isn't fully limited right there
you know what I mean
you never even see any
green boxes
[Music]
three nails
there you go
that was a short and simple level
ruined I am ruined my blue gem those
days may I have to do this without dying
[Music]
and there's nothing
that's a button
here it comes
okay is there another one yeah here it
comes
so far so good
anyway
you're duck
attack
I take that
oh no prepared
what's that iPhone
burn
but it activated something
maybe this middle finger here
[Music]
okay
just a middle finger wasn't there
anything up here
we're here
some of the middle fingers
wow
wow
[Music]
foreign
like this balance around

my throat
[Music]
in the minute wait a minute
dancing dancing little dinos
[Music]
point point
[Music]
okay
whoa that was close
[Music]
[Music]
okay thanks
[Music]
and then what I have phase plan
yeah that's your way
okay so I need to use the slide scene
there but it's so hard to do because as
soon as you leave the platform
foreign
[Music]
with the colors
[Music]
going to be a really hard
[Music]
all right
[Music]
well I guess I can see it worked
foreign
[Music]
it just happened to work
even two it's very hard to do
don't you attack me
thank you
no
I'm missing a box
where can it be
not up there
not over there
and not every day
[Music]
oh there it is
found it
for the one is my blue gem
where is my blue gem
[Music]
hi Jay
such small things back to me
oh four right excuse me don't shoot me
sir so I basically have to focus
different Fishman
foreign
so much health
hopefully there's now a level two
FaceTime
no
oh
[Music]
all right
foreign
great job crash
I have Hefty crystals now bring me
oh you know hey maybe the rest of them
so I can finish my machine but be
careful Curtis is watching you
think and Courtney is the best she's
already completed 25 levels
[Music]
I assuming there are 24 hours
no job oh
yeah sweetie thing
okay
hello
so much celebration oh
big scary one just came there
a lot of repeat things
I wanted to complete the 10th element
soon
oh
wow
it's like that and I can't stand
yeah I have Daddy reference on the work
you have to do with snow
what have I got
tonight is my wine
and it's not even the 90s
well
um
my horse is released yeah I don't think
this is like Game Boy Advance I don't
think
that scene was released in
like when I was just released
[Music]
I don't remember when it's I've got to
do the countdown
page with the year included
[Music]
I'm gonna be stuck here
[Music]
thank you
I guess it was closer to
then I saw it
yeah I can't steal it it's just
oh my God
allow you to
be the slightest of the platform and
then you cannot only jump
all right
[Music]
now I guess I can just jump up as normal
foreign
speed
but there are no checkpoints
you have to restart all the way from the
start
well
just
sliding from one platform to the other
they're not sure what they put an
enemies so let's start
oh my God
[Music]
speaking of 90s you can't forget
Animania extension broken radar
I am a Pianist wow and a kiss in my name
is
when items foreign
[Music]
jokes
in
to make the already crew jump scene
we're allowed to get in to look tamer in
comparison
and so the question is
why
come on why does that want to have to
attack me every time now
let's switch here
foreign
[Music]
from them is that
yeah what is the platform end
where does the platform and I don't know
so I just keep following of the
platforms
I guess it's very very close too
you can see this accurate or something
again as soon as it's the perfectly fall
down
no
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
there now
because that was perfect it's so bad at
the game yeah but that had speed I saw
that had speed
it reminds to demonstrate and I quote
that's this it's not brutally hard but
it's not pretty hard it says oh yeah of
course the enemy just spins forever or
why not that's that's right
there's the controls being terrible
but I Jam
[Music]
go it's just suddenly no speed
that's not how it's supposed to work
but but but how am I my I mean because
the thing unbox someone
able to jump over it
there we go
yeah never quit the game before
if I jump later I'll explain if I jump
earlier I don't get the box
it's like that time
mine is so pretty
yeah yeah
probably next place for the phone
is that too early
yeah well you could
could probably slide and get over no I
can't slide in it though it doesn't
happen
this night again every day
all right
in this game
I like a lot of games I have the same
issue of
you have this window
you can
do something within
and then you have the visual cue for
when you should do
but because the game runs one forward in
time
why is my speed
that means that
soon so you get you get to win between a
window before
um
you're allowed to do this thing why not
when I finally I got the mask oh boy did
that takes the Long Island
I didn't even get a jump
do the diving against the gym
whoa whoa whoa what is this beat come
from
I spent like 20 lives dying there to get
a single mask that's not how the game is
supposed to work
this game is broken
did you get like an extra knife after
dying
five times
but it's not like but it's not like I
can do the damage a pen I can't see the
top jump off the sliding anyway I mean
sure I can do the top Jam I guess it's
supposed to use it
and I'm playing through this game
without this I didn't even remember our
hands
something makes it
I don't even know anything about this
um it doesn't makes it easy
but that means
um
I did ask the question that was about to
crush three is it possible to do it
um
and without the power amps
I'm gonna be supposed to shops first is
it possible to complete the game
uh
point out powerapps and yes
and I would say that that would be
possible to do without thumb jump it's
just very hard to
yeah they put Minds in front of the
person
what
is going to probably see everything
way too much stuff at the same time
[Music]
too much stuff
but but if I land on it
uh let's start over but if I left but it
doesn't even save how many masks I'm
supposed to start with
I'm annoying
at least
at least the previous games
why not
saying cortex
but that game is weird
I still do want to do
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
yeah so this is apparently uh
glitch
in the pressure machine
in third game
which allows you to go through
decades
so I mean I should
probably be able to find a mod that is
the same as the game
it shouldn't be too hard is
since it's not
I I need to wait when you subscribe
I need to wait for those to explain
now
[Music]
I missed my mask
I'm playing terrible
so maybe you can't dance
no let me get those
I didn't get that one
and then it's the
delaying of the graphics is wrong here
checkpoint kid
Ney interesting okay let's see
I just need to
get through all this
now I touch that
penguin but apparently very dangerous
thank you
are those penguin butts are very
dangerous
because I'm just after one
what more Penguins no extra nice
checkpoint is nice
the the time you have
all right
time you have on YouTube If you react
for things to come up at the bottom of
skin is very very short
[Music]
thank you
all right
and then also react on what kind of
thing it is is that thing you should
touch
like a box or a boost or
don't touch the Penguins but apparently
not
apparently that's a bad thing
foreign
[Music]
where is my jump
oh
very high
no
no
don't casually strong on the eyes
[Music]
b-n-s-o-u
[Music]
h
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
okay
[Music]
oh it's ice cream
well I am slimy
some Icy warm it's okay so
[Music]
I want that
I want boxes two extra life 74 fruits
[Music]
come on
put put the missing two boxes I did all
that in the mixed two boxes
no space age of space what is that loud
at least not Space Age Speedway
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
oh
one of those TV platforms can I think
in Crash three they actually make it
very obvious that you have to use the
double jump yeah I think
yeah
now you've got a double Child Try It Out
but this game doesn't do it it's
impressed like
put some things you can almost see
without jump
oh no I like my space or something
[Music]
can be a bit picky about that
you should consider having Coronas
around
I'm not going to Discord
can I yes
theme
oh is it because you haven't pinch
breaks
you know what
hey we're sneaky
actually maybe yeah it's it's
okay
it might have just expired if you paid
for it
from this time last stream
really
not really now
I'm going to do this well
wow
each goes up in chapter but not on
screen
doesn't show up oh
you don't need it doesn't share of any
chance for me
so it's only it's only client-side for
you
[Music]
Lily
[Music]
I think even again
my name is
I guess I don't even know that then
but I won't eat
me
lots of spaghetti
well I guess she's just paid for this
leaking again
I guess it's annoying
more specifically closely
well it was quick enough
sometimes I am hungry
right now
not so many
snarky
what that are you doing any day
[Music]
oh now he's out from there what did you
think
refresh the street I mean
yeah I didn't have to do all that but
sure
if you want to
that's what I need
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
Okay so
the last one tries to write
so you can see Turtle right direct line
tries to the left so what they have done
is they have mirrored
cleared it
but now it doesn't even make the
perspective anymore why didn't they just
make it I don't know plain backwards
pixel fits the perspective now it just
looks ugly
but
but
that was me being silly
but
bonus b u t e o s
[Music]
my extra time
[Music]
I want that
aspect of Fame
51 boxes in a single bonus that's crazy
foreign
[Music]
our mask in a bonus what is this
[Music]
on boxes has been collected it says but
yeah yeah that was did you
celebration
okay
bottom don't mess this up for me
they show like bouncy boxes in this game
there's a lot of them
[Music]
I wonder if you were to count
types
so you're mainly mixing but mixing boxes
I must be that other area
oh shrunken City
[Music]
oh
well I know how to get that then
we have to find
an exclamation box
of metal
[Music]
swim through I've seen something
exploding that's not how it's supposed
to work
[Music]
thank you
I'm playing safe
and then I got B itten
I would save that one
oh that was his background
I don't know because it looks like
running around oh no that was not
happening
what
but my attack
but
b u t t my effect
[Music]
s
[Music]
okay if I'm going to go back I really
need to get rid of these things
butt attack
at the tank
there we go now it's activated
[Music]
oops that was completely wrong angle
that's the noise of a rabbit
[Music]
some is an instant exploded when it
touches the ground which is not how a
team team works
try
[Music]
try and drop me a TNT on the ground and
see if there's another instant explodes
trust me
[Music]
okay now I will not take that box I will
show you I can do this
[Music]
yes
it wasn't it wasn't like at the end of
the level or I think what
now it's attacked me what
but those were safe
what you can come just change the rules
of the sun I could
that's not fair
[Music]
because I couldn't even attack these
things
come on
yeah like fun now I get that character
what
are the enemies or not
[Music]
kind of like
kinda like enemies
I don't know what's going on with this
game
[Music]
why no checkpoint game says I have
altered the team play I don't after it
finally because I need to pick up
uh
I mean I don't need to pick up me but
but I still need to activate these boxes
if I'm going to get the clear gem
so I wanted to activate this and then I
want to get checkpoint
[Music]
sure it's going to presumably save that
I picked it up even if I'm dying
but it won't save the boxes but this
time when I picked this checkpoint up it
was the same that I have done this
and since there was no checkpoint
between this and the exclamation point
here again
the whole client
and
yeah
I am clearly I am a cleavage
it's a good thing you had to checkpoint
otherwise I have to go did you hold away
fight these enemies activate this thing
go I can pick up thing
Queen thingy
and another Chipmunks
I guess
I guess they kinda thought about it by
putting the checkpoint there
oh no I didn't see it just no it wasn't
no
this shark is kind of hard to see in
each of them being blue against the blue
back here but I guess that's the point
of the shards
foreign
[Music]
if I get
seven more subscribers I get another
email slot
no that's a smirky
on the pond
[Music]
because you want to alter a bit like
but I guess that's the
[Music]
when I redo redraw the emotes
and there's the last one
Release Me
I'm going to kill you because you didn't
die by the TNT I'm sure from Mario pipe
you
I got the Green Gem and I got this one
ice cream
that's this one oh no this is the same
level
[Music]
down the hill
this screen
Drive change page
that's how I checked now it's changed
Pages automatically
oh it's it's only shows you which which
color I've collected not which exists we
couldn't learn like an outline or
something no nothing
this is an original song for this game
most songs I like made from it on the
celebration
yeah
that wasn't this line button
foreign
licking the container
I reacted too late
no my stupid phone I was a smartphone
but now I'll have tea
whatever that
199 this is the last one another next
life
there we go everybody have you done like
my friends
there's no indication if there's a
platform here or not
one two three four five nope still a
smartphone
and the other one is Shining
moving
destroy those
that's not how it works those are strong
boxes no those don't not get destroyed
with TNT
you know inside
whoa whoa excuse me sir
but I can just but
and those are not supposed to get this
drawing
and I was starting yet
okay sir can you
okay
I'm going to bring this with me and I'm
going to explore
the under the ground okay
do it
nothing
but at least it wasn't a long pass or
anything
hello sir
I jumped into that one
all right
that looks like a continuation what's
down here this
and only there
I don't know because that's how the game
is
I don't know
foreign
it's too late
reacted too late
it looks like I had to get rid of you
when it's shooting too high shooting
over crash
so there's nothing there as far as I can
tell
and then definitely shoot like that
there's definitely platform there
yeah so there was just one life
one life
one last night I don't know 69.
but that was just me being stupid again
yeah
and that's not anything
this game is showing my stupidity
three two are these boxes looks to be
actually made from the pixel art
like this box is as I picked not mask on
it as I can tell yeah it's definitely
designed by the pieces
foreign
something tells me I should pick that
one up first
okay
I can't paint thank you
I like some head pads
there we go
slightly too tight
another mask
I need at least that works
okay I only hit pets and take all the
head pads all the headpads are mine and
no one else can have them
what happened to my
jump everybody's so new
[Music]
thank you
and what's the point of this
you know what thanks for it's time for
s-u-n-o-b
[Music]
nothing okay
yep
he's been someone called the classline
Clusters and want to say snob
[Music]
knob
I need to go back all day
[Music]
damn
[Music]
leaving back with anything else
[Music]
trying to
[Music]
point but
it exploded
oh yeah I see
[Music]
okay so I need to get that first then
no problem I can do that
[Music]
no problem
[Music]
one two
[Music]
three
[Music]
one
[Music]
so
[Music]
it was for some reason that
stays there everything you can treat
three extra lines there's no problem
here
Sammy shots
ah you can't hit
anyway
yeah
don't turn it up that one
whoa
what they are
doing the oceans
foreign
missing seven boxes okay why am I seeing
so many boxes all of a sudden
ly
salmon boxes
[Music]
why
don't shoot me planes I come in peace
I will be in pieces if you continue like
this
[Music]
oh a missing box said [ __ ] me
killing me
I mean I haven't gotten a checkpoint yet
anything here is restoring
then they know boxes should be missing
on this level
divided you need the reason that I want
him killing this level now you have a
health do you have a health percentage
in this level
[Music]
you might have crash always had health
percentage
this is
begun
your stupid planes
and
also you stupid
fireworks
at least again it's checkpoint on this
I hope
it is down checkpoint yeah
players should lose a lot of downstairs
so they nearly twice
the health app
oh no it's so much
about my stuff
you do get a lot of Health left
I'm soon dead
trash
no so close two percent left
no more stuff going on
right there to start as soon as I spawn
it's Computing and trying to take out
these boxes
five and then 46 this time instead of
20.
thank you
checkpoint
I don't prefer this box and Bombs Over
the airplane because
your bums you don't shoot back
oh don't miss the ball
we
we got so little Health left
should I get house for everybody
wow
take it easy planes
I'm just a little Bandicoot
my mission to shoot down your blames
nope
oh no
the house uh
what is this the blimp
chairman
I actually don't know if it's teaming
plastic important I've been
I guess we have the Oscar chairman
now I missed now
you miss me stupid phone
[Music]
and there's no uh
well I guess I should pick this up
because
it's better there's a Miss processing
what's his name
is TNT exploded on me finding it
explodes
saw that [ __ ] shot right at right at
this
why why doesn't it
sometimes it feels like I'm shooting
strike that but it just doesn't pop
okay
I think I missed that one
boxes should I have at this stage
is there for the
again
what is going on
why is it so hard to pick up the boxes
it feels like I'm shooting straight at
me but nothing happens I think okay I
should have said see okay so I didn't
get them last time unless I missed
another box this time but
so hard to do
[Music]
so hard to know
[Music]
okay
bang Speedway thermal exactly I mean
[ __ ]
but I guess the difference is here
there is no
timer but there's house
inspired there was no Health but he was
fine
anytime it kind of actors out
but I got it I got it
[Music]
tiny
yay wait a minute
but I still think there that should
actually
oh I see it's the
and then here is another day
that was pretty simple I tornado spin
which should be repeated it has been
longer and temporarily float
cortex I knew this would happen I have a
completely new voice now precious
defeated three three of your Stooges
he must be stopped I will not generate
another failure
okay I'm sorry however do not be overly
concerned
no
is that an ash by planetary minimizer
will stop him
isn't it tiny already like what this guy
is Tiny crashes living on the planet
crashes if it's tiny where is he what is
he doing where which where are these
levels
apparently there's only 20 elections
great voices
at least I'm more comfortable doing the
voices now because the problem I had
before before I reviewed because I'm a
trans woman
whoever is the second person here did
you know that there was a trans woman
even though it says
[Music]
um
yeah it wasn't less comfortable feeling
like male voices
but now I don't care
whoa that was close
spiced me
[Music]
okay goodbye whatever he was oh it was
one of those
things
crashed three music I guess with
think
with first two enemies
are you gonna do this thing again
[Music]
steam here
if you knew us yeah
[Music]
really you cannot jump you can watch but
you cannot jump
if you do like this and then I can
apparently can some yeah sometimes
new boss level
I don't know we got to use the
electricity to defend the
the noodles from the pumpkin from
licking it
fun foreign
[Music]
exploded all the boxes around it
not the uh not two boxes are my image
one box away
the meaning what's going on here
oh
ah
yeah
I haven't been like except for this
foreign
[Music]
no such that's tilted but I guess they
want the
salmon the ingredients or something
I don't know if that's seven degrees
I don't know
[Music]
maybe it does expect two boxes away
maybe three boxes away it doesn't
explode it can't be that's it
okay so I need to activate this first
then take that then after it is
thank you
I see
the world leader is just the word liquor
[Music]
oh
well in that case
[Music]
sweet box is missing
[Music]
pretty much since others need to roll
boxes
I wish they didn't count this
why do they have to count to the box and
here's the solution
it will be where we wait for crashes
change that rule now but here's my idea
in literal boxes do not count
ing
this is a one sorry to see that this is
a wall it's in background
and nature boxes does not count towards
the Box counter this also means that you
don't need this green exclamation point
box in the end
see
[Music]
I'm doing this carefully because this is
sometimes when I do
the whole thing
kinda
doesn't want to take both boxes another
one of them
69 boxes
where's my
bazooka
now I wanted to do the tornado spin now
okay
but then when I wanted when I actually
wanted to use it I think I did
okay
okay so I need to remove that that
[Music]
thing okay I guess it is
now avoiding traps
am I a trap
[Music]
questioning anyway
thank you
you're a bonbon that's correct
we talked about that thank you for
reminding me
oh I need to activate that first oh oh
[Music]
it's definitely fell down
[Music]
is this
do I keep it I guess it's a good test to
see if my kid can't keep it but I know
that it's hard to kill back then check
if it's not there
it's not a secret
yeah check for the refrigerator gem is
still there or should I pretend as if I
have it
because it doesn't show me
yeah I
forgot that it was off to the same
[Music]
foreign
oh and
it was where the taste thing is
another room writing
every game sure likes to break through
it's a fresh
fresh
checkpoint
foreign
[Music]
but I attacked it and it was closed
I will not dip us
here we go I will and you be the OS
when I do that
I only sometimes it's one to two
and sometimes I do get to
wow
the numbers level
wow but I land on it
that was rude doesn't taste that's not
fair yeah
[Music]
let's do it that way then
that's the way you want it
[Music]
okay carefully standing between noise
why are you in my way
I don't want to kill you but you keep me
on all this choice
am I kidding I do want to kill me
fine
thank you um
jump off
jump not
[Music]
enough checkpoint
thank you
all right this is that yeah
it does respawn
I'll take it
and then I go down here
pick it up
and then
oh well
their singing has changed
[Music]
then I'll bring it back because
apparently that's how I do
I would not even activate the
exclamation point
that's how radical I am
and there we go
kill everything
and now I got the red one as well and
how much is gonna say just to be on safe
side
so it has to be on the same with the
side easy see air supply
I suppose whoa another level of an
enemies right into the start
I suppose he has Air Supply I guess
that's what they
tanks are
but
you heard the attack that means the
attack got executed and why would it
allow me to execute an attack after
being 10.
come from
[Music]
electric eel I don't think I've seen one
of quite there are in question
uh there are no electricians in Quest 2
you can actually attach
I think
I assuming yeah there was those pink
scene that I didn't understand where you
were
and what kind of like enemies but at the
same time it's not enemies
they were also new to the swimming level
thank you
aren't there electricians in the serial
levels yeah I just remembered there was
and those are the ones making it water
electric and you can't even kill them
but you can't kill them here
[Music]
too louds not anything on up level
hey excuse me
[Music]
wait stop
laughs
and now I got stuck instead I've got
stuck
it ate my nothing and I died
[Music]
speaking of is that fairy that's a game
I should play
it's the stepper one Wicked Cricket
which is a game on PlayStation 2 and
computer but I have it
unplaystation 2
right now I only had a demon the
computer I don't know where
I want to watch the demos oh why did I
do that
[Music]
[Music]
in that game you play as a cricket hence
the term One Market cricket
foreign
electricity to attack enemies
[Music]
a bamboo salad
[Music]
oh I didn't attack but somewhere I could
attack it
[Music]
so you're an electric Cricket apparently
and then
the game is rated from three years
[Music]
which was the system before paying it
took over
can I figure out the attack pattern
and one of the death animations which
you can access very early in the game
I guess I could show it off I might
actually execute it it is
that the whole Cricket is split in half
and then you get to see a lot of the
intestines like the brain and heart and
stuff
Illustrated three plus
[Music]
but but I was in the middle of my attack
I'll definitely played heads
there are some lady
they're probably I don't remember like
being comparable because and red because
that's the only color female can be
while the men are
green blue
yellow
I'm trying to think of what this color
there are when I confidence
basically
[Music]
okay
we shall not
pink purple or red let me read this
one's the main color right in there
I want to see Maybe I'm Wrong maybe
there are some blue female clicks
nothing it's so long you're taking care
of playing that game so
[Music]
yeah to me a creepy feeling to it
[Music]
that's kind of maybe because of the
whole the slicing it off and getting
around the intestines oh yeah
yeah I thought about something
suspicious about this
it definitely exposed to to two boxes in
length but not three
[Music]
there you go
well every box
and you know what are you
foreign
did I add it to my
server suggested games
no I actually haven't I guess on
anything
[Music]
most of the games on my list are like
full series franchises
so there's like a title and a full list
of games but that I think is only a
single game yeah they don't have many
scenes in this game a lot of repeated
themes
songs
[Music]
right into that one maybe that's why I
don't have many views
people don't like my scene
okay like this I have an idea
What if I
do a karaoke stream before I move out
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
what are you doing
this is crazy
think about it
G for instance from all those movements
excuse me
trying to attack your blink why are you
defending it
it's the um
red airplanes
red and red airplanes with white
Thoughts with black
symbols
trying to think about what what symbol
did Vampire have is that what's piston
checkpoint
[Music]
foreign
words
thank you let's see
oh now we need to go increase again
oh
yeah good good idea for you to like man
straight in front of where I'm shooting
can't keep you safe
easy
for now I'm getting shot
sorry I've said levels easy levels is
the easy
no
coming back
no yeah
you look like World War One German I
crafted to kill the German Cross oh yeah
or maybe yeah
that could also be because I don't
remember the repair airplane more than
it was red and I had some
simple
[Music]
like
what's your best friend
what is more this time I don't know I'm
on [ __ ] on two planes
I think what stream beams normally
so maybe this is the last plane
as soon as you have the entire range it
starts moving
yes I I don't think the shots
let's focus on destroying that damn that
doesn't sound like a jet pack
another thing I was counting team please
now it's no I mean no no I think it's
been three drip drip trip
I could be wrong there but I think let's
see
but at least it's like
even though
come on
remember it's only and
it's a vlogs
and they never seems are kind of
repeated but
blind point and there's only 2011 so
I'm four
n o p u s I think I already did that one
there is no bus here
[Music]
um
I get the box at least but
[Music]
I think
it was what's what's so special
suspicious
yeah that's what's that one
[Music]
[Music]
I don't know about snap that's me bonus
bones no bounce ones buttocks
[Music]
and no bus maybe it must know bus I
wanted to go last time but I think
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
wait a minute
[Music]
no okay
those are the ones I remember but
[Music]
maybe
maybe you are correct
[Music]
[Music]
now
popcorn
[Music]
no why did you activate that no
um I did not get anything correcting
[Music]
hmm all right
and when
[Music]
that's what I wanted
[Music]
and then I didn't have to work that far
away
[Music]
okay so I need to
know how to do this
[Music]
probably
being he's quite a big bonus man
that's not this is no problem oops I got
a problem
I wanted to do that
but of course the problem is I still
don't access the line
and
this is not going to help me my sister
I'll never get that life it's a life
that is
taunting me forever
no 11 what
the beans level
[Music]
wait
beans but I don't have beans
this is the third animation I wanted
[Music]
I don't have beans to eat I don't have
beans
I don't have beans
in any shape or form
[Music]
come on come on
all right all right that's the hardest
thing now all of a sudden

I should have
and then on the wrong words
plenty of rice so
rice
[Music]
why is his jumps up there we go
I got a second chance
there we go that's what I wanted
[Music]

attempts
okay but this time I would actually
complete this level
right now
[Music]
damn damn
as long as it works
like that take that and whoa that was
close
[Music]
that should be connected that one
[Music]
now on the metal box
[Music]

one
I mean trash you don't have ducky
and he's big enough to like

the water oh no not that that one here
definitely doesn't have to touch
[Music]

steep deck and why aren't you string it
late on your stream days

context like one day of me streaming is
two years
three hours and uh
seven minutes or something

I have steam Tech boy from modding and
Mother's Day this is thinking if it is
this PC version of Crash four and if
that's the if the exact same version but
I didn't remember yeah people just
that's the case for aspires it should be
same okay so in that case you can just
add the mods just like on the PC PT
Siesta PC but it's a different form
fashion make sure you save oh yeah I
should say
I was thinking about
if it's an option
no scene
this looks a bit
[Music]
like I can't see
uh
[Music]
the game is too loud I don't care
20.
