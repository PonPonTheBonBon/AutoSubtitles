okay let's see no no one's here
as far as I can tell the audio is
actually working
so the only thing I can hope for is that
the
picture uh the UI elements are showing
up above the 3D objects
if not then
I'll just deal with it I don't have any
other option
so it's this or nothing
and Reddit is the nothing
I was surprised yeah yeah I guess the
the issue the result was so minor so I
got it sold and
I rather not sleeve on a
Tower note what do you say like that
so
I already just do the Stream
because it's more fun
no surprise
hi hello again
and are these working this time I got it
working okay now we can skip on this
well yeah
[Music]
hello maleficord
Bishop so the UI is buggy I have no idea
how to solve this but I'll just have to
deal with it
[Music]
okay I continue
[Music]
I got to the start last time how did I
do that
[Music]
I don't know how he did
[Music]
I can go to this menu and
interior
to any other tutorial on how to get the
game started
I don't know what Cisco I would play
through the game without UI if that's
what I have to do but but how did I get
the games to start last time because I
at least got it starting
party started
yeah what's that
that was I was going to quickly check
like uh
phase three or something on YouTube
yeah yeah
[Music]
I don't need
that's plain
okay so it started load game
and then you press down
okay first of your start you need to
step down first confirm
and then you get the menu uh
that one
[Music]
then you press confirm and you press up
and confirm
and saves
and then you wait
this done
and then you confirm
and then it should begin
and it does not begin
I'm a huge fan of billions but yeah
how do I
I'm kind of stuck here
I'm kind of I kind of navigating blind
at the moment
[Music]
oh you press square
wait is that continue without Saving
Private is
and we already saw this but this
cutscene cannot Escape for some reason
I don't know why you could skip all
cutscenes in the first thing this video
is talking a new game
the problem is I'm not going to be able
to load
the game
we're too late and you got the new game
yeah I was kind of going for that that
[Music]
I will check how to do the load game
next time
that's enough for next time it is it's
like the adventure
is up to low interest so it's fine
you get to hear spikes again and the um
and it's adventure just navigating the
menu
I don't know why is this broken
it's just the car copy the game
because
buggy what
trying to kill us
that wasn't her fault she was being used
by the dark master
that's
what this dream is one and a half hour
late
but that's
that's already sometimes
hello never
I know you can't never it's never not
good name
and never hello to you
uh hey congrats an affiliate
yeah thank you it's been
it was
20th or 29th of April
no it's
not been a full month yet
haven't you been here since then I feel
like you have been here
okay so this is what I have to work with
now this is this is the URI the top left
corner and it's behind reading
environment but I'll do my best
this game is supposed to be harder than
the previous game
so it's going to be even harder now I
haven't been here quite a while
maybe I haven't
it's
it has felt like you've been with me
this whole time
my mother these Legends finally what did
you want
that one the demon it said it works
all right I can pause
I can't live there oh yeah once I think
I want the university activate something
that's just to make it easier to read in
case I'm speaking over the dialogue and
also there's a nice effort those who
prefer
reaction faces
Pleasant stream thank you
have a pleasant looking
nowhere to reply
[Music]
I am building
my stick
I mean that's cooperating with me
nothing wants to work with me
it's like suspicious this doesn't
exactly look like the
okay uh spicy amount to go this way
those stories are quite loud we mustn't
wake them what I can't hear you over all
this snoring
this is as annoying as usual nothing has
changed there
why are they just sleeping on Stone
I had them not make sure that eyelids
are fully closed
the settings are completely different on
the legends inspires
yeah
okay why can't I play through that
thought about that
learning radius is terrible as usual
because the Dragons sleep on Stone
what was done forgets
what's up Daddy's
except that is on but there's no yeah
the subtitles you know the subtitles
easy UI
I just want me to do this okay
subtitles is the UI
you're not going to be able to see the
text above the 3D environment
[Laughter]
they will hopefully show up in cutscenes
and stuff
yeah I don't need to slow down it was a
setting for that in the first game
is there something today I missed
somewhere easy
brightness contrasts after this
vibrations Left Right skin position nope
and wide not wide screen just wide
[Music]
yeah I can do this
I don't even get anything from those
enemies
okay that was a very long sequence at
least the game is running smoothly and
as I said another game
where was where did my dumb champion
but I will try to replay
uh
code
I could explain
what's the windy there was a problem
because apparently as far as someone
that told me and it suddenly has
completely messed up the lower
resolution
it's dangerous it seemed you shouldn't
have followed me
Yer that's good enough for me see ya
don't buy slime for me than it already
is
trying to understand
but you're all I've done all I've put
you through
stay sender nobody blames you for what
happened
huh I do speak for yourself Sparks no
sparks is right
and every day that goes by I'm reminded
of it
Spyro your place is here your destiny is
here
somewhere out there for me to
meet us Cinder
I don't want you to go goodbye
I've seen that you're just going to get
cashy buddy dark master again and then
we're going to be evil again
but I tell you
Spyro you okay buddy
hey I want to sleep too but I didn't
mean now
let's at least get inside can I see your
favorite Dragon inspired
who's your face fast
[Music]
it's everyone's favorite spider dragon
the dragon inspire
inside question open for everyone I'll
say
hopefully
oh Spire stood up for like
difference
such a nice game this is
hello
frightened young dragon
You Are Not Alone who are you
what is this place
the celestial moons are counting down
and time is running
okay
I guess they're doing in engine
cutscenes now instead of doing like
[Music]
stop
oh sorry spider let's make it quiet
yeah it looks so weird when
it is the DUI instead of it's like right
in front like between you and the camera
it's it's far in the background
oh it's slow motion
the mind is seen there for
particular reasons oh what are those
particular reasons
how did that happen the purple dragon
can wield many abilities that others
cannot
cannot time itself learn to master this
ability and you will be able to see
things almost and get subtitles but
use this gift sparingly only when
circumstances demand
manipulation of time is not to be done
without the uttermost care
that's some
mainstream adjustments but
oh is it actually providing
will be you now
it's not
it's just it is giving
I hear
it is providing a better picture it's
just
here we go
just less the crop
like that's nice
to give a nice picture overall
I mean that's good as you can get on the
what was the prompt
that was the death button
she is inspired by Maleficent okay try
again
and there's the best instructions first
element the start to stop Dragon time
the blue hourglass bar
let's keep trying
okay
I did it
foreign
having slow but
I
they have changed the timing when it
comes to double jumping
they require you to convince them
require you to commit to the double jump
more than the previous game
yeah I've done it
activated so I didn't die
but uh yeah
it's your destiny to harness the powers
of the elements yep
who's this
I haven't been able to use my abilities
for some time now yes
right now your powers lay dormant within
you
see if we might not awaken them
clear your mind
animations
allow its heat to consume the
ariser
and release The Firestorm within you
Excellence
you're a natural
but now that a primal fire rages inside
you
show me you have commanded
you have
the awaken the fire
let me just go here read it
you hear me like the final has been
inspired photos
press up please select the file element
in the future press X I mean cross this
cross button
yeah nice feeling of a day health and
everything
okay
I'll province
oh it's fighting time
well my favorite Dragon Spyro since no
one else came and answered exactly
maleficor
oh yeah their health is going to be um
behind two eyes one
so yeah you're probably not going to be
able to see their names
which was half the fun in the original
game
Ember is my favorite because she is Pink
and it's meant to be cute oh two at the
same time
but the action Enterprise
it clearly wants me to do something else
now
I don't need that
come on fall down thank you I guess that
works
nothing beats the name we teach
no come on what happened there
I
mean you are correct
but I mean we might see a second test
I'm getting a feeling that this is going
to be annoying
so second game is annoying at muffins
excuse me
I'm trying to knock you off to that one
coming coming
foreign
goodbye
have a good life
the rest of it
but did I do it
oh did you count that as a failure
because I didn't do it properly
okay oh here we go that's the
instruction that is played on this game
for a few seconds
thank you again
he has a funny charge
I don't know it's called because the
game didn't tell me
hopefully you'll be able to figure out
how to fix the UI I have no idea how to
fix that what am I supposed to do
oh we are back in we are back
I got the game running it still has the
exact same issues
uh yeah I was I was supposed to explain
what the issue was replaced since I
think I did
which is that lesson three does not
really support low resolution that's
I've been told that Sony messed it up
somehow
and therefore and I have accidentally
set it to the wrong yeah I set it to a
component component what do you call it
component
instead of composite
so now I saw it yeah so it was set to
576
red probably gives health
I don't know I can't see
now the box is gone green probably gives
press as you should
be too hard to figure out
blue and gives a level
and the high later taser so now I
switched to
1080i because that's what this is
1080p doesn't do also does it do
no it actually runs it in
well it doesn't say anything here or
anything it runs it in the 576 P instead
of I the two should be Progressive
enough English accuracy
and because I fixed the graphics
or is blue
timer
let me test that let's lower it
no it is not timers
so it's left maybe let me check yeah
there's level here
that's all I got
blue is still leveling up then
and you don't get
a match up the blue crystals
here we go
again
[Music]
that's a shame I could Farm some
leveling here
that would actually be fun
if you could
I need to remember I heard the dummy
jump
in becoming max level from the start of
the game
and let me guess I should take the
perfect one
[Music]
and this will shut off my
this one all right don't judge me up
quarters
[Music]
[Music]
and then I activate this thing
quite soon being a spider
I don't think it's supposed to be that
same thing
and then slow motion because
it sure loves its slow motions
that's why
everything has been lost this sale plus
self-explanatory that's my English now
if rock is mentioned something in see
that I'm screaming again
and this time you need the game
you have done well
now it is time for you to return but be
careful spiral the enemy approaches wait
you still haven't told me who you are
you shall know me as the chronicler
seek me out
maybe you can tell me where you are
so I can't seek you out
and yeah and no idea what the game is so
weird I could try to
find some solution
hello hello hello hello anyone home
hello hello
something is happening Sparks
explain it
yeah maybe
what is that
oh no not those enemies
what's happening time in this animation
is such so weird
the temple is under attack
we're going to have to find another way
in come on I like you better when you
were sleeping
of course you did spikes because he's
such a
let's save no memory card please in
Center memory card
um okay
yeah
that's one
is a scientist that one
maybe that was the issue there you go
what was it what was the memory card
removed
that might explain why I couldn't love
the game
if I can't load the game next time I
just have to show them because
this is
the
who was the other one please
I don't need to explore
he's perfect
now that we've exchanged legendaries can
we fight
I think that's
why
Sparks it's not it's not okay to make
stereotypical noises about the people in
it
even if they're your enemy
I want to check out the other place
excuse me
I guess the way
that's where I came from
[Music]
I hope there are any enemies
wasn't there a game where you looked up
in the sky to see your
be like
oh
delete the words that was the time
if there's not too much Forest that
could see the health but looking up in
the sky
and basically do I not know UI run at
the moment
oh
my God
excuse me are you trying to contact me
from background
I do not approve of that
so
these are quite tough to deal with easy
to get rid of but that's okay
oh thank you explosions for getting rid
of the stone so I can move those
oh this attack is today
oh this feels better
no way
any secrets
one of three others
[Music]
what they run
nothing there
[Music]
you know does it seem to move faster
so should I just step on that
and I step on the rest in that case
oh I see
yeah Sparks stand on this
and you just need to run
I just need to run right that's all I
had to do
it I have a sad idea
too much startup on that
I can do that again let me do it
immediately instead
nope
okay I tried
this there
I mean this this one but maybe I can
knock it up
[Music]
I wonder if that will work
and what what exactly
what am I is there a detail I'm missing
is there an instruction that I was
supposed to be given that the game
forgot to give me or like you know I
can't read because I can't see the UI
hi oh yeah I forgot that time is an
ability I would probably not forget
about the ability if I could see the
time ability I mean that's the obvious
relation here
like I just can't see the time at the
moment
there you go there's time if I could see
the UI I could say all right I got time
why are you slow okay
this doesn't make any sense
[Music]
if you slow everything down you will
still not make it
okay it's infinite can I get the name
from Blue please
purchase one
[Music]
[Music]
and it's an inability too so
didn't see that coming
no that's
careful about these floors
they don't
let's explore here down here then
uh this time
and Jaime is so weird in this game
thank you
yay Christians
they get more
is this a way to farm level up
didn't see that coming
I got more level up
the very very little though but
oh it actually shows me how much it wins
that's good
it's still not enough for the next level
but
that's an upgrade let's see this can
come to certain things better
there is
this issue wait I don't like sucking
it's obviously not an intentional sign
wow
thank you
but I guess that's the
Jesus attack it Mark they came with
digivolous design
okay so I assume this floor will
crumbling if I step on it
but
it doesn't seem to caramel professor
next location before it starts to catch
you
it's weird
all right bye
I'm doing something
[Music]
it got squished
and it makes it stopped
the music
oh the the enemy said stop stop stop
when it becomes
up immediately
hmm
are these platform here
it's like
why did you close the door again I'm
still here
[Music]
come in
thank you
I don't know I'm out of energy
now it's hit me run
oh I think I'll jump that high
how's that
yeah since this continuation or is this
just a bonus area
I don't know
[Music]
what is this where I came from
maybe this is where I came from
yeah this is where it came from
all in that case let's continue
[Music]
no not these These are so annoying again
well they're dealt with
it
[Music]
it's probably enough
[Music]
because it runs by run run run
is to run already
I think I have the strength to go on
last Friday gives up now
you probably needs time again even
though the time thickness just
and these are back but the gems Jam was
not back fully
it was a mistake
[Music]
so if I
[Music]
this one
the case is different because that's a
big one
actually
I have please
[Music]
nothing there
okay
just more of the same enemies I don't
know
there's supposed to be anything special
I mean there's there's this big person
which I thought before
I didn't
see yeah I'll just stick here
thank you
okay
oh this guy's look angry
there's such a long charge distance
okay I can't survive like three
hits
healed up
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you
and these scenes when it shows something
so slow
oh
okay
[Music]
then it shows that
doesn't count the middle point is not
like
point
on it
don't fall down
I've got to remember my training
which training yeah
okay you're training
I guess that worked
running in the eye
hip hop on my face
oh
don't cry at the other sudden as well
no secrets there it's a great place to
hide a secret
am I supposed to get done here
yeah
oh yeah that's best
that's what the fantasticity and the
spinning yeah
[Music]
excuse me
let's squish this
[Music]
thank you
excuse me
[Music]
yes
brunch okay it's not easy because
I recovery from money gets knocked over
before you can do anything and let a new
enemy can attack you while you're coming
excuse me
I'm defeating
I'm defeating your time
okay that's a mess that works let's see
if I can repeat it
[Music]
that's certainly makes it easy to deal
with them
if I can remember that wait up different
fighting technique for once
[Music]
well they're running away when they die
a blue mushroom I want I want that yeah
um
okay cross the bridge even though I
didn't have to
yeah
one more of these
do I need to drop jump
okay so it
[Applause]
is
this is
yeah the game is the game is seriously
crashed
so it doesn't seem like I'm going to be
able to play this game because of how
unstable it is so I gave it to him
at least again hopefully
it does have out the savings so it
should hopefully save regularly
and yeah I'm not gonna keep any more
attempts trying to play this game
because it's
uh I gave it to your attempts I guess
that's my luck for today I'm still happy
that I was actually making the game
because previously I was quite upset
because
I had traveled with my PlayStation but
the PlayStation seems to work perfectly
fine it's just that
low resolution is completely messed up
making everything act weird
but as long as I run it at high
resolution it's very specifically fine
but the game itself is I is messing up
that's not the console's fault I mean I
mean I assume the game like final
PlayStation 2 but it might be the copy
of the game that is faulty so I should
probably try to make a new copy of the
game
and
try again
try again next week that will be because
yeah what else can I do at this point
and if the game just doesn't want to
work next week
I'll yes I'll just have to understand
you
so
[Music]
yep that's that's
no
yeah yeah
I mean at least the console is working
because I can bring up the PlayStation
money
but so it was just the game because it
got stuck in uh some kind of loop
that's that's fun not really it's a way
too many issues for today
I enjoy just doing that I mean what's
it was fun when it actually worked
again the game was a bit frustrating
because I couldn't see any actual
messages and stuff
but aside from that
it was
enjoyable I would say
and thank you later today sorry
for showing up
as you can see on the schedule Saturday
Sunday will be dog's life I would
hopefully complete it and then I will
try to complete it 100 completing the
mission missions I have skipped and I'll
just
and then
I've only got one opinion on this I
think
I should have for the cute bun bun
yes thank you thank you
I'm glad you like the kid
no no I got distracted
yeah it will be earlier than this time
four hours earlier when Easter and when
it was meant to start you have the time
there if you know where if you know
where in the world you are
if you are in the part of the world that
that isn't on this list you can either
just write it in chat right now and
state where you are so I can edit or
send me a whisper if you don't want to
make it publicly that's perfectly fine
too
and and then that's that
oh yeah I was I was going to say and
then after completing dog's life I was
thinking of trying to exploit the game
uh through a bug and oversight they have
in the game that allows you to get an
infinite amount of Bones is a very slow
process but the goal is that I will
start a new game
and it's the one of the very first
missions in the game get
90 bounces the goal
and then play through the game and
avoiding everything else and see how and
see how the game handles that
and that's about it
it would be possible to get thousand ten
thousand bones even in gaming though
it's supposed to be 125 I think
and
but that would take ages of this I won't
do that and when we can kind of measure
how long it takes to collect the bones
so
I have a problem there but it's little
process so I hope some people show up
and chat with me or I'll just give up if
it's if people can't bother with it that
sounds fun except this part with exploit
okay so you're on board after 100 in the
game but not the slow part of the
exploit I mean I don't have to do it if
no one's interested
I might be interested but if no one else
is interested I want to do it because in
that case
but we'll be able to start doing that so
it's all good yeah well in that case now
we can comment on things
we can do we can do polls if a lot of
people show up and they're like you can
people can come up with that question
and answers and we can see what can
people vote for something or we can do
like predictions we do like
um coin flips or something if people
want that that works too
I wrote in favor
yeah I didn't mean at all if I should do
it or not but I'm in different parts do
you need
I really did already today so I guess
so I guess there's no point in doing a
second one
oh well
no it feels weird doing a second one
I was
thank you and I will hopefully make the
game work to next Thursday and Friday
but at least I got the complete by
Legends by one day
I guess I was actually planning on
starting inspire two next next week
anyway so
and I have nothing but yet so
if you have anything more to say feel
free to write in the comments and
otherwise
thank you all for showing up showing
this weird times
and
yeah does it seem like anyone has
anything to say unless it's massive
stream today
so goodbye and
okay goodbye
I can type it in the chat yeah
