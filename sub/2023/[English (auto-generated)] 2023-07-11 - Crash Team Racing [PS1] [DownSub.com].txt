welcome
I got to say keys
oh there's the key Stacks Stacks stack
because I I didn't think about that
hello kitten
[Music]
um and that's actually kind of
interesting
because I had one key and then I had two
kids I was thinking did I get two keys
since I opened the last door
and because that means that I should be
able to open two different doors but
that door required two keys and then and
then next door requires the three keys
and
apparently I assume you get to keep the
keys because that makes the most sense
key it doesn't simply break after anise
yeah but I understand why they do break
it's more like
not that they break it's that
this key only works for this lock so
it's very good controllers here and so
they simply clear is from your inventory
because you don't need it anymore
outside station
but in this game they decided the keys
works for every don't worry and you get
to keep the key
s yep now I'm talking about keys
outside station let's go
after I do all these trophy races I will
do
types of finishes
at the start of this
she does comfort food
I'm silly
huh
this is Spanish
we need more of it
now
[Music]
I didn't get released
all right so down there okay now
I don't have to set the fruits anymore
[Music]
stay here
no don't steal the palace
Fox Steve
thank you
I need squash through these cards
missing everything
yeah I wanted something more interesting
oh no I missed it
they're so cute
I get to start gonna watch me thank you
purple
flowers
there you go I actually hit someone
[Applause]
[Music]
or something
not crash
that just crashes us
all the time he says
[Applause]
last night because I need something I
can attack
not these
this doesn't have any other hands
in the rain
it's in the wrong thing
getting something in useful
why why does it give me the same thing
I have some positivity in the air
makes perfect sense in the crest
universe but
all right that's the last thing I can't
tell clearly
they're here
oh
that's that's good
because this case must be boost
still uh second place I think this is
The Game's being silly yeah same thing
over now and then
[Music]
basically at the triple mask it really
should show you it only shows you a
single mask
but it really should be like
oh
let me jump
it really should be like a picture of a
triple mask
[Music]
all right then
[Music]
this game took inspiration by
Ulta
still the wrong box it's not too late
for it oh Elder Mark carts for your
hands coins
yeah
you need to connect
freaks
but interesting as far as I know
my coach
came up on the idea of
having coins
um
when I brought it back
shall we okay
[Music]
while in the original game that had the
coins
you didn't really have
and they meet you how many you could
have but he said they have a limit of
10.
I was introduced in Crash team racing
and pair this tomorrow for me
there you go that's what I wanted
exactly
[Music]
not sure what happened
foreign
yes that's what's exactly what I said
no
obviously catch the racing carpets
yeah all right
I need one more there you go
what have I got
[Music]
it
and I still got second place
okay kids are smart are you saying
random stuff
and good job
at least second place doesn't win the
game apparently it's only the first
place The Liberation sorry second place
is neat
valid
[Music]
so okay I I
don't think we have the round boxes guys
I remember
and it's fruit
we have fruit boxes they wanna I mean
there was a fruit box
it was in the wrong position to pick it
up there we go
now
to do all the things too from no
business section up to eight
milliseconds hey
for every person make it longer and
longer
he's just too dead
I'll take it but
it's obviously what's supposed to happen
[Music]
no you did the same thing
a TV series section still it's one and
three and three
if I started serial
you do what you want
yeah
like a sequence as the box is expanding
again
I'm gonna Master my experience
because he's protecting me a lot of me
I'm not good at counting him
this uh the house before the jump it
didn't be that hard shouldn't it
there's the hands here we go that's
Sarah

so long now we prove who the fastest
driver really is
okay
why not
let me saying
how many trophies ready
Steam

compared to your previous game having
like 32 lemons
this one is 16.
[Music]
only two keys
this is not the place I want to pick up
[Music]
guys I didn't have to use up
what I need
I'm going to be listening but I'm going
to be cleaning up a little bit in my
house that sounds good
keeping your house clean
doesn't cut
[Music]
hey it's cheating
okay
it's throwing out everything
hey guys
all right
here
I know I'm like really far behind
negative juices and stuff like activity
like I'm second place I don't need
a thing too yes
okay
[Music]
this is too much stuff
[Music]
all right
I wanted to quit
yeah I'm definitely not good at this
they certainly increase the difficulty
way to equipment
[Music]
let's go back to the first world
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
should be the first one
and Sanity Beach
thank you
so let's do this I'll do it
okay
[Music]
amazing challenge okay
collect the letters c t and r on each
track and come in first place to win a
CTR token beware some letters are hard
to find
foreign
but he said something is hard to find
but I also need to come in first place
what an appointment
is it difficult enough
[Music]
you're gonna say there are no power-ups
[Music]
good start
[Music]
okay this is
requirement to get into some water or
something
[Music]
here you go
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so my only question right now is oh
hello
oh yeah I see I see
I see I was supposed to do
and welcome welcome to wave
across the sky
until it's supposed to do this there we
go that's the tea
that's the eye
thank you
so that's the scene which I missed I got
two more left
it's hard to take the left hand this
time I still messed up
the other way
connected compose themselves he has some
questions
it's so cute
oh no next thing
but it's nothing you should consult with
lucky
you don't want to share I just find you
I expect
that
[Music]
come on now
there we go
now I just need to win
[Music]
yes and as I said that I cracked lost
another place
here we get it yeah that was close
I was in second I was slightly impressed
and I got to pass that I buy another one
okay
[Music]
it's not too hard of a challenge
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
except my opportunity
[Applause]
[Music]
all right please
[Music]
that's me
[Music]
what's that last
it doesn't really come crazy stuff for
you had to pick up eight coins as well
as Windows the coordinates which game
came out first
and some of those coins were kind of off
to try to have to go out even way to
find it because
it was first
[Music]
yeah means I think this game was kind of
late
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
all right
too bad
my dad said the girlfriend this time
[Music]
[Music]
hey oh come on
[Music]
what there's three silver
mm-hmm
[Music]
doesn't want to see anything tonight get
back
unicorn racing
don't become amazing
[Music]
[Music]
double duck sauce or something
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
and I had coordinate that smile inside
so that one's pretty good
it's your token I worry
I ever
killed me yeah wait that leads
it was a bit easier
nothing I guess it's just up there but
not at the top
a little bit weird
these are useless now because I unlocked
everything
okay I guess I'll get for you run it now
[Music]
get the lowest time you can by racing
fast and breaking time crates each time
crate you break will freeze the clock if
you achieve a low enough time you will
be awarded A Relic
[Music]
um
I mean there is
there is a blue shot equivalent
and but apparently the computer places
never use it
yeah subscribe
snow
[Music]
[Music]
honestly ready
hey hey
no let me see
if I think they actually show us
everything
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
punching
[Music]
well it's going fine
I am
leading to heat fat aside from that
[Music]
[Music]
it's a hand feeling better
[Music]
my name is
[Music]
fine
I really are worth it
new high scoring
I hope there's not nothing like it
on Sally I cannot add spaces
I don't need to retry
I only need Relic
I think I don't own anything Relic I
don't think I need to go really
great beautiful Relic
a crate why can't change character
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
character for each track
because I need
speed cornering or acceleration
there's no option for that I guess not
maybe I simply have to use Coke of
everything
let's find
you can do that
see if there was an option no I guess
I guess I just have to just go get for
every race that's no problem
just wanted to see what my options were
let's continue
let's do this CTR challenge we'd have to
see TNR
Coco team racing
but there's no team why why do they call
it fresh team racing there's no team
it's a free phone
as far as I know there's no team races
anyway I think there are I haven't found
them
thank you
there's a hitting attacks and it's
picked up
oh he's up there and I was supposed to
keep that one I think
something and it's just I have no idea
how to get up there
oh
yeah and this one I should do this
what yeah something like that but it's
bad
[Music]
maybe characters are crash team
[Music]
I don't know okay and now
[Music]
wait
it's somehow
I need to get up how am I supposed to
get up there
wrong way
this makes no sense to me
[Music]
I have no ideas
[Music]
thank you
yeah this isn't killing me
[Music]
so it's not the same reason did she
crash
is the crash but it's nothing
another is like a Sonic Team who's this
one development what I can't even get
dialed it
a developing yes on game so you can have
a Sonic team racing which is a racing
game developed by the Sonic team but
as far as now they are not known as the
crash team so that's not something
the sharks
I'm honestly complete how am I supposed
I have no idea I was against this
supposed to pick up now I am confused
I can't say that
it's too bad
I don't want to actually have artists
this one
thank you
and of course the other one which one
you accidentally picked up the first
time it is
very busy
[Music]
yep I have no idea I was supposed to get
that living
[Music]
well if I can't get that letter I can't
complete this game
oh you want
[Music]
no dress anymore hey Kitty cups oh I see
the seven redeemed that ninja Steel
[Music]
yeah
it's somehow
together
I don't know how
wrong way
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
long way
[Music]
all right
till now
this is a puzzle
that I don't even know how to solve that
wrong way I don't see anything I can use
[Music]
because you can't get up on these
platforms
does not want to kick around
there must be something here I can use
to get up there but what just you can
barely jump
[Music]
nothing on the other side of the beach I
mean sudden certainly I cannot just stop
the race and turn around here and do
something and they continue the race
that would possible take
way too long
wrong way and finish everything yeah did
I miss this space race
I mean I guess upside now I didn't do
that one
against the crane way too much too much
for deciding to do all the races to do
to sometimes practice currently I'm
stuck at getting these settings lately
because I have no idea how to get this
message
and I just can't get let's do it
I mean there must be something here
I can barely jump off it
oh I know how yeah
wrong way I don't
everything
[Music]
wrong way
[Music]
and it's an idea yeah I seems so I mean
if you haven't
[Music]
thank you
okay
yeah he needs to speak because the
camera does himself wrong way
I mean that's how I was working
wait
he can do it he's very very
precise
there you go finally he did it
[Music]
um
this celebration okay can I do that in
an action race no idea
[Music]
I can't even get that one
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
even if I try to take it carefully I
feel weird
like crashed into the wall
I guess I'll take the glitches on the
first lap around and then try to relax
the races
two remaining laps
[Music]
assuming the game has a rubber banding
keep missing
and that's the only way to do it
[Music]
that's the only way for me to do it
considering my skin
I know it's these are much faster with
getting it
I'm just
good at it
accidentally did it the first time
around
yeah
we go
what's up now I just need to do this
chicken
[Music]
nice
I missed it
now I just need to win the race somehow
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
wow
[Music]
I got so confused about anything
[Music]
I guess I'll have to find slight
inclines
celebration
let's see if I can do it on time
[Music]
at least I don't have to make that weird
jump
and then they put boxes on
up there
these boxes are not located insane
places us
[Music]
and I guess
kind of shows here how to do it easy to
relax time first
first
nice going
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
thank you
let's go
I wasn't prepared for the jam
King too early
the box next to the beach
is in the Box counting down
candy box but
okay I can probably the best fight
better
and I can play Interview like a master
but of events
oh it makes sense
there is a box
what is
it did was he said to retry
Relic did I invert they retry and back
the map options
[Music]
or did I just remember what I did last
time
there we go
like a Mustang
I can't get to take comments after
[Music]
try
[Music]
I tried to sit
[Music]
[Music]
and I'm gonna mean it so far
I should see all the way around here
instead of them
definitely like these batteries to take
the Boost at the time away
I left one behind one box and I got the
gold
I feel yes that company mode I've been
here
but you have this Advantage but you
don't have to take it down
oh first position
he probably just remembers what it was
said to you last time but it makes sense
that it would automatically set to retry
after failing and back to map after 16.
great you own a relic
thank you
okay I said she did it right all right
secrets
[Music]
the red ones I'm done
[Music]
Rose tubes
[Music]
I I'll hide it again
I actually had it quite often so I don't
think that I really need the hydrated
thing
and can I do that hydrating
[Music]
but if I wanted uh
wow
that's one
out of all of them
no nothing
nothing
foreign
[Music]
yeah I'm not doing my best but I think
it's inside right that's a good enough
for me
to State I mean like it was kind of
obvious
your time is left on the Sci-Fi I wonder
if I got this off if I got there really
oh that'd be ready
if
any five streams oh and there wouldn't
be a high today I would forget to have a
drink nearby but one that would one well
one that one would change hydration that
is
[Music]
annoying if you get I guess that's
that's there is nothing
can I look first because when you get
Relic you you respond at the start
location of the area
but if you do the CTR challenge you
respawn air in at the level button
did they test this game
so they did so they basically did it
yeah
always spawn at the level put on instead
I'm lucky the original castings
well you just need to figure out what an
exercise and last one I think
there's still nothing doesn't certainly
seem like this that this level has many
secrets
[Music]
technically a second I think the second
letter of the world is
let's put the tea on the weirdest
confusion
thank you
mushroom
oh it's like you did a merry way
[Music]
hey guys
easily is made of tea and orange instead
[Music]
thank you
and the art has a weird shining when he
finished doing his teeth
don't get awarded CRT so you're
collecting faster relatives crazy
oh CTR that's right it's wrong I can see
yeah
you might have to say anything what are
you collected I mean no okay now I
started from this one
but then we had came
[Music]
okay I'll do the CTR phrase if this is
like a letter that doesn't cook using
place I'll give you the rally you can
see if there's any boxes showing me how
to get to that City if I can figure it
out on my own
jerks work better when you don't get
them
[Music]
yeah
[Music]
that is true
nice points are the first letter again
when I ride this around the morning
anyways
[Music]
let's see
it's a bit too easy
RCT what's that
radio controlling tracks
[Music]
oh yeah
that's everything
RCC that's the best place
[Music]
maybe if I'm not terminating
the system
[Music]
okay nice no yep oh
this is changing
another one
it's perfect
you ever heard of the movie terminatory
I mean I've heard about it never watched
it though
foreign
[Music]
let's do this I can do this
more important
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
let's go
okay let's see if I can oh
let's see I'm gonna jump in here
I actually cut it
ah no those came out as a surprise
[Music]
[Music]
all right
traffic control of how to teach I can
kind of do it for testing myself
okay
again
well I missed it
[Music]
all right
[Music]
it counts
what a sapphire today
from fun high score what I don't like is
how Southern character like in entropy
clearly has a space in the name but I'm
not allowed to put one
that's not fair
that means that the space character is a
valid character I just am not allowed to
be insert it I wonder if I can do some
memory injection
great Relic
this so that means that there's only
this one which only has here with your
broken rocks
these things
collect every crystal in the arena
before the time runs out if you can get
them all you will win a prize
it looks like my price is a CTR token
entropy use
I think
[Music]
wow
[Music]
coming soon
oh it shows thing
I need to
beat that
[Applause]
foreign
getting an item animation
probably just instantly give me that
now which item is going to be
[Music]
yeah I'm still
I don't know if there's nothing against
the best way
[Music]
well I got 19 or 20 okay
[Music]
the ones that are
[Music]
quite Fresh then there's only one for
11.
I think I know my last one is
it's gonna be starting
that one
[Music]
I haven't speak my last one one second
and I didn't
pick emotes
with the hands glued together
I did it now this hair on and his event
that means I should have cleared out
everything here
[Music]
yeah
that's same
[Music]
okay
[Music]
thank you GD stands for go get it and
drink
wait that's the space area
[Music]
which is the snow area
[Music]
I made part of the music is that how it
changes today
it's closing
more
emailing and stuff
[Music]
before I pass
they need a name might be put both with
us close calls
yeah yeah okay let's I mean you're free
to add the suggestion to the sermon I
can add it
emotes
thank you
[Music]
much time to work before
oh there you go
find something
that is maybe I should say that instead
then there's the first one
I guess that should happen what that
is
well I guess it is
for one for the road
[Music]
I only found two letters so far
the arm might have been defected
the sea is the first level
RC seconds
[Music]
unless I do that
[Music]
okay we have some fruit that start is
good
that seem to be insistent
ly
yeah
okay the wires squishing Mouse mice can
come out
[Music]
[Music]
CTR challenge you don't say this is
quite a challenge
[Music]
so
[Music]
come on
[Music]
lips are so weirdly
[Music]
no see you later so far no I just need
to figure out how to get here
okay
you're quite far too last night this one
you can see randomize it so you know
can't
which I guess I'm thinking out now the
wood is randomized you cannot figure out
in what general location is it easy
and that's why I was confused it's
pretty bad
so I guess uh that's fine
management appear weird
perfectly
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Applause]
come on next to it
why can't you set foreign
come on
[Music]
come on
what sense is that that ability
[Music]
okay
okay Chris
finally manifest it's going to win
anyway so
we didn't just randomly show up I
wouldn't have done anything
[Music]
so close
[Music]
okay
[Music]
all right moment
[Music]
yeah wait
why yes
why did I restart all the way back then
that doesn't seem fair
[Music]
I'm going to be lurky I'm going to be
testing something okay
[Music]
[Music]
see
[Music]
it's bad oh
I'm sorry
but I guess
anything I see
so
here you go
come on
[Music]
come on let's go
[Music]
come on
much kind of jump sizes
wow
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
pass it on
whoa
okay something
this might mess up
nope I got it but
why do I just
come on game new change
thank you
here's another is Casey he doesn't want
to give me
a sound position
there's someone by
[Music]
some nice
strange there we go
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
all right
[Music]
keep me songs in case someone tries to
ask me which would be very easy to think
[Music]
foreign
thank you
perfect
[Music]
yeah
the same way she's responding if one of
the strength yeah maybe I didn't get too
far ahead to reach the next checkpoint
when I wasn't on the ground enough for
it to consider
the American place to
start from
him sweet
A Relic time
because there is there is a respawn
location
because it's a first section of jobs and
the second section of jumps and there is
a respawn location
[Music]
in before the secondary
that's what I did when every time I
don't respond from that one
okay
got some weird faces
I guess I'm glad there was no letters in
those weird locations
okay my name is at least
[Music]
[Music]
I got it
they haven't removed us
[Music]
you guys went so far
am I supposed to even get there
thank you
no
I am missing polygons
I miss you allowed to
that's dead dying
I guess that was a lot in the restaurant
and they trust me for the amazing as
well so
[Music]
[Music]
three minutes to stop my time let's
quite
a long train
ing
[Applause]
[Music]
I must be able to hear me now
long time I spent on the track
no I don't even see like a
deep in the ground to use to
and then get a jump in the car
foreign
[Music]
right jealous
did I have trouble
this track or something
when I have such times like exactly
three minutes which they had in you
early
which I had in there
the rest of Cortex that that was because
they basically haven't set the
temperature outside
[Applause]
but I want to see
if I go back here
because it really should show a gold
religion
no it doesn't give me any information
and apparently there's no back button
either
you have committed to do this track you
cannot leave
I think if it's like started you can see
but it doesn't show me the goal running
[Music]
there's some
like
at least the incense really shows you
the times but you have to press a button
to show it maybe you can do it in this
game because our secret button
you do have this menu so you can see
that it's zonably really quality
in this one you can see there's a corner
and it is the laptop
this is a more convenient way of
checking it anyway
we give it that
okay I'm doing all the transplants
[Music]
let's see if I can get these letters
that is Tiny why is he staying tiny
anyway this is because oh he's a large
cat let's call him find me that would be
funny
[Music]
because it's almost the Year 2007
that's the peak of humor
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
or something
foreign
[Music]
thank you
this evening that's this time no
I guess that letter is a bit tricky to
get then
back
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
they keep stealing my boxes like how I
was in third place this whole time and
then he comes and I miss it I guess that
letter is kind of hard to pick up hey
it's what I said yeah it's kind of like
or Damian
but not least
[Music]
it's a
it's it's the antagonist's arena
of
dirt track like a lot of jumps
you're not the mainland time it's like
one of the minor environments
thank you
you can't have nothing
now I just need
[Applause]
come on
[Music]
I think brexit the game The Last Resort
nicely placed
excuse me they all right
thank you
[Music]
it is an interesting decision that
off track
I think
finally
between the race anyway I guess I could
do the arc for my name
okay
if you want that
Brian give me some boxes
happens
he's having multiple times right
I'm going to get a box and then just
one of the races behind his speeds past
me and steals to drive from me
yeah
and the arms have to be down there
oh you're trying to pass me
another thing happened
anyone finally
four minutes okay
I got the token
and this isn't like an option Challenge
and yeah he's
celebration
and our last nothing to make challenge
like Hunter does
oh spider you want to face the other one
versus one well you have to do this
extra task I don't have to do
to win
huh oh you got to the girl before me
well you didn't need to do this extra
time so it doesn't count
and then when you finally beat him
he gets even more annoying and like oh
you're really good at this it's it's
almost like you've been practicing this
instead of collecting the dragon's eggs
which you were supposed to do come on
hump day
I
uh
country's so annoying I'm talking about
hunting and crafty
it's the worst cat thing
sensitivity is
taking my head
nothing to get
not getting those
I can't think of one boxes
can I get that oh I did
something
oh no I jumped over them
right
[Music]
I don't get stuck on the wall
all right
yes that counts
[Music]
foreign
boxes on the track here too
chose extreme
without a freezer o'clock
[Applause]
all right got it
I'm not gonna skip this one
that's me like I need to game seems to
be quite generous about the time
thank you
foreign
[Music]
ers
[Music]
okay it's on the seconds left
perfect okay
like three seconds to spare
ready
he shouldn't stopped and now you're
right keep doing that
[Music]
oh yeah engine also got a space in the
name
I I want a space in my name
because I'm pumped on with the space
that's how it shows up
um
on my Twitter
what more do I have in
how does two are the yellow tracks
[Music]
[Music]
there we go here here's another one
Dragon Minds
[Music]
this one
well I'll see already letters are placed
this time
so industry Place let's use the map
[Music]
oh there's one this is too hot to pick
him oh I'm not in first position
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
okay I can do this
yeah it's time for 11.
the the opponent seems to peep I I don't
I'm better at game which I am
and that's not the head I didn't like
that
but I do feel like the opponents are
easier
um this kind of challenge which kind of
makes sense if you have to focus
no this is an easy way for them to do
that but I'll do that like in the first
lap beginning
[Music]
there he is as hard as it is
[Music]
definitely being the pose
[Applause]
foreign
[Music]
boxes I think
if that's apparently giving you more
speed
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay
don't do not miss that one
of course you take two naps there
I don't want more inside
[Music]
and of course I attend the afternoon
[Music]
I'm not sure how the Mist sets up here
you go
for how the bottoms up came in
okay
oh my God this one since the last one
that but I have no idea
it's bad
I don't oh
this Editions
[Music]
yeah I can do this
I've been closed so far
[Music]
pink clothes but not close enough
[Music]
to take this course don't let me
thinking
[Music]
when I crash anyway
[Music]
all right sorry behind
it's annoying
you got nothing enough right now let's
see
[Music]
[Music]
there you go
I'm not doing turkey for everyone
it's interesting yeah
well I'll take it
cannot take my dress back to
[Music]
[Music]
let's see if we can do it on time at
least I don't have to
attack enemies and watch out for that
hey
all right
[Music]
there must be some other way getting
it there
[Music]
I mean if you just you kind of show me
how um it sounds supposed to take a
little that way if I can get others
[Music]
big boxes
[Music]
[Music]
gonna go
[Music]
yep
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
missing boxes
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I think I think that's
that's fine
and sepei
it's probably some extra ponies trying
to get on
success but do I have to get all the
boxes and get a good time or is it
enough to just pick up all the boxes
I'm getting all the boxes I I
can't go straight through the box but
the Box didn't break
and these bees
we see great
is
[Music]
okay let's see
oh
the letters are placed this time last
time that's one of them is
at the end of the track
on the ice that could be a bit tricky
yeah I guess so this is why the
president
anyways
[Music]
okay
[Music]
this one
yeah
that one was interesting looking
okay
I don't want nothing to see though
oh there it is
come on
come on can I do all this in last minute
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and that was easy
cutting on the last laugh and wondering
I don't know how that husband hey
how that's happened
where he was
well I you could even see it when it
rain started it was on the ice in the
background there are okay that makes
more sense
okay it was it wasn't many frames in
view I was passing it by but there's a
lot of boxes on ice
they do like to put a lot of questions
[Music]
no I'm missing everything
those boxes all the way up there
[Music]
between us again
now continue picking boxes
[Music]
like
oh I see I see what's going on there
you are too fast but I am a bunny
Bean is my theme
and it's an answer being fast yeah
it's me
but I have to be because this is going
crazy against tires
nothing nice to hear
any scenes now that's not considering
enemies
thank you
one instead of three uh it doesn't
matter if it's a closer to him anyway
okay you're really covered it
getting close to the car so you can see
the pixels on the wings
they need
to exit
I guess you can see most of the
what's going on on the screen
system
Rocky Road
[Music]
apartment is covering up a slightly part
of the screen
is it the same time
oh no
it's the same like the rest of course
that killed is enough to eat what do you
need
I don't know
and in general cortex I only need
Sapphire I didn't actually need them
I know I know I didn't need God's
unlocked it takes two levels because we
don't need that
oops
impressive anyway but you do need that
interest me to get lost
gem
[Music]
with our own perfect place
right
you guys enjoy
and practice this
to him yeah
pasta
okay
licking pasta
I guess so I like eating pasta
[Music]
let me go this way
I have to do it the other way around
[Music]
I guess bombs
unless they don't require me to do any
precise stunts ticket
and after remix this time
I guess
four more
I see him on there where's the other one
is there on this corner yes
oh okay
I got that no I didn't get it
oh that was so close
is the closest zipline 2016. one part is
leaking pasta that's what she does
[Music]
foreign
[Applause]
lonely
but I think it tries to make sure it
tastes good that's a good reason
[Music]
and it's not too hot yay this is cleared
out I should say
because this is the places
foreign
company
and now what's the next area that's
where I came from
I guess
what that doesn't
[Music]
over here
[Music]
kissing song
there's chips in town
yeah I made some pasta shells filled
with a ricotta cheese a few weeks ago
took a bite of one that was still too
hot some of the cheese got stuck with my
teeth
and very so very interesting
um
that sounds terrible
hey let's see what's too excited about
it
at least
yeah I've I've tried to eat too early
myself and
actually eats everything yeah I guess
that's enough of the game
and
that
catch up I did something
oh I got it oh no nothing else
but it's missing
come on I just spawned in as a bad swim
spawn location so there's this letter
do that again
[Music]
is
[Music]
I think take this path this time
others
T4 Junction
and there was nothing I could do to
dislodge you just had wait oh I mean
I guess you could go and get some cold
water but I mean it's a bit too late now
and then they
come okay sorry from that didn't I write
them up jealous effect and it hurts so I
can just now you hurt this picture
fidget paint
oh hello my father
you've been here for a while actually
I've not been paying attention sorry
about that you brought eat Peace front
and squeezy
he eats peas and everything
by the way
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
now
oh boy
but since I basically
trash anyway let's just do that
I'm assuming it is hard
and if I can attract nice
and now
that one too
I think
there are only fixed position and I'm
currently between the boxes
[Music]
forever advising that it's perfect
[Music]
hello autism sounds
yeah
but one last opponent
but this doesn't help me
there we go
[Music]
oh someone go inside
another one
[Music]
hey you're not supposed to pass me I was
supposed to win
that's what the heel says
[Applause]
oh ask me
foreign
I have played it once not too long ago
versus mostly on the tracks there's like
one spirit
I don't have much Nostalgia for the game
but of course
okay
but it does have a
what it seems as it's from Crash
and I did play a lot of Crash Growing Up
So listed in Nostalgia again from bed
give me the the basically using all
these sounds the incorrect way
as I think
brush three actually had a countdown
sound because it had an actual countdown
but I don't think that was killed
themselves
which also makes it weird that
the rest of Cortex didn't use the same
countdown sound
I actually don't remember
maybe that was the countdown sign
and keep them into that one
put on the buses
oh this one hiding
and this one hiding dirty questions
[Music]
all right
foreign
take that
okay that wasn't fun and one slows it
down
um
well I was close all right I got stuff I
think that's what pants
I play this one piece quite a lot
yeah yeah
I don't extremely stallion from my
journey the first team so I'm happy

first lap around
