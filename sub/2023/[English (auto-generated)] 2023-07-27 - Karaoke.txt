welcome everyone
I haven't been this nervous since I feel
my first stream
I did some Itachi's way
I'm glad to see here hey your first chat
it's nice to see
and what the bunny
got here first
uh
you should do it in person
welcome he came in
just in time
a lot of friendly faces
so yeah
I'm very nervous
and so
so
yes yes
unless it said karaoke so
I'm going to do my best singing I of
course not a not experienced with
singing so it might not sound that great
so
I'm very happy to see how they support
so
I had picked up picked out a few songs
here
from some suggestions some of
of my own
choices so it's
about six songs will probably take it in
20 minutes
now I don't know how long I will manage
to do this
this pop plus the
process is one of course
and then
I'm not much
clarineties
would that be correct
I guess I was thinking uh I guess it
wouldn't be wrong for you know to
basically comment on how don't like you
don't
worry about
commenting on My Singing
obviously don't say anything you can
grow it but that's obvious
but if something is funny or or so not
feel free to comment we we have we had
to have a good time
so I was thinking just
when I guess okay
I'll just go through these songs in
come all day and see how it goes
is everyone or is it or everyone
should everyone is so everyone or I
don't know I don't speak English
your voice sounds better now that's good
I mean
I wasn't trying like
before
which wasn't
uh I don't see much but anti-voice
actually has no ranging and I don't have
any musicals I feel like my voice
doesn't have much range either
which is why I've struggled with some of
these songs that's why I want to start
with I guess it's a bit the final
content but whatever
um yeah front countdown because that is
one easy song for me to do
I might think one day I would that would
be amazing to see so I guess I'll just
start with this
um this NCR news
and I hope everything shows up properly
on screen
okay
did it go
better than I
was hoping for
best score so far
I hope I hope it sounded well good and
yes
a little bit later or they say I don't
know what you should call you
tonight six times it's like the teeth
waves in orchinoco I don't know about
toshinaka
what this person you like me
oh no all right
my subscription to Lolly the ended like
yesterday so I don't have I don't have
this
I went
I wanted to post those
you need that music I love you thank you
kitten
so another one let's like move my up way
up to harder and harder songs I guess
that that seems very
move my way up the list
as as you know the earlier I've met
really the song comes the harder it is
maybe maybe not
it was really good thank you and so
let's do
um
cartoon here's the Sun
yeah I can do one I think
[Music]
we are what we supposed to be the
English and stop your fantasy all that
same lies that we can say what we do is
[Music]
eating ice cream
reasonable
[Applause]
party
[Music]
thank you
[Applause]
[Music]
he's true but just remember that what we
use
[Music]
yes please
[Music]
with me
anything like that one hydrate
some of the lyrics
but um
and some of the lines I I just can't get
the correct pitch I know
but I hope they was good enough
I do
yeah
even though I've gone through two songs
still I'm still nervous
we'll keep going
yeah I should go yeah she keep going
when I have me I have the
the uh
I don't know what to say
so someone suggested you doing yeah
caramel dancing so this one is in
Swedish
so let's
and as you might know
wait I'm a startup
I completely what I was going to say
okay something something like you might
not know this but I do know a bit of
Swedish
should I hit the Swedish phrase routine
yeah yeah I insert the whole song
so I can
okay okay
let's do this
is according to it
Canada
[Music]
wait how am I supposed to do it
[Music]
is
[Music]
yeah show me
today
[Music]
dancing
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
please
[Music]
again
I wasn't prepared for some of those
lines
that's a popular song
they do have an English version but of
course I have to do it in Spanish
so it was my Swedish pronunciation good
bye pipe
so
I
have trouble remembering Aqua is a
Norwegian band right
I should have done my researching before
Europe and cameraman I Swedish I think
is Norwegian
so so now we're going to
Scandinavia here it's beautiful
thank you so let's
well
let's move to
the United States I guess with
I can this one the chorus is very tricky
for me to get the correct pitch on but I
hope they get through that it should go
much better
foreign
yeah I guess I could
add one note that that well the Swedish
word for caramel would be spelled with
an K and of the C
where they have chosen a c I don't know
so
[Music]
that's
I'll do my best and see how it goes
[Music]
can you feel me when I think about you
[Music]
with every breath I take everything
no matter what I do
my word is an empty place and I can't
remember
[Music]
I don't know if it's something rush but
I always need your face baby I'm missing
you so much come help it I'm in love a
day without you reason yeah Without Rain
I need it by my side I know a heart
survive a day without you it's like yeah
Here Without Rain
me
oh
[Music]
these stars are burning I hear your
voice in my mind
my heart is yawning like the oceans
that's running dry
catch me I'm funny it says I think
around these crumbling underneath her
feet
won't you say me it's gonna be able to
do any game
oh baby I miss you so much you can't
help it I'm in love nothing without
humans
by my side don't know how I survive a
day with arguments Like That Be Without
Rain
[Music]
oh
[Music]
stick around me baby baby
[Music]
Without You It's Like A Year Without
Rain
yeah
[Music]
I'm missing you so much you're helping
I'm in love a day with arguments like
I'm Here Without Rain I need me by my
side don't know how eyes divide I think
without you is
[Music]
oh wow foreign
[Music]
but for some reason the uh
I'm not sure if you call it a third
verse
that one worked perfectly
a perfectly perfect for me okay
exactly six thousand points too
yay
oh
foreign
off if I understand the whole system
correct and it will still count to our
uh as a correct tone
medium
as far as I can see you're probably
better at me than me to determine if
you're half turned off it would not
count as the correct tone and I assume a
half might smash you down to quarter
tones
but
that's that's just my case
is it me me how they doing different
rabbit oh
oh
well
I guess I should keep going then
and this one is obviously her United
States I actually don't know it's just
my exception
considering the theme
let's see how well I can do it
[Music]
[Applause]
I'm I've been walking these three so
long
singing the same old song
I know every cracking these dirty balls
I walk the wrong way
my house only is the name of the game
and nice guys getting washed away like
the snow and the rain
[Music]
this thing I love the compromising on
the road to my Horizon
but I'm Gonna Be Where the lights are
shining on me
like a Rhinestone Cowboy
[Music]
s from people I don't even know
love is coming everywhere
when I really don't mind the rain
and I smile again hide the pain
but you're down when you're riding a
train that's the only way
but I dream of the things I do
only thousands you
ve been alone to compromising
on the road to my Horizon
but I'm Gonna Be Where the lights are
shining on me
like a Rhinestone Cowboy
[Music]
The Rhinestone Cowboy
s from people like don't even know
Buffer's coming over to phone
you love this song I hope it I did it
well enough for
yeah that's for the song Fades out so
there's no more lyrics
is that uh not others not nothing and
nothing to the music it is a nice song
um
a man's getting better
yay
hello Papa when did you show up I'm
basically I'm going through all these
ones now and I'm getting now starting
here exhausted
how many songs did he manage to catch
yes well I guess you can join on the
last song then
which technique has been a secret this
whole time it's just it just it only
fits five songs in the list so
the last song
he doing great he's so beautiful thank
you kitten
is what about my dreams
it's a Eurovision song from Eurovision
contest 2011 which assumingly which I
guess you could guess from the release
yeah
and another song I'm terrible at the
start of the song for some reason I just
can't get notes right but then
then I get it
oh this is the uh
spiders
in the middle of this song
so
party
we get to hear from us
I want to read it
How well was my pronunciation
last night
yeah it's gone for 35 minutes now
and I'm I'm definitely starting to feel
tired
foreign
I guess
I guess that was only songs
yes thank you hello shy
unless I should do one one song one more
time or something of any of these songs
probably one of these three that I did
the best we can probably do it one more
time
if you if any of you would like to hear
one more but you want to hear that one
hey
I mean I guess I did that not too
terrible but
it's so beautiful but anyone else has
some suggestion
okay let's see I guess any of these
songs then
it's my favorite yeah I do it again I
guess so
if if any of you want to hear one of the
one of these songs again I I could do
one more
yeah I'm I'm the best at that song
I would argue
and it's it's also the one I have the
most experience with so if I should end
this stream on a high note
well I guess if it would be
and I
which of these songs actually has a high
note at the end but I don't think
none of them have
I guess they what about my dreams is the
closest one because it has high notes
closer to the end
yeah as I say I prefer one of these
three and I guess I'll do Final
Countdown if I may vote myself to hello
which I which one would you like to hear
or purple wolf you're free to come with
an opinion too
but all of myself it's just
party rocks
from the list
I don't have preface well because
I guess he came in at
rhinestone camera or something
which I guess makes a big reason for me
to do Final Countdown this show how well
I can do it so you can hear that one
okay
I'll do it and also
which I didn't mention
Ed
hey hello Hitachi again you you revert
something let's start the thing
and then you have been great which is
perfectly fine you're free to be quiet
thanks really interested countdown
I I didn't I didn't mention the first
time I played it and maybe no one
noticed but
I guess I guess it I'll mention it
afternoon
yeah yeah
best so far
thank you
this was fun I was so soon there is that
start
and now
now
and see what it went through it all
good you have to thank you
so beautiful
unless he was here I don't know
anything and being all quiet I think he
was at work at this time so
so maybe
but I'm happy y'all you you are not here
my good friends
so
that's it that was my my karaoke stream
and
I wouldn't have missed this
what would you would you miss her so
it's just just one more thing
I wanted to say
which is also making me nervous
but I really wanted to say it
and I don't quite
she can do it okay okay I can do it I
can do it
no
it's it's been amazing support and from
from all of years with me guys uh yeah
here comes the big reveal
and like
and a lot of p a lot of people have said
that I have such a beautiful voice I
don't know how my voice sounds now I've
only seen and practice before I did
honestly if you like my voice is a bit
tired
and it means a lot to me when people say
that I have a nice voice
because I love you
because because
the reason is
that
I'm
actually a trans woman
so
it's
so it really means a lot to me
so so that basically means I was
assigned male at Birth
but it
it will come out to myself a year ago
and to some friends
but I've never been public about that
I've never had a reason to but
after streaming for this long
which has been
April May June July almost four months
now
there's been many situations where I
have restricted myself from what I can
say
and
so
and I basically pretended that who I'm
not
like like
talking about how I was yeah
but
drawing FS okay was a little girl I
think growing up and that never happened
so uh
so I just want to be more open about
myself
and the switch Community is so
supportive of me so
this thing has been so amazing and so a
few people already knew that
but some of you
probably have guessed it yeah there are
some aspects about me that this is your
place it's too expensive so like like
it is some of you might not even had a
clean differently
so yeah so I would just be open about
that that's no secret anymore
foreign
and I guess I guess that's that
it's been amazing
it it was such a lifts going through
this thing now I think getting out with
all these
yeah
build up
so
since since the stream is done for now
I don't
[Music]
I think if I'm missing today thank you
so this um casually I don't have any
need for anymore I need
I'm back to the regular schedule yeah
thank you so amazing oh I mean now it's
not the time prescription seat I wanted
to end this thing now and I was thinking
about who to rate
and
you're amazing yourself what I was
thinking see you see that that means a
lot to me when you call me I don't have
dancing and that that's kind of what
some people have said that yeah when
when some person said that yeah it is
quite obvious that you're a trans woman
because you're so focused on your
femininity
and yeah it kind of It kind of boosts my
self
-consciousness I don't think I don't
understand what the correct thing it
just feels great
that's what I'm trying to say
[Music]
no
I mean
[Music]
so
when you're super adorable
I know I know I so I was I was thinking
about if I should read and only do again
which I did yesterday but like
uh
but she she has she's currently away for
this moment so if you don't mind like I
don't know waiting for a comeback
and there was no no not yesterday the
last three I meant last stream
[Music]
so if you don't mind that you should get
any moment
so
we can see it's such a nice and she's
drawing at the moment doing
emotes for and I'm streaming
so uh and it's a nice place for me too
wind down I guess
so and I'm very happy and if there's any
questions if you want to like ask you
feel free to surprisingly yeah
I mean I could write beforehand
yeah I'm really sure to press the red
button
as soon as he's playing or something
okay it's going to be a surprise to me
I really enjoyed today's concert just
saying wonderfully
just I just don't know
[Music]
long ago she went away though second
estimate anything
I mean she should be back in a moment
by the way I really enjoyed today's
concert is saying one funny was it
really wonderful
is it really be honest now
I mean it wasn't horribly as it was when
I started back before I even did some
practicing
at least I did that
yes okay
thank you for everyone
yep
you are so nice
your kind of cute dude
especially your furry friend you have on
stream
as a very cute little
um you should be back in about now
I'll prepare the rate
[Music]
at some point
so
otherwise
they'll be right back screen I shall be
sure
and then you can tell how great the
thing I am
[Music]
and I'm
surprised about myself for this voice I
managed to make make because I did some
voice uh practice
and indeed a recording of my own
feminine voice listen back to it and I
was surprised of how much I didn't like
it
not many people would not like their own
voice I guess it's not the usual voice
icon with before but but I really like
how it sound probably because it's
affirming much so
that was really
I think she's still not back in the time
is running out
I'm
I I'm going to change that I'm going to
restart it I'm a cheat day
[Laughter]
a very long time
oh uh I did say I'm just going to shop
you need to be a touchscreen anyway
but I didn't
but I chickened out have a great
Thursday
yes I meant what I said
you didn't test that you just saying
that is true I just went out with it
went out with it I don't think that's an
expression
this time I just left the counter
countdown even if she's not back she's
not back and that will be it
hey have a great time again
that's perfectly fine I respect that
have a great Thursday YouTube

of my advice from the Disco server yeah
I don't know like we did probably we did
it probably did and you forgot links to
everything
Oh you mean this oh yeah
the idea I tend to go get that
oh well the timer is running technology
is impact oh well it would be a virus
back evidence
myself
