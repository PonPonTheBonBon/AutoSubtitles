Pon on a
leash taking Pon P for a
walk I hope she isn't causing too much
of a trouble when you
[Music]
walk you need your
own little white bunny with pink eyes
and a large pink bow years that are so
long they reached out to
ground be the best
fny do you mean the feral pon pon or the
answer
P
okay let start a new
game how far can I get get through this
game without
dying B oh Bow of course of
course so how far can I get before I
die
okay there we go that's
your that's your
options good luck
everyone and then you
can yeah I guess you need to show
it is a very good you have good emotes
red C is a good
designer
um I just need to answer this message on
this
oh
oh would have joined
but doing it's don't stream at the
moment sorry for
delaying I like it's 18:00 now let's go
this is when the stream should have
started let's
go these are all I have at the
moment oh yeah because yes the other
ones I just the twitch
ones lime
gun I see when I make it big I see what
it is but the small size is very hard to
see it almost looks like an elephant a
blue
elephant the nor one is nice the
blushing one is
amazing and of course delicious
perfect
so the only thing I have to do is not
die I'm not going to do like 100% the
game yes to be clear about that this
challenge does not I mean I already
struggled with you
know
[Music]
um just 100% the game with that this is
the like the level
luck and again checkpoints are
completely
useless everything is useless to me
right
now what I have to do is not die the
only thing I have use of is the
masks I guess dying a bonus would not
count as a death because the game
doesn't count as a
death I guess I would save time here
but and you had see more progress though
[Music]
o have in progress are high rate and
H
I think this will be nice
too let's go I'm allow to take damage
just not
die I had the idea of doing like a
no taking damage round of Spyro because
doing a no death round of Spyro was too
easy not to brag or anything but I do
have it on YouTube you can go and watch
it
there after
stream when that one cannot hurt me in
this state is it annoying to run
into no I did stupid
game didn't want
it well
look obviously not going to
try what's the point when extra lives
are not
working extra lives are
broken I got to
sketches
[Music]
uh oh sorry I No it should be might ASO
the text was covered
there no I didn't step to and a for
forward to oh what a waste of a
mask
well anyway because look
amazing the one is so
SM it would fit your theme though to
have
like
expressive and mem like
ones
[Music]
I'll send you the
sketch that would be
nice oh no oh I got it almost missed
that
up say
this this is just me bragging about how
good I am at the
game I mean I took damage once so I
guess there's
that w i s I missed that one okay this
one does not have box above
it this one does
give
it right I do still block the pass oh I
didn't pick it up
[Music]
nice oh nice SP
Spike nice it lasted that this
time this one going is the last one
did none of the change out before oh no
no I I I guess you didn't
listen I said that was before that was
during countdown was before I started
the software that resisters the
redeems and I also said that when you do
redeem them during the countdown the
time timer starts when you like they
have they they are in a que but the
timer but the first outfit change starts
as soon as you redeem
it that would be including during the
countown because the software that runs
the outfit changing I have no idea what
the software what what's going on on the
stream I wish I had such control and it
really should be able to have such
control because it can interface with oh
as the streaming service but H it does
not give such
options speed
running the tricky one will be the
hog
no I did not do the whole first world
I'm
sorry but we only have one one one that
was
Chen so everything gets
refunded well that was still of me
it was the warm up okay I'm going to
confirm it as a win anyway because that
would uh allow me to repick it so I
don't have to write it
again really fun time
was now you can use that points to do
outfit your seems you cut your points
[Music]
p
well I just have to start
over fny
Hy hello P girl come on scrash
move
when
so I really wish twitch had more steps
on the bit redeems because doing like
a p Pony emote would be perfect
for I kind of need that need it I kind
of want it but that would be nice to
have as a bit
reward
but having a like
um
pause could also be
something
wa and this is the confirmation I did
without I technically not this only
means that I didn't my
checkpoint
[Music]
okay
let's do it without mistakes this time I
was so close to the end of the level two
and then I jumped
off
oh
there we
go come
on
oh I stopped it
[Music]
reflexively I could us
that
Let It Be and say that
no yeah another
okay I need to stop failing thank you
for following it never actually nothing
interesting let
them what have I
got that's that's a
nice all I want to land on this is not a
speed
run it keeps doing
that and you have step in the air when
you do that but you cannot move wish I
could just move up onto the platform
unless there's a way to do
that oh I got stuck on
nothing
wa another
try the start time this
level okay I I need to stop messing up
[Music]
so record current
bers it it didn't say crash 1 plus 2+
3 CU I want to do like how far can I get
through all 3D games
but but it looks a bit I might need to
do them three
separately they they do say that the
first game is the
uh hardest of the
three
um
maybe the
um
let's see maybe the second game isn't
that hard if I don't try to 100%
it and there must be the last come
on second time I did
that out of two
times done that 100% of the time
I need to stop doing
that but I guess I have to bragging
about how I
was how about how good that was at the
game I guess that's just Karma at this
point I want to no not open
that what is the funny not 100% in it
though I mean if I 100%
it without
dying
that
that's that's asking team how sh me I'm
not that good I'm
who one must in it again B got the to
kit and he's now punished with that g
like and ice dragon understand
it cut to be too cute and is now
punished with bad game
lck understanding what you're trying to
say
sorry run run
run leaving that behind need
it taking it safe
there we
go
wa you're Sil I am I guess you're
right I see you step round down from
three to two this
time
okay no mistakes this time I know this
[Music]
map
okay
okay so far good so far so
[Music]
good this oh I almost jump too ear day
that part wasn't the tricky one it was
after this
segment
yeah you can hear the go here there we
go
whoa I didn't
it
okay I
[Music]
should open the uh predictions
page allmighty P Pon Master crash so
this far I'm not
didn't I actually don't know what my
record
is since I'm not tracked this
before yeah I'm being C on this
now at least I don't have to go back and
strike with
that
well all I hesitated a bit too much on
that
one I decided to not jump in
land oh L spikes don't mind L
spikes
what and I keep
biting this being
invincible and I think when they are
biting you cannot stand on them being
that you still
die this might be meanful sleep on P Pon
arm sleep on some p on sleep and P and
[Music]
on hi
P yeah P you got you got
first like 25 minutes
ago I appreciate your first
message I miss your
king I'm trying to have a good time
here I hope you're all having a good
time here I pass out yeah he was he was
sleeping you can't skip this sorry no
it's fine it's fine don't be
sorry
ye
yea
hi hey hey up hello R man I'm doing this
no death
challenge
um
apparently
um you don't get to keep the masks after
you do a b b for some reason yeah
because it sets it to one and no sets it
to Max houseal and then you stay as
clean it well that was annoying so I I
didn't I didn't I wasn't careful enough
and so
um no
winners hi how hey you died there or you
don't
say thank thanks thank you for informing
me I wasn't aware that I
died they took all my masks away from me
did you know you died no I didn't thank
you for letting me
know
that's the Fest I got so
F okay now I know to watch out for
that the uh bosses takes your M that
way
oh no I took the
checkpoint also use spelled this wrong
in the
title I spell it P way
okay
[Music]
how did I spell
this no it
say that that that
that and know what just picking up he
says
this forgive me I should have spoken out
the
turn you're
funny I don't get one the TNT explodes
immediately when you step on it with
that mask because other boxes do not
explode immediately when you step on
them but they do have a timer before
they explode
and I think that timer should still
apply to the TNT being like yeah it's
going to
explode after the amount of time it's
not a long time
though oh look at
that okay can not wait what is this one
I took damage from now I don't remember
which it
was this one it was there we
go first time I get past it without
taking
damage be very careful
there I did
it s
s
so many
boxes
so now now red has dropped down to the
first
option but this time is the time I will
do it I'll show you
yeah is
son this time I'm starting with the m in
this
[Music]
area no mask on this one but there's one
on the next
one
I show you I show you that I can do
it I will defeat this first
island almost stepped up that
one oh that was
close
why did I do that
for walked up
and touched
it how Sil of me I am
silly you better so I win the prediction
you better so I win the prediction
[Music]
I will try I will try to defeat beat the
whole game without
dying okay so this level doesn't have
any the M doesn't serve any purpose on
this level
en but in next one it does serve a
purpose so this will be the first
prediction I mean unless I get to the
actually complete the second
island but this this is prediction that
likely will have a
winner
okay
boom hey happy W pon
pon
hello and also great but you missed yeah
kind of missing them
intentionally it's Wednesday my dude for
another 3 hours and
two
minutes
um let's get with it I'm not that picky
about there's something so erotic about
the way crash jums you think so rocket
man I'm learning so much about
you
I
mean if you could imagine pon pon
in in the place of Crash wearing her
dress or sporty outfit doing these jumps
I could see what you
mean
and in
fact that's exactly what ponon will be
doing in Crash four but the jumps are so
quick it's not like you
can yeah I'm me playing looking up aess
if that wasn't obvious but the jumps are
so quick so you're not you're not going
to see
that I'm
sorry
what happens if you reach the go with
the mask stup
mask don't men CR
for I did see a play it but I'm holding
up from looking at it so I can play it
me I played it once
[Music]
but it was quite a while ago and I want
to go in like it's been over a year ago
since I played it
last you mean s boxes hello bun I'm
trying to defeat this game without
dying I'm not 100% in the game without
dying that's that's not going to happen
okay
okaya
this will cause me to lose the mask
thank you for 100 bits what the buny how
many bits do I have now do you have
now uh 700 300 more and the FN is
yours what B sh oh wait yeah the message
is working yeah thank you for testing my
message what one cheed a total of
700 probably should to say should a
total 700 bits but it's
working I'm working on
it okay I did it that that's that one is
scary I'll take this now I got my
protection
back stupid boss caused me to lose my
protection I'll do that it's seems to be
safer
okay
yes that's how you get a
mask and
uh you make your own bot or using a tool
it's a mixed
up so it's kind of self botting as far
as I know that's not against
your there's a lot of people are doing
it I mean it makes sense I mean
obviously it's my own
chat yeah so that way you can see now
see
the total number of bits you ched
because if you're not in the top 10 you
cannot see that and that's going to be
an issue in the
future you say like that what B she had
a total of 700 300 from getting the kute
bunny
I can't tell how many bits I have left
what f is this new interface why I have
to changed the interface I mean it looks
the same for
me at the very top you should be able to
see the the top 10
bit
[Music]
GS here comes the
level the level have been
fearing what do you mean is at the top
it's 10
thousand no it's a great Su I love
hearing what everyone
uses wait
what I
mean h mix it up is uh useful in my
current situation but it's like it is a
good tool but it is also quite
[Music]
limited can you tell I played this game
for too
long like I couldn't even see that one
but what is it that's bad L
say
[Music]
oh next
Spike there we go I didn't die thank you
for deing the star Rocket Man even if it
doesn't mean
anything I was
scared I was quiet and
scared yeah it Chang for me to on thisk
stop
that's interesting the limitations of
mix it up made me move to using streamer
B I could write my own C sharp
[Music]
oh but like it does it have like the
same capabilities as uh mix it up just
just like mix it up can change the
what's active on OBS so so you can use
the redeems to change pon pon outfit
and also Hog Wild is also removing the
mask but there should not be any more
hog levels because the last hog level
because there only
two is locked behind a key and I'm not
going for the key cuz this is come on
lag bike almost killed
me I need a new
computer yes same as mix it up and more
oo yeah because one of the main issues I
have with mix it up and I understand
like the limitation of programming but
it's like you can set something to be
cued or
not
like you can only have a single Q you
can't have multiple cues going on at the
same
time
not exactly the sound it makes but close
enough you don't eat
me I'm careful now
okay
and I'm falling behind on the
messages Boo get the key no this is not
100% run but the UI is less in I can
understand that especially if you're
coding it uh oh yeah I got a new Discord
account can I get the server invite just
write exclamation point
Discord just like a commments that one
gives you the disc link oh yeah I love
that about mixed up I have multiple cues
set
up you love that
about yeah I love it about streaming
but yeah I totally love about how you
can only have a single key and mix it
up yeah I kind of read it as more of
sarcastic
tone I mean what would it
[Music]
be I just love the key
system and I have the same thing same
issue with like twitch you can
set I do want
that you can set up a thing it's your
redeems so they pop up in your redeem
queue or you can set them to not pop up
in the ring Q that's
it I want like the outfits to not show
up in the redeem q but I still want to
be able to refund them but I understand
that's
like not possible
but because that would like have have to
have like prioritized queuing and
regular queuing and things like that two
tiered queuing
see there you go that's the
Discord early brain not enough coffee
yet yeah it's still early for
you it's quite late for
me can I do this because this is last
level then I completed the first
island so I better I better do
this I am being
careful and we go and this part I should
not die on H and
don't because there's nowhere no where
to die but you know my luck even though
it's impossible to die here I will die
anyway
look at me just skipping five lives like
I'm
something I need no stinking
lives
go remember me to do the
prediction oh no now there's no point
for anyone to predict the the first
option our the two first
options
um let's uh let's
not let anyone get easy points here what
has been predicted has been
predicted but you
can alter Channel Point reward change
the name turn on off and change
cost turn on off change the cost it it's
how my Pokemon game changes name to the
active ah I see
ah have
good have a good night J
there we
go I've join the Discord in a minute
also oh that would be
amazing
um I was going to say does this mean
that the last option is the winner
because I did
complete wait no wait I have not
completed the second island
yet that's the current challenge
when I got I cleared the hot part the
first
island the second island will be a
bre
okay this is one of the red
ones because yeah this is red but I'm
not going be confused with the red
one I realized I've saying the red one
that wait isn't that the other one red
see I think they did they change the
color of it in the
[Music]
remake stack of box is blocking the
vi
this one has green leaves and this one
has white
leaves at that and I did
it Wile
Wile I just like how that emot is so
Wily it's it's it's too weakly it's very
weakly
is that the music is
f it's like a gelatin
[Music]
W like
that H
worked
wait where is he jumping now I don't
remember like
that there you
go that went surprisingly
quick you heard of liquid snake no you
get ready for
liquid oh it's like a it's like a water
balloon but wolf
shaped okay I lost all masks but I get
one back
here I should put a
m like I understand like extra lives
like they are higher values than
Ms you but not in this
run
give me something
valuable no this one did not contain the
mask this one contain a stupid
box
okay so far it goes
well
no h was
it
no I did contain
them what a waste of a
mask
oh it's it's this
one
okay I guess I should be thankful that I
had a
most
oops
but I'm naked without the
mask come on attack
me oh oh sorry
sorry were you meant to use this one to
get a life or
something
no is just a generic
obstacle there we
go and then there's this
one almost
in and then this is this TAA
whoop that was
close okay let's
see so that's that
one and that
one oh
naked
crash
well I guess he started off
naked wh before he
turned
Sapient now I'm going to get rid of this
thing I do not trust it
well it touched
me that was
scary
more I really super Rosy
10 thank you for
following
thank thank you everyone for
following
like so many followers at the
moment not was so careful about that I'm
only doing this to not die so I only
care about masks really
so I'm doing a challenge run at the
moment anyone not up to
speed and the goal is for me to
defeat I shouldn't talk I shouldn't talk
about what I'm
doing oh my well fres Di
run
over I completed the first island two
people won congratulations to people
complete first
island die on second
island so people how do you feel
about your
victory I don't feel so good about
losing though
but it it is what it
is thank you everyone for contributing
to the prediction it's very fun very
nice it's been fun it's fun when people
do that
so well I guess I just restart
[Music]
the
here we
go so back to the game oh no
demo help them it's like kind of cutting
out the very very bottom of the screen I
hope that's
fine because sometimes it's shows up the
loading sh Happ
[Music]
sometimes hello
looking at the
picture
oh no I didn't
mean we have to go in there there we
go there we
go now it's
better
now let's
go let's
go so I've been at this for 53 minutes
Benny two winds in one day I'm [ __ ] hot
well it's only been like one proper wind
because I no
wait wait did you win
the what you didn't
what and I didn't have copy
wait when when did you win the first one
I'm confused wasn't this the first first
prediction unless you're talking about
some prediction on some other
channel I think that was the first
prediction I actually got a winner
from the other one was his
refence W invisible
ceiling pon pon heart pyramid yay which
doesn't look a bit weird on on screen
share because you're trying to maximize
the size of
them when I did well until I
didn't oh that's
aome I did well until I
didn't and assume Ro man has ad
so good luck SP Pon with this crazy
[Music]
challenge howy
H how the hell controller J you the
control of
the so I guess I guess ads were playing
when I
died I guess that's Ty difficult so
because because roet man is brightening
I assume he had ads at that
moment because you said you want twice
as far as I know you got a refund and
then one win because when you get the
refund you don't win anything you just
get your money
back I should say points though they are
car
coins
look unless you're talking about the
prediction on another channel channel I
said that yeah refund is a
win well I guess it's not a loss at
least
but like you didn't win any points is
what I
meant there we
go I am controlling the jar is it
controlling am I am I controlling jar is
it controlling me me a
mystery yeah it's a controller jar it's
a jar that has the control I
see but who has the control over the jar
and what the jar is controlling yeah
that is a
mystery
okay I'm going to I'm going but I'm
losing the triple mask
every every boss though
but I'm going to try to hold on to it
for as long as I
can there we
go
this is speed
running okay this time I'm not going to
touch
it it was a silly idea to touch it last
time
p h pyramid pyramid
pyramid ref yes aaba no that's
a what did I say he
said I need to pick up a mask before I
can repeat it it's something I can
never remember what he says but when I
hear it I can repeat
it
okay I should have read the last
comment I'll do it
here it's funny that I catch you live I
random came across a vault of yours and
decid to peek in
here yeah I'm usually don't stream at
this time so it's
actually quite random I decided to
randomly it's because I'm currently in
the I'm trying to move out from here
move sell sell the house and everything
I'm trying to get rid of the waste which
is what's currently is frustrating me
because no compan is taking the
waste and I only wasting my time there
in start that
joke I mean obviously I I have a company
that empties the garbage spin every week
but I can't really put all of my waist
into that
one like they they not going to take
that because I'm only paying for like
certain amount every week and I have
emailed them and asked them like about
I've got the confirmation email that
they received my email but I still
haven't answered yet
since I don't know felt like they would
reply a bit quickly especially since I'm
a pain customer I guess they don't have
my
email but yeah thank you for picking in
here I hope you like it here
um like I like the I
like I like everything that happens
here sometimes I play new games that I
haven't played before or played a long
time
ago and sometimes I'm replaying games
are very familiar with like crash and
doing a
silly uh
challenge like I have done a similar
challenge where the goal was to uh that
I only did that Crush 2 in stream
because doesn't make sense with crash
one where I have to
complete well technically before I can
pick up any collectibles in a level I
cannot have at any point died before
that in that level I can have died but I
have to restart the level if I
do this time I'm trying to defeat cortex
with without dying at
all slightly
different very different so yeah dying
before I can pick up like the Box
gem not dying was the
challenge and then that's already a
requirement for crash one so I was
playing the PS1
version yeah we go see what's going on
on
Discord but we have two
newcomers so
panda and a
man
and thank you for your help with the
markdown by the way oh wait oh yeah the
uh timing thing is
very I understand it's it's a bit messy
sometimes to deal with on Discord but
it's so convenient for all the
users uh reading it afterwards to just
to just look at the time and not only
not only is it converting to your time
and is also converting to your time
format
if you're not from Australia because in
that case you have to choose one or the
other but
I
[Music]
anyway no love for Australia from
Discord anyway um yeah so when when is
is really but I do understand that like
I've started using the pictures for
schedules and it does look much nicer to
like visually much nicer to look
at but I but that would obviously not
allow you to use the
format because it's a picture no I sent
it the wrong way well I mean either I
get a mask or I lose a mask no wait or I
keep the Mask wait how does that
work maybe I do lose the
mask well I guess there three
outcomes I spin the TNT and get nothing
I spin the box and the TNT G gain and
lose a mask or I only spin and gain a
mask and I got the best outcome
so I'm happy with
that
oh yeah yeah I'll get do
the Oster checking and
hydrating when it starts counting the
boxes
H just in
time
so while I could technically jump
through those it does make crash jump
and then okay P
check and
hydrating and swim suting is on it's on
the
way that's a lot of
boxes anyway let's go back to the com
here as
well I'm trying to move out myself soon
first thing I'll do when I get my own
place is is hang up a big old trans flag
on the wall is that why you found me H
you wait no wait that that's not cannot
be how you found me a through
v
wait because I do have the trans uh
transgender transom HS on the video but
those are not saved for V
sadly I was thinking that would would be
the reason why I found my
V maybe I find found this or
another cuz I don't think I have it
anyways like can have it in attacks and
I'm like open about being trans but it's
not like the only thing about me
[Music]
I'm more about being a
bunny a cute
[Music]
bunny and I know I miss the
comment but I was talking so much about
these
comments I get to this next
one
[Music]
there we go
w
h wanted to replay the crash games but
crash 4 need a long break from it on the
understandable
understandable
definitely do take take as long as you
[Music]
need last level and the time for the
prediction is
up well I am also a trans woman furry
who streams but that was on
YouTube well look at
that well I assume so from the onean
thing to put up there trans
flag I mean of course there are those
who stand for Trans rights which is
nice feel like having a big trans flag
almost feels like
more expect the person to be Trans in
that
case
but maybe there are
more fors having the
PLS which is nice to
see yeah bunny I hope you like the
drawing made
by found someone
called Violet
echos and ink bunny Who Made Who cont
ected I'm still confused on who actually
made the
drawing if if my like was just contact
person for the actual artist or if that
was the
artist I never really got that cleared
out cleared
up but anyway I I assume regardless of
what it actually is see with contact
right if you would want
something regardless and yeah good bunny
who understands
Tech and
dies on the last level of the first
Island no one when on ah had three
people predicting the same thing so I
guess you refund
time someone has to predict something
else if if someone just put in a single
point on the first option they would
have won like
11,000
huh
[Music]
oh I'm getting I'm getting hot here
playing oh oh well the V was on YouTube
I mean
oh yeah yeah yeah why is there black
border by
way it's
fine I mean I assume
it's what as it's commonly known trans
people like M people people with I going
to say similar interests it's not
exactly an
interest people of similar
type
like like how many bunny streamers I
found for example
being a bunny myself boom Another win
how is that that's not a win that's a
that's a not a loss that's a refund I
have fa I I
said sorry I I was so close to reaching
that we can trust test your luck again
since you got your point points
back I'm needing to go so I won't see
how this plays out but good luck have
fun I will post the result on the server
so you'll see it
there but thank you for stopping
by I appreciate
it it means a lot to
me
H I understand what you said now you say
second island wait do you say wait so
one
is no Island completed two is first
island completed three is second is
completed oh my you sure I F to
me have not even shown I've been able to
do that yet oh no I'm saying too much
that's good affect the results could
affect people on the the prediction but
I mean I've got
experience and I have completed every
Lon without dying because I have 100% it
SM
one it's just about doing it in a
row having a no dying
streak that is this
challenge
no you're not going to Bight
me
skunk I just keep meeting trans people
without even trying it's to the point
where I may made a friend who is a guy
but I thought he was a
trans
oh that's our
qu
well at least you got
that
so what we got
yeah sometimes I have like a feeling
that someone might be trans but I have
no idea to no way to go
me hey I fell
down
we not in this
hole let's
go need that mind because I don't want
to do any
bonus almost stepping too way too far
forward
[Music]
there we
[Music]
go it is possible that
um I could I could imagine because one
of the reason why I wanted to be like
a bunny
streamer it's because I can be the
uh
like a
female female on screen if that makes
sense since any of my transitioning has
not started yet in real life but I'll
I'll get
there I've already practice my voice so
far but I do need more
practice
but I do appreciate when people say like
um like I couldn't tell that you are you
are trans from your
voice and I think so the best best one
was someone said like I had a suspicion
that you were trans based on like your
behavior and things like that things you
said and stuff but then when I heard
your
voice I did not believe your TR at that
point
and it's nice to know that some people
find my voice very
cusing I feel like I had woken up with
for and I need sometimes I
just it just found it funny well it's
it's
good it's it's good
when when people don't
take take it a bad as a bad
thing yeah I
wouldn't like if if someone were to
think like I guess the equivalent here
would be if someone believe that I was a
CIS man H it would confuse me but if a
person just made
like the
mistake an honest mistake and got the
wrong idea that's
fine because the the importance is the
intent after
on what we
got
[Music]
n
and uh that's why I also created the uh
ASA trans
question to let people like show to
people that I'm you actually don't have
to redeem it if you want to ask a
question it's just that if you feel
better doing the redeem it's available
there not matters because I'm going to
lose everything at the end
anyway pun pun speed running the
game I met him on a s full of trans
women that's I see the
confusion CU he's pretty feminine and
gay and that make it more Hest stand but
yeah permanent I guess the word
is yeah I I can see
the
confusion I can w w I just jumped on it
just barely jumped on it I could also
see such
a server
being a nice
place
yeah currently I'm only on streamer well
not fully but almost only on other
streamers service nothing
on
any other type of
server I'm also on the Ser for mix it up
cuz I asked a few questions regarding
how suit set things
up I'm also on the server
for yeah
igdb the gaming database is for
which or
categories
W I think good luck with getting a sh
yes I'm on it for three months now o how
much have changed for your 3
months cuz I'm I'm excited I still have
to wait a long time still it's not a
quick process oh one year and over 100
days
[Music]
left well so kind of like one and a half
year
left before anything of that
starts
well at least it's covered by Healthcare
so I don't have to basically pay
[Music]
for I wouldn't be able to afford it if I
were to pay for
it
so this level is a bit tricky because
it's moving
forward
automatically so it's easy to run into
something not too much for me but you
can but
you yeah already can see the boobs
poking at it o that
quick because that's that's one of the
things I've been like point that I've
been talking about I can feel them when
I go down the stairs to because yeah
that's that's one of the things I've
commented on
that um I'm basically
flat but there only 3 months to see
something that's that's kind of EXC
exciting feel a bit weird talking about
it but it's all about being a trans
woman one one of the reasons why
I want that is because it gives me a
more feminine
look I mean obviously I can break it but
I mean actually having the real deal is
nice say
no I touched it butt or
something I didn't pay attention which
part
tou
well get out of
here come on move
come on
move go this isn't great lost all my
masks cuz the hog stole
them and I lost the one I had on this
level I need to kill him
again get out of
here okay I should move over to
the okay there's the monkey there okay
it's
moving there we
go not doing that mistake
again I also started getting wa more
easily oops uh
that's but is it like
because my current H fat
build builds up in my
tummy
where obviously yeah but I've heard
that wait where I say I'm trying I'm
trying to get up get my thoughts to
together her
and so yeah that's what this up and I've
heard that with the S justen will make
it instead build up in one boobs and
hips T but I don't exactly remember what
was if you if
you there we go the timing of that
wasn't come
on at least I got one mask now
but oh
break oh yeah yes realize what the
monsters I forgot that I was supposed to
listen to that
thisa I I
think
W yeah I've tried to keep track of my
weight because I've been not satisfied
about gaining weight but that's only
because it's building up on my tummy and
I don't want it to be there want it to
build up in
my oh yeah it's reset back here well
since I'm complet
it h oh will stop the Gathering of
new new
prediction
ntic can I go and get some fill up my
drink before I start this
level
I just run the ads in the meantime just
to get rid of them so they don't play
later when I'm back to the
game I hope everyone
understands
yeah be back in a
Beat
[Music]
a
[Music]
I'm back 1 and 1 half minutes to
ready so I would check what's going on
on the server
in let's
see
that's not that's that's the wrong
button
yes wait oh is it because he has not
verified
yet
yeah
[Music]
I
um okay just a
moment on that
one um
there you go mix that on the
[Music]
survey
so answer over gu I'm going back to game
and thank you for following controller
jar and so and let's see my feelings
also changed in the sense that I can't
hide from them Too Much Anymore yeah
I've
[Music]
had
um
sorry I heard something saying that the
had
[Music]
TR
okay back to back to the game
I yeah so for some reason someone
couldn't send
messages it's it's something I've had
happen to
me when I went into into stream
once I could write messages they showed
up in my chat
but they did not show up on
screen and if I refresh the stream the
my message was gone but I could send
messages in other
streams I don't think all other streams
like some it worked some it didn't it
was very
random but and then then everything was
fine the next day
very
weird no come
on no don't want to do that
again I'm here to win I will win this
challenge
oh controller
J um
wait only makes sense that I
follow yeah I appreciate that you do
follow no no pressure up with me
around might come by to ra you sometime
if PR to do so um but this is not my
regular stream time
though but we'll see what my future
stream would be because because I would
probably I would most likely changeed
around my schedule
completely well see we'll
see and I guess I'll have
to many people show up
hey there hello
fman
firman1 I wait before we had rocket
man1 if
you're maybe even on mobile you might be
able to see the past messages where
where there is a Rocket Man one well see
what the good T time will
decide yeah as soon as I get this thing
here sorted out for me
we'll see how it
goes okay let's
see should they Wai
[Music]
longer here we
go
no wait that was too
early I had this last
time
okay there we
go
it's not as quick as the first time
but okay yeah this level I did
complete I we lose all
mask because that's how the game
works that's how R the game
is let's see if I can do this
I need to gain back my
mask how The Bu doing today I'm doing
this stream because I wasn't feeling all
right I just want
to get
back not feeling right as in so much I'm
having so much
trouble
I want to
see H when would you normally stream
since
when since we're in the same time
since seem
okay
yeah let's see let's see if I can't
remember because it was a while ago no
it wasn't too long ago though
but I usually start 14 and 16 um so
whoop Monday Tuesday I play I usually
play one Ty game at 14 starting 14 and
then THS Thursday and Friday and play
another
game rting 16 is so very on Star times
and usually go for 3
hours and today I started 18 so this
would
be
like one one 140 so
far
wh well and and I did like 10 10 minute
a 10 minute count I could do a shorter
countdown I don't know how long
countdown to
be than go almost made a mistake
there that's not too
bad but since uh after I
move things would change
like
I hopefully
because getting help getting a job
and then that will affect when I'm
available so we will
see okay I will bounce on
you there we
go
this next useless extra
lives and then there's this
thing I would prefer getting rid
of and this one as
well close to the day
here we
go well in that well
hopefully but so
currently due to me trying to move the
I'm not streaming on schedule as I said
I'm kind of repeating myself
in and here was when I jumped off last
time
hopefully I get it sorted
out it's not
like I really don't know how quickly I
will be get how quickly I can get the
house
because because there's
like there's like a I I have like a
farmer who wants to buy the land I did
that again I did that again
again but
um no sorry I won't complete the first I
did that this is a fire camp this is the
curse I completely
first but uh but but yeah the farmer
only wants to buy a portion of the land
not
[Music]
everything yeah is it going
to why is
it
there we
go so there's no guarantee that the
forer actually is willing to find the
house but I'm try I'll see if I can do
some negotiating
and
like the only way the farmer gets the
land is by buying everything house
included
but
yeah he just a funny Lisa it's fine Lisa
are fine yeah what would happen if I
poop this S I do that's an interesting
idea I do want I do want redeems for
petting but I guess I could have a
redeem for poing this n as well okay I
just have to
restart almost died
immediately when that I mean funny to
see why did I do the same mistake
twice
same mistake
twice I will not do the mistake
this I will do the mistake again right I
will my spe prediction will I do the
same mistake again sadly I cannot have
two Poli running at the same
time definitely seeing that jimy in
there
I can carrot This n That sounds weird
but I have car point I
[Music]
can I can take my carrot and
poke
[Music]
oh yeah num n
[Music]
n num n
n
so I have a version of the cursor with
uh chew off after pon pon took a bite of
it when
this part is
easy done it so many times
now yeah doing the game without dying
might might be a
challenge I this play one without dying
as I mentioned
before the V is on my
well it's on I do have the primary
Channel and the V
channel the SP stream is on my main
Channel because I did that before I
started
streaming but doing like a Let's
Play
and that style not streaming
was not my thing too much to deal
with I need a bunch of editing in
that that let's play to speed things up
like I cut out all the
[Music]
loading but because the loading is what
shows how how many gems do you have in
Spyro I did on
overlay so you could
see come on
go if you want to see my editing skills
you can go and watch
it but my speed speaking in that video
is terrible because it was like before I
got experience
speaking that's what I sound like
when at the very start of my streaming
[Music]
career
what rushing through the level
really
now oh well we only had one option
predicted when that happens I
refund
wait sorry that did not can't let me
there was 15 minutes not
30 well that was of me eating the carrot
is like having the masking she started
sparkling you tried to pick up the
controller but with just a single touch
it FS up
screen yeah that's that's what happened
my controller flew away so I can no
longer control the game that's why I
failed
well that was
embarrassing yeah I think
I on too hard of a challenge
here B I'm not say to give up here
yet I mean as long as people enjoy
watching
me attempt this challenge I'm I mean I
could switch over like crash three if I
keep fing at
this because I'm more experienced with
crash 3 and and it is a easier game so
I've
heard
so
super don't just
like
what when I I I said it I think it's
like
fora but um I don't think that's what it
[Music]
says I have
Bor send send just OT for a full full
size
emote that was not a suggestion that was
a
demand
what he clear says hoop
poop well apparently it's not clear
enough for me to
he
what no that was close close to the
edge and then he said something when he
when M drops down a
level and I have no idea what that
is there might be some words in some
language
but or it might me
nonsense hey got to go actually bye for
now thank you for being here and thank
you for following and thank you for the
talking about about
um the the all all the stuff we talked
about it's very nice have
a nice night good luck with the
challenge
this I'll try my best I think this St is
a bit too tricky for
me
and
hello hey
hello uh how to finish crash banico
because nobody helped me even my
brothers don't know how and I am stuck
in Rolling Stone
LEL
wait he well to just finish the game you
just have to reach the end of the
level do just like defeat
cortex H I'm not
exactly oops did I do this
again
and I've seen someone play like that
level who had bit trouble in it and what
I could determine from that was that
they were too much in a hurry and
uh well jumped like into the those
Wheels
oh thank you for
following but any exact uh tips or
tricks or something it's hard to
give H honestly actually see some game
play if that makes
sense but if it's about where things are
and how to unlock stuff or unlock stuff
I actually don't know how to say that
and that I can help
with
like these things
here that disappear when you approach
them and they are
tiny how to make those
work those that's kind of stuff I can
have but hello
again thank you for stopping by
now we should
say was I was going to say good morning
because that's what I say in the morning
I guess good
evening in
Swedish
um
[Music]
you don't have to how is it you I asking
how I am or what the words
are you give me v i
gu I I assume that means how I am
but I'm trying to feel better
after restraining today with with stuff
so just relax and playing games games
I'm familiar with doing a challenge
that's too hard for me to
do like challenge myself so whoops
almost jumped off the level there hey
start hovering straight off the ground
it crashed through
the oh
my just flying away like that I guess
that's one way to
leave when did this become in the CH
Jones well clearly since the fourth
level what the words are and how ask you
well I guess I answered one of
those taking the shortcut asking
technically what could spe a biggest
question yeah yeah that's
very clever
well I guess for good morning that would
be good
Moran which of course is related to
English oh but is probably easiest yes
you you can use Google Translate and
right like good morning it should give
you your correct
answer I I understand it's not a
reliable tool for everything but
something as good morning it should be
able to
handle
really really I did that I did that oh
I'm I'm starting get tired maybe maybe
this isn't you know
what no one no one even wanted to put
anything into the prediction you know
what this idea of doing one two and
three without this Let's ignore
that I have a better
idea actually don't have a better
idea
um let's just switch
game let's do CR stream without dying
rash
tree rash
bicute three
warped is that the name or is he just
crash band C
warped three in the
logo anyway anyway I can write here good
more B Sony Computer Entertainment
Europe
presents would be I guess what you would
use
now Universal inter good evening no it's
just crash B good warp in the in the in
the license and devel not in the
copyright
stuff let's get
[Music]
this there's a three
there says crash bicot wait wait it's
it's three crash bico War there we go
stop
let's play in
Italian let's play it in Swedish there's
no Swedish I don't think there's a
Swedish translation of any of the crash
games we don't need an intro we know
this game right H did I miss a message h
no I don't think so good good
good and Swedish has these three
additional
letters uh actually
Swedish has these
vowels where why is a vowel is always a
vowel never not anyway let's
go no that no need to save anything
let's do levels in
order should I do a prediction for this
game let's set up a prediction for this
game crash crash crash why must you
always muck in my mud uh oh look I have
a mask helping me too we will find out
which one is more powerful soon
enough okay let's let's
like let's okay let's be
uh
uh
uh
so I guess I have I have to write like
this I
guess and then we
have and that one and that's
these
there we go that's that's what we going
with now we can put in the
prediction anyway H yes there we
go why did you skip the cutcenes oh you
want to see the cut scenes you want to
see the cut scenes I mean I mean I can
go back and play the cousin if you want
to oh why are you playing this to me I
skip this well while you while you put
in points towards the prediction let's
let's just's quickly watch the question
because someone commented on that and
only because of that it's only
your lady cut no problem no problem yes
I want to see the C in yes let's let's
watch
them you got to you got to people can do
the prediction in the
meantime no that's what happened yeah I
know this can I cortex without
dying as soon as I Die the game is
over I'll be
quiet free at
last
ukah ukah is free no it cannot be evil
great evil has
come none have yet to fail to breing
hookah hooka even once but you cortex
you have failed me twice great Ooka it
was that infernal Bandicoot from deep
inside my temple prison I sent you
simple instructions to follow but you
lost the gems you lost the crystals and
I have lost my patience there is now no
other power source left on this planet I
know we've had a few
unfortunate setbacks and failed but
since your bumbling has managed to set
me free I am feeling generous there is
still a way for us to amass the power
needing to enslave this miserable planet
and this time this time the great ukaa
we'll make sure that you do it right
after many eons my evil twin ukah ukah
has been freed from his underground
prison long ago I locked him there to
protect the world from his malice now
free once again he must be
sto children ukauka and cortex plan to
use this time twisting machine to gather
crystals that lay scattered across time
I have brought you here to recover the
crystals before they do so to open the
time portal simply stand on a button and
then jump into the portal Good
Luck Good Luck yes thank you for the
luck I will have the goodest of
luck so you got plenty of time to be put
in your points we need at least one
other person to put in points otherwise
they won't be any
predicting as as I I go with the rule
that if
um there's no winner we listen to him
this time if there's if there's no
winner the points will be refunded
because I don't want your points
disappearing if that makes
sense so either someone get points
or the points are is
[Music]
returned what a peaceful
l
[Music]
apparently get stuck there I'm picking
up
[Music]
rties I me making noise
now glitch 100% R complete wait is there
like a
glitch wait yeah I think there is a
in the
uh I don't remember I do need to Piat
this
[Music]
up in the uh some one some version where
you
[Applause]
can one
box where you can increase the
multiplier in on the uh because when you
jump on multiple enemies in a row you
get more and more whoa fruit and and
after a
point they start giving you lives but
they this point this thing can start
increasing so you start getting crystals
and then you can get like you can get
the 25 crystals you can get even more
crystals I think it stops at like what
stop like 64 crystals or
something
then you can get that very L
down and then you kind of have to just
defeat bosses or
something I've never done that so I
don't actually
[Applause]
know what would happen would be an
interesting thing to try out out
whichever version of the game it
is boom boom boom explode
everything get out of my
way this feel so assed in of the 4 by
4x3
wh speed rning go you go
through there I'm never been good at
that and I'm I not going to go oh my
mask
my beautiful
mask beautiful coral murdering
[Music]
everything oh
mask take
that okay I destroyed a few boxes in
this
level but yeah interesting IDE about me
failing to
entropy where someone believes that I
will succeed entropy but
fail someone sometime before
engine C
time
wh nice
Bight have to avoid boxes that would be
an though complete the game
without destroying a single
[Music]
box like
this
no okay don't do it
I shouldn't have
[Music]
tried it was silly of
me
wa
Crystal
it's so much easier or to scroller
thingy than
[Music]
the the hog I always get keep the
mask cuz the mask is actually working in
this
level cuz the mask will kill the I don't
I see the L of a
mask I'll get it back in the next level
oh no it's the next
level have everyone put in their points
at least when I get before I start the
boss battle I should close the
[Music]
prediction so anyone who wants to take
part in this prediction
should should put in the
points
UG and cortex want tiny get crystals and
bring them to Big Coliseum in Rome crash
leave them for tiny or gred
crush tiny on
crystals no
problem I'll come with okay let's see
no can
box every box is a
te TNT yeah that's an
idea
you cannot spin the single one oh I take
that definitely less less amount of M in
this game compared
to the other
game
yeah and I guess it counts
as lot of
knes
so for example if
I lose
uh bonus that's not a loss of life but I
will lose my masks which I don't want to
lose
and oh the dinosaur can't drink it that
too he it's kind of
[Music]
interesting last level before the
boss hurry up with your predictions it's
the last
reminder go go
go
[Music]
now because you can't have a triple mask
on this level
any mask boxes has been
despawned I don't even have to look for
him
[Music]
just cruising
alone
[Music]
game is a bit quick when you don't try
have
to
who I did it first five LEL is done and
let's see if I can defeat the
boss
so that was that h i will close the
predictions now if no one wants to put
anything
else I'll give
you short moments when I have
to check I can my moment has
it
[Applause]
that okay no
way does this one come up all the time I
don't
want don't want you to show
up
stupid
thing anyway back
to back to the
game yes
so one more
prediction back to the
game that's
Sam
the cut
SC come
on okay so this yeah everyone believes
that I can do this
place fa
enough I we can cheese chees it but
what's the fun in
that
no I fell he fell off the
arena didn't fall off it Landing in the
air
wa give you stupid
[Applause]
BCE
well I appreciate that people believe
that I would be able to do first five
levels plus
plus
complete wing
wing second
world well since the pr is all
about H defeating the bosses so complete
complete
worlds it doesn't really matter which
what I do the levels
[Music]
in okay expanding number of options
like I can defeat the
well I can reach the the boss but not
defeat the
boss fail to the boss and defeat the
boss is two separate options that's what
I'm trying to say and that has to be
specifically fail to the
[Music]
boss no
oh
[Music]
bye-bye I want
[Music]
name
huh okay
so double
[Applause]
mask sing No triple mask cuz I managed
to leave
[Music]
it so going to turn around
there oh there's the
crystal beautiful
[Music]
Crystal
no okay now I'm
losing the all the
mask well lost the all the masks on the
level take damage so many
times
h g
[Music]
w
well yeah because I was going to say
like falling into a hole in the
motorcycle race is not
dying
and also I should not use bazooka by the
way yes like in my previous challenge no
one has predicted me to
succeed even play with
bazooka
so so fair enough
but you know just increase the
difficulty cuz it's not difficult enough
right
2 L is already per Island in Crash one
mean I assume it's a different
amount depending on island
[Applause]
but
[Music]
no nice
bik okay I will go around this
one did with the sword
here
[Music]
goodbye
[Music]
goodbye and there we go end of the
level going good so
far ta but no masks not a single mask in
that that level that's kind
of Stingy of the
him go oh not the turbo Turbo St I can
do
this oh there's the tur
turbo go go
crash wow
nice
oh
wa I'm going a bit outside the track
there
well I hope the police don't mind
well like [ __ ] again come on come on let
me
win I
win that's close than I winning
though okay oh yeah boom
time
P
time to TI anyway back to back to the
game I still don't have a
mask give me some mask k
why you got to be so Stang here with the
masks I need
him
than
goodbye wao okay oh there's a mask
finally I mean okay one level wouldn't
have one because no it was take
level but it took one whole level and a
part of this level to finally find a
mask no MK
St wo that was
close that was scary
no
don't bouncing up checkpoint to
die wouldn't that be
silly see there meant to help me was
about to destroy
[Music]
me
doing a round where you don't destroy a
single box could be quite difficult
obviously it wouldn't
count like boxes that are destroyed by
like the things changing you when
count of course
I guess everyone left the
stream I mean half the
people well have a good day good time
everyone people weren't here for people
didn't come CR three came from CR
one
they didn't see me to they didn't come
to see me give up on the crash
one that guy is just running across the
hole I'm sorry the challenge was too
difficult for
me I'm not as amazing as I saw it
can't
SL oh what that touched the Tain and it
counted and it took such a long time
getting that mask
even ow
owas I mean I could go back and like get
those Mas but I don't know that just
doesn't feel
right I have to do one level at a time
and only
[Music]
once
it's technically not part of the
but don't shoot
me
W
oh
can why is this thing completely
solid
finally
he doesn't seem to be too intelligent
with he's shooting like why isn't he
shooting where I
am I know this like a technique
to I you jump like
that
but wa that was
close
ah he's a thing no he's nothing you
trashed me mate yeah I did no worries
but you'll soon be up against much
worse if you say so it
might yeah like entropy
so I did I did the first part of the
prediction I defeated thing
time and
now dite Exclamation
point Exclamation
mark
okay just be
careful and need to remember to have
this jump
here
oh another
eight yeah I've already proven that the
game is like designed around not having
powerups and then add power afterwards
and then add some boxes so the only
thing you need PowerUp for is reaching
certain boxes you can complete the game
without powerups which honestly makes
the game more interesting to
play Hello KB XD game master oh I almost
died there three no Miss let's
go almost walked into that
one
yes no
mistakes almost made a
mistake
just go who who who whoa no don't touch
me yeah that was scary was scary but
welcome KX the game
master
KX nice yeah I
was that was level
11 time for deep travel deep trouble
is a bit
trouble when you try to do it like uh
get the red
gem I guess it keeps me some
troubling
okay let's
be careful
here yeah here we
go go there's that
g shooting fist FIS
fish with underwater bullets whatever
those are called
Torpedoes
okay I've done every level on
p as I've said before I I've done every
level on PS1 without dying it's
just doing every uh including 100% in
game without dying when only dying
counts per level and
not but now I just have to do
it in a
[Music]
streak
okay see
there thing
here then there's this
thing then comes a bit of a tricky part
here but I yeah there's this
part and then I get this one that does
make it much
easier
see have to be
careful there we go
[Music]
who
success noise
[Music]
again oh no hi
hi is there mask in this one I think
there
is cuz they sure don't want to give me
masks
quit scared
eh cuz it's not a speed run it's just do
it without dying
run ch
fine so
far I think no
wait oh yeah now I know
it I think if you like slide spin that
thing
you can get rid of
[Music]
everything come on give it don't go past
it without giving it oh look I got here
without
dying I do want to do the normal
route
don't want to accidentally land on that
thing that would be very come
on it locked
me definitely not the speed
run
[Music]
okay cool there you
[Music]
go f with
[Music]
you cu don't have any master I'm a bit
scared oh there W no mask on
them I'm almost doing a
no
like no
damage no damage r as
well that's like not exactly what was
going for
but that is what it's turning
into
anyway where was I sorry I got
distracted typical
me so Road
crash at least I can't die on this
one unless like you lose a life for fing
or something for f to
win the lead it takes the crystal the
other
races catch up which crash and beats him
up
I bit brutal I guess well that was
uh almost
uh power
outage the electricity in this building
is not stable that's allting
I getting rid of when I go back moving
back to
stockh get out
way
of
course could never done that's not a
this though at least at least that's
just an optical I mean I wish I didn't
do that
obviously because it makes it harder to
win
but
no I mean I guess it's slightly
beneficial because of
the
actually don't know what's
beneficial am I going to pain
this I am going to pain
this this for some reason this one is
tricky
why do I fail this
one I mean clearly crash is fleing he
didn't get Crystal he just fleeing I
mean I'm not losing a life I'm not I'm
not losing a life for falling into the
pits I'm not losing life for failing to
get Crystal so at least I cannot fail
these so there's
that
it's going fail out this the quick start
there the Speedy start quick start
is Turbo
start can have
way
yeah I'm bounced in the
car got squeezed by the
car I got the car on top of
me
is that obvious
comment I wish I got
[Music]
one okay there's the last two cars
the last two cars I will I will catch up
to
them oh unless they well come on come on
now has three cors ahead of me that was
nice that was
it was that good for
car yeah this this challenge is the
tricky
One S this better than
for hope pleas comment no i' rather be
on top of you there we
go hello T sry yeah I did not expect
that
coming oh
[Music]
my oh oh
my yeah that's that's that's maximum
much
there we go
bom well you see inside obl
obligatory FL
spech maybe you want the pon pon fashy
in that case you can be on top of
P
you can lay her down in your bed and you
can get on top of
her and use her as a
mattress
the one I do wish about to
CL well it has to be mass produced to be
cheap but I also want it to be like
sturdy and there are some pretty sturdy
fies out there
so just about funny right right
company
got to make fun from of popular
[Music]
brand I want some royalties for soul but
I don't need much that finally like I
win this isn't even part of the
challenge I say that every challenge
when when I play this game
this this thing isn't even part of the
challenge why do I have to be so
bad double header please have some masks
in
these I just want my
mask
mask I'm calling a kitten
okay I
play any means now I we just posting the
message in
[Music]
advance I do know stre minutes of ads is
a lot of
ads there we
go now I can't speak those
[Music]
people
but like
[Music]
um that was
[Music]
close but there actually how much ads
per minute do you get on minute per hour
how much ads per hour do you get on
YouTube it really depends on what kind
of videos you're
watching
more more specifically how long the
videos
are because if you're watching an hour
long
[Music]
video more specifically if we watch a
video that is 2 hours
long because there are such videos and
like 3 hours long and they don't have
anyy draw
ads in that case you can get like an
hour without ads on YouTube but should
we count
[Music]
it h did I make you PL not to see
someone else to
talk I
[Music]
mean I mean
um I guess I'm
[Applause]
submissive
I didn't expect anyone to
talk because everyone wants to be tough
by there we go not zero
boxes because it wasn't a single Mas in
level
[Music]
iny
time now it's the now it's the big
Bell someone said that this spell could
be junky I don't ex exactly remember was
something
about hit boxes or something being
weird
b b
Bop one done one
done
no not this one this is the strest
[Music]
one
and I do appreciate they have different
colors in the
make because determining height of those
is very
tricky if this game a bit quicker that
would actually be a
challenge whoop you might F down my time
is
[Music]
up this time didn't
dance
but but thank you taser for offering to
be
topped
or no wait we're offering
to sorry I messed up I messed up my uh
ignore that you completely messed it
up any here
nope no no now I'm blushing for messing
up
my what I wanted to say why these light
spikes
mon ah secret mask I wonder if I've
skipped any secret masks
no I don't think they a place like that
often don't think
so is the invitation
accepted this thing does not move into
the wall they squished into the one
they're squished to to onto the
one
well I
mean dealing with
like guess you're not the only
one feels like this one
is moving slower in this than in
remake
anyway going to wait for this not going
to take the
risk no MKS there no mosks there no
mosks there moving
[Music]
on to made out those
explosions he looks at
[Music]
me yeah I was wonder when the door was I
saw
it give me than you did I see
no I thought I sound like a mosque or
something I'm seeing what I want to see
there are no MOS
here what would it be in mon
[Music]
there why would the game give me a
mask we I've been going on for
it okay wait this one I could die I
think because when you get shot down you
actually get loser
life I made
it so much one I shouldn't do
this like first time I'm playing this
level where the focus is not the uh
[Music]
when I just do
[Music]
the I like
69 here I need some
house
can miss this
[Music]
one
it I guess that one is the easier
one this the the other one cuz this one
has seven blimps the other one has five
and buy engine
planes I don't know what it's called but
I have to shoot down two of the ah back
Coco back to
back which would be weird because
there's only one
coca but yeah
I I am have a very
like okay this time I need to pay
attention
to
m i I am however interested in like
uh Pon Meetup
[Music]
I had no idea how that would work
[Music]
out why is the engine of this thing so
loud
Brandy had a music oh yeah yeah because
the
uh music for some reason is so loud low
in
this we can music yeah I don't know why
but Music Volume sets so low in this
game hope the game is music too
loud does it
change the volume of the music at some
point during the game cuz I think the
music was perfectly loud before
but then I do like this level or
previous level or some boss stand and
then
just lowers the volume the volume lowers
like every level in play or
something no KOC is
[Music]
dead I saw it coming and I just run into
it I got my hair R twist oh do you have
like braided hair sleep on P I
failed I defeated tropy entropy but I
did not defeat engine Coco
died C was unable to retrieve the
crystal back to crash even though crash
could technically continue his Adventure
he is missing a crystal and his sister
so I mean he's probably not feeling all
right all right about
that was going sick yes defeat third
boss
tropy yeah that was sad I CL so
far and lost it all
oh how sad isn't that
sad very
sad I have dreads oh oh yeah not not
brains dreads I see I see that's that
explains why you said
there retwist and not like re braided or
something that makes sense now now yeah
this is so far I got died on level 18 I
don't think that's too
bad but since I
basically barely anyone is left watching
I mean not that that matters and I'm
getting tired and uh maybe maybe it's a
good time to
end
I gave I gave both crash one and crash
three gave crash one many
attempts in CR three I three I
gave one attempt but I still came to
level 18 and failed
there pretty good I
think
[Music]
oh what do you want
more you want me to restart the whole
game from the
beginning
but don't take
time and I've been streaming for 3 hours
already I do think like I mean this is
my normal stream length so I think I
always want you know you know what taser
later
taser LT
um you are always free to write me a
message on Discord or
[Music]
something if you want
some one fun
time so trying to find more I'm looking
for how
about I have okay anyone is Frey just
write me a message if you feel like if
you just want to chat with I mean so far
I'm not overwhelmed with messages at
least I'm not one of those
like several thousand people watching at
the same time and I don't send those
people not having
there direct messages is open cuz they
would they will constantly get messages
but yeah as you can see in the schedule
I have nothing planned every stream so
far is most
spontaneous
[Music]
so so
[Music]
nothing
yeah
[Music]
I guess we I guess we
sleep yeah yeah we go and what visit
someone else who should we visit should
we go and visit hold some
[Music]
egg because egg has been a common
chatter Among
Us and he's wholesome and he's an
EG
what's not great about
[Music]
that we got four watches we make a make
a little
r if you are a subscriber which I'm not
sure anyone you can use this one if
you're not a
subscriber then you have donated 1,000
BS you can use this one if you're
[Music]
either you can use this one I
guess I think I think like
um yes one 100 points and you can choose
any of the tier one sub
uh uh emotes and pay for that and then
you have access to it for the 4 hours
and then you can post it anywhere you
want on
Twitch uh as if you were a subscriber
but only for that single emot bad it
does not work for follow
emote
whichever you have access
to if you like
yeah and you have to be
[Music]
uh subscribed or paying the those points
to get access to
those otherwise it's not going to work
something we just 100 points you get 250
by raing so you
get gain 150 I that is
let's see what
choice all you
[Music]
people have a good
[Music]
time
