foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
that's nice
and I'm getting back to the artifact
and it's some Spanish here you know
gracias
it too
is Todo
[Music]
you can see that as a question
[Music]
foreign
expanded the music
oh now it's I don't remember how many
songs this was last time but now it's 68
tracks three hours of music
[Music]
maybe I only need a little bit once
that would be six hours
[Music]
nice music yeah I should be like
I haven't listened to all of these uh
[Music]
if there's something terrible
um a kid should move it from the list I
should probably plug in the drawing
tablet before it works
[Music]
[Music]
or she
is free tea
that are
or not that's it
[Music]
that's all up to you
[Music]
where should I begin
but
very important Espanol
well I don't speak Spanish I don't
[Music]
however I did get a new reference as I
mentioned
last time
I'm gonna have when it shows up on
stream but
all right
I have probably hard to see the jpeg
artifacts
[Music]
they probably said yeah I can probably
see that it's hard it's hard to see the
jpeg artifacts on the um
[Music]
because the stream is compressed as well
however
I did get
a new reference I can use
apparently I did not save it that she
left me
[Music]
so let me do that
[Music]
there you go
[Music]
and with a new reference
[Music]
then instead of doing that which I don't
want it today it is something to do it
oh yeah I was supposed to try it
here
we go
[Music]
now
probably yeah I mean you should be able
to see this
this is so much
sharper cleaner than that previous
picture
you really want to compare apps it's not
even the same education
[Music]
hello
salsa
and she they have the pictures are
different size
[Music]
um
look at this qualitative
[Music]
anyway
[Music]
like this is it will be easy to watch it
[Music]
nice quiet yeah it's it's nice that
means that I can't because I
[Music]
should have started
[Music]
because someone did suggest that I
should
I should should I do another
[Music]
like
one not like
finished
house
are you doing today I
I mean it's Quran
[Music]
La Mesa
foreign
[Music]
more when I try to do a more accurate
outline
before I do the final outline something
in there
do you want it to be good afternoon
[Music]
I mean I don't know what I'm thinking
foreign
[Music]
with your Spanish
[Music]
and everyone is pretty
I guess
whatever I I don't speak Spanish no
worries about that
these are the most worried that
although
kind of missing one I wonder if that's
not spelled
it's not going to be accurate
artists
I think so
oh
[Music]
well
okay I'm happy you think so
I didn't think I'm
okay
foreign
yes you did
you are a great artist
per
Aya is
you are a great pumpkin
thank you kitten
you are great too
and nice and kind
and cute
okay I don't know how to like
do here not that these lines are
supposed to be super accurate
should I put
yeah this is not going to be final
outline I should probably put it
he has closer to the body
foreign
[Music]
I don't know
much
yeah
I I I I
[Music]
miss it no way how does it look behind
here
who knows
and probably probably this heat packet
foreign
[Music]
let me do that
also and I said the image was slightly
smaller it's actually not slight smaller
because
the image
at this image
the level called image I scaled up 200
so
[Music]
thank you
I just remembered
is not important I don't need to be a
kid
[Music]
that's mirror the whole thing I just
wanted to mirror this thing
thank you
a bad idea what they had looks like
[Music]
your Spanish is great thank you you're
welcome most of you eat stuff a bit of
off the street
I need some loose Spanish on the ground
[Music]
you know I've seen no signs here are in
English and Spanish so I just learned it
from Reading both languages
[Music]
very good I'm still practicing my switch
going on nine days or oh nine days
camping with Lacey with my
language learning
but I try to get back on track
with that
person wants defend

switch it out for
[Music]
and in there which do you want this
okay this is cute
[Music]
that's nice yeah
thank you you're welcome
I'm happy to share my underwear for you
but
[Music]
thank you
something like that
no it's something like that it is
oh my
[Music]
God
it should be even
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
and then it goes like this
[Music]
no there's a cute character but
but so many squares
[Music]
mistake
quite the time to do like
different poses
[Music]
but the same ways
I mean design wise
and ink
which is great of course
fun fun is quite
simple in comparison
[Music]
and you like simple myself
but
this lasts to
I'll be right back how I have to make a
phone call to my father I will be back
really making sure that you will prepare
yes
thank you
[Music]
so
I guess everyone is leaving
that's right
[Music]
[Music]
more people I mean
last drawing there was some so many
persons
going up
specifically Mickey
which was nice
[Music]
you need faces around here
which is saying new usernames
more like 17 actually just checked
seventeen
[Music]
one
[Music]
17 minutes
wait yeah since the stream started yeah
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
but
I'm back my father didn't ask the film
oh no
fully just busy maybe call you back
not 70 minutes on the oven timer which
is what I'll have to leave 20. I was
frozen Oh you mean how many minutes left
okay
thank you
I understand
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
there
so that means I got to drive to the oh
does that mean that they're big you will
be gone
this is perfect fine if you if you're
busy busy
[Music]
whoops that was the wrong button
[Music]
reminds me of people asking if the
accents are important in Spanish
spelling
and what is um
what is kittens uh
comment on that
is your native Spanish speaker
[Music]
[Music]
can I explain hey
[Music]
did you not dance
like two screens so
I will have more space to draw
yes accents are important because some
words are different with just an accent
but it usually depends on how the sense
is built but usually [ __ ] as also
important because if you are
accent afterward
um like completely different team
[Music]
but they are having plenty of lazy
people here we don't use the money type
I like to say accents are the difference
between
but I don't know how to say foot seven
anions
but seven Annas
well they'll say you don't need to
sensor
foreign
intonation it's probably not perfect
oh
that's still an important the
distinction to make
there is still the other aspect which is
if you want to consider the
accent accents
so this is a stupid question but I just
lost something that I had in and not see
line and I can't find oh did you put it
down somewhere
[Music]
and that is my my dad's 47 years old
versus my potato has 47.
passes
my anuses this is
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
mm-hmm
[Music]
let's say what a accent marks and
specifically the accent mark not
including the tilde eh
those aren't really considered separate
letters in Spanish as far as I know they
are still important in marking accent
because otherwise the accent will be
wrong of the whole world
but it's not like
yeah
[Music]
well maybe you should bring up this
whole thing then
but that's on you
if
[Music]
I didn't
[Music]
rotate image
[Music]
anyway
[Music]
it's just text
it doesn't hurt you
I lost my sock did you have a sock in
your hand
[Music]
yes
oh I'm not doing socks at the moment
[Music]
maybe sometimes I was putting on the one
I lost that oh well he put two on one
foot that's that's what happened
now I hope you find it otherwise you
just have to take another one I guess
now that's silly
he could I could believe it though we
are quite silly and that's what's why
you're so funny
[Music]
[Music]
I found the it was very last left it
I'd better be taking off now I gotta get
the yes that makes sense
we have a nice dinner
I hope it tastes well
[Music]
yeah me like this sounds really
important because it's behind the body
but
something something something
[Music]
well it is embarrassing I was sitting
out again
and I guess
I guess at least it's not like a hard
thing because not realizing is sitting
um like your keys or something you can't
find it
that's something you should notice but
it's uh yeah
I'll be back in a couple of hours that
seems like a long time tea
eat dinner but
if the stream is still up it really
depends on how many hours you're talking
about
that's done way
[Music]
I will be streaming I want to complete
these drawings I will be streaming for
quite a while
[Music]
the people are free to join and leave as
finished
[Music]
stay into it
[Music]
another embarrassing moment when I lost
something is when I was looking for my
keys and I said I can't find my keys and
they were in my hands
I mean that's
has happened to some people
[Music]
another time is when I lost my glasses I
couldn't find them and they were on my
face
yeah that I could
I could see that happening as well
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
yes you are but it's so great about you
[Music]
and I lost this suck again while you put
it on your foot
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
I
finally doesn't want you to put on soaps
[Music]
for some reason
[Music]
when I need to cover my feet
here
and so don't show you your feet
how do you cry if you do this mouse
[Music]
that that is
open last and pretty sure
every shown here
it doesn't show how to stream
[Music]
still should show
it is
as far as I can see
let's let's make this head
I think I do
[Music]
oh
I should put on some clothes and also
hydrate
[Music]
there we go
it's done
so
okay so like here's the front
but then I put the front here instead
must be corrected
because that doesn't make much sense
[Music]
so I'll do this
all right
I miss her that's it but my feet are
private
um
yeah that's
let's leave it at that
[Music]
I don't know which sentence refers to
the
maybe I don't watch no
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
it's
[Music]
YouTube
mess up
[Music]
the biggest
[Music]
removed it here because it's a bit
distracting
there you go that's a bit easier
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay
[Music]
you are welcome
to this art stream
which was scheduled and you know about
it but
um
[Music]
but still welcome
[Music]
it's so warm is it is it summer already
[Music]
[Music]
no I'm not going to tell you but I want
to know
write it to me in private and
thank you
[Music]
I'm warm blooded
and having worms on my body makes me all
too warm I love Swedish Winters but yeah
try me
do you want to write to me in prayer too
I mean
it's more fun to write in a chat here
but
if there is something privacy
we are free to write
[Music]
now I'm sure about that but it's in
private
you can see anything in private oh
another
nitrate can I get a carrot like this
with her
oh
do you want me to buy your carrot and
CPT
should I have carrot
okay it should have carrot merch
Nomad carrots in private oh oh
the first thing I get in the DM will be
a chair
that's amazing how are you doing you
want a carrot it sounded almost
weird
Alexandria I'll send you a picture of a
carrot
Indians
no no no no not that I meant
all right
yes
not me so that's why
[Music]
oh
she saw it
[Music]
so you don't you don't
foreign
[Music]
but I agree
[Music]
the kitten want a karate the cats eat
yeah I think cats eat cats so that's the
problem
I don't have cats myself so don't take
my word for it
whips but that messed everything up
my sentence
[Music]
that fix it
[Music]
well I had a cat and she ate anything
that was interesting but she didn't want
to continue eating it when she knew what
is it I mean that's that's how it works
right
foreign
[Music]
until you get older and then you decide
that you don't want to eat it because it
doesn't look tasty
[Music]
this looks weird
yeah
this looks less weird
every day is a good day for me oh yeah
you have it kids
I start my day by taking
taking it to better talking it feels
like a really good friends
I I think I know who that might be
I like carrots cats are good
but I haven't had cat in the way
hmm
[Music]
yeah I think this part should be taller
but that's that probably I can't fix
that later
oh green carrots already taste yes but
it takes too long to party store is
always nice
oh it is fun fun
I know it is
but I can't be showing it is
educated kids
[Music]
to get this part it's kind of time
made that high enough
[Music]
because I can't make it kind of like
that I think maybe
[Music]
it better be me
oh
it's here and someone else too
but I keep that right yay I'm making it
with us anyways you're doing amazing
thank you kitten
might it be me you should try to talking
to every morning
[Music]
carrots and fish Maybe
Maybe
uncertainty
[Music]
[Music]
okay and then
it's a very
big sweater
booty
I think it's mighty card jumper
because it's jumping
[Music]
thank you
I don't know which direction I should
just set one in
Evelyn the bun bun that's definitely do
once pounds
[Music]
you know I'm safe and fun I do know that
but you're funny when you're shy and
embarrassed and
shy burst
[Music]
I have no idea anymore
[Music]
I don't know how do you draw a nick
[Music]
so if this is like the shoulder or
something
[Music]
okay that's that's reasonable
yeah if I had like a head battery theme
with an action animation
wouldn't that be nice
yeah don't mind the hand it's not going
to be
too busy behind I guess
we should buy ahead this reference to
see
my other hands and as person as a kid
oh
and it's working
I'm gonna keep that Pride
[Music]
sure
[Music]
sounds a bit suspicious
yeah I don't give me a short moment
finding a quick
reference on how I even should be able
to
draw a hand
[Music]
you know it's shy about stuff but I
would just say it with
that's nice let's see what is it
it's a secret archieved in private
I'm getting interested
[Music]
now
known as five fingers
yes that's normal
and but one one has four fingers
what happens if they hold hands
[Music]
I'm succeeding
because normally when you hold hands
with someone I guess you would
well
[Music]
I guess then when you
foreign
fingers first on one side and then you
have the other person's finger
the other end
is it five and four you can put more
fingers between the five
I should draw this
[Music]
but first off
[Music]
I'm not finding any good references
[Music]
nuts
super great I need a better idea of
[Music]
yeah
of our hands
it's actually I'm still not
yeah drawing hands isn't
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
set the focus on the hands
[Music]
[Music]
okay then by the way how warm is it for
you in F
[Music]
this kitten looks like someone who sees
his he's using Ash
honestly
[Music]

the finite thesis
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
I'm not sure why I'm working so much in
the hand because the hand is nothing
going to work this is a broken hand but
foreign
[Music]
spending so much time on it
it's cute when you sleep thank you

for
[Music]
I'm just nervousness
I've been there is

foreign
[Music]

[Music]
[Music]
yeah now it's a cute fun fun
yeah she has a nice outfit
[Music]
I can't remember every challenge
a kid funny
should I carry it like calling it later
or a taser
in the boss for kids
like hello later or
hello see you soon
I guess I mean some people are
I guess named after him
oh
I know some people have like uh
like
automated voice reading at that but
since I'm reading every comment that's
not necessary I don't feel like
is the most Sunshine Band
yes swaying his wagging but most and
best of all the voice text me you like
my voice
foreign
[Music]
I want my milkshake bounced not shaking
it's a smooth voice and a calm one
oh
I do want the smooth voice and a calm
voice
but that's that's nice
they're nice that you think so
you know is this nice one thank you
I love the accent
does it sound how would you describe it
the Accenture is agreeable to be laughed
we'll see how it changes over time
though
where was I
yeah I was going to ask
Jason
yeah basically I don't I don't remember
which channels I've seen I have seen you
around on different places
but if so many people and my memory is
so bad second
exactly remember every channel
especially when I tend to I try to like
switch and watch multiple streamers
um
try not to like
hang around one streamer for two like
sometimes that happens so I mean
I think
yeah
well your accent is nice that's a way
good way to describe it Swedish
but it's cute and I like hearing it yeah
yeah I'm from Sweden says
so that's that's I guess that's the way
to describe it it's a Swedish accent
I
think yeah I added to watch her today
repeat
I was like I don't really like to see
your first Dream is today before I
started so and I did see you today I'm
pretty sure
but I I couldn't remember on which of
them it was
[Music]
okay so you don't so you don't watch
this funny streaming
[Music]
so how's everyone's everyone's day going
that sounds great
so
trying to get the proportions correct
here
I think I think I kind of got the
proportions is that it's close but it's
not perfect so it looks a bit off
okay that's nice it's nice with an okay
I love watching the funny stream as well
[Music]
wait which Spanish team are you talking
about now
I mean watching this this this this here
currently sporty bunny streaming
this one is streaming
they're going on vacation since that
would be nice oh
I think you mentioned that before
I don't remember
but you're free to give more details if
you want
I'll have you happy you can't spot it is
but but have you watched this funny
streaming
phone picture this is missing one of
these because
devices
makes it harder to drive
but the the sporty outfit is not done
yet you have to wait
um
let's see if it trades are bad or not
well it was showing before I guess you
didn't miss it
it's not razor but but yeah it will be a
surprise
[Music]
is up she will take it off
when I go to Californication also a
doctor appointment too oh and that's the
last severe nice vacation I guess the
but it's good to get it done
well anyway
this is
[Music]
Lolly deal and she will actually stream
in
when the clock is full o'clock
so so in 48 minutes
I'm going to play
Crash Bandicoot which I do like to watch
but I'm streaming this this is like like
an extra stream I usually take this side
that die and you just take this day off
and not to watch his dream but that's
kind of a bonus
I mean I could do this too because
she's she's funny I like watching
streams and stuff
my occasion is 13 days long plus like
weekends or something so well I guess
that's the time you're going to stay
or might include also the travel part in
Canada
[Music]
I hit him so anyway back to the drawing
drawing
I'm going to see if I can make these
shoes
a lot of this is really fun yes
and she has great reactions when she's
saying I wish I could react this much
I feel boring compared to another
streaming
I don't have a share of her reacting
it
was that part of the ear
[Music]
it's not important yes it is your
friends but
it's not important but it's annoying me
well I'm driving up there so it will
take me one day to get there
one day to get back you're not boring uh
well
thank you for saying that
I feel so
restraint
[Music]
like my gameplay
[Music]
like everyone else
and maybe not everyone else but at least
the ones I'm watching
[Music]
type like that okay so yeah
yeah yeah
anyways
um
and then there's like I'm going to do
another
this is what this this is the rough line
art
that is amazing and comforting costume I
guess that's that's what I should try to
go for in that case
hey your gameplay is fine and fun thank
you that's
it's good to know okay give me some
confidence
because that's a thing I thought about
but
I guess
it's just
I'm just a different stream and I should
embrace that
it's not it's not like I'm trying
to be different I'm I'm still going to
be like who I am
it's just
I've thought that that might affect
people if you are interested in watching
and such
you come a long way from your first
video and yeah never that moment I was
one of the first following year at the
time you were the first subscriber too
and you were the first donating bits
you are not first with gifting a sub
[Music]
that goes to
Julie that's who has not been here for a
quite a while I think
[Music]
and then Mickey came in
to the first spot in the most
um
and the first the most bits as well
it's not a race to get the first spot
all the first spots has been taken so
I was going to a kiss no I mean
technically I'm also getting like
I don't have like a proper
donating setup but of technical got
donations already so
yes
also also wept yeah you're doing great
yeah that's
[Music]
the stuff no I said yeah
yeah oh no
that's what is taking
it has been a new tough spot

least to claim other first spots I can

sponsorship yes
[Music]
One Beat

Cold War against me

to kick yet I'm sorry that's just
it is what it is I can't do my yeah
oh
I wish I could set a timer on the shot
because I would say like
because you can't
and because I can't because and yeah
because it means welcome in seven years
[Music]
anyway back to them
yeah I'm sure I could put that time out
that is true
can't she
wait let me see if that works
and it so that's that
as the president said it's birthday so
I just want to see it works
[Music]
oh no you can't set someone a timeout
for seven years that's not valid I tried
foreign
[Music]
test
[Music]
oh
[Music]
this time in front of the cards
everything I I look into that I can see
but options I have later on
[Music]
yeah I find it strange this is doesn't
this is the applicable to specifically
Swedish but I do I do find it strange
that twitch decides to use is your
you white basically the chosen language
on Twitch for you I use Twitch in
Swedish too but that's
for seven reasons
because
if you're honest because even if you
used to it in English if you're watching
for example Spanish twitch streamer your
these automatic messages shouldn't be in
English they should be in Spanish
they should pay because when you stream
you can choose which language your
stream is in and that is the languages
you choose
maybe maybe that would make too much
sense
man
[Music]
you think
that's something I don't know
I said I forgot the message yeah that is
seven years well I don't want to be
times
you know I could try
now when I try today the second time out
it just said that popcorn he can't
steady timer
[Music]
I wonder if it was because of the one
more initial band
when
I don't like like permanent Perma bands
but I guess
I guess that's what time art is it's not
it's a band that is not temporary
Maybe
[Music]
no no there is a difference a band does
not allow you to see the chat at timeout
still allows you to see the chat
the exact time I have this muted
but I want like maybe I can
[Music]
and
now this is his name a reason this now
foreign
[Music]
so the band was okay I mean yeah I mean
[Music]
yeah I guess the timeout also doesn't
remove messages but band does because I
did removed messages
and it's all okay especially if it's
mentioned that the person is that or is
this or say about to happen then yes
purple
[Music]
the purple announcement
shame I mean I guess
I guess the purpleness is a pink
announcement because it's purple pink
so I guess I'll just buy it
oh the director is so the regular one is
pink because okay yeah the regular one
is the channel called I see
but can the bot use that
because if I
[Music]
if I do like this
[Music]
I accidentally yeah but but it is more
of content by the way
that is a scared she had sorry I just
realized the timing
remembering the clothes
[Music]
you like that outfit and pink
I love this cat it's a kid and this
character's gone
she is she me I don't know how you say
it's covering quite a lot of the screen
air so
I can't even show it's covered even more
of the screen most people show much less
on screen
[Music]
yeah I know the security I don't mind
thank you I wonder how it look red red
white one
but you want
you want some black red clothes
funnel space
and that's that's the space for my bunny
[Music]
more bunny I mean there's a bunny
background
that counts
[Music]
you want another bunny
I guess if I do like it
a co-op stream with someone this is a
bit too tall I think
I guess
when the other person is a bunny
it could be two bunnies
and then she makes your minds there with
this let me see if I see
a very thick brush
[Music]
copy and paste
with the perspective but I guess I can
make like this body
it is some illusion of perspective or
something
[Music]
everything's that's not how you moved
here
perspective
this is not the outlines
then when I do the outline I'll try to
fold these
as best as I can
No Such Thing by the way I wouldn't wear
shoes without socks
it's fine
anything else going on
it went quite quite awesome
quite great
foreign
something
or uncertain someone boom
[Music]
that sounds nice
[Music]
I hope that that certain someone enjoys
me
message of writing
[Music]
oh
[Music]
[Music]
is this everything now
and I'll just
try to hide parts that are behind
not too much
okay safely
yeah but you see this
is
[Music]
[Music]
I hope so too bad I'm writing it on
paper
[Music]
analog message
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
so let's move on to
one pun
[Music]
e
more familiar with
some reason
[Music]
she likes it who are you working on
you're writing something on paper is
foreign
[Music]
foreign
yes
[Music]
that sounds nice
[Music]
poem
poems
poem poem and
he was saying both
[Music]
um
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
but only poet
therefore
playing home
but you don't say poet
David poet this should be poem
I think that's fine
thank you
now what was this thing is
[Music]
oh do I need to
[Music]
thank you
so I am
[Music]
stuffy
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
that I think means the next
does it show up immediately or
people have to
leave my comeback
probably have to replace
I will refresh my chat
[Music]
all right now it works
there you go
um
just filling out the empty spots I still
don't have
custom Pom-Pom modes but
one day
[Music]
one day it might happen
I have considered if I should
basically proud of myself cool I got
some work to play with
[Music]
bad tip
I don't feel it would look so nice but
yeah I guess it's better than nothing
to be fair
[Music]
it's nice
when I have
I haven't even
made them yet I mean I can't eat one but
I I it looks so weird
since I have reached 15 subscriber
points with the help of the beautiful
community
that means that there's one slot one
extra slot for
image
therefore they are
they're not six emotes
uh for for subscribing
and then the love text thing that is
when you reach a thousand bits donated
I don't know it's like
in total
yeah like if you can accumulate that
every time
or if you have to do that during one
month
[Music]
because I said I
think I can make the the thing longer
[Music]
no this doesn't seem to be anything
okay
I'm done with my writing
I hope I hope you brought a nice thing
[Music]
a nice Declaration of love
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
I hope it goes well for you
I don't know what I'm doing
[Music]
touch my legs

is the
trickiest
I think that's good

[Music]
sleeping sounds nice
[Music]
laughs
I'm sorry I didn't feel those aspectives
I agree with cute nose
[Music]
foreign

going to get hungry

[Music]
because I'm already hungry
[Music]
that's nice one
[Music]
you like the same seat
switching around different outfits
[Music]
nice fun fun you like the outfits I like
my drawing or the eyes would be kind
enough
[Music]
because I think I forgot
one detail
[Music]
it's nice
she began like that
as easy to adjust that later on
[Music]
so after effects looks good though oh
[Music]
I wish I could draw those outfits it's
not
I hope
[Music]
I'm happy do you think so I really wish
I really need to get a drying better so
I could actually make my own ponton
drawing and then I can basically draw
my own outfits with Pon ponies instead
of relying on the few existing ones
[Music]
um
which will be much more fun in that case
I could draw
outfits related to game sampling and
like that
now I'd like to see tasters and bunny in
the outfits too I'm certain it looks
good too oh well I mean it's being nice
not hard feelings nothing just fashions
beneath it would be neat
I'm so sorry I found
where did it go
I think this has to post a picture of
his bunny
[Music]
[Music]
this is bunny
pick it
another important are both kids and
that's cute characters
and say thank you
yeah
hey
bunny it sounds so cute
that's
and pump fun is going to snuggle the
bunny
keeps false carrots other than my
writing being done I should probably
draw on something yeah yeah Draw
Something
it's interesting seeing people draw
yes
that's your dragon noise
Dragon bunny
[Music]
snuggles I am so funny yeah you can't
you're becoming a bunny Floyd
when when you're here you are a bunny
where's my
that is
easy
but here people are free to be whatever
animal they want
unless it's a private that is not
allowed
thanks Jay I was just being funny
he agreed on the end of the private part
thank you
private nope primate
[Music]
I know it yeah
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
it's boring to me but in some way I
don't know it's because I because I'm
crafting this primary body
I I need to be a bunny
I mean I I don't blame you I mean I I
might I'm not I might not speak
the correct correctly
[Music]
primate is like human yeah human monkey
gorilla
orangutan
lemur
I guess azima would be fine
[Music]
yeah
primate as important as human
[Music]
I guess I guess like lemur is an
exception they're fine if you want if
you want to be a neighbor
[Music]
there's only certain primates
[Music]
yeah it's okay okay here we go uh it's
not it's not specifically all primates
it's more the
popularity
[Music]
or like half lorains
thick it can be any animal you want
unless it's a happy Rhine priming
there we go
[Music]
because those are boring
[Music]
I can't find my right shoe
can you find your wrong shoe
can you find your left one though
I assume that's what he meant
otherwise it would say I can't find my
shoes in general
I mean
kitten he came up silly so
but did you find the one that just left
my left shoe my shoe left
foreign
[Music]
chest
but just my left shoe my shoe just left
there we go my friendly
take one attempt
take one fail attempt
[Music]
now I didn't find it
it's funny
I mean it
your your right shoe is obviously where
you last left it it's not like it got up
and worked away
it doesn't have any issues to be done
[Music]
[Music]
it's a it's a string thumb
I don't know and
hands are my weakness
and that's that's not the right thing
time to just go buy food or with socks
then if you come
if it sucks them if you can't find it
here it's a funny poop
I think I got a confession to make oh oh
feel free to share if you're comfortable
[Music]
I ate kittens right shoe
oh
[Music]
did it taste all right
[Music]
what's that what you had
your
you mentioned before
it's falling back
there we go you said it now I got food
finally that's when he got his right
shoe it tasted like a kitten what
does that means you know what a kitten
tastes like and I don't like the sound
of that
[Music]
uh
oh my what is that what I'm going to do
what did you go barefoot
do it do it like the primates do it like
your fellow primates
I I don't have any shoes on right now
I mean I wouldn't have shoes on indoors
anyway even
but I meant where am I I'm Hospital
that's a side effect for eating right
shoes
what is going on I
foreign
well at least you don't eat my writing
yeah that's
that is
that is your sacred writing
[Music]
must be but back to it I do not know how
a kitten tastes like yeah that's good
but I certainly got some hidden fur in
my mouth once I ate
[Music]
yes I uh he's right here and yeah
[Music]
fun
with your stream I assume it's time for
the fishing it still feels a bit late I
don't know I don't know how
how
[Music]
I appreciate the alert
it's just me being very picky about when
I
when I start my streams and stuff like
even even if I like 10 seconds behind
the schedule time I get for it
[Music]
let's bring up bloody stream on screen
and watch it together
my recipe is important and it's secure
and safe
[Music]
and a hand
it's a very large hand but she does I
don't I do have large heads
do you need another reference
I might need another reference
my everything is important and it's okay
for my tablet cute hand is it cute it's
kind of power like
pumpkin has quite short and thick
fingers
fluffy soft hands okay yeah it might be
it might be fluffy yeah
let me just to uh instead of God
let's see something
foreign
[Music]
Ty oh that was
that's quick unless it was a talking cat
started on before
so when this sign one way of drawing and
now that I did it
friends
says
is to
do something like that
I guess works
thank you
yeah I started yesterday but I wanted to
make it special
you should give it your extra
didn't attach
make it lovely
it's pumpkin holding something or
hugging something yes
uh well Bonnie
yeah
my bunny bunny
[Music]
I'm going to see if I can fit her in
there
[Music]
okay so if I do use this one as a
reference
and then I
do you like this
I don't like that that might work as a
hand
oh it's like more polite
it's been forever be polite
I mean yeah
it says that way but
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
I hope she likes the writing and the
drawing even though
[Music]
I'm not that great at drawing
you
um
[Music]
I mean your profile picture
I assume that's your drawing
it's a cute drawing
[Music]
I'm suddenly we need things
yeah she would she must be happy
and she must be happy
[Music]
I actually don't know which I prefer
this one
this one almost
[Music]
yeah I'll keep that one instead
get enough keys
some adjustments
[Music]
[Music]
like I don't know
the right time is up
I'm not keeping track of the timing
[Music]
of one day it will appear automated
now I see two pump once
I mean
yeah
okay I guess that was it
I guess
foreign
[Music]
clowns are taking over
three Panthers must be very light
normally you have two pom-poms
I I didn't show up anyway it's fine
I didn't need to be that detail but
that's that's my problem I'm out
speaking too DJ
now I can move this freely uh
I can adjust
quickly it's just right
anyway
[Music]
and now she would like it she is a good
friend
and you know what
and you know she would like it
now she likes what you make I see
[Music]
we are lucky I imagine we
[Music]
we are lucky to have so many Pom-Pom pop
pom-poms
right if I need to stop working
no it's not working here that was weird
and me back to drawing
I just hydrated
hydrate again
so
[Music]
then
yeah
she'll be like
[Music]
with something something like that
Maybe
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
but yeah
I guess this is taking
shape
[Music]
put the ears in a separate layer
sister behind everything
[Music]
[Music]
are these ears
there's something
they are very wide and thick
let's see
do you like the ears
I wanna color these ears
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
belongs to some species of rabbits that
has big ears
oh
[Music]
[Music]
my God
looks very soft I would imagine
with all the fur
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
oh yes
let's
[Music]
um
let's have some company produce a large
pumpkin place
[Music]
and that is some company
actually producing plushies a black
YouTubers I've seen and I wouldn't be
surprised if they also do twitch
streamers
but today ours those are small uh I want
some company that can produce a like a
jumbo size
maybe not real size but at least like a
meter tall would be three
[Music]
and maybe with
removable clothes
and that's nice
yes
especially the last feature I had it
of my sandwiches
it comes with extra pairs of underwear
you're so cute
I would like one for myself be honest
let's organize a bit here
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
okay
I mean that
that would help because you basically
four customers each
in that case that would be the other
would be easier to find like a couple
minutes we need to make a prototype and
then
exam
everything after that
but
I probably need more than my currency
for what you see
before anything like that could happen
but that is something I would like to
see
and I was going to just quickly watch me
uh sandwich
it was like a minute
or two I'll try to be
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
come on
they decoration
sandwich
the um
tell us what type of Sandwich she got
I got one with margarine and nothing
else
because I'm boring like that
[Music]
hey Chad where all these happiness we
are all happy here we are all a happy
family
and we all want one blush
very happy
I was distracted by something but I
found it
oh yeah you said you were like writing
drawing
a little sandwiches
I'll buy pen ah
what do we have my wrap tonight now
keep them we get four okay so we get
four
okay we get 10 that's 18.
and by by I mean like
over a meter tall
[Music]
I would say like one and a half meter
would be like a nice nice size to color
it
[Music]
so
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
let's see if we can get this
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
nope
[Music]
well the sports race time is over it's
just
unless you meant that underwear is
sportswear
[Music]
I mean uh
I guess I wouldn't be against
[Music]
seeing that
[Music]
something like that maybe
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
good thing too much effort into drawing
these lines even though this is the
this isn't going to be the final night
mark
[Music]
okay so guess my sonas I got C you can
get yes yes three times
[Music]
guess three times what that's cute
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
another fun game
yeah guess what mine's so nice
[Music]
red panda that's an interesting guess
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
on that
that's that's their pon pon sauna
combination
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
is that the next prediction to have what
Sona is
[Music]
don't forget to changeable outfits that
are cute
and that's awesome
yeah that's
that is true the different outfits point
one has and it's a nice feature of
course the most popular outfits of that
pumpkin has is of course no outfit
just just take off the clothes
on
my
well I guess kissing Emma so-called PNG
tube
[Music]
it would be interesting idea
[Music]
they have a routine
[Music]
if the hair redeems to change
and what outfit I would have on campus
now I feed myself
do you prefer on the wheel which
I'm not sure if I show you all
I think I think tasty is the only one
see you
who's in the window tissue
all right
wheel
this wheel
[Music]
ignore the numbers that that's uh um it
was sorted correctly I wish they had
like a sorting value
well
and stream anyway the idea here is that
because it's uh because other streamers
acid and after a certain number of
subscriptions it gives subs or not
doesn't matter and I was thinking like
five at start
like one one used firing on each ten I
think five
minute to see if it works I mean it is
it does work okay I can spin it but this
won't count yes winner yes
this does not count it does work
speed
and then if anyone lands on that's just
what has to happen
okay the last time I tried this one
right it's off screen it's nice
did they update the website
yeah last time I showed off this wheel
and it landed on draw something as well
so I'm not sure why
[Music]
and uh
it's a it's a bit of screen
turns between
oh there we go
there it is
give me a short moment
where is
come here we go
yeah
because currently
oh not that
it has the green background because they
just
do this
and it disappearance
nope
right now
I like it I would think I can look into
that lady
another drawing every five Subs yeah
basically and the four previous uh Subs
that has been
given out and
redeemed
[Music]
uh I don't know and I was thinking of a
[Music]
retractively count them as well by doing
like one spin every day every start of
the Stream
until all of those are used up or
something like that
but if new new Subs are happening those
and then I will do this bin at that
moment
[Music]
I think that's fair
though
[Music]
yeah yeah so there are like different
different things here everything is
duplicated by three which makes it so
the options uh otherwise each option
would be quite large and it's not as
exciting it's my excitement when the
options are small
and it makes the end stream less likely
to happen
[Music]
So currently on this on the wheel I have
the outfits and I think maybe that
should be like a permanent change maybe
I don't know
for free
then at that it would become the default
outfit when you don't redeem a different
outfit
and free gift sub is basically
and
selecting a random
that's if it display animation that
sometimes work
basically selecting someone from the
chat
that doesn't have a subscription at the
moment I guess
can you even give the person
no if someone decided to subscribe you
can't give them a gift something must
have they must be someone who isn't
subscribed to everyone who isn't
subscribed you guys can
ask you to be included and then
one random person is speak
and begin
I remember us up
as
something like that
uh
you know like if
it doesn't do the
there we go now it works
anyway
if I could make it
a bit however I have a picture of all
the options to show with all the options
are would be nice
with any
because I would like uh to have ideas of
more sink sets the wheel
because it feels like it is a bit too
few options and more options means more
exciting and I don't know
a micro Mouse welcome
you are a Maps
I'm a bunny
a mouse yeah we got a kitten here by the
way
okay
oh thank you for life thank you for the
follow
a mouse yes
a carrot
do uh mice eat child hello army men
yeah I see that you're back
the stream is still going yeah I mean
it's only been three hours so
two hours 45 minutes that's nothing
okay
I'm just distracted by everything
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
now
you too can
you watch it
ad free and use
this exciting image
we have many kitten wolf oh no he's
finally
I don't know I don't remember being
guessing they give up because
dragon and a mouse in here we do have a
strong Mouse as well
who has not been here for a while
actually
[Music]
come back
so so I guess my macro Mouse will be
macro astral Mouse will be astral
for short
I ate today
oh that's why they're gone
that explains it that
that's a bit rude
to eat someone
wouldn't you say
[Music]
I don't think they wanted to be eaten
I like that
long Fox
and it shows up spice and actually long
focus on the on screenshots
[Music]
it is working as intended
I do have a long cat
[Music]
and your next fun fun ice skinning
yeah you would be able to eat a whole
rabbit
so the mozzarella meatballs for amazing
even though some of them exploded
that actually sounds kind of fun
why did the music go
that cat is blushing
I haven't lived in YouTube

I do have more but not on Twitch they
are diagram stickers oh
oh
okay that was this wouldn't work as
as

[Music]
um

that was what I was drawing last stream
and
now her face is more obvious
first time I've seen her face well
waiting I mean this is
maybe you left before I did that face
but yeah this is the cleaned up face
[Music]
yeah maybe this one is
[Music]
oh something good
[Music]
I'm still learning
the art of drawing art
foreign
that timer is up
fun fun
making
but happy to see
more people showing up
so I should definitely do more drawing
streams I feel like
it's doing better than the racing
streams at least that's for sure
foreign
yeah we have a cozy time here
[Music]
but I don't want to change myself tea
so let's move over on these
[Music]
best drawing I ever made was a stick
figure oh
that does require some skills
[Music]
foreign
it's nice to talk to people and meeting
new people
lucky
when
mice show up
[Music]
this this place sure attracts a few mice
[Music]
your eyebrows that's what's missing
cute one piece a healthy sister
[Music]
serve
special
I like this really
sides of the
Elixir the artist did a great job with
the other side
and I'm very happy
or how it turned out
and who knows maybe it's one day I'm I
only be able to draw that
I had an English teacher to give me a
feeling great On Assignment because I
couldn't draw
and that's
a bit weird
what happened that's not happened that
wasn't what I wanted to see
and I wanted to remind her she said like
she's not an art teacher
[Music]
that's that's weird
[Music]
[Music]
it just depends on the attitude like
between teachers and students
[Music]
because I've heard that like
it might touch
change it could have perfect
but I should I don't really careless
stuff a lot I did too that's fine
that's why I had it I need to
um
I need the pump on to have that
one
like yeah I've heard that in English
speaking countries here often like
uh
using formal language when you speak to
like teachers like you use title and
surname but compare that to Sweden where
you just refer to your teacher with
their first name is much more personal
level
and I think that that could have an
effect on the dynamic between teachers
and students
which when I mentioned these uh people
from English being countries find that
to be very disrespectful but it's it's
not it's just it
when you set up a default it's just the
default culture it's a default
respectfulness you're not more
respectful by using title and surname if
everyone is doing that
okay
when everyone is formal
no one is
[Music]
so
um
sorry my phone did the Spanish drawing
did not know why
now my friend does not like Spanish even
though he's Spanish I think it's
it's just hard to type on
sometimes
see
I mean I don't know how that sounds
[Music]
yeah this is like my quality of drawing
[Music]
but this is not a final
and this this was like
what do you call it
three inch
prank
[Music]
finally
it's this one actually probably
that's that's the question I had are the
clouds part of the character should I
should keep the clouds or should I
remove them I want you to ask Lonnie
when she was here
but I'm pretty sure
she did a large but
I don't think she's
listening
maybe she is
I mean I'm pretty sure she's focused on
the game
ever since the game that's required a
lot of
a lot of focus
behind a knife
[Music]
she and she didn't understand
keep clouds I I could try to see if I
can
[Music]
get the club why do you say she looks
evil
okay that's
I like that face
that was a stupid face
he Trace Non-Stop
it was a stupid face
[Music]
I obviously won't keep that face
[Music]
was so cute you're very amazing too
here you're so kind King
I still I still can't accept being
drawing like
amazing I don't I don't feel like my
skills are like an amazing couple
[Music]
I'm still happy for what I've been able
to achieve them like I'm not like what
do you call it looking down that's there
I just feel like amazing
I'm better compliments okay
really amazing it's too powerful and
forward
the drawing is like a cute oh that's
perfect
if you're all insist
a kiss
I think I mentioned by foreign
yeah this one should be naughty
something
nothing I was trying to find things in
your own work on which to bring fruit
yeah
I mean yeah you're right about that
but yeah it's it's that is a good thing
to do like realizing what could be
influenced and such but it's
other notice that some people say like
all the Arts are ugly and bad
and everything about this band and they
don't actually try to find things to
improve on
yes
[Music]
and that's not
[Music]
a bit could last be related to being
better taking compliments
dances the mice pounds
I mean you might be a mouse that also
mice might pounce that I'm not my master
expert
so nothing
I found it interesting yes yes wait
which part do you pounce
um unlike mile mice or do mice pounds
Earth is adorable and super Ruby
duplicate and melting potassium oh
that's
that that's a lot
in that case I will definitely yeah
do the art streams if you if you really
like my heart attack buttons
they pounce things out
that's that's that's neat that's that's
cute that's a kissing
pouncing mice I haven't thought about
that
makes sense thank you
now feel attacked oh there's nothing to
improve my art because there's no skill
as a talent there
so
[Music]
if you have no skill or Talent don't you
think it is possible to build up skill
or Talent
and therefore
a b
be an improvement if it has actually
Improvement
would be an improvement
um more art scenes yes so
I probably said it many times now
let's switch quickly over
the music should not be affected by this
yes so
um basically uh this is the schedule I
hope you all can read it and it's not
too blurry I haven't thought about if
it's too small on the screen
if if it is I'd let me know when I can
do something about that but yeah I will
give it a money two states that's
basically times you can also check my
stream is not over by the way
and we'll continue
on the Discord I do have the schedule
also we'll add that will adapt to your
time zone you can also check this
schedule on
switch
which is just two
which dot TV slash
schedule
that's not that's not that expense
kitchen
and
but yeah if you type schedule correctly
get your
that works right this is a correct link
it goes to my channel and it's currently
yes karate is working
[Music]
hyper by pontoon yes
the
back to the drawing
okay the the twitch schedule is also
adapting to your time
when I first joined a twitch which was
at the start of April my very first
stream was the 2nd of April
I actually joined like late March
actually but I started soon but anyway
it's a twitch then had that uh
a message announcement at the top saying
that
twitch will now adapt to schedule to
your time zone and
my reaction was okay when did you when
did the new Ali
when was this implemented and why wasn't
this implemented implemented like
from the beginning twitch is quite an
old service
and and what time CD is before it must
be the horrible to use if you point from
that time soon
and remember you first Yeah you
mentioned my very first dream
[Music]
it was me uh playing around in the Spyro
that's obviously that's kind of like how
I started spider streaming
it's obvious if you like to check my
whatever times
I don't have
like
a history of all the streams
[Music]
because church is deleting that sadly
[Music]
that's not our glimpse
yeah
I remember the first theme too I didn't
have an account yet I was watching it in
the browser could use that chat and it
was very laggy but yeah I was that time
I was probably streaming at too high
bitrate
then I reduced it and then I got access
to this
should I use to a circle
maybe that worked and so I twitch now
downskins my screens
so you can watch it on
[Music]
on Lower performing uh internet
and I guess the browser on the phone
might not be the best performance I did
I don't know it should be fine
depends on what phone you have
[Music]
I guess
but yeah in that stream
I decided to
I think the first thing I did was
I decided to
defeat All Bosses including
if aspire 2.
at the reunited version
[Music]
I defeated these three bosses with
cameras or spoilers
I don't think it's as pointed at this
point
the game has been out in five years now
or something plus the initial
[Music]
over 20 years the original came out
and without collecting anything in any
of the levels which normally is
impossible
but I did some
brief flight
[Music]
am I supposed to do this
something like this I think
so
yeah I think this is working
yeah it was fun but you always yeah
that hasn't
it's not like um
not super shy at the moment
I would
I for example went to show my face
several reasons
so
[Music]
it was fun I read that I last updated my
phone in 2018 I think I mean I think you
have a
no how old my phone is
super shy pumpkin sounds cute
yeah don't you think I sound shy why are
you so cute
that's that's just
I
I
um okay honest honest answer because I'm
introverted
I guess that's the actual reason
your confidence has improved a lot since
then
yeah yeah
I guess
I do feel that myself
I do speak better I speak I speak louder
I have a better setup for the microphone
that also improves
I'm certain plan for this kid even in
IRL some people they say I'm cute yeah
irons so
according to those people you're correct
[Music]
but I shouldn't judge myself
maybe it's best not to
then of course thinks I'm not happy with
but
and I'll get through it
things will improve
but they're doing great thank you
and you you are going to make it
my phone is from 2022. oh
a fancy
okay in that case I do have to check
when by my friends from it's
July
you can stay what phone is this
air 2017 May
wait
no that was when it was announced 2017
June University when it was officially
released
[Music]
who has the oldest phone that's that's
fun fun 2017
as in as in an actual daily use phone I
meant so I mean I do have a really old
phone line so much but that doesn't
count I'm not using that one
one fun you are amazing very pretty very
nice kind and sweet and a lot more yeah
perfect the way you are
super adorable the Way You Are
[Music]
meant to be we all love you Aquatica
you're used to kind okay I
this is too much
I
I thank you so much for saying all that
[Music]
I I think I think it has wrapped up on
you
that's sweet I love Papa the question
oh I have two phones the Galaxy s22 and
the Galaxy in that um only three
that's a lot of words
[Music]
and they finally found the yeah
useful
[Music]
that's in like
them do you like do you use it often do
you notice that the fullness of it comes
like this because if I I don't remember
they had two phones they called one fold
and they called the other one there
something else I'm being honest
at the end but obviously had to discover
that's the comment
I I appreciate your honesty that's
something you would say to uh a
Christmas or something
[Music]
but um
I appreciate
you being honest with your
the compliments it
[Music]
can I copy this is that okay
[Music]
the phone is nice I have no problem with
it the other phone is the flip okay
which
bolt so the fold is the one that
so it's in the middle like a book
[Music]
and yeah because the connection I do is
that the flip is like a flip phone
and the phone is the book phone
the is that did I get it correctly
actually I trace that I mean I did the
transit kind of badly I'm going to
redraw it basically so it will be a
double Trace
there was a lazy trace it it's the first
step too so
hey you try to avoid
even doing that but
I didn't want to deal with it to spiral
for
a half an hour
yeah I have the phone that my mom had
the blip I bought it they flip for my
mother
that's that's been a kind of team
I hope she appreciated it
because that's quite the uh
that's quite
the extraordinary present is that the
correct word
quite quite uh
huge present
more like expensive it's not easy
that's the part that I found it should
not be huge
okay
it is very kind that's great
not everyone is so lucky
to myself my my mother is very kind
it was
one thousand eight hundred dollars
US dollars
but it made her I sure believe that
I mean
if I were
well I would in my situation prefer
money over an item but
so I wanted to compare like if I was
given my thousand eight hundred dollars
that that would certainly make me happy
that would solve so many of my problems
that
what anyways
that is
so very kind of you and it really shows
that's obviously not
the only way to begin but
[Music]
um
from my perspective that's that's
something I wouldn't even be able to do
so
thank you
[Music]
yeah I I think their hands and that
should be higher up
so let's
[Music]
put this thing
or a separate nail
I wish I could select multiple of these
if I try and just
so control I can select one with if a
shift is drawing and from one point to
the other day
if I
put the pest control and shift
it's
selection
but the selection of the layers is not
selected instinct which is a shame
maybe there's a function to do it
[Music]
alt is changing the size of the
place
[Music]
just off
is picking color
and I'll see
well change the size of this thing
because you're thinking about shift
back to you know what I'm saying
[Music]
so maybe
that's a thinking
[Music]
yeah maybe like holding it higher up and
then
rotating the hand baby
[Music]
and also the outfit is way over the time
limit
it's about what is fake and even though
I was kind of a bad kid he helped me up
and then I helped her most recently when
she was in the hospital oh
that
I wasn't ready for that that
I hope it's uh
you said what though that fast I hope
everything went fine
and she's healthy fully healthy again
yeah I can yeah yeah my mother is not
fine now that's good
it just took me
[Music]
um
once you're coming why
[Music]
what is the difference to
[Music]
my English isn't the best
at understanding everything
[Music]
you know it's only when they needed
something from my body oh
I see now I see what you mean by
[Music]
why are you recovering
that's that's very
[Music]
that is very kind of you
[Music]
it's bad
and
if when you said something I'm not good
at biology yeah
it depends if it's something that
regenerates or something that don't
I mean obviously I educated
it's it's still
to select
[Music]
it's still a big thing and a great thing
it
every gender it's like like blood or
something like that
it's in a
cute thing
but if it's like something that doesn't
regenerate
that's uh very
big thing
yes I mean
it's a very hard decision
it was blood oh did you say something
blood the blood donations
[Music]
you made it sound quite I mean it I mean
it's still it's still like
it's like it like
[Music]
in my family I have a dream that
whenever you need blood you need it
again I mean it makes sense because as
far as I installed it you cannot accept
any kind of blood it depends on what
blood type you are
foreign
like blood donations I think is the most
common
the body
[Music]
seem to donate
but uh
very nice nice of beauty
[Music]
do you say stand up
I don't know I don't
[Music]
I don't English
if I was being profit at the moment yeah
you're
[Music]
thank you Chinese Mass
she could have a closed mouth that works
too she doesn't need she doesn't need to
speak
I think like the open mouth like
speaking
about a close bar or shoot I don't know
Wi-Fi said she she
said something
[Music]
that's
a very small
Mouse
[Music]
very very small
[Music]
it's even smaller than that
[Music]
I could probably make it
all right
larger later on
if liquid
yes
um
cheers
now let's see if I can
do the eyes without making her look
evil
don't like that yeah
there we go
we once had a box at work that was
supposed to go to a research lab but it
passed it open in the comments spoiled
the contents happen to be human kidneys
awful doesn't begin to scare how bad the
smell was
someone wasn't packing that one properly
such a waste of
organs
someone didn't pass the package before
they sent it off
me
and then I just pick a good spot
[Music]
maybe I should like
[Music]
do something here
I think I have an idea
not their selection
[Music]
look at that
that didn't get planned
yeah me and my family we always care for
one another
that's good that's good I remember when
I was literally the blood and my
[Music]
and my pants by dealing with my sister
at the time and my great grandfather
came in his books
that is good yeah I think
as as because it hasn't happened in my
life yet but I do think that before
relative would need blood I would and my
blood would be compatible
I would very likely
do it
I don't see why
I didn't do it
I mean it's sure if someone else
could do it and it's like
I actually have something that's I need
to do but
[Music]
in that case someone else could do it
and that's in that case there's no
problem but we like if everyone else is
busy and I for example have a stream if
that's like what I have scheduled in
that case now I would probably help
I would likely I would say yeah I wanted
the latest thing to do it not amazing
air
[Music]
and of course this would be
and I think most people would be
understandable of that everyone here
[Music]
I see I think that's that's reasonable
I hope I didn't say this YouTube
[Music]
I think everything is Miss number
and that wasn't the worst thing I've
smelled metal at work I think you should
eat nothing at work I'll try to find out
a few months ago there was a box it was
leaking that's a good sign they called
it the Hazmat the responders as is
normal
it makes sense or anything that's
leaking they get that open box and
inside is a trash can Cortana is
remembered here
someone cut this thing into pieces cut
to put it into pieces
and Trust everything in it this trash
can okay
but I'm not familiar with that another
system keep man this kind of thing since
the first episode
I yeah
[Music]
that's a weird thing
[Music]
people are weird
[Music]
you know thinking if I did something
like that maybe it's squished down like
that
I think that looks good
[Music]
and it was a rotting I can imagine
[Music]
by the time it goes to our building it
that's why it's not bad I don't want to
know what this rotten hair smells like
foreign
Ty this sweet it's not a lolly
because it's a shame
here
yeah you don't want to know what it
smells like I hope I never get this
money
it does that's my one wish
and that's because not to get the smell
right it's a bit too small and then I
think of it think about it
her head seems to be smart too
I've been doing some adjustments
that foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
something
but I will
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
but uh what I wanted to do
yeah
it was to have
[Music]
make Pom-Pom in some way animated
[Music]
you're splitting up on into different
parts
and I don't know exactly how about
pajamas blinking speaking
moving with
it sounds like a smelly job my job that
I usually just
way up to this space like jetfield has
crafts
he's not supposed to be
[Music]
and then by making that an animated
plug-in thing I will also set up to
automatically change outfits unlike
queue up outfits changes
and change it directly so I don't have
to
normally it just smells like diesel fuel
from all the 18 wheelers
18 wheelers
[Music]
[Music]
and also against ice
I'm setting
[Music]
everything
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
like that maybe
[Music]
[Music]
I was outside no I'm messing it up again
[Music]
[Music]
but the kidneys
we're supposed to be on Fox with dry
eyes but the Box person
we're not supposed to ship that sort of
thing
understandable
hello
to just figure out your name
Alexandra Gabriel
I like I like Alexa
[Music]
depends on where you're from on the
pronunciation
of organization
um welcome welcome
welcome to this art
stream where I'm drawing bunnies
bunnies okay
Alexandra Gabriel
thank you for the following foreign
I do of course
was the wrong word I do also that's what
I was looking for uh play games
on other days
if you're interested in that as well
otherwise I will try to continue drawing
on Mondays and Tuesdays in the future
hello I am I
I
say cookie okay
good enough about it
I feel
fine
but what about you
since
I'm From Italy
[Music]
Italy yeah yeah I'm not I'm not a native
English speaker so
plant might have been obvious already
yeah that's what and not yeah yeah
because there are people from different
countries and that's why
I think like the English pronunciation
which has a non-native English speak to
myself do you find kind of weird
sometimes
so I can pronounce it
however you want
well it's something reasonable similar
to you
those things
it is
I've never mentioned it before but there
are some streamers you use completely
different names of users in the chat and
it's a bit confusing do you follow along
when that happens
there
apparently you can if you did write that
on from memory you are pretty good
right maybe not being able to hold this
conversation but it has much more than
most people it's interesting yeah what
are you looking for a Swedish dreamers
or something
[Music]
you're so kind
I I just said that the English sounds
weird you're so kind
that is basically yeah I
I guess it is more like I respect the
non-english pronunciation of people's
name and that's kind of the
Italy
well I I can't pronounce Italian but
no
I speak Swedish at a basic levels oh
well that's pretty neat you and that is
you
I wouldn't say that you can you know
very little Swedish if you can easy
communication
at least my experience with learning
languages
that's still quite
quite a bit
[Music]
other cheeks are kind of far apart
[Music]
yeah
I'm basically drawing feathers at the
moment
[Music]
have another streamers
okay
[Music]
let's see
[Music]
but you can't really call it a pet
her face is a bit too big but she's
about separate folded for it baits
at that
[Music]
I hope that doesn't mean anything in any
language
I mean
the Swedish word for speed is a fart so
I mean
[Music]
if someone happens to mean something in
a different language that's that's just
well oh well
[Music]
I didn't speak that language so
[Music]
and we should be able to speak our
languages without being concerned about
Welsh accidentally meaning something
else not even nice
it's not supposed to look weird
[Music]
you trust me
[Music]
I guess that's not a little bit better
man maybe the mouse is a bit too
[Music]
maybe rotated a bit
to learn a language
there are different ways but sometimes
you don't have to know that language
perfectly
simple communication is enough then you
learn to master life over time yeah yeah
I have heard some people is basically
saying
when he said that first thing there are
different ways I heard someone say like
I don't want to learn grammar I was just
want to learn language but he
says like I find that the way of saying
that is dismissing ways of learning a
lunch
I prefer learning grammar because that
allows me to put words together properly
welcome
back from yours
12 minutes breaking
I guess why are there no timestamps on
the chat I have here
on the normal twitch chat there right my
tiny little B right back here here yeah
I mean if you didn't have anything say
that's fine magic I'm just joking around
we get silly on this channel so be ready
for silliness
important to not take everything serious
here because nothing is here she's here
[Music]
I probably should move
one pun's face up a bit
[Music]
I never learned a single grammar rule in
Polish but I've been complimented on my
fluency by native speakers and that's a
perfectly valid way to learn language
that's not that you said I I did but I
have gotten like that feeling from other
people that my method of learning
a grammar because that's basically
like yeah that's actually when
at least a one person said that thing
that when I said hyper and it wasn't
just I said I prefer learning but the
discussion was that my preferred way is
to learn this language to grammar and
that's basically when the person said it
and then it just sounds wrong it sounds
[Music]
I wanted to use the word arrogance but
that's probably not the right word
a dismissing my way of learning
basically
I can speak 17 languages okay
I'm far from that so what do you mean
like a simple communication at least
because it's that what you mean by that
Swedish including those 17 languages
I mean I'm not dismissing you knowing a
lot of language because that's still
impressive
but once a little bit yeah I should
probably continue
but with time you improve a flexibility
yeah
that doesn't make sense I mean I feel
that
the more you know the language you can
actually use other resources other than
language learning to learn the language
like actually watching
in different kind of media in that
language
that's a god of mind no several
languages
the camera of any language is also clear
thirsty
if everything has his name
[Music]
yep
so how much can you show off of your
Swedish skins
because this is a sweet Channel after
all so
but in that case if you know 17
languages likelihoods that you would
stumble upon our channel that speaks
whatever she is dude he's very high
[Music]
how was the product in the translation
yeah that sounds like the area you could
coming a human translator can make a lot
of money I can't imagine
[Music]
me knowing Swedish and English doesn't
really sound like a useful
too will to have because like over 90 of
Swedish speakers knows English so
[Music]
now the more it gets yeah the backs
makes perfect sense
I am practicing yeah
I'm actually quite trying to find the
Spanish at the moment
is that like I can speak it though
[Music]
[Music]
I have to look at one word
because I forgot what the word was
I will remember what it is when I see it
[Music]
again that's the word
[Music]
Here Comes
[Music]
oh
it has 50 times
I've been learning Swedish Japanese
language as well as Italian friends
English people use a
no and slime which potatoes
[Music]
right now I'm able to find it okay I
need to get more to hydrate me
accurate learning Swedish too but
[Music]
in Spanish it's so cute
sorry my phone mistyped your name I mean
your moms are close to each other what's
that spin pin
well apparently I need to hydrate so I
will go in there
a locate myself some drinks and then
Marshall also getting hungry and hungry
so I will make myself a quick sandwich
too so give me
a minute or two
thank you
foreign

if I only see one star tonight
I am I'm curious what's going on
I mean honestly cloudy I guess
yeah learning languages is funny do I
speak English it it's not my first
language my first name
I mean
yeah there are a lot of people here not
speaking English as a fresh language
you make it sound like this right
foreign
[Music]
yeah I don't think you need to learn
that I mean it could
Imagine Learning Latin could help
learning Spanish but I mean in that case
you could probably just learn Spanish
from the start
but of course I haven't learned a lot
since I actually don't know
but anyway cat drawings welcome I did
see you before but I wanted to get down
to here
to to your message so you are G
which is the name of the letter J in
Swedish
which is what you have written there
I will be right back and go to see if I
could transfer the stream to my place if
I mean to transferability all you have
to do is open it because
[Music]
if I have
uh twitch integration I wouldn't
like it twitch watching double meaning
can I see a cat rolling
yeah it is it's the rather like I did
get a multivitamin vitamin
multivitamin and before I have but they
stopped selling that one for some reason
so oh well less vitamin seconds

past years of your presence
oh yeah I guess I guess that a lot of
stars should I take a picture
and E
depends whatever welcome
[Music]
cut the Rollins again
did you like to write very short
messages
[Music]
yeah because it also had a lot of
different fruits it was tasty
and cheap
taste in sheep a good combination
and a nutritious
tasty and cheap
very little sugar
I mean it was like natural sugars or
something I think
it didn't have an added sugar images
like
as far as I could tell I didn't have any
attitude
but carbon hydrates whatever you call it
[Music]
all right
[Music]

[Music]
I was here is the head good size I think
the head is getting starting to be at a
good size now
[Music]
I'm back welcome back
[Music]
wait what I mean wait a minute

feedback
if
I do find it funny when people say that
they're Batman and never told that they
went away
oh it's perfectly fine
I don't know yeah your last busy bus
okay
stamps here seconds yeah it's definitely
annoying
nothing again
can I add any but it's in some way
chat appearance oh there is there's
something that's what they say but
there we go now I can see what's going
on
Billy and kit
that's the theme of this channel it
should be silly it should be cute it
should be cozy
my sweetheart card me oh

of lovely sweetheart

to come back
everyone is the correct one here
everyone is welcome
my commander doesn't plan to lengthen my
shift oh yeah hopefully
not
well that's kind of have to control and
I hope
I hope your boyfriends understand
[Music]
the ear should be in front of just not
behind the dress
but it makes sense for the ear to be
however I can make the ear behind the
all right baby
[Music]
yeah so it should be like this
[Music]
foreign
which Navy is that
I mean you don't have to review the
location

everyone else has himself
wait a minute am I sitting up
I'm feeling sorry

just me my memory
yes you are you have a really reveal
your location
sometimes I say things before my
I think
that is actually
okay I have slow memory
foreign
yes
I hope the Navy is good
okay let's see
so
when I was after normal button when I
was
made me
okay how about the ear goes in front of
one eye without the body
that can work
between here
someone wants to beat somebody

word
[Music]
yeah I think this camera

in that case it doesn't matter if they
want the pizza or not you're going to
give them the pizza anyway
[Music]
[Music]
Okay so
[Music]
but but when I'm not working and I like
my friends and my boyfriend I
occasionally offer Pizza to eat
that sounds nice
how do you like pizza

Sunday

I'm going to think here I'll just put
the part
[Music]

what you're saying

that's
that's what you're doing as new job I
see hey
that's why you know so many languages I

hey
Macy anymore yeah she seems like a very
important job
you could see it being worth a lot
what type of pizza do you like pumpkin I
kid basically take anything
and
I like I like ham
I like like
I think I think one the one I
liked the most but
other the pizza prices are going up
which is in life is the ham
and
pineapple
combination
[Music]
like I'm sure
I don't know anything I've ever had it
and show this but I
think I've had tuna
which was
which was kids
I'm shrimp pineapple yeah how are you
taking notes I see you

it doesn't have a consistent name in
different places I see I myself wear it
with Lane
[Music]
airplane or Kebab but yeah yeah I
came out is fine but for some reason
okay I can only have a certain amount
until for some reason I can't help much

like an icon to the on skin chat for
which animal you're chasing
now yes Department I'll send you pizza
with food now
and it's time to
is available here
never had that
[Music]
is
yeah
[Music]
do you think that's an expensive
[Music]
I mean the
I could easily just watch the pizza
pizza place to get a pizza
is that that's not necessary
wait where did you get my address from
I'm gonna make my own pizza because it's
not easy to find it anyone who hasn't
share with us stopping
[Music]
I think I've seen it I haven't paid
attention it's like too nice English
tickets
[Music]
my pizza the dryer is looking good good
that's
do you mean you're driving your mind
right
I mean it could be either
[Music]
[Music]
and then one is flying
flirting in the air
don't don't mind the floating bunny
bunnies have the ability to deflect
Urban States
so
yeah I do that see this is why I
shouldn't expect this time
it's Romance
this one
but this time making the
[Music]
[Music]
red fingers which weren't accurate in
the first place
banana oh yeah do you like banana Pizza
[Music]
I have had a very long time ago but I
think it's the curry I don't like on it
I'd like to trap another Pizza without
curing and see everything
okay
Bunny's not supposed
[Music]
[Music]
her ears are melting
[Music]
yeah I think I need to change the angles
this just looks weird
it's like her arm is broken look
Corrections here
and that's a fluffing kit
yeah she has a really cute character
and
I love
I love the design
which is one of the reasons I wanted to
draw even though it's a lot of details
to draw
but
I'm like actually another on the final
99
[Music]
over the rest here
[Music]
[Music]
is another one
all right that was supposed to eat
I was supposed to split these up
[Music]
where's the problem because no that it
has been completely separate I can't do
that
[Music]
okay that's I think that's better okay
[Music]
thank you
nice
yeah fluffy cute teeth even if you've
got skins but it was a easy
sorry
I was doing that
[Music]
uh
I really need to get the free
um
very nice things to working on the other
starting I don't see seeing the chat
anyway
[Music]
but yes I can keep track of the pronouns
I want to be respectful
[Music]
today all the time
[Music]
so
anyway
[Music]
taser was a bunny while in these chat
[Music]
so
[Music]
so this is the uh
basically almost finished drawing
[Music]
let's do their online for here now
because that was not finding a lot of
time
[Music]
like slide guide or something and I'm
weird
so cute it's so cute so far I like
Darkness
I'm happy you like it
this looks so good it looks so cute
fine yeah so nice
I
don't feel like it's super good I'm I'm
happy with what I manage but
I'm
I don't know what to say
I do like how it looks a lot
oh that's that's that's great to hear
I should be I should be happy with
[Music]
me
that's a different
it's too much
no you are talented
should I start with slowly again not
even left it right
so if we're going to do the outline
send me a message on this one yes
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
that's
hey
[Music]
that's great
lonely
um Charlie do you
as I said
[Music]
oh no why do you create all these empty
ones
I didn't ask for this
foreign
color yes that is the next step
I will do that
I find it what should I begin with the
hand maybe let me get a decorate outline
color
[Music]
um
this looks like to be the outside
the secrets
value
[Music]
and this will be
outline of the hair
[Music]
yeah this is the color so
[Music]
guide here
okay the reference I'm doing so there's
like
the outer outline and then the inner
detailed outline things
so I got to make it so complicated
how sick should I do the line art
and that's a kiss
the fun fun oh I gotta make it so
complicated
find it on Spotify
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
doesn't have any shaving
[Music]
it would be weird to add shading to
lonely I feel like
thank you
to see these other does not
[Music]
I mean I'm going
to
[Music]
add colored outlines super lonely mind
I mean maybe should add the color
Darkness to on on as well this
bunnies also don't have colored
airplanes
so it makes sense
adjustments there
so not having it for Pom-Pom might be
kind of weird
[Music]
foreign
so this is the
foreign
is fading
[Music]
oh yeah we got the new commentary survey
I'm sorry forgot to pay it today yeah
[Music]
so
yeah I will be more active on the server
when the stream is over
it has to be expected
not
yeah this is the
outer outline and then there's the inner
outline which is different
I'll do this correct
yeah I'm definitely using secure nice
should I do them scene there
[Music]
I could do that oh cozy it's cozy time
[Music]
because I can't do them
see never doing that
let's draw this
um
[Music]
this is a poodle
Percy time is best time yeah
fluffy bunny
[Music]
[Music]
well it is working so
[Music]
I think I think this would be good
oh
[Music]
you need to be beautiful with some
[Music]
and nice colors
foreign
[Music]
if I may ask
I mean what you had
watching
this thing already
okay
my fan is now investigating here
now I did some this sounds weird he was
here watching
and now it says it's cozy
let's be suspicious I was fighting down
something up okay
yeah that's right
that sounds important
[Music]
investigator point one is on the case
now here's the thing
there are different shades here I should
have bothered doing that
because that's kind of kind of Polish
but
somewhere
over here
[Music]
someone could argue that that is uh
shaving
but that sounds important this pumpkin
got pets nope
I don't I have plushies if that counts
[Music]
maybe from the Sun I was just
strange cells I made
me too yeah I just think classes can
count if it's involves cat dog or bunny
what only does what about the Reds
or a mouse might be oh or a kangaroo
or
a Pokemon a Pokemon is a patriot
where the meow that's probably what I'm
a song in that case
there are no cats here
but they are cats here but sometimes
they are not in the house
canceling the house
okay it looks like the shoes are kind of
the neutron
[Music]
I would use the shoes as I guess it's
kind of between all the colors of the
the hair this is like the
unshaded version
I don't feel like
that is too complicated
I like the shading but
[Music]
fine Mars is fine even Pokemon is fine
they don't count like
yeah I can't hear you
dark
a lot of animals why why do you have to
exclude a lot of pain ones
[Music]
how how do I feel something quickly I
know this message
but
there's a quicker method there but
then they start fraternity
investigate how I should
draw that
[Music]
I will now investigated a rare case of
[Music]
the excitement builds up
[Music]
hidden expected in your channel it it is
the in the lower right corner
and on in
in my early right corner is it's it's
kitten free thing meow meow
that is cuteness
[Music]
he meant being in her own way that's
pretty cute she doesn't have to be quite
cute anyway
[Music]
and do I agree with you on that
[Music]
I'm very cute indeed
is a fox with my mind
is it a foxy tonight but he did with our
songs too
indeed indeed
[Music]
it is
box
I also inspect you can I keep this video
yeah what animal are you
[Music]
animals here
[Music]
[Music]
we go look at the hair it's not shaded
but I hope it's a good
the hair is in color but not
but not the rest
if people want to donate
[Music]
I like the fox emails during the hand
bopping
[Music]
but I don't know
how much I always say how
I don't know it depends on what
uh first off if you have a recommended
if recommended the emote artist if
that's first step
for example
a vixi has the foxes from it's made by
nalis
oh
um
say how it's pronounced
[Music]
but right now I'm pretty busy with panic
commissions I would be accepting more
requests okay
what is that
game it's a possible few No No Youtube
commission though
[Music]
five emotes for 175 euro
I mean they argued so I guess that's a
fair price
[Music]
so there we go there's the that artist
who makes good
image but is I should have added that
that they don't accept them at this
moment
and also regarding
emotes that which of course require
because which is annoying and have this
all these emote slots and stuff
annoying me
[Music]
So currently I have
six
six emote slots for static and too
animated I should technically be able to
use the animated ones to upload static
ones on those
I do prefer static over animated anime
and then there is level two and level
three which no one is paying for it's
too expensive for a single emote and
those image slots doesn't don't even
expand which I find silly
and then the ease if you donate a
thousand beats five thousand and ten
thousand
[Music]
but it really depends on if they are
accumulating and never resets
oh
it's fine let me know when you're back
[Music]
the strengthy one between your channel
and Community your viewers adapted and
especially immersed when you reach a
certain beats rewards here once the name
and Slot is unlocked you can use
demoting that's not anywhere on Twitch
just like any other subscriber emails
you're much less available being at this
thousand Beach rewards here
starting with well one five hundred
thousand
it doesn't yeah we'll we'll see how it
works
oh another Beaver patchy
see how it works if the you lose them
after
the thing resets
but if you keep them forever
thank you
I mean I get that
subscription emails you have to
continually pay for subscriptions for to
keep those but that's a whole set of
emails it's not a single one
[Music]
paying 10 US dollars is the equivalent
for a single emote to keep it for like a
month but that would be silly
[Music]
[Music]
especially when I don't have anything
good to offered
press it if you know all day I mean
there's a
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I guess you could post
any of you really post emotes from other
uh
streamers who has verified
to the artistic
and to add emails that
looking well made I've seen somebody
it's like my iPhone but
I don't see that funny
[Music]
yeah and outside
characters
yeah it's like it's kids
[Music]
cute
you should add
that
whatever they call it credit
because that's the thing you can do
[Music]
that voice
oh yeah yeah you can do that by
selecting the emails in the email if the
screen where you add your Custom Image
to you just click on your the emote and
then you just search for the user who
made that image
and I'm able to
add myself right
do that
[Music]
why do I need to do that one anyway I
heard something
foreign
[Music]
yeah yes I am doing a nice artwork
and I went with a lolly ponfon and
Bonnie
welcome here
so I I assume you you played the crash
today because
[Music]
it is
it is Wednesday
so how did that go
[Music]
did you have a success
I really should watch that
[Music]
I thought later on because it's fun
it's more fun too like you participate
in the chat
is yeah
it was full of delicious session that's
the best part
yeah it's actually it's fantasy overcome
it it's the whole it's the whole journey
the struggle the getting close to doing
it and then succeeding it's amazing to
see
then you're making good progress there
that's three levels last week if I
recall correctly
so it's three levels plus a bus you can
count as four levels
[Music]
will it be five levels next week
that would be a
a fresh one in centrality
thank you
yeah
[Music]
that's that that's
yeah yeah that must be yeah welcome to
the yeah
yeah that would mean the important to
the next item
because the boss should be the last
of the second Islands
[Music]
so long it's collapsody messy guy
the first crash
pain that's a good description of it
especially if you want to do the time
trials
[Music]
playing it on Saturday yes
that I will do
so now we're talking about this there we
go Saturday Sunday
yeah hopefully your time zone is
included
yeah that's when I'm start
thank you for the follow
hey how do you say that
Eva unit case
so
the schedule is also on the about page
oh I forgot to change my outfits
the routine
but I don't have the redeem set up
automatically I had manually confirm the
Earthly changes
I'm just playing it to make it through
the level yeah yeah
I do want to collect everything except
this time chance
but I will I will go through the game
first because that's basically what you
have and then you can go back and finish
the levels
there are those annoying platforms
yeah yeah yes
there we go
is your name Eva Eva Eva
and are you gay
I mean
yeah yeah I'm I'm too curious sometimes
I I just don't know about the unit
would mean
I miss I said about yourself
yes yeah in that case that's probably
yeah
some time on route
do you like the I spent so long on that
transition I know I'm
I'm messing up the screen again
I wish I can lock the UI
thank you
perfectly happy with it
but it did turn out a bit better than I
expected
[Music]
oh it's your roommate today
Diva unit is from the
um
the anime Empire
and that's not how you see it
um
um yeah I'm not going to be able to
pronounce that scene
[Music]
yep eh it's Evangelion now okay okay
and yeah they're okay oh well yeah in
that case
I'll make sense
[Music]
Neon Genesis
Evangeline all right
that's that's just what it's called now
probably I heard how it's pronounced
sometimes but
I'm not sure
yeah but
I need some pronunciation guide
I'll be close Okay and guys in case I'm
happy with it
I'm
[Music]
these words
I have not complained about it
oh it's e
Evangelion
[Music]
I assume
what is the
[Music]
then
yeah transition
you're so much better than artist than I
saw it here
how do I do a transitions
oh on a
yeah I
guess when it comes to these
[Music]
yeah yeah yeah
um yeah
when it comes to those syllabus I can
never really
figure out how they are pronounced
I always
ask my mom took me a long time to shop
very slow I
mean are these
I often point is showing up on screen
I can imagine that again and also these
gradients
and
I I don't know how to decision
transition was made but
[Music]
yeah
bitter is very cute thank you that's
I a lot of people say it's cute so I'm
happy I'm happy I'm able to make it make
it cute
that's that's my goal it
it makes it easier Hey sister
makes it easier as just a pure gradient
is the cast style it like that ah
yeah pure gain it might be easier
[Music]
but I also wonder if
um because a bunny or a pumpkin doesn't
have any shading
or gradients so I wonder if adding
ingredients or shading would make make
it look weird
so I will start start without that and
we'll see how it turns out
and work from there
if someone is already perfect they are
able to make kids that's cute
if not cutie oh that though
that's a good
I should remember that
wait a minute
oh yeah I moved
[Music]
let's bring back that
let's see I I need to finish this
as long as it goes from dark to light
wherever you want this
yeah
yeah
I will I would maybe give it an attempt
no kitten
knowledge is another one but yeah I
haven't
think they're already giving a shout out
basically
[Music]
okay
I can give you another shot that's
because
it's a cute bunny bunny to watch
very nice and
and all the other stuff you constantly
write in the comments about me
Yes dear father
it's definitely worth watching
[Music]
thank you you're welcome
I started watching
[Music]
when she was dreaming spiral of course
that's that's uh basically how I would
get they watch every streaming it's
either because they are extremely
inspired at some point or they are
raiding someone else
air who I find interesting
um
difference
[Music]
once I am getting my own bunny anklets
out of the ref I got I will show them in
your server from Fantastic
I would love to see that
others wrong too
that sounds cute
and
I need to hide it I've been streaming
and talking for a
five hours now
I probably should team
hydrating moms thank you
maybe you should
post it on a lonely 17
your hydrate is out of stock what who's
now
it's
no it's not
foreign
[Music]
I'm not sure what's going on
there we go
that's the hydrate
if you remember what I've just been yeah
I've had issues with twitch on mobile
before
okay but it's only been when I use it
again by the way and when I use I redeem
it's sometimes never comes back
but no one used it since you came in
here so I'm not sure
yeah the
dinosaur why that happened
and honest so yeah I don't know
yeah yeah now now someone did treating
me too
it's uh it's like a two minute cooldown
or something
so it's after a minute
after a minute from now it should appear
again
and also had the issue with the whole
redeem button disappearing on mobile
that's a weird one
yeah I don't want lucky five hydration
teams at the same time
I think I
being
thank you
they're joking
it's a very quick drawing
I see you oh that's that's
close up
I like to I got to figure out how to try
the profile how yeah how does how does
it work in profile
[Music]
I mean any practice more but but here's
a good variety
it gets the uh
it keeps the emotion
and already candy see then
do you have a candy store in your hair
like Pinkie Pie
storing stuff in her hair thank you
sourcing was a long time ago
practice makes perfect but you are you
are already perfect
yes yes adorable amounts I love them
I love them on
[Music]
very side I'm gonna add candy
the difference right Beret and stuff and
she
is a great artist
here we go yeah at least the ones I have
access to attractive no no no
people say that I'm perfect
no
if I'm perfect you're beyond perfect
amazing and so adorable
um we were discussing about finding
someone who could draw some fun funny
mods
and and doing like a fun dressing
for that
discuss the emote is
fun but I did the other one yeah that
one does look different I was wondering
I was wondering why that one was
different
[Music]
point which why are you not cooperating
if you
other just required them to have a
Twitch account
but if they do have and you do you want
to give them credit for the for it you
can you can add it on the we didn't talk
about that
is
efficient maybe not everyone it's just
it used to let people know anyway both
of you are really amazing City
so it's too many compliments I I I'm
going to
I'm going to overload by these companies
I'm working on setting up email
commissions
can I be first
although I need to
um
actually do
the fundraising
[Music]
I
um
[Music]
it's
cute
you're so kind and adorable you videos
is super great
this is
this is what this stream is
I'm being
it's like
why they why didn't I don't know
yeah I can add them
they've done a bunch of YouTubers in the
scuffed Style
ah
some reason I want to remember someone
called singers
which I then
um
um
I'm trying to think and type the same
time because I I obviously made a
connection to Cinder The Dragon inspired
[Music]
yeah they're probably the only seen the
name and not actually the age
because I'm not exactly recognizing them
but
[Music]
that doesn't fit the end is fun when I
finally get started up now I'll have
them up for a while so if you've seen it
is the ones you have any fans I'd like
to make some for you that would be
amazing well uh you hear that
these people's life
[Music]
people we need a we need a
name
[Music]
the bunnies here at albany's B and the
Animals everyone here is an animal
needs to have a lollies obviously money
that was not easy
especially distract you from China
that's also this dream I'm constantly
being distracted
okay
it's fine
[Music]
um
yeah it could be bonbons
people are only going to think of like
sweets
in that case and
[Music]
and I don't know
[Music]
it would be more more you are seeing I
mean unless you're happy I mean you had
the Lolly crew which is pretty much is
fantastic
[Music]
yeah I never have a kitten
[Music]
I know that words
I'll see if I can always do additional
adjustments
oh meow yeah yeah yeah
[Music]
oh pants that's a nice one
[Music]
so cute
do you like purple pants
could be
[Music]
people I want Force anything
I don't know it's hard enough yeah
make people like it
it seems like okay I guess we go with
the with the Powerpuff
[Music]
well thank you lolly for that suggestion
it was people like it so
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
makes sense
me
a cursor point is what
season times
this is silly
so yeah
but yeah yeah that's what what I was
going to say was
four pounds there you go
okay
be an opportunity to get some
all right
a fun funny modes
and you can and we can have like a fund
racing racer somehow somewhere
and you can also get to choose of course
yeah it makes sense what emotes
you would like to have in that case of
of pon pon of course that that would be
the requirement
but like yeah what what's the emotion
reactions and
be
if you contribute
[Music]
what is it called character
well not care sir but Carousel is cursor
at the last but at least like
reduced solution's cursor
Deidra telegram stickers
I shouldn't read with pie next to it
yesterday
what did telecast you could just be any
kind of sticky
another
oh yeah you did that yeah closer
question yeah oh it's character
a cursor yeah the last one is I was
wrong too
it has tickets that you can send the
people all between people like drawing
your own first so they used to stick it
so it's basically uh
I I kinda not
exactly cut the only thing I know about
stickers is like the convenience of
sending pictures but in the end aren't
aren't you isn't it basically like you
send me a picture
I don't think I've heard of telegram I
have to look into it but I yes it's the
same
would be
yeah it's very large emails I guess
that's a way to to describe it
I curse is someone who gives a lot of
people care language yeah that's true
like how I always use the k word
a few times
yeah I'd love to see what well but
what's on offshore and the results
[Music]
yeah yeah
[Music]
excited
trademarks at
500.
assassin down yeah that's
that makes sense I've thought about that
I did actually make one email to myself
it's ugly
is this one
which I did draw in the very weird the
1120
but um
but that's just 10 pounds larger than me
largest size
human she's cute it's the it's the uh
it's the star
this is thinking of something something
[Music]
and I don't know what she's thinking
oh
yeah because I had a friend who is an
artist
who I offered
I did offer a part of the actual first
payment from twitch
said it would be a delayed payment
he said that they would draw them
but
Miss
I guess he's just busy and I respect
that
I try not to be pushy so I haven't
really
foreign
when I did that have that
is that No it should be more
I'm experimenting
that's close right
maybe I did with 19.
a little bit
oh yeah I like that maybe
it's cute
[Music]
and that's
with your mysterious thoughts yeah
and then
and then of course because it's default
which
is the shaking version when she gets
something some emotions when emotions
get strong
and then it's the eyes and I love the
eyes but
I don't need to look at not to drop
oh my God how am I supposed to draw this
what what have I
actually made a doctor board cursor or
as I know it doesn't have any meaning
and people know you in cursor well it's
curse
but it's the ER ending of a curse so it
would be cursor someone who cares
I mean I I guess all the ER ending name
is made up
I'm a drawer
[Music]
oh is it called pon pon
[Music]
IES
yeah I'm going to
do something
I probably I probably do like a simple
ingredient
and then I add these shiny stuff on top
where's my there it is
and so
[Music]
and then that's that was moving
uh
someone who actually cast curses she's
called a hexer
casting
your curse casting
[Music]
yes sir
I'll give it a try
commit
uh
okay uh I'll do this
the magic of mirroring
maybe you could do that for real baby
there you go and then fill it
that's
now that I the emotion it may if I had
the eyebrows I I went on my library I
would do this one
maybe if I add more detail to it I can
as soon as I added character the emotion
is always
not what I expected to look like
so anyway continue in let's see if I can
do the
I want to try the gradient how do I do a
gradient in this software
um can
okay there is a
thing here
I can't
let's stress okay so now it works and
now
let's see
foreign
okay
if I look transparency
[Music]
oh it's also does the uh
whatever you call it
thank you for following
Don Mandy
hey papa hello
do you want to be called
don't manage that's it
quickly
it's a nice name
I like the flow of it
I mean it's a white Avengers
on my palate but
let's go
and then
adding the details in the eye
now I have it with a
[Music]
it doesn't have that glowing effect
because
I'm gonna do a star
[Music]
[Music]
ah with one key
[Music]
let's make this star a bit CK
a minute out
and then the [ __ ] I put inside a
separate language
yeah I should probably with everything
on different things here oh yeah even in
fullness
let's make that one for face
[Music]
maybe the heart is too big
[Music]
and nuts
[Music]
kind of disappeared
[Music]
yeah that's that's good
[Music]
and there's something more there but
it's a spot
no
[Music]
I'm happy with that
so
let's
let's put all this in one
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
and then
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
laughs
[Music]
genius yeah
[Music]
foreign
Swirls and it's
[Music]
the
that part done
but it is fun and we're here together
[Music]
yeah I guess we could also discuss the
whole day
emoting on this server
which yes as a a reminder for anyone I
don't know
yeah
uh yeah
everyone
people who have been here chatting and
wants to
chat when I'm not streaming
for example
[Music]
of more things
my new tedious Motions like this
actually cause pain to my arm I can't
explain how or what
it really feels like but it just goes
away oh
that's out here
[Music]
all right
try to think of something more to say
um
[Music]
[Music]
my body gets messed up by drawing all
over me
oh
yes I do feel I've been trying for quite
a while and I said my knee
patience but I've got to take breaks and
stretch and build them once yeah
this too I should have a bit more
regular drinks
that's right gotta become smallish
I need to
I guess that's the benefit of getting
extracted
unintended breaks
I'd say it's a kind of shooting pain
that I get mostly in my shoulder and
upper arm
trying to think
no nothing comes to mind
here here watching
and commenting that's I think that's the
best part and yeah because I'm
some people have been worried that they
do comment too much don't worry about
that
and
that's where if I distract get
distracted I did and that's on me
and that's it that's an active Choice by
myself
and it's always caused by smaller
emotions possible when the motion is in
the wrist
ah I see
small repetitive emotions with your
wrist
sorry that sorry
all right
[Music]
thank you sir six eight Works ER 16 all
right it's increment and send it in then
I start summer work at
on the on the fifth
oh that's less than a week
that's on Monday oh nice nice
the first
this is an adult channel here we make
adult jokes okay
no that's fine fine
I just I got it
103 and I got it and that means you
import it perfectly
adult jokes
it's 18 plus here
so I mean
we don't have to go graphic okay
innuendos
suggest it like
innuendos yeah basically
that's fine
[Music]
so that means carrot I mean I did
I did make
thank you
I did make a joke about a big carrot
before anyway
[Music]
let's um
like cookies by Chicos
sorry are we making the jokes oh no no
no Big Show is here no no not the single
one it's only talking about carrots
and then I guess
um peeling carrots using
small Rapids emotions anyway
I'm not sure what I'm drawing wait
where's the
fluff must be down here as well
[Music]
ever I've said ever it could be Eva as
well I don't remember when I said Eva I
didn't remember it was a plus
[Music]
going straight for it yeah I mean okay
addictions also
already so sick
[Music]
anyway
yeah I think my lines are inconsistent
with
another no I did this wrong
[Music]
[Music]
all right auntie
that behind the ears inside it
[Music]
okay I see except something here
[Music]
so that is wait what
[Music]
that's not what I wanted
[Music]
come on
foreign
[Music]
yeah I had to by the way to do that
[Music]
so
again what am I doing here
but that's the outside how this is the
inside I see okay now now I see what I'm
doing
[Music]
to move it over these and
I'm just hold the other one
[Music]
and this one I will
split
there we go
[Music]
okay so this I will change this color
nice
[Music]
it's almost like someone
it almost looks good
[Music]
it does
[Music]
[Music]
um pretend it's activating
[Music]
Okay so
and then I just do a gradient like this
hello
with that
[Music]
there we go
oh
my kittens
[Music]
Meredith
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
let's add the fill
that's not the fill button this is
[Music]
the ingredients is somewhere here
[Music]
being picky again
[Music]
wait this should also
[Music]
need to bring up this and
[Music]
so this is the
that's going to be heated anyway
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
failey filled
there you go
and then there's the gradient part
foreign
[Music]
guys
[Music]
starts
it's dusty
basically just start to somewhere down
there okay
laughs
foreign
[Music]
what are we talking about
[Music]
the steam elements did change how he was
oh yeah yeah yeah but for some reason it
doesn't work for all of them
and the uh yes
on screen it's uh I use the two emoji
but apparently it doesn't work because
you're supposed to be able to do like
like this and it's erased it just like
if you have sent an image and show it in
big
but for some reason it does not raise
the carrot as an emoji and I think
that's on Twitch not
uh no I'm not on Twitter problems it
probably both on Switching stream
elements and so it does not render the
heart as a m
Emoji it's really a text
and it's complicated it
[Music]
thank you
okay
[Music]
um
[Music]
they're really starting down here
[Music]
I'm now on 3K care points I might have
had 5K if I didn't put clothes change it
yeah spending everything on cleanse
changes you have to work as a team
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
statistics
[Music]
I think I have made the decision to suck
a student oh
[Music]
whoops
well that's that's nice but I guess one
that's the third decision
yeah that's that's a nice one
and I can see why people like this
oh yeah and then
yeah
color of the body is pure white okay
well in that
well I should do the gradients Not Fade
to the different color I should really
have it fade to transparent
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
there we go that's what I wanted
now it faced to transparent
[Music]
okay I need a bit different color on the
background
[Music]
something that's nothing I hurting
[Music]
that I can sink
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
such a nice
yeah I need a yeah that should
definitely be a thing
on with a heart
with a realistic looking heart because
that's the
to represent the attention of details
[Music]
but like
it's based on a real heart
not the hardship
[Music]
that sounds like the pumpkin thing to do
this but with the heart hurling
I was taking fast shaking things up
yeah I guess I guess
but if I don't have shaking as an emote
I could spend put a more static ones
to the free image let's
speak
to the to the animated but let's have
more static ones
sorry
[Music]
actually starting to look good
because yeah it would be more fun to
have a larger
more emotes to use than just animated
although I mean
there are those who have like
okay yes it's fair it's fair that's some
some div actually have
emotes that are unique that are animated
that are not the same as the static ones
[Music]
and so so that's still possible today
[Music]
I think do you know you can explain
myself by the way yeah yeah I do
but that doesn't work on mobile unless
you're winning to install a
third party Twitch app which is probably
more expensive than the
Rich selfie
yeah and I have like half the views on
mobile and I don't want them to like
this and and even if people are on
desktop I don't want to like suggest
people to install the extensions
[Music]
and also I would like to just install an
extension if I'm going to install an
extension to add these access to these
emotes I just want the emails nothing
else but all of these Extensions by
trying to be better than the other
extension they're adding so much other
stuff that I don't want
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
yeah yeah that's what I want
to see what she said
I saw a bunch of pink yeah
and the pink Spilled Out
so
yeah and then
okay so this should be a bit there okay
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
I need to add the gradient
[Music]
for the
lightest pinch
[Music]
it is a nice pink color
[Music]
I like pink and bunnies with pinkies
it's nice
[Music]
okay
[Music]
questions
so gradient
[Music]
it's going to be from
the bottom
[Music]
out of my app or something like that
don't like that
foreign
take off the outfit
but it's not allowed to have cleared son
and after this channel
is wants to take off my glance
and then
it's a [ __ ] how does that work from the
side
rosy cheeks
foreign
this would be like
these two buckets
it's very soft
except is so nice
yeah soft gradient stuffed very
everything is soft
we live
we seek out the softness
[Music]
the last name of the whole head we don't
need headset
[Music]
okay fluffy and soft yeah
[Music]
so
um
I feel like I got in quite far already
like this is quite good
yeah so um
[Music]
in a difficult kind of tired so I feel
kind of
I feel like
I feel like I want to go eat and
and
if I feel like I don't I'm done
I'm done streaming
okay
no head ah you don't see the gate suffer
I think yeah I feel like
yeah indeed like the almost like what
you call it the pre outline I don't
think disturb that and then I've done
the
proper outline in 24 what I had the news
for Lolly Safari
so next is the body and the
and I guess I'll do some fun fun
maybe I should do a bunny first
so I see what part of Japan actually I
have to do
[Music]
I know that cavitated
yeah
six hours a great streaming time

streamers I watched here

[Music]
and he's
playing one arm
book I did not know when he started I
just don't know if it's going to stop me
I should probably shake that first
where is he going
how do you see how long someone has been
screening for
I didn't get one and a half hours yeah
that's fine he will be going forward
I probably watched this stream when I
make myself some food
why I sent that message
um
yeah it didn't show it under this mother
window I want to have one screen I don't
have so much real estate
