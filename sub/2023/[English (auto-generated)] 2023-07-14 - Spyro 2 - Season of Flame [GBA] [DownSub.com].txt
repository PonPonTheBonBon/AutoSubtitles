there's already an improvements
Denmark iron

inside
[Music]
nice oh Bianca
according to my spell book if these
powder Gates should temporarily and make
your eyes spread even more powerful than
it is now you should then be able to
freeze patches of shallow water for a
short time just make sure you're not
standing on the ice when it melts oh by
the way here's another five by 40 I

ability on them to get butterflies that
would improve your health or even earn
you extra lives oh look at this pretty
glowing Rock I found hey it's been away

[Music]
I think it's in some kids some bad
[Music]
are you captured smoked me
that she is there and uh
[Music]
all right you don't get any gems

sincere vacation Spyro yeah it was on
the speedway let's practice jumping

six previous games

right now this comment came out

yeah
[Music]
let's try a really hard one
do you want the long one you want the
hard one
thing
press the A Button near the end of your
Glide to have a little hovering you can
give you a bit of existence when you
need it
let's
[Music]
finish
that was awesome you're more than ready
to take on some rhinox now or hey upon
this little bug due to a while ago when
you need to tell me
you can have it if you want chili cheese
planning a hole in my pocket my pocket
oh how I wasn't kidding oh you did burn
yourself through your skin or something
is that really
yes voices at 25 that's not what 25
looks like
23 pounds but I'll get back there
where's the fireplace
you catch it magma
which bird that holds you Hunter's skin
in pocket
because that's about something he has
and I mean I didn't make that happening
[Music]
[Applause]
and I'm not sure if I oh it's expensive
okay so this game actually allows you to
lie over the water the previous game
reset the immunity
14.
I
enjoyed the boys
yeah I just need to establish some
license
for Sheila yes I like Sheena
no not
that's money bags
damn right nice have stolen heaps of
games from me main Spectrum I don't know
how to tune Australians
and now this
black hearts won't let me get them back
back up what is the backwards
ah Spyro isn't it funny My Little pepper
friend I will always seem to run into
each other but with me in a position to
do so much good for you
you're a bouncy little friend here I'll
be more than happy to let her pursue her
12 mentors for shall we say 500 gyms
pay favorite gemstone yeah why not okay
I'll just wait a minute you don't have
enough gems sorry spiral you you'll just
have to find more gyms if you want my
help
in since the first game and possibly the
only game where hamster and hunting
money Banks doesn't know how much games
you have
don't let me
know this is changing apparently I have
to pass
then check tomorrow
what's with the Bianca and Hunter faces
is it I have to oh it's still once I get
the firefight from so they show me
movies
that's actually pretty previous one
and that's the game it's awesome and I
assume that's the three bosses and of
course
we're heading it back yes
this is the press button and this is
something with me
I'm glad you like them
wow that ship explodes it I didn't
expect that
exploding sheep
well I guess I'm
Fallout and down here you can do this
level
s
[Music]
well it is the Game Boy Advance
game save complete Treasures found 217
so I assume that is like 30 more I have
to print
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
uh realm index which is Amazon gaming or
because I press these buttons which it
already existing
so there's a total of 100 I think so
this one is three months then
I need to know that
you can give me that information that
way
and also this game has a
[Music]
flops
[Music]
well over the cute little dragon I wish
my poor sister didn't see what you need
to see this this
night and now I feel that I'll never see
her again wouldn't be willing to help me
find her and also another difference I'm
not looking at the other boxes is that
it moves two lines not three lines
[Music]
which does help everything
if you capture well
well this is a geography
thickness explosive ships because I have
to charge your cheeks anyway what's the
point though
okay okay oh it does explodes why does
everything explode here
why is this it beats even
[Music]
point I mean
wait a minute I know what's going on
I know what's going on if I press this
select button
I assume I'm going to unlock the fire
breaths at some point and then I have to
go back and fire it those things
oh no by checking
[Applause]
[Music]
running in second
oh yeah
fire fans
[Music]
I can't guess it he's easy too come on
spider
what's this why this animation so long
what what can I press
that's a sick shadow
you fell into the water
how much does this reset when you die
probably go get back to the store to
keep the gems
the characters don't speak to your
animals it's cute
but can I speak French again okay I know
I can't I just have to get away anything
else I think that that is an improvement
oh
I mean I would say that they definitely
happened to this point
I always take controls season of ice
machine
[Music]
sometimes
[Music]
sometimes
if you look at this [ __ ]
sometimes it moves because if I'm not
mistaken the the game the way a Game Boy
works and the same on like NES and stuff
is that they have a background
there and then they have a Sprite layer
and the background layer in the camera
freely but in that case they also need
to move so technically when spider is
moving
he's actually kind of is mostly static
on the screen which is why yeah that's
why they don't want to move the camera
in the first season of eyes because it's
annoying they want they the position of
spine is locked it's only the background
scrolling
but if they want this camera to move
like this as I walk around they have to
also move spiral and then also take into
consideration that spider's position has
changed
that which is not the case in Cincinnati
if I understand the
developments how you develop
I'm just killed stuff on the Gameboy
I could be wrong
which explains why they decided not
stimulus spider you kept shock unless
you press the look around button but in
that case a spider isn't moving I mean
okay his Sprite position is changing but
you hadn't you don't have to do any
recalculations for
uh collisions or anything like that
which is also explains why
he must stand absolutely still before he
can start moving the camera
in that game
passive costume helmet
now I've had been one of your Friday
meetings yeah I guess that's a good
meaning please help me that horrible
Rhino is keeping me here against my will
my system must be worth sick about me
now
oh wow
from me
okay
stop doing this
all right
these enemies
I'm preparing thank you thank you that
running was the scariest thing I ever
seen I haven't visited I got away from
them I don't have anything to repay with
but maybe you like this sparkly gem I
found while I was hiding wait that's not
gem it just flew away
[Music]
that's better I finally find a section
in my spam book about the fireplace
hold still for a minute
oh an amazing thing
another animation
yeah you should have your five breast
back oh thank you
I just stand back man you give it a try
hey thanks Bianca now all we have to do
is go back and come we say spend on all
of the answers
and I'll need a lot more fireflies
before I can do that and besides we got
to stop whoever is behind this order we
are steal them but
them at all again
you're right oh wait how will I capture
fireflies with my mind's Prince
you should still have your ice breath I
don't think my spell you can't sing away
[Music]
you select the second three available in
front of your inspired haircut or
anything like that
[Music]
I'm one step ahead of you
and please find do you have any friends
in space thanks to Parenting yeah I
should see if I can burn those things
you captured Flash
[Music]
Flash
that's
right
that's what fun fun with it
thanks for asking
so now yeah there we go
why why does it still have connection
s
oh I need I need to find all the needles
in the Haystacks see
thank you
how does that point
[Music]
suddenly not every language has the
expression media and I think
to be captured
[Music]
I need that makes questions
all right what's that a spoon
yes
it makes more sense or a fairy is this a
checkpoint remember anything
[Music]
I do have the mods for reignited but you
can burn NPCs
specific ones he captured part I should
do more of those and then I should do a
let's play of the game where I
use it
and show it up Pokemon
I mean when what is it running something
trust me I know
[Music]
what's happening
it looks better there's a key I bet we
find the chest the cuts with it we'll
get lots of gems most ones have a key
and chest so keep an eye out for them
that's that's the minimum
if you remember
it's a fairy oh it seem to pay yet close
enough to use them and they'll remember
your progress for dinner level
see her she uses heat they use this
thing down
I think he has been referred to all fans
that way you won't have to start over if
you get into any trouble with those
nasty Rhino yeah what a concept
a crazy concept
why didn't anyone think about that
before
[Music]
bloody scarecrows
what's with this character I'm still not
bloody
they just
and now I'm gonna be
I don't know my dress
I have seen she found somebody in expert
too it's definitely not a thing they do
oh well in that case
I have witnesses weakness I have more
people confirming that if it's true
next this time it doesn't disappear and
it's not there are trees
where is the other is the other one
let me guess the last one has uh
this morning
[Music]
uh the way it just flies when it's birds
so beautiful I love it
bye
mistakes why are you staying at me
making I guess or it's not just an
interactive certainly definitely the
girl is the Battle of them
exactly it's just not oh it is a fun
thing you do you don't get anything from
itself
foreign
[Music]
no
boy
[Music]
yeah
I don't know if it resets
can I get another checkpoint like
is that enough
what do you think
that one
okay I got all of these things haven't
they
since hey the challenge portal I bet we
can find some fireflies in there but
have some fun too
I'm
guessing spice please two oh there it is
you captured skull
no and then I guess let's do the
challenge then
oh it's more of the lemon
it's a challenge
[Music]
you little dragon is there any way you
can help me
with what I'm going to keep all this
milk cold until my sister Polly comes to
take it to Market but it's such a hot
day I don't think it's going to make it
I guess I'll give you a try
wait let's go
[Music]
oh there are times something
for how long
this is
fresh when it gets to Market thank you
so much for your help little dragon
it's a turkey enough for your decision
please take this clever and see I bought
at at my foot that thing is
I'm going on
you capture clean sun and I got off
you got all the your card the last five
on these levels final good work I don't
even remember this is the point
[Music]
that the last 70 gems on this level
spider way to go
[Applause]
I think
[Music]
at least this level is broken it's not
like from Philippines or instant death
cells
now it just it still has seen some best
sound I really wish they didn't like
they treated water as fire
but
a gym
keeping freak is hiding in the panipara
[Music]
so where that meat come from is there as
well because then there are no no
because around
when from the anthropic cows obviously
so I assume with fire I use it on these
yeah
and then give me uh
[Applause]
[Music]
at least I got the yeah my recipe early
in the game
thank you
[Music]
yeah that was actually pretty nice
looking thing
oh dragon look at what what I can I have
fire
a piece with spiral the dragon Rams are
fading
uh no comment on my timers
Owen why are more of these things
so this is only four that's it
oh it gives me a new
so I can I can use drag irregular eyes
and I can switch you
how is my eyes okay
it has an interesting way of doing the
game I guess
is it kind of weird that it doesn't
replace the eyes with the powerful eyes
to me that would make sense because it's
just an important place and I have to go
through less options firstly you don't
confuse players with bike doesn't my
eyes free still working anymore
now because you have the wrong eyes
selected
I got enough chance for the scene 11.
so much nicer there as you can see where
I'm going by um much safer than running
this game
again I forgot to count these
that's the last of the gemstone this
level Inspire way to go wait do you have
to say that everything
I'll say that next time
[Music]
you captured tracer
you caught in us the last place by a
good work
yes but it's just I won't be that next
thing that that was the last time I read
that message
so where's the Sheila level where did I
put that
go somewhere around here
not bad
not bad
this was the start
look I can jump over the water I'm gonna
do that in previous thing
not in the homework this is
right yeah it's kind of honest
I can
all right
I've lost 11.
okay you can actually get a locked up
and five size
seriously
[Applause]
because it wasn't this side it was not
on the side
I think
[Applause]
we have this run around
him again
hey
let me see the same now
I don't blame you Spyro I believe gems
are much more important than friendship
I'll have to keep my eye on me so soon
you'll be more money hungry than even my
sin
hmm
I mean sometimes
I don't even speaks
all right thanks soon
I guess you can't speak to characters
I thank you so very much it helped me
not so many displeasure to do business
with you I hope to see you again very
soon
so what do you have to say now Sheena
let me in the spiral I want to get me
gems back
I want to get me gems back Waits is she
Irish
[Music]
I want to get me James back yeah yes why

[ __ ] I just walk in
she has traveled please
this is The Shield 11 now
this is
bags I didn't know did you come see the
portal with me
wow what's going on here
I was trying to really even up the side
of the canyon with some flowers but that
was dodgy during that except trampled on
my ceiling
we need to get them growing again before
they complete the one
and that's something
[Music]
no
[Music]
it's
it's a screen-based level
interesting they did something
interesting
this steep incline
is it an inside this second one easy
mate
to top jump I press the heat button to
jump then hit the a button again while
in the air
doesn't really weird thing to see you
know
[Music]
and that's not a part are you going to
get the flower growing
I just have to give that product good
and cracking Stone the stamp I do a
double jump then hit the beef that's
funny there
again I'm very very safe the same
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
of course
[Music]
like that other than bunny bunny
[Music]
[Music]
okay so this game is actually doing I
can't feel good uh
left
up right down
but you
I
you can also PlayStation
buttons
[Music]
quite at the same time
maybe it's pretty sometimes
it's a weird way to making girl
I must say
[Music]
I can't get a coin you can get up there
and then I can get something
[Music]
[Music]
it's an interesting season 11 it works
[Music]
an unlike spider 3 this is basically not
just a tutorial level it's actually a
full full level and it might be more
Cedar levels I'm experience
that was meant to be his annoying I'm
spicy which I mentioned one sometimes
before
power
you basically only had one Sheila lemon
and it's a tutorial
s they have no sugar levels
and that goes for all of the creatures
in that thing
[Music]
all right bonus I mean
where's this back Zone
I couldn't tell the difference this
might just be the exit button actually
it says sunny things but I definitely
okay
let's go in with sports fire instead
I didn't collect everything
I need to collect everything if I need
different
but at least when you go to the air
class it does the current 11.
this one or five things now
just a single one
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
the three little acid
[Music]
wait that did that one it died
because
if you jump into them they don't die

this button doesn't do anything
all right the game didn't teach me what
I should do in this area anyway
[Music]
if only there was a thing that didn't
require me to walk
all the way back to this area I don't
know some form of checkpoints Maybe
squishy sounds

you captured scotch
thank you all right this is because the
Scottish apparently
I mean
[Music]
geographically yeah
but it's certainly accurate
these people confusing
Irish and Scottish just like how they
would confuse Swedish and Norwegian
there are differences
but for people I'm not familiar
foreign
[Music]
because you know I'm not that
experiences
in English it's in angular stuff I might
say not specifically in English
