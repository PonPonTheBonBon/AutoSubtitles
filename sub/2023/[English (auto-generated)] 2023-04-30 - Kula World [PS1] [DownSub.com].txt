[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
volume
level for subscribing it's
[Music]
it's I don't know how to thank you
perfectly
but now this the notification on the
chat is also working properly
[Music]
but it didn't play last time
there we go actually yeah it came out it
was a bit loud
[Music]
and also
came back you thinking note I guess is
that
I don't hear exactly how it's outputed
by the way a lot of I'm messing around
and actually need to perish it
yeah I did not play this level before
last time so this should be
40 levels left but these levels will be
another variant of this
but this level should be longer
I would probably make more mistakes
[Music]
oh yeah this is the reverse
I mean you don't see the platforms
yeah ready for a lot of mistakes now
what's this
something there
okay oh what is this
nothing
[Music]
so
um
[Music]
two armed classes here in the corner
I got all the keys
it reminds me of this one Amiga ball
game
and my uncle let me play on all the mega
game
when I was young
yeah
I have no experience with any Amiga
games sadly
yeah
are there any like
[Music]
once I should play
my preferred ideas
okay
now I just need to get back
that's not how we get
next without a game like this called
Megan Marvel
[Music]
Captain Morgan
I need to remember which path I'll take
[Music]
and get back okay now remember
let's just take the key and go home
now
because there are two of these I can
actually do this
with me back a bit of time
just look at
enough of coins every day okay
yeah that's enough but
that fashion move all over here
and now I came over here
[Music]
look out I don't know if you can jump
over there
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
get to the exits okay hopefully nothing
feel complicated nowadays let's
invisible platform please
and I'll go back my phone is to updated
[Music]
[Music]
what am I supposed to have a bad thing
[Music]
tonight
I like that
and maybe not like that
I think I
[Music]
that's where I was
like I know how to do this
like this
there we go
sunglasses makes you see in the cannot
do I get points for picking this up
okay
[Music]
pick up all the
sunglasses and happy Sunday hello
nice to see you here again
and now for some
weird ball game if I need to get a lot
of puzzle team here
eyes after this sign even
while I do have the sunglasses over
there so yes
[Music]
I was supposed to go back on that thing
oh okay
[Music]
I'm back at first time but I don't know
why
[Music]
it's very simple bananas
but teleporters
with enemies too
anywhere else
[Music]
okay can I stop defending this thing
thank you
hey what's this
[Music]
out
yeah that's how we have now
I don't know
[Music]
if I need to get back all the way
[Music]
come on
I don't have time
these things
[Music]
as next one I think that time I can't
even okay the enemies could have a nice
city that didn't give us
[Music]
friend
all right a minute
[Music]
oh yeah I see
[Music]
okay
there's some coins and there's nothing
but no
okay
there
that's not how you do it
[Music]
okay so that's one complaces or
platforms okay
let's see what's going on here
and now I'm on the other side
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay I need to
I need to use my brain for this one
Manchester from there but what I can do
is probably up there okay that's
probably how I said she lives sorry
[Music]
oh
that's a little mistake
[Music]
yeah I think I think I might because
supposed to jump
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
okay
yeah from here all right sorry
[Music]
okay and then I just jumped down here
yeah that's how I did
[Music]
okay I did it
thank you
after he attempts
oh
I don't know what what is this
[Music]
oh oh no what is this
timing too
then I got back
okay
[Music]
of course of course which I've seen that
coming
[Music]
calcium simply from that thing
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
messing around can't I just do this no
it was going to bounce that
wait it's just this simple no oh
[Music]
if I do
I do
I found the solution
[Music]
or accidentally stumbled up on the
selection yes
some wild jumps
numb okay
what's that
another quarter
[Music]
let's see
[Music]
[Music]
I guess the teleporter would take you
too
[Music]
thank you
no I have no idea what the points right
now
I mean I'd have to point out the
teleporters
okay let's go today
[Music]
down and she just pick up my points for
instance have
is having some points just to be in
there
as I'm running out smile
and I'm starting to like give me a text
in the levels
okay as far as I can see two steps so I
could jump but in that case I'll just
paint
all right I see I see myself okay
thank you
that's worse to go in that case let's
use this
oh I should get to this my text
fantastic
the text doesn't make me smile
[Music]
um
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
like to write stuff on apparently
money no money
give me the money
nope I can turn around on the other side
otherwise it's going to be annoying
[Music]
wow
and then I can't read this question
there is one there's money on the money
perfect
[Music]
oh
[Music]
I found it I found it through Tuesday
pool now I found the key as well
I'm coming for you fool
thumbs up
maybe I am the food
[Music]
oh no I am
but now I've been fooled
nah
I was soon
[Music]
okay one more time
what is the ultimate movements for
yeah I need to find a way to turn around
thank you
all right I'm fine I'll wait there I
must be able to do something
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
so actually used to have gone back I
didn't even need to go to the Texas
first place oh well
I got the
secret exit so here's the fool here
[Music]
seven
[Music]
Hank I have a Marvin like that one
and after this special level here is a
bonus lemon
you have like a
because that one was quite soft
so I wasn't
perfect
why did I do that
but I wouldn't oh yeah I'm supposed to
be on the other side of this thing
thank you
like this
[Music]
this looks like
[Music]
yeah I can I can do this
because I can just jump down here
[Music]
anyway
another stuff okay let's do it
I'll take the extra
good point
let's go to the next world
and this and this and here's another
type of level where
you have a lot though
a lot of blocks together okay if I go
there I'm going to die I assume so I
need to go here
and not like that oh there's an egg is
down there
[Music]
okay that's how I do it
and here is this one
and I think that's all
I did the first first level of that
world
could be a bit nice
that's
[Music]
how do I continue on this thing
thank you
I wasn't meant to pick that one up
[Music]
in fact I can't beat that one up that's
foreign
[Music]
let's see how should I do so if I go on
that side hopefully there's no error
there I can jump down and die and
and jumping around on this block should
be easy
Midway
[Music]
and then here
here without picking that peel don't
pick up strange pills that's what this
game is teaching you I'm using a key
[Music]
don't pick up any random strange pills
you can pick up certain strange ones
okay where is the key
that's
no it's there in the air
okay I can get it
yeah it's there
right
now I need to get to the goat
in 40 seconds
oh like this
okay
back to normalish levels
I shouldn't pick up as much
internships
that would be my thumbprot
and oh wait not to pick up brushes and
don't realize I made a mistake but I can
get from here
okay let's stretcher
[Music]
and blessed
oh yeah oh yeah
this is how she did
think
[Music]
I
think this is great yes
[Music]
and that that moves down far enough good
so
I guess keep them will be back
in the moment
this is already back
I thought it was classic I like it
[Music]
yeah
I'm happy for solving the level but I
have not sold it now
and now
oh no
I feel completely forgot to pick up the
first key and now I'm not even sure if
I'm going to get back there
and I have the solution now all right
here it is
[Music]
wait a minute how am I supposed to get
back now
if I get to this key I can't get back I
need to somehow
remove
these things somehow
okay
I think they have an idea
[Music]
but the idea might not work
[Music]
I want to come back from the distance
somehow
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
he kept the rest of the stuff
now I can't go back
last time either had a phone up they
took about two hours oh why did he have
to after his now I mean
I mean I can't speak to him right now
I'm pretty sure you can wait with
updates like something after the stream
or something but sure
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
that's why some more time
I don't get points for it but
[Music]
yeah I cannot get back to that so I
should have picked up those the first
thing I did
oh well
I can get to the girl now at least
no Hidden Treasures
it's a cute amount you know this is a
tiny little
everything
one time with these things
a different part
okay
if I think I needed that
thank you
[Music]
I just wanted to get a bit hot
oh yeah okay okay okay
I remember I remember
I don't think I need it
okay let's do this
okay
that's this Edition
it's a bounce in there
I don't think I need it
I actually think the bounce beans are
trapped
[Music]
okay
and here I can pick up dresses without
really risky
I might have messed up that thing
no
I don't see our way back
oh wait I found a way back
that's why you don't just give up
[Music]
I imagine doing it
[Music]
I should be happy with that
oh but I'll never like this again
this time
very big
oh
[Music]
yeah I should be able to do three months
okay that's the go and that's not fresh
again now
I love to run my circular aren't they
I
I don't know
to come
I don't know about randomizer
that sounds interesting
[Music]
oh it's nice to see new people
okay
not a randomizing working it's it's
someone needs to randomize the level
that you still can complete
I was going to say and it's generous
something else in complete multiple
otherwise but that's true for existing
lemon cells as well
foreign
[Music]
okay now I should plan my way back which
I should do like that
I think uh
pass back is easy
watch this I do have an additional
Progressive
thank you
[Music]
only thing I don't like is the setup for
it it's too long to run the rest yeah I
could I've never done that but I could
imagine it being
I would like to try I just need the
boxes they had to set it up I don't mind
[Music]
I've set up quite a lot of stuff
okay
[Music]
this isn't this part this is
[Music]
really want to do the final levels in
this game it's
it's beyond my capability my kids not
maybe I will be able to do them
[Music]
that's not the most exciting gameplay
watch either
okay
something
no I cannot take that
just left one hourglass behind
my fan and lost most of this point so
it's much from that level
here 11.
Mark myself without just stop collecting
everything
[Music]
[Music]
in this hot stuff
okay here's the girl at least
get that one
[Music]
that's the last ones I need to
come on get out of that farm
[Music]
show my paper Duty from the backside of
that one but the question is how do I
get to the back side of it yeah
foreign
option here
yeah I can't also use this here this is
part of the game
it's of course spinning and everything
so it doesn't make it too easy okay I
could do it on the same side as the girl
on that thing to jump down that seems
much easier
that seems to be the actual solution
so and now time to just move around and
then I get that side I guess I had this
think wait how am I supposed to
yeah on top of this thing
I don't think I can get on top of this
that much for that solution
um
time again
[Music]
yeah I don't think you can get
okay okay
now I see how I can get it over and
that's the solution is right in front of
me
[Music]
I just need I just need all the time I
can get so hydration time
[Music]
three two one heads
and then there's arrows in this thing
[Music]
time to collect it as much as I can
[Music]
I want this stuff I need this stuff
give me all the gems
and coins
because I guess into the girl is pretty
simple
[Music]
oh that sounds yeah
[Music]
yeah exactly this is
a Canon either way
[Music]
if I move around enough I I I'll find it
eventually
like your first
first maybe I should because I want to
act I need to activate the but I need
The Hourglass
okay
I still need hourglass
okay
um so I want to activate another part
there but I also don't activate the red
one
maybe if I just do one at a time
that seems like a better idea
and then I jump back
this button is a bit broken
but don't pick up gems
I really want them
oh yeah instead of just putting two of
these on the other side you just put
spikes
[Music]
okay
how do I get back
there's an attitude button before I oh
yeah maybe I just do this
[Music]
I think I get
easy
[Music]
oh yeah
that's how it is
[Music]
okay I can be sure there was one there
but I take the risk
thank you
all right I can whoa
[Music]
that was actually
I had to think a lot about my new stuff
and I and they are invisible
stressfully yeah and the invisible block
I just assumed it was one that I didn't
I did not remember this level
and then I just had to think think very
quickly there then
yeah
it was it was stressful
okay
pick it up
bye
this game makes fun but I like it
yeah that's kind of why I don't want to
do the final levels
because
those levels
do make my brain hurt
more than I mean
this is this is some good
mental
[Music]
okay I'm not even sure am I you know
supposed to get away from this
[Music]
okay let's do something
okay
[Music]
now that this doesn't work
how was this good part ah
now I still lose it
yeah
I guess no because I can use that
bounces in but nothing can help me
anything let me press this button
[Music]
all right that was supposed to be on the
other side
okay okay
[Music]
okay yeah okay
okay
[Music]
I have can on the side
all right okay
[Music]
[Music]
I think I was supposed to stop on the
second one
[Music]
yeah I know how I have it figured out
[Music]
that's the first key
second key
let me press the correct button this
time and then I'll just ask for it
I get the fruits and then I still jump
back and back together
all right easy
on uh these blocks
Anna
okay
um I have floating fruits
okay so I need to start
[Music]
this is just timing
[Music]
[Music]
okay I don't know what else but the
point of numbers
jump jump around a bit
[Music]
oh oh okay
[Music]
[Music]
give me the fruit but this kitchen code
nothing that's the point of the fruit
[Music]
effective bonus allowance
there's enough of jumping on the side
[Music]
ah not the bouncing thing another trip
okay
[Music]
oh I need the bouncy thing
just a trick I don't need to bounce
thing with other things
[Music]
well I could use the bounces in for
those things but
no because I don't have
I don't have any time let's just use the
balancing for those things
this should be a way to get to the other
side learning on this without using the
bounce again
you actually can get the treasures
now I just want to look at the level a
bit more to just see if there is another
way because if there was a block on top
of it so I can collide with I could fall
down onto them
but because I can only stand on the
outside and jump down
I don't see any way no
effect and fine insulation
I don't think they would put them there
those there if it wasn't a solution
to get them or maybe maybe there isn't
the solution then just put them that
just tease me with
I don't feel like they are the that kind
of
well wait no that that was the thing
I had it
no I could do that as well because maybe
both Works wait I'm supposed to get the
boyfriend
[Music]
oh that's how it fits
and look down a lot
playing this game
right on the farm I need to make sure I
can do this
I'm probably gonna like for now having
fun yeah
and I need to find my words
and
have fun
I don't need what I don't know what to
say
if you still like comments
or something it's funny
I need it because it was funny
yeah yeah
I think so
yay
I'm out have I messed this up
no I messed this up
now
and now
I got I don't see us now now why did I
do that
I just wanted the fruits and now
I did that
okay I know what not to do this time
but this time I will soak it
thank you
maybe maybe that other thing I was gonna
the the center Station
it might not be possible today
well and this time I will not make a
mistake
[Music]
thank you
and now I can actually read it again
that's why I did
and that's it
[Music]
I just should have done from the start
of course
there's the key
[Music]
all right
I should account for the fridge first
because these things would bounce me off
Ellen
[Music]
[Music]
what's the point of this
okay I can't go there
there I mean all I can but I need to
all right no that thing is Bounce
everything
all right maybe if I
[Music]
don't think any land on the correct one
if I jumped down from there
irritating the correct direction
there we go now you're upside down I
can't see anything
okay if I jump on
[Music]
can I keep it a bit more empty so I can
actually see what I'm doing
that much
I think I think I'm supposed to do that
look correct
which one is it now
it's the first one okay let's see if I
can do this
I couldn't do it
um
foreign
making mistakes
yeah this way and then this way
yeah I think yeah exactly that works
all right that's it I should pick up the
key
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
first I need to pick up that keep
then
I can do this stuff
[Music]
[Music]
another again okay keep forgetting this
to you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
secret bouncer pad oh secret fruit
s
and I can get the keys
then
[Music]
a nice and easy level for us
[Music]
I'm back Hello Kitty
welcome back
timing for that update
[Music]
you have
not missed anything important I guess
every time I've lost
it's sorry I was gone no don't be sorry
is fine
I mean I don't
think you have to make the updates but
pretty sure you can delay it a bit but
but
perfect
this way
you're so kind it's
I mean you you choose what do you want
to do that's all I've seen
[Music]
I don't think I was supposed to be on
this side obviously
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
too many
there okay you can actually have
okay this is
[Music]
and that's the other key
and now I need to get to the girl
I'm hot
can I jump down there no that's
certainly too far
yeah I can see that by that yeah it's
tick tock right I just can just do this
I'm getting ready to go I see the girls
rush to the guild I found Guild
the update goes I found that kind of
stuff Oh I thought you had to go for me
next world
oh very lazy hydration time
how about this music
oh
do you want you want
do you want this outfit number that
outfit
you do that
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
the other key
another really stand up
[Music]
[Music]
oh yeah then I can get
pressing that button
foreign
there we go
[Music]
it's Mage lemon okay
my sister it was a strange level and
this is another strange flower
ready
I did a knot
you suspense
okay
okay
nice change
they can actually pick up stuff without
worrying about losing
this health
[Music]
game is really cool it's
I guess I mean
yeah if it's your type of game it can be
fun and I do like it for because
souls are quite different but when I try
to look at puzzle games a lot of games
are very
of course they are I know they are like
different puzzle games but it's hard to
find
all right
this doesn't seem too damn much for me
[Music]
[Music]
okay there's a key
oops
it's nice for a PS1 game
it's a typical happiest one game where
you have blocks
oops
thank you
okay I should not get on that one
foreign
yes one wait more bugs
blocks like Minecraft it's a
there's a fruit there but I'm not sure
I'm supposed to pick it up
[Music]
I can't see much from here
[Music]
I can jump straight down to here
okay
um
continue being silly
okay I'm just being sitting at the
moment
okay this is how you do it
which I can just stick it back together
with this and uh
that just happened to be the solution
I do a lot of guessing
but I guess that part of the
mining solution
okay there's a fruit
I can't jump down like that because I
don't have anything land on although I
can do this
[Music]
and stems
where I can get to keep this way
and I can't get this key this way
and I cannot get that
so yeah I do want
I would like
basically a puzzle game that comes up
with that concept like I like this once
again for example how you walk around on
the cubes and as you go around the
corner
and you've changed which direction is
the gravity
by my grandmother
I think I can get the key but how am I
supposed to get from the key
[Music]
that's enough
oh hello
okay
[Music]
yeah I can get to the key but I can't
get from the key
thank you
[Music]
and I can't find it Well while it is
possible for through the key and pick it
up I don't see any
way to actually
just home
the Caps that way
if I do need teaching
wait I have ice I'm stupid
I am stupid
let's read message first I think
I mean Mega
marble for the Xbox this is it much like
that but it's a hard game to play
that's true
some games can be tricky
where I go perfect
I wanted
because it's around it doesn't show up
yes
it does not
what I find is
horrible blast
Marble Madness
sweet 16.
maybe it was called Mega Marble in some
recent regions
but no that doesn't seem to be a Mexican
that doesn't seem to be what
about the same thing that's more like a
monkey balls what's it called monkey
balls
okay yeah
see what they can find
that that takes yesterday again when you
control and ball and move it around on
3D surface of course but
it just seems to be you don't seem to
control the gravity
in that sense
it doesn't seem to be
it doesn't seem to be a type of puzzle
game so it looks me to be an action
maybe not action but more like a
platformer but with a marble
this I wouldn't recall a platform and
this is where a person came
welcome
I am doing
well I do need more to drink
do you know where this is a Swedish game
it is a Swedish game
by a company called Sweden because they
were very creative with their name
[Music]
okay
I'm gonna feel that way
oopsie
hello hello
that was not the correct way
[Music]
there's a fruit here
I need to pay attention
keys are there
okay yeah this is
and that looks to be a plasma computer
too yeah because it was Ice
oh yeah yeah this works
I should have picked up the diamonds
again
come out this level seems instead of the
previous levels
sad face
all right
yeah yeah
speaking of easy
[Music]
a couple hour yeah this one actually
that was too easy but
yeah I need to get this
yeah and then I did this
I told you that okay this one is
actually
we have that time yeah
it takes more like a
platform
yeah
in my opinion well yeah yeah I don't
really want I know why it's why it's
called marble when you play as a beach
ball
down in Swedish
it's so smart
and welcome to the smart people Club
inside the house again
yeah shove yours show your
knowledge in switch
brag about your
I happen to know some Swedish
well I am sweetie so
yeah I recognize you'd be I think I've
seen you before
you've been spying on you
just like this
yeah that was the solution
[Music]
I'm in the strange Planet this
yeah you're from uh yeah I've seen you
only a strange planet
my thumb Dynamite this one I've watched
and Noah's archives
doesn't remember if you watch both or
but I recognize your username
I can't remember if you're a Swedish or
your Danish but one or the other
made me
[Music]
almost
at the end of languages
oops
yeah yeah I need to pick up the fruit
first
I think I could pick up all this
audience oh yeah but they seem so yeah
they seem very nice they sound like
frustrated
yeah I want to watch but
can't when I stream at midnight
[Music]
that's
this side
it's sunny
oh
[Music]
but yeah I
when it's late I just oh waited too long
for that one
I just
make a peak
but I jumped again
because Tom is so nice
I cannot not
that that was an incorrect jump
okay time to stop making mistakes
[Music]
so can I just do that on the way back
once
and I want
[Music]
went quiet
foreign
[Music]
what does it sound
Ed
[Music]
[Music]
that's a nice stretches
and myself for you there's a few left
okay
now I can't jump there
and also new message
he's nice and very cuddling definitely
okay he's nice about calming I love when
he and Panda and the other stream to get
it I have barely watched when I stream
together actually
I did once I think also in case you did
that it's Dom's birthday today
today yeah okay I I thought it was a few
days ago but maybe that was because he
was streaming that day he had like an
early birthday celebration
so I think it's actually not that that's
like shiny these rabbits love shiny
things you can't just avoid it she needs
the shiny scenes
character sees the shiny things
check out here how do I get away from
here
what was the point
foreign
why didn't my mention work before when I
did one
[Music]
didn't get activated jumping back
and I'll put it back
let's activate this thing
I think twice not much of a passing
now these are activated
and now I can
activate that thing
and this one I get the key
and I thought
and then I
on the other side whether it is and then
I can jump from here
[Music]
I think I can get all the key
yes why not
gives points on complex points too
see that
okay and then the fruit is
yeah there you go
man I was typing something that my
pronouncing hasn't done us and uh
but I also want donuts
gotta go with this nice it's so nice to
see your life there it it's so nice that
you came by and chatted it's always fun
to see new people
and old people
they're chatting
makes me happy and I want why I wanted
to stream even though I'm very
scared of
speaking in front of people
talking with people
old acquaintances I don't know if that's
English
I mean old people can be nice too
I don't judge
nothing secret on the back side
okay
that's fine
old people are funny
with hourglasses
okay how am I supposed to get that one
away from there okay
I think that's all
I'm gonna go with Irish thank you
that was cleared
all the people have wisdom right and
price them wisdom eh
depends
when people can be stuck in Traditions
thank you
anyway
this is one of those lemons that are
[Music]
yeah I think I think this can work
there we go
one more it's somewhere on this level
oh ice
I'm in an hour class and that's this is
kind of the issue I have but because the
final levels which are called the final
are basically massive like this
but basically every level is like a
massive variant of existing weapons and
then there are no hourglasses on them
either
or if they are the weather right
they are making them very hard
[Music]
but I got the fruit
and the key
rush to take out
I can't do it I did it one second left
you click that
oh that was that was that was scary
I have to speak in front of people at
the parkish new house yeah yeah it
really depends on what it is I'm doing
what kind of speech I'm gonna talk if
it's private then it's easier
I don't get to talk to people that much
or I are sitting alone
no oh
[Music]
no
I didn't want this
[Music]
right at the last second yeah
that was scary
enough fun fun place
I don't know what kind of expression you
ever get from that face it just exists
okay I need them okay
uh can I get this from the back side I
can't
but first
and read comments
now I only do paperwork and deal with
airplane
oh
no talking to people
okay
power
bikinis not nothing like that
it's not the wrong side
and that's like cute
oh
my oh airplanes I like to get them out
wouldn't that be nice
and
maybe I should take this way instead
okay
I don't know what that must be dead
and anyway
[Music]
oh oh I see
I don't see
I sometimes talk to the pilots when they
attempt to land and clean it off oh so
you do talk to people
you are making me confused
[Music]
you know what it's been 30 minutes
go back to her dress
we got air traffic controller that was
it
um
[Music]
and I just did this is this really what
I should do yeah this is what I should
do
okay that was pretty simple
that was the key
[Music]
all right and the code I found it
that and more things to the airport is
super small
a tiny
rainy Airport
why does it feel like I'm missing levels
[Music]
I like Precious
nice it sounds nice
apparently wait I can do this
I can do this
at least I can do some of it
uh in this case I have to do this
there we go
get one coin
and one Diamond it's something at least
[Music]
brush
UPS
and what silly of me
I can't hear I said
oh yeah
yeah
I keep saying that
but I keep thinking
I keep speaking stuff up
but how am I supposed to get on the
inside
let's get the outside of this thing
oh yeah I see how now I don't see how
oh no I see her
I do this
now I can pick up and hourglass yes I
have time to read comments
okay
sometimes big airplanes come to land and
that's um
what does
I could imagine like cargo planes also
because it's a small small airports I
wouldn't imagine a large
passenger playing
probably a nightmare to land for them
and a lot
a crafts Pilots don't like cleaning on
small rooms
makes sense
best place to work on yes I have to tell
them too
learn on specific
airports
[Music]
specific air around me
[Music]
there we go well done
everything Chase Run Run ball
around on the inside
now we can't catch him
seriously it comes from inside
I don't see any Treasures anything else
this one
there's a fruit on the bonus level that
doesn't make sense
[Music]
[Music]
oh no sunglasses
there's an hourglass
you actually need these parts
[Music]
that was like they forgot that this was
but it's a fun job
I can imagine sometimes being strong
although is it a smaller uh
what does this happens
with imagine sometimes being stressful
especially as you said large aircraft
comes that might be
Oh no I got the attack
oh
[Music]
there you go
and you got that bonus yeah
it sounds fun
yes
man
let me started them we serve this small
village
[Music]
yeah I guess I wouldn't even know
international flights on that airport
hello
hello
I think I was about to jump off there
[Music]
yeah
yeah you won't see any
fun landing there trying to fly snow
season
all right there's a quick way of doing
this
all right how am I supposed to get back
wait is there an hourglasses
kind of think I have enough time I
should have done that from the start
surprised me
[Music]
maybe okay let's do this
[Music]
let's be modifications
pick it up
you get you all have to pick up one less
but I can't feel nice outside selling me
yeah look at this sun slides
Airport
I'm boarding another thing
[Music]
[Music]
oh I see
oh well hopefully I have enough time
they made it so I took healthy fruit
ever and I'm in the middle of nowhere I
have some Garrison farms animals near
here oh grass animals
it sounds like a nice place to live
but that he's taking it from French to
English Spanish translation
history
I wonder where that that's
of course maybe I shouldn't say that in
public but
[Music]
you know I'm forced to go this way wait
I'm back here
I would like it for
an Hour Glass Block in my way
I need to wait for that
anything exciting going on
foreign
oh you're out hitting back again yes
well it's it's better to see stuff
[Music]
you can you can have the outfit change
again if you want
or maybe to the other team
[Music]
okay
there you go
okay what's the point of that
that didn't let me
just
I'm always confused
thank you
now it's length of time
[Music]
[Music]
I would know what I'm supposed to do
I am so confused
[Music]
okay maybe I should do it twice
foreign
[Music]
and there are this
the first part of this thing
trying to think
just jumping around at the moment
all right empty this isn't helping me at
all
currently I am confused
[Music]
it's probably an easy solution
no I see the solution
it's nice and sunny outside nothing but
empty out grass and cups
smaller town
went back to from someday in the future
nice
I did it too early but I did okay not
actually complete the lemon properly
[Music]
[Music]
that's exactly now what point of this
moving is but
I think the fruit
I guess it has a big tough
division
[Music]
it's learned yeah it is learning
not much people in this place
and they are like
will be different and I will be happier
which is why it's so hard when people
ask me
please
like how is it um not good but
I guess we're not talking about that
nobody
wait we're ruining the
Happy Feelings
anyway
I found the solution
[Music]
that's good
all I do is learn about the other
villages
[Music]
is there anything
else I just need to stop picking up
stuff
[Music]
foreign
blocks the strings into nothing
[Music]
no I miss the key
that country is sticky
as there are arrows all over it
I can't visit now I'm being shot
completely don't need to reach it before
I do that
there
not wait I was supposed to do that
[Music]
oops
that's how I do it
and this time
English
has 12 people in it
I'm from Lake City kids
but I think that sometimes it's turn up
to be good
nice same seats for pumpkin
I guess purple works good for our teeth
[Music]
okay now
thank you
okay so I need to be on this side yeah
in that case he's blocking now I see
[Music]
[Music]
do I need to keep the inside
so I can somehow get into the inside I'm
sure how I would do that
doesn't make sense to me
well wait it does make sense to me
[Music]
yeah exactly
thank you for the double rotation there
thank you for notification there
bye this is
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
there we go
congratulations you have finished the
game
not really excellence in the extra
levels I don't know if I want to know
that
rain is going to explode if I try
[Music]
and they got an impossible noun
p p no it is not two pins
there you have it
I miss Nine fruits
right that means 10 fruits actually
because there was an additional fruit on
the bonus level
game is hard super difficult level
I did it
I managed to complete the game
the rest of gaming is two hours
as you see the air bonus level is bad
I was levels are too much too much
positively motive
[Music]
[Music]
if there's anything
[Music]
just yeah
I guess
a shorter theme for today as well it's
fine I hope
I hope that is fine
because I am
it was a great stream thank you since I
am I am rescheduling everything let's go
get a new schedule
and as I mentioned yesterday that maybe
we have new people here keep a track of
my schedule
since I think I've decided how I should
do it now
but yeah easiest to go to I do the
schedule and see it or if you go to
the
about page fun fun
Twitter about
there you got the schedule as far as I
could make it it will be following
European Time
passing around mid times summertime and
stuff
the Monday Tuesday of the one game
Thursday Friday would it be a second
game and Saturday Sunday would be a sad
game
something like that
at different times on of the day so
if
increasing likelihood that you will be
able to catch one of those
and that's about it I think
so
how about
where did I put my stuff
I need to organize
my stuff here
and a bit more prepared I'm still new to
this but I will give it better at it
so
just
oh is it out yeah I mean I did the 151
11th so there is additional 50 levels I
think but
my brain is not going to be able to
handle that
foreign
if you remember if you can help me
remember that
so
would you like to watch do you know
OverWatch
let's let's go back to the Ukrainian
streamer
give us a few days ago
she's nice
and funny
and you can copy this message and just
paste it as we join
that's usually
the people there I guess most people
don't do it but
it's more fun when people do
kind of part of the trading
and I'll try to do the C3 racing
on Monday again
I should not give up on that
okay
hopefully
and I don't have anything else to say so
thank you everyone and
hopefully see you
at the latest Street or something
I'm really bad
bye bye
