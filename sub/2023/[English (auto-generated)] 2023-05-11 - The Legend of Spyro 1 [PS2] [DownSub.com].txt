it's microphone working yes it does
so I am
a recession a bit late
that's kind of my trend
so
I currently don't have a picture which
is kind of a problem
so it will be hard to play the game
but I shall see if it shows up
something has shown up
why is it showing the character
didn't do that
oh it is showing a picture but I can't
see it on my TV so
that's going to be a problem
why isn't it showing up on my TV doesn't
make sense
because the capture software and which
at least is working has
like a one and a half second delay
and that will certainly make
playing the game
tricky
so that's
my turn problem
everything
yeah I don't know why
it just doesn't show the picture on the
TV
now without eat that can't really play
the game
uh I should try
with HDMI cable and see if that works
so I need to
write that
foreign
okay let's try again
it's the legendary pumpkin with
technical issues
so
I'm not sure how legendary
you're welcome
the game shall begin
as soon as a happy
which could be at any moment
but really soon
I don't get a picture
this is certainly I haven't had this
problem before
I just wanted to work but now this is
before I just could could just plug
everything in and it just worked I
haven't applied this anything out so
that's certain that's not the problem
yeah it just doesn't
it doesn't got to get any picture
it captures it's fine here but
it's that can't really play on this
picture that's such a delay
and I don't know what's going on I don't
know it's not working no
I don't know what I'm supposed to do to
fix it
and I don't really have
the necessary
cables to like if I could replace the
camera but I don't really have
cables to replace the cable Smith
blend you have this skin I could
try see how it goes
foreign
but
that was
just looking
please give me
and to keep on being bad
definitely cables
there
and it's fiction
we have
yeah perfect
let's bring it up on the computer again
and let's begin
the control is not taking it
okay
now
as usual a technical problem is but now
everything is working perfect and I'm
happy honestly it stays through all that
so let's begin
spiral
the way this was the Legend of Spyro
let's do English that seems like a good
idea
produced or published by
yeah and chrome Studios
and Technic cover Interactive
the game very quiet
Miss very quiet
[Music]
you're doing greatness thank you
well I'm doing my best not just this
Hardware not working
This song reminds me
let's do that
I don't know if it's always a good to
check
you know should we have something this
might be hard to hear what you're saying
sometimes
light up down
I mean
I would I would assume normal is not
normal as I usually say when people
complain about the flight controls in
Spyro when they say it's inverted it's
not inverted it's just normal playlist
controls so the question is is inverted
people think is inverted which is the
normal
[Music]
or is inverted the inverted of the
normal where the normal is the pilot
controls
I pay this on Xbox I have this game
and I usually the invert camera left and
right
and
most yeah there's white screen support
yeah but to
I mean yeah why not I don't really need
to change anything
but I should
hear the black Edge there I think
it's analog signals you don't get
[Music]
there we go it's a beautiful
white screen
of course
because this place isn't too it's not
really
like
that's good girl
this this memory well I've teach you to
use a new game so I would assume they're
not existing any
heavy data
Dave data is kind of the point in the
year of the dragon now this is Legends
I like all the others awaited the births
of the Dragon of whom the prophecies
foretold
but the dark master heard the prophecies
as well
I should have hidden the eggs long
before but I
I thought we were ready I thought they
were safe
oh how I was wrong
save them the dark armies have come
[Music]
foreign
may they look after us all
that's good
[Music]
slight adjustments to the picture
[Music]
The Legend of Spyro and you be a writer
haven't changed it
this picture I show my TV
you didn't put the controllers behind me
this game is so cool
[Music]
yeah there you go
69.
eventually the egg came to rest in a
distant swamp what a family of
dragonflies gathered round wondering
what magnificent creature could possibly
live inside the male being blue you have
to wonder for long he made me a pinch
clothing after a cutscene
clear loaded earrings
okay
from the end frightened them at first
but finally amazed and astonished them
eight nine ten here I come
it was a purple dragon who they
eventually adopted and raised as one of
their own
named in Spyro and he grew up alongside
Sparks the young dragonfly who was born
the same day in fact the two were almost
black Brothers
and a more oddly matched yet compatible
pair of brothers the world has never
seen never catch me this time purple boy
as for Spyro
he like all of us accepted the world
into which he was born
believing he was one of them true
but one of them he looks a little bit
different
is Russia not take to move the camera to
find Sparks okay wait
okay inverted camera controls is up
apparently
this is confusing it's
okay
it's a normal controls in this game is
inverted in reignited perfect
I see you my little glowing friend
seeing and catching are two different
things a big boy
yeah you better run I was a friendly
foreign
okay that seems easy
no and also use the camera at the same
time there's no active camera options
and holiday X to jump okay
oh you can jump far
you can see things mean to jump as well
what if I'm missing any comments I
think oh that's right you walk
everywhere that's too bad
your toast when I catch you
another space upset
press and hold R1 to charge wait me why
would that be the charge button but okay
he runs backwardly
all right let me out I hear you
overgrown fungus Spyro seriously love me
a hand here will you brother
geez Sparks I don't know frogweed's
gotta eat too
Spyro whack it do something I'm your
buddy my wings are getting moldy
Chris circus is a melee attack wait
that's not the melee attack button
or is it melee attack melee right I
don't know English I don't speak English
in fact I've probably three times really
Sparks

oh no
more living plants
three hits that was four years so that's
okay
hello
[Music]
collecting red gems will give you a
Health Energy
so that's my
h e not HP okay
let's see if I can remember that
I mean it doesn't matter but
Which choice upcoming it health and
energy instead of Health points
hey that's cheating we're not allowed in
there yeah excuses excuses catch up or
give up chunky
[Music]
press jump
attack
three times to perform a triple tail
whip to break through this snake skull
okay
here we go
where's that little mat gone now
has everybody seen a giant purple thing
around here I seemed to have lost mine
who is I know
foreign
of some sort
you know this is Sparks
[Music]
I thought all you guys was gone
miserable coward let me go
all right don't let him get away
exactly hey I'm reading
okay oh there you go that's some red
gems

H or h
Jesus Christ
I think he's dead already
and now
there you go that's a nice boy
[Applause]
okay now it's getting dangerous
wow
let me out of here and fight me like a
thing whatever you are you pathetic
wretch
I've heard about enough for you
out now
was that
take care of them I gotta report to
Sender
yes
quite easy fire blast which is not the
fire but I'm not sure
thank you
sometimes
I mean I guess that's for the fire but
what is it called
like magic energy
get me out of here Spyro I think my
wings are singed
yes are you okay
you almost torch me dude wait
you breathe fire so I'm just about ready
to blow the top off that place and kick
that guy's booty wouldn't Spyro let
loose with some serious flame dude no
joke Flames from the mouth well I I was
just trying to help you know some help
you like turned me into ashes dude mom
dad you should have seen him he came out
breathing five hours all right I tell
you it was crazy
you don't believe me
just Spyro tell him well it's true dad I
swear I just got real mad open my mouth
and whoosh flame city it's not that
spiral I believe you both it's just that
your mother and I knew this day would
come what day the day when we would have
to tell you the truth so that was the
night that Spyro learned he wasn't a
dragonfly after all but in fact an
exiled from an apartment
so
you mean I'm not your real son you are
our real son it's just that you came
from somewhere else far away where Wars
rage on and on and the Innocents seem to
always pay the price
it wasn't long after that night that
Spyro decided to venture forth and find
his home
so that's it huh they've been sparked
behind the Old Homestead not a care in
the world don't look back
this is your home Sparks but I just
found out that my home is out there
somewhere and I've got to find it
besides I'm not leaving you behind I'm
just leaving you where you belong well I
thought I belong with you because I'm
always with you but I guess I was wrong
huh I'm sure I'm wrong on a lot of
things you know what you're right I'm
wrong don't worry about him spiral you
know how hot-headed he can be you'll see
him when you get back
now now son keep your head up your nose
clean and use that breath of yours
wisely all gifts come with a price
don't listen to your father's preaching
spiral just be yourself it's all any of
us can do
be yourself be a dragon
so as hard as it was Spyro left the only
family he had ever known and yearn it on
to where he did not know
whatever
[Music]
the Adventure Continues as bit of a slow
start but
just now a good way of making component
transparent but you can see
oh hello do you want to fight
where's the sound effects
seriously where did the sound effects go
when it is just pause so
okay turn the face are back
unless there's a
bullet
hydrate are just hydrated
I should have water because I'm almost
running out
I guess I'll take a break
to get more when I run off this oh now
there's something
okay one more try
this time with sound effects
yeah no
no I can hear stuff
I attacked it
I'm not allowed to take me back
especially since you don't even give me
any else back
don't do something you can't attack or a
flame
all right so
oh there's another one
it's like
XP from doing this
what doesn't seem to be anything left
here
the sticks let's attack it
all right
[Applause]
there's a thing here I don't know what
it is
[Music]
XXX it's a double jump hole X after
jumping to Glide
okay this is actually a quiet Gap
me and the old man were chatting and
this whole belonging thing you know came
up and we decided that best friends
belong together even if one of them is
purple and does have some weight issues
weight issues huh well at least I've
never been turned into a lantern oh
please Lantern let's see what's out
there
and then
connecting Korean Shams will give you
breath energy oh it's b a b e okay now I
know
HP and be
[Music]
and there are those things are back
Amazon kind of
I mean you can horn dive into animes by
pressing
X jump and then charge
okay I can try that
[Music]
I can see anything else
oh
wow
so many of these things
although I didn't try to charge this
thank you
[Applause]
that's what's out of them oh no second
hydrate or on a second year welcome
welcome
you can't strafe around enemies by
holding
and one
[Music]
here we go I was I'm dying by really
okay
yeah mixed up they're playing button
because someone decided to move it okay
I'm dying
okay I need I need to find a different
strategy
thank you
okay for some reason I could jump if
that didn't work
try what do they
okay I already lost
foreign
it's a bit tricky to have two enemies at
the same time
okay there's quite a difficult Spike
here let's do it
so I need to
some
how did that hit me
there's a bug here
thank you
yeah
okay I said they weren't too this would
be quite easy
okay so all that damage didn't do
anything before
okay I moved into this attack
thank you
and this is working
so that's one got stuck on the corpse
that was the second I just have to do a
lot of stretching
but I wanted to strafe more
there you go
I did it
I win it
the many attempts
I guessing I don't have just counting
and things from that
check it down there
we'll see if I fall down
[Applause]
all right
I mean this looks to be a platform there
so
enemies
[Music]
awkward place to attack them is there
any secrets here
not just my enemies or something
okay
yeah slime rabbits
with that slight
ly well even though that looks like a
platform you can not stand on it
and they like that they are small
bugs
the level
the enemy
like a dark place
[Music]
oh boy go to your happy place
what in the world was that
I have no idea but uh I'm going this way
far from it which brings us to the
moment that spiders
when he and I finally met again after
the very first time the whole it's a
long story
and I thought you were a big one
goodness
yo
you're alive
but it's too late
too late yeah you left him to die
does it sound like he knows we are a
dragon
when you were just an egg it was my job
to protect you
that was my job
protect all of you there are others
others they were there were four of us
Guardians that is and we had one job
ensure that all the eggs were hatched it
was the ears of the Dragon after all and
our very survival depended on those eggs
the temple
and grotto are now gone
overrun by
by Temple what Temple can you take me
can I see it where I came from I mean no
no
no who knows what forces occupy the
temple now
scene
you don't understand
after they came for you they who is they
and why did they come for me because the
prophecies spoke of a purple dragon a
dragon born only once every 10
Generations
ew
does that mean him oh wait this guy
Spyro some special once in a purple
thing
I think you might uh mixed that one up
whoa that's a little
bit of a stretch I've heard some doozies
in my day but that takes the cake your
Spyro isn't it
well Spyro
I assure you that I'm telling you the
truth the dark arm is attacked intent on
destroying the eggs and killing the rest
of us have they nearly succeeded
and then they lay Siege to the other
Islands
we were a dual
so many years we fought all over the
islands
neutral clashes with the armies of the
dark master who was intent on preventing
the prophecies from coming true
the three Guardians and I laid our small
but Valiant forces into the battle after
battle against
sin came Cinder
is
monstrous horrific ferocious black
dragon that fills the skies with Terror
stoppable force of nature uh yeah you
had me at ferocious listen
sounds like that thing that was chasing
us Spyro
[Music]
years ago I watched a cinder plucked the
other Guardians
our cause is lost
only I ignite us manage to escape
matters Cinder now rules all and I sit
here wondering what might have been
what else I might have done
wow
sounds fun I want to hang out with this
guy yeah why have you given up I just
find out that I'm this special dragon
and you tell me All Is Lost that I have
no home or family left I've come way too
far to give up now I want to see where I
come from hold up savior boy were you
not listening to this guy
he's talking about flying dragons and
War and horribles this is bad stuff all
right I don't know if we're hearing the
same thing yes Spyro it's not as simple
as that it's true the prophecy spoke of
the Purple Dragon destined to put his
stamp on this age but the prophecies
didn't foretell the devastation that
surrounds us now
maybe you're right but I'm willing to
try I want to take the first step you're
actually going to go along with this
lunatic very well then
will go
you deserve to see your beginning
before it all ends
am I the only one staying here he's
telling us we're doomed all right that's
when I go ah maybe we should you know go
back to the forest with the flowers and
the fun stuff
fly always have fun stuff
I'm gay
where do you come from
okay ignite this don't ignite this I
think I like this okay that's Cinder
soldiers must have knocked the other two
statues out of place
heathens what other two statues on the
other side of this door are two statues
just like these one all four statues are
positioned correctly
the door opens yeah good I was never
good at geometry so what do you want us
to do Spyro
I need you to get in there and move the
statues in place me
how that's a small tunnel that animals
use to access the caves
find it and use it yeah animals okay you
know what you do that and I'll wait here
and you see
I'm the small change used by animals
and smash it open
okay
I'll smash open this mushrooms
and whatever this is
could you point me in the direction of
this thing
I mean you seem to know about it could
you like show me what it is
I don't know I don't know this place
there's something here
[Music]
[Music]
we go one more hit
all right
[Music]
I still love life that helps
I don't know if I should continue with
it
[Music]
okay
oh
look at that
look at what a hole oh is that the
hey when in doubt break it right go nuts
jump jump excited
it holds circles to perform a tail
strike okay
instead of triangle
oh surprise attack
oh
okay
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
all right
not shiny
they slept from the ish
I was selected in and test it
to do what happened welcoming
I will be back okay any trouble
oh insect trouble nothing I couldn't
handle
welcome Julie
the house is Prelude
do not reject us are you making that up
it should open for us
there is a disturbance
he's talking to it again hey
they've desecrated the interior as well
yes we need orders
make your way through the connectedness
restoring every statue you can find hey
you know what let's don't say we didn't
why don't you do it you want my help
very well
hop up all right the old guy is coming
to life well thank you for finally
actually helping out
careful spiral
cinder's forces are surely on their way
oh goody take a gander at this
let's see
I guess it's even breaking completely
[Music]
the power of a thousand sung through my
body right
yeah okay well you know what you should
really sleep better you know I'm gonna
stop bugging you we really need to get
eight hours forget I said anything let's
go
he's been breaking things all the way
here so
oh
okay you can't do anything with that
save back one more thing what doesn't
matter
no not more of his
[Music]
too many of these
foreign
it doesn't seem like it's doing anything
Okay so
[Music]
I hope I'm asking my name is good
that can be heard for the game
more status to move in place
a little Melody when it's basically put
in place
there are more of these
stay in space
oh yeah now I need it
okay
that's quite an entrance young dragon
there might be hope for us yet
oh
what are these things
these are Spirit gems
a gift from the ancestors what kind of
gift a gift that speaks across
Generations a gift that empowers you
with the spirit of the past
strengthening you with the wisdom of the
ages I I feel more powerful already
maybe you shouldn't destroy them
past the gem Club collecting clear
chance will increase your spirit energy
and use to upgrade your breaths
three you're living up top of your skin
on the pause menu okay
so now I get the blue ones
do you hear that
what is it
exactly what I feared
look Spyro
perhaps we should turn back what after
coming this far
if this door is closed it means there
are Intruders behind it's how the temple
protects itself I uh yeah it doesn't
work too well does it
so what are you saying ignite us
what I'm saying not letting introduce
don't say it is if the intruders are
kicked out of there
didn't I just say don't say it
level up so I have basically nothing
but okay
take care of those later
do I get this now nope
let's find a way to break through the
wall okay
now this one
okay oh that's one oh I think maybe I
shot you
nope
that's right
[Applause]
[Music]
well that worked
box cannot tell me where to go so
okay now I can break this lightly
oh
okay what's that
no more bombs
all right
[Music]
what's that
I guess it worked
so why did that one expensive okay
I'll show all the enemies
[Music]
since then they do give me
okay so now you don't want the attack
oh
okay
[Music]
make sure I don't miss anything
let's find that
big one there you have me
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
I like energy
okay the big one taken care of
that's pretty easy
this looks interesting
sleeping ignite the fuse with your fire
blast
but ignite this isn't there
okay
[Applause]
but it's good
don't turn the list out and stuff
but I guess I'll just continue through
the caves
we have to get a brightest place so dark
in here
it's not the fastest game but I did have
some issues
hello ignitis
will ignitis we nabbed Your Guardian
buddies but you managed to escape our
clutches no they can speak until now
let me show you what a dragon trained in
the ancient ways can do
okay
[Music]
whoa the big guy's got some moves
foreign
[Music]
are you okay ignitas
yes
it takes longer to recover
look at those two incredible ignitis can
you show me how to do that
patience young dragon
soon enough you'll learn all I have to
teach
but right now you must fight
I want my gems
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
forces
they won't be there for long
wonderful now he's getting cocky it's
are you the one to say it can't someone
else being cocky
even if he's cocky but he's
he's a jerk
that's just satin oh
who love from you
oh
sweet home yes now you're at home
there are enemies in this bar you have
to take care of them before I go in
I should totally up on this
hmm
okay I didn't expect that
you have to clean up this place
I hope that's one was important
or value
[Music]
anyone else oh
animals
yes
okay I go back to ignitas
oh you're coming
no hurry don't don't hurt yourself
[Music]
you don't seem to be
[Music]
too healthy at the moment
[Music]
yeah he's not going through there
[Music]
but yeah okay apparently I guess he get
stuck and gets there I guess that works
not in Kansas anymore
now this is the dragon Kingdom
oh look it's bright it's finally bright
I can't see
what happened here I don't know this is
how it looks normally
has done do you know how it's supposed
to look all the islands under her iron
rule
I wanted to see where I came from but
I didn't know it was going to be like
this
yeah no offense but this place is a bit
of a dump
this was one so home Spyro you took
offense in it together we can make it
our home once again
we claim what's rightfully ours
what do you mean
I mean that my time for heroics is
Powers but with your help
we might be able to beat Cinder
or uh Spider does everything himself I
just learned what I am
well that's
you are a purple dragon a very special
creature
don't judge people based on their color
you've given me hope again
and now it's time to give hope to all of
them
I'm not sure what help I can be ignitis
but
I'll try I mean you defeated every enemy
without dying I mean
you know that that's all I can ask
now come with me
I have something for you
the style you used earlier is crude
archaic and obvious but you got the job
done
you haven't been told anything about
what it means to be a dragon
thanks
if you're going to happen sure okay I'm
not sure you're going to need to learn a
lot more
oh good school
unlike any school you've ever known
young friend
I was thinking it's time to I don't know
what it's called the true Dragon within
you you can't really focus like look at
something
of an element
I as you may have surmised and master of
Fire
pay attention
and you may be someday too
let's begin
you seem to have learn the ability to
breathe fire on your own that's very
impressive and uncommon but now let's
see if you can Master it
sure wait are these dummies
apparently
that very good young spider
come here
this time see if you can come here
speaking of the spider like
that
Inspire babe come here
okay time limit
where's
invisible climate
surrounding
why is it starting really so terrible
what a purple ones
oh I have a purpose thing now
yeah I can't do this challenge because
they are running from me
normally animals don't flee so this is
usually a challenge
oh
is that how I should do it okay
okay for being a time limit it's quite a
long time limit
we don't I don't think it's much about
time left
is infinite
I don't see a clock
or
is it hidden somewhere
okay now I hear something
maybe this is supposed to be a clock on
the screen it's just
find the strength Spyro it's straight
you have it they're fleeing for me
this time see if you can chase them down
with your fire breath
it is possible that
yes I'm not actually using it proper
still concerned
there is some kind of clock overlay that
isn't showing at the moment
I don't know
this is certainly much easier
it doesn't mean hit that
hopefully that wasn't valuable
and you don't need it for anything
okay I say become viewer and fewer it is
getting
harder to hit them
as they are
not seriously can you can you separate
me
oh
this is worse than trying to change the
spray barely has a turret
it but
hey this spider has a giant turtle
movies
diameter
it's a final
oh you awakened my hopes once more
over here I am here you must learn that
there is a time and a place for
everything
your ability to breathe fire is you okay
second hold it
well done
this way oh mauve one knocking enemies
off into the air allows many
opportunities for continued attacks in
the air your wings give you the
advantage okay let's see
wow I actually won awesome what a
surprise
let us see how well you can improvise
with your abilities
I think foreign
and now it's time to move on
come over here sir sorry
press the button four times to melee the
dummy three times and knock it up into
the air
then press
jump and three times jump in area melee
into three times okay
four times to mainly
[ __ ]
so I guess the worst that's it doesn't
count as a melee attack over here let's
try another
oh I see
sorry that
foreign
this way oh mauve one conserve your
energy and strike when your enemy is
vulnerable
yeah I can do this
yeah I guess I'm supposed to charge up
the spirograph or something
yeah I'm here I'm here I'm an
off-balanced enemy can be very useful
and that
no
that sounds delicate
in that case
yeah I can
since that can't
[Music]
and I can't
okay
yeah I have nothing here to this
I can't rest on your Laurel Spyro I'll
try again you've barely begun I'll try
again
come over here I'm here balanced enemy
got the requirement to stand in
different positions each time
so if I do that like adjust the position
yes
it's like that
foreign
I want gems
over here let's see if you can
successfully knock an enemy back into a
larger group
this can be effective in in situations
where you are drip okay
but you are far from done yet
this way oh sorry for knocking you Spyro
you have taken tremendous strides in
your ability to harness the element of
wow
but now I will teach you to
focus and channel your
that's quite the
not quite the show timing too it has
quite the explosion from I knew you had
it in your spiral simple attack
spiral come here yeah I'm here now let's
mix it up a little
bit
so far so good
now for the real challenge
isn't that the challenge already
I should still not completely in your
position you have demonstrated the
ability to control and manipulate fire
Spyro it is clear you have a strong
kinship with the flame
but now it is time for you to learn to
unleash its Fury
the fuel the fire consume and flow
through you
and when the time is right
release it
fire Fury
thank you
yeah
let's see this
oh
select this thing
you might have a chance against Cinder
yet
that might come in handful I can't
Cinder
should wait for study to rise before we
can continue again
I could probably get my drink more much
and drink in the meantime
oh
my God
so what's with the pool big guy
if you must know certain dragons have
the ability to see visions
the thoughts memories and dreams
to see what's happening in places
I am White Sox dragon
in this pool
after this
oh really is that so okay what am I
thinking now
we're making now
okay now now now now now
I'm afraid it's not that easy Sparks
it takes time reflection and patience
what I do see in the pool divisions is
that voltia one of the Guardians is
being held on Dante's freezer I guess
multi wasn't a volunteer into getting
each other
and find out what you can
remember just look around
if you encounter Cinder run
you're not ready to face her yet oh okay
so when people are trying to kill me I
run got it but ignite us how do we get
there
I'm glad you asked why are you smiling I
don't like it
let me get this straight you're saying
that I can fly
when you have wings maybe you've been
hanging in those caves a little too long
old man
Spyro can't fly we all know that
yeah a bit of fresh air might do you
good I've I've never flown in my life
it's you that will be getting some fresh
air Spyro fresh air as your wings close
your eyes
take a deep breath and empty your mind
yes yes that's it
feel the power of your ancestors
coursing through your body
in times of Crisis they will come to you
and teach you
unlocking Powers you never knew you had
boy This I Gotta See just forget
everything you ever thought you knew
forget yourself
will you remember what your ancient
blood already knows
you can fly
on this time and only had this blame
himself
well that certainly makes the original
trilogy easier
because the abilities fly free
with bright
the brother had have a shadow around him
I don't I've seen quite a few games do
that while it is included
welcome to the club but I just find it
looking weird because
[Music]
what's the Chateau against yeah
could get used to this
it's ironman's beloved and L1 to slow
down okay
[Music]
I was using up that meeting
let's try this shoot helming fireballs
I didn't have anything at home too I
guess
it's fun holding left or right on the
left unlock stick is to barrel roll out
of danger
this is a barrel roll
is the correct terminology
the hotel press up or down
[Music]
[Music]
okay
[Music]
a super fire Cannon
you have to get it to give me the damage
from that
[Applause]
um
oh so that also picks up
[Music]
[Music]
yeah I can't be much left of this boat
boat is holding together
I don't think a real bird will survive
this much Fireballs but
oh it disappeared
by that
oh I guess
[Music]
I guess spider died during his first
flight
do I have to restart all the way from
here
no checkpoints
okay
that's right
yep two three died
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
that's a touch
[Applause]
foreign
[Music]
loading
well I got to see that part
and now that he gets down on the ground
he cannot know if life really I assume
Dante's Frieza is a desolate Arctic
expense that's littered with the
Machinery of War soldiers and weapons
frozen forever in the posture of
Destruction you must find voltier
for his lost forever
do I land coming in too fast this
doesn't look good
that's gonna hurt
certainly nice landing Ace
yeah maybe this flying thing ain't for
me
well it sure doesn't help that you're
carrying all that weight you know throw
a salad in every once in a while you
might be okay
yeah I I think I'll stick to the ground
for a while for a while good idea
not exactly a friendly Place huh I
wonder where we should start well I'm no
hero like you but maybe we should take
that clearly marked path that leads to
the interior
no why would you do that
I'm back welcome kitten
look at this snow please
have eyes so it can't blink ice cubes
are
against it
why don't we use this thing to knock
that bad boy down
I knew I brought you along for a reason
that was quite the explosion
foreign
value at some point
blast of the Blazing Skies torch the bad
guys with a fuller Hood breasts that
want to face a loud person
okay
this up
notification is awkward
I guess this isn't too awkward
I don't remember it that's let's just
upgrades
is that the
and
then
I like that
I don't know if that's the
power to activate this
that feels like it
okay what am I supposed to use
snowball
I mean I have this power that is this on
the on the gate
definitely that should be enough
Okay so
well in the original Spy game you can
bear the flags unless that was an
addition in reignited
snow area yeah
it is a snow area I am at home here
uh heated trees to make snowballs fall
down push them into the catapults to
prepare them for firing okay thank you
for telling me what to do
I mean I didn't know what to do anyways
I hope I didn't break anything
okay
what now
I mean I want to see one tree in here so
but it is
Oh you mean hit in that sense okay
I mean charging would make sense but
sure sure
foreign
[Music]
from the tree so not compact at all
have freshly from the tree are passing
more powerful
and using a fire blast
yo glad you no
[Music]
skip some dialogue
toilet paper jams will give you Fury
energy yeah I know that
foreign
laughs
and it's a very big explosion
but as long as you
just
watch and don't really pay attention to
how much damage it does I guess it's
looks nice
it's interesting because think it's
useful
I get you
that nice
so do you still think I need to upgrade
it because
I Still Still Believe It's
has more use than its regular fire
both the use of the green energy I meant
breast energy that's that's what scars
I mean personally makes more sense in
green energy
okay near Canon
ah
looks like I need a cannon
yeah yeah of course of course if you
throw a snowball at something explosive
the thing will explode
is that something else
that makes perfect sense
okay okay take it easy with the enemies
now
um just started the game
remember to press
R2 to you soon
pure if you are playing over hey also
around by takes 10 and which is the same
time
well I'm not using that anyway so
when you stop running you're not even
applying
wow
you're throwing
I just want this regular fire this time
[Music]
can I start throwing those things
I don't like it when you throw explosive
things I know what is this
purify when I want this
foreign
[Music]
just fine
how much oh already okay let's appear in
another level
no sheriff is enough for another level
not not really
I don't know if you it actually becomes
stronger if you don't reach next level
foreign
okay
can you stop doing that please
why not
okay maybe try
it
okay
spider died by spiky things and not by
an enemy
that would be an awkward things to write
okay let's do it
wait where's everyone
okay okay let's see
let me just get rid of these things
first
no nothing
okay so I got rid of that
and that
now if I die I don't have to deal with
Batman
and then that's taken care of
uh I did not get any breath from it
where's my crystal if it raised these
gifts they have to destroy
that's my spiky things yeah what do you
call them
yeah here we go
oh I didn't get to attack it there's a
cutscene in the lane but there's two of
them
I sure hope so what well if it wasn't it
means there's more than one giant evil
dragon around here oh yeah I hope that
was cinder too
maybe there is more than one evil dragon
I don't know
I'm back here
yeah I want this green stuff
blue and purple works too I guess
ah I can't really
do much
no stop doing that
I mean
oh no
I'm playing attacked by the Dead
can he
can you stop doing that please
thank you
you are being annoying at the moment
no thank you
you're terrifying you're not too
terrifying it's that thing that I killed
with them okay
worm shooting
I don't know where I'm taking The Wrong
Enemy
uh more enemies
[Music]
yeah I'm thinking it's I haven't really
comment on it so basically every anime
has a name
a slightly just randomly generated of
course
why are they trying to destroy my
Cannon okay
let me
let me fill it up
[Music]
[Applause]
one hit plus no ball
the ice Cannon is dead
sure
I thought it's required more than one
move this now
okay so things have started burning
because I sent them
I don't know this one works more
cutscenes
it's kept since the game
[Music]
electricity pyro you okay buddy
you have learned the electric screen
breath press
select to select the electricity element
in the future you can upgrade this press
further in the level up
the electric
Guardians
three prep nuts like tell me about stuff
while I'm busy attacking Ole Miss
I just
Okay so
all right so okay okay but after I how
do I get my the much better play message
just pressing select is embarrassing
and I don't have the Fury with it either
I guess I'm stuck with electricity for
now
wait
oh it's Plus
it wasn't the select but please excuse
me it was the yeah
yeah
a rectangle with a pointy bit on it
that's the head and if it's the start
button it would be
foreign
yeah it must be enough she's now
how much damage does it do
nothing to see how much damage was well
it seems needs to kill them now so
it certainly is upgraded
but speaking of Instagram I must have
missed the attack
burning snow Yeah but that sounds good
the snow was on fire
all right
I missed attack again
such a terminal
of these I mean I'm getting
experience points
[Music]
all right cats
can't get close because that's the name
thanks for that
much
the strength to go on
is that some a high level
and on the surprise
there's like based on distance
crafty
wasn't too crafty and just ran into yeah
policies explosion of this version
that's Legend of spire
it's working
so
it's my Chromebook
thank you
and that was too far spider like
attacked us that are up close
[Music]
I might attack it does that's the attack
yeah
yeah or something I feel like I have to
use the cannon
attack those those enemies that standing
right in front of you
like it's a third person I shouldn't
have to aim that carefully
now how the attack Miss some enemies
I'm gonna start so close
please spawn the evil
but you're the evil one
he does try to attack at a math I'm just
terrible at him
I saw you trying to attack me though
yeah that's me big state
because I'm not getting anyway uh

why well complied
nice to see you I hope you're still here
I don't know how long ago you read that
message
yeah I don't yeah I need a better setup
so I can see the comments while I'm
playing the game

think about that before I just haven't
come up with a solution
because the compute I'm still here nice
hello
do you know about Harry playlist fire
for
[Music]
let's shoot down that power
there's a lot of explosions at least in
my place time you can of course play in
different ways
I like I like the explosions
load it goodbye I guess that's it the
Catapult as well
excuse me I need to get the
I need to get this number which for some
reason survives these explosions
again
okay so now the tower is destroyed
by that
[Music]
I see now
I have to judge by the scenerys even
and there are no more enemies
let's get some more
clear power I never played it
oh
I don't need to streaming
it's I mean I've only done it for a
month now
heard something
well it's a Trilogy so I'm going to play
through all three three games
one of them
one time realized that something was
wrong
and ran with one of others
yeah I don't like what how this is
looking
those enemies are very strong for being
still quite
I mean it's still like over an hour into
the game
we've ever seen three game it's actually
two hours now and
but I still like the second world
okay
can I actually have an orange
oh I see
Alexis is good at stunning
okay I'm supposed to use this
you
get hard to hit you
come back to the ground
and then more two of them
[Music]
okay
two minutes same thing oh I got some
electric bashing now
that didn't work
[Music]
laughs
wait how the teammates how do you think
I mean I can't do this
Pirates Of Fire
that's not what I'm supposed to like
[Music]
the world is
doomed
they redeemed oh hello let's continue
from where we left up off
is that one taking care of
it was um
the wrong way
[Music]
okay
that's
foreign
yeah I'm playing it it actually worked
pretty fine on this
lace adher
is that how you want to say
welcome
I am
trying my best I'm not
played this much of this game
so
that was nice
okay what's up
okay one too many
oh uh
I wasn't ready for that one here we go
all right here we covered on your hands
okay
there it is stand back you're supposed
to get hit by that
[Music]
Who's Laughing Now
oh I almost died something
that would have been
quite silly
make it through here
[Music]
quite a lot of these Energies
where where are you running
why are you running
you're an enemy is supposed to attack me
okay
it was a cutscene enemy I couldn't
attack it
what what was that
did the wrong way
okay let me
go
[Music]
don't don't surround me
thank you
okay I guess I can never destroy those
things
what was that
oh it's open
hello
[Music]
I don't want to fight you
yeah okay can you let me go
too many of these
okay
let me go
no no that was that attached
died from that
cute cute
that I can press that to quickly get it
um oh
wasting they have a lot of power
bison
if it's soon
oops
and then I take damage off by
it's been weak
this week from the fire
drunk
[Music]
you got that lots of a lot of that
over him but that was fine but there's
that that one again why are you running
wait why are you lighting
why didn't you let me light it on fire
I didn't seemed like a good idea
all right
no anime is left right
keep forgetting that's that's the point
oh more enemies
[Music]
don't surround me
which is transpiring explodes
not sure what the Slowdown is foreign
laughs
yeah yeah this
is not switch
okay wrong button
and yeah I don't know it
wanna survive
Greek laundry
a Wandering is streaking
that doesn't seem okay
bad fire what do you mean by bad fight
the fire that burns fire
yeah okay that was a bad fire not good
fire what is this a crow
a crown that was a crow right
then
I'm
close in oh no what is this
Maybe
okay you were completely easy to defeat
until spiderstones
the third one
okay one on two
like me
okay you did attack me you did attack me
before I could recover
if I defeat the big monster why mine
doesn't ride they die
that doesn't make much sense
okay thank you that everything a few
more here
level up
can I get Max lamina
no I couldn't
you think a dragon that control the
elements would be immune to them but no
trying to think
I don't know either yeah no I I don't
know
actually
I'm trying to think
are there any elements you would
consider humans to control
okay
something basic and like punishing is
something he must do but humans aren't
really immune to punches
nicely come come with me
let me do like one-on-one please
okay be like that
is there any health or something
yeah are you guys gonna stand there
yeah come
on no stop stop doing that
[Music]
he's on the side
try again
all right
now you're coming
okay
the attack range is it's quite big
yeah let's keep trying
I like the explosions
see anything
foreign
getting your Vibe and then the enemies
are still
establishes there was before
my name that was the case in like dark
souls or something
okay I can
oh the
what is that
[Applause]
destroying their powers I guess it's not
their towers
because they could have taken over this
place
these things are here
you want to go in there and these ice
place is gonna look the same
I think it's no question
and I walk out here I got some place yes
analyzer surrounded
hello what did you conquer
all right did you did
did you just
get yourself attacked
why are you destroying my gems
that's that for me to destroy
[Music]
I guess I'm
foreign
like that
yeah I'm not sure how much damage that
does
okay I
didn't mean to attack you see okay can
you
that was the wrong way
I mean I could do this probably
there you go taken care of
oh no where did you come from
the house
ready oh
that's probably just that's ready and
then immediate effect
[Music]
okay can we can we find one one of them
nothing you can't
well
that case I'll fight you like a carrot
bite me
ah yeah quite the attack yeah
so I got full out
rests but
okay
oh oh
passing Landing where I want them to go
he's tired already
okay so we have a person up here
taking care of
oh
looks like I'm supposed to go here
[Music]
or enemies
[Music]
it's his explosion
yeah
as you guys say this small one doesn't
gain much of a challenge but they can't
they do
wait what did that one die from
me living there yeah
okay
interesting
[Music]
don't surround me
I don't feel comfortable being
surrounded
[Applause]
missed
I guess it worked anyway
Lisa twister
okay
five three one-on-one
what do you come from I just said 101.
as soon as they say one-on-one
is ruining
[Music]
a great one-on-one battle
[Music]
but I need to take care of this
I don't know why I would do that but
it's something to do
but I did it yeah nice camera
[Music]
all right they still damaged me
foreign
use it more often
yeah that one is maxed out already
that was just one of those game not much
they look special
[Music]
yes
I guess not
just
one-on-one what do you what's with the
faces what's wrong with one-on-one
do you want to take in one and one
wait I hear something
foreign
foreign
do you want to take him 101 I guess you
two can take it 101. Mouse
Greek yeah there we are
nature taser
kitten freak
together at last
[Music]
how about focusing on the enemy that is
closing
it's a novel idea
yeah now you'll be taking it when I want
one by one
each time
I guess so
I think punching each other
hi however I have fire I guess that's an
advantage
foreign
like
it wouldn't hurt me I would attack you
so I guess they both lives it's a draw
I need to keep track of this thing okay
it doesn't increase that quickly
but still
it's a pop
no this is just death
I guess this is a past too
I guess that is attractive
I'll be a bit more careful careful
we were talking about fighting
um yeah
sure I I'm Heat
I don't know if it's fighting we're
talking about
um
okay
if you can't jump and fly really far you
can go there
which I believe spiral wood
could do if you decide not to stand
again
what are you talking about fun fun I'm
talking about fighting I'm trying to
fight these enemies one-on-one that's
exactly what I'm talking about
do you like explosions
I can give you explosions
okay
so no enemies just explosions
didn't miss come from those before
here we go here's my enemies
from the enemies
that's the thing that drops those things
but I'm allowed to fight now
can you can you let me buy this dress
being one-on-one please
[Music]
what
I saw this tunnel here
a Sim account entries
but sure would it be fun to enter it
which is a door here okay
I'm pooping a kitten how dare you yeah
be careful about pooping a kitten
they might poop you back
[Music]
Melissa Tuesday
come on please jump up and attack
instead
yeah come on one on one
not
that
what to find you there you go
thank you for the fights that was a good
fight
now let's fight you and me
yeah come on
right there
thank you
thank you for the fight that was a good
one
now I got my eye on you still the mouse
thank you I always got an eye on that
Mouse
oh that wasn't oh is that the thing you
can do
[Music]
and I cannot
I thought you'd like that okay
look out of the world look at Spyro you
died
[Music]
I said that side defeat them
and more of them
now I know how to defeat you soon
okay
it's not bad
we're doing it
[Music]
yes
exactly I always keep an eye on the
mouse
never know what that Mouse is up there
that's how it was a bit crazy
I want to see what you do first
before I do anything crazy
oh just some enemies
yeah your body died
oh you're going to hit me
[ __ ]
[Music]
can you heat that from here
apparently that's actually come on
I can shoot you again
and again
[Music]
that was not part of my plan
[Applause]
trust me
thank you
which one I aim here there we go
how much damage this is still not much
can you can you stop eating me
I'm trying to attack you quite sure
eat someone
is stopped being stunned
[Music]
this is time for fighting not eating
I am blaming you at the moment can you
be stunned
quantity
his snake
criteria to not be stunned what what is
going on here
let me move on
let me upgrade first
as I'm starting to fill this up
Next Level done
okay
can I get over here
I think that answers it I cannot get
over there
no let's not do it because apparently
you cannot fly over there because he
somehow leaves your Olive fly abilities
so this is like
defeat all the enemies why is that SIM
card it's probably a part of that
you keep all the enemies people can
proceed
they respond with the enemies
even without defeat All Enemies I have
to
that worked
yeah there's
something I'm missing
thank you
okay
stop can you stop
being doing that
okay so I had to defeat a certain number
the silly little mouse
now we can break it maybe we should head
this way jadius
for now you can enter the king
Echo

[Music]
I'm gonna keep track this country now he
recovers today remember my training
training you didn't train I guess
fighting with bosses
yeah
yeah that's okay so you can break the
field
these vanities become Dark Souls I mean
hey
it does have
[Music]
some Vibes I think
and I played it myself
okay I need to figure out how to avoid
that attack
[Music]
big actors his product from a lot of
rings us guys
this game come out in 2006
huh
okay now I remember the voice after you
need a minute
no
okay
[Music]
okay I'm going to
[Music]
attract
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
Odysseus games
gems
[Music]
foreign
if I avoid that attack
get stuck in the eyes
okay I'm getting a sense of how to do
this
but of course this is just the first of
his three lives so
it's okay
but like providers we have a sports
Brady
why is it Nick showing to me
it doesn't show to me
do me
yeah okay I see that you have redeemed
it
but it doesn't show up on my activity
so I didn't know that
[Music]
I will correct that and then I will
forget about it
yeah I'm not sure why it didn't show up
it is weird everything is turned on so
I'll refresh it
still doesn't show up that's going to be
a bit annoying
but she'll get it eventually I think
yeah yeah
it shows up in this list I just get I
guess I had to pay attention please
since then now
there's a message to the boss like any
bus
yeah I yeah I'm I I would probably
figure it out
um I'm just messing around this moment
to see what works and doesn't work
[Music]
not really sure
okay so if I move away there's a bad
thing immediately
thank you
oh I see then I have to avoid that
attack okay I think I have something
[Applause]
[Music]
that's the uh
yeah I think that's hits by Icy
oh
[Music]
yeah
the biggest problem is that ice is
ground at the icing ground
[Music]
oh man
okay
I guess we have this
[Music]
there you go that's face one
and then it's just breathes out another
weapon
is this a checkpoint or do I have to
reduce the first phase look at the first
phase
so
[Music]
okay I see
[Music]
[Music]
okay there's a swing like that
very hard
in your writing
[Music]
yeah all right that's sweet
okay
um
doing that during this moment
all right
if it wasn't for the icing floor
[Music]
perfect
all right why are you doing
foreign
just find a way to avoid that attack
[Music]
he got stabbed
okay
let's do it
yep
welcome to that
and maybe I can jump over
no no you're doing that thing
[Music]
he wants you weren't supposed to do that
thank you
[Music]
okay I felt like I was quite trying to
add that
[Music]
how can you miss the bus he's huge
okay
[Applause]
all right
[Music]
[Music]
okay there we go phase two done
and it doesn't seem to feel so healthy
anymore
sword
and then use your fist I hope you're
holding a big sword
is she doing so
ready
[Music]
okay I'm going the wrong way
oh
can we not stand with these things I
can't move around
I guess I guess the hood
photos on the miraculous incredible
stupendous a dragon your size defeating
that dead thing thank you
Spyro a purple dragon named spiral
amazing of course there were
unsubstantiated rumors of a purple
dragon countless Generations ago but
most considered to hear say gossip
Legend it's hard to believe difficult to
Fathom amazing to comprehend
nor do they gag this guy
so many things have been learned and now
here he is standing right before me
excuse me Mr Vaude what what is it so
shouldn't we get going oh of course but
where to go back to the temple a friend
of yours is waiting ignite us he's
awesome
went really quickly
do you feel like I did the last part of
the like the last damage he just
randomly died
whatever so paying attention to the
health yes yes voltier it's good to see
you as well but we don't have time to
waste on sentiment back to Cinder
she was doing what to you
oh it's hard to be absolutely sure
ignite us but it seems she was using me
as some sort of suspended organic power
source huh she was using him as a
battery why didn't he just say so
she also left with a glowing yellow orb
and I believe that I somehow powered it
just mean anything to you ignite it
perhaps
perhaps
what I do know is that we need to rescue
the other Guardians
before Cinder can power any more of
those orbs I agree ignite us but first
I'd like to report some useful knowledge
to spiral these are the his recently
acquired electricity-based exhalation
device what well he says he'd like to
teach me some things about that
electricity breath boy why did you just
say so
because it has been three hours now
and it's for the next phase of the game
I'll save again
minus half 20 minutes for
does it count cutscenes
so
almost perfectly three hours that was
great
and since you only got like
10 minutes
on your redeem I guess I'll give you
the additional time tomorrow
that's good
it's something against weird I don't
know what
so
I'm ready to have
these tips thank you forgetting about
these tubes
I really need a second screen
yes
you should get that additional 20
minutes set no problem
but I'll just
pretend
you never use such a team
so three hour stream uh
I'm gonna drag and start it must be four
dragons in total considering the four
different power-ups so I assume there's
two more dragons
and then of course you've seen
in there which is that hard
I don't remember
I played this game once but I don't
remember
I'm just guessing
so there's plenty more to the game
let's see how long this takes
so
I guess we'll
do a little
a little red I think does that that
sound cute
this is someone I had watched a few
times
and now as Esther Lux
it's really nice
same only playing each of them they're
just playing against once and that was
forever gone whenever I played it first
and I played the Third
and if I say just a kill I haven't
played this second one
they're really good games I
I wouldn't say Legend of Spyro
the first the first one I play now I
wouldn't say it's like
I don't
I mean I'm playing through it so it's
not terrible in that sense but
it uh beautiful games there are also
quite awkward visuality
I'm still playing too it's like it's
still entertaining good I don't know
until 90 towards the end that would be
fun I feel like
we'll see how that goes
so
yeah
we'll visit
the purple unicorn I was about to say
dragon I guess I guess both unicorns and
dragons have horns
and different number of ones
and
yeah he's he's playing funk I start
raining which I've noticed a lot of
people are playing
so I assume it's a recent game I have no
I don't keep track of new games
having you on here
I I should see if I can make uh so I can
see the chat pattern for for tomorrow
I'll make a solution for that
and same time tomorrow I will continue
the game
and oh yeah completely forgot the
my funny read message
yeah that was that
