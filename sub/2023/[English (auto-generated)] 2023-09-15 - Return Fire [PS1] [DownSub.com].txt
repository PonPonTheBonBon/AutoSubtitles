we have Flint works
we will see it's only working
let's go music hopefully it's not too
loud I think this game can be quite loud
it is quite loud
[Music]
not not the best audio quality
bloody hell I'm Dash well it wasn't that
loud okay I mean it wasn't louder than
my voice but it's louder than other
games I had
yeah he had so much time so that was
mini stampede
Diamond software is definitely not
silent that's Canada
yeah yeah here's the intro here's the
game even though it's midnight
too busy talking nothing running yeah
foreign
[Music]
[Applause]
hopefully the game is fun enough I
haven't played this game for years
hard of hearing now oh it sounds like
you need to crank up the volume of
whatever device you see
so uh blank screen
oh there we go
this game doesn't really use text
it does contain contain
instructions in many languages
including Persian which is a very rare
language on how many how that's the
question how many Playstation One games
have a Persian translation
the other languages I know of but
and why didn't they include the emblem
for Spanish
that's the name of the game which causes
no polish try this game is terrible
exactly it doesn't contain polish but it
can't take pressure and so I'm not
really sure what's going on
and that wasn't that wasn't back
where's my backpack and there's the back
button
and that's um does not have a whole
controller
and and the face buttons are kind of
rotated everything is rotated on that
controller I think the control is broken
playing in Mexican
oh yeah there was Mexican Spanish and
this European Spanish it also had the
UK English and US English uh
I have looked through both of those
that's actually an interesting point
or maybe even someone else knows because
it's kind of funny because they have the
two options
and as far as science I know and I I
guess this adds to the terribleness of
the game as far as I know there is no
there's no spelling difference because
it says here well is it helicopter tag
or armored support vehicle that did not
spell armor in the name British way so
what's the point of the British language
option
anyway let's let's begin this game the
cake one this is just basically a
tutorial level to show what what goal of
the game is
being I'm getting dizzy
so you have has I said the three tank
helicopter or not support vehicle as
well as
a Jeep
I don't need anything other than I need
for this lemon
yeah
it is tank controls but you can use
non-tech controls but I think
all right to actually don't know what I
prefer
because the camera is in a fixed
position where's the fine button that's
the fire button
nice never it's it's supported it's
supposed to aim mathematically to the
closest object
and then you break this building
and they're going to be
there's going to be things around there
and then we pick it up with the Heap
only the Heap can pick it up very nice
please
and then you basically drive it back to
the base it's captured the flag
yeah there we go
here again
it's personal
yes it
it was such a difficult task that
was so lucky I got through that
yes it's Passion of the worldwide
language or is it
we started Scottish education thing a
person is
not like a massively widespread like I
think
let's save on
and do that same
I don't think I need the same does it
say my progress that's the question
then when we're into next level
curl up and die
if the first video
then I I wanted to have curl up and died
I said that sounds a bit
yeah the UK language is so colorful
will be spelled right now they didn't
well the ukules of spelled arm Ward as
armored
it has Affinity I hate that excuse me
do you think they're pretty good yeah
yeah don't do PS1 as well
destroying the moon and it will play
after you destroy the correct building
that's the it's it's random which
building it um it's that type of
building but it's random but it is so in
this case I had to bring up the map
but this music in this level
so I'm the red team and the opponent is
Green Team can I kind of reverse of what
you might have expected
when I'm more like the brown I actually
think it's brown team
so there's my base which is barely
anything and then there's the enemies
and the number six have to go to get
goes through this
so how about
using a health coach or something
I don't know
what only
venues are
this is Strife so this is irritates oh
this is weird
wait a minute
okay I can't this is this is weird
you can choose the controls
I didn't shoot
if you're not supposed to shoot when you
land
okay you can adjust now you can't you
can't adjust the strafing option
I did oh well I guess I'll just have to
get used to it
you got the machine this game isn't PG
I mean according to Twitch it's it's all
ages so don't worry
yeah I
yeah here we go
oh no I'm getting attacked already
get out of the way
it doesn't leave me looking at me
where's the button there's the
button
move
oops and they start the wrong building I
don't think I was supposed to destroyed
that one
I don't think this is efficient way of
destroying this
oops
oops
our time today I feel like the luckiest
man uh was I believe Louis
Gary farewell speech when he retired
from baseball after
Contracting and yeah it did not it
looked like a sporting event so I'm not
really sure why that was that was ruined
okay let's move in with the tank instead
and I said about well how do you say
that
if I have tries well carries well carers
but you know I don't speak English okay
I'm destroying this with helicopter I'll
damage this with the helpful thing
no I'm I'm under attack
here we go
uh let me go
there are black humans in these
buildings
and you can I guess it's not visible due
to it was on the road or something
let's remove this complete as you can
see in the person there you go there's
blood in this game
but it's
twitch does not consider this to be
not allowed for children
so
it's perfectly defined but my plan is a
18 plus anyway so
and then you can steal some fuel from
the base and some
some
some munition
oops oops didn't mean to you people
sorry about that hope you don't mind
I don't recognize the words instant
remember if it's his formal speech that
I'm sure it was
nice Associates the end of the
Mighty tax
yeah
I don't see the towers on the map
but didn't mean to shoot you and also
destroyed One hospital and yeah the some
reason
the towers does not show up on
the map
but they do show up when I on the mini
map but they did show up when I was
using the helicopter
probably got another one here
yeah I'm taking so much damage at the
moment
can I
okay
now I don't want to exit
so you can
also have been could bring up the map or
something but no there's no such option
you can only view the map from the base
so
the StoryBots
the
okay
then my tank is almost destroyed
hopefully the flying is in here yes it
is now I just need to pick it up with
the
and let's just try a bit more with the
um
don't mind the the tent is being
destroy it don't mind the destruction
here
did you just hit that person with a tank
I did run over two people who thanks
with a tank yes
that happened
munition yes that's what the game called
it so
there we go this one did not shoot
I lost a helicopter
try the clothes
let's go
this is the Flight of the Bumblebee
what was the song for the tank
90 meter run around the whole place
there we go
now
when I had the flag
I guess in-game is not too loud I could
adjust the game volume big
game is still kind of loud
maybe you like the music
[Music]
[Music]
why is it playing a bit more in the Left
Channel
my Instagram
they have more videos
I've seen I've seen one other video
so I'm not sure
does it give me any form of confirmation
well I should write down the like the
password I think
did
the password
which is
smiling
the
funniest
umbrella
Mickey's a bunny
in case it doesn't save this game
remembers this game remembers what the
name I inserted crash it does not
oh yeah I can see which one I completed
by the the name brother
should I continue to the next World or
should I do every level in the world I
I'll leave that up to you
in it yet
I'll continue with this level every
level yes I mean it's one thing yeah I
did I didn't know how terrible this game
would be that's that's no this is map
so as you see the building at the bottom
up screen how does it show up on
thing by the way
I'm a silly if not if you're checking
that
and bunny game is a little yeah
let me adjust the
viewing area of this screen by the way
I felt the game the game is loud and
quiet
uh
this game does not have any
uh on like any area of the screen that
is not available
so and to the to to the bottom of the
main island
uh there is the plus sign that is the
building that contains the flag there
are places where multiple such buildings
exist
so let's start with the help of chicken
so this is my base
so
I think I've wanted to move over this
thing with the car with the Jeep
Don't Shoot Me
and then I'm going to go down here
and I don't think this one would cost me
much this year but
I mean you can't it can't speed around
this game I guess
now get out of the way get off to me
there it is but I got two towers here
now I'm dead
I survived
no I'm dead no I get stuck oops
oops
Daniel Bryan is coming well let's let's
clear the hair stuff with me this level
doesn't seem to have much
I guess this is the first like okay the
first world I'm calling it the world but
the first one had the
they don't have long range days they
just disappear
on the new
redestroid
a bit a bit hard to navigate with the
tank here
coming through
let's remove the tree
was in my way I destroyed some trees
here and then let's not mind that
if I'm careful enough you know they
did the tower shoots me from this
distance
nice
dinner
this is shooting up
it's also shooting up
this is shooting forward
this is rotating the turret
oh this is full okay this is a full
screen
which I guess is useful
maybe no I don't think so
and I think I pressed every single
button now
so that's all the buttons next there's
one button says nothing
there we go
hydrate yes
back at the about
Iris that's my new pronunciation and
also plays in the center around the
Third
it's the Henry tickets
I hope you are happy with that
stupid building
let's get rid of this building
I have some demolitions here
now
now I'm done to throw grenades at me
the different vehicles have different
amount of Health they pass
one hit point
speaking of Hallelujah Hallelujah
also it's a song in season
is this song what is this song
what song is this
[Music]
ah volume television yes yes of of
virtue of bacteria
yes I recognize the name
[Music]
um
they wouldn't play the same ending video
now
maybe to say media hopefully skip it
nothing's as long yeah it's the same now
you can skip it and why is it always the
same
Pawn
why did it make that sound
foreign
did say that it was using the
some resource for
and then there's this song in the bass
which I could make like
the music louder but there's no settings
for that this General Music Volume I
guess
still one place
I wonder when the time starts when when
the game like when you can start moving
around or when you leave the platform
well these are close to the base
what is my place close to these
there we go
yeah these two are from the map on the
mini map
and this one is a bit close to the
bridge I could destroy the bridge but
that wouldn't be good for me
[Music]
okay and then I just move up here
okay this goes pretty one
it's almost like I'm better at this I
say as I'm getting destroyed forward
man
explode there we go
as you know everything collects Bloods
okay so there's just one left
but I didn't really destroy
I didn't know if it destroyed everything
let's move on with the tank which also
has quite a
quiet
theme oh let's destroyed that one not me
this was a pretty quick lemon
this is getting used to
let's destroy this thing is it going to
annoy me
now I'm going to take the turn there
they're speed running
here we go
anyway let's destroy these let's destroy
these let's move on back to base
it is if you're speed running you really
should do this instead
not even the uh
the uh you lost a vehicle the screen
pops up save me even more time
you're turning
oh come on
there we go now we can move on
all right they started quite well
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
stored on the dashboard of the car or
something
like this anyway let's move on well
I'm not drunk I promise
[Music]
another level completes soon
yeah it's always I don't know is this
game broken or it's the only video I
have in the whole game
what is it
I don't know what he's doing the wheels
Agony how many yeah it is the last last
name
yay
that's probably undefeated in the game
uh this uh because this game seemed this
version of the game seems to be the most
uh
I don't need so I don't need to get rid
of like six of these towers to be on the
same side
and
these the PlayStation one game seems to
be the most
I actually don't know the piece of it
although the pizza version does not run
on the computer
yeah
no I probably don't need to take care of
those
okay well well move forward
turn turn
ing Runway
now I'm pressing back reverse
there we go
oh almost died there
was this turn oh there's another one
here who is this terrible
pilot
but yeah six as I said six of these the
hair is 76. well
you must spin
what you miss me
[Music]
can you catch me
I couldn't
[Music]
oh no oh no
I'm I'm out of munition
[Music]
I went
another haircut is broken see today
weird Holocaust
I win
this is planning
yeah I wonder if the level increases the
difficulty right now it's kind of yeah I
mean it is
many many words left
with me to move in with the tank
like I haven't even used the armored
support again
nothing because I think with the armored
sport vehicle is that it has like Minds
I don't really know what the point is
there is a multiplayer mode and that
makes more sense
but of course local split screen
multiplayer
it could be fun to play with someone
doing like
a collab with someone
whoops
where you because because it is
let's say
let's do uh what was it calling in
sometimes I forgot the name
let's fast travel to the base there we
go
so because the point
okay I assume later down the line you
might be chased by any vehicles I hope
this like other kind of vehicles and
stuff we'll see I haven't like I've only
played the demo of this game there's no
enemy vehicles in the demo but the demo
only contains like two levels which is
the first level
and
another level which I have not yet got
into
[Music]
neither of which contains anime vehicles
but we'll see
and maybe we have to fight cheats and
vehicles this one yeah that would be fun
to have to fight
p o n
I don't know there we go now it works I
don't know what this game is weird
anyway that's
all of the lemons
did curl up and die he said your name
next one
David Jones Jeep
this one looks interesting though looks
quite different from the previous
diamonds
it has like green lines and stuff what
is it what is this oh there's at the
bottom the bottom Island
which is flashing red now
oh my God it starts Luke Gary apparently
oh there's walls now
oh my
so what's the point of the left side
so anyway
this is interesting
let's move in with the this one instant
[Music]
and listen to the music of this vehicle
is so slow though
this is a strong air
it is slowing
okay well let's minimum that building
well I collated with building let's
remove it
oh I can't drive with this vehicle
apparently
but it doesn't it actually doesn't have
mines
I sorry people I need to
up squish to your team
I mean it's going to steal your minutes
in here
oh no they're shooting everywhere
like crazy
right
I know
yeah the on the map when you take damage
and it shows the red circle for how much
damage you've taken so you can't see
your house you can only see how the when
you take damage
and
the piece here it fades out on the PC
version it does not so
they do feel like
the the PS1 version is the most uh the
highest quality version
I'm going with this one now did I
destroy enough I hope so
big tank I don't know bunny Strife
thanks well it's there
what license do I need to drive a tank
my current license only allows me to
drive vehicles that are at my Max marks
made of
three it's aiming for it no I didn't
destroyed the wrong one a maximum weight
of 3 500 kilograms
I'm sneaking away with this one
so no with my current line since I
cannot drive a tank
[Music]
Jeep
[Music]
Destiny password
let's let's write it down here if it is
Canyon
please
War again
that's password I was wait
oh yeah
that's that's it it depends me wrong and
apparently when you use the uh
okay I'm going this way this time token
resistance
there we go
K9 powerply
Fogle and Fogle there you go that's
English right
yeah I'm going to take this one and I'm
going to destroy everything
destroy
[Music]
Mr High
I'm going to destroy you on
I'm gonna destroy the Wallace of land
because it got in the way
it's a tank to tank
I don't know I don't know if that's an
expression in use here
when you feel
that that that's what he is that might
be a Swedish word though
you say that when you're filling up your
car you used to use the verb tank
or in Swedish would be tanka
not the coffee space which is a very big
thank you
which is distinct
okay all right this
is
very quite the tracks are very unevening
with how loud they are
I can't do much about that
tanka fill the tank yeah thank the car
I did this very do I get full health
back
but yeah I know it gets full there
all the munition back
which apparently got instantly as soon
as it went down
and it restarts the music suddenly I
wanted to continue
look you can go through here
there's a tower here sorry people wait
they're wrapped people in that one well
sorry about that red people well at
least you don't attack me unlike the
green people
evil green people
can I shoot it here no and then I need
to turn there you go ah
that does mean that
you could let your people out of that
building poising them out the
uh to attack an enemy vehicle doesn't
seem like the most efficient way but
here's an idea
so let's destroy this one and this one
is that one of them
let's destroy this one
but look the flag was in there seeing
the flag let's destroy these ones
oh this is like that
I think that's one of them
you can't get through here
let's do this
let's let's speed around the game
oh yeah
I thought it was like
um an option to abandon vehicle with
apparently not if you run off a fuel the
car character will abandon the vehicle
at least the PC version I don't know how
it works in this game
hey
that's at least in the demo which could
also work differently from the final
release
there we go let's switch track
if you want to speed around the game
because there are times for how long you
can be alone
I guess you should see if you can rough
in with the car and survive with the car
so and rush out
like not destroying those towers and
trying to consider them without taking
damage
[Music]
I had to commit genocide wait
I did not commit genocide when the song
came on I was just destroyed what's this
[Music]
nice
I was just destroying an empty building
with a flag inside of it oh this looks
interesting
it's just that I can say strong
it doesn't play when I
I said
like if I take this
let's try it out
so you're gonna 100 this game I guess so
this is a map a pack
if I take the Jeep over here which I
can't
I'm gonna continue with the Jeep ah like
this
I think past those things
I think I grew up here
and then I just have to get rid of these
that's one I don't want on the other
side
that
there we go
and then I picked it up and then I go
home
one song I want to learn to play on
planet is that Bumblebee song
you start restart the song okay
well I think I can destroy this one just
to be on the same side I don't think I
need to but it would be a shame if it
shoots down the car
yes you only have to shoot the car once
wait there are no roads here but yeah
it's really nice
isn't it
usually there are there we go I shot
but I have to practice a lot since I
can't find fast anymore
um
okay
here we go
this is slow
well take a drink
does not have a map
yeah
and flight out of the Valkyries well
well cries has a very scary time
signature oh
26 000 points uh can I put on another
I'll give you something to spend this
point some eventually Don't Shoot Me
finale I guess gather up some points
oh
more
okay okay
they like the screen it that one points
me towards the flag
that means I'm going towards flag at
least
so I'm not going out out to see
yeah yes here it is
well
this is how you do it
[Music]
I just didn't realize how slow it was on
water but I'm committed it now so I have
to finish this
[Music]
thank you
oh there's a very close to that one
[Music]
and this song is loud at least
yeah right well
I'm curious I need to look up how to say
that
is in a 9 8 signature
[Music]
well I know it's like nine beats per
measure or something like that
may not be super in the machine the
whole notes about eight minutes but
there's a whole lot
has been seeing a tower at my own town
this whole notes man
[Music]
today's
eighth notes is one ninth of a machine
is weird
anyway moving on
Mystery Island
wait there's a there's a light
spots up there
amazing
now
sit on in one place where what's the
point
oh you don't miss Courtney knows should
be worse
to be since there are always four
quarter notes per hunger
but yeah
a quarter note is
since a beat is defined to be eighth
notes and a quarter note is two eight
notes that mean uh coordinates two piece
that makes sense
well
no more thank you
King
oh I'm getting destroyed
I'm getting destroyed
yep
that didn't go as well as planned
my half notes are four bits yep because
uh
I can't think I got an explanation for
what the point of the whole
nine eights
thing wise but I forgot what it was
because all I see is that while it's
nine beats permission that's the one and
the the eighth notes are the Beats
there we go
okay this game isn't given mucho
challenge at the moment
[Music]
I'm ever playing High School interior
section where the times here would
change in each measure or at most to
imagine
when that's
something
since I had the obviously it would be
very hard for people to change and I
will not donated and I'm not demanding
any change but the idea was to have uh
uh a note that represents a Beat
[Music]
and then you have half beat and double
beat and so on
and then you only specify how many beats
there are permission and there you go
it's basically what it is now
[Music]
the game is challenging just perfect
then nothing is challenging for her
thank you I think you're corrected
right
come on there we go
this is when the timer before I can
press save or something
the one mission was
for the next was let's say for it then
by four all right
well you have the next one
but if I for again two two for some
reason and then there was four three
here we go this is the uh Corner this is
the second
sink
this was the uh
the second level you could play on
the demo
so
might they might not be
so this time we actually have two
buildings
I think this is the level
because now I got a little base here but
there is nothing isn't it it's just that
this platform to spawn from
and a lot of lots of powers defending
from nothing
um
so what I will do
is move around the whole thing
so much
then
nope get out of here
that means that it was not impacting as
far as I know it's not always in the
last building in the building you
destroy I don't know it was
predetermined which one it should be
don't think the game is cheating as I
have found out what's that supposed to
kill
is it hidden here
no yes it is
in that case it must be in this one
uh
well
I've never seen pump on faith in the
challenge
well
well we'll see about that
I did fail C3 racing I didn't complete
that game I could go back to it
that was my awful attempt
lasting rotate fly
like a bird
okay
I will destroy that
then I will destroy these
that's my step
oh wow getting camels
no I thought this no
I'm gonna hold it
that's the skull wow
[Music]
that is it it is a dead green Soldier
last thing as well
in one more try
I got one more helicopter than just
wasting helicopters I hope they don't
mind
here we go
throwing everything here
except this thing I need to destroy
there we go
let's clean up here
yeah I know
she destroyed okay out of elimination I
should destroy the trees like a marking
you know where I should go
obviously I've read next goals since
it's missing half his teeth
you don't think it lost
all those teeth in the battle
or whatever it was that cost
cost it's to die nice driving straight
into the one
okay don't shoot me don't shoot me
please don't shoot me
it goes straight down here
go
let me go back
and please shoot me again without this
applies on the way back
whoa that was close
yeah
well
[Music]
I did it
oh ants
yeah it's probably more exciting in this
game today I like it I guess I could add
some commentary funny commentary there
you go this this is the password
umbrella
bunny
in Japanese
I guess it's to unlock the five
let's see
wading food wadding pool I'm enjoying
this game because after me sick
yeah I guess
the music gets a bit varied because of
the different vehicles but at the same
time repetitive because it's almost the
same music or the same vehicles
now I got one building is as the base
he decided to be the very little okay
let's see what building it is I'll start
with the north one
oh it sees me
please don't shoot
wait where was supposed to go again
I don't even remember did I go too far
yeah I did 25.
[Music]
stop shifting me
about
okay that did not work
I'm not good at using the helicopter I
need some more practice I think
okay
one more train
go go help up there
I got one wait did you see
foreign
except the thing I might need to shoot
I win
you've seen him watching families
go go helicopter
I don't know
Coco Power Ranger
go back in
it's not in that building abandoned
again not in the North one
let's see if there's a trend it was
always the second one I picked what is
the second one
then I'm loaded up with more munition
price in here
well I mean it must be in this one
because I just want to
oh no
well no more helicopters
I guess
I guess I'll move in with the tank I
should have checked the map
okay let's see if we can
get out of here
with the tank here we go
let me through
that's an all day
a red General has requested get out of
my way bully
people spawn in the top left corner
almost empty
let me through
missing so many shots
there we go

let's remove those I don't get stuck on
the toes
and deflect should be in this building
yes there's a
okay so there's some more here
I know
an enemy
Valley Remus welcome
to joined and abusive he's happy yeah
I've got some epic music in here I think
I need to move in with another tank
guess people are enjoying the music
hello
oh the very dramatic music or something
[Music]
so we found it anyway yeah anyway they
come one the worst one arriving there
okay probably need to get rid of these
otherwise they will
destroy the car
the enemy vehicle is patrolling there
synaptic Cannon I don't know where I'm
aiming anyway
okay let's get rid of this one
okay
anyone else wanna
taste some munition you maybe
you don't seem to care much though
okay so I think the road is clear for
I want to be in the Jeep
down from it could be this one but I've
seen some
um well is fine I know my name is too
much
what's wrong with your belly remix
that's just perfectly good name
I didn't see any yeah I mean I can't
call you one then
but I have no problem with saying cool
names and also I do do you like to say
full names at least like at least when
people show up I like to see some names
and then I can go with nicknames let's
see if this works now
oh yeah right
there we go
the Jeep can't go over rocks smaller
rocks
here we go oh my
this game thank you
too many objects on screen
place is one Compound on it
but reverse
a way that we should should not move
into that place you're dead then
let's take this path
now wait we should not we should not no
no no no we should not move towards the
cannons
it seems like a stupid idea
[Music]
did it
all right I did it
[Music]
I win
there we go
see me every time
took almost eight minutes there we go
celebrations are waiting for the start
versus wadding pool
shortcuts
kind of hard to see how many
buildings there are but when I select
the map and check it from the map of the
base spin spin spin don't get sick
there's only one
what's the shortcut
you know what
I have an idea
red wigglings
I have an idea
or a shortcut
and also I forgot
um there we go
I have a different meaning in this one
never destroying that and then I move up
here oops I'm shooting too far
shooting me
that's very beautiful
well well
I'm under attack
I'm over attack
[Music]
no I didn't mean to shoot that thing
[Music]
don't find me dog shoot me no
no no no no no no no no
well it died
with my final I
crashed onto the tower
okay when
watch right
go and send a text to Deep
and move up here
through here
up here
up here
all right
I need to get rid of these this guy
and then I
do agent of these
yeah
and then
see if I can
do this
and then I continue up here
instead
move around
we need to get rid of this one though
no no no
foreign
offer it to the
let me offer it
yeah I don't think the
whoever is in charge with the economy is
a fan of me wasting so much resources
yo
it didn't go as planned
what do you manage shitty things well
oh
boom
okay that is
did something I guess
with the Epic tank music
I I don't hear an epic type music
building up the snow knee
sorry about that
hope you didn't mind
let's just get rid of this building
excuse me sir
another one didn't do anything but you
know to be empty
so
whoa
I just need to get in here somehow
let's just
make a gap here
then I just need to get rid of these
huh enemy
enemy there we go enemy's gone
here we go
foreign
anyway let's pick up the flags
let's see if I'm thank blew up if
someone shot it
and I was kind of really tough time to
do
I know I know I know oh that was close
it's seeing the explosion how about
going around the building yeah okay
nothing extremely I've seen the
explosion right in front of the Jeep
one hits and the Jeep is gone
damn
no I'm stuck
yeah they should release an update now
they should have made it so the Jeep
doesn't collide with anything when their
buildings fully destroyed
all right
[Music]
it's karaoke now but but without lyrics
[Music]
karaoke foreign
instrumental songs
[Music]
into my brain so they have to land it
place it on the platform
[Music]
another level down
another level
down down
come on let me say I'm saying
there you go
I think I didn't know where these games
are weird cross pair
now this is the level of the demo so it
was the correct world we just I just
yeah don't let it felt weird this is the
level of me because this level
are still not the exact level
it might have been this level but
modified
now I didn't want to press that button
that was wrong button
this level but modified I think in it
it definitely looks like this level or
maybe maybe there's a later level maybe
there's another level of the world which
is similar looking
so I go here
go down here
yeah this does not look like the
equipment that I'm seeing up
well I'm trying to avoid that
get out of my way
go
me a death pass
then I guess so yes oh a single power
ending the flag
see the other level has like three
pounds
stop shooting me
of course you could argue that I should
stop shooting you but
that's not how we play this game
[Music]
well well get the shot
someone is causing me problems here
too far
okay
there we go
now let's get
rid of the building
let's clear up a path here
it's starting to throw grenades at a
helicopter
I am out I'm out of diminishing anyway
it should be clear where I should go
when it comes the missile destroy his
dreams
yeah take a missile stupid person
every let's get out of here
there you go take the stones gently
I have completed one level without
losing anything
which was the level without anything
other than the I mean flag
but that's a challenge though they could
have completely energy level without
losing enemy because
I know that's not a challenging game
luckily
so I don't have to do that
pick up the flag there we go they're
cheap
and then don't get stuck now we need to
get the other here
[Music]
by the way I'm supposed to go there
uh
a bit confused where I'm supposed to
kill
I'm moving into the enemy base
yeah here my basements
again 13
who needs more
[Music]
complete the lemon
Vehicles without having any of your
buildings destroyed even though I the
opponent don't attack you but that's it
doing this like multiplayer split screen
which the game has to be screened
there we go okay
next month
what
what what what is this
this one
okay let's go to this chessboard
that way wait wait so
presumably the king is a lot of fair
9 Billings
points yeah with fancy agent
well
okay let's let's take the Harley cap
there
in a pink helicopter
I don't like this video song
lyrics of it
I'm going to
Checkmate you
so many oh there they are
whoa
one of these buildings
well not that one not that one
not that one
okay I probably need some strong
wow this is
yep
there's one way to describe it
French natural information I must say
but just straight down
so there we have them
watch out I'm coming through
thank you
there we go ah stop shooting me that's
pretty rude
oh wait there's a stronger no I'm
getting stuck and I'm getting attacked
at the same time there's a bad combo
they are destroying it shiny
I need to take out these these
ow
and this tank is gonna take private
across the point why did it take too
long
yeah it would be nice for that road that
it went straight down
because roads don't show up on the maps
and the map will still look like a chess
point
I think
yeah he's not doing me quickly
but it is moving
go
I can't do those things
let's get rid of you let's get rid of
you
let's get rid of you yes shoot thank you
and then
oh
I'll tell you
don't shoot me while I'm shooting these
buildings
pretty rude of you
whoa whoa whoa what are you doing
okay
oh
you can't even attacking the curfew here
you can't even know it
wrong buttons
okay one one last I'm going to run out
of big ones
I lost three after nine attacking
vehicles I think it was three
I think I used
one helicopter I think
moving down towards the
okay let's
get rid of this one so it doesn't shoot
me
and I would like to like get rid of this
things that the Jeep doesn't Collide
stuff
no
preemptive stuff
which one of these
go get rid of that get up that
whoa whoa
enemies are stronger
what is it or miss the last one that's
not how it worked in the
no it's not always the last time is it
bad if I need
but this gets rid of moves crashing so I
can reach it easier
yes I have
munition this way
whoa whoa whoa
stop it well nice nice accuracy there
yeah I'm
yeah oh no another one
come here
oh I got this again outside screen
I'm not nice
but I'm dying
yeah okay no more of those
I need a second coffee number three
now I do have two helicopters but I
think this is an opportunity to get the
plank
please remove the some beats more to be
on the same side
should just be it should be just as
simple as moving
straight down
and now I should have this queen
let's see because it's something now
it's the camera is panning down
why does it have to be that one
there we go
no I don't need now I can
bring up the heart again
[Music]
the camera was slow on their fake that
was one of the selling points in the
back of the the Box and that the camera
is panning and
zooming to show you the necessary action
it did not defeat in this game
[Music]
there we go that was an interesting
level
something interesting
oh there we go nice pass away these were
so far and it's David in case it doesn't
say my progress you never know
burnt the butts but
that is the password
the mine land
don't you mean Minecraft
wait are they mines
that would be interesting because I oh
now we're getting something so some
interesting stuff here wait on a three
weeks wait
that's uh oh you only got
yeah
um in the demo or PC version don't know
which I mean I played the demo on the PC
version Oh Boop
hi Pawn oh is it is it as is it now
you're saying yeah this will be your
second month was it the automatic I
think I wrote that on the server I don't
know if you need money alert Magic
see Miss if you do it manually you get
Steve
of course it's just for your own
wait Vladimir moves wait no that was a
butterfly I mean uh butterfly
so in a PC version you have or maybe
it's just the uh multiplayer mode where
you have
an eight
Jeeps
government's a bit crazy here I think so
this is the first level
that was a little bit quickly
all right so this is not bad in the past
no it was
now it was burnt the butterfly butterfly
come on
I didn't want to move next
last Jeep
I like it removed a lot
because it's kind of
goes on the road I don't like that
wait
how am I supposed to get to the building
oh wait
it's throwing in the wrong way
no don't shoot me
okay this this thing doesn't
yeah I think that's game away
fine can you actually drive apparently
not
uh I want to try actually first first
level I paid that
and if you mean in real life yes I do
have a driver's license just a regular
standard
B license
B
or driving Vehicles standard personal
vehicles
or classified up to well like maximum
number of seats is like seven or six I
don't remember
okay I will do this I will I will offer
this vehicle I will I will come across
this straight interacting
that whoa that explosion
it became a challenge same here mine's a
Class C license
I don't know it
now it's now it's not a challenge
anymore
Island exploding
yep all the vehicles up to classified
after 3 500 kilograms
[Music]
and
it's going to the exact same exact yeah
exact meeting every single time
12 minutes 11 seconds
same same same thing yeah it's time it
was amazing
No Man's Land it looks like he lands of
the green
um
no no
I don't want to click
they have that menu too
aborts
or leave the door
leaves through the door
but they should have the option to
because they have a single option which
is adjust the loudness of music
which is at Max at the moment
the main biggest problem is that the
different tracks have so it's a varied
volume
why am I destroying this stop shooting
me
no
because I don't even know
if the flag is in here of course it
isn't
of course it isn't
[Music]
because why would it
[Music]
that would be convenient
oh it's wasting
[Music]
and that way I don't shoot
what am I supposed to go now down there
okay so I should be able to sneak
um
anyway
I don't have time to go around the trees
I'll destroy the trees
let me Sue
let me Sue
I just I was gonna say this is the red
one no it had the Reds
the red scene on top of it
you can't shoot me I'm behind the
building
well you can shoot me I'm no longer
behind the building
there we go
where am I going oh yeah I know now I
know I'm killing
I'm going down here
stop shooting me I'm dying
game
no I'm getting I'm getting shot at from
every angle
stop this
when Team Buddies
so they yeah it has an industry of doing
split screen but then
um
he's gonna clear out that road here
um
there we've got let's get rid of this
one because it annoys me because it's an
enemy
I love you too
yeah I destroyed everything
is destroyed
they are trying to defend this thing and
now I'm stuck
[Music]
across
because I'm not going today with the GPS
probably going to just get stuck on
these scenes
Let's cross crush this thing you played
it before I played the demo I'm not
playing through the the whole game
you can get quite far into the water
hey I recognize this song too I think it
is
comment on every single song that plays
in the game
or is it stuttering now for some reason
now it's zooming out
oh it says that it's running game will
not stable and frame rate so
okay
one just drowning thank you yeah I mean
they say it's faster automatically you
know you don't do that to it quickly get
home
I think it's lagging here just because
of the amount of trees PlayStation two
it's placing one can't handle the trees
[Music]
yes I want to thank home too
[Music]
I mean I don't get any rewards for
having a tank
probably means 55 seconds
Next Level 6 minutes and 66 seconds
wait Green's Revenge wait why are they
getting revenge
I have not done anything bad to the
greens
please comes like confirmed
seven minutes six seconds no no six
minutes six six seconds
oh wait
there's one empty Island
in one area then that is the one
building is protected hopefully it's in
the empty Island
and some officer above video hate to
deal with her music thank you anyway
yeah that's not my problem
I'll just report it as missing I just
reported this
well someone didn't
counted wrong in the inventory
the attack never existed
it's not in that one
what I'm missing
Hallelujah
[Music]
how am I
there is an interesting idea for for a
game like this
oh let's switch over to these
this if you were if if the if the
vehicles you lost
so it counts
destroy nothing
there we go it counts which vehicles you
have lost in the level
and then those those vehicles are not
available in late levels but you can go
back and redo that level and not lose
the vehicle
and then that vehicle won't be lost in
that level in the future
yeah they will be available
it would probably need more than just
three of each vehicle at that point
yeah I don't hey tooth like pushes
but yeah so you have a total of certain
number of vehicles never say game like
that
with the different cute animals
suddenly I don't know the name of it
I think they escaped from a zoo and then
the girl wants to get home
here we go
and in the game you had a certain number
of uh
animals in total and then it was
platforming games so it's perfect for me
to play
and then
you could also use their dead bodies as
platforms
so but it counted how many animals died
in each level and that reduced the
number of animals he had available for
the next levels
[Music]
and then
but you can go back to previous level
and complete it while having less
animals die and that means you have more
animals when you try to play
yeah I hope it makes sense
remember the name of the game it's a
it's a flash game so
if I can find it
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I wonder which which one of those two
buildings is in
let me
how they made it so it's never in the
very first building in the story let's
let's start with destroying the tip with
the more difficult building and
I was lying here nothing
it's not in that one okay
um
but white bunnies are very crappy
well what do you mean by that
whatever's wrong with what's wrong with
pink bunny
white one is a kid too I like those
white bunnies and pink bunnies
so the reason why the Jeep is amphibious
is because you should not if you destroy
this bridge for example and you can
still access the
this island because the Jeep is in
amphibious but you can't bring the
attack here though
okay I need to destroy his Towers now
one less shooting at me okay
I'm not a pink rabbit that is true I am
not a pink rabbit or that is not a pink
I mean that is me I mean are we on the
screen at the moment
because it I mean it is feral
but the RAM
but the Peril pump on do you have pink
on her
and I don't mean the pink bow because
that's an accessory and with her ears
are pink
and I'm I'm not saying pink wrap is up
better than white rabbits
so with these destroyed
there we go there it is
let's just get rid of the vegetation
just in case
I don't think this one would cause
issues but you never know
you never know
let's go back
and bring auntie
licking sugar
wait what happened
sugar into popcorn and plant one into
Barrel pumpkin
that's a wobbly wooden oh don't shoot me
I mean it's a peaceful Jeep not doing
anything wrong here
I didn't really have to just join the
rest
it was fun to destroy
[Music]
um
easy
[Music]
today
p o m
God see
come on the same I hope they're more fun
devils
but
like the chess moving on to Warrant
seats going through this game quickly
Long Island
it is a Long Island
so my starting position up there and
it's kind of close to the enemies
yeah this game should have a
there's two of them
okay let's destroy the north one as you
should
there will be a lot of helicopters at
just a moment
please
please Emma oh
mines it must not that one let me out
today
[Music]
man
today I can't see myself the luckiest
man the face of Earth
I gotta head out so have a good rest of
the dance
thank you for being here yet and have a
good day you too
and thank you for
being here maybe I said it
you are funny and I like you
I like everyone here
we're listening
I don't remember I did
not get to get a rid of that one
that is
okay well
I'm shooting nothing
lying around oh I got hit
I'm shooting me
no
I'm almost dead
there we go
now
wait
we don't think I think we need I need
these things there we go
thank you enemy we're just coming here
and shooting me down like that
quite a rude if I would without my same
so I can't possibly get in there that
was it rude yeah I just love cup came in
like shocked me once and then went that
way
as if that thing owns the place
hopefully I can get past in things
without getting shown
don't mind me
I said don't mind me
point
point
yeah I don't think I will get my license
approved when I drive like this
[Music]
thank you
well
okay not
okay they have like two different mind
level and the uh
chessboard
oh I skipped that's fine to do what's
final additional one
revert back
now it is very bad
double burnt
well I guess it's going to be played
like 20 more times so I don't think
we'll miss it the new world hmm I think
I recognize this case
but that's not how to take a map what am
I doing
so if I go straight down and straight up
let's see
if the water is moving I don't think the
water is moving in the PC version so so
I said the PS1 version is the
like the definite the definitive version
or something
[Music]
yeah I better go back and repair the
[Music]
going back and repairing the helicopter
wait where is it always all the way up
here
okay
there you go
I did it
it's not the easiest to take care of it
okay I got it confused
oh that was because I was just trying to
shoot me
there it is whoa
I don't think I've run into this mine
but I don't like its face
but I'm going to destroy it anyway so
now I just need to
clear pause here I think
thank you
I'm shooting you to send me something
new and you see
think about that
no okay
oops
I don't like your face mine
do you like his face I should be able to
do this
let's give it one try
oh it's the Americans oh you saw it now
you guys have Hawaii
no you don't have Hawaii
I was looking too far south you actually
don't ever in this one I was going to
say you got the
what did I just call them and
Polynesia that was what I was going to
say
there you go now let's go
well that was a waste of a gene
around it
Run Deep Run
yes coming through don't mind me
and don't mind me aren't they
so much vegetation hey
so many tight corners
oh I got something it's ads
[Music]
wait which way I'm going
[Music]
I think I'm supposed to go down
here
and if I do lose this Jeep um
I go to destroy everything
around and pass on
yeah
so
when I got things to destroy
uh
no it's like
something something
yeah destroy your rugby face excuse me I
just left my base
you need to attack me already
yeah I'm not taking any chances now
I'm gonna destroy you one
go
then
I'll
I will trigger the mines
I'm not doing such a good job on
tricking the minds
what kind of explosion was that
now
I just need to be careful
and don't drown this Jeep
okay
should have a first person mode
I love everything is destroyed I wonder
why
and now let's bring the flag Hill
can I dropped it on the way first time
that happened
[Music]
I lost the mission once but that was
only by having three jeeps in Los
Angeles I have not lost one where I have
all 12 options all
vehicles
and this is the first time I drop the
flags
due to your mind there we go this video
[Music]
but it's just a random video
[Music]
how did you find the doors for every
meeting is
[Music]
finding him in high quality
p-o-n that's water pond
let's be safe
10 minutes 13 seconds
okay
so around about
maybe yeah I also I was surrounding in
every level in China
so we've got two places
so far it's all I've never been in the
first one I'm just trying to unless it's
cool
um someone has put mines in my base
okay good
one more
maybe that's my man by being surrounded
that they are mines
except the minds weren't surrounding
amazing
it was just in front of the scene
[Music]
empty oh no
can I get stuck there
in Polish
evil minds but there are no Minds
anymore
it could be mines elsewhere though
okay I will move up this time
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
like
[Music]
I'm out of munition
that was a kid
good thing I realized that too late
and then I destroyed this building and
there is no flag in this and I realize
but the flag is in a different
and the flag is in a different Castle
there are mines around this place
almost out of you yeah
don't worry it's the teeth crashed down
here so
sorry sorry Castle
[Music]
all right
now
how do I
which parts should I take to reach
it's generous
you will not
sure run something here
because out the film pretty quickly
they're about to see
there you go
I gotta say
the brown military I got cheerleaders
so
now I should be able to take this Jeep
and go straight up here
[Music]
I don't know
they control this
you're gonna make an opening like that
oh no I missed missed the tower
here we go
they left me
you'd have done mine
but I can see it is I don't have to get
through this is mine but it has an ugly
face
[Music]
there we go
I don't think I need to do something yet
I'm gonna destroying this because it's
fun
not because I have tea
oh that was the wrong way
blew up the flag when sadly I can't do
that I actually indestructible
which of course it's a good scene
breaking fun is breaking things is Fun
making funny scenes I understand
I understand
and Pom-Pom loves to Break Stuff
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
like one video per
you have to complete like
five words before you get the next video
oh my
King rocky road but it's Rocky Road
yeah do you think I was afraid about
this game is that it might be a little
bit same same over and over
Rocky Road
yeah as I said this game might feel a
bit samey
it is Rocky Road at the moment
and
you don't have to wait
no worries
move out
there we go I did it
okay
he left the helicopter
getting a replacement part
they just don't have like
a new engine or something so they can't
build any helicopter
Chopper Fly Away
let me go back
going out on the open ocean no way
oh yeah that was completely the wrong
way
that
yeah I don't want to go that way
I guess I don't need a helicopter now I
really should all right I'm bored I'm
bored
I was only using the helicopter to
figure out where I was supposed to be
going out with a tank instead
well there's a mine there but thanks
surprise mine is a jeep that doesn't
move out
you've been red building
that mind is not causing me any harm
it's like two days off to the side
so I'll take the Jeep this way
and up here
oh they're not putting anything
interesting
oh that was a sorry about that
the gates went open when you approached
them only see if it's your game
that'll be Jeep
well
that's not I could turn the
IPS I didn't really pay attention to
what I was doing
so mines do show up on the map
it's pink dots
but not Towers
so yeah I can see a pink duct tie
foreign
this is a very shitty Jeep
I feel like I'm going
the wrong way
oh here's the way
this looks yeah I see the building
just go around
the trees
what happened to you
foreign
there we go
to sing
oh no I'm out domination
that's no good
oops that wasn't my name
anyway
every song is in the race boy or this
side or what at home
every every song is in uh the one Saints
Row game
why are the classic songs in Saints Row
that doesn't
seems like the songs I would expect from
me
maybe maybe that's it
what
do you want tongue is
I forgot it's the name as always
what is in a serious
it's on the solar system this song in
particular is our
okay
stop getting stuck and this project I
want is
light up the Bumblebee
now it switch over to
that Adventure
tell
it's not see

[Music]
don't shoot the Jeep
[Music]
why don't you straighten up the carry
there you go was that so hard no it
wasn't
just going to be very oh
don't run straight into that mine
William Tell over Overture
I don't know I've seen anyway
there you go
I used to know how to play this on piano
okay it wasn't really a piano it was an
electric keyboard
same principle uh
[Music]
an electric key but my keyboard is also
Electric
the one I used to type
rock and roll is done
be right back now yes
unless something else crazy comes up
road to ruined wait that's a crush lemon
crash two level
but which came first this level or could
the crash level
that's an interesting signal
I'll take the top right one
I guess it now responds to the first one
I need to draw you something
how many games have level names that are
the same one came first wait one game
first what are we talking about now what
do you know
this weird plane next one
what
[Music]
do do do
you know how much you're confusing me at
the moment
so
it's almost like this this one today
right there
well try that first you're putting too
much attention
don't you know me I put a lot of
attention to everything
all right okay
I'm in high tech now
stop moving up
no more Minds please
do I have to take this one out probably
not
but thank you
and then there's one more here
the road is clingy they say it's in this
one
nope oh no
oh no
I'm being bamboo so
[Music]
I'll be going to but create pressure on
my
boy
is she
[Music]
pressure on the enemies armor also
remember to not shrimp and
stretch yeah I'm trying to sit up
straight multiple times then I shrimp up
but I am not stretch out here I could
ever leave that I feel like I'm trying
this it properly or often enough
bad I could probably add and uh sit up
straight to your name
people want three more redeems I know I
removed a bunch of readings my
frankincense
I do wonder if the if the location of
the
thing is predetermined and
and not random
I just need to
get out here
what oh did not say
so
I will use wait which
what is so many Minds so many Minds
now why do you see that one
there we go
oh no the bridge took damage
destroy destroy
absolutely amazing
do you annoy me
I've heard that you're not supposed to
like have your engine running or
something when you from your time
how much shooting with your Cannon what
do you think
what what's the
where am I supposed to go
passing it down here
that squishy nice when you squish
everyone at the same time
unlimited to play
all right
excuse me
again
Okay so
it's the wrong way around
come back here I am playing more Thunder
tank bottles more wow
why Sunday
I mean stop attacking me
open mines are gone now
why but you're going now
have a good
have a good time
don't worry don't worry I got I got
everything I needed destroyed so it's
fine
it is fine
no important losses but hello roxies
too much Forest
go
reversing out from here
[Music]
we can't proceed there's a bush in the
way throw hand grenades
in a PC version there's a roof on the
Jeep and that in that case it makes
sense that you're hungry but this this
is JP has a roof and like fully enclosed
to open a window and throw something you
need
[Music]
here send me it again oh it's the same
video
bro to real is completed a little slower
than the rotary ruining crashed so hey
foreign
levels next world
next we're next World gator bait
these levels looks to be more
complicated now
I might actually run as resources and
need to change my tactics
they already debated me once
okay so I will take the top left
bottom right I've I've moved to rent
first again
where's Decatur
well that's the bait there is no gator
don't mind me it's passing through I
might be colored brown but we don't need
to shoot everything that is brown
because then you're going to have a
problem at the toilet
or didn't destroy it no
no or when
I just
okay hello girl
now we're playing some military game you
know Kate though no gator
no no gator
thing asked it brown little chair
against the Green military because
that's the colors
that's the very creative fun colors
wait where am I going
I'm moving like
far north as possible
I think this is one here
stop
all right that's let me get out of it
oh then I know which one it is
it's always the last one except for that
chess board thingy that's that case it
was not the last one
wait where's my home
[Music]
I'm lost
oh there it is
I found home
I'm not lost anymore
fun having popcorn is very happy about
that
so
that means I just move up and I'll bring
my tank with me
okay
53
oops I shot my own building
yeah but you didn't make me do
where did you come from I mean my base
I just left my base here just destroying
some trees well well they dealt with one
of you
well almost
running after 11
oh I shot each other
whatever is campaign arms operation is
it some
thing edible
if you combine your arms in operation
that does not seem like
doesn't seem
in that case I I think you your doctor
is is a Frankenstein
I think the music goes crazy when you
with your second Bank
go
place up here and then
all these mines I
it's a mind game
please show it yeah there it is
there it is
oh it survived
sound
tea time
but look I've cleaned up these areas and
I can drive through it without easy
combined arm operation yeah Pawn point
is right it's when a doctor decides uh
to attach two arms
together enough ranking arm exactly yeah
I know myself
I know my stuff is about
drive right into water
[Music]
yeah I did it
foreign
[Music]
three ways
don't worry
we haven't been three ways a lot of
times I see like five places but like
five ways
one two
three
why is there a light maybe maybe there's
a link
that's
three ways why is that not perfect
it's a good that's a fine way I mean a
game called extremely
Corollary
don't even remember where it was
supposed to go
I'm not running something
um
well
no it didn't even destroy the thing
and then
and I lost a helicopter I mean
helicopter
remember that the the two words that
helicopter is combined of is helico and
Peter
and I hope you feel good about knowing
that
huh stop shooting me so rude
we're not destroyed already
the girl finally destroying it
a a lonely building an alignment
oh yeah in my base
so like this is I think this is first
time I have Gates
[Music]
one
or does it have to be so picky name
again
there we go
I'm almost certain that that is the
princess to the foolish word attack
meaning a bad
I thought it's possible
okay and down left
or Southwest if you want
assuming up is north
which is probably safe dancing
don't have any Compass showing
anything
but there it is there it is
so let us shoot in comments
including everything
depth building
next to the building
next to the Moon I also doing so good
with this shooting why shot building
okay and not in that building as
expected
I have to fly home again
there's only one thing left and I can't
take the tank there
um and then I will
use the gates
it's not going to be exciting
[Music]
I'm currently there you use the game
the excitement builds up
the worst place oh no
oh my you know what
you know what
I won't even use the games
okay I I will still use the gates to get
to do the water
you turn that way I guess it remembers
something
where which way it came from now I don't
need the assist but yeah let me ask
destroy this thing is in the way and
then I'll just go deep across here
look it's in here
Hallelujah
by being chased
of me
Hallelujah
yeah I'll use the gates I can get to the
water
and you will see the gate in action
it's going to be very exciting
look it opens
I think I killed one of my companions
oops
we will let's find that under accident
and hopefully
no one will know who it was
[Music]
across the water
you already drowned 45 seconds thank you
without trees it was with good reason it
was to get to use the jeep much quicker
thank you
how does this work here logically
speaking like I'm telling the crew to
like
I cannot I can only order one one set of
crew or something
unless they come out to back to the base
or die
or abandon the vehicle which I wish
there was an option for it which will
happen when you run out of fuel
[Music]
um well I just
I've installed them well they go into
water and drown and die so I can then
start ordering the next vehicle
so we can get this world it's much
quicker because the war is over as soon
as it's still a flag because that's how
Wars it works
[Music]
very exciting is if you're traveling
slowly across the water
and with that
well I guess I have to enter the other
gate just to do it
don't mind the squished tent
that was not me
don't mind me being very defensive about
that as well
open the gate thank you
well hello what happened I don't know
I mean
they they this uh this uh sheets on the
ground where someone have spilled up
paint bucket underneath
and but that has nothing that's that
must never attempt to begin with
I have no no
um
the okay Coral
but at least it's doing okay
good enough
or is it it's zero kills Coral I don't
know
you can't see mine CFT I don't realize
that I put mine's in my face
okay so I'll go down
because apparently every time every
single climax definition sport would
have like some buildings
like there'll be 15 buildings
wait those are the pink ones
where are they
missed my Towers
anyway then I will destroyed this to say
to the flag but then it's a Quantum flag
or something
as soon as I check these it will not be
in these buildings
no
[Music]
I wish I had a Quantum flag
it's probably one more shot or something
that they don't have anything okay
someone's building paint so they covered
it with a tarp exactly that was what
happened
that's not my fault
oh I'm shrimping again
but how would you know where to get it
then
it's it here's how it works the flag
must exist in one of these three
buildings which are marked on the map as
a Green Dot with
darker green spots around it
uh
but uh the game tries to not give it to
me as much as it can as in it will not
it will not exist in any of the
once I destroy it first
so when I destroy this one I don't know
yeah so it's not in this one
and when I go back here this one didn't
manage to what else is
yeah one more shot he's not in that one
that means it isn't the last one
and that's how the quantum flag works
that's why I go into these two that are
as far as way as possible first
that means that the flag will spawn in
the flag
building
ah nice
but if it was your ligament oh but what
my play is supposed to be
you're not supposed to get my flag
that's the thing
wait do I have
Towers in the middle of the map
okay
and now that's not a different thing
right
it's not
because because the flag is not in the
state of being existing there and not
existing there it's it's the if I'm not
if you're not incorrect yeah and when it
comes to Quantum stuff I could be
completely wrong here it is that you can
uh somehow measure and force something
to be something which affects the other
related Quantum things uh which result
in
what the but the results changing by
unrelated
meaning that if I check in one of the
buildings
that would make what how would you shoot
each other
and that will make
nobody destroying it the exploring the
buildings that will force the fly into
one of the buildings of my cheesy
thank you
no
replying it says inside every building
and listen to destroy all of them no I
have yeah I still don't think that falls
on the shredding
though I mean it was in the quantum
thing too maybe it's in it maybe it's
this thing actually maybe that's what's
the thing in a good size
maybe what's that thing
[Music]
maybe it was the exact thing he
criticized
I'm just going to clear out this area so
I can quickly move through this area
before I move the internet running
yo
that should be able to speed through
with the Jeep later on
okay
and there's the flag
there we go there's the music again
when let's do that for fun fantasy
they just have fast pass session sand
they eat
elsewhere when you approach
oh yeah
and then when when I destroyed
when
and when every option is destroyed they
used to have to leave it in the last one
amazing also sounds a bit Star Wars see
Maybe
I was gonna say in Star wars exist at
this point yeah it is that it did Star
Wars is quite knowledge
old franchise
too many trees
but I want to drop 22 frames in total
now much better than compared to when I
was playing Spider
what
they can't force you to destroy places
that I will be silly yeah that would be
silly
I mean that's that's that's going too
far
okay
that's why I draw the line
thank you
too many trees it's lacking
but Star Wars probably took inspiration
from that song since it was written with
four stars yeah yeah
I mean this is obviously I kind of
forgot that this isn't an original song
for this game
[Music]
that is true this game is just using the
the song's asses
okay same video again
same video again seven minutes and 50
seconds come on that's insane they admit
thank you
ping
the mission because everything else has
not been a mission so far a lot of
strange names of some of these levels
but if I was called chess one I think
it's still three-point places
they have not gone beyond me
oh I forgot I've watched which one
should I leave
okay and let's go down here then
I guess since pay
we should have like
the Remake this and have like
achievements and
different game mode yeah they could have
the game mode I suggested
you have like
not here
the quantum mechanics are still working
Oh no I got it my dad
what was the next one I don't remember
[Music]
yeah here it was
[Music]
well that avoidance no no no no no no
it wasn't that one idea
this game definitely didn't have a big
budget since I've been using victory
it screams are more public domain maybe
that was kind of also the intention I
can't do some island hopping but
I have time for that
and so
but but it was so below budget that even
though they use free music
although it doesn't it doesn't mean yeah
this oh
well the composition is public domain
hips and drills straight into that
that doesn't mean that yeah
she's not even here
you couldn't even hear the laughter yet
today sound
yeah it doesn't mean that the
performance is public domain is what I'm
trying to say
anyway and uh
well that was a waste of a tank
but I like this kind of music sounds
complaining and I was going to say that
so even though they're using free music
uh they were still so little budget that
they they didn't even bother having a
bit of a different tracks
okay that's
because I didn't play the
wait why is it playing this song
it shouldn't play playing playing the
other song
or does it switch to other song when
they you lost a certain amount of
vehicles in total or something
but anyway which I never came the point
that never came to
get two part two
what's the idea of
um
yeah playing this multiplayer
which is split screen
but you you make make it so that you can
only see your screen and not the
opponent screen
he's gonna
fill up the tank image
so all new moves are in secret
that oh I destroyed both at the same
time because that could be kind of
interesting
kind of driving around trees I'm trying
through them
[Music]
tank is not holding Watcher just like a
tank shoot
where am I supposed to go Oh in here of
course
thank you for watching
no no no
it doesn't snow hanging inside me
stop shooting at me
name a peaceful things
oh my so hard to get around here
watch out people you're walking over
mine
oh no they were carrying pink buckets
watch out you're working on mine
foreign
they must work as painters or something
lag has been found
anyway
who gives a spit about trees anyway they
block the view of the sky
and my peaceful thing
yes yes
I am the most peaceful tank that is
oh let's see that drowning people oh
with the tank is a white frame
well
and where's the
should that also be a
we are seeing you seeing when you um
when you come when you complete the map
it's it states everything you did like
you should completely learn without
doing a war crime you should completely
live without losing a vehicle
[Music]
[Music]
and then you
check everything off
yeah let's make like a let's make a
modern remake with high quality Graphics
of this game
p o m Pawn I've done it in seven minutes
and three seconds can I say please thank
you
I don't really get those things
Rosie ring
oh yeah intentionally drowning a tank
crew in order to get back to base fast
there's also more crime because has has
that been like
my oh my suddenly suddenly now
wait how many buildings on it's seven
wait why is this seven of them do I need
to destroy it one seven I don't have
enough the helicopters for that
if someone wants to commit War crime
commit terrorism intense
yeah oh no they're mine's everywhere
what is this
your this is my Island okay get out of
here
you weren't invited
okay I'm going to change tactic now
I'm going to destroy everything
oh that's
I guess you're not going to see me
destroy everything
wrong button
oh oh
okay
I'm sitting the wrong way
when I was stuck
oh
okay that's not how I should do it
okay let's let's bring in something
heavier
whoa whoa whoa I only lost half hands
when so much for being a heavy vehicle
heavy Jeep
definitely lost off of the hand
foreign
yeah yeah
reason
okay it's not in that one
well there was a mind there
okay I'm not doing that great at the
moment
yeah that place is completely destroyed
well I guess I'll go down
yeah what is a helicopter oh my mine are
you winning fun well not getting so
great at the moment
could it could have gone by
also when I lost half pounds they
actually just went back to the base and
he left
oh
I didn't even destroy the building
didn't even destroyed the building
my next appointment well this is one of
them
well I will try again
destroying up I've always wanted to use
that joke but he never had the
opportunity before Oh you could like
I've used it many times
like I just randomly shows up the stream
and then
you say are you winning insert name of
streamer
preferably if you can do anything
[Music]
you used to drink crash your spider and
you're too good that's for sure I mean
I'm still winning so
[Music]
I mean you're watching Oh you mean you
wanted me to jump on I'm streaming
that
I'm winning just in my way
okay I've destroying the toes so let's
go talk wait yeah yeah
I'm probably not destroying them in the
order I want to destroy them in
I'm going to destroy these mines because
I they have a Jew in my life
here we go
that's not my tank so I don't care
I should have landed
restocked but whatever
it's not like I'm going to survive long
enough
for the ammo to run out
oh that's back
blank has been found and it was not in
the last building destroyed
interesting so it's Frank is there okay
let's move in with the Titan
the joke is you're supposed to ask if
you are ironically I.E
by the
uh
where the person isn't winning
okay Uninvited Tower get rid of you it's
an underwater Tower up here yes of
course the ease
read a few tears be here
my dreams are shattered yep mine too
have a beer
well these minds are sharing
are you losing porn no I'm not
I'm winning
press the wrong button
no I'm almost almost dropping off the
b-roll
foreign
's doing so good
no the time to start the beach
don't do that destroy the bridge
I got stuck
so
whoa whoa whoa
no
I got thanks
hopefully I can destroy the
well I got three more attacking vehicles
yeah I didn't do that great
at least I didn't just thinking about it
this time
end of the head bush because I don't
like its face
no it didn't it was destroyed
going to hide in here I can't reach me
I'm safely
okay okay
I'm not doing so good at this uh another
G I want the armored vehicle support
vehicles
I don't like that cheese face destroyed
yeah it was a bush I think but yes
am I wrong
wasn't any icon for the player is better
red in this game I think in peace
versions how do you like the cuphead
games
destroyed
okay
miss everything
it missed everything
foreign
why not
now I'm getting stuck
I'm stuck again at least at least I got
rid of that one uh more
yeah anyway
oh no
but there's a mine there
I don't like that
I'm getting destroyed
no
no Murph
no amount of ammo
this isn't good
yeah now
I'm just gonna stay there
I know
oh wait I will survived
because the building exploded not me
fun fun is a hyper overly
hyperactive mode nobody likes the sugar
and becomes very high little bunny
yeah
when the phone is super hype hype
okay that
at least I got through the most of the
stuff so
but I think it should be safe enough for
the Jeep to like enter at the moment but
just want to make sure that everything
is clear
and I do know it's been singing and
whips
but don't run away just did
it looks to be like clear let me just
clear out the area a bit more
foreign
don't like you though
all of the people are screaming out in
the ocean
destroy the stupid tree
there we go finally
there we go destroyed that one too
near the vehicle
there it is
finally now with everything destroyed
back to the base
even though it's really slow
so you just grab a lift
stupid hurry
I mean comes to steal some ammo from the
enemy for entering the base I mean they
kind of gave me that hammer
nothing came from doing that just it's
spending time
okay now it should be clear for the Jeep
there's still one black building I'm not
destroyed
flying off the Bumblebee time
and here we go
how much yeah we go around then
come on
why is it so easy to get stuck
[Music]
oh no oh no I know
being chased
I know
I'm bringing it into place
you're not going to get me it's actually
slower than a Jeep
[Music]
they should always send those out when
you pick up the flag that would make it
interesting
what it means 40 seconds that's the
slowest thing so far I think all right
let me see
I will also make uh no point
because I do not know
Oh north
well thank you for the instruction
that's the last for this world but
that's for next
I mean ah
it's an interesting instruction that
would be for next time
should that will be for next time
[Music]
so
who to we go and visit this Friday
who
that was fun surprisingly yeah I thought
that was boring
it wasn't the most exciting game I've
played to be honest
but actually now actually last name was
kind of kind of scary
well no
not only do you looks to be closing down
so
that does not lift him
be uh
valid
Target but we could visit
yep I have an idea it's one of the other
I just want to see who I really last
time
latest
yes so have I not visit era playing
she's so nice she's nice she's so kind
so happy
she's being bullied by her
chat
foreign
actually because there's so much you can
do this this like
farming I don't know if there's farming
but it's Gathering of resources
at least this fine thing I think
there is
constructing your home building
there
this is like that I enjoy Stacy I'm
happy
I'm happy you did so
foreign
I'll save it on the list of people
so let's
I don't know I'll use the feral button
this time I'm just switching around
you can use whichever remote you want I
feel like switching around I would use
different email double stream
[Music]
