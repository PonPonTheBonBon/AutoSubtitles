go suggested what I don't know maybe it
wasn't you suggesting it I'm terrible
remembering who said
what I'm
sorry
Sonic a Sonic inter to production
devel
by single
track I mean technically there is one
single track going around the whole
this do I control this like cannot
control
[Music]
this how do I
doesn't the controller work oh the
controller sto
working I reconnect controller oh look
this works okay
options boom that's okay
I
okay trophy presented rightest Choice
nice now I take controls this is quite
music
anog dig song okay let's
um is this this game old game there is
no analog can I change this
[Music]
somehow yes so now it's digital so it's
a digital no analog sticks this is going
to
be this is going to be
interesting grapp on okay this is going
to interesting inste
[Music]
[Music]
like again it's going
standard Al I hope this I didn't have
check or music
game let's start
select
[Music]
right handling at Max acceleration now
Mass Le where's the like maybe everyone
[Music]
has Max H same top
[Music]
speed
okay
I don't even know what
[Music]
the I'm going
going see what all the options
are a lot of backstory to every
character
but does a lot of
T these are
very
no
acceleration
like okay massive
lift no
Mass High acceleration High
handling it Le like a begin option let's
go let's just let's start off easy
okay I guess this is the go unlock
[Music]
everything a wide open run if you get
turned around keep the red boys to your
right the which is opposite of
uh of
um the opposite to crash B the secet
winning is not necessar the shortest
pass but it's the written of the
wave oh yeah and then you have the
grapple things okay I
see no
nestly oh
wait wasn't
prepared
G
wa this is some
gra
from oh I see
[Music]
see
it'ss keep falling
out
when cing
yeah this is
okay
oh do he even run
now all
right okay
I'm going to make
a are these floating over the
[Music]
ground
[Music]
so uh hello P thank you for
lucking don't know what the game what
kind of game this
is
I'm a position marker
like I which position you
in yeah I have
no said that I was going to use use like
wave I don't know how I'm just
King
go go
go oh I didn't need to tackle you I
guess we were on the same
team so there like a turbo but the then
but how am I supposed to how am I
supposed to press unless I sure I can
press I change the
no crash don't leaves Jet
Moto
welcome track
I think I need some what what do you
need like acceleration
[Music]
grapple
uh
tilting I am
lost
there a lot of racers in this game Point
Place nice
work race
results oh that was
[Music]
terrible that's
great
so I definitely need
the
oh yeah there's leaning I kind of forgot
about
[Music]
leaning how about I change the controls
to something more convenient because I
do not feel like these controls are
convenient at
all so we create a new th
F I mean I can do
that and then then I would can
[Music]
I
[Music]
so that's going to be very
great I keep the
dad I really like doing acceleration
grapple turb when breaking like that
seems very inconvenient how are you
supposed to press acceleration and turbo
at the same time I mean sure as I tested
you don't need to press Accel and turbo
at the same time but having to shift
between accelerator and turbo H which is
probably why I lost because I didn't
never use turbo but but but still
shifting between those two seems to be
very
inconvenient I what are the a controls
like cuz there's no
no there's no good controls I believe in
you okay you know what let's
do
accelerator I'm going to controls now
terrib
like
[Music]
that and then I'm going to do rolling
like that then
This
Ti turn let's put that there
then there we go and then need start
S this one go and I think that's
everything
yes
perfect and then I set it to use this
controls does it update automat
automatically yes it does for some
reason didn't do that for when I
what which was
[Music]
weird not that you see the character
anyway they have very
different custom circuit okay let's see
let's try again that's the same track
but with the controls that I think would
be
better
that's press xate
accelerate so go go go
oh oh right is that a digital game I
don't have anal
controls where's
the we going about grab
him how do I see how much turbo I have
left definitely run out of
Turbo that's
sorry why do you why do you step some
for
checkpoints
okay let's
see not like that the
key you only have a certain amount of
tur I'm still being Stu they said I was
like going over water is not effective
let's oh there's no restart option even
though this is just a a casual run there
is no
restart yes how many times I have to say
[Music]
yes maybe I should have read the
instruction book
it yeah it seems to be a plenty of
techniques in this game that I don't
really get did you say
no did I say no I don't know if I say
now okay yes I see I see so the turbo is
the green dots okay so I want to have a
certain up the
turbo that was one of the
teammates no come on
I there we
go so if I avoid the water I don't have
to deal deal with oh whoops murdering
everyone I don't have to deal with the
UN even what
thing boosted off it nicely then
f oh
oh oh
my do you get boost back or
like across the Finish Line oh it's full
up okay so I get four four boost per
left
okay let
see
yeah that was the
grapple okay if I just press the
grapple it does not rotate here
okay so we still going to have to rotate
one
gra okay that grapple thing is
a
what's supp land cuz you can tilt
it oh I won don't turn into that
well Prett much still
thing okay so I'm getting better hang of
the
game it has a lot of elements can with
it I love those lot of
elements
just murdering everyone
okay
not
ohou not
exact oh touch the
tree not exactly sure how I'm supposed
to
like ride the waves properly
but that part I'm confused
about
no I did that
[Music]
[Music]
again hope you have a good time while
racing oh look I'm not last this time oh
W fif
place crashing everywhere that's a
that's an
[Music]
improvement and the computer does not
seem to be affected
by how quickly you finish the
[Music]
race
[Music]
okay I'm going to new what happens if I
do
[Music]
bues let's do it for this
uh loading picture is quite low low
quality
oh yeah I'm grapping for too long
that's just grapple a very short
moment that was maybe too
[Music]
short
okay
I have to way
moved just switch position
again everyone's going FAS than me
there's some technique I need to do with
the waves I'm not doing anything with
the waves so there's some oh technique I
can do with the waves that I don't know
oh nice I got pushed
off that I don't know which just makes
everyone else go quicking in me if I
don't
yeah come
on
St
[Music]
okay I'm getting better at
draing still no idea how am I supposed
to deal with the um waves but one thing
at a time I
guess
oh y turn off I
again
then do you race as a team or is
it everyone against
everyone
fre
yeah
okay nice yeah that nice
okay it's not the first place but it's
certainly much better than
[Music]
before four Place definitely much
[Music]
better standings after one of three
races second points
[Music]
does that mean I get
to
start does it mean I start at the end of
back of every race or do I start at
middle I like furthere but no I I mean
it's
not oh they're like OT roads but I'm
still at
the this
is
crazy oh this tight
turns oops R straight into that
one it's quite the track for being the
second of all tracks in
[Music]
here
oops SM one yeah be of CRA
TR second
[Music]
TR dra into
[Music]
that
[Music]
when they had the here they don't have
the track boundaries I me
[Music]
no oh come
[Music]
on
[Music]
again I feel like this game he's a bit
here they have the track boundaries not
exactly sure
why
[Music]
mot crashing falling up every time wait
how do you where the start
[Music]
is oh the start is not SM yeah the start
is not
Mark any different from every
other
man
there are you
know flying so
high there's so many controls of the
[Music]
character and yeah and instead of just
having analog controls like yeah how
about you press a button to take tight
turn use using the button stick to
determine how tight you want to
turn was this game developed
before analog controllers for
PlayStation oh this map is
getting not bumping into everything
going left of
this
terrible
[Music]
race against and
continue yeah to driver suicide course
oh oh okay so this should so this should
be the third track then suicide course
this TR seems fair easy then you'll
reach the end of the course when the EU
turn S racing
head okay that's what you meant by
Sude thir wa same
SC
[Music]
how I where where am I supposed to
go I'm
quick everyone went do
me this game requires way too much for
[Music]
me I am not good at this
game
oh
yeah was hope
Cas this is way too technical it's way
too much going
on way way too much
on wrong
waying at least do get being
cute yeah at least I hope I'm trying to
be good I'm not trying to be
like yeah I'm to
totally failing at this
game keep doing that
wrong I'm crashing into every
single at this this game that's that
when you crash into an opponent only an
opponent crashing I've never crashed for
running into someone
I guess I'll continue being cute it's
not going to win me a race
but okay actually crashed by R me into
that driver but at least was
like head don't
condition maybe that's an
exception this touch touch this BL
anyway okay I should go this
way I turning one they want me to
do well that bumped
me get it bumped
everywhere
at least CS
cing I need to touch this
checkpoint 17 place that's OD I was
going to be
last
well the toal score oh
look is
not
I said that was going to be even
[Music]
worse okay I
[Music]
lost all
right
like
High acceleration
high
and let's try
[Music]
it do you not have to win or something
come first place to continue I assume
there's more than three tracks in the
whole
game I
see
get
[Music]
away
oops wasn't my
fault
it just
happened okay it's
now climing positions
now probably because I'm getting better
at the
game but like
for like as an introduction to the game
it's quite
the why
difficult
hey where are you people coming
from he invited
you okay so I'm keeping first place now
for a while
but I'm completely
going but I'll be
trying there
go I'm playing the
tree oh that was
close no
what touch the edge there it's
great oh no go go go go go we don't have
the time to
lose in both
[Music]
senses first place I didn't it
[Music]
celebration 25 points
W let's go
got the most of this winding track is
inside a quick moving River don't get
too comfortable though it's not cold
Black Waterfalls for
nothing now it's is probably called
black for the walls because there's
a fall close by I know
as and the track was named after
it hey why are my team so far behind
everyone
else not that there's any teams what's
point with teams is every everyone
against everyone not doing
terrible just Corners are so
tight
[Music]
oh
[Music]
[Music]
well sorry about
that W oh why rotating so much all a
sudden
[Music]
oh there
[Music]
let's not too
much left
[Music]
[Music]
that
[Music]
much went so when then
mying they going speed through these
parts
[Music]
get lift off then that means
rotation I get St to get get more
more
right last place
you
SL some
position well camera's going
crazy
okay 16th Place
what
oh wa
doing F place means zero
points how position do you get points
with
him maybe I should Che
that
[Music]
backing
everyone okay so they us seeing their
boost here come on I bar started going
and already
[Music]
crashed okay wait how where oh I see I
see the game of chist way too much for
me I can't do
this if I'm going to grapple I me I must
counter turn at the same
time so I don't turn to this
side oh my un need
to yeah and I to
correct why this
you too it's too much for my brain to
handle
[Music]
okay yeah
that's I'm trying but
[Music]
um I play Spy
instead
oh I saw the cor
die anything
dream
oh yeah that colled
me
there we
ow too much stuff in the road this is
the road
now
we
go
no crashing with
FR he have so little control
[Music]
over well seventh place I guess that's
an
improvement
[Music]
but
yeah this is going to be the full game I
I I cannot I cannot complete the person
I can I cannot win this I'm
sorry I gave it a try but this game
requires way too much for
me
why was that the
crash
I'm I'm TR to the positive
it oh
but I it's just
like the game gets gets too difficult
way to F the difficulty
C is
it's not a care it's just this
W go go from this open
track to that en Clos track that I
constant for
now I could
[Music]
say
okay
okay
goodbye
oh oh come on
can I win
this s the
same
I'm losing
places my my go
of beting Amber PS1 game has been
broken
I I'm just not this that you such
a thir oh there to personing the Finish
Line without
[Music]
me
okay I can of see how many positions
actually gets points out the 14 get
points I got 16 if I got zero
points the previous
[Music]
time
one
[Music]
[Music]
but I guess it's the same in like
Formula One even though you have a theme
you kind of of your own points or
regard
tght I can't bar see
the grapple Tower
[Music]
see that one this one too
[Music]
sharp there's like I mean the m that
like a secret he one there I can't
[Music]
see oh my oh
my this game does not like
me I didn't like it first
so it didn't give me good good first
impression has coed me ever
[Music]
since yeah I'm crashing into everything
I have no control of
[Music]
this this is probably
moment yep I pressed the wrong
button have a bit of lack of control in
G that's how we
[Music]
so killing of the competition oh and
yeah please some head don't show show
this game
[Music]
play
P look at this camera change
don't even see anymore
anyway you don't

them I don't know if that's a great say
way to say it
[Music]
goodbye grapple you had the
grapple oh no too
