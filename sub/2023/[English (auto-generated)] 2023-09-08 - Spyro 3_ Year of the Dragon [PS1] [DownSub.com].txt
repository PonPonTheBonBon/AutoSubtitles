help you stop the Sorceress there's a
way to open a hidden portal but it'll
take some very strong Magic

flipping your hair

helping silly little creatures haven't
used spirals I suppose there couldn't be
any harm in letting him out could there
yeah he said I already got his weapon
machine

that's why it doesn't hurt
the dancing bear
dance
[Music]

hell it's your lucky day check this out
not much stamina though too bad I had a
lot more ammo left
anyway I heard all about how you've been
finding the Sorceress and her armies and
kicking all that butt and I just wanted
to say yeah
wish I could stay but my Homeworld been
overrun by Ryan Ox since I've been
captured if you happen to see the
sorcers tell her I'll be giving her
dance and lessons real soon you

the day it was a toy that cow but by
fast food restaurant keeps me
okay
perfect
wait you can cheat above then
because the aiming is terrible
[Music]
they didn't they hadn't figured that
thing yet I feel like they mean it's
terrible too
foreign
feel like he speaks even quickly and
reignite it
yeah he has a spirit in this game hey
like how how do you miss
this game is has so many he's
a vast number of rhinos
yeah they gotta make money by his
feelings
don't shoot me just shocked me
take care everyone work to escape
it's professors Becky

I think I need to have
yeah
this is funny I mean yeah I guess
I guess I'm also terrible gaming
there again there's one
[Music]
missed
so I'm not missing anything in here
doesn't look like it
anyway to pierce my controller fish with
your heart
yeah
especially when it's like
do inverted control screaming
yeah don't really get why
I mean I guess it was before aiming
controls for a scene I don't know didn't
aim income
I mean I do Mystery
okay this is so
foreign
up and down
now I missed
it's direct one is the target dummy
yeah
all right you cleared them out yeah
no Rewards
I guess the laser is strong enough to
destroy the whole body but now I'm
uh
probably going to die now
most of the characters sounds like
SpongeBob almost as if they were the
most interesting Journey it's strange
right just as I thought the machine room
is overrun with birds to Target the
birds in their nest
now who needs to actually why I'm doing
this to me
and naked Birds
yes there you go I have been nice
thank you let's move on
oh look it's a it's a girl Dragon
because it is now I can switch the
gravitonometric generator back on I hope
no Birds got in there
tonometric
generating
inspiring SpongeBob yeah
Professor SpongeBob everyone is
SpongeBob
I'm SpongeBob I'm being voiced by
Spongebob too
voicing multiple characters not only
ever happened
[Music]
I mean they're allowing me to do it so
much
[Music]
[Music]
there we go done the lab's clear and it
smells better in here already yeah it
smells burnt it's burned why no reward
um
[Music]
now I have to pick up all these damn
Manion
[Music]
okay
that's better than Nike
graze from Legends of Zelda
and I can't play some of the Amazon
games that I don't know
maybe I should say
I don't think any
Nintendo game I've played games on
Nintendo and I played on Game Boy but by
my calculations the bombs in this handy
vending machine should be highly
effective against armor give it okay
booms are highly effective what a crazy
idea
problems with an exclamation mark
[Music]
I guess we'll
right thousand
one
[Music]
I don't want to get two now oh there we
go
and that worked
maybe a aiming this is so slow
there we go
oh wait there's something here
now I can have spots pick happy gems for
me
so I don't have to delete myself
dang game theory is one point inspiring
to the same person
yes of course
I am I mean
[Music]
watch out
all right
I guess if you're playing with the
proton mod
see if I can take this out
and see what I can no
he's going to shoot me
okay this is going to be tricky I need
more hands but
they are now leaving
no more living creatures of
what the heard I'm sorry
okay let's see if we can get through
here
Olivia
perfect
[Music]
and now I destroyed the pineapple
or that
anonymous
[Music]
engine nine or Tom Brady can't be Tom
Brady those bomb stopped the coffee
let's say foreign
professors
foreign
[Music]
thank you English is definitely is
faster than anything related
what
I didn't think for that one but
yeah you can definitely nothing this did
they need to speed up the places wait
what's running what oh it's over there
I don't have this ink I just got to say
what
that was weird and now it counts up but
you said it I already have the sink
the game is a bit buggy
ah has
just slightly buggy
he destroys SpongeBob's house
it was on land I mean it wasn't using it
[Music]
you cook
him apparently there have been a few
broken stuff in this game already and
the previous game as well
they
still counted for some reason
let's get it up to you
jump over the Lacey
because I'm that cool
no I wasn't able to jump over it but it
was last enemies it's fine
he's never had to pick up the gems by
myself again thank you very much for
saving my laboratory well you're welcome
wait this was agent ninth lab not
Professor slam
Rowan okay secure dragon is Rowan there
I guess
aha
[Music]
I mean
I need to manually picking up only gems
again
[Music]
there's a short note it's just a
tutorial level anyway
there we go
and then I have to play that
agent nine level in previous world
that's going to be fun
[Music]
so I need to take this bomb back to the
start
yeah I did that you've been playing off
camera hmm
I haven't
I mean it's
it's no I haven't
my continent won't do gems I picked up
at the start of the homework that would
be really good and not also all the
games I picked up here it must be really
skillful to pick up that GM specifically
for no other channel 11.
[Music]
who like cucumber
yeah
what's up
am I cool like a cucumber
cucumber you're stored in your fridge
[Music]
there you go with the other one nope
so how much let me see
she must be a witch
and then at Depot
edible
missing 15 gems
yeah they're not behind it I have to
check
where huge 15 gems behind me
I mean I have the
[Music]
gem finder of course
let's destroy some more pineapples
because they are ugly
she must be a witch she turned into neat
what
the circulations
[Music]
foreign
yeah no secret balls
they add this in this version is so much
better than the reignited Cat book
easy though
I mean I'd say the United one is quick
and easy to navigate
on the two repair it does show you the
gem count in the list like this and I
count
I do wish every United did that instead
of showing a percentage
[Music]
um but I still seem to ignited China
just quick and easy to do
use did I miss someone out here
this is my opinion see
yours is wrong
[Music]
I'm the Bunny witch I guess that's all
right this is it jumps behind here
No it should put some gems piano
like that could be one of the options
then the bunny which we chat
no which dress
I think there is something in here
or maybe I just missed it at the start
after I get to start I guess I'll use
them or at the end I meant
in this area
there must be they might be an almost
yes
one fine
yes and nothing
oh
there you go
[Music]
yes
a ten and a five
that is the only chance
four gems level complete
I got to pay
classic
it's got the erotical character icons of
a photo oh yeah you got you you write
about that it does get up it does have a
picture of the level
and yeah it does have the picture of the
character so yeah I saw I saw someone
kind of make a resign but I so and it
did give me the idea that but they
really should have done is have three
columns
and back here
three columns gems
and then the other two Collectibles of
that game so
spider one is James
dragons and eggs
second spiral is gems warps and
talismans and this game would be gems
eggs and uh and character portraits
after you reach them at the end of the
limit
people
the easier it is awesome like the glance
to make rocket man happy
when you hover over a level and it shows
you the list of because it shows you the
names of the dragons in the first game
and then it shows the a hint of the or
the orbs and eggs in the second and
third game it could have a picture of
the level as well
there you go hopefully the last gems in
the lemon
what is the flight speed velocity of um
swallow
would even be very fitting for Halloween
oh yeah
you speak like you don't have a nose I
mean you don't have a nose
so I guess it's fitting
[Music]
all right yes this is going to be
terrible but let's go
[Music]
yeah I really don't get what I have 16
percentage
[Music]
I'm making progress
this is
I have to aim and work with the same
sticky
I miss this squeaky Brandy geek
whatever's annoying your rocket is bad
what do you mean a horse happy except
for 100 it doesn't drop dwarves
your face he got the eyes he got the
mouse what more do you need
yeah because
and this girl and I had the option to
change the controls
here you have to deal with
I mean sure examinated I could go
through when things
and change the controls but
it's not going to be good controls
anyway because the
I need to take out that box I think
there we go
I don't even aim up
I can sidestep whoa
which
yeah I could
trying to make it
not cash worth it
I'm going the right way
yeah why are you running away come here
although I must say that down to
giving me much of a challenge still
[Music]
oh someone attacked me
it's supposed to attack this scene
there we go
[Music]
there must be a waiting up and down but
who knows earthquakes forward
I hope so
it works so slow
and hopefully there's nothing because
it's draping strapping
if I had someone
come down
jump down
[Music]
ah 100 sure
great
[Music]

someone to be hot in a scene I mean
that's that's explosion sounds of
starfishes
you can see stars

say
so
[Music]
basic critics
this
foreign
[Music]
it's collecting these gems
it means you face up because music
apparently doesn't Loop
oh

you can really use the other one
properly
this guy's gonna do

hopefully these are the last gems yay
all gents and only
never complete
sandovation

saw that with him now the magic from the
egg has made you even stronger so you
can take one more hit for Spyro
okay all right yes Jamie's acting weird
I said you were a garnish voice thank
you for believing Sparks
but um
that means that
Parts canoe now hold another point
well
how much did I collect in the Homeworld
again
three four two
ain't going to exactly five stars in
gems
they want the amount I'm missing
currently in this whole world all right

can't change your predictions
yeah any outfit that she's wearing but
for this pal
another paragraph is the popping sound
no it isn't
NPC moving here
bank is moving a lot
[Music]
yeah okay I guess
that's an artery that can wear for the
boss battle
it's not very boss spelling outfit but
it's ugly
trouble of differentiating
different
pronunciation
hey that's your name everything yes but
today wasn't called that one sadly
good luck thank you
time to kick some
sorceress but
I'll do that
that's all he says

refunded there you go are you happy now

Avalon's portals to take me to the
dragon worlds but somehow I ended up

you'll come to Avalar soon okay so when
is they are they are definitely spiral
two models no details to them they just
single called polygons then it compared
to like
Bianca by similar with now how many
times have I told you not to take
pictures
or whatever
[Music]
see ya hi Sheila I've been looking for
Hunter all day
Spyro Hunter made me promise not to tell
you where they went
[Music]
not sure why it looks like that
one less noble one here since there was
100 Noble Warrior was this Moon so
squished
it's round
[Music]
it's a sad side Sparks another Noble
Warrior Falls victim to the plague of
love
look away
well I guess we'll have to find the rest
of the eggs by ourselves oh yeah I'm
like this away
come on Spyro oh break
and let's watch the show and let's watch
Hunter and Bianca I'm making out on top
of the roof
hello Sparks
here cuties
Creighton developed by insomnia games
but that's for now
look at real Chad
foreign
are you happy with the um
point
yes make enough yes yes
he stole my waifu
I'm coming on making
and
for because I would make
Cameron just clipped through the
geometry nice work day
and I think I wanted it to make more up
I want to make more of this for Pom-Pom
tomorrow which I usually do on the
weekends and one of the outfits I was
thinking to do was Bianca from Spyro
that's the
yes that would be a
that would be a rabbit
in a
change sent franchise if that makes
sense
and also cocoa because Anton is
replacing Coco so it's fun to have
Coco's outfit as an option
hasn't been helping findings anyway
exactly he's kind of the opposite he's
keeping their way takes away from me
unless I'm doing his stupid challenges
but honestly how many challenges has he
had for me to do in this game
um so far I know the tutorial started
flying from Kenya spiral Andre is
something else price Greg Burger
I don't think he's pronounced like that
still too quickly for me to read
at least Sergeant by it by Tom Kenny how
many times can show up at least they
actually give the uh
and names
but this is a character voices but cut
the elected list whoever they are doing
no would be nice
oh Tom Kenny
[Music]
tomcan is doing so many voices and
issues are shot twice on additional
character voices
especially the same people who did the
character voices
it is the additional character voices
and a few others
localization STL International
standard biased on a computer name here
and now we're going to consequences to
Sonic people
anyway
[Music]
he's behind them from you actually now
it'll be easier to finance these houses
it's sorry it's still going to be around
Johnson
which uh what what did he do in
president
don't remember everyone's roles in this
game
[Music]
but it is I hope
that wasn't I'm bad at this stuff should
just be quiet
like this
didn't explain localization the other
way before
and then they change the spelling of
localization when it came to localizing
European version
not necessary to do but
which rabbit basically a witch rabbit
um
Associates
gate board
there's
snowboard left
David Lord who team boys if it was under
additional voices anyone any of the NPCs
he was just created under additional
voices nothing yeah probably multiple
voices
one of the main characters well now now
we're speeding through the credits
rabbit who oh yeah you wonder which
rabbit as Bianca the rabbit of pyro Year
of the Dragon this game the the end of
dragon that's Hunter Stone
the hunter brainwashed
Bianca would never fall for hunting
I will take the dress that she has in
there
the reignited trilogy and put it on my
phone model for crash four mod no now
time to do the spark level
[Music]
thank you
wait I should have pick up some house do
you want to do
if you really want because the previous
and
I should have done that started this
before but basically because the
previous prediction was kind of a
failure how about we got a new one for
Sparks boss
says big fat ugly butt
she's sure
they did not do that anyway guys that
they should redo that that line she
really should say it like that
but anyway from another game Dragon's
Dogma he voices the dragon himself
hey I was gonna say maybe third voices
some dragons but
you baby dragons in that case there
aren't really any dragons to be voiced
in this game
[Music]
that was a stupid doctor who shot I
don't think
I don't think don't work in this context
he's the sheriff in Dynamo oh I'll get
there soon
I can I can do it after these things
when you steal the good it just dies but
it wasn't unfortunate life
it's fine
come here come here
[Music]
there we go
today
that's fine
[Music]
but sneaky one
okay now I can go
another one is time producing for me
stealing the key
too much shooting
I'm not responding I can hear it
yeah the boss is this
yeah that must be
[Music]
um
I'll see what I can do
it
not to run
count whoa wait foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I know they're coming at me
no another key
and then it starts from being no looping
prep around
[Music]
oh no one left
come on come on where are you
[Music]
there we go
[Music]
one of them
so now they're coming
no
there we go back
we'll have back
good good kids
my red leg is fast oh
that's on the sun okay
[Music]
is this the yes this is
okay let me just prepare for the boss
battle
[Music]
come on everyone done their predictions
yet
we got one two people
almost ten thousand who is this crazy
you just I know
it's just a quick it's a it's a click
anyone puts 80 now if you want to and I
will stop me stop it so we can continue
with the action
okay I will
[Music]
so many messages from people while I'm
streaming
now let's stop it now um we'll see see
how it goes I'm ready
hydrate yes from Sports part time is
definitely over but I am
can I drink
the preparation of the boss
[Music]
let's go wait am I going the right way
I'm not
I'm already feed
I already faint
and that was a waste of time
the timer is definitely longer in reign
United
[Music]
that was working remix
well well how did that hit me
so it's a longer timer
and that you can rent anything of course
that doesn't make its head easily
because
that's the recipe
anyway no winners again another day and
I guess that's another female dragon
without a bow they're starting to put
some boneless female dragons at the end
of the game
you're not stupid I'm stupid
we actually got one only
just quickly streaming the extremes well
I guess
I guess that's that that last egg must
have had some extra magic because it
gave Sparks two new abilities now he can
break open treasure chests and using the
atlas he can warp you to any level
you want and press the square button
this is this is I mean why not this x
button this game is stupid
no you're stupid and congratulations
you you won 11
000 chart coins
[Music]
spend them wisely
now and when I play this game
I can't do this
the problem is that he must break them
and then send you anything here
this is swimsuit
[Music]
because you have our gems
yeah that's why I did that bonus first
before I even do these levels
because now
I got plenty of trashy shirts I haven't
opened yet
you see
[ __ ] well Rocky man maybe you shouldn't
have put in like eleven thousand or ten
thousand dollars or whatever but
thank you
on this thing
yes yes an idea
oh bonus levels oh no yeah I didn't do
any of these levels I went straight to
shortness
that wasn't mine I did resources so
quickly
what's the whole point
no don't shoot me oh he shot me
all right
you're shooting or not
oh got a dynamite to the Fate
[Music]
oh no I don't have a Sparks anymore now
I must open this manually it's a shame
that
box doesn't send you the gems straight
to you as soon as you open it that would
be a bit quicker I'll look yeah let's
see here it says gosh darn it Spyro I
came in here to check on my prisoner
only to find out he somehow
somehow then when I came in and look
around for Clues one of them Rowdy
dinosaurs went and locked me in now
they're out there causing all sorts of
trouble and there's not a thing I can do
about it
I'm sorry about that
little rabbit
hi thanks hi everyone I'm actually I
know
this thing is in the whole prediction
system you don't get a high reward you
put in other points you don't get a high
reward that's nothing it's not like
you're doubling your points or anything
if you win let's not have anything
that's not how it works
you win everything everyone else has put
into the prediction
yeah so there's not really any points of
you putting a lot of points in
did we get refunds uh someone voted said
yes yes someone did
congratulations
[Music]
the predictions can get to
YouTube
sentences can get to being completed
[Music]
[Applause]
here we go
[Music]
you need to be uh yes
Full House
any tonight
he can he get the [ __ ] oh where can they
go get started
go
okay there's still another thing that
um one of the tags that
Rocket Man is using his shield
and then he's then he goes and
oh yeah right here or did I actually
break it
[Music]
no DC breaks and sensitive almost
[Music]
that
I've got some snow bullets oh you didn't
get that one Sparks you're not doing
your job correctly
yeah that's really close my hand
directing spikes
lazy dragonfly
who's getting first apparently the
prediction
that he took the parking in France
in my language is colorful
and I'll tell the difference in
Prince isn't that colorful now
I don't know
although that looks like Finnish Maybe
around me
oh look at baby dragon toys they're all
baby grains
oops sorry about that
[Music]
dinosaur fell down
[Applause]
dangerous machines
all right shut down the dinosaur get
baby dragon shooting on a giant I
support maybe maybe
maybe maybe
this is how I approached this thing
yeah no one thing with the camera is
just stupidness thing
I can't really shoot me attacking you
regardless
[Music]
yeah there's dinner
thank you
there's still a Sheila level left one of
them dinosaurs threw an egg down this
flooded mine
Daddy
one of the dinosaurs red dragon egg what
dinosaurs and dragons are totally the
same
sorry about that whips
and here again you spawn above
buying us a concussion
well that was close
and that wasn't
just close that was kind of machine I
never yes I can go to the next level
that has to see the level
wow wow wow yeah this is a bit picky
a bit tricky I need the swimsuit fits
now
Aerodactyl is a dinosaur but he's not a
Dragon Star so it's not the same thing
well thank you for
and coming with scientific proof I
appreciate it
T and T is everywhere
you march TNT
IC
okay this is going to take over taste
don't remember doing this though I'm
glad to have your help
I appreciate you being a help
Escape is a variant type
but not Charizard who is based on a
dragon just I mean
it means scientifically it still makes
sense because the Charizard could be
really like like close related to
dragons or like the dragon type family
of Pokemon
but
but like split off a branch
earlier
but what's the point before being uh
thank you
Elliot
Point that's some pretty cool tricks
inside water
instead it's just Skyscape Pokemon that
is a dragon type mean I would surprise
let's do another day
first person shooting
I should have promised me I could be a
deputy sorry yeah good luck being a
Jeopardy

Mohan

playing in the veins

dinosaur I ever did see I said jumping

shield 11.
so the enemy heats up the platform and
then it says then it stays heated for a
while but if the enemy heats up the
platform and then you kill the enemy the
platform is no longer heated that
doesn't make any sense

Story I mean if you flip up if you take
far off the Netflix it will be a lot of

[Music]
oh there we go

have four hands
why why why doesn't this game give me
Full House
what what do they have against full
hands
foreign
there we go
I'm back at the water extra Life gaming
not Full House
whatever
I guess
I guess the game is trying to tell me
that I should not get too greedy
it's kind of slows down your load is
working okay I can see you
yeah
so the computer is distracting running
the stream while playing the game
fair enough
some loading sometimes doing learning
things not always full hair makes it
easy for you to support that yeah
apparently
hello Hunter I've been training my new
pet manta ray let's go
oh that's you that's how I shoot okay
he's throwing everything
destroy Hunter
boy I sometimes it was dead no hey it's
hard to stop dense

done that yet
hello if
if I did that and Bianca my sexy don't
want me

nice
look it's a girl Dragon because she has
a bow

it's kind of kind of hard to navigate
away from the scene
you say he became shark food oh yeah I
mean I couldn't just say that
something's trying to happen
that's true
there you go that's all the chance can I
leave this
wait comrade Hunter is Russia now

but okay
Diamond complete
well well

a wait it's saying it's the same
and girl Dragon model but this time with
a bow
interesting
yes
who am I
come on Spyro don't do that
okay let's see him again how many times
I die trying this then
foreign
[Music]
ground
especially when it falls off right
yeah
look at that Mouse
no
no
thank you
sure
when we're flying all the way down
notes
almost Malcolm
one was that that's a weird name for
girl dragon
I mean I'm not going I'm not saying that
because
unusual choice of a name
Malcolm
Malcolm yeah Malcolm not Malcolm Malcolm
not Malcolm
[Music]
when it falls he goes we or maybe we'll
go is more like ah
oh yeah what sparks pick this up
wait didn't I break this already
yes I did
thank you
got a bunch of stuff in here too
[Music]
[Music]
wait a minute I think I missed something
[Music]
buddy
we yeah that's the difference
yes that is the difference I would say
there is a big difference between those
two
all right at least four spots
oh thank you for being another I
actually missed it myself
Crystal Islands
the weird thing is how you can blame
Crystal
but a moonshine
yeah like you can blame them then turn
red as if there were like metal
opponents
stop doing that
can we do that with other
enemies
enemies with metal on them flame them
and turn more and more red and then he
just explodes oh sorry I didn't mean to
attack you
but I don't feel any bad about it
oh
I should have checked if that thing can
attack that thing
because maybe it's a thing in the
original that is not postponing
for one spark did his job I found a gem
that you missed yeah that's like it's
only Point here but
yeah and these enemies are like in the
first marker level unless I mean
whatever is the routine and and then
back in this level
maybe they show up and now I don't know
let's listen please a magic trick yes
watch carefully
okay
oh no he speaks for so long
sorry I I messed up
twice I'm stuck
stuck again oh you have to be doing it
oh you want to see the truck
parents pick up his gems what are you
waiting for
they are huge how do you miss them
[Music]
and I'm saying that too because farther
County Sports in Canada like a thousand
gems at the same time
many that's not a problem
the box was making funny noises when he
hit him
a lot of the enemies and bikes and stuff
they make funny noise
okay
yeah it's kind of funny noise
oh you want to see the trick you want to
see the trick again sorry for asking you
to do the trick so many times you're
security
so
tell me multiple times
[Music]
let me sneak up behind this character
[Music]
okay gospel handset
[Music]
I guess this is clear now
now let's go in
the stuff
hold on Jim
all this magic is just misdirection you
know why why what no
this is literal magic look at this
oh is it a turtle
I think it is
the lab poop
check the bridge is already extended no
need to pay a silly money by
experiencing
I'm shopping but
how do you throw those things into water
without
this disturbing the water or the action
is doing the watching that's quite the
magic chicken
thank you
how about that
oops
you need to do that
I mean obviously nothing
look at that range
yes he still managed to miss some gems
in weird well I suppose I could show you
my new trick yes show me your new trick
wait a minute I've seen this street
before have you been stealing it from
someone hmm
well I did skip that part of the
dialogue he did say yeah thank you thank
you for asking me Hey Lloyd he said he
said that someone has stole it from him
but I don't know who I made it first
though
are you concerned I mean spy goes around
me
[Music]
let's do another slide
that wasn't the puppet
look at how dude's boxes
thinking of the gems fly inspires Sparks
Fly spider spikes
be right back I'm gonna grocery shopping
that sounds like a good idea have fun I
hope you find what you mean
[Music]
and then whoa
whoa
big peace line with him
good attack on the shopping Adventure
I don't think this will happen
oh
it's surprised it's not in the wrong way
oh yeah
yeah
that's what spices
[Music]
[Music]
oh it's going a bit too fast
we don't need to do itself
quickly we don't have we we're not in a
hurry take your time
careful now oh this is not careful this
is not careful
too fast too far
[Music]
go up on the nightstand that would be
pinned
wow yeah we could but then he is finned
off this is a bit tricky and I thought
certain
Easter in reunited
yeah just out of curiosity
when
I don't think this is supposed to happen
[Music]
[Music]
yeah I saw the game
assuming let's find his mouth here every
time I press the button
get let's get it why doesn't Inspire
have a tongue like that in dream I think
when
apparently you get stuck if you try that
strange had not enough to clip
you want
it wasn't super click where he went
but if you do want to say in a moment
I'm not against it
and show the people who complaining the
bugging
I'm full of problem that no I mean this
this game has quite its own interesting
[Music]
that was scary
that was scary oh no
it's oh my
I'm not used to click click clips and
chips I would like some chips
let me showing some chips with me
I'm going around to that later oh yeah I
mean yeah you could
generos go to one of the previous
streams when I'm not streaming or but
while I'm streaming always too and
create a clip as well
wow
is it gonna take forever
I've only got four laps left what is
this
I thought I was
the spiral master
uh I mean Master of the spider games
that's what I meant
don't hey Sparks you missed a gem
dying
it might even completed before and then
like I used another gym

[Music]
imagine if I completed this and like
now there's a gem missing oh where I
wanna snide
[Music]
spikes
is this this engine missing spikes and
Louise

a boy dragon named Eloise who am I to
judge
I don't know what box is pointing at

it's your only job here is to pick up
these gems

oh Sparks you're so stupid
you're so nothing secretary I need to
find key
I don't know
oh no
you know what
I do have to use the bathroom and I
think this is the last level is it
because then I could just do the bonus
level and and
oops
yeah it's a super bonus round no it's
just been waiting but the speedway is
quick I can't do that and then I just
finished up the game today I think
so I don't just leave a part of the game
for next week even though I did that
with clanover but
I still have like funny gems and stuff I
think
so I will use the bathroom a bit quick
and then I will be back
or more
Inspire including the bonus level
so see you later
foreign
now I might be able to concentrate
properly and you know what I should
actually start eating with cones so I

[Applause]
well well hey what's the next stage Max
oh Max works as a girl thing
foreign
[Music]
and then I will explain all these things
because you can't see
box refuses to
collect
to destroy those
and then I can pick this up which will
remove the
Grace which will remember the flying
ability with a nice big cap
that's all the eggs not only chance not
here
[Music]
lazy lazy Sparks now because I got a key
78 gems so far
[Music]
one here we go
I think I went the wrong way but
[Music]
I'm I'm on my correct way now as you
guys just jumped down somewhere else
instead
no between them
[Applause]
and now
I can unlock this thing
[Music]
with fat key
find the sammies and dog but I'd be off
having kids team thank you for being
here that's means a lot to me and and
thank you for being so nice
you are so cute and adorable too
and I have a good rest of your day
and con rest of you
continuation in the future
of course as well
[Music]
I'm
trying to find gems at the moment
Park isn't really
the greatest at 20 meters gems
right yeah
thank you Sparks for pointing me back
where's them
that way
okay let's see if I can go with that
point in
wait what
why are you pointing
all right
[Music]
yeah you pointed okay
strange ways
as I think people have the issue with in
reignited was which I wanted to discuss
this game is that it looks to be Islands
you can apply to but if you try use Thai
and that is not something that's
happened when playing this game that's
because there isn't really any
background Islands
but what happens if you do try to fly
off into the distance
you just stop Flying but so it's the
same thing in reunited
try to take I'm done with this level
anyway
146 that means three more gems
your swing thank you
hugging uh blushing
what do you know
basically
for the wall is depend again we
surprising the world and who is
preparing it badly it shouldn't cracked
maybe those cracks because it was a pain
[Music]
come on gems nope
our border Speedway
doesn't say Harbor
why they didn't change the spelling of
Arbor in this case because they did that
Inspire one
yeah I know I was listening to Sparks
let's do it
let's do it
I'll do it this one
[Music]
I should go against them but
I ended up doing it this way
anyway I'm gonna do anything around the
morning at the moment
[Music]
good
country delete this and
a hairstyle is doing everything in order
to find them
wait
come on spider well whatever give up
terrible
and it's Jenny's Bay
here we go
[Applause]
there's a very interesting sound from uh
processing
[Applause]
oh
there it is
[Applause]
now now it stops running inspired why
why why are you running
stopped running long time ago
when are the Paris now
there they are
wow
I missed the base
oh no
her Inspira run into its butts
complete
8 16 24 32.
[Music]
I Lobster yes Crash Bandicoot
stuff
there
Toby Club hobby I think it's a lot Maybe
okay
let's find the Hunter
he is probably in that building over
there
this is the lobster you tell me
like Hunter
where do these flying sheep saucers keep
coming from I don't know they weren't
this part two response so
anyway
[Music]
come on can I do this in one attempt
whoa that was close
almost messed it up
there we go I did it I was almost
messing with the patent but
spicy yes yes with three exclamation
mark
Sarah
I think you're driving without the bow
who's fighting
Connie's been useless as usual yep
raised the blue-footed boobies yep
these bumblebees biplanes
butterflies and boobies
they are not even blue footage
they are yellow-footed I mean they had
one job to make them blue-footed boobies
and I faint at it
[Applause]
[Music]
all right that doesn't need something
that the United correctly change them to
have blue boots
the main the main feature of them the
one thing they point out in name I guess
I guess if they just said
boobies someone would have some concern
but they are boobies
and birds are moving yep yeah boobies
there it's more the kind of boobies
[Music]
I guess there's uh there's quite a few
boobies in this game
something I want to remember that being
more
back in
that is everything that's where they
actually have blue feet that they are
other blue-footed boobies in somewhere
else in the game
but I can't remember
so
all right
then it's third place
another side look this isn't going great
it was in third one
yeah of course isn't
great for being impressed a kiss
ing them
assume that if I stop missing Stars I
would
be in first place
burn your butt
mister of course I missed it
wait fourth place
[Music]
oh
because in priests came he was the cause
of all the problems in the game yeah
the person
and then there's a type of bird called a
tit Mouse whose name is
and boobies
are there anymore
out
line
[Music]
come on come closer so I can burn your
butt
but I guess nothing
[ __ ]
I mean the part of coffee in that name
is just reference to being a main bird
[Music]
never applies to every prayer that can
be references to as a Coke
[Music]
but I guess you technically would be
part of the name
when I saw the
by the species itself will be found I
guess
can I do this
I don't know if it's quickly
that's the tip of the style
all right this isn't the place
this is the place where I was supposed
to go to early third position on a
certain lap again
and I'll keep keeping the separation
without making much progress I keep
using this time for that did
take it can it
used to have someone getting ready
so
[Music]
well I went over it
at the point that another word for Roost
is corks when they get for some reason
human named birds at least he needs to
make your version sex jokes and you
still pretty different
look at these tits and look at these
boobies
nice nice let's just start at this point
highest right
[Music]
like I can shoot these
but what did that happen for me it's
going to shoot
everyone shooting the leading
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
Ty
the Killer
when I'm only inside position after one
lap somehow
I think they made it easy
after me failing so much
now now I can use this because that's
the leading bird
right up his bum
[Music]
now I missed it
[Music]
cow
oh
that wasn't what I wanted to see
I guess I stayed on track at least
no
what
why
[Music]
this place shouldn't be this hard
963 into the rocks
[Music]
I thought I went through the store
around like the edge of the story
the game is carrying the protect usually
that was clearly Miss accepted
keep using these Stars keep missing
Stars
I guess I didn't go through this one
I guess
[Music]
I went around the hits
[Music]
hello bird
thank you
next to it is of course not good enough
bro you not get control
when I am in first place
I can't keep these system keys
for your second round press well
so then another message streamed today
at the moment for some reason
[Music]
oh no it's struggling
struggling at the moment
has nothing to do with me at the moment
well it's not mystery
go go go I'm going
huh
[Music]
yeah
[Music]
yeah
seems like some people have said that
there's some issues made
tea or something
Sparks yep pointing
completely different locations every
time
how am I supposed to trust you
okay so it's behind here yes
there we go
things should I
same game
I do would like the same game Count bye
look
yeah
[Music]
what I wanted to do
[Music]
wait where's the
[Music]
key My Moment
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I'm thirsty I want to drink something
I got over 50 000. always
Bianca time
foreign
hey you finally made it Spyro Hunter was
a little worried about you when you went
off to fight the Sorceress but I always
knew you'd beat her
why are you leaning so much format
Bianca
I always found the animation to be a bit
weird
this place is where the Sorceress kept
all her treasure
a bunch of Thieves came and stole it if
you can catch the thieves you're more
than welcome to keep the treasure super
bonus round congratulations
red hello
hello hello yeah yeah this is a second
possible here
so I should obviously
start a prediction for that while I'm
collecting everything in this
and this is first time you can well
interact with Bianca
but she got a cape
to get animation
like
foreign
[Music]
like that
I don't know
all right so yeah
and
I'm sorry that doesn't count hurts first
perfect for her three sets
yeah I'm going to
and let's go back in and
let's
let's have red come back
[Music]
in six five four three two one probably
I wanted my first
welcome backyards
and now
let's do this
let's do these
yeah
if you are subscribed man
oh that was easy she don't get it no no
but
um
yeah we're just looking at how weird
Bianca's animation is
hello super heavy Dave super day Junior
[Music]
that name
[Music]
should have been here not to see enough
don't forget about the prediction which
is running at the moment
how many times would I die when I fight
the Sorceress because apparently I mean
you saw the casino another video sources
first time she's not fully defeated
[Music]
she is back
practice vengeance
18 500 gems
okay there's a lot of gems
I like this now
I'm a snow bunny
I like snow
I don't know it just seems cozy
wow nice
that was rude
[Music]
I guess this is going to open soon
boom he's open
[Music]
well let's do this
time to sh camping chat something next
stream yeah
I mean sure sure I appreciate if you
want
hi Spyro did you see Bianca she was
really worried about you when you went
no hunting I I don't trusty Bianca is
cool
she's the only one who hasn't said that
she wouldn't believe believe that I
would do it
oh yeah I forgot the Jesus
which is why I had trouble keeping up
with them last time
[Music]
and my Boost I mean acceleration
and these are a bit tricky to you and
Target
still moving around everything
well I got to see you so far
yeah we need the wrong one
okay let's go for this one
this is
chicken assets
[Music]
sometimes it can well
trying to do some
[Music]
sneaky my nerves
wow wow
hey where are you going where are you
going
[Music]
where are they
do ticket on snare that means you like
snow
[Music]
thank you
no I had it I had to charge up
you had trouble keeping up with them
last time I didn't notice everything so
well
oh
you think so
Charlie and these things is now
yeah I have trouble
now why did it lose it's
if it's submarine you but
it keep
why does it keep losing Target
[Music]
here we go
no why did he die
that's
no
[Music]
okay this is gonna take forever
gosh why did this
just before it was done
uh in Spotify that seems appropriate for
an underwater Park section I guess you
could be wearing sports for inside the
summary
what do you have to destroy the orange
bombs anyway they're not causing any
harm they continue gems
that's the only reason
pumps they just weren't submarines
there's the same thing the spider in
writing but as you see it inspires that
yeah I got one finally got one of them
can you stop going back and forth
they used to be me I run into anything
to scenery
why are the anti so suspicious then
boom they are run by rhinox therefore
they are evil
that's for water yeah of course
standing here for me to
collect
but now they're back
no I don't think there was anything for
me to collect here
said everything how do you do you stop
and turn on time
on a dime in water
okay next next area
should almost be a prediction for how
many
paints this would be oh look he has a
skateboard in a snowy area check it out
this is the world's fastest turbo
snowboard course let's go
reference yes
I am the reddiest
I've ever been
I have never been more than ready than
this
those
yeah things sure make a lot awful lot
and load of noise
well I'm out of noise
keep up with the beginning of gems
how am I not catching up with them in my
course I think using boost
to have the whole Lab
I think it's cheating
I'm not using ghost in here but
[Music]
here we go
instead of 50 so what's going on here
yeah I have no idea what's going on
there I think I think my turn
yeah they were cheating so I don't think
you should have leaked the whole track
nice jumps there spiders
barely anything
oh yeah that was the one I wanted
yeah I know I'm not sure what's going on
there might be easy something I'm
missing
that's me shooting depressing fourth
position make everyone ahead of that one
slow down or something
no
it sounds
[Music]
and when are they
where are there Rockets
now it's crashed it crashed
I'm way too high
[Music]
oh nice
why are the Rockets attacking the crabs
those are not the opponents
[Music]
it's an attacking the crabs
yeah I'm not sure what's going on here I
think my tongue is
being famous Yeti snowboard Trace
Travelers
I think you can you just need to be
constantly finding the Rockets when you
can you know since day two home or they
can just hit the crabs okay yes they can
eat the cream so
not so useful Rockets
so I guess I'm just used to Rockets
because that's apparently
when I
was apparently for hits
someone with the Rockets everyone else
is long
no
foreign
[Music]
now I'm in first place
Victory shots
well well yes
yes
yeah we skip that I don't have gems to
connect
his tongue is eventually can't get
frustrated
[Music]
whoa Gratz
okay let's see
[Music]
I got gems to collect
s
I did it I've tried you actually allowed
to run
on foots on
[Music]
and not often they allow you to do that
you still pick this up this is
apparently
well I got everything on this map
my fly series
yeah right
nothing happens
apparently
it's super charge
38 is the maximum
lucky
okay
[Music]
yeah it depends on the name length of
the username because it's the prefix
that is because it's eight characters
because it's Pom-Pom 17. if I get a
partner I could ask for like a shorter
prefix that just one fun
characters
per emotes
[Music]
and then
of course using shorter names instead of
hype you could just be each
very much never think it's hardest
friends
I don't think twitch could do
is making sure that
emotes don't count towards honest
and the
Fountain same way that regardless of
which email today's it has a fixed
balance
it's going immediately fell off
I guess I just have to go around the
whole thing because Sparks disappointing
they see
can't pick up James
spices to one job and it's bad enough
all right
thank you spice there you go
I did it
let's just check that there's no more
gems
all gems has been collected whoops
death
paid
no more extra lives I can't die now
put me extra pressure the prediction is
still going by the way for everyone who
hasn't put in points yet
if you want to uh we guess how many
times I will die I guess the boss
like of course I only I well I don't
have an extra life we get game over I'll
just go back and continue the fight of
course
[Music]
two down five more to go
there you are
oh there can I heat seeking with metal
seeking otherwise no not sure what heat
they're seeking towards but
Target as Target seeking
go
one way
[Music]
um
that's the last one
[Music]
there you are
this is everything
[Music]
no I'm missing everyone 1999
595 000.
that way
two-fifths
if you say so it wasn't two out of five
it was two out of seven
it's the time left on prediction
everyone has predicted their
[Music]
what would happen if I land in that
scene
[Music]
okay
I wanted to try
when I should start the boss battle will
happen anyway so I should
do something about that
when
I guess at this time take a game over
and get some exercise back
I have to clean the volcano
okay let's let's battle the boss
let's pause the battle
[Music]
let me ask all right I can do this now
all right
and in that word there's one level
thank you
now
I got three is nice
already are you ready for boss battle
okay Prince
I don't have the as far as I can tell of
Sparks I don't have the extra hit points
it's kind of like they added it but they
forgot that it was a scene so uh do you
think what outfit I should do so you
don't do it during the battle it's four
and a half SEC means left we have two
people predicting two different options
someone want to go for zero no one has
come Syria yet
just in case that happened you know
just in case let's find you can put in
like a thousand four zero
right
ready
you you both are back
listening to sequence before the balance
touch anyway
but no one has put you know we need
someone to put zero and I just don't
relate for it to be fair no it's not
well has not started
[Music]
that's that that's you you have time to
put in the prediction
maybe there is time
there is time
[Music]
there's nothing being late to the
prediction
when I end when I stop accepting
submission I finally yeah really one
point or something everyone has up to
ten thousand points so seven point
everyone like equal or something
but that's after the game hey
you're too late when I when I don't no
longer accept this mission
isn't this updating automatic me or
something
I don't know if that's when you said new
to zero I'm not sure
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
well it doesn't look like anyone
speaking
I'm not sure hang on
22 minutes now
can I see what you're doing that's fine
again
it's fine if you don't want it it's fine
it's fine
I wasn't started right now
will you watch Bianca to her Idol
animation
after
assets
[Music]
anyway
um
I guess I'll start the battle and stop
accepting submissions
but at least one minute and 15 seconds
but
I don't know
[Music]
exactly
everything's fine
all right okay whatever let's start
around now let's start the battle
want to see hey
thank you
let's go
you're Mr borrow my Flying Saucer I've
cast oh she had more to say
let's go
you're going down
soccer ball
oh there you go now
oh she has a big sausage but B flat
Agony ass
thank you
I will and certain accountant
is one now
I didn't expect that to be an inspection
and I wasn't aiming when I'm watching
but
I was also not expecting to be an Easter
Kitty
so oh no she's I'm scraped that one
strange songs
I didn't expect that to sound so robotic
you think
she has a big sunset for her big but hey
she's outside Alan and he's the one one
so that's how it goes when you try to
cheat me outside the lemon
she's getting bit
oh I kind of didn't pay attention there
but that's my points
walk don't die now
there we go that's how I can say
yeah no
no
well I did it I always want this one
stupid there's but still one day
yang
well it is
[Music]
I don't know which which is which
the D and
one that was that was one this
kind of only thing with predictions
sometimes you can't predict stupidness
2 000 coins to order me on
a big cats growing twice this place
that kind of size of spider
it kind of makes sense but it's a baby
dragon
they definitely made that whole cutscene
much longer and think stuff in
but this is just more of the same
credits
but anyway
I didn't skip these guys it's just I
think clinics over again I guess oh
Burpee that's the name of that Dragon
the bird what was the name of that
Dragon I mean that's drips up a list of
options uh for names because they reused
models
I come back with a rocket apparently
let's check the atlas
there we go
twenty thousand out of
1550 out of 148 eggs
I did it
I did
I have completed the game although this
skill points though
does this count do I have to do these
all these key points anyway
that's not even a skill point
at least in Arena You're Gonna Give You
himself inside
doesn't really count too much to
complete business I would consider I've
done like 100 of the proper game and
understood like the skill points for
like
extra extra
it doesn't show you how how you get them
so yeah I mean
it's a secret
we're not going to tell you how to get
it it's the same game I mean I could
maybe at some point go back into him
if I don't have anything better to do
[Music]
117 complete
that is what it says
so
thank you everyone for being here
[Music]
that's the way they get you to buy the
guide
are they selling your mission game
that's the question
what are they working with guide making
food companies
[Music]
you're producing official guides
thanks for any steam her good rest of
your day thank you red I would like to
go and make some pictures
do you want to read so do you want to
follow along on a read if someone I have
probably not painted
no I have not read it
but this person let me open so I think I
should do it once I think it's fair
which are
a small group of people
let's do it
it is a streamer cool world faster than
Titan check how long they were streaming
form because if they've been staying for
like five hours they might be quitting
and it's only been two hours so it's
probably fine
it is a jelly filled zombies playing the
story of season a Wonderful Life
and streamer goes by the name Shane if
that's
and yeah let's go and say hello to her I
think that sounds like
a good idea
all right never seen this person yeah
I've never upgraded this this person
with her before so
I think
that I think that's a good idea and also
I need to put this who knows maybe
someone look at this board in the future
and yeah my links
if you're watching this body in the
future just go to
my patreon and put in another one of
this
anyway that's the uh usually TV
to cheering
well humanitarians but I guess that's
fine fine
I'll do four chinston
when it was harvesting did it change
name or is this a different name
it was last question I guess that's the
question
let's go there
foreign
