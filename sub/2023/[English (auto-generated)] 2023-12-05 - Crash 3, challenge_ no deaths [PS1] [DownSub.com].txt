so how about we switch things
around
Sony Computer Entertainment Europe
presents a universal interactive Studios
Production created and developed by
Naughty
Dog a very naughty dog that's an
interesting company
name oh sorry to har your
har harsh my
Grove I'm not experienced with this
expression naughty pun bum I mean I
think you're the naughty one for being
so focused on my bum to be
honest to be
honest is
that
CRA and if you feel oh that's the
accelerate button and if you feel really
naughty it just me this this game loud
louder than the other
game let
me lower the yeah the game is much
louder than
I
[Music]
probably yeah as long as it's not too
loud on stream do let me know
that is there a way to
adjust pame
volume it's perfect that's good yeah I
think I balanced it out on the stream
just that I think I balanced out for
like this game just the previous game is
so
quiet
comparison
oh
whoop
um I am a the generator I don't deny it
but also is cute
bum I yeah I guess I guess P has a cute
bom wait what was that I jumped over the
Box it's not that I'm going after every
box that's not a go cu% will be
tricky but still want 100% this
level but it's
fun do is a tricky cuz you see it
first get sing
level yeah
right okay oh
B think yeah this is everything there
go it's a
perfect as long as it sounds good for
you
people as usual if there is any issues
do let me
know just takes long longer time to up
the
gy I should probably do this level first
let's do the co coco level first yeah P
this is now is Crash three all of a
sudden if we're playing The Sounds in
the background and the Heart wait this
sounds weird this sounds
different hey this this L is is it is
that
that thingy that being so
loud
kind of overpowers the I miss the Box oh
well no
[Music]
gem did I miss the bo to I I I don't
think you should like that I mix missed
another
box I don't
know don't think you should be able to
miss a
box if you manage to grab the bottom one
on a stack like this the top one should
be grabbed as
well I know just my
[Music]
opinion
so
it promise very soon
I wish the extra Liv be M
instead who there we go P Pon replacing
Coco is pretty
cool in
my yeah the Chinese yeah
me the uh for My crash 4 mod
yes which will also include a lot of
different outfits
something has is there any other mod
replacing Po and crash with another
character and also replacing multiple
outfits at the same
time like a a full complete character
swapper
thing but this this level I can get
every it's the next one I
C this is also un
M yeah I went through this yeah now I
remember did another run of this game
which was the pass
one I did
complete the defeated cour wait did I no
wait I never completed the P I think I
mean I could go back to
it
currently I'm doing no death run we'll
see if I fail this one we'll see what I
feel like after
that this stream is
so what what are you
saying
what are you
saying why is this stream
doomed yeah I need
to I need to do the
bonus I did also complete not set of
course complete crash three without
powerups as
well proving the game was not designed
around powerups even if people want to
disagree with that
statement
the game was St designed around
powerups like sure the um yellow PA on
the uh dino level is actually designed
around the double
jump
but the
uh but you can still complete it with a
slide jump
so you could which are basic moves crash
has anyway which are not unlock
powerups so I'm so I'm going I canot say
for certain that H the game was the
levels were designed first and power are
added later it really feels like
it
but I can't see that that's the case for
second then it comes this
part got the
him and
it would be a dream come true if they
add one of our oh yeah yeah because that
would totally
[Music]
happen the hey what I wanted to make my
OC after the Maleficent Dragon what's
your
was think I might
just might have seen
it I don't I I don't
remember was is a c like oh yeah
yeah come like
that no I attacked
it he what what do you mean that they
might have had extra time while making a
game and started
innovating is that proven CU they kind
of I feel like they kind
of they put up a game like every
year
it is possible that they had the idea
from the start to had powerups but maybe
they didn't wasn't sure what what
powerups they would
have
or they wasn't sure they weren't sure
um
and
or or they had the idea of what powerups
to use but they weren't sure when you
were going to unlock
them even how you were going to unlock
them I BL the
IDE that that's kind of what it sounds
like why do I keep taking damage from
those
game is
cheating um and they might have being
Talent enough Studio to know what
feature that feature keep
yeah this thing is so loud now I wanted
it
damn I got a gem but at what
cost two masks I didn't even lose the
mask in my attempt of getting the
[Music]
gem I lost it as I was trying to just
swim
down this is another level I can EAS get
here so the only level I have left now
it's w he did not slide like I wanted
him
to
[Music]
is I hope I didn't say that too early
because I don't
know when when but hello isumi welcome
let me do the
shout the building shout
out so welcome welcome let's
see hello hello welcome
many
welcomes yeah you playing om Mori I was
watching you play there and
uh and I have no idea but I I not
experence that
game but it seemed like it was going
great but you are free to let me know
how how it
went I might have gotten the wrong
impression
I feel like this layout of the level is
similar
to another LEL
bonus and
uh I didn't realize how late it is for
me very
midnight
but
yeah welcome everyone I don't have any
form
of presentation for
[Music]
myself but I am ponny named pon
[Music]
pon I play PS1 games at the moment
because my computer is not strong enough
to play any other mod computer games and
um
I packed out my PS3 because I'm trying
to move but the agent I'm trying to talk
to has not responded to my he
made so uh yeah I don't know what to
do I did say you don't usually stream
this late
yeah I usually
don't but since I did other stuff today
I decided
to that's
you I usually
don't these are the off stream
scheduled can also
jum hey this time I don't need to do
this as a
pacifist now I can murder the Lions is
much as I
want oh oh that was
[Applause]
close thought there was dead
there
[Applause]
wa
few
of a lot of the
audience boo a few
chair and then it's only sharing at
end share on Crash CR crash crash crash
crash The Bash Bash oh no not that
game I tried to crash bash it's I got
stuck in the game I spent one whole
stream on a single
challenge
right let's do
this let's do levels
backwards okay more characters talking
we
don't we don't need
that I've been playing through this game
so many times too much
dialogue a sports way you find the
sports
way
hope you like the
Des I think
it's
go no not that
one
can how dare you
oh
well and my SP will be back in a short
moment there we
go ah much
better
so well I lost that
mask didn't mean
[Music]
to whoop oh almost fell down
there
got the gem on
this oh Coco can't do a slide
jump C the bandic
[Music]
cute do time let's do
this
let's see how it
goes what's the worst that can
happen yeah I think there's a MK on this
one are sure don't give any
LS
and the M that does exist on this level
is
behind wa I thought that was that
there this most
time was very who was very close to that
[Music]
one maybe it wasn't this level
yeah I was hoping that was
the yeah maybe it was the
other no it can't be the
one do I see a cobra from Crash 3 I
think I
think I think that's snake thing it
should be one at the end of level two we
can we can take a look at
it
guess I open that
checkpoint there's the there's there's
this look at
it that was a waste of a mask trying to
look at the
cobra
oh
well if only the platform next to the
Cobra wasn't a falling platform it would
be have been
easier but oh
well it is what it
is get a better look at it in the
remake
go let's do a single race win
here well no boook
SC
I do wonder if you go quicker going over
the
RS kind of feels like
it can I can I hit this one
go that's a
win and you
are especially when do that R then then
I'm
execute maybe I can use the Cobra Hood
from car 3 for my
OC for yeah for like
wait where would you put your OC like I
assume you're going to make a mod for
which game and what are
please
oh yeah because oh yeah yeah yeah wait
you you are Cobra dragon that would be
spy I assume spy yeah okay I realize
that yeah in that case go
ahead well that was that
one get
over
I keep forgetting you can't slide into
those for some reason you can't
slide yes because they're floating
but let's let's go back to the pacifist
R
then pacifist switching up the game here
not the game
but um
press
face and say the title should now be
different H yes so I completed this one
and was on my way to this world the pass
this world is basically don't kill
anything
sentient
or yeah don't kill anything say say
sentient
so if it's like a bomb in the underwater
level that's fine but I can't kill like
this
one but it can kill
me there we
go and I'm Al also not going to use
okay um but
yeah F was but put in a p was put in a
jar wait you want to see pon pon in a
jar see they shoot four times but they
only shoot three times in the
M
goodbye at least I'm allowed no okay I
have to die have to kill myself after
The Accidental murder they are robots
but still
do you do do you want like a jar redem
for pun put in a
charar he
see there we go and W that was close
checkpoint good P was captured and tho
Thro
wow he
that's not what I want p p to
[Music]
be go a reference Ty game yeah I I kind
of realize it after after my comment on
it
but feel like crash was the one
captured and
probed but we will see what happens with
pon pon in the crash for when I'm
playing this P how am I supposed to get
over
this nope trying to squeeze squeeze
through I mean after enough fails oh
here go that's I guess after enough
fails I will be able
to
[Music]
get a mask and then I can use no I can
still no I cannot use a mask to kill
them that's that's the whole point of
this try to not kill
[Music]
him landed on the
box wa
whoops I mean you could argue like is
this thing sfe
and sat and
whatever you I mean you could argue it
isn't but for the purpose of this
challenge it
is this SK
Beast welcome thank you for
following
what what
what when we have
a new
follower seem seems
in I oh
no crash that's wrong
way when that was
that likely uses cow brains
powered by cow brains
okay very good
my my sports for is
back and then I need to get this thing
like
that go back
can't okay so one was
appropriate
well at Le you have fun with
it okay back here no more mistakes I'll
wait out the
misses and then like
that there we go I did it I completed
the
21st level in the pist
run
whoa okay the uh racing levels aren't
going to be different since you have
nothing to
kill the worst you can do is scale away
Birds
but that's about it
yeah this level must be the one with
the annoying
box
ow R
much
where's my
Turbo lucky motor
racer motor race said a game that
declining quality for every ver every G
iteration in every
sequel
boom no box Jam I not even sure if I'm
going to win this race
[Music]
now
no about restart at this point would be
nice with a restart race but button or
something okay back into the
level
no let's restart one more just because
it's ah there is
back
F why I keep failing
that come on
now
I can do
this there we
go okay let's win this R
now
okay oh no too
far oh that wasn't much of a
boost then I have to use this YouTu
yeah problem is that it takes away my
Boost get away car
no that's a
shortcut
almost must bumped me up the road down
the
hle
no why keep missing them cuz the Boost
pad it changes your
direction they are kind of important to
hit
Miss oh
well did not
win
but it's a
St
race did I
run for some reason I don't who W I
think this
oh I can hold on to that place for so
long I think these races are easier in
being like in the
remake cuz I don't remember having so
much trouble with them in the remake but
maybe I
[Music]
did maybe I may SP at
these that this
rude then pass the
[Music]
way nice
I
at least I
didn't at least not resetting what's
necessary so close that close it I'm
getting
closer okay one more try this time
if I get the Boost in the
start
don't miss
it this
one missed it
again
got so close with hitting the side of
the car instead of the back of it
but oh
no far in the way I might have missed it
anyway but card did
not okay boost pad
no I I'm in second place for some
reason
can I wait cor it my turn to
win wa finally after like I don't know
how many
attemps too many
attempts
[Music]
okay back to level where I can actually
do the pacifist
TR the pacif Pacific does not apply the
bosses with the only thing I mentioned
at the start of my no death run was
that the lions are not the boss and
therefore I'm not allowed to kill them
which was which made the tiny the
actually hardest
person
um
okay
no it's
St
well it's
F crash crashed
yep crash
crashed I'm annoying
okay
so
[Music]
band a tongue action oh my tongue to
tongue well

before that was
weird well back to this level

sliding down uh last
[Music]
SL it's pretty good was a bit too hectic
for
me
yeah so like any
anything any particular funny
moments
happened
oh and I want to take that tack which
I'm not supposed to
do need to remember I should not attack
the enemies that's it that's the whole

trying to not do the challenge probably
properly come on open
doors
I destroy that
box but I'm I'm glad you for
you I'm going to hit bedight yeah it's
