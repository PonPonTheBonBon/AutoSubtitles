starting a bit early
so for the how how was was thinking the
prediction would work because between
every every option is H evenly spaced
out so that would be like 7 minutes 30 a
seconds and then we just check whichever
it is closest to that should be
easy I have a nice table here so I can
quickly reference when I sh determine
which is
closest don't have to count so you can
be sure that won't be
any mistakes so this is the level
amazing
waste where's the
start yeah I see where the start
is the
start is
there
rabbit Stampede a little Stampede oh pon
pon good news I might be getting a
better leash that fits better with the
bunes
oh and will it also fit better with pon
pon no one wants to eat this sugar and
popcorn because it's not a good combin
what have you ever tried the sugar on
popcorn
maybe maybe you have a fun on the leash
no more but Le yeah yeah exactly the Le
really need to go
higher I can imagine going behind an
opick unless you delici is attach to a
tail or
something well I hope everyone has put
in their predictions and I'll be begin
there's a lot of freeze times but I said
I I need to get used to to the whole
getting the closest because and one more
thing H just to be
sure if the time happens to be exactly
in between two options because
technically you have decimals when it
comes to seconds it will count to the
high the larger the longer time as the
closer time because of the invisible SE
decimals that would be the
timebreaker I hope that makes
sense well Shall We Begin let's see how
this map is this map is
crazy anyway let's
begin The Round Up sounds good
yeah and then looking at the map like
this I no they put like millions
of
towers
at the places where the flags are okay
first off I need to take care of these
towers otherwise they will destroy the
helicopter
immediately it was no called The Amazing
waste waste of what I don't
know where is the Fiel so early wait how
am I supposed to get out of here I
cannot cross this
water must use the
helicopter I'm stuck here right no
wait oh not
you I'm busy can't you
see I can go down
here where do you come
from
what an amazing level okay I think I've
destroyed everything close by anyway
SEC let's just go and get the
helicopter
die
hel
Cho
okay going to make
the here a bit
[Music]
safer
okay so the problem with trying to
access the flag place
is well the number of
uh
towers and I really don't want to try to
drive up
there cuz I cannot
see where
go on the
[Music]
map
okay Tak enough damage for
[Music]
now Hanah
stranger oh hello stranger to you
too om
Shredder sure
everything oh no I forgot the starting
that after again I kind of got a
bit you
know
distracted
bye
yeah whenever it starts up it will be
ready doesn't matter if you redeem like
10 20 of those if the software is not
running it's not going to do anything
anyway we should probably be running now
now you should
probably might be able to redeem
it yeah there we go now it works
got a bit distracted today for
reasons tramps valid
Rees okay missed one this side
okay now we heing up
everything didn't have mind to see if
something
changed
yay the Amazon I have to work
myself okay now we queing up this

hour Shredder yeah
they
sh welcome thank you for

pipe dragon
hype bit hard to read the Dron Parts
but
well welcome welcome are you wining I'm
trying my
best I am trying my
[Music]
best so hello
Raider when it says the group of one
does that mean you had one viewer or is
you the one
group I actually don't know how to TW
right yeah we do
I'm playing return fire on the
PlayStation one I have currently a
prediction going for how long it will
take me to complete this lap map La map
and it's based on whatever the game says
which makes sense so I don't have any
in-game timer I mean I have an on screen
timer there's no timer on
[Music]
screen is what I try to say
there
say get better
oh that's too many Towers that's way too
many towers that was a nightmare
[Music]
did you see that
night so good good I I have a a bunch of
lers but yeah usually it says The View
kind stuff
[Music]
with um yeah and then you have some
people that like
leave when it comes to a raid but I
would love to stick around but I pr to
tr yeah that fair it's fair it's fair if
you need to leave you free to leave I'm
fixing to
pass out so good luck
K that thank you for stopping
by even if it's a short time yeah I I
love it when people come by regardless
regardless of long you
stay good
night
what what if you go and sleep during the
day cuz I don't know what time is over
there mines mines mines blow up the
mines no
I need to go out of
here no no
no oh that was
close oh no this isn't
good
nope I lost the helicopter
anyway H and I did not destroy that
thing this is the biggest issue
here I worked so hard for it and I
didn't destroy it what was the point of
the mine if you didn't even destroy the
building the building might still have
taken damage I should do the
bullets
I just hope for I you got
flying well if the flyer thing didn't
come I wouldn't have
[Music]
F I don't know what you're
saying no
no
really why were they so active all of a
sudden sure but at least you didn't let
it get away I'm not sure what you're
talking I mean that doesn't mean
anything they despawn when
you disappear
anyway
missed
[Music]
well this isn't going
great
[Music]
really way too easy to get stuck
[Music]
okay
[Music]
so hey man just like one Tower up
there yeah I guess I need
to yeah I need to be High For This
[Music]
Moment
[Music]
wa wo wo two many
Towers don't missed it
completely here we
go
there we
go some spinning around
[Music]
it
okay
this
wasn't not going as amazing as I
[Music]
hoped we can open empty water he here
the
tower I miss the tower
on shooting too
far finally wa too many attempts
shooting
[Music]
it
reverse
[Music]
Goodbye
Oh it's scary
level
[Music]
This truly
is a scary
level sugar and pineapple pizza that's
something good
combination p p does not
approve but don't ask about her opinion
she disapproves of
[Music]
everything
no miss
it
okay I need got Stat one there we
[Music]
go
[Music]
double Towers sow double
trap I got I managed destroy quite a few
flowers
[Music]
there I mean
shouldn't be too tricky to get around
just not sure where I can go
around the map is kind of
Blank That's the
it and then when I do if I do try to get
in there I'm going to this the
helicopter is not going to be able to
get in there but the girl
hello
yeah i the power backs and I'm streaming
again
woo he got one raate so far
woo and someone has redeemed swimsuit
for like over an hour now okay timer for
doing the prediction is over we'll see
whoever
wins oh excuse
me very rude there just peaceful
helicopter flying through here and then
just starts attacking
[Music]
me losing I mean the enemy or
something
no yeah I did not do that
[Music]
great
well don't want to go to that
[Music]
one okay that wasn't the greatest
attempt so I do have quite a few left
there to deal
with
hi hi hello I hope you like the waving
pon pon I hope it's clear that it's pon
pon
waving so some people with the greeting
emotes have it quite hard to tell what
it does in small
size I do hope the fun one is easy to
read hello
scar scar
[Music]
I'm not making fun of your name I just
love to reading your
[Music]
name now he looking at
me
[Music]
no man to destroy
[Music]
some not as much as I was hoping
for
[Music]
combat
attack
oh what's down
here okay let me just
see
can I go over the water up here or is it
too far no it's definitely too far oh
no
okay okay
so this map has you in the dark creator
doesn't really show you sh what yeah
this is main beest
[Music]
problem
[Music]
excuse
[Music]
me you see I'm leaving why are you
attacking
[Music]
me okay so this
[Music]
is I guess it makees sense from reality
that the r wouldn't show shallow
water but from a gameplay perspective it
would be very nice if you
did
[Music]
so basically destroyed everything
so my only chance is to just fly in and
push I I don't see me being able to
destroy anything else than just fly and
Destroy
theing still annoy that and then I'll
just fly out fly in destroy the building
fly out that's my only chance
if I
fail well I just have to navigate this
whole place with the
tank that's going to be
[Music]
fun is there somewhere up
[Music]
here hey getting
excited yeah here it is oh they're
already shooting at towards
me no there's multip of them
no there's three of
them
okay
okay that means I basically have
to find a way around this
place
well so many turns yep I didn't destroy
one of the three building but I expected
just be one that's
me that was a
surprise
okay this is the other close by
scene no don't shoot the building we
need to keep it
alive
oh
man let's destroy more of these
buildings buildings Towers other the
tank is almost destroyed
so should probably go
home
is there there's Tower
somewhere I might have got some shot
scene on
it oh we got
H sorry
um too bad you didn't cat ships for this
level and I speak speak balance she that
would be nice hey what's up
guys how are we doing today it's it's
been a weird day today started off with
a power outage I couldn't start stream
as intended got a half half an hour
delayed guys great huh me too by the way
graphic artist
what excuse me can
you not do
that and like don't come in here and AD
advertise yourself that's uh that's very
rude of you to
like I can do things on my
own
yeah I thought I thought people knew
that that's just not much you but
apparently
not no
respect
so this yeah this is just going to end
here didn't me to go for it like
that
so this so don't take this pass
then
[Music]
noted you should drop a
like like I can't Dr off my warning
triangle
thing
if I had
one tank broken
down anyway
let's let's go back home when I'm so
close
anyway
and then I will I can't see anything
there
anyway
and then I had to take the second
one and this is up
[Music]
here
well
see
Towers more important Tower well an even
more important
Tower at least I destroyed several of
these with the helicopter so the less of
us right 12 thir minute and I got to
go 1703 well I mean the comments that
okay actually I just remember it it
doesn't say that on mobile but the times
are included on desktop or our and
streaming service not sure why they
haven't included times on
mobile kind of weird where am I
[Music]
going where am I going with this
tank it definitely looks to be the fuel
consumption seems to be based on
distance not
time
so because it seems to drain
slower here than on the other map where
I was going
quicker even though presumably it should
be time
because if I'm going through water and
the tank is going slower that means it
has to work harder and consuming more
fuel but maybe I'm just
strong that's not how it
works where's
my don't know knowwhere to refuel the
tank
[Music]
H go straight
home it would need to be based on wait
wish I'm going straight down yes based
on a torque
needed if we speaking of fuel only semi
listening yeah wasn't
yeah something something like
that I was just thinking if it go slower
in
water it would work
harder but maybe it's working the same
amount now
wait but again still feels
like
I don't
know the less bullet you have the light
DET tank should be less fuel should
waste while driving the quicker it
should
go
although
yeah this map is not going
great there we
go
L
roing why do I keep missing it I did
that yesterday a
[Music]
lot
we SP aiming
apparently barely made it
yeah
um
yeah losing all few right that
the fuel State fuel tank and then just n
that's just abandon
it okay I have an
idea I have an
idea
sugar and spaghetti for pon pon and pon
pon is blushing for some
reason ponon asked for Sal assaulted
sticks and instead she got spaghetti
with sugar which is not at all what she
asked for so she got all
embarrassed
okay so if I just skip over here should
be
possible and I think I just Prov that it
was
possible
okay go get of that so I can't access
that one was a shame I should put a Bach
there this level wouldn't have been so
terrible if there was more places to
cross over the water can't bear to look
at all the sugar being poured out onto
the spaghetti a waste of spaghetti have
you tried the spaghet
p
I think we got multiple paths but and
yeah for some reason oh another
Tower super Tower shot me another
Tower
go but I think I want to go this
way line ising which I keep missing for
some reason
why can't I shoot
it now
finally oh look at
this
this is quite
liing oh the person continued doing that
okay fair
enough fair
enough
yeah yeah you're
good doing a good
job
okay
look at this
destruction look at these things trying
to cause
destruction
oh
I think I should go back home and heal
up
but can at least like shoot some more
whoa bad decision bad decision attack is
strength to it's not too sad with doing
this
here
not sure what they would try to continue
I mean
next
actually why would they think that they
would be able to convince me if I'm
already annoyed by them advertising
themselves doesn't make any
sense
makes no
sense I guess people that just don't
make sense anyway oh I missed the ban I
had to go fish sh well go back to
um H go back to the Vault 17711 and then
watch it it's probably not going to be
that
exciting think I'm going the right
way you already said know advertis
Channel I think that's a r yeah don't
promote yourself it's
the you said you do your own artwork
yeah that too then yeah like I do my own
stuff I will look for people if I want
something as a fell from another Channel
I was waiting to see the
message
yeah yeah I don't like B people but I
mean if they even if they break a rule
and like I don't feel comfortable
Banning someone but if they continue I
mean in that
game it's really it really depends
on I mean they did not do really do
anything else here they said hello and
then they just advertised themselves
they had no other reason to be
here that's
just
yeah and oh no I'm on the wrong
side problem is say there's two squares
differ between
these
let's take care of
you there we go
now and then we have
you and
you
p and
you there you go finally
nice I think I should go
here oh I'm missing it
[Music]
okay no way wa yeah yeah yeah yeah wa
this is the right
[Music]
placee
oh what bullets do they take they should
take five of
them I'm starting to run out of bullets
I should probably turn around
yeah there's a place to ref and I
needing there it
[Music]
is
I see Technic oh Tower you need to take
care of you and
[Music]
you oh now flying R thing is
coming
oh I hate trying to shoot
him there we go
[Music]
finally
the one was the way back no this is not
the way
back this was the way
back and keep keep Che there we go yep
it just ends there good see I didn't
follow that one
down then I kept on this no I no no
there that there I did not I did not
come from where the tower was that does
not make any
sense very dramatic
music and yeah there's a lot of
concentration
here so I have to make myself
okay come back to
safety
so
have a good stream
hot well thank you for being
here have a good stream should I tank my
tank thank you for stopping
by
can't be careful I don't attract any F
things yeah I'm not very exper okay
wait go down
here I experience as a moderator I
should done so soon but I hesitated
thanks for helping me
out
[Music]
yeah me yeah
sure I mean I I think that was a fair
case of banning almost immediately
like to be honest it's the way like the
first thing you said off saying hello
it's not much different from those
people who don't even say hello and just
that
wait I'm going the wrong
way no it's took the wrong
path oh
no now I need go back good think this
wasn't too
far
oh and it's only been the
M speaking of
advertisement at least they pay
me no problem and a good thing to keep
an eye out
on Discord is account
age yeah that's true
too can you check
that no that's not available on Twitch
right yes we do have account AG on
Twitch as
well if you click on I don't maybe
that's not available on mobile because
why will it be available on
mobile nothing
is this you can check the
age of the
account hope that's
enough there not part to
home and that's
good keep an eye out on ref fler with no
message in a server besid
Che
yeah I usually B onite say c p b yeah
those if if they advertise in the very
first mes they're not
TR anything
think so I got
far and I got up there to the north so
there not much so found the so I'm on my
way towards the top
left place where there's
building but I really should take care
of the one top right first because I
don't want to feel like to spawn up
there she should probably take them off
if they spawn top
left it's not ideal but at least I it's
fine there are worst places the flags
can
spawn
and yeah and yes and I've had a bunch of
people
who every
person who has added me on Discord and
then like says that they are an artist
yeah every single person so far have
like tried to advertise their s to
me
right go go go
go
now this looks to be multiple ways of
getting
around and P is in swim now
for the water
level I do want like a
bikini a yellow bikini with blue
edges I'm pretty sure those influence
tellers are scams one there's no way to
confirm that their inreasing reach on
Twitch yeah they that is
true plus I wouldn't I wouldn't really
pay someone randomly coming to me and
offer me a service I would actually seek
out the service I rather want to play
for
otherwise being
suspicious I mean technically if they
don't maybe I
should if they as as a EU citizen I'm
protected by the EU right depending what
they're selling for maybe what if they
selling to
me H they probably need to be more of a
established business before or
four oh no I need I
keep completely forgot to fill the
tank to fill my tank with few no
[Music]
problem
there's a place to fill the tank up
here wait I S you said it will be 3
minutes of only count 2 minutes and 20
seconds well I
mean it really depends on what the
advertisement is maybe they didn't
dispar it's 20 seconds in that case it's
clearly they should be able to fill
another 40 seconds but like a 30 second
that at
least oh
well
are you complaining about having lesson
it is it is scheduled for 3 minutes of
ads you might not get
it depending on what ads are available
and
such
[Music]
there we go full
[Music]
tank W
sorry yeah it's a lot of concentration
this level not as easy to read the chat
I do like to read the chat but I also
need to make sure that I don't drive
into the
what I hope he's understanding
one this long like this and want don't
know the color
of time
[Music]
to
so there should be a bunch of towers up
here yep here they
are no find need a tower get
destroyed
well
I'm going to just be on a far distance
and shooting
[Music]
anything there we
go actually
now that's basically what I had bullets
for no please to fill up bullets that's
the biggest issue in
this
so yeah and then there's one down
here
they also don't know the colors of what
you're after I gave one a simple task of
a a tattoo
design and
then something something something
through this
[Music]
part
go uh and told them how I needed looking
but I got the garbage and that's a 10
minute
job M
yeah which makes me suspicious because
I've seen an so-called self
self-proclaimed artist I cannot say if
they artist or not but their
previews every single preview they do of
what they can do is always marked as
this is a reference even taken from the
internet and not created by myself like
show what the actually can make this
looks very suspicious if every single m
is like
this
so I'm sure you spend hours on that work
AR
as yeah why don't you f shift everything
a second nothing I remember at one point
getting only aren one ad oh no nestl I
think that's
Nest yeah this is right part true and
when I got a real artist that knows
tattoo on FIV I got exactly what I was
for1
go and I should probably getting going
now
early
yeah
sorry
see wait if you have if you need to
go it's out to
control but I hope you have a good
day thank you for being
here
thank you for keeping the community
clean yeah I had some random
person
and
add me on
Discord and like and they were like
hello hello do you want to see Arts I
made well and I'm not I
mean suspicious most people don't just
do that but but sure I mean I can look
at the art that's no problem and then
they shove off the art and then we're
like yeah I make
art for people for money or something
like that do you want something
no no I
don't I do
not uh let's
see when when I'm go in a straight line
I can
chance
fished one I had was one I asked for
references and had a
COR and had a bunch of with multiple
different signatures
oh it's hard to see how different it was
in style as well it could even get
St an artist has a set I mean an artist
can have multiple
Styles but
um but if they're
like vastly different especially if they
have
[Music]
like like no consistency at
all
that especially if there's different
signatures that's the issue that's the
biggest
issue but
yeah and I probably just use like if
something AI generated
art or something if they want to provide
something and
then then I had someone else come in and
say like hey do you want see my art and
I and I said I I'm not the one
to
say no so I mean sure who I didn't DET
turn and again it showed me at Art and
said that they make art for money well
I'm not
interested and for some reason they stop
talking to me after
that now wait that should go down here
here are the towers I'm looking
for okay so back to attacking the
towers I'm glad they are bad at shooting
bad at
aiming
I I know they're shooting down the
things that for blocking them from
shooting me
how
D shooting down each other it's well
nice okay I think
I I think I just one more but cuz I can
probably shoot the um those buildings
next
[Music]
time then when the third person came and
said that they wanted to show me
Arch I told them I've really got
like I've had then then
here that iied to be nice about it of
course but I said that every person has
added
me to then ask me if I want to see their
art as always uh then wanted me
to
uh
what pay them to make art for me and I'm
not
one and I don't want like I'm not
interested in that but I but I can look
at your art
regardless if you want to show me and
then the person went quiet did not write
me
back I wonder
[Music]
why I mean sure you could argue that
they would get upset for me assuming
they were going to
uh send me AR when they when they
weren't going to
but that's probably not likely and if
they were to get upset about that well
maybe they shouldn't do something people
who sell art
does like people who people who do that
usually are after selling selling even
if a scam or
not it's better to just go to like if
you just want to show off your
art find a nice community and show off
your art there
instead if you're an artist you can come
to my community and show off your but
it's not a place for advertising stuff
again you can show off your
AR
[Music]
you can link to your gallery and stuff
like that that's
fine and then people on the server can
choose to go to you and ask you for a
commission and that's perfectly fine if
you have commissions
open but you should go to
them and yeah desperate people are
desperate and of
course oh am my the rule on the art uh
channel on my my server is that it must
be your own art or art you have
permission to
post technically only per art yeah have
but you have the permission to post
um CU it could be you you artwork but
you don't have the permission posted
there are such cases and then you
shouldn't post
it
anyway and then I had someone else some
other person if that person is here
right now
that's it's is it's
like I'm not I'm not
like uh upset or anything it's just that
some Behavior can be seen as weird or
suspicious and if you don't in if if you
people who might be
here who tries to have done this
stuff it just it just doesn't look good
and
but I'm not like upset about
[Music]
it yeah it could be a good thing to
consider your reputation as
well
basically someone came and said that
they thought my Persona was cute
and actually talking about something
else I was wondering who made that and
like and if they could see like my full
artwork which basically is what I have
on stream and
uh and I did check their profile and on
their profile it said that they are an
artist and their commissions are
open and I of course gets a bit
suspicious but so far
nothing bad has
happened this level is actually not as
bad as during of
fire yes disappointed would be a good
way to put it
yeah
disappointed
again getting better I was better at
this before but then I got worse at it
so um and then they said that they find
my Persona so cute that they want to
draw my Persona I mean I'm upid like
it's it's fan
art obvious things still applies like
it's still my character don't
like you should state that it
is my character and
like
and
so you like
that but yeah like feel free to draw
that then said that they did like I
think like commission like draw drawing
for other
people
I think they asked me if I would like
something and and there we go that's
the they went there as well and I said
I'm not interest
like I can I can do it on my own like my
own
stuff and
um
since that interaction I have not heard
anything more from them that doesn't
mean
I this this Tower is really bad
aing now I
destroyed oh oh no that was too
close
yeah can't
really
reach okay what I can
do oh no not another one of
these
okay every flly buing has been
destroyed no so way too many of
these oh I'm almost driving into the
water for some reason I can't hit them
there we go I got one HP
left I got like two or three but yeah
point is I destroyed the flag
building now we got the other
one
but of
course so I haven't heard anything from
them since that interaction but that of
course doesn't mean that they're not
going to draw them the my Persona I
don't have like high hopes for it
happening CU it still felt like they was
just trying
to get me to pay for some
artwork but they might surprise me
but I do understand that if they're not
interested in
[Music]
drawing I really not in any way
demand ban art being
made
I'm on H fan art piece which is on dant
art with another A F of another streamer
who has since then changed their model
so oh
well and I did start on another piece
where I was drawing another
streamer who has also changed their
model but this this case is bit
different because when they provided me
with the reference art they used
the they were using their latest
reference art which the new model was
based on
so my artwork was actually up to
[Music]
date
I never finishes though I might finish
it someday but I don't feel like I
got but still
fun they had
their de debut of the new model
[Music]
and does make me wonder if anyone
to notice that the because the it's like
a huge difference between the old and
new but there are several differences
that that you could definitely see that
my artwork is based on a new one not the
old
one this time I'm going up because I'm
going
to to
left it still takes time in this map but
at least I there's one map that took me
3 hours and 3 minutes to complete
there's maps that take have taken
me 15 minutes to
complete they really need to fix
the like I the game is somewhat
enjoyable but it can times be very
tedious and if they just fix that
obviously this PS1 games and you're not
going to update the game but I should
have considered that when I made the
[Music]
game okay got a tower
here
oh
no oh no I'm shooting the fuel
think
no it's
destroyed no not one up
here when I'm going straight over here
oh there's multiple of
these
okay oh thank you for the help Tower can
I get
you oh yeah I good nice I do need to
remove this so I can reach this
Tower oh no don't look at me don't look
at me don't look at
me okay you're looking at me but you're
not shooting at
Me
Fly
okay taking a lot of damage so it might
be an idea to go
home
just clear up this
area re it from
here
[Music]
nope anyway okay so I'm
not I wonder if I can reach it next
attack because I think I've damaged the
the building already so I don't need to
do much damage on
it
R the music is being very
[Music]
dramatic
this is the last World of this game so
this some H there's like I don't know
how many levels CU it didn't take there
are multiple levels per
world this is last World so these levels
being so long as they are
kind of make
sense that shouldn't be
enough must be enough
well hopefully not every level is like
this I mean I wouldn't mind like a level
that
is where you can't get around with the
tank either
armored
vehicle they only have helicopters and
jeeps but they need less Towers they
can't have this amount of towers located
in a single clusters like that this is
very hard to attack with a
helicopter but I would like him M like
that because it sounds like a fun
map I see if there is such map
H home
[Music]
stretch this level is called amazing
waste
you're free type of that as you
wish can't got back so and I did manage
to destroy some of the towers that
so I got a few more Towers there but I
should be able to if I
just destroy a flag building and
hopefully the flag is not in that
building because I do have two more flag
buildings down here that I can destroy
and if Case om shred is still here cuz
you been I appreciate
it and in case you don't don't know
about the game maybe you do know how
this game
works but I I like to call it uh but I
mean it can be some new lurkers here who
doesn't know the game anyway so let me
explain
anyway I like to call the flag a Quantum
flag because this flag's location will
change depending on which buildings you
check at the start of the
game it was very simple it it appeared
in the last building you destroyed
regardless which order you destroyed the
mean
but in later Maps where they have a lot
of buildings it does appear earlier but
you still have to destroy quite a few
buildings before it
appears if it's like I know what I like
7 to 10 buildings or something it
appears in the second to last
sometimes and it is not completely r
random and I mean I guess it could be
but the the likelihood that I should
have seen the flag in the last building
for so many levels in a row that's
not that's not just a random chance that
that must be
deliberate that is why I have left the
two flag buildings at the down south at
my base CU I will destroy this flag
beinging here top left H because the
likelihood of the flag being in that one
is
decreased and it is an interesting game
design because it does force it forces
the level to play on for longer it it
makes sense from G standpoint in I used
to have a PS one but never knew about
this game not a lot of people know about
this game it's quite a rare
game well I'm back for a bit plans Chang
leaving about 30 more minutes oh hello
Adan I wonder what plans you are going
what your plans are yeah and I'm still
I'm still on this level but I did
destroy the towers the I mean the fly
buildings top right or Northeast if you
want
so now I'm going
Northwest I am
here
anyway and pon pon is still wearing her
swim seat because the swim seat was
redeemed didn't know how many times a
show every time the S SE was redem that
adds 15 minutes to the C cuz I only got
like to outfits this
like when I get to make my 3D
model that and then I will
[Music]
uh I will make because I'm not done that
drawing I'm not the artist of the the
model on screen I paid for that one all
right if I continue forward there are
tanks there are places to fill up the
tank
fill up this tank this tank tank here's
a tank which I can fill up this tank
tank but yeah I will make this with
model and therefore I will also make the
close because that case the cloth
consistent
time
all right I can't get over
here I wish your flying sink didn't
appear
I didn't mean to do
that
um
no why didn't that
work
oh why didn't that
work Turing
bunny I'm a bunny I'm a
I guess that's
Polish yeah
your well I have to take this very slow
now
because the stupid tank decided to
drown I really thought you could pass
overd
those overdose overdose of
War okay L plan change again prob going
we don't have to wait minutes for
him I mean yeah that's speaking of
things that has been disappointing and
annoying
before I fully understand
like like yeah things change but
obviously it doesn't change the fact
that I it's a bit
annoying especially if you like
okay we waited like a half an hour so so
a person can get ready and and then it
turns out that person couldn't even be
able to do it so well I mean it's not
their fault I mean things
change feel like moments
like is one of those more of a bummer I
guess you could
say oh
bummer
I might be laughing watching movie
watching movie and watching Pon P
500 Spanish polish and Swedish
yep I happen to know some
Swedish okay I'm going because this one
does take more fuel than the tank I mean
the drains more
fuel one was pure G yes knowing nark is
the
neighbor nark is the
neighbor do you know
Denmark he speak Den
markish
y can
snu no not really um I can
pretend well not really I
just
yeah well the reason why I happen to
know some Swedish is because when I'm
actually from Sweden which is in my tags
so it shouldn't be too much of a
surprise but not everyone sees it so the
tags aren't I got like eight tags in
there
so you can I have to open up the stream
which obviously have open and then look
at the Texs and not everyone does
that only like a few tags show up when
you find the stream I don't know which
tags it select like if it's like tags
related to whoever's looking up tags or
something well technically I was
applying logic yeah yeah I assume there
was some logic in
it it was a complete wild guess I guess
it wouldn't
beish
[Music]
and here's the real
Shak I live in the US where most people
are
monolingual
okay where most people are
also
people yeah the PE people in us are most
yeah and kind of like in UK too for what
they kind of tend to be that in English
speaking countries I
think well the reaction is basically one
one I was just learning English that
means I don't have to learn
English okay but there are some
interesting aspects of knowing different
languages although since I know Swedish
and English they are closely related
there are still differences but they're
closely
related that's like major difference
between
lives Cann I reach the FL willing from
here nope I need to go
in
well I have nothing to lose that will go
straight in oh look there was nothing
here oh well
boom that was the self-destruct sequence
Okay Jeep has a floating device with
it well then we just check the last two
buildings wait one more and there it
is then someone says well if it was
there all this time why didn't you to go
and check there n if only it was that
easy if it
I made it up here there that that's what
I
did level
[Music]
complete new
video more stock footage I don't know
it's
[Music]
stock public domain footage
hallelujah
[Music]
hallelujah and
a long
video to
the
[Music]
but I know a check person I guess it's
than to them I have gotten to know
enough to at least thanks
for that assistant had
about s yeah I
Che but
poish you won yes I did it only take 1
hours9 minutes and 4
seconds and the password what is this
password for but the password is for
something which is funny love funny love
it's kind of funny that that's the final
password is
it
that's 5, lost who
won 1 hour start
n oh yeah it's aan aan
one because
because uran was the one that's voted
for the shortest time
and and this time was even shorter than
what voted for so Oran you won that made
easy to calculate at
least
I'm oh I did win yes you did you did
well only
yes I think if we're going by how now
how
long you did win the guess yeah yeah
it's based
on the closest whoever got the closest
final
time I just makes trying to pick the
correct up option here 1 hour 45
minutes now I didn't want to start it
again uh come
back s game
what a silly
game
well SC again I guess is
the next level let me gather the uh
prediction
results and
my
this so you can put in a prediction
before you leave although I mean you can
use your phone to put in a prediction
too even after you leave I just need to
gather the
results before I can put up any
prediction because that's a which
works sadly there's no prediction
history I can only see the the like the
latest one which includes
the
uh yeah the latest one and that includes
the one I the one that I'm
starting just make sure now
those there go I'm rather it with 10
points oh no you lost 10 points what a
loss
and yeah that wasn't much but it's valid
valid
message
anyway well I guess we'll just start
another
one you'd have 7 minutes start started
before 7
Minutes one after before what next time
becomes
close
I not sure what you
mean sorry I
mean is the is the closest time that
someone has predicted
yeah the next time
becomes I can't actually hear because
the radio in the car is too loud
and
how many prediction is
on this one looks like a helicopter
LEL it does and this might be the ex
exact thing I was asking for where is
the
start where oh I see the start the start
is
there when the pr is
up are people putting in their choices
we have one
person
might actually be more than one
person whoever whichever gets the
closest including going
over 6 690 points it's 10 times nice do
you want to put in those points yeah you
should have got quite a lot of points
since um
since I mean the prediction ended and
and I played for quite a long
time I will the will go on while I play
the level
two
and let me explain up B here so how many
swimsuits do we have
now one
two one two three oh no it's
lagging four five six 7even 8 9
10 too many
swims like
150 minutes that's like 2 hours 30
minutes like the full stre minutes has
been I'm going to turn I don't know no I
are not putting in
money points
here well I guess I should start the map
then so people can get uh the second
view
then cuz yeah because I'm not going to
wait 30 minutes before I start playing
oh look look it's helicopter level yeah
it's it's the helicopter
level so it's exactly what has for this
is be a helicopter level with only
helicopter and jeeps oh no this seem in
a good
start oh now it's SL some come
on oh how am I supposed
to so
rude why isn't Ling so
much I was going to work myself towards
my base how am I supposed to deal with
that to shoot me before when I come up
from the ground really need can't use a
cheap for
this I mean I can
but yeah exactly they shoot me down
immediately okay this isn't what I was
looking for because there's way too many
turrets on the island I really should
have had a tank I could shoot down these
turrets before I start get going with
the helicopter cuz what am I supposed to
do to shoot down shoot me down
immediately I can't
move this is a terrible
level this is a terrible level yeah this
is a horrible level I was hoping for a
nice level of it this is just
terrible and they really want me to do
something like that
yeah if this is a game
away like what am I supposed to
do maybe I shouldn't have had a game
option you know so I
can there we go
finally it would be nice if I didn't
keep me think but that's my fault
obviously
yep what a terrible level I was for a
nice fun level but then then just turn
into this
this awful
mess mine game
over who game over
one
well that was a fun level wasn't
it there was
I mean at least would have worked if I
had some
tanks
hi
okay I'm going to do something radical
I'm going to remove the game over
option this means
that
now if I get the game
over I just
restarted and the predicted time is just
based on how long
how long it will take to complete level
from the last game
over it's based on what every game
says is there anything I can
do I guess you can try to just
flee no no oh I get
shot no he still see
me
[Music]
this is one my
[Music]
targets now
no
no a
a oh I'm so glad I took the C going be
uh Wednesday in South Texas in November
well sounds
[Music]
fun okay let's get R of some of these
mines
[Music]
so I've secured Island
[Music]
go go go oh wait what oh oh helicopter
died yeah helicopter
died I did well but I didn't perfect
lost one helicopter but I still think
definitely better than my last
attempt
[Music]
okay now to fly back to base and figure
out which plac is to
[Music]
attack
I should probably
go bottom
right because I probably should go for
the for the place that is hardest to
attack
first
I mean unless the flag is in one of the
other places
but that is a
possibility
[Music]
okay so I cleared off for the L
here now I just need to figure out how
to get back in my base
[Music]
is
[Music]
doesn't look to have too
many Towers
there
tow to
rout tur now I
can't Tower turrets turet tows TR
our you know what I'm trying to
say I think that's for
B oh no
no I mean I destroyed one of the flag
buildings I guess it wasn't success in
that
but and the next to is now as well
so there was a success in that too kind
of annoys me that one of the towers in
the corner that
survived
[Music]
oh too far
sou there we go
finally okay
good
so now to figure out where to go
next
well we're close to the restaurant so
I'll be taken up
soon
okay
okay have fun at the
restaurant find something nice to
eat
[Music]
find something eat
[Music]
tonight
[Music]
all now shut in the
water nothing in the
[Music]
water but I didn't think that was a too
bad
run getting done better but my goal was
to clear off the
towers that got in the way first I think
I cleared out a few of those so here's
the level that teaches you how to use
the helicopter yes it's more of the the
level
that test your helicopter skills rather
than teaching you I don't I wouldn't say
this is a teaching
[Music]
level defly puts your helicopter skins
yeah
what I'm not taking any risks because my
last helicopter I better go back in
[Music]
repair
okay
gave it a
try I the wrong
[Music]
monset d That's How did
slow and steady yes currently we only
have one thing predicted for I mean
that's an auto Wing because it will
automatically be the closest
one and here's the restaurant okay have
[Music]
fun have fun in the restaurant
[Music]
eat the
[Music]
dash
[Music]
I think I've destroyed enough to like go
for the flag
[Music]
building I hope
so anyway going to take off again good
luck love later byebye Aran I let you
know how it
[Music]
goes maybe I guess I wred that on the
server
okay now
I was hoping I just pass by and then go
for
another another attack but no I got hit
and therefore I had to start
over
no going to take a few attempts back and
forth there we go now we got two options
really good
for wait is still open for another 15 or
so minutes
so plenty of time when I struggle with
opening this fly
Bing not that
one this
one wait
this
interesting there we
go
now let's
see where's the next place to go
[Music]
to oh
okay so oh no those two are pretty clear
[Music]
together that ain't
good gu I don't have much of a choice
then
I shouldn't have done
that shouldn't have done
that I missed the building
yeah totally only to have one helicopter
in this level I I started with one trust
me
there we go that's what I
wanted now to see if I can get the other
fly was home oh it's there oh
nice right where I
left
[Music]
me
[Music]
okay so I would say that wasn't too
bad
got of a tow
[Music]
so i' say was pretty
good
[Music]
but let's see if I can get a of
[Music]
more
good to
nice oh all Towers
nice okay so there's one
missile and I almost hit that one
with it's this one of those bases left
[Music]
with
[Music]
May he's now get shot down with his
last getting ready
clust
that I forgot to check us but it was
some somewhere up here somewhere over
here find lot of flly buildings but not
the
[Music]
something think I should checked where
it
was so now I just need
to check all of things
[Music]
game we running have to
[Music]
tune oh
no I can't find
home uh found home
good that couldn't come
bad there was so many places left with
flags D ding
[Music]
ding
[Music]
this one up
[Music]
here
[Music]
missing
it not in that one I
[Music]
think
don't North East there another
one I just have to
continue
see if I can find
it somewhere up
here there it
is there it
is there we
go boxing through don't mind
me
[Music]
oh there it
is now let's see if I
can sure I can reach
it
with did
jeap I should definitely take out this
Tower
[Music]
anyway deep
time
time y got
than
hopefully I don't St upon un endanger
it
this is definitely the right
way there it
is there the
[Music]
kind of forgetting how it
[Music]
guess
hry back with the
flag running as fast as I
can cruising across the
water rushing with the
flank as fast as I can to the
base
[Music]
the music is very
exciting
[Music]
excit
wa that took like
[Music]
minutes
yay yeah every video every level is have
the same video would be funny if every
had a
video 29
and 1 there 29 minutes and 27 seconds
that means that you ever predicted this
lowest time
wins
and it's 2 hours and 45 minutes which is
about 2 hours and 50 minutes longer
than but
congratulations to Red for predicting
that that means that red one con to Red
if you're
here you won for once how does that
feel
to not once again
D I
mean these levels these levels heart
attack you gave me a heart attack gaet
what if I do G let how about
that
so starting position here then you got
this
let me take a quick look
at
fun playing I'm I'm here to have fun
right wait wait there even more levels I
thought this was the last word
world appar not they go off screen oh my
oh
my oh no helicopters yeah I'm not going
to be able to go through this with
helicopters
anyway let's
go go go go go
for
yep
there they're destroying
themselves if I reverse this they're
going to destroy themselves or
something
apparently not you
though not to
you okay I can't reverse through the
whole thing because there is trains in
the
way
I
but it wasn't ni
say
is
so much
destrction
so many trees that has to be
destroyed oh
out of
munition time to go
back
[Music]
oh yeah and
then gaet
don't I'm trying to make a joke there
but I'm faing
so what's the
one way to make these things like here's
the end of it no it is bit
more
son I have to fight
this
I'm Sho
each went really quick at the beginning
but now
it's now it's showing
that's not going to be that
easy I Wish I Had A rad in the middle
instead of
[Music]
tre yeah actually reaching the flag over
there is good to take one
like put in your predictions
or what you think it would
be
it does look like the missile but it can
just be the PlayStation Graphics because
sometimes they layer things in
correctly getting stuck
in
they made a symbol youing the mind over
there
problem is of course have helicopter
destroy
me
[Music]
okay
is an
interesting I know it's breing
to
he slowly working itself through the
one I prefer if you didn't shoot
me it's
nice
s oh
no good this what
day when my sh
disappear it scared me a
me but I'm still alive I'm still curious
about the whole mine thing good thing I
was chose the left side or the West Side
old the Min on the
inside
well it broke through the wall then I
just turned
more that's was my
fault
what do you have so far um yeah kind
of reaching
some
okay hopefully it doesn't shoot me
more you sure sure shoot a lot don't try
to shoot me I'm just a friendly Brown
heavy vehicle with capability
well it's supposed to have the
capability to lay mines but there are no
mines in single
player I mean not any I can lay
down are still
mines oh
no
this isn't
good okay I need to flee sorry for
running over your
tents you can Destro your
intensity but those mine's being bunched
up there on the side I'm really curious
what it looks like I'm really curious
what
just trying
it I wonder if I should take one of the
tanks and
just detonate all the
mines
cuzz I'm not sure if I can access the
Min no not a
jeep that might not even let me get
close to the to the
mind and Sh moves
Queen
got to go
fast that to
SC
oh there they
are okay that was
all no one has a tank I want the
heavy wasn't too exciting destroying
them they like it's like they placed up
placed a lot of towers I could not use
it helicopter but then they
didn't even give me
helicopters I guess you could say that
they didn't give me helicopters because
it would be stupid to
helicopters but they wanted to give me a
reason for not using
helicopters I didn't
know
I
will did someone say Spaceman

house
more so let's just do a nice
raid to Mii because she's a cute one and

says about yeah it says LGBT qia plus
safe space so can just be that it's is
community with that doesn't mean she's
any part of that CU there's no
information about it
so don't believe I didn't win no I'm
sorry Rocket Man yet again you have lost
