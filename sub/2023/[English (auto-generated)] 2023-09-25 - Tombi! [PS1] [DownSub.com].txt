surprise 10 seconds
[Music]
darly let's go back to the
game so who do we have
here jetto
Aran
roxies hi
hi so I think I'm not excited show what
the oh yeah this is what I unlocked last
time yeah I'm not sure why the first
redem reset because I think because I
did when I started the streaming I
forgot to change the right the flower
tower s fish acquired was this all cuz I
didn't see
anything
well
oh I guess I'm going down again what a
weird place and a whole loading s for
too but yeah yeah so heard reason they
changed Tomba to Tomi in Europe is
because Tom is the T gra
as FAL ground oh no let's destroy the
platform
[Music]
here well that might be the
case cuz I think people seem to ignore
when it comes
to so what am I supposed to do now when
it comes to uh the European version of
names is that sometimes they are changed
to work
with
uh the European
languages think you try to dig a new
wait maybe I
should what was I know there's one place
was oh no yeah yeah there was the
underground tunnel too there was another
place there maybe it's
done uh yes here's
here and so for for example one one of
the Kirby games is for I know the the
name in North
America is uh oh look like
mod clear s points H is a Squeak Squad
which in Europe was change to Mouse
attack which some find weird why would
the English name
change because uh I don't think the game
has different names for different
languages it's just called Mouse attack
across the whole Europe and therefore
they have changed titles to something
easier to understand if you don't speak
English like at least if you don't speak
English
well Mouse is very common word to learn
and attack is a very basic word too well
both squeak and Squad are more advanced
words let's see I him not to but my
partner went
inside inside here
okay oh I
see can I speak to you I want to dig a
tunnel over there but there was already
a really weird room what
okay sure
are wait what's I think I will went
here
yeah so I need two more
people so they just going to stand here
good luck
tumy I don't even remember what the
voices I gave them I can't speak to
anyone
else
yes and was more like she this one
minute L my brain is tearing have fish R
so I guess I'm doing
normal
yeah
sometimes sometimes it's like
that not
great what that oh yeah yeah
yeah there's more here but how did I get
there
though what do you have to
say have you met a milli million year
old man yet yes I have there we go oh
okay let's go here
first wait I think I think this is just
the regular place
yeah I he cleared
out so here's yeah
this Char Wings don't need
that one the pleas I hardly get any
visitors anymore did you see the door
that won't open well I think I've seen
it bamhi Thorn acquired oh wait is that
what
the which
[Music]
want
so yeah maybe
[Music]
maybe
H some looks like Broly with his his
green hair what's I don't know what
broing is oh yeah that's disgusting guys
urinating in public on a flowers yeah
but they made the flowers you grow so
it's good how many friends have you
found five
seven I think you got that answered H by
the game already
but
you me sorry
I'm missed wasn't paying attention
welcome look the kute
witch
think cuz I'm pretty sure if I use like
big jam it doesn't work but I can use
this look like you're missing an
ingredient you still need the silver
powder for the recipe to yeah I'm not
sure why they put the sil powder like
the first
thing yeah where no idea where the sil
powder
[Music]
is yeah I forgot I had
the version that can one hit kill them
W
[Music]
again there we
go okay or
that
okay there was another character that
was digging which was in Phoenix
Mountain if you had something made of
silver you could just save some
harders
sure but what if there needs to be a lot
of silver
powder cuz it was a character dgg in
here I'm
[Music]
sure
that's okay so I can't kill
[Music]
those good to
know would have been nice if I could
kind of disable them which I guess is a
weird term to use for living organism
[Music]
but although I guess living organ can be
the
same but in a different
way make them
inactive what happens if I take one of
these then oh it's instantly shoots of
the
[Music]
L
no
okay you're not done we back to work
okay yeah
[Music]
okay that did not
[Music]
work
so
wait what more did I have to do what to
see if we
got Something's Cooking
prob it's me can that's one I'm working
on tree of knowledge go to the wise old
tree wait wasn't I already
there wasn't that the old Tree
Hill but unfortunately it can never be
so
easy
yeah
like I can't speak to the tree directly
but I can't speak to the
pirat for some reason Collin me there we
go why what is it is there something you
want to ask the see ah the five golden
items wait a minute okay oh you can
actually speak why you're trying to
gather some things that are really
difficult to find ready don't three says
should I notice
down you
know the Golden Flower is in a dwarf's
flower garden okay golden
flower dwarf's flower
garden the golden fruit is in the bakus
Village Gold
Fruit
BOS
Village and the Golden Leaf Butterfly is
in the hidden
village golden wait I already got that
one and the golden can is in Rich H oh
yeah yeah yeah so uh when I get
the final ingredient I'll get golden can
then there's one more but he says he he
forgot but he says that the Motocross
course sounds V
when golden
something M cross
course as for n of the items you need to
do something in order to get them okay
three of knowledge ni
[Music]
clear that I to
do I assume if I talk
again I
can which wasn't
easy I just going to repeat the same
thing
okay motorcross they have motorcycle
well I had some motor
vehicle what is say what was
the S fish a special fish from ancient
times eaten it might give you
extraordinary
powers doesn't sound should I eat it
because I do have
um The Golden Leaf F FR golden fruit
already so what what I have left is the
Golden Flower and golden candy and that
golden something which I don't
[Music]
no okay let me
save it's a golden motorcycle isn't that
will be
something and let's eat the sacred fish
and see what
happens and then I can undo if I don't
want that thing to happen that sounds
like a good
plan
you s a
fish you second a fish okay
[Music]
oh
[Music]
please what
[Music]
happened
[Music]
I'm sure what
[Music]
happened there we
[Music]
go be
[Music]
quicker
oh there we
[Music]
go so I fell down or something then that
go
house all
on oh I see I
see I didn't know this was a
thing that's PR
useful oh it's want to hit the green
part okay so
I can't equip the secret
[Music]
fish good well that would be one word
but um I'm don't thinking what I'm
supposed to do
now
[Music]
the seven friends in real evil pink am
working that there's still like several
quests left I assume like even though I
get to real pig I still got plenty of
quest like like this is the first
optional
Quest I just miss a quest
here then it put to with something you
never seen before i s on that
one got blue
[Music]
Powder okay let me go back to
the the mushroom
[Music]
Forest but if we want see golden fruit
that would be
J
it know a
[Music]
DF of course so I can't kill
those until they open
[Music]
up
[Music]
no I didn't want
that
[Music]
where's my
[Music]
own so
maybe for some reason I want to feel
like there's some Secret in
[Music]
here it doesn't want to open up no
wow it's attack it attacks me how dare
[Music]
you all right all right all right all
[Music]
right I can't attack myself because I
don't have
[Music]
the there we go
[Music]
no
[Music]
[Music]
ow I just
saved
[Music]
you know say before before I to the by
for Forest
[Music]
yeah for some for some reason I feel
like there should be something more in
here this is so hard to navigate this
area on Facebook of native H speakers
who are learning Swedish
oh that's
[Music]
neat there we go almost fell off
again oh someone fell
off
no just loow SL down
with this preventing from using the
uh attack
which I prefer to
[Music]
have may I really want wish I could look
[Music]
down look go or go go to an edge and
then carefully climb down because
they're supposed to
[Music]
be yeah
there there's the
[Music]
flower got
that maybe there isn't maybe I'm I'm I'm
thinking wrong here
being able to look down would be really
very helpful yeah that's also thing they
need to add to
[Music]
the I thought there would be something
here
but I guess
not I can do
that I don't need to do on that
[Music]
one which s hav i not been
[Music]
to okay let
me let me
check if I go back to oh this the trick
Village hor Village
again oh yeah it was
that
and this
[Music]
strange they can just bring some I don't
know people from somewhere else so I
have
the person
from
[Music]
this person with the dwarf
Forest that's also something I need to
write
down dwarf Forest I got one friend
from then there's this pirate looking
fella where was that from I think that's
from Haunted Mansion
if I'm not mistaken
right Haunted Mansion because I I think
those are the people that live
there then this person is from
a h back go Village and this
person is
from
the uh station vage what was called so
what I'm missing
[Music]
is well there's no one in the mushroom
Forest so that's not an option it would
be someone from the Phoenix
Mountain you're missing The pantless
Boatman maybe he can
help yeah I haven't I think I haven't
been
there
yeah maybe I should go and
check I wanted to
see if it was someone here because there
was someone here
[Music]
before and there's then there's this
person here but the same person
that yeah there this person is not going
to help
me okay let's go to the pantless boat
man I think that was mushroom
[Music]
Forest
[Music]
but let's take the safer
[Music]
outout so I think here we go because I
can swim
so I don't need the boat oh look here it
is hi there we meet again did you want
to ride on my boat okay but I'm pretty
busy so I can only take you one way okay
he doesn't want
to but I actually do know where to find
number seven I won't say anything that
oh oh you do
know
well oh no he disappeared I can't work
to and place that was open for one
[Music]
moment I uh I only know number seven
there's about six one of
[Music]
them what was it seven friends I don't
remember
[Music]
I guess I'll go back
to Village of civilization because I
haven't really explored that area since
I cleared
[Music]
it because there's the
whole underground area there where I
[Music]
never okay let's start here
I only got a friend from this place but
might be a second
friend there might be something else to
get from
[Music]
here
look see there was the second person
here is it gate near M if it's a for you
I'll do it
good thing I
[Music]
checked so my idea of checking every
place for one friend is apparently wrong
because there's two
here I guess that was not say five
friends from or
[Music]
something I'm so
[Music]
[Music]
confused but nothing
it
[Music]
let's take down
here all right I need to go down
[Music]

YouTube is that the golden something
Grand press bracelet
clear with zero
points you get the bracelet back
apparently
2,194 I assume you should have it as low
as
possible took 8 hours and 23
minutes 24 events found and 118 cleared
can I continue playing game over
no apparently not at Le you don't get to
save
so so I guess I could clear off the
remaining events I probably have to look
them up because I
can't I just can't find
him how be game gets a game over yes the
game is
over okay
so
because I'm not going to be able to find
it I wanted so should I just look up how
to do the remaining challenges to
remaining Quest
[Music]
because uh yeah like there's a lot of
empty spaces
here I really I really find
it
weird I want tell you you won't tell
anyone that I L looked it up okay let's
start with red plus blue cuz there's all
Wiki with every events here so no
problem
let's see red space plus space blue
space equal space question mark can I
enter that is that even a
valid doesn't doesn't even a valid page
name oh so much
[Music]
ads that's not what I
wanted H we
[Music]
go we right back
okay there we go now I can't visit the
website Lo removes a lot
of
ads which makes we yeah or phandom more
varable anyway it was red plus
blue equal question
mark is event start this alignment
T
oh
yes yes
yes by just looking at the no not exit I
want to go Titan just look at the
picture it kind of gives me a hint of
what to
do without without it literally telling
me what to do so it was something with
mushroom for I I had an idea that it was
something with mushroom
Forest so you
see I've been running around to try and
figure out what this kind of red plus
blue
is I got the blue Powder was something
in musroom Forest that is red what in
the mushroom Forest is red I wonder
[Music]
what whatever Could It
Be I'm just joking around it's very
clear what it
[Music]
is
I need to clear off
[Music]
the
[Music]
sneezing
[Music]
mushroom there you so what in the
mushroom Forest is
red why is not orian
[Music]
here
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
many
[Music]
but yeah anyway the red things are these
things that was kind of what I was
thinking at I've used blue powder on
this thing so now I can use it use blue
Powder it turns
blue then so just grab
it by still have the
[Music]
prob do I go and talk to the
[Music]
person the thing was in
the the
square
[Music]
[Music]
so I did it
incorrectly can I obtain
another blue Powder otherwise I just
game
again I would never death out on my own
let's see if I get another blue
[Music]
py yes I
did it's been
fine there we go so I need some place
where I can
throw red
[Music]
mushroom into another red
[Music]
mushroom okay I guess IO the came anyway
[Music]
then aran's back
okay so I'm not sure how much you
heard but yeah should should apply the
blue powder on a red thing in the
mushroom
[Music]
Forest the creepy flower
[Music]
Forest so that that's much I was cored
about but but yeah where is the red
thing in this mushroom Forest
well I don't know do you have SE in this
mushroom
[Music]
Forest there be flowers in the
background or is this thing
[Music]
here boom it is
blue and then you grab it and throw it
into that one and then you get the new
mushroom how you supp this out on your
own I don't
[Music]
know and this
mushroom it did not get added to
my inventory
[Music]
though there we go not sure what that
body delayed
[Music]
but
[Music]
oh yeah don't ask me how you supposed to
figure this out on your own
but iron TBA is now
available oh found a half empty can of
soda on my
floor
is that
from
seriously oh I completely haven't opened
this one milon old
[Music]
bqu forgot that that was a

cheese for here and you don't want

wait so I got every except the golden S
I had and of course that's but when I
complete those the game is over
so what I do have here
is
uh heard the animation before that may I
look that
[Music]
up
it doesn't show
me says 120 of 124 is that that complete
120 because but there empty spaces here
so 1 2
3
four five six how can it be six spaces
plus these if it's say or is it that how
complete wait yeah it's no wait don't
know one un yeah yeah yeah yeah there is
yeah yeah yeah I've completed 120 of the
102 I have on the list okay yes yes I
see I cheese now I gave in 15 pieces of
[Music]
cheese okay apparently this is the
first so this list ends here and the
second list just starts here I I don't
know that's another thing they could fix
in
the in the remake please have like
because you have the event list like
this events and then you have VI how
about having like primary events and
secondary events there two options
instead that's an idea and then for
eh since these are not events this does
just doesn't
exist have have it so
every so far not found event is like
question marks or
[Music]
something so the next one I have not
found yet is after food or
[Music]
fuel and I have no idea how
to F po Fel not
[Music]
so next one
[Music]
is
[Music]
oh you know what this seems to be
uh
this seems to be a place in the first
first area of the game I can visit that
I I didn't even know about cuz the game
didn't really make it
clear or game made it clear I just
didn't go there
yet so how do you turn turning back to
normal colors it's not that I can need
it's
F actually i' probably been here no
wonder cheese is yuy I like cheese look
here it
is I just never went here
look wait is it the always been here you
know what it's might always has been
here it just have been hard to see it as
uh yeah yeah yeah it's always been here
ever since the start of the game I've
just it's supposed to be a go- go car
but I just haven't been able to see it
as a go- go
car I should say it before I use the
items and then can you SLE why can't you
just go through that on foot why do you
have to use the
kill oh
well this is the best oh wait it's a
mini
game H are
you are you are you in
the first be sure to pass the Finish
Line before the time runs out yeah
usually time limit but the finish line
is to this dirt mode cross cor is near
the mermaid singing Rock if you break
the break the past records I'll heard
mermaid will give a
m I do like mermaids mermaid sing pum
pun you dress up as a
[Music]
mermaid well are you ready already hurry
up the time's running wait why have you
started the clock already I'm
not
okay what are the
controls the forward is
accelerate oh is this one of
[Music]
the
how what are the
[Music]
controls I
don't I don't know where the controls
are no one told me what the controls
[Music]
are try again yeah I have no idea what
the controllers
are
[Music]
que I'm on my way to the merid
S oh no my dress St keep slipping
off I can
jump I can move forward and nothing does
anything
[Music]
has
oh can choose
[Music]
path but how do
I
like accelerate how do
I refuel the
[Music]
car
noises yeah how do I like how do I refu
it how do
I so much they don't explain and I'm so
confused at the
[Music]
moment that was
like
okay like
here no I'm went past sign can like feel
C sign or
something jump I oh was there I stand at
the sign and
jump that what I
do to fuel the car or something I don't
know oh now wait now for some reason I
could go oh I no idea how this game
works oh a confusing game now I could
get far but I didn't beat the record I
think the record is first
24 almost 25 seconds second is almost 27
seconds and third is 28
seconds
[Music]
okay I could go yeah I s was something
there I went to the right instead what
do I end up
now oh
wait this
[Music]
doesn't make more where is all my
[Music]
head I'm so confused at the moment
first hyd yes yes oh also sorry so I'll
be off have good stream Kitty thank you
for being
here my confusion with this
game thank you for healing
[Music]
me
okay let's see if I can redo that thing
I'm so confused by
that let's see if I can even R it
know uses up um well I can check if I
still have the
item yes I do have not good try looking
for controls online no
F well apparently it seems has to be
accelerating jump that seems to be the
only thing I can do
so yeah I me to use yeah I can do it
again good good
good since I didn't need to record
record I didn't need to speak to to my
M I just didn't even care about speaking
to M
mate I'm not sure why you land in the
river After exiting that doesn't makes
any
[Music]
sense but yeah
2496 what did I get
Cy okay I can do
this 496 go go go
[Music]
go
[Music]
oops try to
[Music]
jump
[Music]
pinks 26 and
2673
um should that
be yeah where's my record I got 2673 do
I need to speak to mermaid about that
hey mermaid I got record can you please
sign write me on the
list hello mermaid oh there a whole
mermaid this
time well hello there you're pretty fast
congratulations you get the brown
smell I want the BR I want the Bron
clear wait do you
need one more thing since you're the
first one to break a record I have a
special present for you take this my
mind singing
Rock doesn't mean I go need
get oh is that oh that's the gold
well next time aim for Sil medal good
luck that's I want a Sil
medal does the game force you
[Music]
to go
through yay like does have the game set
it up so you kind of forced to get a br
SM the first time around can I use a few
more on this one
[Music]
again no of course
[Music]
command for coming side place in the
rign let's try again and get the silver
this time what happens if you get gold
immediately or
[Music]
something kind of missing out on events
in that
case the murmured singing
Rock okay I can see now
as I confirmed like I can redo the race
I if you can only do it once that would
be
terrible and I
[Music]
can okay let me check
[Music]
that I want a silver metal I want a
bronze
metal honor medals for exceeding the
existing thir win record but I don't
care he
them nor medal for
exceeding the existing
second why exceeding
record I'm not familiar with that
expression might be a common expression
I'm just
not and I got 15 hit points I only must
be one place where I can get another one
yeah if you get gold before silver
bronze those two are
lost oh did you look that
up that would not be
good
well I guess I just need to go a bit
slower than 24 and but it's so hard I it
was so hard I to even
get
cuz I could and yes I like that oh well
I guess I was lucky then then it was
slower than
2496 I did save game
[Music]
[Music]
so
oh yeah
I I
[Music]
assume come on come on come on that must
have been silver I
think it was lower than 24 and stuff at
least so I think it was
26 oh
one yeah that's quicker than second
place but my record aren't showing up I
mean I get more gameplay purposes but it
doesn't make sense in
Universe con for beating a record but I
will recognize that you beat the record
but not going to story well you really
improv not bad at all congratulations
here take the silver
medal I want the silver metal
CLE there you go now I just need to
Gold the next next bra is for the
gold I want a gold Bell wait where is
that going to be placed somewhere
random can I speak to you again no
apparently not it
can the mermaid speaks to you you don't
speak to the
Mermaid I want
AAL I want a gold metal completely
separate from rest marvelous M I seen an
existing Champions
record but as you do
that your record is not going to be
recognized yeah I got to save that to
and now I just need to put my full
efforts into getting
first and that's going to be
hard
the village of all
Beginnings cuz I'm I'm I'm basically
going to try to
100% as in completing all missions not
all items I would not consider getting
all items to count as 100% game because
when you finish the game it tells you
how many missions you have I didn't know
that but how many you found and how many
you completed so it said that I found
all missions and I've completed all
missions I will consider that as 100% in
the game
as I've said only if the game counts and
you doing it that's what I consider 100%
And and what the game counts is is like
it has some counter for it with a
maximum
value not any counter of course within
reasons like there's an AP counter in
this game and it certainly has a maximum
value but that not that's not 100% in
game H and if you still have things to
unlock which I do have in firstes team
racing let's
[Music]
go okay that by Bast
[Music]
[Music]
start
[Music]
no not crashing the
pain assume you should
[Music]
to when re say the buny who got gold
relics and Crush b t yeah that is what
going for PL
H would or even developer records that
would be not within reason cuz gold is
what the game considered completion
unless you refer to Wrath of Cortex that
one does not consider gold to be
required and I and I did it because I
thought it's required
that but it did
not this is going to be hard I feel
like I still have the gold in uh Clash
one and two to in uh the Remake to
do H I didn't do them because they
didn't exist exist in the original game
so I didn't exactly consider doing them
but that still means I haven't 100
presented to those games in the
remake so I will I will do go for those
gold but that would
[Music]
be yeah that would be uh when probably
when I better a computer that doesn't
get the stream to sound so
weird we see
[Music]
how how it it does
tomorrow wonder if the other ways
quickly I try to avoid
it why can't they jump
okay definitely this be
[Music]
enough maybe I should trade the other
the
way but tomorrow which at 19:00 my time
17:00 UTC so take your current offset
and you must take it cuz it that was a
thing
I happened on one stream we were
discussing what the time zone was as
someone checked there and what the time
zone was set on Windows Windows always
tells you what the standard time time
standard upset is does not consider
summer
time
and should go to it just to so when I
check Windows settings for me it says um
uh TMT plus one which is standard
time I think if I check what my offset
is on
Android dat and
time choose time
zone it says that it's GMT plus 2 at the
moment because it does consider it being
summer time now although it's using the
generic term it says just C Central
European Time is being used and then it
says that central
European uh Standard Time starts
on the 29th of
October and that's
uh it should have used this more
specific time and said that it's using
summer time at the moment but well
I not sure why they've done that because
I assume Android is developed
in and United States meaning they are
used to having summer times and stuff
why doesn't the jump
[Music]
work that was not
quicking that was kind of slower this is
going to take a while oh
[Music]
my it would be nice if as soon as you
reach goal it said and and because I
already got silver it said like you did
not uh exceed gold do you want to try
again gra scene is ter used and I still
not gotten confirmation if that's a
common English expression for breaking
records exceeding records or if that's
just a weird translation from because
this is a Japanese
game and in Japanese they might take
exceed records and someone translate
that literally
it does have a Swedish translation so
say see what it says in
[Music]
Swedish it's correct okay thank you for
confirming that I'm your s not used to
it
maybe there's a way to I get a better
start CU currently I just hold
accelerating before they started the
[Music]
race oh I got across
there why doesn't it jump there I press
and jump like multiple times here it
jumps oops I got
[Music]
it I got that one
I did it I did it hydrates thank you
s I did
it no more SSH
though let
see that was the
hydrate whoa let's talk to the
mermaid why is the why is the mermaid
not
included mermaid mermaid I beat the the
record exceeded the record
congratulations you've done it you must
be the world fastest zombie Motocross
Champion
well I
[Music]
mean technically yes if he's the only
Tomi what is a Tomi
motoross well I'm the world's fastest
pon pon Motocross Champion I guess cuz
I'm not sure if any other Pon p has
exceeded the gold in this
game there might be someone on the pon
pon I suppose Tom's development staff
must be ashamed of
themselves
well I saw the goal was to beat that is
that a developer record or something
like this is the fastest we can do in
the game we're going to set that as a
goal for the the players to defeat if
they defeat it they get clear this am if
we can't do do it but we'll see if
anyone else
can oh what I
humbling I have no idea if they decided
to do that but I have beaten some
development records like in Crash 4 so
apparently I think I don't know it's two
or three levels that I am faster faster
that I am faster on than the developers
themselves which is pretty
neat and the best was when I kind of
played one of the levels quite badly and
still beat the developer record and then
I decided that that I can do that so
much better and then did it again and
got an even better time with several
seconds P best F fun I'm not
bragging I'm just curious
like certainly certainly the develop
times should have been mared in that
game seems like they didn't properly
tried CR 4 is kind of a bad game when it
comes to controls I wish they could fix
that anyway and I will play the game
still though I will through the controls
I will deal with the controls anyway
from this day you are the champion I
want to go my C 5,000
points always aim what you're not happy
you're not
[Music]
happy
when I am the best pon pon bon bon even
though one person is tell my name
[Music]
so my singing Rock the mcross go so this
is what you get for beat just reaching
goal this one for getting H beating the
thir it's time second time and then the
first
time so the gold m
wait col
wait
so I should go and talk talk to the old
three
[Music]
now pon p is best and also you kind of
put into the river where the alter is so
is that John Cena in the
Barbie
mie I don't know I hav watched the B
Movie the
mie I don't know hello I got I got the
[Music]
stuff why is it so hard to speak to you
the going of flowers in
water the m famili
for for of the items you need to do
something okay got
them I got the items what do you need
what do you want from
me what do you want from me well in that
case well in that case I guess I just
have to look up I don't know I don't cuz
it doesn't say anything collect the five
I had is that and it was the MC thing
and I got the go I'm so
[Music]
confused
golden let me see
if oh I see I
[Music]
see
it's a 10,000 yellow man who wants them
the he was the one who told me about the
golden ANS not the old tree the old tree
was told me where to get
them
so w this glow Des sign these have to be
five golden items I can't believe you
really found them all right then let's
trade for my psychic fish F
Square psychic fish acquire 10,000 some
points
psychic fish the psychic fish gives you
wonderful powers but one small mistakes
can be deadly listen carefully now us
the fish will make you run faster and
jum higher than ever before wait didn't
I get this fish but if you overuse it
you'll be ding straight down into the
valley when you don't need the power of
the fishion one you must use it again
that will return you to your normal
primitive self in other words use to
fish wisely wasting it special powers
comp I wonder if there are any unusual
Vis we didn't get that
[Music]
already no that's a psychic fish it this
makes you stronger I
[Music]
believe okay you know
[Music]
what let's save and try that and see
what
happens I think yeah yeah yeah one one
thing that couldn't Pro the game and
because why can't you climb on these
things because that's the thing I don't
believe the game
should like require to play it
to is to remember who gave you the
quest oh I guess I'm using Baron
then you
[Music]
seriously
okay then I use this
one which for some reason I can use but
can't use Baron because I was in whated
that's why cuz it it has the whole
animation they should have made okay
another change for the game have an
animation work for when you're in the
water give me five golden items wor
thousands of dollars and I'll give
you5 fish and call it
psychic that's what we're going to see
if if it is psychic we'll see what it
does or maybe I'm been fooled maybe I
made that bad
trade I mean I got the event too so I
had to do the trade
anyway okay what does this psychic fish
do because I got the other fish which
was the scared fish is it P fish
[Music]
p
it's
not okay this is how high
the the psychic fish
does if I switch back to the sac
fish it's kind of say but this one
definitely it has a quick animation I'm
not sure if it runs
quickly so yeah it was a bad tra at
least I got a dant which was the goal of
it and I kind of cleared up my event
list too item list which I guess is nice
too
so so uh two more then which the event
after what the SE forgot I think it
was with a low case t for
them and correct SP Thief I for
[Music]

then this
one I just want to see where the bar
no
[Music]
[Music]
okay I can't actually complete this one
and that's a bit
[Music]
annoying
oh so that's a bit annoying
[Music]
um because uh I've already broken the
barrel not sure why they can't just have
the barrel
[Music]
respawn it is here there is there is a
there's a barrel here which I destroyed
you're supposed to push it down the
water but I destroyed it instead
I just wish the barel could respond can
I use a cheat to make the bar
[Music]
respond are it supposed to push it down
[Music]
here
that can't even complete every
[Music]
Mission well yeah that's fun when games
have missions that you no longer can
complete can
complete so the only thing I can do is
do a
[Music]
compromise oh I'm
okay I can't complete every mission in
game because this final mission is is
I'm not able to complete
[Music]
anymore so the only the
only uh I do have an idea for
compromise and this is the and that's by
doing
is new
game and I will consider the game 100%
after this so what I will
do is a skip
forward to that point which should be
pretty easy because you should be able
to just
run
[Music]
he this slow at the
[Music]
moment oh iance too far to complete the
one no no you can complete it any time
it's just that if you do a certain
action you can no longer complete it
yeah yeah I
need one item
first a it's
locked wait
get is this a see
yeah yes it is I just didn't know that
was a
thing
yeah I need this
one and then I should be able to run
right so what I will do is I will
activate the event not that I have to
activate an event and then I would
pretend that the event is activated and
done on my other yeah yeah yeah yeah
save file and then I will pretend that
I'm completing it and then I will say
that I completed every
Mission I don't have any other way of
this
cuz the game is
evil I get know so few
items no can't skip
this apparently un skipable K things I
could skip the first one but not this
one but hopefully it shouldn't be
anything
else
clear the fog thank
you he's so so
sow oh you
[Music]
can I accidentally did that
again I wonder if that's the thing you
can do
anyway is that far flower again
yep so all I have to do is go to
the old man will tell this long and
boring
[Music]
story here's here's a mission you you
are to stop by
K
8,6 advanture points sop few wait what
no maybe I already spoke to that person
who said that it me still for Advantage
points okay let's keep
[Music]
these inside Co eggs yeah not broken a
single one
what to think of those and little by
those big
vultures and is this his real
voice

fruit was that all the
sticks didn't you read that comment
already is that F flower
again I'm not allowed to it twice what
is
this
rules yes I got them happy now you old
fart
[Music]
flower so now can I go to the weely W
and get that this was once a beautiful
peaceful land until seven evil pigs
that's what it sounds like I can't me
was their powers to change this land
into an ugly world for some reason the
evil pigs seem to be collecting gold I
bet your grandpa's bracelet that was
stolen by the coma pigs was made out of
gold too the seven evil pigs are hiding
somewhere in this world if you find them
I'm sure you'll be able to find your
bracelet as well just remember be very
careful let remember be very
careful ah let's
see walk growing up baby birds yes if
have like some kind of memory thing
Checker have have a check what triggers
the whole barel thing barel barrel and
then how it reset on my other
saine H I just wish the game didn't
force me to do this
but that's a Dragon Ball reference
that's how the dragon comol
this
[Music]
one I don't care about
[Music]
that I don't leave I don't care about
leave
iide only one thing in my
mind
okay so you need

then the next area I should be able to
bite the last one and then I should be
able to speak to the Elder yeah now they
blocked me from leaving I don't really
get
why this
[Music]
more
[Music]
fled okay
so stage War so can I leave now can I go
find them can I go to wobbly Warf which
was my whole goal have playing this now
they block you from leaving because
you've been eating the brains and must
answer to the job for your crimes no no
not letting me
leave if that person could leave and
there there is like a few moments in the
game where you block you from leaving
which I just don't get when you land in
the back Village for example they block
you from leaving what's even more
strange is like they block me from
leaving then then they let me go and
then they blocked me from leaning
[Music]
again
[Music]
no keep
pink don't take
that what
[Music]
chest oh was one day now I can go here

bonus that's same
it automatically places on a second
block that's kind of
neat jump on egg jump on bird jump on
and eat baby bird yes he's stuffed them
in his
mouth his this stomach
storage okay let's SK
this
[Music]
for
TSA
s
[Music]
[Music]
that's
what another can mov
in you could do in every Japanese Quest
I replay this in
Japanese should I replay this in Swedish
learn Swedish with pon pon the bon
bon I do want
to put anyone here and I'm in curious
about learning Swedish or maybe just
learn about Swedish but that
matter uh I do still have the idea
oops that that to play Spy reignited
Trilogy in
Swedish and then H like explaining like
the meaning of words pronunciation of
words and so on
and and help help people understand
switch that's what about what I heard
him say in this SP up
cin play this wi and watch them refer to
the fog as frog
yep a few
errors like
that and and very very first mission and
they don't use the Swedish word for find
they use the English word for
find and that's such
a such an
error the very first Miss the very first
sure it's the very last one you unlock
but it's the very first one in the list
that you unlock IM Meed like you get it
in the list the first thing you do when
you start a game but
you
then complete it at the end of the
game but that that description of the
event is
there uh
throughout uh the whole play through and
they made a typ
point that's ridiculous I
think
yeah uh so where are you so where do you
find the event for the spiky B okay this
time I will save and do it correctly
okay save wobble W save yes this is how
you do
it I should not destroy
it
actually should just just damage
it okay and we have the
dog dogy
dog and it really looks like it's
written in Japanese and a sign but of
course it's not very
readable here it
comes just not there you
go
and then push
[Music]
it where are the
barrels okay
so I've now pushed down the barrel and
got the uh
event uh added to my list of events I
not say the a
[Music]
same
[Music]
yes yay
W so this is what I'm going to do
now so we'll go to event and check out
that
event there it is where the barrels the
barrel sank all the way to the bottom
and how you complete this Quest is by
simp simply load
[Music]
game this block is okay it's feeling
very no this block is not okay because
it's broken cuz I messed up the barrel
and the barrel does not respond which I
think is a if the if the barrel just
responded and if
you could and they could fix some other
events that are uncompletable so much
much quicker enough and only do now is
you swim to the bottom you find the
barrel and the qu and the quest is
unlocked and you complete the quest
that's all you have to do so I want to
consider this event as complete for the
sake of completion for the sake of 100%
I'm not going to play through the whole
game
again just to actually get the list
checked off so eh but I will pretend it
has been completed because I now
actually done the activating I've
actually done the the require the thing
live on stream just that it doesn't want
and I could also complete the quest so H
in the a say fine but that would require
me to learn to swim and I don't learn to
swim until I reached the 10,000 year old
man I
think no no it's I learned no that's
when I learned to dive and I need to
learn to dive first and yeah and that's
so far into the
game
so so let's defeat these um evil pig
again because the evil pig was very
simple to
defeat do it play in Swedish P me to do
it such a confusing it's just that you
can fail the vent never unlock it again
and I really don't like
that and similar as you said about the
bronze and silver you should should
still be able to unlock those and I get
those Events
[Music]
maybe so let's see if I can do
this this is how you defeat this
boss that's is not how he defeat this
boss trust
me there we go that's how this is how
you defeat
us
ta
[Music]
ping really will pink clear 50,000 point
and then there just one more mission
that needs to be
cleared let's get out of here the dog is
inside the let's bring your treasure
with me
it breaks apart do I do I get to clear
numbers before or after the final cut
scene anyway whoever had ads before play
now we get to see it
[Music]
again going to play tomy2 now maybe I
should move it to crash 2 first I never
played tomy2 I played this one I've
never completed it before there so this
is the first time I completed and second
time I completed twice in the
[Music]
stream so let's skip
[Music]
this
goodbye leave the dog
behind they
should so this is the
cred they should have these cutcenes in
engine so you can see Tomi change color
uh in these cut scenes depending on how
you look in the game
anime yes it
is animated in
Japan
cute I think you meant
right C if you
want cute cute it's Japanese now okay
looks similar to Dragon Ball I wonder if
that one is
Animan maybe the same
[Music]
[Applause]
team
[Music]
[Applause]
Quest by whoopy
Camp whoopy
Camp who PE in the
camp what it
do yes there we go man found 130 just
add a plus one to that events cleared
130 I will consider it 130 whatever the
game says so I would say that I have now
100% completed the
game by
SK and that's the and yeah there we
go and I guess you should add how much s
here 500 for trigger and 5,000 for
clearing so add 5,500 to this number as
well if you
want so that's a 2,
370,000 points or
[Music]
so yeah yeah he's a kute
person
so I call out a
success and you and uh and game
over and then you're back to the main
menu you don't even get the option to
save why I have
WPC so I'm done
iate uh what this youed before I don't
but I'll do it hard again
tomai is cute well I guess that would be
translated
to Tom I
said you know
because it's called T in
Swedish that's
from from American English to Swedish
Swedish
neat
I'm glad you find it
neat
sque
sque
like sometimes the sound effect sounds
sound effect sounds too loud but while
the voice is sounds to quiet
so I will consider the game complet I
said so I've been streaming for 2 and a
half hours now it's almost 3 hours I
think that's good enough so for tomorrow
what I want to
do in bunny is to do the special
stream
well I will do something ridiculous as
to play Spyro without looking at the
game doesn't that sound
[Music]
fun and uh that will
be if you're on the server I will post
the time there uh if you if you're not
on the server and Discord server that
would
be socials that if you play Crash
without looking I no I would that
wouldn't
work it's too hard game the and if I
do if you yeah if you if you're on the
Discord server I will post the event I
should post the schedule too which I
forgot to update but new schedule and I
will post probably uh an update in the
general channel channel channel about
the special stream part with crowd
control do nah well it doesn't even I
mean isn't I guess and it just doesn't
sound seem
fun to be honest
um plus the whole uh
but you can adjust the prices so you can
make it so people can control it
easier it's just that I'm so poor so I
can't I don't have any points so
I do
anything no just the things you can do
in the game doesn't seem to
be that that's fun anyway anyway anyway
anyway so if you're not on disc so that
that was the thing I was going to
say you can check the schedule on my
twitch which is just twitch.tv/ Bon b/
schedule or if you're on mobile you can
also access the schedule from there and
that's when it will tell you when it
starts in your time
zone which is the case on this s but it
will be as said 17 UTC
19 Central appear on time whatever it is
in all the time zone I don't know
because I don't know them at top of my
head
so just take whatever Offset you have
take if you have some time into
consideration and add or subtract from
17 and you get your time so since the
stream is
over who should we go and
visit we could go and visit H water
bunny again because he's he's still on
his read the
but no in new Central I could probably
convert
that 17 UTC to
use let's let's do Pacific is there yeah
that's okay so US Canada that would
be
uh
there there you
go
uh um Australia Pacific with that
yeah yeah let's see is it like
West
East what does this go sometime convert
and not
convert is it is it wa is has summertime
started not I don't
know fun I hope I hope it be fun I guess
you read what yeah I did but he still
done his read D butt which is St red
debute even though it really looks like
it's SE read the but and it is a special
event you
know so it could it could still be worse
you
know you
know he's playing armor
core
six
yes Soldier
62
one I me anyone else you want to miss it
otherwise AA has just is starting
up Jazz Cat is playing
music Benny is playing tah Hawk Pro skat
too I don't
know
Benny yeah sure if you I haven't read
Benny in a while so maybe maybe sure we
can go visit
[Music]
Benny like let's a bit a little bit
different RS it be
fun let's visit
Benny Benny
boy doing this what what's the what's
the r message then CH
okay
I know what my R message is going to
be so uh other than that I don't think I
have anything to add so do you if you're
not on my server you can always write to
me H like private message on Discord
that's fine too unless you want rabit I
mean you can do that if you like it it
doesn't really matter which you choose
to use and and anything is
fine it's fun and whichever you choose
to
use
it's it will be
fun it is also fun like some do have R
messages but I don't get I don't really
have too many users active to like send
messages when a raid happens and
probably because I don't really have any
R messages I come up with I'm not that
creative of a person I feel
like but anyway R is going so let's
let's uh
prepare thank you everyone for being
[Music]
here
