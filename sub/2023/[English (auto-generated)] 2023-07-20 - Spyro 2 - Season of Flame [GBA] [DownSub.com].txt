welcome everyone
and don't forget about the first redeem
oh there's no sense on this sound oh
I said first with him not a chicken
yeah but if you always get it's Christ
that means that other people has to
actually show up early to get it and I
already did 22 sentence
hmm
see
and you're giving people like four
minutes already so I think that's plenty
of time
[Music]
but
really nice
from a game it's like a peace love
I'm really not a happy
I'm
[Music]
so wait
why didn't I get everything here
foreign
[Music]
oh yeah it's because of that scene I
can't access
I'm using a gem here I will do something
about that later on
try to let me know
[Music]
okay I think one drop one
one of the worst thing about
she's not playing is it harder to know
amazing
which two before I was seeing the
original Spider games but I did solve
that in seasonalize
they kind of made the game Boys in in
that sense otherwise the game is much
better
than the country farms have done
then there's this menu which is
beautiful
and it doesn't show the code that's
which I'm very happy with
so there are three six seven eight
portals
[Music]
and there are one two three four five
I've done
[Music]
one
wow that's so hot
baby
[Applause]
Tropics have done
Let's Go sir and report on them
okay so I'll take that back because the
game doesn't have a map that shows all
the
and all the portals so let me find it
so
Temple of a tune did I do that
[Music]
I wish it could show something like
yes I did
so the next one is down there there
should be no problem
[Applause]
no it's not something
oh I find
a dope or something
you're gonna work spiral you've opened
this portal as well these rights again

are fine

become
as a size scrolling shooting

yeah I probably get up there
after I get all the way to the right
first

[Music]
[Music]
Ah that's the jump is going to be tricky
[Music]

specific about where you can stand and
you can
you're not going to do anything about
someone standing softer

[Music]
yeah all right yes I want to do right as
far as area down from start this one and
that's probably like how I get to this
blue and yellow platforms because
it's too tall to get from here at least
that's kind of helpful seeing with the
map
kind of hard to tell you
[Music]
yep definitely so
at least I tried
[Music]
but it's 67.99 checkpoints I'm down here
again well
let's see so I am can ignoring the
messages
[Music]
[Music]
I wonder if this is
that's right I'm excited that she chart
that's why it sounds like it was
incredible yeah and I need to listen to
that but I don't know what music app
sound like walking around so
well you can determine if that sounds
like music have you walking around
but I went for a Sim swim and I had so
much fun I forgot he needed the surface
to do surface [ __ ] hey
[Music]
that sounds about right that sounds
about to be intelligent that makes for
you
thank you
there we go
[Music]
see my net my way up there
I know
I'm supposed to walk up this way but
[Music]
why would I when I don't need to right

the soldiers thanks for helping out
again spiral you're a really great
friend all your friends now he's a glow
worm I found struggling in the water
whoops it got away
[Music]
you capture this morning
looks like this level is complete
there was no joke to that the level is
just complete
this game you usually have the end
portal at the starter level so let's
return home water at start level which
makes the most sense
[Music]
because so important to get it on the
one
and
honestly
considering Inspire 3 how many often
get a pass from the
end of the level to the startup level
they really should have made
made that
[Music]
it's amazing you have you have the exit
port at the starter level because that's
important you go back and forth through
and then when you reach the end of the
level the path to the startup level
opens up the person you talk to goes to
the exit portal and there you go
now the level makes sense
[Music]
oh so much celebration
the vibration
when to next
I should try to do them one day
Mr Sheena 11.
despite the unending inside from this
little lady every coming little I'll be
more than happy to step aside
for the
trifling sum of 700 gems
I'm not sure if I have that much oh I
got two seven five nights wait but why
do I missing four

level but why is why am I missing four
more

about
a dog in a dog in Japanese City Hey kid

bunny City it is
when it's explode
I never heard of such an expression no I
didn't expect it to be an expression I

smiling in her desk

she doesn't have much of an expression
before she dies

to make that at 25 why couldn't they
just keep them in their shape and if
they really wanted to they could make it
a new value like 50 or something
it could be neat
[Music]
but because the actual value of a jam
doesn't really matter
yeah because if you're going for 100 you
just need one of the gems anyway
foreign
is one valued gem
is worth just as much as uh 25
a value of 25.
there you go I did it
I did it I did it
fraction new word
[Music]
well let's do the upper levels then
thank you
oh another scene 11. lunar Legends
YouTube wouldn't want to leave me with
nothing would you I didn't even know
what voices you see different money bags
will see you soon is very important here
and ahead with that avoid it in the next
line pay 1 000 gems to enter yes but no
that's the spirit there is nothing like
a few times to brighten up a day is
there
[Music]
okay I can't wait to get my hands on
those gems
the gems of Luna edges or the gem stats
Moneybags have wait how did I get them
oh wait no I didn't get the gems back
from money bags in seasonal ice because
I never defeated the final boss
[Music]
let's see where are we did you pick up a
distressing or something
hierarchy those stirrers have covered
the landing pads with rocks
if we don't clear them off soon any
Landing Rockets could meet with disaster
I jump out the chance to teach those
rhinoxidants and oh Sparks
even jumping
and only when you speak to Sheila is an
insult
thank you
but what's what's the point of the green
cheese that is stabbed
is that an expression stamped green
jeans
I'm making up Expressions here okay
[Music]
it's like stamped green cheese
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
yeah I'm going for 100
I mean
is that an achievement
me
[Music]
I set the point of achievements in the
sense of
oh what kind of move was that
must have like a challenge that wouldn't
suit normal completion
[Music]
Oh Sheila
it is a common miss about the Moon being
made of cheese yeah I've heard that one
but
[Music]
I was standing on the way if I'm down
here
all the way down on the
but my specifically green cheese on a
stick
that's the part I'm curious about
[Music]
foreign
sheets have spikes in them
[Music]
[Music]
and the cheese got moldy and it was
placed there by a reliable that it made
me
now as it is like
please give everywhere
[Music]
it's not is it like hugees and I'm sure
I'm happy with that and I forgot about
that channel
[Music]
I had to kill anybody
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
yes
I will squish the bunnies
okay do you want me to answer this
question again I'll see if I can do that
with the next bunny if I remember
you try to squish this at me yeah you
can squish
the next animations
[Music]
[Music]
at least everything is staying dead it's
not good
the point bunnies but they are pink
bunnies
it's okay to kill kill pink onions
squeeze
[Music]
okay I definitely have to try to squish
okay
[Music]
if there's any more bunnies can you see
how it could just be some one down here
yeah
[Music]
no it just explodes sadly exploding
funnies no squished bunny sadly
[Music]
see if you can get him to blow himself
up wait what is being mean solution
[Music]
all right
important
to get into blowing and stuff up anyway
I can think of is trying to kick on it
had an area
why can't it behind a checkpoint in this
level
now I have to walk all the way back
oh this is this game sometimes is
annoying
50s
[Music]
all the way back
[Music]
okay
now
[Music]
I just avoid it foreign
[Music]
okay that wasn't too hard I guess
I don't know another one
[Music]
and then when it uses his helmet
I wasn't quick enough I didn't get to
the first jump working
and then I had to walk all the way back
[Music]
he's not squashing enemies with her butt
I think she's doing it with the legs
no she's actually doing it with her but
okay
that's just some rump squats squishing
the last thing yeah
enemy guest experience is her big butt
I wouldn't see something with her legs
whoever animated scene I wanted her to
do it with her butt
[Music]
[Music]
you can give me one tonight
this is a tough challenge good luck and
then I sort of find more at you
[Music]
and it wasn't too tough I guess
[Music]
I love pink bunnies I mean yeah I do too
but the pink one is inspired is fun to
kill
such wild noise
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
that's
that's not what I was supposed to drink
anyway because it's the same message
every time
[Music]
Elizabeth said something funny each time
that would be fun yeah
big butt not necessarily the worst thing
yeah she has quite a big round but
I bet a lot of people that really want
to get Gina to
rump stumps them
Candy Lane let's go
oh
[Music]
Spyro we got to keep your voices down or
does he relax will get me for sure
we try to jump them out of here but
the Cabbage doesn't
hide everyone up oh my
I'm the only one who got away you've got
to help us whoops
I got to be quieter
[Music]
okay be even quieter
oh no they're taking me
you're funny
you want to say something funny
okay
[Music]
a cake
do you want a cupcake
oh I'm supposed to blow out candles
I see
lips expired round
indeed liquid oh no why does this reset
[Music]
this one does not
spider
Flying Kangaroo yeah uh
not that we met by your decision I'm not
flying
[Music]
[Applause]
candidate
and honestly it's much easier to keep
track of where everything is in this
game after having the map screen to look
at the map helps a lot and apparently
there is a version of the Spyro season
of ice as in the Japanese version which
I think I mentioned where the these
updates actually comes from because they
kind of
fixed this stuff or something for that
version of course the problem with that
version is it's in Japanese and it's a
bit tricky to play if you don't speak
Japanese so
stop doing that
[Music]
not funny
thank you
[Music]
I really enjoyed the voice thing now I'm
happy
[Music]
and I hope it gets better at it
oh Spyro drumming in the corner
[Music]
apparently
[Music]
look at this bunny
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I didn't take damage walking into the
enemy that's not the scene in spy games
and you're free to touch enemies how do
you want to put your
[Music]
hands all over there
[Music]
anyway
so this is the top of the world
[Music]
oh
yeah
Captain star
[Music]
it was supposed to be Starlight
and now it's a sunset
[Music]
I think there was glimmie already
so there's been Twilight and Sparkle
there's been
a
[Music]
this big star by the time of the
Starlight just being glimmer and
I don't think there's been I like this
sunshine or Shimmer
and if anyone gets that reference I'll
be I mean at least the first one she
goes
[Music]
rounding really won't get chocolate
factory chocolate yeah basically what it
is
yeah American chocolate was this thing I
was going for I think I filmed saying
you kept it Cal
M what's that stand for
yeah
what kind of heat needs related stuff is
that
careless in calories because calories is
a certain amount of energy and energy is
warm
[Music]
okay
can I feed that one out
I hope
[Music]
but how many count
Ries
[Music]
I got to be proud of
when I think I've seen myself
okay
oh that can be a bit silly
or a key
I'm not sure if you should be happy
about it
[Music]
all right this is the startup level
[Music]
so I need to figure out how to get it
into the middle section then
[Music]
it is
[Music]
yeah I see I see I just have to look
around and I can't get a shortcut to
something no you're not going to be
generous like that
no okay
okay game
I just want this mini silicon shortcuts
[Music]
I want a short cat okay
nothing one of those tall kids
[Music]
yeah yeah it has been having I said I
still think I know why but it is
[Music]
take one please
yeah yeah
[Music]
nice
okay
[Music]
and then I'll go around here
now
go down to this corner down here
[Music]
and then I fly on here and I hopefully
don't get hurt and be knocked down into
the chocolate
the spider doesn't become a chocolate
covered dragon
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
well
I guess it's only sunshine and star
light left and that was actually that
was actually funny
don't you see me
I have no idea if this is a Starlight or
keep forgetting what the other one is
Sun sunshine
because I don't know what are the ones
are called in this game
because this is very first time ever I'm
playing this you capture Aurora
I already started related to fire or
heat
yes yes it is because that is caused by
the Sun
and sun is a very hot scene
um I got it
I think that's the last and I mean last
after so I'm supposed to see right let's
go find bird
probably change your voice every time
before I do I use the key for him
hello dreamy merchantashi welcome
[Music]
I'm happy to see you here
messing around here in
[Music]
season of flame
yeah
why isn't there a season of Amber
Amber scale is a better character of The
Flame and Embry
I thought I hadn't even seen like
I guess to put all right this is the
next important this is a bonus area
[Music]
hmm
yeah I've been waking up early Clinic
could catch your stream I'm I'm happy
with it I am and I'm happy that you're
waking up earlier as well
at least I feel better when I get up
early
[Music]
yesterday's
[Music]
hi spider I'm trying to put together a
big bicycle cake for birth with these
darn rights he'd eaten it before I'm
done
can you keep them at Bay and long enough
for me to finish
[Music]
and I'll protect the cake yeah sure
oh I see I see
well well well well
they've done it again congrats they're
going to get this cake at this rate the
stand rhinox are ruining everything
still got a few ingredients left if you
want to give it another try
oh this isn't DC
hey stop doing that
[Music]
look oh I
my
this is not easy
where's the house I'm keeping it damage
like you said to leave and come back
then
[Music]
yeah there we go
well let's fall down
inside this we can get so crazy
I haven't seen anything yet and
um
everything so far has been easy this one
is a bit tricky
because the cake itself is in the way
[Music]
foreign
I got hit twice oh my
like activity is Flaming and let him
drop the cake but I guess that's not
that I hope
[Music]
it's still not see him oh
I love the way of doing it
and Sparks is all confused
wait where did I end up now I couldn't
get a checkpoint for entering the area
or something
and that would be too generous but it
[Music]
is I got full health now
bunnies yes once they get the cake
they'll be coming with what is like an
alcoholic
oh yeah
[Music]
all right stop getting hit by him
oh my
[Music]
God it is such a hard one
you shouldn't even be a hard one
[Music]
okay
he has to take already why does it have
to be so big
price
come on this is overkill
ah it's working oh
[Music]
my
way to be cake
I must be so very good cake
oh that's
that's that time
yeah
not so
why would they stop trying to take care
since the cake is as soon as it's done
and
I don't know
Kim is made
oh you've finished the cake I guess we
can't steal it anymore
oh I didn't see that one
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
who knows
oh yeah
what what do I call you dreamy
damn
it's been sad
fully understandable that uh
that you didn't
complete uh seasonalize
and did you do the Space Age spinway
[Music]
stop that that one
is this the single one left for me at
least but
oh the space hits
and then I can get to the bus
oh my I'm dying the bonus area
[Music]
giving a game over in a bonus area
I think this is going to be the rest of
the Stream
[Music]
the hardest message Speedway
I hope not
yeah I hope not it's
the biggest problem with this level is
like the gaming here to that one I
basically have to work around almost
this whole level
I don't get why this game is resetting
some things
[Music]
that's what noise damage my checkpoint
thank you
[Music]
and this level doesn't even have a place
where I can Farm food or anything
like extra life
but they are confirmed that I get the
checkpoint again
[Music]
um I was looking at my achievements but
I did not put Xbox even so they sent me
a richer retro achievements inspired
eyes and everything is installing cake
again yep
inspires daddy cannot protect me in my
cake stupid spinal
I think that's uh after wearing my cash
flow at the moment back to it if I had
started basically like hotel somewhere
yeah
so I I don't remember if I how much I
did mentioned when I did get stuck at
that level and if you had played it so I
did play
try to find that part in your stream
which is also why I did shouting out
because I said I was I feel sorry today
[Music]
just take a quick look at your stream
and
and I couldn't find it and then I
noticed that you said that at the end of
the last
um
season of ice cream that you had played
it over before and
yeah we're giving up on it which is
fully understandable
and four times
that's yeah
[Music]
the only game I restarted
which are my Dimension is the first
Legend of spire because I got stuck in
the one wanted to reload the sale and
steep it enough because I'm stupid I did
save up it and I have not done that
since
so six hours of gameplay I had to redo
it but I deleted it in three hours so
for like two hours
[Music]
can you like find a different place to
really cake or something
[Music]
but that was close but again as soon as
the cake is done
what are you stopping them from still
standing
I'm really curious about what happened
after the cake is done what's the excuse
for stainless they need
what I'm doing is just going to oh my
but it's not dying but
[Music]
Achievements not what it looks awesome
and so yeah I know it is achievements
for this game I can't bother doing them
I'll just do the normal getting
everything in the game that comes
towards province
first like the game bounces percentage
increases
I know at least it's a good King
[Music]
I have more fun with this game
the legend of spiral ever gaming
sink hey can you put down the
blanket what happens if I just let them
steal nothing
that would be kind of funny
honest thing there was to the cake then
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
well
okay I can't claim to do the cake so
there's bad
okay this is it this is kinda easy
okay can you stop pushing me around
if you're asking for a guard don't push
the guard away
[Music]
Fred's going to have the best party ever
and I forgot which voice I used to sleep
characters thanks for taking care of
this giant spider without you you've
never could have said as soon as you
finish the Iran is this walk away
yeah it has a magical coal that keeps
flying out of my oven
yeah the Rhinos just left
oh no the cake is done I guess we can't
see this anymore that's that's basically
what it is
what a stupid game
you don't even have the leftness
[Music]
I need to uh I didn't notice that
I need to rescue all of them I didn't
need to go to talk to the first time
again
[Music]
no I started spray dragon is probably
yeah there's the first one to put on my
favorite spiral
man this game is busy yes probably it's
not better than the original trilogy
[Music]
but yeah
so I need to rescue this again
where am I going
I don't know where I'm going
[Music]
all right now you keep being rescued
what
[Music]
I don't have the eyes ability
we're going to capture the Firefly right
now here's the key and it was something
well this something is the
of course the
chest
but I don't know which chest is
yeah I'm letting the fire on the camera
right in this candle on fire
yeah English is not my first language
[Music]
word free so I don't know what's
happened
so I love this
this week then
I think they did get you everything you
can never designed compared to season
advice
I don't even remember the museum since
novice I guess that kind of pretty much
the point
[Music]
to be honest I don't remember if missing
in season of playing My Island
[Music]
I guess music has a hard time getting
stuck in my hands I like for me to
remember
the music more like
oh my
Angeline yeah
that's this lemon
so two more why does it say my promise
now
which which I've rescued when I didn't
do that before
game is inconsistent
podcast
but
[Music]
it's fun to kill it's fun leban is in
like Inspire I don't know
[Music]
the music being very repetitive and
basic
I think if I remember correctly some
some people said that they did like some
of the music and thing
and if that was us
it meant as a joke or not I don't know I
think it's what Janine
[Music]
of course some
oh there's something up there right is
this the last one
ah so I need to go up here
go up here
just
yes yeah yeah I need to find Birds
let's go find Birds
[Music]
I think I think being getting fat is not
the concern here to be honest
[Music]
considering he's drowning
no this is one of the ones saying
[Music]
everyone
[Music]
here's a special and they are fun for
you watch out it's still hot well wait
[Music]
oh whoops
there we go that's my voice acting
so there's all of you
Flash oh if yeah there's this another
one of the case called Flash
so we have Twilight Sparkle
we got
not style I put glimmer and we got not
Suns that but Shimmer and both Twilight
and Shimmer was in this lemon
we'll see how that goes
but I said I don't know if those are the
character does exist but I think it's
like sunshine should be a firefly
because it's like it's Sun
[Music]
um
yeah I hope so I'm probably gonna get
creams if I listen back to it
but again
I find the key
is something
and the key was down
[Music]
nothing
down here I see yes
no there we go that's how I double jump
oh I see I'm a bit blind I see where I
need to go
[Music]
I'm missing everyone
oh
[Music]
how could this happen to me I don't
remember how this song went
tiny shiny sparkly here and that's
probably
[Music]
you know what
I'm going to ignore that one gem
just like in the odd 11. another
otherwise what's up with this game but I
keep missing a single gem in Muslims now
Rumble jungle
trespass here is it's 1994.
but now wait there was no age in nine
out of 10 11.
what is this
I've been knighting
[Music]
it's 1998.
99 2000
2010
looks like years oh yeah I didn't get
gems for enemies
maybe I don't
and I'm your 2020
oh here we go
21 22
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
nice
[Music]
[Music]
oh no agent nine he was standing outside
oh I'm blind
[Music]
I didn't even not seem he's so
[Music]
unnoticeable
I guess
he's not not worth noticing
[Music]
oh my checkpoint
[Music]
so ancient 9 has checkpoints from orange
face buy against checkpoints will be in
place
I cannot really miss this it's just a
bit of a Down
[Music]
that is the correct response she's like
seven
[Music]
now at night 89
do you think
it's fine as a character I guess
it's just a bit too simply I think
that's amazing that's my issue with the
whole game boy
ology of spider games
this is much more Spy Games than a
geology but yeah I'm really counting the
other games so it's a continuation of
the story or something I don't know why
not play this I will see if they are
a queen's theology or something
[Music]
huh
all right
nothing exciting down here
it's the future I can see the future
oh yeah
[Music]
there we go all right excuse me I saw to
die
okay those are quite annoying
excuse me that you're a cleaning person
go and clean up please excuse me is that
even showing up on stream yeah it does
show up
it's
[Music]
yeah that character had a bit about you
see there
wow goodbye
[Music]
um who was was that creating I don't
know yes
[Music]
let's not ask that question
[Music]
[Music]
I'm just done inside something you don't
get I walked off the platform before I
jumped
[Music]
is she
my favorite in that case
I guess it's not too bad then
it's 25 nice
[Music]
kick back to the normal level now this
must have up there
[Music]
oh this is is this stuff
[Music]
about finding the way around
[Music]
I got a lot of it I am on now
[Music]
come on jump up to that platform
I don't know where I'm supposed to oh
the gym I think I'm supposed to go this
way
I think he was having a type you can see
my entire life has been one midnight
prizes
[Music]
I have a live crisis of my own
[Music]
but I'm going but I'm trying to
reduce any
pricelessness meat
swimming
[Music]
can I say which which enemies are dead
and so on
[Music]
okay I'm trying to
[Music]
that they are used up
[Music]
okay so that's a continuation of the
levels
was something more over here
I already been here I think I've already
been here
yeah definitely I made a little face
there
another level you kind of have to do it
[Music]
that she managed to track your location
and everything in the game
[Music]
thank you for detecting
[Music]
I want to take points
[Music]
oh
I didn't get something
[Music]
that something is more gems
okay let's
continue collecting this gemstone
[Music]
I thought that was going to connect my
gym
apparently not
what's these stamps I've been down here
[Music]
we are here on James I was looking for
good
[Music]
okay
[Music]
sorry about that
[Music]
and then you start attacking Invaders
I guess you kind of have to expect to
die
drag grenade onto my head
big damage because if your name is heavy
oh no wait don't hide behind the box
that's cheating
[Music]
okay how many how much how much DMC is
there left oh 85
man
okay
I walked into a grenade
dumping throwing a grenade
okay
[Music]
hiding gems behind the waterfall that's
kind of even
I want to get through this door and get
somewhere but
[Music]
okay
it's something to do with this
platforming I think
[Music]
okay now now it doesn't
see yourself that's 35
that's like a 25 and two fives or
something
[Music]
and that's my guess for what it is I
think
oh my
[Music]
another checkpoint
[Music]
welcome back
[Music]
so now I got the checkpoint
[Music]
okay
[Music]
wait I saw someone today
you didn't die by the big snowball Rocky
thing
[Music]
I see because of the fence apparently
I can jump let's do a lot of things but
not a fence
[Music]
oh yo yo what's popping
I'm back with it what did that means you
didn't miss anything
[Music]
I mean you did me stuff but
it's worth so little so you didn't miss
anything
there's nothing to miss you can see that
there's a bit of electric texture up
there I guess that's
that's a nice thing
I think the only place I think there was
a place
I did see
[Music]
zombies
there's no time for you to be here
specific time just now
[Music]
now scheduled for you to keep our wings
[Music]
but I'm still going to punish you for
being late
[Music]
so it's probably
[Music]
I don't know it's 19911.
not trying
[Music]
and where's the punishment I was 20
minutes late what's the punishment
20 minutes fine two and a half hours no
that's not fine I can't do anything with
this signs then
I don't excuse me
[Music]
checkpoint thank you
maybe then we are responding
what's your price
is going to be a problem
[Music]
in my opinion 20 minutes is worse than
two hours why
[Music]
imagine if you don't join with a plane
it's 20 minutes late compared to two
hours need
[Music]
and because if you chill out late you
have to visit 20 minutes with no reason
look it's not like Vincent
I was like three minutes late myself
today because I had a reason
[Music]
I don't want to judge people for being
nice
they might just not have wanted coming
in the first place and that's perfectly
painting
because
my streaming isn't that important
[Music]
I'm just a silly bunny
[Music]
I don't know why but
let's try to make myself feel better my
own reason is working with that
that's a pancakes kiss
and
about going for night a nice
nice work
that makes me feel better
[Music]
now I have to start
[Music]
uh when I went separate the dead bird
which is why I was late need of a good
reason the shovel I was using a plant
that had an infant living inside the
handle
it's just pain it's not a Sherman
[Music]
I mean honestly actually used a shovel
but that seems like a way inconvenience
50.
yeah
I got Caroline I hope you have a good
rest of his team goodbye kitten have a
nice
something
this one over my hand and beat me oh
that doesn't sign me
too long simply oh I mean it's a
sharpshooter type of Spades or what
doesn't it count as a spit to me it
would still count as a spade but more of
a specific one
[Music]
and I see me and does this painting
I think you should do this level without
dying and you think so
thanks for the tip
oh and I'll try him
I was diving
[Music]
I went out
[Music]
oh almost I think
[Music]
I mean
[Music]
I don't know where
excuse me
you
[Music]
[Music]
who is throwing these things
hey why is this spot Jam located button
why still not wasting on map for me to
look at
[Music]
what is this game
like this
[Music]
oh oh oh thank you
[Music]
it's 400 out of 400 where was it I'm
just going to take
all right I was just supposed to go
again okay
haven't been here okay exit level
accidentally found the remaining ones
