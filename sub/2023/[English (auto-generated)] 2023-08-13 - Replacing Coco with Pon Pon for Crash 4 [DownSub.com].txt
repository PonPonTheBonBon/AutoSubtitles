okay
oh I was just scared buddy
I can't miss against it was playing the
end of the song
hey I think greens is here
and I have pink message
[Music]
yes did you know if you use the
highlight message your message will be
highlighted in the color of the username
isn't that a neat feature
that one
it just
pilot super message in purple
uh
apparently this should be uh
oh yeah
[Music]
there is there is a function where you
can mark it like this
but apparently that's Japanese
I guess it counts as a different type of
message
[Music]
like that
foreign
model
[Music]
I last time I did the bow
should I
well if you say so perfect
I mean
[Music]
your message is simply
[Music]
my message is everybody default already
by color
[Music]
it will
but I can of course also do the redeem
and then it is my pink color which is
more far
pink I guess it's not a huge difference
from the default twitch pink and I was
thinking
maybe I should
I don't know I started finding good
pinkiness
but what I do want is probably
some bones or something here
I'm thinking
so I'm starting I'll probably start with
working a bit on the
so first off I should bring up my
preview
even though I forget about checking the
previews so
I don't see
so I can't say the preview to always
about but I come Theory to anything else
no way out of that
by the way I can go back here
wasn't the view in this this board
that's probably different the machine
blender is slightly more seamed in I
remember the top and bottom bars
jackets pictures slightly largely
it's not a huge difference
[Music]
so
nice here
everyone wants some kind of
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
does phones look like
trying to take inspiration for like
[Music]
from like a
[Music]
like
an internet search
you know there was not many reasons
[Music]
[Music]
I guess I'll just give it something
but
yeah I was hoping that I could get
something that I could use
oh and
and it's fine
do something
[Music]
and then like
the hair turns out I guess
[Music]
so I create this shape
with a general idea of the folding
[Music]
that I've learned
[Music]
because I can adjust the level of the
learning spot right
[Music]
I think that's good
and this is my height map
[Music]
I'm working with lots of tight Maps
that's how you generate
normal Maps quite easily
do I remember that my face I'm almost
smart hyphen page.net smart normal
that's the name of the website
I remember smart hyphen and I was on
whatever it is
team
let me find it
[Music]
and I got a message
yes yes
until you get a alert for when I get
messages I don't get a large for redeems
[Music]
because
[Music]
that's your start with the with it which
works
like
they will be different when I
get a
mix it up running
foreign
but it's not a rabbit
so back here and now
another name
if I
just get a good look here
all right
I forgot to insert I think
like that
and
sport again
and I tried it
[Music]
it's worth it
and then refresh there we go
well
I guess it's not whatever exactly form
but something
it's making sure it's
gonna have a hype for the bunny I wish I
had some sugar here maybe that's the
kissing I don't have actually that's a
lot of sugar
too bad
she's just been spelled me nice
[Music]
but it's Flawless without you it's like
sure it's also forever than you and also
we're like
[Music]
trooper and
Supreme
[Music]
yeah took care in Polish
when
I'm up today saying good night dreams
thank you for showing up
and I hope you sleep well
yes it's better from French and yeah
like I could see that
like food stuff and uh bars from other
languages depending on
because there's a lot of food stuff that
is native
Tango
welcome
you have a good stay
and a good time
and
[Music]
other good stuff
basically I hope you're having good
uh
no it's like a TV
[Music]
picture of
foreign
[Music]
I guess that's
that's life
sometimes you won't [ __ ]
popcorn we don't have any
[Music]
I don't know
[Music]
I have a silly idea and I don't know if
it's a cute idea
foreign
that's how she claims it
you don't want it if she's been licking
it
on ponies are clever punish
laughs
everything
doesn't exactly what they're looking for
that's more
foreign
map and see how well this goes
this girl
saving on the window
this time I'll press invert green keeps
getting ready
it would be nice if it could remember
it starts asking for too much
press it in here
excessive
I mean turning it overlap
and Export normal map
so it's going to blending
and update
one
well I guess
[Music]
okay since that's too bad
oh my God
I'm shortening piece
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
first
and now this one
now
[Music]
[Music]
I'm just messing around
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
maybe not essentially nothing left case
[Music]
acceptably a child should not be
American
well everything prepared
anyway
a case
[Music]
I guess so
[Music]
I can't just reduce the effect of this
so like
it's not terrible but
so on the back side now you have the
reverse
one
[Music]
I guess I can't just reduce the effect
of it not like famous
[Music]
so there's some hints of stuff
pause
[Music]
which looks 3D but it's
a tomato
I'm I am making a bonbon a pumpkin
in 3D
and I'm going to add a dress
myself
[Music]
[Music]
so it's not going to be
and I think someone asked me if I'm
going to use it more
my on-screen model but
I'm basically using the
oh come on
it's not the complete original one
little seven has really been able to use
it that's my own
it's very cute thank you
I've put a lot of many many hours into
this
so I really hope it
it works out in the end
kind of watching crash four players
yeah
I'm going to play through the whole
crash for you
and I'm probably going to you for game
go for a 100 100
I've seen everything in the game
regardless what percentage the game
calls it and because
really getting this
my time Wars
after spending this time
so we can get so much as so much time as
possible
[Music]
sorry
do you want something here but um
I want to do the drawing but that's
going to like a whole stream apparently
for some reason
I don't know why it would do that but
apparently it does so it's here
most of us um
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
I'm trying to find some
like let me just
hello
where did you come from
[Music]
um
[Music]
I want to see like
[Music]
actually I think I I think I know how I
want to do this
[Music]
yeah
that was like
I told told you about that yesterday
that
something is missing women Chipmunks
and has been gone for quite a while I
think it was when you left the first
time I removed
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
I need to open the
[Music]
and then see texture
[Music]
thank you
oh yeah
so this is our 2018
[Music]
hmm I have an idea
and I'll see if I can make it work
[Music]
if I'm slow if sketches
[Music]
you can go back and check the whole
thing is give it some reviews
I don't think that's including my
popularity or anything
[Music]
but yeah SketchUp has been gone for
quite a while
[Music]
I think I want to do
is take a brush that has some softness
to it
and then
I'm going to take a look at the real
life spell
[Music]
I really wish because I quality
remember it
[Music]
thank you
well I guess it's not available
[Music]
it's like
[Music]
one moment granted
[Music]
and there we go
in sporty
where Sports went and take half the
moment on top as a bonus
yeah
I'll take these moments and for myself
[Music]
and no one else can have them
[Music]
oh I'm thinking
I basically need to do like
laughs
[Music]
it's going to be so weird but
[Music]
kind of moment says you need we got
plenty
I'm going to
[Music]
yeah there's the Swedish expression
which is a
like take as much
until you feel shame
[Music]
obviously my cute responsibilities that
I don't feel ashamed
so I'm going to take everything
[Music]
[Music]
even though if you know me you know that
I can't do future
it's not even English I can do feel
shame
and I made a bunch of them last night
they need to get rid of them because I
have nowhere to put them yeah all these
moments have taken up so much space
we feel ashamed I have no shame exactly
[Music]
there are there are a few strange
Swedish Expressions I guess that's not
the strangest one that's like yeah go
ahead I don't care it's basically
foreign
opponents
which I've probably mentioned before
and you give them
as much as they can handle
and that's a bit of a weird expression
because when you give them
more than that they can handle not
really sure that expression came to P
because it doesn't make sense
so I want to create an adjustment layer
here how do I
and I want to add a filter on it
I'm gonna play directly to it but that's
not what I want
wait maybe I can apply it in the
no I can't apply it to a group
wouldn't that be convenient
um let me
[Music]
or maybe maybe here
new
[Music]
oh there we go no that's not my name
before
uh
what I want an adjustment layer
which I can apply
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you
I mean it's not exactly what I'm looking
for a bit
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
so I got something here but yeah
it happens if I
just generates
uh
thing from this
what's the worst thing that could happen
[Music]
does not look what I'm looking for
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
but maybe it works anyway
it's worth a test
so thank you
refreshing this thing yeah definitely
[Music]
that is unfortunately from here
I guess you could see kind of what I'm
going for but it's definitely not
looking like
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
maybe I should just do it in 3D and
generate
[Music]
my my desk classic solution here
[Music]
[Music]
we go
okay
we need a hello what coming I hope you
have a good time
[Music]
when I worked on uh is it good afternoon
um
a mechanism is like
[Music]
me
he got the right person or bunny
but maybe I can't do this
[Music]
now I finished oh he's probably gonna
hang a bunch to you anyways
empty is going to be at the same things
it might be annoyed
foreign
[Music]
foreign
so I can't do that how do I
oh that's enough
but I wanted mirror yes like this
yeah what the buttons here
thank you
Tommy's problem is I'm trying to draw
this with a mouse and
[Music]
so I should probably just give up on
this I need to sleep in any
yeah this thing isn't going to work
the
the best
you can do is like
making it really blurry
foreign
it's something
really good from here I know like
looking good it was terrible
but um I could increase the strength of
it
I can do that by introducing
lemons
and then
you can only affect this one
that's why it's stronger
and
some strong spaghetti
now when I update it in
yeah I see I mean this this side is
banging on the other thing
it's like this I hint of it
I'm happy with that
so should we start with the funny things
I spent like 40 minutes on the bow
shall we start with the
underway
I know
one one is leaking spaghetti
or spaghetti comes flying out of the eye
[Music]
yes that's not creepy
[Music]
so
I'll
can't take caucus on the rest of my
friends
but of course pompous animal looks a bit
different
let's call this
small
girl
underwear like this
I should write this opinion because I
think that's good
it's actually gonna fetch me
like that thing yeah that is coming
oh
oh that I see I guess
making a Big Lick
and and let's do with the reaction but
now it's gone
so yeah I'm going to start with the
underwear because
uh underwear looks a bit different
because it will be the base for
basically almost every outfit like with
the dress and skirt and such she would
have an underwear if you were to I guess
look out
and
I'm not looking to have any black woman
or anything
I guess I don't need the backups Because
I'm Happy dancing with ICA
those parts no need for that
oh device not sure
[Music]
bleeding down
[Music]
anything these as well
making the five size smaller looking up
I mean it will happen because it's a 3D
game
and therefore there must be something
underneath now why not just put pumpkins
anyway
and the underwear will also be part of
the
the execution mesh
because well that's our division local
models it's a skeleton and anyway
I always want to do that
SME referred to looking upon's dress
oh you naughty
you're going to have fun with this
modernity
trying to find every angle to look up
edges
well same that in like Minecraft when
you don't have like dresses as a
thing on the model isn't it
anyway moving on
[Music]
now he's got this anyway it's completely
inside cheers
she has a big butt apparently
well
I guess
I guess I could use copy this and
use as a basis
foreign
[Music]
that should be everything
is that twist short like this is kind of
like a
white shirt straight
he's almost everyone is perfectly he's
like done okay
there's going to be a separate English
so
let's call this important shorts then
he's happy
[Music]
I mean you're you're the ones in charge
I believe is about
[Music]
is this a good shape
[Music]
one
[Music]
foreign
would be weird if you had a kangaroo
plus you who wouldn't tell but I mean
[Music]
well that was
very sick
I think every plush I have has a butt
[Music]
so you should have some thickness to it
I'm sorry
yeah this one
is actually covering the chat so I could
actually not see them very big
you did about tweet big butt
[Music]
now I have correct that
I wish I didn't put the texture but I
went
yes you have a kangaroo plushie that has
a big butt
that makes more sense in the comment
so there we go here is
it's like
with this sickness good here
I can see because I can't really look at
what the sickness is on purpose
underwear because she ends up wearing
the underwear there are the films
but this
wait
let me tell me guys actually
yeah because yeah there is nothing
all right it's in yeah
outside and I've been copied inside but
yeah this is very thick
there's nothing that's inspired though
she's an original character
character do not see
barely not
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
but I should probably look as a child
here instead here we can look at the
thickness of the couch and it's pretty
basic
right this Stitch which I should
probably
if I'm going to match the style anymore
it's not like 16 centimeters
parameters that's what's going on
so if I do 16 that's very sick
my Russian Donuts
pretty intense now I don't think I can
do 10 I think when yeah
a little bit another thing that can do
10.
you're killing
and then underneath inside
because I don't need it but I do still
need that thing so let me solidify once
more
okay that's
a lot
since you wanted to go
nice
half a meeting
apply
and then I only need to remove
the insides but I keep
the edges like this
um
I'm trying to sing now
yeah I think
yeah yeah yeah it's fine
I mean everything is fine
[Music]
so since the underwear
which is just this part it's going to
take system every basically every outfit
I need to find a location that does not
take out much space
did it have any
no it does not have any
anything
and I should like
let's put it here
foreign
I think that's good
[Music]
um yeah that bunny does not look amazed
I wonder why
and now she got blue voices
but she should have pink
[Music]
okay now she likes topless because
because she got some clear sounds
[Music]
oh my I don't have any folder open files
my mom even not silly of me
[Music]
it's a bit silly
but I'm
not thank you you need to be scented uh
well like the whole thing is being new
she's topless though
wasn't that what I said
[Music]
thank you
and then I'm going to call this boy
shorts I guess because that's what she
wears she likes she prefers wearing boy
shorts
is that your own looks like she's
[Music]
named
well you know what I mean
I meant
[Music]
looks weird
it it looked kind of fine when she was
naked
but now that she's topless now it looks
weird
I'm going to
[Music]
get here
[Music]
I don't know if you know what I mean I
see a lot of strange stuff
[Music]
come on
[Music]
here
[Music]
going to fetch the color
[Music]
um
but today oh it's very bright
[Music]
maybe we can mix it
being like
it's not like that
[Music]
and then I should
like this
little heart
special feature
[Music]
[Music]
a place here somehow
[Music]
the same I feel like
[Music]
basically only wear a shirt or something
[Music]
and complete the bottomless which is
more naked and
[Music]
I assume you have experience on the main
shoes and nothing else
[Music]
basically tracing the heart
of my own mama
laughs antenna
and then I save this and see how it
shows up on the moon
foreign
[Music]
space pirate yeah space price heart on
her but you like the heart it's not like
your order but this is stretched out
towards it I guess it's [ __ ] I know that
but
Harden kind of in there but
okay I play place it there
but we adjusted position of the heart
I will update it and see how it looks
there you go that's more like it but I
mean it's too big
[Music]
so
scanning it down just a bit
oh that's not like it
that's more relaxed
[Music]
I'm making further adjustments
[Music]
I wish I wish it could switch which
window it shows on screen based on which
we now have active but
but of course only of the winners I have
chosen
it's the show
it's still a bit stretched
quite a lot of stretched
20 pixels are not Square
I think that's more like it
that's more like it
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
a bunch of twinkie at the moment
I'm getting silly shape looks fine
on the mesh
but yeah
I got I got something like I can always
tweak it further later on yeah what two
more do you need
is the FC
foreign
color
and for the heart
I don't know
thank you
can also be in this
[Music]
FW which was also we use this
on the way
but the question I have now is was any
form of
Prince have any
okay different color of the that thing
trying to think of air
which Coke outfits
does have a print on it
[Music]
I guess this moment
Maybe
[Music]
another one is using completely
but it's
really taking a lot
it means but
[Music]
[Music]
and I rebound to the front but she
doesn't have that on her panties
or boy shorts
[Music]
um
[Music]
I have an idea
maybe this one can help me
nope
oh this
well I guess I guess I guess nothing
today for a hard thing
[Music]
like I said and come to that location
nothing there
[Music]
normal map how are they here
[Music]
maybe someone would disagree but
[Music]
back to
oh
[Music]
[Music]
my God
impacting
face of the mouth
as that means
maybe it's not too much
and I always wanted
all right
I don't see it
I guess that
that is a softer Mountain
[Music]
if you need nothing it is really that
there you go no
and very very faint
yeah that's cute
and then
if I'm gonna roughness
[Music]
I should have the same
roughness that's like clothing
like
hmm
maybe the bow should be in that
I am
clicking lightning bolt
that's crazy
that's dangerous
this might be more
appropriate
yeah I think this would be too much too
much
unrush
uh LLC
has also been up to Bill
if I update the roughness
a bit of the well
you look carefully
the heart is very slightly shaky
yeah I mean it's not not a huge
difference in
reference values
there we go
although I think
going back here
I think when it comes to cook
Coco's clothes
and it is
actually some kind of like here
yeah
seams
which I normally
it isn't easy part of the textures is
just included here
so I'm just going to steal this
[Music]
[Music]
oh
my God
now is this actually done
it's like that
yeah I should
do that in me
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
awareness
and a mess yeah that's what you call it
means analyst
would you like some pizza with an
anonymous on
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
now I can paste this here
save this
and there should be some
[Music]
extended
let's see if it works
boom
neat
[Music]
if licking all the food isn't making it
obvious I'm hungry
oh I'm
I didn't know that the lightning bolt
was food
[Music]
[Music]
and there you go
is going to bring a
real life reference I mean
something
finish should I should I
listen this design
there's all these scenes would be
replaced in the building depending on
the design but
when
uh I want to place it there because I
sense because I said so because
after reference I'm using
thank you
so I know
it's something you're not correct
when do that is going to have one
teaspoon main 70 this is going to have
one and
[Music]
[Music]
yeah
1.5
okay
one and a bit more
[Music]
all right just one
[Music]
to add a bit more detained
foreign
[Music]
foreign
uh interesting there I guess
I think nothing will go and wait before
you see I don't know
you're seeing all the cocoa moment so I
did it but it's not like them and it's
stitches and that's
that's really cute
or maybe
one
I guess
I guess you should have a broad smile
foreign
cook it right now
since yeah
buffer down should It Go
also
bro it's got a bit but even it's a
this time I can't go get away with just
copying
the shape of this body
even though it has the convenience of
you know copying the
weights and stuff
yeah I give her a brushes and she's into
yeah of course supports
[Music]
let me copy everything's here
which I will be able to use
[Music]
after I would probably just probably
half of each second and it
[Music]
married that is
so
then I remember that action and I copied
array
[Music]
[Music]
the question should I
[Music]
do genius first
maybe I should do it after
[Music]
maybe it's easier to do it after
actually
[Music]
in that case I should
keep the mirror just like that
and then I will remind you
and then I mean
work with this
[Music]
implant
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
or something
interesting
like that beautiful
[Music]
and now it's nice
very nice
now to do like
[Music]
the rest of the shape
and then I'm going to
do Nike
so that that should be a
lot when I guess it seem
I seemed as well
[Music]
[Music]
now
but that makes me curious actually
because I didn't take that
which is kind of Mr checked with me
[Music]
choices they're made for these roughness
and everything or
[Music]
uh cocus on the way
[Music]
so this is Tom Skelton and the hand has
the high high spirited but yeah
Opera and
boy shorts
very uneven
well I guess that watch
I should have included
[Music]
um
hey pan how's the jar that's a very
interesting question I mean
it's still around
and actually and then it seems here
interesting choice
[Music]
bones Yep this is the skeleton I was
just laughing at I had to fight with
but it could also mean
oh
yeah that's
quite dark here okay
quite bright here that's the exactly
what they assist me like
foreign
would be to design
this shape here
let me just
this is wrong
there we go
let me just
one that makes it stand out more like
this
is easy to work with so
marked
[Music]
so you need to move up like that and
then move down
so now I actually don't have
I look for the back side looks like but
um
I think I have an idea for that
give me a second moment
okay actually
I might need to go to the bathroom and
outside going to bring in like 15
minutes anyway
so I'll have it play in the meantime
that should give
[Music]
not that most people here have ads
anyway but I'll be back in a short
moment
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
no I don't know please
[Music]
chocolate
[Music]
City
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
all right and back I hope no one has
gone away
and this time
I brought
another real life reference
also known as a piece of clothing
I
make sure
it has
seams on the side it goes as like onto
it goes up on the front but it's
basically it's strength on the back
I mean I haven't really analyzed
my own clothing that much but
so
and I was this about the joy well
nothing
where did you hear turn from I haven't
heard about anything about the joy this
must be
your imagination
[Music]
well I didn't need
website
so
[Music]
I can use this to
with me duplicate this first
so first off I'll do the well not the
straps basically and then I'll do the
straps afterwards
I think that's a that's a good approach
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
the moment
now since I'm
messing around with her underwear at the
moment
valid time
yes that is so beautiful
[Music]
so it will go down
foreign
[Music]
amount
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay finding the action Middle Point is
I'm going to be a bit tricky I guess
[Music]
it's finally since I don't see
the mirrored
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
there that's the middle
yep one too many
so
foreign
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
so
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
like that
and I got
is distracted by
[Music]
notifications oh
[Music]
why am I
[Music]
[Music]
there was an hour ago but Steven
[Music]
what's happening with her bra is it
if you're curious this is because the
bro because I copied the polygons
from the body but I have not moved them
that means they are exactly on top of
each other and
it doesn't really know now which of
these it should show over the other
many types chosen to
or it doesn't seem to have a system
where
it doesn't seem to prioritize one over
the other
because most of it isn't jittery I'm
liquid because that would be a nice
thing to see
this is some
usually don't see this in games but you
can actually see this in games if you
play for example if
at least the first this seems
as if you place an object which is
because the objects are kind of they're
kind of 3D of 2D pictures at any place
another object of the exact same type
on top of it uh you're going to see this
T3 effect
but blending seems to have a function
that stressed off white
and having a jittery if they're exactly
on public study however since I'm
since I have cropped this bottom part
here because this does not line with
this and these aren't exactly the same
but they are still
and they're still on top of each other
and therefore it now has issues knowing
what it should do
foreign
stuff
that's one of the early
when it comes to 3D stuff
you know
learn
that fight pink
on this artwork I mean yes it goes down
and I assume it goes straight to the
back side it's just like the real life
bro I have here
no
and I'll say if I zoom out yes and now
the whole thing is having issues with
knowing
actually in it's in the end mode it
actually does have this outside what it
seems to from the system that
tries to avoid it but in edit mode it no
longer a system and this is how it then
appears
and exactly how it appears depending
from game to game but most games
obviously wants to avoid such effect but
they might end up still having it if
they're not scared from
[Music]
like countless things end up coming
because the corner is here and only the
one that is not a good place for the
corner
anyways I just did that
and now the corners there instead
watch
annoying me I can't see
because it's kinda
peaked on the front
adjustments
trying to find
[Music]
Middle East of that
but anyway let me duplicate this
copyright and then I do these
[Music]
well it does some calculations
[Music]
when I suppress something
[Music]
maybe I need something
and I do need to know
[Music]
well I guess that seems that should be
search it's not should have been halfway
that doesn't mean I know exactly which
point so
some
things
[Music]
[Music]
but I can't kind of figure that by doing
adding the plane
[Music]
that's the bottom one
meaning that on the top I should hold on
so
select three of them and press delete
versus there you go
[Music]
I don't need this plane
what I do need
it's it's stretching these out
[Music]
there we go
it's like he's like an armor
oh
so now I should be able to do intersect
bullion oh at least I've never seen one
I am
Maybe
I need to disconnect
some more
once
okay let me select all of these and then
I'll manually every Edge that it's kind
of intersect with and then I will
simplify the shape at the end
it would be way too many
[Music]
Embraces has been great
so this would be the base shape of it
and then our DVD
there we go
another secret this line
and it seems to create this line too
which is
all right merge the two object
[Music]
let's do that
foreign
thank you friend
thinking of talented
[Music]
so this actually
looks like I don't like to say oh that
subscribes thing
he hit that actually going to sleep now
but thank you for sure but say you
saw you online
hope you have a good stream I mean thank
you for stopping bye I really appreciate
that
and it's been good so far a bit slow I
guess but slow and quiet but it's been
good
I've made quite some progress as in made
some underwear
and yeah thank you for being here for
this short time
and I hope you have I actually didn't
create an overly abundance of red so
they appreciate that
so yeah I could like eat that one
yeah big nicer okay
[Music]
yeah it was very kind with the vertices
but here oh oh here they are
[Music]
don't think anything's extra
actually
about the need to create these
especially since I will
and what what's the middle
[Music]
well it's certainly not
one of these
qualities
I don't see if I can
work myself
oh
my good times
I guess that's the closest in the middle
[Music]
now I've seen a few lessons stuff
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
another question is should yeah I think
I think one is enough here too
take the middle points on today
let me
[Music]
maybe that's the main point
then I create
this one like that
can I Yes actually
like that
nice
shape
[Music]
but right here I wanted to you cannot
all the way around
okay what's the
[Music]
there
[Music]
maybe I shouldn't
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
the inside for the skeleton specifically
but then yeah then I have to create
these straps
[Music]
I thought she should have a strapless
bra
should be straps
this is kinda White
[Music]
digging less into the shoulders I guess
[Music]
how do I
best do this
I said I just didn't have this
which I still could use
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
One Step lower
instead of this
foreign
[Music]
maybe I should just add plain
that's this way you can create a strap
based on these two plates
think camera camera
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
try to clean up
it afterwards
[Music]
utilizing many of the two step program
has
[Music]
I guess
now wait yes oh no I mean it works but
[Music]
okay there we go
[Music]
to Facebook and this one this is what
I'm looking for
because seeing there are settings
with these tombs
or live video
foreign
[Music]
stripes
I mean yeah
I think this is good
[Music]
now I just need to
have everything go together
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
let me erase that one like that well
let's Dodge it up right there
a minute
let's keep that one
[Music]
[Music]
it missed the point
[Music]
making it progressively
and just reading stuff about no man's
sky right now I'm gonna be interesting
and a new detour
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
chest deposition of lines
seems to me
I'm Gonna Keep position on him because
he's basically
um yeah
I think these positions are good
magnitude then is I
[Music]
[Music]
think
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
like that
[Music]
[Music]
airplane sounds
[Music]
for anyone watching
who will be watching this
[Music]
[Music]
I will do the
Extrusion sing so
[Music]
solidifier thing
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
myself
[Music]
there's a lot here
not too good
[Music]
that has to be some
[Music]
so I would probably have to try to avoid
more to keeping
back here before
[Music]
and it is solidified only if I should go
make something to eat maybe you should
you've been talking about being hungry
so
[Music]
it seems
very
[Music]
appropriate
to eat something
[Music]
give me a chance
[Music]
if it wasn't easy just do a redeem and
have something to eat
meow meow welcome kitten
look at what I'm doing
I'm doing some underwear
and currently I'm making sure that the
other way
doesn't clip through the body as it is
at the moment
[Music]
hmm
nice and cute
it's like how you like it
[Music]
I mean who wouldn't play with the
pumpkin mod if it wasn't even looking at
compounds underwear right
thank you
[Music]
it seems to be people's priority I don't
know why
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I don't know
I mean I can't analyzed additional like
that but
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
so what I do is
I don't need this anymore
I'm pretty happy with what I got
even though I mean shaking straps it can
still
foreign
[Music]
stuff
it was that it was what I used to
cut out the
shape in the first thing
ah
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
if
so this this will show up when
when she's electrocuted
and straps in the back is a little bit
long bits
it's
foreign
but in normative family form is
going to name a cat Dobra
[Music]
what's the name of your cat Dobra
yeah me too
okay let me hide the whole body so I can
work here
[Music]
I guess it's still
um this one separate
[Music]
okay let's see how much is this now
is he has to ensure that it really clips
into the 20 seconds
I guess it's kind of hard to see but
yeah
in that case it's really keeping
anyone's inside
there's nothing to be visible anyway
wow
[Music]
looks like I forgot
[Music]
there we go
this is separate
[Music]
Sarah emergency room
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
there we go
it's it's not just clicking anyone yeah
also sorry I'm going to get food I will
be back soon okay she didn't
[Music]
opinion
it should not be that anymore because I
fixed all the clipping issues
foreign
[Music]
looks like that
and I realized
that I never
or 5 Seconds
I have to
[Music]
fix that fix the
UV mapping
[Music]
there we go
foreign
but I can't even select them like that
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
perfect
[Music]
now there's a bra here which
[Music]
should have let
bottom like that
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
of course
one more detail
I should not fully done yet
[Music]
easy
actually I did some cleaning today
[Music]
and
[Music]
not eat a burger today
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
but Burgers usually come in one shape so
round and thick
and meaty
[Music]
unless you get one of those vegetarian
burgers
[Music]
which may or may not be vegan
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
chicken sandwich no
it was just a chicken patty
[Music]
and
[Music]
and then I cooked some pasta to it
but I should have realized that because
I bought
two bags of
beef patties
oystick myself basically
so it was 20 beef patties and then they
have the
X of six buns on a sec buy the two pack
buns which are killer button in one of
those I didn't and that means that I got
18 buns meaning that I had I actually
have two beef patties over but I also
had three chicken patties
that's what
so I should have got one
pack of abundance as well
so I could make some chicken burgers as
well
[Music]
oh well
you're late for that now
[Music]
this is the boy shorts
so I have another one of these images
show my working
[Music]
yeah you'll just have to wait until the
next time you can see the story
yeah which
[Music]
might be a word
[Music]
foreign
to make pancakes with
and it's a lot of Pancakes I can deal
with that stuff
[Music]
and I would make a lot of pancakes with
that stuff
because I haven't eaten pancakes in a
long time
[Music]
and I really want me some pancakes
[Music]
so I'm going to eat
pancakes I guess my current plan is that
because I'm free on Wednesday I'm going
to make the pancakes on Wednesday it
seems like a reasonable
[Music]
I was getting why
yeah I think
I don't know how I messed it up but I
was I was going to buy whipped cream
and I bought milk
all it has some white in the container
so I guess it's the same thing
I haven't done that before except for
that one's time one time
and hopefully don't do that again it was
kind of hard to make it
into whipped cream because it didn't
Whip or cream
[Music]
oh
but I'll be making pork it's right stir
frying but there's an iron there I
missed the iron
I thought it looks funny
or yes but really sometime this week
after work I know how to make jeans
when you have jeans in your stir fry
stir fry
this is fun to see
foreign
this is the bra
which is
raw at home
let's finish for good to have
and I guess it's good to have if you
need one
[Music]
[Music]
if you don't need a bride it's it's not
really applicable and I guess
technically I don't need a bra but
I know
[Music]
don't even have any breasts
but
I'm thinking that I won't tell anyone
all right now
y'all
I'm back and I got food and also on
lunch breaking
but now the big question comes I'm
representing myself what did you get
what I've done this
and can you share some with me
it does a game play it's not really
gameplay it's our thing
[Music]
I'm not on Infinities yet
ah the infinitive is really really
simple in Swedish
it's just basically the base form of the
verb the
the one ending with a or
[Music]
ah
or any other vowels
[Music]
damn
yeah
and
yeah I don't know what that's the same
it's
[Music]
good a snack to eat on I got food at
home but I work an hour away from my
house
have you eating improper keeping
is that what you're saying
should I be upset
that you don't have a problem in
what happened
huh
what am I say
no I'm just eating okay whatever it's
working good
I don't want you to
I mean it's not like I'm writing
perfectly amazing
it's good to take care of one's health
yeah infinitives in Swedish
and then you just use the switchboard
Act
which is this is worse basically the
same way as the English word or
or two is this English
word too
that's these
beans
and congrats those are we
and then
for some reason you might know that this
which word for and is ok that's how it's
pronounced properly but it is often
short and used or
and it's done so often so I think it
really really should change the spelling
of it
this extra way to write or
in Swedish because you know
because I have the rights of my hand
actually I should draw it for you
anyways I've gone quiet it wasn't nice
outside
despite going to show you
this special sign
in in English in both languages
does not apply apply to every language
in most languages you know the so-called
ampersand
which looks so like this
if you're familiar with this sign this
side would not be used in every language
for example in in well let's say polish
in Polish the word for and is this
letter there is no point of shortening
this simple lecture to this symbol this
symbol is bigger and wider I have seen
that happen but such a waste of space is
more complicated to write it takes up
more space and and so on so polish is
not the language that would need
but yeah
in English this could be used this
technique for French act which I smashed
into it as far as I've been told and
English can also shorten this technique
this should be that but people need to
understood that I think
in English and just like English as this
variant
it should be one of that second and
Swedish also has a variant
which is okay can I draw it around
this
letter O with a line under it
which I assume is from the Swedish word
starting with drawing circles the switch
word orc
required to last letters are removed and
the first letter is unlike
that is Swedish and sign
and this is the French and sign and this
is the English enzyme we truly without
the first Dash
and there you go
that's what I wanted to share
in case you're reading some Swedish text
and there is suddenly a circle with a
line underneath
I've never used that person in search
for me to your spell and or just type it
stressed
I guess
I'm basically only use 10 percent
more specific
[Music]
situation where I want to be
Vision style of it
[Music]
I don't know if that made any sense
and it's such a difference right yeah I
mean I said you have the English letter
and
and yeah that's why I think the Swedish
and bind why
I use and when I write yeah
[Music]
let's do this
[Music]
here's here's the clear solution every
language which has more than one letter
for the end symbol so for Spanish e
[Music]
the police e you don't need to
abbreviate those those are practicing
nothing
but that's what I think and then we just
apply the Swedish way of doing and some
Swedish
so the English and when we think this is
the near no wait that's not wrong
battery I was influenced
although I mean to be fair to be fairly
English
the English and science should be this
because and is shortened to um
so the A and D are unpronounced an
English one which is the thing different
the Swedish one which is which is this
word which is pronounced
oh
this is the attack sound
what about
I mean that's not how you spell the kiss
sound in Swedish and I think this is the
only word that uses this
and
when this is shortened in speech it's
only pronounced as or
so this would be the symbol there we go
English
and Swedish this is my language lesson
for today
there's another word in Spanish
the word for also
also which in Swedish is
and so
so
this is okay
and
and oops I imagine that and this
is okay so
because why not
and then there's those lazy people in in
like chat writings that write this as
this
[Music]
why not
yeah this one kind of I got it's
more proper spelling this one really
should change it okay
I mean it does look weird because I'm
not used to it but it should be this way
not to be confused with
this which is different point
yeah anyway
foreign
I can't write in cursive but I can do my
singing crochet whenever I knew how to
write in cursor I think I skipped
I
did cursive like practice cursing in
school
just like most people I guess
I am better
I don't really use
courtesy when I write
my name
I just for a signature stuff I just
write something
[Music]
when you haven't seen that you if you're
gonna have your own way of writing
[Music]
and I'm pretty sure most people don't
use cursive when they sign something
they used
scribble something
thank you
it's
yeah
and then I'm seeing people who write
like every letter carefully when they
write a single challenge
you know
I actually signatures I find
[Music]
I feel like
[Music]
and also since I've technically not
legally changed my name yet I have
actually not written Evelyn in cursing
[Music]
thank you
or as a senior chairman as I said
if that makes sense
if anything I'm saying makes sense
obviously there might be people who do
these cursive but
all these signatures I've seen it's not
good because you just
it's nice and warm today it's 23 degrees
right now
yeah I think I think that's a good
temperature
like 25 I feel like he's getting a bit
too warm for me tonight
like it's worth 20.
2023 that's good
I can't be too picky
can I
because it's I mean it's not
I mean after all it's not
and
I'll try to avoid that place
oh that's that's some warm warm
here
I don't want that
oh yeah
maybe some noises
isn't that what he's saying it's awesome
anyway
so this would be the uh where the
drives meat
herbs meat
when you have all the also known as
bacon
a joke
anyway
and let me check
long sleeve shirt with blue jeans Cara
weather
definitely not
that's when I wear a
tank top maybe maybe even a maybe
another tank top I wear my dress
with like two singles I should I should
have the dress with just one there
I mean except except the parkway is just
seeing if you can see my other one but
yes
but it seems
it seems very nice
at that point
maybe maybe
um
the high over here is supposed to be 26
later in there but there's a lot of
class out here it looks like it might
rain
later it is
dessert that's it James
and it depends I find things sometimes
sometimes it just rains too much
but at the search of skinter
[Music]
you can have the rain here yes and it
tell me not if it has tornado
true
tornadoes tornadoes
never need a new conversation
okay anyway these parts
hopefully detective beside effect policy
[Music]
switching back to blending
[Music]
so first
I didn't say about making amount
I forgot to send color the c section
which I love the color
[Music]
so uh update there we go now it's pinch
and then update the normal map
so it's going to add a theme here and
something there
we go
it is working there's a Sim here
do you seems there
and if I have the body it looks pretty
good
[Music]
I'd say
a lot of us amount it gets the same
glitchy effect why doesn't that do that
it doesn't
why does it treat earlier here when it
should be the same text
strings
[Music]
so I'm not sure why it doesn't earlier
maybe it's because
no it doesn't
strange
it's been strange at the moment
is the third in the desert alternate is
here to the nerve let's get
that means I don't need to be wearing
Apache
so the last remaining thing
should be aligned across
basically here
[Music]
I should be able to do that but add
plain
move it
to the desired height
[Music]
where I want the effect to be
foreign
[Music]
something like that maybe so
foreign
[Music]
class
[Music]
like that
do the intersect domain
intersect right
[Music]
oh
yeah right away
[Music]
what
oh
[Music]
okay uh
let me try it
that's more a craftable it doesn't
matter
does not matter what medicine I get this
shape
export Unity
meaning
I remember when we weren't working last
week how I was drinking at the end of
the conversation maybe
I can't even remember the conversation
[Music]
and I can't believe it so
now with this reference
I can go back here
and import it
number three
well I guess you won't see me over here
if you can read it
let me go
there you go wait
a minute thousands
my intention
I don't know every time we see this
video
one more try number three and also
because I had the
plane selected they created the UE
platform but see a smaller but
let's
yeah Mr peace I am looking for
Tuesday morning anyway I never told you

even started up the style I blanked up
children up to the cooling it then woke

I couldn't find it it's much longer
though
how long after I understood it was
Tuesdays I was streaming at what team

be adding design
switching over the blending and upgrade
money now
by updating this
here we go
now there's a line across
good night too high
I don't know
I guess it's not too high I guess this
one is
[Music]
[Music]
I guess this words
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
obsessive
restrangler and problem made of maze
so it's ah have you noticed this part
one
I cannot neglect in that
I'm writing something accurate out here
yes
[Music]
but I guess I guess this is
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
stretched out this is
so if I put this one
when the body is
so let me escort like this
stretch it now
[Music]
so zero
[Music]
went to five centimeters
one is zero
and minus one
is 50.
that means that even 50 steps on two
units 50 centimeters on two units
therefore 25 steps on one unit and I
wanted to move
leaking sugar becomes all cheerleadering
share language
thank you
[Music]
and
again
I should do
0.6
[Music]
yeah that's better than
[Music]
comma six
[Music]
that should be a point where
no
[Music]
the nearest body really
[Music]
do it wrong
this is
one last minute a little bit this one
centimeters on me
thank you
must have done that
[Music]
will explain why it's so weird
yeah because if I do you know
that's me too
good night
okay
and then the point
and this one's correct
one that's slightly annoying but
it's too hard to fix
[Music]
let this machine just to be sure
that means that if I do
yeah it is one centimeter
when I should have gone with
what no problems
let's explain why they
stress measures
clipping straight as well so much
no problem I'll just do another solidify
this time
had your nine centimeters because I
wanted some one
now it doesn't flick anymore on a
distance
now it is now stash it's kind of hard
because it becomes so small on stream
but yes it starts looking at the same
time as deep on shorts
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
and then
I'm sure it is no option to not be pink
inside
[Music]
let's see me some work and if there is I
don't know what that option is
[Music]
and what do we have Pirate no outfit
change
have I been bad at
doing them
don't you want to try the ultra bit uh
I'm saying of course oh
so you don't want to do the underwear
honey
[Music]
okay this one is better now now
and then
I've been closing here at 7 okay what
are we no games
see it's the other way she's fine
wait that's how much I'm working on
isn't it that appropriate
[Music]
[Music]
under it
with blood that he mentioned
[Music]
I guess that's that's everything so this
is the texture for
I guess the underwear option
what does that mean this
[Music]
is interesting or is it because they are
preparing the person named
apparently that matters
so all these all of these blueberries on
the news that you have
well it doesn't make sense because the
underwear is just
so
yeah this watch is called Raw
boy which are meshes I could apply
and this is called body
[Music]
and then I should conquer the variants
of the morning because in this case
this is the variant that I will use
and when using underwear
so here I'll delete every
polygon that's completely hidden by the
underway
which is pretty useful to different
names like this it's not many many
one guns Philippines
and there's the team by the way
so these are
the boys shirts are exactly on the
right means
strike that we can navigate them inside
[Music]
I've got this
thank you
I like your heart no that also means
that when I zoom out now
in which again can be hard to see on
stream but you can see something happen
much less at least it's like that
there's not like in the big areas
[Music]
big areas
[Music]
oh correct EVS wasn't able normally it's
not the name and it becomes like this
correct English should be in a month
so it just does this
anyway I can
do that
[Music]
many I can get oh
come on
[Music]
okay
oh
I'm doing
Samurai
why are you making us
okay
[Music]
there you go
and now I can leave this
now it's even very
now it's just this steps or whatever
this is the special
uh
sleep is that what you know what what it
is hot sleep
but now that you know it yeah sorry all
right see
what about Batman
yeah
isn't she
and I have one bunny on here on the
wheel that's the model that's really
I hopefully
that's nothing issue
[Music]
sound that that means I can get rid of a
bit more
but I can't do much about this
this part's too loud
and
apparently that would be tomorrow but
not much
I don't know what it says giving
oh
[ __ ] Runway
there we go
now I can see there you go
best clipping in my channel
cooking the news
thank you
and
it's called calling I asked the word
[Music]
let's call it call
underway
this body has been called for underwear
so now
this whole thing can be exported as
the only variation
so
and instead of it I should do where
[Music]
the electrified version
kids
but I've only been going on for four
hours and I've done one outfit
I mean
I guess that's not bad progress
[Music]
so this is the part I need mostly
[Music]
so here's the skeleton so some things I
don't need this underwear
just remember the underwear from
the skeleton
and here are the parts of the body like
this part which is really hard to see
during normal gameplay
for this part you can of course
I actually saw this part is very hard to
see you too
um
I've been against the Clans basically
so
like somewhere with the other way
[Music]
skeleton with a bow
right this would be the
Pom-Pom skeleton
skeleton
skeleton
[Music]
yeah I do have to make adjustments let's
say the one if it's inside but so
something I need to do is first off this
needs to be the body
and
[Music]
right
okay
[Music]
because this one is continuously
skeleton silhouette and then there's the
that
and then really
normals there we go
I don't need to show this anymore
and that's kind of like you can see
through here bunny
of course because
it's not doing like
like yeah the face is weird
because the real copper face
oh they're basically just
of everything
and I can do that
[Music]
since this is the prime version
as these nursing is
um
this instrument
[Music]
they wanted
I said I wanted to be accurate
and it basically just removed one right
here
for some reason
what did they do more
seems like their mood
they're curious
take this
so I can analyze it separately
[Music]
flip normal so this is without the
inverted effect
and I basically just deleted the eye
[Music]
on the outside
and like that
you can see one more
[Music]
it looks like they almost have removed
the eyelashes
oh can I do that properly without
yeah because the eyelashes are visible
like that
that's not how they should be visible
[Music]
I guess I could just
leave it up
[Music]
hi kids
something tells me to have a mood
and it looks like they're already so
extract the eye
[Music]
what what an image
in a rose bear
probably the normal thing is I can see
which am I allowed to click the noise I
don't want to ask for a permission
I'll do whatever I want to
[Music]
well in that case
[Music]
I actually don't need to recreate these
I can just leave them out
because it's not going to be me slow
anyway
I clearly as far as I can see
the eyebrows are removed
stay
is caused visual artifacts
[Music]
something we don't want
[Music]
to go
I guess I can remove those these very
Express there
[Music]
crushing or travels than it's worth
I mean plenty of
um
I have plenty of course attachments as
well so
it's very
[Music]
so left
um with this the thing is
yeah the ears are
all right
I could just
Elite
inside
and left earned his oh
I mean I don't know
because the ears
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
as well
[Music]
which is a nice part of the itchy
[Music]
which I could take
and use foreign
[Music]
with me
[Music]
my sticks first
[Music]
could use this
[Music]
and pretty tough to fair or something
sure how I would
[Music]
accept
and attach it to the
music
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
it's amazing airplane seems
[Music]
be tough the parents in sink
20 minutes already some pumpkin
then I can
delete
no she got
I don't have to finish
he's not much
[Music]
there are some things that you need to
change
which for example are defeat but they
are
poking outside
and there are too many tails
so I will
start on that
[Music]
first off behind Terrace
and what I didn't know which I mentioned
last time I think
that I do know the bones aren't correct
and I could correct it but I feel like
[Music]
Andrea did you want to keep it
give me the jump game
incorrect
[Music]
I thought I wanted to be increased but
Johnny I just wanted to be like
everything
[Music]
Pizza is a bit too big that's
all right
remember this size
foreign
[Music]
makes more sense
[Music]
I do wouldn't do like want to make other
changes tonight
and reference a rabbit that
and it's also silly when they include
the ears and skeletons because yeah sure
the rabbits uh
obviously
is there one thing you could see I guess
comment down is how
um
feet are short despite being a rabbit
which which you would assume have big
feet
not tiny feet
yeah I guess that's something
right
it's too close snoozing here
in the original design
I don't have to
about breakfast
I will be shrink this down
[Music]
[Music]
right
[ __ ]
shrink them in bed
I might guess when and then back to you
foreign paint
[Music]
missing several bands yeah a lot of guns
moving
but it's not meant to be accurate
it's meant to be cut to me
I guess that could be a mod someone can
do
uh make the skeleton accurate
and make them base be based on
a
banditudes as well
[Music]
foreign
like that
when
I guess there's nothing
nothing else I would change
to the skeleton
I mean I could I could look after yeah
I'm skeleton and band it could skeleton
and see if it is like is there any
difference between those that I should
it's not like
it's not like this skeleton it's like a
pelican skeleton in the recipe
foreign
bones
I could add that
I'd add a ebola and a radius
why
I mean it's not part of the original
mess everything and my
girl listen to me
my government is into making earthquake
to realize myself
unless you responds talking about my
idea of making it more accurate
on the nut cheese
yeah I guess that when many more than
distance
foreign
if you want such fancy features just
rotating
[Music]
who needs such features
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
then
don't don't be leaking on on the pond
with hashing done
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
very much
that's a foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I guess
[Music]
okay I really wish there was a way to
make
we could have the black just lay it on
lips a little bit
oh well
and then there's this layered on top
but
I do need versions for
model skeleton itself
in either way
but that's the last part
[Music]
I think I said to join the skeleton
[Music]
I don't understand
[Music]
because now
it is surely is a skeleton of what
you're doing
coming in here with the puns
I am the pun police and I
do
you have a license for that spun
it wouldn't be so fun
getting found out
[Music]
so technically it should be sticking at
least because Jason
is it on coconut
tea
if I'm going to argue against myself
[Music]
let's see
while I did one so I mean
to the Sweet juice
to this video
[Music]
there we go
foreign
[Music]
don't apply that
play
[Music]
there we go and now
I didn't think that
um there is I guess
I guess it doesn't matter
[Music]
yes it doesn't really okay so
this
gelatin is going to be different
because I'm just going to copy copper
skeleton
[Music]
this here skeleton
[Music]
and use it foreign
[Music]
but I did just think of one thing
so yeah it doesn't make your skeleton
now
hey oh no the skeleton is naked without
the body it's
to submit
it's the
expensively
how they should be
running their rabbit juice
she added to Pom-Pom
there's a discussion since I need
not skeleton teeth are not online but
details
coming in with the latch
welcome welcome
and free to lurch
so yeah I should do something about that
anything about how I didn't want to do
that first
[Music]
so I'll take this and then there's
basically under my hair
which I've done replace
and then they have the inside I mean
outside
and the inside so they have both which I
will do two
yeah this is a mess of a texture but
so I don't need to basically cook over
every single pump and reposition
everything about that's a lot of work
just replace the underwear
[Music]
so I was just
companies as is
I want to create any folders skeleton
my pastels
but I do have to
and do some
because I'm working at the twice the
resolution
[Music]
so then you can't can't scale down
I guess it's
kind of high resolution because they
the distancing will be
from expect a difference in size between
100 plus cover Center is technically too
small doesn't actually fit on your body
[Music]
but yeah it is you don't
these let's
I guess if I name them this one
I'll explain more normal than that
like this
yeah I still don't know exactly how I
not even ears
oh okay [ __ ]
anyway yes um something something news
because he is one of the best yeah
I said I didn't have the idea of
sneaking
all but I probably have to select a bit
more
and it and that way if we look from
behind you don't even see the ears if
you look for the front like this in
years
don't know if that's a good idea
[Music]
try at least inside obscure obscure
that's a tabs getting much of it anyway
you see most of it potatoes can help
scaring me as well like
anyway
[Music]
it's fine
come on come back
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
for kitchen is undergoing area it's
meant oh it's
[Music]
oh
why not
okay what I should do
yeah because
there are these extra outfits that they
have
um I would count out that
the first one you
come across is
base shift
okay that
and
let me
[Music]
there you go
so this is the first power up you're
wearing
foreign
here
so this is kind of what Coco's bar looks
like without anything some invest in
competitions and if you actually would
compare their underwear
yeah
the runways on the inside
[Music]
clipping to us like nah
and the bra is completely on his side
there are otherwise made a bit too
smooth
[Music]
so this would be one of the outfits for
I thought it was Sweeney
or whatever
yeah so I guess
I'll try to put this oh it keeps
straight through the hair
I tried to make this outfit for one
point
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
so what I will do now go back here
and then create
folder for each
of them
if I want to rename it please
oh
oh I never did giraffeiness
um
[Music]
I guess I'll take care of that we can
[Music]
boom done
so regularly although in this case I can
overwrite
since
[Music]
some of the
foreign
so
I want to name I'll create a phone which
would be called covers friendship which
Coco pays shift thank you
I guess where I'm saying The Taste
Museum
when
I will get back to this can somebody
after I have but it's upskinned I'm not
upstairs it's too much
all setting power
and it makes everything lag and it takes
forever to do while streaming
[Music]
so I found out
anyway it takes for as they say it takes
forever to do it while streaming go
really quick if I'm not streaming
I don't have the patience to wait with
one stream I'll do it
I'm I do it when I'm not streaming
I'd probably take down streaming is so
slow when I'm streaming
[Music]
yeah but I don't have time to win
I mean
I mean it takes it takes
for likes over an hour today or so
but if I'm not streaming it just takes a
few minutes
that's it's it's a huge difference
sometimes
[Music]
North with the huge times because I'm
streaming
apparently it takes a lot of performance
to stream
I don't know I'm not one
Target demo
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
so let's see
this thing
and that should be
hearing
around the urban
which she has while wearing this outfit
um
so I guess
something
and then
thank you
like that
basically it's copying everything away
oh there's weird shapes
annoyingly weird shapes
I want to cut them out cleanly but
this is going to work
let's just
yeah got it
as much as possible
all right
do you do
you need to
keep saying it
then it's increased numbers so I'm from
playing mainstream
but then I never do it
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
so
well I guess I can use it
[Music]
put them over to the other documents
and then place them a bit
foreign
[Music]
you got a Bonus one hour in underway
this standing there in underwear for an
hour
everyone looking at it
the bonus anyway
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
yes I have
been telling nature routine
[Music]
okay
you need to find that
[Music]
so and then just the position I'm
playing this one
[Music]
give me a second a little bit better
so
I can export a new UV which
which is actually made for
base shift outfit
thank you
what
I said I said every other one
um
okay otherwise
what
it's still nice
[Music]
oh no
[ __ ] now now I guess
this is great
[Music]
it's been been defeated outfit
I'm gonna say no more
going back deep today
[Music]
and this
[Music]
it does need to have his name but
[Music]
now actually
[Music]
today
I would look a bit weird
and now I just need to
pumpkin
there we go
this is
well camera since
foreign
but
[Music]
kiss
ear count
yeah I really I just left you
so here we go and then I'll
guess I'll just make sure the tuft goes
over it or something
oh what's this everywhere now this is
the face sheet
is one of the Proverbs in the game
and I guess the ears would be pulled
soon
you think
herself
[Music]
[Music]
and a power up
on fire
again for the tough to fight okay
oh
Amy
19 company inside
me
yeah now I need to go
um
anything happens
and let me just
[Music]
export it
I mean I did your hybrid there as well
and wrestling
and which I guess I forgot to remove
when you did me
sing and I want to go hey
but another
all right now anyway and so
[Music]
okay
okay let's add this
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
like the outfits are the ones
power-ups are the ones that has to be
replaced
because those are floors
kinda I mean there is a mod that
[Music]
14
and tummy time
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
let me
actually you might not be about any
thank you
[Music]
okay make sure all right
I have mature production this sharpness
swing that
but um
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
that would be something
[Music]
[Music]
please ask me
[Music]
man it's me
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
if I
[Music]
this way is
tomorrow night
the fish might just be easy to match
so I'm going to redo the crown
so deep again
I only have one of them
[Music]
face shaped
account
so here
[Music]
I place this one
where's the pieces
this would be the size they have in
documents back to the group
you know
you'll be able to
go in
yeah I feel like I should go and compare
with those other things too
so
[ __ ] me
which is exactly what I think
of being out cutting out his parties and
necessary
so let me start with
copying this
and then this one
specifically
[Music]
now it's a bit weird
there we go
and the one last one to make the mini
thickness here
all right
this is
thank you
impressive
not amazed now
just like that deep fit everything away
foreign
things up
so if I just want to see because in
there
then it's it's mission one and two it
doesn't have to deal with later
that is FC which they come to the side
if the C should be I have keys or not
in the same as f w
sometimes application sometimes not
it is and remembered
it's probably completely the black
because I don't think those parts are
metal
and
right now or there's no tea texture for
this one apparently
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
so
I have those
which are at the moments this one is
gonna copy
it says el1
and this is in your tip
the poor question was
what's with the questionna
did you do to record
[Music]
[Music]
oh
foreign
[Music]
okay it's nothing terrible other than
that
yeah uh yeah a strange
things
taking place
I don't know that's my friends here
maybe in that's probably my boyfriend
so
thank you
[Music]
I'm sorry
yeah
so
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
I actually turned around I don't want to
do this
um
[Music]
yeah I don't think this is a good idea
[Music]
it's not beginning
[Music]
totally
[Music]
I had to explain
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I guess I'll sort out later I'll write a
note about that
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
okay and
[Music]
now let's see
[Music]
okay put down
[Music]
what is it that's it
I have electricity
content I guess
okay let's see
um
[Music]
switching over to this one
so
painting down
and
94.
and then you can select lots of things
at the same time
and move them together
then it's falling down
today to write
now
by saying this
all right
I really should say I I yeah I should
start getting a bit more opportunities
now I feel like
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
missing this as
a new price not same over the whole
facts even though they are used to pray
for certainly
now I want to save the actual lines
so now when I go back here
17.
this one should have this one
so we'll copy this this one we're called
air on it
we'll take this uh
let's say let's go for that only the
same way
it doesn't matter but so I take this one
duplicate it
the actual name it should have
and then I have one of these stuff here
but then I used to swap it out for the
ones I shoot it
so see so you should eat this one
[Music]
M oh I didn't say your name
you just let me
it's completely black so it's not an
important texture but
let's get hurt Sameer anyways
there we go now refresh
roughness
there you go
not in color
and
that's all of them
No it should be using it correct yes
he's not showing quite actually yeah
[Music]
I let those old days it is the mighty
chip
[Music]
so
laughs
it is sitting beside on Coco's head that
is what hair I think
[Music]
that's
okay
she doesn't have the hair today
[Music]
I guess I can lower the beat
but I'll modify me
[Music]
the image itself
[Music]
so I can duplicate the mesh and then
[Music]
well I guess it should be called this
with the face shift but I'll add body to
it
pinkies
[Music]
it's not going to give us about it
[Music]
I'm annoying right now
foreign
[Music]
foreign
perfect
all right
I should probably have time the same
thing with this
and then I'll give the edit that our
situated
so what
I do to make it much
you did that
thank you
I mean it's just
[Music]
if if she were to put on this crown
that's the toughness
beats there somehow
and I guess you were mostly see it from
behind
me I mean this stuff slightly
so remove it up more
I love history it's quite careful
and I do want to do something with the
ears
and also I realized
that changed everyone
[Music]
and this one I'm just prepping up
without the episode
laughs
yeah it's that one lasted
switch back to
[Music]
and then update thank you
foreign
[Music]
thank you
and there's one in September
and I can't my stuff
[Music]
super boys this is only
we could fix this that makes sense
um
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
that's kind of an important function
s already have these because it was
copied from the body the world was was
copied from the body but
but then I did the
messed up
everything
I want to realize that as I was working
at least
let's see
because I was thinking that I should
probably
wrap up the
remove the weights from the nurse
and then like
close the ears
in some way
over here soon
on yourself daily
computer mirror
mirror
okay
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
wait you didn't say you left
not to mention I was away here
that is always fun
[Music]
because like yeah I don't know if you
yeah if you're gonna lose weight
[Music]
what's up
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
and I've probably mentioned it before
[Music]
but
like
can can be grown best things
[Music]
got a piece of demons for them and
[Music]
that there's been like
[Music]
I'm trying to speak
now I was gonna yeah I was about to say
but there's a lot of Middle Eastern I
think
EastEnders and running a lot of
victories
and
and one might expect like Italians
or something like that you know
very interesting
they make good pizzas that's all that
matters doesn't matter who they are as
long as they make good pizza okay
it is possibly about that the invention
came from them them back there is a
group of people
and
I wanna it should be a smooth switch
video about Japan
Pizza
[Music]

move her arms down
[Music]
but yeah I guess it's kind of armor like
hmm

foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay
[Music]
there you go
and some
armor seats for a bunny I guess
yeah watch out
niece
something
[Music]
I got the other words
she's dangerous with armor
mystery
is there
I don't think so but
[Music]
now as far as I can tell there's not
been inside
it's
not missing anything
[Music]
thank you
but now
man
do not me
[Music]
I missed out
them in again
[Music]
this ensures that
is essential game
[Music]
and then go
a little bit
a bit more shaped
or her breasts
[Music]
it hugs her chest very well
it's a purse I forget her boobs
busy looking good
I guess that's kind of what it looks
like
very well
which I think pizza is here
hopefully it's the pizza that minions
[Music]
would be a shame if it is in the pizza
[Music]
let's see yeah those are things okay
better
Focus arms being very thin
I guess I'll just up there
when I launch it here
foreign

since
okay that's individual Origins

that means that everyone is up now
welcome to each other on the same time
so now her arms if it's inside this
[Music]
oh
thank you
[Music]
I guess aside from the missing
[Music]
bottom here this could this could be her
whole outfit
but of course
you should probably help me hold a suit
and let's go around the bottomless
drop it
[Music]
so a similar here should be able to keep
these
and just
enlarge it
and how do you feel like
this one should be not as large
more
smooth it down
I guess I guess compound will be wearing
shoes
but but I feel this are these like
smallest things these shoes are very
very large
good make issues
like
shorty
oh
power up shoes
I didn't want to make these shoes
shorter since they represents to
represent how on the pot has shorter
shoes
right like Coco
I could do that biased
moving this Orange
case
foreign
part here
[Music]
and you find the solution for it
