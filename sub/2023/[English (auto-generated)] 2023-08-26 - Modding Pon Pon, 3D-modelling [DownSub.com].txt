now the microphone is plugged in
the fire is here the bonbon
we got Cinder for
we stood around so very late I have a
minute late but
I am here
and this is
gonna do some
morning today
once again screen size
that probably
I think that would be good
we have olinian who redeemed the first
it's been first many times now
very early
at this point I need a second answer
so today a
I'm always first yep that's you
foreign
[Music]
since the stream is planned to be six
hours
to mention it for six hours
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
so
what I'm planning on doing is that I
will do the
maybe I should bring up the premium
window
s that's yeah
so I can see what's showing on stream
there's nothing about Crash months I'm
going to be great
and then open the
outfits project here and then let's see
if I can show it on screen
[Music]
here we go
and there it is
anyway late rabbit stamp eat
yep
you weren't here when it happened
why are you using Batman you got the
battery rabbits oops
[Music]
well I guess that rabbit isn't
stampeding but
but it's still better at me making
Snapchat screen okay
they should be fair pumpkins running a
Christmas screen
[Music]
you can have like
I'm I'm single having a different
transition and I could have it
[Music]
I have like a final fanton Maybe
[Music]
so so so the skin I'm thinking is
thinking of modifying now
[Music]
rather making
is the
let's see
[Music]
yeah
black and
full body skin suit you think
so
I need the name of the action fine
there ain't nothing using face
cocoa content things this is German skin
right now
and that one is called ragtime
so
[Music]
you know I'll create a folder I will
call right time don't need to code part
and then I'll call it as a note here
skin sheet that definitely replaces
that's the
well what it is
[Music]
so if I copy all this but I don't need
the
all of the
advantages and this one is blocking the
chat there we go
I can also use more volume modes in a
message and I can use foreign
once is the maximum amount of timeout
foreign
[Music]
way too many
[Music]
what's it like
[Music]
and I'm done with my burger
foreign
all right
that does make sense
if your company Smash It of mine
and it says
yeah exactly
I can face one so if I have alternative
drivers delete one and then I can type
in two letters
[Music]
and yeah
[Music]
makes sense and each each takes up two
characters
because because each rabbit is a because
it's using YouTube UTF 16 and each each
rabbit is one circuit in a two circuit
a surrogate pair
exactly
so in
it is using utf-16 as I just mentioned
it and
this is a bit technical I guess
utf-16 is uh let's let's see if I can
see yeah back then simple as possible
since you might know each each character
you can write is in the list
[Music]
let's go
all right I should keep this suit though
it's based in here
but I don't need that button
and I don't think I need this part
I like it just make it black it's mad
so there we go
[Music]
and I could make this one perfect
I don't really need that separage
so
this would be in the home suit nothing
complicated
anyway as I said
each character you can post in a text
message if you can paste the character
it's exist you can't put the character
like a picture which is not okay
[Music]
Emoji are characters they are just like
the letter A
I should say this
this would be called uh what would this
be called
Coco
Ragtime C
yeah oh very much so that's not uh first
it doesn't mean that is an email it's
therefore on Twitch you cannot put this
stuff on YouTube for example so it is
not a character in unique
simple as that
I think it should still be black or
should I try
her purpose
yeah
for this one it's like a bright blue but
this is dark
Ness
and then I shift these around so it's
not just all right okay it's dark pink
and it works
because I like pink
[Music]
it is kind of purple
and then I say this as well so yeah I'm
gonna try to see
what I'm working on this
and so yeah and then multiply my history
refer to these numbers
but if you know computers
you know that's taken out the count
after a certain amount depending on
about the size of the thing that holds
number is
[Music]
if I could I put for a rabbit at the
head of the represent me myself but as
you know twitch can has probably been
two similar injury
it should does it break it's basically
this comments because it's not Twisted
specifically my chat
thank you
no and this one works is it because it
is because it recognized the twitch and
the these the most these emojis that's
actually emojis uh sometimes it has
easily recognizing them as emojis that's
when it breaks
[Music]
oh wait why is the message different
I again I removed my rabbit that's why
it's different
you can do that
yeah and the Divine breaks is uh
this one is a carrot for example at this
time it actually worked
interesting yeah because you drinking
this card is it right there
so your voice will wrap it it works for
for characters doesn't even recognizing
an email
reason
that's why the first one is leaving yeah
this seat will not be metallic and
nothing is same is fine
yeah
so anyway
no that's one
[Music]
in in
utf-16 which is the technique I was
talking about that is 16 stands for guys
16 bits that is two bytes per for every
single character
she doesn't even change the experiment
okay no because it's nothing
it's not it's not an emoji character yes
a character I'm sure why it's broken
she's disappointed that it's broken
it means that every single character you
can post in Twitter comes as two bytes
each regardless if it's the basic
English alphabet or if it's uh extended
alphabets like college letters
seeing what's the
right it is kind of rough it makes sense
unless you want like a shiny more shiny
version of the skinseed well let's start
foreign
like 16 000 characters or something
Unicode which is the list of characters
there's so many more
uh characters so
to allow you to get even more characters
new collection this one is Strike Time
I should specify skin suits because I
didn't specify here
gamer is
on the way
[Music]
so I need to duplicate
this
and
so yeah
right time
yeah and this is the only all right this
is one this one I haven't used the bowl
for a while
[Music]
it is used in underwear but it's not
this sort of gravity or friendship once
okay
yeah I need
back yeah I need an edible go back
so
I have to go here
I basically copied over forever and then
well
you're gonna need your name
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
there we go now I just need to save this
at work now I need to change color of
the Bell because the bow
so I wanted to be black
and that was that this was the thing I
was gonna do
before I said
how I wanted an easy way to modify it
and now we're going to turn the elephant
love my favorites nothing pieces
as soon as you combine certain emails
Emojis with emotes and great so that one
is very strange
that one is pretty straight
but for some reason combining
yeah that one's broken
and that one is broken
but that one is broken wait is it Tony
broke with certain
all right that doesn't make sense
right
I'm gonna keep using them
if I didn't put space with me when did
it work before
it's strange
that works
is it is it when you have one nice price
to me
and that works okay
some reason having just one brexit
I haven't yeah I probably didn't do
proper testing with just one I probably
have to test at me
one
of the two Mysteries not so it's not
soul but at least now it's figure out
but you have one emoji
it breaks
and if it recognizes money account will
card will not break but as you see it's
not displayed in large because it's not
really straight as an emoji it's only
registered plain text
yeah the remedies right it's the most
Emoji arrested registered as Emoji but
that carrot is not I still haven't left
indeed
[Music]
okay which one
right I mean sharpeners in green as my
first step
the red roots from green and blue it's
from Green
March this
or should I
never change
stations of course dark
so that's more of a gray bro
so let me change now
what is the darkest on the pillow
I think that's that this is the darkest
part of the world
at 70.
so if I set this to 70 there we go
that's dark well
then we can adjust the contrast of it
that's not do it for now
one
well there is this one
and I guess so
make it the same color
as the
only time to save all of this again
let's see yes same
FC
yes I will I would like to replace it
w
M which I don't have to say because it's
never changed
and
[Music]
are
and that's it now back to blender
because now
and switching to there's so much nights
at least
that's big gamer
oh it's a heavy one there we go
duplicate it change it to
ragtime
[Music]
and then this one should switch to first
one I think I know it's got color
that's nice
so
now I need to modify these values
press these are usually
gamer things
so switching out to correct time is 10
figure out his black seeds and but I
need to change
these alternate values this one
um
and set it to you know color it's
important
I
know
that was that this kind of interesting
I'll get to that part 19. and
or Mrs work on
uh non-color what does it needs to find
anything
and finally and
and it's not good
now
yes
she wearing the
SE verse
around here
this is where I want
parts
this is the daily bread Fisher yeah
there we go yeah oh yeah I didn't miss
no little naked she's not Naked Anymore
she's closer now
should I should have cut out a hole in
here wash it is this fine
the future
yeah I gotta fix that
this is why
this is why
foreign
[Music]
listening to Lemonade music
as I say as the music goes great
so yeah
It's a combination of the new music I
have the last week which I don't think I
only added on Sunday and I only played
new music on Sunday but now it's a
combination for only all miss you had
before
and all the any message
and the new music is about her so every
other song should be new in all and old
on average
he actually looked at this now that this
is the accurate UV
let me
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
ounce feeds
[Music]
it has exported so now let's import it
[Music]
Pom-Pom mods
I just need to make sure the microphones
face towards me
um UV body that's the one
thank you
if I inverted this is a well some parts
he should see
so yeah here's the issue here's the
culprit
no support spray
[Music]
where's my
foreign
it is important to me
yeah everything else is great
I don't want to swim
and this one is unchanged
and when it's fixed too but yeah and
then there's no
[Music]
um
because if I remove this
so there's like this effect on the toes
and I think I'm thinking not to have
that because it's it's going over the
toes
so it's not going to show the
details of the toes anymore
foreign
[Music]
I think I
as you say over the ones I'm actually
will be using are M and C
because I will do further updates
there's one more strange I'm gonna do
so when you spring it and you almost
done the spaghetti stop throwing a
spaghetti around so now I can update see
here we go of course
that's because
that's part of the n and also this is
the shiny thing here is another bar
and there we go
so yeah
now look so
nice yeah so so when when she doesn't
have the covering of beads you can kind
of see the details in so
but when she does have the skin seat on
it crosses the gaps
which kind of makes it more flat which
makes sense
and there we go here's the bonbon in a
skin City
going out at night doing trains
[Music]
easy yeah that's an idea but don't do
want that
some money things
[Music]
the first detail I want to add
what's this detail I added
to the underwear
I just want to see how it looks
still
I want to export the EV for the
underwear
let's see where it's placed
because they
because the UV for the underwear should
be the same
as for the
foreign
should be the same
I hope
so it has exported it
there you go
so what I can do here
if it wants to zoom in
case I can
do this
hard to see but
all right stop saying okay
San Francisco techniques
along with
now copy everything just to make sure
you get it correctly
[Music]
and to Nissan
[Music]
and then I need to align it with
this part
let's do some
extra
to make sure I get everything correct
and that's it all right the last thing
that was outside yeah
I'll undo that
made that now
[Music]
I can delete the part that is outside
now the only thing is this potassium
causing issues I hope because there is
nothing else
so anyway let's see I should do one more
Scene
[Music]
and then that e stats
yeah
the red comes in that direction
and green goes in that direction
[Music]
now
when I rotate this
come on
yeah
we can see that
the red knuckles in the wrong direction
[Music]
so I have to
invert the red
and this one should be red
right
yeah disable this no yeah
so this one should be set to add
and this one she's at three subtract
oh
but then this should be green and these
should be red
that needs to be a nice one
okay
Now red
is from Green
and green should leads from Red
and this can be applied to air each of
these
[Music]
uh is this the same art program you use
for art streams no
and this is a different one
I use a different one for Arch
things that's one handles and the
drawing pen much better
designed for the truck itself
all right I see
otherwise he's in
kind of the old TV mapping but it
shouldn't matter
[Music]
this is fine
[Music]
there we go
now this part is added here
so if I save this
back to plan day
oh yeah I enable the other ways I could
export it
and now here's this part
if I got an update this scene
and yeah
and
play something more
I said it to you like off the strings
they can make 25 but there's like half
the strings because she don't see the
settings should already be set to half
so then I set it to half a half to get
the actual half the Stream
depth of the spices
[Music]
so if I double the string here
[Music]
is fine I think
[Music]
it doesn't hey yeah we think strong
underwear over the spices everybody
make it
that efficient that's being a spicy
first to be expected
[Music]
wait I need to write a note to myself
like
oh
yeah
yeah
[Music]
and there's a black belt
a couple like lucky very dark gray
but it's always shiny so
it probably works
there's one more thing I do want
maybe it's going to be tiny here maybe I
should lower it one step
I love it one step but then I wanted to
add
one more detailed and then I'm happy
with our clips
so let's see if I can do that
[Music]
I have to use anything
back my hair before
in that case I should be able to
their hand yeah it was set like that
before
so
[Music]
you'll be able to do that
and then just press delete
[Music]
the meat
delete delete bouncing
there's nothing there
it is
and finally now it's gonna be different
here
so
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
and then I export the rest of the
textures
so I create a temporary one
[Music]
and then
[Music]
ironically wearing a spice sheet it
would make one a terrible spy
I yeah
but it is not
she would not wear that in public and
try to melt melt in with people
I asked him she's she's going to wear
that night so she's harder to see
well you know just wearing it
okay surely he has to show off her
curves and Voice team
the point of being a spy is to gain
access is someone or something without
drawing unnecessary attention
so you're just like you belong in the
place on the mystery spying a spiciest
would make it obvious by
yeah they're efficiently wearing it
cashing yeah I mean you make
very good point
I never claimed it to be a spy suit if I
did I made a mistake
foreign
[Music]
like that
[Music]
and then
that is very white uh
foreign
[Music]
oh I kind of like those at the same time
more left table
I think you're gonna catch it I call it
a skin suit I think
I think I accidentally said cat suit but
that was such a different seat
yeah and that was not on stream
[Music]
um
so and this will act as a height map
[Music]
a skin suit casket spices all the same
to me I mean yeah
but in the technical difference is that
she's not going to work or wear it as
a spy because he's not a spy
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and then I need to open that web service
I will convert it to a normal for me
which is called smart
it's [ __ ]
normal
smart normal something
smart stash page that was the name of it
I wasn't smart enough to remember
[Music]
open
virtue
and then
copy picture and put it in today right
here
don't need this temperamental more
you'll need to see or anything nothing
this is one
here it is
just need to keep this part
Okay so
it should be limited to shape of DC
like that
[Music]
so here's normal map
so now I can save it
and hopefully
it becomes like again so now we're gonna
open this one
[Music]
I guess you didn't go as I planted a
little bit weird looking at front here
ugly
human being there is a bit odd
[Music]
yeah you're having good but probably
burn it
[Music]
well inside the ears
when I try to add here
something at the edge
didn't give us well as it hoped but
[Music]
I guess better than nothing maybe
a few years in distance you can't really
see it
and I guess
um
foreign
[Music]
maybe the bow should be made of the same
material as this
is the suit
at the same time it's a
bow
so what what if I put it halfway between
what is now and
and
let's can sit
and see if that helps
yeah I think that helps then
but then I
probably
[Music]
do you want it to be darker it's a bit
too Gray
[Music]
so let's find the highest
like this part of this
bow
tie
it's kind of dark
[Music]
there you go
let's put this 100 but
and then I make it
then I feel like I can't bear control
over
[Music]
the brightness of it
you guys very
it becomes very dark
and it's meant to be I'm black oh anyway
oh ads
you know darkness my old friend
nice
nice touch
Kind of Perfect fitting Better Together
[Music]
is it done
I think that's it I don't think I have
anything then said
I'll argue this one is
complete
[Music]
let me know if there's any means
yay
[Music]
laughs
[Music]
so
[Music]
then I should probably move out today
[Music]
I want to move up to that one
swimsuit should be
I need to figure out what the name of
the
original one is because I need to know
which one I'm replacing
this one I think is called pirate
because it's staying water like yeah I
think the pirate upset fit is a one
that's could be the swimsuit
point
is that how I say it point it
is
the pirate yes
or did you write in a different language
Maybe
all this
this will be Pom-Pom
uh if you're a pirate then you pronounce
it
I know I'm a Pilots
foreign
which is private
are we the point rights
party rats we are appointed
poison rats
[Music]
there you go see that's nice
if you say so
should you Mark here
let's create a new one which is
right there
and you know what pirate is in Swedish
it is not be right there
oh
so and for the um
let me guess yeah I like to guess that
was the point
obviously you can't do the pronunciation
but I guess you could Mark if the vowel
is long or short Swedish marks long
vowels only one but markers along with
the the accent mark
and so you can use the accent marks to
show which vowel he should belong
and their wedge ones are not smart are
it's beginner
that's not my Icelandic
[Music]
so this one's 70-275 is free
green generate yes
so 17 35
and then I reset things
[Music]
[Music]
switch out to Red Channel
in a minute
I think
[Music]
let me check yes
[Music]
because then
[Music]
I can get like this
and have full control over what color it
should be
so
I do want it to be perfect but
everything approximately
because now I'm going to do a swimsuit
and I had
in secret
we're now almost looking preparedly I
did actually show to a few people what
is the outline for the swimsuit to me
and here it is
[Music]
this is the outline
I'm very very warmly the reason why I
did it off stream
is because
[Music]
when I try to do this on stream
last time I crossed the whole stream to
like massively so
yeah
I'll settle under it is offstream
[Music]
but I will do the actual texture on
streams and so this is all reference you
have not missed money so
[Music]
once again since the Vikings and we're
talking everyone who would go and race
to work Pirates
I mean the Pirates and biking are
different ones in Swedish
[Music]
since they are kind of difference
because you have the whole culture and
aesthetic to the whole thing as one
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
saying that
[Music]
like saying that in Swedish part will be
called The Viking wouldn't that be like
saying that in Japanese a night would be
called a samurai
I guess it's a client Samurai I don't
know I don't know enough yeah I don't
know
okay yes
[Music]
can I do a form
a shape I mean not a form
so let's make these
okay
slightly different to yourself
[Music]
[Music]
yeah and then it should be mirrored but
uh
should it be accounted I hope
foreign
basically serve the same question being
normal bone Warriors just serve the Lord
that wasn't
even though it was mostly a joke you
know that wasn't actually far off from
a good example
[Music]
and then the middle
[Music]
yeah
in the middle
[Music]
now
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you boom
there there she licks the spaghetti then
turns into feral Bunny and that's what
they're doing but the fact this is a
transformation sequence
no I can't eat
[Music]
I don't hate it when he is
he's eating some good spaghetti
and then turn into a brown version of
yourself
[Music]
is evolving
it is an accidentally
Melody
[Music]
there's no TV mode so
[Music]
um
no Amy
I guess you just have to give me three
more subscribe
there was someone yeah I think someone
um
is someone resup during
not streaming
thank you
you know when I mentioned how many bits
away someone is from caffeine
because some someone said I was on
another stream and I said like oh that's
very funny so
so cute I love it I'm gonna end the
person
who has given beats the spoiling
yeah and yeah these many points from
getting it yourself
why are you keeping track of that
no it's actually twitched it just keeps
trying to do it so
twitch owner has a top 10 lists so
I guess I can I have to keep track of it
at some point
unless I can access that list somewhere
basic of course is after I don't know
all this it's really wobbly it looks bad
as it usually does
and then I have to redo the whole thing
and again anyway
he never did tell us the switch worth a
pirate now because you never guessed
[ __ ] that is with your Pirates it's
peanuts
maybe limited up proper guesses but then
I deleted yes
guess
oh yep
not to be confused with plot
but you can have it peanuts plot
foreign
ER
[Music]
you didn't want to write
[Music]
we have to keep track of what the
imperative form
nothing
let me spell another word yep
[Music]
the imperative form when you tell
someone to do it for the word prata
when you use it as a command it is prata
and change
and therefore
because the present tense is the
imperative form plus the suffix
so prata and then you add the r to them
but if you take our legs which means to
run that one does the the imperative
form is spring that one does not end in
about therefore you have to edit that e
so you get Springer
now you could argue that wouldn't it be
more Community if it was
it's a instead
yeah but people decided not to do that
because languages are not designed
they're more
I was going off the assumption that
products must impaired yeah
sadly decent that would make sense but
and yeah I guess I guess that is true
at 10
you already knew that tune because that
they haven't mentioned it before
repetition that is mises
so but you know it that's good
but now you know it is
it's like most verbs has the same
imperative as infinite
is it because it taught me that part
yeah
and you remember it
foreign
[Music]
of course
something Swedish speakers obviously
don't think about when it's big because
you don't think many speakers speak
but that's kind of right
what's based on
and then you also have these other room
that if the imperative ends with a
or ah everyone
that's that's a regular verb kinda
but when it doesn't end with uh
so like spring
that's an irregular word verb and those
those are scary
that
throughout Sunday
and so on
top uh
one that doesn't end with a like
the spring
that becomes spring spring
crazy
I didn't already forgot to sing about
the letters like why the K in shikling
or weird is pronounced differently
from decay in in
Chapel
there we go there's a more common word
or less school why those are not the
case instead and that is the same rule
that English uses
f for the letter G when it's pronounced
as so-called hard or soft
it is hard as they usually use this term
and before
backgrounds and soft before front mouths
e and e as those words contains are
front vowels and therefore they are soft
becoming
sheer and he
well
ah
or
smiling is
and I'm sure the English word gravel
comes from the same order as which is
if anyone is interested we can
take a quick look
I will report my findings
and it comes from early modern English
frequented suffix on
right right
yeah
and which is from
related to the switchboard prata
and the rate is talk with little person
purpose trifling talk on meaningful
block questsity
[Music]
yeah I mean yeah if you if you don't
understand what someone is talking about
you can say about
what are you reading about
what are you talking about
I feel like throughout that seems more
like the neutral way of
[Music]
com for the community communicate speak
Swedish of course have like other
languages have multiple words like
Smacker that's more I would say more
slang
[Music]
and taller that's because of as more of
a formal word
because
when you hold a speech that is that is
it tall
or Laton and so on
more more foreign
anyway let's see
I need some more strong color let's go
it's
this one
uh
quantity Test movies but trust me
so again I need to pick a new folder
which this time is Coco irate
I can't have seen it
foreign
at the end but you wouldn't use
um in there or somewhere or you can plan
no what pops out to the room I added it
all my in it
what are you talking about
I just make an insane same as in English
that English adds that extra verb
in this case
are
which you know but if someone else is
listening
what are you talking about
and when you do it in Swedish and many
other languages would that would that
matter for that case
Germanic language at least
item is
what like are you talking you you remove
the r and put the verb in that position
so it becomes what's talking you about
and that's the Swedish Grammy
my air Pursuit is still developing I
mean let's pray this way
so now
this is the priorities
[Music]
so let's open this one and there we go
they have not fixed it though but all
right so it's wobbly
[Music]
it's a bit narrow on the front I didn't
expect to do that but this part kind of
like this until this point
[Music]
so
lets me start with that
[Music]
so yeah at this point
let me do it
accurate
let's put it on the intersection
so like that something
enjoying I forgot to use Oak a lot in
the listen lessons because the hormones
never here yeah but it's probably
because they pronounced it as oh
and so there's no K in that sound
I think that's how it's pronounced on
your lingo because that's usually people
speak so it makes sense doing it that
way is very rarely pronounced as Oak
unless he's speaking about the word
which I just did when you're speaking
carefully
I like to emphasize the word it's the
same in English you don't even though
the word is z you don't pronounce it
that way
is it the
I said and similarly the other word the
indefinite article in English which is a
which you pronounce as a when you
emphasize it or talking about the actual
word but when you actually use it in a
sentence it's just uh
so I can understand that people learning
English also having trouble hearing the
the word a because it's not plastic
writing words and then you suppose
pronunciations yeah probably what
and emphasis and maybe they do both just
teach you both
and it's
kind of
[Music]
question just redo this whole park next
yeah let me do this one part
how to do this
and these articles are exactly important
for communication the another line is
sexual in Chinese yeah
they have
they can they can clear up some
ambiguities
but they aren't important
[Music]
such as if you're speaking about
something in general if it's about
talking about something explicit I'm not
sure why there was changed from speaking
to do what you think
if I even did that
[Music]
yeah let's think this might be bad
otherwise I just want it back to where I
was
[Music]
unlocking articles is quite interesting
because a lot of languages they've also
have to like
and then there's languages do that you
have them but don't always use them
and when you do use them they really
they are strong implying something that
you might not in multiply if you were if
you cover language that you use articles
foreign
but at the same time I'm exactly
understand how Arabic uses the definite
article
it's a bit of a mess for my brushes
[Music]
but I think that one is still
classifying so
unless I'm wrong
[Music]
and Japanese has a lot of other markers
so I could understand they're not
needing a definite indefinite article
because they have like a particle
singing and a topic marker and and other
stuff
[Music]
now I'm going to use the prefix to show
and Def okay I mean
I mean sure
is technically not but he shouldn't
should be is it isn't the prefix an
article
um
[Music]
because it serves the same function
again like a series of different yeah
you couldn't not be classified as an
outcome
I got to switch off the Swedish article
about
the suffix it only lists this as a
yes it is always a suffix for a definite
form
yes I guess that's a question does uh
an affix count as an article
that did not work I got certain
it does since Swedish have uh I mean
Sweden does have a definite article
is then need it only using special
occasions
yeah
I guess you could
but I was mostly speaking about if the
function of that that's a definite
article that holds
if it's not considered that definite
dark hole's article I need the anime
considering around
okay if I do this
uh much more accurate line to these
divide up to the reference line
then I update this
yeah I think that's bad it's a little
bit wobbly but
it probably looks narrow because I have
the duplicating it
but this looks fine
hold for the thing
this part looks fine but
[Music]
um
the strap is a way to hopelessly strap
already
when
which is a separate form so I just need
completely and just start over on it
here is neat
anything interesting topics
[Music]
International quite some interesting
languages out there
[Music]
she probably wants in between here as
well
they got some Arabic
yourself quite well on screen I hope
thank you
since it should have font compatible I
mean it's okay first one is a dark
second one is the dolls
and I assume the first one just says
for some reason I want to remember it
being a column
and the second one would therefore be
our cup but I can't remember if it
[Music]
true
and SpongeBob being being used for an
hour now
yeah basically carbon outcast
basically
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
sounds more like Kelvin when this person
killed oh yeah that's why I said come
but it probably depends on dialects you
[Music]
it gets more interesting if you wanted
if you say too mine
[Music]
and then this
is
hell
yeah I don't know
kilma
but I'm a rabbit you should know the
word for rabbit but I don't know the red
water rabbit but this it is and why do I
need the word for dog
[Music]
but wait there is more
thing this is a dog second says this dog
so
so basically you have the word for
the equivalent word for this
which is not showing up on
that's interesting
yeah I can't find this already written
that was strange that what you written
does not show up
I would assume
are hot hot hot hot
illness is hot here but I guess it's a
hotter in that case
at that account
[Music]
and when I see him when I search for it
then the implements won't show up
that one does show up
that one show up
yeah yeah it gives me these words
casting the regular one that's the word
for this
oh
.com
and then
then
then that happened
[Music]
and this here dog is this there dog
but in Swedish it becomes like a double
definite let's stop it
okay okay yeah yeah because it's a long
about according to the phonetics again
here
although it can be pronounced with a
short last vowel vowel and in that case
I assume what you would would match that
pronunciation
foreign
basically replacing every C and z in
Spanish with an S if you're speaking the
the um kind of Latin American Diner
which wouldn't change the pronunciation
but would still be considered wrong
so it is all the shape now in my bedroom
and yeah
or replacing every C and that which each
other one way or another day
in the like European Spanish but then
you pronounce it different it's
and it would
still pronounce the same if you swap
those two
foreign
thank you
I can see if I can try to clean it
well now it's a lot of
the normally I have seen that some some
write it there
the sound which had them
with their DH instead of th to show the
pronunciation difference
because it is a different breathing
this and this
[Music]
so DH there's something interesting the
spelling should be the base that's how
it's even this
peace
but this dark
I'm just kidding
I mean is it correct in what I'm saying
now so thank you that there is a
pronunciation but I mean I mean if you
say this it sounds wrong
to those two
actually we can hear the difference
which I see English speakers can
[Music]
oh
[Music]
the best way to print this is there
because
yes okay
[Music]
all right let me
all right yeah
yeah I should I should try to fix that
should I enable the split view again
multiview
there you go
remember this one here
now I can show myself working
I'm ready to keep track of all the
windows
so I will enable the green so I can see
it straight and I don't
like that
so you can see it's down here
then maybe I'll write
see what it says as I see it left the
screen
you
one yeah consonant
but I didn't evolve a Latin script
version for Arabic
[Music]
music
when I mean some used to app store for
it
[Music]
[Music]
but I said I wanted to see if
make a
when I developed my
Lefty version for the apps with what
Arabic language which was just only uh
like a joke project of joking it I tried
to make it serious but it's not like I'm
going to publish it anywhere require
everyone to use it that's that wouldn't
work but this is based on the electric
pronunciation like standard
representation or something but it could
change depending on
static this one my dialect of spelling
changes are same in languages
we're gonna start with pronouncing that
our hair nothing to come home yeah
because then this this is a letter that
is not the digits three this letter has
an uppercase and a lowercase form and I
thought that one would be an appropriate
letter to use for that
Arabic letter Waits
well visionless
so it will so plus that in most cases
it will not be confused because it is
three because it will be written as a
lowercase Forum most of the cases most
the most time
and when it is written up case I mean
that's mushroom because it needs to be
like a start of a sentence and it must
be a word that actually starts with that
let's say
or something like that not that left
digit 3 happens to be in the middle of
words anyway or like a starting word
okay it still looks good yeah I know
it's also part of that
which is kind of old Subway it is not
this really that is what I posted posted
wrote is the Latin latte
no it's not morning anymore but it's not
been morning here for quite a while now
[Music]
and dog breed
and then
I don't remember that that set or the
chair song
I can't I can't remember which is there
which is and this is chat
paramet is one of those two
I don't know if I'm wrong about that
thing
somebody
or something
they're going on a bit cleanly
that's pretty good
[Music]
this part gonna be a bit better
[Music]
shape there but this person has to
receive more
and then turning on okay
[Music]
and it's the inside so this part
and it's like fine halfway through it
but then it breaks for some reason
[Music]
so if I just straighten it out but put a
pot dot there
and help
[Music]
because you know it's not a hard fix
it
[Music]
it kind of worked now I just started
so if I move it in one step
[Music]
let's take the wrong format
[Music]
and wait
the Adobe
then you still use 15 14. bro
it's good morning
isn't then yesterday you think
good day
[Music]
foreign
like that
[Music]
it is very
but it could be very
not PNG
[Music]
if that's nothing for me to work with
[Music]
yeah
probably then is good day
polish
it's good morning that's very confused
because
sense
[Music]
like how
in Swedish and German how morning means
but like in morning means tomorrow
it's bigger I mean if you look at from
distance is pretty good
it's a pretty good
one is pretty and good
I mean I do not fix this one though
that one is a bit ugly
[Music]
should be this one
is going out a bit too much
it's just moving light and then
maybe maybe that's all I have to do
[Music]
and then it might be good
let's say position myself
so that's nice
yes
it is better
it's not perfect but it's bad
so I'm pretty happy with this I would
say
obviously the column will be different
back to regular game
oh yeah for some reason
I can't
modify both at the same time
unless I'm not buying them as a group so
me as a human
[Music]
so now okay it's quite narrow down there
it's
let's see on there it actually looks
like
if I should make it a bit whiter
so an update should remove the grid
and now it's a full swimsuit
I think it covers up but quite well
and of course I will update the normal
map yeah I think this can work right
sure generate
that's too narrow
unless someone thinks that's too now
twist it no that was not swimsuit
swimsuit all right all right
and people Miss three minutes of the
swimsuit yep
probably use it for like 50 hours
anyway
in my favorite language for saying good
morning
well I can't read it again
she looks good thank you
now to find a more appropriate color
[Music]
let me just open my
secret document
[Music]
there we go you see conductment is open
you got Pom-Pom set
[Music]
this is the purple on her swimsuit
oh
and this is it
everyone that says as Ohio
what if people is here as you say Ohio
oh oh yo
come inside I don't know
pronunciation but
should I learned Japanese
[Music]
all the way my head
[Music]
don't answer anymore
foreign
suit let's try it
you can see if the color looks good
tada
okay I would exactly we look in gaming
at the end we'll see about that this is
much more dull representation
oh don't
don't
but there will be more things to the
swimsuit
because as you can see on the big shade
this should be some it should be a
rainbow
across the body
and you should also
be some
really edges here
and like a separate of it as a separate
the easiest that way
so the rainbow goes somewhere from there
up to somewhere like here
you're not like that
if you want to be four months
Ohio
master or assignments
yeah I think I heard that one
in my time watching anime
[Music]
high up assignments
[Music]
rainbows should be like these it's not
too far down
foreign
so so that would be here
so I'm going to export this as
UV temp
orary
[Music]
then I will import it here so I see
where I should put the rainbow
whatever it has saved to Define
[Music]
any moment now
summer drink okay
[Music]
I should put it
but I do have this
reference here
but at least he tightened it yeah I
guess I'll dehydrate again
I'm going to make me knit to go to the
bathroom
when I shoot
like these
and then
[Music]
and then
[Music]
okay that's what I see
I did touch your thing before you had it
the first time I don't think you should
wait
follow me
I do have science
though what's fair enough
though
[Music]
okay let's see if we can
make this shape work
gosh I want to cope with these
[Music]
I should definitely give them only exact
same wind
so let's give them thick colors they
should have
[Music]
yellow
oh why can't I pick
because I only call us at once
pink
another pink
and Teo and there's some coins
sign
it's kind of teal color
and then same this
see how it appears
why that's bad
oh my they're probably nice
oh no this is bad
[Music]
after the only reference for the rainbow
well let's see if we can fix this
monthly time
whoa
all right first eventually decides
should I make the rainbow whining
[Music]
let's see if I should make it
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
ending and starting at the same place
but let's travel overlap them if
this is a good piece
expected
okay I'm trying to see where the wrong
parts
is what I'm supposed to say about it
update
yeah this is
now to
and then she helped him overlap a bit
that ensures that
you don't get this
gaps and much easier to turn on this one
I think because it's
dark pink and teal
I'm assuming
that's hard to see but it is a bit
purple here but I remember that right
now it's actually not as a proper
transition
is the transitioning suitable
foreign
foreign
that's where I wanted
thank you
foreign
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
and then
being here they should be moved
[Music]
I'm not messing around any curves Okay
so
I think this one should be moved out
these two should move in
and that's one up
the same
as edit one
okay then it's fine I'll be oh
did you find a bag
all right
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
do the same thing again
but for the next part
for the next corner
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
foreign
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
hear me that one in
this one out
I forgot that I need to hide that part
I am still here one of the laces on my
first place this was coming and that's
heavy oh no
that's not good
I hope you
made it looks like new
ah what can I see
excuse me
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
and this is only me who I'd like to put
the emotions
[Music]
[Music]
this would be the control
[Music]
it's only been two hours and 20 minutes
I'm done one out another bad late for
working in 3D we take off cute today is
a bit slow
take that into consideration here this
computer is struggling
[Music]
only me the number shows four but I
never really trust it no one doesn't
matter what I said
[Music]
yeah there are other people here they're
lurching I guess
maybe they're watching maybe they're
a bit shy
[Music]
remember it was empty oh
oh my
no sometimes sometimes people just don't
come out of it
[Music]
in the first place they they're in there
and they're they're in there forever
forever
they're coming out
it wasn't even contained well I guess
you didn't pay attention there should be
three people in there
let's see bunnies
three please if it's a lot of people
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
big place wait why does it say anything
it's not similar
yeah
it wasn't even anybody to be anything he
wasn't even any behind there can you
believe that
and a chain I mean if it's my birthday
yes
foreign
I didn't export it I said it's next time
but exporting it
there we go
and perfect but it's good
should I make
[Music]
the uh
yeah I don't think I have any swimsuits
too
look at when it comes to
[Music]
I do have the
base shift checking the metallic value
now because if I make it slight metallic
you know that swimsuits are metallic but
[Music]
if I do like half the Metallica
now half a sixth is not 20.
[Music]
boom
slightly metallic
but it was relative relative really
what's relevant
[Music]
is the shininess of it
[Music]
thank you
now let's see if I can get it to appear
a bit shiny let's say
[Music]
oh yeah I need to produce a normal map
too because it can't be furry that's
when very swimsuit that's a bit old
furry swimsuit
the swimsuit forever
[Music]
[Music]
yeah I don't think it needs anything
[Music]
because it's supposed to be
the computer room
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
hey
[Music]
need something
and then that's okay right
that's not great
you have added that uh
helping verb from English
and that one should not be included and
then
I would say Indian instead because the
emphasis is on the
the thing missing and after that it is
missing
[Music]
okay so in there would be would you put
the emphasis that
that's the beer and then that's it
the lack of existence
um
that means either that would be correct
that that's a general statement
inter is still correct but that's when
you really want to make emphasis that's
that's if someone says uh that's if you
say that there is there is no bear and
then someone says that you should go and
get one like Anyway of some for some
reason and then you can I emphasize that
the lack of existence is like what
you're trying to say
foreign
[Music]
thank you
and I'm gonna show you the names of my
friends out
anyway
so
let's go to yeah
and let's update these because
it should not be his furry
so it will be the normal map
so let's import it from and now there
you go now it's long enough sorry
but it's foreign
[Music]
thank you
are the same but
[Music]
shiny
as I said no color first
that was a metallic you think it's
incorrect
oh there we go this is the
yeah I think I think he swimsuit should
be nine year
swimsuits can be quite shiny
it has half this value so
my legs make it double it's a double
shininess
and then once like there is no bear the
other one isn't any better at all
else
I think you should add like a man like a
butt
then there's been something
and
I think you really think
yeah if it fits in it and then you
change it to man
uh pins
I had it but yep
I've already added that to pon pon I
don't need anything
[Music]
awkward would be if I had in a second
but
there you go okay this might be
bit too shiny
two butts
[Music]
and that's more like a like a dance
where due to
when you have like a fresh shiny
dancer
or something like that
yeah
I need to find a good although that's
how it shows blender that doesn't mean
that's actually how you can shop in the
game
[Music]
yeah I think this is more more Nike
let me try to set the metallic value
back to the same as for the
and and then I'll try without the metal
Magnus one and so first the same
metallic value as for the power up suit
and see how that changes things
I definitely probably more swim city
well yeah yeah
I'll get to that
with the metal around here and if you
remove the metal of enemy
completely
can you by disconnecting it but okay
okay I think it should have a very very
low amount of metal
so like
half of the half that I used before I
seen according
[Music]
I think it will be good
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
do anything here I think
it's based on a swimsuit from
[Music]
yep and that swimsuit does have text
printed here
which has Hello Kitty I could add the
text there but
in the same way
I wouldn't mind having that but
but
what would it say in that case
click the rainbow has it broken
and it's broken here
[Music]
these things you said I was going to say
that and that I don't want it to say
Pom-Pom but I don't want the leads to be
like the on swimsuit
it should just be a swimsuit she's
wearing
[Music]
laughs
so for instance
[Music]
expression regime
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
yeah something something cute something
that's not overly long that could kind
of fit between between these stripes
and obviously it's not going to be yeah
I like more in this I guess but because
if the text is if it's a short text the
text can be bigger
which of course
beneficial
princess
yeah I was thinking about trees there's
not much princess in this but yeah I
guess princess
I'm rejecting everything right here no I
missed I mean
um
[Music]
yeah I think princess is the best he so
far
he heals as we would say it's finished
uh
[Music]
the HealthEast is one word so far in
steamers
mm-hmm
working at this point one it didn't say
anything
you can't say princess I think that's
that's it Passover
[Music]
so let's go go
let's just goes in there
is this part in the face I mean you
could say rabbit but is it a purple
swimsuit with that that's the rainbow
one so I guess you could see Rainbow
rainbow
it's a brand name oh
I guess that makes sense
that's an argument
this orange as a reason I meant to use
as a uh
brand name
let's put chalene itself Works a brand
name
yeah
kind of like the brand name and I think
which of course most people can't say
thank you
let's take
a button and I have to wait seven
seconds
it's already one of the above on for
about three hours and it's already
known down so much because it's because
the computer is running quite hot it is
hot here so it's a bit about Tycoon now
that was some kind of cooling system
with him
with a
difference
technically not I could just
didn't any
about it
[Music]
so I need this maybe
Sima
yep see maest imperative
[Music]
your heart in the apartment
yeah okay
I think it China had to move this one
out
we should balance out
what the appears to be on their side
oops left hand on
yeah it does you know
I think it should be a bit more it's
quite
good
and then this one should be done a bit
more
the inside got a bit weird shaped there
but
that should correct
[Music]
painting Streets On The Moon is one way
of doing this but
computers quick enough for smooth
painting
because every stroke I make on the
computer
on their model lacks the whole creature
and relax to the stream and I really
can't really paint if I had to make a
stroke and then have to wait a bit
friend that is true
that would be pain
foreign
[Music]
okay let's see
this helps
I do this I should decide what text
should be printed on the back because
that would be cute to having
and then
okay that's better
I had friends
[Music]
[Music]
a bit of that that might face
friends ARF what do you call him
my people called them friends yourself
air Ruffles or
whatever you want to call them
that's gone I think that's smooth enough
smooth enough for my
in my opinion
eclipse in that camp
[Music]
then I'll see how it's
it shows back here
sorry yes but this one is good it's just
kinda good
so let's see if I can smooth it out a
bit smelly
hello Fair rabbit nice to see you
come back come by
combine
[Music]
haven't seen you in a long time oh wait
you're always here
you always here always watching okay
yeah there's a delay refreshing now
yeah I assume it says that I dropped 236
frames
as I assumed the uh as I'm working on
this it's
adding more and more
delay over time
because this is heavy for the computer
to Market
because there are asset computer is
running very hot at this moment it does
not help that it's still very hot here I
mean for me
for the computers
because if I'm doing a change I have to
wait for I don't know how well it shows
up on on screen but sometimes when I
thank you but if I click on this and
then animation let's see okay let me let
me switch to the meeting
there we go
I go to this thing we have this scene I
press on this element when I press on
this this uh trans transparency here is
going to disappear and I click and well
it
was rather quick
my steps you have to move this thing
a days of delay before it fills and damn
it adds up
it really adds up
right to move again
but I'm working with buttercups
[Music]
I appreciate that I'm
going to get to land this computer in so
I haven't even this one Whatever That's
why nothing happens
[Music]
together
and
then
[Music]
there's a sand in there
there's a there's no ear on it
banana the same would probably like it
said secondly yeah I mean it's not
terrible they're always terrible but
it's not like awful it's very calm
strange so if you write something
you write something I I see it in
basically immediately
[Music]
and because the detection eyes at me
yeah because it takes sending to me
isn't delayed then I react to the it
and then it takes time for it to show up
to you on the video
yep and you wish you had some weight
well to meet us refresh the stream from
here
can you fix me oh yeah if you do yeah if
you send that again but without the text
it's going to look better
although it's still going to be
separated two messages since that's
completely perfect
the upper part is yeah because if you're
sent to emails and they threw up asleep
but welcome
uh Annie
it
or a or M
whatever we're telling yeah however you
want to prefer that weapon
everyone know what I'm doing I'm making
a swimsuits
and this one is my
Persona which I think
I'm gonna need
making sure that's the
and rainbows appears as smooth as I can
make them on the body
so I make them so I have to make these
weird things here
compensatory yeah there we go there's a
swimsuit
s
that's what I'm trying to achieve
[Music]
update oh yeah this one is terrible
this one I have to modify for
quite much quite much
but yeah the delay isn't too bad yes
bugs me I ain't saying anything
[Music]
but what can I do
I mean I've only been like half
I can't stop this stream and start it
immediately
well I guess you just didn't count this
I was online
even though it was really streaming
I was sending
it even sending the stream to Twitch
twitch just didn't accept this remix
okay I'm back okay that's good
I I don't know why it just didn't count
count me in streaming
which I tried to
like
because it was I was only halfway
through the stream itself but like we
did it up updated stream but then it
just didn't want to go online again
for some reason
of nine
nah it's not easy
[Music]
but I assumed that they hopefully it's
better a lot worse at this point
foreign
[Music]
yeah so it was still
this was just sending okay that's to
give it updated next you know
uh against it that's what church thinks
they didn't consider the Stream
switch because this team was over but
but it was about 17 to 26 which point
does not at this point it's just that
one
because at this point the bad points
oh yeah I see I see
okay
[Music]
more like that
and then when it comes to this area
which is here
but then that would be more like that
but this one probably actually won that
one okay let's see if this works
hey first again because I'll let because
let me do so again I mean I could also I
mean if you were through it yeah I
should I should probably say hey I
wanted the first time moving first you
can
but even if someone used it in first I
can just reject it
all right
and when when I reject it it should say
not
okay
it doesn't matter you can
you can redeem it and then I can reject
it
it wasn't everything okay it was
released
because apparently when it reject the
redeem it still counts as being redeemed
when the points go back
but that means that's the if there's a
limited number of times you can limit
that number doesn't
do you have at least so many times
people redeem first he has any
but it's a manualist
so I don't really have to reject it in
the first place
[Music]
because I can just not counted
please
oh it doesn't check it automatic nope
this is a shame I wish you could
I didn't recently
my tracks emojis though yeah that is
true but not per user you don't attract
how many times each emote appeared
regardless of my messages they are they
wearing they would like which person
mostly what's the same as she comes
multiple times and it counts how many
users have used that emote
but not how many emotes it's usually
used or which uses they are
[Music]
that stuff is anonymous
this is better this was a bit too much
and then I have to put the snap part
[Music]
which is things sponge
this part was easy to fix anyway I use
everything in that
yeah and all of them will show up as
huge quality of them are missing because
I couldn't access them yet yeah
foreign
[Music]
yeah you're only
3195 points from it from the next month
[Music]
come on
yeah that is true
okay that's only almost 82 dollars USD
to me
to like
about 164 USD
for you to purchase if you individual
computer and not from the app
eh
that can only be for me someone known as
you can cat Rollings
red callings would be your anti
[Music]
-di
the the
anti-castronics is the red Collings
is there a red calling some [ __ ]
congrats callings
oh that's like we are taking the things
but you know it doesn't seem to be in
red Collings on there which
you don't have an analysis
and lucky you
it doesn't seem to be like a
Pom-Pom I mean this is
but it's not uh
or something like that
yeah currently Wagner is it
there you go there's some
even enough I guess
good enough for me
[Music]
[Music]
let's see how much I need to work this
one
this is the final line and then I'm done
with the lines
because if you eat well distance I'm not
going to see implications
closer
yeah this one is a bit cleaner here like
that part is a bit but
okay let's see
I should place a point there but
[Music]
[Music]
and then it comes up
at that point it should be this point
and
now I like all of everything up
something
don't even know
[Music]
what is it be right back okay
or do you want to be a left back
I didn't even have the right back for
the next track I said we just have a
similar back
[Music]
now let's start
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
foreign
but that's probably because it's also
melting together
yeah no striking
[Music]
if me and Mike wanted to make meat
[Music]
[Music]
don't be demanding
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
the same
because you know that weird
and bulge maybe it could be called
on the stripe of the rainbow
yeah now I'm getting it yes
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I said it before it showed up on screen
find my stash
Nibiru got the bear beer now
oh
[Music]
I tried to hide from
[Music]
but apparently I couldn't find it that
one
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
this one hopefully
yeah there we go
I was the moon my stash to cover my
tracks good luck finding it around I'll
try I'll try
[Music]
I am not the one to give up you know me
here we go
listen yeah I'm trying to ghost over
here
[Music]
morning things
bye no creepy swimsuit
in real life CNC
give me a moment
and I will actually locate the real life
smooth City
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
they are slightly here this package like
me
it's a place of first AIDS to my hand
what did you do
what did that do
[Music]
did you cut yourself while you were
opening the finger
[Music]
only even opening the bear
[Music]
oh
[Music]
foreign
even more even
[Music]
so
[Music]
and that's that's the answer yeah so um
[Music]
I don't mean it's gone
[Music]
where are you
[Music]
so I
I'm going to hold on a solicitor like an
edge around it it doesn't make sense
of course it would make sense
[Music]
so again give me temporary one
[Music]
let's put that as the
event alrighty
[Music]
it's insane that's fine
thank you that's that's what I wanted
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
look at that piece
what's happening today
this will be this message out the straps
okay
foreign
thank you
[Music]
that's not enough
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
working on my appointment
and as you can see here I've done this
easy
and now I did the normal map and
one is completely flat like updates
that was an exciting
exactly
I think I forgot to inverts the
learning what it is like this
I know
I think I think yeah I think the edge
should be spawning
that's what they need
I mean he's like
kind of what I wanted actually
this is how I really nuts that I want it
that um
[Music]
thank you
yeah I think
you're happy with my Ministry
get it
as I expected
yeah the steps like me too
I just think it's better
unless it's okay
show
nothing yet back in there the eye how
did the first aid applying what
when
am I speaking English
this is English I'm speaking at this
moments
foreign
they attach the
step
because I want even those details
that's like crazy
you see
change it to this and then set it to
subtract
[ __ ]
less pain
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
this one should be different yeah
now it speaks
I just rather than just like that part
includity
I was changing a light bulb
it was my last one and it was dark while
not screwing the ball by touching her
apartment in my hands when I turn on my
line now the thing involved to check the
one that had gone up and
if I just burnt my hand had overheated
so much it was personal nothing oh
that's
crazy let's go get started
[Music]
so
thank you
but I guess I guess Disney
attached
somewhere to look carefully
it's not going to be sure
yep
it's my sweet
[Music]
nice nice
seriously in my hand on cold water that
was your first thing
um I mean
[Music]
blunderband welcome
nice to see you
I am working on a swimsuit
as much
being figured already
[Music]
but the swimsuit the looking outfits
that he has I'm currently working on the
normal mapping here
so
just another chick update that
I have it generated I mean
now
what do you think
texture save the texture
[Music]
and yes that's fine I'll write it
and update
[Music]
yeah maybe maybe we should be
don't you like that but not sure about
that but I do like this part
and here's Place big thing
[Music]
yes
basically it's different so I guess I
would burn myself in a long time it's
going to be more than enough
most of it is my English for me
uh
not so big but when it is about
I mean it's shining
yeah I'm gonna
happy with how it's done out
but except that part
so
I could
do that
[Music]
[Music]
here is the height that I used to
generate another level
okay
[Music]
exciting looking things
now I'm holding the spin Over the Bar
it's called setting
that's what it got to be
Cody yeah it's I mean very leaf
this wasn't being here for right
so
um
[Music]
now
I think I mean this should be enough
won't be swimming suit coming aside from
still not only friends but
yeah that's my
more to my liking
[Music]
of course this part looks weird but
yeah you can look on the inside of a
gravity
yeah there you go
so as I said and now I got to be able
before I got brand that I handed opening
yeah though
or something
so
well I guess I guess
this one what do you think I can add
like a like a butt scene
[Music]
because that's we got the answer that I
got the real life sunset
which the swimsuit is based on
[Music]
and on these swimsuits there is
there inside but scene
there is butter scene leaving messages
[Music]
[Music]
and then I'll copy or at least to the
other side
I think that much
[Music]
if I feel this like that yeah let's
create this line
cheeks
[Music]
do it
[Music]
due to Redemption of the dead red
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
let's see
[Music]
I'm gonna do this
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
now I want you to enter this
[Music]
guy again
all right
[Music]
you start out here
[Music]
[Music]
there you go
[Music]
thank you
I think that's okay
so if I do die after that create a
proper but seeing
foreign
okay
this is
so
all right
respect and they
and update
foreign
but
[Music]
but I like butts
so what are you going to do about that
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
this one
like that
yes
the two
[Music]
you should delete there yeah there you
go
three
[Music]
uh yes
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
but
English
do you speak it but say but again say
bad again
[Music]
as the rest of the codes
[Music]
pretty sure the person did not say but
still
but what do I know
[Music]
here we go
[Music]
it has been moved back
[Music]
you know now it generates
[Music]
the new one
[Music]
that practice what I would keep
[Music]
yay the butt scene has been moved
[Music]
success okay let's see how it looks then
we should move from there to here
[Music]
it doesn't play with one time
[Music]
show how it came to be but
I don't think you're going to see this
but anyway but it is there
that's it shows my attention believe me
let's go look at the bunny yeah let's go
look at the bunny butt and see see how
the texture looks now
but the nice spot to see
I mean she does have so whatever but
the scandalism
[Music]
do you like this whole funny thing
but the detail I have added
or like
the edges
us
this
should be here too much weakness
[Music]
there's no
inch please stop looking at my butt
which is my button on anything
but look at it
[Music]
two seconds
[Music]
no there is a
more than one more thing
but
there's one thing that should be done
and it's this one
because what appears as option types
that's value
okay do this
I should try to make these values up
here
that's this color
so I guess there will be a lot of
experimenting now
so since this needs to be lowered to 214
movies
that is direct
[Music]
ly yes
that's the month I said wonderful party
I'm glad you liked it but
and then this one should be made
brighter how do you make it brighter
I mean that does not make it the right
thing
yes I tested this this morning
[Music]
I guess that's not
[Music]
and finally didn't believe what I'm
going to make the biggest difference
so it might not look like it but this
purple is the same color as this
practice
they are the exact same shape I mean you
just said yeah but
yeah
I guess let's
see how this appears
that's one way of changing the color of
the Bell
let's see
if this Tempo hit the
let's see how
that makes the ball appear
and let's just switch to
B there we go
yeah I'm probably doing there
do not stand up as an expectation
[Music]
correct here image
is an interesting ingredient but
I didn't want to go for this ingredient
as you can see can I
[Music]
well that did not work as plans let's go
with a different menu
[Music]
if there's a blister in my hands video
you get one that will work very hard but
at least the pain is gone for now at
least during normal videos
when I did get the the swimsuits in real
life swimsuit okay that is that there
which I haven't looked at in a long time
because it doesn't actually fit on me
and there is a Hello Kitty on it with
joining uh Indian card this Hello
Kitties
[Music]
and it says my magic cream on the front
of it
and actually it's not completely purple
because it's actually gradient from
purple to teal to Pink
[Music]
and honestly not only that the whole
back side of the swimsuit is still
you know I made it
completely purple
I could make it a little bit
not necessary
[Music]
coming back again
but I do get them and the straps are
also green but they are not done
swimsuits
foreign
there's no stars in the front of this
one
so another way of changing this color
is
finally in the corner then you change it
like this
so to get it correctly you check what
the uh 2006.
nonsense
2016.
and then it should be like no right
[Music]
foreign
something like that
and let's see how that works now it's it
still has a dark all over but hopefully
it doesn't appear to please
like that and I think
definitely Bay
that's definitely bad
that she has a purple bow because you
make sure to have the correct spells and
she's out swimming
very important
really should be seams in the size like
this
so it is like nothing
again it's at the chain
uh let's see saying see I missed it do
you want to see the body but
I can show you in body but
here's the bunny butt
there's a whole different thing makes a
seam down here
and it's a hobby
if you want whatever you prefer
not the burning see my fingers it passes
serious that's that's really really bad
do you do you think you could you think
you were coming
yeah you missed it when you feel fun
I would love to love you to see funny
please
no say
you wanted to color yourself
so sorry
no sir
no no it's just
funny but you know can I
drink Lucy
that's okay
um
I'm glad you like it but
what's more important than them but
the scene is like yeah just an
invitation especially the difference TV
is an addition of feature here
and it's just one of this slime
two pieces of slime
foreign
and recently I just realized that like
we are what I've seen
um
what I remember that wasn't
a huge problem but you know I didn't see
different names
of course
out of respect you know
and presentation full names and I want
to say that tendency today
[Music]
like it's a bit awkward same later just
because it was like it could be me
Simpson misunderstood uh taser that
works as nicknamese did you say that
that's like your name name for some
reason I have no problems here
just just for them so well you know you
have a nice sounding Museum
foreign
[Music]
that's what that's mean
let's see
who is it
fantasy wait what happened your
foreign
yeah yeah because later has to try
that's what it says
try it later to redeem it and later
let's try and redeem it
[Music]
oh okay
because
which would definitely use nicknames
when it refers to users
and that's not confusing
but let's not have changed
your his name can be quick cookies and
something
but yeah see you soon
[Music]
yeah exactly
later I hope there's no confusion that
that's definitely not the scene
[Music]
I do wish that I could set certain
redeems to not be redeemable by certain
users
sure that kids are something bullying
[Music]
but um
[Music]
how about tears you can set and redeems
to only let's say I have a checklist you
record you need to follow to the
teammates or you need to be a subscriber
to the image or something like that
really work
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
hopefully
[Music]
and they should oh no I mean they clean
the lip is still nice but that's not for
them
there's a scene here in the real life
scene
[Music]
now right next
now and now it's experience so it says
it's just small details and
I said I hope well
yeah it is a bit awkward there but the
deer there but hopefully doesn't show
and I hope they like this part is you
know
Lynn didn't seem like it was going to
look that narrow like I do prefer to
make myself something like that
now I put so much work into making it
windings
[Music]
I'm only talking about the um the the
width of the crotch strap there's
nothing weird over there this day
and then finally the final feature as
said on this real life swimsuit there is
a text here that says Hello Kitty
because it's a Hello Kitty swimsuit
which is the original one
and then
I do want to text here too
that's like some suggestion like and so
far but maybe taser has uh suggested
what they could say
okay you're closing your eyes
close your eyes don't lift
foreign
[Music]
I will make
a Playboy bunny style um
and outfit as funny
[Music]
actually appears more as a brand name
but in that case it really needs to be a
cute word
[Music]
[Music]
princess in Swedish is Princesa
you know you wanted me to give you that
so you can although I shouldn't tape it
up for you you should actually be that
you know I can type it off with other
people there
you know so you can practice much means
I realized that after I said it
consistent yeah I mean I keep going to
find a good points
I want the font similar to I mean this
is like that because of this one I need
a font
and
1001 free fonts that's a website
and since this is non-commercial the
first one is the dancing screen which
show yeah let me bring this up on screen
where do we have
this one
it does have some
can I
yet again let's bring this up on screen
okay we have fun Second Use I wish I
could show you what the original from
this but but maybe we can pick your
phones without
is very
you'd see it's like it's clear font
it's it's around it's all the letters
are flowing together but they are quite
clearly written it's not kerosene
and we can preview it
crawl it's uh
Spotify
a few many rabbits I like Alex brush
font or maybe great wipes
Alex brush
a great spot okay that's a bit too I do
like
a little bit seen but it is probably a
bold version of it let's let's first
let's put VIP game
scripts let's go for scripts script
and you'll buy
license type
yeah public domain free for personal use
that's not includes mods I mean
foreign
okay and then princess I can go with
Princess
and then we like look at
how it looks
like this is more like what this is a
bit too
it doesn't even connect today this one
doesn't it should I
and sometimes they don't offer previous
otherwise this would have been really
weird
as long as you're not the property from
the distribution of your model yeah yeah
but personal use could also mean they're
not published that's why
however I mean if it's not published I
mean who's going to tell I'm using it
so yeah
like it's a bit cheap this is
yeah
I would say the best way I could
describe the font used is it's like
uh
calibri is a default font for Word
Microsoft font in winners a calibri has
been used to surface it's like that but
the letters are put together
so sweet lipsticks
so it's more like this
my classes doesn't like uh that's my
question
[Music]
apparently not
okay
[Music]
this fund is very clear it doesn't
attach but
I can
do that in Workshop anyway
Grand Hotel let's download them but we
can look a bit more
this is collective but it's a bit too
cursive I mean I can't miss that too
yellow team
okay let's do fun second try but
you at least finish this page Maybe
take care see it this is clearly clearly
with them I don't like to disconnect
there but but I liked uh
more pages but
anyway
now that that's done
I should go and add the two fonts to my
computer
as in installing them
I do have in my downloads folder that
folder called fonts where I play small
fonts
and
[Music]
so apparently
that's what I wanted to do
and then the other one was
right okay
[Music]
to S1 or install like the color I can
open fonts license
yeah the the open phone license which
could be good to use I also line since
fun to be used started modified and
released
distributed freely as long as they are
not sold by themselves the funds
including any derivative Works can be
bundled embedded resist read distributed
and or sold with any software provided
that any reserved names
are not used by their Teamworks the
phones and narratives however cannot be
released on any other type license sense
and the requirement for funds to remain
and it's nice it's not going to apply to
any documents creative using the files
of generations which also makes sense so
basically I can do whatever I want with
the fonts
because it's open for license
that's for a Grand Hotel by but
what are the reality as the Apache
Apache
license
[Music]
which has a lot of text
[Music]
to copyright a place of the Year place
all the name of corporate the whole
thing I think someone did not fill this
out correctly according to all the
corporate laws in some countries that
would make the corporate invalid and
it's in public domain but that's not
active anymore as far as I've understood
because that's not linear you can't
really say oh you made a mistake it's
not subject domain that's not a family
of DNA
[Music]
foreign
that's it
you may you should reproduce and use
your copies of the work and tell you
some work there of an enemy with some
efficient and such
must give any of his opportunity was a
copy of this license and you must plan
them
yeah
I'll see if I can make it very much
can't Stein is not right
oh that's the one
yes
incest I could write it like in lower
case even though that one is such reason
s
no
[Music]
so I want the
that scene
[Music]
and
foreign
both sides
what are the modifications
uh when you do this one
but this one has a slides outline making
it a bit easy to read oh that one is
against a teal bag and that's funny
this is good
picture
and and nothing princess with stretched
okay so so
I want to stretch out the height of it
same thing again
[Music]
and I think
yeah that's my lucky
that's more likely
and what do you think about that
I would like a captain P but I also
would like this thing
and so what I will do
the following
I'll take this make a copy of it
add a capital P in front of the p
[Music]
oops
and then
I will convert it to shape I don't know
much distance
I was hoping to
no that's the P connectivity it's not
the r connecting
interesting
the orange to the same
it doesn't matter I I want this
I'm gonna want to scare you can see
[Music]
all right no all right
I only wanted to leave these points not
the whole team
[Music]
oh
yeah
that's not gonna say
what are you looking for is silly Parker
okay this one doesn't ruin anything I
probably have to use like
I'm gonna have to see or something
[Music]
hey you know that's how I spelled nope
and our Dash makes the first a short a
but it must be long
it's a short a to a long a
this is my nuggets
like team barking anything exactly
that's so Hispanics
laughs
can you stop deleting the wrong point
I'm trying to knit this point
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I didn't know how I would connect these
two little things
and then do you want them connected
foreign
[Music]
instead
that I want to be generated to you
foreign
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and I'm not neat
[Music]
hello taster
semicolon lp0 that's some pretty message
you have there it's oops dropped my
phone
more excuses on the phones or anything
exactness because it's this
now
[Music]
let me check the other one you know I
got a much more confusing it's nice and
slow
uh yellow team was that small coin yeah
no thanks regular
nah yes and no
some aspects I think that
to my parents
[Music]
right at Grand Hotel
like
[Music]
yep blame all the petals
yeah I play my phone I can't get this p
deepness
[Music]
[Music]
so let's add
um
outline
[Music]
like that
but then I want to add
which this one has
oh it's it's that that's the way
there we go that's what it looks like
and if I save this now and take a look
at the tips
it should be easier to read a little bit
plain like this
there we go
this is still kind of big text but
her name is good I'm glad you think so
foreign
yeah it's turned out nicer than I
thought it would be I said I was going
to strike a bit more with me but I guess
the PNR it's
but oh well I guess they just have to
look like that
it is what it is
I can do one more thing
because currently it's the
dark pink
color of it
but I can add a
grainy and across it
I saw it
and
and it did not
do it as I expected it but
that was interesting
let me just apply it
straight to it like this yeah there you
go that's whatever
now let's see
a gradient right and then I can know
what the effect of the Grain in fact if
it's too strong but a green it might
make the text
a bit more visually interesting
Boop yeah there we go that's definitely
more interesting
it's worth it
oh okay I'm wearing a cocoa benefit
that's already on the list
and gave you the list of outfits I'm
going to make
and it's it's like
peace yet
Princess pumpkin hello like this this is
pizza from putting on her princess
swimsuit
and um yeah I need a difference
yes this is at least
it's still doing that
the list campaigns multiple outfits and
I can I guess
the list the list
perfect they're going to be a pink dress
today we'll dress that one for normally
wears
and the uh I'm funny costume because
Coco has the Unicorn outfit it's like a
you can call it one C
bangis
a very thick poofy that's how to
describe it but as a bunny instead
because it will be funny if up anywhere
the sports player that ponpon has then
one based on Coco Coco's outfit
and the swimsuit that I'm doing now and
then I'm going to do a bikini
because people probably want that
uh
like a
traditional
stereotypical maybe a Japanese
schoolgirl outfit
mermaid's dress
cheerleader outfit which is based on
this email that I made
and the
then the is the skin suits which I
already made
there oh now it's wait why is it showing
wrong is that accident the same already
let me quickly correct that
that's the wrong picture
[Music]
yeah did I I might have said that would
be
uh
and uh
[Music]
and update there we go that's what it
should look like
so this one I ordered the mate
that's the first one I did today
I'm going to the princess and dress and
from the other
accessories like a crown
probably
doing some
I'm not sure exactly how to describe it
into tribal outfit I don't know that
right and vegetation based outfit was
cutting Spaceman drawing
the balloon which is just cocoa
Christmas available which has special
this animation that
uh as uh where the balloon blows up
I will keep that but make the balloon
because that's just how the key works
um probably not too much about that
[Music]
and some hula girl
and then we mentioned before the
Playbook Playboy bunny
outfit yeah black leotards
and an evil ponton
attack of hispanion
species a fake pumpkin which is based on
like fake cocoa and crash
just for fun and a low poly
version
like this version of Google
and then I would try to do the similar
bandages
and other stuff that
this is a version of that for Coco is
fun
see if I can make them work
and then the underwear only version
which I already done as well
I don't know about he underwear without
body there you go that's the body
and finally the skeleton which I have
in the works here
[Music]
all right
okay it's not reading the correct
texture but
yes and that's all the outfits it
actually is ah
he did say underwear ugly so it was well
it was a bow too
technically anywhere only one in the
other one sure
so that's the least this
three more outfits
there's one based on water bunny which
is going to be his outfit
then
I haven't asked the other two streams
yet if I can use them
and I'm not sure if I'm mentioned it on
stream yet but maybe I shouldn't mention
it
for now
no
if I mentioned this before yeah
what's what's done is done with out of
respect I guess I don't know
maybe I shouldn't mention it until they
have given me an answer
seems like they the right thing today
but it's going to be two other streamers
you can probably guess which one of them
is going to be anyway in this
yeah it doesn't say anything else
information is given if even yeah I mean
if if I'm not giving any permission I
guess I could say it like oh smile
otherwise what else am I going to say
[Music]
[Music]
even though it's quite obvious
um
that I'm trying to look at and ready
ring scale
feels like
that I think
because it doesn't go too low
down there
it's kinda
okay yeah let's get this early
duplicate that stop right I can get the
specific object
to work on
the mirror
yeah as as I'm working on this uh there
will be a lot of
the use of her butt
I hope that's not a problem
look out that far down yeah I think
that's fine
okay but among other things
but crunch
and more funny stuff
without me being on the inside
I need this point here between
[Music]
wait a minute
yeah should probably just
okay and
I'm going to make a duplicate of this
part only Jesus there guide
while I work
so I don't have
foreign
obscuring everything
[Music]
oh now it's giving me a countdown I
don't think it just adds
I mean
and I don't like why doesn't the ads are
coming message show up for mods that's
something
and yeah
oh no she lost all her limbs yep
you're telling me
one two three four one six seven
let's say eight seven adds Circle
and then at 76 in
[Music]
and then expand
[Music]
[Music]
hey right back
it's
[Music]
thank you
Sanskrit
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
now
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
obviously
I have that
it's obvious when you're working with
this too
[Music]
foreign
division
[Music]
so if I
do subdivides
[Music]
that's
[ __ ]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
all right
speak okay I think
[Music]
uh what do you mean specs
and trying to find a good shape of this
[Music]
yeah I'm like
being something that's pretty
okay he touched the princess
it doesn't make me too much
[Music]
does it does it is it good like this
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
let's see
that's my test when I went
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
so let's export Evie
it's temporary uni
adding difference yeah
[Music]
and that should be the last thing and
then the swimsuit should be done
yay
it's like a what do you call this
that's a mannequin here again
that's what it is America
that's only showing your body a lot like
your legs or arms
so
no not that soon
so let's
but yeah I'm Keen
mommy can I send this message
not more than random strange ones but
thanks
[Music]
so there's
yes
there's nothing I mean aside from table
that's really shows and it's funny
but I guess there is the tail is the
chest that is a bunny
thank you
it should be green or
Tio as someone call this corn
all this corner
and now
so now I've seen this
show show up as well
back here
but now it's using the electric shape
so all I need now is
[Music]
on the other side
and
other side of north side should be the
same
this might actually not be a good idea
now it's
take care of that
[Music]
I don't know what kind of shoes
because I want to cut it at different
locations
[Music]
so let's go back again more experience
it
here we go
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
no
only
one yeah
but
there's enough
[Music]
it is close
when I asked what is this thing
like they try to point at the the brown
and Bunny over there and I was like
trying to ask about a decent Arabic
speak it says the boonie
it is brown
oh bunny okay
[Music]
is this certainly what happened when I
came up with the red bunnies
I think that's called folk etymology
when people make up their own etymology
that is not today when it was alone
and
[Music]
so there's a little league baseball game
on TV and one of the team is from
Portugal just showed an introduction to
the team and they were speaking
Portuguese and so I understood me
in reality it was just English with a
heavy proteins nice
I believe they speak what it means
[Music]
yeah it's gonna
probably to be able to
understand a different language due to
the similarity of language
I like
I mentioned that I
understand some Norwegian
thanks see the same like this big smooch
bonus word for bunny is really cheap
I can understand shaking cream I didn't
hear you like this song
creating your practice now
I mean obviously it's your body's helps
but it's not like it completely unaware
Chinese
but if I have options also trying to
land
and only turn myself
thank you
and let's see
oh [ __ ]
that's like these
and this solid
so
that means I should be no not in their
own way
and
[Music]
it's winter time has been like twice
yeah
it's going to be nice when it's
automatic so you can redeem it and just
switch it over
and I don't have to press a single
button
would be nice
and then you can redeem this and then
that's that's why I have the timer on
the
on the redeems because uh
yeah
I I of course I can't set every outfit
to have
and I'm very sadness and even at the
same time
completely
that's why it was just
you couldn't
that's why I had a suggestion why
twitch whoops
to group redeems together
and then you can because with some
streamers there's a lot of for example
sound effects that cost the same price
so you could have like a group with
those sound effects where everything
goes in scene same thing
[Music]
and then you could also have it so when
you Dim something from this group
the whole group has a countdown instead
[Music]
there we go
now it's okay
[Music]
and now I can
it's gonna be we're doing a jet ski
level and you have to try to get this
proper friend to what you want to bring
a suit
I mean there is no jet ski levels in
that game sadly I wish they were but
there is none
[Music]
no music level
[Music]
that's unfortunate
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
yeah let's see
well anyway responding to watch anything
we do yeah
it is
she lands in the water with her swimsuit
oh no but that's what you've been on fun
fun
[Music]
thank you
my name is the correct way
[Music]
everything
[Music]
yes
I don't see me
no it was great
see you there again
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
at least another topping is
bring it
and then I need to be conservative but
space I got plenty of it
okay spaghetti
transforming into a fair instead of a
spaghetti to test the rabbits that's why
rabbit shouldn't eat spaghetti
laughs
don't give spaghetti to bunnies because
they turn feral
I mean aren't bun is already Fair
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
that's the
now it should applied all sides
Underside other side
but across the other side we could add
like
[Music]
so it makes sense
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
like that
[Music]
no no I'm missing line that's annoys me
yes not domesticated bunnies Okay so if
you give spaghetti to it don't miss the
kids because I'm Wild Honey
keep that's pretty wide
[Music]
okay now
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
this thing should have like
being irrational
somehow
[Music]
so
um
oh there's some basically done with
everything I could
do those other textures
so the FC
[Music]
the shadow should not be included
[Music]
foreign
hydrated yes and I'm out of
and out of something
right
when am I in this one and then
I'm supposed to be here and then
those
then again tests
what I want
and same thing with bow
and it's a fight
against princess prince
um
I will make something like that that
makes it easy
this
FC
done
I think I need this one already here
it does need me
rinse team
[Music]
don't have any more water well it was
juice buttons
we fill it up but then I have to leave
the computer
I guess you can do that because I wanted
to see if I could generate
the
enormous points always
um
I didn't have to like not manual
nice this one like that
like inside
snooze but it doesn't change
[Music]
now it is
[Music]
more advancing yep
I love the butts
when I'm working on this scene
and there will be a lot of butts while I
play the game as well because the camera
is going to behind her
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
second thing
the highest solution of
[Music]
the things
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
well they know
um
[Music]
there's a weird thing to I added
yesterday
can't say
happy birthday
I'm really trying to sing just do this
[Music]
I think it's
it's classy spirit
I mean experience with friends were made
of clothing so much
class
should I don't same thing would do much
damage
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
if they were action spikes
[Music]
[Music]
okay can I split
[Music]
can I
have extension
then there's plates for kids
when you split the vertex
thank you
ah so
that's what I did it okay
nicely
yes this is what I'm looking for magic
ones
can't have a tea coming in can we
of course
teaching I actually want it
nope
can't do that
it's cold in here oh
and
Channel
uh Awards the candle whatever that's
gonna use
this should hopefully
yeah everything design results
or something clear State at least
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
and everything
else
that's hard it's just so many steps you
know me
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
foreign
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and add
fine so an image
there we go
new
and this resolution of the texture
working with
and
okay
it's always on Titan that's manic here
we go
[Music]
okay okay
that one's in the minus
Institution
since
it's a good question I got to say
it's apparently disabled
[Music]
okay
and
um
[Music]
that should probably find
there we go
you don't want to pick that one saying
before until the end it because you
never know
if he does something weird like you
protect me which is done the importance
is the more red orange is selected with
them with yellow orange
I don't think that's that
[Music]
there we go there's the
extra bake at the top middle of the
screen while I'm looking for yourself or
something
systems
and I'm here I mean I'm going to get
myself some cheese
and then
I think it's a bad thing that
that's basically sometimes on the Nancy
adding the beads yeah
[Music]
think well I know there are two things
one they support the yellow of the sun
is Twitch picks
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
foreign
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
put the mushroom closer
who is it okay is it done it seems to be
done
how does it look it looks like this
they are saying bad I do like that let's
save it as
and
normal
swim
doesn't matter what's it called because
I'm not gonna keep defining
yeah
but sometimes tendency
[Music]
[Music]
and now I'm next
oh yeah you're back in yay you're back
again
if you miss me
[Music]
and at normals mean
there it is
because I don't need oh
they're stressed little thing I don't
need
him
[Music]
perfect
oh it's nice
I need a place of course again Mustang
that's this one is great
wait what's why is this one like this
maintenance system
now it must be shifted to the side
oh yeah wait how is she decided
this one must be shipped their size or
something
[Music]
this one is fine
there we go this makes more sense
music
it's nice to hear that I'm being wanted
there's some interesting music
[Music]
that's nice then I secretary
that I miss most of it because
you want to hear it again
I can actually listen to it while it was
playing
this again
it kind of needs answer
[Music]
so if I save this
is quite nice maybe
[Music]
now again that takes you
and
switch to
all right and then we update oh it loves
this there we go
looking like perfect but
[Music]
good
public speaking games
mirror
apply
foreign
and I think that's it
I'm sorry I'm not even sure what I mean
there we go this is what it looks like
so it's not perfect but yeah I think
it's good
yeah let's let's see everything yeah I
forgot to switch for you but yes
this is our next really nice scene thank
you we've got a lot of everything
because I'm happy
swimsuit
and it's got one litender
it's not that you follow me
the body you know when it comes to
animations
it got in groups but it should not be
certain things
it wouldn't even animate Investments
that has to be corrected
data transferring a classic tune
vertex groups
that are the nearest
base interpolated generate
apply
now make my world of empty ones so
wait clean
one groups thank you let me make it
foreign
[Music]
which is important
but theme
you got a rigid exactly maybe it's one
second
there's a hold for the team
and I
put some straps it says princess on the
back it got some pretty sides about the
rainbow across the front
he got some seams on the sides
[Music]
big name on the original swimsuits
like good luck David
if you like to show show how that weapon
and we can see that see if that looks
because we don't really see the back
side of Bonbon swimsuit
so
we could just take a quick look at
how it would look if you would be
applying the same thing as is not hot
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
behind
the rainbow should blade at top of the
rainbow because
we follow those guys
[Music]
but we didn't see our straps
and the straps are purple
[Music]
that's one signed
not being away
to the other side
Supermarket tattoo and anyway
let's give me a single tape
is not one to the land on top of the
rainbow
and then
this is
now you need no color because for
uh but it has a color history so you can
pick the color somewhere else and so
this would be like that
yeah so it's black on the back nice
acrylic paint and there's Steel on the
back
and
like my sister bearing
so this is what it actually looks like
on this swimsuit
teaching
yeah
I'm gonna have to take it
and boom
this is and the steps are until
something real swimsuit but
I do prefer is purple to be honest
too much in TV please
[Music]
foreign
I mean honestly do you like
the team color
if you didn't even know in this color I
can go with it
do you like it well I don't like it as
much as the purple that
it's not bad but um
and then perfectly but I mean it doesn't
have to be what I like I mean both are
fine
team
that's the attention to detained
[Music]
hello I'm here
class today at work
hello what do you think about this music
it's based on the real swimsuits which
is a see your backside
do you like the tail back side or do you
prefer it purple
it's really cute
and I'm happy being done with
yeah I do prefer it to purple that I can
seem like same same
yeah
could have the rainbow still
like ends at the scene
if that makes sense and not like
continue across the scene
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
purple bag makes it feels thinner open
exactly
and you're going to see her from the
back anyway
[Music]
but purple works too it matches the
overall design also yeah I think I think
it's like a more consistent design
foreign
[Music]
but yeah
I I don't mind either way
yeah
it's important to screen stands out of
course
look at the deep down in the trails
obviously the actual Balkans aren't that
eating but
and that's what you get me done on
mapping
[Music]
I'm a player any of the options
I like it do you like it when
when it by signs separate like that I'm
fine I'm fine with that that says
princess on the back
detail this way I think Mr is supposed
to be attached a smiling
and that's the details I put
[Music]
it's finally cute
there they go that's the same seats
of course you have them both as well
[Music]
swing set and
I should do the
skeleton as you're completed as well
finally start on it
mine technically it's been six hours
it's seven minutes but doesn't mean I
have to stop at that point
celebration
[Music]
okay let's see yes skeleton is just gone
cold skeleton like meeting
skeleton
that would be skeleton
and it's that much it will be under my
first skeleton
and
maybe Noble
and then the body generally now I should
have stuck with the ring instruction
[Music]
moving this um here
so
what I had
okay let's see okay
it's the skeleton cute
little kitten
[Music]
opening document
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
don't need to move
some of this stuff around
I can fit in
[Music]
yeah on the way somewhere
[Music]
hey kitten yeah I went down
so why is the plan with the skeleton
what I need to enter the texture for
underwear thing
that's the plan
so
this party
I mean only one anymore
so let's call it fold underway
duplicate things over there
[Music]
uh yeah because it's good
it's gonna turn and the other one has
been the same
and then I delete everything I don't
need I'm not going to have the bow right
bow will be burned up
I would assume
[Music]
[Music]
this one is
[Music]
so oh
I just need to know where to place the
underwear
on this whole thing
[Music]
it's a lot of stuff
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
because I got a lot of free space
[Music]
it's like if I take this one
[Music]
[Music]
okay and finish this new again
[Music]
because
um
[Music]
do you have to move this stuff around
well I could save this as uh
what I'm saying
skeleton
tough skills
sun is now
[Music]
well I should enable this back to
anything
[Music]
security transparency
and as you say what transparency but
and now
[Music]
because oh it doesn't show up the screen
got two
we've only got this one set but I can
switch that one to the one I'm actually
going to use
[Music]
which is this one
but um
that means that it should show up here
though
which is but I'm off there
[Music]
this means that I can move this thing
[Music]
when we're on the heads I mean there is
something that's an idea to but it
doesn't wouldn't work when you get
electrocuted better as a costume you
better
um your panties on her head
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
now I started our left
so
don't need to move 1464
around 60. that's its new location
did this one ended up doesn't matter
I'm not thinking I'm laughing now of
course not you forget to cover the
texture
sink
yeah
can't jump on fit in the top left up
there
I mean I guess you're correct about that
probably remember it's up there
let's see
yeah it does sweet actually okay
let's bring up the notes
now it's gonna go in the other direction
there's six seven six
let's move it
15 16.
I mean these ones could be moved up into
the corner very small
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so I
can't we'll just move this one
[Music]
wait is that a
2072 that way
one five six seven six that way
sure that means that I can't move this
closer
10 inch
[Music]
two texture Maps what do you mean
foreign
[Music]
I wish you the best
and what I mean I see you working on two
different layouts yes this
here is the actual texture
and that's the end results and this
thing I'm working on here is where this
stuff will be placed where the mesh will
read from
and
and so what I can do is
go here
uh
save this one again that's got some nice
savings
done
and now I can update this one and I'll
but I cannot see the analysis but it's
not being a next one is here and now
they are nice
yeah it's just this one will be
I'm off today it requires me to update
if I made something but
this one on I'm actively working on
since there are two separate programs I
missed you know it's side by side on the
Stream
for the convenience
[Music]
and for meeting
do you think
so I don't have to
switch View
back and forth
so you can see both as good as possible
I guess it's okay
now if you put the spine back next to
this ball with the boy shirt
right
now if you put the spine back next to
the skull with the boy shots fit in your
space there
or even here yeah
it would probably actually sit there
seems like an incision too
[Music]
[Music]
wait for me
[Music]
let me ask you a demise
and
okay let's try to understanding
two steps
there you go
so
let me know this woman
oh my goodness
I deleted number anything
I can undo foreign
make sure I put
would be able to beat them here inside
thanks
back East to the previous location
[Music]
well
he has a pen
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
yeah that never mind
this thing back just kind of outside of
you on the stream but maybe good all
right behind something there you go nice
and then I'll put the punches down
[Music]
big boy shorts but again
[Music]
not exactly why then there's the term
Point short setting
because I guess there are shorts like
but they are not like meant for boys to
wear
[Music]
to be called yarn shorts exactly or the
you know panty shorts
and the Swedish term is same one
translated to boxer panties which makes
sense as a thing
[Music]
[Music]
when
United States
[Music]
you need to cut off this part
[Music]
can I
I want these objects that existence on
it
well
I'll be too far down
[Music]
so
in that case
I'll go to these two
of them
and then I'm just moving
anyway
[Music]
so
and then
box it too so that would be nice
[Music]
so now I can just go back to you
normally I guess
okay
I need to see the design
C goes here
[Music]
[Music]
and this other
pose one invisible two just significant
difference between these two
[Music]
and then that
done that
this one here
give this together
[Music]
you know this one
and bouncing
[Music]
thank you
and this is
and you can create them yes seven year
which assist
[Music]
and then there's n
[Music]
and this one I forgot to select things
and I didn't
put them in here I have to do that
manually
bones t
[Music]
and finally all right
this empty folder anymore
um swarmed
balance team
looks like it did not renaming things
foreign
[Music]
now if I save this
skeleton
power to blending
up take this now things like this
that's what the skeleton should be using
now so now this thing is gone
this underwear should be using
built on as well
let's do one at a time
there we go now they're actually meaning
of this texture
so we can call this spot upon anatom
body
instead of just
and this is
skeleton skeletons
[Music]
I'm skeleton bra
and put up on the skeleton black shirts
it looks too I know it's in her
underneath it has her underwear showing
[Music]
so
as I said there's a technical difference
between bones one and two and that is
because one have some overlapping bones
which Bones two down there
transparent
so I see so I can still see where they
are let's see which and then I can
analyze both like here they're
overlapping
so I can take this bone
yes
and then just move it away so you know
lower overlaps
[Music]
which means this one
because in the original they do overlap
and potato
yeah yeah they do overlaps I have
recreated the part that was overlapping
we should prefer hopefully create
slightly better texture
me
me my initial cleanup it's a bit too
hard to do I just place it down here
[Music]
it kind of understand it
[Music]
[Music]
so
oh
[Music]
but I preferably should only move them
in steps by eight because that's what
the compression is working
[Music]
so that means that now yeah
yeah so now if only it's 10 minus 10 10
minus 10 is 16 cents
[Music]
right
well I've got a tight apparently
[Music]
I guess
[Music]
and then I should maybe spell
that amount
yeah
that's how I switch in that's the other
condition
apparently this whole thing is opened up
a lot of balancing
this sourcing just has to be moved up
not by much
then it would overlap
yeah because she found
Pearl which is respond it's a great
email
is one of the best emotes on a plane
never need to balance that same thing
because I only need to maybe that's
slightly
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
and now
there's another
this bone
itself
it shouldn't be part of Bones too anyway
it could be moved up
now I think it needs to be completely
different please
actually
let's play it over here
[Music]
all right hot scenes on my hand clicking
um
I thought she usually was blushing about
it
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
that
it's nice my spoon
wait
what
ah
foreign
I'm traveling I should be able to
[Music]
generate
Bishop put it in from smiling
[Music]
oh no
foreign
[Music]
it's kind of melting
that's a horror movies here
so the computer is struggling but I'm
mostly because of the ones what I mean
don't be streaming at night I think
[Music]
that would help them
big enough
so what's that I think that sold let her
know this bonus overlapping Less in the
backs that one has to be moved that way
problem
s
maybe there
that was all on now
yeah it's all up there
that would have slightly there but it's
still overlapping
yeah no Damian is back did you find
anything interesting
[Music]
I wanted him to ask
would you almost listen to The Bunny
better
I said I do want I would like that that
message to be
customized super easy
[Music]
okay that's not yeah
okay
I mean there's space I think it is
[Music]
there we go that's uh their substance
flights
let's see
foreign
[Music]
I mean this is
[Music]
[Music]
it's funny
you don't have to be
perfectly
[Music]
all right and then I mean this one
to that that section
that that lights definitely
so
I think that's that
I know oh nothing
there is plenty of space yeah so this
one can just
move up a bit
yeah that's all I needed
I think that's it
mine is
stupid things over that
foreign
[Music]
well
now I'm in these
[Music]
nuts
making them
[Music]
transparent Destiny make it hot tea
don't need to take transparents
foreign
stuff
all right
but I should have brought these with me
now
I'm hanging it's popcorn
the best food foreign
foreign
string but like I ate right at the start
of the stream because I
yeah not a Burger King
now
let's select all of these things
so that's that
[Music]
this one
the this one
and these things
[Music]
so now I should not be held at me
anymore
it's tight end up with these buildings
it's mixed
with picky
all right
same same
now
I don't think there's any more you're
not like important that would happen
empty space
I didn't get anything today why is that
are you losing weight
machines are possibility is fine
activity
so I'm gonna save this as C
and therefore I can look at this here
after this and then
now it is
but anyway yes
foreign
[Music]
which is nothing
but
[Music]
um
quiet Exchange
D and
and finally our our because it's a
skeleton you know yeah
so
I'm going back to this video again
now I change
look like this anytime you say it either
today maybe I'll be away for dinner
tonight and I'll eat then or maybe
you'll
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yeah yeah I hope you
[Music]
you get enough food
[Music]
there you go
now it even has the normal opening I've
seen so it is it's nice
but you didn't know it's gonna buy
anything like that but anyway these are
in the old one
[Music]
let me switch over
there we go
now we've got seams and everything
it's beautiful
but I didn't say that on the execution
was she probably removed the ears this
is the so this could be the scheme
you're playing as so the ears are here
so when they they cut since everything
you see the Indians
you're right I don't think there's
anything more to this
Electro skeleton
ears are here and ready to hear
nice
yeah
um for the electro skeleton
I'll duplicate these
pattern here
and then I will
[Music]
which technically is a separate scheme
but
since they're only going to do a slight
modification too okay I think I would
count it
and
I like that like there's something that
I need to work on
which are the ears
which are this this one select that
[Music]
it leaves a hole in the head like this
[Music]
but
um
match
[Music]
everyone's welcome this enemies
I was thinking
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
laughs
my son has analogy
no I didn't squish the head I used
[Music]
when
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
oh
my God
[Music]
of course
I get a fidget
s
[Music]
laughs
fluffy yes
now we want some awkward
and nice
15.
[Music]
let's just
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
now I see there
you go
100 yes that's yeah
I love hydraulics
oh yeah happy
yay you are happy
[Music]
elimination
[Music]
[Music]
and I didn't want to see point five six
[Music]
thanks
and then I do
this here
to
the nature release if you wanted
something
new
because this this one and there's zero
one one yeah
you wanna
yes
[Music]
all right
[Music]
nice a bit easier to watch
Maybe
I think I have a bit too much like that
you got a track voice
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
so much celebration
[Music]
and
match my distance
yep
then I guess I missed is similar here
want to see what's fine
or ct1 signals
[Music]
I guess these are lights Maybe
Let's Stay Fly funny
and then start shooting nothing
this one is fine
and this thing
to
wow
I guess
I guess
it is like that
is it important how it looks because
it's going to be hard to see how it
looks anyway whatever yeah I want some
roughly nicely
[Music]
yeah trying to stay warm
I hope you
have
our succeeding one
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
nothing
[Music]
like keeping well you should you should
drink some hot chocolate
[Music]
I love cigarettes
thank you
I saw that when I was living in hot
place
was with this shivering
this doesn't make any sense
foreign
[Music]
do that
[Music]
there we go
not perfect but it's it's okay
[Music]
since then
it takes this song from inside it's
important
because now
during the just specifically execution
the ears are not going to cover the body
and I don't think unless someone watches
the vote for this I remember it anyways
I don't think
and it's going to be not small
famous One
but yes I'm good
news
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
my assistant
called skeleton
skeleton
Summit
it's electrocation because if I'm going
to do the Cocker spani version of poem
that's going to have different ears
so not having es is part of the
execution makes sense because that skin
is also going to be really cute as I
said the in-ear student execution is
going to cover such body
it's nicer too we can see detracting
without the ears coming
the videos are not going to be
see-through but if you're playing it as
a skin
fine fine
yeah
[Music]
that's good I'll add the organs that
would be something internal organs
[Music]
I will be some crazy YouTube
[Music]
2018
so
this is why I wanted tops of hair to
also exist on any First Step at least
that one makes sense so
I guess the skeleton is done
in Wisconsin with the ears
this swimsuit
and skin seed
and I've been one hour ago kinda I think
I'm done here I will like I guess I put
them into the game off stream I don't
think that's the cycling point
it's quite repetitive
this guy is connecting
[Music]
uh I forgot the list yeah who needs the
rest of noise
what's up
[Music]
that's all you need
Plus
one down
a black belt without purple so these two
ones in the ones are actually names for
it
so everyone has problem ordering the
only
sports server so
I have all the Discord servers
and
on the roles Channel you go there there
you can set me where you did I already
gonna set the
yeah which alert and YouTube alert is
also now an outfit alert you can just
click on that
then when I create a new thread for an
outfit
um I will alert everyone with a cockpit
alert and post the pictures of the
outfit from different angles
thing
but anyway we have a picture from behind
so there will be a picture of it's about
to give you
and then people just can come up with
different ideas for names without it
and then after
we got the number of ideas or names
we hold a vote
Jeff buttons
I mean I guess I could include like this
but it's not like important details
about how to emails I guess
like a picture on the front
on the back
another place
um and sign I guess
I guess that's that
sounds good I hope
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so
sounds good but uh where are we talking
about again thinking about team
so
you since I've been I said going one
hour over time this time I'm assuming
says four hours that because I restarted
the timer halfway through the stream
which was three hours which was four
hours ago but it was three hours into
the Stream
so
and his staff shoes starting a stream or
is she only on BRB
because that would be a great
opportunity to you know read that she a
few months ago
too long ago
and then what's the clock I mean it's
nice
where is the time
there you go five minutes yeah she just
started this thing even
your reception as she starts to stream
[Music]
see you later
[Music]
message
so
but I don't know when she will start
tonight
and it's like five minutes over
and it's not time now screening it's
just waiting to start
waiting to think that
so in the meantime
[Music]
I do have other things like
socials what is CVS right here
which is the patreon where I get a money
from beauty this course server where I
we can chat about stuff YouTube channel
but I'll upload YouTube videos such as
the mods and whatnot but I will post a
video
I heard someone
yeah this team has started let's go
[Music]
she is going to play
Jurassic world evolution 2.
was that something
she's really nice
so
it's going to be a fun surprise
but I don't have anything much to say so
[Music]
I guess when she's saying she seems I'm
gonna do it
so be ready for around random at any
moment
and
[Music]
guess she's gonna see the intro at the
moment
you know and I really think of the intro
is it
[Music]
so
[Music]
I think animals
yeah I don't know anything so everyone
else in my channel she's switching scene
let's go
time today's date now
come on Twitch
