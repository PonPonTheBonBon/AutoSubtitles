apparently M up the cable here give me a
moment
whoa is it going to stay on the screen
there you go
elect Electronic Arts did not sound
like did not sounded sound like
electronic
carts
DSi Nostalgia been while since I heard
that PS1
started Delphine software
International here you go languages this
is one of the few games that has Swedish
language but I think English sounds like
a good
[Music]
option it's the spider Scorpio form
scorp great try out bunch
of
emojis my most start reset again I don't
know why reset is like
that
is is it almost like there should be
music
here em I thought it was motor racer now
it's em
now whoa
he what options do I
have okay H I wanted
to okay I I Cann cannot set make the
controls so I can use analog controls
not actually there's
one setting I should
change and that is that I want to use to
Racing
controls
there see
I can change how the input works so one
player I don't have more players now the
question is here this game can be quite
tricky but I don't know if I can unlock
everything playing
medium I guess I guess I can try
youre let's do the
championship
yeah
so
this is a
music double check when I set the
controls
[Music]
to
[Music]
um where
is where am I looking
for did yeah so yeah so the controller
should basically flip the right stick
and
the let's
save but not polish now the very R you
will find a Polish Game hello
moto Tak now it
one so apparently in the preview picture
here I don't know how well it shows up
on screen there is a tiny white Arrow if
I understood correctly that was a
feature that existed in
the the Prototype of the game but they
remove
that
so got a lot of
them let's go with
this they didn't go down here so this
is what I want to have cuz is it's more
of an arcade
racer yeah select config config zero the
programmers making the game yeah let's
go to automatic I
need mess around with the
gearbot let's go let's
go I remember having a game where you
raced on motorcycles but you also had
weapons like chains and crowbars with
which she attacked other races PS1 game
forget what it was called oh and feel
where F have the cops over his team I
know the game it was Road Rash rage as
it was on Sega me
Genesis wait how do I explain no I
thought I change the
controls what let
me let me double check that yeah Chang
the controls why isn't it R man
controls it does not oh do I have to
restart the
game why is this why this messing with
me I just want to I just wanted to
play let me double
shake let me D Shake yeah it should use
that one why isn't
it why isn't it using
it
so let's go
back I picked one that had he
yeah one more try one more
try yes that's it I now
oh I got a gift sub from
oh Miss Kitty
Coy M kid is
streaming I haven't read turn
sometime okay now it's
working then I can do
that because in arade you
you you of course have to what do you
call it
the game G gave me the name before but I
forgot about it they call it stunt and
uh something
more what's more and you lose so it
definitely speeds up but you lose the
steering wa what a rock Rocket
Man where is he I'm flying through the
race like a rocket
[Music]
when when the music is so much louder
than the the oh bouncing up everything
yeah hard is going I mean this is just
[Music]
medium so hard is going to be even
trickier if I have to too hard and it
has checkpoints too which adds to the
timer what ah come
on just Dy me 240
250 up to
300 really breaking for him okay bounce
of the
[Music]
wall well that didn't me
to okay so press down that's three of
you okay cuz I don't don't have any
mirrors on the
bike
[Music]
danger yeah I'm not winning this I'm in
third position do I have to
win it was a long time ago I played this
game so I don't remember there any
scoring system or you have to win or
something to proceed cuz it's an arcade
it's not like like
[Music]
realistic I want
[Music]
press quicker Tock lower but that's not
a
function go I'm slowly catching
up no
no yeah you to be quite
perfect yeah bouncing too
much
[Music]
to let me get side position
[Music]
no yeah I
did
it continue race fourth
position as I said before my most us Le
got reset so now I need to organize it
again and twitch should have like you
can so you can favor it or
[Music]
something but oh right you got this
one different
popcorn
but by the time you finish the game
medium Bo and hard boies yeah I mean
you're
right okay let's let's be a
rocket I should not have done that I got
take
oh
[Music]
[Music]
CL checkpoint checkpoint whoa what a
rocket yeah music is very
loud don't hear what I'm saying let say
just the checkpoint all the
time yeah I'm not doing so much better
here this is supposed to be
[Music]
medium yeah that that's
fail like everything is like to or is
this sound I do that but
let let's see how it
goes not that I need to hear the voices
but go
[Music]
about the one more time he only a rocket
that here he could give you advice on
how you think how do you sink like a
rocket how my
rocket exactly I need
who some immediate
crashes at least this game doesn't have
any deaths or injuries
r
who what a rock waa what a
[Music]
rocket no I was doing so
good these RS are quite wide
[Music]
too okay
[Music]
I really hope I
can they could actually complete the
game on medium and doesn't require me to
do
hard because hard scares me at the
moment going to be a need speed moment
where I have to give up on the final
championship where everyone's
cheating is the sports way working yes
it is good no oh everyone's
crashing hey they're cheating they're
resetting further ahead but then
accelerating B this should be the the
bike that accelate the
best it just that one less in top
speed I don't need I just need to not
bounce off the
[Music]
walls everyone was
crashing
W the steings
worse doing
that then I got the good steering back I
wasn't prepared
[Music]
me final final that get out of the
way
got Force position maybe I need a po
po what do you call
it I know the Swedish word
that's that the top three basically
that's that was looking
[Music]
way
complete okay maybe a second place
works okay in that
case
oh what a nice
gift p position no that's the first
position that's
wasn't right
pus is in the first place or am I
wrong full hour of bunny tell me outfit
Works
W with PES are naturally bouncy okay so
second place does count maybe maybe they
don't care let's let's
see
let's see but very kind of you me but
the number of Subs I had I had like 35
34 a few days ago and then it just
dropped done down down down to 10 11
like last stream it was 11 so dropped be
35 to
11 well done and your
name okay what is my
name my name is
e
okay o
and now to dirt Arena now we going to do
maybe I should save I don't
know here we go here they actually show
you the unlock that's that's actually
good wait what what do they mean with oh
is it because I'm doing Championship one
player cuz that's how you speak right
one
player so four tracks and two modes to
unlock well and also this is save Z
because this game just calls everything
the first slot is
z Oh those subs fell out drastically Yep
this all of them disappeared and never
got the
50 I never got the 50
final because I get carrot coins but why
does it have to be specific
510 Al so this is the equivalent dirt
bik of the one I used but this one has
one less grip and one more break this is
the one that has equivalent
stats they call it turbo and St turbo
stunt let's do a turbo
stunt
or maybe it's turo and
St because you need carrot
coins 2 one
go W yeah there St oh that's
not that's not time you okay let's
restart as the player I have
the I have the command of the race and
they say well that's that that's where
the restart okay can I at least get do
this first segment before I
crash 5 10 because that's how much the
option I game oh
interesting but I mean if it's all about
giving could just one pit be enough I
mean I appreciate more
but yeah I have no idea what the guy
says
there I do know about that waa why
rocket but whatever oh look an ice cream
pink ice cream
who me he not getting bonus points from
tricking
it's not it's not Mario
Kart Mario Kart didn't give any turbo
anything for drift that for tricking for
a long
time my laps two laps pretty long race H
it tells me before I start your he got
my that
W they sure have good balance this is
much
easier
ow I assume I assume the voice is the
commentator who watch
this up up
away and then when you crash it's a
commentator saying
ouch whoa arms in there like we don't
care
this is short short
[Applause]
races we bouncing all over the place
like a bunny as you
say who I wanted do turbo but I guess
tricking works
[Music]
too it is the same button
[Music]
in Mario Kart 2 right say power slide
and trick
who came up with the
idea it's not a power slide this is
terrible then it is
different I'm well I guess I don't mind
another second
place as long as I can as long as it
counts as winning to get the second
place
oh final stretch not actually but just
another
[Music]
corner there it is no oh that was close
oh new
record yeah R complete
yeah
a to your
stream thank
you I can't read your name om Shredder
your name
is
name well done enter your
name p
o
and there we got four laps Rock forest
look at Jump I think it's a
bridge thank you
master hey you got the reference I'm not
yet played it but it's so well known
well I didn't get it which is easily in
my top favorite
games now I have to switch
back yeah it is I don't know why did
they is that a is that a
mistake I plan to play one
day I know the Gest for the ACT sign is
lit sign American Sign Language but they
went American said follow is beond me
marri need ex which doesn't exist in
Polish yeah I mean
that the Polish spelling
Al yeah because I can speak while
driving and three chat the Polish
sign spelling alphabet is very similar
to the American Sign spelling alphabet
and the difference is that the a sign is
different and that's how you can tell
them apart the I sign are the same I
think and then of course the Polish out
bit does not contain
eggs they because it seems to be based
on the American Sign
Language unless like the British or
French signs are similar to I actually
haven't checked
that
and they could have just taken the ex
from it but in that case maybe they
decid to well let's go with
[Music]
it but I mean my with my experience of
the Internet it's like people only know
that the American Sign Language exist in
no other sign
language because I've seen like comments
on
CU one of
the uh popular videos was the uh
because if you know about song
concept the big event in Europe with
music um well it was the qualification
for which song was going to uh whoops I
murdered that
driver
and I'm doing so bad all I need to get
used to this track first
and the Sweden has the uh well sign
language basically uh gesturing the
lyrics of the song and one of them
became popular because the signer got
so put so much effort into this
song but there were comments saying like
H refer referring to the sign language
as a l American Sign Language but it's
Swedish sign language so it's
not
[Music]
yeah and if you do want the short hand
for sign language it would be
SL skip the
[Music]
a anyway
yeah
did race complete you lost the
race you can tell me um You can call me
Omni
yes that's that's fine Omni Omni which
means all I think even in The Witcher
books ax is spelled with X even in
Polish translation it's Bas it's based
on what what is what what language like
I assume it could be like a Latin or
something and I guess if you were to
spell it in Polish sign language you can
use use K and
S spelling it out more like how it's
pronounced py py
py
and I assume the gestures in the game
does not change if you change language
that would be quite
the effort to put into it would be
amazing to see
though I'm doing better definitely
matter but now I'm doing
again
so okay
[Music]
start okay so
[Music]
yeah now
way silly
[Music]
one oh now I'm
lost this is a tricky
one everyone in a line sing a line
I'm going be
more there we
go
[Music]
aha this is our first
position now it's a side position
[Music]
definitely like arcade style
game but this was never an arcade game
as far as I know it was originally
PlayStation ands there is a computer
version of
game do PlayStation version this was
what I grew off
it played it as a
child I haven't played it for a long
time oh
record well no I'm quite far far ahead
now but now is the not the time to mess
up they sure exacted about that new
[Music]
record come on
reset that was
bad that was
bad no more celebration
now oh why did I do
that I know my
fness should pass
[Applause]
me okay have concentration now I bump
the wall anyway
[Music]
I'm the world
250 seems
fine I do find it interesting that this
is just the pal version released across
Europe and despite using English with
the British flag the
speedometer
[Music]
tetric hello it's not really written
correctly but
details it's written in some strange
Kelvin Mega Henry
form head don't well done enter your
name well done enter your name I can see
it like
that
look a great
one hello
V oh no dead hello hello M racer M
racer it is motoracer as written in the
title of the stream yeah the title of
stream but um they do write they do
write Mr raser and Mr in different
locations and also I'm not sure what
this is supposed to be in the background
I mean this is not a memory
card not really sure why they have
chosen that
as Select Transmission let's go they
could have just R
it WR it they just made a 3 the model of
a memory card but oh
will one of the weird
qu cry cry don't cry I at least
proceeded the race I don't I don't
know I tried to look up what like maybe
I shouldn't look up doesn't matter I was
fa trying to look it up anyway I tried
to look up what like the unlock
requirements for in the game like what
do I actually have to do to unlock
things because otherwise I I don't want
this to be an endless stream when I'm
trying to figure out how to
Stu you know I think that's f knowing
what the gos
are some people might like to
like it's not that I need to know what
I'm unlocking but I just want to know
what I'm supposed to
do anyway uh but I could not find any
guide towards how you unlock stuff but
there was plenty of guid telling you
what the cheats are
which I'm obviously not going to use
what's the point of playing the game wa
the bike bouncing all over the place I'm
a bunny like the white
bik it's
fitting after all I'm
uh well that was an inside joke my B
[ __ ] the joke about
the W the European white onion
rabbit well so far who oh that was
close how did they get permission to
drive on this thing and as far as I know
the the the the great world does not go
in circles look there's more wall in the
background the the actual Great Wall in
China is multiple segments varying width
and height and there are branches and
stuff as well it's not just a sing
Single long s
now not a single long
snake that background looks repat
it the backround has many
small segment
it this was much easier
than yeah but I not get a record it was
just computer where it
is
[Music]
hi go to bed wait who are you talking
to are you going to bed
Bailey well done and your name you're
you're free to go to bed if you
want um yeah this is the total race time
oh yeah and the reason why I got two
total race times because uh you only get
to ENT your
name after you complete it so I got that
record failed and then I got another
record after
succeeding West
way I
know oops wrong
way I know something else that's long oh
do
you WEA bunny welcome WEA bunny also

died let's increase increase the Stak
you you die if you fall
off at least I'm on the
bike
so far at
least I cannot seem there we go third
position that's the all I
need not games like one you need the
first position in every race to unlock
this special
mode
not hopefully the game is kind to
[Music]
me
let's see and I'll get back to chat when
race is
over as I do when it comes to racing
games there's a problem with racing
games of course is
that I can't read the chat during the
race at least not when I'm this game it
was a bit easier need speed
because goodas read
it and when I was driving slower we
Les but it be did become harder with um
Master
[Music]
Vehicles these bikes these bikes are
quite quite quite fast
already well in second
place European white onion rabbit

ends and you boost
by riding on the back wheel because
increasing the a the amount of air
resistance you have I
assume yeah get away and

down on the back
wheel I don't know
physics but if you're watching a
motorcyle race do you see
them
D Maybe
[Music]

D I take it right

wisdom um well done enter your
name well done enter your
name well
um giving pon pon lots of money to buy a
new computer means that pon pon can use
a 3D pon pon on screen which will be
animated alongside pon pon and I will
make a lot of outfits for you to choose
from
that is my
wisdom I hope you enjoy my
wisdom i s I don't have a motorcycle
license if I were in Europe I'd be it'd
be NE for me to drive my own car because
it's a manual and has an automat I mean
you I mean technically if there's no
distinction of the driver license they
wouldn't
know
technically and
uh and I don't know if that's a thing in
other countries it is a thing in Sweden
at least but if you want a legitimate
Swedish license which you would need to
if you were to live in
Sweden this one right check point with a
dash too interesting
um anyway and you would need to take a
swed license which you have to do you
have to take do the final um
uh driving test
the the very final one with a
manual everything else you can do in
automatic W where am I supposed to
go whoa
whoa going to say is that a glitch no
it's a
mine
was supposed to be a line in this Sky
there many points did you have your
stuff
[Music]
shck am I good at this type of race or
is just this type of race did they just
underestimate how like or over
a crashing the slight bit of snow on the
side of the road or did they
overestimate how difficult this type
this game mode would be whoa whoa
whoa hello
deuna
welome okay
let's
wait are you winning P well I did win I
mean as long as I get the top three is
good that's working so I'll pop in and
out that's good that's fine panda
[Music]
panda P motorcycle would just have her
ear FL wouldn't that be K
though um here's my wisdom if at first
you don't succeed sky diing is not for
you yeah I'm here for the wisdom good to
go to like them well thank you for Thea
for being here for both wisdom and luy
more them never ever ever under any
circumstances take an a laxative and a
sleeping P together same night I see and
do you have like personal experience
with that nice
start starting this my lap record which
is silly when games do that it's not
like I've not done the record just
because I restart track doesn't make any
sense and when you restart they
intentionally decide which value should
be reset they have intentionally made
made it so that the record is reset
which for is very we for some
reason
or they have a separate
like array of things to do and they just
clear
array really depends on how they program
this
actually I can't say
that
or only two
NS already it's fin lap after two
laps I in second place so it's good
we're far behind everyone else wait
we're far ahead of everyone else there
we go that's what I meant to say wa the
arrow tricked
me so much for
warning whoop excuse
me thank
you no don't
no don't do the bouncing don't bounce
like a
bunny no don't do the
crashing don't crash like a band in
case stay on the track like a good M
like like a good motor
[Music]
racer no no personal experience I just
know it's a bad idea but how do you know
you shouldn't be so sure unless you
test I'll be going to the store after
stream
going to the store to buy some laxative
and sleeping pants to do the
test
W but the game did not track any scores
at all so whichever position I came in
it doesn't matter it's just a generic
obviously F
silly
congratulations
congratulations reverse mode activated
oh no who activated
[Music]
it that's about to fastest second can
speed this speed suit okay time to go
through every track again how long did
that take 1 hour 60
Minutes I probably do it a bit quicker
now with experience I have unless I'm
going to be really confused by the
reverse mode this is not mirrored mode
this is a reverse
Mode wrong way again I need the pink
bike the orange and
pink the raspberry
orange I am a silly Pon so uh in other
news which I wrote on the Discord server
for everyone here who does not know I
have a Discord server I I do have a
Discord
sorry I fixed the on screen chat so it
displays 3
2 so finally displays emojis
correctly and the fix was pretty
easy
because um when you send a
message the on screen chat picks up that
message but it's not just plain text it
wow whatever it contains a lot of data
as well and one of the those data points
is uh which pictures your message
contains and I'm using the term pictures
here because it contains both emotes and
emojis so I goes through every but the
problem is that your message can
contains both emotes and emojis and they
are treated
differently because an em
OTE is not an emoji an emote is just
plain text that is converted to a
picture into
display but then an emoji is an
emoji so that's
different
so but the twitch gives this
list have first all the twitch emotes
and then the Emojis so go through the
list
backwards and check if the type is an
emoji then I put it in a new
list but if it's an
emote then the emote tells me where the
uh start and end of the message oh I
just face through that one is is this
emote where it's where it's located
so I take this started and replace that
text with the HTML code for a picture
because the on screen chat is just the
on screen shat is technically just a web
web
[Music]
page new record and I go through it
backwards because if I go frontward
which could be a word for Words
eh
then
uh that would uh mean that the positions
of
later emotes moves but if I go through
it backwards that means that the the
ones I have not gone through yet has not
been
[Music]
moved I I'm probably bad explaining it
but yeah
there we
goe all I get run into yeah see that was
much easier
now there we go there's some
emojis and
yeah but the reason
why the
the when you put emotes that they well
done ENT your name
P Pon is well
done so well done
B
andina going wrong
way I need to learn which buttons that
should press
yay but the reason why the Emojis
displayed on screen in reverse
order not specifically in reverse order
but they kind of switch which is
switch and
why and why it broke when I tried to
display emotes together with Emojis was
because for the because the emotes it
told me where in the message the start
and end of the text Quest but for emojis
it did not so I need I need to replace
them
differently the since twitch gives me
the Unicode code point for each
Emoji I can simply go through the you
the message replace every instance of
that code point with the picture of the
Emoji I did a mistake there so it it
went through
every Emoji qu code point that twitch
gave then I replaced it with the list of
pictures which and the list of pictures
is was the combination of emojis and
emotes so it's it it was a
mess but now I fix
that which solves both the issue with it
sing around the Emojis and it breaking
when you combine them so now you can
combine most and as well as much as you
want and it should write out everything
exactly as you wrote it wa isn't that
great bet well done pon pon the best way
to be
eaten
probably pon pon is a well done
rabbit however I'm not doing so well in
this
so don't be afraid I can understand if
people like were like I don't know where
the ter is cautious from using emotes in
my chat due to the issue but is fixed
now so you can use as much emotes as no
Emojis I meant to say emojis cautious
about using emojis but emojis has been
resol and fix and working properly now
so use as many emojis as you want if
you're using if you're on your phone
switching to getting access the Emoji
pretty simple if you're on Windows for
example if you hold down the windows key
and press the period key you get the
Emoji
selector in Windows
10 I don't know about other windows
versions
not
to some reason I'm doing really bad at
this it because I'm talking about SK
chat
anyway yeah that was
bad you lost the
race
I prefer
rare well I guess like B kasui
and Donkey
Kong
of other popular games they
made PL right res right out that is PL
yeah so yeah that's the next thing
when you posted the carrot before it
posted as a small carrot not like a
large
picture how
come and that's because H
Twitter Twitter tweet does not recognize
the carrot as an em Emoji it is not so
when you post a carrot it it is not put
in the list of pictures for me to go
through or technically on screen chat to
go through and replace with proper
pictures so all it say when when you
send a carrot it it doesn't it doesn't
see it as an emoji it just sees it as
any other
letter so I just this is being displayed
in the on screen chat as the standard
Windows standard Windows 10
the emote
pH so what I have done is figuring out
all uh emojis every single one of
them that does not work that twitch does
not
recognize and put them in a list and if
your message contains one of them that
one will be put in the list of
pictures doing what twitch should have
done so now now my code is doing it for
twitch because apparently twitch can't
do
it twitch can do it but they're not
doing it because twitch isn't doing what
they should be doing so now it will
recognize the carrot as an
emoji doing this I did
recognize uh what emotes are not working
and it's basically every emote that is
in emoji version
0.7 and Beyond they support every
the Emoji from 0.6 and below and if you
want to know which Emoji version We are
on now it's
14 which is quite far
behind have not they they don't even
support version
one they added 0.6 and probably back in
the day and then y we're done now no
need to have the disle them
again
technically my code even supports Emoji
15 which is the upcoming version but
um and because 15 is not released yet
they actually don't have any pictures so
while they are recognized they will show
up as broken
pictures you lost the
race
uh the Polish flag isn't
working no I know I know because the
Polish flag is not part of um of emoji
0.6 or
earlier is this war Coliseum from Mario
car4
maybe it's certainly I mean is a dirt
bike colum so it makes sense to have
things
game it does not make sense to have
Mario Kart 64
let's it does make sense to have it in
marioart Wii because they added
bikes
anyway uh rare is too soon you need to
delicately apply tender attention to P
punch Dre before
enjoying I mean that is true you you
need
to apply as much
H
here and and Bre p p well before you can
e now we need to do
like the
uh an emote of a cooked one oh maybe
not which Swedish character is the
Japanese Yen symbol
oh funny guy he's so funny guy obviously
there's not Swedish you can't even type
the
Swedish uh if you mean the uh message
there that's the yeah when it takes the
uni code and displays it in Windows
52 I actually don't know which is Swit
it's
just I only know that when that appears
in a switch because uppercase lowercase
letters are are separate character
so there are six combinations each of
them starts with a capital A til above
it maybe it's different for lowas or up
I don't
know that's way to recognize them so
Terri distract for some reason I might
distract myself with talking about
random
[Applause]
stuff wi wink wink well wave I meant to
say to wave at someone in the wave in
Swedish is V specifically when you're
breathing
someone cooked pon pon why not wouldn't
he like the c
[Music]
[Applause]
p come
on oh yeah maybe it's time to restart
now 3 2 1 so yeah don't know which
symbol it is but you can always ask Papa
wolf Papa
wolf
Papa H to uh give you this sish alphabet
or something and then you'll
see checkpoint quite the
check wa okay can I win this time oh
yeah so
as I said I did support all emojis up to
15 version 15 so why isn't the Polish
flag working then that's because the
Polish flag consist of two
CES that is
why two emojis combined into one I I
support every single Emoji up to 15 so
if you post for example a person with a
skin color modifier you're going to see
the basic y hello person with a skin
color modifier after
it and the same thing if you post a
person a gendered version of a person
you're going to see at the gender
neutral version of the person followed
by the gender
[Music]
[Applause]
symbol because those are combined emotes
added after like in version one I think
and for me to write the codes of those
are recognized that's going to be so
much
extra and I'm not exactly sure how to do
it what would a cooked P for emote look
like I I thinking like if you imagine
like a cooked chicken or
something H like a cartoon chicken being
fried alive or something but which P one
instead with the sh pump of
course okay how I actually not going I'm
going to get the top three position
that's that's my goal I don't need
more I don't need more than that
wa
W so yeah if you post what do you mean
you contest or someone else contest if
you post for example the Swedish flag
followed by the US flag you're going to
see well the letters SE followed by US
flag if you test it should been Swedish
flag by US flag it needs to be that
order but you can also post it in
reverse order if you do post it in
reverse order you're going to see
something else
happen that one work yeah because that's
a generic
person yay I won finally finally after
one
attempts
well done enter your name oh three
records in
[Music]
one there we
go no
not kind the
same now it should say that I have
reverse mode unlocked but not pocket
mode
yet yeah wait why did that first one
break
what that doesn't make any
sense why didn't it replace
the that's
weird that's me very
weird Okay as I said it goes through the
goes through it backwards so it starts
so when the US flag is the after the
switch flag it starts with the US flag
replaces it with the US flag and then it
gets res switch flag which it doesn't
recognize because that's not part of the
original
emojis so what it sees is that the
letter e so it replaces the E and then
it sees the letter s so it replaces it
with an s
but when you put in the other way so you
put the US flag and then the Swedish
flag what it does is that again it
doesn't see the Swedish flag it sees a
letter e it replaces the E and then it
sees the letter s but what it does is
that replaces every single letter s
including the letter s that is supposed
to represent the US
flag then it continues and then it and
then it finds the oh that's why the u u
doesn't work because that because then
it finds the use flag but there is no
use flag there's only a single U left
because the S has already been replaced
but to make this the flags work not only
do I have to add the flags I also make
must make sure that it replaces the
flags
before single em emojis so must it must
do combine emojis before single
emojis it need so I need to prioritize
them more
which is a bunch of extra extra
work wouldn't be an extra work for me if
twitch just would recognize them because
they would do the work for me but not
really actually I would still have
to do extra work
myself because they don't they don't
tell me where the where in the message
they're
appearing which I think is the bigest
problem
[Music]
might sure I could go through it and
just find the first one to replace the
first inance I mean would
work
no see yeah the Pol flly just doesn't
work because it's
unrecognized and I don't exactly know
how ow how I would even add
it's because when you post the Polish
flag it already puts the p andl as to em
emojis in the list of
pictures
[Music]
so
so
yeah of the time I'm in last position
I'm doing so
terly and use the same track which is
reverse I'm doing so
bad you lost
the
2 1
[Music]
go yeah when when Emoji was created in
Japan that's what emoji is the Japanese
word for picture
character um they only recognize like 10
countries when they made it whoops
someone
died bouncing off
[Applause]
[Music]
everything
but then when Unicode added it is said
okay we need to actually support every
single
country because the thing is when Japan
originally made it they made emojis
specifically for those 10
countries but unic said no we can't do
that we can we cannot have a character
that stands for well a country because
that country could cease to exist we
cannot have a that we can't have that so
there okay when we create 26 letters
instead and then you just combine it two
letters which represent the iso code or
ISO code for the
country which is used in a lot of
places and that would be the emoji for
the flag and that's how the flags use so
the flags use up two
[Applause]
emojies and there's also where the flags
are broken in my
chat unless there's those 10 or whatever
how many it was that Japan originally
recognized in their emojis H cuz those
are on Twitch
recognize and why would I recognize more
countries
[Music]
that's
[Applause]
there we go second place so much
better I broke the japanes flag is the
Polish flag
yep because the Polish flag contains a p
just like the Japanese
flag because because it tries to look
for the because it tries to look for the
Japanese flag but the Polish flag is
already placed every p with the picture
well done enter your
name I guess I
could go through the
uh go through the Emojis
forward and only replace the first
instance maybe that's a better
decision
so back to the great one of just a great
wall where it is I don't
know they have decided to basically not
mention any countries in this
game
surely this is obviously man this is
obviously China
but but what's
[Music]
China
checkpoint sometimes it's very easy
sometimes it's very
hard look at those 2D pictures of fls
swapping out to take
too wave in the wind at a low frame
rate did puty next effort of doing that
so ow I appreciate it the Great Wall of
Gris
what is
Paris you confusing
me driving straight into the one I don't
know how fast he was going into that
one yeah no idea what to saying sound
like something about time and you are
something ow it's turning off the music
yes to hear the
voice I love this
level oh papa wolf what happened why
aren't you loving this level
anymore tell me your tragic backstory to
why you lost your love for this
level tragic back story
I hav not read your answer yet maybe was
I TR back for I shouldn't
[Music]
judge who
whoop I didn't mean to do
that
anyway doesn't matter second position
still
me Gris is a Dy and setting of the great
game dragon dma and one of the final
areas is the great one
Bo this great one definitely isn't even
semia well done enter your
name the accuracy doesn't
even why can't I just remember what I
inserted West
way yeah the the accuracy on it doesn't
even show up on the
chart oh I switched over to the
swim 3 2 1
[Music]
[Music]
go okay let me win
this very weird level do
backwards every level is weird doing
backwards I do I believe that they
actually are backwards oops and not just
mirrored cuz mirror isn't a new track
you don't drive it any differently backp
does make a
[Music]
difference and it's also a cheap way for
adding more basically adding more
[Music]
tracks Mir can still be an option but it
shouldn't face
backwards basically what I'm
[Music]
W hey that person recovered
quickly W that was close to the
Invincible one could see the polygons
[Music]
checkpoint here the remake of this game
on mobile which well I guess I wish it
wasn't on mobile
but with a new computer windows I could
maybe run because Windows 11 should add
support to run Android
apps
and so if that I I haven't looked into
how far along because they did not
include that at release but we're going
to add it
eventually
whoops new record finally anyway H so in
that case I could play some Android
games if they like proper Android
games like the remake of this game for
example and because yeah cuz there's a
lot of like endless games on Android
which I prefer games that actually can
[Music]
complete nice P next pack all around
yeah that wasn't
good
I one one more
try why is it why is the connection so
wobbly more like someone Lo sck
charge yeah that's true someone lost the
shot of the how the right should look
like
oops
oops hey that person's cheating
[Music]
I I do keep track of every PlayStation
every game not just PlayStation every
game I'm playing so I could so I could
have
a a list of every single play one game
and checking them off one by
[Music]
one
oh that was just going
wi do you need more practice on this
s oh I'm lost
it
one
[Music]
now I have good
speed wow what a
rocket oh my
[Music]
touch the thing I just touched the thing
come
[Music]
on time is running out s
it and when the timer runs out you
cannot longer
accelerate but the but the game isn't
over until you
stop time
out I should have done that this means
that as long as you have enough speed
you can reach the next
checkpoint which is an interesting
feature
course I did not have enough speed there
especially bumping and
stuff what welcome playing
some motor racer on the PlayStation
one another game the that [ __ ]
100% there's like four things don't like
in the gamees it shouldn't be too hard
but unlock it no way four tracks two
modes there we go I'm unlocked four
tracks those are very easy to
unlock and unlocked one of the modes
which I'm doing at the moment and I hope
I unlock the other mode by finishing
this mode but that doesn't mean that I
technically don't have to play the other
mode if I unlock it because I mean I'm
unlock there's no more nothing else to
[Music]
unlock I can still like test it out of
course I mean of course there's one hour
left of the stream there's plenty of
time but this track seems to take much
of the time that means I can play the
second game
uh
tomorrow
it's pretty nice when the games are easy
and short so I can complete them quickly
checking them off on the full L of all
PlayStation games I really should play
all Playstation One
[Music]
[Music]
games this motorcycle is going to break
there's no breaking in
yeah at least you don't collide with the
um the the PO stuff I should hydrate
after this as
requested yeah that
[Music]
crap okay
let me adjust my position even
though have then and I do the
hydrate
and the message I got and then back to
the
game I'm to win 2
cheer me on where's the
cheerleaders the bunny Che leaders Shing
on bunny
eracer but the bunny cheer leaders are
the same character the bunny Racers
so there's plenty
of the bunny racer created clones of
herself to share her
on
W no
no G me a cheating now Pawn leader yes I
had the pawn
position and then I crashed on nothing
because it wasn't invisible wall there I
was going too close to the edge of the
track least most of the time they have
something that shows you where the edge
of the track is but not
[Music]
there
no nice
[Music]
nice there lot of
Cl I that
oh I should slow down how' that
happen yeah I said there's an invisible
wall there you could see it when like
after crashing that there was like the
the if you look very carefully to the
edge of the track you can see how
the there's a slightly different
texture it it is the invisible wall it's
stupid but it's an arcade game they kind
of do that
sometimes
[Music]
I keep doing
that nice stretch texture
there yeah most of the time they have
like fence or wall or something that
shows the edge of the track when that
snow level a bit of snow on
edge just a tiny bit of
[Music]
snow while I crashed into the
yeah where the shadow is
there 2 1
go on this track shouldn't be this
hard someone
[Music]
F when I know something else that's
hard
okay starting off to the crash just to
make
[Music]
point
yeah not doing that
[Music]
great
[Music]
I just need to set positional better
that's all I
need I also need to be better at this
track I do feel like I'm getting
my
[Music]
[Music]
no what that was
[Music]
close
get
[Music]
for
oh
complete well I guess a fish position is
better bounc
ques when RAC said bunny cross the
finish time yes that's all it
counts how it's about which person gets
across the finish line and the only
thing that can Aid you is the motorcycle
but you don't need to bring the
motorcycle across the Finish
Line as long as you come across that's
that's all it
can yeah this time I should I tried to
avoid crash that but I crashed
instead
okay there's people
accelerating terribly in this
area this is area
ter
[Music]
there there we go that's how I did
[Music]
it no
way
back at last
position oh excuse me get out of my
[Music]
[Music]
way get for
okay need to get ahead of two
[Music]
[Music]
more one
more not record and now I'm a
rocket then I bump the
one tried to be sneaky there but
punished me
no probably didn't have a chance to
catch up with the SE place anyway but
well anyway let's reach the go
and okay this is a bit
tricky p position is better
but go of course it's not the requir
position why is this track the trickiest
of them
all
when they aren't in a pack at
[Music]
moment I keep doing that keep doing the
same thing over and
over
yep it's down here
here we can actually drive
here tank please
3 2 1 go I really thought it was going
to be anible one there I mean there was
still one there but further in than I
expected
well that was
[Music]
near
it shouldn't be this hard this is just
[Music]
medium
how is that a new
Rec but that was terrible but
okay these many attempts I'm going to
feel every slot on
the the record
list it itself could be a challenge you
probably have to do practice mode or
something going go into practice
[Music]
mode do a track and
get all five lab positions for best lab
and get the uh fastest lap one which
should probably
C and when you exit the level so you get
all six possible position positions to
ENT your name at the same
[Music]
time I feel like I had that and then my
[Music]
step
complete
H I will get it I will get it give me a
few more
train 3 2 1 go p p k fun I'm happy find
me
cute I like being cute I like to dress
up cute I hope you've seen me wearing a
dress hope you find it dress
cute I should get more cute dresses I
can show
up
not
to but I hope everyone is here for cute
and
adorable he so cute and adorable when he
struggle with his
[Music]
lemon
bouncing across the road like a stone
skipping away very bounc the yeah they
are very
bouncy 3 2 1 go things tells me they did
not research how much a human would
bounce around after you make a
crash maybe they
need is like crash his
[Music]
dummies there we
go there we
go oh thank you for oh come on where are
you coming
[Music]
from
here we go don't need a first place I
just need a top
three I'm try to keep the second place
because then I can at least drop
opposition without having to
[Music]
[Music]
worry final
lapal
lap
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay
[Music]
there
go and a new
Rec new lap
[Music]
record I'm spinning the whole time
[Music]
too oh yeah I once fell out of a boat on
a lake and went bouncing over the lake
surface was spin whole time
well done your name oh three four
positions p p p p p p
p finally time to
save then used py ball to determine how
a human would impact this they they made
a human out of the bouncy ball and
material
okay at least this one is
easy go go go yay thanks for the
celebrations thanks for the
encouragement and
Hello nice to see that you're still
here okay go this one should hopefully
be his
here 3 2 1
go this camera is tilted in I noticed
that it does that
sometimes yes I mean
it's doesn't
hurt the pile
of pile of
humans of course I'm in last position
because takech Dash Point it really
can't cons be cons Sy with how they
right
[Music]
it
okay yeah it was that
way wrong
way bouncing bounce bouncing on the
opponent and being pushed back a
bit and it's
triy why some games tend to have a delay
before it says that you're going wrong
way
takes a bit of time before it triggers
it doesn't accidentally
trigger PR will still be quick
enough don't go be going the wrong way
for too
long but this game is really quick and I
still went the wrong way once
so oh someone is stuck behind the behind
the bike
by someone I mean the
leader cam is inside the
w

this

not the best in this
game okay I'm last but apparently I need

vehicle when I do like racing game but
when you're doing this and then do this
wa I guess
you still can't see but not as well as
you could outside
y
add I

[Applause]

[Music]
character I'm at least the main
character of this
stream
[Applause]
wow where where is Rocket
Man this game references
Rockets rocket man needs to be here for
every game that references
[Music]
Rockets otherwise he will be at
disappointment to all
Rockets rocket kind I mean he's only
half a rocket
but he will only be half disappointment
but it's
[Music]
still and that's when he opens the
stream and hears he would don't be
e he's on half he's will going to be a
half
[Music]
[Applause]
disappointment
[Music]
when there's one more tricky left race
after this one which is the red zo
something red City or
[Applause]
[Music]
something
[Music]
[Applause]
check
[Music]
checkpoint have fun with changing
[Music]
outfits race

there we
go wasn't that hard this
time I pick every with this
stream I mean you could do
like 12 outfits for teams right
away
Thea of
sand doesn't seem like a see if
it's
yay so
what what celebrating thatan picked
every outfit that I won the
race I feel like the
latter two one go but I want the pink
pink pink to wear her P
dress
nah oh people just lying dead on the
ground
there
and what makes the When you mention the
POS for position there what makes the B
is how left align it is like left align
how how far to left is POS
positioned they could easily have right
written like position or
something
the to of space and it's not like
there's more than eight races as far as
I know there's no other game mode that
wait what happened I crashed in the
air don't you hate it when he just
flying through there and just crashes
all of your
point head parties right out position
instead of POS p p
service are you afraid of writing the
word
[ __ ] this is an 18 plus thing you have
written worse things than the word is
it
and I think and I watch it and black
craap are quite M
personally not the worst to write
that
and I'm not doing so great on this
strike checko
we where is the practice mode we does
have a the
ghost which
i p in the wall
again
[Music]
hello I know I like all the time yeah he
what's wrong with breing
[ __ ] yeah I'm not doing so great let's
restart 3 2 1
go oh no p is saying the word she
multiple times during the
[Music]
Stream Point point I'm a
bunny someone not watching the stream
yeah we
know actually quite
obvious
and no one has ever called me a dog
unlik what a bunny which people thought
was a
dog funny how that
works and obviously what a bunny is a
bunny based on name and that makes it
even funnier because people think the
bon bon in my name is a reference to
what Bon Bon's the
sweets but H it's not it's a reference
to
Bunny come on
come
on so that's but water bunny actually
has bunny in his name I think I mention
all this
different people consider him a dog is
kind of weird no one I said that I my
dog
down it's
[Music]
interesting and then I made a dog outfit
for pon pon the pon pon mod for crash 4
which I think I had the idea before the
whole water bunny do thing I don't
know I don't
know well at least I don't think I
picked that as an idea no I must have
come up Day Afternoon that the bun has
been called dog but still
I'm I'm pretty sure that my choice of
that was
independent while I crash there instead
where's corn am I crashing all
time
it this one down
here yeah it must be this
one if I did that is that I clear it
Point okay let's do it for
you 2 1 go well
spit Pon
sweet yes sweet like sweet B
p b the pon
pon have a good stream cute B I'll be
heading off okay
yto thank you for stopping by it's been
nice having you
here it's been quite the
party very nice having people
here Ching some
time when I'm playing
games and look at those black
trees are they naturally like that or
have they
burnt so hot here that they are
burning yeah and here's the
corner
there we
go and I keep doing that now
instead it's been nice being here you
silly P why am I
silly B is too hot
be I
guess
oh no I crashed my
clone and then I crash into the
invisible one this place is so hot
because p is
here 1
go
ow come
on someone comes cruising past
slowly I need to win this what this come
s someone
crashed recovered very quickly or
something I'm reach the third position
the computer feels threatened
there we
go how nice of them putting up a
rope and flaged on the Rope so you can
see the Rope at the water so you don't
go into the
water
[Music]
point point something like a
bunny look at those Stone
TS
Bo but I do keep this position at the
moment
so I'm doing quite well I'd
say
[Music]
no oh no there we go I did I
survived bones bones very
[Music]
bouncy on there
okay time to win
at Le that's side
position music is
gone see one in second
position now touch the one lost
speed
okay approaching this corner
pment slowed
down that wouldn't fly high where this
way up up and
away come on come on come on oh
close doesn't change anything but it
will be nice for the second position to
make up this
but pon pon is wearing a swim she should
be allowed to
[Music]
swim modding the character on the
motorbike to look like pon pon wearing a
swim
seat Well Done enter your
name we go p p red City
reverse
mode okay this is the second to last
track I
think was it no no yeah there's
the this's is snow level after this
one which is the last
track 3 2 1 go
hey why are they so Speedy they crashed
already come on out of the way if I run
over your B you should die I mean
d
[Music]
nothing
oh this strike with the eptic
[Music]
tunnel
wa
W bouncing all over the
[Music]
[Music]
place yeah let's
start 3 2 1
Pon is not wearing a swimsuit
anymore but you redeemed the with this
stream you must have spent a lot of
points
the start and that's so that's so
grammatically wrong I'm going to
P the only word you got I mean the words
the meanings like it's the correct word
it's gr the wrong grammatical form of
them except the last word that's the
only one that's correct in that
sentence when you're
right because Stan is the definite form
as you probably know but because then
with n so the first words will also end
with
n CU they should
match and that's probably kind of how
the the
uh reason why they they are gendered in
that sense in the first place because it
it kind of blows together my
[Music]
better
yeah and you also need to use the
definite form of the thre which is the
same as the possessive
form and the uh plural
form basically the inflected form of the
the color other than the ne and common
singular
[Music]
who what a rocket are indefinite more
[Music]
[Music]
specifically singular indefinite non
possessive is there a term for nonp
possessive new
record final
I have even though I'm bouncing off the
walls at least I keep in the first
position which is what is all that
matters and all that
[Music]
[Music]
matters yeah having the record l La
flash
plus time label cuz I got a new record
is not exactly
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
necessary
who yeah corner at the end the race that
doesn't seem
safe because you want go full speed to
win the race but you're going full speed
towards the
corner I'm too hungry to S
[Music]
oh well done enter your
[Music]
name
we going another Pon and this is the
last let say before
it who I win
that's my sound
crash
o go W wo W wait for me I want to be
part of the
race you got the bad start but I'm
inside
already
checkpoint at least this game doesn't
have like a big checklist of things to
do win every Championship with every
bike in every
mode oh
my
bouncing like a
buny is this one so much easier than the
sand track SE of
sand
also very shorts thing
like I don't feel like this this
lap this almost feel shorter than a sea
of sand but this is just two laps
compared to other one being three
laps could be wrong
though maybe this is one
these
[Music]
one
ah and the snow on top of things is like
slightly gray instead of white and the
sky is slightly gray but the picture
that is supposed to represent the
background is
[Music]
white
weird a second position that was really
quick
really really
quick then that means I'm
done and it took almost 3 hours to
complete the whole game hopefully I that
was all of it I can still like to test
out
the last
mode the person in second place does not
get a
price it's a first price a third price
and second is just the is just
participation
congratulations pocket bike mode
activated well done enter your
name
well I have unlocked everything now I
have 100% the
game in 2 hours and 48
minutes let's SA
of course it is not possible to make
every box checked because the
um two playay mode Championship 2 2p so
champ H save one wait wait do count how
many times I save and this one that one
can is for two playay mode and that case
they want the mode will not be yeah
let's try out pocket
mode pocket
mode yeah for my first H the birday
stream the and only B stream when I
played custom music in the background
there we go there
go come go
[Music]
[Music]
go
checkpoint Baby M yes
is that what did you call it baby
mode that would be confusing baby
[Music]
motorcycles sh
motorcycles they are faster too because
these this goes like 300 normally and
you can speed up like 330 up to 340 even
so maybe not child
motorcycles I think would the CH
motorcycle
be
whoa motorcycle is for children that go
over 300 by normally and you
can p off in
quickly what do like first person you
don't even have a view cuz the view is
above
it you can't even see the instrum
instruments you can't even see the Dash
whatever you call the M
secondy yeah well
let's game over
that's the baby
mode the baby M cycle
mode
oh no I lost the follower oh
[Music]
well oh Pokemon has different
times yeah I
mean I so we start oh you have
load you have a two playay mode which I
can't you can all this if you want but
not reverse
mode this is here make your choice
but if you go like single race you can
enable reverse mode yeah
oh yeah was because I'm done with the
game I don't have anything else to doct
your
mode
so I think that's all what else is
that
