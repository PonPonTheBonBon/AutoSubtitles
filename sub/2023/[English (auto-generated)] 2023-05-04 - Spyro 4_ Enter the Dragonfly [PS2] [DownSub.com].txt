hello and welcome
oh my
oh the music is back I was wondering
where the music went
hello
and
I'm so I'm prepared
[Music]
I I need something to drink
is the picture
dark or something
[Music]
I hope the audio is in sync nursing
one
this is a terrible start of this dream
no I actually got TNA followers a few
months ago
eat your rice is so cute
you always say that
well
um
well I guess
the adventure shall begin
that's great
first eighth first
let's just grab
[Music]
I don't know what's
going on here
oh look at four slots for some reason
they expanded the four slots in enter
the dragonfly
even though you could fit much more than
four slots
and safe slots is a whole discussion
itself
then he can choose what icon you want
but sadly there aren't any
interesting ones
just let's go with spiral
and let's the adventure begin
learning
since this is like a proper place so
let's
just
I'm sure you look happy don't they
spiral well it's not every day that a
dragon gets his dragonfly
squatty Graphics that sound great
Sparks
um reignited
I'm back and I'm stronger than ever
who are you calling little shorty nobody
an obviously invitation only party it's
the game being able to see not me
I haven't done anything we would make a
great team
you want this time riptoe
[Music]
what do we want this time boss
you're not hired for your brains your
dinosaurian land I know this is
that's great
what do I want this time I am glad that
you asked verbal Pest and I will be
happy to demonstrate since I've had
enough to do with Dragons I thought
perhaps dragonfly
[Music]
welcome Izumi
wow this is
but this is relative to remember Lane
so terrible animations
[Music]
are nothing
it's a dragon homelands will be mine
yes Hunter back
at least London I am so slow so squeaky
okay
everything
[Music]
that was close Sparks listen I think I
may have figured out a way to catch
those dragonflies Spyro stand back
[Music]
that didn't exactly work right I'm still
learning you know Spyro the good news is
I've created a powerful magic that will
enable you to use different breath
abilities the bad news is you're gonna
have to find dragon runes to use them
since the spell scattered them in
different parts of the Dragon realms
cool come on Sparks let's get going
we've got a lot of work ahead of us if
we want to find those dragonflies
how are you doing today
uh
well a given getting this Old Spring to
work was quite annoying for some reason
the capture card didn't want to
and because
I had to use the
quality
I don't know what it's called eh
composite
it should be composite right because
it's a composite of the three different
channels
uh this game feels so slow
is it running slowly
or something is it does it have problems
and uh
no
they have
is is it supposed to like I don't have
anything and I am running it on a PS3 so
maybe it has issues
yeah
or is the game reset This Love I have to
play this game in a really long time I
wanted to double check
um sorry for this table
stream for a moment
and I didn't
I didn't have at least oh well I guess
I'll just have to play it the way it is
so yeah
[Music]
is it really playing like this
I guess running felt better
[Music]
pick up gems oh yeah thank you I haven't
learned that's the last three okay
running feels I mean Everything feels
slow so I don't know if this is just
that the consulate problem running the
game
but if it's really not okay seriously
Sparks
I mean
you can
yeah it does feel like the game isn't
running exactly at full speed but why
wouldn't do that
that is
oh yeah never talked to the yeah
maybe that's why the audio
you're doing great
yeah sometimes on the games on your
devices so for some reason I know yeah
it's not really optimized
okay
I need to
pick it up
then
place it over here
wow powerful breath
you have five slots but you cannot use
the five slots you can only three of
them I think
because if you love the middle one and
then you feel out to the right
there's only two slots more
I just remember this song
this old game is weird
but you can't carry more than three
things but you can see all three things
baby
I think I remembered I'm being very some
of them being very hard to catch because
they are running around
not the first one
[Music]
sometimes it does feel like it's running
fine can I jump no that's cute he hasn't
forgotten all that
you can never know
because I've been playing other games
like uh well I did play crook remix
but it does a try like
I don't remember what more I've tried
oh yeah got it
yeah so where exactly do I find these
butterfly Sparks
this is
but yeah I have balancing thank you
meat
[Music]
but I mean
the game I mean at this point the game
probably runs better on my computer
but
oh
[Music]
the slow motion
but the music plays fine and like the
voices play fine
yeah that's kind of my point but my girl
let's move it let's go to a lemon and
see if it's just the home World being
slow or something
so everything is slow
game Islam version
this
I don't
yeah if I if I had a proper PS2 I could
play on that instead but
this is all I got oh
drift talks
no problem
find out what happened here
sounds like you know everything so you
can tell me
I mean okay let's keep the obvious to
use the playing breath
but surely in this game
sure tells you about everything
don't have to walk far before
telly okay
I mean that should have counted right
yeah there's this part
chasing this stuff I don't have peaceful
peace too all I have is a PS5 yeah the
best I have is a PS3 I do have PS1
but
yeah
my camera is probably still running
better than
no one
I guess we get to something that has a
timer
yeah I I feel it is stuttering now
now it's really slow
why is it
why is
okay I guess this game is so badly
optimized it's running terribly on a PS3
I mean is it is that
programming wise it is a terrible game
oh yeah this is some real slow downs I
can continue but I actually don't know
how well the PC feels trying to run this
game so maybe I shouldn't
I don't know
abusing the console
thank goodness I had the sense to free
me from that icy cage who would have
thought the Redbox would dare invade the
sacred dragonfly Dojo spiral do what you
can to return the dojo to its peaceful
state by freeing all of the Dragon
Masters remember Spyro the way of the
Dragon is to be a dragon
remember that Spyro tried to be a dragon
sink like a dragon oh wait you are a
dragon you don't have to be like that
these two Advanced with PS3 it's
it's rather more
too slowly made for a piece
performance PS3
too terribly made
it's probably something with the water
and the fog I think I wouldn't be
surprised
like he's doing some effects no I mean
it runs necessarily looking here and
there's no water here
I should change the camera by the way
uh General that's a good
oh there's a white screen mode I could
activate that
but if I activate it I have to adjust
the screen I keep
should have a second mode specifically
for oh my God it moves so slowly it
moves terribly
you found that this is the peaceful it
is the PS3 it should be Hardware uh it
should it should run on the hardware but
it is a possibility that is actually
running on software I did intentionally
test a game that was reported not being
able to run at all on emanation but uh
but I could play that game just fine and
it wasn't even slow it ran perfectly but
this game is running terribly and I
don't know why
and I passing seems to run it normally I
think because it seems to run fine now
and I don't I don't know if it runs this
terribly on a
if it runs this terrible for everyone
when they play it on a PS3
because it is an original backwards
compatible PS3
so
should I should really set it up for
doing white screen as well it's running
so terribly so
I
I have this oh there is a hint yeah
let's turn it off
is it
just does terribly let's not include
more on the screen it doesn't increase
the resolution though
so avoiding the white screen yeah but I
guess I'll just have to play this way
the game might just be like that
yeah that's what I'm wondering is there
any reports on this if a random one
I have to run constantly
oh it's a big one
is
well
uh
I mean the game itself is also sluggish
so after you land
and I didn't what happened there
if you run off an edge
then you land and then you can move
but if you keep running after running
after that you don't have that pass
weird decisions
Eddie I would describe the PS2 era oh
welcome magician
s
fionas
Bona uh
and they're very attracted that you
showed up
I think darkening
I don't know how to greet new people
I'm happy to see
everyone's showing up
it's just to have a realization oh
yeah
it's a checkpoint yes thank you
I thought I turned off here in swat
teams then if that's not hints uh I'm
going to step away for or to take my dog
to the parking okay
I mean yeah
someone else
I think I don't know maybe they sent it
maybe there's some information regarding
playing this game on PS3
everything
because I don't know what's
but I don't know what else to do so
I thought I should put it on actually
cam
camera is terrible in this game too
you should try to
why are the uh
okay you can
a camera with the rice okay so this is
like like the camera comes back
[Music]
why it is running anyway
yeah I don't know how you're supposed to
capture this
this isn't going great
it's almost feels like it's inside how
inside the bubbles
[Music]
I don't know am I just supposed to be
close to it and do the thing where to
count
yeah it was like
remember this so so hard to
get the
whatever let's see how am I supposed to
get that one I mean the Slowdown isn't
helping but
uh hearts
it does make me
I don't know what to say I I didn't
expect it to show up
I mean I don't expect anything that's
why
I've been I've been basically streaming
for
two people
most of the time
and then for like I guess three people
and
so every time a new person shows up
I just don't know what to say should I
give up
I don't I don't know how to control this
camera it's not at all like in reignite
that's why I have much better it's
almost like you're making like he's a
bit better game regarding controls
performance
and then finally
yeah I can
I'll say captain of the camera afterward
down
I'll just continue I want to see how it
goes
oh yeah if of course
oh yeah it's a dragon
yeah I remember what what to do with
that dragon
that will be for late backtracking
basically
wait what do I
get
oh
Thunder
nice
collecting some more gems
well
okay I want to move the camera it
doesn't move until I stop
I'm just going to collect Treasures
and then I'm going to do a quick little
research again
spinal son I'm sorry the dojo is in such
a state for your visit it's usually a
Haven of Tranquility it is here that
dragonflies grow up and train to be
Dragon companions protecting young
dragonflies as a dragon senses highest
calling you know and spiral your efforts
will result in much reward
no I cannot find anything
and regarding
Greg is regarding in slowdowns
oh well oh yeah this guy's always been
up here
because there are the spider games I
want to play as well
which I haven't because I'm
basically I haven't touched it PS3 you
know
there is a studying collected dust
in a box so technically
so it doesn't
protect it from the dust but
um
so I have no experience with playing
these games on the PS3
well it ran yeah I don't have the very
short
yeah that that that's the shortest
running distance
that's terrible
why did he did that
so I want this to a very short
uh
very short Dash
this
otherwise
if you if you dash a container you get
the Gem immediately like this
but if you Flame the container
the gem has to drop down and you don't
get it
or you don't collect it I guess
and then so you have to wait for it so
that's why I prefer running through the
containers
beyond your ears May the dragon Spirits
guide you on your way
okay that to me didn't do much
that means I have to basically flame
them wait for it
uh money bags
change disappearance
in trouble again I see wait am I travel
so
[Music]
something like that
it's gonna pay me 200 gems to cross this
Mighty large Chasm to reach any of the
other Dojos
although I may be practicing compassion
money still has my soul
every Monday
it's quite a long way down Spyro
I just wonder how long an elder dragon
can sit in a frozen solid ice block the
suspense is terrible
I hope it will last
oh
you're not only greedy here
you're terrible
I saw
what's this name just written as one
word
now it's
thanks Spyro these gems are music to my
ears and will do wonders as inspiration
for my poetry but look Spyro even I know
some magic when properly motivated
yeah you shout your magic in the sand
game oh you have magic to have the
yeah you're done you don't have to
continue yeah you showed your mouse
even made the platform Clips through
each other nice man
but you shoved your magic in the circuit
how can I do the hover thing
forgot about that
was so you don't get a checkpoint for
rescuing any dragons
okay
that seems like an already sink
oh yeah
I guess I missed out
okay you can do that however that's good
I guess you can walk into the channel
and pick it up but it's still
oh
Sparks thing
let's go
[Music]
that's how they did the Speedways in
this game
[Music]
I forgot
one minute
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I feel like this is going to be a very
slow and painful
playthrough
but anyway now that
um
I'm not sure how we will time it
but now this is because it's a Speedway
it should have a timer
yes can only us fly
meaning that I should be able to uh is
it a total time
can I do uh
like in this game can I set up a timer
would you have time on screen but
okay
oh yeah that tell me the whole solution
okay
does it run in seconds how much later
does it run
I'm mostly checking for the time now
rather than defend the speedway
the Nina still fly
I mean
did Clarks see stick away
seems to be in correct speed
now it's you know it is a slightly
slower actually
it might be bad depending oh yeah you
can stand
no no not colliding with the tree
it's four seconds behind
I want to see it like in one minute
I don't mean it is taking yeah it's
behind
foreign
seconds behind
and they did a mess on that
that's
60 27 so like 90 percent the speed okay
let's do it for you
know
and this is
bump press
wait I should go this way
and this is the pal version so it's only
50 frames a second
a terrible controls
that's terrible game
and even though it's just running 90 of
the of the F4 speed it feels still feels
really slow but that's probably because
the game itself is a really slow game to
begin with
have to speak
up the vods afterwards
oh it is there's an edge there
I almost unplanned actually
where did it last flying yes
oh yeah after you start hovering you
cannot start flying again
what's up what's going on
I don't know how this game works
like if I start hovering her here
yep you cannot start flying afterwards
unless terrible
[Music]
foreign
is leaving the Stream
understandable
I don't blame you
these are the the leading ones
oh wait there's another one
ah they go around like that I see
get out
okay why am I missing one
why is this one all the way over here
I didn't remember that being part of
this game
foreign
[Music]
yeah I can basically flame anywhere
inside this
okay there we go
whoa success
try again no thank you
yeah I should probably not hunt you
you want a dragonfly I I don't think
these living beings that we're supposed
to rescue our prices
I don't think
why why
no I didn't want to do it again I don't
know if it is like a hunter challenge or
something
and I can't build but if finding out
uh
didn't I get a single jump from that
for doing the time Trend it was just a
dragonfly
oh well
I guess
I guess no gems for me
oh my God
maybe I should just stay
not play this game and just do
the original trilogy
if that's more interesting
I was talking to you
I don't want to speak to you again
you're a terrible bear that just wants
the dragons to be trapped in eyes
didn't I speak to you
much of a challenge for you perhaps you
should contemplate a career as a dragon
Sensei a it could be your density I mean
your destiny now I will open that gate
that it appears is my density I mean
Destiny Spyro
he speaks as well as this spell in
reignited
[Music]
sometimes it's like running weekly
it became is facing down or something
couch couch
oh yeah
yeah
a wooden basket but just exploded after
running twists
okay
all right as soon as it did you said you
can't move forward
should I should I just not play this
game anymore
yeah yeah this this isn't fun anymore
I mean it's still running running too
slow and I just can't
I gave it a try I didn't know it was
going to be this terrible
on on original
why is the picture cropped
this is interesting
this is weird
this I guess the picture is a bit
different per game
that would be annoying
that one
bye
so
yeah how about
how about the different game
a game that doesn't run as terrible
um
I
I don't think I even have it
I didn't have that passion
uh I didn't know yeah it's been like
40 minutes and I still on the first
level
I mean it was a Speedway time trial at
least but
so should I do like
the original spiral PS1 instead or
something I think that's more fun
let me know what you think
hello astral Mouse I am a bunny indeed
trying to play
into the dragonfly
an original PS3 but
it is running so slow I
wait to start stuff for me hi cute bun
hello
Mouse
my sim based on your name
so
it's that option okay instead
I guess
foreign
so
I mean the console seems to run I don't
know how
and everything
let's cut the game
do you have
but the games and but
yeah I should I should like run the
original PS1 spider games instead
that would be more fun I think
I have no idea why that was running so
terribly
so the other
because the other games I played on the
Thrift pair
I wonder if the outer gave now it seemed
to play just fine so
it also kind of felt slow that's kind of
my issue I have with so that that's what
I never got to about the PS2 my feeling
about PC
have you tried everything oh oh I have I
have I played to do the whole trilogy
without even using the flame button well
the except for the moments I had to use
it but what I wanted to say regarding
the
um
and PS2 I do feel like a lot of the game
not a lot of games several several of
the games I have played such as Spyro
and the other could mix was another game
on PS2 I played a lot of the games feels
sluggish like crash uh Wrath of Cortex
is another game it also feels sluggish a
lot of the games on PS2 feel sluggish
for some reason
and
I'm not sure I'm not sure if it's just
me or
and then they also certain level was at
least uh also focus a lot on adding a
special effects
um I think well crash rest of Cortex is
a great example of a game that's
overusing effects on the PS2
so
and it gives
in the end spider game had a lot of
effects too
and I I just don't think it looks nice
so
[Music]
thank you for the follow
I hope I have games I have I have the
schedule with the future games I'm going
to play
although I'm not going to play this
pirate games I've scheduled for now
because
I do have the uh a hairstyle too
the hairstyle as well maybe I should say
uh but the first issue is that they have
flipped flame and charge I have no idea
who who's a brilliant person was you
just made that decision
and
um
is that a nice
and yeah
I'm getting too distracted too easily
distracted
so and the reason is that there's one is
ain't going to play slowly as well but
uh anyway places One games are on spine
so how about
I'll do that instead
it'd be more fun going back to because
I'm it was basically the Retro stream
now
so let me just go and get it
okay wait
here and then I can
let off
oh
I'm stripping
the headphones
so now
where's my face
like for some reason I can
oh
I see what's going on
not so
yeah I'm being distracted enough now
it's not working oh look at this work
is the game recognized
let's do some
oh yes you should switch again um
this game this version of the game I
haven't played in years
thank you that makes me very happy
here we go
low poly
[Music]
limited textured
spider the Dragon
foreign
of dragons
okay rolling oh it's been peaceful here
in the five worlds or is it six for a
Dragon's Age we now have 12 000 treasure
or is it 14
000.
what about this character now I
understand he's found a magic spell to
turn gems into Warriors for his cause
that's a good question nasty Nork is a
simple creature he has been contained
to the dragon Kingdom no threat besides
ugly that doesn't
[Music]
looks like I've got some things to do
it looks like I got something okay
no poly but I still hike it yeah the
adventure begins it is they have for the
restrictions they have had
wait
wait let me reconnect the control
um excuse me
didn't I already set this up
and
everything is want to mess with me today
please
please be nice
I just want to play the game
I don't know how much of the
if it made this stuff I should do it
beforehand but I'm not
I'm punishment
there you go this is the full screen I
didn't know uh
are this going on that moment everything
is messing with the yeah which I
mentioned before the capture people are
leaving I understand
and the capture card was messing with me
before I didn't want to
damn
oh wait isn't
yeah I didn't want to work so I had to
find a much much uh
for that
can I
yeah I do here
sorry for
this mess
okay error fixed
yeah it's
foreign
Ty
cry yeah but it's it's like
I don't know what's going on
I just want to stream
is that this this third stream is such a
mess
okay
should I listen to every drag I have
listened this one but she doesn't listen
to I'm the dragon should I skip them
thank you for releasing this mean now
three ten dragons in The Artisan world
then find the balloonist he'll transport
you to the next World what about nasty
New York I'm going after him find
dragons first that's all I can tell you
what happened
I'm going after him you know he has a he
has a strange place
you know like I shouldn't go for 100
I where's nasty Nork I'll torch him keep
your horns on Spyro you have much to
learn first do you know what the
dragonfly following you is doing
um his name is
helping and protecting you keep an eye
on him and see what I mean heck yes
yeah and then the question if we go for
100 like to eat like that population
associated
be a bit sloppy and then backtrack
but I cannot play this game a bit random
different way each time
I want this I want to use the right
stick to control the camera it doesn't
really work out this this is
just let me know how you want me to play
the game and I
I'm confused I like getting everything
the first time
I'm going to say that everything like it
sure sure
Queen
I mean
well the question wasn't what you like
to do the question was what I should do
I also don't like how to characterize
and then get back I can't I can't
get past
no more like what what would you think
is more
because you're basically the one I'm
checking at one and I don't know there's
one other person here maybe
they don't have
an account or they prefer not to write
which is perfectly fine you don't have
to write
so I'm gonna call it astral
and I guess you're in the control here
you'd like to be
isn't this game before the d-pad
what's it what's this game available
unblocked
remember
if I can play this d-pad
I can play it with
um
local trans as well it's actually more
convenient let me let me just
let me just try that once more
eh it was just that
sorry for me messing around so much hi
yeah you can come Astro I don't know I
guess get everything first time
oh here we go
this is the
issue ahead
does it work better now
oh sorry
sorry
it doesn't have I don't know is it just
simply thing dialogue
now it's simulating teacher I mean no it
does happen
yeah it does have analog this game did
have analog
on our
I did okay this game I need to have
analog it's it's kind of weird
wait you can't press you can't cover in
this game
um and as I want
I can't
yeah because it's
[Music]
oh thank you
[Music]
okay it's going to drive me in tummy
that's if I cannot
control the camera with that let me
how do I
okay all right I need to just fix the
controls because uh
the app wasn't prepared doing this
anyway so
um
that's that's my setups
Spire controls like this nice
and then
that that's what I did
okay
like that I think that's it
now wait I should do this
but I guess that's not an issue for me
pressing there the wrong buttons
so
that for some reason
here we go
R I see I see
this is why I have so much the issues
okay
okay good good
and then I set the
let it
to use
I must be this is a weird stream though
race controls oh there is inputs
okay now
let's keep straight here
I like this
I like this indeed
now it's reignited controls I can
control the camera with the right stick
I can press the right tricky to Flame
perfect
just like I want it I don't you should
just write tricky to claim but
I mean I have done that in some time
here's one hey Spyro press the jump
button twice to Glide and and don't be
afraid afraid of what falling from high
mountain peaks plummeting into
prehistoric glaciers oh that
and excuse me I bet what's the jump
button I I don't have any buttons that
are in fact
I I'm a dragon I don't come with buttons
he got scared he hurt himself in beer
even functions doesn't get demons
okay I think
I think I should enter a demo and it let
me go through sport
because yeah this game had yeah and the
camera collides with everything
the only problem is up and down doesn't
work but I mean this is better
you feel better
and also the camera controls in this
game is still better than in
in in
into the dragonfly
like that game takes so many step
backwards
and that's if I'm not mistaken if you
just rush through this you don't get
jammed
or maybe I don't know
let me see when I exit if I can remember
let's do a level
around me
so
let's see what this guy has to say
welcome to Town Square spiral begin
exploring by gliding to that area with
the bulls use the L2 and R2 buttons to
get a good look
oh what what
[Music]
do you mean by L2 and RT what's that the
other dragon say jump button
and you say l to an artist
who was in charge for the dialogue for
the attractions in this game
[Music]
all right and not not consistency
[Music]
I think criticizing that okay
thanks Spyro I had the worst itch on the
tip of my wing did you know that you get
your longest Glides by pressing X at the
very top of your jump
okay with eggs
okay so now they decided that they
should go with the names of buttons
why didn't they do that
it just makes me confused
[Music]
I like the sound of that
am I let them lovely but the problem is
that while the game has unlock controls
and
we cut light in color
and the animal controls only works in
eight directions and then you and the
more you push the stick step because
there he goes which
because you can do like a still walk
like this this proves that it has analog
conference
we can only move in eight directions so
which gives this weird
[Music]
want to move it slightly to the side but
I cannot until I've moved the stick
enough and then he just goes diagonally
it's terrible to control
[Music]
but it is
and the same
I think you're not the game thank you
for releasing me
for some reason I want to remember the
FIFA games doing basically the same and
it took a very long time before they
actually made it proper it's 360 degrees
and a lot of controls
lemonade you've got to track him down
and
down and I'm getting a little winded
a good thing I do have the option to
modify the controls a bit but not too
much
yeah nothing much about how it's
sleeping I can just control
[Music]
and which button corresponds to one
[Music]
Chicken in
all right
good kids
return home
and you don't get extra lives from from
killing them chickens
[Music]
yeah I need
if you don't manage to pick it up
with the remain
just save the one of those games you
have to save
[Music]
music yeah
I like Stone here
it's so Stoney and hilly
one yeah
it doesn't
interesting
[Music]
interest with the
just the whole thing that you kinda
[Music]
a part of the level is that you actually
go out of bounds
kinda
oh I only got one Watcher left is that
yeah you're my best watching platforms
you're saving your progress that could
be useful if you run into trouble not
that you ever run into trouble Spyro
all right
oh
no that was time but let me drink
[Music]
there we go now that one much better
I do have to go soon but yeah I'm still
here
I will miss you when I go
yeah look at Chris don't don't feel
pressured to stay
because I do feel free to write anything
uh
you seem so nice
I said that being a weird way but
perfect
yeah I'm much more chatty than most of
my audience like most people have shut
up okay
which did you like because I guess it
can get a bit quiet and I basically have
to
talk to myself
Matthew you freed all the dragons pass
through this fancy for addiction think
of me Tigger it'll take you back to The
Artisan home but first let me tell you a
story no thanks see ya
no thanks I see ya okay
I'm always I shouldn't even try
[Music]
asking that little bit and I know that
having someone in chat have some a lot
subtitled chatter Bunch yeah when I
don't stream I also hang around in chats
missing like a sweet pen and it's nice
hanging out I tried I try my best
I just want to be family
and most people are friendly
watch the dragonfly Spyro his color
indicates his power when he eats
butterflies he stays strong
like me uh sure
[Music]
the big heart
[Music]
is the biggest heart I've ever seen
[Music]
I should have a [ __ ]
oh I have let's see
we are in the reignited they made it so
you could charge these
would you come to her here
boy you can
where did it get from
why do I remember you not being able to
charge this
I mean they are kind of Peaks you should
kind of not shot them or they're like
between the size of small and big
I guess they are kind of smart but why
do I remember you not giving up with
charged
or is it that these or maybe maybe now
now I think I remember yeah if you
charge if you charge this thing you
continue to charge but if you charge
this thing it's like you're hitting a
wall I think that's the difference than
any of the United
but
it reignited to just shot through them
like everything else
yeah it was yeah give us something
[Music]
even if I don't get extra lives it's
still fun
the blaming Bunny and bunnies
foreign
my friend how about a hint on gliding
you bet for the longest Glide press the
x button at the top of a jump and try
pressing the triangle button to drop
down in mid-flight
no I think I know there's a different
level so I guess it's worth repeating
I usually jump over here
but I do think they intend you to jump
over here because it's it's closer
but that's not the
one
where you are faced at start
unless this is really the outer bounds
area
because it really feels like
this is supposed to be the one dividing
besides you're not supposed to be up
here
the ink is doing strange motions
[Music]
now is that if I press the
L2
you should just
no it doesn't work you
if I just press it once it doesn't
really
doesn't really
start the camera backwards just
don't need to hold it down okay
oh well I guess my idea didn't work
well let's continue
I gotta count my bunks
that's me
bye pumpkin
and I'm really nice to see her
welcome back
I hope
do you like uh
you look up
of the game
it looks a bit different
and that was last year
it looks a little more retro than I
remember
[Music]
what dresses
so I have sick going for you
I see it's spiced do that again The
Artisan's boss has threw a portal behind
me I mean you can challenge him now if
you feel you are ready spider was
scheduled for this day it's a different
spider
or do you mean that I'm using spider
instead of Pom-Pom
well this is the original spiral I don't
really have a Pom-Pom mod for this game
but that would be amazing to actually
use
on the original PlayStation
and when I was able to do this
yeah
music is a bit creepy
the dog is halfway outside
my photos it's a bit bubbly
okay
I will probably get this dude one fun
first fire PS3 oh I found me
[Music]
I guess that way I was afraid
is this mine no damage run
I said as I'm
walking off the edge
foreign
[Music]
I guess it was running like 90 of full
speed but
according machine measurements
the music came out loud I'm gonna
overpowers the game
nasty norc has put one of his most
devious henchmen in charge of the
articles
I think I smell a barbecue be careful
Spyro this boss has many tricks up his
sleeve
and be careful spider
he's tone completely ashamed
butt tricks
although mate no damage drama has been
dreaming I took them so
foreign
okay
and in there
music is a bit loud he covered in the
rest of the game yeah just like
reduce it just a bit
because I think probably not the music
being loud is gaming
sound effects being quiet
[Music]
yes welcome everyone
to my
I should say
[Music]
that's the thing though
look at this face
there we are
to the next level
it should be more dresses
the line
dark and Hollow know it
it's better it's like the game volume
Goods or do you want more game volume
just let me know I'll make adjustments
please feel free to write anything new
ones right it's about anything
what kind of bunny species is your
favorite
my brain isn't working
like more comp why doesn't this unlock I
have picked up
hello no I didn't mean to fall down
[Music]
all right no one has redeemed the mimic
animal noises
I'm giving out of the bonus Sounds here
foreign
want to know a secret use the triangle
button when you want to zoom in and look
around oh you're secret's safe with me
is this name Spyro Spyro
is there it doesn't be different
I have no idea about different bunions
and now we have one in our garden but
this was a long long time ago
I had a bunny which was mine yes
I I once landed about me that I would
take care of but it was much too much
tea
too much to take care of so
yeah I didn't know what but I said
I forget to have bunny plushies instead
those I don't have to take care of
[Music]
but that bunny did enjoy petting
foreign
[Music]
oh it's you I wasn't sure if you'd
Escape those annoying little creatures
of course they wouldn't bother me but
here's a hint metal armor is fireproof
but a charge attack will take care of
them
did they change that dialogue in ring
Knight did I haven't really listen to
the dragons during the reunited but I
feel like the dialogue looks completely
[Music]
but is that just me
not that I have
all the dialogues in in reignited
memorized
but for some reason it just felt it's
completely different from what I
expected it just might be maybe
hey not just be me being me
[Music]
mine up
but I do have a document with all the
dialogues in here so I wanted to just
double check see if we go to Dark Hollow
here it was
that again
no it's what you know he actually says
that it just may be easily again
yes that's exactly that thing I guess
it's just because it's a re-recording
and he says it's in a different way
but the addition of subtitles as well as
I do think they do speak more clearly in
the United
makes it easier for me to understand I
do have a bit of a trap on understanding
what some of the dragons are saying in
this game
a dark with other dialogues so you could
do a voiceover
[Music]
yeah
it's it's it might think that it has
every line viruses along with which fine
it is in the game
into very nice of course
so it might be
for doing a voiceover
I have you
wait is it possible wait maybe
because I saw someone doing this
oh yeah there we go
it should be possible I know it's
because I saw something big enemies like
this gonna work with the club cannot be
charged but a quick flame that should
defeat them yeah thank you like there
are no more
norks behind you like
which are the enemies I do or like
thank you for giving me the
I I guess typified they gave me the
solution after in
the other game I said that you shouldn't
give me all the answers I should pick
things up myself
but I mean if you're gonna give me the
answer
like at the end it feels a bit late
[Music]
oh wait there's a gym
you know
we'll get to
do
this on everything there's one level
left technically I don't know where it
is I mean I didn't have a spider doesn't
know where it is
and nothing happens
yeah I think I think the United made it
a bit too obvious especially since
there's a dragon
if you basically tells you
wear vertical
yeah
we went about to do is ten seven
Sunny black Sunny flight
700
that means I have something interesting
this is the path I like to take in this
level
Follow My Lead
okay
um apparently
the
trains are slower than we reignited
that's it I haven't played this game in
years years and years
a bunch
so
there are differences there are clearly
differences
[Music]
and the differences are interesting
[Music]
well it was close and I thought this is
the last train
[Music]
he'll slowly
the arm of the screaming half the things
it could maybe speak more fine than that
maybe I can't change that now I remember
this flying there was so hard to find
out my heart for me too but I was the
person who don't give up I usually I'm
not the person who gives up I don't mind
that I did give up playing I ended her
in life
but that was because there was some
issues playing the game which I without
my controls to control
and so
but otherwise I'm not really the person
to give up
[Music]
so I
pushed forward and
read it these levels until I could
completely
and then
any record
crashed into the camera
and then I got good
I mean that's basically how you play
he's like he played them until you get
good
oh yeah I can't move in this menu
everything is completed
[Music]
let's say because I have done that
step up on the platform
hey spinal do you want to save your game
that's my voice acne that's not what she
sounds like
Marco the balloonist
especially as well I won't say that
there's a two characters inspiring
franchise with like the trilogy with the
same name which is Sheila
which is a fun
and a kangaroo but here's the market
who's the balloonist and then there's
Marco he is a lion
have a lovely stream thank you for
sharing up I'll start it was fun it was
fun having you here

I think someone died
it wasn't me
just no I had nothing to do with that
this is
useful for a charge oh no
when I don't have the charge button
in that case I can do that
I think there are stuff here
I shouldn't mimic stuff
you have to redeem that first
you shoot so hard to lift off the ground
[Music]
oh wait what kind of animal sound this
these things don't make sounds
especially like you may make more like
animal sounds
so okay let me go and see if this area
has to Samsung
foreign

big purple dragon
yeah I mean
[Music]
yeah I need some health I think
I I think

oh I fell down
number game
there you go
I have to pick up everything
manually
funky Punk
I don't know how many times
hey if you charge him yeah he jumpsuits
yes
[Music]
so
you got other redeems to use as well
okay
he can write an English sentence and I
can say it in Swedish that was a tablet
yeah
you can change outfit
[Music]
he can redeem the animal sounds if I'm
on 11 a bit Morehead myself
this level doesn't really have much of
an animal sounds
the second spiral game
hey I want to make more sounds in that
one I should have picked up the key I
always forget
our Swedish is so cute if you want to
hear Swedish you can write a sentence
for me to say in Swedish with that
routine
it should
require you too so when you redeem it
it should require you to write a text
and then you write your text
and then that's it
okay let me go get some father this is
to be quite slow if I had to because
then I pick up the chips
oh
a pumpkin is a cute bunny okay I can say
that
insert canine
I said it it's lower and carefully
I can say it it will spin as well
so cute
try Canyon rewards good gliders you are
a good glider a Spyro I was born to
Glide
I was born again yes yes
trust me
anything on this side no and you decide
oh Sheamus
oh that's fine
I lost my voice at the same time
[Music]
if I was to make more noise
better let me take it
[Music]
I was sneezing so much I'm allergic to
this cake
also the title of this
dream is probably still
it's still inspiring for it
um
okay Spyro
[Music]
that's that's the title
spider he sneeze very cute okay
your advice is cute your sneeze is cute
you look cute
incredible Glide Spyro I thought I'd be
stuck here forever with those ugly
vultures standing on my head those words
might look tough but they're pretty
tasty flame broiled with a pinch of salt
yeah he was cut off but he came
oh
you're just super cute
no you're cute for calling me cute
I like to spray the enemies and they
just die but
doesn't look like a hit demon spiral
just
continues
as if nothing happened thanks
you're welcome
when you are very nice
didn't mean motivation
continue
these Hard Times such as not being able
to play The Independent game
yes please keep your flag it is red with
a black diamond
you'll see them maybe not all PSP
keeping levels but several
we can keep an eye out for that one
see what else we can find it
we can also cancel the key animation in
this game
and take animation
[Music]
and also
I guess that's me yeah I was talking to
another statement
on the home like
regarding announcing like my name
I'm not particularly picky with how it's
pronounced
but I mean if you do ask how it should
be pronounced it's on
but I have heard a lot of people saying
uh more like pump not not pump but
some somewhere in that between
[Music]
Park more like I think maybe maybe
that's a bit too much
he's being rude
pon pon
the bonbon
my team is here we got some enemies that
you cannot play for some reason
I mean
normally I know why you can't blame them
I mean like
I don't know when he's around they
should ask me able to paint them
I carefully sucked
okay
cute
Beyond Beyond
Beyond kids huh
it is a particularly
inch
[Music]
and what are these things like
[Music]
dinosaurs
dinosaurs dinosaurs
Nino sours
area
well I just ran past him
is that possible
he just didn't know where which way to
go
on both ways at the same time I got
stuck
you're so smart when knowing the Swedish
word for the dinos sword
wow how do you know this was a dinosaur
foreign
[Music]
how's the dragon supposed to Flame metal
armor anyway remember Spyro flame won't
harm metal but charging with your horns
that should do the trick
my flame can affect nothing in this game
as long as the metal in question is not
aluminum
thank you
yeah I am allergic to this game
[Music]
or a girl is another method if you can
Flame
but it cannot affect a aluminum
or
Steel
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I don't know
[Music]
English I mean
I've accidentally said that I don't
speak English too many times so it comes
automatically I I really mean I don't
speak English like natively
not immediately and
and that's basically I mean I don't
speak English natively
but for some reason I'll be short on it
I don't speak English
what are you doing
[Music]
here I come and then I get slapped
my English is okay
I think English is perfectly fine
as far as I've heard it
[Music]
spelling Wise It's perfectly fine too
there's some words might be wrong at
some point but that's probably due to
you
more than
your writing
the the gem just flew into that rock
my Spanish is better than English
your Spanish better than the whole thing
is next hey it's on the other side of
that River why don't you Glide there and
find out yeah why don't you can either
find out spider
I need to talk more that's still a
problem like I can understand almost
everything but speaking it's like I
would forget everything in a second
thanks
management I actually cannot judge your
Spanish
but yeah well uh yeah I
like
I've been learning English probably
since I've been 16 years old
but um
I never spoke it
I I'll probably like
even like age of 16 and I couldn't
really speak English fluently
I could understand it perfectly but my
pronunciation pronunciation there we go
and when I spoke English was incredibly
terrible and I couldn't really hold any
conversation in English
speak nice
because I never spoke English I had
never had a reason to speak English
[Music]
but then basically I spoke more English
just
to voice chat and stuff
and I got better at it and now I'm
streaming so I can have to
have finesse English so much competency
you've reached the highest point in
Cliff town you can get to almost
anywhere from here if I'm with you I'd
use that Whirlwind there
what should I use to wear with that
shouldn't this that my dad
sorry there's nowhere in there this
one's there
there's no it's not Monday
what should I use that's where I went
there because that's basically how he
face it anyway when kids I think that's
my thing I like to be picky
when
don't mind me I mean I'm not going to be
the picky about it when people speak
obviously not
but I mean they could have fixed the
time okay I guess
just I think it's funny
I don't know if you think he's funny
here's the flag Again by the way
I find it to be nice
I should find it kind of funny
and also your English again thank you
I have practiced a lot
I'm actually happy and it's better than
being able to but she is being wise
because then you have terrible Atmos
understanding it perfectly but cannot
speak
that's my life no no longer that's not
as long in my life
your advice is super cute yeah
should we have accounted
how many times
I didn't say that much
I mean I appreciate it
I wish I could give you some kind of
reward
I can't say it too often though there
must be some
something in between
[Music]
foreign
I think it's only this part left
okay
it's messing this up here
is that a one
please say it's amazing what a hundred
here's the Swedish redeem again if you
want to hear more Swedish you can write
along your sentences in one thing
some kind of way to control how much you
can pay
[Music]
but sadly there is
hey Spyro Sparks the dragonfly has been
doing a good job protecting you make
sure to keep him Strong by feeding him
lots of butterflies
he has protected me but I think most
of the job goes to me for avoiding
damage in the first place where's my
credit
I mean it's the same Sparks but I mean
and I'm I'm really grateful for you
staying around but
like
I want sounded at least
please I mean it's a team effort I avoid
the AJ it works protect me when I cannot
avoid Danger
I think that's fine
I will give you all the Credit One
give me your credit card wait
maybe not that good
do you have some kind of store I can get
credit in word of caution little one
wait until you grow big
me before charging those large enemies
quote is actually confusing several
people thinking that oh it's better guys
grow up or there's something to that
being being able to get larger or
something yeah just a misleading thing
he said
but I guess that's part of hints
it's not that hint it's just something
it says and then you have to figure out
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
welcome everyone
feel free to chat anything you want
yeah
I mean everything reason of course I
mean there are
but if a dragon
Pyro
some big norcs up ahead are wearing
armor and in the ice cave armor can make
their feet very slippery
I know
I can't um
no being naughty yeah only being naughty
within reason
I mean
minor suggesting like nothing explicit
[Music]
dance remember what I wrote In Me
yeah really regarding life
this channel is rated on Ancient
[Music]
at least for now maybe I have considered
like making it adult
allowing you to basically see anything
you want I'm not thank you for releasing
me
thank you for amazing me
yeah he's San Antonio
everyone's husband
I'm not naughty I'm good this kid
I need to pick up a key
I want to try to remember
because when I was very very little
at least I want to remember trying yeah
I think people try to do this job
but constantly faintedness
it is not even hard
it wasn't even that hard
I remember people tried that jump over
and over again
clicking
yeah I'm better I came now than that I
was a little bit it wasn't only me
trying that jump that was
[Music]
but I guess everyone had little
experience
and as soon as you insert the key the
whole thing explodes
[Music]
suddenly I didn't even lock it in the
first place but is it just
yeah
you put stuff in you close the lid to
knock it
take the key out and it's primed
next time you insert the key it will
explode
I don't believe in her chest
foreign
[Music]

does champ have a doctorate is that
what's coming in I mean
[Music]
what is it like a
make structure

[Music]
[Music]

[Music]
[Music]
which I do use to turn around
yes I feel that's great
um
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
and it tells us because of you into the
light
in that space flies kind of far through
it
could just let him feel like do the
whole thing
but that's the speed run technique make
sure that the ending
see this enemy
dies
when you exit this level that doesn't
happen again but anyway guys it also
stands to decide
does not change
already
keep them with the hearts around yeah I
wanted bunnies but they only have dogs
kittens well done Spyro keep up the good
work and I know you'll fulfill your
destiny destiny I just want to kick some
just toast those enemies and collect the
treasure
but I just want to kick some sand
that's such a bad word to say
[Music]
okay okay
no you're driving me again
a challenge
there you go turn around I tricked him
you have to be smarter than it
hairs
they need
full health
and then I
do this
that's actions
which explodes as soon as you insert a
key with the pain inside
I was too too quick for me to count but
I was missing that and I have everything
else this was 10.
no
no no double drowning
hair
did I say everything I did everything
I'm a kid bunny I did everything
same spiral
they use Spyro
yeah
do you feel the same as fire or do you
want to say inspire
my Inspire you want to save the game or
do you want to do you want me to recall
the dragons you can see
put the dragon hand crystallizing again
I can't believe you have fans you found
some much Stone and treasure
capital letters every word including the
tea income
that's a bit weird
I can't believe how fast you found so
much stolen Treasure of about 40 magic
Crafters world if you are ready
stay here go to magic Crafters say I had
a typo
yeah
I think so
it seemed so
you should have read written I had it
before
I had a Tupa
my thing is hard it is
I want to take that
oh now let's rescue this dragon
because he says it like that
welcome to Magic Crafters I want you to
release the dragons reclaim our treasure
and recover the eggs from those pesky
blue thieves
Crafters instead of Mandy Crafters
okay
I mean you can you can do a rolling
rolling B like this one
okay I wanted to see if I could
like that
there we go
[Music]
it worked
even though it doesn't seem much space
to put the camera there
[Music]
okay first off
you can cut in here because that one is
doing bad no problem
let's go back here
I don't know if you need to know
and then let's do things
bye
[Music]
again
let me go up here he comes into this
dragon
when you see arrows like these you can
charge along with them to begin a
supercharge
supercharge excellent go ahead try it
foreign
[Music]
trust me that was on purpose
and then we take the another message
and then we take the superstars and then
we basically the unboxing
and then we do that
easy peasy
yeah if you have trouble getting that AC
if you can do that
it is
the other game which I imagine a few
times
[Music]
oh yeah
let's see
again if you have trouble getting these
can you see this
oh
the physics is a bit wonky
the one he
CK
or
if you have trouble with this one
you can use this one
or you like that yes
[Music]
oh man that happens sometimes
yeah
what are you laughing at
[Music]
they should put something in your
background
[Music]
Alpine Ridge
Interlink Alpine Village
okay I remember this one being very
chain is Happy
Aya or what kind of slap was that
what do you think you are
about his voice I like it
[Applause]
but anything
noisy about
why you're doing something now
you might cut up there you can stay up
there
here's a question
have any of you ever stood on this
platform
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
treats
very pointy trees
continents
[Music]
the next question how many of you have
stood on this platform
[Music]
another dragon
he's saying
Spyro you're not afraid of those big
noisy gigantic awful beasts are you of
course not I didn't think so
I didn't think
I'm not sure if you even able to get up
on that one's a fair enough you've ever
been on that one
[Music]
no
nine minute Dragon you have wings
here
and then like I don't actually go back
here or something
[Music]
do something I want you to leave this
platform where I stand on it
I want to see
because we love me
[Music]
put a hands back
[Music]
I have Diet because I mean
[Music]
you start laughing
they are so strange
[Music]
the most strange creatures
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so anything else going on
oh thank you for releasing me
you're welcome
something
can you come up with something to add
so and nothing turn it up here
it was in self-defense I accidentally
fell down
me bent down accidentally again
[Music]
um
there we go
up and down
I have this game on Black Nation Oh
oh
that's suspicious
that's up to you
I don't know if that's hot
I just don't know how you're supposed to
pronounce it
[Music]
maybe it's Waterloo actually like
kangaroo
[Music]
well
how do you play Daddy skin
I'm going to play it a lot
is there anything I should look out for
great work Spyro if you keep this up
you'll learn all the tricks of the magic
crafter world
do you have any 10 points
[Music]
agent how did my paper
remember that these blue thieves haven't
stolen Eggs only in the magical world
don't worry I'll take care of them
I remember that I had picked up eggs in
other words no don't worry about that
and
[Music]
this is just me or that it seems so much
easier in this game
nice to meet him Audrey
[Music]
I like that foreign
should I have a redeem for this
I speak like this
there was no R in any of those words
in words
but I pronounce it more like words
that have to be
she needs to be words I actually
pronounce it R sound in
[Music]
what do your ass sound like yeah that's
a funny joke I want to talk about letter
okay
the r sounds are cool yeah
I went to the r but it sounds like Moon
[Music]
I mean if you think so
how about that oh wait I failed how
about the three the
founder I'm not that good at making it
it is the easiest in the
beginning of whether
but yeah it is awesome it's used in I
don't remember what language it is but
it's actually used in
in that one at least one language
well I know it wasn't your word for
and that word is the word for jaw in
this language which is
simply there we go that's the word
simply and that's kind of the glimpses
that I can do to pronouncing it
so there you go and he's so cute
he's so cute making strange sounds wait
I should do this I'm doing this the
wrong way
and I already messed up look at this
what are these things they're like
anyway
when I was young only I mean time
I took this path
because I placed my fears I had no fears
these things
quite creepy actually
especially winning Jason
but I still took this path yes
that was crazy
[Music]
and I guess they're doing anything is
past because then he gets this dragon
and then it's fire safely finally I hate
those bugs when I become big and strong
like you I'll squash them all until then
remember that supercharge makes you
invincible
when I become big and strong
and like you
I'm gonna squash them on okay
with this sad squatting
and then I take this super charge
and then I basically did this
wait your own space very deep
Hey where's my tip
well salute
when you slide it
slide it across it
painting bag smooth
yeah
I am no fan
I don't like
I have no phobia for bugs and not like
that but
I'm not like scared of them or anything
but I don't like them
running around in my house
and then I climb up here
wow
and then go up here nice all right
I don't have much uh
my arms are quite silent there you go
that's another one of those tips
in my native Swedish finally
all right there's no timer in this game
they introduce the timer later
[Music]
and outside her dress is different
the one should not start stress into
reunited
Christ has something for me to do
you don't ask me what I'm doing
I wanted to see if I can see if I can
play on this
amazing
they're like too far away
[Music]
foreign
three quarters of the lap
thank you
back up I can still be able to drop
pressing the drop button and just have
them releasing and don't lift me in my
wings my wings are the sensitive okay
too fast
it's not serious enough
um
[Music]
let's see if this works in the original
person is
[Music]
try combining super charge with jumping
and gliding and really explore the high
caves
thank you
and no yeah no thank you I will not I
will do this
he said it's really nice that's it my
Spanish
yes
done well for me
I mean I'm like
[Music]
yeah
I can give it one more try
because I'm still curious
and I can't die soon
[Music]
I guess it's not faster
so espanol is
make sure you spend
practice
now what are you doing what do you do
what are you doing
because I don't know about oh yeah I
don't know what that word is it doesn't
look Spanish to me
Spanish in Spanish
you can use one of these if you want but
that's his point
that's what's funny
that was actually so nice thing about
that that means you are Spanish sounds
really good yeah that's I love this
other questions
after correct doesn't know the
difference between you are and newer
oh yeah it sounds in that sentence and
that is
oh yeah oh yeah
[Music]
can I do
well well
Yuko
really hard
[Music]
okay I need to like
not guys High
okay why what why say hi our family
Let's ignore that
Let's ignore that with him and just
continue the level
Target
two
that was fun wasn't it
what's gonna happen
excuse me what are you doing
it's a
bit
hello
science
please do something about these green
Druids they insist on moving everything
in sight
right
all right I can't do that I'm dying
that was a terrible jump
that was wait wait what happened there
The Edge is kinda
yeah the edge
and she's swimming for me
it looks like they're going away now so
this kind of the reverse it is
[Music]
my second plane is
and messing up
I am constantly messing up
[Music]
oh yeah yeah now I remember
now I have remembered this one place
I've got
remember the place I forgot but I forgot
did you like that
so one minute
me saying
one a minute of me using the sound
[Music]
great they do drop them in this game but
they don't track them anything I did
baby wrong
that's better
not so much wrong in there there's so
many in
correct inconsistency
[Music]
but returning home the pressure's around
the total treasure
four thousand one hundred
steam of a single hour within those now
your name is done
to
fly I remember when I was a young dragon
earning my wings Learn to Fly got it
thank you
[Music]
have you got to do it that in pyramid
for flying
did you ever happy action
what I wanted them
[Music]
foreign
and as far as I remember
and there are only two of spring chests
with the pink
gems in the normal levels there are a
bunch of them in
[Music]
a place that is not part of the game
pilot ahead
but okay nearly normal gameplay
[Music]
and but of course the red one is much
best because there's only one of them
but I do think that the
ink should get some recognition for only
being two of it
still not special in
let me try
let's do the crystal for light restart
other people
thank you
now should I do this
let's do the normal way
[Music]
s
he clapped his wings and then nothing
he really liked it he actually lives up
[Music]
which I do find useful looks like
[Music]
myself
you're confusing myself
this is ruining my flight speak
[Music]
nice black pink
[Music]
[Music]
too much things
[Music]
oh there's this one
okay
I can't find it
there's one of them
and there's something
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
and this is the special ponton Park in
this level
[Music]
that's extra
no it's the same time ran out as I was
connecting that one
that's my final
[Music]
because that's the thing yeah
when you
behind there so
when you collect one of these that adds
the timer here's a bit of an animation
and if the timer reaches zero during
that animation because it only adds the
time to it adds to your time when I'm
even nervous
so if the timer is zero one animation is
still happening
and the part of Extinction is okay this
is
the counter would stop at Sierra but it
technically still counts into the
negatives it just doesn't explain
negatives
it just says zero and then when it
finally adds
[Music]
yeah I should probably pick up this is
just before I want to find the activity
finder it adds to that
negative memory
so even though
it might add a plus three it might like
count from one and a half seconds
because it takes one and a half seconds
since it had reached there
if that makes sense and why does my
English like that
I dreaded before but anyway I read it
again because
let's see
thank you fairy goodbye Faye
[Music]
oh
and I said yeah that's awesome
[Music]
don't ask me what I'm doing
I'm
I'm doing weird stuff
2014. so it's been technically three
hours now but I said that I would
probably do like in bonus hour or
something
thank you
[Music]
I am unorganized
it's a bird area
because you have to kill here and then
you have you cannot do anything
[Music]
go down there
oh thank you thank you that's awake
[Music]
breakfast
foreign
[Music]
you see that
I was gonna in the air forever
[Music]
goodbye little God
[Music]
am I supposed to go because
[Music]
that's the other
in the other research we said yeah
[Music]
let's continue
I feel like spices during your time on
them
I don't know
oh I got the fact
I got the tagged again I almost got
attacked again
[Music]
but I do like the light effect here
[Music]
oh yeah yeah I rescue you even though
the lights make sense because the arrows
are light blue and they like to scare
them welcome to wizard Peaks this is my
favorite supercharged spot use it to
bash those Wizards
oh if that's why it's your favorite spot
coming foreign
[Music]
[Music]
if people are winning to experiment
these things can do
[Music]
huh
I'm over here
[Music]
that is four eight
and eleven and there's one more and I
know what it is they're there
oh no I should have oh
no wait I can do it this is what I want
to do
because if you if you kill this one
early
all those up here
apparently I've heard that you can see
that one early in reignited I mentioned
it again okay and those remaining stuff
but not spawn and that you cannot get a
chance thank you for releasing me
if that is trim on the terrible terrible
inside this is something that they
should have considered if you have a
scene that spawns things that you need
to get rid of to get the reward 100 you
obviously have to make sure that what
happens if this thing that spawns things
gets removed too early
it happens but there are many things it
should respond this should spot
to me it seems like an obvious thing to
check but
[Music]
I don't know maybe they didn't have time
to check
Russian name
and which is fair to the back it's not
fair too
[Music]
[Music]
I need the light tap and the charge
button and it does a little
it kinda understood
I thought I played it
okay here's last one
and that's that's what happens while
when you get the egg wondering
you die
that is a thing again completely like
this that's a scene they actually did
fix because
they do have the egg animation but if
you are I think it's like if you're in
the air it does not play The Academy
meaning that in that situation
situation
yeah
oh what did you do that for
Communications
[Music]
and I should be on gems I hope
listen carefully Spira there's a secret
area in the Artisan home it is at the
waterfall try jumping on the stones
there Artisan home waterfall sounds good
in there done that
oh no
I am missing a chance
oh no what did you connected
why am I a stupid one
[Music]
um
I've had one seen a purple gem
from the water
wait I know where purple gem is
found it
[Music]
hello kitten are you still there
[Music]
no what are you doing
[Music]
what that what am I doing this very
question
I was in the air
it doesn't count when I'm in the air I
doesn't like
yeah I forgot I got this worms
I played the challenge for avoiding
panic in these arms I guess
being amazing thieves having that fun
friends
oh
come on
[Music]
why am I missing half again
[Music]
Eminem
[Music]
where can I green and a red hiding
I know I wanna bring good dining
but I'm pretty sure I picked that one up
because it's hiding here and people
usually miss it
in reignited due to the tall grass
so I've actually seen
one streamer who was missing just one
green
and
make me complain that
and what was that
like if I was
oh wait they are here of course
of course they were there silly me
[Music]
look at this lamp
[Music]
it's not even attached anymore
let me put this one here and who didn't
see this
I mean it's not even
it's not the evening I can't get out of
it
[Music]
that's something that is
finally this magic
I fell through it
is Magic Crafters
why haven't I seen
[Music]
but why haven't I seen this before I
look it's not even close
ish
the
thing she's never seen before I never
stopped and just looked at the
environment and seen things like this
however
when the lab was nice and I think the
spot would be nice but it should at
least put it against the walls
[Music]
blue heart
and it probably doesn't 100 and then
there's like 300 tens or something in
this level
now let's challenge their heart
their heart is an easy box you could say
that you'd lose
like big clouds
[Music]
I'm picking up
I miss asking
a little too much
it never happened
[Music]
oh my
yeah this but okay actually hello how it
is a bit more aggressive here
to me that looks like a due to how
long it is
it looks like a very long and Ruby that
Beach
and causing the wind and thunder scene
I wouldn't be surprised if it was a
combination of like a whirlwind and a
bird
but looking at reignited which is
probably based on the
that's releasing me Sparrow
have no idea
trapped in Chris
who are you again
um I'm out of here you've been trapping
crystal in about two hours
that's how long you've been trapped in
there
yeah ah wearing bird combination
wouldn't make would make sense but the
irinaited made it very clear it
disappeared
a very long beard but I'm still unable
to see into this original
and these enemies
you cannot charge
is that true for this game as well
you cannot charges
so they even included
it's not weird why can't you charge them
I mean they do look bigger than the
regular dreams
but
is that enough for them to not be
chargeable
because can I join my identity how much
I'm dressing
look at the beard
being appeared
yeah it's up here
but I never get to see that it's up
close
[Music]
his face is just
device some hairs and green hair some
nose a long beard and then they like to
lose the arms and a half
that's his life
foreign
[Music]
dragon eggs
already
it's just how everyone is capitalized
which although it's me when I try to
read it
this balloonist
is the only one that can bring you to an
actual level instead of a next word
if you don't have enough eggs
but you have connected to X in the this
Homeworld he said it tells you that he
can bring you to a level with an egg and
then you can jump aboard the balloon and
then you can land in an actual level
this game is as buggies reunited no he's
not it's quite it's great
but it has it eats bread sometimes
like this one is supposed to trigger
finally so there you go another issue
because it it is supposed to trigger and
show you that this electric floors are
dangerous
time to listen to spider being sad
nasty norc is turning off Swamp into an
electrified junk keep and it used to be
so beautiful
I'm sure it was
I don't know how I should be in that
point
I'm sure it's worse
I've got something new challenges
like I'm not sure if you tell any truth
or not
was it beautiful
maybe it was
I don't care I'm Spyro
and I got five thousand but one trenches
hello
goodbye
oh
I got State back
should attack peace
heaveness chickens
I don't know how it should
what kind of existence is this
you have like feathers at the end of
their wings
by the way and back of the time and
that's day
that's their existence
they live like that
[Music]
[Music]
and I don't judge them
except that kind of did judged him but
let's take note that I did Judge them I
don't judge them
because
that is
I will kill you for that
you set a purpose for me
is that chatting
that judged its life's existence
[Music]
that was a huge
attacking someone like hydrogens
hello
[Music]
it's challenge make sure that every
level which has at least 200 gems of
course
has a multiple of 100
which is at least 100 is a series not
valid
um
and it's not and not all gems so every
level of 200 inside 100
but levels with 300 gems you can click
100 or 200.
I'm tired I have stupid ideas
don't mind me
a floor
watch out Spyro
the norcs in these parts have discovered
the power of electricity oh you don't
say it really stings
oh it's things you say
yeah
I touched it
anything
foreign
I don't really get the point of this
idea
that area over there
I guess it's if you miss the big
platform and land behind it you have
something left on
the point of it
wow
I'm dying
I need some fatless chickens
wait how do you second judge your lives
once again
a full hands are healthy spikes
the price
that's how I take care of them you just
rush through the other area
okay
thank you
I go here
oh yeah made back down
actually go there
good job Spyro one day you'll be able to
tell all the dragons about your Amazing
Adventures
sure but what I'd really like to do is
get out of this swamp
I want to get out of this swamp things
it is way too smoky
maybe you should get those
I forgot that you cannot go here
then you have to go through this eye
again and that's when I picked this
stuff up
anything
James I get all the gems and I fall off
the living
do you know that
didn't happen just your eyes
if you close your eyes
[Music]
no let's hit something
Fiesta just
nice yeah my only guess is that if you
drive too fast somehow or if you like
one second now I don't know it's nothing
down there
I did understand why it's still here no
instant to ask you
no doesn't even have bigger or whips
again
[Music]
thank you
nope
[Music]
okay that
okay
foreign
[Music]
I'm feeling terribly at the moment
the game
I mean you relax too but let's not dwell
on that
anyway
another normal texture and a squishy
texture
[Music]
can I say here too
okay can I do this now
all right it was I just completely
failed this step because it's very very
easy example just completely changes for
some reason
everything except they're awesome
okay Rocky's taken care of
depending over here what running up 11.
you have to remain gems
and then I only have that
remaining area
slow at eating butterflies
if that's another change I like which we
ignited
when
spark starts eating a butterfly every
other butterfly in the vicinity is
immediately eaten
so in that case when I gain two
butterflies but it was Green
that means that he would have eaten one
of them immediately turning him blue
immediately and then he was changing the
other one and then he turns yellow
400
that's how it works
if you were curious
I don't think anyone was the very
curious about that
[Music]
suspicious plan we never have to be
suspicious of plants looking like that
and have it again
just be suspicious about that
[Music]
Peak
you're so smart
you think so
that's nice of you to see so
I just showed me
says that I've played too much lips it
turned black
yes I know so
you know that I am smart
I played it is it well
I don't have anything bro it's great to
see you but I've got to go
okay I have nothing attached to
yes bits
and so
don't mean
it
[Music]
is nothing a patient
[Music]
but this thank you for trying it looks
so weird cheer 100.
[Music]
yeah I haven't even set up the big
question
[Music]
well I guess you get the most she has
bad stuff because that's what he wanted
and I guess I should maybe in that case
excited this no it's fine it's fine you
do as you want
your food
and I appreciate everything
no time
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
where's my
there it is
jump to get into why isn't that the case
for most of these
I need to say
[Music]
foreign
that was weird
he's so happy
breadless chicken
it's free
but it's too stupid to understand the
screen I guess it doesn't have to like
feel anything because like
whole cage was destroyed
it can work whatever it wants look at
these things
then that's kind of like bunnies
they got like these bhakti sauce
they got like
three years but
of course four of them
with 40 more years
spider always about to die again
[Music]
let's see
[Music]
spironism has yeah
yeah he needs some help
no he definitely needs to help
this makes your life he doesn't do his
house there
like in Navy Kings
yeah I cannot get behind you
he needs some more meat
why did I add more he didn't write more
you need some milk
Maybe
he needs some milk
[Music]
and this is now I
Thomas is n't dirty
to write something
I could dream
I guess this is my
[Music]
interns okay
stream of notes doing like four hours
be on the lookout for attack frogs they
are cold-blooded Killers attack frogs
and this used to be such a nice swamp
foreign
but it would be really nice that if you
like
complete 11 100 that after that it
transforms into like
once what they call the nice one
about the word is actually supposed to
look like
your streams are so nice to watch I like
seeing more videos
I'm happy to make you happy
it seems that make me happy
yeah I do feel better making streams
it has helped me
being environmentally
345
2014 2019. let's see
one more game again
can I do this without taking damage
I did that without taking a knife
that one
oh well that's right
thanks for releasing me it seems like
I've been trapped in here since I was
your age no no why I remember
gotta go
oh no another dramatic Elder Dragon when
you've been trapped like
three hours now
come on
oh you're like your own things
it's been three hours even not trapped
since you're like a baby dragon I don't
think she's a baby dragon but
opportunity they ever say that
but please speak where's my butterfly
I need a tan I like making it happy
I'm happy about
how far you've come in your videos
you're doing so well how much this price
of fire she got gotten with my videos
[Music]
I gotten for
52 63 which is 19.
I
touched five subscribers
it's amazing
[Music]
it is amazing
let's see now that I should say
something but
in contact with an artist you might be
able to do emails it's not it's not a
guarantee it's not an agreement or
anything
so it doesn't mean it will happen but it
might
thank you for releasing me
I'm only had to say
I came all the way here
but this is exactly
cannot be mad if you ever saying thank
you
you're welcome
I like helping you getting free
I mean everyone else said like
it's stories to tell
me
you wouldn't even know that to be fair
if I didn't know
yeah this area is a little easier with a
airplane
okay this is my sparkly's room
I'm so happy for you you're doing
awesome
thank you
hydrate
they are doing like four hours
in my time
I'll tell you what
to stand them out and squish them and
squat them
uh-huh how about charge them and Flame
them we are dragons after all
he's like
I don't know how to scare that reaction
[Music]
I I don't know how to hey
hmm
that was my sound
my fading sound
the gems
so cute this
jumps are definitely hard in this game
then
the United but that's because the United
had that little extra scene that happens
when you almost make it happening
[Music]
oh yeah there are many yes
be quick enough I guess they don't know
they dumped me
okay come on I want that
[Music]
oh yeah there we go
is that everything
is so much [ __ ]
that's sick [ __ ]
look at these squares
you can't even see the exercise I have
to make like a blind jump here
what kind of edge is that anyway
cute sounds like
they've got Tiny Wings
so cute
you know his level is time for now
it's the level that starts with t and
ends with three tops
next one
[Music]
here it is Texas so small in this game
they like or is it like the gates that
are huge
maybe both
or is it spiders are small
agency or anything let's see
can I do this lemon 100 without mine or
taking damage
all right
all right
looks so small
and satisfy that I can
go
okay not taking damage yes I figured out
[Music]
so now if does this mean I can die once
[Music]
is weird
[Music]
it's always like someone is
I was gonna say pressing keys randomly
but it's not really her
can you
press kick again
that was weird greeting spiral for an
amazing tour of the Treetops don't just
stop at one supercharge
three things yeah 55 dragons here we go
let's go
[Music]
[Music]
that was sadness
hey what happened
what happened to my charge
what happened to my charge
[Music]
what happened to my charge
one more try
that's it I'm back online again I
haven't there at the single time
what
what happened
I am confused
I think I'm flying over how it's super
sharp at least all you have to do is
touch it like at the end of even a
chance
thank you
that was quite a ride Spyro you've
learned a lot since you were a young
glider yeah well you could have found an
easier spot to get stuck
Shrek
people are confused about which path
they should take to get those stuff but
but what you actually have to do is
obviously no that's the wrong word uh
you have to keep up with the exits
that's the first challenge you need to
be able to transfer first the level fast
enough to enable I couldn't just cut on
the sleeves and when you can keep up
with the thieves which is possible that
is rich
um
when where did you keep up with them
showing that you actually are able to
reverse the level quite well you can
just follow them and then through that
determine which path you're supposed to
take
so when I managed to complete a Treetops
to 100 I didn't use any guides I didn't
get any tips from everyone I was all on
my own
and where's my drag bench I'll take it
I but that was because as I said I
followed disease and by following the
thieves I could see which parts they
took and they basically told me which
path I had to take to get to this area
so that's how you do it
foreign
like if you manage to
[Music]
yeah
you see that she jumps over here
you jump over here to follow the seat
and you see the spark of the sea
and then you see jump over here so you
jump over here
and yeah
and now you have the solution now you
know which parts to take
so
now you don't need to follow these
thieves anymore it doesn't know where to
go
positive anything is
until it reaches his destination that's
by Design
[Music]
so that's some cool tricks
Spyro if you jump at the end of a
supercharged ramp you can really go far
I'm all over it
your neck can go really far apparently
the Dragon
[Music]
there you go
stop flat to stop running spider stop
running
you had no you had no reason to continue
running through that so far
[Music]
hello
[Music]
oh you know what it sounds okay and now
I don't have any orbs anymore can I keep
this
you jump really high which makes it
funny because I've watched other
streamers
they're barely jump it on
I'm not sure what how what they're doing
and how's that that's so slow
it's like they're walking
could probably catch up with them by not
even charging
[Music]
nothing that's not possibility
[Music]
I think the collected last games
which I get by instead of turning at the
super charge I just go forward
[Music]
like that
[Music]
there we go
and that's it 500 500.
I totally didn't die a single time
[Music]
that did not happen at all
you never die in the level
never happened
not sure what anyone would
even suggest that I would die in that
heaven
eat the bug okay
thank you kitten
I have practiced a lot
[Music]
okay these lines are hard to see because
they're too far away
yeah this is a beast package marks
no just more stuff here
[Applause]
wait
I don't think that's the sound event
[Music]
what are you doing forever
[Music]
do you like the goo or something
[Music]
apparently he likes to do
that was cute
at the heart
it's a hard hearty camera
now
all right yeah
the camera
I miss a champ
yeah
wait when you get there
Whirlwind this is when you talk today
or something
I feel much better now that's so many
dragons has been rescued not being the
balloon and the eye I'll show you the
three Weavers world now I'm staying here
[Music]
okay not not this Blacklist I did
sit hot so you had to
talk to the balloonists
wait so I do still have to keep
okay uh
don't sleep up the edge
unless I tell you do not slip off the
edge you slipped off the edge
I'm just not paying attention
[Music]
I am now just being
jackpot in there
yeah
anyway
it's I slipped off again
no no
no
it is
[Music]
imagine having a perm for a level that's
something
[Music]
this word will have the most
actually having a per level discount
from the darkest Sun
it would be over a hundred wait
are you insulting my skills
sounds like you're
smells like you think I'm I'm just that
I saw it
uh I'm sorry that sounded mean
[Music]
I mean you said that I die a lot so I
mean
yeah
it was me
you're amazing kids
I mean I could be cute without being
amazing
[Music]
hey that didn't work game is fine
Vision game
I never
I think this one is
because I died
I'm ready for
the meat
there yeah
me doll head
I know it's metal heads
I know it's metal heat okay
this is the only boss battle with health
in the spiral one
none of the others boss battle has Hills
hello
hey NASA
the first
gospel has the unique dance technique
requires it two times
the second boss battle has those unique
charging enemies with fully metal I
think journey I don't think there exists
on another level
this third boss battle does not have a
single unique enemy unless you want to
count the wizard you cannot charge
everything
oops I didn't mean to do that there we
go
and so yeah that one doesn't happen
specifically models for that
level this one doesn't really have any
unique enemies they do have the metal
version of an enemy
but it doesn't have any
yeah it doesn't have a unique model it
just has it just has the metal effect
light to it
hello
hello
[Music]
look at this
there is a hole in the fence
it's almost like there's a lack of
Defense
that's the sparkly thing
there is a hole in your defense
[Music]
since the fence comes from the word
fence
I don't know what to do
comes from
like how it makes the maniac defense
when combined I'm gonna prefix I guess
the United States
[Music]
but yeah I'm learning languages the
language teacher didn't know that
Swedish doesn't have a word for
and learning a language
only has a word for teaching not
learning learning in general not
specifically learning a language I mean
English doesn't have one for that either
Swedish does not have a generic word
we just does not have a word a verb more
specifically for learning
Swedish only has some word for teaching
yes that's right there you go the
Swedish word for teaching is Lara
so it's it's related to the English word
learn like that's that's what as far as
I can tell it is the English will learn
but it has the meaning of teach
Swedish does not have a word with the
meaning of land
so if you want to say learn
you have to say teach yourself like
teach myself I will teach you
[Music]
I mean you say that
now you say teach myself yeah
it's really so cool I mean I know she's
I mean having two separate words is a
cool feature I guess but having a single
word kind of shows that even though you
lack a certain word you can still make
it up by
[Music]
using different phrases so yeah
you say teach myself I will teach myself
that means like I will learn
this big robot is all charged up to meet
you attacking the power pole should
disrupt its power supply
thanks for telling me exactly how I
should defeat this boss while no other
one tells me how I should repeat their
those classes
[Music]
oh come on
hi it's getting power mode
[Music]
oh no spiral is dead
I will attack the pumpkin
I mean I speak as well English as you
you listen to my grammar
so there you go that's why I
accidentally say that I will teach you
another list wait that's how we actually
said English but in Swedish when I say I
will teach you because you have the
teach you part it's basically
you will learn by me or something
because Swedish doesn't have the two
different words because you don't really
need the two different words because you
already got meaning from teaching
I don't know how the spell in English
neither do I
that wasn't that bone to destroy
[Music]
why did I do that
hello
I should have stand still and take a hit
it's like this probe that easy to hit
anything I'm a surprise
elephant
oh wait I did pick those up
oh thank you for nothing me
[Music]
I know he destroyed the last one himself
and look what he did
he died
[ __ ]
[Music]
if you want to know another cool thing
in Swedish
I don't know it's a cool thing
if I've been down
so
I need to hide it I don't have
what's up
this this area is considered very hard
to reach
and it is basically almost impossible to
reach they made it easier and ignited
yeah but there's nothing there so you
don't have to go there I mean there's
something there in the original version
this is the European version of game
where they moved of CMS because they
thought it was brutally hard to get
there
but since they made it easier to get
their reignited they placed their gems
back over there because that's where
they originally placed
it would be interesting to make like a
European version of
I reignited which I kinda have done
uh China but I'm it's more like it's not
really the power version of to be
ignited
because it's more like
[Music]
actually didn't done more it's like
changing the English to being British
English
responsing it's not it's not just
changing the words it's just changing
the spell
ing is doing a long stream while I need
to catch and sleep have a fun yeah I've
been going on before happy stuff
technically I want to play this game for
three hours
I remember missing what am I missing one
chance

stream check Saturday
