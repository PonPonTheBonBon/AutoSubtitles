president until now
there we go that's a good twist
[Music]
it's kind of where I left off
the current thing I want to resolve is
that the bow goes through the air and I
wanted to
it's some way Latin
if that's a good way I'm screaming it
I guess it's hard to see but
this scam
[Music]
I want the curve to be less
let's see it's Gonna Keep streaming
[Music]
have any curve to be less is exaggerated
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
uneven
can you like that
if he's getting away
I mean that might help a bit
what's that all my head did it for now
my neck pumpkin is steaming
so next step would there for me to
plan out
everything in the mirrored
except this one
I think that's everything
[Music]
Okay so
[Music]
I'm really trying to yeah but that was
supposed to
[Music]
they eat my head anymore he needs to do
on this month
so I will check my
[Music]
no
uh it's not a Spiderman
freshman
and notes there you go
making his dress round through this
clipping which kind of what they've done
so far
thank you
[Music]
make the tablet smaller
and it's really just skipping out your
fingers because the fingers are thicker
but that's related to this mesh
quick Scamp on face yes there isn't one
gap on the fence which is right
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
I just wanted this
this matches can
when I get I guess this I've taken not
merge them here
[Music]
I can clear that the move that up and
then like
waiting novels
[Music]
[ __ ]
that man hasn't down
I don't want to miss this one which has
two points
[Music]
so
remove this up
[Music]
then I'll move this up roughly now
[Music]
and this one should be moved up by
[Music]
that amount
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
that's the Gap fixed
[Music]
[Music]
that means I can now
[Music]
merge by distance
and now the Gap is gone
[Music]
beautiful
[Music]
the next part
getting to work on the textures
[Music]
and then when it comes to textures
which is no one's here the furnace here
dreamy is lurking
this back uh
some other people was was interesting
showing up very interesting asleep or
something yeah that's fine
so what I'm thinking
I wonder how this sound this sounds like
in my voice might sound a bit more
inkling now
and then we're cleaning up his room
we're saying that if there's any issues
with these things just let me know
answer this material until you want
everything that's
signed two
foreign
the textures at hand
the same thing applies to both spiral
and crash but kinda different results
and for different reasons it's basically
or the full character including
electrical body and clothing you can
basically only have one texture
of course it is probably the certain
ways you could go around it but there's
a lot of extra work but
an enormous
normally easier modding only one picture
there are different effects layers
that's an interesting thing
actually it does make me a bit curious
[Music]
because there is one note
this one mesh in the game that has two
materials
but
um
and there is a few with too much yeah
multiple materials actually this one
with glass and like and stuff
and I didn't wonder how those are
handled
so let's bring up
this window okay
it's beautiful we know here
player
go kill content
Kings so if you just look at the default
skin
now
now
like this here
number of materials a single one
wait is it called
interesting
this is what doesn't it show up here
thank you
that's interesting
[Music]
cocoa
[Music]
systems Jonathan
[Music]
bones to remove busy prioritize
interesting
[Music]
but it doesn't
remove tail
let me see
material but
[Music]
why does it say
uh doesn't say here that's not good
[Music]
when and then in that case
[Music]
I just have to look into different
subscribe
[Music]
which is
this one
[Music]
plugins
characters there
[Music]
cocoa
I don't know switch
that's this
Maybe
that's
that wasn't what I was looking for
okay this should be I purpose this
button
make sure stop
however
one of yes I press this button there we
go there's a lot of taste
but
what we can find here
there's a lot of text
but
here it actually says four bones
too empty but to filled out that's more
than what they understand
okay here we go here is where it starts
there's a skeleton
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
lots of lots
the word is
[Music]
this is interesting
no I'm pretty sure it was in this one
information
but
it's
no
strange
and it's not this one
foreign
actually
and would be a really strange update to
the game too because I'm pretty sure
the material name is supposed to be body
[Music]
[Music]
well
this was strange
[Music]
I guess it doesn't matter
[Music]
but
um
so how do you texture so
I guess I didn't find what I was looking
for
but yeah
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
texture increase
the same in spiral
which means that
a
postponent body and
[Music]
and the clothes must be on the same
texture
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
okay
[Music]
we need to exported in Years anyway
that's interesting
research I set it to
[Music]
give me a moment
[Music]
[Music]
export as
[Music]
it was set to export by sea I see
that's just the error
[Music]
when
just have to export it again
[Music]
[Music]
not much exciting business
let it know that it has
[Music]
[Music]
oh yeah
[Music]
and then moving the fines
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
now I can actually open these
yes there you go
so let's bring this up on screen as well
whether I have that not nowhere okay
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
let me asked
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
but there are more than one Taxi
because this is the scene
I create a folder for C
in addition to see there's F the
which looks like this
foreign
but this one I do know this is m
and this verse stands for metallic stuff
the next one is
because this is the normal map
next one is awesome
it's R for roughness
[Music]
and finally it's
easy for it right you know
I actually don't know
one didn't get properly made
so I receive
this one
to my one-pon mod
that's the same with this textures
nothing fancy
so here's here's some planning planning
this whole thing out
I will have a body
basically all of these girls in there
[Music]
and then I will split the whole texture
in half
okay
I can see me know that
two pieces of red
foreign
[Music]
there
[Music]
[Music]
so here is where the body should go
[Music]
so I just need to
[Music]
map that out
but let's get aha
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
a temporary base I guess
okay what should I
guess I'll just say this
[Music]
what the name of the station
I'm sure I didn't can't go into blending
and then open
and there you go
it's not means I can map out
the whole thing here
which can be a chicken
you might expect
ways it like this
foreign
oh yeah
oh yeah I need to find that way to do
that
apparently does do that every texture in
the other way
now I should have some function in
blender where I can Mark like
keep keep
save like the position of these vertices
but
recalculate the rest
that makes sense
like that's not what I want no and I
want this to be in there
this this mess
and then then there's these
which is something
thank you cameras unwrapped but then
what does that that's
not exactly what I want
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
against
[Music]
let's see
[Music]
I don't want to exchange modes
[Music]
I guess
these
[Music]
should do it more once
[Music]
they interactively
like that
[Music]
I had like a scene down back side
[Music]
and between there
foreign
this is more
along the line of what I'm looking for
[Music]
the size of diet
[Music]
I'm not sure it's like there
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
this is supposed to be a seam here
[Music]
I'm not too big ah that was weird
what's up
foreign
[Music]
like that
[Music]
let's jump to do it
[Music]
um
[Music]
[Music]
damage it
didn't
yeah I wish it didn't expand over C
okay
so now I got this stuff
[Music]
and this stuff should be attached in
some way
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
s
oh
[Music]
yeah I'm with my stable
[Music]
is
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yeah it should be this way
I think
[Music]
now this should go in this way
this is this one and this should go
there
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
me
[Music]
is this dragon
why is that one
oh
[Music]
so like that
now it's too many
[Music]
[Music]
it's not
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
can yarn
[Music]
fine
thanks
what's going on
okay let's see if I can oh what a mess
y
can yeah
the second can be between me
we have a lot of fish
can I yeah
and then you can I have any
notifications
I wish I could like see which Corners
which I can do but like going into dark
here I can see it's not coming
it should be that corner sliding out and
now it gets tip to get it
can also test it by doing that same
thing
to stick together and they didn't
I mean the Discord sugar instead and now
let's stick together
and then wait two
initial honor signs
foreign
thank you
then it's just emptiness down here
a bit greatly
but that's that's because I'm very
very picky with just hit it right
yes
all right
that means I've closed this whole Loop
may I have a better thing
there are people who said that I have
patience
I'm not the one
all right to easily give up
from which I see
thanks to my patience and let's just
make them here
so as far as as I can see this part is
still here
but then when you go up
around this part
that's what's up here
and nowhere else
[Music]
now it should be dark down here because
it's
sticks down here
[Music]
and being
anything
so
[Music]
and then there's that signs here
and we can see that
is that side time dark
so you can determine which side should
go away
[Music]
all right
yeah and and then they started working
in
and then finally it's
is the middle part
okay but more
this
fun stuff stuff here
[Music]
so they can use the middle part
[Music]
but if that part
and then with that button yeah
[Music]
please
[Music]
um
again this one should go with that
[Music]
oh
I'm going to deselect it
[Music]
[Music]
up I flip this around that's the way
[Music]
and then
it's just that part left
which is this part
[Music]
so I'll have to figure out now it says
which point goes where
I can simply do by clicking hair and see
that those girls together in those
and that was pretty simple
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
then I just go
the whole life around
[Music]
[Music]
and again
[Music]
and the eye has been repaired
but
it could probably be a bit more balanced
as this instance
foreign
[Music]
that's interesting
[Music]
[Music]
and what have imagined there being one
but
connecting nuts
[Music]
[Music]
um
[Music]
one of the sausage broccoli please
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
when it comes to texting
this is the year map that basically
tells them around the texture it should
lead
based uh for all these vertices if that
wasn't brownies
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
polygons of the cinema
laying out
but of course what I need and so that
means that
which you might be able to see here
it might be a bit tricky to see actually
on stream
you might
I wish I could make it more obvious in
much more amazing and you can eat as you
can see the pixels in the picture
[Music]
the more
pixels like
this Square does not contain many pixels
which I think is that square yes
which means that that
this this polygon it does not have many
pieces drawn it and you can kind of see
in pixels it's blurred here there's a
way to unlearn it
how do
you know having it not planned might
actually be a good thing here
well
this is big
[Music]
okay
adjust that let me see
might be easier to work
yeah maybe I should start cycling like
sharp pixels
how can I keep low resolution textures
pixelated yes this is what I'm looking
for
[Music]
oh here we go
[Music]
linear closest
no it's pixelated
the options we have is closest it's just
Sharp
linear it gets blurry
we can apparently calculated quite a lot
sir
cubic does make it more blurry makes
tries to hide the pixels anymore
I'm smart is
here we can use
put clothes inside top
yeah because this is this is the
blurriest
less blurry
and not learn at all
anyway and this means that for you
because I want a sharp edge between
these two parts to get that I of course
need
[Music]
more pixels for me between these two
[Music]
I'm getting some random modeling tips
here hello
foreign
[Music]
these things and you have a different
display name or whatever it is
I'm doing the texturing the living
work at the moment
[Music]
so
[Music]
I just want a lot of pictures between
these two points
it's not much business here but
you're hopefully not too much
yeah
but I can still
do that which does increase the number
of business
it doesn't increase never fixing that
way not so much deadly
did you find it because I want pixels
that way anyway
it doesn't matter so much that way
so I think I got the egg right now
like how I wanted it
[Music]
so I'm happy with that
but not everything is done because I got
this
[Music]
like
and this is the inside of the Mask which
is
yeah let's see what's going on
this part
looks like the red so let's be seeing
where everything goes
there
okay it will be a PT Center
[Music]
priorities
[Music]
here's the scene
[Music]
think that
so I marked the seam
[Music]
insane
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
here
[Music]
but just need to
unravel
this master of Pokemons
[Music]
that I have created
too much
foreign
she left black for some reason
[Music]
you're kind of
shapes or these it looks around them
ah fun
you're welcome you are you truly are the
first one here no no one else has him
before he
welcome
nice to see you thank you Ryan
totally not going to
anyway
oh totally friendship
may come from the house here doing all
right so it's slightly paid all right
maybe
even though I didn't
I guess I it is it is fun modeling but
sometimes
what do you say
just get a weird tired feelings
when I'm sitting here
[Music]
when I want to speak to
it's nice to see you show up
[Music]
I wasn't done I mean there was
there was a few people here still
not too chatty though
[Music]
[Music]
anyone showing it
must have been talking to myself here
[Music]
talking to my sounds
let's hide the big bow
[Music]
so yeah as the Titan says I'm
making a mod of bonbon
and I hope you know
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
they're here
Okay so
when it comes to a lot of bean stuff
and she starts trying teen way
you know what
I need to take
very quick
so-called BRB
is it really I'm passing break
all right and then chat I'm changing
stuff on the screen
be right back
foreign
foreign
everything is done
so
that's bad BRB is over
foreign
[Music]
thank you for stopping by I appreciate
it
you probably are already gone but
bye bye
by the end
so anyway back today
anyway so back to money
concentrate
so there is this part
so what I do is I export UV
[Music]
and I can't save it as TV
[Music]
like to bring export download solution
[Music]
sport oh there's one more thing I should
do
attracting it
[Music]
thank you
I didn't think it's matters
foreign
[Music]
thank you
so I'm gonna take some cocoa is
2000 48 but
simplify to two thousand by two thousand
so I will double it so it is four
thousand thousand by four thousand
[Music]
which now allows me to easily work on
details but then I can scale it down
back to 2000.
when the mod itself
[Music]
when everything is done I think that's
an easy way of working with this
personally
so if I import this even map here
shows up here
[Music]
and then it will be mirrored
like something like this
in the end
so note that it's very
wait me
I think that's like
quickly and premium and transparents
there is like a one way of doing it but
that way you also
also removes
more than just
thank you
I don't know how this is a kind
with what I can't see
is that it does not fit
which is a problem of course
it is mostly now it's not just the
[Music]
so maybe I can't split like this maybe I
have to spend it the only way around
them
a problem no problem at all
not no problem at all
okay
and then
[Music]
I guess I'll just move it up
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
a bit
[Music]
like that
so I will save this
over the old one
and now I can go here
and then
reload
and then this should be uh
afternoon here and then it is currently
using the
UV because textures can come in all
Sciences
in this using
it is using a system from zeros to one
one is for the position
I wonder if it's using it
notes
which means that
[Music]
it has the highest resolution down here
and it gets worse resolution up there
okay
love has excuses
but if you enabled peace according to
get
[Music]
one button off after
because then it looks interesting with
the texture shoots on the body
it's amended 200 27 and 90 pieces up in
2016 pesos
of course that's not matching up here
because this is from a different next
year
[Music]
I'm sorry about that is that I don't
have to screen secondary I really should
have these things
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
no
now since this is a hint that I'm
actually going to work on
[Music]
I can do work on I could work on some
things like this nose which if we're
going to blend there
but yeah
[Music]
amazing now
some of these
where does this one ZIP off
[Music]
yeah or is it just a
[Music]
oh
yeah not the everything though
that made to think here
[Music]
someone's thinking to be drawn somehow
[Music]
everything seems like that
but not this much
nope this part is sweeter
well that's it doesn't mean
anyway let's create nose
this is how accurate texture is
so this is the nose here
this is the area mapping of what I know
it should be
[Music]
but I don't actually have the proper
mirrored humor
so
let me like construct I've finished
wonton body
[Music]
so I will call this one just SK pon pon
because this is all the parts that I'm
done with
[Music]
the hand without that
partly creepy anyway
so I would apply the mirror
now
this part is the mirrored
[Music]
and it's going to select the Horizon
camera
how do I
[Music]
think
and now only half is selected
that means that I can mirror it
and move it over
to the other side and now it is properly
mirrored
[Music]
and now I can export the property in a
map for the hands
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
okay
I'll see what they can do
it again
just do a quick one means that because
it's going to play and anyway
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
foreign
thank you
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I don't know what distractions
[Music]
is of course not good
[Music]
[Music]
so um
[Music]
you get rid of their own teami QB
elements
anybody with a new one
after playing the exports it
okay
and there it is
and
no
add it to this Frame
so now it's properly known in
which means I can now
[Music]
I could actually do notes
[Music]
foreign
so the question is Ish is
should I modify how this Nursery look
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
like it's just a slight tweak
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
some more
have fun
how's that
I didn't see that before I never did
anything about it
[Music]
and no small feet for a Pom-Pom
[Music]
s
[Music]
oh I want to do
thank you
flip the wood shape away
[Music]
[Music]
I can emerge to point into one
[Music]
now
foreign
but it's not supposed to be
thank you
foreign
[Music]
there are some effects added here
and it's realized
I can't do that
[Music]
so let's do some all right
huh
[Music]
all right
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
is the darker Underside
to this shape
from the applied as a
[Music]
change mode
[Music]
[Music]
okay I can
trim it like that
[Music]
and I can add this shading at the bottom
[Music]
[Music]
so I'm moving up and then
[Music]
this tiny little Machining
[Music]
thank you
and then it could also have a part bit
of
[Music]
wow
[Music]
I have this kind of shaded Edge to it
[Music]
everywhere
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
it was a change
yeah innocence being
not quite okay
you can also change planning mode
so you find something like
this gives us softer
[Music]
this is probably more what I'm looking
for but of course
soft time out to eat
[Music]
the whole shining around
thank you
yeah it's from
[Music]
more of a hint about the office
and there's the nose
now
saying this
back to plan day
and then if we look at this and
too loud
it starts changed you look at me but of
course it's not using that texture here
that's no problem
[Music]
so what we do is this is the old
one
[Music]
so we make a copy of these the old one
called a boat
and the new one is just the name it
should have in the game in the end
and down here we just Swap this old one
version
but for a new one
[Music]
for now
and answer for instance
okay it's Shane Smith
maybe that'd be to the Highlight next to
between I don't know how that they
got negative she's done because it's my
opposition
an hour nice
look at how it looks of cocoa
I know
foreign
so I guess I shouldn't be afraid
to
overdo it a bit
[Music]
[Music]
okay
update
maybe it is good
okay another thing you can do is to make
this for the other textures
so anything else
if you're happy with the next turn out
okay let's copy the next section
so this has a very
dark
and bright
so
this chaining wise
I guess The Shining was still chaining
foreign
[Music]
but one of that giant
that orientation
why can't I make it large
I can disable adjustable layer and then
I mean this one looks smoother but I
said you can only scale it back by
scale of 150 and 19 250.
how do they have these limitations
so this is clearly not going to work
[Music]
something
instead I had to use a
subtract making it darker like that yes
and then I would add a brush
soft soft brush
create a dot yeah it doesn't matter
so make it 100
and make it a smart object
yeah
and scale it down
[Music]
now I can set it to
the mode add
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and then do this one
is much stronger
and that's basically another
version of this but you know the rest is
much easier to create
which is for example
like this
and what I can tell is that the face is
completely
okay
[Music]
which means that the nose
would also
be completely gay
thank you
like that
sure it doesn't need to exist but
[Music]
just in case
same thing with the metal layer
things
here
the nose is completely black
because the blouse is not metal
and we contain interesting layer
this is a normal map
and the nose does have anything on it
[Music]
but for the FC and FW I don't actually
know what these are
but can I fix them sorry but the metal
effect there's a bit of metal here which
you shouldn't
fish
and
I really put a metal effect
I can at least export this one
I don't
so now we're going to blend there
can open up this
add a new one
open image and it open the method make
sure it's not color because it's not
used as color
still set the closest
another funny interesting is that the
color space is part of the texture
itself if I just switch this out for
another texture
switches it inside Jimmy I will switch
back to this switch back to non-color
but the closest here has nothing to do
with it this that has to do with this
node itself
I added the metal effect it will
re-render this
third account finally but it's not going
to do anything because
it was already here
on back here
no normal is the interesting part
because
definitely
I want the nose
and then I try to escape down as much of
our other surface as well
like when does it go
let me try that
[Music]
laughs
[Music]
now it's much more exaggerated
[Music]
and I can't find
kind of an edge of the thickness
since
[Music]
and hmm
[Music]
like
thank you
this is very obvious
ly
so according to
the French Channel
what is considered outside
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
switches over
black is the outside
on February
like this but I don't want any weight
it sounds too short
I'm going to put this much
work on the
mesh I'm going to put a lot of work into
the textures too
there you go that's what the red says
it's outside
and now let's switch our way
green
which is a bit trickier to see what's
going on here
[Music]
[Music]
but it does say
[Music]
that it was there
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
put this together
and keep this
then we can also mirror it
as it should be identical
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
I think
look at that we're not so much
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]

on this model here additional normal map
and information anyway
to do a normal map in plan there you
have to do a few things
so in blending
you would need to get it in on a map
make sure that it's in no color and here
comes the tricky part you have to shoot
RGB curves
that's like the green curve
and invert things
I wish there was some inward tune or GP
invert or something
but again
there's a coloring right
but
that doesn't help it has to specifically
painted green Channel it was like column
or RGB inverted you can check which to
invert that would be much easier than
messing with this one but it still works
and then you pick another map
and after inviting green insert it
incremental map
foreign
remember the color
and after it it's not working
there we go and now which is a bit
easier to see now you can see this
it looks like it has extra a detained
Street
this isn't a texture this is just a
effects
and keeps it a bit more depth
it was another word for something
apparently was sensible but that's
I guess that's me
it will be more visible with the help of
the next thing
your roughness
the roughness determines how
rough it should be
and we will bring the original
don't break here this is the reference
map
and so
what being
is here
so did
the default roughness of this is 140
well
I will apply 142 to his face
and there's no shine
the shine isn't
more or less than Adventures however it
is
recently some of it on edges here as you
can see
this is a bit less rough on the edges
um
it's not by much but it's giving a bit
of
hello
nice to see you here
[Music]
so
[Music]
testing some
detection working
what's this on it pink
this is an inserting
now this isn't like that
something anything wrong thing here this
is an F40
and this guy answered seven
it's like a drug dealers
just the strength of it afterwards
to work on it
the results in the energy
you get back
in me just got back from the grocery
store and wanted to see what's happening
before I take a shower names yes I am
working on the news that is what
happening right now
um
working on the
I'm not doing nothing
basically roughness map of it
rough rough
sweetness yeah if you want to do
anything correctly
suit sneeze
so this is the r for Rock
ruff ruff
like the blender
I don't know the correct spelling man
the vowels are just flipped around I
think so and I think nothing nothing too
much
so
I'm going to add the roughness here
make sure it is non-colored that's the
very important thing
textures
which display and now it does every
account committing it
that's a spelling friendly meme I'm not
sure if it's a me more uh
what you call it
what is this game
info infographic
and yeah that's the spelling they use
because apparently they couldn't even do
a basic get expensive
one person has foreign
person writing everything you need
so anyway now
the nose is a bit shinier than it was
before and then
all right so let's shine it's not a huge
difference
I could make nosy men shinier for
wonderful
if I think that
one punch should have a shiny anus
and yeah
back here and I can demonstrate that
if I wait another half hour I can buy
some water vodka yeah that sounds like
something you would be
going for this
[Music]
it's fine
so if I fill this with 75 this is 75 and
so you can see it removes the gradient
but
if I set it to subtract if we now
subtract 75 from every pixel this will
bring the gradient back this is not the
same as
if you if I would apply something black
then this
is six decline
I installed apply black one
together
okay this point if you're still in half
but for some reason concept
but apparently can only be set to 101
different values even though there is
technically two and if it's 60 minutes
it's really bad until the next one
gonna wait until then buy a bottle or
two it only two and it sounds like you
need to stack up
and take a shower and I get fun
shower in vodka
foreign
[Music]
looks like if you actually do like a
black one and you do it transparent and
I can have it yeah
faded towards black
and this is what it looks like when it
is subtract
another huge difference difference but
doing subtract because having it fade
Swatch black make it make sure that
all the colors
and art will swatched black
proportionally towards that you could
have two how close they are
but subtract will move them by the same
amount so some would reach black before
others technical differences but
whatever anyway
if I do this
and refresh
this can I do this
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
cable so I could show
so I could have what is shown on stream
on one screen and watching me working on
the screen are you just couldn't find
cables I couldn't send it but I do have
the screen I heard like power cable
another keyboard to connect from here
[Music]
because I switched between two programs
but I didn't realize that one is not
actually showing up on the screen
[Music]
yeah very shiny too shiny
I wouldn't mind on business being a bit
shiny and then
that's a shininess
is it doesn't shut up shiny
so
there we go
it's just it's just a bit motion so if
you know yeah it must be that shine
[Music]
so but yes this is the
[Music]
roughness and finally it is India I
don't know what T stands for all I can
see is that it's
[Music]
sure what and it would probably just be
pure white in the end anyway so boom
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
can't I
[Music]
can't I can't do that
but it doesn't show up
oh there you go always up on top
[Music]
yeah well that's that's not something
there we go now this way I always have
the window preview so I can see
so I can see what's actually shows up on
the Stream
it doesn't have to be I can make it even
I can activate everything
[Music]
the bonus when we're for like a second
[Music]
but the pumpkin's face is obviously not
orange it is white
if you didn't know
now you know
thank you the next thing is
[Music]
the window I had to be doing a good
things about skin blocking my experience
[Music]
I don't think you need to write
adjectives announce the kitty
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
I guess could be used as a noun as well
so
technically
[Music]
so
I just found the
boundary of where the
this
extra should go
there used to be a music when you hear
called the wife rabbit's been there a
few times when one of my friends from
parking they played in our Death School
damn
that's cool
that sounds
foreign
that's
it's pretty much
all right
never been to a
performance of Music before and maybe I
have no I don't know if I have
been to Signature when I was like a
child and maybe I have
I cannot replicate a desk
now yeah
understandable
[Music]
[Music]
like I need something
oh seriously
I I work too much
my favorite song of tester was called
the count
was it about
really
or was it
about
someone who really liked it
get close to people
in an intimate way
I don't know any other lyrics
we couldn't understand them
and you selected
bass in that song
it's a good base
[Music]
I'm gonna princess some cute beads
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
like
he never was any any
place or like
did you practice with them also
or didn't they ever get to the practice
phase
your life is
right there
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
just me and my friend we didn't have a
drama yet and his focused well they were
going through a few pieces
uh
[Music]
and you didn't want anything to think
that
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
my friends since she was afraid of me
though
with your impressive
impersonates
when
they see we're safe but unless you and
they're afraid that you would
and she decided that
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
but your friend said that she watched
monster friend again
as a friend
like you were the cube type
she was cool with you but she convinced
her that timing the state of Washington
with her mom
so that's where my name is
didn't seemed like he had so much
stand on in the first place
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
then he hooked up with one of his own
dreams from high school had a kiss and
learning well or schedules never like
that absolutely
talk at all anymore
it can't happen
I guess it's like
it really depends on person some some
people are
better better at keep in contact with
people and some
some not as much
burning their words into any details but
he did do some shame this type of um
maybe it's a good thing never
didn't care okay
have contacts
always knees
it's hard to
lose a friend
[Music]
but like
many breakups
dating friendships
time can
you
boys
and then
and sometimes it's going to also realize
that maybe it was a good thing too
I don't know at this point I don't know
what you eat stuff
second and speak of that
yeah I I'm gonna try to be you can't do
it like I've had some friends and then
but the more I get to know some of their
friends
yeah
unless I want to be friends with them
and
I'm not trying to stay with them anymore
[Music]
[Music]
I guess this is simply important
anyway
I think he has done
with some outlines are seeking a magic
he never wanted to get me involved in
that stuff still and yeah let's
I guess that's good
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
anyway this is
my face
[Music]
the face and then uses we know something
of it
because and then there's the
mouths
and
see now I can see that
[Music]
yeah depending
looking in the mouse as much as possible
I guess tea is actually blocking already
transition into the element and the
transition is here
yeah I guess I don't need to
and doesn't really have any lips
you don't have lips no
[Music]
it will be very warming wind
oh
that's what's going on thank you
deep drawing Subway but back when we
hung out
every weekend we go get completely
wasted
yeah yeah
[Music]
I thought about some
would say
forever for his birthday we went to an
Indian restaurant that allowed
well I guess bring your own beer booze
but since I was awake
we sat outside drinking with with the
entire bulbs or being a doll
for us and
people opened up I ordered the spicy
scary and requested extra credit
than the inside of
into the crane
my facing across table said it was
burning his eyes from over there with
hospitals that made this stuff I still
ate this stuff
and yeah you're made of
and stuff
you're inhumane
so there's like highlights
to cure in humans
you're not a human
I don't think
Humane is different I should let me
hearing just what I should use but
I get directions that's much
I really
wasn't there or had drank an entire
house with short tequila never said it
means
I can't imagine that being
a bit
emoji
[Music]
this one does show the
see in English Bay
[Music]
sound as this one
[Music]
and some shading in different ways I
think
[Music]
so I could merge the two into one
[Music]
but I didn't ruin anyone's Pizza that
day oh that's good
[Music]
and I mean unrelated to streaming I
apprecially didn't tell anything about
the green Pizza
open a chat before
because I think we did talk and I can't
speak about
different stuff
yeah definitely
[Music]
definitely settled down since those days
yeah I think
I think
um
having some moderation
it's a good idea
so I kind of wanted this thing here
it really reminds me of a song but I
think William Jr
all at my Roundy friends have settled
down
after this thing ever
if your character has something white
and white let's see
like this part is white
it's not like 2014 or 2055
foreign
[Music]
like that I can add some shading
[Music]
[Music]
and get loud
and all my rowdy friends have settled
down
ah it's right tune
that was a bit
with two large
[Music]
thank you
foreign
I just I just
went in a random meds
[Music]
I don't know what this song is
amazing
it's it's that meme
let me find a pretty little stream
it's a way for me to do this
[Music]
but
why is this Australia
no I don't want this
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
we're on the hand of a coincidence then
yeah
anyways like I gotta go buy some of the
gummy vegetables okay bye bye for now
all right continue working on this
[Music]
make key coincidence
[Music]
I push the
this one here and always be a bit but
can I do
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
and then I guess it's two
attract
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
s now
I should be able
to say about this
and now
let's expect
the note
and that head is white
it should be and not because the texture
isn't down and it is learn it
a little bit shaded Down Eyes
for now I need
another bathroom
or my first bus
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
oh
I do have 100 left
[Music]
I have this out of hydrates
your kids 100 one more time because you
run away
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
okay smiley face now there's this IRL
and you hear the place of watching body
[Music]
I love my money to drink more
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
let me put on my headphones
oh
let's be
welcome back
to another stream I hope it doesn't
sound too echoey
thanks
I've got clearing up this room
thank you
this is
this is at the moment
foreign
it should be some black line here I
think
like it is on ponpon
and then it should like
I think it should go into that corner
and then you should
expand out punch that corner Maybe
maybe maybe
let's see if I can do that
um
where this is that
um
I like I got this in the
so
okay you should be um
[Music]
here
okay so this should be here
the line
I hope
and then is it
then merge with everything here
[Music]
[Music]
so all right it's gonna be here
because you're full of this line then
[Music]
yeah
USB on these points
here
and then
[Music]
I would go down here somehow
because time is
oh yeah it should be one step out
actually
and that's just some uh
[Music]
maybe it should be a step shorter
maybe like that
they're trying to compare to
foreign
[Music]
so
[Music]
I have to see where
that is then
I should be able to find these and then
more
because it should be this
slash there
it's a bit too hard I feel like
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
okay
but if it starts there and there I
should contact between these two
when I will try something
[Music]
[Music]
like that
let's see her next
it's the same
I need to export first
reload
here we go
it's um
a word suggest yeah I really need them
anyway you know this this pixelated edge
here doesn't it
this is fine it's it's a bit pixelated
but
oh I'm just sorry
no I'm not showing you that thing silly
me I guess
so like this is a bit pixelated but the
pixel's been a bit blurred out when mute
plus you're not going to look that close
in space even at like this Size Doesn't
your country can see the pixels and this
is pretty close
but this this looks bad
it's a neat appears
in here I should probably hang a little
more down there or something
or something
[Music]
that's one idea of doing it
and then there was something more
[Music]
I was a little bit uneven but maybe it
isn't too not small it's like here
could remember this point is good
back with some vodka 40 ABB
alcohol
nice volume
and some rum
95 and a half
jbd
[Music]
so this is at this one
hello Iranian welcome back which very
important
the most important yeah
[Music]
Fair
I tried to make a joke
above volume okay
[Music]
I mean what else would the alcohol be I
think
I mean it could be alcohol by right
yeah I guess you could have it all
called by mass and that would be an
event
[Music]
[Music]
I might need to
[Music]
[Music]
life
I
I remember one time I bought a dish of
rum and a shot glass to work brought
this Ramen Shop class to work so me and
the guys you could relax in their
parking lot after work
um
while the switchboard is about the same
and that is a room
which is which has Marines room
and you can have a relaxing room
look at another Pittsburgh
um
[Music]
now when I get finished in single shot
oh
those
people
[Music]
nice inside
SpongeBob
[Music]
okay
instead shop how about you can dominate
them in other ways
anyway
here I think this is this is good
now I just need to kind of
thing here
the tip
dominate with a banana
why dominate when you buy banana to eat
banana
but since we have people here now
there's been I think I've been seeing
enough information
some streamers have a redeem that you
can redeem once a stream per person
and
I don't know if you said to dominate or
dominating as in color and not dominate
dominate the guys
and next day they tell me how they had
their worst nightmares from the Roman
they were never touching that stuff
again I said
I sit out
I was curious drinking two shots outside
I mean you're used to it there they're
weak
you have to update
dominate them
in modern drinking
so the so the idea I had was
but I mean
banana
banana banana
it looks like a very tasty banana
the
button
the banana is distracting me
yeah
we're very tasty indeed the idea is
basically
you have a redeemed daily redeem you can
do a user parents dream I do
like other people like like say Lolita
has it
uh not not to copy everything a lot of
you guys not that I have though but
and other streams it's like slowly
Within Me
little little tweets every day
you hear me here
when I was like I can ship them out in
one way just kidding being funny I know
exactly what you mean I understand but I
said
but uh which I mentioned that lonely
should have the
tweets that you can redeem every day to
be random
and uh
she said that she would have to do a lot
of different pictures and that's right
that's right
anything showing up
so my idea was basically what if
I had
I defined it my own random then
so you didn't redeem you get some random
thing
as as as a reward for
showing upper ending
and that's basically it
[Music]
and but say
oh before I go
it's restroom is occupied the best part
of this room is the Hazmat warning label
on the side to let you know it's
flammable
it is a Flambeau
well
[Music]
foreign
trying to think find the correct angle
here
I'd run a car for a bit myself changing
what did you run it'll run around
okay let me show you
oh my God this is
maybe it should be a bit more out
Academy
we'll be back in a bit
bees in
yep
so yeah
[Music]
so I've been just thinking about what
kind of random rewards should be given
out for each user and when you do the
redeem
it would pick out this video fun thing
to do and I think
[Music]
and I think
a bit
yeah that's more liking right
because this looks like the eye of
I mean I said one eye color I guess
the eye on
[Music]
it
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
round and thing is
[Music]
wiggle wiggle
[Music]
dude
thank you
okay okay wait one point I do want to do
another character okay
okay
would that be interesting wait why
[Music]
is that one located
[Music]
this makes no sense to me
[Music]
it's very strange
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
now I hate to me
[Music]
why I know I'd be free he stays Thursday
Friday hopefully started in an hour
that's a good work you wanted me to work
he never replied so he used to find
these lines we're gonna help you
yeah
I should like do it next week or the
week after something like that
[Music]
you're ready to do and so soon
[Music]
and the Bell
both eyes
no if
if it's big enough
[Music]
but what needs to be done is
the other effects that needs to be
applied
do do
and by under effects
the first okay first off
should it be pure black or shouldn't be
a dark color of something
because this part is pure blanks I guess
I can give you black white
foreign
ER
I would say it goes pretty well look at
what I have made
the texture is all wrong at the moment
because I'm working on it but
I'm making a whole
okay well as it says in the
title I'm making it for crash
thank you
it's going to be exciting
hmm it's stinky hello shy
welcome
and then
back to cinema yeah
so ponpon has fingers not snack bars
but there are balls down here suit them
to them
stinky
and yeah this is from Texas of course
and
yeah there won't be any old paint there
are no purpose because this is a bunny
bunnies don't have four pants
ain't no stinky feet
one point has clean feet
so I guess I can be this is black
[Music]
because there are other parts like
and they're on
yeah it's like dark dark purple I was
thinking maybe I should do it like dark
though but but I did it black on the
other important monster
hello
my wolf has been silly yeah that's that
perfectly fine A5 fox said I won't have
been stuffable pair of spin I mean it
makes sense
[Music]
I did see new redeem before I don't
think you brought it otherwise I missed
one
are you dehydrate
parking
I got no audio because I'm at work but
I'm here at lucky oh
[Music]
so
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
anyway back to the Stream
apps is not necessary to use the icons
that does
I just hydrated the second
yeah and then what if that's it I had it
again
[Music]
maybe many persons that I did
oh thank you
no I didn't I did again
again
coming in here with you I'm going
shooting everyone
the the Reds black and the guy nothing
is very cute
like I associate with you you as I said
you really quiet
no shooting
is that
is your for Siri what's your OC like
anyway the FC
is some sort of
kind of rough Fair material in here
oh yeah all right
[Music]
I just realized what I did before
I copied a part of the texture and this
texture is not like the properties
because this is a upscale system
right in there like this may
keep
more episodes like yeah
[Music]
so for this one I guess I'll just
keep it the same but I I need some kind
of noise puzzle like this
where can I generate noise
[Music]
go see Persona okay
[Music]
[Music]
and then I can scale it down to like
[Music]
there's more like clouds than
that
I did even smaller like this but
[Music]
and if I repeat the pattern
[Music]
oh it's not connected
[Music]
but this kicking mask
exactly what
[Music]
I was a very interesting sentence of
it was a series of words
but
[Music]
I was just referring to what I'm asking
for shy yeah
and cheese
yes or what characters other people have
the women took your hair
that must explain why I don't have any
hair in my head I mean aside for that
little tough on the forehead
[Music]
a nice noise pattern here
[Music]
keep it yeah you know playing plans of
changing that
don't worry
I prefer it like that
I don't need a lot of hair my head is
actually makes it easier to not have a
lot of my hair
on my first in real life
foreign
[Music]
tweet
I think these
[Music]
which is going to be where his
[Music]
thank you
well
wait some of the actors here are quite
interesting okay
welcome and thanks for the lurking
okay
[Music]
[Music]
let's see if I do that it's
you know this is repeat value of course
but
maybe this is more what I'm looking for
you probably not be this dark
[Music]
we beat like that give it
foreign
this is a special
anymore I'll see how it looks in the
name lately
and then it is afternoon which
is a very simple one because that's just
[Music]
I don't know what it is what is the time
I think
hmm
okay what is it even doing
[Music]
I don't know what you're doing
what atheists
pure 2041
[Music]
nothing else going on
going on
there's a metal one
same thing here
the face contains no metal as our signal
normal map this one is interesting
let's get out of all this stuff
all right
[Music]
there's some things I
I don't want in software of
foreign
and here's Nick and stuff
if I want to deal with that
half now
[Music]
is she permanently any of the thing that
makes
[Music]
this was simply when I want to change
uh
[Music]
okay there we go
and now I can see where
I don't really see any
wow let's say
this effect
which is quite an issue because I don't
get sharp edges that's not good
this is a secret
[Music]
foreign
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
let me like this
it now makes it more obvious when it
comes inside
foreign
foreign
maybe it's worth it but
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
that's me
[Music]
crazy
it will be good
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
putting too much effort into maybe I
should give up on me ATM
I realized that I'm gonna be with two
detail
I should just satisfy with
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
uh everything's wrong
you need me
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
completely emotes
lifting back and forth
sounds like a good idea
[Music]
foreign
yes
it's not here anymore but they share
with me
in here
shy is um
interesting
um oh I don't know
okay save it and
so if I refresh this
there you go
gives a bit more definition here but
that's very much
Burger
it could be nice I haven't gotten to the
eyes yet
like
azilla
[Music]
all that stuff
I'm still doing the things
it's a kit
to this part
that it is
and it's gluing together
[Music]
foreign
thank you
I don't know this doesn't matter
foreign
first changes is
your switch over here not to change
color
the mirror should be applied
and they can join yeah
now I see that they are
layered in the same spots
[Music]
it should be separate
[Music]
please
foreign
[Music]
and I need those things
[Music]
because next part is the roughness
which is single coloring a problem
[Music]
which one
foreign
[Music]
no
[Music]
[Music]
when the roughness does everybody here
[Music]
all right
[Music]
it's very nice and about 2001
seems to be
suing that scan between twenties
and then there's the eyelashes
foreign
less roughness
so I guess I'll just go with whatever of
this no says then
[Music]
wasting
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you
now it's
Johnny I guess
maybe the game is there right about not
making it
they're showing this let's let's do it
often
as T which doesn't have anything
and nothing nothing
so
10 analytics point it is on
Maybe
that one
those body implements
14.
it is a large picture so
[Music]
this is why I didn't really need to
maybe I should do something more I don't
know maybe
[Music]
so maybe I should take a look at
that
okay so the emperor is there
is
[Music]
maybe I should add something like that
but anyway
completely black so
[Music]
[Music]
yeah meow
[Music]
a kitten
[Music]
a kitten has entered
[Music]
I have
facility
hey Lou nice to see you kitten
doing some
work
yeah I'm exporting right now but
yes uh I'm basically don't hit White
doing the eyelashes and eyebrows now
which
the eyebrows wouldn't be shiny dying
that's just a bit shiny just a tiny bit
that's why I'm at now
there's anything
[Music]
wrong with
[Music]
that one
I'm here again a snow day today at work
that sense
made me nice I don't know
depends on
how you would like for it
[Music]
sometimes slow like everyone but slowly
means that
you can get some time
quality time with ponton
and who wouldn't like that
especially kitten
[Music]
cheating can get a lot of quality time
with fun fun song
thank you
someday I love spending time with you I
never spend time with you too
the nice
kitten time
are they on your phone again
that one is very neat
why are they saying that I'm on my phone
thank you
meow
[Music]
doing a very nice picture
[Music]
and then something something
making it more visually interesting than
just being clean you know
[Music]
so here there's really nothing to eat
I'm trying to remove the last words from
this one
[Music]
is this
which doesn't do anything really
and then it's metallic it's not metallic
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
and I guess eh
I mean I could add some extra detailing
[Music]
my roughness here is where it's at
so the eyebrows will not have any extra
to them
with these women
[Music]
[Music]
now
[Music]
[Music]
fifty percent
[Music]
and last one is team which doesn't end
I should exported this one this one
foreign
updates
that the disruptness
I can update that one edit
and update now it should turn those
black
voice shape smooth shipping everything
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
left instead of eye here the right of
the eye
which is this part
and I stimulated actually
so these two things
I mean basically
sticky finished
so
I will cut this out
cut cut
but I should have the
Union map as a reference
so I must export that
looks a little bit tough time to export
your map up sooner but
[Music]
and then I can import it
[Music]
there you go
it's going crazy though I got this Beam
on my phone but my way we should start
drinking another piece
six seconds online
and yeah I don't
read it
please be weird
[Music]
look
up
okay
and it still takes time that's that's
bad
that's a funny computer in that case
that's again enough for the eye white
thing I think
let's say I'm expanding it
[Music]
yeah yeah how do you see the borders I
can sing this with The Eye Inside
she shrunk it by 90 percent
[Music]
did shrunk it did swing
[Music]
by 90 percent
[Music]
[Music]
so I should do the same with this
texture
[Music]
[Music]
if it's funny about this
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
their own height
oh oh all right yeah
my activities
I dreamed
[Music]
I guess I'll bring up the
anyway
I want to be dying okay
can I do that
[Music]
[Music]
one two
[Music]
um
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
I should promise
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you
foreign
looks like
reference make sure to use
very close up
so I can adjust the position
so
yeah
these pins right
scary
and then
this piece is going
there
there and then
and the question is which grades were
rotating
and then it's going to switch over to
the new texture well it's really another
way around
but the new position is not accurate
[Music]
even though it should be
[Music]
and then
[Music]
perfect
back to everyone else
and then
the mirror
[Music]
and now comes the fun part
[Music]
I will
okay okay
[Music]
that was my English
[Music]
it could play English language and I
will recreate the eye
that's what I wanted to say
okay
Okay so
plus eyes
[Music]
and
[Music]
just these two
no roughness on them it's just pure
black
[Music]
because the eyes are nice and shiny
not not
shiny eyes again nice
similarly they are completely black
because
eyes are not metallic as far as I know
my eyes are open out
this is the
afternoon I don't know what it is
this just has 223 in value
[Music]
so just put them here
foreign
[Music]
I can always
make adjustments to that lady
no I'm just princess
it will be squished like
that
and putting this in Here and Now
yes here's fun fun facts
[Music]
as soon as shine
yes
[Music]
inspected
take care
how much is that
I think that's that I
squished it out
lots of boiling you
let's buy
the stinky bunny hey shy I'm a little
stinky bunny
you you me me
[Music]
I'm not upset
I'm just furious
you're trying your stinky necklace yeah
I was just stinky pink
but welcome back okay
we might have been here all
this whole time but yeah I'm not
[Music]
so welcome back to the chat
chat at least
[Music]
yeah when I have problems saying the
chair sounds that sometimes I say sure
and there's this quite an important
difference between the chats and black
chat and chat
[Music]
thank you
I think it is supposed to be
[Music]
yeah we are going to retreat this shape
the iris is dark pink
[Music]
spray
foreign
[Music]
is hiding
in my bunny Barrel
wish I could make it more
the custom paintings in them that's
different
I might actually have a detail there
[Music]
new version when I my heart and mix it
up
I will be back shortly okay kitten
I will be waiting for you
okay
If instead now
I'm cleaning stinky nickel
[Music]
yeah maybe maybe this
maybe this necklace needs some cleaning
everything if all these Snickers can say
all the time is
consistently
so
let's make a pinch
Mia how I climb two
by Apache now
hiding the tree
[Music]
that should be shines custom
alert message
is hiding in the tree
oh but yes it was easy command
coming back
come back eat them that was missing me
[Music]
Maybe
wants that move
pink eye but not pink eye in that sense
[Music]
so so this is like pink like that
let me save and see how it looks
the other like a gradient or something
to match by how it looks in Crash you
know
because it's like a dark
up here
and this looks very
very flat if yeah
get what I mean
[Music]
I was missing these things
we had to leave but then it started
feeling worried
if I don't get this heat pump on anymore
okay maybe it doesn't show their
dramatic
I will be happy to teach dramatic
[Music]
eight seconds
I knew you would be back
I wasn't worried
[Music]
so
[Music]
[Music]
like that the
black part
what what
kitten
what's with the blushing and curling
[Music]
yes you are just cute
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
actually you know what
come by my house and clean
if it's free I mean
I'm not going to deny
some freaking
[Music]
I'm sure why not I mean I can take care
of
take one fee and that is only once
I mean I can afford that
I think it could be
[Music]
a bit more expensive side but I think I
can afford it
[Music]
coffee
and once you have to pay taxes on your
team
on your income money I mean you have to
earn a certain amount before you pay
taxes that but you know
[Music]
[Music]
I'm happy
and everything
it has become an Emos only chance for
some reason
[Music]
[Music]
doing that as a bit more gradient this
stuff I'm not even sure what I'm doing
perhaps forget to switch video again it
happens
[Music]
[Music]
anyway
so I'll just stopped it here and but uh
maybe the ingredients a bit too strong
that's my texture yes
let's show up on screen
[Music]
okay that's too it's just being weird
for me yeah it's it's actually a bit
weird at the moment
it can't load emote I can't live some
emails
[Music]
what happens
see
[Music]
since follow your favorites at the side
by skin all that one on this one yay
the following stuff has been moved for
me recently
that might be working something it would
be nice if they could perform because he
needs to actually affect using but um
yeah
sometimes he just disappears but it does
come back
and I don't think you should be worried
about losing your followers because that
is one of the biggest
like if twitch would lose all the
follower information like and that would
ruin the whole website
so that is a very high prioritive thing
for them to not lose if that makes sense
[Music]
also learn so much
uh if people no longer were following
audience
so I'm personally not foreign
[Music]
but don't be too worried about it
mine is that way too right now
okay just temporary box
well I was just wondered where he that
has been by for some reason
[Music]
but you never know
and if anyone were to randomly brand new
everyone
revoke that band
and probably revoke their mods status
that's why
[Music]
yeah
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
you have to donate a certain amount of
bits every week otherwise you get off
the band
and then you can request an appeal and
then you wouldn't be unbanned and for
the following the screen you have to
donate that amount of bits otherwise you
can find the game
and I still still haven't been yet but
that's my Wednesday I haven't even
looked into the my Emojis are weird some
emojis work some don't be careful
because
foreign
[Music]
actual emoji
like it recognizes an emoji and this
place has a picture and that should be a
little large and the third way around
this just breaks the whole text box
and
the
I think the rabbit is the one that
actually works
uh
so I think yeah like this one is
actually recognized as an employee
so if you do
that
big bricks
okay so it seems like if they're
actually recognizing the Emoji and shows
up in large when you do try to combine
it with a switch emote it breaks and
that's probably just on me
foreign
and
yeah and
this one
copy
paste
yeah that one is recognizable
what happens if you'd like to do the
other mirror it's something about
it
as long as you insert something more
like
a letter now it's slippers
it is okay he did something with my code
that is supposed to replace the
Emojis with
the actual pictures
and something's really bad code
[Music]
anyway so this is the nicer looking
so I don't need these anymore
function isn't recognized and I mean
here but
this looks like it is
[Music]
and I said like
[Music]
like they go with the damn and then
access to say her
Channel oops and I felt bad for it but
after I read it they
should use the question they said that
while they go with them
and they are not bothered about
people using see her
it's safe yeah
well that was a relief then
I'm going to try to use the character of
course I mean if that's the right thing
to do
at least it wasn't
[Music]
good again I mean
why is it
yes yes
you're so sweet for respecting people's
pronouns
I know it's just the right thing to do
and that is why I want
[Music]
and I am why I want twitch to implement
yeah
pronouns as part of twitch itself
let's reset your
[Music]
next for the roughness
you set your pronouns on your Twitch
profile and then it can show up in the
twitch chat natively
oh people like very very good for
streamage for example knows how to refer
to a well these people coming
like a very reasonable thing to have
[Music]
tasting like raspberries
munching burgers
there's always an idea having a problem
munching characters of scenes
[Music]
oh
[Music]
anyway so if I go back to midday
[Music]
you can reload
okay
[Music]
I need to export the
vertex drinking
strawberries and the main bottom things
thank you
[Music]
oops both are nice
so can I run out and now it turns out
properly and roughness
if I update this there you go that's
look at these eyes
seeing the eyes are more gray than
the body itself but eyes are very very
shiny
you can see a tree
[Music]
which background is this
you should be able to set you should
take a 360 picture of the room you're
working in and then set that as the
reflective picture
that would be kind of funny
now to actually do the normal breakfast
one
[Music]
and also of course you should be yours
have yourself in things here as well
[Music]
okay
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
if you need sounds good okay now what
you actually got I should do this
and
[Music]
so the Red Shadow
goes this way
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
actually
I've been drinking so much because
people keep hydrating that I need to use
the bathrooms
[Music]
just a minute
[Music]
foreign
foreign
[Music]
all right
foreign
[Music]
all right
I'm going to head it now
yeah there we go oh look you fix your
live stream bad red
I mean mix is online now
it would be interesting to read bixie
I have been studying for five and a half
hours
so anyway which I was going to figure
out now is that
because when I rotated the eye
so this is the original line down here
this is showing off the screen
this is the original eye
and here is a move and rotated it but
and now the shading is incorrect
what's currently down
so
ready okay first up red and green needs
to switch planes instead of Step One
that's pretty easy to do
because
[Music]
it's not really quickly placed
because it is it's so big though
[Music]
I'm sorry
uh would have been back sooner but I
kind of got into a live fight with my
brother what
he threw a knife at me
and what
it raised me right behind the left side
of my jaw
that's close too
so I picked up another name and it kind
of went back and forth what what's up
what it was what's
that what you keep on doing
I mean when you see it back and forth
that's each other and I guess you're in
a part of the game at that point people
easy
what no you only like with me and pon
pon me
[Music]
instead
it is kinda sometimes the same
I don't think I know is the correct word
when I when I go and check Who's online
and like or these two people I want to
watch clothes but I can only watch one
and also sometimes I just
[Music]
yeah I do enjoy watching some people
more than other people I mean
I'm not afraid to admit that I I I'm not
going to write a list of favorite
streamers I mean obviously obviously one
of them is very high up on the
leadership
which which you probably can guess who
but
and
yes um so sometimes I kind of neglect
some streamers and
I really need to get back back there
because they are nice but it's early
whoa did you did you type did you make a
typo kid
what's this
bye
I really need to do some kind of thing
that happens when someone donates me I
want 1050
Gems or something to fall down on screen
or something
foreign
[Music]
games that I I just haven't known
in at all and obviously um it's not that
I care about this game it's more like a
more of a streamer
[Music]
genre of game I don't know
foreign
a deep purple
and getting quality work I am right
that's why
I went to my Spotify
you're amazing
the newly thank you spot back and
together 510
and beats the lead
I
like yeah this is total of all time this
will never reset unlike on other streams
but I really wish there was like two one
monthly and one told them
because you can you can like switch
Pages here and you can only you can only
like give subs and Beats
they could easily have four of them
total and monthly
another idea to send to Twitch and also
this is longer than 10 I want like 100
top 100.
still
okay unhydrated again
you're going to make me a neat version
back to what I was doing here
[Music]
still in three the drops
I'm clearly neck and and shine is hiding
in the tree
and probably I assume it was a reference
to where my idea of having custom way
personalized
um
um large messages based on music
yeah but but
now now
Chinese up there and swing bombs at
people
no typhoon
it makes sense it was for like Oh and it
donates
105 bits I can understand that or like a
hundred bits and then there's a 5x and
it's snuck in there
1050 feet that's a lot of kids
I mean it's yeah that's
that's like
off of what
when Olivia does
donated into open
oh the purple that's a really good band
and that was reference the lead
guitarist Richie Blackmore
was a legend
that is say he was very difficult to
work with he left the proper parmesan
band Rainbow
and one of the singers of rainbow was
none other than Ronnie James E Neo
who
who was who sang song
was was he who sang a song like
a rainbow in dark or
like that
I'm not yet
anyway let's switch these two which I
said I was going to do a while again
no a red will read the green channel in
green which the Red Shadow
like this
and if you don't have this one
so when doing this it flips those two
but that's not all
owned
and because
because lights dark
light dark
enough
so it goes light dark light dark so that
is correct but if you check this one we
have
Light Dark Light Dark
and this is dark light dark light nice
this one is the merged
andrient uses light
to the left and up my mind on blender
uses
and I've been left and down
you know my sins yes Rainbow in the Dark
that was
when he was the singer of the rainbow
in the deal
yep
[Music]
there's like a lot of the
character
thank you
there's no sign of the morning coming
there is no sign of today you've been
left on your own Like A Rainbow in the
Dark
no no information about which
knows those are just random words it's
random notes with the words
so anyway I need to invert the green
Channel which I might be able to do
no that doesn't work
no just don't like
mine's long hand it doesn't work I don't
even know it
I know our teammate
I did that that was the thing I did
in in the blender
let me take the curves it doesn't show
off the screen though
and then I
invert and there we go
you know it
should be invented
and yes the values I imagine
so light left light stop it is correct
let's put this
eyes
[Music]
it's like this participation
[Music]
is hiding independable around
borrowing borrowing
this means that switching back to
blending
if I now update this Scene It should
change this and there you go it did
change it
[Music]
but it's not really not swelling is
the warping a bit differently now
it's warping the kitchen
who is
welcome Nicolas Patton or um
I hope I can call you
Nicholas Juan Pon is
the white bunny on screen which to the
right which is whom I'm creating as a 3D
model
at the moment
on one point is
my person
and the original to
thank you
some people have asked for everyone but
it's from and probably I mean one phone
is from me
I'm not the artist it's
um which I I always have trouble
remembering
[Music]
but I have written it down on my Violet
Echoes and which I
uh contacted an infinite regarding uh
for sale
[Music]
yes
these eyes are shiny
and I should add some kind of a
thing to the body itself it
so it's simulates very better
but yeah
but this is how far I've got
button
[Music]
and I guess I'll continue
my stock now
all right so again in here we have
[Music]
things
[Music]
and I'll just
what is the teeth I want
the time that um
next in between
her face is looking very good here very
good I think these things
okay I
I have
yeah
I'm a bad confidence
well
I see so this is this part
[Music]
aren't you excited somewhere that comes
in
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you
that's that part we should be this part
so this is going to be
scared again
[Music]
I don't know if I should
put this halfway between
34 what what's that 17.
and then
that's halfway point
[Music]
and that's a third one
thank you
yeah that's that's great
right and that's 30 and it's worthy
now
[Music]
hey
when it's keeping stream department but
it shouldn't do that in the in animation
stuff
yeah it's a bit nice if you wish I guess
oh no
what is the point
oh no
but it that isn't good let me
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
Ty
apparently
and that's how foolish I am
I mean these are completely on the
inside so you can never see his penguin
foreign
[Music]
goes here
yeah your face is Pink
at least
remove her face soon
all right
[Music]
okay that's one of them
foreign
[Music]
but it does exist on the original Kokomo
like the same thing
[Music]
so
[Music]
now there is an anxiety
let's say that again
[Music]
oh
so
what did this teeth which are down here
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
good singer
that's nice
not perfect
[Music]
this is a bit creepy
and this oh my God should not exist
it's normal
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
should be selected
[Music]
[Music]
not sure why they haven't really defined
any of these shapes here but maybe
that's part of the normal map
not part of the texturing
constantly present by the side of a
chain I got hurt when
it's gonna teach things through the
whole mouth shape here
and then
the tongue is fine it's just
t-sized
going through the
inside of the mouth
but it looks fine from the inside I
guess if I in case they want the camera
from the inside of the mouse
but yeah this is uh
just the rest position is going to be
different in animations
animations
well I guess it's
doing the same thing okay
[Music]
it should be connected yes export
exporting
and then I will import it to
[Music]
so I know where to select everything
select everything there
and whenever he's done saving
but it's still working
that and that's and that's uh I think
that
so often mistranslated in Swedish
and
probably too much in translations
working has two meanings
I've seen it is currently processing
something and it is actually a
functional
and those are two different meanings and
have these two different words in
English in Swedish
and
most of the time I've seen the term uh
it's using uh it is used as it is
currently processing something but it's
most often translate to us it is
actually
it is functional or something like that
it is functional and not broken
but just because it's functional it
doesn't mean that they're actually
working at the moment since
mistranslated
and I just look silly
[Music]
texture files are always looks like such
a mess
yeah this is a mess
I might take survive but look a bit more
more advice from not too maybe it will
probably looking just in as much as the
mess
[Music]
well you could sing
isn't that nice for the computer
[Music]
okay
so
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
texture bleed
[Music]
that would be pretty bad
because there's also a thing yeah
and I said that I don't see any
antis details here and that this might
just be the normal thing because
currently it is displaying it as
just a flat texture
but when I chain a
update it to the new texture for Pom-Pom
which is going to use the one with
normal mapping MC in the original
section just have it it's just that I'm
not showing it
because
[Music]
it's not like
so it's not like my model is going to
have more details than original
someone of this
[Music]
and
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so
hey
esteemer position
[Music]
[Music]
s
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
so
[Music]
I would create a
piece folder here
which I will copy into everything
folding
[Music]
copy that
paste
copy and paste
okay
[Music]
now
okay in Planes
cook it and paste
at the end pins
got the interest
and this one should expand
something tells me that teas are not
going to be metallic
oh it look at these the teeth are not
met him
what a shocker
yeah
definitely some normal information
listings
[Music]
so
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
and
that's what I miss
enemy
now I should again
[Music]
make it
rotate it
and then make it
[Music]
generate
huh
[Music]
up that far
but then I'm going to turn right
we need to move the other teeth
I'll move them together I'm not really
sure why they spread them out
charms
[Music]
but when I look at them
pretty much
and I could notice
[Music]
that [ __ ] texture over there looks like
a sticky mouth
how do you know it's a shooting or the
snake picture
I forget I need to know that
when I see this
red stage I didn't miss the stream hello
master now I'm slightly over time I want
to finish up these teeth
[Music]
it's not going to work a bit on that
but feel free to join in and chat along
if you haven't seen you want to share
my friends
we're just making silly jokes here
because cocoa shoes not States
I can guess so
much for my dream about cocoa wearing
snakes no chips
so that's time to move these
so this will move I am 16 that way
two pictures
this one is a bit tricky because this
one has to be moved up
360 245
is the left second one wait what did you
get 13 12. and up to six
and then rotate it 90 degrees
and then I need to make sure
but
[Music]
it is positioned correctly in this set
foreign
[Music]
this looks very complex eh
[Music]
well it depends on how you want to
look at it it's just
it is the picture
and the polygons of the 3D model just
reads from different parts of the
picture
that's a
so I need to
switch it out to the correct texture and
now they're really productive
foreign
Ty
but this is fine
it's showing
um
sorry
forgot to hide them so like this
this is like a corner here
of this station and then I'm gonna need
a 30 cup cap how to wire this this way
when I'm sorry
I didn't know that you
this is stage
I mean this is fine too I could
I guess
yeah I mean I didn't have to remember
that I could
to differ with this one however I mean
because it's just a single color
[Music]
okay
[Music]
and then the metal it is no metal on the
teeth
why are you not shooting it the purpose
what are you calling
calling me out
so when you rotate it you have to flip
red and green
and the green one needs to be mirrored
because I wonder if it's always deep red
and green always flick the green
immersed me
now next now let's put it
so yeah there's some more teeth you
mentioned here but it's not much too
and then roughness
but let me save the roughness
done
save the normal map
oops
I don't know
we have this one
but I do see
a kitten it's it's like clean up like
this but it doesn't
anyway
[Music]
and this one is already exported
so
thank you planning
and I'm back to the
baseless
soon
this one is loaded
roughness
not
[Music]
shade Smooths
and Laura Web which keeps the most
details like that so it's still noticed
details though
sad about that
that's
teeth can join
they are still bodies of this is
what's with the teaspoon
but there we go
I got critified I would say
foreign
I think most of the details goes into
the face I think I did the parts what
which required most
and work
I would then work my way through the
rest which should be a bit quicker
but so she doesn't look like this
looks pretty good so far I say
[Music]
what's going on
and look at that box
well
I've been working on this
Bonbon mod for six hours without really
I mean
toilet breaks I guess
but not too it's like taking uh looking
at the website fake in the middle of
everything
but I think it's a lot going back in
Fort piercing yeah mapping the U UV and
doing the textures that
the work itself gets a bit more varied
than when you're when I'm doing the 3D
modeling which is just 3D modeling
[Music]
yeah so
[Music]
good we go
I don't know it's broken
it's broken
thank you
[Music]
I enjoyed this thing thank you for an
amazing stream you are amazing I think
you're okay I'm from 37 years so amazing
[Music]
is Chad working here
yeah yeah
it's it's been there
it's been it's been acting up a bit
[Music]
and so
[Music]
I don't have anything more
yeah it's in a bunch of messages that
you can go see where we are like a pack
system the image seems to be broken but
only for some reason we've seen lots of
progress maybe progress
programs
[Music]
[Music]
Wayne
uh
it'll be a freaking one of them
brilliant
well then I want some weed
very weird
but you know what
which I said before
[Music]
and that I should read the mixing
last rains to happen that is
yeah because
yeah it works this is just being weird
but yeah doing what she mention so
okay
which has been that's less everything
else good good
[Music]
and once and let's go and visit Vixen uh
[Music]
and
emails are broken but you can always
press I think oh wait this is very
broken moment
the camper is called on and there
and type if you press colon type in on
or just 17 should be fine if you don't
have any other stream invest 17
uh otherwise you probably have to press
n 17.
and that
my other white paper now you have to
press two so 17 is the least I have to
type and that should give you access to
the emotes and then you can type the
name of the emote that's why you have to
type 17 it switch doesn't allow you to
skip so you cannot tape on hype that's
not allowed but 17 type is loud
so
yeah the rate is about to begin let's
share on
writing
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
