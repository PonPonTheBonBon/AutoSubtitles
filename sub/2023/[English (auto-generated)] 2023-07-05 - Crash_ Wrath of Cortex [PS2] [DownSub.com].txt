welcome back to trash
I can hit crunch in the backgrounds
no
let's continue from where
I left off
which was these two levels
Great Balls of Fire it certainly isn't a
great level
but after one night's rest
it should hopefully be easier how much
lives to have 17 no problem
let me quickly die five times
because that's how this game works
I've been thinking Some people have
they're like
a beer account on screen I guess it's
useful for like
and
there we go then we got the mask
useful for when you
yeah
uh Stupid on me
useful for them
okay I did that twice now
when you watch back
they bought
and you can see
how many people was watching at this
moment
all right
the dogs are having
in that case at least
I've seen it to listed a number of chat
messages
I can't I could probably do that if I
win a bit more
I'll try that
the one day stress
I have new ideas
nope
it was just a waste of time
and this is also a waste of time
okay
let me see if I can remember where all
the uh comments
on this great side
again that's what's that one
you know it's shaky that's why I can't
forget
I want to see what that thing contains
I have to look that three okay
let's remember that after
the multiple short jumpstanding is to
wrap them immediately left and then
in that section it is
hot and dry
I was lucky there a little Pasty
ah no
okay
it wasn't a great round to begin with
my whole skipping the whole house which
doing a lot of spins didn't work he has
plans
I'm happy you showed up
welcome welcome
I'm still working on this level and the
spin this slide didn't work I didn't
trust me
just
nice getting a crash
now
ah
thank you for the follow
Adobe TV
I guess this word
ah I know I missed the cap so much
these invisible ones are everywhere
that's best that I got over that one
me
well watch out sometimes
very sexy if I can remember the whole
scene
then there's this one well I almost
jumped off the level
and then
yes to the left there after that jump
there is the mask
and then I'm trying to check it out
while I finally did it but it was alive
but then it had time trial there
that is from this section
pass it to the left first
then he needed this to ride yes
no anyways that's this thing at least
didn't try
this section
found some dancing
oh I should just go
then just pull
wow
where's the missed that one
it's just Full Speed Ahead I don't think
I got this far last time
I keep messing up positions
oh is it the end the undeveloped
immediately well that's quick
I mean it was terrible friend but it was
gold
that's all that counts
okay
now hello Lobby
[Music]
it's a cute little cat
emotes
ninjas cat has some kit
Kats
[Music]
just a single simple level left because
this is just
cortex Vortex is that what this level is
called
foreign
cortex Vortex is
really it doesn't say level name here
they didn't have a room for it
okay
let's do this
oh I didn't mean it
bounces on it or
that wouldn't have worked
oh I'm supposed to try it here
how am I supposed to can I jump over it
so
I'm happy
that video is joined yeah I'm starting
to run a lot of live scene so
but this is the last level
luckily
I had just enough knives to do this
so let's go
I wanted it to slide but nothing
happened
yeah the the hitbox isn't that those
things are stupid
I'm clearly it's it's clearly though
it's clearly high up enough that it
should be able to slide underneath and
that that's it I was just clearly high
enough now I should name this yeah this
is stupid 11. this is going to be
another
16 knots
you're not high enough to be able to get
under it
let's try it second hand second just sip
jump over
keep landing on the front
a little bit
of course of course
okay okay
actually I think
some invitations
did we go no I can concentrate I'm
playing
I'm saying the distractions
you could probably just jump forward but
oh come on
forgot about that enemy
thank you
okay I'm just okay so yeah yeah I can't
do that all right all right that's not
an option
um
that works
right there was no but I mean it worked
the same thing takes way too long to
enable healthy
do you need that one because I'm
probably going to take damage for
something
um okay I'm actually killing Community
this this is the long level
just needs to stop taking I'm spinning
I was just been too late
thank you
that's what I want to do
that instead
beautiful
foreign
[Music]
the first price goes to water funny
well that was a white one
so that means I have now successfully
completed every time trial challenge of
the first 25 levels and I can now
proceed to the extra levels
[Music]
just like in
freshly
night time
but these are not good tonight
[Music]
all right
let's do the level normally first then
because I need
lives and stuff
where did intite go
all right I don't have
to jumper
well it says
it's just bad Vision more than
are my specialties
[Music]
no light because it's night time all
right you're right
they're good
good night
but they aren't good night I haven't
even dressed up properly
blind thing
how about this song
[Music]
so this is a remake
fresh lemon but I mean just learned
partly
there's a partly crushed lemon
but modified
oh I see
let me started by that Coca
and Indonesian enough theme because of
the bad night
okay
I was about running past it again
the daily 35 Felix kit
it is
it looks very fast
but I guess a fat ones are cuter
I don't know
there's a big butt
oh
yeah I was thinking too long
a bit silly there
what
did I really what
is it that close to it
oh I saw the land in the middle one
my country it's different
because I did land on the middle one
okay
all of that does explode
I want you to do this
for now
or whatever should I do
yeah that was part of the Crush level
two
when I have to do this level
without any light
amazing the sticky anyway I'm just using
d-pad
maybe a bit silly
oh
B
come
let me something
these ones are very tricky
um what
let me see something
or this is just a really precise jump
it's a very precise jump okay
but they say anything more than it's
just a meter in here
nope it's just meter in there
[Music]
okay
well I have to check
can I attack that one maybe
interesting
beautiful
okay
oh
okay
okay so I need
I need to get up on that thing
go
get that active
I landed on the park I wasn't supposed
to land on
okay I'll see if I can attack the green
orb because jumping over it isn't enough
option
nope
and if jumping over here
I'm supposed to avoid it
the only thing I can think of is this
power steer it with the mask
got my Firefly I need to see
[Music]
great
and hopefully
that's a nice that's a lot
of neat and deadline so I did it
I completed the level
but you probably do the time to run on
it immediately because I just did level
and have a trash in my mind
foreign
here has one Hidden Gem hidden within
coats
gem
okay let's do this
starting off without the mask
guys
[Music]
oh
I guess I'm going for the Mustang
now you're going to have fun with the
knee ones do you like them
what new ones do you have access to
I did write it on Saturday but I don't
remember what the old ones were
yeah leaking should be knew this Market
wants to be new
I think
crying love wave should I spin you
like yeah you have access you should
have access to all of those
and then you get access to one more if
you donate
755 bits
[Music]
not saying that you should give me seven
and a half dollars but 755 bits and you
get one more emote
I had a smart one yes yeah yeah this
this smart one was set as an animated
one yesterday but now it's a proper one
it's a technical difference Marquee
so yeah that's why I forgot about that
but yeah yeah
[Music]
thank you
I want to get this message subscribers
can now use
100 bonbons emotes in all channels I
mean that's not a new feature sometimes
twitch just gives me information about
something new that's very very old
yeah it's one of I think it's yeah the
it is this one
uh
yeah I think you get that one if you pay
[Music]
as a bunny
if you wanted you don't have to
and it's mostly for me
because it gives me money
yeah okay around this one yeah
thank you okay
level is slightly different
is it well the level is the same but
clearly getting stuck in that scene
there
the Box placements box placements are
the same too
uh yeah that's because
they'll try to use this stick when I
shouldn't
come around don't get
so like that one was an Easter last time
now
I think that was part of Crash lemon it
could be wrong
and also have this one yeah because this
subscribe hey yeah I mean you do also
have a lot of these emotes too no
not today not to reveal that to everyone
but
this is funny
thank you
as uh I did actually find it fair I
don't want to be really really cute
and I was thinking about having that as
a
uh everything and he put one in the fair
bunny
yeah it's moved in
okay now I can't do that because it
stops me
Hamas
over to Second what
now
I didn't I didn't pick the mask instead
of the two seconds I picked the mask
because I had to pick up the mask the
two seconds I get anyway
I'll just try it
since explosion still triggers at times
it it's the it's when
the premise gets destroyed by
like
chasing enemies at least those those
don't trigger so yeah
I'm not sure how easy it would be to
tell here but
what
what happened today
it was a gift sir yeah someone
gave it to you
I bet you thought you had to see it in
the lives of me hello Hicks
with some cute water funny bunnies
of course not I love it when you show up
postage random emails it's fun
I love to see all the different demons
yeah you're not uh as far as I can see
you ever only gifted us up as you have
the presents yeah icon but you haven't
subscribed yourself
yeah
I mean you could subscribe I had to wait
for the invisibility to be away you
could subscribe if you want even more
bunny mods you get access to how many
stats
13. oh that was a funny nobody
yeah I need like 15 more subscribers
because I need 25 active subscribers to
get
and the next remote slot
sadly that's how they do it
oh that was close
oh that was a very early jump
I got that one
that was too far back
and this is not just randomly exploded
okay I guess
I guess the clock is constantly standing
still at the moment you can see that I
got this two extra seconds
the truck is finally moving
oh no the turn the level was turning
the chairman was standing
I give the test I've said this is the
kind the heck you're very kind I mean
hey especially since you give the
subscribing to give you diesel
I think most of the time when I see
people gift Subs they are subscribers
themselves
many of you that really shows out
how
gift willing yes
I typically done so I am usually yeah
I always try to spread the love you are
you are a very lovely person
but yeah you since since
well I guess since today you do have
access to those five follow my emails at
least
it's some bunnies
[Music]
jump
just running and running not jumping and
pressing the button nothing happens
there you go
oh why does that happen that that
doesn't make sense to me
test
just it's just explains that that that's
that's not that that's not that crash
it's supposed to work
as far as I know that's not how this
game is supposed to work either
it has a bit of different crashes
test
two seconds instead of getting past here
let's try to be twitch
can it not just random and explode
again
it's it's like if the first one of those
three teams is a meter which doesn't
make sense to me because it isn't it's
just TNT but that just lands on it and
it just immediately explodes
three numbers I don't know if it takes
three seconds I haven't mentioned but it
counts down
but it just started counting down like
yeah am I just missing something is
there something wrong I'm doing
someone that's obviously someone else
that
but like I shouldn't do that
I mean I could just try to jump from
mask over to the next platform I don't
see I can jump that far I could try
because
I'll just jump up on it
uh
well I guess I can but I guess I'll do
that and
I have to
no I realize why
now I understand why
but it's still
I I just realized it it's an obvious
thing I just realized what it is
it's because I'm picking up the Third
Mask
and when I do that
activate
the super scene
stress the TNT
I guess that's how this game works
and this game is a bit weird when it
comes to the ship thing
that I have to take damage
now divine
all right
I guess I took damage
Too Short
we still didn't see we got some candy
because it's Clickety
remember that
remember that
that the level is turning here
starting here with neutral
oh no
if I needed to double jumpsters
the third Mouse is making them explode
yep
I did realize that there was something I
was missing I was I was sleeping
[Music]
I was doing so well
this time this time I'll do it
oh that was close
I guess I'm supposed to take that right
click the orders because it's click it
just go fast and
trying to
I was just too good so so I managed to
keep this on three masks
not to break
jump over that
I need to do a double jump no no why
don't you why I get this stuck
like a game
okay you can get past that actually just
the screen
pass
that jump Circle jump
yeah it's worth ignoring that one
perfect
[Music]
four four four eight
I should have been
eight that doesn't make sense
why does it
wait it might actually make sense
S8 makes sense yes
48 is 12 frames
hey that that makes that should be one
frame quick K to get 44 44.
[Music]
well
Ghost Town
just now because if I go to save I need
to have to go up
I did it why are you crying
I know because I've
um but
another not this level
okay I'll try to
get the
Jam first
oh
I don't see anything
can the camera please show me what's
coming up
don't have to guess
yeah I don't know
you don't see it I don't see anything
because there's a whole character in a
way
this is such a time and
lemon
well I need one as I get that one but
such a hard level to get the box Jam
especially when I can't see anything
because of the whole cake the lemon has
teeth you see
the opponent is blocking the view
the uh
the camera is not angling into the
corners so I'm blind going into Corners
going through the corners going out of
Corners make pretty quick time here
like how am I supposed to see that one I
want that one or that like I can't see
anything because there's a character in
the way
foreign
design like I see I I don't see where am
I going
why can't I use the right stick to look
around
wait where's my am I supposed to go
it makes you have to memorize the layout
thank you
I got it
no that I guess it wasn't too hard just
these kids don't know him
yay so and then last time which is
the timer
but
how like
I guess you're supposed to take all the
passing getting out of the gym all the
boxes because all the boxes are primers
all right time reductions
Don't Touch This
regular crates
all right that was supposed to take the
other parts whatever
I think it's last weekend
foreign
here we go
I got the other boxes I can't go quicker
shortly or quicker slower or anything I
guess that's that's just get all the
boxes get the buttons
really yes very very simple but because
I got three of them maybe I should say
now
oh
[Music]
even though one of them is really simple
[Music]
once you get the
boxes
why do you have to why have they shaped
these in this font to look like you is
you with The Arc Edge on the left side
does that mean the
okay so use have rounded bottom bottom
well these these like vibration has an
edge on the left side
well
interesting choice
Ice Station the band oh is this
what is this a jet pack
race
the hair liberation
what is this
one
why am I supposed to get past this this
thing
all right keep
it is basically blocking the whole path
I can't really help you around
I guess I can't go
there
thank you
now there is a box like this I was going
to ask and considering that you can
destroy this
anyway
but I didn't get all the boxes
hey
how am I supposed to get past this scene
there you go
finally
did it
[Music]
you should almost beat up the timer it's
fine
watch out for that
and that one
oh
okay it goes well so far
collecting rings
foreign
for first place
I know it's a spy flight level hit our
box is a flight throughout everything
I don't mind applying everything
if I get to play a spiral and not
just burned and now the
timer because that's pretty
pretty easy
thank you
let me just get ahead
miss that one
ready start the balloon yes you get the
timer
yes
foreign
okay that was that
pretty easy
[Music]
okay
oh no it's a ball level
and why are they teach him something
lucky
so there's a Hidden Gem
this level
hello kids killer world
why are the two parts
why are these three parts
this is killer one
what is this
which way is to code
keep crying
don't cry
[Music]
oh so I did okay okay this way I should
not go when I take the time right
all right
a pause
against that
I would answer the path is clear now
I don't know more outside wait
okay
this is another alternative path
salutation is fun I hope you're not
going after all the Platinum release you
know we love again no I'm not I'm not
I'm just going to gold and if I get a
plan
it is it's a bonus
don't don't worry I'm not that crazy yet
I get because
he wasn't he about today now he's
he's um
something
okay so the middle part is the quickest
but
can I
cheat
where am I going
I need to get back on the way
this is an alternative pass
yes
it's an alternative path
and dancing
[Music]
there was a Hidden Gem but the gem is
not hidden because there's boxes with it
what is this crash for
37 has a Hidden Gem some hidden gems
have some hidden boxes
making the making you not be able to get
the Box Jam
unless you also get the Hidden Gem
because the box here is required are
more boxes that are some of some of
which are hidden in other places making
the boxium more hidden than hidden gems
I like playing it's about time but
it doesn't really have a lot of issues
and lots of issues
and in that game
plus and times are not optional
got a nice pillar that doesn't get easy
well this is a pretty simple level it's
barely any like yeah
I found the gold already
yeah I'm getting the time on this one
should be easy
just watch me I struggle with this
level
I get everything
look at this girl
I assume
this pass has some additional boxes as
well yes
one more
on the way over here
there it is now I can go and get the Gem
incomplete 11.
the passwords and interest is completely
useless
foreign
[Music]
crash missing boxes for the Box Jam this
glare had called hot guys and anyone
that displayed that level knows why it
is the most fun level
I love it
luckily I've already completed crash too
completely okay let me ask let me ask
him to go through the levels first to
see which paths I'm supposed to take
a minute
okay so if I just sneak up here
which I do feel like takes more than
three seconds
I guess it isn't
whoa
okay yeah
foreign
oh yeah that's nice
doing a bit quicker to get a sense of
the speed
that might speed down here but I need to
slow down
rather quickly because of that corner
yeah and then I can just speed across
this one Full Speed Ahead
then
try to get those but I do lose speed at
the same time
I could try to
hmm
and then I will just
sneak around here
around the corners
then
this is this past the cricket path
that's a bad thing it doesn't match no
[Music]
or is the other plastic cookie one
I don't know
although that was not that was just one
minute
Sapphire time
nothing all the time
yeah I found
it as fun as a root Carol is what code I
don't know
how it is like so I cannot speak
to that
ah
the Aesthetics of this level is nice
yeah it is what do you like it and the
music
it kind of gives me the uh
DX bar if experience feeling
I actually played the Expo
what do you keep doing why do you keep
doing the same thing over and over again
oh you can roll a bit on the asteroid
he has to kill the plane he's played
slightly below
top of it
okay should I put a panel there
obviously they
wouldn't
okay I have an idea
you go down there
and see the time is
standing still
and this thing
when I reach those other boxes that
means that actually they've wait I don't
know if you save time because I've
wasted time to go up to use the boxes
but I do need to include that time
no I was going around
outside of the level
if I leave it all that
are you going around the outside all the
way to the gun
okay
come on down
I'm trying too early
foreign
box
luckily that one is intangible
now don't miss it
look at this it is gold
I said it was easy
just I just need to find a way to stay
on the track but and I could even miss
the Covenant still get killed
foreign
but
let's not
let's not get
force of nature
[Music]
let's not go too crazy here
so this is the last level and if I get
everything on this level I should be
done with this game
no Pacific your hands then
nope I couldn't
let's go
oh I'm leaving
cash us now slow snowboarding
excuse me mister
no checkpoints not a single checkpoint
that doesn't slide
yeah right this jump and there's speeds
that's also speed
Okay so
they don't kill you
and it's cocoa Lemon Yay coca level
you mean that is a good way right not
that you're not in a bad way
another one is kind of getting in the
way for me to get that box
thank you
of course yay
and she has a snowboarding just in a
regular outfit
foreign
I said they really should have made
different outfits for them
because they do have different outfits
sometimes
steroids
there are two levels uh snowboarding
has made a winter outfit for a couple
oh my way and there's a mustache oh a
mask
should certainly help me a bit
and then just start without it
there's up for the code
again
for the
Century G which I mentioned before they
should have made a swimsuits for Coke
but they will probably do it like a wet
wetsuit but it should rather be a
one-piece swimsuit
and the black box
chicken mask
and then
oh
and it's basically boost there
why do you get
if that was not coming I think it's just
that single one that I probably like
have to speed
otherwise I get everything
oh it's just sitting here I hopefully
they open
okay
and then this one I just
that one can be a bit tricky now
cute guys skiing uphill he needs to keep
hands from the slope
well I found the hidden one
now I just need the box thingy but
because there are no checkpoints which I
do find a bit weird I can just do the
time shine
still have to go the other way to get
this and then I can
I think I should be able to do this time
chat
because then I can just press restart
if I miss one
oh no wait that one is not the one I
should go
plus I'm not listening guys
you don't get a key my way
this is first and now I haven't gotten a
game I mean in this game
the only crash 2 on the insane Trinity
oh sorry
okay there's one issue with doing
uh time trial is that I don't have the
fruits guiding me
foreign
don't have object points because they
didn't know how to
do a checkpoint in the snowboarding
section
even though they have figured out how to
do a checkpoint in the
tiger level in the previous game
but with right the developer of this
game haven't played as crash game before
that was the issue right
survive I only got in a game over in the
first currency
it's a game over
only a single one
Sarah hey
I'm laughing again
excuse me actually uh yeah
actually that's remember how many I got
in crash two
I hope it was just the singing One
I think I was close to getting a second
one
I
did my best to avoid
okay let's let's do this
such a long level too
foreign
this does not sound like you're messing
on Snow Day
okay
doing well let's just missing someone a
box somewhere
foreign
not even an attention
[Music]
and then when I reach and this and the
game is
I really can't get
the Box gem in time terms that's not
allowed
that's in the hell
I will sacrifice The Mask I'm not taking
any risk scene by risking the flask
ah
I got everything and then I missed that
one
hello I'm here welcome kitten
I don't care about it this time
I can show I can do it without you
someone tried to argue that the green
exclamation point is the most important
one to get but it isn't
there are all of equal importance
since you need them on
the boxes that are important yet inbox
is stuck on it
not at unnecessary to get
what
oh what
what
I will get the button
I'm not gaming out
I didn't give up on that the ball levels
are definitely not giving up on this I
will eventually get it
I assume I get more fruits in initial
time than I lose
I don't stay early of course
see I grabbed the wine life so if I get
a second life it's
questions
okay they are
possible
no good day
and uh yeah I'm doing my best
yeah and then there's like that that one
forget the timing wrong with that one I
just can't get fast
and now I got a good timing
and that's one of the two lives back
that died early on there so
it's going Bottom one there
I can't change
that
I know it's running around
please the camera is a bit soon
diagonal it could have been so rude to
use the other cocoa
lighting slalom thing
there you go
here's the next slide
ah
that was the second one too
thank you
the 23 knives and the bad timing with
that one I'm not really sure what I'm
supposed to do with bad timing
I'm just starting it away
now it's a good timing like every other
time
so it's fine
I'm gonna get that speak English
there we go
like it's getting ahead of [ __ ] because
they kind of inspire me for what I did
that that needs is fine
you can find me for where the boxes are
I don't have to guess
and now I might have to try this thing
again
accident
it's not your start option
I should just have gone Siri
wait no I don't have to because I get
into the exclamation point I forgot to
put that
the time is a nice time yesterday this
was like the first bonus
you did miss that one but you get me to
see me now I'll do Coco timetium
which is the very final collectible I
don't have yet
I have
others all those not that they are
collectible or optional in that way
all right
yeah I'm missing one gem which is the
one I get when I get this golden one
though I assume I assume that sounds
right because that's how it worked in
depression so let's do Full Speed Ahead
I still have to go up there if I don't
need three seven one
I didn't get that one
and he says just cool tricks
forgot
well I jumped around it
yeah
I think that one well I got this
detection campaign
beat alone
it's enough
oh okay ignoring those
all right give me enough you hit your
hopefully snuff
because it is
that is every Relic I need
and now
give me the bonus give me the bonus gem
there it is
let's go back up and go back up and see
if I get the bonus gem
or every girl's really cute
[Music]
they have something for me
probably have something Minecraft
streaming did I really miss that gems so
bad
did I get this some other meme it's a
missing one gem
I'm not getting it for getting all the
gold relics
you're not giving me it
no button
really really did I really miss one
I didn't actually do it
you don't actually get anything for
getting on it so you only need the
sapphire relics on this game then not
the gold ones so I actually spent all
that time
I think the girl relics without actually
needing it
that's fun isn't that fun
I got denied the waste
when
I guess I'm still happy getting girls
oh I guess this part is blocked but the
reason why I couldn't take it last time
because I was still in the time maybe
it's 10 blocks
in time
I didn't see it it was
a rude
you just thought you wanted the good
ones
I just saw the one here now you need to
go once increased me
in this case you apparently need to Surf
anyone
maybe it still counts to the complete
percentage
that's getting I need to I should check
that
it is possible
that's the code one counts to the
complete percentage
in that case it wasn't a waste of time
[Music]
well I just need to get to these
can I even have masks here
while I'm dying so if I die five times I
will get the most convention
well I guess I just have to remember
after this section with this things I
need to barely get any times reacting to
that box
how many things is it on screen
[Music]
it is not asking for now
I finally didn't just think that they
don't try to be tricky by placing an
introbox in the in the mini
because I want
there is one
because one in the middle you can divide
them both ways but you have to pick
which one where you want to avoid
anything but I
five times
speaking of the devil as the phrases
there was one in the middle
just hadn't reached it one yet
wow that was close
at least they give me fruits
that can pick up more lives as I lose
them on this this attempt
there we go I got it oh yeah yeah if
people were unable to get this girl that
pass with time travel you could get a
rather short time
although you don't get any stopping I'm
saying me so I guess not
okay I got last Jam
now the game is 100 complete
or according to the game 106 complete
there it is
our crystals our powers our James our
relics our Christians well not all but
really I got the morning
so
that is nice
I will do a quick check on the
I actually got an important message
so uh crash Wiki hundreds
percent
completion
just double checking
and then I go to crash
I will not worked
breath of Cortex
Canada if you suffice has no extra
percent is given for gold or platinum
okay so the gold ones are completely
optional but I did them anyway
it was a kind of an extra challenge for
myself I guess
foreign
thank you
so
that means that I'm getting done with
this game I will switch over to uh
Spyro hairstyle
I want to
split this up in two streams
it's easy for me I guess
so
I will end the string and then I will
wait for stream to stream twitch to
confirm that the stream has ended and
when I switched over the game and then
I'll start up the stream again I would
not and I write that in the comments as
well so stay tuned
I don't know if this is a smart idea
thing I haven't done two different games
in the same thing man I could just
switch I know but
I want I want the voice to be split okay
stay tuned
