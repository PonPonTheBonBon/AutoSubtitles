hello welcome
I guess that was a bad idea
I guess I won't really
able to stay for the first few minutes
because I print tomorrow again I'll be
back in a few
um
I am
no need to get my words here
I hope it doesn't take too long so do
you don't miss I could start with
the other race in the UK
that was a lot I hope the game was too
loud again
let me check the audience
nurture remember good
and I'll start
with the UK
since I have different color it might
perform better
welcome everyone
new watches
or or old watches I don't know
you're free to lurk
I'll be free to write in the comments
today missile is fun to see what you
have to say
I encourage
I encourage Interactive
it's perfectly fine if you don't if
you're just on the watch
oh my name is
[Music]
well I could stay but I have
not a badger reception in this building
and the audio is not covering this River
well very Sharpie
and it's on my end I'm not serious
so you don't need to assist anything
okay
well I hope you
get your
unable to get a Marcus
whenever you're able to
I have some heavy uploading so it's not
me yeah I couldn't stand it
very loudly and then you have your phone
speakers
[Music]
recipe so it's more explanation
make a [ __ ]
and the world like this
[Music]
then you get this section
first thing I do is trying through
[Music]
I might soon
you better leave
and hurry back
[Music]
[Music]
how do you guys the music itself
[Music]
okay I'm going to win this
I need to do light up change here
let's go to normal game
is just
a short moment
I also need to drink
foreign
okay
back to drinks
now I put it a bit more towards this
expression more top speed
that might work better for this
this section
s
I sure like to collide
let's start
[Music]
it's not good
okay
this track
is quite harder
it's quite a hard track at the start
[Applause]
I didn't see the track in
don't attracting around us
is here
I mean
or more like the computers versus
but I will wait with doing that track
I'm thinking that other people have
showed up
[Applause]
when I need to
so I had two of the three parts inside
the hardest this section is hard because
I need to
got full speeds
without touching the raining of course
and without colliding with the cars
and if I just touch
it raining just a bit or turn a bit too
sharp at least you must meet and the
other cars we just
started first
while in the
my kittens welcome
I was wondering where you were I guess
you were busy it's perfectly fine
I guess here I have been able to join
at last
what
[Applause]
[Music]
yeah this Monday Tuesday students will
be atletic native
drum next week
and maybe
it becomes easily to join us and
get out of the way
of course I never sliding up to the side
of the road
it's basically how this game it's
your car is much lighter than anyone
else is hard so they can just pushing
around
and you can't really push them around
you can't stand here
[Music]
I think it's meant to be something like
the speed of your car determines
[Applause]
the mass
[Music]
this is the mass
is there
oh this is the weight I mean the weight
is the mass times velocity
very fast in your cargos the heavier
it would be
or something
consciousness
so smart
I mean it's
not too bright I guess but I think
that's like the basic
the uh
was it
yeah
I think I think that's the right thing
I only know that thing
I don't remember much from physics
what's something more about
how to calculate gravitational thing is
actually
you're so smart are fun not very cute
puppy
smartphone
thank you just
weird
it's cheaper
okay there you go
that's nice
[Music]
[Music]
and twitch does have
um functions which I have enabled
is that place in
the UK called
Fielder
that sounds kind of German
I lost
well I will try again
I think the city this takes place in is
is called Kilda oh there is actually
a place like a car like that in
UK
it located in the hexham
or is it hexim
or it might be something great like XM
UK place names
make little sense
but it still looks like a German name
regardless
of come up that was my fault the eye is
Belling as well as the ER ending
gives me a German life
now we should have both hair so you can
confirm
there's the sign there is that
Town entrance sign icing
I don't know
that's how it looks
I don't know if this is an accurate
representation of that place
if so that would be that would actually
be pretty cool
and now I'm trying to charm
I shouldn't just team this animal I
wanted to buy a bit but yeah in the
future it's still sleeping lately
left me
still driving outside of here
and I also don't know what's the point
with this airplanes flying all over the
place
and I guess this oh look
four cars
oh get out of the way
second place
sadly no water on this level track
that means that the leader cannot
accidentally disappear with other
reasons which I have not had anything to
do with
[Music]
cost
why am I supposed to catch up with bats
[Music]
it's mad
thank you
actually I use my I mean I do have some
kind of money
modifying the game here but yeah
I don't
I don't have any options
[Music]
new leprechauns
I just have to drive just as good
[Music]
and I'm already messing up
I lost us to 100.
now my 200
came and give me those back
[Music]
[Music]
I was getting killed by that
means in the field
it's like agricult has
gone up there
oh the red cars crashed I did that too
but I didn't precious super I see that
car I am now in the lead
what a beautiful victory
hydration plan
[Music]
hello hello
what a funny moment that you would show
up because I was actually curious about
the thing
he's kind of rainbow
if you come back to track one
evil VR or something
and then we look at the Town sign of
this town
you did it yes I did
thanks to the car crashing so I'm gonna
say that it was purely my
Superior skills but anyway at the start
of this town he had this
thing which is going to be blocked by
the
which one's better
[Music]
this town is called either there
and to me that kind of sounds German
I don't know if it means anything in
German
let's start sign I didn't get close to
the side crashed into a invisible wall
some kind of chairman word
and why is there a British town called
that
I of course have no idea how the British
town is pronounced
[Music]
nothing ever but it looks kind of German
right
I wanted to see if
no it doesn't give any pronunciation oh
what
in that case it might just be killed
I don't know
killer after another okay I made it
it kind of does but actually there is a
force in you can go like this yeah
there's a whole town as far as I know I
did look it up recently so that really
might be real also yeah
nice I drove off the road so
I do wonder how accurate it is
if they actually took inspiration from
it
foreign
okay I should avoid colliding with cars
[Applause]
it's apparently the only place
I had known from Wikipedia with that
name it's not a common name
[Applause]
for any trying to drive so fast
please slow down
I want it I shouldn't be kicked I
shouldn't stay so close today
inner side
like this
it's hot tea
times
when it's so foggy
is this the only difference
[Applause]
I'm like the Chinese track where I
basically have to get in the second or
third position at the first line
and then chase the leader I'll be like a
pass
in this case I basically have to
climb my way up
then wait for the leader to make a
mistake
now I just need to catch up with
deleting
my other side
controller
[Music]
it's perfect to be more racing game I
really should happen
[Music]
okay I am catching up slowly
as I say as I'm just
place them either
200 meters yeah
[Music]
well that was nice
new Leprechaun
it doesn't help
I can't catch up it's raining this
wasn't raining at other race so it is
high quality math fact
s on the back to the back of the box
before I might have just for nothing
all right
I'm not sure if this
product
[Music]
oh no it's lightning but the rain has
stopped
that's it I must
wait for the computer
things
I should get my lifetime
[Music]
okay
oh
I will try again
[Music]
hey I just have to drive a little better
foreign
[Music]
let's see that
it's called New York race
and space on the movie The Fifth Element
the address those flying cars
that's yeah it might be not exactly I
could look into it
not really my type I like the more
app simulating games
that are limited to reality but might
not have a perfect simulation I love
that movie
I was watching
I
I haven't watched it myself
it's a lot of movies
a lot of popular films I haven't watched
which I
consider doing I just haven't
[Music]
need to watch it again
[Applause]
hey it doesn't rain now so it like rains
in the second lab and then it doesn't
really want to sound like because it's
lightning instead but you can't have
really lightning at the same time okay
foreign
car
I I see what you mean come back my voice
only type more hydration
I will
used to speak
other times
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
I haven't watched this I have no idea
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
but this is how I'm here
yeah
next next racing game I should do which
I can't see is the mandate
she's listening racing games
and that would be that game has that
geometry
as well as a French
time
thank you
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
there's the car
yeah that feels better come on
my onions so fast
[Applause]
okay I first take flap it starts raining
pasta slap record assistant
that's it I guess that's what happened
is
fast
otherwise it's not bad
like a sister called itself
okay that's that's really
yeah 360 spin
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
four hundred
yeah I'm turning away for some reason
[Music]
I cannot no and I crashed I just stuck
to concentrate on these things
[Music]
concentrate on the event
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
now it's my turn to refresh
the red car Mitsubishi 3000GT
when was it
yeah
Mitsubishi
Mitsubishi
final track in UK
ah a Mitsubishi 2018 yes
uh Mitsubishi
3000 GT
okay now it's night
oh you actually don't practice
at any point
[Applause]
and also the apparently don't try on
that
right but
I think this would have an alternative
route
but here it's gonna be a massive
surprise
thank you
and as I say it I crashed into the water
in the completely messed up now I should
see
how this track it's like
no it's more faster
okay oh gosh what up
what the girls all over the place
I know it back
so my life
um
but I should start but
before I restart
I should take a look at that extra roads
that this video completely done used
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
it shouldn't be there it's stupid it's
also a raining not a sign but yes
it shouldn't be there you should go and
hide somewhere
oh okay
apparently I had a massive spoonful
okay can I like
this thing on the road please
that's not too much to ask for
oh that's about that
he's cruising along underground and then
Allah silence and
[Music]
[Music]
okay this track
[Music]
are there
okay so if I just can't stay on the road
and that was driving back from four
thousand steps
we might oh take them off
yes yes
get out of the way
then you have to leave
[Applause]
[Applause]
quickie turn recepticon it's fine
foreign
makes sense
nice for you to stop by and chatting at
least
and
see if you're back lately
bye boys
I shouldn't do streams this early
I need more hydration
I have made it so you can write the
command lurk with your message right
after
and it was and your message will still
appear on screen
but not your comment
doesn't its picture
oh I mean it's back
let me just win this race and then we'll
go to the United States
so
you can argue and argue at the time and
how accurate it is
[Applause]
thank you
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
you're doing this track again you have
the UK track
this is third track so I'm almost
I was completely
currently starting to mess up again
no it's a different track yeah it's not
China
but I had the lead and then I lost it
and then I had sleep yeah and then I
lost it
foreign
[Music]
thing
all right they have a limitation
yeah I haven't done the es races yet
thank you
I think companies come there not gone
I'll give this track one more try
there you go
and then you can
I need better prediction stuff today
James doesn't like how it only sticks
for 45 seconds it would be better if if
it had like a shorter title and then
along the description I like it specify
any details but oh man
um
what kind of domestic train was that
benefit
wow got nothing to Forest
[Music]
and a second thank you petition if I
don't have a bigger audience I just
wanted to just have to be function is to
see
how it is like
yeah this isn't doing right
the last position
I'm driving off this side
I need to keep this up
I don't know
apparently
who builds offense right in the middle
of the road
because it's a race track
that is why
so we got
one person who thinks I will do it in
certain
things I won't be able to Beatrice yes
strike while with him
30 minutes from starting
so yeah the time hasn't started yet of
course so as soon as the price rate
starts that's when the timer starts and
that's you you believe in me however
since no one has voted against you and
you don't win anything
you need a bigger audience so you can
have to two sides
two sides voting against each other
because
if you are alone well so what what
happens is that
it takes all the points scattered up and
then divided
up
in both
and it only says that one person has
voted so I'm not sure what he what you
said
although it does say that it was 2010
points I assume for 2001 person ten from
that person maybe
but they only said one person sir
anyway I have now deleted that one
because
no one about it no one thought that I
wouldn't do it so it was a useless one
all that happens is that
well there's two outcomes either you are
correct and you get everything back and
don't win anything all your Incorrect
and lose everything so it's better to
just delete it at that point
so you don't have to lose anything
also now I'm in red car
there we go here is United States
do you recognize these things have you
been here before
like there's still two red cars
wow
hello
yes
I mean wait let's suppose
[Music]
he had friends in Korean candy maybe
something
I don't know which
the US version of the inside of this
place
I've never been to this part of this
where there have I what is the price
[Music]
I don't feel sick I don't know why
I don't think it's specifically this
version of the track but I believe is
okay by the AI sometimes just
accidentally fall into the water
because there's a lot of places you can
call off
and Railroad
how am I supposed to start with the
artist said guadal crackers which grows
on a small area of Southern Arizona
today more often than almost
the side of the Earth
foreign
oh wait
I just realized now in the
it doesn't say that a kitten voted for
anything it only says that our Indian
loaded
so
regardless
yeah the work that doesn't exist this
afternoon so yeah
it's more like a
combination of
different parts of the countries of
the different countries in this game
[Applause]
yes that's someone
yeah I don't know
apparently multiple inaccuracies
[Applause]
okay
that's what I think first place
oh
I mean I I knew him during the trip I
mean but
that yellow car I assuming that way
wait for me I need to catch up
[Music]
okay now everyone see me passing
excuse me
all the cars yeah
all right
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
driving on the cliff balls
[Music]
I'm trying to relaxation
but that leading car is so far ahead
everyone
if you want I put it back here and that
one
[Music]
[Music]
I can't has covered I think
yeah the only thing I can help for now
is that the card goes into water for
some reason you can randomly
and that is flying
license or
except pumpkin is not enough like that
yeah everyone is fine
I do flying cars but
maybe the yellow car was flying too
fast again
yeah conference stays on the ground like
cars belong
I'm surprising you know see this
yeah it likes to go into the water
and after hurt anything but serious
where are these bushes into
it's a summary
[Music]
bounced off the worm and where's one
another like a little decent previous
car I don't know if that helps no one in
the center of mass or something even
I don't know
I never expecting this stuff
[Music]
and that's where you take a shortcut
another flying time
and you stop being
foreign
[Music]
oh
that's definitely
[Music]
[Music]
I could do some exploration on these
tracks
addiction parts
that people usually don't flip closer
climbing on the walls
[Applause]
thank you
thank you
all the cars falling into the water
oh I got more watches welcome everyone
I am from failing and driving car with
hilarious results
[Music]
you can try to read comments while I'm
crying but she shouldn't be in real life
cars are going for a swim here
I just wish they did that a bit more
often
it's a headless of a competition
[Applause]
a candy red car is smelling it
maybe it's a teacher let's talk about
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
um
I jumped outside the traffic
that's
that was me
but sadly you cannot go too far out then
you get replaced replaced
oh so Sneezy I need I should probably
put on some
I'll jump over the fence
I don't think I've done that before
but I'm definitely sick
I don't know what
[Music]
what reason
but
oh wait it is what it is
thank you
um continue racing now
[Music]
and let's see
it's been like 15 minutes other than
even that prediction is
not valid anyway
but some more funny things to predict
things that
actually might
people might vote for different things
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I am driving on the side of the road
probably part of the Guardians I don't
think
[Music]
that's something
[Music]
okay
how far ahead is that
I'm seeing a red car still in third
place and I do have the yellow card
it was Pebble in the water person yeah
probably
it's a favorite part
the sauce red card
wow I'm really not trying to crack you
know
yeah this is going terribly
okay concentration behind
I should be able to see this
really
shouldn't have like your face or
something
let's have to play around with
possibility yeah yeah
probably
whoa
my teacher
[Music]
[Applause]
foreign
[Applause]
outside the road as much either
sorry I close each other
anyway
something something like that
I don't know if
maybe I don't know
it's smaller distance
trying to maybe what the other car was
like
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
foreign
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
one so far
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
right
pattern in
Nevada
what's what God tried to say
[Music]
but then there's yellow car just drove
past me like nothing
[Music]
I hear the first position again
as I said that I cut
um
[Music]
[Music]
oh yeah I got stuck on something but not
that hard
it just seems sorry
this was my chance to win
[Music]
foreign
well
it was so close
this time this time until
[Applause]
I'll show you
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
okay I have the red and yellow card
ahead
[Music]
[Applause]
Beach lapse like the last step would be
very nice
I don't remember I think it's this third
track on this
track this side this side track
that where the computers have big truck
traveling big problems with
Bay on the track
I guess
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
very much
but that red tie
a red car is taking the lead is a battle
between me and the red cars in the show
foreign
[Music]
and when I do
[Music]
um
let's delete
because that's how races work
that's right dangerous to close the
water
living on the edge
[Music]
driving like that it's just happy
I'm still
kind of hard to steer in the car because
even the smallest movement makes it turn
a lot
[Music]
[Applause]
I just wish this steering was a bit in a
smarter okay
[Music]
less
[Music]
an impacted tanning has
yeah it's been a 30 minutes and I have
nothing sitted in this challenge I
failed
how do you get to keep your points
and as I would have more accurate
follow the
tiny more activity it was prediction
goes I think you can adjust this thing
yeah
yeah I mean there is a lot of setting
for it but
a little snooze
thank you
I tried to like pull smooth and full
aggressive
[Music]
[Applause]
foreign
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
just
[Music]
a kid
[Music]
I touch a car I turn around they touch
me I tell her that's basically how to
skateboards
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
all there to help me funded
that's how you treat in your life
[Music]
oh yeah
well those are some twitch and basic
ones I just printed out I been in
contact with one artist
who I offered to
and 16.
he was winning today
that could be on the 20th
it is now it's not guaranteed because
there's not like
no but like women so we'll see
you can get some actually proper pump on
the notes with some milk which I'm
actually emotions
so she can do some expressions
thank you
I can currently only have
five I think
okay can you carriers laugh in the can
at some point you can start together
why are these cars are terrible I feel
as soon as I think when I'm close but
not so terrible artists I'm back
which obvious things because
they don't seem like all the parts and
look at us nearby it's kind of how the
game works which is a problem
but if this limited Hardware
oink
s
I wanted his standard 3 Mr Stephen King
I should probably change it to that you
can pick between six colors I think it's
not one of them
but I should be able to make them pink
because I got to I got this six other
colors to use as a
basically
yeah this
this red green and blue so just using
both I can mix them and make any color I
want
using the
powers of any image editing software
[Music]
okay this isn't going
to heat I don't wait
what what cute animal sounds study
the prophet which is stream requires a
bunch of
a bunch of Kappa
I don't get y'all I never like
I never gotten into that kind of
culture of twitch
I'm not part of any streams using those
and well I don't use it myself and no
one on this my stream is using them
either
[Music]
because I'm basically watching
Manchester
Paris and like strawberries people
prefer using their own noodles oh my
gosh
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
this pack will probably eaten but now
it needs a half yes I have in it I when
I had beaten this game boy I had beaten
this level he's trying to find
and I'm trying so turkey yeah
[Music]
I'm not the one here this easy
[Applause]
[Music]
whiskey
remember I should play the other person
here but
I lost this
I mean that's that's the thing you could
have
oh I can't have that many characters in
the question
I can only have 10 minutes
I will
there you go now we can have your own
thing in the cutting your head
so basically next week should I continue
just trying to beat this game
I do feel like personally feel like the
game is a bit beyond my skill level but
I am making targets and I have managed
to beat
these three Chinese levels to British
levels
on one so what can I tell you how it's
their tracks
with only one track up there
and
they're having plus to be in this track
there's nothing possible
[Applause]
for us playing that Need for Speed game
which I I'm doing after this game
it's amazing the question is if I should
just
the question
if you like me
starting with this game or not that's I
like to eat
for my day it doesn't really matter and
I can put back this thing of those
I guess
okay I get my skills back
in that case
calm down
that car disappeared
[Applause]
I had nothing to do with disappearance
of that time
I must not be reasonable why that card
is Pink
[Applause]
my cat is watching this thing huh
tonight
enjoying
cars going around
[Music]
and she's
running Birds
[Music]
or should I say I don't know what bird
is it means perfectly
away
it wasn't getting that great anyways
we just
speaking of not knowing what's
there means there have been cases where
someone says that yeah I don't I don't
know it
before where it is something like that
and the person's like the other person
says something like you never heard of
that thing
well no I haven't
and then they like show a picture or
describe what it is
how can you not know what this is oh I
know what that is but that's not what I
call it that's the thing I don't know
the time
[Music]
in the moments like that
yeah it's just time I don't know I might
know what the things you're talking
about
first are the seeds of a variety of
weeds
the Birds stick to fur like kind of like
my birds I think about that yeah okay so
yeah yes I see the recipe is
plants getting stuck
I am
got them aware of I just didn't know the
time
and I don't know if there's a no contact
seeds
that's funny
oh I wasn't allowed for her I really
I want to follow this thing
I cannot let follow check
I need something I can prevent it from
taking a car
someone up again whatever you want
I wonder if this I'm going to do that
and some kind of out of balance sheet
that's what we need so I can go and
explore it
that was kind of my first stream on
Twitch
when I explored
502
when I'm defeated riptoe without this
basically collecting any transmission
can you stop pushing me down in the
water
like
so yeah I I'm trying to pull to the
right because I'm trying to follow the
track understandable and that I would
collide with the other car
why is the other car pulling to the left
because the track goes to the right to
the left is water I don't I don't get it
[Music]
[Applause]
and that's the thing I've noticing
multiple racing games
like
have the
are you trying to push
away from the danger
but you do but the computer plays in the
race you're pushing the computer player
to the side but then the computer
decides to push back so you both go off
the track or into something like the
computer is losing I'm doing that as
well
like it's one thing I could understand
if the graphic computer is trying to do
is only trying to get me into the thing
and they are trying to escape
okay
that I couldn't understand but that's
not what they're doing
there themselves are also going off the
track or into the scene
and so are they they have to put more
Turtle away from me to actually stay on
the track but they decide to not do that
because I have I have reacted before
them and I've already started pushing
them I mean that doesn't count because
hey knock them out of the road that was
a different thing unless that was the
thing that happened
before Arts I don't know it's more like
than when it comes to side by side
it was a super cute first stream for you
it was very nice of you too well
and I'm I'm willing to experiment more
with games until I have ideas for what I
would experiment with
if people have workers for Need for
speeds instead yeah
this game is getting ready for him
well in one minute supposed to be next
week then
[Applause]
unless you want me to switch overnight
no I haven't prepared again yet so
first time
the game looks nicer the easy control
and the cars
I don't think they start applying
randomly as because I hit the click wall
but I think I remember a lot of the cars
looking up here
it's kind of part of the arcade
for like the old olden times simulation
games
right
but I like that kind of thing
legendaries
not that sneaker space
accumulating
it's more of the arcade but but it's
from the Time of Need for Speed when
they went with more simulating before
they added all these
fantasy elements
of like
nice room
blues and stuff
[Music]
so
I went up the road yeah I probably need
to tune the car a bit more I don't know
what I'm supposed to do
hmm
maybe it should be something somewhere
between it let's do that
so something more like that
no that's the wrong way something more
like this
you should play big rigs over the road
racing assume it didn't even available
but that wasn't even a completed game as
far as I do
that's that's nothing you play I will
talk to you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
but I certainly like motor racer
it wasn't was
fogliness it wasn't really an hour from
release
never basically stuck on the same track
for an hour now
so
should I try to chase the level instead
[Music]
[Music]
yeah I'm messing up let's let's try
let's have fun now
I I tried to win the race fairly
come out as we need pumpkin
[Music]
six of course you imagine that
you're not getting up quickly on that
game
but then in games like that are buggy
that aren't like okay
one example I know
it's nice going there ponpon there is a
game called total immersion racing
total immersive towards an immersion
amazing I think
this is another racing game I could try
but I think that's a bit too
like it does it has really One locations
and stuff maybe and it has much longer
ranges and
I think it isn't as fun as anything like
this
however that game is supposed to
supposed to have music and stuff but for
some reason it doesn't play any of that
yeah I don't think
[Music]
okay let's see
it's impossible to lose the race so the
computer stops before the Finish Line oh
I didn't
oh yeah
I guess this description is
I can't say that you're right
nothing but laugh and
horses
there's our cameras yeah yeah I remember
that
you can speed up anything
okay I don't think I can she's decided
anti-insystem
does that happen maybe
[Music]
and this now I don't think it has any
form of Attraction system either
you have like full traction
[Applause]
yeah she's seeing for something and
optionalizing
I mean I could still try to chase it
this way
[Applause]
and for some reason I am in the first
position
even though I said I was going to change
it I guess I'll just win the race this
time instead
for real
[Music]
no it's still catching up with me
drives past me
the
if I need to chase it
like this yellow card
it's a very jealous she's in that case
[Music]
[Music]
I had that card disappeared into the
head of them
and it's a amount of Revenge or
something like the card touched me and
then lay away normally it happens to me
this time it happens to continue
reversed
[Music]
he's gonna reverse roads now I crash in
the car I spin out the car is back at
the time
but at the moment I try to chase it
roasted steel and the other cars growing
to me and I spent out
of me inducing control
I don't think that's like the case in
Need for Speed so that's going to be
more fun yeah
[Music]
by the way let's complete with this
yeah I probably have to do something
about the piano card
I'm going to continue
[Applause]
as long as people enjoy watching
and chatting feel free to check this one
[Applause]
get a rocket launch and blower for your
account yeah that's a good idea
uh
what happened what happened like I
worked like 10 meters back in
clicked out just because I hashtag this
is that is that a thing
I've never seen the characters in real
life when my days
I want some small ones
[ __ ] it cactuses
she bounced off a cactus yeah have you
done that have you been driving on the
road
it's nothing down off the roads get
slightly because like this was very
considered and then just bounce back
imagine the force of that bound
yeah
not only
oh not off
what
I don't know differentiation you can see
different passwords
I'm not sure what you're talking about
[Applause]
you can go around the world
[Music]
[Applause]
so
for some reason I'm feeling more and
more sick
so I'm correcting
you know I mean I still got [ __ ] man
[Applause]
yeah
Asterix correction by the way
okay I just touched the car and I spin
up
okay
so yeah we live within 30 minutes
Stephanie didn't happen
how am I smart
and I haven't said anything
I even got confused and was mistaken
that's not smart
[Applause]
anyway
yeah the other the only way I can
release this if I try to basically not
be cross down to watch it
I don't get any great opportunities to
do that
I find you smart and thank you
means a lot to me
these are a lot to do
[Music]
okay
thanks thanks for that
yeah that car is still in the race no
one is falling [ __ ] yeah
[Music]
I mean I lost the race at this point
I still got an hour left on planting so
I will win the race at some point
I have been saying sure
to my Spanish-speaking friends it means
I lost to him
oh it does
[Music]
you say make it to me
it does mean a lot to me
oops
maybe that's my option
let me try that again
if I just stand there like a guard and
then we're gonna head first into them
because like I've tried for an hour now
completing the rest but I need to find a
different installation
okay okay
[Applause]
[ __ ]
okay and then I sit here waiting
because I
at the moment now oh there they are go
go go go go go go
okay okay
[Applause]
why were there only three cars oh wait
why are you so far behind
and then I fell off
usually thinking about customizations
that might be a fun message almond like
what what should I change damping
so like I have higher than me
this cars are good seat backs well you
sure did
I like really good Safety assistance
I should mess with everything
[Music]
changed everything
he played card disappeared
I can see
live off the track
foreign
side by side I just
I just didn't crack the White Challenge
at the speed of sound I want to know
what happens when you increase the gear
issues when the car gets
I mean
if I increase it
this happens
attaching his car speed one lower next
yeah
but I did
I did
um
but
I did uh increase the acceleration level
the top speed because I wanted more
acceleration because there's a lot of
stone now next and everything and I
can't really reached top speed of the
car anyway
so decrease the double gears increase
height okay
yeah that's that's about the action
okay I'll try that
much
barely move
foreign
s are weird
do you call do you call the first gear a
high gear
or do you call High
to
to decrease
because I followed the assumption that
high means increase and that the first
game was alone again but I could be
wrong
your voice isn't sick to all of a sudden
I don't know why I'm sick today I mean I
was
excited though
I don't know what happened
anyway while I'm waiting for Armenia to
make sense I will try these settings
I had no idea what the game is by high
or low in this country but I'll show you
if I set it to high the acceleration
increases and the top speed decreases
foreign
I guess I mean
and you would definitely not know what
to know right the left is either why not
this time is that would ensure that is
and no miscommunication like
I don't know maybe men increase
acceleration
a minute
yeah maybe it might increase
top speed
that's what you meant
so yeah
yeah I think
so you met so yeah by increase and then
increase the top speed of
to decrease the top speed of navigation
and increase the top speed of high
against increased explanation
and I basically did reverse of what you
said because he used it types their way
around
but the ratio increase password is
really a differential not care about
what they talk about
first gear ratio to 60 I change this and
I haven't touched any of the other stuff
they're confusing
so
the other way is that right
[Music]
thank you
[Applause]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Applause]
okay
now let's see
here's some sparks flying
ah there
knocking me around
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
thank you
[Applause]
okay continue this way
I will eventually we need Maybe
someday
forecast still like that
it's like
well that's right yeah I'm not going to
mean it
perfect get rid of competition
foreign
[Music]
system colliding with a cactus
[Music]
when
I need something anything
else interesting
some reason I feel like
[Music]
yeah I should probably eat after this
tree so
maybe that helps
can you feel better
it should probably yeah I will eat after
this drink
[Music]
Baby It's Cold Outside
too oh yeah that's true
some like a month ago I don't know
like really hot
and then
and then it's been killed again
no no no that's
each bag came from
which sounds good yeah it does
[Music]
nice
because I like speed
[Music]
[Music]
like I said on the difference between a
technical spin game is that you don't
actually have to win every single race
because it's more like a tournament
or like this game well there is a
tournament mode in this game
did you have to win I guess I shouldn't
have chosen this mode
I guess that's my fault
but it's the Arcane Mode that I never
know
so
[Music]
that I don't understand that's
too hot for me
at first 25
work everything
double cabbages
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you
I mean I do but
it's more like
the same sheep
it doesn't really feed me warm because
the room is already warm
see her oh my
pleasing at your face
if you live in a freezer
[Music]
the price is so cold it's like
late spring early
soon like summer now I live like yes
hear that say
must be quite the cover down here you
need yeah a free seriously
you don't think that bridge you can just
store things outside
[Music]
I remember we had snow in Chennai for
some reason I want to remember that
happened but maybe not specifically to
July it's like Sunday but just now
let's see it there was like a dream
but yeah I Disappeared quickly because I
mean
[Applause]
it's to be expected
it might just have been a dream
because certainly I should be able to
look at the history of weather and
finding a snow day in the summer and
like that should be a scene that you
should be easier to find every single
snow day
in the summer
but speaking of getting really bad
hair is here
yeah I think he already said what it is
in a previous stream maybe
if you're free to sell what you need I'm
not the one
I'm not disclosing any information of
any of my watches because I don't give
you
and likewise
I don't expect my watches to disclose
any information about me sometimes I'll
make it public online about page
like my real name is Evelyn that's the
secret
but you can still cut it
leaves make this a bit easier for
everyone if this is my family
[Applause]
thank you
people have said that's the key thing
and I'm happy with the name
it's basically my favorite name I wonder
why
foreign
[Music]
that's why it's my favorite name because
I wouldn't if I'm going to change my
name obviously I would speak name I
think is the best
the arguably best student for me you
could say
both my parents have changed names so I
mean it's fine
Amy's short for Evelyn
as I mean wait what
first question
why
why are you curious about that like
where did where do you get Evie from
that's all yeah
there's one bonus track
their test strike
okay anyway yes Evie is short for I mean
I don't know if Evie is short for Evelyn
but I would accept Evie as a nickname
you are allowed to call me easy if you
want
to be
1250
2750
350 400 254
Russia what is about Native stuff right
it's just like interesting
this is the French developed game
and everything which I see this British
English
but that's funny
but more more like a German expanding
it really went without as more of a
compromise
I don't know
[Music]
my sister had a friend that goes my Evie
and her full name is Evelyn oh that's
my sister's friend
that's that's a coincidence
I gotta see the capitalists
and here is that
right here
with nothing inside
it's not that large trash but this is
kind of an open world track
I'm not sure which countries man it's
meant to be
which wood which was the seven we're
actually spelling of those things
so they just please English
no wait I'm behind us
I am stupid someone I missed their
design
they have specification
with this French wine not this German
okay
you're a stupid your assistance feeling
inside
I was reading numbers
this is strong is this like
South Africa
in her spot
inside it's nice you have a good company
capture has trees like this which
country has rocks like this
if you ask me although these trees
maybe it's just me
maybe the other time
without bleach sign
okay this is something
like okay
foreign
[Music]
nice to stop an area
and I guess these are
Developers
south parking j-hope
face Thornton
hey Mom Joy
they Mach 3D cheat shapes I would not
say that those are developers because
those didn't sound like French names
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
yeah there you go anyway
I thought this mode does allow you to
change the car setup while you're
driving I wonder what effects that could
have
I don't think they have a fun upon
parking no a PPP
oh no but the records others
attractive pass this lap time
anyway
yeah I'm gaming after this game the Paul
said do not do this next week anyway and
I agree with that
the game is getting a bit boring
so
what I want to show now is I want to add
a scheduled
look for the skin how big is the
schedule on The View if I had it
uh here's this
is the schedule
is it readable it's kind of small
if I remember in the early video game
days there will be that we use the real
names to avoid something I can't
remember they would use their nicknames
I think it was because the
the
companies were afraid that the the
developers would be contacted by other
companies and hired by other companies
or something like that so they wanted to
hide who were actually behind the game
which sounds
like a
terrible
I mean
that's an assistant
here we go here's the schedule
and now it's blurry but now it fits on
screen
so this schedule should be valid
uh with the exception for Saturday
Sunday
since that would be the
full day stream which happens at two
hours earlier than the printed time here
and the Sunday would not be at any
stream because I need a break after a
long stream
Saturday being the birthday stream for a
Pom-Pom
the schedule you think everything is
excused
so the certified time should be correct
from the next Saturday Friday and then
I said Saturday is a special for this
week and then after that these times
should be that
sorry you don't need to be sorry
can you know
and you to Europe and so I followed
European times since that's where I'm
from so I would follow European summer
time as well meaning that that's why I
had to specify that during the those two
specific dates for United States and
Canada
you have to add one hour because
that's when Europe goes back one hour
but United States and Canada does not
show you
yeah
yeah
this is too early for me
so there will be between
uh three times on Thursday
Sunday
I don't think you have anything in here
from Australia at the moment
but yeah Australia is making a bigger
mess with summertime
I just hope this region can stop doing
summer time so it's easier to manage
schedules but the University Service to
actually check the schedule on the
schedule tab
because that one
should be correct as long as you have
set your own device to your own time
sound
so
why does it have to open a new page just
to show the results
yeah
so
those times are better for me anyways
it's all good yeah I
it's better for me it's better for you
it's better for everyone
so I don't think I have anything worth
it for now so
good times it's been good times it will
be good time I hope this good times
Australia will have a very awkward time
there
basically midnight almost
just times that are all over the place
that's kind of the girl that's what I
wanted to give people different
opportunities to enjoy streams
don't surprise that's too late and I
can't make those days yes
it's
it will be like that sometimes
well then thank you for joining
and next stream would be on Thursday
and then the next racing game will be
Need for Speed so I need to switch that
pack on the schedule no problem
that's that thank you all and
let me I'm glad to even showed up
so it's nice nice to seeing familiar
people
wait why is this one not available for
me
I mean I am
foreign
you can make four six two three
numbers
I'm good
oh you means you can make four of the
six streams so two sets of the streams
but that's good that's good
there's actually a reason why I was late
it's a funny story but I'll tell you
later oh it's it's private story
it's fine if you don't want to share it
publicly this is the stream will be
shared online
I respect that
and yeah this spanner said these three
monitors will be later so if we have an
easy time to showing up in that case
so
well I don't have anything more to add
and I assume you people don't have
anything more than Irish than you people
for some reason switch to say that's
been one hour 29 minutes
it's been
it's been three hours now
yeah isn't that cute
okay
yeah see why doesn't that work for me
yeah
I mean I can't pick no I cannot
it says I have to pay for it
maybe maybe it became available during
the stream in the first kind of buggy
for me I have to restart it maybe it
works next time
yeah that's that's awesome
I'm sick I'm not sick and it's Thursday
it's a shaking I just wanted to fill it
out
basically that's all the chats all these
thoughts I have five static one animated
technically I could make the animated
just a still image so it's static as
well so I can have six Statics like 10
everything that's what I will do
because it's a bit waste other way
I don't see why you I understand that
you don't you like I don't I don't
remember on the the limits on this card
if she yeah she's called
and on this court you can have 50 custom
on your server and then you can have
like 15 animated or something
why can't you in that case I have 20
It's a 65 static ones and zero animated
certainly a static one takes less space
than animated one
and you've already get a slot for an
animated you should be able to get a
steady one
I'm not even requesting two Statics for
one animated and just request one
anyway
that's my
yeah
maybe that's
that's about it
I better end the stream now before I go
talking about something else
bye bye
yes
okay now I close this thing thank you
for showing up
