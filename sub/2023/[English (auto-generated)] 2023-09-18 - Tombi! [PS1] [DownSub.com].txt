do because I need to steal their key in
the bank

just first wind and then the wind
and whatever game was started in Corpus
Christi Texas
okay I need to sit up straight
I was kinda not sitting upstairs now I
can go back to Phoenix Mountain after I
think please
I just did that and no one said anything
when I sent when I was sent to your
Corpus a few years ago to on a business
trip I got to go to the first
Whataburger restaurant
aren't you lucky
I agree I can do that too
[Music]
I have been to the
[Music]
but I guess the correct term would be at
the time largest
IKEA store
it has changed since it is not the
largest anymore
um
C now you see when you attack these now
I realize
when you attack these things
as you might have noticed
he's oh she's a green meter down there
which is eight and every time I take one
of these notes up the pink one is for
peace and the birds
[Music]
the red birds at least
and that's one being used for the final
power up so maybe I get some green
powers
heavy toxic
so I should go to the storm Mountain
thing
and maybe I can find the next
[Music]
evil pig there to defeat
swimsuits that's a nice one
that's a nice one
the worst thing is the castle was
located in a place called
and
I did eat up working beef burger today
[Music]
I'm not really sure what it's going to
do now this place is calm store right
let's see because this place is
dangerous then it's less dangerous now
hopefully but I should be able to access
a few more places now
[Music]
I said it's dangerous place they still
have those though and those
Japanese
I don't really need to attack peace yep
[Music]
now I can pick up please

[Music]
at Fox is kind of a weird car like the

synonyms
okay maybe I can release it from here

um okay
I should be able to eat the healing
mushroom does that game it has no
mushrooms
you don't need a healing mushroom I just
keep them it's pretty because it's fun
don't structured again right
isn't it yes
that is quick
and what's the difference between a
person
that's the answer to that
I should not have this can I I'm trying
to mess around with my stuff here so now
that still pressing one button I want to
start preparing into that thing but
start is not
and then and then now that is a quick
okay okay everything's in order now
finally
okay
okay wait
can they attack you yeah there we go
about the heat twins
umbrella is for rain her Parcels might
also be like larger
[Music]
because they are usually
not what carrying around
unless you're like
fancy
[Music]
yeah there we go
now I got 10 of them
so how am I supposed to get to that
thing
like this
there we go
[Music]
good but there's something here

[Music]
I missed it
the knives and I'll take that
[Music]
and now I will go right
[Music]

let's see
it doesn't seem to be anything up here
except a red one
[Music]
okay
continues to get to the red chest which
I don't have the key for and or nice
one is nice
[Music]
it was almost missed it okay let's see
if we can do this then
yeah
yeah wait where's the one
[Music]
I'm not supposed to get that
like that okay
[Music]
this seems to be a scene here
and
too much about that
let's continue
[Music]
for future
I can remember
get out of my way
[Music]
are you still digging
went back to work
wait where are you going what
well if I have came
Joey let's go in here then let's see
what you have done geez you found cheese
and and guarantees
[Music]
well hopefully the mouse is happy with
Amazon cheese too wait you come back
get the other way
I wasn't allowed to get to that one
[Music]
I've been in there
what's it this one I didn't want to open
oh yeah when we died yes last one
she was that was buried in a mountain is
it still in good I thought something was
it all
[Music]
is that all I only got one of those
hopefully the mouse
which is not a mouse
it's uh
[Music]
stop stop doing that
[Music]
the other one yeah
[Music]
now it's a snowball
nothing okay
can I jump
thank you note
come on
I think I've spoken to you like multiple
times but
it's flirting now I had that yeah yes
that's the
everywhere you have to go through the
lava kids why don't you go and see him
but why if you need to Grapple against
yeah
but I don't have not yet defeated the um
the evil fish this is a lot of games
maybe I find he would be in here or
something but it shouldn't be in the
place they should be near the place
that's progress at the moment
can you tell me
I have sex if we weren't inside okay
maybe some rain could happen at this
point
it's green
I don't have access to rain
[Music]
That was supposed to capture
me
the lava Pig
lava caves pink
right
I don't think I have an item for this
[Music]
I got swamping bags at least crystal
balls
for long term which we'll see if I find
out which Sunday
good to see that something yeah old man
air time anyway that's okay so I can
tell it what it is
one day
appear in front of me
am I
My First Kiss was teleportation
I think I think that yeah I think that
was a thing you could do in the demo
okay
I don't have an item you can do anything
at least
I had some extra lives and then I lost
all of them
and there's no continuation here
you're not allowed to climb this one
[Music]
this is back to the start
yeah I don't have anything else to do
here
the only thing I can think of is that in
the mushroom place there might be a
pink
let's see if there's a pink
[Music]
oh you remove the Fire Jam thing yes
because I wanted to use the spike thingy
but I think I should use the boomerang
thingy instead
[Music]
I don't think it's
any better
this Stone
[Music]
sometimes the difference between
here born of a bike
and this thing
so is the
[Music]
this is something I should do here too
[Music]
no no what
[Music]
did I say
[Music]
see
[Music]
any problem
give us a quick video
okay I'm trying to think
think
[Music]
ing
it's my little brain
which is asking and he's standing here
you need to jump down
[Music]
there's like a flower there that bloomed
before
and I also say that which I need
maybe I should talk to you
The Villages again
is it me ready to wear my chin what's
the distance there's that is so warm
okay when I go back to the Village
I think the highest APA box I found was
250 000 and I got almost 500.
500 something
like fifty thousand hundred thousand
hundred fifty thousand something
I wonder if the next one is like 350 000
right now well beyond that
let's talk about today yeah okay this
time
okay
didn't someone here
I found him can I say that
thanks to you we have a wine again how
much teeth do I have I have like seven
now I think I had six
this before yes seven
got three more
and you said
do you think you can get even Peak that
crossed a spell in this Village too yes
where where is he
is
uh
oh wait wait wait
okay
this is waiting miracle pink is
somewhere really hot green is in the
Mansion of the lake
so
the green pink is in the mansion
if I stopped crying
thousand points
[Music]
I think you have already but maybe you
can find it
[Music]
uh is this something you like us yes oh
you want to know more about the Phoenix
drop key I'm sure why not all right a
long time ago that very much so much
just yet people like call him the Master
of Disguise
[Music]
but it was a long long time ago
there hasn't been able to leave the
mountains since the storm started up
wait the stars are gone maybe we get him
with private food he'll pick up probably
the Phoenix favorite food is the one
flower they grow in lava Kings if we
could get about five of those
the Pink's favorite okay another sense
but if it is
so if you are planning on going to see
him you have to be a real careful don't
forget the Phoenix favorite food is fun
so yes I got that but I need to know how
to tie the getaways
do you know yes I know what it is oh you
don't yeah I don't I know what it is
well foreign
[Music]
[Music]
ER town
okay I got some few missions
[Music]
hey little boy nice hello Benny
am I the nice now
is it like because I'm such a nice bunny
bun ice
bun A's Bon eyes one ace
bunnies
is
accent which I can't use
components
yeah it's just such a cute bunny
foreign
yes
[Music]
bunny
how do you say this is what
three
are you thinking with a very large
expose it takes healing mushrooms
decorate effectively struggling and will
be mushroom frying and if you're happy
to have eaten all the kinds like
suspicious mushrooms and get paranoid
what should I take to get well
I remember there's a lot of weird
mushrooms around here
that is a lot there's got to be some
safe kind yes the healing machine and
you should probably not eat random
mushrooms especially not one called
suspicious mushroom thank you very much
you're welcome
you found a key oh that I'll show you
okay
yes so there's nothing anywhere near
here
[Music]
anyway
[Music]
s yeah it's um I'm progressing I think
I'm just looking around
let's just see if I can find the EOP in
a in this place then
don't eat weird mushrooms that's a good
idea
been lurking the internet has had so
many cute outfits for you PNG first I
read that that's pink because I'm trying
to capture pigs at the moment but you're
pink yes I do have so many like
the sports outfit
and the swimsuit those are the only
outfits there's no other outfits trust
me
maybe the piece in one of these rooms I
have to check because I think it was
like an empty room
shout out to the those Asian humans who
tested which mushrooms were edible and
which ones aren't
one
yeah I need swimming
sportswear here we go
this is foreign
[Music]
so this Pine or peel hit play
it's safe to eat these make you sick
you'll die from that one and this one
lets you see God
uh no uh I'm pretty sure humans
were smarter than that for example
mushrooms that you die from usually are
from a from having too much of it
so if you have an unknown mushroom you
can try a little bit of it and see if it
causes you discomfort
which could mean that you should
probably not eat more of it
so
yeah
people have people are
some people are suppressing this month
[Music]
and also surprisingly sleeping
love this course way
I do like it myself
I'm
I like the
guy I like dresses but I also like like
how
[Music]
I like I like her
her tummy too
no stupid bird
[Music]
but I can't have both a dress
I guess technically you could have like
things
I think hang out dressed like hit this
up the bunny belly yeah this this has
been like like you have head pads and
other kind of pets this idea of having
belly rubs
pickle Tommy tickle
foreign
[Music]
yeah why not
for that
you should she should draw her model
wearing fun points outfit old three of
them
[Music]
and I because I am I have actually not
asked lonely about it
I don't know when I should
but guys when my Pom-Pom mod that I'm
working on for crash four
um
in case you don't know in case anyone
here haven't seen it before I see me
let me show a very quick
screenshot of it
I have a screenshots
um
I have a good screenshot let me
uh this does nothing I fit on screen but
there we go
and uh
let me move it already
so I'm replacing cocoa with cotton and
I'm doing everything outfit
[Music]
and it even says pump on schemes and I
will replace this picture of that also I
will run there
and pictures with fun
so
I don't also not the stats
[Music]
thanks fine
picture is fine see
I don't really mean it too
if I could draw
would be kids to draw like a gym scene
of you oh yeah that would be that would
be something okay I guess we just have
to find someone else who can
and
[Music]
exercising
is this the one with one pun holding one
nope
it's the pump on mods
for this yes I mean and working I'm
working on a Christmas
joke it's so so good thank you
I've been working on that for a long
time
so I really hope it's
people enjoy it and what would be really
fun is if people are willing to play
the game materials
if people are willing to play the game
on stream and with the mod active well
I'm with mod app added
playing super crash forward with ponpon
looked at me
okay if that's
the little pig is in the Mansion I had
no idea where I'm bringing is
I played again using pon pon but I can't
the
stream well you don't need to stream to
play it
probably not what you meant but
let's see
[Music]
but you can't dream
[Music]
I want to play the Tomb Raider we must
just have been ready that's also an idea
be running in
as long
nothing in that dream as long as it's
the Unreal Engine I will likely be able
to modify it
[Music]
friends back
camera
I also don't have a computer who wish to
download them well you can download each
on your phone too you just you wouldn't
be able to
playing too much
and here's the same kind of room but we
Direct
which I also don't have a kitty
not sure I can try to find
out yeah and
hopefully not bit too tricky to find
that information properly
like and this is the room with the key
the
insane Trilogy with crash is in there
in-house engine
foreign
there
let me finish
[Music]
so now check our ants come on Against
One
I think yeah Harris doesn't have ants
it's fine
there was an egg in here there was a
secret in here
[Music]
and of course if Pom-Pom were turmeric
then she should be wearing I could have
both I think like a dress and the
yeah
and this wash away
there's smoke coming out of this this is
going to hurt I feel like this is gonna
turn
oh it was fine
I want to
there's nothing here
[Music]
I can't jump down
that one
foreign
[Music]
does not have anything
for the train door
because those doors are
those doors don't have an actual way
this is whatever room
because I can't still access them
I just need to use the air
[Music]
student expression
[Music]
it's wrong
I need to use it twice
mysterious mushroom number two
now
it looks like this is crystalline engine
no idea what that is
eating old machines here
then this one had a four rooms
but it was empty because I cleared it
out
now I just need the 49 mushrooms
and now zombie is you can use this thing
again because it's not
bowling his eyes out why can't you go
down here this is a wallet
bubbling her he's outside
that makes modding a bit years
have you ever done real engine no
problem at all
I have all the tools I need for them
yeah it doesn't look like
there was no evil pig there I couldn't
find anymore
what's he pushing as invisible force
build apparently
there
[Music]
run around the whole thing and every
single room no evil pink
and the new one is
Unreal Engine though like the
2020s to me and yeah I could mod that in
that case
my computer wouldn't be able to run it I
could technically and I could I could
also mod the game without having the
game
it should be just a bit trickier do it
that way because I can't really test a
lot that's that's the mods I do need
some people to send me some of the game
fines
uh
but he has a few game guys should be
fine
[Music]
I'm not going to demon the game if I
don't have the game let's make it but I
couldn't
[Music]
where do I show outfit suggestions
um you do that
[Music]
on Discord and then you go to channel
and what one is called General I think
you're on this on the it was just an
excuse excuse for me to post it
[Music]
here on this server already yes you are
and yeah you go to General and then top
right I think the same on mobile
[Music]
uh let's make double check
that's the same on mobile you have the
icon which is uh
the number sign or a hashtag sign with a
speech bubble on top of it you press
that one
and then you should find a thread that
is called
[Music]
additional outfits for ponpon
you can even continue there that was the
wrong button oh no oh no I'm doing wrong
and then I can delete things
[Music]
right that way
you should be able to find it any other
side that's what I do also have threads
for naming outfits
and
what you do uh
if you ever feel like helping me out
with that because every outfit in the
crash 4 game have names
and
um if someone has a good name for
nursery time
I'm more than thankful
that fire doesn't look like
these are weird
thank you you're welcome and thank you
also for
providing suggestions as well
[Music]
okay I'm just going to let you in time
it's going to let you die
this big chest here
a bit dangerous though
[Music]
back off
[Music]
don't see okay are you coming down
no
what happens if I charge this up
clear stuff
[Music]
not much
[Music]
that's my actual difference
yeah having
where did you come from having flowers
with lips on is a bit weird
[Music]
this should be uh
yeah there it is
but it is crying
[Music]
I don't need this but I like them to
pick them up
all right
[Music]
counties is here
the powder
[Music]
didn't I get a jar
where is my items can I put it on my
items
yes I got a charge I could
because it's speaking of Tears as a
ninja star TNT and here's a place I know
that he is
[Music]
didn't even
[Music]
I think
of these in the morning
hey do I need to go and talk to you
everything you character again or
something
[Music]
what's those flower lips do though
that's how they get oh I can't skip
Pasty
yeah let's use your boat
the flower lips eat bees
jumped off the edge yeah they
these flowers are really careful
[Music]
thank you for being here generator
and we should take a peek at what you
suggested
that's an interesting outfit
like
[Music]
it's not an action skit
yeah I do prefer skirts any addresses
but I will explain it
they want to make pumpkin a 3D model and
then I could have different outfits
that's when I'm going to do only two
different types was meant for 2D model
but it's going to be a three in the
morning instead
and um
I'll do that that's okay
so
I'm basically at the start you shouldn't
like speak to every single character
I did I find one that had a tailbone
it's not what I have to do
oh the both camera yes
[Music]
no I don't think I can do anything here
not the first time you may see that
would be awesome I see them all the
different outfits yes
that would be awesome
now we're tracking everything
I think that would be
fancy
red chest
I don't think there's any characters
here
thanks for no characters
oh I can't go in there
it's funny
yeah it doesn't seem to be anything well
even parents
yeah take a peek
okay
you're in there
and that plant makes a fart noise when
you grab it yes and it is like a toxic
I hope everyone can survive that
is
a streamer destroys people's neurons
across the ones
hello old man
oh you're injured let me take a look
okay you still have quite a way to go be
patient don't get hurt
when I got hurt

and I'm trying to just stumble up on the
pink
Eve of pink not these non-emon pinks
foreign
[Music]
what are those things pink butts
Head Pants that's a hard thing but
yeah with the 3D model I could have
[Music]
objects that are tied to the different
phones I guess I could have
an animated hand
they're doing head pads that are
tracking the head that's basically
following the headphone but but then it
has an animation of that
[Music]
cute is it happening
pretty much you go to the village and
talk to everyone
[Music]
maybe someone has beans
what
[Music]
do you mean large pink beans a really
large pink jeans Maybe
[Music]
but it could also be pee but when
because there's a little Peak things

important to me I don't know what I'll
do without it and you still haven't told
me what it is oh the puppies hurt I know
I haven't found the improved it

four legs
or like hands and feet
when when out in the wild
you know to be sophisticated

content let's see what was it now
such as this a hidden rifle
all right Fountain oh yeah I heard you
need some kind of Tears or something yes
yes
someone mentioned something about the
Terrible
I can't imagine that I like them girl
see side down
since the pumpkin is very popular
everyone comes to the square
if you go through the leaves slider and
go left at the brush on this ocean yes
I've seen there
on the other side of the mushroom Forest
there's
[Music]
it I'm starting to get worried that the
game is broken
because of that it's messed up missing
which I'm sure I completed with my bad
team
in the lowercase was spelled by the evil
pigs to cut out the fires you need to
see a little pig but I didn't really
leave a piece why can't someone tell me
that time ago 100
Missions do you get something like to
take some powder on the red flower turn

aesthetic can you people just move out
of the way you can why are you standing

[Music]
what fruit oh is that a
wow why didn't you think you're doing
young man
why did you bite me all right all right
he probably bites people when he does
that now wait a second
I'm asking
they all treat since he's not angry he
just has one small favor to ask as you
can see the old string is well old he
can't suck up enough there are nutrients
from the ground
on his own anymore that's why he's
getting weaker day in my day but there's
one way this almost three can be housing
again
pump rocks and I all across this
continent these rocks actually have
water with lots of nutrients inside of
them
if you step on all of these rocks and
push them into the ground
the nutrients will seep into the soil
and the old tree will be better again
the pump rocks
I got that one thousand points
so
basically
releasing it knowledge is okay quite
nice
more
yeah yeah yeah it's very hard to see and
I can't show it anymore
[Music]
yeah they were they had a light color
and now they are dark color so I should
turn them on the dark color
[Music]
I got quite a few outfits made for
if you want to see the outfits every
outfit I made
or maybe you know exactly everything but
most outfits I guess
you can always join my Discord server
and then you can look for the topics
I've created on the general Channel
and this name the outfit you can also
help me come up with names with the
outfits too and I posted the different
types of domain and there's several
screenshots showing different angles
of that
same I don't remember the same King
so
saved okay
[Music]
rooked that would be the switch marker
fruit
those accordion looking rocks yes which
I have grass on top of them and does not
look Rock colored at all
[Music]
go up here
up here
[Music]
and they were wonderful day they have a
good day
for your looking rocks according to the
parrots those are the same things
we're done here now
[Music]
yeah I can swim
so and I got the fruit
and as far as I know this map is this
area is completely disconnected from
everything else
so I can't go anywhere
back from here
[Music]
what is this area
but there's one item I can use
exit 2 with 100 belt
that one bring me back
[Music]
how do you get there anyway and this by
using the Phoenix
hello old man no wait any there are
places where I can swim over here
yeah
they held up the Phoenix
all right
500 points
[Music]
let's see
oh that was close
let's go here
I must have been lucky when he did that
yes that's
that's exactly what happens
baby just in case
just in case
something I brushed my face
saved okay good
[Music]
good
now I can swing
whoa whoa what was that is that a turtle
can I die
but I can swing
still can't open that
hey it was supposed to let me in
no
but same of the new
it is a good idea was there anymore I'm
watching
this stuff watching
the other place store the door I could
enter didn't not have any watering
enclosed in some area
Point
500 points
and I have
568 400 points of moment
how did I get a 100 points or something
like 500 points as a lowest otherwise
it's like
ourselves in two thousand twenty
thousand
Bonk
so I'm not sure what they got a hundred
points from
maybe something maybe maybe
I should go to the village now and see
[Music]
gets diffused
[Music]
yeah they put they put this pink pig
butts on top of this fight so let's see
if we do of course
I concentrate of them
so unless scorpion
now all he needs is some good food and
rests speaking of good food is nothing
located
I have the fruit I get it for you
knowledge fruit does
this is the fruit from the Tree of
knowledge she poor me well I mean you
asked me
all right foreign
yes for the Dodge of course
Brian is all the nutrition you can get
right now here you go Baron
delicious knowledge fruit
clear a thousand points
[Music]
you want to farm this yourself yes I did
it must have been really difficult to
find the healing herb herbs herbs
and different from the history of noise
but he keeps writing things with capital
letters like that
why do you keep writing why do you keep
using capital letters in his speech look
even Baron can tell you how much trouble
he wants to you to get these he's always
so happy to see you
a man's best friend
clear of times lesson points
you know I've been looking at the baron
and thinking he might have some special
powers what is right
where did that come from it's been a dog
this whole time
seeing his ears are really big and I
also not really being used maybe he
can't fly with those it's just an idea
that's one
yeah
something about him makes me feel like
he's special you know
yeah
pattern strings one thousand I don't
know
[Music]
anyway now you just wait for him to get
his things back but bye again I'm sure
but I would like to see you again soon
have you been to the beach behind
mansion in the village yes I have
multiple times this is this is the time
we even see what gets washed up for the
shower there and see if it is supposed
to be really good for you you just like
go there every year and get some savings
without everyone else but I don't think
I can make it easier if you're in the
area could you get me a song for me
okay
I got some seaweed for your health
doesn't parents seem like he's getting
bigger I can't tell if he's growing or
if it's just my imagination
yeah he's in a bit I don't know confused
once you play this for a while and I
have seriously what's happening what do
you see I found a random dog for some
reason and now I'm the owner of that
random dog instead of going looking for
an actual owner of the dog I got some
healing stuff and a knowledge fruit even
and now the dog apparently
not now but apparently the dog is
supposedly having the ability to fly
because it's apparently a dog that kept
lying
I I don't know
you're playing too much Sonic the
Hedgehog seeing pink Cream the Rabbit
Valentine is all right I'll see with
what I can do
funny joke all right
so
which
way
down here nope
oh I see something
[Music]
was helping but I can go in here
[Music]
keep forgetting about that auditory
the one that needs
[Music]
the door that leads to
oh yeah they say it's in it's the uh no
I remember which is
the Earth mansion that's a longer pass
so all right probably shouldn't take
that
that's the short way around this one
please
switch your timer is the limit manually
it will be automatic when I have a new
computer with a with a 3D model tracking
everything and as we'll be playing at
that moment
[Music]
anyway
[ __ ] how have you been what a bunny
have you have you been really been
liking what's the proof
did you want to ride in my boat
technically you could just remove this
old boat section and let me swim in the
water but I guess this is the water
water this is like a ocean water even
though I will be going into this water
later according to the map
hey what's a bunny I'm good to change
[Music]
it
why can't I go into the water I can
swing
so
[Music]
it's a little bit quicker taking this
path
[Music]
yeah okay it's trying to care for
everything around the house cleaning
cooking
feeling the past pets not pests
Matthew something might be pencils
do you own Whataburger
which is Whataburger
no not whatever
I'm confused thank you she's enjoying so
well there we go let's dance
commands

water bunny it's really cute
[Music]
I'm trying to do this my red dragon has
been waiting here to Stone Cold
compounding again
one second yeah
no no I want to walk up like an hour and
now I'm playing Minecraft and lucky
playing and lucky it was like a good
time
now maybe
yeah I need some ants
then you've got like 57 minutes of no
ads I think
I know some people some people say that
three minutes away is it too much
internet sure then you got like 57
minutes of no ads
and then it's constantly having assets
like every 20 I could have like one
minute ad but that's what every 20
minutes of uh five uh 30 second ads
every every
10 minutes
but that's
so many outbreaks
but it's short to shore
thanks now everyone will be healthy
through a throughout the year look at
Byron he's he's gotten really big when
he brought him here he was just a little
pop wait how long have I been here now
he's a healthy big fella Artie boy
save it for your house clear
zooming isn't much enough time for
recorded yeah yeah yeah you can you can
use the toilet you can go get something
to eat and I'm giving all this
suggestion to the people who don't have
ads live like a great idea well look at
that Baron wants to go with you why
don't you take him along I think he
wants you to get on his back
go ahead he'll be okay if he ever gets
hurt again bring him here does that mean
he's going to be hard again I'll make
him more better but of you take care
of strength
come here five thousand points
following his person saying like four
hours

I know that
are you master of the grapple now yes I
am
the Phoenix Nest is beyond the case so
if you're planning on going to see me
anyway
the same same Diner but the bank flowers
and everything thanks anyway back to our
original bodies thanks a lot
more
I don't know maybe it's crying
what do you have to say now
pink is somewhere in hot green is
matching leg that is
nothing there thank you
I guess that's a new one
wait I understand with me
okay hold on believe it's true you
really defeated the evil pigs
and you want cheats
so were you able to find any jeans well
look at that that's cheese all right Jim
was having had a hard time fighting all
of the disease here we go take this
last time not exactly right
there are nothing important ten thousand
points this is a side question
[Music]
um I wasn't that character and in that
that moment uh you automatically give
the item over but not the one ways it's
very consistent
use the baron yes I used to burn back
the wings now backwards Village or
packing engineering you're silly now
yeah silly now that more people are here
you should go to that style with the
Statue of the you know what and get
their opinion What It Is Well since I
can fly with a baron I guess we can take
it because you requested it sure sure
let's go to
[Music]
come on
[Music]
apparently is now wait till 120 Minutes
um
sadly
but since I did complete the quest that
I got from one of the characters maybe I
should go and talk to that character
to see if something has changed
like I should go and confirm that I
completed the quest maybe I get
something from that
seems like a good idea
let's save so I can so I don't die here
even I've got extra knives
I might need exercise for something more
important than just dying somewhere I
could just learn the same and get back
to where I was
ah Quest yes I should go there for the
quest
I should set it to the grapple but it
was a quick way to switch around these
things maybe they they can do that in
the remake
still nothing here today
no yeah exactly in case that happens
[Music]
ah question
we should see what a statue is
statue of the you know what
I think I think Harris would know what
it is
for now particular reason
[Music]
oh yeah I should return this thing too
what I did
and we finally let me know okay see this
this time I need to go to the items and
choose it
so inconsistent
we're not identifying it thank you thank
you thank you thanks to you my boss
won't be mad at me now I can go back
who are you working for thief at a
thousand points
[Music]
and what are you working for
me I should I click one more I think
[Music]
clean funky person
that you have to sing
[Music]
yeah yes right
wrong item it doesn't die that's mine
I switched items after singing had to
switch before saving anyway yeah
well that worked
videos
this is awesome
so are there any
oh
anything
come on
all right that worked anyway
it worked anyways it's fine
what's up there we go now
it looks like he snaps the animal in his
back
can I just shoves it in there that's how
yeah
it's the person there and then we have
to go here
that same message but anyway here's the
statue oh you see he's here now
why
does this study look like
it's a beautiful statue
[Music]
what
definitely a statue statue celebrating
something
hey I'll be waiting for you I tried
hiding for me ever since the day I met
you but you find me every time I had a
lot of fun playing with you in honor of
our friendship I'll give you some really
useful information and I still want to
comment on
when it comes to the overview spelling
in this game they are very inconsistent
which which spelling dishes you switch
back and forth
maybe maybe it is like this in the
original and like which is related to
Japanese maybe it's like the boss in the
European and North American version uh
that different characters have different
dialects maybe it's supposed to
represent
now in somewhere there's a place called
the flower tower where is it that's
something you will have to find out on
yourself but I heard that there are
certain things you need to do before you
combine it why almost forgot here's a
present for me I think of anything
anyway
[Music]
you're traveling yeah I'm coming in same
here okay let's see here then
something direct with this beautiful
statue I guess
there's nothing special with it
okay there's nothing weird about that
no one has anything new to say
[Music]
I mean he's he's right there in the
north of the town
[Music]
so you can just go there and find him
so what more do I have to do I should go
to the pump Stones things I should
confirm that I squeezed every one of
them I might just have quickly stepped
on one or maybe haven't stepped maybe
this one I haven't stepped on
so because
oh yeah I should return leave five five
two let's do that
and
change the square
parody Square
use the baron why is it d-barrassed
way
he's a dog he's not
hello The Olympian
thank you for being here
[Music]
yeah I don't want to
it would be nice if it wasn't like like
all the equippable things were in a
separate equipment menu actually
honestly I mean all of these
you have four types if these four types
were different types
and that they didn't close the menu
after you change something with the
eclipse things
would be very nice okay I got some more
Leaf by the best way
I hope this is all um
[Music]
got four more
[Music]
hmm now I could imagine so much noise
I don't hear anything
should I add some noise to it
my what
how many
30 of them
[Music]
what we're back here again
well in that case I could have just
taken that pass
finally you can work up I've been
through hell
when it happened through Lava caves
that's kind of worse
first I'm flying through the air then
the next thing I know my insect cage is
broken into itty-bitty pieces before I
could figure out what happened I fell
over here I would give up who cares
about some stupid butterflies with Leaf
Wings where'd it go they leave
butterflies all over oh
Lily put a place all over there gathered
on some kind of anger oh is it an egg
[Music]
all this time
anyway I'm getting out of here wait a
minute where am I
good luck
[Music]
is this
Golden Leaf Butterfly quietly for the
place clear ten thousand points but it
sure doesn't look like that thing
anymore
[Music]
that's for sure
[Music]
egg sure
it broke it broke
and inside it was a golden
belief
let's check it out what's the one of the
five golden items brought by the leaf
butterflies what
one of the five golden items rocked by
the beef butterflies so
I can find more of this butterfly
somewhere and find any more golden items
the big key is kind of golden
someone thoroughly missed it and it
broke that's a shift
[Music]
misused it I'm sorry
someone probably misused it and it broke
yeah you should definitely take the
hospital after that
head and sleep
cuddling with the rimian
if you're going to sleep on top of my
head do you want like wait what's your
profile picture
what is this
well it's not a pen that they think
I guess you need somewhere panda
and okay so we can draw hand on top of
one point the Iranian exopaths
let me use these on our pink
yeah oh I squished it viewer if you did
look at that it was night Brown
foreign
we got some drama in here
I'm shrimping again
I did not say a color change must been
something yeah look at the background
okay let me go over to our other sides
this one I haven't squeezed yet you need
to squeeze them all the way to the
bottom
see how they
um
gone see how the middle one is not dark
for some reason
specifically here or is it because of
these you can't jump because of the
purple things
but for all the time I've been playing
this game including the um the uh
the demo so many times I've not realized
that the whole thing about the purple
ones is it they are preventing you from
jumping
that's what they're doing
yeah
[Music]
that's what they're doing
so do you see that this one is lighter
than the rest
tail around the red wait what pain you
answer your panda is in your pen like
it's really tiny
in fact now on I've decided no I didn't
know I'm sorry
what's this fighting what's going on
here it seems going crazy yes I see good
good these two are squeezed so I just
need to squeeze this
and now it's dark like the rest
[Music]

niche

relevant no it still counts

intense putting them in the mouth to
taste the brittness and shocking on them
