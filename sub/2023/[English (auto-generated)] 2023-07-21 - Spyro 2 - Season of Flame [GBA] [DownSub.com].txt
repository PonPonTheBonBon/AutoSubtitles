even though I did say llama
I guess you wanted to make YouTube
[Music]
[Music]
you captured Dawn
but what about Sun
okay if this don't there must be a
sunset
Vanessa I don't remember picking
episodes at the point
I forgot they don't have flame at the
moment
[Music]
I need to kill some Bunnings
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
he might checkpoints my onion Street in
space
honest
[Music]
that was so much
well almost stepped up the level there
but I do like these levels
these fields are actual levels actually
where else instead of just randomly
clothing platforms like police games
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yeah
oh it's your spider what do you want I'm
trying to get all these torches let's
watch nights festivities but my Flame
they're trying to reach far enough
the words flame what do you want me to
say I think the whole thing is going to
be late okay so these are fire breathing
or they have any other ability
to make fine
that shoots out in some fashion
[Music]
I need something else
[Music]
like that
[Music]
honestly like these kind of double
Champions intentional because this part
really looks like it's time for it
so
[Music]
being the same or it was
[Music]
there you go finally
take a few attempts
it might actually that might not
actually have been intended pause
I might have been it might have been
intended to go the other way around
I know if there are llamas and they're
wearing hats the card that kills people
[Music]
I think you mentioned it before
[Music]
but I don't think
oh someone's hiding in here sorry for
stealing your gems
Spyro my boy boy I'm glad you're here
glad glad I'm glad
this switch for this club and there is a
steeper that I knocked out in the lake
who won't let anyone ever skate until
someone beats him at hockey I know you
can do it if you can score five goals on
him in the next 60 Seconds
and that should teach tea Madison but
only if you score five goals in 60
Seconds
[Music]
playing hockey easy
well I'll give it an attempt
[Music]
[Applause]
oh it's on a half whatever
me
okay what kind of all the moves they
have I don't have I have those boost
okay this is supposed to be easy
I mean I do I do appreciate it it's like
the fall
oh great it's it's half of it but like
the exciting actually make it properly
all right
[Music]
finally one girl
[Music]
two girls
with three guns
[Music]
four goats
[Music]
now I missed
so even though I did four girls in like
20 seconds it doesn't count because it
needs to be fine because in 60 Seconds
[Music]
that doesn't seem to have been good
enough it's been out there do you want
to try again
it doesn't make any sense
how are you building a pyramid
it's something I need to call it a la
Mars in fact or something it gets dark
faster
okay I'll avoid it it's like the hockey
game from here wait
a [ __ ] game for my hair stain
[Music]
but still not hooking in my hands then
he didn't spawn games
[Music]
where is he
he starts with four and a half guns no
PM it's just one chili for every girl oh
he's inviting more cheerleaders okay
let's try again then
[Music]
[Applause]
come on
that wasn't good
there you go one girl
[Music]
two girls
and there's two girls by 10 seconds wait
one God for 10 seconds
[Music]
okay now I'm doing it again
three girls oh I picked it up again
[Music]
more girls
[Music]
fire goes and that was easy but you
missed it anyway
not
[Music]
or the dragonet monkey
but not llamas
please
I don't have perfect trophy but it's
literally figurine I found in the snow
should do the drink
s he's blown off
I mean
you asked me to like eats him a lesson
or something it wasn't meant to like
give me a truth before I finish
I didn't even ask you a trophy you kept
the comments
I didn't think
at least it was a donation
if I don't have to pay tax okay
[Music]
after seeing let's talk to this one here
now
Andy okay let's let's uh escort here
then
we're gonna do you're the one I'm
walking
okay
uh it's by the way the girl who did
notified
me apparently not get too far ahead you
can't fall behind platform not
but not get too far ahead
those numbers look like pretty easy
yeah maybe they need
[Music]
and they're not working up the
steps or anything is
[Music]
lose the whole step
he's yeah I need to jump up with this
one pop up
[Music]
oh fancy
[Music]

worried that something had happened to
you the first book just wouldn't be the
same without your star button
thanks buddy the notes will be so
beautiful tonight you'll be able to see
them hanging there in fact there's one
oh wait that's not a note
I guess you should you didn't take note
of what it was
[Music]
for the festival to start
you captured linked
okay where have I been and not been
[Music]
seems like I've Been Everywhere
[Music]
that was like that was let's say
[Music]
oh there's one
I think that's
uh okay that was the one it's really
nice inspired you're a big help now we
can sit them down and enjoy the
festivities don't mind my voice changing
handles
ouch why did I just sit on what did that
come out of your butt that's a bit weird
you captured Sunny well it's not a
sunset
but it is close
oh that was the last one of that
[Music]
captured glooming
[Music]
okay
no uh yes uh that's why I said
that I got 23 more oh I'm supposed to
play hockey
okay again oh yeah and the chest
yes that was the remaining gems
now to play some more
okay
[Music]
hey that girl they want to be matched
you should really stump him this time
how about eight goals in 60 seconds oh
that's actually going to be difficult
because I got like
so probably the signals
are you ready with the cheerleaders
[Music]
basically that llama sitting on a plane
oh no
he can do it
[Music]
that's going to be an archet for choice
one girl
[Music]
oh
[Music]
two girls
because that was close
[Music]
that was awesome clothes
[Applause]
now I spent four goes in less than seven
seconds but now it's been 30 seconds
and I'm messing up now
come on stop messing up
on I'll go please
[Music]
six girls
[Applause]
nope nope
I can't go downstairs
yeah I'm not going to be with these two
girls in five seconds
[Applause]
[Music]
I know I missed
someone
else oh spider he'll never leave you
keep playing like that I did 87 girls in
six seconds and then I can
do to try again
I mean yeah it went well
I should not deny that
play hockey hard okay
[Music]
doing bad already
yeah there's no exit 11.
and I can't believe why is it the button
is back anyway
how can I I like
so that counts
so I can I can move into the girl
[Music]
I mean
[Music]
does make sense
but
yeah I kind of messed up already so
[Applause]
[Music]
okay let's do properly this time
[Music]
come on one girl
two girls
[Music]
at this speed I should be able to do 12
gallons
and um
[Music]
[Applause]
not doing that great at the moment
three gophers
[Music]
yep Mr Park Mr Pakistan
boring cones
for these funny things with these things
yeah playing hockey is
the five girls
oh
[Music]
six girls it's gonna happen
quite a northern
thing
[Music]

[Music]
and
[Music]

[Applause]
and then I did that
oh stop shooting diagonally let's see he
goes

sometimes I messed up everything
[Applause]
and the recently
like traveling up the pack

[Music]
yeah I'm doing worse and worse each time
[Music]

next attempt I came up in 10 seconds
[Music]
next attempt five
[Music]
okay
properly this time
one girl
foreign
[Music]
[Applause]
diagonally
there we go two girls that's way too
long to just get sick and go
does it protect that
or something I don't know
the three girls at least it would make
sense
but why the part goes as it does but
[Applause]
those
in 40 seconds
that means I can do six kills not eight
five girls
[Music]
there's six girls wow I'm breaking the
trend
seven girls now I just need to make 1.5
seconds
[Music]
so I reflected it
no so close
wish I had like five seconds more or
something
[Music]
hey is this in the eyes all over again
and this is ice
um
so one girl took way too long to use
that was diagonal and there was no
[ __ ]
now pick it up
[Music]
two girls already she's been that person
yeah it's just it yesterday
he just ate yeah that's what inspired
the podcast three
oh
that's yeah I am
those
but I'm really struggling
before I have it's outside
I'm sleeping into the one
fine
[Music]
can I do it we can nope
I'm really not good at doing quick ones
hi
come on now
[Music]
pick it up

picking it up one girl in eight seconds
much better
[Music]
don't shoot diagonally three guns
[Applause]
more girls
five girls
[Music]
[Applause]
no
now I'm a little too close
now I don't watch antagonally
it goes straight
[Music]
wow six girls with one second left
oh my this is
they don't
hate that joke about it's being hard
it's not really hard just keep messing
up
I keep shooting diagonally when I don't
want to
there you go two goes
three cones
[Music]
four girls
five girls that was close
half time
icon
come on
finally six girls
[Music]
nope don't shoot diagonally
shoot straight and now you shoot
straight
but
I'm not too close
oh my keep my scenario
[Applause]
[Music]
it won't win but like
it's very hard to use if I'm shooting
straight to diagonally
come on girl
very much is this I thought I thought
you were supposed to break because you
must write it in
English
and then I'll
safety
three gallons
[Applause]
what well I'll take it four girls
hi Jones
off time
six girls
[Music]
oh sometimes
[Music]
no move out of the way
no I tried I tried to do it again
just shoot straight
oh you should shut straight
[Music]
no that wasn't straight
oh that was straight
oh my I I like I get close but
[Music]
I keep shooting diagonally when I need
[ __ ] straight like that's what I want to
do
[Music]
no that's not what I want to do that's
what I want to do
[Music]
it
move to close again
[Music]
I'm picking it up again
[Music]

wasn't even upwards in any sense
[Music]
diagonal
there we go there goes
[Applause]
sweet gowns
four goes
I said this was
our girls in under half time
I think it's just a good one gets harder
am I just get worse after half the time

[Music]
[Applause]
shooting tournament
[Music]

better
[Music]
[Applause]

[Music]
five girls in about half the time
my good temper
oh and then I stopped messing up

[Music]
seven girls
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
I'm not imagining things am I
I might find many things
[Music]
come one girl yeah it's only definitely
feels slower it starts
[Music]
and there was just pictures
still messing up after just one girl
here goes yeah
[Music]

[Applause]
[Music]
thank you on another one

clipper
[Applause]

that works
there we go it's fine guns already
[Music]
this is a
highest seven girls put inside one
second that's amazing
oh the game is starting to cheat now
they're only 29 seconds I mean
that's that's Danny he left for good
this time thanks for everything buy it
all right found another one into those
trophies to be used for you but I'm
afraid that it'll fly off again see what
did I tell you I think I think he left
because he found playing against spider
was boring at this point
but I wasn't playing Fair anymore new
captured Stella
parking
cheers
thank you that took way too many
attempts
way too many Sims everything is
completed completed 100
okay 11.
way too many I think
[Music]
well I used to everything the game game
[Music]
and then there's two levels
there is I I missed that one in both
[Music]
wow you've been busy that's a lot of
pipelines there should be enough power
here for me to open the gate
stand back
she's doing some
really weird motion story planes let's
go next world
okay now I know I didn't
I was kind of missing audio redeem by
the way
[Music]
is it one more time like six attempts
again yeah I know
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
trying to travel to the story planes
even now
ambushed again
[Music]
he looks bigger than the last time we
ran into him watch out for his rocket
spiral he actually looks smaller to be
honest
challenge
I've learned quite a bit from our
lasting country
I don't know what I'm so sick anyway my
new armor is
independent triple
is Imperial that means that it's
penetrable from inside the certainly
Philippines right
oh it does make it hard to move down
oh
no wait
nice
many sheep around
no
okay
nice very nice
not ashamed
he creates voice
out
I mean they had different voices that
you can't remember what this sound like
and now he's naked
this can't be happening beaten by my own
missiles again it doesn't matter if the
secret volcano that is almost complete
and you'll never fight your way in on
your own never or exploded he committed
suicide
is that you
you it was the first one goof was about
to use me as target practice as a reward
for freeing me I don't remember seeing
anyone
I ain't going to give you a fairy Health
space from now on you'll be able to take
one extra hit before you do sparks
how about two hits extra hits
thanks for asking inspired oh you're
just so Keen
um isn't it supposed to be a wall up
here or something these pipes just go
against nothing enough
is that a scene in the tech background
texture I see there a very obviously
this one on the outside here
[Music]
oh you want to remove the dress sure
you can't do that
yay
upon fun reviewing games all right
Sparks is the height
[Music]
so how does the extra hit point Works in
I here
because yes the red level which it
really should have implemented in
every opportunity
because it's so much much clearer
lemon
[Music]
and I assume if I had Sparks when I got
that the red level would have been added
but since I didn't have Sparks
like I would have to block the next yeah
he's lining
and
I can't charge it so I need to learn a
new move
these moving platforms are really scary
but they're pretty useful just jump on
them until take into it they're headed
some are cute I hope but there's another
one of those fireflies they must have
quite a lot of them
now
do you mean if I step on a scene that
moves I will I will follow along to
where it moves that's Mackenzie
Chinese things
now it was a gym here and more stuff
here but I guess
I guess I can check out that platform
but I suspect there's that level on it
I can't do anything with this knowing so
this level against section
[Music]
you've put it
it's more here
so there's another one there
but now it's an easy night yeah
we know what hit them
uh and yeah I guess I will and it didn't
help me if I wanted to
do you want them to know but I win
anyway
[Music]
like yes I want to no I don't want to
but I'll do it anyway and then no I
don't want it
laughs
all right
no scenes
those things
Okay so
this I have its agent line and Canada
is that there's no way to look around
I guess you can't look up and down that
beat so they have like that but it's not
the stand that controls of spire
four three
and uh
you don't have the map
it does do this trying to look more for
it which is nice
so it's kind of
takes away a few things of what made uh
she's not playing good
win
in his best character though I mean yeah
[Music]
[Music]
Okay so
I do think Sheena Instagram
foreign
again
I should definitely nothing but yeah
you decided
they just have some bad shots
yes me
butt shots not too confused with
questions I guess it wasn't because
last time there was a gym
anyway checkpoint
what is this
a bomb okay oh it's gone
I guess as you can see
[Music]
or do they just save I have this
checkpoint because I'm standing too
casting to find
another stuff
or I can't
always I see so what you can do is do
this
and then you can hide
but I guess I guess so
but it's worth itself
few
[Music]
oh excuse me
it helps raise health
I checked by this kind an account
when those mines are in the background
[Music]
oh my
God
[Music]
Okay so
[Music]
um I found the secret 25 let's destroy
his scene whatever
oh nice
okay
okay that's the 25
it was a good chance
um yeah

can't remember I'm jumping
