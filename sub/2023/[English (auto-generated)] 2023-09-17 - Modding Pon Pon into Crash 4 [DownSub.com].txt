there you go there they
are oh look it this pon pon modding pon
pon I do have my emote on screen at the
moment I can switch that switch around
if you
want
so that's cover
with the
comments I don't need to see that I had
no other way to say I had have it
ready
fin I don't know so this is the latest
one I made I made
the blo oh doesn't have t now I name
thee H but I just couldn't make it
animate
correctly cuz that's fine that anim like
I mean there's some clipping but that
doesn't matter not sure what I would do
to be but I don't know it looks fine
here I guess this is very
[Music]
solid so yeah I I'll just
ignore ignore the CL will be CL but for
this day I wanted to do
one you might recognize this character
after trict
anything multiple Parts
here
[Music]
so this is not the true size of
is so I wanted to do
is the dress like I had a FL of that
character of
that of
M she actually don't
remember the the bridge
are
so here's the
[Music]
dress so I will try
to it is very very
low kind of small yeah yeah I'm not
planning on
like putting this straight on Pon P I
mean I guess I could but is that
anym know how about
just can of wi too there we go
perfect m but
now yeah but I wasn't planning on doing
it that
way so will place the that and LIF up
that
b body there you
go
so I can the volume on the everything
sounds F here
come back and
me so I'm basically I
think take this
[Music]
part this
being and then I'll make that into armor
s so let's copy that first that's a good
start this is how you
[Music]
work I can body here
reference no audio problems on my end no
audio on
your
so yeah I need to hide the ears again oh
hiding
ears let's call it
ears and this will
be dress
sleeves
go oh yeah I need to off this
thing it might clip through the B bit I
don't
think I think that's
[Music]
fine I was say it's
[Music]
fine
[Music]
there we
go it's not as
poofy as
poofy let's make
it
more
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
poofy and that was very proofy I think
on that's that first part of me is the
head tie thing which I need I was
thinking about putting to of hand on top
of her head and putting that I think
like that around I think that can
[Music]
work
[Music]
so
[Music]
[Music]
pump on
stream no to have that
a reference
picture think
I maybe I don't have it
actually well that Cas I have
it there we
go perfect
so I can use it to determine how I
will from coming H
active yeah I don't have like I like if
I do the gift it's going to be small
I I use
one I
have
a
[Music]
small so this B is quite high so it's
probably don't
be I
Happ I think this works I think the
seves are
fine
[Music]
I
[Music]
could do like
that I just put this textures
somewhere somewhere
stream I got plenty of three space
I'm H noticed I'm
not as I usually forget with the preview
there go now I can see it while I'm
working see what's showing on the
stream so I should prepare a texture for
this I feel
[Music]
like
so that will
be green different shades of
green and very appropriate to make sure
the the texture you the mapping is very
flat
getting nice and sharp and um edges on
the texture of the
thing textures of the
thing so making D sketches and put put
him on as some well it would be as a
reference
yes
yes I will make my own because I kind of
have to make it fit on on
anyway
mind here we
go so I'm call this little bad a quality
is a B for
now but because it is not like it's not
regular
outfit I don't think the outfit in the
game in the mod should be called isand
it should probably have some not
creative
name so I can remove the bra that's not
going to be
included but I got all of
these space I
[Music]
think yeah basically this part is free
for me to use so I will save this
texture goo
B
that now it's
bad and then in
blending this one which is currently
using this I just switch
to wait do I already have no that's one
of the already existent
ones I take one of
those one I
made it to B
I don't know we look in
sh that's
sing just replace this
one with the one I made for
B and then I clear the rest for now cuz
I don't have those textures come
on oh
shiny
okay I'll probably have to do this
then switching over to B let's see what
I'm working
with this one I'm just play somewhere
you can see
the lines on perfectly straight
here they are
here it looks fun Mak very shiny and
things but yeah I do have
to
wait there we
[Music]
go and this point here just
between so doesn't
matter the
gave me an idea for a robot there is
an is a Coco robot there there's a robot
and there's a
cyborg I'm sure that those are some
ideas let's make this so accurate as I
can
even plate armor that's
something robot custume there turn F
turn action
robot well the idea was to make p inter
actual
robot
so now I just need to
determine
but I can see there's three dark three
light I do need these Shades there's
three of
them should I copy copy it from the from
their texture or would that be
considered too much stealing I can
always mix them
up that's no
problem they can't claim
me
they w't know anything even though I
making a stream and I W see what I'm
doing while watching the stream but
still will definitely be watching this
[Music]
stream so here we
go this is a light
color this is the medium
color and this is dark
[Music]
color I think I did that
uh another time where I basically took
two two
images and mix them together to
get
I just need to find
[Music]
it okay I can't find one I actually like
the look of H the
[Music]
struggle so I
got this
artwork so so it is a nice like dark
here but this one is too
similar so yeah that's a nice dark these
are very this is a nice
light but
I I'll do this and then I'll mix them up
slightly there we go now it's completely
original colors no one can claim it and
I taking them from
[Music]
anyone oh that's cute yes I should post
the link to this
artwork and this is a in different
outfits I don't sure why she looks so
sad
there she she should have
bikini well anyway the link let me get
link uh did here
[Music]
link s is
provided BL
happy
thatw workk 81 36 35 that's the unique I
[Music]
need
if you want to know how to write uh all
you need to do is basically this is a
random fact about demon tart if if you
see like this link on the screen and you
don't want to type out everything I
understand if you're like watching The
Vault or something you can go to any
artwork on demant AR and then you only
change the numbers at the end with those
nine numbers provided here in the link
that's all you have to do and then you
will get this
artwork there you
go wait when I lo to Imaging Cash when
he
soon although I do realize that I forgot
about the dark green as well because
there's
the that
on that put under there then I need to
get that from the other texture as
well this
one there you
go that would be the colors I working
with be I can't
speak that will be the colors I will be
working with is that
great
so I will sa this uh I will export the
the
UV so I can open it up here I should
this don't need it
anym need that
one did it save it looks like it did
there here's where sleep able to
[Music]
go so let's see
how does that work yeah it
does
so it should have the lighted part on
the front I
think somewhere like
here
[Music]
yeah and then there's going to be six of
them is there six is this divisible by
six 1 2 3 4 5
6 coming 13 that's that's a prime number
and but there is almost 12 so it's
almost divisible by
six well I'm annoying
yeah I don't need I could just by six
[Music]
anyway I think that's yeah this is good
front
and and this will be this
part so I call this okay that work it's
is group or group it's Swedish but yeah
it doesn't show up on
[Music]
screen there we go now you can see it
says group it's tiny text and
dress is
[Music]
my
[Music]
let's
[Music]
see
so what I need
is one 2 three 4 five
6 yes I want need
six and then I'm going
to evenly space them out like
this
and then I need to pick I
this not sure why I
that
[Music]
[Music]
so it's going to
be
[Music]
of course it's not going perfect because
it's not
perfectly where I
[Music]
[Music]
went some
panning
and then there's going to be a
background to
this which I will do in this
[Music]
corner like that starting out good yes
and
now
or the other way
[Music]
around and this part
here see do
this Del need that and what's
left these parts should be the darker
color no dark color I said and these
parts should be the lighter
color and then bring back to Reg there
you go that's
some that's some
pattern
let's say bat is what I'm placing
now even though this does not look like
a b
yeah so update
who very shiny I
gu
maybe more
do just just a bit more
make it look a bit more
even update there we go let's move this
Mark know is there some artifact in here
I don't see that's correct turn well
let's fix the shining and stuff just
distracting yeah that's metallic too SLE
kind kind of shin yeah yes I'll get to
that ho your
horses so my is going to be yeah I'm
pretty sure there's not going to be any
metal in
this I'm not sure why I got that
feeling
so copy the unexisting metal which is
just
blank normal
[Music]
map yeah I don't think there's going to
be any normal
map not yet at
least so but it still needs to be a
normal
map cuz there's other values that have
like the there's other other normal
stuffing normal stuffing normal mapping
going
on and then the roughness which is
determining what it's going to look
shiny or
not
here I would like to
[Music]
know how shiny stuff are
[Music]
on and Coco
what is a good outfit I can look at
the chin
on an outfit that has a similar color
and a
similar
material there is one with a dress but
um
sure I could look at that
actually cuz there's
this and the roughness looks like
this so what you have
here where's the part
that this part that's kind
of yeah that's kind of that that kind of
no that's
not just thinking about the no maybe she
doesn't have any white maybe
everything's
black but anyway she does have the
shorts under her
dress they have this roughness so I'll
take
that as the shade I will
use let's see what did you say I don't
have any horse pluses to hold can I just
hold a k
or hold your
Kar hold your kangar we getting
there so back to blender now see this
very shiny SC it's only that's only not
shiny it's kind of fractal like that's
the correct term it's CR of the nor
map so what we'll do here is
open one
map and then L here so now it's flat no
no longer fractal
effect this is the metal it doesn't have
any metal so it's this is not going to
do anything but now I at least loaded
the
image but this is is the roughness this
is what I need at the
moment here we
go and switch as
one no it's not
shiny now it's like rough
like my car is holding me down oh
by oh oh
my
[Music]
the rest of ponon can also have the same
material this it needs
to and of
[Music]
course she does need her H panties this
one not sure how well that's going to
show on the need to dress CU I'm going
to add a lot of so
called pett coats or under
skirts depending on how fancy you want
to
[Music]
be you're going to
have I almost feel like there should be
more
that's something I can adjust later on
as well
but I do feel like there should almost
be more if I TR
[Music]
eight so
1 2 3 4 5 6
78 even
spaced and then I take these but adjust
them and that should be as easy
as doing
that not
that
[Music]
I I can see there we
[Music]
go and there and then the final one
going to go between
there like
that going out eight Stripes instead of
C even though the original had six it
doesn't need to be a perfect copy of it
it should look good as
well after
[Music]
one uh that AO kind of reminds me think
she's cold since I tend to stand with my
arms away from my body when I'm cold
reason is when it's that cold my skin is
drying cracked all over my body and
causes pain when my arms touch my
sight you're not built for cold I
guess nor you will bring your arms
towards yourself
there keep keep your arm
ke there we
go I think that's
bad why
is I mean it's probably not going to be
sh from
distance
then it goes on inside like
that like
this than just
stupid at least that's
B
anyway it's
fine it's just me being
over H that's why I hate cold W show you
can just put on more layers yeah but
those layers don't stop my skin from
cracking and hurting I don't know seems
like you
don't dress appropriately I don't know I
don't know maybe you don't have good
winter
clothes your your skin is not built for
C should should have B be down here
should be up
here somewhere between
someone here I
think so this will be
the dress
band and
plane tiny
plane large plane I'm going to do this
scene again
in I did a while
ago determine how sick this band should
be it could be kind of sick I
think you're not too
sick
okay can't of s but
T there you
go I do that and then I do the intersect
span
ban um
swap
uh Union
[Music]
intersect maybe no no this is good this
is
good the second
now is this what I want
it this looks to be what I
wanted and then I dissolve these
[Music]
edges there we go
beautiful
beautiful to make C you H night this
week as low as
22 celsius as high as
24 oh this sounds like a pretty good
weather I would like that that's
like nice co
weather can wear a nice
dress that's Jack no that's
[Music]
just a
nice
press
how far out this
be maybe like
this wasn't there tool for
this when I could spin that Slide by
This Not That
One
well please let me see do everything
and then I add PL modifier and that
should
be
solidify there you
go
not exactly what I'm looking
for I preer before no that that's when I
M that's when I
die
[Music]
eat stroke or
[Music]
something that's the temperature you
wash clothes
[Music]
in
[Music]
so I think there
yes
need be that much
but
D wrong way
again want to like the spaghetti
mist and then turn into an essal
bunny how do you miss
[Music]
spaghetti
oh I miss the
spaghetti don't I feel silly
now don't you hate it when it lick
spaghet and miss
it
I think this one goes here I mean it
doesn't need to go here but I want put
here and I want it to the edge
here like
that doesn't matter
but I like
back there you
go
from do
that export iage
export you
temp maybe she was blindfolded yeah I'm
still up for that idea I will play
through Spyro one
blindfolded I wanton actually be
blindfold because otherwise I can't chat
or anything but I would just not look at
the game screen
okay that's the
[Music]
idea could I be cheating well yeah but
that wouldn't be fun for me I'm doing to
have fun
myself
am I looking
for
nothing wait I did I just realized what
I
mean that
this I realized I deleted
the this I it doesn't even need to me
this long
in fact it doesn't need it doesn't need
to be this
long let me
well I don't yeah yeah because I'm not
going to do
anything
special with it I don't
think yeah currently I'm singing am I
going to do something with it cuz it's
just going to be in this
area making sure it's nice and that
doesn't matter too
much
wait did I did I yeah I messed that
up one F messing up
unacceptable
[Music]
unbelievable
there we go now I just need
to make sure it has the correct
color
clor and I should go back and reat
again so instead of the spaghetti she L
the wall instead
why are you
[Music]
saying are you saying that pon pon is so
silly that she would lick a wall instead
of
[Music]
spaghetti and know if that's a form of
[Music]
insult
[Music]
there we go this is the color I want
completely
orinal it's not the one taking straight
from game and nor the one straight from
that
artist totally original trust
[Music]
me
[Music]
it's not even 5050 between
this it wasn't there or something oh it
was blindfold
okay just blindfolded and also
[Music]
there and
[Music]
I was thinking if
[Music]
the no different here they didn't bother
making
[Music]
me the boy shorts as I to claim them to
be have a different
color
I wonder shiny that going to
be cuz I'm I was thinking the this the
band is probably going to be more shiny
than the
clothing I think that's the fin reason
so
now what did okay you short
nothing
[Music]
and
now and and then I change the roughness
something oh okay that's kind of shiny
kind of bit too shiny
maybe I there you're probably not
bad it is probably this
shiny okay
[Music]
right although it could have a point in
the middle which I
could shink just just ever so slightly
there we go do give me the high
[Music]
resolution they said she wouldn't be
able to sete spaghetti blindfold she was
about to do but someone cheated and mve
the spaghetti she like the then because
a f bunny then became a fair B to avoid
judgment
okay that seems like the most reasonable
thing to
[Music]
do
and as we know pon pon possesses the
ability to just turn into F feral Bunny
at any
[Music]
point own pH
and
everyone's fear fun
pun this should be an address and I
guess it goes all the way
up Jing from
[Music]
the oh
and
[Music]
I doing that's turning into a paral
bunny is the the
most the most logical
conclusion the best way to avoid
judgment I know that from experience
since you know I am pon pon off
all so this one should also be part of
the dress it's a useful ability never
know when you'll be need to become a f
BN
judgment specific to avoid judgment and
nothing
else
[Music]
the ability to
turn between un through and feral at any
point mytic face
again so it should be
address I see if I can turn
this should be PL
[Music]
here oh janeta coming in with a
link here is the
face F taste
sweet I'm a bit worried now how you know
that have you tasted
me when I taste a bit salty I don't
know no I'm not salty I've never salty
i' never been
salty no
liing you are not allowed to lick the
princess by order of
[Music]
um
someone queen says
emote J to be fair in real life I
probably would prefer if people didn't
come around and lick
me if we did
that
hey if we did that funun me
that would be nice if people didn't try
to lick
me not very convincing since that
princess doesn't stop it oh me and also
the current princess just right now in
the process of leing again I'm a
princess
now
and my princess
now so I hope this doesn't show too much
like doesn't show up
below the
band well we we'll
see there we go yeah this looks
good yeah this is good doesn't show on
man good
good over said rest below it is the body
because I would add a skirt to be a very
poofy
skirt now since
one well I didn't
SP I have always been a princess do not
believe in any
lies
so let's
um are pattern
that the first princess in all the
world
now
so it's going to be yeah I'm going to
have a series of of
things how many I don't
know the number of
them
that one is probably
to that that
one
is uh this
stripe
good CU it need to be evenly spaced oh
no this is
terrible this is terrible this is this
doesn't
work this is terrible this is
awful
yeah I need another
approach
okay I'm pressing the WR button That's
why nothing
happen
so what I will
do he's trying to determine
how
okay of course the time this time does
continue up there I mean that Mak sense
and this no no
no
we don't use the word difficult
here we don't we don't we don't use d
word
[Music]
here
so
w
nothing wrong with more difficult Oh no
you're using the d
word how dare
you Tes my sandwich
yeah you got the ear
here tee
eye is nor
[Music]
it
B I think that did
it
maybe no it
didn't no what this intersecting
everywh what are you talking
about
they are intersecting
[Music]
everywhere inter B
[Music]
in oh yeah
yeah okay that one's working I can see
the black line
there that one is working it looks maybe
yeah it looks to be
working
good now I just need
to get rid of all of
this I didn't expect this
[Music]
stay hold on
[Music]
[Music]
maybe I'm here to lur K bunny welcome by
happy happy to have you luy in
here my job is difficult but that's what
make it enjoyable keeps my mind busy so
the right goes by quick so the night
goes by quickly I was playing spy
yesterday and and had a difficult
Speedway level to do to go for 100% made
clearing the LEL much more
[Music]
satisfying
[Music]
you look at
[Music]
that someone is employing they
[Music]
use often d
[Music]
word
wa yeah yeah
yeah a
minut something7 in
here and then I for to disolve edges
who
[Music]
weird okay whatever
[Music]
I should probably do one at a
time like that this me this
line and we in line
but but the line I have to
[Music]
follow problem problem with turning into
F butt is she doesn't like the lick
spaghetti maybe she lies the spaghetti
when you're Lu Li
[Music]
oh yeah wait I only need to do because I
got the upper lower and up I only need
to do every other silly
[Music]
me I am such a silly bon
bon
the silliest of all the most
silly such a mess
of a mess of Po
what is it
like doesn't
matter the d
m
and
then find one right this one more wait a
minute I could I could select every
other just at the same time that be
silly
again why why isn't anyone telling me
that I'm just being
silly
everyone
just looking at me doing silly silly
stuff and not telling me just sitting
there laughing at
me there you
go this is what I should done from the
start making me
cry
[Music]
looks a bit weird without
this looks kind of weird this moment too
but of course I could change the map to
make simplify the bit I guess
I
gu but who wants to simplify it when he
when it's more fun not
to
[Music]
what do you
mean nothing nothing at
all don't mind
me I'm just being a bit
silly
[Music]
I didn't say anything even know how to
do an just the wor
anything
[Music]
okay let's say that's
[Music]
true but secretly you know everything
[Music]
made
Fone I I
not
[Music]
there we
[Music]
go
we should probably start from the
middle right didn't there we
go but I like hearing your
[Music]
input and then I can skip straight down
here PR is a gap in the model there
anyway which could help avoid
any weird texture bed
ises that I will call it don't know if
that would be correct term in this
situation
not like I know every time
like talking about Quantum Flags before
which I might have been wrong about
[Music]
everything a Quantum flag
expert Quantum flag
expert show then shows up
the comments of the
V and explains in detail how everything
works
[Music]
flag Flags playing on Friday
yes and next Thursday thir day
Thursday Thursday
day there will be more Quantum
Flags
ftic but that's not
English and what is Thursday in
Swedish
[Music]
that's the me
[Music]
question
[Music]
good question trying to remember can
went we t on already okay go through all
seven weekday and see how many you
[Music]
remember
[Music]
they're kind of spelled like they are
written not
like the first one could be arguably if
they correctly spelled or not
[Music]
but
and the last day as well first M do
there
[Music]
go one could argue that it should be
spelled with two ends because it's not
Mand do but M
do and I could agree with that
argument and I wouldn't mind spelling
with two
hands if I did spell it with two hands
that
but of course might confuse
people I'm willing to do
[Music]
it te do there you
go and because it's not t dog but T Dog
it is Corless but now this one looks
really weird but it should hopefully
work
one
no
there we go so much better than
before so so much
[Music]
better oh no the St PES are too
[Music]
small you know what I actually that the
stripes are too
small so what I will
do is do a very very quick
end should hopefully not
be too tricky to
do so what's the turn
name Wen St well that would be the
origin of the
name you
know you has similar similarly to how in
English you kind of skip the middle part
and Swedish does that too but Swedish
has actually corrected the spelling to
match that
pronunciation you something English
doesn't
do so it is therefore not spelled that
me because it's not pronounced me what a
novel concept
is sweet sping
Cy
it's basically the just the the in the
middle that is not
pronounced so it's
pronounced so it's very close
too that would do
meaning well not how how would
you that's that's how you pronounce it
when your nose is toughed or what you
you
say w
St well it was UN
St m
[Music]
how much do I want to move it down move
down by maybe I should move on the top I
one maybe maybe just
slly bye
m
One stock there you go now you got
[Music]
it 3 weeks St down four more to go and
the next one is
Thursday or next one the upcoming
one the names if not already obvious are
quite related to the English names
[Music]
Dan similarities can be
seen just one of the days are
not and there's is one of the things
between Swedish and English that has
different origin the other six days have
the same
origin I know the origins is something
like th do yes but uh Thor is not called
Thor in Swedish because the the sound
doesn't exist in Swedish and
therefore
H what what would there be replaced with
in
Swedish and the hint is kind of in the
spelling of the
sound to do there you go and the r
modifies the S so it becomes a sh sound
to
dog of course unless you're in like
Finland or something in that case they
probably say they say something like T
do or if they're more heavy finish
accent is a to dog there
go this one is the for dog there you
go the next one is the only one that has
not the same origin as the English name
which would be sad
today uh almost that's the wrong
vowel is the one that looks very
[Music]
similar there dog there you
go L
dog because L ends with an R sound in
mod the dean dog and pronounce say l
dog anyway yes that has no connection to
Saturday because Saturday is as far as I
know referencing
Saturn the God not the
planet but my L dog in reference uh well
it means like washing day wash up
they a word which as far as I know
doesn't exist in
Swedish let me check that do comes from
old Swedish is the pronunciation this
otherwise is L
hard and uh from all
North lard dogs from La
L but as far as I can see it does not
exist in modern
Swedish it does exist in English
as lie
so if we took the Modern English
spelling for the name and app Play Day
the spelling the equ with English name
of that day would be Li
day but maybe you don't want the name of
the day to be lie day I mean you could
argue it's the day you were lying down
the whole day which is probably the F
atmology for that name
but it means too
much it it turn into the meaning of
soap so uh while the original meaning
was the washing day it kind of turned
into the meaning of soap
thing
I mean I guess you're using soap soap is
made for Li so
[Music]
yeah and then yes and then it has been
even more specific in referring
to what Li the
uh the arine
[Music]
liquid
exactly that just meant washing in
general then it meant to mean so and
then it now it means lie when in English
well in Swedish it was completely
dropped obvious then the question
is and the what the Swedish word for lie
is which is
loot what does that come from
[Music]
wasn't know
say it it doesn't they don't really know
where since how it came into
Swedish so I guess the modern Swedish
name of L dog would be loot
dog lot
Fisk
f
like I guess English is
do and Swedish you not for to
eat what you do in Norwegian so in no
reason it could be L
theist and in finish it
is got spish is a complet language
family anyway moving down back to the
moding and finally what's the final day
of the week and I forgot
Sunday it's very very similar to
English
just with a different
vowel soon star no no it's
it's it's still s and
n uh but with a different vow
[Music]
between again not exactly sure probably
maybe the
the split in meaning there with split in
sound changes
maybe anyway
[Music]
let's there it is
and this should be the dark
stripes see if this is
M it's worth a
[Music]
try I I'll keep the old
one soon do well
close it's the same v as
in
this sound became quite
fronted Sun dark there you go
beautiful now you know the weeks of the
Swedish swed Swedish
week similar to the English
ones
so I made a copy of these so I
can if I select all of these and
this them
wait
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I
can do be annoying
then so I can select more points but I
can't SCT
them
one
oh more like the English ones are
similar to The Swedish I would argue
both are similar to each other it's not
like SW or englishes or
like both both are modern
languages
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yeah people trying to I've seen it
before people trying to date which
language is the oldest or something
which doesn't make
sense like every language is
evolved
and from
something and where you consider the
language to be the only way you can
argue that I guess
this uh two ways either it's actually a
madeup
language like of course espiranto is
probably one of the most well-known
madeup languages H or this is like a
pigeon which is based on all languages
but is is made up
for a specific
situation
those languages you could probably
pinpoint age
on there's also like the death death
Death
communities where you have
like people who haven't learned uh any
sign language basically making up a
completely new sign language within that
Community but that sign Lang might be
replaced by an
actual well developed in Sign Language
the sign language would also be like
made
up even though people AR doing done
signs before but someone would like
notify it or
something think s is existed in some
form or another longing English I mean
that that's kind of my that's so that's
kind of what I'm trying to say where
that how like when do you consider it
being a separate language
because English came from
something it wasn't even official record
Lang England for the first couple years
yeah but that doesn't mean it didn't
[Music]
exist like that that's that's the thing
with the whole
oh old this language thing
like when do you consider it a separate
language
like at some point someone consider it
English but
hello
Miriam we talking about languages here
what else would you
talking
and I'm making a dress for ponon
green how are
you it's it's been
stuff stuff has happened a lot of
different stuff has happen very hard
to let's let's not speak that's kind of
joke I've went with recently what people
have asked me how I
am like let's let's not talk about how
it's and I do know that
like kind of at the same time
how it it's kind of like cultur
differences when people ask like how are
you they aren actually asking how you
are he it's
you not the own ways but uh sometimes
like
like maybe it's more of a question how's
like recent EV been what's
happening I don't know I don't know I I
I I'm socially awkward I'm socially
napped I don't know how to
socialize ah
Hy this evolution it's races or breeds
if you
want I think it was still a dialect of
what it what what was it German but
language right yeah but that's the thing
but that's the thing
like languages are so fluid you can't
really say like now it's officially not
a dialect anymore now it's now it's a
language unless you really want to go
with some kind of
it has to be recognized by some
government but in that case languages
did not exist before governments were I
seen in the uh hter Gathering societies
with they probably have some form of
government but probably not one that
would officially recognize the language
and even when governments existed they
might not have officially recognized
language as I
obviously that's nothing we could check
now but but in the topic of old this
language that's not going to be a to go
on I don't know I'm technical or
something in the the nor Lang were
established as SE from ger well yeah but
they were nor language a nor language in
that
case yeah I don't know
I guess you could go by but I don't know
it's it I I think my my main issue here
is it it becomes too
[Music]
misleading I think there I guess it's I
guess you could
like go by the definition of well here
is Old English here Old English was
established there for English is this oh
I don't know age of language doesn't
really
matter it's nice to see again after a
while it's nice to see you
too I hope you have a good time here
talking about random stuff here stuff
that are hard to Define really like what
is a
[Music]
language cuz sometimes they are
considered dialects and some sometimes
language really really depends on if a
government cons a separate language the
seroc creation languages are considered
separate languages because the
governments of those countries have said
so while the Chinese languages are
consider dialects because the Chinese
government has said
so so I think I the same here I do want
to
it does not look like same
any
visibly don't carry
me yeah Lang same problem as Evolution
this
chance flid that there is no
real but the change is so yeah the
change is fluid and slow and so on so
yeah it's like what's the oldest animal
that's also a question you can't
really I guess yeah it's it's really
hard to tell when when did it become
this specific animal when did it when
like such a transitional period but I
guess you could say at certain point a
certain animal didn't exist
games you know the watch slow and slow
person
that what just means word in the
language branch that the morning Lang
sent
from in Polish the word for word is w
w
well when
when yeah
[Music]
but maybe we
[Music]
should I don't
know
I just meant that isic tries could
commun with with they couldn't speak
to well I mean I didn't know any about
that
[Music]
there's the one thing I've
heard being said is how the old Germanic
was a based 12
system the language because uh they're
on unique terms up to 12 and at 13 you
goes back to like the
three but sure it's the third but close
enough well 12 has not much connection
to two that's the thing I've
heard being said
[Music]
before so if you understand shio was SL
if
not
one
[Music]
yeah uh but the thing is if you were to
look at the meaning behind 11 and 12
where it evolves from it means 11 means
one uh like one
additional and twow two additional
like two Beyond or something like that
so it's still based on 10 in the
[Music]
end so it might actually not have
anything to do with
this of course the yeah the the counter
argument here would be with what would
it have special terms for LEL 12 but not
for
13 and that's a a good
question and because people are does not
people don't make
sense when they make make up
systems just look
at BR
sizes the European system is fine but if
you look at the the English
system I don't know what they were
thinking and it has and and I could see
similarities with that to the number
system even it sounds kind of weird
because because the English system go
goes like this it's it's a b c it makes
sense then you have d a double D because
all of a sudden you should have double
letters and then it's e and then it's F
so no more double letters but then you
have double F because they just remember
they need double letters from now on
they kind of forgot the double e there
might be a reason that might skip that
one but it's so
weird so
uh they could have done similar SC with
the numbers like yeah after 10 we have
one more and then two more and then no
wait we we should change the season we
should have three three t or like to
three + 10 or something like that
instead it that sounds better but let's
not change the previous numbers those
are already established and but let's
not use that system of
counting and then you have that weird
split
that's very
weird but at least I don't have to deal
with the English
processes or processes all because I
don't really can't really use it
is this
correct very very weird nice I'm not
even showing what I'm working on cuz
apparently
I'm uh I have these previous screens to
see what I'm doing but I not changed the
view for all this talk I have while I'm
working that's
me he must of to make local sense but
that often
ends yeah all laugh thing I know is how
to score
what Papa wolf here sorry for ignoring
you by the way for one
minute not sure you also know
that I've been using that name for all
my game
characters
so
now if I go back here and update this
there we go

silly lesson of today don't try to do
something
[Music]
impossible that just that's just
silly
right why doesn't that
work oh I guess these are separate
feeling
merge there
go now I can
this there go
let
see thanks YouTu is Sil in
oh it does mean a lot to me let me say
that I'm I'm silly I say silly stuff
don't take everything I say to
Serious sometimes I say stupid

[Music]
what what am I
doing
wait oh wait now I
see that's what's going on I'm see
again Ste is nearly same thing as
kit
oh am I cute
what you saying I'm
[Music]
cute should probably pinch this together
just
[Music]
SL as if
you not you don't believe that
yourself no I don't believe
it not P
Tre can't not that this matter too
much thises doesn't matter
any hellow maybe is see
laging
okay
intersect okay
now it might be closer to I want what I
want without me doing
some some impossible
[Music]
thing it is recommended to not do
anything that is
impossible I've heard the success rate
of that is very
low
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I did not understand this message
what
I'm I'm sorry I'm not sure how I
could well hopefully it doesn't cause
you any
harm sucess to have
what what wait uh people out get my
message now I'm confused us I thought my
message was very
clear maybe it
wasn't I did not understand what he said
kind of
okay okay maybe I yeah sometimes I don't
speak clearly I said do not try
something that is impossible because the
success rate is very
low I hope I spoke clearly this time I
do know I don't
speak I don't speak clearly every time
cuz even I have trouble understanding me
when I listen back to the vs
afterwards ah you do remember sometimes
there yeah I
[Music]
know I
know and it's an on with hand and people
can could I be a redeem you
mumbling speak up speak
clearly yeah I
do I do Mumble it's I think it mostly
happens when I'm speaking mostly to
myself but I guess it's to you people
but do you
people
so I think let's see so I loaded this
one
here yeah and then I want to create a
mask according to
this so how do you know what is
impossible
well trying to figure out everything
that is
impossible sounds
impossible Annunciation comes with
practice I remember my Seer coach
yelling at me about it a
lot and then you said and then you said
back sorry I can't understand you while
you're
yelling yelling yelling can't believe
this C to all of us listening for her
and she be mumbling to herself
I mean you're not writing anything it's
your fault everyone's
[Music]
fault that that's that's how that's how
it is sometimes I
been but I I would definitely say that
I'm better at speaking now than when I
started so sadly the very first
V is not available well you can watch my
very second stream at
least so I need a
mask in my experience anunciation goes
with
practice anunciation
anunciation I don't know what the word
you're speaking
of little love both for
sure
I
mean
experience and
practice kind of goes hand in
hand
yeah I can only assume there's one
here
would say for to
kiss I don't
know could be
wrong yeah my speech gets worse s worse
oh
no no that doesn't sound
good that doesn't sound good at
all okay so I
will
go
around
here I don't know what I'm do with that
one I'll drop it
there oh yeah and then I go
around around and
around oh this is a
mess like
that
this and then
I adjust this
points
more
accurately
oh yeah
yeah I see what I'm
doing
then just adjust these
[Music]
points
[Music]
wait a minut why is
[Music]
there oh and they
crashed of course it did why wouldn't
[Music]
it well it has all the saving
[Music]
so
[Music]
I guess there's
nothing
[Music]
[Music]
interesting
I need to
just blend if it's properly on
screen again side is crash on
me delete that don't need that
anymore so I will add the
stripes
[Music]
[Music]
all
so
wait
no I want to that line
specifically
not delete
everything
um all right after I adusted positional
plan I should go back to show what I'm
ging
uh yeah I don't think having two screens
would help me
much I really wish it
could automatically switch to the
program I'm using without because I
don't want to share the whole whole
desktop it's more convenient for sure
but yeah I don't want to show
everything sake of
privacy
which I probably mentioned
before I do know I do know a lot of
streamers do Shadow hands desktop and
that's kind of Brave of them to
do showing
everything there you
go it's an interesting
pattern
hydrate 3 minutes ago but I did
not want to show
everything yeah what if you I don't
know all my pictures of
um pict
more
yeah imagine imagine if you I don't know
saw all my pictures of um bunnies that
would be kind of
embarrassing my collection
of bunnies dressing up put his
PL in Ni dresses or something you might
how embarrassing that would
be that would
be
[Music]
that would be so
embarrassing
now is on the Eve
E I would I would hide in
shame
[Music]
so this one should replace the normal
map because this one should not have the
F texture effect on
it so playing like
[Music]
that and then it should
also place here
to have
the roughness it's a slight difference
roughness but it is more
[Music]
accurate there we
go back to
blending update there we go look at this
that doesn't look bad does
it go I
this one
too and then CU as said it has this F
texture update now it doesn't have the f
t
anymore and then
like
just and I can adjust
it I
don't
somehow you make that
[Music]
sound I think that yeah
um
yeah I me know
it's part of the joke
but imagine pictures of bunnies in
like two TW or
something
doing
adorable
performances yeah it's good
enough and then with sleeves on top of
that hello lady oh roxies
welcome I'm is talking about super
innocent and Saucy things
apparently nothing nothing weird going
on
here and then there's all the stuff I
should delete don't need that
anymore
so then I just
need need more panties for
sassy I
mean I
mean
Cas uh P Pon will have
P she would wear a green I'm going to
say this is high up but it is very high
up on Isel to so it's going to have a
very poofy
dress let's Point short for this dress
boy is type of
panties even if has word boy in
it that's brief nice it's like boy
shorts
and P is for girls but with uh like
short
legs P Pon prefers to wear that it's
very comfortable
and I can agree with
that so I need
some you're changing the ear really
fast am
I I don't
know hello
[Music]
rexis
just I'm I'm quick you know I'm very
quick that's like wearing
pants so I mean so what I I find boy
shorts being really
cute I like wearing
wa phone's on the charger right now so
that's why I'm been quiet okay more s
Sassy one you want like bikini style
pant this maybe a song even I don't
think P would wear that she isn't
really fan of that she prefers to boy
shorts sure they they they are short
legs on on the panties but it's still
panties
like it's it's made for women to
wear not nice
and soft
fabric one piece weeps is are pretty hot
in my opinion yeah yeah let's let's
switch over to that SL here we go let's
Lo infection there
okay here's a one piece
[Music]
S I don't mind any P or something no
that definitely not
that that's definitely not
ponstein so f is to my left and I'm
right hand and makes difficult to right
well I guess you just have to practice
your left hand and
right let's switch back to this
side use left hand to type exactly just
get
experienced
so if I just if I do copy this even
though I shouldn't copy things from
other
mhes but then
I I'm have to
modify so it doesn't resemble the thing
anymore
anyway cuz I can play
Smooth no wait where that doesn't
help no wait
[Music]
soex smooth St again
cute
Marco
welcome I am happy to see you
here Marco
[Music]
Mouse you are more than
[Music]
welcome should I totally doing sing at
moment I I i
[Music]
w I'll do my do my
[Music]
wiing going to
see
[Music]
of course the SC needs to be longer than
this this is a bit too
[Music]
short when it doesn't even cover her
panties at don't one that's that's when
it's too short I think by
definition I think I think that's a good
definition yeah I didn't get m
[Music]
[Music]
one no no no
[Music]
duplicate I mean it's all about purpose
of set
SC
well I guess the purpose here is
to cover her up
so not not showing anything that
shouldn't be
[Music]
show
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so it's a bit
longer but it really shouldn't be like
yeah it should
be
[Music]
[Music]
can't yeah it could still still be quite
a short
dress
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so but of course much on
this let's see how white is that very
white let's do
[Music]
[Music]
just a scet I'm scared this
Mo yes Pon is waving to everyone coming
here hello W way welcome
in okay we
got bar pon pon here making here's the
creck one that's the that's that's the
Halloween
SE sketch RIT sketch rabbit is so
sketchy if you see sketch rabbit in real
life be careful
[Music]
if sketch rabbit tries to sell you
something do not
[Music]
accept sketch everything sketch Conta
sketchit SK with this
[Music]
real and you have to be
[Music]
careful sketch rabit is real sketch
rabit can hurt
[Music]
you
here we
[Music]
[Music]
go
[Music]
is is very very a lot forward I don't
know it should
be this
much it's a bit less
maybe maybe maybe wider instead
[Music]
okay let's see Shad smooth mix
normals uh change material to
Cocoa
B oh is her panties coming
[Music]
sketch rabbit is just misunderstood
sketch rabbit just wants a hug sketch is
made of sketchy
[Music]
lines if you were to see sketch shab is
and already
[Music]
alive I know how this this dress should
be
like might from this angle and need this
there you go it should be like
that maybe
not
well
so it it needs to be higher resolution
but I can do that
L sketch just needs to grow few pix
I think sketch rabbit need to grow a
whole solid
form where takes smooth can I do
that okay I this one is been
name
okay nice just so
far well thank
you
I wouldn't mind having one in real life
like
this oh too
much wait them can't
[Music]
WR
wa
[Music]
[Music]
I just do something like that that's
to scan
up how much is that I need to go out of
that
mod that seems to
be correct
amount good good
good bent lines this doesn't make any
sense well
yeah go to this it's it's a complete
dress I mean that's the SC part of the
dress I don't know what
happened is suddenly
sing it is um time flies we having
[Music]
fun when you're having fun with pon pon
the pon pon watching pon pon make make
us SC here
[Music]
so start to just a bit
more a two-piece
dress actually don't know I mean I I
imagine I'm going to fix that imagine
being like the skirt and the top are
like two separate fabric pieces and then
there's sewn together and then there's
the green strap
around so I imag it being just one
address and I remember sleeping and I in
here I've been sleeping the entire
time wait so you what
what so you didn't so you didn't get H
didn't you set an alarm to get first and
everything you didn't
work you were supposed to get
first what more should I do
I should have named this though
too
dress
scir I guess you need more
alarms
well it is
flopy
wait a
minute okay wait go back to
that I play game there you go no
more
[Music]
should
this I
think try to plant things out here this
gu is probably a be short but I don't
know don't
know I can make it
longer but it's kind of
nice maybe
maybe sniping sniping on me this seems
to be like to
White this
part maybe it's more
[Music]
[Music]
like
[Music]
my a lot before that doesn't sound
good and then you
get someone calling you why aren't you
at
work and then you have
to travel for an hour to
work being all
late I don't
know there we go there not the Gap
anymore I think this is good I should
make
this guess it should
[Music]
be
seems the sign like
that I'm wrong menu Mark
scene and wrong menu again
unwrap
[Music]
[Music]
good
over
here I was thinking how I want
[Music]
to
because that's good on the
[Music]
distress
and the squares are smaller up here and
large down here that doesn't make sense
in real life there's hold for T that PP
[Music]
that but I can do it this way even
though it doesn't make
[Music]
sense
[Music]
because it's a shorter distance up
here so you would have the
squash not ping equ
one also I could probably match these
two into
one
[Music]
there we
go and
then yeah like
this I think this shape makes more sense
down yeah I can probably place it down
here I'm going take
to like that that
good
export
don't don't get L
work hope the stream is working
[Music]
fine
[Music]
so back here
[Music]
I just didn't like this this
emot so I'm going to use it
[Music]
more I'm going to import the skirt UV
which is
[Music]
here then it's just question about how
many
squashes
[Music]
there a lot of
[Music]
paning
[Music]
we
[Music]
go
[Music]
[Music]
wa what's
[Music]
Happ the
[Music]
tree
so
[Music]
so
ping now let's see how this looks on the
[Music]
M that's the one I should
[Music]
replace
H yeah doing what you did that I
mean adding the counter
Stripes would
[Music]
have let's
see maybe maybe it should be
wi just look very there okay let me try
that how much
[Music]
Mr the
[Music]
[Music]
questions and
[Music]

better F yes that's the one I'm using
now okay let's do the counter
[Music]
strength have we played counter Stripes
go
it's
and this dark there
it a nice
tablecloth I prefer the old counter
Stripes so what's what's what's better
with
um what's what's better with that
[Music]
one there we
go let's add the
this one now as I said having this types
go like this makes
sense
but I don't need to do that I
could change it so
that it gu wi at the
bottom
but that doesn't make sense as a
fat but otherwise you get this B on the
side okay I'm ful it back there and
awake hello red Hello awake red red
awake have we played red
awake
the low quality Stripes allows for Clear
stripe
[Music]
definition you lost me
there
it was probably a really clever joke but
um I just don't get
[Music]
it
an amazingly funny
joke
[Music]
okay
what is
that get this
[Music]
inance
[Music]
assent
[Music]
H I'm trying to yes and
[Music]
yeah I mean I
I I'm
sorry if I didn't play along with you
joke
properly that dress is starting to look
really
nice and maybe I should have one in real
[Music]
life fun fun fun find fund my dress
need and I'll post photos of me wearing
the dresses on the Discord server if you
didn't know I have a Discord
server where I usually don't post
pictures of my
S don't join don't don't join in the
hopes of getting sing picture for
[Music]
me
[Music]
yes you should see someone supports the
dress
[Music]
fund I would do it I mean if if the
community buys me dresses I will
definitely take photos of me wearing the
dresses that's that you can be sure
about
I'll do it for
you you can buy me cute dresses
or or whatever kind of dresses you want
me to wear I wouldn't wear anything
though and there must be some
[Music]
restrictions yeah at this point I might
need to
I can see this back up again that's no
oh yeah because I have this
set
BP
BP
BP
BP I to get this instead I don't know
which is
better I don't
[Music]
know
I don't know what I can do like
that
cute we can dress up the pun pun she
likes our own she's like her own Barbie
yeah you can brush my hair undress me
everywhere okay I will not feature
that but I can
undress I can
dress
I can dress
up oh oh know I said the wrong
[Music]
thing we can un the fun fun
awward
well now as I said there's restriction
of what I would wear and I guess lack of
clothes would be one of those
restrictions it actually has to be some
kind of clothing that properly covers
[Music]
me but
[Music]
um I would definitely
like if we like find something I could I
could
confirm at
least but it looks like it's
Shadow
stand
no that's
[Music]
weird
interesting really looks like
the
oh no short on there we
go how
[Music]
embarrassing
yes Sons very
empar that's
me
yes
said I accept I accept the funding of uh
dresses which
which I can wear could be like skirts
and tops as
well I would um prefer
like maybe not
swimsuits might be a bit
too to form
fitting if that's a way good way to
describe
it and if I did that I can do the normal
mapping probably
[Music]
so that's not B
[Music]
option yeah concept I guess I just
but I mean I do think this explains
there two pieces is it impossible to
it's an impossible thing to do
otherwise he's a p p girl in the p p
World L spider it's
plastic by
I it's singing
time Sing
Sing give me this p legs still I'm still
a bit confused how I should proceed
[Music]
here yeah I can't separate this
enough
I had try life in plastic it's an
annoying place to
place yeah I could see
[Music]
that definely not the
easiest maybe I should just do this then
[Music]
d
singing the instrumental
music
that's p
p p p p p
p
right that's not like I wanted
that's not what I wanted at
all I'm not The Lyricist L Lyricist L I
know it's lyric but I want to say
resist maybe this
list I don't speak English
all right don't speak a single word
English yeah should I just
St
and I'm just doing a quick fix on un
map
export the answer reason my job is it
Notting music industry or
entertainment wait but but but you are
an
[Music]
Entertainer I should be able to move
this B
steps and my job is Logistics
logistic U my job is not
[Music]
speaking Yeah but that's not my job well
you get
paid sounds like a job to
me I did logistics for a company for for
a couple years it's how I got good at
memorizing time zones on
locations I did Lo logistics for a
company it did not involve anytime
zones all I know is that I'm living in
UTC plus two at the moment because it's
still
summer
apparently it's the old
the the old North way of splitting up
the here you had you had six summer
months and six winter months there was
only summer and
winter although in time is Summer and
standard
so there we
go I don't know it do
that again so yeah so if it's synced up
like this it makes those lines stretched
out and I just think it looks
bad it just looks
bad
in my honest
opinion it looks
horrific there you
go wait doesn't matter which am do
anything
otherwise I did
that
do what let me let me get everything in
order
here
what oh no something's
wrong and I don't like
it I don't
know have done something wrong that my t
[Music]
I think I need
to
no don't have any sne thank
you that's that's why
defin there we
go
so now that I got
that
I
we have two seasons in Texas three month
of hot 9 months of
hot
good well in my honest opinion you're
cute I know have to make it look good
well thank
you no pem the pon pon is going to have
back problems though yeah I know I said
I was going to gra that tonight never
did
I just had to
edit I need to edit can someone remind
me to
edit p p doesn't want to have back
problems I'm not I don't feel like I'm
usually
shrimping Shing shrinking shrinking
Shing
it's a table
cloth
um like right now I feel like I'm
fine I don't know if I'm sitting fine
because I there we go and then I want to
add the seam here I think wait I'm not
even showing you what I'm looking at
there we
go there we
go not picking on the
dress even though Pi
anyway I think this looks good even
better with the
sleeves then I just need to add the
poofy stuff
underneath but yeah I want to add the
seams here so it looks
fine let
me when at Le she doesn't have
unnecessarily large breasts so had to
pack problems there you
go
and some people have asked me if I I
guess this is oh no this is
the this is the pon pon stream we don't
have any this is not too
private and people I
think actually that that's the
same
like I am as part of getting the hormone
replacement yeah it is going to start
building breasts
and
uh I guess that would be
nice but I usually
so when I said basically I
want I I guess it was more one more part
of the
uh
and before I even said that I was
trans I'm a trans did everyone know
that surprised any
one and
um I said that I basically don't have
any breasts and would
like
Ling the people's
usually reaction to that is thinking
have a really huge press when I said
that I basically don't have any
press it doesn't even measure on the cup
scale and uh I just want it little
larger people always take things to
find
really nice wait what is why am I
finding out just now I'm sorry Oran I
should have tell told you
earlier I'm sorry you had toig found out
this
way it just I I didn't know how to say
to you so I decided to tell you to
stream I found that easier way I didn't
even me meant to say it I didn't I
forgot that you were in here I've said
too much
fun fun do clothing so fun I wish I can
make clothing in real life this
quickly I guess I'm making it really
quickly and been I'm like it's been 3
and 1 half hours it's better than 8
hours like like previous outfits so it's
definitely been quicker so
far I guess it's turning
unexist
um I'm not even sh what I'm doing again
I'm doing that all time today I'm
so
weird I'm doing this the wrong way
around I know this
um and this is supposed to be black and
this is supposed to be white cuz it's
supposed to represent the
scenes and then I need to hide
it I feel like I don't even know you
anymore oh
no and I was going to be surprised that
Evelyn isn't in my legal name
[Music]
yet
there we go I remember the website
almost smart Das page. net SL smart
normal SL I tried normal map first but
it was an existing thing and different
thing on the
website plus the website I'm using to
convert this thing which I have on
screen at
moment
to and the SCI
things I
[Music]
need so bir
the oh wait what's the all part my name
being
EVN I don't know fun fun yet we know
funun I get to now I what thatat too
what should I
know I mean uh I don't know what else
would you like to
[Music]
know well I did reveal that I basically
don't have any breasts because I haven't
gotten to my hormone therapy
yet hormone
replacement
completely flat
[Music]
chest and yeah and and not wanting to
post for swimsuit photos is um also for
for a certain region maybe a region
reason well that region
too related to being a
[Music]
transwoman the thing that I misread
before I
guess
well I need to know are you even a
Fluffy White Bunny no in real life it
makes me a boring human it is a shame I
know I wish I was a fluffy white
bunc I have youing
so
I do like being
kid and I I felt like I haven't been
able to express my cuteness
[Music]
before I just felt wrong but since I
accepted myself as who
I truly
am is having a panic attack at the
moment
keep so now I
can
do yeah don't don't
I delete that to make them
smaller let's see
subtract
add and there we
go now I can lay this on top of other
things I still get to the side effect so
if I still save this as nor map and this
time I should remember just show
do
blending and now if I load the noral
map there we
go I mean it's not as amazing as I hoped
but it's something at least better than
Noy kid gets to have lots of
petting okay I I'll I'll change to the
ping
one as requested
definitely not panic right now this is a
lot to take
in time to lay down in bed and
contemplate
life what
this what what what's going
on
[Music]
I do feel
[Music]
like that's a bit
[Music]
better but of course that do
change
[Music]
but I probably have to redo this anime
because it didn't exactly turn out how I
wanted
it
[Music]
so back to this
again then I need to export the
new
make get that
sport is sp a 3D design it well
apparently I am I'm doing 3D and I'm
doing 2D
Tes it's going to take half a ball of
vodka one of these oh no not not
vodka

half a ball but that have to suffice you
you you going only going be able to
takeing off
instead
there we
go
is
what so
[Music]
what wait wait hand already a glass of
half full warm up wa what
what what what is this cryptic script
you're
writing what how is the modding going
hello
J we just gone through
very very important SC like
how how I'm a trans woman
no yeah I'm actually doing quite well on
the morning currently I'm doing
the the normal map I'm doing a height
map which I will turn into normal map
cuz I want some details added that will
help me
get
the visuals I want cross
properly yeah I will try to move it one
extra
pixel
I
oh I remember to say stress silly bunny
but I'm sitting up properly I know
I I'll say I'll sa I'll save now now now
you sure I saved I guess it's say good
good
idea
it so I
should conver
T and to blur out like that that might
help okay let's save this so I can
convert it to a normal map and
then it's smart
normal now it's
[Music]
norap but the URL is smart
normal I'll show uh soon as I get fixed
this and I can show the
oute I gue I can show it now
to
obviously and I'm going to add some UND
skirt Blackness to hit this
one so yes it has saved the
image that means I can now
convert to a normal map with
thissite which I use a lot it's really
[Music]
useful remember this yeah no but
only
what
same ass whose ass should I
[Music]
sa one has a butt I mean
um yeah we get really silly around
here so okay so this is one
not that
one I no I'm shrimping again it up
straight good good compon good post
posture and for this one
no
red
green
and inverted blue I hard to see though
do an inverted
blue yeah there very very faint here
this should be visible but it's still an
important and delete everything else
just to reduce this size the first and
last should be subtract the m one should
be add the two first one should be
[Music]
build now I'm save
this Al
[Music]
though don't really need these
[Music]
parts
[Music]
[Music]
right that's
not there you
go now it's
saage
noral
map what more jokes about you saying
something no I no no I didn't say
against
it I'm not against stretching and
saving I just did some saving and
stretching how dare you accuse me of
such
I feel very
[Music]
offensive I think everything should be
animated except the
skirt oh no pen is showing public cuz
everything is tight to that needs this
one to be
animated Boop
so
how do I
[Music]
do goody J is to wa
[Music]
yeah yeah it's
fine I don't catch on that
you why when do you post the emot I'm
using as the
as the
P you fine that is oh I'm fine
well in some ways I would argue that I'm
not fan F fun fine CU it's
fun I'm going through that the moment so
but let's not go into
that now next
thing is this UND
sket which has this wavy pattern to
it and I want to see if I can get that
to
work I will DLI get
this we call it one unders scared I
guess oh no panties are showing again
don't
[Music]
TP now
day
get your mind is fantastic so most
important asure
F that's very nice if you
to who clipping through the dress a bit
there
nothing to
see okay
I'm trying to figure out how I
should get this to
work
well an UND skat would be like
this so it's
like it doesn't look too
bad
and
just like
smaller and and how do I do
it
or make it
like the size of this SC first or
something and then
I then this go down a bit how do I do
the I have an
idea I duplicate this
[Music]
and there should be uh some
divide actually oh oh
my
oh
crazy linear then parts one
surface
exactly but yeah you should
subdivide and then you smoothness on
that I
think
[Music]
what almost some
[Music]
these
okay so if I take a
b
yeah that works out
good I should probably
adds which really should
do is a
fine
all right there we
go this would be one no that's
a this will be
group group one
again then if I do that and this SN
what Isn there we
go this will be group

came back
[Music]
that's time sketch
rabit
okay I didn't like turn
out amazing me
but
it works it
works let's save
this I can probably enhance the because
I should
probably let let me do
that it's not as Terri as I think it is
actually you took so long a bunch of
cills you made this stream and I kind of
fill the background and sket being a You
Know sketch and I let all the cill show
soon this was a kind of a neat
[Music]
effect
here we go here's the thing wait why is
it
so crushed up at the
side CR oh I'm not even
showing I'm not even showing again now
can see scrunched up average distance
scrunched up that should
why oh yeah now I see i r do this how
long does it take I was going so I
didn't see how long
it
me I didn't really pay attention to how
it look
like
[Music]
[Music]
me
[Music]
there and that might explain the winess
as
so that's even
out so be nice and
good I car around the entire time you
here bees the bees are coming
and yeah what's visible on Windows looks
more like
Wasp that's what's Bas on stream cuz of
course I'm using Windows
computer and the twitch chat is using
the windows emote
while on stream on the stream picture
that should be the Emoji I think it is
which is the same as used on this
Discord and of course Twitter which is
named
after which does make me curious if two
emojis should be name to
xoji doctor
beans yeah s it doesn't do um combine
emot like
that I'm not really sure how I would
make it do that without having a massive
stuff combin
emotes oh my a all of a
sudden there also a one piece
swimsuit they said not they said not an
emote for
panties I think they want add like
briefs or something but not panties I
mean it could have like briefs plus the
female symbol for panties think that
could work
[Music]
oh that's too much
[Music]
more yeah I do want any any space as I
said
these are just what on my phone I
mean it
like yeah and and when you write words
those are just the letters on your
phone that's yeah it's um part of the
Unicorn
standard
[Music]
[Music]
I wonder if there's like a cleaning
object like
a feather dust there or something then
you could say like the dress and feather
duster to create a ma dress that could
be an interesting
combination I mean it oops I could make
custom custom pictures on my stream if
people put emos in a certain
[Music]
order
okay let's do
[Music]
that let's regenerate this
[Music]
one
[Music]
waking at that
top on buy emotes on your phone those
are just
emojis the emojis that are we J request
hiate 50 minutes
ago and that was 55 minutes
ago I did hydrate now in case I didn't
do it
[Music]
before new more
emot now that I got help
getting more
slots which I do
[Music]
appreciate you can say what what should
what more should I do I got got a long
list of emotes to
[Music]
do
but the long
[Music]
list Pon
emotes good
luck we've done quite a few of
these dipping
from dipping
juice
[Music]
this list doesn't contain like
any guess a confused one like
[Music]
have
that's a good one okay how's it
good I should have
done it appears to be done good same
this
one and then export the new corn
T then want the looks
better then the current one let's switch
here like this one next time let's
compare it to the new
one so much
M don't
[Music]
new
[Music]
[Music]
but it
ended
[Music]
[Music]
thank you so much for
[Music]
call anyway let's put this
here very
nice should have a humor for
[Music]
that it would make this
[Music]
one no WR one this
one
[Music]
like that and then I said going to make
the staining of
it like this is fine so
fine so I would save the this
one and I one
there no I probably have to do that
Manu
because on
the shouldn't be too hard
though pretty
simple
[Music]
because
every Like This

Go 100
okay
that's basically where party
celebration yes I'm like
this but going
from
white to black I can make like after
afterwards like to
[Music]

[Music]
that it doesn't really matter where face
is
[Music]

will be good we'll
see might give me the desire
result or it might
not
when don't

didn't think I'm
see me getting
[Music]
confused
one
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]

Armature
arat
ar

AR there we go look it's
animated I think that's that is there
anything else I need to do with this
just looking up scared to see daning
iies her leg going to fit under
there are are you saying that I'm going
to look under her skirt just to make
sure the legs are properly
placed I think you are trying to B it
yes her legs bit down there as far
second
can yay have I missed that I I know
there's like
the on this dress there's like the leaf
oh wait I did actually get through the
color I did miss something so I'm not
completed on yet but oh moves what
should I do the Le print or should I
skip that because that's don't know if
that's you know yeah did not make a hole
for train but I'm not sure if I should
do
that look at a p Pon
skirt I know I did that to make sure
everything look fine on
me make make sure that you could see her
panties without ising and they are
panties even if even even if there are
legs on her
[Music]
panties let's not judge what panties
she's
[Music]
wearing keep thank
[Music]
you that's
the
part
of
modding looking at
[Music]
dirs so it's basically just a round
shape and then it goes like a butt it is
a butt here right it it's not just
me let see
[Music]
that
[Music]
so it's basically this shape
[Music]
here
oops and sorry about
that much about
[Music]
it
so it will be lifted up
slightly and
then modify this for
[Music]
me oh yeah oh yeah I didn't even do this
[Music]
thing
someone remind me to do that
[Music]
thing okay
so
Rip r good R the correct way this
time
yeah can I just
[Music]
that Rocket
Man rocket
man really making sure there's an R
sound
start
roet
man I'm
silly that's that's what you're here for
[Music]
right
Bic get
that yes one
did I confirm
the like both
sides yeah there we
[Music]
go
there find
one touches down the
[Music]
one
[Music]
this one I can't split
into don't
sure it looks fine
[Music]
[Music]
for
[Music]
going is
[Music]
pointy
so this one of course
needs she place in
here
and then a very quick
[Music]
edit wi need this Gap
[Music]
there a
[Music]
team what I
mean
same
that and then and now it's
my
ta okay
now this part
here
could be
shrinking like
that
there you
go
that or I
just and has an
inside and it's in on
inside
wish just don't
okay which might be okay done oh you're
eating
pizza that's what you're
saying now I get what you're talking
about yeah now now she got that
part so that's the ice
Mouse the
body the the pair with Bells Bells part
the
hair so yeah the final thing is this
thing okay because there are separate
materials
apparently look see better every time
you have more
detail
oh so I will separate these a back up a
that and
then I don't
know you see the
idea I could have
it but having stand up that is a bit
Weird Al because you can't see from
anyway no I don't
[Music]
know yeah I was thinking about it just
standing up get there Shadow I REM that
in that
case I could probably change
this yeah yeah let me try that I made a
backup of it after
all so I will delete
this
let's let's remove those
S1 completely changing the
shift let go try something crazy
[Music]
here and
then
[Music]
looks a bit silly though but
[Music]
um
right in there I tried
something didn't go
as
what thinking I think I
have
I might try
putting I around one of her ears do you
my
try
[Music]
oh my are you going to mod for
[Music]
me please please come and do mod for
me
why you you think it's silly I mean
obviously I that shadow
but you say you say it would be I mean I
could I could probably have it like hang
a bit more
forward
uh I think this can
work just give me a moment
here to make it
work give me a chance
[Music]
to give up F the idea
[Music]
too
[Music]
something
[Music]
something
[Music]
for
for
something something like
say
[Music]
oh
a f new
follower
hi welcome
har we're doing some modeling
here I think I recognize
you I think we've seen each other
before
I okay I need to I need to see I'm doing
this
wrong sorry been me funny for a while
it's perfectly
fine H H
okay nice that nice following already
yeah I had people like that before too
like oh apparently I was
foll why prop
again I guess the best way
to you
when when I when a basically when a raid
is happening and when I shot
that then it says there if you're
falling or not
guess most people ignore that
PO to be
fair I actually got a few followers
through shout
outs but it's not many I to be fair I
don't have many sub
followers what I do appreciate you
following does mean a lot to me
[Music]
I hope this three only is going well
well I
guess you can be the charge of that
let's let's enable all
the here we
go oh
[Music]
there second so so yeah I'm going to see
if I can make the hair T of hair stand
up
you can see
p oh yeah this looks
insane I wanted to describe it as
insane well
it's
because it would it would have been
funny if I could modif mod the crash
insane trilogy but sadly this is for
it's about
time
thank you so
much otherwise that would have been a
great F because I'm all about puns if
you haven't if you don't already know
that it looks so
good I will I can't take full credit uh
I did make the dress but the model is
modified version of Coco
[Music]
but um so a lot the like the face is
basically just
Coco so I can't TR care with
it and basically the the general
proportions are still Coco but that's
also to fit the skeleton since it's
confused in the
[Music]
game aming artist thank
you it's it's just not so too much for
me
too
um
anyway
but the uh
some I need this one some of the cloes
like like the dress I it is based on a
dress that Isabel from H Crossing has in
the
spin-off games H but
uh I'm modeled it by myself though puns
are great yeah good good thing your pro
puns this is no place for people who
can't accept puns this
is this is a p the bun Bun's
place I
[Music]
guess
which is also gu is part A pun
too puns
everywhere I don't exactly know how how
I would close this
up now let see these go
together
it would look better this part is inside
the head
anyway bunch of
work and doing the textures take a lot
of effort notot of
time guess I do every other like
that like
[Music]
that
doesn't mean I need to split these
up and merge these together oh another
[Music]
one there you go that's the
one
and
try to even out this a
bit here we
[Music]
go maybe I shouldn't have
this
let's see if we
can now that
I think about it I don't think I want to
see
here don't try to something like
that
h
it's messing around and see what it
[Music]
works that's how I
Mo oh missed one
there
so so this thing I want
to that a different
texture seems a good
idea Al big respect for a schedule that
covers
most as a fellow eers is annoying so
many cor BTU never give you time for
schedules yeah e Europe is often
neglected it's
it's it's kind of kind of a thing
I've noticed uh if if it's
like if if it's a streamer for stream it
doesn't even need a streamer anything
content creator from North America
usually give North American
timeon content creator for Europe and
Australia usually gives their own time
zone Plus North American time zones
[Music]
so I've seen a few European YouTubers
YouTubers streamers only Ging time
sounds
but so so at least if you're from North
America you're very likely getting your
time soon but if you're from Europe
you're usually out to BL unless it's a
European streamer or something and it's
[Music]
it oh
yeah
try to cover I I this I I do have like
people watching from Japan South Africa
and I have consider expanding but I need
to find a better method of covering more
time soon in a
way
uh at least if the
uh right this one
[Music]
okay uh when this summertime is removed
and such that's going to
[Music]
be
[Music]
um is there
any repart I guess there
[Music]
are this H
[Music]
um
[Music]
go cuz that was also thing I was
thinking about H I should I should
switch
picture I've been using this long time
go that's that's a good one but it's
very tough you get 10 because
h i seeing thinking
about mostly streamers don't uh some
people do tell where they're
from and some don't and you can kind of
figure
out where a person is if they at Le give
out their time zone and it's as I
mentioned
before if there's North American time
zone you have to look for the time zone
that stands
[Music]
out
for companies it's often
us like us in lower case
it's kind of ping sometimes but us or
Japan times
Japan I don't know and if they I'm
making my brain is
like it's like surely they would think
other countries with English as main
language should be on schedule
yeah I think so texture mapping always
looks so
scared yeah especially
faces te um yeah when I come to
like H
Nintendo and they give
like so they have
uh two there's that multiple
[Music]
English
which makes
it kind of weird I think they have um
yeah North
America then is unit there is kind
of I think they call
it there's UK and then Europe Europe
which is also
English CU it's there's no
other language it could do
and
Australia I think those are the active
ones
and and each of those give so when it's
like a Nintendo Direct each of them give
their own time
zones but Europe does
not broadcast the the direct and
Australia is broadcasting the UK direct
which
is
becomes
weird when they mention the summer and
or any season when I say summer and
[Music]
winter but
yeah but as soon as uh Nintendo Direct
is released
H where when I see it it's always the
North American time which of course I
get it
but then I have to go online and convert
it not that everybody watching like last
one I didn't much cuz I got I got
informed about it
after after this was
over yeah thank for wait waitting you
have to a trans time that's is wait no I
think so yes that is true
um that is true
they do comvert which is really good
that they do
[Music]
that so as long as they provide the
YouTube link to it it will give you the
time I do appreciate
that and when I started on Twitch they
they also said that uh one of
the things when I said on
Schedule H like now twitch converts the
times to your schedule no to your time
zone and my thought was is that this new
fish this should have been here from the
start it's probably not a new feature
because there are features they tell me
like news from 2000 like 21 2021 that's
a old stuff I actually not sure when
they implemented
that
well it's a good thing that they do
that but yeah
um but uh setting a time for o is this
one setting a time more schedule which I
Tred to do but I've been behind on that
when I when I when I set the schedule on
uh twitch yeah
[Music]
main is is is schedules if I want to
know before the waiting room is up it's
up up is it's active when it's stream is
but I stop converting just wait for what
waitting yeah I
guess yeah that's it is easiest to be
fair I think it's r as the schedule on
Twitch it is not the convenience thing
most convenient thing to set up on
Twitch I Tred to like I want okay when I
got H affiliate I could schedule
individual dates which was
convenient and
uh and I did that to try to be accurate
which what the games I did but it was
too much effort it's not a convenient
way of doing
it um
so I give up on
it so I did the the usual schedule every
Monday and then I set the game for that
but I'm haven't change that so it's
probably the wrong game at the
moment and I should change that it also
this should be fixed it also doesn't
help then
twitch is merging games that have the
same names I can't even select the
correct
game and when I said this
so twitch has uh two English
options although I do use Twitch in
Swedish for other reasons and so they
have the US options with the US formats
and then you have the UK option for the
UK formats so you can choose if you want
12 or 24hour time and I since I use
24hour time
daily
and oh I didn't want to include that
part
one have to
copy this
Parton
and so I can choose which is good
and I would
choose uh UK for the 24-hour time but
when you set the schedule for some
reason they are forcing the times you
select on a schedule to be 12h hour
time and this is regardless of which
language you use so as I said I use
Twitch in Swedish and Swedish and it's
spoken but written Swedish is almost
exclusive with 24 hours you will
basically never find 12 hours in
any not not like in publication
schedules or like I guess schedule
timetables
when the clocks are written
anyway everywhere it's 24 hours digital
clocks but not when you set the schedule
on
Twitch and I think in 24 hours as well
so it's just
[Music]
confusing tomorrow my stream starts at
14:00 my time
and I want to set the schedule to 14 but
I can't but 14 is not an option it ends
at
12 I'm sure well 14 is two but then I
have is is and then I have to remember
if it's a.m. or
p.m. um and then I have to remember with
the whole if if something is going to be
at least everything is numerical order
like correct time order on the when you
select the time that's not too
confusing but still the kids just have
offered 24 hours which they use do on
YouTube so there we
go and now it should
have perfect
nice nice
nice
yes and it's
here twitch has a few issues with
localization they do get most of the
stuff cor and I'm happy for
[Music]
that should be done you do but it would
be more annoying if I don't even have
the option like
twitch twitch have decided that everyone
should use that 12 hours time doesn't
matter which language you
[Music]
use yeah I guess this is
fine it's kind of like how I
can I want it I
hope I hope this is how I
want I in my schedule in both 12 and 24
hours depending on
what format is mostly like Europe is 24
hours
and North America and Australia is 12
hours
like
yeah I the those formats I prefer like
used in those regions that's
why but I but I've still seen European
YouTube YouTubers YouTubers European
streamers
who only have European Time Zone like
like central European and still right in
12
hours I don't think there is anyone in
Central Europe using 12 hour time
like
officially so I'm not
sure because if if they're using
European time zone for is is isn't that
for
European Watchers who use 24 hours in
the daily life I don't I don't
know he a bit weird to me I don't
understand there might be a fair reason
somewhere but I don't understand anyway
let me remove that
channel
[Music]
[Music]
ta I get the feeling
that it is topic I'm
in I get the feeling that if people feel
the need to use 12 hours if they use
English because I have to I've been
like
um met other
Europeans in real
life
who have communicated like we don't have
we speak two different languages but we
communicate through English because we
both speak English and when they decided
to write down the
time um so I'm from
Sweden
and they were from somewhere
else and when they decided to write down
the time in uh which was agreed upon
they decided wrting in the 12h hour
system for some
reason you know we just not everyone
does though but just I just find it
Sil and anyway uh I think I
want it's still a
bit tilted
forward oh right I should follow
this it's
like even though
I maybe I
should make a duplicate of it in case I
change my mind
[Music]
[Music]
yeah that isn't
quick
[Music]
that you
know
there we
go I like to talk about random stuff
head Pet Head p in the P
Pon are you touching the
[Music]
princess I guess I guess petting the
princess with would be
[Music]
fine I think this so funny
yes
so with this
thing right inside the head now there it
is I should add this
band how do I do that
best
this thing is very uneven
here at Circle I guess is a good
start does need to be that where does it
why is it almost 1
[Music]
m
[Music]
okay it's uh it's a
start
[Music]
no
[Music]
something like that I
think I sh like
that I'm never satisfied that's
me seems to be a favorite to use yeah I
mean it's it's least like overly
expressive it's like the opposite of
expressive I is this one like the other
ones are very high
expressive and it don't might always fit
the
mood change
smooth make sure St wait what is
the okay this
thing should probably just follow the
hand now
not
and seem to anything
El oh maybe maybe should I don't
know this one should also follow
it there you go so I should use the
light
fine
like
that
[Music]
good cuz it does
have and
[Music]
inside
let's
see there we go
okay it could be
a
[Music]
so it's going to be a bow and everything
so
there we go nice
nice Mark seam inside here I don't need
change the emot
again because he commented don't I had
to
change I felt that I felt the edge to
change of course
[Music]
that was
rote
individual
[Music]
individual
but I'm at two 234 followers the moment
thank
you it's amazing to see so many so much
support silly
bunny o lots of
followers two
34 but only nine watches what's the uh
turn out of that nine out of
2344 right yes that's almost
4% followers are
watching
W I know this is the most
exciting but I'm surprised I watch your
stuff
not the most exciting kind of stream
let's see
so
um that band should be
red
[Music]
and
and I need a good shade for
[Music]
that so let me see here
[Music]
and
wait what am I
[Music]
doing all right
so I've been Ling sorry I not been
chatting as much that's
fine Rocket Man you can chat as much or
as little as you want or nothing at
all that's perfectly
fine I don't mind had to think what the
difference is between followers and
Watchers since imp twitch
uses
basically watch than Swedish days s for
following in uh okay the difference
between a follower is someone
who has my who has a streamer on their
list of dreams they follow
get get it on the list of live channels
being live at the moment and and so on
get notification if you want and I
Watcher is someone who's currently on
the
stream at the
moment but yeah follow is someone who
hits the follow button watch is someone
PR
exactly and um a follower does not need
need to watch and a watcher does not
need to
follow they are not mutually
exclusive
I
oh ad will shop
soon there you go now it's red should be
now next
part is this bow I should have plenty of
bows
already cuz I made so many outfits bows
on
already I got Bianca outfit with no
bows I got the Coco outfit with no
bows doesn't start of well I got the
school outfit with bows I got this one
but this is more kind of a
flat bow I got this bow but that's
doesn't seem to be the kind of
bow I got a bunny seit with a
bow but is
that it's a closer
match
though maybe I
can make it
okay want see
duplicate and
then let's bring it to the pel
outfit now it's
here but it should
be up
here right
what
yeah and then and then it should be
[Music]
like
C
costume far as I'm aware would be like a
formal
outfit but sometimes sometimes people
use it
for
another word would be
direct but that to me is more of
a
uh uh an outfit for a certain
occasion it be uh acting
or M masar
mascarat
there we
go yeah thing is in my my suit it's the
only word I know to
use well
[Music]
what word would be appropriate to
use given the
context there we go that's
ads
that means it's almost a full hour again
that's when I
[Music]
something so here they
are I can just place them anywhere I
want
[Music]
oh you're
Bor
yep I think it can
[Music]
work I think I think it's good
enough I could app play
t well this the
yeah there we go now
it's more like how I want
[Music]
it
[Music]
maybe maybe this miss out B too much
let's try
again yeah maybe this this is
better
actually let's smooth out this that out
and this
one I
of it will certainly
work I hope
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
almost looking
dress but I didn't see anything this
[Music]
time
so
switch from future
to
[Music]
B I think this
might
cu
[Music]
this
[Music]
s maybe not that
[Music]
B I hope it will
work
[Music]
let's Place some
here let's try
to use this space a make more
efficient
I think
this that should be fr
look at p p washing your tior in her
head she
looks she sure loves it holding up a
whole
heart where did she get the heart
[Music]
from
[Music]
okay back
here let's add the
bow
now
it should have the
same so I should create a new fer
for
and
bow and let's add it in
here it's basic like
[Music]
this
and then
fin night
one
we'll see if this
works hopefully it
does yeah I don't need
to
I like
symmetry I love
symmetry okay let's see how does this
work that's the that's one that
works
oh found the love
heart this one I'm using this I do like
it this
cute the artist made a good job on
that I'm the
artist
this game down is
a well I'm happy you like
the you like the
emotes
that means my time making them was not
quite
wasted why is
this thinking fun fun sing funun that
that's probably the one that where fits
almost
perfectly I don't get the glasses one
like how how how did they even think it
would work on most of this
stuff I don't think they
thought I'm
iing um anyway let
me this that yeah if I if I app it
here it be a bit rotated
[Music]
but no I didn't
[Music]
want
there
[Music]
go let me explor this
[Music]
again every car crazy for man can't
seeing see
sunglasses well you might
be you might be correct about
[Music]
that so let me go back
in work on this one
now so how
large
should I do
this let do 690 that's a weird number
but let's go
it
s go for blue
PR
one you might be right about that
too
[Music]
[Music]
let's see need
that
no
perfect I
miss but this may give me what I
need and update where oh it's a
bow
look doesn't look so good here but
hopefully I want to look
there oh no what you're trying you're
trying to put pon pon
snout P Pon do clearly
to so it's off to the side okay I need
to time to look
at okay this one I can left back
here this one is
the where is this one oh it's
here I can Moine in here
too
oh
yeah this
one I
can so how does
this is
up this note lick the chat oh wait
what
L the chat
members is shorted
by 35° I can do that let's get it
accurate I don't need it to be that
accurate
[Music]
but it's
fun
know
what song this
is is there short
some
what did they oh oh oh yeah yeah yeah
yeah
um revers everything yeah yeah yeah
here's here's the funny thing about the
on screen chat and it's a bug that I
have accidentally caused uh when you you
when it comes to em specifically
emotes yeah what it does is it's it's
kind of
complicated every emote you sent let
let's let's say that every emote you
sent gets
uh gets a
number so the first emote you send gets
number one and the second one is number
two and so on in the same message at is
and then to
determine and and then and that's also
issue by the way and then to determine
what Emos it should put in these slots
it goes backwards from the message and
and so I don't exactly know why and
um
so so if you take the like three
surprise pH and then an angry phas and
post that you're going to say it's going
to be three angry faces and a surprise
face because oh oh because the emote one
which is the three of is going to be
replaced with the last emote in the list
which is the face I don't know exactly
why it's doing this but that's what it's
doing and and in your message H the cold
face and upside down face they were not
recognized as
emotes for some reason I think it's
because they are new emotes and I rely
on Twitch telling me which are emotes
are not and twitch has not updated the
list of
emotes that's probably
[Music]
why so some of it is on Twitch and some
of it's probably on me but it could also
be on
[Music]
Twitch it's a really
interesting
[Music]
bu there again
yeah beautiful so the only thing left I
think are the
bells
this but since I've been hydrating so
much I actually
need use the bathroom
again
so fny eating as caterpillar which looks
more like a Snak worm I mean sketch
rabbit yeah let's go back to sketch
rabbit I'll be back in a very short
moment I need to use the
bathroom
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
you
[Music]
[Music]
around
let
[Music]
turn whoa I
back sketch rabbits will run
away where princess is
[Music]
here sh proba put

a
sure ah bottomless P I promise
I P P Oh you mean yeah before I skirt
yeah don't worry there was nothing to
look at that's the sketch rabbit
whoa wait what wasn't that sketch rabbit
or did they did they use the bootleg
sketch rabbit did they use this one I
don't remember if I use the sketch
rabbit to like sketch rabbit I saw a
sketch
rabbit I do get this one is Tiny in
size I have
there one more I have this one W that's
the one you use oh no I used to BL like
sketch
rabit how that
I not catch
rabit are you disappointed
now why would you do about
it
not anymore
now
well I the boat seems to be a bit a bit
on the smaller
side it is cuter when it's
larer and I could enlarge this one as
well there a bit just a
dab
I don't think that's how you say let's
see I course now
I
uh U
SP a bit a bit too details for such
small
things I think this is a
bit too detail and
still this seems to be more
reasonable
[Music]
and
then what I need to
[Music]
do
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
um give a moment trying to sink
[Music]
here
cuz it's this I'm trying to
make when they have
this
[Music]
track
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
I need organiz stuff here you
like okay this thing I need
keep okay what is
this this is the that one I need
that one this is all toughed I don't
need the that one that one I fixed
and this is the high
quality
thing okay just one detail these things
aren't
[Music]
perfectly on each
side like mirror to to each other what
what are these called round
Bells round
[Music]
Bell
the real life B doesn't isn't perfect
like that is
true that is
true but some details it does have which
I always that want meing there this I
can
add way
[Music]
uh
that's some
DET C getting to know you inside and out
this stream is I
mean uh is there anything you want to
know about me I'm open for answering
question oh
my like am a am a
rabbit I'm from Sweden I speak
Swedish I know that's just that's that's
a
surprise I should I should have said
something
earli another another secret hidden from
Arian
I think is like
that the the the amount of details I put
into this this scene that b
see the T do you English no I don't know
a single
word of well to be fair I didn't know
was Swedish it's in the tag though but
yes but now you
know but could he at least tell that I
wasn't native English
speaking I didn't know how obvious
my I broken my English
is
I'm not probably not the best at judging
that there you go that's this should
create
necessary I think let's duplicate this
in case I do something wrong with
it intersect
ban
okay
oh yeah this one it should
be is
[Music]
it not not sure why isn't
[Music]
working
[Music]
okay
[Music]
and
strangling a
bit there we go that's what I wanted
yeah i s in your about only know stuff
about said
list company
streams yeah I've said a lot of random
stuff lot
[Music]
of
trying to sink with my little bunny
[Music]
brain
that here's a song
with
[Music]
[Music]
and
then let's
face
face
mer like
that don't
that there you go that was an
interesting
[Music]
sh don't need
this save this work now intersect
vol
oh there we go that's what they want on
the that mean that I can
now
[Music]
that
although
sh that
[Music]
was it's going to show
up small
pieces
oh or
[Music]
something
[Music]
[Music]
h
wait
what oh this
way
too many of
these
many
and then
just and let's
see
[Music]
[Music]
well there we
go this little little object here where
is
the
[Music]
[Music]
5,565 triangles on this
object is this object
contains like what two of these two
together is about as many as the whole
body well without ears
but yeah I'm not going to use this High
po
version I'm going to use the do po
version is
B and po
[Music]
guns I need
[Music]
to
[Music]
right that's
[Music]
[Music]
so
okay let's see if I can make
[Music]
sense Okay
so
one of these are
correct just need
to
[Music]
R take
[Music]
them silly of
[Music]
me oh
footballs
well
they are
wedes which would
be
what
construct a
[Music]
B I think this is the last texture I
want do on the
how do I make
it I'll use this Edge to make St
want wa this thing is straight in the
first
place there we
go
now it
is think I should use this one instead
actually then okay I know what to
do
there you go that's very very strength
though
so more foot
BS I mean it's the same amount it's just
four of
them I running out
space I'm running out of
space
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
more feet or or or football yeah more
footballs more more feet Fe
it okay and
then more more
PES
I do
that
and that should give more space let me
see
how D meing
you
yeah like
that I more
space
hydrate I am not
[Music]
hydrated
that's not the one I'm
[Music]
using
allit
I I do
want do want even Ming to be as large as
I
[Music]
can I
did S 4 OT yeah I ass wasn't done
anything to do with
emote that I
used but it was fun to
[Music]
[Music]
see ex to have not joking
onless um
[Music]
and
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
this
let's
see oh
[Music]
yeah
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so we
should moving
those together should give me more
space
let's see I update
the
piure
[Music]
yeah that means I
[Music]
can
more space
efficient
so than
you back to this one I look more
[Music]
space now I can have
deta I putting too much effort in the
detail this nothing to
show but that's
me
I
[Music]
guess let's just see
more
space
let push these
together there we
go now I got it like how I want
it what I will do
now do this thing again oh I said the
wrong
moment oh
that's
on this one should not other other weird
stuff can
happen now let's
see one
what this
maybe these of course are kind of
weird no way let's see how this
works have you been doing 3D malls for
long it's
um I've been done doing three mod from
time
time
oh it's 10 minutes
to 10 minutes
to going for some
El
what I've been doing models
for yeah amateur modeling most of the
time never never
P messed around with
Mon and then I basically spend most time
spend a lot of
time uh moding where it's really
modeling moding spiral and now moding
crash a lot of 3D modeling work work
inste I guess it get the weird effects
here
to all the
OB can
oh no so bad
looking of
course let
me save
[Music]
this are using plan
yes
is is
[Music]
blender
[Music]
so
here so the
[Music]
uh bow as I call it
should have silver
balance silver
[Music]
BS like
that I'll same
that
but it's actually going to have some
metal this
time but this is going to 100%
metal so we going to have a metal map
[Music]
W and now it's going to
have the B texture
here
let
place place put a place
[Music]
only and
then these are the ones I
[Music]
want be nor
map
[Music]
and
finally the roughness
map where
the bells are going to
be
maximum smoothness because that's zero
[Music]
roughness
go moving black black to back back to
blend black to
[Music]
bend so if I
now the
texes this make
silver
metallic apply the noral my pink
oh and roughness
[Music]
oh but this part here should probably
not there probably should be
rough so let's go back in here and fix
that so it's basically this part
here
[Music]
[Music]
okay
ding
[Music]
yes just the most important
[Music]
is this this
part in
basically this should not
beened
yeah there we
[Music]
go so I'm going back
to the metal
map this part should not be metal
because that's the
[Music]
yeah it should
also not be be shiny so it should be
[Music]
rough and finally it should be
dark should be maximum Darkness or
should I
[Music]
do mostly
dark
[Music]
oh that's what I was trying
to bird for
some birds you're
fun
well now let's see if I change roughness
yeah that's that makes more
sense nor is changing the metal
yeah now it's not metal but of course it
should also be dark there we go maybe it
should be maximum
[Music]
[Music]
Darkness that's maximum Darkness who
that makes sense that's that's pretty
good I mean sure it's not perfect artif
effects like
[Music]
that what happens if
[Music]
I I should put
um the
uh
[Music]
I should take a 360 picture of my room
where I work and put that as the
reflection that would be fun with myself
when I look into this you
see although it
wouldn't what is this
[Music]
you got some
trees got some round soft
[Music]
pants shiny of course
the in the game it's going to reflect
what's
relevant it this
shiny
let's
[Music]
um yeah I only want to do
this
W so too
big
how kind of
be back
size do
[Music]
think
[Music]
so they so
also oh it doesn't say the 120 yes this
so this five
5,500 triangles turned into 120
triangles and it has quite a
de but quite de performance
[Music]
saing there we
go this
one I think this turn out
win
coffee actually
doesn't actually I'm not a fan of
coffee but it sounds nice for you at
least that's nice that to get something
to
drink well I didn't want to
make cuz it's look so tiny on her
head
[Music]
[Music]
I that's same not
[Music]
maybe doesn't give
sense it's looking
good thank
[Music]
you
[Music]
[Music]

is for
those
[Music]
have from
behind now I just need this stuff to
follow the
[Music]
hands that's

should I should
[Music]
that's re and the balance the
kit and funny said
[Music]
