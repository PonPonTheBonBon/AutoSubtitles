good game let
ride yeah I played this game like a
really really long time
ago and I have not played it since I
don't know how old I was when I played
this game but I was not
old yeah long is the sound going to play
for rabit Stampede yeah I shrunk down
the Emojis and Emos when you put a lot
so they been smaller this
time yeah I have to be up early tomorrow
to stop by
early
what I'm sorry what do you
mean a star what I mean because he's a
star and it's the same DSi Dophin
software International it's a French
developed game by the
way here we go intro practice n skip
[Music]
that who need practice qualify there is
no qualifying this qu anyway as far as I
know that you're completely made up
that's a good start of game just lies in
intro assume assume assuming there's no
qualified race there certain is race
[Music]
it's 12:00 p.m. going to bed soon I
don't know what that means but
anyway hey red hey
Benny now it's M2 not it's not long M
racer or Mr it's just
M2 and I really don't get this kind of
loading look this game also got Swedish
Spanish and Italian and German and
French and
[Music]
English I keep forgetting that should
make sure that the music is like
copyrighted music or something I mean
it's obviously copyrighted
but this one got controller
here oh does this mean
I yeah forgot to change it to race
controls
[Music]
again they got a few options where is
the okay this same controls good
[Music]
good
[Music]
but I probably have to restart the game
anyway because it's probably going to be
annoying like
that so let's me quickly start the game
because I said I had that issue last
time and when I changed the controllers
while the game was running it somehow it
didn't R
st but we can speed quick past
this we can also speed the loading
screen so one player wait oh they Chang
this now you have press down hopefully I
can unlock everything with medium
difficulty is it a hard
and we can play simulation arcade
hopefully was this there to unlock
anyway oh yeah yeah they do have things
to the ultimate Championship okay good
so this is what I have
to progress in the game then I guess
[Music]
iume so Good by the
[Music]
way
[Music]
why can't I
like no I can not s but maybe it doesn't
matter
wait is this wait what why went it
quite nice it went quite music
ended sorry I'm messing
around
so
much
um how was your
day this game is also one that
doesn't
like and
cropping ah there we
go when music
disappeared
oh it fits
perfectly
iume actually don't know which whatever
it fits nicely that's
point oh oh well there we go that's what
I
wanted yeah I
don't I go B behind it's fine he
fine let's go
anyway so put the music then he just we
played the whole Frack we don't need any
more
music so this game um I guess uh so
weird without
music this game has amazing Graphics
yeah just look at that screenshot I got
there by that's p p wood water what
hello neon atomic Galaxy Neon
neon neon right oh a lot of stuff
so this game when they made this game
they
decided that uh what was it called I had
word yet in this morning uh what do you
call
it procedurally generation they figured
out that procedurally generating
everything was a great idea so they
decided instead of actually creating a
level why we just procedurally generate
the whole game and go with that this was
the bike I used in the previous game so
why not use it again and this this time
is all
pink and no voice they skipped up the
voice so every single level in this game
as far as I know is just procedurally
generated they are pre predetermined so
every time you play the game it's the
same levels
but H they
[Music]
are
yes made with the editor in the game or
something which means you can make your
own tracks as
well I know the default speedometer is
set to to not metric how dare
[Music]
they
okay this should be the
same uh gamep playay wise as the
previous game it looks a bit
different it should still have the same
rules it definitely feels easier though
but maybe it's just me being good at the
game now even though I bounced after the
W but in previous game I would they yeah
they should have cost me at this time
when I bounc them one so
much
[Music]
and
[Music]
iMed First Strike first lap of the game
and
[Music]
record which does because when I played
this game I almost
felt W what fck game always interrupting
me I always felt that the G this game
feels more feels more bland than the
previous game yeah Sports R that's
perfect for one while she's
[Music]
riding P Pon would wear wear a a sports
BR skirt when riding him more
[Music]
second
so in the final stretch of
Curves and it
start is that a
Finish Well done thank you Game Sports
spr time for 30
minutes oh do I have to we replay now
thanks
replay the motorcycles AR just aren't as
fast as the pink one yeah the pink pink
one isn't I mean the pink one is I like
[Music]
it yeah player one that's my that's me
or you get points too however when you
get a record you can actually change
your name but you have to get a record
change your
name this game is so weird I went the WR
way but at least I can fit in pon
[Music]
pon
P seven letters seven characters Scenic
valy remembers my selection good good
and yeah if I remember correctly they
have split up the Motocross and
motorbike I don't know what the other
ones we
called into two separate um
championships it's
not I still
[Music]
wonder yeah you're just really good oh
thank you
Benny or I mean Motocross Moto GP yeah
yeah that that makes
sense is what I would wear wait you
would wear a sports BR skirt while
riding emo back I mean it's not what I
expected you to wear but wait why am I
starting last
position that's that I mean I won I have
10
points have the most points of everyone
here and also as you have seen there is
no
qualifying atast the previous game you
could argue had qualifying because you
need the top three to progress to the
next to the next uh
[Music]
race Str
Str news what what does that
[Music]
mean
[Music]
this this time H because B so quickly I
don't have time to read the
sign if they written um checkpoint with
a dash or
space is oh I touch the grass if you
touch the gr it's not the stone wall
that is the wall it's a piece of
slightly bit of grass at the edge there
that's the wall cuz that makes sense
[Music]
the same logic in the first
[Music]
moing this one is
harder now it's actually a
[Music]
challenge a bit more
concentration
[Music]
hopefully I can unlock everything by
medium I feel like medium is a good
difficulty for me in this
game I could probably win hard
but that would probably
take so
[Music]
long hopefully they don't Rec getting
winning the champion sh or
something oh I know wish all right they
actually have names in this
game
G
Derber uh what's that M or M wone boo
Theo and
kid oh no
gahi lost jungle
no I'm lost in the
jungle checkpoint checkpoint yeah they
they're very inconsistent how they write
the word
checkpoint in the
first crash
panut or more crash panut all three
crash panut on PlayStation one I
think when you open a checkpoint you
said
check and then they let disappeared and
then said
Point everyone
died now the computer is still cheating
in this game
[Music]
too but in the
uh remake they changed it so it says
says checkpoint as a single
line which I probably mentioned on
stream
before Al it detects that up here when
you draw Z checkpoints does it without
us space so what
bash
wa and I think it's for two reason one
for the higher resolution and text is
more they can have smaller text on
screen and still have it
reasonable but also because they support
multiple languages so they should be
able to write
checkpoint because not every language is
able to split the word they have check
for checkpoint into two separate parts
so they just write it as one single
word other on are langage are free to
use
B but I need
[Music]
help I assume basically it's for
localization
support it might not be
because sometimes developer just makes
decision that does not
support uh being localized and then
localizes stuck with the
terrible
[Music]
translations for example
[Music]
Discord if you know Swedish the
adjectives change if you have plural or
singular that means that the word like
if you block a user it says on the user
that they are
blocked and then you
have the if you go to your
friends you have this section for
blocked users and then there it says
blocked too and because English uses the
same term for both and Discord only has
a single term for
that
[Music]
wa
this
oh I pressed the mute button to mute
myself
to
to and then I unmute myself but then it
doesn't unmute myself
[Music]
annoying but it should B me now I hope
new record oh now I'm bouncing all over
the place so again what what's the
what's the name of this
track come on there we go checkpoints
written with fancy Tex without a dash or
a
[Music]
hyphen I'm doing terrible on this
level a
proper tiny bridge but it's not tiny
because the track is actually very
narrow because you can barely go in
sand okay now I'm rocket I'm the pink
rocket oh I don't want to use this
motorcycle it's
[Music]
pink
[Music]
this game has many more tracks because
when they are prly generated pretty easy
to make tracks in that
case also why it takes such time to load
the tracks
because because they had to generate the
tracks OB the assets are't generated
those the assets
[Music]
generes
[Music]
new
record
[Music]
the I'm nothing so
okay
pun yeah guess that's safe to do in a
real
race this Ram the motorcycle back wheel
with your front
[Music]
wheel good thir defense they got
[Music]
here
okay I'm doing worse and
[Music]
worse bouncy bunny by K you lost the
race it's it is score based
how how did I lost the
race see I got F I didn't lose the
race I won four points I'm still in the
lead Clover
Leaf this is not a CL leaf
mobile they actually have
a or
mobile and in this game apparently
so no it's
Sno how this affect the
traction
[Music]
but that's definitely does feel s more
[Music]
slippery
okay look
mine
[Music]
Yamaha
[Music]
new
[Music]
record
that's
[Music]
a good
grp W how long is this track two four
laps
[Music]
even the lap count doesn't
reflect the length of
track s the length of the Championship
will be L the same I guess it doesn't
matter
[Music]
but
[Music]
W sometimes feels very easy even even if
I'm doing terribly as I'm doing well
yeah that's physics that's that's a
physics
[Music]
work
like I'm not doing great but I'm still
in first place in this
one I guess I'm de terribly on that sand
track
so when did they travel to find a place
that's so snow what time of the year is
[Music]
this how long time is it between each
[Music]
PA
[Music]
record
wete
[Music]
yeah it's the CL Leaf I true kind
well oh you can you can pause what I
wanted to continue but I was pausing
here but it looks like you can restart
the race so if
you if you need more P points for the
championship make sure that you win you
can restart race or something I
guess they quick it's snowing again it's
night okay here you choose between
automatic and manual transmission but
then on the record screen it it it used
a for automatic but s for manual which I
find to be a
weird obviously should should have
chosen
M the bik is now would be
scary yeah the light on the ground does
not affect the position of the bike
apparently it does shift when
turn a p or excuse or something
but not like they could have at least
removed it or
something or shrinked it in size that
would make
sense faded way not fading is not really
having whoops close
someone oh what
happened as the
standard
[Music]
but the options work between automatic
and manual that's are the two terms they
have
[Music]
staged they can't just introduce a
second ter for for what manual is called
for the record
list it makes no
sense
[Music]
but I guess I just chose the quality of
this
[Music]
game in I mean they have been very
inconsistent how the right checkpoint so
I guess inconsistent with how the right
manual is just adding to
it t is is that a new type of
checkpoint
can't even see it's being dist started
because there's no lights on it just a
black
spe at least this game got like weather
and night
[Music]
time here we
go oh no I touch the snow it's not
the
Stone Fence W or wooden fence
or pushes on the side of the track makes
a trip no it's a a bit too thck snow and
then use
[Music]
crash I mean kind of makes sense
but I don't
[Music]
know what do I mean ring into a thick
layer of snow I can see I can see him
kind of falling off the bik for
[Music]
that yeah Dr 300
which and then increase the speed of
game by 50% to make it more
exciting uh in Snowy Road like
[Music]
this
[Music]
okay not
good p f is a speed demon yeah I
am hi what
bunny red dragon is here stalking
you what else is
new the loaning time on the PlayStation
one is based on the number of frames it
has
played oh no hi the commun is cheating
we have the same number of
points feel the heat but it is
like uh bad
weather wait I was going to say is the
game going to crash I probably should
say hi pon
pon hi what the
bunny what up
bunny yeah it's overcast or something
whatever you call
[Music]
it
over oh no there's a bit narrow
here everyone is just driving past me
like nothing how
sh I was lying there hurt on the ground
and no one just help decided to stop and
help
[Music]
me
[Music]
what is this not a
cartoon yeah I'm doing wor
[Music]
now you am I supposed to know who is
who wasn't like the list of players
at I
don't what the bunny thank you for 100
beats how many beats have you donated
[Music]
now
oh yes I got the private
message
okay I'm doing
[Music]
now finish this
[Music]
race should probably restart the race I
don't have to restart the whole
[Music]
tournament okay let
me eat the rest that's because that's
fair to
do let me readjust my
position
go scoring system first yay triple yay
second double yay third single y fourth
a disappointed bunny fifth two
disappointed bunnies six three
disappointed bunnies seven four
disappointed bunnies and five
disappointed bunny
yes
hydrate what is talking me as well yeah
mean red was here first red got it first
okay let me check water bun is 500 wo
500 more and the baral bunny is
yours you're so close what the bunny
you w you're halfway
there
what the bun is showing off his
collection of
carrots so back to the game enough
enough wasting
time's trying to
hustle
I am trying
toass because it gives
me
money and you get a fair pun puns I
mean sounds fair to me I
think what funny with
[Music]
more now you're only 400 away from the F
Pon you too can play with the f p Pon it
would be fun to have a fa
P I was going to say this seems to be a
lack of races
but it's a bit forward to the top
three there we go there one of
them I'm bouncing too much of these
[Music]
walls
[Music]
oh
[Music]
checkpoint
W the camera goes into
[Music]
space
no
stupid going into the war like
[Music]
that it's for
and I guess I'm not going to be able to
do better than F or
so better than
eight four at least at least four I take
a
four you lost the
race oh more
bits yes now water Bunn is at 600 only
400 more so close
so close to the f p p p
p
yeah I need to do
better night but
sunny on night and sunny on snake path I
I assume it means clear sky not sunny
but
yes what what is
it you want a feral P
right 2
1 course second again but I'm only
sitting up right
[Music]
I think I recognize this
track it's not the same track it's the
same assets but not the same
TR that was that
scene I don't know how many scenes this
game
[Music]
have so that red light was the reverse
not
it if they're far away the light is
going to off the
[Music]
bike don't need
[Music]
L going get close and it's
cor I'm not doing so good on these
strikes no get away trying to
[Music]
win just trying to
[Music]
win okay that driver decided to slow
down
okay look at that nice
guy 250 or so it's 300 straight into our
brick
[Music]
[Music]
one
same
[Music]
here they are standing and watching at
the side of the road bike that goes
through bye
[Music]
25300 no I'm not doing great here now
what's
that there no
emoji
it is an
[Music]
emoji so it's not
recognized well I think I know why it's
not recognized
okay 54 53 52
51 you completed this super bike
Championship R again to improve your
overall
position but I wait it just went back to
one where's
my
it it just said you completed it but
okay so so
nothing nothing okay I I'll go with the
next one and then I'll try to
win I do say something here I guess it's
a yellow bike this
time what do yeah okay yeah you remind
me to
uh H the sword doesn't work because the
sword is not an emoji but has an emoji
modifier applied to
it uh a varant
selector and I have I've only h added
the single Emoji the only two I've done
the Emojis variant selector on is the
main
symbols I forgot to check the full list
of all of them but I have to do
that so let's see if this is as easy as
in the previous game because for some
reason I want to remember that these
were easier y up up up that was to my
yes
yes
[Music]
yes no what was that a crash that's not
that game
works I was doing nice
[Music]
LS and it was like
[Music]
yes
yeah can I
[Music]
can Up Up and Away no we should not go
up and
away that would be doing like a
rocket Hey where's rocket
[Music]
man yeah what did they say I have no
idea what he saying
[Music]
[Music]
there
maybe some na speak you can
[Music]
decipher okay much
better it is the first track so I guess
it's supposed to be
easy
and as the tracks go on the
[Music]
computers down
[Music]
this
[Music]
yes
[Music]
yes well that was
close who I have no idea what he
say
yes
oh
okay let me do the posture check and the
drinking
out and the Spong is
[Music]
over Spa f is back and
Herr so it's the same same people
looks NE whole
shot yes it
is is it the every track looking like
there's a whole shot in it 3 2 1
go I think only only a single track on
the
original
and motor racer had a had a bridge in it
as as seen more specifically a part of
the track that crossed it
South oh you can actually leave the
track quite far
[Music]
there
who oh it's
tight
ow but this and the editor in this game
does not allow any track to cross itself
you can technically do it you can kind
of force the track to cross itself but
the editor normally does not allow that
to happen and there's
nothing straight through the flag
Banner but you cannot cross it like it's
like an eight track you can only have it
overlap slightly that's about
it but since it only generates a section
of the track at a
time you're not going to
see both pieces of the track at the same
time
like here
some some AR over
track but I said it was only a single
track in the original games it was a
rare feature I
mean it made that track more
[Music]
special that doesn't help
me oh did the computer spawn further
back this time for once but there was
like a compete in fifth place or fourth
place
cares that's when they're nice to hit
for
[Music]
me
[Music]
much harder all of a
sudden I did say I was going to try to
win the not like the first place but win
the
championship be right back
I'm going to buy another pink one
yeah looking
a now we can serve all
[Music]
right
nice ah the red
dragon yeah I wish I could see the
because I only have one single screen I
can actually not see the on the on
screen chat but I can see the twitch
chat wish I could see the on screen
chat would I rather see the chat because
it gives me more
[Music]
information
[Music]
so let's left
[Music]
two hopefully I win this
time I don't need to win
but
there's a good amount of
points want see if the game does
something else if I win a
[Music]
champion cu the game G made no because
it did tell me to try to get a better
positions I guess that's what I should
be
doing
and what's better what's not better than
like the first
position for some reason I'm still in
second
place feel like I'm been doing well
but this one play Keep kick my
[Music]
ass
s
over be Qui time to
[Music]
[Music]
check a second pleas
not
much R complete oh
well
soup a can of soup it could be can of
[Music]
anything I'm trying to play this game
but this one play it keeps beaing my I
don't remember
[Music]
gah Hoy
27 who's gy
27 10
points free
flight oh
ads
ads I meant
ads who whoa who
yay fun you works let me H Ono yes um
every single emote Point code point
should work emotes that are combined two
emotes
[Music]
they show up as the individual Parts if
you try black cat you show us the cat
with a
black you try polar with with a
snow
[Music]
no way red green to I'm yellow we
[Music]
see
very simply simple
card this very just a single
color don't
[Music]
[Music]
white I think how was the blue one
[Music]
and also the previous game you you the
UI was red but that's only for play one
if you play two players the second play
is blue but in this
game they decided to switch it for some
reason to play one is blue and play
two yes another difference they have to
do in the game
okay I have to start now oh if you say
no it doesn't go
back 2 1
go okay this two blue racist there one
light blue and one dark
blue I think the blue this blue one but
dark blue not much
darking there's actually much
[Music]
dark there we go just slides past
everyone and then moving
[Music]
everyone anyway
[Music]
I
hope this is
enjoyable yeah benefit of making all
these emotes works on screen because
there was so many that just showed up of
squares
before that should be fixed
[Music]
now
it's nice when it
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
works
[Music]
new
[Music]
new
[Music]
you
he okay I guess you want to try to write
that that would be nit
record ow that part is not
work
need to
[Music]
[Music]
record need to record yeah but know two
te otherwise it will be me compl some
reason yeah yeah
wrong button oh you can apparently not
restart no accidentally restarts
when there we go now I'm
going
Cobblestone what's next track thir block
I don't see any Cobblestone but I do see
a lot of dirt so I mean dirt block would
be a better
term obviously the block is just cold
dirt
[Music]
if you mind stone stone smooth Stone as
call it can SP more speciic and it
becomes
[Music]
cobblestone if you mind
Cobblestone it should give you
[Music]
graml and if you mind gramel it should
become
sand and when you mine sand is you
become
[Music]
dust feel free to add additional steps
if you
[Music]
[Music]
want actually can drive in the dark R
here that's kind
of
weird oh no I touch I touched the green
outside the dark
[Music]
red no it's parent it's way too strong
day there you can see there's like an
attempt Dash is a blurry for some
reason why is everyone going past me
this is
rud I'm the one why is there a building
on a
c second time I POS didn't not it
previous
time no okay I'm doing terrible now let
St oh buying clothes wait buying clothes
what do you
mean and if you mine
dust not sure what you mean by buying
clothes but I'm up to buying clothes or
more like you buying clothes go for me I
mean if if you mind that I
guess I guess it's turn
into
air I'm trying to check off the jumps as
if this
were trash racing
I have I know
like actually is that a see Mario Kart I
know tricking off ramps with like the
orange Edge on things I
think there's the
building
[Music]
um C Racing it was a thing if you do a
trick of on edge and if you had
enough call hang time or more air time
and when you landed you got boost
depending on how long you were in there
but you have to be a minimum am of time
before you get
boost I'm buying clothes at soup oh
right
[Music]
that
[Music]
it was so memorable and I forgot about
[Music]
it s
tank
[Music]
[Music]
wearing a swimsuit while using a bike
that's quite
the yeah next
[Music]
[Music]
bik
[Music]
B P pun is up way basically
see as long as it covers of
course long as this covers on the way gu
I the swing wouldn't do
that as long as it covers her
enough
I don't like how not being able to get
past this
guy CR bumps
r r
compl buying
closes
[Music]
well it was boo so I'm still in the
lead I know what was the track
called hot price class
I'm are day
are they hot as in spicy
or are the hot that's in
warm what all are they both spicy and
War of course hot means exter warm not
just warm but very
warm
is this a C Racing
cck very
[Music]
Statics they are not the same developer
but they are but they both are from
France so they still have that
Comon there an idea for mod C Racing on
these
tracks oh
lag
point
Biney yes I don't know P spy
[Music]
PR do you know what the Swedish word for
French
[Music]
fices
there's like uh you could say three
three terms there like
one
common one short hand and one very
[Music]
different I guess it's good to be
familiar with all
three because you might stumble upon
them in real
[Music]
life
wow so much lag out
here game is supposed to run 50 but it
drops down like loading I don't know
since since I'm streaming at half the
frame
rate that is
25 yeah when is when start is like that
in my this
well
y still no
idea what the person
say I don't like how
I'm get out of the
[Music]
way I mean going ahead of me I guess
that's a way to get away
but
well that sure makes the leader get
[Music]
away
no my fix position
already that must have been
a I finished
doesn't
matter French Fri in Swedish not that
c okay that's the the common
[Music]
word which is oh no
gahi that that one is pronounced
[Music]
p p no pom
pom
pom there that's how it's pronounced
that's not how spell it though they
spell it the French
way which means
[Music]
apple and the the shorten version is
just one just that word which is not pom
instead of just pom so oh no it's snowy
and night
twister and finally unless I'm wrong
there's the third word which is
strips which is not an
action uh but if they refer a special
type of PR
[Music]
maybe as long as they are made
offo and are long and narrow not too
narrow there's no like they can be thick
qu SC doesn't matter it's only the
[Music]
same maybe strips might be used for when
they are justing as more specific
term
but the uh the first word this should
still
work I got a hair
that's annoying me that's tickling my
cheek
I need that Che P Pat that
[Music]
P these bikes are definitely slower than
the other

sports
Sports wi so she she's wearing the
sports bra and scir for the for
motorcycling is is like a very
appropriate
outfit let's spe up the loading 2 1
go 2 1
go
they seem to have reused voice clips
from the original game and then recorded
a few new
ones like that
yes which sounds very different from the
[Music]
rest
well someone's trying to
get catch up with
me if I win this I win the
tournament and let's see if the game
says something
different in that case I might need to
redo the first
one now we got the expain beit
[Music]
quick I finished this and then it says
trying to win every race come
on come
on
[Music]
not that is it Mario Kart was like four
[Music]
races so much easier to
[Music]
point can't outside the
[Music]
track
[Music]
[Music]
okay lap two and here's the end of
[Music]
lap is this an easier track where have I
become better at
game was struggling a bit on the
previous track and and yeah man of the
previous one I was struggling at quite a
[Music]
be that me they're going to get
muddy oh you're
[Music]
right I guess that's the risk you have
to take shying off the
mefish cuz people like I got
six some people find it cute and sexy
[Music]
so one more and then I'm finished
finished then see what the game
says
no too
tight hry hurry hurry wa I
won p p m wrestling oh that was no
no P the mdy bunny
tummy bring out
the towel and clean her
tummy here we go winner 69 points
nice bra you completed the most XT
championship in first
place your Victory allows you to access
the reverse mode we go now actually
completed well I guess I have to go back
here how do I
save I need to go here to
save are you sure you want to save
nah I'm not
sure who congrats
nice I'm C How many pairs of programmers
programmer socks do wait
what let's go back here
pick the pink
one what do you mean by programing
[Music]
sucks go go go okay let's so yeah so I
only have to win the championship that's
all it counts
yeah otherwise I might get a silver priz
or something what point look it's red
blue and pink now now it's red blue and
pink like it should be get out of the
[Music]
way get out of the
way
oh well best left
on for recognizing
my
bestness because I crashed into
[Music]
go that's of course not how
[Music]
win so much
quick yeah this oh
programmer socks are the thigh high
strip sock but why known as PR
horizontal vertical stripes horizontal I
guess yeah
horizontal no the stripes are parallel
to the ground when you stand
up
[Music]
that's that's how it describe it
you must describe it in the more nerdy
way but why programmer socks do you have
[Music]
any I mean I wouldn't mind I guess I
wouldn't mind like having socks that
goes up but ends right below the skirt I
think people like
[Music]
that like I could have outfit for Pon
with that I
said hey purple wolf are you on the P
pom server because I do have
a a rocket bounc up the W and L always
spe anyway when I have a thread oh I
touch
air uh for suggesting outfits for the
funun yes type exclamation point Discord
get the
thing it's
[Music]
a okay now I'm just messing
up why am I
[Music]
doing yeah I'm not wiing this one
now okay let's just start
again must that
noise became notable op for being born
by transgender and non-minor people as
well as crossdresses who do computer
programing for a hobby or
profession ah so you want me to wear
these strip STS because I'm
transgender I mean that's not what he
said
but they maybe imply
[Music]
that the CHP led to the rise in
popularity of similar jok as Crossing
during to improve one's coding
skills I think I am in there but yeah a
c outf NE please if you have any any
refenes feel free to just put there in
that topic in that thread just's go to
General press this thread button and
there should be additional outfits for
pon pon I maybe call it something else
but I think it's good
[Music]
name this good should allow you unless
you can no I don't I don't think you
can and where you can where should be a
because currently you can reference
another a channel another channel on a
Discord server when you own that Discord
server it makes sense you can reference
as channel on a different Discord server
but it would be nice if you could uh
have like a channel
Link in DMS if you share a server with
that person which is public
not public
but if you to sh that sh share a server
it is written under the neutral servers
so
yeah would be
[Music]
nice
there there an idea that popped into my
head I'm full of
ideas
[Music]
[Music]
okay complete there we
go you are transgender and get that
Compu one
I guess you're
right I guess you got a point
there you got
[Music]
me you got
me
yay we this
time cic
m
yeah I'm going to I'm going to Ping in
it in it
too
boom anyway back to the
game again course an outfit cannot just
be the socks obviously she need
now
[Music]
too oh someone flew into the
[Music]
air get out the way I'm trying to doing
this race
here this should be a w this probably a
Wiki form of racer on the wiki it should
this should be
[Music]
a in the info box for the level for the
track it should say how checkpoint is
[Music]
written completely useless information
[Music]
but that's me I'm n like
[Music]
that CU it's so weird how they write it
so different each
[Music]
time
no okay I think it's
starting okay added my suggest and a
couple of reference P that's good good
good thank
you
[Music]
when I find when I finally start making
the outfits for the model on screen on
stream the stream
model I will start
by writing a message where I will put
every single outfit in
[Music]
yes which I will then check off each one
I
make cross out I guess so people can see
that
I got every outfit incl this but I will
make them in whatever order I feel like
which I mentioned before unless you pay
me to do a certain one then I'll do it
[Music]
there we go first
place so much go first
[Music]
place there you go first
[Music]
place
[Music]
[Music]
no so e just touch the edge there and
then
fly and it's like hitting a
hole oh but it been so well and now I
lost the whole race I need to stop doing
this
let me just take take a look at what you
post because I'm
curious
oh okay I see what you mean by the socks
doesn't really let me know what kind of
outfits that should go with the socks
though unless you like those
outfits cuz I'm with you on the just the
the out
[Music]
become
[Music]
yeah those kind with with the kid SC and
a little to a little
to and that's like a long
sleeved a short
top a little top but like a top that
show are
[Music]
cuz those stops are the Miss
[Music]
[Music]
right come on
now I was so close to we and then I
messed everything
up
[Music]
that's who I
am
oh I got the wrong angle when I st
shoulders yeah those are horizontal
stripes don't
this I me I feel like sure I mean you
can see P's shoulders right now actually
this man which I pick for her her
shoulders always be
[Music]
visible since this so out to PI
from you out pick from or don't pick an
outfit and you get the one of
[Music]
them
yeah I should probably add
the but that's probably better for what
I
[Music]
do when I do lower the timer to like 5
minutes or
something then it can back have a very
cheap option to like force her dress to
be on for 5 minute in case people put a
lot of stuff in
[Music]
[Music]
the think GRE
[Music]
suggested
or it could be the same price as do
out but I mean the rest is free so don't
have to pay to see it you just have not
have to pay to
see but to Fair it is taking up the five
minutes and off could have taken up I
mean in such way you're still
determining what outfit should she she
should be Wai for 5 minutes I guess it
should be the same
price technically
[Music]
speaking there we go finally after many
attempt joke growing up was boys would
go wi for shoulders and that that's that
was why halter TOS were banned in my
High School dress code because halter
tops are the only one that shows
shoulders nothing like strapless tops or
tank tops or
um well I was going to say very short
sleeve tops they they could be
considered tank tops doing is like very
very short sleep tops
I never had that when I go gr up I've
only heard it h on the
internet but that's because when I was
growing up there was no dress code so
that's
cool people could dress reasonable
anyway so no need for address
code
yeah those bikes really drain the
performance soon as I pass everything
the the frame rate goes
[Music]
up what a rocket wa what a
rocket yay celebration for first
place it will be quick and easier it
take me five attempts to finish that
level but now it's much quicker and
easier for some
[Music]
reason no don't bounce so much you're
not a bunny not a bunny doesn't bounce
between Wes like that
anyway
[Music]
well
[Music]
on new
record best
[Music]
name
[Music]
oh no no oh I tried to save it I
couldn't
[Music]
win what's the
reaction waa three WIS in a
row can I Contin this can I win every
race first place in every race I wonder
what
happens getting a special medal many
doing that in the Olympic
Games 3 2 1
[Music]
go not only did you win this sport but
you won part of this sport CU you know
there
like multiple
[Music]
steps makes more sense for like racing
Sports which are not part of Olympic
[Music]
Games what do you have like
[Music]
yeah I don't
[Music]
know I guess it doesn't make too much
sense in the types of sports they
play don't they do
like tournament
bracket Al if they do multiple games I
whoa you can do it I am I'm trying I do
have the option to restart the race so
there let
[Music]
that oh
my this one say of video games getting
like everything that
it game say is progression I guess
although if a game has a rating system
or if it scores see how well you did is
it necessary to get the highest
[Music]
score for example the Sonic games where
they GES GES you great at the end of the
level I think the S rank is the
highest maybe the a rank is highest in
some of the
games is it necessary to get that
or did that just be considered
[Music]
[Music]
extra I'm bouncing off everyone
now no
speaking
of no come
on okay I am messing up my enough
that 2 1
go
[Music]
oh
[Music]
go go
[Music]
go I see how much I can
[Music]
go
[Music]
[Music]
there still cor is day I
[Music]
[Music]
me
[Music]
record
[Music]
okay come okay winning every race might
not be a
[Music]
possibility that don't need to win every
race just need to win the
tournament cuz I apparently just can't
win
this or should I
try I mess up too
much that bik the
[Music]
W
[Music]
face did bik again any way I just good
to for place
[Music]
popcorn sounds good yeah that's what I I
going to say to man there's also popcorn
Emoji you can use both give pop pon pon

popcorns p is still in the
lead obviously CL leave oh yeah this
this long
track
this
along NE
corn did you try to use an emote you
don't have anymore did it just run out
after you open the
stream oh on there's a
17

maybe you did show up miss
[Music]
me I've been
here I've been waiting for you to show
up what some p
[Music]
this level doesn't even say checkpoint
on the checkpoint signs is's a good idea
too to write what it says on the
checkpoint
signs on the
wiki
let me
you what fun fun love I do love
especially if I make them myself it does
say checkpoint it say checkpoint Yamaha
Yamaha that's what it
[Music]
[Music]
says well I'm here now yeah I'm thanking

been worried about
[Music]
you just crashing down the bik is that's
safe to do especially when you is

less than 100 at least or less than 100
what Sly the list of bit donations only
shows the top 10
[Music]
people still kind bouncing up the walls
I mean in still first position I guess
the P West is
one even though they have plenty of I
really don't know why they G so much
space complete the only thing I
can think of it that they
wanted with other
languages like
[Music]
Swedish and under 10 points
that
quick can I send the ad message
then 3 2 1 one
go
I don't think it should be this quick

reason it snows even though there are no
clouds where does the snow come
from what is it the Stars falling down
on the
[Music]
planet
Rocket Rocket
Man
[Music]
anyway
[Music]
checkpoint

[Music]
though need
[Music]
record
[Music]

position I keep bouncing up the
ons yeah because first it's 10 and then
it's eight then it's probably six and
then

[Music]
here we
[Music]
go no I'm rude of
[Music]
you pass p p like
[Music]
that P points
wait
was why wasn't that one
approved thought the word was
approved you killed someone I saw that
need
record Five Points now I got 50 points
of six races feel the heat so this
is
yeah two more races this one and one
other and I have 10 points in the
lead hopefully I
can not get the little point this time
come on win win
win I need the
win okay let's
restart okay I'm
by well I don't see the auto block
that's weird could be able to see I
guess it doesn't show up on
mobile oh well yeah I think
you4 the uh bo bo the web chat is better
but of course you need to run the the
Twitch app in split screen for the
web so the Qui app splits and then have
a web browser as the second window while
you open
the twitch.tv/ po/ Bon b/
CH and then get this full proper chat
and then you can also do the
purchases if you want BR beats or sub
Subs gifts or
whatever for my sneak
[Music]
play
[Music]
much and honestly the app should just
integrate the web chat obiously that
they legally not legally rules
wise the Google Google Play Store and
Apple
Store the app Apple
way does not allow you to let people
make purchases not using their stores
because they don't get any cut from that
so that's the only change they have to
do but otherwise they can use the
weapon the exact same chest by the
way yeah I'm doing t for some
[Music]
reason just cleaning a bit so I can't
unpl I see it in the on
screen M yeah I approv it so it should
have shown up
there H why you got to point out we both
PE
what we all
PE we all PE and I also have to log in
on the web version and check email for a
d verification code too much has on the
brow I don't have verification code on
the I'm using
the
uh
go you can set it to
[Music]
remember do have the two Factor
authentication but
that's because that's required for being
a few
[Music]
need but that's do an
app on my phone it's I can't switch to
to switch back to
[Music]
the
[Music]
no
me doing let me see what what is saying
there my brain works in weird way
yeah maybe it's because I always forget
my password I have to change it every
time I long in are you pring the yeah I
forgot my password button instead ofing
button I mean I don't remember my
password I have a password
[Music]
manager CU every website every login I
have is has a unique
[Music]
password
[Music]
please rememb it for
[Music]
[Music]
me
[Music]
red
P I have to read the chat when I get to
the N
[Music]
section welcome
welcome playing some classic PlayStation
one from what's this
night as I can see the title of this
thing the year Le in the title of the
stream and I keep messing up no I forget
my password all the time yeah you should
probably password manager a password
manager and just
use scrambled passwords for every
website which is more secure because I
mean you're not remember your
password and and those part passwords
would be ones you wouldn't even
remember there a
[Music]
meaning that if they do decide to leak
out your
password not the decision they makes
usually H the password is
completely well not usable for any other
[Music]
website and and if you're using Gmail
you should write your username write a
plus sign and then some identifier
for and that service you're creating the
account for and then of
course assign
gmail.com and because the the plus sign
is a valid uh symbol in email addresses
but Google does not allow you to use it
in your email address because that
symbol is reserved
for um creating alternative email add is
every every version of those are still
linked to
your but there a there's a way to one
way to th up your email but also you can
also see which services are selling your
email
[Music]
address show a couldent that by just for
every Gmail address they just just find
the plus sign and clear it but they
[Music]
don't people have noticed that when I
use their email plus Facebook at
gmail.com and then they noticed that he
get spam ref referencing his email but
that was unique for Facebook
D hm how does this
[Music]
[Music]
work
I'm not using myself really SH
[Music]
[Music]
now but if you but the plus sign is I'm
obious sign as said if they're going to
send you email they really should figure
out everything after including the plus
sign
for I mean they shouldn't because that
would be very
rude that would be a way to upate it but
um you can create
another H Gmail address and have every
email sent to your main
one that's that's a way to more observ
that's what you're doing and then if
you're getting a lot of so if you have
this unique email that specifically for
Facebook and then you get another spam
email here we go you just completed the
super bike championship in first
place you can access mirr do I have to
win the mirror mode as
well how do
I
or or do I do
yeah noral R oh wait the first one I
unlocked I unlocked reverse and now I
locked the mirror maybe that was what it
was dual sport Championship now we using
both types great
for anyway back to the message now
then switch to Yellow
back H this remind me that I still have
my copy of Jet Moto that I can play oh I
don't know what that is 1998 okay trivia
question for you folk what was the first
console 3D platformer H wait 3D
platformer
wait what count as a SED
platform what can is
3D the first 3D platform I play was
Super Mario
64 this first 3D platform I play was
either crash or
[Music]
Spire but like do yeah maybe
NPS wouldn't like Doom wouldn't count as
a
[Music]
platform but it had like those 3D
Graphics it like the development towards
reading this cus
reallying
the game play is very much
[Music]
to it still
has
[Music]
47 okay let's see if I can get first
place in the this
Championship starting off good second
position oh come on I didn't catch the
one give me your answers and I will
decide
what I know is not the correct answer
then because istic doesn't count either
that's more
yeah talking about scw
3D but you see I mean I don't don't even
know what coun a PL for
b no that was a late game
wasn't that was very
true and then then there was like the
Sonic what was it
called and you also got like to
the that just puts the too deep down on
the
ground
so it's still a flat texture like H
Super Mario Kart or something like
that was it marioart superarc I don't
remember why doing so
Terri maybe that was another one of
Toman
feel like it should be like some obscure
game wait no it wasn't a platform so it
doesn't count is the platform qualified
I kind
of when I try to think of cuz there
there's been like 3
games but I don't think they will on
this
platform
[Music]
yes exactly what he
[Music]
said I don't know what he said cuz I
don't
know
time I don't have an answer because I
have no idea what first console 3 play
performer I think yeah I don't know I I
mean I cannot even make a guess cuz I'm
too unn knowledgeable about it I don't
even know which console had C
capabilities I mean they did I mean Star
Fox was what quite an early on
console and I also don't
know was true 3DS Force I know it was
very low
frame
and no
textures but a lot of 64 games did not
really have textures PlayStation one
also has a lot of games without textures
this games have basically textures on
every part of
them well in 1064 didn't use
money rather preferred using protction
as
polygons which gives the two consoles
quite a different F I
think yay welcome thank you for Ling
I'll try to win this race I will win it
for you J oh I crashed that one of
[Music]
those I would win this one myself
anyways
[Music]
but yeah this game introduced yeah still
I want to remember there is a Mir first
too which I could unlock maybe I'll
unlock that if I win the complete the
Pokemon maybe I'm not done
with maybe I should go back
and
PR the wrong
[Music]
button okay I mean I come to this in the
first
race 2 1 go he let me read what you
wrote in
okay some has got it I yes
yeah no one wants the games anyway it's
not too obscure but it's a game called
jumping Flash and
so
definely wait first
yeah I think I've heard
about it but it's not like I could
remember it
so yeah it's it's obscure for me
is that a game I should play what
console is it
done PlayStation
oh wait wouldn't oh because if there's
been
earlier PlayStation games they have not
been platform for
me or
CD there so my PlayStation games that
they have
to because like
but yeah yeah I assume that's
the an early PlayStation game that was
like a
platformer now the reason I have to
specify console
game platform is because the first
accuracy
platform came out on do was called Alpha
Waves the wi for you J question yeah
this is deadly question I thought we
were talking about the first one we
played
well I mean I could see why you
misunderstood it because that was kind
of the like the when I don't know what
the first one was but the first one I
played was
this yeah
understand everyone crashed nice
yeah well I guess then
uh any early because it was still an
early PlayStation game so any every
earlier PlayStation game than that one
was either not 3D or not the
[Music]
platformer
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
new Rec new record maybe Rocky man has
decided not show up because every game I
play is older than me because he's so
young yeah pretty much yeah I mean
pretty
much I mean that should be the
definition right
[Music]
definition
[Music]
yeah I'm pretty sure I heard the that
came in that
[Music]
contest
have I played any game that's older than
that one on
stream
[Music]
yesly nothing to
[Music]
ATT
[Music]
I need to win
[Music]
this maybe this was
[Music]
I wonder if you would always switch
between the two types or if it does
like
random sometimes one sometimes two of
one inste four of each
time there well you should try finding a
way to play that e
time do you really want me to play that
I mean I ulator like finding the game
somewhere but would that really be that
exciting let me check because I okay
yeah it was the first race No Limit yeah
I switched to the other
one there's no
limit the J flash was released on the
28th April
1995 I think the oldest PlayStation game
I played is return fire because it's a
really old game which was released on
Playstation in
1996
okay but it was released on the 14th of
July 1995 so it was on the
3o and so it was released after jumping
Flash
have I played an older game than than
return
fire the return fire is what did I
say July right trashed
immedately
H yes July
1995 is the as far as I know the oldest
game I played on
stream
could me wrong please correct me if I'm
wrong it was I did not play the
1995 I did not play the 95 version I've
played the 96 version because I played H
when I'm still playing it I'm not done
with it yet since I'm playing the
PlayStation version and also this video
[Music]
version but it's still the same game
oh and basically this place the
[Music]
same I guess we could split it into
what's the oldest
game regardless of version and what's
the oldest version of a game I
think if in case people
are in in a disagreement of what should
count
obviously turn is on a platform but it
was not
[Music]
really but it's like if I play jumping
FL for example it would be the onlyest
game I've played so
far someone has been old game I
played I stream it might be fun yeah
definitely I definitely noticed that
because there some games I play that I
not find to be that fun to play but I
have struggled through them on stream
regardless for for example Spyro Game
Boy b games H I would I probably
wouldn't have actually I did play try to
play season wise a long time ago but I
just
didn't it wasn't fun enough to like stay
alone but actually playing it on stream
and having the goal of completing it has
been much more fun
and and sharing the experience with
other
people I comp here if you speak it will
be
Qui everyone get a
mic interesting fun fact that I think
the early
9s games in context despite the genre
being so iconic for 9s
console I can't say much should put that
first Sho is made it to the PS1 before
Platformers
did Oh you mean the platform of genre
being so I qu for this consoles or do
you
[Music]
mean I think there's some context there
missing this me I switch back and forth
now like on motorer that one yeah
can't after a second re
through well yeah in the first person
shooter games were not good like control
wise but luckily with with
u like
emulations
like I mean I have the
game speaking of legality when people if
someone say emulation is illegal I know
at PlayStation 3 with play one
capabilities to play the game I also
have the physical copy of the game which
is why I play European version so some
people have said like yeah you should
play the the the North American version
of the game but yeah but that would
require me to Pirate it you
know or I just play the version I have
ripped from the
disc which is why I had problem playing
Spyro 3 which has a copyright protection
I had to solve and when I tried to play
motor rer
one it also had some issues running it's
it's not a perfect SC but it works so I
have all the stuff I need to be able to
play
anination H which is why I'm playing leg
one
animation
anyway but benefit of Anin
is that I can change the controls the
modern controls which I have done in
this game because on the PlayStation one
a lot of rising games this one included
you use the right stick as your
accelerator so you can choose how much
you want to accelerate and break and use
left stick for
[Music]
steering
but with PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 they
introduced W that was close
uh they introduced the uh
triggers and racing games quickly
switched over to using the triggers as
accelerating and breaking since
they more resemble
the
the it's I mean obviously he not like
using real things
obviously but uh yeah s changed over the
controls of this game so the the TR
triggers this is why I had to restart
the game and start the stream the
triggers I I when I press the triggers
it moves the right stick and then the
right sck is the triggers
instead
Al so I do still have all the controls
there to rearrange
them so playing first person shooter on
play or any other
console if I
can get my hands on that but at least on
PlayStation and it should not be too
much of a trouble if I can adjust the
controls to be
good we'll see it it really depends on
the game and how they decided to control
to be
likee so much easy for some reason
yes yes I keep forget you have to press
continue h I should close this one back
to chat and as soon as your timer is
over
H I don't remember all the games you
played off the top of my head much less
to release
dates I could I do have the list of all
games uh the year the date I started
playing date finish the
game oh Aces I could add the date the uh
game was released like any of the
version of the game was released which
is what I usually write that's why when
I play re fire I write 95 in the title
but I'm playing the 96
version I don't know if I should write
96 I just I think the age of the game
comes across bar if I write 95 it's just
a one year difference but
but I mean game development was 10
times
whatever but then I can on that list
also write the well the that version of
the game as well as the the first
version regardless of
[Music]
console I didn't even finish the
comments sorry about that he of flame
looked fun at least yeah season play was
quite an improvement over H season of
ice it's it's definitely a version if
you want to play those for real that's
the version that you should rather play
um it has Sheila
on and that
one and they don't really have any
connection there's no progression in
story they're completely independent of
each each other can say the of Space Age
Speedway here I mean some of them were
okay but it did take the like Halo get
consistently good console FP controls
that is true Halo I Halo is a good game
I think I should play through Halo
games I do have an Xbox 360 so we and I
do have
Halo at least Halo 2
3
ODST reach
M4 so I could play but but I would
prefer playing the master chief the
collection
which if I understand it correctly
that's a remake of the first three games
but then I still have to play reach on
360 unless they have released that on so
three other way and the four also on 360
I think and the fifth one was on Xbox
One and windows I think a lot of
guessing here because I'm not sure while
while the master Edition collection was
released on Xbox One and windows as well
so I could play it so when I get a new
new computer or buy one I can H play I
get games to run with as well okay H
golden
gold7 isn't that n 64 I don't have that
not
yet okay even pled by nalia that games
controls well offering lot
of FL well we'll see when I get to the
game can't even call it nostal I never
played person i't imag it reputation
carries oh sorry and now I see sorry I
missed that you actually made a reply to
the
gold7 yes
the like golden
s was um because it was on nintend 6 4
it only had one stick so the aiming you
uh it was a very long time ago so I
might
misremember you had the two you had
probably more than two H but two main
ways of
H uh setting up the controls you could
either use the d-pad to move and stick
to aim which seems the the optimal way
of doing it because you have precise
aiming more precise aiming obviously
Mouse would be more preferable or you
can use the stick for movement and the C
buttons for aiming but that does not
seem like a good
idea like using it because the C buttons
is basically a d-pad it's like aiming
using a keyboard it does not seem like a
good
idea and but I think that's the
default or something I don't know
because you have the because behind the
d-pad stick and the C buttons you do
have a trigger like
button uh but yeah
anyway it be fun to play
that I can't even
[Music]
call I think a lot of people blind here
as long as people have fun playing
games that's the most
[Music]
important
but I guess it's come on can I stop
doing
it I keeping left and right then just
restart I guess that's like Nostalgia if
you want to try to
um suggest the game to someone to like
play like this was a good
game like if you if you know a game you
had fun playing when you were little or
still having fun to play because you're
so experienced with now if I try to play
it I might not t sound fun because I
don't have nighted in St or experience
in
game so for example if I were to play
any of the Mario games I do want to play
those always when it says that a bump
into the
one oh this is a short level what
track yeah anyway because one is I have
with Mario as someone who grew up with
play SP and crash is that Mario is very
slippery he has slow
acceleration and slow the acceleration
compared to like crash
Spyro when crash Spyro more more more
spal than crash does still have
acceleration and the experation but much
much less than
Mario and that's because I have played
some of the games and I might not have
had enough experience with it I don't
but when I play the game because I'm not
used to it it does feel like always
being on
ice and if there's ice in the game
that's going to
[Music]
make so yeah
that's and that can Le to just
frustration annoyance but I try to work
through
it
when I play the games complete why why
why is it going so well all of a
[Music]
sudden I had so much struggle before now
he flying through the
levels like a
[Music]
rocket four after four first places all
TR
yellow
bik wo hello Papa wolf I assume you've
been here Ling but hello
again when I don't when I see someone
right to whose me last message has
scrolled to the top of the screen and
then right again I like to
welcome people like to say well I've
been here but yeah but I haven't seen it
that's the same
I can only I can only know you're here
if you write
something I mean of course you write you
say that you're here because confirm you
been
here like see me being here because you
right
again
so I don't know what I'm trying to
say oh St is the
[Music]
one
oh nice
Bridge quite the tunnel
okay they cannot build a tunel
straight very
[Music]
wobbly who killed someone hope you
didn't see
[Music]
that this is the old
trick the original
[Music]
trick I should play all this St games
they play think three start
[Music]
Cas at least those three would be
nostalgic to place me
that was so long time I this
one should definely do
that but I do I do like Place game
so and there should only be one single
game left on the PlayStation one
for mot racer and that's the M world for
or is the switch word for to by the
way the
world first
again have you seen Mar shoes no head on
them no wonder he doesn't have much
great F fan of fan of he should probably
get some new shoes those shoes were made
for
plumbing
old
trck through Old Woods over your Old
Creek cry
[Music]
C five out five descent descent the the
scent
descent descent that was the last one t
is bumbly because it was a rush job and
they P the cheapest Pro to build it they
did they they did make it quite
intricate though for for being
cheap lots of Corners were cut it's
basically the circle they cut so many
corners
yeah descent into the
[Music]
maom
[Music]
m
snowing full speed through
[Music]
snow I should play some other
like tiny games there's like a racing
game known as gen rally which is a free
game there isn't really anything to
complete in game but I guess I could do
like
win every track that comes with the
game it's a it's a free game where you
can basically add as many tracks and
cars as you want by just I making
yourself or downloading them
but I guess for the sake of like
completing the game that would be
to could try to win every track in the
game we'll see
there shouldn't be too many tracks in
the
game
[Music]
no I crashed into gold and got a
record that's
quite
funny did Judge them measuring the time
[Music]
well cross the finish line it's body
that counts not the
[Music]
fight
[Music]
what okay you know
what let's see if I can win this what
happens if I win every single race in a
tra do I get anything special from that
does it mean I have to restart retry
those other
[Music]
pament or is that just a cosmetic thing
and does not really count towards
completion of
game because I don't want to get stuck
on a single game forever
I don't want to push myself push myself
too hard on each
[Music]
game there you go
nice I did not PP on one of
[Music]
the
[Music]
I know I ra a game called C3 racing
never seen it but it looks interesting
at least yeah never completed on
neither not on stream and not in outside
stream
either there's a track in it that takes
place
[Music]
normally there was also a game called
the
TTR wait what called
wiia never
[Music]
remember I never remember the name of it
it's a version of that game I could play
too people are really
curious I mean curious to see the
differences I think that game is easier
the European game was too hard we must
Mak it
easier come on come on come
on should I should I take a second place
or should I he should I go for the first
place I'm so close to win getting the
first place
uh I will check what the game was called
again TNN Motorsports hardcore TR that
was the name of the game what did you
hit there tou things
no yeah one more time second place is
good enough to winning the
tournament was so close to actually
getting a first place and I want to see
what happens if I get every first place
because I got every first place so far
this only this track that gives me a bit
of
[Music]
trouble yeah TNN Motorsports hardcore TR
is the nor American version of DC
racing because why would they have a
simple
name
35 C3 racing is car construction
Championship racing but at least they
shorten it to see scen
racing hard spot SP
hard the T so long and
weird what Mak it weirder is that like C
Racing its own instance it's the only
game of the whole series this is racing
nothing
else is the only
game but the
ttn for hard or whatever it was and that
is a
franchise
so there are more games but specifically
that game out of the franchise is C3
racing and those are other games I don't
know if they are original games or all
supported other
games or well I guess if you considered
for oh to
[Music]
NC game is as far as I know not adjusted
for the frame rate difference so it runs
too quick fast fast too fast
and he do
resolution there we go that's
how well
done new crashing record fastest crash
would ever seen but did he hit it's just
it's it's just on the edge of the track
there's
this I don't know it's hard to see the
edge of the track sometimes what is this
there oh can't forget the most realistic
racing game ever there big RIS of the
road racing I mean I guess I could play
it but isn't it like one track only with
an opponent that doesn't move and you
after you complete the race you win I
mean I could still play it and complete
the game if that's all the game has then
in that case I
[Music]
win best way to win throw the step off
the bike and let lifeless body slide
over the the
line
but is that actually
quicker in real life it wouldn't be
quicker because the body cannot have
higher speed than you have while on the
bike it's better just
let just fly with the bike to the p
l but I and also don't
think you go quicker after crashing
because you lose a lot of speed when it
crash and the body flies more upwards
than forwards which I guess who killed
some people
there and so they will is so you also
lose forward
[Music]
speed I mean I assume you were joking
but but from like a but even considering
it a technique in the game it's not it
is a technique you can use in C C3
racing it's a hard technique to do
because in that game when you crash and
reset I think you it's something like
you you are reset from where you L left
the ground or something like
that you reset I'll be back oh ads now
you should do exclamation point add
message any I'm moning that command to
let everyone who isn't subscribed that
the ads will be for 3 minutes
and and will not long had ass for 57
minutes which nice now we're going for 7
7 hours 3 hours I'm sure
[Music]
ni yeah in is racing
I guess no one wants the explanation
point
that all
right yeah all I I could see if I can
[Music]
that so I said in that means that in CG
racing what you can do is Crash before
the Finish Line make your car fly
through the finish line so it counts as
you crossing the line this should not be
on the final lap because you don't get
anything from it uh but the previous lap
and then you will res be reset behind
the Finish Line still having your lap
counted and as you cross the finish lap
Finish Line again you get another lap
counted
[Music]
but actually crashing at the Finish Line
in is in itself very tricky depending on
track and then also making sure that you
crash before the finish line and fly
into the
[Music]
goal
okay I'll do the
message I don't want to he to rep
play which race I guess game
over anyway back to the
game there you go seven races seven
first places hard turn last race and the
last first place I
need and the opponent moves it'll just
stop before Crossing to Finish Line
because there is no script for any
scenario in
which all right it stopped before the
Finish
Line let's for any scenario which
computer wins
killing holding the competition
smart well I
[Music]
guess it is either that that they
intentionally made it stop before the
finish line and they were meant to make
it cross the finish line when they
finished that
scenario or they made the made
it made it stop H off like they were
make Were Meant to make it stop when it
crosses the finish line but made it stop
too early
[Music]
maybe
someone cuz it's hard no
intentions unless the developer
something has said
something or yeah I don't know maybe
someone
had tested making foring the computer to
win and get crash or something and stay
in passion made battle in that Cas that
would be you could probably assume that
it was intentional in that
way that's that's
fine I I'm doing so bad on this
[Music]
Tack and also I was definitely not to F
this racer on this track those other
race is in ahead of me are fting me they
apparently they are not allowed to score
records only I'm allowed
to you need to use a pink
[Music]
or
[Music]
ah yeah I'm not
C this not first place I need oh I'm now
[Music]
second
okay 3 2
one
go anyway okay when it said the game
over I thought it was going to go back
to the m menu it doesn't matter because
it actually tracks the completion of the
tournaments I can actually go back to
menu menu and continue oh and the r k
had no top speed oh yeah that's
also the game has so realistic
[Music]
physics
[Music]
okay let me see if I
can I know I skipped one of the
[Music]
comments but I'm doing so well right
now
I'm still in firstes place so doesn't
matter how much to bounce there because
I can bounce because I'm a
bouncy what girl welcome do some highs
speeded biking at the
moment not Dr
apparently I did not pick the pink
bike I did not pick the pink bike
because it was pink I picked a bike
based on the stats and it was pink
[Music]
oh yeah now I don't have a chance to
[Music]
Wi yeah no I didn't okay okay now I
can't and you can eventually crash the
game by going in reverse since you begin
to move faster than the game can render
track can load it but think I is that is
some kind of over overflowing in
the calculations for Speed but probably
the track
loading it is absolutely the most
realistic RAC game ever yes I think it
had like crash physics and
everything L I just woke up that's fine
you have no obligation to be
here don't be
[Music]
sorry
you kind of you should not be sorry for
something you don't haveen
[Music]
here so but I do appreciate that you
take your time it's nice this anything
you want to talk about we've been
talking about a lot of stuff
today with games trying to figure out
what the oldest game I play is weap I
killed
someone it happens that not in first
place I'm getting worse now I think so I
point that's not
[Music]
break hey everyone have slept today
apparently and what makes it funny is
that I'm streaming even 1 hour later for
both for most of you people been
CH so
what with this over sleeping when the
stream is 1 hour late and it doesn't
make any
sense it's
illogical oh so I'm not the
only yeah I no need to feel
[Music]
bad you're the only you're the only for
here this
special and I do want to
do since you do have a
Persona spil do you it your profile
picture on Twitch I don't know if you
can I think you should be able to see it
on too by pressing username
something and
oh no this is just the second place
[Music]
bike do have one
more come
[Music]
pass and because I do want to do which I
mentioned
before the head path thing redeem where
where it's like your hand your
character's hand your first so know like
what I can do with a human hand if
someone
[Music]
want no no I'm not
going no come on last race to
win H your chances of being killed by a
bunny are low but never seen wake up at
the morning time I stream for another
hour take a nap until stream starts I
will SLE that's how it
happens and everyone is doing
that everyone wakes up in time for my
regular streaming time I mean my time
hasn't changed for
me yeah that's why I specified it in the
uh in
the server that's everyone outside my
region is is going to changed
[Music]
more I hav updated this schedule on the
on end screen just keep forgetting
switching to the end screen at the end
of the
stream oh that was nice
Rec not the
bragman keep bouncing up the war again
oh oh
is
stoping come on come on can't do this
[Music]
Spike King F of
[Music]
goodness
just need to keep the first
[Music]
place okay and to
finally final
stretch
whoa there we go finally well done well
done actually you're the only the one
who changed the time moved it back I
with rest well I did I mean technically
yes sure I did change time
but but the same numbers on the clock 80
out of 80
points
Bravo always said Bravo you've completed
this dual sport championship in first
place you completed three championships
in first place your new challenge
ultimate Championship ooh but all custom
oh custom Championship is the um custom
levels are there any custom levels wait
Speedway okay so there are some custom
levels
already let me check that yeah so there
are C because these are the
standard custom levels I guess I should
complete them as well wait there's only
there's only there's only two tracks
but I mean it's because that's the
standard I guess I could do
that so you don't get anything for
winning first place should I since I
don't have anything else to do
really guess I can continue the game cuz
I have the because I had things I wanted
to doday but I was able to do them so I
guess I just continue French
Bing
Bravo let's just continue
playing would be fun to like complete
this game I didn't unlock anything so I
assume I have basically unlocked
everything we'll see what happens if I
win
this really really really nice with like
after waiting so long for to load have
like screen that says are you ready to
race after has loaded but no so computer
is going to be more
difficult yeah so absolutely nothing
happens if you get first place in every
race that can just focus
on
winning
wh on we need the championship points
not first
places
[Music]
wow what a
rocket so many friends there rockets and
still the Rocket
[Music]
Man
[Music]
yeah the commun definitely harder than
[Music]
this I mean I'm not so good at the track
either but i' the computer is
[Music]
MYRY
oh now maybe I should restart at this
point switer time because it's
raining all
right when it's raining I'm put
it
that 3 2 1
[Music]
go oh my
oh my I'm doing bad
[Music]
now come on stupid RAC getting in the
way yep swim shift in the
[Music]
rain s s the
[Music]
rain
[Music]
swing shoting in the
[Music]
ring really should add more games to my
suggested games
list guys I should play guitar here one
and two
because
well those contains original songs they
con contain original performances of
existing songs and therefore I should be
allowed to play those on
screen and then I just have to check the
speed for course it doesn't contain
[Music]
any
music not made for the
[Music]
game while I do problem is
that I don't actually have like actually
have guitar controllers but those are
for Xbox 360 I don't have it for
PlayStation and the first Guitar Hero is
for
PlayStation
so but at least the first two does
support controller so I can at least do
it that and and do it more like a rhythm
game more than actually a guitar
controller game and and I think that's
[Music]
fine look another pink P there a
different shade of pink more pinkish
pink this is more my that I'm
[Music]
using worst place yeah I'm not doing so
good on this
we see how it
goes yeah probably
need checko hello SW cats nice of you
stu
[Music]
by we got the we got the whole SW cat
here com by the cute and adorable one
[Music]
man racing motorcycles on a motorcycle
while wearing a swim
super CU someone s that that I should do
that W okay I'm doing bad at
Moment In The Rain hi hi thinging for
feral pon pon
mix wait wait what's what's going on
here thinging two fa pon pon that's 14
on p
p
what is going
[Music]
on a burger for princess yeah I will eat
a burger
after a nice
burger yeah I'm not doing good is this
is this is this uh Need for
Speed all over
again where
where is that impossible final
championship that was completely secret
that was I joking about see like
completely secret Championship
impossible and then I unlocked the
completely fully secret complete secret
Championship as impossible to
[Music]
me
well I guess that's my
luck at least at least I can actually
climb some positions here un like you
need
[Music]
to I guess it's a good thing you don't
get anything special for get in first
place in every track and only have to
win most
points
because I'm not doing good on this one
okay especially
inash well well Five Burgers those
burgers are way too big for
[Music]
that when the burg is being on my hand
I'm
probably more reasonable Insight in the
cat that there some
windows they probably appear a bit
[Music]
bigger on Android because on Windows
they have a order black corner at least
the windows imine I'm
using get out of my way
by yeah emojis are treated like emotes
in my own screen
chat in
case you want post
emojis
[Music]
the
[Music]
whole oh only second left I'm definitely
Ste keep bumping
[Music]
once when I bump the in in the wall
That's
that's a bit silly cuz I can just easily
not have done that by
not feeling so
hard outside W makes more
[Music]
sense
record can out my
[Music]
way no
yeah the grass just had to poke out
there and get in my way as I was trying
to cut the corner and now I'm just
messing everything
up pon pon is singing to Fair pon pon
who is supposed who's supposed to dance
but she's not interesting voes her
opinion which is a shock to the other
pon pon who was expecting CR
to 2 1 go voice is yeah she sure is
voicing bang BL
glass yeah those
polygons got
me if it weren't for those polygons I
would have won that
[Music]
[Music]
race
[Music]
one one
[Music]
go what
B
how
run over a pebble next
time yeah it
happens it
happens I mean I didn't drive straight
into the edge of the track but but yes a
p yeah I think the reason why the motor
cross bikes are easier because they're
slower
when the game is running slower it's
easier to keep up what's going
[Music]
on game is running 50 frames per second
for me not not on stream though but for
me if I had a better
computer come on that shouldn't then be
like
[Music]
trash me sure in real life it should
have been crash but this is arcade this
isn't simulation there is a simulation
mode
though it's probably not that
[Music]
[Music]
simulating don't what I don't mind
things simulating
[Music]
games they crash I think
[Music]
f ah this is going to be tricky
fun lecking on a this is the first
[Music]
race they are running to that Rocky Edge
well you should more it would be nicer
if you can drive over it and then you
like lift off the track and then you
going of get a bit airborne and
obviously in the air you don't have
control over the bik
and they still lose on trying to cut the
track like that that but it shouldn't be
a crash is what I'm trying to
say he going to eat that entire Burger
so yeah it will take probably the whole
[Music]
[Music]
day a giant burger takes all day uh a
giant dret bar is eaten in an
hour there we go now I'm doing
one now we just need to keep
[Music]
this
[Music]
now was going
to try to not do turbo as often I'll do
it on this all these straight
lines which is not here even though it
it looks pretty straight on the map
should maybe
[Music]
do
record
[Music]
final than se0
[Music]
come on come on come
[Music]
on have someone very close behind
me speed W there we go first nice take a
few
times FAL pon pon
Arrow Burger pon pon
set oh I think you
want that's not it I think you want this
Arrow let's H Emoji
Arrow I should probably go save it's
because there's no save option in that
menu so you mean f p p turn into a
bag barel pon pon
Arrow
Burger
cry there we
go
yeah it
worked I like larer than
one this is also one of those that
switches back and
forth p p is back in
headress I guess P Pon could have like a
motor
cross outfit full body suit it will
cover
everything and I guess not be
to exposing look
C who want to T everything
that
so much easier compared to the previous
race cuz it's so much slower easier to
keep
track the corners are much
[Music]
nicer and there's not a lot of bumbs the
the road is pretty smooth
[Music]
here
[Music]
oh
[Music]
bu gu the bumps didn't show
up the bumps are here
too wait where does those pumps come
from I don't remember these men
[Music]
can basically Go full
turbo throughout the
race turn through the
corners maybe not this
[Music]
corner
almost cres into the in the corner
there Prett much nice 11
[Music]
right yeah I was going say must be the
second lap where I don't start my St and
should be cing
I start a bit behind it so the
Improvement must too
much so much this like like 3 minutes
and this
[Music]
Race 3 minutes and 30
[Music]
seconds
[Music]
let s to the Eng
[Music]
day
record and slightly better left
again
yeah oh my tunic is out for a delivery
they're going to remove the liver from
your
tunic here we go 3 minutes 33 seconds
and 30
[Music]
CCS can it even be better than
that
it's it's it's it's
wonderful it cannot be 33 CCS because it
as it's running 50 frames per second
therefore this lastage can only be even
as we can see by 77 53
47 as well which I guess maybe it h does
in that
case some form of calcul for what your
final speed highway speed I don't like
sound
that what your final time should
be if it should be that extra Cc or
[Music]
not
go go by
go 3 2 and let
go 3 2 1
go
go
[Music]
well yeah inwi like Ready set go with
the
CL but if you say like 321 go for some
reason I want to say sh
not
cool cool I would say
sure
instead it means
drive but that's also valid as a
starting message starting announcement
which I think is more valid for
vehicles vehicles based
[Music]
race and and you I think we can say CL F
sure I think that's perfectly fine it
doesn't sound weird to me but
saying a bit odd but I can still see it
being
valid but still sh for vehicles go for
like
phisical non vehicle
based non
machine assistant
[Music]
competition
come on CR time do you know how to spell
[Music]
sh BR thought I heard well I did say sh
went Bo as
well such a
fact
so but that was the thing I was going
over like
how yeah it could be like 3 to1
drive as you're driving and not walking
because go is Switched for going and
[Music]
walking so if you say like should we go
there it could imply actually walking by
foot
and but I guess you can also say
it
[Music]
not right in I
[Music]
think well I don't exctly need doing
this as I said I don't need the first
place
track this is fine more position F
that's five
[Music]
points
[Music]
[Music]
points come on attach the the the
the the r ass
F oh no this is four points this is good
I accept Five Points not four
[Music]
points that was close and then I bom
them once I lost my
[Music]
speed oh my oh my not doing that good
that
[Music]
mind it's not
terrible St no that means seem being in
love I love how you design your Motes I
mean I haven't designed
it I mean you could say yeah do you love
how it is design
I have not modified that's how it is by
default I still have most points I'm
happy with that D wave I mean otherwise
if I could change it I wouldn't do this
yellow one these the pink one
Myer but I I could I could try
this h no
customization it's the one that's
fastest it's not the fastest it is the
one that has the best acceleration and
the one point from Maximum max top
speed see if there what the options are
between those that have top speed I
think this this max top speed but it has
the lowest
[Music]
acceleration but how much quicker is
it doesn't seem like it is quick
[Music]
game don't seem I mean
before yeah I to build up definitely
slow exclamation yeah
[Music]
that's oh
no oh
no that ain't good
get out of the
[Music]
way I'm trying to win this
race this crappy
bike he has one high point in top speed
but it doesn't seem to be quicker so I
will definitely use my regular bike
[Music]
thiss more yeah
that's use
the use the better bike
instead oh now they
escaped
what
there's a problem one okay wa okay so
this one has Max Speed okay it has two
points
acceleration there AR any good options
this is a good
option this is a good
option 3 2 1
go
[Music]
two and
Sh actually I don't know what what if
they changed what it says when it's
running I said I should
check do not check
transation it has the
regular it's what that's what's so
interesting about motoracer really it
has all the regulars European like
translations you would expect from the
game and then Swedish for some
[Music]
reason which was you know quite useful
when I was a child didn't speaking
English and playing m because was one of
those games that actually has
Swedish yeah then it's like German
Spanish French
Italian like I'm missing language French
German Spanish Italian no that's what
the all four
languages and English of course and
there Swedish
no idea why they do it in there I
[Music]
mean yes considering the how little text
it is in the game they really should
consider adding no languages have at
that point of
course have at that
point cuz it is not much Tak this game
to translate in the first place
so
[Music]
especially since the voice isn't
T and yeah the textures AR changed
righte see textures are just spers
anyway
okay
out of the
way whoop whoop double
whoop golden o double
ice yeah I'm not
one yeah I probably have to restart in
this days I'm not going
Swedish not Norwegian yes Swedish
yep I mean a Norwegian person might be
able to use
Swedish if they don't understand
English no
polish yeah I said the number of
PlayStation One games that has polish is
very small I think less than Swedish
that two games with
[Music]
Swedish bom is one of
them EA Sports has Swedish in some of
the
[Music]
games there a much of sports game but I
guess I mean if I'm going to play
through every PS1 game I do have play
sports games
too and I guess the goal of those games
is
to
win the uh
main thing they
have I can set the game to like the
shortest play time so it goes by
quick I really wish they could uh
because I was thought about that before
because yeah EA has the NHL
series uh which it is interesting
because they have NHL and FIFA although
they don't have FIFA anymore and they
have FIFA which is interesting
because NHL is the Canadian series
United States placing as well and and
then while FIFA is the world
Organization for football
and there is one world Organization for
ice hockey which is I I
HF well I guess it's a federation
International Ice hocke
Federation so the games really should
have been called I HF which is what they
have I
mean they they started off with NHL and
that's basically every PlayStation game
there one game is nhm but they did add
additional series to the game later on
from the
IHF
but people will be so confused with the
game game change name all sudden people
would be able to find
it
yeah all right in first place and very
nice
yeah the thing I was going to say was in
ANL and they have you in at least when I
looked around the game because I've done
that they they allow you to set the
period lengths of 5 10 and 20 minutes
but you always have to play 20 three
periods I think the game would benefit
more if you could like play one or two
periods if you had that option too bre
complete cuz at even at the lowest time
of 5 minutes still means 15 minutes per
[Music]
game but so 20 minute period is lower to
5 minutes technically not exactly 5
minutes because what they do is the last
minute is full real time so Tak more
than
15
anyway that's another Win
w
no y go go
go not sure if whoop or woof hey you can
come in come in here wof Oh you mean the
the I think it sounds like whoop but I
guess I guess we need to listen to it
more which Football Association or
rugby I
mean what what does FIFA stand
for the Federation of International
Football associ no that's
I mean it's probably french or
[Music]
something I don't
remember maybe this is French for the
Federation International football
association association football
International Federation
Aisha SP I
guess it would be
Association H International Association
Football Federation so
I there we
go that I might be wrong that might not
be what that just that
[Music]
F wow what a rocket I'm doing I think
I'm doing better now so anyway in FIFA
is FIFA games you can set the half time
which there's two half times to play
to almost any
number like I think the lowest is 2
minutes and then you have four and then
and there's a bunch of different numbers
like 10 15 up to
45 you can play a game as short as 4
minutes 4 minutes compared to the nhls
which is 15 minutes as
shortest so quite a time difference
there I think it's Spanish Spanish
football well they pretty sure they have
Spanish football in
it little
jump well I'll just continue through
this it goes well So Far So eventually I
will be done with this game today we're
going for 3 hours and 46 minutes so
far 3 2 one
[Music]
go and I always start at the back
doesn't matter where in the leaderboard
I am such a cheating
game very arade when your position is
always at the back when you're in the
play you just so you should always start
at the back your
care I hope hope I know enough Spanish
to read
[Music]
that I don't know what it means
though but I
mean Y is I unless mean something else
in that
context is probably the
verb in the first person sing
S I don't think those are
some words and espanol mean
[Music]
Spanish new
Rec
[Music]
checkpoint
[Music]
checkpoint in Swedish would be control
good
with g games have used for their word
for
checkpoint
uh other games have used the word
checkpoint for checkpoint in
Swedish I actually don't know what wor
would would be good or like a certain
word could be used because like in Spyro
I'm pretty sure they never use the term
checkpoint they just say that if you get
into a trouble you will be BL back here
which is that
[Music]
for checkpoint is such a weird word but
being so accepted into gaming
that look
like it's the point where you check
stuff no it's a point CU this game
doesn't even have checkpoint these are
these are time
extension
lines those are called the segments I
think wait this a different time
racing sector that's what it called the
sector
[Music]
lines
sectors that's what they are they're not
even
checkpoints like
and even in Crash when you open those
spot this but it says checkpoint those
aren't checkpoints you're not checking
anything as why I now what am I
misunderstanding
anything yeah yeah it's what I just
wrote before the I think it's Spanish
ah I
[Music]
think
K and that's Spanish can you write I
think I think it's Spanish
in P of sand what a level at least is
two
laps wa it's another one of these in a
row can you write can you write I think
it's Spanish in
Swedish I didn't you write in English I
think it's Spanish and
[Music]
Swedish right using the Swedish language
the following things
I think it's
Spanish cuz it is one of those tricky
ones maybe it's sping it for you
[Music]
now let's see how it
goes yeah we need make 10 otherwise he's
finally done
oh
Cel I did say when I was playing Su the
N Speed game
that that I should
[Music]
uh now explore the level but I
never
[Music]
there so much stuff in
[Music]
now one game would like to play Street
[Music]
skater it's one play one game but it
Curr has a lot of music music I thing
sad big
sad try need to silence the music
and uh but then I need to replace the
music with
[Music]
something can't play
[Music]
Miz
this game does allow you the same with
the previous game does allow me put in
music CD to have your own music
play instead of the in game music but
then you have to put it back to load the
back into menu and load the next track
and then you can switch back to music
there's lot of switching back points
it's more uh F thing for when
you
more for when you do like practice on a
single track over and over
[Music]
again the H come
Spanish there shouldn't be an H in
that now 2K that is
um
that is when you think
that where have I this Championship oh
it's the last
one just started with a race like this
and ends with a no
actually
uh that's more
like
it's hard to say TK is not a great
word at
least you can
[Music]
say
let's say like let's take the phrase
uh and I think it's raining you can you
can trust it to Y the train that means
that uh well sure you probably I I think
it's raining but that's more like you're
looking out and what you consider the
current weather situation to be you
consider it being raining
uh you can argue
that that would be suitable
[Music]
H for your sentence but it doesn't feel
right the other one is true which is
when you
believe that it is in this case have two
different
[Music]
me
I don't know TI it should be TI at by
the way uh I think that's that's more of
a stronger like using the knowledge I
have you're listening to it multiple
times it just feels like it is
[Music]
Spanish hope session the place
repay
I didn't keep track of where I was in
the
race hope hopefully I get enough points
to not lose the
championship yeah I still won
W Bravo you completed the ultimate
championship in first
place now I won the game now it's
loading
something it had had to load a

hpos why does John mcnight get a whole
webite wait more of them got like pro
circuit and another one with Mikey
[Music]
P yeah enough one thanks for the
playing hello coming in here at the end
of the
game thank you everyone for be
here so I guess the game considered me
completing games I will take that I will
consider that as the game
completed I mean I can still do
the especially when it puts me back to
the main menu
he so I can still do like the two
track that was fun du to custom track I
should probably can I delete the tracks
so will it
[Music]
no I don't I don't want to save
[Music]
again because if
I delete
[Music]
track does it even allow me to do
Championship oh yes it does
good sometimes it might
[Music]
be unless these are existing tracks
actually don't
know there we
go Speedway I mean I don't I don't
exactly recognize the track I could be
wrong I might be silly yay
Ty see that's why they should hire me on
the team let's do the quick two
track is this seem I mean I've played
this theme before but not this track I
see I play it for it's a very simple
shape
[Music]
so it's a very
simple whoops hey they're running me
over oh someone else
[Music]
question a bunch
[Music]
question
wor
make your own track yes I was thinking
about maybe I should
like see what I can do with the
[Music]
editor not that I'm likeing
up spending rest of this days making
TR now i' like to see what the extremes
of the editor can be like I used it
before as but it was such
[Music]
come on should supposed to lose on this
[Music]
track I thank
[Music]
you I can't L this
TR then they will make a
[Music]
this
come
on SL down for me
please let me get keep up with
[Music]
you ter because that makes
[Music]
sense there they are but
[Music]
I'm okay
let's let's restart him guess that's I
to do Michelin
[Music]
Man wa I should be able to win this this
last
tournament te not part of the
game but it's nice that they
have
a rocket whoa what a rocket oh I wonder
if there's like Pats that removes any
restriction of how we can create a
map that would be
[Music]
[Music]
something they probably will make the
game look very
[Music]
good W that was
close but still full speed into
[Music]
it not a
[Music]
s
no how do I keep doing
[Music]
this keep on
[Music]
this
at least they didn't get too far ahead
say because crashing I still didn't keep
up this okay was that
[Music]
better 28 seconds to
complete wo who go go wo yay first
place wa 10
points
and cross down is the second
one let's win these two and then I won
every single track in the whole
game 3 2 1
go this also looks like a very simple
sh
[Music]
go go
go should I've you've seen on you must
have seen on all stream is that when you
post
a you send an
emote and it shows up on screen uh I
would prefer it not like covering the
game screen even the P hand is on the
game scream right now
but got that but I was thinking I do
have the rabbit background there I mean
there's plenty of space to put the rain
of emotes
there
[Music]
this is a long track I mean the tank is
probably not longer us more take
[Music]
snowing
ra p p static p p and shaking p p i just
is D I should still do like custom P Pon
mode way uh which is actually meant to
be shaking
[Music]
oh which is a facial expression that bit
the
shaky even though I crashed it still
didn't keep like almost run past me oh
no you pass me after the Finish Line oh
no fa P has been captured nine of
them you can't even make it larger
because it should still work you let say
at 10 I think so you can make it yes you
can make it like 10 you can fit in eight
baral P pons 8 by eight 6 more of
them Bravo you completed the custom
championship in first place now got that
one this is really short because they
only had two tracks repeated
okay so these are all the
tracks these are the I'm not exact sure
how
they here I done all so this is the
first tournament this is the second
tournament world championship this is
the
third what is this
for oh yeah it does a double there and
then then it for like that so basically
switch the last two for some
reason
uh there you go here's the track
Creator you have
Moto
wait I see you either have dirt bike or
motor bike and then you have and you can
use them in all theme except the first
one which is
changes test your track add
mounts track remove feels like the
options are a bit in the wrong order
here add control Point move a control
point you
select that and then you hold that
button and then you and then it
complains
that and then you have to
start
and then we will start on the way over
here here we go
perfect does it give me like the
coordinates
[Music]
for you got such such an equity
there you go that
wased that by the
game I don't me what I'm
doing suddenly that point over there is
fine when I did
[Music]
that wait rotate oh I did rotate the
map
LIF oh this is zoom
okay
I'm Miss missing
around fix it so stops
flashing the whole track is flashing
him help me the drag is
flashing going to
[Music]
explode come on that there you go that's
a looks like you're making a
crown I don't know what I'm making
it show me which seconds has
problem imagine if didn't show it and
like there is a problem on the
map that would mean
something pleas you can kind of move
this kind of you want do find it
interesting
that some of these are fine
this is too tight but I created too
many no that was fine
okay but so apparently can't create them
because they
are too many of
them too too
narrow too
f
here we go no and then I moved it anyway
the wrong way I'm
sing I want this road to be as straight
as
possible that's what I'm doing
there yeah they're flashing
quickly
it's very very very
picky
ah right will never be
happy come on what is this there we go
finally why is problem with that now
there you
go
well I don't think this looks like a
crown that might be
me there we go now it's happy but it's
not
happy L me to create this interesting
that oh that was a delete button I
didn't mean to deleted and now I'm not
allowed to create
One S I know there's no undo
Buton you have to commit to every option
everything you
do H yeah I guess creating a map isn't
the most exciting thing to look
get especially when it takes such time
cuz it's so
picky thought was like a button I could
press on like please move this like find
a location for it where it's where it's
okay to have it
in and
then and then ask me if that location is
good
okay don't
no okay if I move it
up then I'm allowed to create
one so I
can try to make this
corner it's never it never
approves
which never
[Music]
up and there's also no music
in have a music in
that's wrong one
I don't know what the maximum amount of
points
is hopefully it tells
me there we go
now look like trying to get it cross no
I'm just I'm just trying to find a way
to make it stop
flashing it really needs to have a have
a one that says that
these are too close to each other
because that's also things not not
allows you
have if because currently has a warning
for
something there you go whoa there's one
more function I'm not used
yet is this function but
again it's still picky but at least it's
easier to
manage okay that I don't care but long
[Music]
as fin
[Music]
whoa the sound of
[Music]
disappointment at least
like allows you to move it in a way that
is not
allowed which sounded like a statement
that I L you to move it in a way that is
allow but
like it could have just let like have a
cap for all this stuff maximum height I
wanted it to go
higher
okay adding some animation for
so the m is
play
and come on how how much time am I lift
it what we still still fun if I could
like
other like move it until it complains
just before it
complains it does complain on both sides
which one should it consider wait until
it only complains on one side I guess
there there perfect
beautiful save
it they want to keep the modified track
keep new
track what is the track's
name
I guess it will
be
would be much easier if they had an on
screen
keyboard ESP this game should definitely
like day night clear Range s n yes n no
no
W
uh this should
be how add
Mounds uh but it's not going to allow me
today on these
parts for some reason it
does
interesting
interesting
well 3 and A2 me
L generation oh yeah
yeah so you can oh you can randomiz
it it's the
uh well there we go let's try in
case
3.5
Kil he oh he zero
Meers there we go that's the E for Red
Dragon welcome red dragon I mean you've
been here before but welcome again I'm
going to test a new track that I made my
own which is the princess track princess
music I have to in this track now those
checkpoint positions are kind of weird
but this this wa w
w what a
track we made
this oh this yeah this is perfect place
to have an nrow section
on
all let me first face oh big city
here very big
[Music]
sticky W narrow
narrow another narrow this is not the
place to have Nar on this is the Speedy
section this is Straight Ahead Full
Speed
Ahead
then uphill to reduce your
speed not get full speed into the wall
look I'm great at this
pack I mean it's very first time I play
this P I mean I'm spent a lot of time
into making it but that doesn't mean I'm
good at
it this section is very wly I wonder
why there's an narrow section here
for away
[Music]
what you
do I
[Music]
see ow I crashed I
[Music]
crashed on the crown
it's not it's not this it does not look
like a crown but someone said it looks
like a
crown more specifically ask me if I'm
trying to make
Crown so that's the name of it now
related to set come come on that's not
that
crash let's take
out come on how is that a crash I'm so
far ahead of the other Racers it doesn't
matter oh
no pink one is the yellow one is
coming to get
me such a terrible lap that
[Music]
was
F now
[Music]
section I wonder if anyone tried to the
origal trck the seems AR
really
[Music]
bad oh that's
[Music]
righted
fact there's no Chinese
[Music]
one
who well I
won all right it's
the it's not a
tournament press the wrong button you
can if you win the race you can race
again and again and again
whatever
what
oh yeah they have separate try left like
this condition
Sunny yeah I can set the conditions
clear I it
non
four no n
yeah yeah that's that's that's that
basically that's that's the extension of
the
entory I don't think it's too exciting I
sure like
should yeah now it complains that it's
ins but it should
still be possible to make them
intersect
yeah you can have it intersect that much
before it
complains which pretty good I
think
so I mean the amount that inter which is
a good
amount
so so we just U
oh too
much wait no now
complains
[Music]
Ms about
everything every single thing it can
complain about
got hi that it doesn't change
anything why does it keep complaining
what have I done to you deserve this
[Music]
complaining yeah look it's intersecting
so much no not buy anything really
but I think I can do it
[Music]
more wa wa welcome Miss messing around
with editor see what see how much I can
be
it you can make
Pacman abing the editor
p p hey nice s
byebye you can not make it in
anymore
that right yeah when I created those now
start complains that it's intersecting
again they really should allow it to
intersect it but I requir more
programming
wait
make
it say quite a lot
now but the cor is no no it's start
complain um if I only could make it not
complain about
this oh there there you go
perfect now I just need
to make this section not
complain
oh come on I fix
it I fixed
you
perfect now
this it's always
one never happy always
complaining so pecky there we go finally
I did
it I'm made a stupid
track it's new track I can't bother look
it looks like
it's
well I wonder what the Bas is the number
T what is nonone let's do non
condition so this is the intersecting
track but it's not going to be very
interesting because you not going to see
it
inter I really wish it was like a brid
or
something
[Music]
yeah let see if there's any like yeah
it's taking here
but but it's only generated one part of
fact it's not like you can see but the
question is can you see the other races
or are the only generating Racers based
on distance on
track well I guess I should check
[Music]
that so otherway not a super interesting
T
white change
[Music]
the and yeah and on this side it's
forest or something why is
my makes no
sense hey
[Music]
snar into
[Music]
town and when you do Motocross spikes it
allows you to do
more
stream slopes and B and stuff okay let's
see I can oh you made a shet F this a
shet shet shet he does not
make so if I were
to stop
[Music]
here y y y yaha
yeah you don't see
them it will be fun though yeah it
generates everything based on distance
and
ignores everything that's just too far
[Music]
away I still do it even though I wasted
so much time standing day because you do
have the
time
[Music]
and I don't know if to do m r one R
regarding
timing where if the timer runs out you
still have if you can no longer
accelerate but as long as you cross
another take
point you get you get your
time that expect to show what the timer
is because I
mean I mean sure if the timer RS out you
going to lose the race but cuz you're
too slow you lost the
race again continue race you should be
like start
over disappointed bunnies yeah am I such
a
disappointment I'm
sorry
h uh let
me let me just double check what cheat
codes are for this H game just
[Music]
see that's
what's what's ulate
[Music]
race
[Music]
interesting wait let me
see
H yes I don't even know what that
is it only says like unlock ultimate
mode but it doesn't really tell me what
it is ultimate race I meant ultimate
mode because I mean I'm UNL everything I
think I mean I can't test
to and
[Music]
and then there's the bonus
track but nothing seems to work it
doesn't seem to do
anything maybe it's just like these that
are the bonus tracks or something
think the she aren't even
working all well I guess that's
everything I don't know what else
today I think I looked at everything
there to look
at and I feel like I have completed this
game to
100% save I mean I already saved after
doing the but I guess it will save the
tracks
yes Save track princess and track new
track sound like a good
idea so those those contined without me
pressing yay the tracks are
saved
so Championship now I don't have it yeah
because itess every time you do it so
yeah I got got every go for this
including custom Championship on the two
original tracks I'm not going to do it
again so I think 100% done with this
game another game done that will be mot
racer World Tour next
week oops
stting
though are you are you proud of
me
well that was fun it was fun it was I
mean I I appreciate that game wasn't
like overly long or anything like that
could spend like 4 hours and 38 minutes
on the game
but it's not like return
fire but at least I'm like having fun
playing return fire on like like what
say it's fun to
play but I wouldn't say it's as fun to
play as fire so I think that's a good
amount of gameplay they have in the
game so there's
that
so uh okay Matt is doing a 24-hour
birthday sabon I don't think I've raed
okay mat
before I win the entire stream yes to be
fair I did play one lever the entire
stream of crash bash
2 or I should say as well because she's
not the crash B they should make one
yeah I think okay Matt could be a good
great taret because I don't think I
because he streams early my time so he's
often offline when it's when I it's my
time to rain I think this is a good
opportunity to R him at least
once as because as I said i' like to ra
people at least
once M racing one 100% comple I yeah
expire 100% completion
too including bonus Roxy L welcome did
you was you her
before thanks for stream thank you for
everyone being here

uh let's
celebrate okay birthday

don't know if you have it by way any
triple P Pon is okay keep forgetting
