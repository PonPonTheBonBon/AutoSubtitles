Mr P okay let's see if the game shows up
he does look at that
what is version 1.1.13 last time
I didn't see it's been nothing
wouldn't that be nice
[Music]
and safe
was
[Music]
oh yeah
of course it doesn't why would it allow
me to move
[Music]
[Music]
okay me and the game is messing with me
at the moment I can't remember doing
though it's just put the window outside
the living room
as it wanted to
yeah the game has some issues
but she wishes
explainable I think
apparently on this community
[Music]
but I will continue
and hopefully the game should run
slightly better this time
I learned wrong
actually let's do this
let's do these for interior viewers
the lowest amount of years is so far
I'll see it is running smoothly yeah
kinda
in the water is the one that causes I
wish I could disable the water of it
because it's only like
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
outside the windows
this book create a bridge
almost
I didn't want to go that close oh there
you go
[Music]
good job
we don't get serious
that's a secret
checkpoint
and you can go yeah I see us there's
another checkpoint there too
I guess you can take first pass
you are supposed to be able to go
downstairs as far as I know
thank you
all right you just have to be careful I
guess oh these Stars don't like
no
secret area
I was gonna Force this is maybe this was
the internet
the fish to survive that right
to get out of here the game is
definitely running smoothly this time
last night
[Music]
right here
[Music]
it still has
moments of
no diamonds but
it's definitely never okay
well
there's been on top here
oh
okay
[Music]
Let's Escape
you can inflate too no it's an automatic
closing or it makes sense
[Music]
ah I watch it welcome
3T right if you want it and or just let
it
go right here okay careful now I don't
know if this helps but I'll try
and see that was intentional
[Music]
you can inflate to run away that's neat
I feel supposed to roll their headsets
okay see I see
I can see if I should do that again
[Music]
okay I'm not trying
you're good enough
that's the Deep sound of a checkpoint
come on
let's find some of the checkpoint
[Music]
yeah it is
like fish
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
the fish died
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
let's continue
a lot of
at least it's yeah I think it's
Australian smoothie because it's not a
big separated
that's it big city customers
producer
call it stream
national news I don't actually have to
move forward
[Music]
doesn't sound on its own
[Music]
yeah because there's a water first
that's why
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
that's the life of a fish
yeah that was a very long run
which was almost suffocating
this kid now
foreign
quite a good time I guess there was five
stars
[Music]
so not moving at level two
[Music]
continued Fish Adventure
this doesn't look like the place I
haven't won before
picture
let's continue
and puff up children across
okay
my tongue get tangled in that
around back in the water
[Music]
yeah I don't think you can just fly on
it
[Music]
I'm guessing I'm trying it but
yeah it was kind of slow so I guess
you can get through if you have speed
[Music]
like that you can smell bad
so if it's too much
okay
[Music]
that's
almost the limit
foreign
[Music]
goes well
my phone is back in the morning
[Music]
there's a hard technically now check
that everything is probably working but
as far as I can see it is working so
that's good
thank you
again
[Music]
hmm
[Music]
and I'm
I don't know
[Music]
I suppose you're supposed to go there
but
[Music]
because this is too bright
[Music]
hmm
questions
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
welcome
[Music]
it is it is fish
small fish
other fish I think it's called
[Music]
and the fish is swimming around in this
Lake
now because exploring the area
oh this is
pushing you by kit
do I get past this
yeah I can but there's nothing here in
the way so hello there
I want it fish
peace peace it's expensive and this is
good
fish
yeah I don't think I remember to get up
here
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
maybe it's not
maybe it's not that complicated maybe
they can make it
[Applause]
yeah I
maybe maybe this personalities
[Music]
jump jump no don't die
you survive
okay so your skin is kind of lagging it
is okay well
[Music]
yeah it is lagging because this computer
is not powerful enough to run the game
only smooth is it is this stream
because I can't see this stream
when I'm playing a game because the game
is covering the Stream
I actually don't know how it looks on
stream
yeah
because it is lagging for me too so it
could just be
okay
[Music]
what do you mean that twitch is
buffering
and that's
because
I don't know
I could like reduce the quality I guess
so it doesn't broadcast as much
[Music]
maybe that will help
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
now this game isn't
running very well on this computer
I am but it was it was gifted to me
so I can uh
might see myself to play it for that
reason
makes sense
[Music]
oh I see I see yeah I'm discovering new
scenes
looking back at the street stream yeah
just this thing is lagging more than the
game itself
the game is still latching so
it's the best I can do
[Music]
okay
um yeah
[Music]
I don't know
so yeah
it is what it is
I wish I could do something about it
don't really have the economy to buy a
new computer or anything
[Music]
I'll find that for anything as this
is not going to happen anytime soon
[Music]
maybe I'm not supposed to drive from
that maybe I should ask somebody
[Music]
[Applause]
come on this feels I still feel like
it's upstairs
hurry hurry we must down into the weapon
uh
[Applause]
we fished in my feet
okay
[Music]
that's the time we come from inflation
[Music]
oh so close so close but yeah
which does run smoothly as far as I can
tell especially when I stream from my
PlayStation has enough case the computer
doesn't have remedy
in that case the game runs the stream is
as far as I can download
I think computer is quite old
but it's all I have
[Music]
died in the air that's something you're
missing here
[Music]
like if I did that stand by you
[Music]
yeah they worked
delicious something I must die and it's
attention
what about that fish
is
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
if I hit the net
[Music]
you're probably not eat that that's
absolutely get stuck if I delete it
I was hoping there was a hole in the
bottom of it now
it's not actually that's
that would be best
this is checkpoints there's no
I can
I don't think that's a physics works but
sure
[Music]
I'll take it don't mind the fish
clipping through the bottle
hmm
I mean a glass bottle what must be was
it supposed to be
completely
[Music]
Miss
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I mean I haven't seen any
Eagles
trying to open balance maybe they're
good at it
[Music]
maybe you can pick it up and do
something
[Music]
[Music]
okay
now you can see me
[Music]
hello
and a bunch of rocks
[Music]
hmm
[Music]
yeah it can't fit under
30 seconds then
there's no place for a fish
seagulls can at this moment of fish
that existence about just a minute
I think try not to go up there
foreign
[Music]
okay
[Music]
thank you
still doesn't give me up
[Music]
right now
yeah
this wrong place
[Music]
if there's something there
okay so I was kind of right with the
difference really
give it to me when I'm in power because
I won't break it after Worldcraft
thank you
do you need to get up here do I need to
use a seagull face trick
fish
the wrong way wrong way
let's push me after this
that was a completely
it's close
okay
now it's very
out of seven
yeah I don't see him being possible to
kill anyone else
another place I'm stuck it
[Music]
before
thank you
I'm a little cut yes but I'll see
because I don't sing anything yet
I mean
the puzzle is hard enough with these
signals it's really strictest thing of
trying to be that point here
you can see myself because I was there
before
foreign
[Music]
not find me
I'm just a fish in a bottle
[Music]
you just started fall down here
well someone left this one out and it's
gone
the fish is strong you can move the
whole thing
okay
didn't really make it
there we go
now
it let's go for a ride
along with the frame rate
um
yeah
I fell down here
[Music]
let's just continue across the beach oh
it's like
London already
no
why did he did that
another way to get to checkpoint today
hopefully it's not here
oh well
maybe I should post this jumps through
the window
thank you
well that wasn't the trick
they machine into that maybe I should
just do all this
foreign
than the one who can hit
okay I wasn't supposed to get in here I
see him
there we go finally
no
[Music]
okay
um
I assume you're supposed to get down
it's broke
immediately
[Music]
when it's larger
you can't do that to make it like a jump
or something
[Music]
nope
[Music]
that doesn't make it your body
okay second
well I guess I had to take another box
around
[Music]
there are many ways around this area
[Music]
thank you
if that boost come from
today where I'm going to go this way
anyway so
oh this is like an abandoned pump or
something
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
what
[Music]
you're being careful
[Music]
and move
[Music]
that I think I'm a back immediately so I
should not move on to those plants
because those plants apparently explodes
[Music]
hello neighbor nice to see you
alert
and yeah
the butt is not responding
[Music]
Ellen what
what
I don't have a little screen that's
already
I do have these I guess
that worked
riding in the airport
and strange
I guess I actually look into that one
foreign
[Music]
honestly it's like I'm able to kill time
there
[Music]
see those planks
[Music]
[Music]
did find
let's continue
of more bread
how to fish which is this bread
but it brought you
I'm sorry
[Music]
out
I'm gonna find everything
[Music]
now I can't go there
oh what is this Speed come from wow
all of a sudden
[Music]
random speed boost
[Music]
oops
oops
[Music]
for that
I'm careful Alice
[Music]
and goodness
[Music]
[Music]
that's something being important
does that mean that it's not important
[Music]
what's important is something you can
ignore
[Music]
[Music]
it is important to watch out for these
symptoms because they haven't given up
okay now
into the park by I mean Ireland into
Desiring
yeah no this isn't Sunny yet this is
like the working area
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I was close
oh it's not
that doesn't work in shallow water
all right man
this watch is my channel
thank you
I don't want to bet
hello
[Music]
okay
good afternoon
funny
that you can't
[Music]
maybe I had to go
[Music]
to
I get to create another time
let's hear TV series
[Music]
music is back
we're back on track
I guess we're always attracted
we're playing this game in first person
[Music]
to be stuck on their eyes
[Music]
here as he approaches the
does it swim okay
sounds
Happy Fish as I approached the city such
like more it would like a fish you have
a body
hello
do you want to be my friend
mutant
[Music]
hello fish do you want to see a trick
[Music]
look at me I can do this
they look stupid
[Music]
they must be these some intelligent fish
[Music]
we look a bit
just out here
to eat it
a boy
all right
[Music]
this line doesn't break
it
[Applause]
got a little fighter snap a line
[Music]
[Music]
interesting and it didn't hurt
this puffer fish and on
something that it would have hurt
yes posting a path there actually
maybe I should time
[Music]
I don't care about these fish
[Music]
this is
[Music]
[Music]
very bad seats dude
all right
well that was fine okay I see I see
practicing my aim
contacting
this solid
[Music]
um
[Music]
all right see the price of that
baby
there you go you've got a fish in the
face and it doesn't even care
I'm not strange person
[Music]
unless I'm supposed to be but
[Music]
be something no
[Music]
put into
um
it wouldn't make sense for you to be
able to escape and it's not really the
most obvious
made the program
[Music]
yeah I don't see
anything
I want to explore
[Music]
the landscape doesn't let me
[Music]
want to be a free fish
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
tricky
[Music]
[Music]
Northeast 9 19 yeah
let's get starts and we put in the
bucket
[Music]
a bite
foreign
[Music]
doesn't break
come on almost there
I want a challenge that was too easy
man
[Music]
here again yeah
[Music]
we got a live one
[Applause]
bit of a fighter here
[Music]
just a bit more
just a bit more
[Applause]
just a bit more
foreign
[Music]
you're a bit of a fighter for such a
small fish a fancy one too all right
you'll be worth a few quid
let's put you in here time to find a
buyer for you
that wants to wait it's
a weird way to progress but sure
you can't sell the fish
[Music]
a hydrate
look at these stars and keep on
except that person is
but I guess that's the first thing
and I'll try to clean
what
many people
I need to get out of here these people
are needed
oh I'm stuck
fortnight
which has sleep
since I can't jump out
this is even like a kid's playing this
can jump out like that
well maybe I can get to those drinks or
something
foreign
[Music]
if you don't mind
to do something about that
why is this
[Music]
thank you
see me
this one
this one sheet of material from in the
ceiling made up the scene
wait why is it so incredibly laggy now
don't have
anything
[Music]
here we go
yeah and I don't know why it's so
incredible like our sudden so we didn't
decided to do something about him up or
something
it's coming on
and see anything strange
I don't know what's going on
it's
I didn't select that
okay
I did not select that
thank you
thank you for letting me play the game
thank you
this time I should try tonight
there you go
and why did you do that more
you know the floor is always
I mean I'm still in the frame
it
nothing
you know
[Music]
this person here we go
so I'm supposed to come downstairs to
these things
[Music]
up we're not playing rainy winds
[Music]
with Eric that he blanching fan of
descending
here that's because
as soon as I get out of here
flagships
[Music]
it's me
it's either caution inside
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
I guess it's the same
company
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
okay so I'm in the glass
[Music]
this makes not much sense
oh very strongly
foreign
[Music]
again
that
doing that
I think I'm on the right track though
anyway
but this one
maybe I can do that now
foreign
that's the problem
s
okay A bit stuck here
just jump down on the floor
explore
this is
if you don't mind this
is so happy
foreign
I have an idea
yep
yes
that was something
um
things I keep pressing the wrong button
they really should do that because
I can't logistic I promise okay
episode
can I set this to
no
no
we can change it
to this button
that way
now
I can no longer press that button
accidentally
commit to restart
I have that in third oh yeah and then
he wants bouncy
secretary
okay making progress
[Music]
and figure this out
um
I figurative
yeah I really need to meet this week
there we go
why did he inflate honestly
because now I had to restart my left
hand instead of going right I think
that's
that's
the same plated
okay so you uninflates when you
want to hit it correctly
all right now if you get
I didn't I didn't expect I was going to
hit this one
why'd you fly so far
yes
foreign
[Music]
remember that
to be honest I haven't even drop the
glass on carpets so
but but I know it could be true but
let's see if I can break
through to the other side
go through this thing
yeah I needed
is
at least the game had kind of
shown me that those can open
so I had something to go on
before that
but like other times thinking when you
don't really show you stuff
[Music]
so now I'm up here
I'm also stuck
[Music]
oh yeah I see this one is actually
connected
yeah
there you go
[Music]
look at all these silly people
from there
I pay down this
foreign
[Music]
if I was out walking and I found a
bouncing friends
[Music]
no she's from the sky
maybe I should come and see some friends
what did that just broke the glass
[Music]
the seconds
[Music]
[Music]
pretty much
[Music]
I did it before now it's something
[Music]
[Music]
yeah let's see
okay
that's love
[Music]
it's a sign
okay I think there's a man
that's in that direction so I assume
you're supposed
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
let's see if I can do
[Music]
[Music]
it
Okay
the reason these people
[Music]
emotion point
what are my options
[Music]
I guess this is my only option
[Music]
I go here in this uh
[Music]
[Music]
did you find
that's how you did
actually
I am supposed to find this yeah I do
think that is here
[Music]
um
because that's my feedback please
one and a half year old game yeah
because you still have the option of
scooping the forensic points and the
skills in the next checkpoint if you
really really want that three points so
having a Highlands
and
[Music]
and
[Music]
[Music]
what this game comes with this normal
camera controls this one
and then Aspire continues to invert the
camera performance
[Music]
now since there's no consensus of what
normal I mean nothing
is really
[Music]
recommendation
[Music]
from the teachers
[Music]
[Music]
what baby bye bye
and I don't mind lag
that's
how it is in this area due to the high
density of humans
sorry
I think I'm supposed to get through that
somewhere else
[Music]
we're doing a timing challenge with no
frame rates
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
this one
yeah you want a fitting outfit yeah
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay
[Music]
um
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
okay
you were going to show up
really where I'm supposed to go
for two hours
foreign
[Music]
here
[Music]
[Music]
can't follow them around
[Music]
don't worry
uh
[Music]
nothing so far
[Music]
maybe it's something like
it was a topic of the conversation
yesterday
supposed to know that okay
[Music]
even if it doesn't seem to be able to
jump up the stand anyway
[Music]
but yeah I was asking Papa where you
were and then you showed up
way too much I can do another level
I might be able to do that
I will complete this game 100 slot
probably because it seems to be a rather
short game
it's not like super short too bad you
can't
thank you for watching
that clock seems to be broken
fish
food take it with you
[Music]
okay let's continue
[Music]
they're moving online or something
the kind of like the uh
[Music]
okay that seems are coming in
one computer
like the perfect fish but worries
[Music]
like
all right
let's semester
no I am actually okay
something right below this thing okay
this is it got a quick game all the time
let's get it
um
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and grab it
[Music]
[Music]
all right
that's a stunt fish okay
if you're smoking really nice if he's
now aligned with with
[Music]
um
look at this
right closer
[Music]
keep it out there
[Music]
keep it open
peace
[Music]
that's another morning
that's how beautiful no one is sneaky
this doesn't excite
ment so it's okay I was thinking about
in the plugs I'm gonna try and screaming
[Music]
that was what I saw the first person and
I saw me
yeah
the positive strange
okay I need to find something
it's happening yes
[Music]
come on
I think it's clippings
very smart
you never know with this game
[Music]
I think let's go some more pipes
[Music]
okay now now I started watching
now it's a bit dangerous
that was a chance to swim through those
pipes
what can I reach now
um
[Music]
okay
[Music]
[Music]
yeah the worst proceed with this game is
that the
lag affects the physics so the jumps are
terrible if it starts lagging which is
something because it's possible
it's like that might be disclosure that
line see what they need to do to teach
you the line I can't do it
since this is something High Enough
but I don't know
[Music]
ah tonic do you want some tonic
[Music]
ass
probably treat the breaker
I would hope so
they came up with him
[Music]
[Music]
yeah they're going to have some watch
damage
red heavy are you in this handle
because
[Music]
as We Know
on the inside
because as We Know
piranhas want to eat red stuff
okay
not sure yet
how this works really because
you turn the water out
yeah why would you want to turn the
water off one of these pipes
how often anything
okay I guess I guess I'll find something
otherwise
[Music]
okay
let's break something
foreign
thank you
it must be this way then
[Music]
well isn't this kind of lucky
the house is except the one that was
broken
Maybe
yeah
which side of the road are you driving
on
good to know the house is very tight to
keep water out during your time yeah
that's
that's what they build it for even
though they are very high up on that
hill so they wouldn't really get flooded
in the first place
okay this is very tricky Instagram
[Music]
keep to the right
but
um one of the characters before I did
say used to work twit do they use that
for Australian dollars
what
what instant buses
apparently energy
band
okay
I mean it had like three windows or
something if each window has a seat
cuts
maybe it feels fine
it can be
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
see that was fine
the only color but now we just had
uh personally
I guess it's fine
I'm really happy to hear that one
apparently
it has enough seats it's officially
classified as a bus everyone is too loud
a kid
because he can't can't
replace that
that's
currently draws through that box
[Music]
he can do it I need it
almost
here people are the one who can
surviving because you don't want to keep
watching anymore the only two that
survived
I mean the game
assignments the game is enjoyable
just the life it's too much
I don't really do much about it
it is what it is
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
things could have been better but
okay
absolutely the place is amazing I have
no idea how town
has such a massive nightclub yeah
you've seen those places
thank you
[Music]
across this thing oh no the choice facts
it's holding together quite well
this is like
um
yeah
too much
little person you have fish here
[Music]
we find this thing uh laminated that's
the term
maybe it's like laminated glass
active Perfection whatever I'm not going
to be able to see yet
it's a regular like Captain tape or it's
got office tape and that's why they take
what you see through
thank you
oh no no
I can't believe
[Music]
everyone know they mean it's it's not
much but it's on its work I mean I've
seen I don't know where it's from
people don't care what's
all of a sudden something approach some
glass broke in your garden
it's right next to you
should give a bit concerned about it
okay
I did it
finally I did it
yeah the guy in the picture passed away
this week wow
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
quietly contemplate down here
someone is attacking your garden like
Our Moment to quietly contemplate down
here
no don't put that me
hello people
that oh my gosh man The Treehouse
quietly contemplate down here
you got the checkpoint
let's see we're mixed
I've got stuff stuck
no
when the signals impact on this channel
those signals
because
there's a pretty secret reminds me of
this he was from finally
yeah they totally copied that
okay
fine
fine
there are numbers
[Music]
oh
I love that fact
you can't get to the fish
thank you
see this is safely inside the water
should I say jar
thank you
closer to you
yeah
That was supposed to I'm supposed to
take the other car
where the uh
with your friends
especially
pressure inside Russia fish eats you
wait I promise
[Music]
I'm not joking
I am the best to run on this
table
whether it's definitely low enough
[Music]
thank you
yeah but as I said I was just thinking
that's good
and others

how long should it take to open it
so inverting the camera inverse the
camera control inverting the flight
controls inverts the inverted fly
controls in the game

[Music]
okay you know what
it's basically been three hours
I mean no one was here like the first
Tower but that's not my fault to me

basically have to
basically
is it fun a lot of people staying with
yourself favorite but
yeah
I feel satisfied with that
obviously I make a very little process
but yeah
what can I do
which will happen at some point
and of course I will let people know
how the progress with that skills
though
at this very moment
you have a few people
you know what
because I haven't done that yet
Reggie bear
I think that's right that's it did read
me once
and since principal is online
I'm just going
I think it's fatty and straight back
I think even though with two people but
just just to say hi just to say thank
you for
thank you for reading last time
well uh when I said it's uh like Arabian
said it's a long weekend now
uh oh yeah should we take Olivia's
message instead that's a good idea even
though you didn't intend it as a big
message let's let's and let's make that
the rest message
anyway
uh it's a long weekend now so now you're
probably going to have time
it's to see me struggle through the year
the game tomorrow same times according
to the schedule as you see here
still haven't added New Zealand and I I
think average your time here I think I
have an idea how I should expand the
schedule I would make another schedule a
separate which will contain basically
Africa because they do like Europe it is
time since and and uh New Zealand like
I think I have one person from Africa
watches at least once
but that's my idea anyway
and during this beginning
