I don't know
well I don't know what's going on at the
moment it's all Chichi it says that I'm
offline
but
if I go to my page on stream it's
clearly states
the first list of the Arts yeah
the twitch says US states that I'm
online but they twitch
as
as dream
manager page see says that I'm offline
it says that I have zero viewers at the
moment
[Music]
I'm gonna do
on the
[Music]
even though I can't
it says I've only been staying for 30
seconds according to Twitch
what a mess at the moment yeah I was
going to
take a bus and break and before the
stream started
and that didn't happen because of all
these technical issues yeah I have to
use that now
so I will be
back in a short moment
when I find the
[Music]
sorry okay okay
well I'm certainly not streaming from
my phone
now it says two years but this position
since I'm offline
a nurses
I'm online I went
picking up in the drawings working list
so now I will draw
a kitten
kitten has a cute answer cat I didn't
decide how big you should be we can we
can measure that like
you can you can decide to consider what
size it would be
like I assume you would be like small or
something so
meow
so I will take my bathroom break and
then I will be back
hopefully it actually placed their hair
this time
it's uh
you know so you can
this one is cute
thank you
foreign
foreign
thank you
I lost Mike
Holly's kid how big are you
[Music]
me yes I was talking to you
the ads should be away
so now
you can see it again
did I add seconds
to the Clark unicorner
everything that's necessary so
it was from there but
[Music]
in heaven second human with the music
playing
smiles
[Music]
that's why I picked out music because I
like it
and I hope you like it
it's different music
like every other song should be
different
something
thank you
[Music]
seems in the rain
though
let me fetch the
[Music]
reference images that
[Music]
I was going to use
this this one
let's give an idea
let's see how many streams methods gave
it one two three
yep that's ugly [ __ ] has been
and it didn't really generate the
thumbnail
[Music]
[Music]
with that one so anyway back to you
all right oh I see
oh wait what is this
starting off yes I see and how was the
question thinking uh it's the uh how big
are you what's the question what's the
actual question I asked you
you're free to interpret that question
however you want but
there's only one interpretation I'm not
this is not a family friendly thing
okay
let me go
that I would add
Shadow wolves
is the name for that one
and this could be kitten
they're right eating free tasty
to be short
[Music]
I guess half the size of a lot of money
I guess that's a good size
of this size
water bunny is that size kind of
like that size
[Music]
off that size
would be
[Music]
that size I guess it would be a kid size
a fun size kitten
[Music]
we can always change the scale
I mean it just changing the signs of
that one
[Music]
the whole thing afterwards and then
we'll see if it should be not to
responded but anyway I have not today my
time and drinking I agree with everyone
yet
and because it's been around
disconnecting and connecting so
I did say I did see a message from
origin and water bunny they are gone now
because it's lost the connection here
and kitten has been acting here hello
kitten
and
Alexandra
Alexandra Gabriel I'm still here that's
good that's good
hello hello

now
[Music]

remodeling my bathroom oh

I have
a nice
an important
oh you got it like you wanted it
that's nice I need to clean my house
yeah I need to clean my house too
many reasons
how many
thick Heat
I did need some
additional expression for like
thank you
learning it starts on the
chat display up there it says where the
channel is which I think is a nice box
or something I don't know
because the current time it could also
give the the amount of time I've been
streaming for
dancing heavy changes just the color and
a bit of my setup like
the bed is in still still in the same
position
um
chat
chest by the way it was good
I don't know English has made terms
rice being Swedish
and that's
well everyone might not know that
actually you might see any people coming
in here I have no idea Mr Swedish and
can speak Swedish
[Music]
I mean
most most
sweets can speak Swedish
common
fancy things it's so cute
considering the year
is the national language you know
and the end like
ears in some way
do you want to think
yes
but not like too big but Nike
boots there
cute
Maybe
everything's a big thing
[Music]
[Music]
you can have something
it's actually useful if she has
something unique here
your character
[Music]
laughs
[Music]
even have obtain
as far as I know each
it gets down
when the cat is scanned
yes I think
of course I think
there we go
I'm like a bit more here
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
changes
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
whatever the key message
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
guess what
what
[Music]
I got the haircut
that's neat
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
spelling
spending can be crazy sometimes
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
decisions like
this
[Music]
and I'm not going to see it
[Music]
crazy
like this
perfect
at least that must mean a little bit
[Music]
[Music]
I want to try to pronounce that as
all right words like this
finish
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
it's still understandable
because
foreign
[Music]
travels for sure
I don't have it myself but
[Music]
I know someone has it and to be fair
they are sitting better than ideas I
mean not spending my secrets but
life-wise
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
feds
I think it's something I have trouble
with yeah
and kitten
has been writing funny things sometimes
where there is textile such
[Music]
that is understandable it's not
the easiest thing to
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
let's see how it goes
and transforming this into more detail
sketch
and then we'll see if there's any
changes needed
we were doing bad at the right thing I
was telling you to write something in
real nice for someone special
oh yeah
[Music]
[Music]
I hope that someone special liked it
foreign
[Music]
character yes
of course
everyone should join the
the wolves attack
I don't know why I came up with that
idea but
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
we can have some characters being
aggressive someone being defensive
[Music]
the main sketch
instead everything and thinking yeah
exist and it changes you want
[Music]
to let me know
[Music]
[Music]
okay
[Music]
this game I made serious character
players in Italian imagine you in
English
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
Swedish so
like these different errors in Swedish
and in English
it happened
but this is really errors
just your version of language
to personal dialect
I've got dark tags
deducts are taxing
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
tax
are the same
how you mean
I certainly referring to something
called the duck packs
but
that's
it wouldn't make sense in the plural I
think unless you have like mute s
if you try to write ducks I could see
it's become attacks
[Music]
no sun is the same
[Music]
in English they would be different but I
understand English
do you like Italian pronunciation of the
another one
you can see what you mean I think
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I'm gonna be nice and just copy this
it's just the sketching face
I've said that but why not I don't like
the copy lines but
the sketching place
let's do
keep things more
nicely looking a little pink
[Music]
[Music]
and kitten feet tonight yep
[Music]
they are pretty nice
[Music]
and then we take the proportions
something too that that might need
changing
[Music]
13
.
[Music]
in Italian I had to write to you
at least I
foreign
I don't actually know Italian
orthographies I can't read these words
because
I before after she makes it the
okay see
and double early studies in Italian does
now it's just Panda okay so
Melissa jog up Apollo
translate in English
Elisa
Lisa
I want to show you what happens if I
write in English and I hear about it I
mean what does that even mean
any supplies ball
and if I take the other one and change
it to con instead
and it's a place which one
okay I mean
they are very very similar okay yeah
yeah now now if I
[Music]
English doesn't really make a difference
there
you can say play spawn and place with
them oh
so I could see that the distinction
being lost if you translate back to the
name
sometimes that happens
it's a race week pounds okay that's I
like what foreign
[Music]
in the was it Final Fantasy but they
have like a bunny species maybe it's
working for the predator and the bunnies
the bunnies are quite tall
and I originally said that when I do
find
like shorter to be cuter than bunnies to
be cute the short bunnies are very cute
but to be fair I am in real life really
tall
I mean
where a woman I guess because I am
180
and average here in Sweden for women is
135 at least less than seven thousand
look at it short you know Towers over
there
so the average for men is like 175
probably
and then my brother
foreign
so
it's my meeting you were shocked by the
garage canaries
I mean
there are no games I think
Elsa plays with balls
I mean grammatically it's fine
normally you probably would say I'll
accept Lanes ball because otherwise
I don't know if it's Priceless you can't
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
to do
perfect at least I don't feel alone
I sometimes I do grammatical errors in
English it's usually because I'm using
here the grammars of Swedish so for
certain princes
[Music]
and it sounds silly
oh thanks I don't know which sometimes I
notice it myself because wait a minute
that doesn't sound right but sometimes I
might say something and I don't notice
that it's our way of saying it but no
one's saying anything in chat so it's
fine okay
I'm really bad at the camera stuff
and spelling
[Music]
and homophones
every time you write your end to
than using the wrong spellings
but
when they say something I guess
[Music]
I'm going to eat see you next time thank
you for stopping by that's fun Japanese
but language that's my area I have some
nice feet
okay let's not talk about food
I'm gonna
[Music]
voluntarily involuntarily
and dieting at the moment
[Music]
and that doesn't make me crazy but
I have my reasons actually
[Music]
how do I do good care yes
of a cat organic healthy and eerie
should not be in
[Music]
[Music]
yes and during the I'm doing this
drawing for him for free but
if you want like a model
kitten I'm willing to like draw this
character anymore
usable ability
for this for his dreams unless you want
to be a scare now I like
I would preferring you not like just
going and using it yourself
because the drawings made for this turn
[Music]
but yeah I'm willing to
make a different drawing
to be used as a model
you can use
but I said you can see how this turns
out as well as making
upgrade ideas for what to change
Miss
yes
and then
so I was thinking that
this chat would be
like naked I guess it's way different
but
you can always cosplay as different kind
of things
[Music]
[Music]
okay I understand now
it's
[Music]
naked in a non-lit way
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
big and beautiful eyes

thank you
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
no more water only water
he's still in the picture
drawing
it's what I'm trying to say
the [ __ ] the handsome Bunny and now I'm
drawing a cute kitten
foreign
and more characters might appear
though now that I have prepared it with
more Waters I don't run out let's
actually start on the
[Music]
and outlines
[Music]
it's a bit of a fiery question
[Music]
all right
you can see the colors are already
although not all kinds like eye color
that's that's
that needs to be decided for as well
[Music]
[Music]
all right
okay everything about the colors yeah I
got like
there
okay yeah there was one what they said
the character was supposed to have
the uh electric cloth I guess
if you want that
you don't need that you don't want that
[Music]
and it
after after you get to see how this
giant lipstick you can always make
changes if you want your own
money
yeah I was thinking like
nothing left inside now but
[Music]
[Music]
it was meant to be like
[Music]
foreign
just look at a few reference between
different design and see if I can come
up with like this one gives me something
interesting ideas
yes it doesn't look like it's
a treat for something right now I'm
still getting okay good
oh
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
like that might be more interesting
[Music]
I'm cute yeah
just been scared negative
you're going to mostly covered up here
so bruh
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
s
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
cute kitty
foreign
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
yes that's what I was getting
I hope you found a good country
[Music]
one that guess when
this hair color
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
to speak for life
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
yes
and done lunch box
a very long
believe me that's a good thing what
maybe I should have alone
I don't know how that will work
there he reached maximum length
too long
I mean it's fine on screen
[Music]
as long as it doesn't break on screen
inside look
okay
what happens if you do one more
thank you
[Music]
universally cloud
[Music]
it shows broken in chat but yeah I can I
mean the first one you sent what's
actually broken
because I have a bit large text
foreign
just to see how it shows up on screen
what fox
[Music]
[Music]
okay I got you
[Music]
I really should fix their own skin shots
that keeps the same size until you
reached the end and then starts
shrinking
because you wouldn't need to shrink by
much to eat one more
did that was too boy that was just not
one way yeah it does shrink it but it
doesn't shake it
[Music]
yeah and I should fix that till a bit
more it's a bit of a message moment
foreign
[Music]
that killed myself and by myself I mean
I copied it from an existing code and
modified it to fit my purpose
so yes
sorry I can't count up anything you
could just copy your own messaging
[Music]
and I guess a mess isn't too strong area
grammar spelling math
science nice
but it doesn't really shrink it even if
you go one too many and then when you
get one more it starts shrinking but the
only slacking
yeah I didn't really count up anything
so
please don't look like shrinking it's
not really sure to do some very good for
that
that leg is shrinking
[Music]
it's the same how I made it currently is
that it's using the same
function
as the text shrink because
explain Spain
bad folks
yeah is using the same shrinking code
for the texture so if you write with
which you probably have seen active
people write longer messages it takes up
here smart on on screen obviously
counterfeit to chat
but
but yeah on screen
really
[Music]
I might try this hold on I'm holding on
for this life
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
all right so here's a random
text from Wikipedia which is 499 charges
[Music]
on screen the text is very small
can I read that now I mean this is his
text message this is a test message
is a test message nothing too important
is a kicking me out the test message is
now always thank you for listening to my
test message
and listening you say
my last student is 33 challenge this
good job
as you can see
are they the same size
my thing seems to be a bit smaller I
don't know
where
but when you basically
that that much taste it
takes less space
by making it like smaller not only can
you fit more on each line
[Music]
like actually it doesn't seem to stream
yeah you probably need
it is readable but it had is that it's a
highest quality
if you said like four foreign
it's just not enough Peak sounds to show
but I am streaming at 7 20.
at about 350
kilometer per second
so
it should be readable Maybe
I didn't know
maybe I should add the market and come
back and check this later
[Music]
please switch mods should set Marcus
[Music]
but I will lay with the
[Music]
but you're free too like if you find the
moment that you want the clip off you
can use please
click click a click button you don't
actually have to make the clip and
because
I will there
but yeah I'll just do Clips other people
have made for my channel and then I
basically remake them
cutting them nicer
because not every clip that people make
all right
that's to a satisfactory quality as
see what I I
plus uh when you make a clip you are
basically kind of the owner of the clip
so you decide if the clip should stay or
removed or something
and that's obviously other good thing is
if I have a channel another challenge
removes all the clips from my channel
because then you are the technical name
you can remake them I am the owner
sure you don't get the credit on Twitch
but I mean
doesn't matter
that's gonna run honest question too it
doesn't matter
[Music]
because most of the time the kids are
playing they're playing like
[Music]
on when I do like raid someone and they
play around the clip in that case it
doesn't credit you made it
foreign
maybe if I
add more of a pen to it
might actually find
I've made a clip in our lives yesterday
it's been a while since yesterday it was
amazing
I think
now it was the day before that it for
the spiral
a stupid tone thing inspired
[Music]
sir yes kitten
included
[Music]
I hope you like that kitten
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
this is and everything
oh no that's the gas in place again
oh
Donuts
yeah if I had that many emails when 30
nights
foreign
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
about me
in the kitchen we are on here to have
similes foreign
like that
that's so cute
[Music]
oops
that wasn't something
[Music]
it didn't turn out to as well as I hoped
but
[Music]
yeah I think the color should just
become
[Music]
the contrast between them needs to be
it's very new
[Music]
when you do this
[Music]
no I'm not kidding it's working let's
see
it was worth it maybe it's light
[Music]
when from the
[Music]
movie
[Music]
because these are acceptance I can
disable it if you don't like it
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
okay now
I should go and fetch those colors that
I
mean the science form previously and
more likely I decided I just want to
show it to you
that's almost over there
I think that it's like body
a Flash and
Tommy maybe wait let's see uh can I
always enthusiastic and I'll Spotify
experiment around
[Music]
finding out my scripts
[Music]
I love that design I'm happy you did
action issues
but sometimes it just doesn't feel good
I think that done it correctly this time
there
perfect
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
when that's there
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
Mouse
[Music]
is this color
it's a cute colors
[Music]
and I guess
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
little kitten
how does this feel to be so small
[Music]
it is
good
[Music]
it's possible to scale the Earth
now you're a big kitten
my skin is done
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
it feels cute
and that is it when it happens first
went okay
especially
I mean yeah this sign is a bit simpler I
guess
and then pour an extra bottle you can
decide if you want any adjustments
[Music]
you need to check kitchen jeans
[Music]
[ __ ] no not me I wouldn't I wouldn't
click
oh
look for a few places hey
so
[Music]
[Music]
done it and then add
this text it just had to be added you
know this is not going to be part of the
you know Finding picture
but
[Music]
funny for the sake of consistency again
[Music]
it feels like I use this one
I can't do that
perfect
[Music]
so who's next
[Music]
[Music]
released one
we expected this picture
I would how would the kitten measure to
you
a lot easier
thank you
because
I'm really
actually I only have one
but like can I have two remotes Lots
left
so one more for subscribers because
not that this specific one I've been
picked up it's out
it is
[Music]
of course
[Music]
that's a better way of saying it's these
would not specifically these but five
are going to be for level remotes
then
next currently
on your subscriber emotes
and
one
is for everyone who currently has
a
or donated foreign
donated a thousand bits or more
[Music]
according to a high school list which is
still active
we have three people
so I can do two more emotes but if I get
I have five more subscriptions in either
gifts or subscriptions
it will unlock one other one more this
will make this one exclusive to beat
those who have spent bits will become
and
a subscriber slots and then another
emote has to be made
[Music]
so that's how it I basically planning
them
attached
and see it's not going to be changed
automatically I could put some other
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
until it seems if I said
[Music]
[Music]
trying to think of what image
but actually thinking for me
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
