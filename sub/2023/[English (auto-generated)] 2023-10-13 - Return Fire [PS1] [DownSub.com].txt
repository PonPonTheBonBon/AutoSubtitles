surprise what all this
then tell
you oh my day is already Dre because my
first sniped well that's that's life Wow
early stamp feed yes it was an early
stamp feed now your day is doubly ruined
isn't it I mean you I had a a one day
streak because you lost the uh lost the
Tuesday first so you didn't have a great
streak you had one before I'll give you
that
buted how many rabbits are in that AED
maybe you should count him good
afternoon P Pon well good uh morning
Papa wolf something I'm just guessing
hydrate yes that sounds like a good
start of the
stream 10 rabbits in the whole stampede
I mean this this actually on the
stream hi
[Music]
Pon hello let's go how do you read this
level name i i yesterday I said strike
n but it could be something like SC or
[Music]
something don't
know
10 rabbits become 20 rabbits 40 becomes
80 rabbit
stamped wait 10 rabbits become 20
because every rabbit because you have
five they get together five
pairs
on I mean it could be four pairs too it
doesn't necessarily and they and every
rabbit has an
average well two B
rabbits because they are in Paris
and making 10 new rabbits becoming
20 and then it becomes awkward when they
become
40 but
anyway let Shall We
Begin with
stret
nine St
nine
that's I mean I could
just I don't know so my my North is in
the base my base in
North s r y c
h that's how you spelled it right
it's apparently a Polish
word
three which means
attic or a line or a streak or course or
a
direction or an archaic meaning for old
man anyway moving
[Music]
on
it is possible that they use the Polish
word and
like but yeah
anyway
so polish
yes in this
level I will uh what will I do it's
quite an annoying level if
[Music]
something what what's the
word
story was it this in the name of yes
weren you
reading oh yeah that
one getting shot at

already getting destroyed so I'm not
doing good job at
it no made a
mistake there we go I got out of there
oh no no should don't shoot me
[Music]

rest of the day which is 24
hours all right you hope I have a good
stream Bonny I'm not
Bonny who's this Bonny you speak of are
you watching H
streamers Andy they're shooting the
trees okay here we
[Music]
go oh shoot the the
tower no no oh come
on
okay that was close
again I need to stop being so
close yeah I need
to get through this way without getting
shot
up why am I going through
here okay that was a bad
decision
that's what I do make bad decisions when
I play this
[Music]
game I do have more helicopter so it's
not a big
loss we just have to try
[Music]
again
[Music]
[Music]
excuse me
I'm oh come
on that was ter okay that that was that
was awful
that was just
awful I need to do
[Music]
better I'm not happy with
that
[Music]
[Music]
there you
go save
it
definitely safe about
[Music]
there
I just need to
make same is so long
to so far away and need to travel so far
to reach
[Music]
it
[Music]
I just wanted to move those cuz they
keep shooting me as I Poss
by but no
I
like no I take too much damage I
couldn't even attack the base in the
first place to distract the my shooting
Towers ah
[Music]
take
one more
try try try try
again go go go
go
second try shoot
me
up can I go around
this there we
go you can do it yeah a lot of running
back and forth
though IO backing
[Music]
forth there is a lot of tower down there
though
and I've shut down a few pieces of walls
not Towers
though I'm Shifting the wrong
things but it's definitely the Easter
now I feel
like
[Music]
can I do another
[Music]
round
I need to get out of here no not the
second
[Music]
round
mono survived so
[Music]
close dangerous close
[Music]
I have a big base doesn't do
anything ah got rid of some of
that I think I wonder if a third round
would would finish it off
cuz now we done two rounds thatr
overdose overd those over
[Music]
those
just passing by don't shoot
me oh
wait there we go yeah there we
[Music]
go
I'm
P not control the helicopter I finally
got rid of all of
that now I don't need to think about
that
anymore is the peaceful hel up there
yep minding my own
business nothing to care
about there we
go
so what's the next area to
attack I think I go
west but there's so many Towers there so
I probably lose the helicopter this time
maybe I should do a quick fly by and
just cuz it might be Clos as I don't
have
to might it is close as
I
no way too
many way way too
[Music]
many I need
[Music]
to
not need to T up not they need in that
case if can't
even any need
the we can approach I
guess something like
this start for sweaty
socks
very sus wait what
sus please tell me what
SS no
land the game is buy
now
I overheard calling me sweaty Sid no
sweaty socks sweaty
socks that's what your name is what this
socks
okay one more
try don't like how that's facing against
me oh no that was a terrible
run okay I might need to
uh approach it from the other
way 6y
socks what no sweaty socks
imagine if they had anti-air gued
missiles oh
my that would be tricky don't Mound it
de
Bate
is that shooting way to
ear I guess it
worked and then a start run should
destroy
them on
then
Anon pun is pretty
sexy if you say so I mean I think pon
pon dressed in sweaty socks would
be would be some something for
sure so what is this game pon pon well
it says it's right there this is return
fire on the PlayStation 1 released in
1995 what more do you want to
know
I think the title is pretty
straightforward oh come on doing my
whole
[Music]
attack now I need to go back and try
again that's not land that's there
it now P pun is wearing a swing
suit I an error in this map apparently
the roads that lead up to the fuel
thingies on the East there don't have
Roads connecting to
them for some
[Music]
reason unless ignore those who planted
mines
[Music]
there
move
out I got R up some
[Music]
towers that should help
[Music]
some that darn helicopter always comes
back again and again should do something
n oh comes from the East should it
prepare for that
nah well anyway this game is a capture
the flag game I'm trying to capture the
flag and these towers are trying to stop
me CU they are protecting the flag and
the flag might be in
here the problem is that it is a Quantum
flag so the position of the flag will
change depending on which buildings I
analyze that's
like not an
intend like the there's no explanation
about it being a Quantum flag it's just
how it
is because the the final position of the
flag will determine which buildings are
destroy capture the quantum flag yes the
towers will fail
talk
though the SG this is not a SG
life
oh what
shot towers are rude
[Music]
no
trying to shoot me a but since I
destroyed the tower in the corner maybe
I can do my regular approach my regular
approach me the initial approach I tried
to do but only F they predicted
that but now I might be able to do
[Music]
it cu cu it was always that one that
tried to stop
me
let's see if it
works no another Tower is facing against
me
now yeah I'm moving
I'm you know
that was a bit
risky it wored but it was a bit
[Music]
risky so what do I have left
then quite a lot of although I might not
need it is easier to take out the towers
in the mid
after thinking out the towers in the
South there south side of the
[Music]
area if I can even fly in this
helicopter
correctly
that that one hit
me so I think that was two rounds so the
third round should destroy the
[Music]
firers third round
time
I love the back and forth as a
kid okay I'll I'm get to that let me do
this attack
first attack
F got the
one as a kid I played something like
this on NES it was kind of hel in
space in space I mean there are three
other vehicles too currently I'm most
focus on the hel attacks and I
immediately got lost as the game kept
wrapping around with no content
generating just empty area after empty
area what that sounds weird that sounds
like an attempt as a creepy
pasta then I was flying there with the
helicopter to space and there was not
nothing nothing anywhere so kept flying
it generated more
nothing I was lost I did not know my way
back through the
base and I feared that I would get the
game
over the wor
scene no to Gamers I
failed anyway
that means that I need a a l of waste
that was stupid oh
well let's use the next
vehicle can we take down this
building at least I got rid of a lot of
towers but but
still but
still or base
I me the [ __ ]
is not shooting
me bit tricky to get through the force
here
a bit a bit too
many
Towers all time to repair this
thing I just get rid of some of these
trees
bit
can we there we go
finally I'm going to peacefully remove
this
Hospital see was not no people in the
hospital no there there are yeah they're
safe they's going
away no no need to worry about it people
in the
hospital
F stop fighting like a bear and fight
like a bunny but if I bite bite like a
bunny if I fight like a bunny how am I
supposed to
win all didn't manage to hit
[Music]
something
how am I supposed to
win don't
know you're the bunny expert here
bunnies are passive and friendly like I
am
currently now it's
more
there we
go my
mission don't maybe I should go back oh
there's here
okay I'm not that damaged
but let's make a clear path here they
really
I'm blocking up the whole place
here okay these
two there we go plenty of space for a
Jeep to go
through
it's so hard to hit the
trees peacefully removing the
buildings now
so so the inhabitants
doesn't go removing the
mines so now we don't need to worry
about any a
[Music]
than going say I'm not work it's there I
then I just need to take get through
that but I can just go through the edge
of that
so that be
easy
uh everything is removed so easy to get
through
now
he's learning some
fuel I can go there but I don't really
need
to
oh that
wor I saw you shooting at me too oh I
shut the
one all right I need to get through here
so there we
go and then I assume I can cross here
it appears
so and then I can get up to that
base and the flag will likely not be
there music starts
up no I didn't mean to shoot the
G you did
other oh no trying
sing avoid them
here oh you're shooting
me think was a surprise he's shooting me
there we
go oh I found some po wiar arm eBay for
only
$800
wow maybe she get
some is it
original if you only had $800
then you could give it to me now
wait I continue am
I it's stay too much damage
already no they keep missing me they
can't okay
actually okay maybe I should go wait
[ __ ] that okay I
should oh
no he shut me
down anyway I got home I
guess I'm not far from the base now
actually since there's not much left I
should take a t then but I've been
wanting H armor for a long time it's my
favorite armor
ever three I want to get
through we can go through the tree than
going around
and just continue like
this
and then just across the
[Music]
water well it
is the thing is I'm so bad at like say
things
like don't
really have much different opinion
regarding armor and such it's not really
not really
my sty I guess
never
like to ask me which I know some people
have if I like certain armor I'm like in
different
like
oh
no my
tank okay that didn't go as
planned I should used one of the
Heavies first and now I should bring
this
in because the B base I'm going to
attack has been pre damaged by the
helicopter
I was just going a bit too
early I should
have accepted that that was too
damaged I was too eager to
continue I do hope the flag is up here
but this will likely not
[Music]
be I don't have too many lels left of
this game it's going to
be going to be weird when I finish every
l
okay nope not flying in here of course
not I guess I just have to travel all
the way back
home and attack the final place
cuz clearly the it would be so strange
if the flag was always in the last
location I
look I mean technically it is because I
don't continue looking for the flag
after I find it so strange I always find
the flag in the last building I
destroying it's just that the last
building I destroy is often the last
building on building on the whole map
almost like it's unintentional
Des sometimes it has been like the not
sure why I destroyed his trees I just
don't like the
[Music]
trees sometimes it has been in a an ear
building or
something
but that's a rare
occurrence P's opinion on ear armor ear
armor uh you mean like armor on my
ears
well if
um well
okay there's last area
there yeah needs to protect us cute flu
ears I mean yeah it would be annoying to
have the ears hurt in a battle it makes
sense
[Music]
so one of the if if one of the outfits
for pon pon is one set of armor and
everything is covered certainly ear
should be covered
too with it own set of
armor and then someone says but that's
not accurate to what humans were was
wearing no
but humans don't have ear like
this oh you tried to shoot
me when I tried to shoot you I was kind
of
failing
we actually have a tower in here through
all this we
go all this
Forest there's another Tower hiding
behind this building
here like
that I I got a piece of road that leads
nowhere ah this game is
weird lot of errors on the
maps oh no I made a mistake
that I think dwarf bar armor would be
too heavy
for I as as salad would be good home for
a
rabbit
well the exact design of uh armor can be
done after I made the pon pon model to
be
used so we see how the mod
looks salid have a lobster tail that
extends behind the hand cover the
neck
so it will also protect rabbit
ears my big fluffy ears those need to be
protecting this sounds like a good s
then go just rushing through this area
I'm May
would also protect
R good thing that design so much uh
armor that protect
Ras I'm guessing they considered anthro
and a rabbits in their
designs
keep using
hit they build a bridge here like a
shortcut the little cool of
water
Okay
so
I have infiltrated the
base I have an interesting set of doors
here
Gates
oh got stuck
again oh
no let me
leave can I even get
home
no because I used more fuel use more
more than half the fuel so I need to
refuel
something I don't have a place to
refuel did I miss a
place Barrack that doesn't help
me place here maybe that n place one
there but there's not no nothing
here
one I'm
screwed don't worries I'm so close to
those buildings anyway
so just a bit more shooty shooty and
they are
[Music]
destroyed
well is the
peaceful tank s need through
work don't mind
it and
there really should to put some fuel
tanks
here I guess you're
here
go there one shot away from destroying
it
one one of these should contain a
flag then
now I just need to clear the way for the
Jeep here we go
very safe for a Jeep
guer don't you
think I
wi I should be able to do
that
there is a self-destruct button and I
just used
it made it safe for
peaceful yes and I read your long
message and soon as I start Crossing
this
water in Super Mario Odyssey
you have to fight an evil bunny who
wears a kettle
Helm yes it does a good job keeping her
safe until you find a way to knock it
off her head and then squish
her yeah I think yeah I know
I that would the haret the
bunny which have added
to the list of outfits that p p pun
should
wear which would include the
hat which would protect pon
[Music]
pon make it safe for peaceful Jeep yep
oh there's a s buttton I thought you hit
a mine now there's
a yep har
Bal are
brother
[Music]
can't I like select the whole inside of
the base as the here is the are you
should bring the flag
[Music]
to I understand like you should bring it
back to your platform or something but
same time best in game they need to let
you
her in that case I should kind of like
you defend any any so so I start in
bottom
left oh my oh
my I I feel like the own basis where
sort
of feel like yeah so so the red B is
kind off
thought what is
this
so
anyway on the twist or they rip so many
fishes from the game to make him seem
like so
oh oh excuse me excuse me that's pretty
rude
I say
so I think I'm
me okay suain quite a lot of damage here
let's go home
[Music]
yeah
okay I found a nice bag to go with my
armor nice which will be useful since I
won't have access to my pockets yeah
that makes
sense I will continue my
Approach strange that they do allow you
to use helicopters on this level this is
one of level they shouldn't allow you to
use a helicopter on
I don't consider
my ability to use
helicopters guess it's like I don't have
helicopters
anyway
[Music]
yep
great okay oh great
hello K hello G hello
yumel I don't I think it was
Yuma welcome
to pon pon the
Bon streaming oh thank you
for for subscription for subscribing G
sp sp flu

raing so what
so what do you mean you should do this
slash that comand as one would do I know
to spell it
correctly go get it
GRE why would why does it say that go
get boot great Play Turn fire that would
be very quite a coincidence if that's a
user that actually played turn
fire or did it just default the the game
I'm playing because it couldn't find
with that
name who is
this there you go gu was playing plasm
obia they actually go get the gr and
then then you
do I mean I think you should be able to
do it I'm sure don't remember if I think
I've done
that
that one
Po and easy to use follow command but
welcome everyone so
G
GRE how did it go in
your obf against plasma
plasma
go I need to I need it out
out
ah I'll take down this building as
Revenge yeah speaking of bases being an
afterthought this level does not have a
red way just a
platform also we need another chap of
walking de too and then some
fast was had by own that's great that's
great
chy I can remember the name of your
giraffe is your a giraffe a boy or a
girl or other
maybe J FL wa whatever G you feel like
wouldn't
they I could be wrong but I think your
giraffe has been dressing a bit feminine
but of
course not they could still May
beable Y is a b but he is a gir of many
disguises yeah
so he can dress up
cute y that was the
name cute like you
great so the so
so which day will you dress up as your
as a
cherleader there we go that's a lot of
yeah that that is a lot of
costumes he's very
expressive okay I'll continue removing
these
towers
oh there we
go I'm move on I'm move
[Music]
on it's doing this some guarding here
removing
trees giraffe's name Isa I thought it
was
G
well now Greg is GRE Y is y don't
confuse them they are completely
separate this game looks fun it has it's
it's very
very and and yeah so as you complete the
level you unlock the next world and I oh
hydrate the shck okay and I assume that
you may maybe not intended
to like go through every single level or
something but I'm doing it I want to
experience it all look at that lump of
hours down south what's the point of
that kind of want to look it up check it
out I was I was the giraffe I wish I was
I wish I was the giraffe yeah he's a
cutie but you're cutie too
great I
mean yeah I guess I I can see the
confusion because like I am
one but I
mean at the same time my real name is
Evelyn and rabbit is name pon pon
so I didn't I do that I should just gone
home p
b why did I do that
just continue doing this what do you
call it carpet
bombing it's straight up I
get I
need yeah and then I just lean I was
never here okay I'll
leave go back to base and pretend like
nothing and I will not be
back I
[Music]
mean yes carpet
bumping kind of kind of
I do misses because the thing is one
miss two Miss destroy something but one
missile and one bullet also destroy
something so I could do so I did one
with bullet so if I do one with missiles
and like rapid fire
missiles they are not rapid that's the
problem so every shot with a missile
should destroy something
now
oh I mean that went better than I
expected hey in that case I have a
[Music]
plan I have to buy my
presents I need to stop doing
that
[Music]
when how's it going I don't
know there we
go
[Music]
no more stupid
decisions I F straight
home and do another
[Music]
round
t
another
[Music]
round oh yeah this time I should do
misses
go then just moving away and then
staring at me what did you do that
[Music]
for
so I have destroy like one side of
it now I just need to
continue
like over this
one here go here
is
and
E
can
C we got a
new
present I saw you my recommendation so
they come check you out and the PG looks
adorable thank

artist but I'm happy oh no shooting

[Music]
building maybe I should have take the
other
[Music]
side I got 278 followers now wo thank
you
VI I playing random
games turn fire Thursday
Friday currently crash three Monday
Tuesday will be without
challenge a challenge some people have
said is going to be too
hard I'll show you nothing's too hard
for
me
[Music]
it's okay have
beened all right moving
[Music]
back I'll be back for you
Towers I always
swim this time is definitely
[Music]
now well too hard for constant Li Li and
land I will not stand for these that's
why I'm lying down in
there
hydrate I will not stand and for this I
am currently lying down in
[Music]
bed is this the more more D yeah Prett
much I got rid of a bunch of
[Music]
stuff
has that stuff
healed no it hasn't healed
because I guess
Technically when when you destroy the
tower it's replaced with a sing which is
has full health of a
power sports way more Sports
way I should up go there's a lot of
flying back for this level I want it to
be a 3D model for video games that the
video part and mon because I like
Digimon I would like call Von but I
lengen it to monster it makes it more
unique too I
[Music]
think say
hello but is very nice I
hope have you done any like
you said you
want to be
a but have you like
um done any c modeling
work more like
private hobby work more like
that
[Music]
this what I
do every Saturday Sunday I do like
modding pon pon into crash 4 I am a mod
but I just make me right
now
well what the
coincidence
there we go this is certainly make it
easier I should be able
to do one run across the inner lenss and
then I
should see another carpet run
the line next to the flag and then I
should do miss so at least three more
runs and then I will clear out the
area so this will be the missile run on
the
outter the outter Miss
run
that
the
second the one next to one there we
go there we
go that's what I
wanted
sh didn't pass my aim isn't that
great I too
far and then it's the carpet bombing run
on the line next to the base to the
flag
Mye don't model I guess son is based on
Von if you know I don't know
what yes I haven't seen
your B that your on your
emote based on
your if if you did I do know that I want
to watch a show but I
never watch much of it I started
watching but then
[Music]
and and I lost and I forgot about
it I always like pamon back in the
day
I think I like
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
goton here we
go
is basically
only like one power left
here there you go now it's cleared out
Le flag is in here
yes but I don't want to do all that
working no sorry the flag is in another
Castle he I just want to check out this
place down here is all F
FL this
one like what's the point of
this just an island with Towers
everywhere
everywhere anyway deep time
I still have one of those dig devices
from the
show I never had one of the I had a
plush based on gab
one tiny
one teeny tiny
one anal fortification can
maybe would be against
na there isn't
even I guess they there are some Marines
but they are like
independent attacking anyone who tries
to flee the
island they got the
flank
yeah who needs to go around the whole
Sly thing which
I I mean I would have to if I lost all
helicopters
so it was a semi
joke
well why would you make a jokes about
semis also you might not have boats but
someone else might
no
one yeah the
independent faction that attacks
everyone with the
summ but that was a submarine
so but anyway it's nice meeting you
though but I feel like I took over your
stream talking about my much how are you
doing no you didn't it's
fine it is
fine on and and how have I been I've
been doing
better like getting up earlier getting
my morning walks
getting feel better M's Over Matter oh I
don't like the sound of time why is it
so much
gray oh those Road pieces that must be
NE ah I I so this is another special map
then but I only have three jeeps in our
mins
everywhere okay I have one Jeep
everywhere okay let's move up and
check I thought it would be me me the
map is almost
pink I thought it would be
more and as you can see and the whole
game is G based and every single piece
of uh
Road
surface must have a cannot cover the
corner of its Square it's filling out so
so when you have asphalt covered like
that it must be well I guess I'll just
continue be free to
talk up yeah I mean yeah you you don't
you can talk about something that's I
don't know not about you if you feel if
you don't feel like talking so much
about
yourself that works
too I mean I way on the topic of moding
of YouTubers what I want to do which
I've said many
times is making a see the model of pon
pon H for
stream and then and uh and I'll see how
well I can make
it and I think that was the thing I Tred
to say I just didn't know how to phrase
it that every Saturday Sunday just not
this weekend because I'm little busy I
work on I work on a mod for crash 4
replacing Coco with pon pon and I'm
making a bunch of different
outfits mind is construct on material
Hardware I mean it could easily do that
it could check the diagonal lot Road and
the corn I mean they they okay
like they don't check anything uh they
just every road piece is preprogrammed
for what shape it should
have and they don't have I mean
otherwise they would use it here I have
so far not seen a single map where they
fill the corners with a road
piece so I can only assume they don't
have uh
that it just doesn't
exist
I should maybe not destroy that first
one because I said it's
a is an ant is a it's destroyed it's a
Quantum flag it will it will appear in
the last building that's how that's how
it
works me looking for the flag I will
determine where I can show up here it is
in the fource and last
building they given up making like huge
annoying maps and now they're more like
oh that was enough to destroy well I had
to go
back
[Music]
oh uh how much experience do you have
with this modeling I mean
you well I
[Music]
mean I could
show I
made have any no not
there
um I think this one be
good here we go
ta that's a 3D
model what do you think
that's so
good thank
you okay here the texture is a bit
blurry I'll see if I can do something
about that
then for working in the in the
cam
and then it will just be matter of
making one extra Road piece well they
would have to make many types of Road
pieces actually
because
um you have the T intersection which has
two corner pieces and so you have one
the other of both that means three of
those so that's three * 4 direction of
the t t
intersections so that's 12 Road pieces
and then for the for the four-way
intersections you have four corners that
each could be either filled or not
filled so that is 2 to the^ of 4 which
is 16 variants of that
one so that's 16 + 12 what is that 28 M
this is a bit more than just
one
and I am not commenting on this game I
am commenting on on it easy doable even
inactive time left yeah yeah yeah yeah
of course of
course could have done
it but I didn't should be really
proud I'm so I'm so happy I like it and
I
will it look it is it looks really nice
seeing it animated in the
game oh can you stop shooting
[Music]
me three more you can rotate Tes uh
these tiles are not symmetrical so you
can't really rotate
them I if
you consider yeah because they have
texture on them and the texture is not
symmetrical and they have shading on
them too so that would also not allow
rotating okay that can G
back good yeah he's not
hard just would require more
times many more
times uh it's always impressive watching
P make
for thank
you it is fun to make them sometimes
tedious but it's
fun oh I shoot one at once oh
one oh the flag is up
here but what if I just go through
here there you go
I really must I only have one Jeep not
three so I really must make
sure that is clear and open okay so I go
up
here up here there's mine
there then I
move continue
[Music]
up
[Music]
[Music]
go out of
munition I mean that should be
fine
that should be
fine oh mine's your
favorite
yeah but speaking of the ti thing if
they're not restricted to filling out a
full
tile tiles what they do could do is
split up a tile into four
corners and then for each
Corner the only need the corner to
go one way the other way both way or no
way and then they would have four
corners so that means 4 * 4 16
[Music]
pieces but don't know if the engine
allows that and I suspect this engine
does not okay there we
[Music]
go I did it same
again probably someone here hasn't seen
it but 10 minutes 15 second seconds same
same there we
go
oh B Red
Menace a start one okay yeah this is
oh my oh my let's just destroy
everything whole fighing Soviets
apparently I didn't know Soviets were
like
green would wouldn't make more sense if
I were green fighting the
red destroying everything
here just letting Towers destroy
themselves oh no where do you come from
I'm busy letting the towers destroy
themselves
thank you so many rocks here is going to
be very annoying to get through with the
Jeep
so they kind of took care of themselves
there yeah the towers are not the most
intelligent well let's
continue
I'm not quick enough to destroy the
towers before destroy
themselves
okay there are some mines
here come
on
yeah
that's pry good then I just continue
around the whole
thing just
continue taking down Tre with
rocket that's how I
did
maybe I should
like go around the outside
here now this things
here what do you
want what do you
want want fighting
one going to be out or should get
through
here can't say a too much
damage time to move
home
okay remove some of these while I'm one
my way
home flying R thing here wants to be
rude too
F than over the
base how much do I have
okay I'm working myself
up working myself up the agent okay
so
getting works
up so many Towers here
destroyed just gravel
left where they want
stood
oh now they're getting F away from each
other so they not destroying each
other why
doesn't matter much wait couldn't
I the we go across that road because the
buildings are preventing
the the towers from
shooting here we go yes continue good
good
this corner is a bit
annoying I can do
it too too
many yeah I I'll move I'll move I'll get
out of the Z
way
come you just go down this
road yeah this is safe I try to shoot
you but it's not like you can't shoot
you make
easier
gu I just need to avoid getting shot
there
easy
very
easy someone to place a rock on the
base that means that the rocks are not
part of the
tiles so I work my way up there pretty
good I'm getting closer
to where the flags
are two yeah this feels like a map that
should be rather short not not a map
that will take 2 hours like some other
Maps so the question is is this game fun
well not by map Tak 2
hours
I should probably go home
and repair the
vehicle I don't like that you can still
shoot me
I didn't mean shoot you
much there you
go
this makes it easier to get
around where are you hiding behind the
building
yeah not I need to but I wanted
to
Boom anyway sorry for ignoring CH okay
it was seeing
got got to go ahead dinner I'm getting
hungry I ni see you next time thank you
for coming by hope you have a good time
here like the other games I want to play
to and I hope it's been nice chatting
with you enjoy
the have good dinner hope it's something
good
I hope time here is enjoyable if one
could put put a texture on the corner of
place you could do the roing with one
texture yeah that's true if you can like
overlay multiple tiles on top of each
other oh everything's destroying
here
everything
everything this stuff is in here
but that's not
good I can't get through by the Jeep if
they shoot
me so yeah I do have to do something
about that you know what
towers they keep shooting
me and that's not acceptable if I come
here the
je now I'm
stuck okay I mean that was so stupid
but the [ __ ] stupid well I
got was the L of one
heavy me sign
thing
when I got to two
more at least the enem is weaking
down this is fine this part I just want
to come up
here you are not
fine of course not here go I need to
care about this
part I don't get any
here yes
shoot good
now get
luck and I was
St dang yeah finally a lot of back and
force Min point turn with
that
yeah I'm taking too much
damage anti
posc
and I'm going use these
to that wasn't the one I
wanted there we
go I fed up the wrong
thing
you're pretty smart bu pun thank
[Music]
you you're pretty smart for a
bunny to be fair maybe I
am every bunny says
like for that's too much for me to
understand from a little small bunny
brain but that's
mean okay so you can reverse up onto one
of those rocks but you cannot reverse
onto a bush makes
sense makes perfect
sense
and running over a huge Rock on the
beach with uh how heavy this vehicle is
does not make the rock sink down into
the
end understandable
it looked like there was just a wall up
here and no towers that does make sense
excuse me what did you do that
for yeah this is the one
here cuz it's just a one hand why not
do
inste of driving water which is really
slow I can drivve in on the road which
is really
quick then I just need an
exit there we
go okay I need to get read sorry
people oh no
I'm getting bombarded from everywhere
I'm
leaving oh Ro like the wrong
road get me through no I'm stuck
again
no that wasn't
smart not every decision I make is a
smart decision
well at least I'm come
far so now I just need
team
wonder if I should try to attack a
corner here it's not probing
soon now just take the exit
here it's like that I think
if I can
it there we
go
Bo one shot from the stke
oh no this one shoot me
too oh no there shooting the
bridge oh no
destroy the piece of the
bridge stop destroying the
bridge now destroy another piece of the
bridge they're destroying the bridge
piece by
piece
can I use
this I'm
sorry
1995 this is older than
me well rocket man you must be a young
L but welcome rocket man holy moly yeah
maybe I should put the here in title or
something didn't you know this was an
old game what did you think this game
came out
yesterday
D 95 is older than you now I feel
old I'm a young Bo
Snapper well so many Towers so many
Towers yish Vibes welcome back I hope
you come with some yell fish
Vibes you're
welcome
wow this map is not only sh it's the
same only in there wow this map is not
sh about it's design yeah it's
the Communist
logo how very
communist
yeah I got uh I have to destroy the
green
Communists I think Soviets
I would assume they should be red but
whatever the green
commies y
stop yep
yep destroying a piece every time
P Point hello G you're still here I
thought I thought you had got B
something got I got sleep on you're
going sleep
now I understand
well I'm different than
one be
understandable do you reach me all the
way from
there
oh no it's thank my tank that was very
rude of
it this is this is getting a s it
because
I bye-bye G have fun
sleeping flying thing yeah I destroy the
bridge not the
tank
well going to use my other
tank gu here Jeep should be fine
[Music]
let
me make sure is like
sa by destroying
these
like
that yeah
shooting you're supposed to
shoot on one
more there we
go
fin what you're supposed to get
across I I mean
you should be able to cross one square
cuz me I can't do anything else if I
can't get get across one
square happy 6:00 you it's 5 here it's
18 in
[Music]
here I know what you
mean
maybe brid Works differently get onto
Bri underneath this the game doesn't
really have any
depths there the difference between the
PC version and the play version but feel
bit weird
though don't feel like it works like
that anywhere else I guess I'll try to
go full speed and
nope apparently somehow is wider than a
one block one somehow it is wider
than uh
yeah wider than it looks for some
reason
well could they get across
there is that the vangas
what no idea
you're well that was a
failure yeah getting across the bridge
is going to be very tricky I mean be a
Jeep though but
but if I I
mean I do have to complete this
level
so why this level is
lagging
[Music]
the V boys belongs to the vanga boys if
you say
so okay let's just enter with the che
then I have to
lose really do anything
else
it's not going to go well
but
[Music]
yeah I think this is uh
over I need to find a different better
approach
there tow is
there it's just a
bridge yeah I don't know what
i is it getting dark in here
again
okay problem is that the towers is
shooting the bridge
that should beest
[Music]
problem if I'm like on the bridge they
shoot in the bridge but not sure how
else I would
like attack the towers if not on the
bridge that's the tricky
part
there we go that was the Run
round much did I clear out was quite
some popular music act from the early
naties very naughty
I
mean I don't know Banger
boys
but if you
like is it your favorite boy
band can only see B
boys would be boy
B
how many is don't
everything might
need think get through with a helicopter
or
something so that's make
it they're attacking up there for no
reason oh no not this
thing
not that
thing moving on
and also as GRE left
he made pon pon put on a swim
suit
so
so maybe I should just continue up
through the hammer and just ru that
party pon
pon party on the Bang
Bus
okay there you go unit has to part the
girl
so much
lag stuck
in theing
here no I'm getting
pummeled
can can I get shot down
already
finally why don't you get destroyed oh
no finally
finally
p p punch should do dance like
that I been looking at swords they're
throwing
grenades with
swords yeah those soldiers are star
that's the last thing they can
do
okay clearing out
the base
here an emote with Pon swings so Pon
isn't violent that would be out of
character p p pun will never harm
anyone or destroy
anything
Die s that not possess lives lives and
cannot
die wouldn't need to harm anyone with
it SW is a weapon
this are
is
so many 7
running
cleaning up the whole
[Music]
area I couldn't I guess I could have an
emote of like a
more more of a like
this what is it it's all I for
me there we
go sliced
PO with a
sword he a very short
sword more
like like a
knife to many buildings get R of all of
them
wa whoa w
w I'm just C out the way for me to go
through here don't worry so much about
it soldiers
CU I'm getting shot at still uh cleared
out
area what way
sure hydrate
sure I plus
check is
getting oh no I C half F
yes so I'm working way up there working
me up
thanks
I making sure I do this right I don't
have to start over
again
okay so they want to get rid of this
tower
that let Let's ignore
M to this some
time wait how are we supposed to get to
that road it's
completely
no Rocket Man got the star and I lost a
vehicle I need to mine this
appear gu there
that
so much for being
careful
now maybe I should go on the
outside no not be on the
inside oh there's a building on the
outside
there
you can I reach those on the on
side
okay
nice yeah F he's dead
yay
I make my own passage
too so much Rubble
everywhere no more
[Music]
Minun okay can
I
yeah if I clear out like the head of the
hammer does make it easier to get
through with a
[Music]
helicopter but I might need
to which could be good to maybe mention
D away that I might need to end the
stream the normal
time in half an
hour
but
and if I haven't finished the level yet
I'll just
continue level next
week
anothering no it's
St
okay it's a lot of to
here
there you
go I need
thing what
say trying to think of D back think like
mean but maybe maybe there's no
difference between rude and
mean yeah can you can type fle and
the disrespectful
respectless
this place seems like one of those Mega
Pro cities that no one lives in
definitely not now since I shut
down still looks like a
place s might be a good
word heavily
almost you can type that in
yeah this place
is
destroyed and I'm not responsible for
that I came here and just looks like
this
so they build up Towers to PR the
fuel must be some
preium a lot of these that are not
predicted that
much this one was always
predicted
okay well I didn't say fle I said fle
okay there we
go maybe I can get across the water I
should probably not test
it yeah I don't think
Stu
okay and now since I got rid of
those please yeah there you go and then
frck
let's single
Sy don't know let me through
here flying no wait I can't get there
yeah there's a mining
way fly on fle
G here we
go the funny things that everyone start
with
f but the hammer is
destroyed now I should like move up the
sck or something
ah that sentence contains the three
added letters to the s
B there's one word that
uh that used as an
example for a word
that
contains actually not two words
actually you got the word like ra meros
that contains all three and Stella is
another
one
hello scraping against one second
rotate
there are there are probably many more
such Swedish
words me must
be especially considering you can make
comines and
stuff
go oh no destroy my protection oh no
come on
protected
come out
of they're shooting their own
buildings
well I can type when I'm going back to
base
like Mar
go
go
there you go there's probably
more definitely more of those words yeah
work my way around
there let have
continue continue this is another one of
those I thought this map would be quick
but
no not at
all Rax Mar something table
what
n does not mean table in
anyway
have you seen how many Towers there
are and yes I have a looked at the
map but that doesn't mean just because
there's a lot of towers doesn't mean
that will take a long time cuz it really
depends on
how what short C you can take and
stuff she the real
factory
cutting wait sandwich yes there you go
I'm tired definitely yeah the me
sandwich the first one is shrinkle prawn
or maybe even those Swedish might not
differentiate between
them I mean some English speak is not
even difference yet between them
two
I was thinking smos boot yeah what part
of smos boot means table I mean it's
most be obvious
now just keep mind it's
fine such a
crime and from that remembering yeah
remembering the part of the world was
not there
oh they shot the
tram no what a
shortcut what
with two P I
think Tech spell Korean
letters it's basically letters the way
they use
it it means over means over gong is the
is like is a moment of
walking it's walking just not the very
reason now and ST means
place place where you can walk over
something breach well that was a very
weird word
for I
mean
Bri
well
is funny though H it means just
across in
case across going
place since we can walk across which you
can find in
traffic
oh crosswalk yeah pedest Crossing
crosswalk come on come
on you not a fan of that why
you
anyway let's
rep I don't
know I'm not Tak any
risk there you go now you know what the
two words mean now you can try to come
up with more switch part that contains
all three
letters and what's I mean there's loads
of words but what's special about those
words is that they contain exactly one
of each but neither contains them in
in
water and both words do not even like n
is in order not even in reverse
order attacking peaceful tanks is bad
for the health fly things yes I was so
peaceful I was just removing a mine I
was kind of in the
way oops sh one too many times it's
fine I don't need that one there plenty
of
them there loads of
them I can just use another
one the building was hit by a missile
but the people inside don't care
when my dad first heard the my gang he
the broken condom Stein I think I've
heard other people say that
too
hey what did you destroy the
tank when if it's
unprotected we have to destroy it for
the brown team
confusing
okay so far it goes
well is it that say I don't have to
cross
everything
there we
go it's peacefully moving away Scorch
Earth tactics what do you
mean removing
everything remove
everything
oh
no don't shoot my
tank well I'm going
on is that not what it means in English
no it's very I think it's very hard to
translate it to English opa is uh anic
used
by uh you you use Opa as a younger
sibling to your older
brother and uh it's also used by women
to
refer
to
like the men they're idolizing I think
something like
that gangam is still
location is our location I think some
high class location if I'm not mistaken
and sty your style I hope you know that
word but actually translating into
English I'm not really sure I know of
this one game where there's a special
attack that's supposedly called the
broadside walls but it sounds like the
kind saying instant
BS I mean
what if what if the person who told the
person who was doing the recording that
was very confusing said
um remove these tires because they
started to annoy me they said say
broadside walls and the person had heard
instant balls and now this and then they
s
in
wouldn't that be
funny there we
go
never oh no
flying
there Land
watching you think they caught that in
recording no I mean if they if if proide
walls and instant balls sounds that
simil there maybe no one caught
that there you
go peaceful walk miny bank
now mining
way good thing the people get exit
further
up no no no no no here I'll destroy it
for you now we can
exit let's destroy this building too oh
okay this building gets this
end
destroyed
almost
well
as in fact I just had to look up the
name of the game and instant
balls find the actual name of the
attack BS was the first suggest to pop
up game well
then
interesting
yeah I wish not to have instant
balls and I'm be using this for like
twice the time now it's been 29 minutes
since it was redeemed I'll find the
video it's
okay I
wasn't
more SP more bunny
tummy PNY
py
take out these towers whoops didn't mean
to do
that at least take out
those yes I can cut down here
e okay so bit hard
to get to the towers with all these
buildings in the
way there we go now I can shoot more
fre
oh aggressive
once what do you have against me what
have I
done
okay let me release you people there we
go now we can walk
out stop shooting
me my I can't I must stop shooting you

video good good I guess I'll have to
watch it I can't really watch it now I
can't but you know I'm streaming you
