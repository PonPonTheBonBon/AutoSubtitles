so welcome everyone I'm actually
surprised to see five people already
seriously as the one oh now it's updated
to one person
I guess everyone left as soon as I sleep
again
I'm not sure if the watch number is
accurate on this
but uh
yeah it's down at the moment I don't
know why it said five before
I was
and then I for rather decided to leave
as soon as it's started but yes here it
is now I actually managed to get it to
work you take
more effort than I wanted
so this is uh now running on My Places
PlayStation 3.
and the
and the introduction to the game will
start immediately so that's why I'm
so where do we Where Do We Begin is my
Audi level kit I hope the game is kind
of loud since I should probably lower
the
Game beat are they a bit yes
yeah it should be much better now than
the last stream
a Google Chrome adjust the level on the
microphone and I just
Chrome for like talking on Discord and
stuff and then it lowers it and then I
have to remember to increase it
so let's begin with the introduction to
the game
you're so awesome oh thank you
I am getting more and more experienced
so
well let's begin and so there is once
like one and a half second delay of the
picture from when I see the two and its
dreams I could not find a way to delay
my microphone in the
the software I use to stream yesterday
so if I reacted something it should
happen on stream at the same time but I
guess we'll just deal with this
and hope for the best
so let's begin with the all right
there's some
company logos first as well
and then we get the very short story
Empire interactive is the publisher well
I guess it says there
and then from soxbury to the developer
everything is working great
it was the eve of the millionaire
Festival
but the moon which should have been
illuminated in night sky was nowhere to
be found
as Chestnut and cream trudged along the
path towards home imagine a suddenly
appeared and spoke to them seems as
though the moon has run away
if the moon doesn't return they will
never again be another Festival upon
hearing this the two Heroes decided to
take marriage in their own hands and
seek out the men
you two must have become many challenges
here take these crowns as proof of your
undeniable courage
as there is this Cry came to an end
they were no longer on the path home and
instead they found himself
themselves on a Mysterious Island
failed filter the last sentence
there you go Chestnut and cream okay I
did call Chestnut a brown bunny it's
more yellow
so yeah curricular mix is the name of
the game
I hope you can hear me over the game let
me know if the game is too loud the game
can be quite loud
[Music]
so this would be the European version of
the game which I have chosen because
it's more accurate to the Japanese
original game which is also called
curriculumix
[Music]
which I assume the name stands for
because the name of chestnuts in
Japanese is curry which is Japanese for
Chestnut and cream in Japanese would be
kurimu so you also have kuri at start of
that name as well and then I guess mix
mixing them together is there a Chestnut
and cream mix of something I tried to
lift that up before
the audio is fine that's great to hear
so
in this game you can play two players in
this game
but I would play myself I don't have
anyone else to play with but that will
be a greater challenge
to use one controller
to control the bows characters at the
same time
and you're going through
multiple levels on this island
to find that Moon you're so smart thank
you
and we got another watch here welcome
you're free to chat if you want or you
can just watch in silence that's
perfectly fine
so we'll start with the jungle word
world
and they should be
four levels and then
a boss at the end I think spoiling
everything
no but
yeah if you want a voice maybe don't
watch the stream of this game so yeah
just stop it definitely a yellow bunny
and then you control those characters
and then we have a bridge Block in the
way
saved one Japanese stands on the
bathroom
[Music]
foreign
and then
just hit the same on time
please pick it up thank you and I'm
moving the
crocodone alligator I don't know I did
this out of the way
this first level
and then you basically have to keep
track of uh most of these rabbits at the
same time
Let's ignore this
[Music]
thank you
and then something like this it's of
course much easier to play tip time but
I cannot defeat the
point of the game
and then there are puzzle pieces
together
[Music]
but you have to gather them all and then
you will unlock a
things for the
you don't unlock anything for the same
thing move so I will not waste time on
the personal pieces
do you call them jigsaw pieces I don't
know
so that's basically the
and then then it will automatically
continue over to the next level
the core of this game the levels will of
course be much harder as the game will
sound
so
[Music]
I think you should only be able to you
know walk over at least and this will
stay up
looking for me
okay what's up
because
they had to work together
[Music]
at the top of the screen there is the
timer
she had to reach the goal before the
time runs of course
these timers on the
make sure you get extra time and every
time you take damage or fall off the
level
you will lose time
yeah that's it
that was a mistake trust me
but uh
yeah there was a she left me too jumping
through it I had to go into the ghost
and then I must make sure I don't miss
the chat as well
so
if you did look at what the game was
listed on Twitch
I know it's coming deeply help me
[Music]
keep it away from me
oh yeah now let's see
[Music]
these are connected somehow
foreign
I guess it worked out
and then go around this thing
to open it up
[Music]
he fell into the water
thank you
now let's see
this [ __ ]
oh this and I can walk through or I can
do that and get this thing
I wonder if the time you get this worse
the time you spend so I'm doing this
is
that wait what is this in there
[Music]
oh I see
[Music]
them
walk into the watches
so I have this
thing together
I'm trying to look at chats after every
every level how many levels what's that
I didn't keep track
so that was a stage thing okay
back to us I was saying with before I
got distracted so twitch might list this
game and being called the cooking cream
The Adventures of cooking cream
depending which language you have on
Twitch
which would be the North American Title
of the game
and they also changed chestnuts to be
called cooking since the title works
but
I need to do something here here it's a
thing
okay grab it yes thank you
that's true
like that
something feels easier to grab one too
[Music]
do this
this seems a bit easy to be done
but the password doesn't do anything
anyway
so how do I get over here I use
something with this
a bridge
is this all I get
I thought it was enough
I did manage guitar
there's another new love so that you're
not allowed to stand still for too long
because then something comes and instead
on it
comes in the damage
so I must make sure to move I don't know
how long your life stay you are allowed
to stay a few seconds at least so yeah
here is should be the best level
in this Arena
they're jumping through the roof
[Music]
this game is great I love it
Silex is that how you would say it
oh a cutscene
you've played this game before I I
assume I played this game before
but I haven't played it
managed to play through the holy game
and I saw the bunnies and that's kind of
my theme of this
stream the cute bunnies yeah they are
the determined pink
funny
I also hope the audio of the game is in
sync
Rock Beast Golem
is the name of the rugby score Pink
Bunny Run
like that
okay
do I need to learn
it without taking him back
I said I don't need to eat it three
times I should DC come here come here
I'm down here
you want to hug the little oh but that
didn't work
you miss me
and that that hit his leg that she can't
you have more on the other side but
come in
now
it worked I need it okay moving out to
the other side now it was enough
three hits in the bossy side well there
wasn't easy first bus the later bosses
will be harder
same yeah why not
uh the cute ones is
uh it is I played this years ago I
remember it family
yeah I don't I yeah I played I don't
remember how like longer planes
how long does it take to say oh there we
go
and then I need to press the continue
you did it yeah I did the first easy bus
so now we come over to the next one we
got two bars maybe you should choose we
have the music worlds and the
Western world
amazing world and
desert world but as I said I thought
about the wild west that's what I said
question uh
which do you fancy
[Applause]
the first person to choose I'll pick
that world music or desert
music is nice
[Music]
so let's go with music
even though there's one element on this
in this world I cannot do okay what's
difficulty of this spot is
enough enough to do it kind of uh ground
pounds
good grab it some some sometimes the
crab doesn't trick him
you just use both
I mean there's an exclamation point
I don't know okay you're only around
just that
seriously they just said they grab now I
can grab it
so I think it can be a bit weird
sometimes
but I thought I jumped on it
all right and then that was my fault
oh wow it makes sense
so I should be able to do something here
oh there we go
but
oh I can't jump over this there we go
now it makes sense
[Applause]
that was a complete failure so I can
and that lives down
I hit it a bit too early okay now
thank you
I know it works
with this banjo
and that was a failure and now we're
going to land on the other side because
I can only respawn on solid grounds
okay now jump over fully
and then
somehow I should be able to do something
here
I should this is something like this
is something I can interact with me
there's an explanation point
but I don't see what I don't remember
all right here it is
[Music]
there we go
Chestnut is over
anything else
and I did it that was a bit of a
complicated level
[Music]
politics here and a half minutes
quite the Step Up from the previous one
thank you
so I think
you should be able
or you can just jump on there
yeah you can apparently okay so there
was nothing I came here
it's just some
not too easy platforming
so that's something I can do something
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
I want to see
so and then I make it high
and then stand on it
and what was the point of that
so I can read the trumpet
for too long
wait a minute
can you can you stop doing that please
I'm trying to oh this should be the
height of the
of these things
and that's time stop I was messing
around too much
I like the sound the bunnies make they
oh yeah and also when you walk up to
these signs I don't know what they're
actually saying it's probably something
in Japanese but let's take a listen
I assume none of you speak Japanese
okay I could figure out what
they're saying
oh wait here is actually something you
can play this is what I was thinking
about
let me get this yeah
um so
by the way
to me it does sound
and my phrase I mean this basically
sounds like Swedish to me sounds like
they're saying
eventually
either doesn't they don't speak loud
so
[Applause]
I said I was gonna be I got rid of it
sign up mentally that's Swedish for a
wait for a moment
um
this is going to take some time
how much did I get from this
um
and then we make it high
can I jump does that count is moving
because jumping is pretty simple
I'm gonna play it's high term
and then I should change these no all
right
that's good enough
time is running out
don't give you much time to work it
then I need to lower it
[Music]
something like that
and then by playing the trumpet
you should change the platforms
like that based on
what you said the trumpet too
okay now that I've basically figured out
let's do it without failing too much
like training practice or restart option
there is good all right and it actually
choose yes this one
okay one more try without failing this
time
and then I need to jump to get this I
forgot about that
wasn't nice
well since I know what to do now
let's just set this halfway I think it
should be good enough
it's gonna probably get me up on it and
high enough to play it maybe
I bet oh this must be one of those just
sprinkler
here is actually when I was thinking
that's just a regular enemy that's
attacking
all right is it too high to play on
actually
no I can play on it
does it stay down
oh no
this is gonna be tricky
[Music]
wait I'll just wrong side
[Music]
I got the timer from it
it feels like I'm wasting as much time
to get around this so I need this to
step on
[Music]
belts
so
I was looking at cream I didn't see it's
just not getting hit in the head
so no
okay
[Music]
what's that come on
that's it that's this thing
I need to
no wait I need to go walk on top of it
Thursday
and then you can just walk beside all
the holes
and yeah and then yeah okay this
together I assume
[Applause]
and then you can reach the girl whoa I
did it
how long did that take
this is three minutes I've been thinking
it's a pun pun oh wait what is a Pom-Pom
I missed the Pom-Pom part
because I cannot see the chat while I'm
playing and I
considering the difficulty of this game
like I just walked into the water
all right
they're not actress with this
things
got stuck on my head
I actually
[Music]
get off my head
please
that's one of those Japanese instruments
which I don't know anymore
should I remember I lift it up oh I that
was a surprise
now now I'm getting squished by her
Thinking by everything
so
okay
[Music]
perfect
I said that was
I haven't fully understood the
[Music]
controls the rules of this game
yeah now I did that see
yeah
it was 30 seconds
okay
I need to do something like this
yeah oh can you play uh you play this
for myself a few seconds left jump up
come on chestnuts run to the go no
I didn't press quit I actually touched
the stick
straight to it
accidentally pressing quick
okay let's continue with that honest
mistakes this time
any cream can exercise down here
running circles
[Music]
[Music]
all right
no it's one thing you shouldn't have
done
[Music]
come on get out of it yes
wait
[Applause]
let's continue over here
that's getting attacked by every enemy
so oh yeah I was supposed to play this
thing
hey why is that wasn't rude
that
makes this one you see let's pick this
up anyway
I'll stop playing too soon
[Music]
oh no I touched it
because I yeah
[Music]
it's just not in I'm playing with them
I thought I did better this time but
not when looking at the clock oh this is
so now I got a lot of time so now I died
mine is compound
so I'm really not sure
what the rules are
so plenty of time we're getting to be
good
yeah I did it
we're the next level
[Music]
I don't know
stringed a bit
this next level has one element that I
just can't do
it's basically try another error for me
well well
I didn't expect that to happen
even though it looked like you're gonna
wear through cream it was just not you
fell off the level
come on now
[Applause]
I love the sound effects
you have to hurry hurry oh it doesn't
matter it's
describe it just just grab it
just grab it
can I see now you got you got polished
well let's continue
I guess let's see
and
oh yeah
sorry
can I grab this
huh
okay I just jumped once okay
okay hold on
okay here we go
okay
they gave you 60 Seconds
for justice puzzle so it works like this
it's very hard
and then you should say that but I have
no idea what that is
[Music]
and this is the worst part
it plays different things every time
[Music]
this is basically trailer for me
and then
it's not completely trailer
I can still hear which direction the Sun
goes in
so
it's actually start I think and it's
about how much it has to change himself
so thanks yeah
of course impossible to
play if you're not identity
[Applause]
yeah at all
of course
I think that's the only one actually
here
it was weren't actually
that was actually a bit quicker than I
thought you guys might usually stuck on
that for a long time
let's go okay now it's the second bus I
don't I don't know which direction
around the island you're supposed to go
and also giving me some topic to talk
about I guess I feel like
I need something
interesting
yeah which bus was this magical
instruments
seem boring
it's just simple tambourine
um let's see if I can forget it remember
how to there's a hammer
and he likes hammers
oh cream also got the hammer
from nowhere
um something's broken
[Music]
this is weird
let me
restart
that wasn't graphical issues I haven't
seen that happen before
it is a pose like
after testing this it's supposed to just
run on the native
PS2 Hardware in the PS3 can I skip this
yes I don't watch this oh you can oh no
this this is unavailable because this is
very distracting
so
let me try to reset the game that's good
I haven't seen this because it is a
possibility that it would run on the
software animation
but
but it has an actual
um
PS2 Hardware in it supposedly
there's no complete thank you
oh I didn't save
forgot about that part
because you have to save because it
doesn't auto save like the spiral game
foreign
but that's no problem
I can do this quickly
I know exactly
[Music]
no speed running
Don't touch don't touch tip on me
you're not allowed that bunnies
okay it's not speed running on it when
you don't want to grab it thank you
that was the room
please quickly
all right
[Applause]
what's up
because now I know
and I got some practice today
this was very quick just jump down
then I hit it twice
[Applause]
do some exercising
foreign
[Music]
okay
and then
when I get to the bus I should say
there's not now this level is easy
[Music]
unless I do that there's no
I think they call it Priority time
when you walk off an edge that you
should
[Music]
still be able to do the first jump
[Music]
so in this game we can only do
and then
that's not how pressing buttons work
again today
[Music]
concentrate
[Music]
and don't grow into that I think it's
[ __ ] gets back
[Music]
and also
it wasn't obvious and
as they move away from each other they
go into split screen
foreign
let's play
[Music]
now they can go to go together
let's go
so this was much quicker
can we have a repeat but
I made a mistake
Let's ignore that
so
all right exercise in time
there's a swimming function
if you want to get a close look at the
bunnies
yeah this game is not accurate at all
when it comes to
throw this inside
you just I wish I'm glad more otherwise
that'll be read
I thought that was a bit of a bad time I
mean I guess I could chase this down
probably not
oh I should have stopped
someone's playing
and that this time play it
until Chestnut gets far away
after this distance should be enough
more than enough
there you go
now I got the kids working here
[Music]
climb up
you need to play
if why is it
the car is I don't remember what it's
called I was gonna say flute but I don't
know the difference between the flute
and the recorder
oh
that was easy after
doing it and feeling it at multiple
times
it wasn't too easy to be fair
wow
without doing a mistake on this part
again
save this song please make it sleep
here
all right
protected that
yeah that's what you get for doing that
oh I did
realize we reached outside
yeah gotta pick up this now I need to do
this thing again
I guess that's what I get for not saving
[Music]
okay let's see
walk down
[Music]
all right
same again
that was too high okay
[Music]
and then
I hope
nope that was too late
oh hi
I don't know
[Music]
[Music]
Master hi
this is basically my
[Music]
can I get a new one
[Music]
this is
maybe that's the thing
I don't know because I don't know this
this stuff
I have to take double jumps whenever
I really should pay my location to
action shadow
so
it's not only that music thing is also
that
it's a far end of the level as well that
goes seems so much to reach it and then
I'll get up stage four so let's time to
save
and I guess this boss is just broken
yeah the bus is broken
it's weird because it definitely
shouldn't be like this
so I will quit back to the world
and then I will save
knocking the microphone
but but I have to defeat the boss
somehow
can I
I don't think like
there's like softening as an option I
thought I confirmed that I don't think
that's doing anything useful
nope
with Stephen doing it when I see the
pairing the game
I didn't know I did that okay I will try
to defeat it if if you are sensitive
light
um I will tell you when this is over
[Music]
[Music]
oh yeah
it's not too distracting me
wait how am I
supposed to do this I'm so sorry for
breaking things out
[Music]
whatever supposed to play it since again
I always think of things sucks
give me a few moments
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
nice
yeah I said I have no idea what I'm
supposed to do
am I supposed to heat them together like
this now
I'm in front of this puzzle
I did it once okay
that worked somehow
[Music]
I don't know what kind of difference
[Music]
I miss hitting randomly and in terms of
hours
[Music]
all right
[Music]
so it worked again I don't know what I
did
it just does something
[Music]
at least the flashing has stopped at the
moment
I don't know if it stops and now the
buses come
May but the either I don't know
they did it
some I don't know how
I don't know how that bus works it's
just I defeated the bus without knowing
what I was doing
okay
so fast you did it let's go
okay now we got
trick worlds or desert world
what's it what's the next World to play
Celebrate
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
the tricky world or the deceptive world
settling on desserts it's just dessert
the Sandy oil the only tricky ones
my audience choose whichever you are
fancy first one to pick guess the cheese
[Music]
dessert sure why not
I am
idea was Sandy yeah let's go with Sandy
bye
since I kept the cheese why not
squish it
this is yeah this is what I mean with
being like while it's not really wild
west
I don't know what is this I can grab it
I can hold it
just only like that
I pull the plug
and I fell down
the music
High School
if I take that means that if I take
damage now it's kind of
um
oh no it has a range attack
to make double house
no I walked into a cactus
so by jumping on this it should
feel the phone
[Music]
I should get the extra time for doing
that wait what does this do
oh those freezes the birds
so I can't fall down
[Music]
there you go
Stitch please both so I'm not sure
sideways
[Music]
no I could have done that
if I didn't if I went a little more
closer
[Music]
again I stepped over the air
which resulted in rwm and I walk it off
with other rabbits but the time was up
anyway
this is the first level I don't know
nine years need to be a bit more careful
and be a bit quicker pulling this up
even bird noises
no no I fell down
as well
do the other thing again
stop
that's that
I messed up too much today
wow hopefully without messing up too
much
and that's the start
this out
and this time I should try to not fall
down these holes
sometimes that happens
don't run into the cactus
there's a big hole here
[Music]
jump jump okay
it's a good thing there's always a
solution to these things
I mean that wouldn't
communication real well okay
okay
[Music]
sideways okay let's do this one a bit
more proper
[Music]
walking into practice again
falling after this
I need to be a bit more careful I feel
nice
there's good
I'm walking into the next characters
they're so big and then on the path a
lot of homes here
should come and eat them
so it was the first level
one minute 37 seconds plus all the
failures
okay
so
for this one
oh yeah I need better timing
there you go
I should just be able to work too even
though it's technically munching and
actually leaves less space yeah let's
say nothing
so these bunnies cannot swing
but I guess that worked
and walking into characters
can I just jump over this
that's very fancy
so yeah
at the same time
[Applause]
I mean that that low level of water
should they find nothing
with these bunnies
so
let's see how
look at this
can I do this no that makes it taller
outside
oh I need to do this from the spelling I
see
what
there we go
okay now I know what to do
if now I should dance a little bit
quickly
one more try this time I'll do it
there we go
please
what
watch out for these scorpions
avoid
thank you
storm
[Applause]
just to be sure
and now
I don't know what to do
I'll start all right now
you can't reach me
oh
so
planning from such a tall high thing
it's squishy so let's see here
so I can't get up on that
so
I can jump forward
[Music]
good
getting rid of the evil scorpions
that understands
thank you
so anything interesting going
on
anything yeah you would like to share
[Music]
so yeah if I start on this one
I might be able to get up on this yeah
that worked
this puzzle isn't hard enough for my
brain
and uh
still jumping with bows as long as
there's not a puzzle requiring me to
only jump around and not the other
so
what does this thing
scaring away fat
oh yeah let's all right there's an egg
and there's a hammer
this is going to be great
let's combine it and
this cannot be good for the baby
mother
or father
why am I supposed to
be found
I think you know what I'm supposed to do
with this you're my student
now I Leave You To Die
because you don't have any real parents
because we've got four and the two
Earnest one okay so I need a timing here
part I use the trick of pressing myself
against the thing and I need to do that
it's a trick that works
in a lot of games
and I guess we need to step on this at
the same time
and
in today
shouldn't that be the four seven
with and then no wait the music world
also had a learning like that in the
third one so into the cave
because they tend to have something like
that for the
air for the
yeah this solution was pretty simple
[Applause]
okay it's actually
it pulls like that I should probably
have given myself a bit more
oh let's see
if I push it like this
they're almost touching you can reach
reach out to each other
we restart the power and touch each
other hold hands quite safe
does this work
ice cream supposed to get past
[Music]
oh
that sour cream is supposed to get past
okay that's
foreign
[Music]
I will try to make you
okay
that was a thank you
accidentally stepped on it twice I'm
sorry about that
okay good luck on each other again and
this time I will not paint
I I did fail sorry about that again
bye okay
um
let me switch to this
I said like that
you need to take this
and then I press this one
I shouldn't touch it again that's why
don't touch it and then I touch that one
again okay
and it's I need to press the first one
and the third one
and not touching the second one good
luck
have fun on your ride
and don't mind that you crash two times
before it won't happen again
playing jump
I mean technically you did fresh one
more time so
I need the fires
can I can I grab the end of this
let's blow up the last one there we go
stay away from the lotion I don't walk
into the fire
disgusting oh I see I move this over
running out
and then it release
I have more time
and here's a big door okay there's
either key on explosion what should we
pick
it's it's really quick this one
I did it
and then and then I fell into the water
okay so if you start on this one and
then oh excited crap all right you can
see that
oh it doesn't dance isn't that fun
so okay
because they are separated okay
something were connected that would be a
more interesting puzzle I guess
I'm thinking puzzles are more advanced
than they are
okay now we're coming into the cave with
the bus
If the previous bus on the jungle level
was a Rock Island what would the boss be
on the desert level which contains a lot
of rocks and ending in
and a rocket tunnel
the penis angry
and
Chestnut doesn't have any
reaction and never has a reaction
oh is that took them
Pole
is that what's called and it's flying
okay he actually has some reaction
watch out
are you going to be squished
okay
ancient statue Jean-Paul that doesn't
sound anything like those other impulses
okay let's see are they cream supposed
to
okay like that yes I guess cream's job
is to
take damage and waste time
I guess job is to pick up I am supposed
to wait I don't have a hammer
I dropped the hammer for some reason
I have to actually pass it you don't
have to do that anymore
wait why did you release it
I see
I'm rescuing you
I throw it with me I see I see so you
can do this and that cream can do it for
us
now just
stop getting hit
stop shooting
that was a great show
I'm trying to be glamorous
I'm not actually messing up more than
I'm clever
[Music]
they look so cute
look at this cute cream we should
screenshot that
what's up
stop getting hurt now seriously okay
okay another just cheating
[Music]
okay
everything was better before I started
throwing the hammer
about taking cream she doesn't even have
the hammer
that's just
this is rude
[Applause]
that don't touch screen
I've got to have
it okay
I need to jump I picked up the clock
and it doesn't work like a spider when
you get extra time when they cut the
preach at zero it's
already has the
other time in the why are you standing
there
what is that working
I need to drive better
yeah I should focus on this
I thought that would count
I almost done
my area
and she hasn't done anything you just
run around here
evil are you some kind of evil boss or
something
oh
hey can I
also focus on cream getting done
um
who needs to hammer
pick it up together
and leave this place
[Music]
oh
now it's in really quickly
for some reason
I think it saved really quickly last
time as well
with that
level complete we have the Water World
s
do you want to go to the water world or
stick world
it's all up to you first person to say
something gets their will
[Applause]
when I drink something
[Applause]
I know I said nothing about you you
having to choose which next world is but
that's how it works now
a bit of um viewer interaction I guess
I'm in the mall kind but
[Music]
I mean I guess we're going through every
level everywhere anyway well the game
isn't too long
foreign
hours so far so
[Applause]
but we're left well okay we have the
Water World
with hippos and barrels and
things and then it got a trick world
with card Wheels good cobblestone
let us add your choices whichever looks
most interesting
to continue on
[Music]
whether the choice is valid if you have
to go
uh later on water is water is nice the
bonus doesn't like water
the pink hippos though
Reaper horses
okay I guess the problem with the water
bird
there's a lot of Watchers
and bells found out into the water
can't do that
but yeah
yeah I cannot stand on it
all right okay
this is going terribly
yeah I didn't expect that
Don't Drown already
okay if I yeah
and then the
yeah and then it shows up and then I can
stand on it because that's what you do
with animal system and then I open the
gate
foreign
I guess you're not allowed to stab it
with the gates
a snake
two snakes done some water watches
no don't do it again
the chestnuts fell into the water wait
no I didn't have something all over
[Music]
it's crocodiles
pour this one
he slipped into the water okay
yes
please grab it
I guess that I guess that's the
the game is fun except for when I just
refuses to grabbing on the stuff yeah a
Pity picky about scrubbing
things
but you have to do stand and things
okay
all right I forgot to learn all day
please wait for me
ventilator
now I have three minutes wasting half a
minute on that death
wasting a full minute
[Music]
I cannot kill
a matter of distance
thank you
[Music]
probably I I didn't I didn't press it
she slipped into the water
I tried to burn
hopefully the snake doesn't show up
the snake is showing up can you jump
over here
two seconds left
I do like that you can grab anywhere
on the Rope
I don't like how thick it is though but
aside from that it's great
[Music]
I'm not here
foreign
[Music]
world
about that
that was interesting
wait don't spawn me I mean that's that's
a cheating spawning with next step snake
okay I see this I do this
at least get me a chance to move
before you attack me
what
I thought I could save that
jumped around the barrel
uh
I guess okay
I see a lot of time now
I didn't do that
I didn't enter the platform where the
bottom cares a solid ground
all right
let's take the safer route around that
hot case
I'm gonna feel sicked off again
grab it grab it thank you
and then we need a
pack a little like snake
or no snake other snake oops
foreign
hey oh panda
hello welcome
nice to see you here I'm
just currently failing at this game I'm
dying a lot
um
but I like that
take another
[Music]
spin around
with the timer so I cannot see the
comments
because I'm currently playing uh
jump to the wrong character
since I'm playing on an actual
PlayStation
foreign
gems
[Music]
now
[Music]
yeah if you've already just like cut off
half half the pictures you only see my
attract the movie
and without the context that I'm
actually controlling both at once it
would look like a really bad
but arguably I'm a really bad players
this is why so
[Music]
this happens
okay just that
putting cream over
riding arrived okay
when is this close enough about that
awesome
in front of the girl
[Music]
and run into the tree
and was this the first level this was
the first level and I struggled so hard
with it I don't know I don't want to
know what the second level is
oh okay
Alice cream has a bit less water now
if I stand on this in flowers
[Music]
it's cream heavier than just that or
you're the only person
yeah
I mean
that's producing show that they have the
same way
is that all you can do
it
[Music]
run free run
no don't sleep
that was the thing you weren't allowed
to
you're allowed to run
all right
[Music]
okay I need
[Music]
Chestnut come over here I need help with
this thing
okay
Solid Ground
[Music]
okay I I landed on that okay I landed on
it and then I slipped off
that was nice
I didn't need to jump upstairs it's okay
okay I need what am I supposed to do
here how is cream supposed to get
together
oh I see I should
jump in this spot
and that activated style for some reason
and then
and then this happens same reaction a
cutscene because I cannot control them
again
[Music]
the first part was harder when it came
to that thing because
the platform use student to lower
stood until there to lower and went into
the water
actually then
I haven't tested standing on it for too
long so it actually seems completely
into the water I'm not sure if that's
impossible
I would assume so because that actually
would make it harder
but maybe they didn't Okay so
something's interesting with this thing
here
[Music]
oh
this isn't really hard I made aside
Family actually
about there
[Music]
Let's ignore that okay
Health cream Chestnut stock top indicate
that thank you
and then next to me again
I guess I have to go back
go back to your side
Adventures
and it
face first I don't use this to really
yeah
I I guess part of the game is actually
trying to control those characters at
the same time
more than trying to figure out puzzles
[Music]
I guess if someone wants
around for just collecting all the
remaining pieces
so and let's see what does this do
anything okay
oh wait if I continue to spin it maybe
close
[Music]
it looks like in the spin it will
correct me
index fabulary
can I get that from there
[Music]
at the same time
and then I assume this is just like this
and then there's a cat from there in the
water for some reason this was a much
easier level
and that was the third one
now the fourth level before the bus the
water level bus I wonder what that is
okay we have a thing here
we got a thing here
I see
as well
that is my excuses
okay that that was a completeness I see
I'm just gonna know what this girl
then if I start on this side yeah like
that
foreign
[Music]
I miss I don't know
the one who didn't know I'm not a native
English speaker probably obvious from
the way I'm pronouncing things
and I don't remember save it
and I don't remember what everything is
called
wait should I just press on this button
on the left to another without any time
anything
and eat the crowns this circle
circles
circles and
droplets puzzle wait a minute
again
this is pure random
wait this doesn't work give me some
letters
how am I supposed to solve this
it's just random
at least if it couldn't get repeats yeah
here we go finally
but
I suppose I'm
oh yeah
oh
okay that was a company today
come on cream you can do it Chestnut eat
it just jump in the ring
and then Chestnut drives this thing and
the cream can I think
I am I supposed to bring this in to the
hippo
and and cream cans
oh you can't do that maybe maybe you can
okay
like that yes
[Music]
I'm supposed to do with this thing
okay
yeah thank you
can you move please thank you
there you go that worked
if you're talking about the metals sing
It's called
well that's how I spell it that doesn't
explain how I would pronounce it and I
would say I would guess
encore
anchor
Uncle anchor maybe it's a dialect
Deliverance Maybe
yay hello arimian welcome back
please
now this audio is very quiet
it's very quiet segment a very quiet for
the wind
is it a whirlwind a water wind water
world
pelvis torpedo
that at least sounds more
matching the other bus names
what's
whatever it is on your your plan got to
be the water
and now he's mad or nothing that's not
mad that's the uh
completely wrong emotion this that's the
uh
don't like what this is feeling emotion
that's not
something so I'm supposed to
half the bombs with cream
habits
and I'm completely failing at this
it's coming pick it up
as soon as you pick it up like that yes
and then squish it together and then I
throw it
and mix this
I don't think you're supposed to say
eyes but
my English nieces
yeah this is going totally
so I still have to control the cream
okay so that should I start in its Mouse
Maybe
he torpedoed me
and then
oh it's eating the camera
oh oh I can't hold multiple bombs that's
good
it doesn't work
it explodes on the water so
yeah this is for the first try I mean I
guess it's not terrible I guess it's
really hot controlling my cream is going
okay that doesn't care about it I still
had to really figure out how I should
hurt him
it
um that's right so wait I said anchor
and anchor do you mean the first or
second okay and we're gonna need a
bigger boat yeah this is a tiny pot I
think cream should also have a boat I
mean if cream stood on that boat she
could pick up the bombs from the water
and yeah it would make the whole level
easier it become easy and then we're
going to need a bigger boat so with some
cute bunnies
yeah
yeah it's very important to keep the
bunnies up to it
that can push the bombs
but that doesn't have much
try to push them into cream it's
definitely away
yeah just peeking
it's hard enough trying to hit the bus
well don't eat the defenseless bunny
now she's not against this no she has
bombs
three of them four of them now I just
need to figure out how I'm supposed to
as happy as well you're just playing
around there around the waterfall
hopefully I don't see we saw the bombs
as soon as I do the first hit I was so
close
I was supposed to ask
I guess it seems the bombs do explode
on this surface
I'm supposed to hit it while it's
surfaced
now let's call it
okay kind of show them very fine
okay
and it's messing around at this point
I only got a few seconds now
practicing the bomb pickup
that was terrible
the first one anchor
anchor
yeah that would be the American
pronunciation
probably shouldn't serve them at
Chestnut
he deserves some bomb throwings
some bumps some bombs thrown at him
he can steer his boat parties look at
the terrible he's
our cream house is alive but
you're going to be a noticeable friend
but
um Chestnut is going to be the one
driving basically every vehicle that is
because he's controlled with the left
stick so you're going to control the
vehicles with the lipstick and then
cream is going to handle mostly the
aiming
since that will then be controlled with
the human rights
and now I'm doing Italian
and you lose basically a hit point every
half minute
this basic sounds a bit like crash
Bollywood
yeah this yeah
I got one but seriously not the
direction
[Music]
wait where did these clocks come from
I'm wasting so much time the game isn't
giving me time
okay this is currently the hardest boss
it's only only due to the water controls
because I would have picked them up if
there was a double wall in the way these
bumps are too close to the
edge so I cannot get cream to run into
them
no no she's inside of us
I guess did that work okay I actually
didn't manage
or maybe the clocks showed up because I
think
okay so cream has to pick up the clocks
as well that's going to be annoying
yeah
you're the one doing the best
come on there's like two hit points
where's
time
and
okay
I just threw away that bomb
uh
what would make this easy I would be if
the area
how close you have to be to the bombs
were made
the area you have to collide with the
bombs were much larger than the bombs
are
uh is that in front of me
yeah like that that should have been
counted as a pickup
because the game is a bit too picky look
how close you need to be
okay can you
not like that
that's called her theme song
yeah could you you're wasting my time
foreign
do my best
let me take something to drink
and a bit
and starch
and for anyone new here which I didn't
mention before there's one and a half
second lag because I'm
streaming
I'm sending the footage from the console
to the computer adding one and a half
second leg to it but I didn't find a way
to delay my own audio so my reactions
can be a second too early
but hopefully it's not too distracting
am I already out of time
foreign
[Music]
but I'm trying
oh
I missed
doesn't pick up
so we'll be here all day oh
no no no no no
but I don't have much time left anyway
but
there we go
finally
yes now I just need to find a way to
pick up this only
[Music]
it's so hard to pick up the time as well
after getting it
yeah if I want to see me struggle here
we go
everything went so well with the rest of
the game though
now here's the real challenge
that was the wrong way
aiming shouldn't be that hard
okay I tried something there
at least that didn't count as getting
hurt so
at least I have that on my side
we have pickups
I release an update to this game
it's on a PS2 game therefore anything
updates
you have the games they should make a
remake of this one
well it looks like you know when to
throw the bombs now yeah I
kinda know but sometimes it feels like
it should hit when it doesn't
have the fight right there
half the fight is to know when to throw
the bat and bounce house
bumps
like that should that count
[Music]
wait it got hurt by something
come on green the food has to be easier
if you could move cream a bit
regardless direct Direction
I love her angel
it's only for Amy
nothing else
I like that to count let's take it down
oh yeah
and that doesn't work
I get that that didn't count as a pickup
okay
okay take this one
don't get eaten
that you can't just give me damage
basically Landing right on top of his
head
[Music]
yeah I don't have enough time at least
you get some practice in picking up the
bumps I guess so
feel like I'm getting slightly better
if only you could adjust the length of
that rope yeah that would help
there's only
two sticks and two buttons in the whole
game there's
so the at least there are no secret
buttons I could use
I guess that's the thing
I watched a few
uh
don't get eaten
I guess that did work
anyway yeah I watched a few people play
Spyro
yeah
and the problem when they placed that
they don't know and we have made the
Aspire has and
because the game is kind of bad at
telling different ones
not like that
that was a nice one
collected that clock yeah pretty if only
I could pick up bounces these things
that
you've got the second one as well
I actually got that bone okay
I guess I'm getting better at this
at least the chestnut doesn't get hurt
which I guess
I'm fat
what are you doing
all right why are you attacking me
yeah can you like stand still so I can
still bumps at you please
please please service
should I should I attack it when it does
the happy something
it's currently just lying you know oh
now it's surface like and then it does
that and that's it
thank you
they of course not work
why did I take damage from that
no don't push me away from the clock
and that's the edge of the map so I
cannot move further
okay that that that's just cheating
I shouldn't have gotten hit by that
and then it pushed me away from the
clock of course
like I can't I can't move further than
this
I cannot reach the bomb start I always
all right
what's up let's let's see if I can pick
up these things
I should pick up the girls outside
focus on here
no no no what are you doing
stupid fish
hey I got the clock so namaste
where's the fish
oh there it is
n't that countless
damage or something
let's see what that's had the map
and now it's surfacing when I'm not
holding above
slam take your clock thank you step
still not picking up any bones
now it's surfacing a lot when I don't
have bumps which of course makes sense I
mean if it was a real real enemy it
wouldn't really
really what it's for the big deal is why
is it attacking in the first place
this is like its area
where it lives and it got angry that I'm
invading this area
so why does it live somewhere with this
much box that doesn't seem safe
yeah
hey
and then it's exploding
at least I'm doing much better now
focus on Instagram
yes there you go
and I got the top at least the clock
stopped thankful
thankful for that
let's let's get out of here
it's falling sinking down through the
bottom let's bring some bombs with us as
well
oh there it is that's the thing you
should
be
took it's time to show up but everyone
finally
that's a hard boss level yeah just
picking up the bumps and throwing them
that's that's
really hard part now of course
controlling them
because you only use cream in that boss
battle
okay
the Arctic world or the trick world
and after either I don't have to spin
around the long way
talk
[Applause]
dancing
or flailing let's see what those are
patapata
[Music]
okay that's
you did good thank you so trick world or
Arctic World
those are the two options trick world
yeah let's go with trick World it sounds
tricky I'll probably die a lot
[Applause]
I'm not sure if dying is the correct
term in this game
two votes for trick world
no I'm not ready I'm drinking a bit
and that's also common singing games
when they're counting down and you
cannot pause the game
that should be allowed Arctic world is
too slippery oh oh
yeah let's avoid it
it's not like I will have to play it at
some point
wait a minute
I think I press this one I can because I
see
about how tricky
[Music]
and then I press this button
ah I see
okay
a very tricky level
yeah I'm not knowing the other pieces
for now
all right that's an enemy
the corner
I am the same thing for this one
if it had some indication even though
that one should I mean quite obvious
if it has some track or something on the
ground showing which way it swings that
might help a bit
too
like this one cute swinging both way but
I assume it spins that way
but this is
the the pasta so I need to
wait no
cream
okay we got something here
[Music]
I can't do that I need to spin quickly
[Music]
you can't spin it the correct way
[Music]
and fell down
oh
I guess so I guess so
two round thing two two rounded to
standing okay let's do the first part of
it
[Music]
please stop
that's that's harassment and then
deposit pieces
which I mean ignoring are only for bonus
and not play
the
I don't want to face it I you can't land
on this to get rid of them
no I thought
act by so many enemies yeah so I don't
have anything on that
and uh
I messed that up
[Music]
start up with you
so that was a way to pick up that clock
I lost it immediately
[Music]
okay now
[Music]
thank you
this is the
assistant oh it's because
[Music]
if I wait long enough I want to get
access to those but that's also a waste
of time
thank you
okay
this is about timing
okay
already out of time
and that's our way okay now I know how
to do that
let's do it for real and this time
without getting hurt by every single
enemy
so far so good
come here
what's up
because I'm spending more time trying to
pick it up and then I guess it was a
girl later
they Race Against Time
but but they landed on the ground and
they spotted to died from it so I didn't
that went by
sometimes
[Music]
so far
doing much better afternoon
[Music]
oh I see what I think
requesting those buttons
making the fog foreign
that was part of that
[Music]
oh I see I see
I moved it away
get cream up on it I still don't
measures
and then
okay
and and
now
I'm confused
I guess the height
is enough
points so if I just erase this one like
this
I guess the heart is enough to get over
yes
and then
I just had to do it yourself
like that
what's up now
there you go and I actually have to go
through that
I did it
stage one
what
I have to find the complete the level oh
it was only stage one there's three more
stages
this looks tricky it sounds like it's a
cheap one
no there's another way oh pretty much
she made it
[Music]
personal time
okay so far so good
okay do this together
I get why these fences are low so you
can use your seat over them but it
really looks like there are only going
to jump over them
[Music]
this doesn't seem much of a challenge
what was the point of that
oh look at this machine
wait
sounds this seems like something I would
expect from
the final level
all right press this ah
so
I need to respond to the center okay
so they control the wheels each of them
control their own wheel so to turn you
have to move forward one and backwards
on the other
that's a bit tricky they don't touch the
sticks the choiceless
they're stunning
Adam
tell me to pick this up
thank you
I got 345 seconds
wrong way
the wrong way again
I got so much time like I can waste it
on this puzzle piece
and then
forward
towards the goal
is that quite an interesting way of
controlling it it's not the most
convenient way that it works
[Music]
can I get through here
without having to destroy everything
a large girl
I did it
I Should Have It reversed into the girl
put it on the wrong side
I should read the comments
if only you had this strap tank thing
for that fish bus I think that that tank
would fall into the water
so I don't think it would be that useful
and but for the other buses
but that's why I kind of insane anyway
kind of kind of that totem pole was
tricky
there were
in that block anyway
characters
what's a character
[Music]
the tank was tall enough to not be
entitled it I would disagree that water
was really deep
plus it's possible that the machine
would break due to all the water
it's an enemy Final Fantasy oh
all right
that's interesting I didn't know about
that
pry this in the Earth
all right
I remember because he cannot step on the
tracks
because then they get electrocuted
wait I wanted it to restock
oh that's how I'm supposed to get stuff
on it okay
one more try
[Music]
wow
there is no chain there
[Music]
okay let's ignore the clock
what I found level it's actually quite
yeah
I just have to stop messing up so much
Korea
[Music]
oh yeah
I'm supposed
I completely messed that up
supposed to do now
[Music]
it is quite the tricky level
[Music]
[Music]
okay okay
[Music]
[Music]
these things
[Music]
I guess the train would press the button
or something
I see myself should use this one
together on the train
oh wait the train comes from there I
thought it was supposed
[Music]
it's a bit trickier than I thought
I think I made a joke about it being a
three points too many times
[Music]
oh
[Music]
yeah yeah there you go
now the direction of the chain has
changed and then there's something with
this key I don't know what
now
and then there's something with this
buttons
there it comes this one should turn off
yes
good train
thank you
and here comes
oh that's what it does
ah thank you train
that was really funny
[Music]
and then watch out for that crazy card
I need to pick up
and I'm here to wait for the next train
and I don't know if I had enough time
for that
but just that will continue without
I don't know what their relations are
uncomfortable
if they're friends siblings
partners
oh there's a trainer
I said
oh there's a new card
okay there's a button here
and it's low it raises the barrier and
it keeps it up it's a queen can I also
goes through
okay
[Music]
that did work
I thought they were siblings
has that been confirmed anyway
I don't think the introduction explain
their relationship
nice
[Music]
so look at the switch here
now it's dark
wait wait I should do this
and this is a little fence you can jump
over
and then I guess I turn it off for some
reason like this I don't know I'll see
what it does
oh yeah I need to turn it off for this
part because this is our electric
you can tell it by the black and yellow
stripes
wait a minute
oh oh yeah Queen good luck with this
Braxton
okay
[Music]
even the cream have the spikes chestnuts
okay this is still working
ah let me try again I'm wasting too much
time
I shouldn't practice a bit more like
this
nice I assumed it there
oh
[Music]
yeah
maybe cream should jump into it first
[Music]
jumping over this stuff okay
I should focus a bit more um Chestnut
this time
even though he's behind the clock
what is
foreign
[Music]
stuff on again
so these at this uh electric doors
[Music]
I could jump through it before
oh
yeah and then this has been changed I
need to go back and finished power off
okay
and now I can jump over this again
okay sounds things suspicious about
these things
[Music]
Junior
okay
oh yes you did it okay this is the other
level now another vehicle
and that's all they can and that's all
I'll
I didn't even try it it was driving
itself
[Music]
like one meter half a meter or something
purple mouses yeah they're mouses oh
there it is they're drawing real fast
this should be some kind of trick
uh monster
some kind of mechanical namaste
oh no
cream is really big ears Reckless toy
breather
breather
I didn't I read his full name I was
confused by the breathing part
and you're basically trying this one the
same as the other one
what's the catch Park
oh that's how I did
like that
piece
no wait a minute
don't try this at all
now I see how the controller works
that's why I had such trouble in front
of me
cream is doing the
accelerating and breaking
and reversing while it's just not it's
doing the turning
this bus is in another one
because you don't have to do that
come down
all right what's happened
yeah come down and fight oh
contacting
ice I got away
give me something
thank you
thank you
give me something more
this isn't even hard but it's possibly a
standing here
slowly reversing
give me something
one more
there we go
what a silly boss battle
very different from
[Music]
very very different from that box
challenge
[Music]
so that's uh
two and a half hours I guess you'll be
able to continue with
maybe we managed to do the two last
worlds
foreign
[Music]
should I do next
[Applause]
[Music]
and magical worlds Arctic World
here's a challenge no timeout run
I mean if you're doing a speed run
that's kind of a no time around
[Music]
I would assume
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
against magic you want magic
looks like a fun place
against the fish now time out run
against the fish I mean I assume they've
made meant throughout the whole game
beautiful
this looks more like a
H yeah this is Monica
amusement parks
wait I think this slab this one is kind
of tricky
even though it's not the truthful
oh
no that wasn't the way
one of these opens up oh I did it
correctly
then jump down
that I
I used to do it
on the other side
you can jump out
I think it's enemies
oh yeah and then there's this cannon
place the house there
[Music]
actually press the button this one let's
destroy the window
and then this part I don't understand
that's slowing
this is okay
[Music]
as you speed it up
it goes higher
[Music]
but
I don't know it goes faster than that
but the problem I have with this
is that I actually did it on the first
time
is that I have always had such a hard
time
now it started the wrong way
all right I see I see
what I was supposed to do
it was going in the correctly
[Music]
we will over here a little crazy
and then we moved over here is a much
easier one
the arm game he says I harmonics
that's just not continue my dream is
waiting for the bridge
oh yeah this is the part where you have
to guess where you're supposed to go
[Music]
just not good
so I did cream I guess it wasn't that
hard
pressure position from these things
okay this is going to be the biggest
challenge of this now
okay that was easy so maybe I should
just maybe I should just focus on that
longer one I might be able to jump all
the way over there
okay
let's see what you wrote here
what's your hair but the fish bus was
brutally it was brutally
and then it breaks
are you in the carousel
as far as I could see a different Bridge
luckily it didn't break
I think I'm also supposed to stand like
on the roof of that thing to get extra
height
but
it farted
there's one benefit of clipping through
is that it's easy to tell where he is
I thought it's hard to keep track of it
but
[Music]
okay
so
if I don't do that
[Music]
if I stand on the roof instead leave for
quickly
is it a connection between blue and fast
I didn't even try to take that piece
all right
let me quick enough
so now this time I basically jumped into
the scene into the arm game I don't need
to go down and slow down
[Music]
how many times can I press a quickie
button
[Music]
it feels like it should be here
I also feels like it's
[Applause]
big enough
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
um okay
I fell off it
okay
see I wasn't that easy I'm messing up
somehow I mentioned on the first time
but then I failed it
[Music]
[Music]
this game isn't that good sounds so
while you're working with something
or the attack
so slow
[Music]
jumps through the window
because I do need it
[Music]
okay
this is
pretty high anyway
so maybe I don't need it to the cricket
with me or is the game
[Music]
was it timing now now it was at the
bottom
so
however that things
[Applause]
oh yeah now I see it
that's awesome
[Music]
being basically had to be okay now the
time is better because now but I I
didn't expect
[Music]
wait how couldn't they die from that
[Music]
Autumn game
it doesn't say I'm proud
[Music]
no this doesn't say uh
it was too far away uh
[Music]
wait how was that I missed this one I
thought that was
noun
as far as I can take the Shadow the
shadow is strength I love it
into this song like that
it is
[Music]
wasted enough time
[Music]
that was pretty simple
let's see a quick cream
can get through this
[Music]
is the wrong way
that is the correct way
okay as I said last time I should only
focus on day one first away I should
maybe be able to get it yes
that
[Music]
okay and here's the code
I did it
oh
chestnuts is gonna get sick speed now
fast yeah
can bunnies get sick like
a motion sick
spinning six
this is a spoon
we need to make a
upon a motion sick the science
so this ghosts I only probably need to
take them one at a time
not like that okay just next time
that works
[Music]
so that was a great job
because it gets more funny when I read
them comments after failing
but thank you for
everything
[Music]
recognizing the effort I have no idea
how to say it
whatever
paragraph phrase it is
I do appreciate the words
so what's the what's the points here
can you can can he let me attack you
okay
there's cheating okay
[Music]
am I supposed to like grab onto it or
something
[Music]
cheating girls yeah
and then then that was nice
watch doubtfully
spiky balls
at work
that's never taking me
[Music]
thank you
yeah exactly
because
so that made it so much easier for some
reason okay let's continue
okay okay
I have just been once anything can
happen
nope
but I better follow me to perform it
wait a minute how does that work
[Music]
s
it's been backwards One Step oh passage
this doesn't make any sense at all
watch out for the falling ladders
yeah Queen just got hit in the head with
uh
it's
cream got hit in the head with a large
metal rods or something
oh yeah and that means that I can now
yeah like this
thank you
I did it
comes everywhere get to the girl
timer is that again am I supposed to get
over that thing
[Music]
okay that was a failure but now I know
what I'm supposed to do so this will be
much easier
I got some practice
attract ice
[Applause]
okay let's see you know what happened
okay yes oh God
I hopefully that's something
[Music]
and now I need to
I don't really wish up which way
yeah it was that way
okay
from a long how far out you need to put
it
[Music]
[Music]
well I I forgot about that thing again
okay
this is supposed to be the girls
it's very shallow
I guess we'll see
no this isn't good
[Music]
it was just something
I'm gonna do here
foreign
[Music]
again
[Music]
but it was enough to get into the girl
foreign
[Music]
seconds
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
sup
let's move on to
stage three
[Music]
oh
I got it twice
I can't see it now I gotta see it
okay now I'm messing up
this level is trickier than trick world
okay
let's do this gorilla round cream round
cream
[Music]
and Chestnut
okay what is this thing doing
[Music]
okay
I need something
oh it stands in the middle thank you or
not
bam okay now I didn't want you to walk
into it
okay you can't walk under it I guess it
worked and then
oh
both fell down at the same time
[Music]
I think I did that pretty well
[Music]
that was it wasn't me on this thing
yes
[Music]
so it's just that bouncing being in the
way
[Music]
okay concentrate
oh about what happened
[Music]
no what what
my biggest problem with that part
[Music]
is how deep
the platform moves without moving you
wow
[Music]
okay that worked
somehow
grab the Antiques
and I think I was supposed to
jump off it
okay
okay one more try
okay
another carrot starch
let's make
it
not again too quick
[Music]
now
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
please
[Music]
like this this one's
[Music]
that I got no
stop stop taking damage bye
okay now
okay come on Kareem you can do it
yay
and this looks a bit scary
it's about something scary
ah I see I see
come on come on
when you stop chasing
thank you
okay okay
they are attached to each other
so I basically have to go at it at the
same time or something
[Music]
I think that's the first restart
it's such a terrible stock
come on
[Music]
okay
[Music]
that's extra time this is
[Music]
[Music]
that that's your name
you can be a coconut
hey who's
said he could hurt chestnuts all right
come on twice
here
I got the clock but the damage at the
same time so it's
canceled out each other
concentration time
so much for concentrating okay
at least I got bad
to the damage once
I hope everything is working on the
stream while I'm playing
so it doesn't stop streaming or
something that would be terrible
being a
being paranoid at all here
[Music]
I'm actually surprised how it runs
because when I when I first because to
make the whole
to be able to get the footage from the
console
I have to use a capture card and when I
first installed it
and after the installation was done the
computer got a blue skew the very first
blue screen I've ever seen gotten as
since I missed it ever
[Music]
and then
while that made the computer restart I
guess
and then next time and then when it
start got started up again and I started
the
program
[Music]
oh yeah
[Music]
because he doesn't want to come back
unless both of them are back
so I have to make this with both of them
not just one
[Music]
anyway so after completely put it up
again and I
started off the program again to
actually use it for the first time
anyway
[Music]
very shortly after it got blue screen
again
so hello
something with the program itself but
however I have not changed anything
since then and now it's just working
Works flawlessly
so I don't know what was going on
so well I'm happy it's working so
[Music]
I'll just continue this before one at a
time
[Music]
good job
I do wish these Springs had Shadows so I
could see more I mean I guess they have
feet
[Music]
purpose
[Music]
[Music]
okay
[Music]
hey they did it okay now
these bears do you want some bunnies to
eat but no bunnies for you this time
okay let's see
[Music]
what does this day
I count it that way
I can't do it that way wait what am I
supposed to do this
[Music]
okay not that way
that's why
this way okay
I see they go I just
flew over don't
delete there
[Music]
okay just not you need to hold this
thing
thank you
Stacy complete
[Music]
and now the last stage before I passed
bowel
and they're not I see some balls and
this isn't going to be great no I guess
these words
getting there
boom
oh yeah
reverse controls
okay
and also sleeper controls
[Music]
don't do that
wait why did this
why did this button is so close to the
edge that is more cheating
[Music]
the game the game likes the cheats
[Music]
yeah gives a great challenge
that was my fault
place a kiss
come on you can do it
[Music]
there you go down
push those clowns into the pieces that
day is yesterday
well because that happens I I push
myself down a bit can it please move I
need to press this button
which for some reason you're done
drinking
and can only be pressed once
I know I know the clouds coming
[Music]
oh yeah
yeah
planned on the spikes
spikes makes the ball is okay okay here
comes these things
[Music]
cannot get rid of that
okay
so if I move this
that's that and then I'm going to like
this and then yeah I need to now I need
it
I need to jump more diagonally
okay good teamwork
[Music]
so and now and now if I jump on this one
actually the first screen
oh it doesn't
it doesn't come off okay
no wait
why did Chestnut fall into water
[Music]
right
I was you put them very very close to
the edge every time
I hate drums through the thing that
doesn't make any sense
I just want to watch them fall in and
never to escape
you just
that's nice
yeah let's get rid of those clowns
[Music]
putting the Cannons shooting them away
nope nope
just left
look I just I just have to hurry
I press the button like I've got the
time okay
[Music]
hey I fell down through the platform
yeah now with that I know I don't care
what you climbed
I thought
I've honestly convinced you did tricky
Parts okay diagonal jump this time I
like that no idea
[Music]
okay okay
oh
just not died yet
[Music]
okay I guess that works
and then there's the candle to get back
don't jump into it
just go into the goal and then
do anything stupid
okay
we got another stack
what a magician
that two of them
okay
oh they're giving hammers too
clown performer double weasel so they
are weasels I was curious and what kind
of animal they were
this is
now they come to tricky part
foreign
so if there was a fake
I don't know it's just no way did I hit
the real one
it's five seconds
I actually don't know how this works I
guess that was
and if I picked the wrong one
never picked this one it's the wrong one
I get I get hurt but if I pick the
correct one that is not the fake one uh
it takes damage and I might speak to
correct one two times at the start
but
which one is the correct one if you'll
just look at them
oh it's that one who's attacking that's
the real one
maybe not
okay
that was the one that actually stood out
okay that one stands out foreign
okay what's going on
[Music]
okay I'm not if I'm not well I have no
idea am I supposed to attack like
the mirrored version of it
so
let's see
because it would be too obvious if they
weren't attacking
so if that one is attacking should I
like attack this one
okay
together
I could probably have attacked that one
too
okay
okay
I guess I figured out
I guess
thinking a bit more about it it kind of
makes sense
how am I supposed to get around these
okay I didn't really pay attention to
each of us I was focused on picking up
the clocks
there you go
it also feels a bit stupid
of
ten to make such a pattern
they should consider
[Music]
[Applause]
all right
that's making it obvious
cute boss
it's guacamole except with weasel like a
weasel
yep
so since it's been three hours now
I think this would be a good place to
end I think
there is not just a single word left
there is more than that
but it's not really a halfway through
the cane but
foreign
could be trickier and take more time
than I expect so
[Music]
[Applause]
so I wanted the game to be quiet I guess
I pressed that button and it gets great
yeah I've got to be late for me you got
to go to bed anyway yeah it must be late
for you
it's got to be lit I read that right yep
it's late for me gotta go to bed anyway
yeah
you did such a good job thank you I
appreciate the
compliments
and such
so
and this as I mentioned
last time
what I wanted to try
and what's this thing on Twitter Twitter
I was confused in twitch every time I
see Twitter I'm in twitch on
this thing on the twitch where you
basically read another Channel you bring
your viewers over and say hello to
someone else as you're closing down your
own
so I wanted to try that
and
um and the person I was thinking about
who is actually streaming now so it's
actually working is someone called
Noah's archives which is one of the
first streamers uh if you kind of
I it's part of a group more like who
who I got to encourage it's not that
they encourage me to stream but I got
this more
more for myself inspiring myself to
can I check what
okay okay
that's true uh that's uh inspired yeah
yeah that's that's the term
that's uh I didn't consider yeah
exactly he just started the game now so
that's I guess that's a good timing to
show up
uh
that's
oh that was that quick I I thought the
timer would be longer okay I guess it
moves
yeah
how does this whole thing works
okay
oh the time starts now okay I see how it
works okay I'm still learning a thing so
I don't actually have a raid message
using you basically post I don't know if
you know raids idea for that matter
but
um yeah
otherwise just write something about
bunnies I guess if you want to give some
kind of free message
there it is
I should have prepared it more but this
is first time that I used as a mosquito
my excuse
I can't even spell
and the timer is running out
and
it's yeah this doesn't work
there we go
something I don't know
okay and a few seconds left and then if
you switch over
see you
hopefully it works
what is this
this was what I wanted to write last
time
but it doesn't
where is the audio
all right
what was that it looked like
okay gotcha game I do like gotcha games
but Hello everybody welcome on
