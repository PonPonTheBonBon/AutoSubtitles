a few seconds I hope
everything started up game yet I'm so
lazy
I have it Stampy it's not a punishment
maybe some private some people remember
us last time
doing this knockout that I managed to
knock myself out
it is
still like training I'm just in my train
one I'll do the same trick as last time
I will
start a race and then I pass at the
countdown
happy to be here I'm happy that you're
here guys I forgot to
welcome you on
there finally
I think it's thin welcome
yes another night
I haven't put it on my headphones
the heads
that's what I forgot
get going straight in the game
and I hope the microphone is working
just let me know whenever I stream and
you don't hear my voice that just means
I forgot to Twitter
forget the microphone in some way
but I'll put the
the old trigger footing
what's the controller there it is
there
is
now I made it
this one
I don't know how much
this sound is muffled when I do this
but I can't see the game better which is
the most important reason
okay let's do this one go it came in
second last time so
let's see how when I do this
it's good get it
and yeah it's in it was mirror activity
no
sorry sister
yeah this is backwards too
and mirror
well
ah let's start
doesn't matter I have enough light
I can do this
I made a thing for life than this
okay as I said I suggestions everyone
into the game
a little bit
yes I want to complete this game
uh on the side
oh thank you
yeah it car is slightly broken
there's another night track there's
very short like one and a half minute
track this this would be quickly over
and then hopefully no more nice friends
please
and since I have to focus out well well
speaking of focus but I guess that was
the last night
and anyway he seems to have to focus up
are not on the driving
imagine right tracks I cannot even take
a peek at the chat
I said things
right
it's done like a six minutes race this
here so this would be quickly over
but for being a night track it's quite
quite lit up
but that's good
they have the lead
nothing big
yeah this
is not scraping along along the grounds
yeah
I don't want to fall down here
underneath
oh all right
three times in a row now
it's the curse
yeah that's probably it is my
tracks if I'm going into the wall
to go into one
[Music]
I like the
this part is very bright
[Music]
It's the final map
okay let's
let's not mess this up now
how well can you see this track on your
phone or something
oops that was a sign
um yeah especially when you're like
outside with your phone trying to watch
the Stream
you can see the UI let's see maybe the
car interior you can turn off by the way
it doesn't make a big difference but ah
yeah
speaking of messing up on the last snap
don't have to win I just need to not
come in last
nothing in my way get out of my way you
know I lost the position
congratulations
that's the the importance
I just need to take a picture it's a
night
of course it's night it's nights nights
after night and the star jacket as well
from the entrepreneur corner
okay I need to do that other track
throughout the race and like win the
money back
which was that this one
now
even though I've probably get a lot of
money from that
obviously like that it was this one
right
yeah is that too too laps
with this car
and then I got that much money
so I can repair my car
hello kitten head pads
oh
that's my crazy
we got this compound I think
at it I lost the position but
still at last
I do hope I win the tournament I just
need to slight break here
doing because I just need that car
it apparently because breaking the car
doesn't reduce the sound amount point
which is strange
it doesn't matter how much the opponent
breaks it or like how much I break it
for the opponents
but what the language you're using
I've actually removed the jewel number
spring
so it's
I mean you don't need to it's
swear just to swear or something like
that
that's not necessary but
it's nice oh God speaking of not losing
a car price takes place money yes
yes
that's how it plays
no no
it's being in there just park
I get a few million from this I just
need to catch up with the car again
[Music]
It's the final left
there we go
that's how you take care of the
competition
s yes when it sees that were the
food
I mean you could use the
case the Swedish again right
yep take out that sign
let me have a decide it's not like this
a bit naughty
naughty
we're all adults here it's fine
I use it all the time someone around
here I know what it means
I mean it's quite a famous word but I
guess after anyone else it's
[Music]
one of those words that I used to
even in like Germany
nuts need too common but
Sami is it
there you go
we won the race I know what it means
then you're the first person I met in
this stage you know what it means
oh yes I know uh congratulations it
means you have move on to the next time
[Applause]
no this is this is like I got this car
this is the car I wanted to like
the quickest another features because I
probably have to
and again
it's draining my money
oh yes I know what it means my neighbor
is Polish
yeah that that's what kurva means it
means my neighbor is up is Polish
oh my God yeah I got I got some a
[Music]
h
that's something
[Music]
completion
X3 silly
feet
do it
I don't know
I don't know what it sounds like
and that's Star Wars movie
laughing
So currently which I imagined before the
on the 20th the artists
said that he was going to draw it
however he I still haven't gotten any
artists regarding that
he seems to be busy with stuff and
that's fair enough
so you know I haven't paid for it so
so we'll see we'll see if it's anything
happens and they
shaking things up
yeah I do have that one
the one I enjoy myself
when I could try to draw some myself
and maybe I should have like an image
drawing stream I guess that's my next
choice thing that means
[Music]
to Captain Edison
you're going to be drunk at least
I'm facing up against lead food that
doesn't seem like a good idea to have
any reason
guys teams are fun when you think oh
maybe she did more often
nice
instead of these racing streams because
I got I guess the racist things are
probably the least popular of these
games I do
and
which I can't understand racing could I
like I like the racing games but
it's not like I need to traders in games
I can't vary I can shift
I can switch between doing some racing
and doing some drawing
I work tonight oh I don't know what for
today
[Music]
congratulations guys
no no not Sheldon that's not
did you go to the garage
that's my car
and that's
wait when I mean I don't need any of
these I can sell all of them oh it's
just a few quarters of a million
I think that was the all right on one
another time that's just a kind of one
maybe that was the card
I don't know anyway I'll send all these
I don't need them when I'm using this
now I have this mouse there you go
I really didn't need this one ID but
that means I should be able to
prepare this card
because I got
a loads of money
thank you
I am loaded
okay back to this
it's another night track so uh
prepare for that again
remember
one go
okay
yep
sorry about that
I didn't mean to do that
okay so it's night it is raining
I mean okay I guess there's nothing more
than that it's nice and it's raining
girl
I'm making strange noises
excuse me sir
okay I guess we take different parts now
what
um
I'm still keeping up oh
that I am in last position this season
too
and bad moments
very deep
so that's a good one
there we go
because you got that guy
we just have to
protect your team afterwards
that's
9 minutes 20.
my name is 20 seconds that's what I'm
going to say
to me it's 20 minutes that was a very
difficult to say
oh no
[Music]
problem
I can keep up
I'm keeping up I just
can't take this one
she honestly it's faster
sorry about that
whatever he's doing I don't care about
playing fan
[Music]
I am a bunny I for the bunny dudes
his name is
I really shouldn't drive this up here
because
I changed it
come on I just passed hippos
so as long as it's better like my key
I guess you're taking that part now
whoa whoa whoa line cars yeah that car
started burning
no
that that happens
oh it's almost running so I guess I
managed to take the leads through that
message as well
driving on the side
yeah
I guess it was just a
the driver had a fire extinguisher in
the car
just take out the fire the car is fine
maybe I should take the right side
that one yeah that worked too
[Music]
you can have one knife
It's the final lap
okay let's see if I can
keep this
I was assigned and that was a final
knife I went
quite a bright track anyway
into the car is very broken
after preparing it for me
I just hope the last track is in the
night track
come on
that card just stopped burning before
but now I got passed by
I'm not going to use the car that was on
the Fire
it's ridiculous
thank you
getting my way
and I did take a second position I just
had to win the last race then but
I mean I have to win the last three
Center
but to be fair the last race you will
stand side by side anyway
congratulations you placed second so I
guess it technique doesn't matter if you
can't come in first the second in this
place
all right
I did it I want you want the Sportsman
could you
redeem it early
could he have not have as much stream
delay
yeah focus on race

side
foreign
pulling off the dress
[Music]

the the
car caught on fire oh it's a nice riding
but it's at least not wet this time
night
[Music]
I like track of course it is
[Music]
no problem I found this solution
and this is
I'm using this sweater
to block out the lights
off the room
and it's just me
and that's right two ones go
fast explanation
probably should have
tell them I can do this
well
I didn't mean to do that
but I guess it worked out in my screen
right now
it's it's okay it's okay for me
[Music]
and then I'll just focus on
winning this race
[Music]
where is the track
there is no church this is dirt
took care of the sign
[Music]
that's not nice
sorry just because I could keep track of
the trash
made the track more obvious
okay
you need the parts are very familiar
with
these rocks
huh I'd say as I almost threw up come on
[Music]
um maybe I'm not that funny
okay
I accidentally drove into a rocket had
nothing to do with
I think
um
that it just happened
been on the first lap where's the girl
now here it is
so fine
here's when
[Music]
and if that guy tries to pass me I can
I guess I'll use another trick
[Music]
now I'm
buried at keeping fabulary
I don't know how many now I still even
with the wrong way
I'm very excellent
right off the track
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
maybe I should stay to the left
okay I have a car to the cab now
you're fast
started tuning into a rock before I must
say
all right pushing it right there
man
this left lap three
one night
I was able to pass you before the finish
line but in case I
mess up those rocks again
try this into one tea
and then there's this person off and
then
we can keep track of this through the
church
[Music]
the science device
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I just have to do that one more time
and then I will finally get a goat
and then I'm done with this nice drain
[Music]
just a bit more
[Music]
right that's not when I go straight

somewhere here
it just goes through
this blind
[Music]
because of its air under the car
no problem

a little slack there and yeah I get a
big corn in the day I know she feels
good to keep to the left
left
[Music]
jumps with those
and left and that was about the rocks
and I'm driving off the road I'm happily
still this is the most important
because through these final corners
[Music]

left

[Music]
congratulations thank you you've won The
Knockout you have been awarded to gold
medal

and I'm like I just draws full speed
straight into the rocky but then passed
me
and the uh the current outfit is not
over so the outfit is put on cute
I killed melon yes

behind me
I mean I don't when I have it open like

thank you if it was me University
closing
43 she she has full soccer dress
and then sits down in the car and just
her underwear right her racing on the
way
[Music]
she comes to distract the other drivers
because the other guys can't see her
all right
that wasn't but that one
at least the car doesn't get to destroy
the training into a while in full speed
but
[Music]
furnace nicely
it's almost drill into the water here
I think it's weird senses again
[Music]
I'm trying a bit in the garage
well I guess I'm driving here then
I don't know my mind starts
[Music]
press this blue lights there during the
play tracks
these are some blue lights here too
they have turned the blue they have to
turn the lights off during the night
Trek
this is
quite the opposite thing
yeah I should go straight like this
and yeah
[Music]
it was raining
[Music]
excuse all the crashing
that's that's the fun fun driving time
to choose here
yeah
beautiful
[Music]
so now we're not crashing It's the final
lap so now I just need to
[Music]
use the last knife without cashing this
one
and when the body is more damaged than
the suspension
oops now that was just creating the one
that's not trashy
I I don't think I can use that excuse if
I'm in the car
can I just scrape the wall with the
cards it's fine don't worry about it
[Music]
this
is just another one and a fence too this
happens
no one will see it
entry into a tree but
no no
one will even see your car being down
smart
yeah
this car being family
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
but that's that's don't worry about that
it's um
what are people writing here and I said
if I'm from
The Amazing room yeah
yes I'm doing
this noise in the car so it gets hot
inside exactly exactly
I mean
yes you're completely right I must take
off the class because it gets hot inside
more night trainings that's why I drove
City because of all the night training
racing cars are the key to winning races
and fun punishment yeah you're right
racing underwear is the key to winning
races
I'm trying stuff is nice button is the
best the thrashing is nice is that what
you're saying
nothing survival yeah the deck check
yeah
this is the third test so it's only not
zone is nice it's also weapon
that's why I had said from this track
but now I have these three that lets me
see better being basically knocking her
down the other life
and
um
[Music]
excuse me
excuse me a girl for gold you don't have
to go for girls
it's kind of funny how you're in the
league but

I got to teach his trick together
just it just needs to pick up the story
how do I connect questions
but anyway I got to leave
Albany
what there you go
straight around like that
sliding along the tracks
[Music]
yeah I haven't taken down the scene so I
don't see anything the fist but
that sign doesn't count it was facing
away
that's perfectly fine
[Music]
that's your best lap lap three
half series completed
[Music]
for some reason
that's interesting normally when I crash
things are behind immunity classes
[Music]
[Music]
okay
I am getting good at this strength I
think
[Music]
[Music]
can you get that one
final lap finally the final left

even the wolf is happy yay
it's it's it's
night driving and it's worth driving
so much night driving
[Music]
didn't made celebrations
there is a spin in this track
okay
let's do this
let's win another race
okay let's switch that that's exactly
one second to do three two one go
[Music]
again
I guess I get to drive in this side a
third time because I didn't win this
tournament
[Music]
don't wonder if the inside is you're
right
[Music]
but this is already attracts that's very
important
you can try it pretty fast through these
corners
[Music]
[Music]
medical heat I don't know why the
computer is slow on this track
prior to a lot about the tracks
[Music]
[Music]
when I would say I'm pretty good at this
strike
[Music]
pretty good now it's not Primal inside
but maybe that was what's gonna treat me
there I should probably go on the
outside on that
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
let's get on the outside of this now
since that definitely went bad
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay
and now 45 minutes
[Music]
let's now completed
you can get this way so it's
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
sweetheart
trashy and next together
I did something new this time oh I think
well
[Music]
you placed first you know them to the
car whoa
you can teach you very good at this
track yeah I am good at this train
I just wish I could try it anymore
this is a fun trick
personal damage race I know and it
wasn't a wet track during the night and
I was four laps
nothing
[Music]
it was amazing
but yeah
I guess I just continue
dolphin curl is another track I would
say I can't do good but I can also do it
extremely terrible distract
three two one go
it really depends on a lot of factors
this is a much tighter track
so
one slight mistake and I crash into
something
[Music]
like that almost a mistake there
well well excuse me that was quite huge
did you hear me please set or another
car excuse me I'm trying to try it here
you missed us
yeah
you have a black wing and nothing
you have a black window
I don't think that's a good thing I
don't know why the society like this
whoops
instead of think it's very high my
backside you know
well this is not a track with no damage
during it
let's start so
I am currently getting quite punished
for that
I hope that's
[Music]
I hope that the space like that
[Music]
that's who knows I might not need the
two disasters
[Music]
yes I'm trying
we're taking out heavy side
I guess that's South CC
[Music]
great lap lap three
foreign
[Music]
maybe it shouldn't be the reason
trying to leave

all right he's back okay Switching back
and forth come to the side
[Music]
again
I'm just trying to pass you
and you're getting in your way
and I just felt this climbing
that's not cute
[Music]
oh no
this is
this a different life should be
I mean come on this Jenny hit everything
[Music]
I just need to pass these cards somehow
I guess that is one of them
and then I
[Music]
need to try to see somehow there you go
to the bridge
[Music]
that works let's make it
oh that was too tight
[Music]
ah come on as soon as I pass the crash
pretty much left on the track
oh well
can I see anything if that didn't go as
well as I hoped
when
what's the standings
I still have the leads I just need to
basically get burnt I had yeah this this
cannot uh
that's not about yeah that was the
button and yeah the the rest of the
drives cannot go get the head because
they have two little points Max when you
get this 30.
100

put Cherry down on it
tracks

wrong tracks
lap two
[Music]

[Music]
this needs to be more carefully
[Music]
I just need my final guilds
[Music]
[Music]
and let's see some side like serious
secrets
tournaments
wouldn't that be funny

enter
oh my
wasting me like two one go
[Music]
hips that was the same
and the car's upside down
[Music]
yeah this isn't going great
it's almost like a cheating because the
difficult level is something to me it's
more like other cars it's faster than
mine
some PC
[Music]
I mean I'm constantly crashing
this isn't really doing it party
but
foreign
there's nothing I can do to the car
because it is like
this manual automatic transmission but
it is like no tuning or anything
okay that was that was just a warm-up
let's do it for him
but wait this morning good luck father I
know you can do this I failed already
with this I'll try again
hey what are these no codes traffic flip
stingy go go yeah like

remainder of the string
one
that was something
how many points do you give that trick
[Music]
the car was so fine
these cars no it was it this car is on
fire
as you can see
because it's a lot of times
especially not that sorry
probably on my capabilities
because I don't even know the lyrics to
that song
[Music]
is it
now she's like a track is extra
something
[Music]
something like a Knockouts tournament
but
each time you get last position you get
a strike three strikes in your mouth
[Music]
[Music]
lap two
so everyone is quiet I was making a
table for tricks that you cheat thank
you for making clips
let's see
[Music]
happy and fun
triple spin
on fire
[Music]
and then also landing and facing the
other way around
I want to see they give you a perfect
score wow
thank you
a perfect score
10 out of 10.
you're gonna be using a different card
for this tournament or something
or should I just drive there
and then
a perfect picture scarf for a perfect
family that comes with you guys
yeah I'm not sure if I will be able to
see this tournaments
yeah I'm never going to take care of
that big team
especially when the these characters
passes me like that
excuse me
I was cleaning sad position
can hear you come and just passes me
like
I don't know
[Music]
yeah I think this tournament is beyond
my skin heaven
right
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
okay this one doesn't have weather
I just lose the first track and then I
will win the rest okay
maybe maybe that works
uh let's track I want to take the
standings
it's it's a big gym
no is it really okay
I'll just I just ignore that when the
track and just move on to the
non-weather trench
let's see how this course goes
three two one go
[Applause]
and also and that
[Music]
um
because this is the AAA class of cars
to buy his classic cars that this green
white blue car is the lower class
somehow
fasting in the sky if it's not faster
than this planet
it's just a AI is from better than life
the bad training
[Music]
just found that thing
[Music]
so I just
need to catch up
15.
okay
let's do this
but I guess that works
[Music]
[Music]
I'm sure maybe
[Music]
maybe this car is the best suited for
these tracks these are animals
[Music]
[Music]
all right so I'll finish the smoke that
means it
catching up
here
recently
lap two
I was gonna say that I saw the yellow
card was the yellow sun
tennis in our fresh smoke
we have a kite somewhere around here
[Music]
peel your eyes
maybe not
and
I've lost the Hot Heads
and that I
catching up
I forgot
Jessica I'm driving terribly
I'm not going to mean I'm driving like
this
okay
[Music]
I guess that makes sense I mean last day
yeah I'm not going to need this
tournament because I'm not catching
outside I have to try but I'm just
I'm just stuck good enough
my colliding way too much
[Music]
no one's bounce man I guess I guess this
is the limitation of my skins
[Music]
yeah I'm giving up brother
I'm not going to be able to do this
challenge
yeah the other way is up
to be honest
right there we go
whoops sorry for making it
well you didn't do that
contrast
okay
let's do this
let's go
aha another excuse me
oh
[Applause]
no I'm not catching it
in the uh price tournament you have you
can actually switch any car you want
but I was deceived I was just wanted to
see if that actually affected anything
to happen
oh well yeah I'm not sure if I can I'm a
championship apparently Championship
champion
there's like
I don't know what's inside exactly
don't have a regular car
if I did this
oh I haven't
what you should do is start eating
straight for if
yeah what's what's the point
and what's the point you'll get it I
believe in your version you will be the
chef yeah but for us here you are
watching me and yeah this question is
ideal
[Music]
s
Amazon
I don't even know what this feeling is
I guess I have to change it up now
let's do some miles per hour
what's the speed of this road
and if there's breathing inside somebody
writing
[Music]
30.
supposed to respond we
can
I think the game is broken okay this is
um I'm not gonna be I'm David
oh here's 15.
I'm not criminal I'm trying legally what
are you doing
YouTube
criminals tries to arrest me
yeah and you're not even using Factory
because
his first response to
animals
press
instead
there we go sometimes I have to go the
way oh
okay congratulations your Most Wanted
you can do I I guess the labs are
supposed to be a number of minutes you
should run away for
starting with this okay
the car isn't street legal oh that's his
lie
oh my action almost wanted
is that is that why they want to chase
me
okay let's do
let's let's pick a different car that's
Isn't So speedy
[Music]
I don't know
yeah let's let's fix this car
oh this is the other car I was supposed
to choose
uh it's not even an option
I mean anyway let's let's pick this gun
I can see if I can survive
because apparently I am a criminal for
no reason
I'm driving around my car in my business
swimsuits
[Music]
I'm being keep driving funny
that's right I don't have a license to
drive a car I missed a bunny
nothing can get
20 minutes
[Music]
please
[Applause]
this is
supposed to be able to get more tickets
and you are outside
[Music]
that's a candy how do you do like
seats
I
I thought you were supposed to be able
to have
this game is really weird when you
select this track
okay let's see what this is first
and character funny game how did you get
arrested you were still something wrong
clearly yeah exactly
I was almost arrested the relationship
with a bit more effort than cheese sauce
okay here we go here's a race
is that white car with a white pair
driver too
[Music]
much money
[Music]
ah there's a very curvy in here
and that is going to race against the
loud man I'm losing against another man
but I'll show you old man
actually
almost ready
[Music]
I'm not sure why did the stuff change
let's change this back yes
well this should actually work on this
now see what happens
[Music]
[Music]
go ahead
[Music]
in front of me
yeah
white guys like that you know
are you supposed
ly
they cut the uh my car
[Music]
can I
okay
I'm only excited to fix the
it has affected at least
[Music]
now
I'm in Elite
I know police stuffing
[Music]
okay let's take the first one and
White Castle driving yeah apparently
they left the white car free but now the
white car is being chased again
doesn't even say the
the driver's list
actually did they change this space on
honestly stand yes let's change this
based on
what game of this whoops there you go
it's Ace
[Music]
we also now at lunch time for something
I don't know this is great
you get three tickets in this case the
other month only gives you 150. even
though it was eight
minutes
so this car is so slow
probably doing two laps for that reason
yeah I don't have to worry about any any
police and like it the white car is
taking all the police
and I'm going here with no cans or
it's bathing suit found
here
yeah I don't think that's good for the
car
oh you left him he left
are the police didn't clean up
now some
traffic car is going to turn into that
thing damage their car and
[Music]
I guess you can argue that being if
everything happens
and that's right
you can design that fast to see town
maybe you shouldn't leave this you know
Mexico
oh you got
you got our own hammerness
okay that was pretty easy
how many tickets did I actually got that
second thing that the police team lost I
think he's got two tickets
yay
I didn't that can't find anything
oh yes yeah okay
that shows that you actually want it
this just that you haven't won it but
they didn't add those effects this game
is kind of weird
it's a weird game
I'm not super you can see
if I might come back soon
might come back really
uh
so
okay another idea
you can do
let's do like a single race
and opponent how do you
do like sing I'm gonna choose the number
of clothes
there you go
one opponent's traffic one that's
amazing
and then you yeah then you can do like
because one opponent should be maximum
tracking I think
or if it's the same amount because
that I don't know we'll see
and there's no voice
[Music]
all I need is traffic
hey someone took down the sign
is the traffic
I forgot subscribe
sorry about that traffic
hope no one bites
[Music]
the car in my car cause I'm fine but
yeah there's definitely more traffic
because they don't have to spend
resources on things
but yeah that that crash made me
fall behind
or bus
oh someone crashed apparently
and i t
please be safe he said money left
and first thing I do is drive into a
large
[Music]
heavy kind of some type
you know what it was
charmandary of some type
[Music]
that was tight
again don't think about the context
someone
is that box man
sure that words
[Music]
charity it doesn't feel safe
there's not another one
it's driving so ready
the usual trick works
always works
anyway
this would be more fun
sadly you can only choose if you want
traffic or not you can't really choose
the 10 or something
[Music]
foreign
that's that's why they should make it
the remake of this game this amount of
traffic I would I would call like a low
amount
and then it could increase it in more
and more
well yeah I'm not going to be able to do
that tournament because it's way behind
my skill level which is a shame
yeah
what's not
I'm not sleeping
new split screen
yeah I made a clip of that crazy crash
thank you oh you can set up your own
tournament
you can't choose difficulty level
my car you want
[Music]
uh cancer position is acting
[Music]
fun fun
[Music]
but how do you say it said like how many
races
you can set that
here's cartooning but it's disabled
[Music]
no not turning it
but even so you can't really choose like
opponent settings
not yet
the same way here like
I see much more settings
farewell
oh man
[Music]
yeah I think
yeah I do think like a shorter stream
today is fine I will do a quite long
stream tomorrow because I'm going to
draw
and this
are they and it's been in the Stream
tomorrow when on Wednesday
we'll begin according to the times
from written here on Saturday Sunday
and
so that's 14 o'clock my time
you're doing great part by this team
yeah I consider like I got like gold
every normal
non-sections tournament let's say that
I like I complete like the normal part
of the game
[Music]
and just not the uh
not the secret part of this game if that
counts if I love to count it that way
and I play the game a lot now so if I
may say I'm
I might get
slightly boredom games or something
Maybe
secret circus 3D racing yeah this is
like practicing C3 racing at this point
fish
so
how about we go and visit a streamer
named uh pumpkin unicorn
who is currently drawing
he's from Malaysia
has
quite a nice Avatar I think but she's
not she's seeing it at the moment so
it's a shame
so yeah quite a skillful artist
funny
I don't have anything else to say be
prepared for the drawing stream tomorrow
tomorrow
to schedule because and I should
probably start crying more directly
so
we can chat more about that on the
stream as on the server
and of course there is also all the
links
if you want something to get other stuff
that's not it's fine if you don't want
it better necessary I guess everyone
watching Arizona
a few seconds left
