three secret
stamped wait where's the game there we
go clap clap clap clap I don't see your
feed anyway let's go a minut early so
next level is because this one took 1
hour 58 minutes and 11 seconds but this
level is Three
Kingdoms
wow I didn't begin rabits
there wasn't that fun I was already
ready I was being for like s minutes I
didn't spot
waiting
tin well I guess your mission now is to
count how many rabbits there are in that
Stampede at least I start in the
middle which makes things more
convenient
I am not oh starting early I not sitting
great at the moment maybe so
much there we go poster check perfect
although I need just to hydrate but I
guess I can to hydrate number two
actually number
three
there it's only number two on the action
thing done
done and pon pon puts on her swimsuit
and is ready to go
out well which okay which one should I
leave you know
what almost like the bottom ones are
easier to leave to take l so what if I
just go in with the helicopter and do
something
crazy you know as I usually
do okay wait I wasn't
prepared I could have paused but you
know no no
paing there is pause
but okay now I'm ready let's go real
this
time
[Music]
okay oh it's already aiming for
meit can can here
this
okay was me it wasn't very lagging
there way too many turrets and stuff
oh no
no don't do it don't shoot me where is
my base here it is where's my
base is there no mines in my
base I control
helicopter there you go go go go
okay I have so far not destroyed the
building but I have done some damage on
it pressing the back button but that's
there's the back button is pressing the
same button there's a map button and
there's uh the info panel with thatting
button you just press the same button
again to close the
menu I can't remember
that
there we
go so I managed to destroy it time to
leave I will destroy see see what I'm
leaving there we go wait isn't it down
here
yes
I will destroy a few things while I'm
leaving many
weapons I don't okay maybe so and then I
just go
talk wrong button
again I press the right button at start
of the
game but time I keep pressing the wrong
buttons okay top
right let's see what I can
find am I'm going the right
way no oh
no
well that was all I wanted to achieve
because now I can
basically go storm in there
with that's how close open close and now
I can storm in with a big
tank storm in will speed
ahe right there they
are oh I got stuck in that
tree okay where
oh down
here excuse me I need to get through oh
no
mine if you open the door thank
you cuz oh oh another door okay good me
can you also open the
door cuz
now
I now check that
building there's nothing in
it and now I can move on to the next
building and I wish you didn't shoot at
me all right so over here good good
good open the
doors there it
is hopefully I can stand between
here oh it's in here okay this is a
problem it was yet again not in the
last it was over there I do still have
one Tower yeah okay well in that case I
just storm in with this again oh f it
already yeah
surprisingly I don't think I've found it
earlier like and
this this is the if it was found in a
fource of five buildings but I think
when I play with Street buildings is
always in
theide but I do really think there's a
slight light chance for it to appear too
early but almost guaranteed to be the
last
building
okay just let's clear off this
area so it is secure for a tank to tank
for a Jeep thing
R show
up that one
St
and let's destroy these towers
too there
go now it should be safe for a deep to
go
through destroying everything
now that one could CA a
sh aside from that I think
good
no let's get rid of
this oh out of
Amo yeah that was fast now the trick is
to capture it yeah I'll capture it now
so what right Hope from more or
something in the road oh in the
road on the road in the road I don't
know how speak
English
um I guess this is the story time
stream especially for long stretches of
road where nothing
happens
[Music]
next
[Music]
[Music]
this
[Music]
success maneuvering my vehicle to avoid
it I realiz since was a kitten in
street so I turn around to go pick it up
but sadly his right hand leg is probably
broken because he doesn't move it he can
move the left
leg 9 9 hours 9 Minutes 49
seconds eye of the storm starting in the
eye he has eaten since I'm Bor him
home oh no my
helicopters maybe forgot the
celebration how dare
you
hello I don't like you
now I should continue over
here cuz I want to go to like the
furthest away building for flag can I
ask that weird question hello
black nice
name what's the weird
question
as long as you accept that I might I
refuse to answer it you may ask ask
it I guess that's
the yeah that's
compromise is your like bow tying your
ears
together I guess that was a interesting
question actually h no the a are just
hanging freely behind the
head I'm not sure exactly sure how the B
is time to consider
that but I like the
question I haven't considered it like I
have considered it because I made I'm
actually
made
D this is how come on shoot it thank
you and I just placed the bow between
the
ears I wouldn't consider a weird now
this wasn't a weird
question
actually I should probably not go and be
crazy with this vehicle I kind of need
it there we
go is
there my
magnet yeah I didn't considered being
maget but I guess that's a
another
idea okay so I got that one so I just
need to continue up up
up there's so many so many of them
yeah just the bow placement messes with
my perspective I guess that's kind of
what
the with 2D art sheets with kind stuff
like that but I will make a 3D model of
of my
model which I will use on
stream in that case theb would make more
sense hello I just want pass through
here if it's okay with
you I assume not but I will pass through
anyway
oh okay this thing needs to get out of
the
way I'm try B weird I'm not drunk I
promise yeah I'm happy to I like
questions
likeon in the character signs and such I
guess because you asked me to talk about
me I'm actually sober today too oh is
say also
like you know wink wink
H or are you actually sober for once
okay no it's
not it's not that
bad all right I can't pass through there
I have
to okay let's take care of these
and oh
Escape
aha wait what are you doing
okay why you doing up
there oh shoot the tower shoot the
tower what are you doing up
there
go all right yeah you're right I
am correcting myself
now I'm starting to
potato a
banana minut of these towers and I want
take
they taking a lot of damage now so maybe
I should head back home to recover I'll
the hydrate
now
oh red dragon is
here what do we go have
here
care
for some reason you can't drive over
that even
though wish you
could Pon is always high on how
k a new
follower thank you
[Music]
spal going to lunch in a little over an
hour so can I have have to be so
unfortunately I mean that makes
sense that does make sense okay so
cleared up that way so I can reach those
things now good
good pon pon the bon bon bon bon the pon
pon actually he wrote
there hello Dragon
red hello hello
yeah I like sex
rabbit
oh oh my I I assume you're going to have
a good great time
here and you can redeem different
outfits if you want to
see sexy Swedish s rabit in different
outfits and that's what so I'm not drawn
this let me just play out
these there we go now right I should
have clear cleared that
out and
so yeah I have not drawn this to the
model so I'm not going to make I wanted
I was thinking first of redrawing my own
style so I could add where is the gate
there
and then draw my more
outfits than go now
temply but then then people really liked
how I made the 3 model of pon pon which
I actually made for something completely
different
so then I just decided to no instead of
drawing a 3D
picture I'll I'll just make a 3
Model it's soft P tummy yeah and with
the three the model I want to add like
cting redeems of different
kinds because people like seem to like
that pet pet the head pet the
tummy not sure what other
parts should be
pable and by that I mean reasonable
parts I
mean
Heil o i mean that's not ex exactly
reasonable
because it is kind of hard to see the
tail
already it's going to be even harder to
see with this 3
Model so I cleared out that area I guess
I'll just
H how do I want to push that I guess
I'll just continue continue
my it's like the P's tail my sensitive
tail my tail is already pointy
enough yeah aging
now
my
beautiful the rumble from this
one okay now let's
see take take down
that that
one
oh no it they didn't destroy
it but was there yeah there was one
another one on an island too the
building is in the
way sorry
building
go no destroy the gate not
okay I'm backing out
yeah people run
away and then's see if I can get to oh
wa they can they can throw hand grenades
far hand grenades not even bigger than
they
are okay it does not seem to now I
cannot cross down
watching oh that means I have to go
[Music]
down that's
annoying what tower defending buildings
here okay
what
oh it is right there but there's
probably too many Towers in the way okay
so I'm probably have to go
around to get back
home and see if I can find a find a
valid
approach it's
soft I would imagine the T being
soft see no flying roots
in so did you know bunnies have long TS
I mean look just look at my tail it's
really
long
yep
okay I'm moving back
home sure sure what to shoot
me so moving back home
for me I still still have that place
yeah there's a lot of turrets going
around
there
so Tower
turrets
turrets I
could it's probably still easier to go
East even though I have to destroy more
Towers
it's probably quicker
overall
oh the
in it didn't go as easy as I
hoped
crushing
bushes
go so now it's safer for a second
approach
and the real
approach me I do still have
to cuz then I have to go visit every
place below as well and having cleared
out this IR does make it
easier
okay I
will there we
go oh destroy the
one
get
to and of need destroy a bit
more while I'm
here start building your just in
way there you
go and with a s
approach it's going to be really
safe stream get way trying to move
through
here so my circuit should arrive on
Monday unless you
P does deliver ground on Sundays but as
far as know we do not maybe you should
be the one delivering it to
yourself looks good so
far
there's casually strolling oh no someone
shooting at
me yes casually strolling through
here I to track his number to work so I
can figure out which TR this and see if
I can't find
myself could that be
theft taking it out straight from the
work okay nothing is destroyed this
building oh it did not contain a flag
what a surprise okay I'm done
here let's move um South I
guess and see what Secrets they
hold
okay I'm getting
stuck thank you for helping with
that
okay all I hit the
tree not
moving it's a bit dangerous
okay oh now
the alert for upcoming ads is
working the ad already
now just un one upcoming it
okay now I just need to plan
out will it be safe actually if I can
prove that I'm the recipient I can take
it with
me just got to do a bunch of paperwork
so it doesn't end up missing in the
system
yeah I mean makes
sense actually going
south might be no
no but
yeah and with this read all I can
do come on get out way I'm trying to
move
here
I can make um Circ thing
outfit a mam
cat oh they really have to go around
everything oh is there
shortcut almost
a
almost
maybe if you just one square you can go
through deep
water
if you keep
moving this does mean that if one square
of the bridge because the bridge are
destroyed in squares in segments if just
one square gets destroyed you can still
go go over
[ __ ] which of course is a good thing to
know
oh excuse
me I need this
thing or fly
sing
okay you can't pass through
it if it's just one square of deep
water I actually done it like one map
before or something like
that
can
you stupid building can you get out the
way I'm trying to approach this Tower
here
well sh of those people just thr hang
and sent me what have I
done actually you know what I'm actually
out of
ammo so I need to go
home
oh
well oh yeah I need to go over the
bridge
here but it's usually just better to
wait for it to be the Le
yeah that may makes sense
out of
ammo and then I can see on the map where
I'm supposed to go
again cuz I'm taking this tank through
the
Jun
Through the
Jungle intense music as I'm going
through the
jungle
[Music]
okay where do I
go
so there's a flag up there okay and then
after I take that out I can just go west
and take out more Flags
Okay I have an idea of how to do
this go
go p
p go go p p
[Music]
B let's
go no shot
me how
rude and I have done nothing I just
passed through their P without
permission I got permission from my boss
is that the SC from Might Morphin Power
rang
was go go p b
b I haven't watched that
show goo Gadget
I think that was just inspector G that's
exactly how it went
though
okay yes it went go go p p p
p I totally sto my name have rude of
them yeah fing
ring
Bo oh
to
G
disappeared
oh I should have checked which side I
should approach this thing
on no okay but it looks
fine no
flank oh oh yeah yes fluffy bunny
belly
of course red dragon I mean Dragon red I
mean 69 or
69 I shall show
my bunny bunny for
you R
dragon
but these red dragon are red dragon or
is Red Dragon a different color Dragon
just to mess with
people thank
you so I'm just going
to
yeah there you
go go around the outside
here W here we
go red dragon in fact infrared dragon
oh red is the coolest color of
dragon I don't
know oh I found
it R
thing again a level where it found
the like too
early okay problem is am out of
ammo I mean more amount of
munition
so
I need a place where I can fill up with
that
stuff oh well I guess I just have to go
home but I should probably clear out the
paths for the team instead of going
around everything and see I'll go home
and check the
map
I going to say the last rocket to
whatever I need
for also Pawn is very visible in
infrared oh oh
no you looking at my
infite what do you mean
because one has more of a body showing
there for I see here I can fill
up
therefore more infr
is given out that is block I don't know
I don't
know e the
spagetti okay how should I approach that
flag oh my this doesn't seem to be that
easy
okay I have an
idea I have a perfect
idea I'll take
this no actually
wait I'll take this that wasn't picking
it that was checking the
map oh loud
music and then I just take
this and
then okay destroy
that then just go down
here I hit that
thing
through the land of
destruction oh
no this is too
much wait I don't remember this on the
map
anyway then goes through
here
your it's
annoying I keep missing you there we
go come going the right way I'm probably
not going the right way
here no I'm going the right
way okay
good
just follow the path of
Destruction time I run out the munition
again Che cross all these I missed
one what if we Pat your ears I guess
that could be a redeem too Pat ears Pat
head Pat bow oh no not my
bow P tummy P tail but the tail is not
going to be showing Pat
legs maybe not
P okay I was going the right way now we
just need to do slightly more clearing
out there for
the ni do this
instead yeah it's just like two towers
or
something no I is the
helicopter look out helicopter passing
through please don't use your missiles
against
me
that's bre the
TR
go and
then there we
go
and I'm basically clearing up a way
[Music]
here there we go now I should be able to
access it within
[Music]
Jeep too far there
[Music]
R's
ears R's
hand watch out the Jeep is
coming beep beep a
Jeep you're going off
road oh too too close to
one
I wish it was zoomed out a bit
more wait where am I
going I think this is the wrong
way was supposed to follow this line of
Destruction here we
go I got the plank
[Music]
H
home before the towers Towers get
[Music]
[Music]
here
[Music]
got the new peaceful yeah it wasn't very
peaceful run small car after the
helicopter did everything I mean I would
say the heavy armor the vehicle did like
the majority of the work but hello
lenia
lenia is that
finished I don't know come on
say time limit okay or the opposite of
the time
limit that's the last level on this
world the coral space base
one yeah the the heavy armored vehicle
did most of the work and oh W
whoo
okay oh no what's going on
here
well we'll see what I can
do life has many doors Ed
boy
okay let's see this is just Towers oh
add
ands
here we go here's
one no they didn't destroy
[Music]
enough
Ling so
long so long map
[Music]
nothing
here the r was a bit bigger
[Music]
maybe so much easier this map
have the fewu but oh no I got hit what's
this oh there there's something up
here but not the
flag
is this the flag then oh that was the
wrong way I have a little helicopter
control
nope must be this one
then
nope wait how many buildings are there
oh there's another one
here
nope yeah no the fuel is running out oh
no it was shut down I don't actually
know it was shut down I don't
remember I think it runs up Fel it does
not crash
down okay there's two more in the middle
of the
map pets thank
you that F get some head pad happy
fun
that's what life
is so here's the big question is it
going to be in the penultimate oh no it
shot
me oh
[Music]
here oh yeah there wasn't a
pronouncement can you stop shooting me
it's awfully rude of you
okay so I take the Jeep up here
then w w Too
Close
go let take the jeep through
here
no Sho
turret that's what it says yeah that's
what the bunny
says what do I best approach
this so think the Jeep and then has to
go straight up
here these rude turrets are in the
way
go of course the armor are your
turrets oops and of course no it took
out that
one
how to D to play a
helicopter sounds
scary
that
there we
go and then destroy
these oh
nice
and then just continue I don't think
there's anything
else in the way
here okay this one is in the
way and just continue up
here there's the
plank
just need to know how to when to turn
basically I have no landmarks up
here well guess wish for
best what you wouldn't trust me to fly
one well I mean I wouldn't trust myself
to one was more what I refer to I
wouldn't trust you to fly one without
you know drivers skill
say so after this very moment now I
would trust you but
uh if you get
some proper
education
there it is wasn't that hard I thought
it was much much more
difficult but it was Prett
easy
[Music]
than
[Music]
I became a
certified I became certified
to to operate powered industrial tracks
at work this week ooh I'm already
certified
them I mean if you work as a different
certification that's another thing
but I do have a certification for
driving Power Industrial tracks myself
save save save save save sa save 8
minutes and 9
seconds and that's all the levels here
so let's move over to next
world
fried green
Commandos
okay yay let's K me these fried green
Commandos what's so special about this
map I start up there I'm completely
surrounded so first step let's stop
being surrounded was a while ago since I
was surrounded last
time
boom boom
boom locked me in
how oh it destroying it all
fine I thought I would get out of range
in time but I
didn't head to the pon
[Music]
pon
because I like it
okay here we
go there something down here probably
yeah there you
go
okay now that this are has been cleared
out I shall now look more
carefully so there's like one over there
one down
there and it could be more I just don't
know so I should try
like I don't like the one that at the
bottom because it's so
surrounded so I'm going to take care of
that one
first
wait where am I
going oh here am
[Music]
again not
too
okay good I got rid of that time to play
home
excuse me son dangerous I was pretty
dangerous but I did it and did not lose
the
helicopter the thing is I don't know if
there are spots you know to fa if there
are those are almost easier to get to
the Jeep to so I'm going to go for the
one to the
east east
o
and if it's in
there good if it's not in there then
there are other places where it can be
located whoa that was
close where is it over here yes here it
is not sure why it doesn't zoom out
I'm using the radar more than anyway so
it doesn't matter much well to
destroyed how much does that feeling
take and plan must kind of protect it
what
no
East
[Music]
yes oh there are more buildings
[Music]
okay what a nice
surprise
where's my
home I don't know where I
leave lost I'm
lost the radar doesn't help me oh no I'm
I'm way too far west now
there you go that's
one yeah I want I should have went
further
north yeah there are two points
left which I suspect are the two that
contains
it just don't confus East with
wte
don't just confused EST with
West okay let's see if there my
suspicion are
correct this need to be able find the
place
[Music]
though oh there it
is oh
[Music]
yeah okay how am I supposed to get out
here
okay this might be a bit
tricky
I was hoping this should be other one
because that one is less
protected but
um
yeah okay I have an idea for an
approach basically go
east do
this make it whole
Bach
and going here might not have been the
best
choice
okay that doesn't
matter and then just do this one
did not really get that me okay you what
I'll go home again
let's just open up a bigger hole
here there we go
now it should be easy to for
through I don't can run out of ammo
anyway so and then I just clear
off so I can get to the
beach for the beach
departure then just take the jeep
through
here
I shut
it
[Music]
go
there a dist at
me and
then not exactly
sure
I guess
um move back home
[Music]
for let's mark this
one
oh out of ammo
okay I matter anyway
so this isn't the way
home oh power there didn't see it
before okay so I just switch it
of course swimsuit is a good
one the two alterntive are both
good so yes so I guess I just clear off
that where I started
shooting and then I just head south with
the
TP that sounds like a good
idea can we C have some
trees trees please okay going to shoot
you just in case
and then there was
you and then we have you as well I don't
think it would cause an issue but you
never
know being in the safe
sign yeah and then there's this
area
come on come on May
V and then I just go us from
here might need to take out these
this might cause
issue I mean this might also cause
issue think they wi
but there we go now I don't need to
worry about
them then I just move South
here
such intense
music see the Jeep is almost
destroyed
there one more
round and then hopefully just more one
more trip and it should be cleared up
cleared off cleared up with a Jeep to go
through Jeep
yes it's a heavy heavy armored Jeep
[Music]
Okay
so
yeah yeah yeah so I just need to I'm
very close to clearing off that
area take a tank CU it's
quick now seem I cleared off most of
stuff is this I have to travel so
far
I mean I could just go around that
but I Dam
it and then just go down
here
reaching this
[Music]
area oh sh the wrong
thing oh
no oh let's get rid of this tank I don't
need
it and
then of course here is where I should
have had the helicopter
still but I guess I'll just do some
island hopping
here
always be surprised what is the tank
doing here we're J in
Island supposed to be tanks out

man have a good
day good
day
diagonally I'm sorry for being such a
failure I destroyed the
helicopter oh double with Bridge
[Music]
nice okay am I feel like I'm going the
[Music]
me oh yeah I
am
W being up control
no oh okay I'm I'm I'm I'm really mad at
this
apparently I'm not doing so well at is
such a long flight and then end up being
getro I'm not that good with helicopter
if you haven't
noticed
my dress is
back where are your counter measures I
don't have any counter
measures I'm going without counter
measures oh here it
is oh well helicopter is basically
destroyed so I guess I hel
now
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
should be somewhere up here I
think yeah here you
go who I made the
time
no don't
worry don't worry don't
cry I cause some damage on the building
I
think so a few more
rounds and I have
it
in which case I just have
to take a
tank
boom
oh that wasn't
F all I'm turning out
Hound going home
[Music]
immediately that was
unacceptable
so now there we
go oh
[Music]
no
I'm going tooo far
south now this is where I should
be okay still have to start the
building sorry
sorry
no
no I'm have faed I'm a
failure this went
terribly oh
no oh
no I guess down use tanks
now
well
wa time I supposed to escape this
island wait a
minute that's not what looking at the
map oh there's some pass up there by way
I wasted that Wast that tank anyway
okay I need now need to me more yeah I
should take I went down when I should
have G there's a path there there's not
the one I
took okay
let's let's do it bit better
now another C
approach there we
go
actually okay I wanted to shoot that
mine I guess there was no mind
shooting
well there we go that's been
one sh oh I say
thought I head shot oh no oh no already
already lost that okay I'm doing
I'm
okay I need I need a better strategy you
have shut
down I've been struck down from the air
I need a better
approach
yeah I can't can't do it like
that I need
something I need a better
plan yeah actually I should go it's up
here I think go it's up
here
this is where I should
attack now I can access
diamond and then I can take care of
these towers
with something that is a bit more
durble
and do appreciate the double with Bridge
here makes it easier to aim with this
thing that doesn't have separate aiming
from what come on come on I had I had
like one hit point
left I'm doing so
terribly why am I doing this
why am I doing so
man I like the
lost and the M are random by the way
so I did not plan on
that I did not plan
l
oh I said I'm not like great at this
game which should probably be very
apparent
considering one of my
fingures
oops hope no one needs
fuel come on where are you com
from all dealing stuff
here well that's the second second T
don't think anyone need
stand than go
oh no out of home anyway time to turn
home
I say that was pretty
successful build some bridges
here there we
go I feel like I wanted to
attack starting to the West
End and then see if I
can passing
home
oh
no
really okay
can't oh I'm so bad at
this
so
[Music]
[Music]
for
oh the
ter I'm say every time
now uh
I'm going where the last one I don't
know I don't know
what okay so use the tank that's the
that's the one I can
use
more like
[Music]
that
this think there's there are two places
with place
[Music]
there yeah yeah
exactly
so if I break open those
two there we go that's one of
them
no no I missed it no no
no I kept missing it
um why am I terrible at this game okay
you know what I don't feel I continue in
that I will okay I I'll do that first I
don't even need to use tank if I'm going
to do that first
anyway continue
continue my
insanity
only go one shot
in
time to
need that's one
[Music]
I again hello Dean what's what's up
[Music]
this
Sky
clouds
on little high little high I'm not rying
so I can watch while going to the what
the wall do you listen this
what do you have headphones
on can everyone in the car hear me at a
moment and
rest yeah there really should one of the
A's in there
word the tower saw
me
yeah
just look at my ter game
play I don't know how many times I
started this level but have not been
satisfied with terrible
done
but I mean now it's going a bit
better
hope we
[Music]
resta that sounds
[Music]
good very picky
I'm destroyed a few things I
think but still a long way to go did I
say
correctly yeah that is
correct
oh
ants you are good that you're
[Music]
Swedish
[Music]
no all I forgot about those
Towers okay that's some
progress I have a good teacher I haven't
taught you that though I think
but if you to
me oh
swingit that's a good
one I see even though there only two
[Music]
options yeah every Tower another one is
now gone gone as they should
be now I wonder how we would progress on
leveling Pawn's close surface
you want like a
bikini what's the difference between a
bikini and underwear when it comes to 2D
artw no
oh
my maybe you still help me when I have
questions yeah was waste of a
helicopter way of a
helicopter
[Music]
oops I guess it's works
out it worked out in the
[Music]
end I'm back from ads whoa welcome
back
[Music]
yeah so
yeah I still have I I lost like one
helicopter from
stupidity
and so I had two helicopters but I
stting to clear out so destroy one flag
building that's six
Morey six more
[Music]
most
okay didn't go as well as I
hoped I guess it
[Music]
worked just takes the tank to fly back
and
forth back and
[Music]
forth backing fors back and
fors okay so basically basically I think
I just need to remove one more Tower and
then I should be able to destroy that
flag
[Music]
feeling and then I just need
to be better at the
game there we
[Music]
go so two FL destroy five more to
go
[Music]
wrong T controls I wondered mind if I
can just no I can understand why doesn't
work actually I think about
it then I want to
approach that
one with a few few towers around because
that be
easier I just I can can understand why
but I don't like it when they put the my
base in the corner of the
map CU I had to travel so far to
everything would be nice if there was in
the middle of the
map
should be somewhere down
here
yes there we go that must been easy
[Music]
come
on let's just play
home
well turn into that one that was a stup
[Music]
decision a stupid decision by
me
so four places
left and he's starting to question if I
should bringing
the
[Music]
tank
me is making R noise while chat is
quiet no obligation to write something
but
[Music]
[Music]
so now I might consider removing those
[Music]
Towers I still
have phone has bad connection out here
oh that's B
that's sad yeah let me remove those
buildings in the
middle they just C me
ises my
tower my tower is
down
a mine destroying
it yeah you have to go through so much
water
here
an island shaped like a
heart I guess you could already shap
something like something else
too
okay
that is
it and the r is loud so I can't hear
must be a loud radio so you don't have
headphones
then I guess you're not answering the
question before could be because you
couldn't really hear me so well
anyway oh
well I well at least you're trying I
appreciate she
that out of
ammo so I guess I'll be moving home
again
there a place with just one dark time
you could technically skip over
but seem Sil to
do
okay
so that's been cleared
[Music]
out I could take another
helicopter and it should be fairly safe
to fire us so take my
PA
[Music]
and
[Music]
uh it's been
[Music]
destroyed
[Music]
destroy
no don't want to die

[Music]
[Music]
I got two buildings left with the
flag so how are you been lately by the
way P I don't really watching streams or
in your Discord cuz I'm shy and stuff
that's fine that's fine I
understand
H guess I haven't really talk
about much about my
situation more than I guess it's just
that I have trouble sleeping and I've
have so not done a few streams because
of that which I really don't like
skipping streams but
um I have since been able to sleep
better not not fully back to proper
sleep schedule
but but I'm doing
very
no no no I'm got stuck
oh that me to
bring he needs to have flash his
hard well
maybe
wa can I can I didn't didn't remember
let's bring out
the quick tank so I can
see
boink so I can see if there was a way
over there or if I had to go around
everything
if I could if I had to go around
everything
that's but yeah I do I do take my very
large
plush
is 1 and a half meter more specifically
like more 130
CM so not really one and half one and a
qu
and was like I don't know two noow
somewhere between two and four there's
pop the
way two out of four
kg and I place her on top of
myself when I go to
bed yeah he's not here so I need to go
to the other
place there's been a in the Deep P
ultimate when I destroyed so I took the
risk in hoping for it would be in that
one this was
not someone start shoot
me okay so since it was a bridge there I
don't have to go around everything which
is
convenient
but the tank is getting destroyed at the
moment so let's get out of
here clear out this PA so I can get
through here
into
I'm stra right in front of it do
it I don't like the
[Music]
trees uh do you work during the days or
work out I should do some work out like
of physical stuff to get you so tired so
you can sleep by night no I'm not like
physically tired maybe I should maybe I
should do
something run a la from the
neighborhood
so yeah I cleared off that there I only
need to approach that building and then
we clear off that area and then it
should be free for the Jeep to
approach and then the victory is
mine in your bunny Sports Weare
outfit well I wish it's just that I do
have clothes for that like that just
that in this town I not come out yet so
I don't
think
could
it will be quite a
surprise and that's why also why I want
to move back to my parents where course
I'm not going to be open about this over
there
so but I do have been wear wearing it at
home when I do
exercising I want to tell your family is
cool yes yeah
and in public over there it's
fine when I've been there it's not been
an
issue but since I'm going
to move out from here anyway I'm not
going to deal with all that stuff I'm
just going
to move out and pretend like
nothing
H very
man
this so let's just open it up a bit more
for the
G
nor more Tower shifting
enery very dramatic
music there go that should be safe for a
Jeep
I don't like this mine here
though
oopsy and H
yeah ah there we
go ah I don't know how high now could be
judgment toward someone so cute no
matter what they
were
well maybe I don't look like Pon in real
life when it comes up a
shock if I did look like ponon in real
life there would be no problem for me or
something like
that what about being
judgmental
just going to cross the ocean cute
personality you don't think I'm just
here for your looks do
you I mean my real life looks aren't
really showing so I mean it was mostly
those I was referring
to real life but don't really look like
cute bunny
D to staring at
me BL
hello I
think I many years WR
[Music]
before that much I have been paying
attention to chat you wrote like minutes
ago Le I mean yeah I wasn't expecting
you to fny you
didn't I'm not
that but I bet you look a lot more cute
than you give me CR for them I did post
a picture of myself wearing a dress not
with my face
though because I'm not going through the
whole process
yet
but the that's
one
you yeah I
silly no I don't need it for this part
no this isn't deep
water imagine being cute yeah imagine
being cute I wish I was cute I
mean
aser says cute personality I try to have
cute
[Music]
personality
whoa this the same video every single
time you complete the
level 46 minutes that could come quicker
there
go swimsuit
yeah SP my timer
so can I do
let's go let's go goop that much
probably quick hopefully could do
probably in like 20
minutes it's an
elephant
um yeah let's go with the tank that's
not oh I haven't I haven't seen no
picture of p Pon night dress okay you
know
what but okay you speak as if everyone
has seen I mean I said it was on a
server you can look on the
server that's kind of what I but sure
sure I will I will post it on the stream
here let me f it on
screen and there we go there is the
picture I was left behind because I'm
I'm not fan enough exactly you need to
reactive
the hey who changed your
clothes the timer R out so now it's s
did you like funny tummy oh
didn't and and it's just there it is
you can't FY
kid
someone let me have a someone help me
get the so very nice of them so could be
cute
oh Towers already wasn't M towers as was
M Towers or something which of course
doesn't make sense for me to have Towers
because the opponent never attack with
of their
vehicles
so me so me having Towers is just first
settings let's do uh Rush
here okay I'm rushing too
much okay I'm not dead time to move back
home was rudely attacked before I could
even
[Music]
react there we go that's my
buildings I do
have I have multiple dresses I need more
dresses I need a dress fund to donate to
P fun to buy more
dresses and I will of course show off
how I looking
then
that would be
something yeah do a and
also if you want
to take part in more Community activity
I guess could call
it I'm not sure if you seen it because I
don't know which have enabled
it but it's the
roles channel channel called roles where
you can set the oops I didn't mean shoot
that said if you want a ping when a new
twitch or YouTube is published what
twitch stream that
is but there's
also alert for when a new outfit for my
pom pon mod is
published and then you can help
me come up with names for The
Outfits is the region out in Crash have
their own names already so I need new
different
names
okay okay no not going to shoot that
building
again
so yeah so there's just an outfit alert
there in that channel you can enable and
then you can get alerted when there's
new upd
too with cute names
for cuz you get you know
ped harder to miss unless you get loads
of Pinks anyway in that case I can send
it
okay where am I going I'm going up the
truck going the right
way okay only if you want of course and
if you feel if you have fun naming
outfits definitely not seeing you want
to miss out
on cuz I'm not that creative of a
person
so okay so Rubble actually CS this
ground so if there's a tower on deep
water you might be able to run over
might I don't know cuz I don't know how
this game
works so I can't sneak across here good
good
well getting attack from all
everywhere but I only need to destroy
this the confirm this flag is up there
then I can
leave I will leave you
behind and then I just need to take care
of the elephant's
legs then I'm done with this
level
so but I will move back home
to repair and also look at the map to
get a better sense of where to
go be right back my hey hey the HD is
kicking in again
okay I don't know what respond
it do what you need to
do uh I'm really
b h i got a
[Music]

area with

that no I'm not going to be able to
enter with a helicopter
so yeah
um I'm
learn learning social
interactions I think that good thing
about be
streaming there's many situations have
been in
here on stream but I just don't know
what
to
yes if I'm if I'm awkward that's that's
why bnny claims to be bad social
interactions and streaming
yep oh no I'm
dead I'm bad at driving a tank
too
how far did I get I think I went too
far okay I do have oh drama the
music
okay too many
mines way too many
[Music]
mines I'm going to pass through the
buildings that's I guess is the safe
approach
no oh
my iach helicopter and pun hot pun adors
pun kit but pun also good at Social
ch
well that's a
message oh M did not hit a single mine
mine
mine no no oh if I manag to shoot a mine

[Music]
um just trying to destroy that buy
that's the only thing I need to do at
the moment what's going on here
licking
tail that's that's an
I keep missing the mine that is place I
need to either hit the building or the
mine next to it the area that I need to
hit within is kind of large but I keep
missing there we
go finally there oh FL oh FL is
there and not where I wanted this flag
to
be and now I can clear out the way for
the
Jeep okay
so hi hello

[Music]
final part of the
stream about to finish off this level
hopefully I this bush is in the
way come on that was close
enough
well oh they
coing
go get way
people you're going the wrong way go out
and
see
which doesn't seem like a good place to
go
no there we
go
now there's a mine here come on CL I
need to
be
she well they
are
well one thing for sure they are not
mine I should probably be able to do
this
now
of course the chief does not have a
Rader that's hopefully
fine need to sneak in grab the flag and
sneak
out without being detected I'm being
detected by that Tower but it can't
shoot me because I'm too far away
here we go how about
that that was pretty
[Music]
sneaky very very
sneaky there you go and now run home
home home home
home
I'm going to win this
level or this
map this
[Music]
stage oh this
world oh ad ads family time
ads as I said I was going to end the
stream not time
ads 15 minutes that's not
bad
there
not
same there was the elephant
done that was that one that
one so I
will switch over
here and
now
[Music]
Let's
uh see whoever is
online
now now now n n o
[Music]
w can I going to
bed I guess we both are going to bed
going to B going too bad
eventually should we just oh oh actually
this is kind of kind of fitting how
about we
visit who is a finished streamer I'll
still be me too for for a bit more
iriana is playing a game assuming the
category is correct if has been wrong I
not seeing that every has had it wrong
before but another wrong
ones this one is called called The Bunny
graveyard not that's like bunnies being
graes that's B it's bunnies in some
way so maybe that's thematically
fitting oh she nice I'm kind of confused
because before it was clearly stated
that AEL went with they
them and said that
it doesn't matter if someone just says
she but data was preferred but that has
been removed as far as I can see unless
I'm confusing with someone
[Music]
else I maybe I conf some else that's
possible but I'm really sure it says
stay then but way time stream time is
great the time is almost up and I forgot
my links again oh
and me have only hand yeah I
mean yeah but we speaking English now
maybe that was the the D reason it's the
[Music]
hand
