depending
[Music]
and now
I have not loaded the project yet
here it is
[Music]
to eat that pumpkin
it is
[Music]
I got my watery
the drawing tablet
[Music]
some cheese even the bunny shouldn't eat
cheese I'm I'm
a different kind of bunny
[Music]
and munching on some cheese
[Music]
and now let's see if I can make this off
so I should make other because this
job together she may be
and one folder for that
this will be a bit of overlapping
[Music]
[Music]
if you have the references everything's
just so creaky and skin yes it does
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
of course
[Music]
let me
[Music]
[Music]
know
that's it
somehow get this to work
okay and use the drawing but
[Music]
that made me
separating them slowly
[Music]
foreign
yes
which is amazing separate layers
so the idea is basically that
[Music]
evil creatures
will come in from this
yeah or something
[Music]
and what the Springs into action to
rescue bonbon
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
like that
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
let me get the proportions right here
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yeah
action fields
twerk
foreign
[Music]
quite long but not too long
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay
foreign
[Music]
unorganized
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
that could be a good way of describing
my Arch unorganized
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
50th team
um
for the affiliate streams
is only the account since reaching
affiliate which is the goal I'm
currently oh I'm from streaming
and today is the 45th
a affiliate stream
but yeah the hands don't know how many I
had before
at more than five assists so they
the 50th will be
the 24th if I not mistaken
and therefore the 60s will be
[Music]
on the 6th of July
and that's when I will get the follower
emails
so you'll get access to this
and that may be fun that would be
Empire would be worth celebrating I
don't know what
with what
I guess deciding on the which
which
emote should be following months
foreign
[Music]
did I change it
no wait that's a fun fun
yeah I need to switch it out when I said
I'm skinkies there you go
you're welcome
oh my
[Music]
God
you're ready
a beautiful design for a beautiful bunny
thank you
[Music]
I got this at the moment
do you think
finding out that under the dress
anyway
okay they try that insane
that was meant to get if this one
Yeah so basically
and I should probably not have included
the anime so that's because those will
not be available
but are they non-animated
[Music]
any of those will be available
[Music]
so it's not
too important to have the arms look in
seven
notes over everything
just to get the
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
and you do have proper five finger hands
unlike fun fun having washing your hands
[Music]
hopefully that won't look we had the in
combination
oh
okay that start fraction is a classic
Captain
I don't remember if I explicitly asked
for four fingers if that's just how it
ends up
[Music]
and I don't know if I should keep it or
not but that's what I've been going with
since that's what the drawing is
[Music]
and I do find drawing four fingers
incident five I think which I think
that's why
the trend began or something
one thickness the body with
[Music]
[Music]
um
mess around here everything is here and
see how it like that since oh
look
right
yeah I probably have to modify this more
there's a lot of trial and error
when I do this
[Music]
classic cartoon character and yeah
but in the long run depending if your
art will be more complex you may need to
set if I think yeah I can
I do prefer the simplest style
personally
whatever you feel like
having five features
I can't change everything
but
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
you're not getting the pose right here
it's a bit off
just slaking
or a lot I mean
laughs
maybe everybody should be windy
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
and then tonight the proportions are
great let me be further
for us okay I've seen I've seen
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
yeah you need a profile
yeah uh
foreign
[Music]
like slightly from the side yes
[Music]
[Music]
it's the side I
I'm thinking a bit I mean I'm still like
thinking I guess
[Music]
what I want
uh yeah I'm still
figuring out more how I want the head to
be like
okay
and I'll try something out and let's see
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay
on my forehead
it's
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
you can always make me more cartoon
looking too too much and
yeah that might just
I mean I wouldn't say you're like
too detailed
I'd say this I I think we'll see it
would probably be like
similar
in style
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
a lot
you can't see
shape of the head
of moment
lines out another day after I'm drowning
how much
that's easy no that's that's it so
I mean
and then d
is somewhere here
let's see if I can make like a
determined look
what I feel with determination
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yes so
all right here's something yeah
real nice hairstyle
it's
that may be a good reference thank you
down
the face is getting quite detailed
this eye will be
yeah it would basically
shouldn't have added
[Music]
simulator again
always doing that
[Music]
[Music]
the camera them independently on each
other
because yeah it would be
cut off of the head here or something
and
I still experimenting
maybe I should
have it mask out that
you had a bad idea of how it will look
[Music]
laughs
yeah maybe
[Music]
it looks like the eye position can be
adjusted afterwards
foreign
[Music]
middle of the head there's something I
heard
[Music]
[Music]
I like the hair
not PNG
my name
[Music]
he looks angry he's angry at the
enemies attacking or something
[Music]
we'll see when I
get further along I I will do
plenty of adjustments that's
[Music]
he
hydrates us back with the clothes with
the dress
yes
I got these shadow creatures that will
come and
yeah
attack on
already
[Music]
Kingdom
[Music]
and it had
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
the hair and ends go together
that is or something
in it
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
don't be angry at me
[Music]
there we go there should be a pumpkin in
here
copy
paste
[Music]
yeah that's the shadow kitchens
so
I'm working out
[Music]
it's also fun to draw
a different style
's not going
matching
smile
if I
I'm not sure if we bought the
oh that one but
[Music]
I do have
nothing nothing this artwork
[Music]
which
I think the biggest difference is the
colored art lines compared to the black
outlines
and I guess in the case of water he does
have you like
outlines I guess that would work
[Music]
all right
I want to try it and also the uh
the the
and a gradient like hey
trading eye I think there's more to the
eyes than this but
it's a it's a bit simplified
the evil little bunny
so it still goes together maybe
you know
[Music]
hopefully it still gets well together
foreign
people liked it so I guess it's fine
[Music]
okay let's see and I want
it's an idea of how to do this now
which means that I'm technicians
I'm copying this or not
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
but I guess that's part of the fun
having different styles coming today
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
yeah I won't be able to
mimic what you got
so it will be basically my style but I
will try to like
I'm not going to be able to do the the
art style lists on ponpoint item because
I didn't draw this picture though
but it will be a bit so yeah
yeah right yeah whatever I try to see me
since
[Music]
and I don't know if your other all of
that was weird seeming
[Music]
there we go
[Music]
yeah I guess I guess it will be
basically my style but yeah
if they're sad
thing that exists I will
and then what I'm trying to say
I would say I will try to meet my kids
but it will be my son because that's all
I know
I guess I'm still quite inexperienced
it's also I guess it's a good thing like
for me to try drawing different things
fun and I can't stand you that's good
just to challenge myself
getting out of my comfort zone
[Music]
now
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
anything
thank you and that's really sure what
I'm trying that's in here
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
wait for the idea of that hand
[Music]
and they will make it
because I never made it
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
sounds like something
[Music]
[Music]
into the way
[Music]
good morning all my beautiful armies I
bet you saw your heart
you're always right the same thing
I like the blue fox
is it the blue fox
[Music]
let's get the fox yeah it is a fox
it is a nice looking Fox
they like the hatchback
so many there's so many of us
is his point
I mean yeah no it's not
[Music]
disco bunny
this is
this smelling like a cute pen knife
the colorful hair
[Music]
how uh how I add my little apple pies
this morning
I am happy to get up I I have I woke up
early today
and
which I've been better at now but by
early I mean like eight maybe then when
did I get up
March 29 probably
as previously I've been
bad at getting up
it was kind of almost losing it
in getting up I take your time that is
early what time is for you
almost 15 so it's not early anymore
they got up and made me some breakfast
and
okay
[Music]
watch some other streaming
oh I was gonna say
[Music]
7 47 am here
yeah yeah so
it's actually and that's like
[Music]
oh same type sounds it's a seven hour
difference
[Music]
but it was early when I get woke up at
least
and it has become latest
okay so that works
up medium
if it's about medium there's a pop slow
as well
[Music]
but I'm still in bed watching all my
friends
okay maybe it's time for you to get up
[Music]
[Music]
no not getting up oh and
be that way then stay in bed
[Music]
maybe that leg is a bit too short
of course it's a bit too hard to see
anything
30 seconds
wait I don't know if it's too short
one has kind of short legs
waiting for this hangover to clean yeah
well
I hope it cleans up
[Music]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
it will soon in fact it's probably gone
if I get up I don't feel like doing that
but maybe you should get up if it's
going to disappear you will feel better
[Music]
I do feel better when I get up
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
right that's that's not
the words
I feel fine right now only slightly
dizzy without cuff the well here
all your penis
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
[Music]
them nice
I'm not as in cold water
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
oh
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
adjustments needed
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
since I'm hungry
get your food
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
and
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
legs but
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
head in there
it's very main thing let's see if it's
right
thank you that's that's your thing
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
I think she feels naked without it
foreign
it is technically separate from the
model
I can copy that model hey
so technically
and also I guess it looks a bit weird
when I have the same
reference using the reference which is
the
third term screen anyway
so I could have the people be toggleable
[Music]
if people not feel like removing so
[Music]
I guess it would just be one more thing
to do
[Music]
at this point I could probably have it
so you can basically choose all the arch
a clothes from punching bag
outfit
but accessories and
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
build your own pumpkin
thank you
[Music]
now
[Music]
yeah I guess the tank is missing too
I've drawn like a full body Pom-Pom
before
I mean I did it my last time it was a
food buddy whatever
uh I speak without thinking
and then I say stupid stuff
yeah I had um
both times you can't see her tail
because it is covered by something so
this would be the first time I actually
drawn okay
oh
what does that they look like
this picture
[Music]
something like that
yeah
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
how about that comments I am open for
feedback
[Music]
okay
[Music]
and I guess I guess that's the reason
for why can't pass
[Music]
hey
[Music]
hi
the dress is gone
yeah so fun is about half the height of
rather uh water is
tongue
what do I see you again
are you
where are you what was you how tall is
you yeah
[Music]
comment
[Music]
my University
why can't I search for using
what
the option for searching
[Music]
let's get so fine thank you I'm happy
and I'm happy it turned out to win so so
far
you know you posted that that didn't
scenery I hope it's not a secret
[Music]
so that would be
185 and a half it's a
from
oh that's nice
so
water is that thought and fun pawn it
would be
like
at that time
so water is totally
[Music]
apparently if you were to stretch out
[Music]
if I had something profiting machine
[Music]
which I don't have I do have I have a
software when I can draw a vector line
and then I can get the software to tell
me how long the pectin line is
and just to get an an idea of if the
character sign says correct otherwise I
could do some slide adjustments there
isn't much I'd rather do it now than
later
foreign
[Music]
okay this has a different startup it's
cooking
[Music]
so if I just say a duplicate of this as
PNG
[Music]
and then open it in order
[Music]
thank you
now
[Music]
let's
take a look
how's your baby
[Music]
foreign
now
I can create a Victor nine
to make
complete red make it very obvious
[Music]
so you would measure
[Music]
burning of course
[Music]
and then there's the leaning
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
if you want to be that picky I don't
know
I don't know
I don't know if I should like it to the
top of the head or something
so this line
oh yeah I need to open the option that
is what is the color again
thank you
a document info
[Music]
as another type and then I switched over
to
object
so in this line
we just write another definition
software is 2079
pixels long or points or something and
which represents 185 and a half
centimeters
yes
and then I draw a new line
pan
IC
okay I don't know how to
add this for the sake of
but they didn't last time make it a bit
more [ __ ] like that
it's like
what is the Badness of me
anyway this line
[Music]
is the rough estimate anyway which is
supposed to represent 180 centimeters
is 1867
[Music]
and a few decimals
[Music]
this means that a 180 out of 185 and a
half is
97
almost exactly 97 percent
and 108 days
1867 and a few this month
out of 20079 in a few decimals
is
89 almost 90 percent
so I guess
I guess one point is definitely too
short
should be a bit bigger than the bezel
animation
[Music]
I guess
[Music]
so
yeah because if I make that it has
become quite longer so I guess it's not
today
important because the difference in
length is now
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I've never done so
I just
doesn't seem
it's not my thing
but yeah I mean she's she's a good size
I mean it's it's it's like five and a
half centimeters
how much toilet do you get in hands
but let's see if it gives me an average
to say interest that don't tell me you
give me give me the give me something I
can understand about
[Music]
yeah thanks
three and a half is like six centimeters
almost so
so yeah so it's
76 centimeter hints that would make me
your picture really depends on how
accurate that's my size but I wouldn't
wear heels anyway
so don't worry no hands for me
I will always look after you
[Music]
oh
yeah kids I mean
I don't know if I would use the term
ugly
but
yeah it's nothing like
I find
[Music]
I I have no strong opinions
when it makes the legs look nice
I think
does heels make the legs look nice
I would thought about that
I don't think the choice of
Footwear
would change my opinion on the legs
I mean they're also bad for posture and
destroy the ankle yeah
I mean I have a bad posteriority so
I don't know how you pronounce that word
and ants
ham is guessing are the pronunciations
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
particular accent
why should I say accident no that just
sounds weird
that's that's everything we eat
so what I can do
put all this
wonderful day
thank you
okay
okay it depends on the heels and how
people wear it I guess to make something
sneakers can just throw your back and
posture too if the Arches don't mess up
quickly
foreign
[Music]
so I can make like
it's night adjustment
but I think it is
the other side I want to modify actually
[Music]
they were warning for years and
horseback
the pointed toe made it easier to put
the foot through the stir up
the last heel
again
kept your foot secure in the strip
then some French King decided also could
help him compensate for something he
decides to use them as regular Footwear
which French King was that
[Music]
one of the Louise
and we
[Music]
can't find I want to send too many of
them
yeah I'm trying to
[Music]
[Music]
my head in front oh okay
[Music]
everything felt more like once in a
while if you're going out moderation is
actually
yeah
it is
[Music]
but I would wouldn't bother doing it
it's just never done that before
I don't feel like starting
[Music]
it doesn't even like you feel like a
cute food I could I could have a cute
foot way
he just doesn't feel so cute that's why
[Music]
yeah I think I think I'll count this
this one's good
[Music]
I shouldn't
and sketch out the clothes as well
so should you have like
one outfit
black suit you usually had a suit on
stream right
that's what you're known for
I don't know
[Music]
I haven't gotten a chance to watch too
many of his dreams yet I want to watch
more of them
if I were if I were to ask
it's not what he
like it's basically what you have had
had it
been wearing
a recent stream at least let me check
through the streams now you have the
other design
this is when you've been playing
Minecraft which is basically when I am
showing up to music you had your old
suit
and it seems to be the design you're
going with the most
and it's what I
basically I'm let me share with your
outfits of the week
so uh back with the dress I can wear
clothes again
and also
I was supposed to remove that I might be
done organized I feel like
anyway
so as I said I was going to wear that
[Music]
at the outfit
so
[Music]
somehow
let's see how
when I can do this
all right
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
adjustment
[Music]
now
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
so give me just a minute can we get one
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay
[Music]
a lot of the attitude will be obscured
Emily
[Music]
I do like the
oh yeah I haven't even added the wings
[Music]
they have big and beautiful wings
[Music]
I want some bunny with wings called
[Music]
what kind of cheese do you have crackers
too or meat cuts no it's just it's
cheese
it's apparently trappista cheese
trap is that wait what is it called
peace
or trapeze cheese I mean I get both yeah
foreign
that's where I got the name from
I wasn't
known as spokashis
which is a different
which is listed differently so it's
probably
yeah it's it's okay she's is soft while
trapezius is hard but semi heart
oh
is that dang it
from any
questions yes
foreign
maybe I should
add that
how do I have an image
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
what this is a handsome bunny
well dressed and
see
I haven't seen you in a while I started
missing you
I mean we've been
chatting Upstream so
[Music]
yeah
it is nice when you're here
yes this is a bunny
I'm in Canada now
[Music]
yes it's going to be a bunny holding a
bunny
attacked by the dark creatures which I
haven't been shot yet that's the next
step
I guess
after trying these three
and then I should and then I should add
kitten
I didn't say that kitten would be the
second character of the pon pon
but since I came up with the old
this idea of a drawing
again water first
that's a funny idea
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
this part is definitely going to be
covered up
then just focus on the upper part
[Music]
whenever I should do you like
[Music]
they're like
[Music]
around this area
is going to be coming up
[Music]
objects
[Music]
there's an estimate
[Music]
not sure how I do with the ears though
[Music]
but the other way
[Music]
actually it says MP3 be that strong it
just it's a slight
inch
yeah that's two that was caring for
okay I know I'm in Canada
well good thing you know that she again
by my switch settings change now I would
how does twitch settings change for you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
okay
yeah
that makes sense
[Music]
I know which country I am in based on
which countries which tells me I mean
[Music]
that's how I keep track of which country
I am in
[Music]
this is that what everyone does or
like that sounds good
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
yeah it might make sense
don't don't watch screams and drive
[Music]
you're a good kitten
[Music]
I should probably put the different
parts of the outfits in different colors
keeping everything organized
well it wasn't a good well it was good
watching Ashton's but I got the girl I'm
going to go to the store nobody loves
different updates unlimited but it's a
different speeds up here oh

no I didn't just when it started with
currency because there there was a it
was actually using early foreign
but if it's called peso I do want the
body didn't start with p
but then they moved over to P because
then it was pester Argentina
and then it became
so that 30 minutes over to the A
and now
they moved over to the pesto convertible
which is using S for solution
that was the part I wanted to check why
is it using S
if it's the new peso or the peso
convertible that confuses me I like 750
Argentinian peso
to USD is about one and a half USD
so
what the
no sweaty but I speak I was speaking
English English is English
Communications
it's what now I was speaking
Swedish English it's used in the Swedish
unicorn because it was like 750 dollars
to peso yeah that's how that's how I can
refer to everything
because the plural of this
plural of dollar in Swedish is dollar
it's unchanged
in this case for a lot of units
what does affect how I speak
but it doesn't matter it is not a crime
to even here we ooVoo as much as we want
and I will also say um
[Music]
oh whoa
[Music]
okay
okay
that's my best attempt
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
one two three four five six seven okay I
cannot send no problem
see if I can evenly space them out
by the bottom one [ __ ] yeah I think
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
hello great you're welcome Gray
did it go well in your game how many
times did you die after I left
I didn't end up with
[Music]
I don't know it's not like I'm going to
Play It Again
we finished the first game and started
Elaine
[Music]
um
crash the car somewhere
and the carcon okay don't crash the car
it will break
I would say not that I would play Elena
Noir but it would be interesting just to
like drive around I kind of like that
some games just just turn you around not
actually playing the game
it's not too much you're drawing
I
am drawing a handsome bunny
holding a cute bunny
[Music]
if you happen to know who the handsome
bunnies
I hope you know who the cute bunny is
which could be kind of hard to see the
guitar and everything else but
the cute one is probably easy to tell
but
do you know who the hell someone is
that's the real question
[Music]
romance no no no
[Music]
um
it's these evil creatures here as you
can see I have drawn a very very high
quality
I've had to have them high quality they
are going to be Shadow creatures
attacking
me nah
it is what the bunny who has been
chatting here a bit
and this is okay this isn't the memo but
this is just a drawing
he's uh he's a handsome bunny
yeah I definitely need some custom ones
if you do them and yes he could actually
mods
which I think you were referring to
yeah
my should be
these ones
I'd love to try depending on if it's
like a furry
very an answer
anthropomorphic animal scene
it's that's probably more my thing
[Music]
so I'll definitely be interested in
doing that
foreign
because that's that that one was
animating
like you need to animate takes a lot of
effort
but not an animated once I can do
I mean I I guess I could do an animated
one if you have basically paid for
everything
because I didn't want to get compensated
for my work
otherwise I just draw whatever I want
is really cute
a kid
fluffy bunny with big wings
[Music]
give me the money
otherwise all the bling
no
otherwise I'd bring my puppy eyes bunny
eyes begging for money
10 000 US dollars if I came if you gave
me that I'll draw whatever you want
I'll drop this drawing and draw your
emotes
[Music]
oh
[Music]
a job with everything I want
less than thousand US Dollars yes
what were you thinking about
advice would you like me to draw
something something
yeah that requires the whatever a
a qualified
[Music]
I bet you could draw something cute
I mean you see them either
and I've been having expensive
[Music]
and public
[Music]
I mean you start off with a stick figure
and then you add some Mass to it
I mean you got the stick figure here
button again Mystic figures
like estimating the pose
okay cute
foreign
[Music]
discount for stick figure
yeah it took me a while to understand
but
what's going on
if you're stick figures yeah that's just
proper drawing that's worth ten thousand
big figures
well what
[Music]
but then there is his taxes and should
be so 22 222
000.
oh my that would be a lot of
oh oh my
I mean
I mean I have a pig
um
[Music]
in case you want to dump those
headphones
[Music]
I hope it works because I don't see any
make my hair to open up it incognito
yeah then again let's see
[Music]
yeah with the money they have pictures
to pay up wait wait what
I mean I wouldn't mind but that's
that wasn't what I
what's up big time
if you wanted to give some money today
money girl
a little cute
oh yeah I should have yourself uh
on top of your head Maybe not maybe that
would take away from me
picture
it's a bit silly to be honest
that's why I'd rather here and then
you know that I I messed up in English
if to finish Sailor Moon from pan is so
cute
yeah I did too yeah you saw it in this
area
yeah
I am happy with it I mean I could share
with the stream for everyone who hasn't
seen it yet that is
the fingers are awful but
um
thank you so much for the help on Steve
yeah I'm happy it worked out and you
only have to figure out the volume for
your microphone
which you probably can do with some
amplifying and compressor amplifying
with
well if you if you always are below what
set of value you can just Amplified the
compressor takes the quiet noises and
make louder while keeping the louder
noises loud
but it has a cutoff point so it doesn't
make the actual noise the noise noise
and so it doesn't increase the volume of
that
and then
that should make you sound louder
and actually easier than is basically
what I have enabled as well and I could
give you an example of me
basically
disabling everything this is how it
would sound normally and without these
filters
and then I enable everything and it
sounds like this is that I don't know
how much of a difference it is because I
can't hear it how it sounds
so I basically have to go back and
listen to everything
[Music]
so
I'll start working on collecting the
money
yeah this um do some buns
or what we call Charity streams
foreign
oh thank you
I've been there I'm doing a lot of
basically exploring around messing
around with audio listening to what
sounds
different
but yeah I wasn't supposed to add the
wings
[Music]
oh nice thank you
the speak
beautiful events
and ads
[Music]
character what what's the what why why
do you have Wings by the way
[Music]
that's
I mean
is that particular reason for why they
have wings
or just I make it
don't worry
I mean it's not like
you've been The Almost Naked redeem
[Music]
a rabbit with wings
isn't that a specific design I have one
but thinner
[Music]
yeah that's a combination of
[Music]
different animals
and it doesn't instantly specifically a
rabbit as far as I can see or a hair
technically
this is a combination of a rabbit head
a squirrel body the answers
uh and the wings of a pheasant
however that is not the only design
there are different designs
[Music]
of different animals so it's not
specifically a rabbits but the rabbit is
the most known
[Music]
park
it was from my previous Community they
had been Avatar add-ons so he he's had
swing since I've already traditionally
is throwing someone that said
[Music]
I just
get an idea of how to do the wings
[Music]
it is an interesting
choice
or maybe according to your description a
lack of a choice that means let's use
them
[Music]
but it does make your character more
interesting
[Music]
a wingless rabbit
[Music]
as an engine Drive
if plant food has wings
but this isn't pon pon disease
and that's it okay okay in case in case
people don't follow uh just just a
weekend
living characters there
okay this is water
and this is Pom-Pom
yeah there we go
that will work as a reminder
it would be obvious when I'm getting
closer to completing this
yeah exactly nice there wasn't really
images or points
do you need you need her backstory now
you need to evolve your character
create
create a reason why he added the food
means
[Music]
you see
and water was just a regular bunny
without wings originally
but he
happened to stumble upon
[Music]
an accent
I was looking for the English
way to phrase it but
I don't know the way to say things he he
he got into an accident I guess that's
how he would say and died
very strategic
that sounded kind of sarcastic that it
would be very tragic
honestly after
I've
I'm him
I'm a bit sinner now I feel like
I can't keep the story straight
back in two minutes okay
oh I did
yes
oh you want I need my hydrate
maybe exercise outfit it is it is quite
the work to do a drawing so I need my I
need my spot
but I don't want it
okay you have to die in this story okay
Alexa set the time for
Greek
it's a go get it Greg
ory in two minutes
you have to die for this backstory I'm
sorry water
I guess if it's fair yeah yeah this is
the lower behind your wings
you you wearing a tragic accident and
died how the accident happened what kind
of accident was I don't know that's that
can be decided for later
and but but he died and became because
but because he are such a good bunny
so kind and nice and who died water
uh you became an Indian
a nice beautiful angel
but then
you became a fallen Indian or something
I don't know I've heard that time before
we should Escape your wings being black
but
oh my
he came back
have you Resurrected
a ghost no no
[Music]
what what is alive that's why I'm
getting it
whatever resurrected then we came on the
alive bunny
but but as a fallen angel
so
you get to keep his wings his wings
became black
as part of his
resurrection of some sort whatever
caused the resurrections to happen
what happened is he ubuds and became a
ghost
maybe was part of me
accent
and that's how what I ended up with the
wings
is from his his from his angel face
um
totally accurate North
so what do you think mother
I didn't even know what to say I saw
them yesterday and now they found it
goes no this was a long time ago
it's fine
back
did you try drawn out the cake like that
[Music]
I think things were fast
that was two minutes 45 seconds that's
pretty good that's pretty good I must
say it was
two minutes not three minutes but two
minutes and something a bit more
now pretty good
timing graveyard you could estimate your
time being away
[Music]
but these are good skill to have it's
never you can have a
timer on your screen for when you're
gone and the timer would be and then
then you just add like an additional
minute
two minutes is in three minutes and
and it came back in
almost three minutes
I'll be back in 16 to 23 seconds I mean
at that point you might be back in five
minutes and
57 seconds and then you just wait out
the remaining 36 seconds
I mean 26 seconds
[Music]
that was cut counting quickly
[Music]
and I said I didn't
I didn't stop counting when he wrote
that I'm a slow person no you were quick
two minutes quick
I mean
depends on what you were doing
making a sandwich that was pretty quick
going to the bathroom I would say that
was quick too
I'm gonna be too quick
getting a slice of cheese
like I did I mean it takes 10 minutes
[Music]
putting food in the microwave I mean if
it's yeah if it's just put in food I
mean
I was quick
with like
[Music]
it depends on how much preparation I had
no you don't it's not that straight to
your quickness
giraffe
my giraffe is quick
jeffy's
[Music]
you know what food I'm eating
they just without the art then
I mean you were
connectors because
and the plural would be similar which
would be I guess you would use the
plural in this case
you kind of combine the person
in that singular General thing
I'm pretty surprised her when he did the
spelling actually
but most people don't remember spellings
in foreign languages
[Music]
I love them yeah I
I I did love them too
but I only have them like once a year
are you gonna make them more special but
I guess things stand
I do want to make make some on my own I
only got like store bought once but it
shouldn't be too hard to make your own
I don't know the wings are cute or not
this is pon pon
the arrow system
did I get all the details now
but do you have a tailor some detailment
and be visible at this point
it says it's not saying March April it's
related to Easter
[Music]
so it is on the first Tuesday
so if I just search on Google Fat
Tuesday
which in French is
I don't know how to pronounce it in
French let me double check
in the French poem which you might be
familiar with is
[Music]
Mardi Gras if you want
Mardi Gras hey that's the fat kitty and
that today we eat semla in Sweden
thank you for the following following
thank you for the follow

yeah my tail is like a Harris so you
can't really see it from that angle yeah
imagine it's deep pon pon tail is poking
out just so you can see it
I don't think it would be able to see it
in
in
on my model at the moment but
it's nicer when you can see
and back time I don't think anyone
thanked you because now I was prepared
but
judging for the messages
you left at 30 minutes it came back at
34 minutes that means that the shortest
time
is
three minutes and the longest time is
five minutes so you took three to five
minutes and you'd say that you will be
back in six and 20 seconds now you wear
it back to quickly
back in two minutes again for microwave
sounds good
is that a rabbit with wings a hair
studies
it is
bunny

things
[Music]

through every spider in Crash game but I
but I haven't felt as much enjoyment
just sitting playing it myself but
since I've tried to stream it I have
forgotten much more enjoyment to it
[Music]
alright
yeah I guess I guess
I don't have any big goals or dreams
when it comes to streaming I'm happy
with how it is now
well to be fine
I wouldn't mind a little bit more
activity sometimes sometimes they chat
can basically that but
I've had some people say that
they are worried that they are writing
too much and that's something I've been
worried about myself but
don't worry about that
[Music]
it makes
it's more fun for me seeing that people
are
engaging
especially when the chat is like quiet
or several minutes
definitely don't feel like you're
chatting too much at that point
oh
nothing
there goes this dress
funny
[Music]
why did you redeem it
[Music]
what have you done
don't probably be a blessing though

mentioned before more hair than I have
[Music]
[Music]
my technique
Maybe
[Music]
oh
well I could always tell about the
oh yeah that was the thing I should have
looked up in the my actual references or
which I used for pon pon
reading one of The Inspirations for
Pom-Pom design
is a Bianca from Spyro who has a tuft of
hair on another forehead
[Music]

today yeah I guess
or I think
today's editions there
is
I can at least try out the r sound
[Music]
[Music]
but yeah that's some
that's the inspiration on that I don't
think someone said that like
when it kind of looks like Bianca from
Spyro
now it doesn't
[Music]
they look very different
I remember the bunnies but that's that's
Chinese that doesn't count
[Music]
both are female bunnies wearing dresses
but I mean that's a
with that wait but that's a fight as
it's
it's similar
[Music]
the ignite Bianca is cuter have that you
can't come in here and seeing someone
else's cuter and fun and that's the 350
USD fine
this
[Music]
he eats some if if something
[Music]
if something is going to be a fine how
much is it and then my voice goes away
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
over a second read funny is in the house
and I also started by Kingdom Hearts to
replace Bianca with one
[Music]
and I did had to make multiple changes
because they are quite different I could
show the how far I got
as I did post it somewhere
[Music]
somewhere apparently not my body

expect you to show up

foreign
make sure you don't look at me

would guess
[Music]

the things you need to do
I'm not so holding you here
you can't make me okay
worried when someone says they have to
go and I keep talking
to them

whatever they have to do
[Music]
[Music]

capable of transmitting information
our capture card is capable of capturing
bad things
capturing device of any sort
enter
preferably I prefer microphone so you
can record your voice voice
which you could take to get by getting a
headset with those microphones they
usually kind of bad
foreign
[Music]
headphones
which could asset peer headset so you
can listen
to
the game without it being picked up by
the microphone
[Music]
don't have a character card that never
can see that I did have a microphone
somewhere to not respond because other
directionalities it is but
I went
yeah which are lucky to have a
microphone
old investment
[Music]
foreign
strange
that's a really weird feeling all of a
sudden
oh yeah okay let's see what
I made a female fur cry LOL
that's a bit of an interesting username
got it hello I am from Kazakhstan
my house address is
random
it's fake
[Music]
I see that you have been a
[Music]
James
hello hey
that I didn't enjoy
you're acting interestingly
so
yeah
no yes typing other stuff
I do appreciate everyone coming in here
though you are from Kazakhstan you say
here I am
a drawing
Anthony
pure cute
thing some
artists
sister I Am the Artist I'm doing some
art as an artist
yeah my English isn't
perfect
I'm doing my best
as I can
[Music]
I have been an adult joke about your
Twitch seasoning
well
that's good it's
um as long as it's not like section it's
like
the kind of joke it's fine I think
because this is another Channel by the
way it should have told me
uh
it's not like
nothing sexual nothing hateful
um
otherwise I I'm fine with chips jokes
can be fun
and I have no problem with just being
like about my name that's fine
but same don't yeah
and now this channel is meant for adults
even though you can be a friend at any
age yeah yeah of course
and me being a friend and being afraid
on the challenge
of course has nothing to do with about
snakes
and I'm not gonna say because you're
gonna be sending me to God but you mean
bothering you or your mother
I mean
no
person if it's sexual I'm not interested
[Music]
um
what
[Music]
excuse me
[Music]
watch the drawing I'm drawing a bunny
holding a bunny and I'm drawing a friend
of mine only up to me
and protecting me from
some evil creatures that are going to
attach
thank you
oh I see Ramallah is the
Ram Allah
it's the uh
the Palestines
Capital if
it is at least they might of course
we saw the paints regarding that I heard
that there's been some
[Music]
the fact that administrative capital of
Palestine
[Music]
interesting that you his products are
randomly and it doesn't look like adult
children I mean it's not like
Ramana is not the real Captain it's
seriously as well yeah it's it's as as I
said it's the de facto as in it's it's
the one used as the capital but it's not
the
it's not the illegally defined capital
[Music]
yeah
and they are chases like that in other
countries
that's fine
[Music]
yeah that would be the religion every
day it's poisonous
regards what was it doesn't look like an
action no like okay I like this
yes
um it's it's more like I don't want to
be restrictive to what the content I can
say or other can say so like if people
want to swear or something
yeah with his resistance
that's fine
foreign
[Music]
myself but I'm not going to stick others
from swearing
and there can be some kind of adult
jokes as long as it's like not overly
sexual
and that messes up
I might tell the camp I'm sorry but then
I'm gonna tell a captain of Army in
Eastern countries I mean they don't have
to
I mean it's one thing if like which I've
done before naming in my case I've been
naming other countries
and
and that's that's kind of a challenge
for me but if you're going to write
something in the chat I don't even
already if it's like something you know
or just look up because it's pretty easy
for you to look up stuff without me
knowing
no you're not treating
I would say this is not
this is not looking great I would say
that there's no real reason for you to
do that
[Music]
all right
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
facts of course
but it's not the like he can't really
show that he proved that you are
knowledge in the area because
I don't know if you're just looking up
as you typing it in the chat that's what
you need to say
thank you
[Music]
now
[Music]
respects is something
depending what it is we can affect this
give me just a short moment and I'll be
I will be back very shortly
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
okay now listen oh there you go
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
documented Arab emanates
like that for dinner
tamakus
[Music]
Jerusalem Palestine
[Music]
Ankara for turkey
Egypt
and then a
and I did all of the memory because I
learned every Islamic City and that's
not every Islamic City
you only listen to Capital yeah
capitals of the Middle Eastern countries
to write every Islamic City though
okay
[Music]
lift it up
yeah I'm just saying that
you're not feeling anything
[Music]
and
I don't know if you're trying to prove
anything there is a bit weird I think
in school I mean if you live in your
spine it makes sense I guess because I
don't know why but she's Islamic cities
in Islamic countries
[Music]
okay
[Music]
I need to tell me what I've been taught
in school or not
but like what what stuff I was talking
soon
because I have said a bunch
of my own
foreign
that's fine it's not like explicit it's
just
the word coin isn't bad here anything
that's fine
[Music]
oh
now I'm about to go okay I guess
I guess you didn't get the reaction you
wanted
um Genie goodbye
have a nice day
okay no I don't have a nice day
probably not what you said no about but
foreign
because it was so
I was thinking Jack was a part in a
different language yeah like in Kazakh
or something
but no it was just add some R's and you
get porn porn was born born
I guess it wasn't that created of a joke
obvious that you just sometimes say
something stupid and then it like bye
I'm cleaning or something but I mean
and then it react badly did I
it's not like you have to flee
another thing you've seen it's reaction
yeah I mean
yeah I don't have my auto animated or
something so you can't see it yeah I
don't have a face cam because no that's
not gonna happen
and um
fun is a word for a money languages
and for example in agarabi it means Pig
I'm actually not a small bunny I'm like
180 so I'm kind of funny I'm actually
talented and like the average
height of a woman in like Sweden
if I
is like 165 167 maybe more like and I'm
180 so I can wait quite tall for it
to each woman right makes sense should I
make a substantial I mean
if it's not like
insulting or hateful
[Music]
most people usually don't ask if they
should do a certain joke
if they want to make a joke they cannot
make a joke
I'm not saying that you should just make
jokes but I mean your behavior is kind
of different from most people here for
myself
itself
you're acting a bit
[Music]
something
hmm
in kimberian it means a clearing in
Dutch it means the night a night gown or
night Prince
in Haitian Creole is a bridge
in Indonesian it's it is the pound units
of math
[Music]
and Jamaican Creole it means on
and so on Okay so
a funny idea is to basically draw a
picture of a small Peak on a bridge
in a
[Music]
clearing
the disability Forest devoid of trees
did I say it was wearing a nightgown
because that should also be that
it should be on the bridge
[Music]
but there we go that's a funny joke
even if you translate it to English you
won't understand it okay what if I
translate this to Swedish
I will translate it just to see what you
wrote
that one didn't support classic
oh I see
it's such a joke about
Polish person living in Kazakhstan
[Music]
and then use the word that it doesn't
really nothing
[Music]
all right goodbye oh wait
yeah I'm sorry
you kinda are you just wrote the same
thing over and over again
yeah maybe that's fam
you know it must make the taste smaller
on screens if you don't really
foreign
[Music]
people here
but like
there is still a certain behavior of you
that is unlike everyone else who is here
in New York acting
acting in between and if I may say so a
little later
foreign
[Music]
is it possible that you are very young
acting immature for your age
I get the feeling that you are very
young and shouldn't be here in the first
place
foreign
that would be a good guess
but apparently in there
on calling dictionary it doesn't show up
um
because maybe they don't have classic
words why they do it
okay
[Music]
um
oh it's Porsche is the word for
Poland but it's missing one day in
Kazakh
and then I assume done is some kind of
fair suffix being like from Poland
[Music]
and the suffix might changed it so
the missing character is actually not
used
foreign
I mean it's not like a transcribed
so
[Music]
I mean sure I didn't read it out but
yeah vegetarian thing I think
I would
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
like should I draw nine here which would
be the edge of her boy shorts
I think it's a bit too high
[Music]
maybe you wouldn't actually see it maybe
it should just be a slightly on here
I don't know
I could just add a bit boy yeah probably
make this one and go out a bit more
covering up bye
I guess I could do that
[Music]
that's valid
nope there's no peeking at her boyfriend
[Music]
[Music]
do that
[Music]
maybe I just move this down a bit
[Music]
then there's like a empty peaky
[Music]
right that's fine
he's my own version
[Music]
[Music]
it's not the final night out yet let's
just copy over this
[Music]
well
it looks like the person went away
[Music]
oh well
[Music]
even though this person like a bit
suspicious so
[Music]
I really don't it's kind of I wish I
could
and if you speak the person was underage
I need an option for that first but
[Music]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
my God
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I've not been carried like this
[Music]
maybe I have
I don't have any photos
[Music]
let me know when it's lying
make it look bad
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
yeah I think that looks bad
[Music]
even though
yeah I promise
even though
of course my kids with her
[Music]
white shirts and showing me that
[Music]
[Music]
do you like it do you like your fine
I've gotten did you hear me mention that
I like that one for this boy shorts are
showing
[Music]
um
I love it

I am pretty happy with how much I've
done so far this isn't even the final
liner
no feet
[Music]
I've been working a lot on this now
[Music]
pretty happy with what I'm being able to
achieve
yeah I don't think I will be finishing
this
we're going on for quite a long time now
[Music]
it's fun to draw
[Music]
so I've been drawing a bit more
until I get one of it
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
next
okay
silly reference anyway
that's right that's fine
prpc with your own stuff that's
perfectly fine
I understand that you can't spend
on F and
everything on this chat
I've been coming out free
and a half hours 25 minutes
[Music]
but it's 14 18 36 now
it makes sense
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
yep
I'm gonna throw a button
[Music]
[Music]
uh it's that that right
Crosby convince myself a better
the wrong button
the rest of the stuff is covered up
[Music]
that is mad he's going to protect the
Little Pony
even
stuff
say me what the session fee
[Music]
not only do you have five fingers you
also have four toes well ponton has four
fingers and three toes
[Music]
is that dog's paws
[Music]
[Music]
rabbits are the only mammal that don't
have pop heads the human have puppets
because this comes as Bobcats
not putting us looking for but
from the statement interesting but like
do human have rough heads
someone probably argue that because
their skin it might be classified as
our pets in some sense
certainly there must be a lot of mammals
like moved to melmos that doesn't have
prop heads
or the strange statement
[Music]
I actually wanted to take how many
fingers and toes my rabbit has
[Music]
and according to what I can find it
looks like at least
this one has
more which is on screen anyway morph
s fingers on every paw
[Music]
so
hello
welcome Alex
which I don't remember I was supposed to
read it
Alex Maybe
it's going well I'm actually
partly surprised about how well I've
actually managed to do it here is the
drawing
on upon being held up
[Music]
so I'm Danger
[Music]
being a rescued
[Music]
I am in Tunisia for holidays oh nice
vacation
and you spend your time watching me
even though you're a vacation
I mean if he likes birds for a week
relaxing watching fun fun draw
Indonesia
isn't that
he's in that life
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
by socializing skills are quite
[Music]
[Music]
they may be
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
Africa
[Music]
I think I did the uh
countries of Africa ones and I got like
half of them or so
that
that I should really practice more often
into South Africa list
the best one
I can imagine
[Music]
nice
with pieces and stuff
lots of sand
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
temperature
[Music]
while I'm just sitting here at home
[Music]
I think that's pretty amazing about
[Music]
the internet as if people haven't said
that before
immunity gets strange to me stare
but I'm an atheist I could not challenge
what
what's Christianity
I was like to like is it that sounds
like a religious uh light company what
do you call it
foreign
[Music]
obvious example
I'm honestly pissed at that thing like
yeah I shouldn't teach based on religion
[Music]
so I assume it's common kind of
expression I am not at honesty
because that's it
[Music]
and I'm probably also not used to a
religious based expressions and I say
and totally don't need that there are
some religious basic Expressions that
I'm well aware of
I'm aware of religious experience
being a country with that predominantly
Muslim religion certain things
that are normal for me in Tunisia are
it's totally strange but I'm
[Music]
I mean
wait what
yeah I think I think I wanted to read
that as something like
hey
certain things that are normal for me
I totally strange boy
yeah for a photography Plantation Muslim
s
um
[Music]
yeah which is one of those things that
doesn't make sense to um
atheist like me
I mean I get I get to the original or
like origin that
uh
I would like not the origin but the
reason being that Peak meat is unhealthy
or something
even though
big meat is
next yeah something like that
even though
being meat is quite common
around the world so it is not at all
unhealthy
Allah I mean she probably a certain
aspect of immediating that
that's besides the point
so it's certainly based on something
that
originally
um
some people got sick of eating certain
a meat or something and then they
decided that now we should not probably
not eat more pea meat and then that test
became a thing of part of the religion
itself
that could make sense to me
but we live in a modern world now things
has evolved
then they eat a lot of spicy food but I
like spicy food which makes me
drains because spicy food in Italy is
very rare
hello the menu is strange at home
when
I mean
I don't know
yeah
Italian cuisine
yes I guess spicy food isn't it
I mean
I just thought about it
so have I
mean
they have two versions for everything
spices or not spicy in Italy you have to
expensively tell the weight because if
you don't understand
sentences
I read it and I don't understand it and
then I think I understand it
[Music]
Aly I have this expert in Italian plus
if you don't
you don't get something back
I mean it makes sense if you don't
if they don't have it
yeah I don't think like if I go to like
the restaurants I've been to
and they don't really have spicy foods
yeah you could so you could probably ask
them to
have something spicy in it and I'll
probably leave it for you
I mean your customer your pain
[Music]
nice nice drawing thank you kitten and
welcome back
I hope your store trip was stupid
[Music]
oh yeah I didn't Disney wings
was that just hydrated
[Music]
I see that the viewer number is going up
again
[Music]
so much
it would be
happy being able to demonstrate my
drawing skills to keep on
[Music]
even though I don't have that much
fluctuating so much
[Music]
the trip basket the trip to the store
hope you didn't trip in the story
you see I can make jokes
[Music]
nobody did but like I could just select
it here
the ear here
next here
so
what do you think you're so cute
thank you kitten
I like being cute
and I'm happy yeah
say that I'm cute it boosts my
you know even
if that doesn't sound like [ __ ] that was
my intention
huge finance that was the boy I'm
scaring for
instantly bad for saying [ __ ] anyway
this is an adult Channel
um I love to these I mean so I mean if
people can use words like
I was considering if I should say
internet
yeah it was like [ __ ] and [ __ ] yeah so
there we go I said it and certainly they
were like comes with me in attitude but
I've seen that some people like people
who
say [ __ ] and [ __ ] and
without hesitation still have a
promising hunt and I don't get
does that mean I shouldn't say it I
don't know
hi
hey
culture is still a good experience yeah
yeah definitely I like it I've been to
I've never really fully experienced like
properly any other country I would like
to go on a proper trip to a different
country and explore it properly
but I have been to other countries
I have to been to
an addition to Sweden of course
I have been to one
two three four and other countries
depending on how you
a different amount in different
countries
meeting
so
[Music]
[Music]
I can add like a bit of air like this
I don't know if you look cute
yeah you probably won't look good
he's
he's filled with determination that
should have the wings then
[Music]
next year I'm going to Sweden oh
what will you do in Sweden
[Music]
and stalker I mean
no
[Music]
[Music]
yeah
honestly come up here
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I have interesting enough never been to
Norway
four other countries
the other way has not been one of them
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I'm going there for Christmas holidays
to my uncle who is in Sweden
oh what
you should go like to be here depends on
which which days you're going
[Music]
doing this sentence
St Lucie celebration
going to the Advent celebration
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
well multiple of them
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
like that I I get that
[Music]
however by the end of the year I'm
moving to Japan in
Italy I don't want
yeah I think you need to like come out
with periods in your messages I can read
it properly move to Japan in Italy I
didn't know Japan was in Italy
welcome to Japan in Italy I don't want
to stay anymore working as a garage
designer I earn very little so is it
moving to Japan and finding a place to
live there is that
sustainable
it's not like a quite an expensive thing
isn't it I think which is one in Seattle
country
but
and yeah and you wish
[Music]
doing graphic design could pay a bit
more
[Music]
but oh well
[Music]
it otherwise wheels are the wings here
so in front of the means okay
when this here is the front areas
depending from
yeah
okay I'll keep the ERC problem instant
[Music]
instead is how it looks in there
reference sheet which I'm referencing
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
should have a second here
I never did that idea
either
yeah that works
another ceiling Jack bunny
I'm here all day
um sadly
I've been here for quite some time
[Music]
immediately when I leave the cheapest
rent cost 300 euros and earned 800 list
it cost me and a few hundred years
yeah I mean
I guess there's two options
no uh wait
there is more like yeah I get that you
can probably leave cheaper in Japan
possibly
is the one moving their part that I was
considering possibly costing more
but maybe I found a good way of doing
that
but yeah as long as you have a solution
for doing that
hope it goes well
I hope it goes well even if you don't
have a solution for that
[Music]
if you go to Milan if you guys
dramatically but certainly if you're
just working as a graphic designer you
don't need to live in like
neither
this is
[Music]
Milan or any like big city
[Music]
alternative like in that case find a
small town
and like work from there instead
[Music]
certainly it doesn't have to
[Music]
foreign
going to a
Yadi
[Music]
castratezato
and I I find this one like something I
don't know
[Music]
okay I didn't do the eyebrows either
you need me
[Music]
how are you today Eileen I am doing okay
um it's been fun drawing
and so I'm feeling uh yeah and I woke up
early I might mentioned that already
now
yeah I do feel
should actually be like that
very very little
and so that's why I
do feel better
thanks to the positivity of everyone
here including especially Keaton
it makes me very happy
positivity
Japanese
yeah a graphic design thinks she sells
used during the course four years per
month
guarantee pain nothing because it is
not energy and many modern houses have
tea cleaning and he oh he found an
interesting outfit
yeah I mean if you if you have random
numbers I don't have that the only thing
I'm concerned about is the whole moving
very part
oh
foreign
[Music]
like if you know someone in Japan you
can help me
[Music]
it's the money in Canada is a kind of
fun it's probably because money in most
countries are so colorful
[Music]
it's supposedly
I actually have it confirmed
Canadian
a prank notes
it's not a compared to be fair
[Music]
and Swedish baking nuts because it
really depends on the photograph taken
Sweden has the knee practice but I
barely hear sketch
I guess I guess the Canadian backups do
have
[Music]
foreign dependent on the photograph and
such because they do look
to be higher contrast than the Swedish
money
and therefore and also beats more
vibrant
the Swedish one is a slightly dollar
compared those two pictures
[Music]
depends on how the picture was taken
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
colorful in person
I guess that's true it is possible that
they are so kind of fun
[Music]
money can be quite interesting
[Music]
[Music]
let me mask out this small white
again totally asking for permission and
then I'll see if I can
move it around
in a good spot
[Music]
so much
no no that's pretty much
hey hey oh sorry about
yeah
why sorry about uh I mean that's not my
fault hey
traditional flag
sentence if you are gay people are gay
twitch
a is not a harmful term
okay so now the messages might have come
in Dragon
it's apparently don't look at you look
at who you are or how you are the care
that you did your best example in Italy
if you okay or transgender prepared and
even less than the average
when
yeah maybe that's three
[Music]
the money so cool
looking

[Music]
[Music]
goodness
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]

[Music]
I've been swimming for five and a half
hours now you look great thank you

the kids it's a that
making it look a bit better

[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]

foreign
[Music]
this part
[Music]
I think it's something like that but
that
made that twitch
we're gonna try but
that's it it feels weird
[Music]
oh
you sweet
even if it's not perfect it was bad
hmm
maybe if I
round it up like that
[Music]
anyway that's
something
well because I spent all this time on
drawing this picture I feel satisfied
and I'm hungry
so
I think I've been doing great so far I
will post the example on the
foreign
[Music]
who haven't seen how far I've gotten so
far and then next drawing session I will
do the line arch or that was that this
the actual looking hearts
[Music]
and
yeah
[Music]
and next time tomorrow at the same time
as today and I will start to crash
bandicoots 3.
that will be fun anyone wanting to watch
me play
Crash Bandicoot 3 and I will go for
collecting
our Christmas obviously all gems
including colored ones
and then
but I do have to at least do all
uh I will go for all time trials for the
first level at least I think that's
enough
because that you have to do 25 of those
to unlock these levels below meaning
that you technically only have to do
a 25 out of the 30 time chance
but I can do all 30 anyway
it's for fun
