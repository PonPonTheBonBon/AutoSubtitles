hey there
rabbit Stampy
while coming in I see your first name
that's the first name for today and
yesterday
and as we can see here
our kids around yeah in full screen
I could also
also make it a bit smaller
so
not too much of it is covered by
important stuff
so welcome
we all have room in here
what do you mean it's worth 10 people
[Music]
probably only George
I like
like anyone who decided to shop
[Music]
yeah I figure it is orange these days so
I get the
first
thank God needs to enemy
it's fine
leave me alone
you're the only one here
I'm just kidding
or am I
got one point here
[Music]
and
and
I'll leave you
I mean if you have to go to the store
to do so
don't like force itself to be here
[Music]
foreign
take a quick look at the survey yeah
some people say that they will be here
moving simulator obviously maybe not
let's go
give them time to set things up
almost
finally drinking there
water minced
[Music]
how can I faint at such a basic human
scene
there you go
here's my
project
so
here is the texture
oh yeah and I need to put up the
premium no so I can see which
oh which window is active for on the
stream we're just still
which I still look like keep forgetting
I'll put it here at the top of it I feel
like it's a good place
so you said you were adding Minor
Details the other day what were those oh
yeah I've been like tweaking it's like
this stuff on the fiction is not
nothing like huge stuff
like
anyway I've been made this all ugly
stuff here making a bit smoother
yeah like
using a bit high quality tongue texture
instead of it's not a huge difference
it's a very minor
and stuff like that
so
are stretched up these textures slightly
so
the texture on the ears are
not as stretched out which is of course
I guess it's easy from the inside
it's still not exactly the same skin
here but
yeah I mean it doesn't flow together but
that's asking way too much for me
but it's very very very minus things
there I could do a stream but yeah
but it was easy to just do this like
tweaks
I wasn't I wasn't doing anything major
though
[Music]
so
[Music]
I'm going to add the body textures here
[Music]
and we'll see how well that goes
I really should connect this thing this
and this
well not like that
her name
maybe it looks like that it really look
like a summer mood
[Music]
yeah I didn't know
member Miss
saw it is that it's an expression let me
see
so yeah what is expected to
so I should probably connect these two
because it's these two parts
and also
it should be a scene alone is
which is here
it's not like
I don't need to put these seams here but
it does help me like seeing where
everything else
oh yeah
I think it's very
[Music]
he he's amazed
[Music]
what do you say
[Music]
thanks a lot of effort making these
models
so I need to put on my sportswear
so yeah I should definitely put these
two together
foreign
[Music]
well I managed to mirror this one
that's a bit funny
[Music]
there we go
[Music]
so then I just need to mark this but
apparently there's no like good warping
Tunes in this mode for some reason
yeah
like
sorry you can put the cursor here and
then I have like this
[Music]
[Music]
yeah I can work
warp it like that but there's no such
thing in here unless it's a different
combination
[Music]
it's in a very useful too
[Music]
I do have other teams like he's
about
if I had
[Music]
like something here
[Music]
let me think
[Music]
yeah I don't need
ass pink
ass pink
beginning
you get some ass
that was of course not what I meant yet
[Music]
that way I can do now is
do that
let me see
like that
and then I
oh yeah I can't flip it around yes
to make it that actually
foreign
foreign
[Music]
Ty
how many points can I have
I can have quite a few okay kids
okay I don't know how many points I
don't know
[Music]
[Music]
oh
foreign
[Music]
I'm trying to
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
It looks interesting
now he's speaking my language and
literally
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I like messing around sometimes
there's no point to this it's just me I
need the phone
[Music]
thank you
this is everything lots of three strikes
I don't know it
that's
I mean
I've heard him like mansion
okay
don't have any experience with their
branding so
it does I purchase
I had about ready for breakfast
I had homemade burger for breakfast
wait what I'm pressing the wrong button
here we go
so
now back to blending
so I want to add a secondary material
which would be cocoa
and then I'm gonna sign this Here and
Now
it's yeah it has some weird effects
but yeah it's this seam I wanted to get
rid of
and yeah if you see these dots here
that's a different part different
effects going on but as I was resolutely
technology is wearing a striped jumpsuit
and looks neat it doesn't look that bad
actually I wouldn't
well I'm not a fan of stripes
but
I could wear something like that in my
life
wait why is this
that one
[Music]
this is slightly annoying to look at
because I don't need to heal
[Music]
and now it's on on in
that's not good
that's no good
[Music]
thank wash my ones paint
well give him some pets then
what what kind of pets do she want ish
to eat
thank you
[Music]
you're a bad question I see it takes a
claws into my leg that's the nice
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
can be so silly they want they want pets
but then they they like
me with the clouds
[Music]
like
[Music]
Romney
I can't
nothing you were doing
hurting me
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
laughs
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
let's do the rabbit
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you for stopping by alerting
[Music]
and their King wasn't working I like the
sound of that
[Music]
we're just working I'm working on this
too
[Music]
3D model
[Music]
I love it rain
giraffe as we know giraffes have
a race of love
enough
[Music]
no there's no music happens
foreign
[Music]
but
yeah
oh yeah this thing is the same
[Music]
so
I guess this will be more
oriented space at least
[Music]
party pon pon
parties
[Music]
it's a party when pumpkin is in the
house
[Music]
it's so cute
except during the pro making the
process of making it and you have
working and like the working progress
pages
let me oh yeah Sketch rabbit yeah let me
find it
here we go wait is it that small
[Music]
that's blue
well I'll make it finger
here we go
[Music]
the initial sketch the more
I guess cleaner face and when it's
finished
everything during the sketch everything
try it the first one is a creepy
but then when I made it
[Music]
I mean it doesn't look like a rabbit
[Music]
it didn't it didn't feel like I was
going to I was getting anywhere with it
but like it's
just too ugly
there's not it's not gonna make the
other emotes
I didn't feel the same but then this one
is felt a Timber
[Music]
so if you're an artist yourself and you
feel like
let's continue it will need to work
again
[Music]
yeah it will just
be creeping here
[Music]
that's the background of the chat
foreign
[Music]
I
[Music]
usually don't do that
but there's no point of keeping them but
I don't know
I have such a hard shot but
it's hard for me to delete stuff
yes
people are going to be so confused when
you come in here
[Music]
[Music]
true
thank you
I look at the rainbow
[Music]
oh it doesn't tell me
look Rambo yes
it doesn't tell me which song is
currently playing that's a bit silly
it is uh OBS built in music player
and for some reason it doesn't tell me
which song it is playing
but I know the artist's name
like I could look it up because
um
I have put the artists all all of the
songs
in a single folders like this
older of this source
the other one is chillhop
which and play music from which is what
I mentioned about that for my about page
I did come back time regarding because
you're allowed to play the music on your
stream and keep it in your vault which I
prefer I don't want to everything I play
in on on the stream I want to be in the
vault I don't want anything to be feel
bad
it's fine that other people do it I
don't care but I know it's easy what do
you want TV streaming
but wait why didn't this one go like
this
that's a bit weird
but I don't want to filter out voice
anyway now the seam is gone
so now I can
see
because that's no longer a scene
this is a whole piece of protection
which is fine
when it gets at the TS redeem it will be
sketched out
in that case I need a crispy points
I mean I wouldn't
like
I guess I could have it yesterday
[Music]
I wish I had a working computer so I
could write some music for your
non-gaming experience
yeah
that would be nice
[Music]
still there hanging out in the
background
so back here
that means I got some empty planes up
here
[Music]
so
let's see if I can do something about
that
[Music]
but part of the body is this
[Music]
the arm okay
I read the music in the past but my
computer crashed and took my work with
it
again
[Music]
and you never went back that's that's it
here
[Music]
thank you
wait what's this part does the neck
really needs my separate part
you could attach it to this one as well
I should do that
okay
[Music]
because again should have a seam in the
back yes
sign it here
we go
[Music]
now
[Music]
someone sent me right
[Music]
at least for some reason
there you go
[Music]
that was before I had a job so I didn't
have money to replace it also why I
didn't have a backup didn't have money
from it yeah same for me
and I haven't bought a new computer yet
because I never needed one
you never felt you need to go back
between
then watch
and
knows our case he he composes music
did you enjoy that
thank you
now it's starting to look good
yeah I know he does he uses Ableton Live
can it does it lime
which is able to do
sorry for the obvious jokes
[Music]
don't apologize for your humor
nice
if I will apologize for my healer
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
music that is playing during the
countdown before the stream starts that
song is actually composed by
Noah's archives themselves
themselves himself
or Noah I would assume his name is
Ben
which is also on my about page
oh I think it is
oh
I will
I would let him know that he has
composed the generator
[Music]
shame is not here
[Music]
he has put so much effort into it and
[Music]
there is anyone else is using it so I'm
not sure
how he came to the competition and I
said generic switch song
[Music]
laughs
[Music]
foreign
how it should be
[Music]
and that that obviously isn't irrelevant
and
that's your problem trying to balance
[Music]
it has this curve but
[Music]
I enjoy listening change when watching
Japanese people cross the screen
and you got somewhere but uh
[Music]
and you got some more bodies in here
[Music]
I rarely use it but I do have
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
not perfectly but
[Music]
yeah we imagine just continue like this
no
right
sometimes it messes up
let's start with that
[Music]
I don't know why it doesn't sometimes
laughs
there yeah
behind it on the front back
foreign
thank you
[Music]
foreign
oh
[Music]
all right the story I forgotten about
that
oh yeah
don't forget about the store
as you probably do that so I can come
back quicker and watch this exactly that
sounds good
[Music]
I will be here when you come back
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and
15 tomorrow
[Music]
there you go nah
we'll see if you can make it
[Music]
how are you timing me
Maybe
you might have been going then
what do you mean bye bye
see you soon
[Music]
yeah this is bad
much better than before
that means I can remember this same
thing
[Music]
as it
not full corporate with me there you go
it seems good
if you hear of any accidents it's
Antonio we really won't be me
but I wasn't planning on like
[Music]
I'm planning on I wasn't I wasn't that
was wouldn't really be my conclusion
[Music]
oh an accent well that must be here
nothing young
[Music]
I mean who else would it be
question just reverse the links to
what's going on in these separate parts
anyway
now she got the best piece on the side
there she
can delete this now
[Music]
and let me say over and they should
[Music]
refresh
dang it nice though
that's something you can do
but yeah if I should merge the two
pieces of legs together
before it wouldn't it be different
I don't know maybe I'll keep it like
that
almost perfect in there
like it was meant again uh that one did
not perfect then there
everyone could dream
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so much for trying to make it more
compact
[Music]
please
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you for following
welcome welcome
to the Paw Pals Community for four
pounds
partnership
[Music]
I hope
you enjoy the Stream
I will be making
one pond
oh
is it my first seminar
in Crash
and good form
it's about time
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
well in that case you guys you know that
[Music]
and do that
I don't know
so this would be boring
[Music]
this will just be the colored bunny
of all of this stuff
so now
point is to have clothes down here but
it looks kind of in there it's kind of
hard to see but it's easy to see here
but
yeah it doesn't need to be perfectly
split into
the body is still a big important thing
after all characters so
[Music]
oh
[Music]
foreign
memories really not reliable
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
foreign
they are tied to Coco's hair so they
would actually animate
shooting to her hair
that's right yeah it's one way like
proper physics but they will hopefully
animate what
when
to a satisfying degree
yeah she probably
but I like like 20 pixels of planning
but that might just be means
foreign
[Music]
foreign
to be clever but
so much for being clever
[Music]
[Music]
yeah that's it that
it's like another thing matters anyway
but
there we go
this means that now if I save this
is all the same Impressions it's fair
enough
it has a lot of fights and kind of
privacy things you know
so
I'm very smart I'm here ever after this
now
that works now I just need to
basically said everything to the other
material and there we go
well
like
I think I think I said it's kind of or
it's perfectly fine if you want like
major reference to Pom-Pom
foreign
part about like
have having actually born on this
depends on how far you want my mentally
that but
and of course as can be seen here
there's this pattern which I
as well
now
I will you know
I made a mess of my dress that rhymes
well I guess I'll put it in a wash later
now at the end of that
[Music]
I don't want them do you like
[Music]
in the rest practice
[Music]
print
[Music]
oh that's him
[Music]
that episode
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
event
all right all right see there you go
zoom in
also pony every sort of adding more
detail to your character not just a
basic dresses swimsuit
but it's really fun
the dress is lovely it got the lines
ripping around it
and it swimsuit is cute too
you got a nice tough to face
and a nice big bow and a head
think she can turn into a rabbit
apparently
foreign
[Music]
here
oh yeah I added the
foreign
like that
but
if you know me that much
more scaling mode is accepted
billionaire
okay
all right
now I just need to change the way it
does the
so I think that's
the only time
sorry let's see now of course I had just
thought adding a bit more detail in my
[ __ ] cat's Beauty
like having suggestion
because I don't know why do you like it
try to decide we're not too much going
on makes it easier to draw as well
I need to invert it green
yes now
he's a bit smoother
so
if we go to blending
electric blender again
and then
look at her eye
because it's not too reasonable
and then I will save
[Music]
same thing
that and then I update it
and I will look at the eye
slight slightly different apparently in
anything
anyway it should be slightly smoother
anyway not that it was like she looked
weird before
the ARG tell it to them please
you like their signs
obviously the three textures what they
did landscape here is just blender to
equal reflection obviously they will be
different in the game
so whatever the game that's
but now
this part
need some
texture to it like that
[Music]
which was what I was actually going to
see
so now I go to blend I look at the pony
which
and I open it
yep it's
there you go
oh no she's naked you don't look at her
there is nothing to look at I guess
it's fine
color it's kind of feels a bit weird
that she doesn't wear any clearance but
thank you
I guess the only thing left is the tail
when it comes to everybody
yet but that would be considered
clothing
because I will have it changed based on
outfit
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
I do want some more detail to them
[Music]
then there's looking flat like this
[Music]
and before if someone asks
[Music]
I will not add poor pets one instant
hair Palm pants
[Music]
[Music]
someone have asked me
ad for pets or like have yeah anyway
thank you so I will duplicate these so
these are only used to generate another
map I need
so I'm switch back to just our material
and this one I will use as the guide
with a normal map
which I can do like that but
[Music]
I will first
add slightly more detail before I do
something with stop dividing
which I will then
pass it more accurately that's what I
wanted to do
can I have it
do you want to touch your feet
I would imagine a feet
to be quite soft foreign
[Music]
something like that maybe
[Music]
I always feel this good luck I need good
luck
[Music]
I mean it's not like my feet gives me
any good luck
there we go look at this
that was a bit messy down here
let me
try to
[Music]
try to smooth this out
[Music]
now if I do this yeah it's a bit smaller
than you find
means actually for me but okay
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
enough for me I guess
[Music]
um
[Music]
she must be extra lucky
hello nefarian
as I said yeah
I don't feel like my fins or any any
lucky
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
so how did I
don't know I mean that way too
remember how I did
[Music]
now show me how to do
none of that
[Music]
first you need to go to YouTube and
remember and remind myself how to do it
again
foreign
[Music]
at explaining how to do that
payment was this one
it was maybe this one
[Music]
so let's see
um
so
so what we do
is we have this so we have the high
quality version
B
k
back because I can't do that
[Music]
um
which is which is the one that
solidify sync
more smooth so it's solidifier
performance mode
[Music]
yeah there we go
compensate for how
well
it sounds like that there
so just a patent
it's not a bit compensating for you
[Music]
before I have this subdivision function
makes it appear smaller but
it says that this is all I need
all I need
practice
so I should
increase the speed of the video
[Music]
so my name is a normal map
and very simple
and of course connect normal to normal
because that makes sense
very quickly
and then
we need an image texture that I will
.def I don't remember
[Music]
and then
create a new image that the
it will be based on and I will multiply
it by four because one
that's the size the level news
really matter what kind of this sitting
so the David float would be a very high
[Music]
but yeah
just generate that
[Music]
and of course uh
normal black Mustangs are non-color
all right
[Music]
and then we can simply switch to the
image here which is called Empire
because it's never good but giving his
name but that doesn't matter
so first off you select the
mesh you want to
and use as the reference for you and
normal Banking and then you select the
local version
this makes it so that the it might be
trying the hardest scene because they
are overlapping each other but now it
has an insight
let me
[Music]
[Music]
oh
that's nice
well I can simply apply it
and then I can go into another case
select down inside of it and delete it
and just keep outside
let's disable that really looks fine
okay anyway back back to whatever
so yes
it will be tricky to see because there
are inside each other here but you can
kind of see here where the low poly is
the one that is very
it might be very very sharp here while
the high quality is the one that goes
very expensive
and it's a low poly that is yellow on
the high point there's orange that means
as the yellow one is the one that is
actually this is the active one of but
both are selected
Okay so
I don't reflect it it must be a little
pocket that is selected in the active
one
sorry I've been so popular I've been
here
usually need six meters again
I just came back from a 10 kilometer
chart
and
I haven't done that in a very long time
I should do it someday again maybe not
the old game I usually use more
I can't understand it
[Music]
so
and then we're going to use
rendering it has to be Cycles
and then we will use baking we are not
going to do a regular rendering we're
going to use the render engine because
we're going to use the bake functional
[Music]
and we're going to make I don't know
and it's important to it's not
[Music]
okay because Unreal Engine does a wide
object Direction so
you should set that to minus
it's it's minus four
so and so that inverse the y-axis which
is the green axis because Unreal Engine
and blender have the y-axis inverted
from each other it really depends which
corner is considered as zero
and they are opposite of each other
and then we should give us a way to
change that
maybe this
but I'll keep it
in the moment
it's connected to active
apparently disconnected
and then
you should have the
[Music]
Extrusion Max resistance
in this case
it can set it
oh yeah yeah so the maximum distance can
be zero but the Extrusion must have a
certain distance
and that would be how far out
yes and it's what has to look for the
high poly version
which in this case is not much
then we can measure slightly here we can
see
maybe a decimeter it should be fine
you can work with that
we shouldn't be too high I think because
that
that's going to cause other issues
like this is a decimator maybe
okay
now we actually decided to
much less than that but that's because
you might be working a smaller skin but
that's fine so
yeah I would say
actually maybe not even in this meeting
would be enough
[Music]
actually
it's kind of hard to measure
actually let's put it at
one and a half nice to meet you
so 15 centimeters
here we go
and that's also neat picture if you
didn't know so it shows in meters but
you can you can write 15 centimeters
15 millimeters no 15 decimeters
drifting
hectometer that actually works 15
decameters it works too
15 seconds
and that should be it I think
[Music]
and that should really be it so make
sure I have this correctly set
local active this set
yeah that's fine
it will output that one
and then press back and now it is baking
and it's not taking too long I mean it's
not the fastest computer but
I mean reposition myself
there we go
I think
what's going on here now
[Music]
yeah working
and then the pictures should show up
here
you don't need to bring this up here but
yeah there we go if you want to see the
result
[Music]
and here we go
no
yes um
I'll be cracking going on here
but that's fine
[Music]
so I'm gonna save this
as my
doesn't matter what you call it
College business in anime
can I see that
[Music]
okay
going back to photoshop
I did save it at 64. you know 16 bit
instead of the regular 8-bit per Channel
and we can see
I guess it's very hard to see but yeah
it's in the corner
[Music]
all right this [ __ ] took too much in
let's flat
foreign
corner
but that's it but maybe you're able to
see it as I shift
right
when you can show
oh there we go no that's not
the one I wanted to show
thank you
I guess this now it's strange
but anyway
um it's gonna help hidden behind the
chat great
you're doing great
all right let's give me a moment
well too much
okay my mouse
stop
well
oh
I guess that's good enough
pointing to go there we go
so there we go
you're gonna block your chat
so I'll send my mouse around this area
the left side is showing the 8-Bit
values and the right side shows the 64 a
bit 16 bit value
and then
[Music]
as you can see the 8-Bit value can only
change
from 30 25 and it's showing that but
that's the only balance can be between
all right and in this whole area it's
it's only ships in convention by one
value because that's the smallest it can
do but the 16-bit value on the right
side those values change a lot
if they have some those values are so
much bigger
and they are 256 times bigger so then
it's a they have a much higher
resolution to work within
such higher Precision this proves that
the the image is generated
uh
was actually a 16 bit image
so
and and a reason why I want to save it
at 16 bit is because I can now work with
this
in 16 bit
the result as converting the resulting 8
bit
[Music]
and not lose any quality in the 8-Bit
version
[Music]
it has 8 bit per Channel not just 8-bit
in total
[Music]
you might have heard about like 8-bit
graphics
well it means that they can only use a
total of 256 colors
but this is 8-bit per Channel
which is like 16 million colors
[Music]
fidelity
[Music]
and the first thing I want to do
[Music]
is to split off the three channels we
got red
green and
save this one to play here and blink
[Music]
second thing I want to do is
I really don't want anything extra
no this is just a
bit selector
another thing this is 64-bit selector
which is a bit stupid
[Music]
and there's no settings to it
nope I win
and when
foreign
like now
essentially not thinking actually
the only thing when you make those
renders for like
poses and stuff and then you want to do
adjust the color and brightness and
stuff like that you should say that's 16
bits
per Channel and then when you
and then you just do the balancing color
balance and stuff
in that case you want the high enough
solution and then you convert it to
eight bit when you're done it's
important to merge all the effects so
restaurant style picture and then you do
the
blood
yes
so
foreign
I'm trying to
figure out how to best care about this
I mean I can just
I could eat that
well
I didn't mean to do that
of course then I can apply
blur to it
make a smooth transition
and then simply do it for
all of them
this air
anyway
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
for this one
here we go
yeah of course you might be the one as
well music is really chill
I'm happy you think so I really want it
well
[Music]
I didn't it's not that I was looking for
chill music it's just that
[Music]
the music I found was chilling
music I could legally play on this thing
guys
[Music]
so going back here
and I need
when
I have to hold on anything let's call it
funny
and then I copy all the everything here
there we go
but then I need to figure out
[Music]
[Music]
yes he has to make sure I get this
correcting
this is our chill tank
[Music]
so I think the first
she said we subtract
and this is set to add
this should
you know
is it the other way around
I kind of neat effects but
working with me
yeah this this is
and they should be a full effect
and there we go
there is a normal mapping on the feet
so are you gonna play the handistic
thinkings
I will
my current uh
plans
is to go through the spiral and crash
games which I'm still very soon and then
and then we'll see
I guess I will do it
and I will let you know if I'm doing it
and more like when I'm doing anything is
so are you not missing out
so back to blending
[Music]
now because
I mean I need to fix this
now because blending
is now going
I haven't done it yet but if after it
boom there we go
this is it
now
I mean it's it's a bit bubbly
where is that
foreign
looks like this 3D here even though it's
[Music]
basically flat
but yeah I need to
[Music]
balance it out against
[Music]
me so
[Music]
and now it's
now it's even
it's not like you're going to look close
letter fit against
but even from a distance is still
expired
I'll give you compare
wasted on a map
to no no I was like
let's
action
it is actually
depth to it
[Music]
but yeah uh
I'm not sure what's going on here though
oh yeah they're there on top of each
other that's what's going on
[Music]
the same thing on the back side
so I need to get that in order
like annoyance but
easy defeats
like what's the distance here
thank you
please let's say 40. foreign
[Music]
this one is a bit more compact for some
reason
[Music]
another distance here you can stand
I'm basically 40 years right
[Music]
there you go
[Music]
now
my apparently only these are one of them
I mean by silly
[Music]
nothing that I repeated process can't
fix let me down
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
but now this one is further down
that's the problem
[Music]
hey thank you for the noise
[Music]
it can't be heard
[Music]
but yeah
so
exporting the new UV
foreign
and also
yeah I'll put the legs upside down for
some reason
and me
just quickly flip them around and
fix
especially why I placed them upside down
it doesn't affect the UV much
[Music]
the UV render that is
the rendering
it does mean I have to
expand here
[Music]
yeah let me close these
uh sorry I've got switched me
[Music]
I did not get a bit more than anyone
but like Anthony
[Music]
I can't need that to put these in here
and then I guess I can delete
oh I didn't know it was that much
[Music]
[Music]
oh I see let's go okay
thank you
okay
okay
does this change in me
[Music]
oh no
all right
[Music]
it changes much in the
I was like
uh fun question because I'm bored you're
free to ask almost everything
your your tears but just ask away how
would you feel it's someone around you
that was a good question I actually
wouldn't feel so great about it I feel
okay that's
I'm not think yeah I would feel so great
having a clone of myself
so if someone already has to clone me
yeah I don't think that would be
happy about that
I I don't think
such a detailed answer to that one more
than I would have
[Music]
now
naming
this one
think a bit more space a bit more
overlapping
as long as I don't get too much
it's not like it's a hard limit or
something
I can do whatever I want
foreign
[Music]
so and the next is to
export another smart
[Music]
and micro blender
[Music]
nice
about this
thank you
oh yeah maybe I should updated
[Music]
it is fun fun
with detail pause growing in it is
[Music]
unless you want
I'm going to find parts or something
[Music]
the more defined press
[Music]
I guess I guess
[Music]
how would I do that
[Music]
in a way that looks good
[Music]
and have a higher peace
I'd accidentally
I can't adjust the heighten it
afterwards
[Music]
I will place it then I guess I'll
skip you
[Music]
yes and
thank you
and yes they weren't done more noise
[Music]
so
[Music]
there's like the party
in the middle
[Music]
so let me get the
[Music]
oh it's not fun
I haven't done it in a way give me a
moment
[Music]
it's the
um
[Music]
okay this is this one
there we go let me switch back
[Music]
here we go
actually this is restographic I should
uh
[Music]
converted your shape
[Music]
so starting off with our rough outline
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
that's your way
it's not like an option to move it
[Music]
really
[Music]
[Music]
I guess it's not this bracket
[Music]
I guess it doesn't matter much
[Music]
thank you
I don't know how that would look
and it should probably just
[Music]
and let's let's take a look
[Music]
in the same order I'm fine
when it surprised me 15th
[Music]
no is it down the correct right
what
[Music]
yo yo hello Rocket Man ah I I try to
update still fine
let's look at
where's McDonald's here
even though it's supposed to be wider
going into the way the model is made
so so how are you gonna make the dress
I mean I mean
by modeling it
I'm not really sure how it sounds
interesting
foreign
adjustment
oh non-stopping in
Santa
Rosa welcome I mean will it be any match
or just like a texture skin well it
wouldn't work as a texture and that
would be some
yeah
yeah but it I will make the dress a
separate mesh
and then I will make a copy of this mesh
which
I should have merge with this ready
and
and then I will let the
copy of the body mesh remove the
polygons that are hidden completely by
the dress and then I will take the copy
of the body and the dress and Export
that
yes he
one lady
[Music]
and yeah let's play
thank you
and I hope it will work out
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
perfect
I hope he helped anything that will work
foreign
[Music]
has to
redeem the sportswear
but I don't think it should be like
I think that's like this style and crash
to have it like for me
okay check that
it's not like one point has blackout
lines
but I can't make it
foreign
[Music]
I don't know I really don't know
[Music]
okay until you have to fix another left
hand
now everything like this
I think this shape
but Coco has so many questions in the
base game will you replace them all and
I will replace several of them and I
have some ideas
for for many of them at the moment
and I made that document but I'm not
ready
show it
it's it's very
I guess the time scuff don't work I
don't know and
I don't know if that's a proper term
so first
and
cocoa has
six times five that is 35 skins
no wait that starts keeps not certified
let's start this key
6 times 5 that is 6 times 10 divided by
2 means no 16 half of 16 seconds when
they get certified as 30 schemes
and I have ideas for
15 skins at the moment
that's half of them
so the idea is
well it will be her breast
and then the two
outputs you can redeem on stream which
is the sportswear and the swimsuit
and then
I want to take the Unicorn outfit Coco
has but then changed it to be a bunny
outfit
so one point is going to be like a bunny
suit
has
a bunny
and then I also wanted to see if I can
make Coco's outfit work on Pom-Pom
it's a basically take the existing
outfit
do you stay here
balloon cocoa which I think I was
thinking of just modifying the balloon
and just make it more appear more fun
which shouldn't be too much work
properly
there is the pillow poly version
hopefully wouldn't take too long to make
and also the
skeleton
a version of Coco
which I'm gonna take the skeleton and
make the necessary changes to make it
adapted for compound
now I wish I had I should have
so now I will create a height map shall
we
in the magnitude and wait no nothing in
the background
and then
foreign
[Music]
it's not a smart normal map
2.0 on Smart page.com
and so many simple website you just
press load
pick the picture you want which is a
height map white is
high up in black is four down
and
then I picked the smallest designs for
the same
I shouldn't I should pick the big size
big fire size quick to say oh it's not
because it's
it's just temporary
[Music]
ready to go
okay
oh yeah
and then after learning it you must
press invert G convert there is
thank you
and then you can increase the is if you
want maybe 80.
press save you get the picture to use
and I don't really need this in this
scene because this is meant to go
I didn't what you mean in the normal
and bring this down
yeah
[Music]
okay I should just
name these so I can keep track of these
These are the poles
and now
so yeah do I still want
and that's the
normal version and now
I'm scrumptish the annoying part of
[Music]
splitting the channels
but
[Music]
there isn't
explain the channels
then
30.
where's this thing
it shouldn't be any red
that's weird
um
and this shouldn't be 30.
that's a little bit weird
it doesn't matter
anyway
I'll just have to work with search
instead
right
there you go
now is this another 28
no that's actually
wait
and also
invert these
okay lens
nice nice
you can do the same thing about Queen
but this one is on it today
add that inward
this one also has the oh sorry I been so
focused on working so I didn't see your
comments I'm so sorry about it and
welcome Raiders let me let me just read
the common second I know
um
yeah so I will pump and hold her own
laptop or something else well since Coco
has animations and where she uses the
tablet as a tablet I will keep it as a
tablet but I would probably do some
redesign because I need to make sure it
works in front of pants fingers so hello
greens thank you so much for the reads
and welcome radius
hit the green evening
sir greens what what were you up to
and
the initial thing
yeah you were playing with uh
I I know I know
many courage
ous
I haven't really
gotten much into the community
[Music]
I end up two of them assume they were in
that there are only six more people I
haven't really learned it
there are so many streamers
there are many
[Music]
so many nice people
[Music]
oh my God
I think I forgot about
[Music]
so subtract otherwise
[Music]
again one is in writing
to try
now it's correct
and relative Beauty
now this would be correct
I should be able to save these
and maybe I treated on me tea
actual
black texture on the body without going
back to you blend there
and back to your comments
[Music]
oh
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
it's my chance working properly now
where is the let me see my attachment
Spanish
now
[Music]
oh thank you
eh
wait how do I
how do I get the
yeah when I'm back okay so yeah creams
are supposed to rain in me and then I is
working the autopilot and just really I
was at reading in my mind and it it's
rotate instead of
shout out I'm stupid and then I didn't
even be an eyes how do I get oh wait
this is how I do it
yeah there we go now now this channel is
working as it should yeah I'm staying
when it was the first time I mean it
happens there was a cinnamon yep anyway
I got to look at dreams
oh wait Green's racing
and when I'm back to the store I had to
take a shower yet just run down putting
everything away okay like this well
hopefully
hopefully everyone I only went back
well okay I was about to do let me do it
properly this time so
there we go this is what I wanted to do
that's the command and that's that point
beautiful now it's worked yeah it was
yeah and also and also I had this
preview window at the top of the chat
and at the top of the chat it tells me
what if it's in the shout out or the
raids I couldn't even see the excuse the
rate otherwise I would have reacted to
it
the issue of only having one screen
I did find a cable but I could because
this computer has an HTML out I have a
screen which does not have an xmi in but
it has a DVI
which is well
it's it's kind of the same line in the
way it's a digital video port
it just doesn't have the audio or like
other stuff HDMI has however
when I do connect the computer to the
screen the screen turns black
she disappears from time to time
it does that a few times and then it
turns
just the picture was completely gone
and if it just disappeared like randomly
it wouldn't matter much because that's
not the screen I'm actually working on
but then it just kind of completely
disappears and then
and then when I can't use it in the
morning
that's right I tried
the average
oh oh
foreign
yeah yeah it has to when I start the
stream it has to show me ads otherwise
you will get an ad when you join and
that would be very annoying when I get
traded and I'm gonna get sad
so I just I get through with the ads at
this as when I started streaming because
I
we started the Stream
it wants to show us right at the start
and I have the ads play at the start
because that's when I have the countdown
and that's fine
you got a look into my personal life now
you know actually technically
I cannot see which is if it's I guess it
yeah
I don't know how you do
and you were streaming but when I stream
which I do from OBS streaming client
when I do a raid
I can actually not see the channel I'm
reading from the streaming client itself
there might be a function to do that the
only thing I get from this stream
is
the uh
as chat
[Music]
now
so I actually did not see your stream
while I was please know what was going
on
and his chat became all weird and then I
noticed something was weird
so back to modeling now uh that wasn't
for me
I I fixed this texture so I added
this
so now I guess it's hard to see
that's very hard to see you just feels
so I think that I guess I need to dates
to be stronger
so let's make it twice as strong as the
first test
so that is why I barely
so that is
I guess it's because of the let me
lower the strings
after outline because I can say
you can have
and let me remove the outline first
first test
see him
yeah
yeah another gift it does like
so this is only shiny
I guess I guess that's enough really
[Music]
I don't eat anymore
the only question is is how should it be
higher up though that I think right
about I don't know
so yeah
do you do teaching multiple I started on
an email
or Benny
I have not completing it and I haven't
touched it for quite a while
um
but I we did come came to the agreement
that
just in case this would happen that he
would only pay me after I've completed
yeah so in in the case that I'm not
pressured by any money anything like
that and since I haven't completed I
haven't got paid that's just right fine
it's our time bye for a while
so but
um because it was a human
emote and I'm not that great at humans
so if it's be back 30
I assume so
yes
why my Armenian we'll see you soon
but if it's like an animal of a furrier
of some sort
I could probably do it
like one of the
[Music]
SE are the very early emotes
wine
these are my
later emotes and I would say that I've
[Music]
guess it's not like a huge difference
later ones are
a bit better
so
we have pizza Landmark could probably
make it
[Music]
but at this very moment I'm actually
cleaning my house because I
I need to move
yeah I think I want a white and black
cat do you get there yeah that seems
more
more into what I'm probably will be able
to do
but yeah
um
which is probably the governance
after I moved
and settled in you turn my nucleus
[Music]
is there a reference for higher like
um
human proportions
[Music]
what's what's like the height
[Music]
well let me know if I if I should move
it
and I just place this random at the
moment
also
this is a bit confused if you are a
Raider or not
you wrote
yeah you wrote one two three five
messages were just
didn't recognize you as a reader but the
sixth one and now the seventh now you
are Radix
I have a white thin black cat irons so I
want it like my iron kit that makes
sense and so yeah
so basically uh
and throw furry version of your cats I
assume would that would be like what I
can do
unless you want like a feral version I
guess I could try that
it's a bit harder to do like emotions
and
Post-its and stuff I did I mean I did
one I think with one but that was
there was a silly one
I guess I could do like a pharaoh
version too
it's a bonus yes like the first one is a
bonus image for those who don't have
bits
everyone who has donated at least a
thousand bits which are four of them at
the moment
foreign
[Music]
so close
[Music]
which is part of the
leaderboard so that's public information
so
where's that again
998 bits that's so far away so
[Music]
let's see
so son of a
h
I'm a daughter of Adele anyway
I'm trying to like look at the
proportions here
yes I found like proportion
take a screenshot
and referencing by
another body applies to the whole thing
but according to this reference I found
[Music]
because I'm trying to make a
good height
yeah sorry my hands are so fast what are
my mind sometimes I've got to type in
ways
oh that's it
yeah I cannot recognize that I think
that is okay
[Music]
126.
and I just blades 35
by 126.
the safer place
enter the same
[Music]
sorry I'm not showing what I'm doing but
and
it's got my shirt working out that way
[Music]
is that a big quick working
361.
that means that it should be 100 pics or
something
well that can't be true
thank you
[Music]
yeah the proportion fun is not it's not
human
um
I only message it torso
so the the proportion of the head and
length wouldn't affect the area final
result
but yeah it's I guess I could just I oh
of it whenever I need to
[Music]
speak to those things
[Music]
I guess I could add a bit of shading
here if I
[Music]
make this
[Music]
which has it like this but if I invert
it
[Music]
in the glows like that
[Music]
make it softer and then
[Music]
trying to make it look good
[Music]
and
and there you go nuts
[Music]
that's looking yeah
[Music]
anyway in that life by any first further
adjustments can be made later I guess
and this didn't add Main
I'm saying it's just about here so I
need to unwrap the pain
[Music]
so I guess yeah it's nothing on the
inside
yes I'm just
[Music]
no that's not like that's like
[Music]
but same day and is this like a mod for
a game
as it says
thank you crash
yes I'm replacing cocoa
in Crash band could fall it's about time
well it's well one of course
but depends on what it was probably
obviously
but yes uh you are right it's a it's a
month
[Music]
[Music]
so here we go
[Music]
there's a lot of parts
[Music]
another piece I should be able to
remember done actually
let's clearly see
[Music]
clear
and unwrap again
no all right
oh no not exactly how I thought it I
guess that would be a lot because
um and yeah I did not shoot the type of
stream
Tick Tock has done this too
tick tock
they only depends on how you're viewing
the Stream
[Music]
obvious
they added edit my team
do you tried the happy Titans clarify
what's going on
as best as I can
[Music]
so yeah
and since
[Music]
Coco has a bunch of outfits I will also
have a bunch of
with this protein like this
foreign
number
like it's June satisfying
now both
[Music]
must look straight
[Music]
I posted this stuff on Tick Tock myself
tick tock
.com
which are the same videos right that's
not how you use the cap but you say
what's that what's the
what's the formats we used to
when when
I do have to do a captcha
there you go pump on the bun bun
there's or someone called
[Music]
the one one and and scored one and one
many
people
yeah so I made
[Music]
videos on YouTube I post them on Tick
Tock as well but where I crop them down
to one by one so
and they are everyone's going on YouTube
at least
and for some reason two of my videos
have gotten 99 views
and they've had the 1990s are quite a
while the other videos haven't gotten
that many and apparently the one I
really thought was going to be the most
popular is the least popular
stuff
that's interesting
um
because he's not worried about it
who are you way too am I don't worry
about it
we are
we are here we have enough
Satan don't worry about it
[Music]
and that one that one there we go it's
like everything
and now
I need to scan this down
to suitable sites
like a third
like one slash swing
yeah
and then I need to change the
[Music]
channel to Coco here we go
change smooth
and now
I guess it could be
[Music]
foreign
about the same
and add on my neck
[Music]
hard to see
scene
[Music]
and as I will see on the back but what
can I do about that
even though it's the back side is the
one you kind of going to see the most
anyway
so that's why you can set the seams on
the edges
on both edges
excitement
best guess this is fine
but that means I need to
place this somewhere
let me squeeze it in here
so
[Music]
move this stuff over it's important to
have some padding
otherwise you're going to get bleed
behind between the parts this is not a
huge problem here because there are only
like the same
thing white fairness I can't know the
I want to care but then I have to make
sure I'm gonna
[Music]
maybe 50 pixels down
and before I forget them
about it I need to also make the same
change
[Music]
2D forms
[Music]
oh yeah that's another Orange
and
[Music]
is it subtract
this set and
and then and there were like and I'm not
sharing with them doing at the moment
and then this one she went down 50
pixels
save
and
export
now
if I
if I switch here
yeah it's slightly above that's uh to
avoid any
leadership
don't believe
well that's not going to help me anyway
I bite a bit
it moved over a bite
and this is where twice
[Music]
while I guess I can't move it further
down now
[Music]
lay down 50 more than
since I fixed it
allowed me to change
and then I can move it
50 in that direction
is there a moving name part on the
normal map
to end it here
but don't work update and understand yes
so the only thing I know how I have to
do is expand the party
so it's
covering the whole foot
there we go again
I don't know how much is caught by the
is being heard
[Music]
but I don't of course not always know
how much this camera Harry
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
yeah it doesn't matter too much so
this one has it I have protection
have these first texture showing
but that's about it
now I can't save
normal map
and the
I was gonna say the normal
texture
weird
[Music]
so update
of course
you can't update it there we go
well
I didn't mean it around
so detained
let me join together
as well
I do want to do some
so actually let me split off the theme
duplicate the tail and then I want to
make the tail uh
higher
I want that like
detains
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
and
let's see
[Music]
okay
another thinking what I wanted now it
looks a bit weird
this is of course the nice comment here
but

welcome readings
[Music]
it's all about family which is all about
family we're family here

welcome everyone
I am
I am pumpkin
I think
nah a bunny
and I am at this moment creating
a 3D model of of my Persona which is
meant to be put into crash bandicoots
the like
well not anymore the latest question One
latest platforming
and it's about time
allow your character design thank you
it was but yeah
body contact
Violet Echoes on ink bunny
or a commission
and then I got this bunny and it's
really
that I'm happy with the design
is on my about page
[Music]
but yeah thank you for stopping by ahead
it means a lot to me let me uh do the uh
there
shout out I shocked at this time
actually managed to
the tradition company
illustrate that was embarrassing and
so
what were you up to
can I call it what what can I call it a
Bailey would that be
your name
[Music]
I don't
I I hope
uh kidney
thank you
thank you
Roxy's
we were playing what two means of edit
pinch
then switch to a weird cold game
and I actually don't know about any game
so
you can let me know anything you want
about so how
yeah what the games are and how your
stream went if you if you would like to
I'm interested
and yeah you can call me Bailey be
I think you wrote the same thing I say
stuff in a few days ago while at work
and kept testing oh if you've been
[Music]
um
a spy
everything thank you for
thank you so much for reading
it's such a big great remember like two
people here something before
or whatever it would say that was
that which isn't good at counting as it
is so
BB and now yeah that makes sense
I think
yeah I think Bailey is the easiest for
me but yeah
thank you
yeah I I do have the hot
it's so hard for me to remember names in
general
so if the
safety nickname
is basically just part of the name
that is much easier for me to remember
because some people have given me
like you can call me there's some
completion at least your name but yeah
sure but I'm not going to be able to
remember that
and it's also a bit confusing if I refer
to someone by name and that's not the
username and from my personal experience
being on other streams it's easier if
it's part of the news name for everyone
I think
but let's see another thing where I
brought streams on occasion by lowest
view account to take care of phones that
might need a bit more false divided I
just post that scene when to watch okay
yeah I do
and I think yeah I sometimes do you I
you I do prefer sorting streams by the
lowest count
because no that's mostly so
and
because there's a lot of popular
streamers with several thousand of
viewers and you can't really interact
with this streamers mostly maybe it's
through yes through redeems but if you
write something in chat you you're
likely not going to have
the stream even noticed that
and well I'm I'm happy for them being I
have gotten so popular but it's more fun
for me to uh
to actually chat with the streamer it's
more fun to find lower like yeah people
with but a few years
and it's of course better for them to
also get an anemia
and then
and then let's see if I find someone
yeah
I do try to rate people with
a little review counts
as well
hopefully
they might trade me back and it has
happened so
and it's nice
it was it's all about family where we're
family here if he
oh yeah
yeah
you know I ran off The Voice
so
and I do
streaming
uh they didn't want to remember that
and I
when yeah so
use three things on the stream at this
moment I guess
being the uh
this you know
trying to work at the same time I speak
that's they're not going to be great
then uh
so is this modeling
and then I'm playing Crash and spiral as
the two other things playing through
every crash Inspire game
[Music]
foreign
games
I'm also in the process of moving like
in real life
and
that's a lot of work
[Music]
so
[Music]
but I hope you have a good time
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
for the first time and then I'm just
laugh at the moment oh yeah
[Music]
and I I didn't want to check out Raiders
myself as well
and I usually just write down
the twitch his name and then I come by
but I will actually look at
I'm even streaming lately
I do like to
[Music]
get
um
[Music]
I usually try to find streamers who do
play Space Inspire and crash but they do
try to find streams throughout the means
too Brazil but it's easier to find is
[Music]
something I'm very familiar with and
then it's easy for me to get
into the community
[Music]
and then I
stick around as they play other games
so
foreign
Spyro
like
[Music]
you're going to do the first
because I'm I think I'm spying on your
schedule at the moment
and I could not find a premium stream
with Spyro but I see that you have it
scheduled for that would be next week
[Music]
I finished all other console games other
than I haven't seen oh
what's that
that's yeah I can't find
because I wanted to see what he played
recently it's not it's not anything you
played recently I assume
[Music]
you played unless unless it I haven't
seen anything
actually taking
but yeah but I'm interested I should
definitely
I I I'll have to
try to show up on a stream and
that stuff and yeah that explains it and
that's why it isn't sure but then yeah
that should definitely
should definitely give you a funnel but
and back take
them
you have you did follow me a while back
on the eighth a white back does that
of why that's what is a girl but
was it
[Music]
oh yeah
yeah I said I'm in yeah
oh yeah I can't run it because I'm not I
keep the Page open and then
and can I follow him okay
yes I can get there you go all right for
them
I don't have the browser open to say
performing yeah I'm running a laptop and
it's not doing the best performance
um I'm also streaming on single screen
it's nothing
I'm working with what I have it movement
it is working but
sometimes it can be
sometimes I do
it's anything since
but I hope
people enjoy it
[Music]
I don't have anything anymore okay
thank you for the following Darius the
snow
and welcome
to the
community
suggested by the hey
cute
what did
you determine what animal is purple
drinking
something nice about that
really cute aim of the hair
uh yeah and yeah I don't have any
understand here
party
eagle
oh it's the uh like a full body
dude style thing
yeah is that anything yeah I see yes
that sounds pain that sounds cute
I wouldn't mind having such a thing on a
as a bunny
foreign Ty
and I'm you know and I'm perfectly happy
with the reignited even though I know
some people aren't
too happy about
things but
whatever
[Music]
okay
I'll fix something up
art book one
of my sisters got me
oh you got the yeah
and also which is why I don't know if
it's obvious or not English is not my
native language
the
sometimes I might struggle with language
I didn't
I've actually not says what about me
because I know there's like concept art
in the game
is it like the physical form of that or
do they have even more
argument
[Music]
I know it's a lot more yeah it doesn't
kill
a lot more artistic artwork
it's a hard card thing you like okay
that's that is
what the game contains like 50 20 I
don't remember it's not too many
that that is a taste of the real thing
a hardcore that that's good that's a
nice quality hopefully it's good quality
eh
and I hope you seem satisfied with it
this one
[Music]
foreign
they have put a lot of
effort into the arch as and I do think
it looks
quite cute
there are some
obviously not Perfection but
it's very good still
and it's also important to note that
it's not uh it's not like an HD version
of the place in one game it it's
it is
they have just
reimagined some of the characters
anyway I had to sleep so I leave because
like yeah
thank you for thank you for doing that
in the horror
will have a good sitting it's leaving
and good night and thank you for reading
so is it very kind of you
and I I really Struck it right
I'm so introverted and
it's kind of crazy how
I'm streaming in the first place
yeah
I think everyone else here
came by and
they're still
still here
and if anyone
is curious about anything
I am willing to
when I guess I'll see
if you have any questions
sometimes I feel like people do
are curious about things today
they are
I guess afraid
maybe not the correct term of asking
questions
foreign
but I am
my favorite animal is rabbit
run away
it's a big surprise
and I am from Sweden
I speak Swedish natively that is my
native language
which inspired refer to English is not
my native language
and more of this
being a bit low here
we go that's sweet by and say
I would say
cool work so far thank you yeah I get
get put these stuff
I don't know that's kind of how I'm
imagination
it will work
I didn't know as soon as as soon as it's
working I
think
I'm getting I'm glad you like it
[Music]
a lot of effort
and that's a bit too much
[Music]
maybe it should be a bit softer actually
[Music]
let me
increase that
first
yeah one one more like that
that's more like it
that's more like it
and then
and then
remember more like that
[Music]
okay let's see I'm getting out of the
mates it is now
on this card I do yes sometimes I
haven't had people write to me on this
project something they could just
describe her
everything to me on chat because it was
nothing for anybody
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
um
[Music]
so now it looks like that
it's all edges it looks like yeah I like
that baby
[Music]
still no
with this fixed
[Music]
how far are these things
I must
[Music]
three centimeters so let's do
it
I guess
[Music]
so in the process
should be the same so what I do is I
duplicate things
select the texture which I'll use to
come title again
[Music]
which is this one
which has this at the moment but I'll
write that
[Music]
and then I will generate the normal
applicant
you know no one needs to
let's start with that
news
thank you
let's take too long let's get
don't respond at the bottom of the
screen shows the progress
the process the progress
probably
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
yeah I'm not expecting to show what's
happening there
because I haven't changed anything
it shouldn't work well I guess I'll try
again
maybe it was something I
don't know
I saw that I said everything correct
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
I guess I'll just
make a new one and Untitled
yeah
he says clear image before baking I
don't know
maybe it was because it's saying it or
something
and then they can be a bit weird
okay so apparently if you save the image
which I did
might have made my result in
it's referencing the file on the disk
and can't properly replace it
yeah now it works yes
there we go here's some
it baked in the uh
[Music]
the normal mapping of this thing that
that it shouldn't have done so let's
switch is over to
no material
[Music]
[Music]
and let's do it again it's that time
because it's Fourth time
it's the fourth time I've seen
we have lean you're still here thank you
for speaking your room nice
what's going on here
someone's
not poking it
but who knows and someone else is
licking your back
licking it in here
I think
okay now I didn't think nothing good
same
[Music]
and now they can't unless you pay her oh
[Music]
I mean
yeah so not against that idea
[Music]
I mean
I do accept bits for emotes
I mean that's kind of twitch work so
and there is a leaky
wow so cute
no no no no like him
100 euro and you can lick
can't give me a link
I'll do it
and he gives me love
[Music]
finally back I know what I mean
uh wait how do you go away gone for
oh yeah yeah you left
six
wait a minute I said that you were back
612
and you came back
speaking to element and you can make 16
to 32 so they turned the exterminant you
said was actually 40 extra minutes so it
was it was quite like
but it's still ending a few minutes but
anyway and then you went away again and
when you were back
he went went by 1640
and
[Music]
yeah that's like
half an hour later
1710
and I got another raid
that did not use the wrong command this
time
chain mean and raided who has
been
alerting and keeping an eye on me
and brought in 37 mirrors
and back from that and after that yeah
yeah I'm very bad at this community how
long it takes me to do this
estimated 1 hour 20 minutes it took one
hour 40 minutes I mean that's not bad
[Music]
my proportional speeding
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and then
paint
and finally this one she converted
[Music]
this one should be inverted
it took an hour 40 minutes longer than
it I said it would though
the previous time I showed up I hadn't
taken a shower like oh oh yeah you're
right
then you got one one hour and then 20
minutes for showering we came back one
hour and 40 minutes and you still hadn't
showered
now it's 40 minutes extra time then or
on your
well I guess I'll take back what is it
but she sneeze
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
there you go this looks interesting
but that's
and there was a naked Pom-Pom let's
look at that
[Music]
you never saw night
[Music]
and this would be or it doesn't no okay
it doesn't have a separate ones so
obtained
[Music]
belly button how lewd I mean her breast
was naked too yeah like
[Music]
I like I like the her you call it crotch
but like bare as well then I didn't so
easy it was a bit more than used
just a bare tummy
which if you redeem the sportswear
you'll get to see her bear tummy
[Music]
if you enjoy watching it
thank you that yes that is great
yeah someone redeemed a sports fan
make it pumpkin yeah
[Music]
but we make it
again you want to see the magic when I
apply this stuff
[Music]
let's go to Planet
so
I don't need to all right holder anymore
[Music]
again like this
which
to the proper material there we go
this is how it looks at the moment now
uh
definition timid at all let me
again
and then I just need to update this and
it will show up here but yeah the table
will start showing definition and
there we go
now it has this
these well I guess lines here
I should probably just uh not have this
strong and I thought that these sharp
lines here especially here
I'm going to make it a bit softer I
don't need it to be this strong
[Music]
it is very strong it doesn't want to be
a soft hint off
15
update yeah that's a bit softer
but do you like the butt should I add
imagination
to her but
[Music]
[Music]
yeah there you go
here's Pom-Pom with the tail
so I guess the next thing is to do the
[Music]
oh
all right apply me mirror
now
thank you
and I was already done don't need this
one anymore
and I got the bottle
yeah they find that but
it's not like her butt is going to show
when she's wearing an outfit
sorry I don't think I have the same with
with them said before dude I had like
some kind of definition type rest so you
can accuracy
that's because it's very flat at the
moment even though it is supposed to be
but but it's always going to be covered
by clothing anyway so
I don't think I need to put any
anything towards that
oh man I never thought I would see such
littleness
yeah there's nothing here
see so flat
the Army's being silly
I mean I did I was thinking about it but
to be fair
so anyway
here are the bows
I messed up
points here
all right
yeah I'm not sure how
to try to
yeah thank you
and then try to unravel everything
so I oops on this one then
[Music]
this whole thing if I see something for
beginning
[Music]
in a way of chasing away that's for sure
[Music]
and tightening
oh is it
[Music]
oh yeah I think
like the whole thing
[Music]
foreign
goes there
and not this one but this one goes
yeah
um
[Music]
now I'm getting moisten
and that's
[Music]
yeah it's one of them
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
the same point
but confusing myself lines
not sure how you're gonna fix this
little pack of spring as well yeah I'm
going to try to sort them up based on
where they are connected to
why does that not connect to nothing
work my way from there okay there's
another one of those
thank you
so
and then I guess I'll just
make it across like this
shows up here
oh
and then
[Music]
and then that yes try to solve this
first
[Music]
where's that yeah I'm confused about
that I guess it's
it's a split nothing more than that
and then
space
this lesson ignorement
foreign
[Music]
let me hint that one and
find those
[Music]
and then I just
organize this one and then
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
connected
[Music]
she's she's so amazing
[Music]
I don't know the Nerds
[Music]
and then I guess I'll just
collect
all
knees or something
so if I switch to share vertex I can see
like these colors
so for this shape I need the invert it
that way
[Music]
now
not sure it's the deal with that one
[Music]
shoot hopefully
let me double check
yep everything is connecting
that
that means that I can
merge things together
[Music]
like that
[Music]
and then this
I guess expense fairly
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
today
[Music]
and now a neck
oh wait what is this there's one of
these connect like yeah those are
supersonic
[Music]
and this is just a
real vertex
something
I guess it is it connects to that one
okay
so
I did I did fix it
[Music]
how about that
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and make made it
[Music]
proper
UV mappings
[Music]
so
[Music]
I will have to
wait
oh yeah I see more that's the case
though
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and so I will have to wear
make a quick bathroom break and I will
also
no mine
[Music]
drink my mommy
I wish I had like
[Music]
I cannot play that
thank you
that means pumpkin is away
in a few minutes
and see if anything
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and according to Twitch everyone's
staying here with you
um
happy to have you on here
[Music]
and put my headphones again
wear headphones
so I found a rather unsettling Snorlax
splashing chest
well I do have this good server where
you can share any picture if you would
like
I guess the meme channel will very very
close
LinkedIn
step back here
[Music]
okay maybe that's answering my question
might not be suitable for dessert the
server is technically 18 plus
so there's like
[Music]
Anything Goes
nah maybe
we should try to restrict yourself I
mean you're not gonna post anything
yeah
what why did you mention it then
um
[Music]
so
um
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
where's the bow
of me
and I said it is incorrect or to setting
again
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
guys
[Music]
okay
[Music]
this one take too long I gotta switch
over to
here
I'm trying to figure out where
beautiful thank you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
let me emphasis here myself
[Music]
his name
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
so this is the polar bear
Pearl appearance is normal for them I
mean it's probably easier if I overlay
with with
the regular texture
[Music]
there we go which I guess you could also
claim is a bit unsently and there you go
now let's see here it's supposed to be
[Music]
[Music]
give it a few moments Mark and the thing
is
generating a
narrow another map
which I need
where I am in
skin this up
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
Gates
[Music]
gonna
be interesting on the wrapped
originally on this part I'm interested
in
email
and how is I need to take that too
[Music]
foreign
exported the UV map or
or the polar bear
since I need two
[Music]
I'm using a different
View at the moment so it's not showing
up
the glitch
I'll save it in here
the same formula
exporting
oh spaghetti
and do you think I'm licking up
spaghetti
and I guess you're right
foreign
[Music]
names
like there's a bunny here
mostly scrolling
I don't even haven't commented on the
lack of a thinking right so
not like this at one point eating you
know secrets
thank you
[Music]
now say you want like
I'm eating
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I'm trying to find
I guess there's nothing
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I guess the classes is designed
hmm
oh yeah it wasn't that nice was it
and I'll do the shading instead they
didn't fade out in case I want to point
at something
sometimes
okay
then there's not exporting the
did you remember that means that
I can't import anything in my opinion
is
and there it is let's see yeah I'm
looking for
[Music]
yeah I'm trying to think of other bits
emotes I could make
and I guess one of them would be Pon
pon's paws
or a username
no it's not
written anything yet
you might still be here
is there a
eating big simple
well there's one specifically internet
but it is not departments it's anything
stinky passing the shiny connected
I guess I could have two the clean part
and then a bit more you get this stinky
bomb
foreign
ER fox tail and she is very shocked and
embarrassed about me
[Music]
it had generated the scene
now I can
all right let's see
that's right about 14 98 and 4925 wrong
because it's four days
It Go
[Music]
I mean
I've been singing
and and at some point my man can't make
that joke
clean is enough no stinky point but do
you said stinky poem
but I guess uh shy wouldn't be happy
with this thing before anyway because it
wouldn't have any beans
I have been missing meeting it's a slow
date worker now I'm the only one
in right now did you get like paid for
every missing person
imagine work like that
now you have a certain number of people
that should be eaten at the moment
and if a person doesn't show up
that person's pain it splits up among
everyone who are actually in that moment
foreign
if there is no like
if a person fails to shower and haven't
like reported them being sequencing like
that
and the rest of the people have to
compensate for a missing person I think
that would be a fair way of doing it to
be fair to like to be fair
the fair way to be fair yeah
[Music]
thank you again yeah you have to take
over that person's job but you get the
extra pain
and the more people who are missing the
more playing you get
hello
you surprised me
not this
isn't here to say it all right I think
you think
oh yeah hello everyone
we are
buns here
good tasty
pastries
all right that's not what they meant by
Emery plants peace
I want
a pastry bun
I wanna have a bit of time to hang out
but I hope everyone's having a good week
thank you for stopping bye
yeah despite me
not having much time I really appreciate
it pleased to be here
and that's mean a lot to me
that's another thing yeah wouldn't that
be nice
but
I can't
okay so foreign
[Music]
licking the Sugar Bowl
oh okay
both ways we've never changed our teeth
that
one upon expressing yourself with
different outfits
[Music]
so
now let's see if I can add the bone
so the bow would be added to the bottom
part here which would be the
outfit part of the
of the whole thing
but since I'm done with this
I should save this as body texture
like that
and what I will do now
foreign
the reason why I am the only one here is
because my supervisor had to stop
stepped out and I am the next one in
common at that point to work
oh if you're taking over your supervisor
do you get a bonus for this
I was talking about bonuses
but I think you should be rewarded for
your
good service after work your thing you
have an important
position you have shown that you are
well do you hear me getting work
and I want you to reward it for how good
a good you are at your work
and now I will call this one fixtures
out
which will be a separate
which
which has all the outfits merch or all
the Texas version one
yeah saving performance on the computer
now let's start with
default thing is
[Music]
[Music]
so oh it almost fits perfectly here
[Music]
but maybe I should place it over here
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yeah
wait
makes it so small
did I make this too large
the question is if it should be
launching
let's add cocoa
say it's much it looks a bit weird
[Music]
oh yeah I think I forgot
foreign
[Music]
thank you
it's kind of
the thing on it is kind of pink see if I
yeah this this looks to be about the
same resolution applications I think I
should dump anything size
[Music]
and then there's still lots of questions
how is it not correct size
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
this is weird
[Music]
I guess I will
[Music]
generate an even launcher
reference from Nancy
which I can use to make this Market I'm
not sure how it ends up like she's
[Music]
I saw so wrong
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you anyway
give me some
respect
[Music]
laughs
[Music]
[Music]
it's gonna have something yes
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
a permanently aim damage from more
towards myself
that might make it somewhere and also my
image
also
man
that will also help
though
[Music]
and
yeah I'll also notice when I listen back
to my own recording it's
I sometimes that trouble understand what
I'm even saying
and all I can imagine is everyone in the
chat is just
nodding alone yeah yeah that sounds good
we have no idea what you're saying
because you're family
[Music]
sounds better already thank you
I've come for things on my friends
it sounds
if you are cute sounds
so
anything interesting going on
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
yeah I want it to be more accurate than
this
I think thinking of generating this
um GB texture problem at the moment
generating electric or
by four times I guess would be
four squared Your solution of what it is
four times a week four times the highest
let's see what's going on width and
height
as much cold now
[Music]
the switchboard for height is paid
and and I can see I can see how that
works hi hey
[Music]
the last sound difference is basically
the difference in
cat and cartoon
and and then width is bread
this is kind of different
yeah anyway
hey I'm playing along to the past and
got turned into a pink rabbit oh yeah
that came
yeah I got a half off but have fun
things
thank you for staying bye here
I really appreciate this day taking your
time
in here it doesn't actually be a lot to
me
MP3 active and
sorry
I'm trying to be active
it's actually socialize
ah
without this Celine still here
[Music]
we go maybe I should just work
[Music]
immoral activity hydrate
sorry
double hide it
he is following that means 200 [ __ ] the
face
the elevation
party
I don't have on-screen party thing I
should have something
yay
[Music]
hunted for the ways
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
congratulations I'm so proud
now it's history on it
two let's go for 50 more yeah I think
Eileen for being the 300th follower
I mean minus those who have unfollowed
but
you've got the Crusty 2004 again whoa
[Music]
seven different times I mean now you
make it sound like it
has been so fun but it's time to get
there right now
it will continue
with more fun yeah
it has been fun it was scary when I
started
and and I realized
showing the wrong me when I've been
working
but that does that better
as I say I sometimes forget what I'm
doing
hey that's me
being in market phone
[Music]
so no
I can generate
[Music]
the actual UV for
they think
[Music]
the outfit so
give me a moment I loved it
Captain East
now it has something
so this is actually me
and this is the one in cockpit
but it's pretty good
it's only isn't perfect but it's very
good
but I will make it even more perfect
chests your way
[Music]
hysterical afternoon
[Music]
okay maybe this is kids
[Music]
how far yeah
so I probably don't need it to be this
strong
traveling enough
so yeah
so saying that
[Music]
oh yeah
uh stay safe yes
and then save the normal map
maybe that's when
done
go in here
update this
as updating giveness.com
but it's flat so if I update
details look at those details
it's got so much detailing
yes I know it's good
it is good
[Music]
What knees
also need
and here's what I placed them normally
no it does not work
still not doing
so again let's
switch over here and
see like oh hello face of quantum
knowing it
so it seems to be a bit too high
resolution
that's
there's some normal weapon you see
this is not that
first off
I think it should be more squished
together
baby
that's like small normal
and when it starts with together it
definitely if it's in here
I have good space for it right there
all right thanks
so what do you want
does it matter there
export
so I can't
I got the blue armor now wait armor
isn't this a tunic
I'm not that familiar with Zelda more
than you get lucky tunics or something
Chase Muse
here we go but this one should of course
be pink
so switching back
2D
drawing software
the next I should just call this bow
because you've got to be a few pictures
for the bow and the bow is going to show
up in multiple outfits
is referred to as the blue and
um
[Music]
alternative form but okay this is just a
three different spelling of male okay
not the same as male
m a i l
but in this case we're referring to it
as
this one from the Middle East
from the French word yes with the same
spelling as
um
are more consistent of metal rings or
plates linked together
and well then
if it's referred to that and I
security Now
what I'm curious about which I do like
to look at
is which regions of the world prefer
using the term
male and Main
it's not going to work because mail is
another thing
too many requests no that's not we're
sorry you sent too many requests to us
recently but this is my
I barely sent you any questions
about
[Music]
so
[Music]
foreign type
sorry I'm
being distracted that's
that's just who I am so I'm an easily
distracted by me
trying to look up this the French
spelling uh
using maid armor as the phrase
the only place that actually use the
French spelling is United States
but going into more details shows
nothing but yeah there was it was
interesting but then it yeah
yeah back to where I was before
so
[Music]
[Music]
there we go
[Music]
and there we go
we need the whole area
[Music]
of course
try to make sure a
hit no no left there I don't need this
other but
I don't know
wait which isn't which
let me just quickly check on blending
okay so bottom is here top is here
so
which should should the bottom or top
maybe the bottom should be the dark side
the dark side and the top should be the
right side
and historically chain main was prepared
who has made chainmail itself as a term
describing the armor is a modern
intervention
if you say so
yeah I have no idea so
so I think the lighter one because they
like this part here is on the UPS on the
top side of these the Nazi and the darks
is on the bottom of it therefore I'm
thinking the dark should be at the top
of the straps things and the light
should be at the bottom kind of making
it so
yeah the dark is like below the bow
below the bow
and
blow the Bell
if that makes sense
yeah it's
a rainbow
this was the light one which should come
on
[Music]
like that
dark
as you go on the top
and well I got to go a happy have a
wonderful day today I might apply for a
test at work soon oh
but I hope you have fun bye
Keith and I love you too and I really
hope
okay it goes well for you that's test
very curious what this test is
and I already talked about
some tests
[Music]
maybe a company secrets for
organizations
so I wish you the best of luck
and you have done so great so far so I
can only imagine it could be going great
my care workers today for last night
whenever you see it he went to the day
for me
we're asking if I practice any martial
arts I answered yes and I asked if I
could find
by take one two masters
I said Infamous the first fourth a
master of the sword there was this would
certainly a must with no Fists
do you
actually practice martial arts
I mean
yeah I just stopped appearance
if that's just
part of a joke
[Music]
[Music]
a bit sweet
or yesterday
that that I am calling you a joke
what can you spell that out today
it's EMA
the
heavy
erect metal
[Music]
erect metal is a different word for
sword cake and historical European
martial arts okay
right there
foreign
I hope
I hope because
[Music]
and I wish you the best of luck
[Music]
[Music]
babe there's my selection
so
thank you
man it's too bad
foreign
what do I want
that is a good question
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I should have asked to learn me for that
thing maybe I should ask it on stream
maybe that's a bit
not not properly
[Music]
relaxing sending private messages to
people
established bye
foreign
[Music]
that might be more
Suited
and then some texture too
[Music]
another the inside really should be
and then select one step out
write this down
[Music]
emergency
okay if I move
that's why I've expected it
foreign
yes this is
not the expected but
okay maybe I should hide
beans
and then maybe
it's when being what they were looking
for
and today I really need these on the
inside
[Music]
foreign
maybe I should keep them anyway
35
let's get
up
so
export this to an effective the work at
the moment
foreign
yep
thank you
see this new position
and it's below
do you simply
sorry so this is now at the moment
act as the Shaded area
so basically this
maybe even darker
I haven't had anything
a long time though everyone in our group
you stopped showing up
um
that's sad
no one to slice up
oh
my God
chest
slight Step Up
18 lines
a little
cubes
foreign
there we go
bite sights pieces yeah
to munch on
afternoon snake
luminance is not what I want
thank you
Connor yeah this is more like it
that's more like it
ah do you want ugly please
again I forgot to updated you
by the way refresh that game
yep
oh inside the head
but I really need to find a way to
I might
work on that Upstream
[Music]
okay where I make it so there's a whole
pink thing is just a single
corner
and then
and then I can just fill it with
whatever color
[Music]
[Music]
so
I guess
[Music]
even though I don't really need the
resolution
so maybe I should keep it small
[Music]
but The Shining Nails
so
I want to put it here but it doesn't
really
really feeling well
everybody's looking lovely so far
I'm happy I think so
this is a mess of
[Music]
[Music]
she doesn't even
line up properly
well this person's learning properly
more amazed
foreign
[Music]
I guess I'm just happy
[Music]
see what it is like that
snap too
closes for each individual points
independently of the rest
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
that
one feels so awesome race
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
one heart shaped pieces if possible
thank you
who is there one extra
but since does this make
what things does it make
and of course this one doesn't beat
the way you would
foreign
hey
[Music]
apparently I got
to do that
[Music]
uh
I want to get a keyboard
um
give me let's research
I want to get a keyboard which is
keyboard
tension
13 f24
I actually don't know what how I even
would phrase it
there
Point keyboard
foreign
now I'm still getting keyboards
yeah it must be because they are they
are like because wait
okay
because there are
um
I can't find it
because there are like
number pads extensions to keyboard
usually they were designed for to be
used alongside a laptop
well when they don't come with this left
of the seven over
pad which is quite convenient
but when I don't have it you can
actually get the number pad by USB which
is just a keyboard is a completely
normal keyboard itself it's just that it
only has another pad
Windows Racers as a perfect completely
normal keyboard that keyboard just can't
press anything else standing up hope
that makes sense and so
I want exactly that
but this keyboard should only have f13
through f24
and as some of you might know or might
not know
that f13 is through f24 or
actually have keys it's just that most
keyboards
with a few exceptions most keyboards
only contains F1 through F1 at the
[Music]
that's what I wanted to see
so f13 1224 are perfectly normal keys
which are
just registered as normal by
example some software might not
registering like recognize those keys
but also is badly design software
as far as I know OBS should recognize
those keys
so that should be fine but basically
what I'm trying to say is that therefore
I can have this
keyboard
which I can press on
it does one of those function keys it
will be as with register it and execute
the output chains
or other things for everybody
but
yeah I mean you
don't even have experience
F1
I probably never use f i don't want the
only thing the only time I press F1 is
by accident
[Music]
F2 is the red name g I use that one most
I think maybe maybe not
it's also the edit cell in the
spreadsheet
[Music]
because one new
when you normally edit a cell
in a spreadsheet
[Music]
and when you press left and right
you'll have Hong Kong
normally when you press
the left and right key
it will go to the left and right cell
is a computer at work and then we use
the function just well I mean that's a
work situation that's that's not like
normal everyday situation for everything
which simulation you might use F5 for
refreshing a web page f11 to put a web
page in full screen works on some
software as well
foreign
is the debugging page on web pages like
on web browsers and no it's mostly web
browsers you see deflection Keys when I
said F2 is common and it's like renaming
files
and also
one let the cell as I said when you
added a cell value in a spreadsheet and
press left and right it will go to the
left and right cell and stop editing the
cell you're working on at the moment by
pressing F12 you're going into kind of
the edit mode they fixed staying inside
the cell at the bottom something and
when you press left and right in that
case
and it will move the cursor within the
cell
quite a useful function if someone here
didn't know about that I'm happy to have
I've taught you something new
[Music]
[Music]
quite useful
F4
is in spreadsheets and when you're
writing a formula and refer to a cell
pressing F4 we switch the reference to
locking the column row or column and row
and then the fourth is going back today
now if yeah and then it goes back to
nothing and Loops right could be useful
and finally all the F4 is to close the
selected software which is always a
useful one
[Music]
which is
uh jokes that
something like oh you need help with
that well there's all the foreign
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
and put on yourself silly
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
you're so silly
[Music]
see
[Music]
I love it when you're silly okay
[Music]
um yes yeah I probably have to
straighten that stuff
and
Sam right
oh yeah
and to do that
let me create some
[Music]
[Music]
Marcus
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
all right it's like sofa
protection
[Music]
sorry I should have shown you
there we go thank you
I like it
yeah
I'm
[Music]
I think I need one one science
foreign
[Music]
somewhat straight
not perfectly straight
[Music]
yeah I think that's enough really
[Music]
[Music]
so let's see what I was planning on
doing
[Music]
that means our important cubic map was
smart
[Music]
there we go
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and then
[Music]
[Music]
is this in your middle name
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
perfect
I think
well I'll test to export this and then
I'll see how it looks
[Music]
boom
that's that's a pink bow
what a slight gradient
should gradient be another way I don't
know
I think it works
that's not Canadian so it is like
this
to my shepherd
maybe not
or maybe
okay I'll I'll
do
what do we have here
all right sir
there's something else who have you
subscribed
there was a little one
and also hydrate I showed Magic
was funny
he lifts it up for the police it
let's make sure it's good to eat
one pumpkin firm it is good to eat
himself
foreign
that way anyway
well played
Mariah
messing around with me
regular monkey nuts
because then I have
no maybe that's why I was gonna say
considering how stingy
Nintendo is with their characters but I
realized Pokemon is only curl on my
Nintendo
as far as I said no but it starts in
therefore technically I'm pregnant
uh
they are as far as my research has gone
out by
[Music]
uh
they are owned at the Pokemon Island by
three companies Nintendo
creatures and the Pokemon company
[Music]
so now I didn't even know what Canadians
going on here
so
complete and our sprite from something
small I think that's fine I think that
is better
[Music]
so what I'm thinking
[Music]
all right promise
with purpose
I think these are Bells but that they
are they're holding dots over them so I
can't take these
[Music]
okay
shame
[Music]
but I should be still being able to
create a swarm of
normal map
with these stuff
for creating a height map
so the balls will be on the full height
by default
[Music]
and then
they do this
[Music]
thing
[Music]
[Music]
make them really blurry
[Music]
um
all right
anyway I'll test this as a height map
[Music]
and I will not say it as a small size
and speed up then I go to
balance it in smart
white noise
[Music]
smart door map something
smart page
[Music]
not showing this on screen it just too
much effort to me
the website is just a smart hyphen
page.net
slash smart normal slash
that's the page
if using if you generating normal maps
from height Maps
eight Maps that's something else
and there we go
and I don't and because I'm not using
any patterns I don't need to
convert things
like how I did for the body there
where I
[Music]
use them up in Shadows made
other T and subtractive stuff and
so on later
that was because it was supposed to
add this only to the third pattern
that's the body hand this one
and I could add
like a fiction or like yeah
textile effect
maybe not so we can
[Music]
anyway
I guess I'll test this out
did I invert
the no I did not sign anything or that
but the inversion of the green
there we go
now
I could see that inverting the green
because when I inverted the green it
looks like it was indented but now now
before I invert in the green and when I
forgot the entertainment it looked like
it was indented but now that I have
inverted the green now it looks like
it's coming out and that's because in uh
as I've been told in in like the default
on unless there's a sun defining where
this light comes from we kind of see it
coming from the top maybe from the left
and so having the
so in in having the green inverted with
because the line the bright like this
means that it's going in and dark like
this means going up out so this is uh
uh uh
indentation okay I was looking for this
word
ah
a valley there we go a valley
but if we were to invert
both the red and the green
now it looks like it's indented this is
like this is for like human Edition and
this is what it could be
so it's easier to tell like a human but
oh well whatever
foreign
[Music]
let's see how this affects the bow
about anything
boom
well not much
I mean did I did one line there should
be two but it is like a
I don't know it was worth an attempt it
doesn't look that great
mhm
yes yes more stuff that goes over ahead
yeah it didn't look that great it was
always an attempt I'll probably find
another way of doing that
yeah this is my bow
[Music]
so
[Music]
it has as a right
and let's take it
oh yeah yeah this is
first off there is on this station
which is the FC
we should also have this stuff but
I need to look out it looks on Cocoa
first
kale kale
YouTube
okay let's see
this is the purpose
steam texture which is just colored
Seafood color
and then
I guess it's there's a base color this
is the FC it's kind of like removing the
light like the shading of the whole
thing
[Music]
so as you can see right
there it is
[Music]
too like the clothes here is very flat
yes I'll just do that and
all this to just be a neutral flat color
together
essentially with something
it was
it was his room
it was just wrong there you go
and then this FW
we can't don't exactly know what it is
but we can go back to Coco and then we
can see
if I love the FW
what you can see here what the name is
we can see that this is what Copper's
body it has this dark color but when I
look at the clothes here it has a
slightly lighter color
so I guess I'll use that for
but you can also see that on the shoe
a slightly different color for the text
and architect style leather rubber
but yeah
whatever
I'll use the textile it has a slightly
different shade I guess it does
something
[Music]
and then we have the metal but the bow
has no metal in it the normal which I've
only done
and finally
I guess it's taking notified that is one
more
but the t is always white and it's only
basically ignore it
the roughness and
what freshness does
declares her
when left
they are slightly more rough than the
body and at the same time
they are meant to
be a
I guess but I could see the birds being
more like a not like
more like a shiny not like fully silk
but
but let's kill it
this
is slightly
less rough than the body
that's what I should say
and that's about it I guess
so so if I go back to blending
and update
let's see that
after I remove the
things that it needs
probably do this
and then I got here and update
yeah this is such a slight difference it
doesn't doesn't appear maybe it's maybe
there will be a different indicator
it's like dark
Yellow Ninja
foreign
[Music]
so
well
[Music]
there we go
[Music]
double headband
hey
and then
[Music]
he's twice twice the head pattern
[Music]
[Music]
s
how about
[Music]
since
all right now all right
since I've been sleeping in six hours
now I think in six hours I mean the
stream doesn't tell it because I
restarted stream because I made a
mistake but but I started 14 as far as I
know and went demands 14 is six
as far as I know I was doing in six
hours
[Music]
at this time the mic microphone wouldn't
be working in this other screen and the
previous stream I
had its mutant
and it's the settings of the microphone
is per screen
so the countdown screen for example I
have the microphed so if you can't hear
me it's counting down when I'm preparing
stuff
some random any random facts
[Music]
on the better episode
[Music]
some random things but what might be of
interest is that this girl Lynch because
I didn't have a disco server there's not
much activity there but if you kind of
want to get contact with me off the
streams and yeah
so you don't have to worry about getting
bombarded with messages I mean sometimes
it might be a small conversation but
it's a very calm service
celebration
now I would like to
rain somewhere I haven't drained it
alone
like I want to read Barney believe she
is a bunny stream assistant which is a
human stream she has a bunny theme but
she is playing
I'll tears of the Kingdom
though as far as I did some people are
avoiding Spanish at the moment so that
might not be
rope yet
but
[Music]
we could go visit Papa wolf
instead
who is playing quick too
and now I'm actually going to use the
rape comment properly
yeah I was ready before and then like
all right if you didn't shout out slash
raid oh no that was the wrong command
and I couldn't even see the countdown
showing me that RX literally started
reading and
[Music]
yeah
and no one told me
I mean it's not your fault but I am but
at the same time no one told me like
yeah that rage it says
hey but it's all my fault of course
so
has been sharing a convention sometimes
so I think it's quite appropriate to go
and visit him streaming
I think I may select I guess share my
mom is my classic but any image of mine
is great news
they can be this one
[Music]
or this one
I don't know it is
[Music]
of my choice
[Music]
and the right time
[Music]
it's already
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
