hello haveit some
feed
nothing nothing wa from oh oh what's
going here licking a tongue it's tongue
licking time
G so this was the last level I played it
took 1 hour 50 minutes and 25 seconds
that is almost 2 hours from this level
moving not the correct Direction moving
up to both rays and this is an
interesting level wait oh yeah yeah I
can see the I can see the ground water
here isn't down in flames so you can see
kind of
[Music]
how okay let me show with my trusted
pointer you start up here and then and
then you have multiple Islands this
island you can only pass through here or
the bridge so even if you destroy Bridge
can pass through here but every other
Island but all other Islands you can
only pass through
here and then you have uh so if you
destroy this bridge it's game
over and then you have the bridge here
but you can also go around
here and this island you can only go
here another bridge that you can't
destroy cuz this game over and then you
have this side and you can go through
here and these three islands are
accessed by this points and there might
be a way to get over here I think you
can go over here between here but there
are some bridges that are you must
keep but then when you view the map in
game you don't see shallow
water it IES say ground water
again because this wisht word for ground
for shallow is
GRE
that was too s a Friday
stream yeah I know ohed drag with all
the bouncy bouncers I need a bouncy P
Pon
P the real
bun what the bunny give
me a princess to Le
them yeah put red put it put the feral
Pon first in front of
every bouncy
emote I do know you have to give
me
uh you have to give me 4,900 bits first
and yeah you have it if you give me
4,900
bits oh wait or is it no no no no you
only have be minut 900 bits now I
remember 900 bits and it's
yours one yeah yeah I I remember it's
princess that you need
4,900 900 give me
900 clearly you need
it
anyway so as you can see on this map we
have a lot of separate Islands you can't
access with the tanks
sport by sounds cute so this is going to
be interesting and what I mean sorry for
this long introduction you have plenty
of islands here but this is like the
main island this island this
island you can't access them with your
with a tank you can only access these
with Jeep it's apparently called a
hum which is call a Jeep in every other
language um so these three I need to
focus on first so let's go I started in
the middle somewhere there but there's
another Island and stuff
on climb under the
P so I atee four for tattoos for dinner
today they were supposed to be part of
dinner on Tuesday and Wednesday but
someone hit them and I found them too
late and I had to had to eat them before
they began
sprouting oh I only get one of each
pleas H okay I remember what where were
they
hiding H Hami and jeeps are different
whatever that on Hami is that is a type
of vehicle used in the US Army so it
makes sense that in
the in the nonu versions of the
languages they don't call it a hve they
call it a Jeep because
because every other language is not well
United States as far as I
know uh do I have say yes you
have zombies are specifically military I
just offer Vehicles
yeah but this isn't a this isn't um um
view of it I guess this isn't a military
vehicle all it got is some hand grenades
and it can pick up the flight that's all
it can
do that makes no
sense they were in a canister label
p and I couldn't find
them even though it's right on the
tin anyway I had to be really careful
this time I love the
potatoes potatoes H is very specific
vehicle it's not type of vehicle as far
as I know yeah I mean it makes sense for
like the US English version of the game
to call it h which is what why the US
English version of the game is calling
it h and but every other the language I
call it a
je and there is only us English when it
comes to English there is a British flag
but it's still us English as we already
has established before
it's the added British flag and and this
just us
English yeah that's how this game does
does
it
okay I'm trying
to so many Towers every
mind I'm going to clear off some some of
these
towers and then I'll see if I can fly
back
home got to
short to
firment okay can I find my way back
[Music]
home no no don't Sho down I'm I'm a
peaceful
helicopter I only shoot down evil Towers
wait where's home home is up
here okay this is going to be an
annoying
level
I got buildings this time
okay they're best when distilled and
drunk drank
drunk so now that I cleared up this
area I should see if I can break open
the flag
thing I really like the air AF in now
just a Target on the wings literally at
that today was saying aim right
here
realus to do
that oh no sorry
sorry no no
no almost died from
that can remove these mines other way no
my bridge otherwise something Terri is
going to
happen Okay that was
scary go go go
go that that was scar
let's move this window a bit to the
side but I did deal quite some damage
there
so you can see the damage Bridge p on
the map as well on the radar cuz this
radar can apparently Bridge
pieces no sorry no I probably have
to you know
what you know
what how about I do this
[Music]
first I will take this one and then I
will clear up that area first so my my
helicopter doesn't struggle with
them luckily it's a bridge piece is not
broken where there's deep
water
[Music]
go you will not cause me any more
trouble cuz you're
gone
okay now you cing me
oh there we go remove these
nice and now we remove you
two
potis that's a swiish word or you can
get put is is a Swedish word for
[Music]
something can I go back and repair this
thing but now it should be safer for the
helicopter
so it doesn't sh get shot down as it's
trying to reach the
flag yeah that's much
better I could probably clear up more of
the island but I don't know if I
should let's check out the first
have flag
building oh look it's
destroyed it's safe to pass through
here so when it comes to this island it
is protected so I need to remove some of
the
towers no it sees
me no no this isn't good this isn't good
okay I'm completely messed
up
so I might need to
restart but I really can't wait for my S
and G AR those are going to look amazing
when War
together it's even better because they
were undefeated in a combat so it was
just a t F yeah I know that was a big F
for me I completely messed that up
that's not how you're supposed to do
it h I'm so bad with helicopters
[Music]
apparently see I'm
terrible how am I supposed to approach
this yeah already super
damaged when I remove oh no it sees
[Music]
me kind of
yeah I miss
it yeah I need to find
uh don't know how I'm supposed
to
how I supposed that because towers are
so hard to attack with a helicopter like
I the 3 one of them in South but but
like four of them in line like that I'm
not really sure how I should get
them yep or a challenge that the British
were more than
cap backing up towers are so
hard yes towers are very hard
they are made of
Bon actually don't know what they're
made of
rocks they are so hard for little wi
me oh no yeah this is going
terribly
oh no I'm giving
up likely still reinforced
concrete yes
Bon if your Tower is hard for more than
4 hours call a
doctor
wait was it okay let's do this
first okay so the mines are definitely
randomized cuz now I three
Min there we go
finally okay let's let's do this
properly
no it's shoting
me don't worry my tower is not hard for
that
[Music]
long awkward
silence
all right sh you three
times
what what's with a shocked face
R who want with the lecking of pon
pon if we have a pon pon meet up is that
going to be an activity come and lick
pon pon well you can't hear us anyway
we're just dis EMB boded rows of
text but I associate you with
people even if you just random text
without username assigned to
them
on
to
yep well I didn't mean okay okay y so
there is no misunderstanding
here when I said I when I said licking
pon pon I did not mean they they knock
me in the tower
okay
just to be clear about
that shooting trees because I want to
not because I have to I'm not people
just that wor wait since I want a
worm
okay yeah you never know it's good thing
to make it's good to make things clear
so there's no misunderstanding you
know
[Music]
I didn't have to but I wanted
to okay there you go more can be people
there you go that was pretty nice and
clear out I
think Y and musk that's not how you
write it that says I am a
worm yeah missing a word in
there sure I mean it doesn't make much
sense to have the word but I guess
that's that's what your mannequin
romance language is all like this adding
unnecessary
words serves no
[Music]
purpose my come
on why me oh
no that thing text me his
[Music]
game
there we go cleared up that
area now let's go home and
[Music]
Repair actually of this mines in here I
think no there in
[Music]
here come on shoot the
mine I don't want to take a Jeep and
then run into
mine that would be very
annoying
lay on top P Pon ears that sounds like a
nice and Cy place to lie on top of okay
I need a way to approach that island and
attack it without
dying young and musk I don't know
sometimes it's
St yeah you don't add it to like uh RS
and such if you have
like if if if it's like an
occupation you don't
need you don't need to add it you can
still add it but you don't need to add
[Music]
it sorry sorry sorry yeah I flew too far
okay so I got rid of one really should
add practice my
aim here we go there aiming
[Music]
practice
[Music]
nice
lay on Arian
head
yayay lay back on back and forth back
and forth cannot find a good resting
position um pon pon ear sandwich pon pon
Panda ear sandwich P
Panda
Ponda
Honda is when someone tried to say Honda
but completely forgot what the name
was okay I need I need somewh to ref
this like they're shooting at me how are
supposed attack
them can attack this
one
oh I had my chance there they were
distracted by
something keep missing
them no no release me okay I got I got
you the one Tower
[Music]
wow such
amazement
[Music]
could probably take a bit more of a
short Captain trying to B the
[Music]
roads honai makes sing
machine
hondai so I got to one Tower and is
sumon Towers 10 towers that
Island P may I suggest an um man
approach I mean sure I'm open for
this go ahead
private take your
suggestion and I will take it into
consideration you might be able to do
bombing runs on a building yeah yeah
yeah yeah I know I know I've done that
in the past but just ends up with me
D so while I am aware of that it's not a
easy thing to
[Music]
do
okay move out move out I got I got rid
of plenty of ter
[Music]
there and you might I mean sure it might
be you might be intended to just fly by
and shoot the tower I'm just not good at
it but I mean I'm not good at shooting
the power sers I mean
what's and if the flag is there I do
have to sh down the towers regardless so
I don't
know I mean you're not wrong it is a Val
idea but there's only six towers left on
the island and keep pressing the wrong
buttons because if the building is empty
shoot in the building is a waste of time
yeah should wasting time yes that is
true so because I've lowered the amount
of towers maybe I should just try to
shoot the building
them wait there are mines here I can
shoot the
mines there we go okay the building is
empty the next building is here cuz if I
try to yeah if that happens
yes I missed the
building and no point of going back
didn't I shoot it
[Music]
twice I just have to go back to base and
try that
[Music]
again yeah
[Music]
good luck this helicopter will be more
useful at Mo
boms yeah like yeah like dropping bombs
or
something dropping a mine and let it
explode on
impact
yep not going be be confused with
Jeep
H dropping
Freedom now we need to increase the
freedom hello water bunny again no no no
Li Li
Li
me
it was this was kind of
crap
crap
no that was completely terrible let me
go in there way
T they are shooting me that's not fair
let's move in with a tank
swim suit this is like appropriate and
un like an appropriate outfit for
war get out of my way trying to take a
shortcut peaceful tank
yes I'm just going to move in and clear
out the
area oh look a hole in the water
M
stream there
[Music]
go you destroy one of my
helicopters I did not expect ships
there wa
tree yeah let's get rid of everything
here is there anything out here no it
just
ends am resisting making a joke you're
free to make jokes we here to have
fun we here to make
jokes even terrible
ones I mean as long as notan telling
jokes it's
fine maybe I should put the joke within
quotation marks as
well well at least you found it funny I
guess
let's destroy everything
here oh no I'm
out okay now it should be more easy for
the helicopter get
[Music]
through
pon pon changing into her swimsuit and
then she gets into the
tank and the tank gets back the ammo as
soon as you move down instead of waiting
until you're down in the
base that's how this game
wor okay
now let's see if I can do another
successful bummer G already lost one
tank
than helicopter I'm not lost a tank
yet
yet let's let's fly through
here okay I mean that wasn't terrible we
got D fly in again no we don't well well
not exactly exactly I
I
[Music]
I am leaving wait there's a mine
here there we go no I'm
leaving I am
leaving I got one shot on the building
so now I just need another shot I just
need to repair the
helicopter
so and I got like a few shots on the
towers too bad
but I need to be careful I only got so
many
helicopters
okay oh
no come on shoot it now missed
it at least I got rid of one
power but I
can
no
nope
what
yeah
Bo that that did not go as planned I
missed to you see I'm not that good at
Amy maybe I should
just
maybe I should just use the one I don't
need to aim it that might be better
instead of doing like five runs and
hitting hit one with them and I only
need to hit it
twice I can use the other munition
which I won't be able to destroy it with
one run but at least I will hit it every
time to maybe that that's how I should
do
it
oh no
no
no complete failure okay this
is what was
that I didn't even get to try because
they were really aggressive all of a
sudden go go
go I
dedan I
died why were they so aggressive all of
a
sudden there we
go there we go that's what I
wanted
[Music]
man stop shooting me trying to
[Music]
leave
[Music]
okay oh start to
P I know this is encouragement I mind
not to give up I'm not I you suggest I'm
giving up no okay and then there's that
like the northern building
there and what's the star do again
nothing it doesn't do
anything I just added his because it was
fun but it doesn't do anything so you
don't need to redeem
it here we go got some hits in on
[Music]
that no
shooting
[Music]
[Music]
back to
main oh ch star the Bas token you redeem
once per stream and it does not do
anything I wish I grab one and GI p p i
mean I can redeem my own
star what's that a worm a
snake
okay let's see if I can access this
thing
again there we go and it was
empty okay let's see where should I go
next
[Music]
it is a snake that is wiggling with
happiness so yeah let's
go
northeast the the flag place that is far
furthest away
everything else is now accessible with
tank so don't have to worry about losing
the helicopter but obviously I don't
want to lose the
helicopter I'm losing helicopter
regardless I
win I have a
snake you have a snake
somewhere I have a snake in my
boot
anyway let's attack well at Le is
not who knows maybe there is a
snake in
there the secret Tower
there we
go
attack
attack don't like it when they are in a
corner like
that looks like someone else to car it
for
me okay
now some bombing going
on now I stuck
with all speed
s W I need to push this
thing what's the snake doing in there
well I don't know it there I
guess just order some gauntlets to go
with my
emble
ooh so about that's to tent that you are
covering your red P paint buckets with
sorry about ruining your red paint
how much health do I have I don't even
know
oops I'm out of ammo
anyway out of
ammo time to move
home
all that paint
wasted
yep oops more paint
spelled don't cry I spelled
paint
get on
everything okay let's Swit the room
then that's
quick
this music is so
quiet so
quiet
so don't want it to be in the last
place and since the flag apparently
appears in like the last building you
destroy unless if it's like 50 of them
but like at least at most I meant 10
it's like the last building you
destroy I do want
to
rather destroy the other two before I
destroy this one up
here
turn
yeah let's fill this up
again
great
out the area so you can move
quickly and then then move up
north stop shooting
me
okay I'll move
out on why is it destroy getting
destroyed how much health do you
have there not
there
okay I'm probably dying soon
anyway maybe I should heal
up shooting at
Pawn yeah don't shoot at
Pawn that's a bit
rude War pie they annoy
me taking down dream with rockets that's
how you do
it poter girl
welcome you with
permission H I guess you can shoot me
with permission but getting that
permission will be very
hard I said hard
again hi hi hello I'm playing as a tank
again happy time soon y all
hello
what is in the afternoon here I do have
the clock on stream so you can always
confirm so I got two places
left yeah that's that one is going to be
a bit
tricky a peaceful tank
exactly hi
PP Who you calling me
PE is this a reference to
something
PP the
BB yeah I mean
I
L yeah I think we talked about that
before PP how rude how is it rude
calling me
PP can you can you explain
that
shoot it
down I like shooting down trees music is
so
quiet he sneaky around with the tank
with this quiet
music
well let's fill up with more
ammunition sorry about these T that are
covering tarps that are covering red
paint
it's an unnecessary thing I have to do I
know I'm quite evil for ruining a red
paint which you don't need because
you're the green
team but
still it's
quiet too oh no it's not quiet now we
have this in
here
can I shoot it please can you stop
shooting me I'm trying to shoot down
another thing
here okay
okay finally okay now I definitely need
to go back to
base that
thinking so I do need to fill up my
tank can I do this here
no oh it hit me could just hit the tank
in
then it came so it broke and it broke me
in my
heart now we got some dramatic music
now
and now pon pon is going to show those
Towers
what what did serve P got
pounded P pounded
the Bon
bounded all this open
domain do you like the open domain good
this I mean it's assuming the
performance is open the
main the credit does state which
orchestrate is and
stuff CU I remember just because the
source material is open public
domain shut in one thing doesn't mean
that every performance of the public
domain things makes the
me like I don't
know you take Mona that's that the
famous painting that's public domain
right but uh yeah that doesn't mean that
every parity of one of
is public
domain there we
go good thing the the this thing isn't
there that would be quite
annoying them out of
mines
D must have been been something to my
shoulder last night and didn't not
because it just started hurting now oh
no true I would assume these were open
the main
Arrangements don't
assume
okay wait this is the wrong
[Music]
place this is the
place now I just need to find an
approach
look F tank almost shot
it
okay where will it come from it comes
from
Southwest
okay
now going destroy this thing look a
flag hey where did you come
from
now I just need to make sure the
passform is
safe it seems
safe oh out of ammo
munition
ammunition so ammo is your ammunition
and this munition this this means that
this is Mo out of
Mo copyright is weird no not
really then you go to international law
and it's mess I me it's not weird me the
cor it makes sense if you make something
the worse until the copyright run
out d s came s s s ble
up yeah yeah go
go
deep I want to call this thing I Jeep
so
thing I got
it we taking a bit of a the scenic way
home
[Music]
apparently can't go over
[Music]
here this is yeah this is the base there
a red building I mean Brown
building I just had to go East not East
South
Southeast there we go there is
home I could have taken a much shorter
way
I like how you hear the tires
inl there go
more public domain footage
presumably I do kind of wonder why the
game doesn't have
ifvs wait what's an
[Music]
ifv internet floating vehicle
the you got password is a
bunny smile bear
bird took 41
minutes V is for the
victim remember
that holy crab look all these stock PES
from infantry fight vehicle I guess it's
kind
of because there's no infantry to
fight okay let's do some did you call it
carpet
bombing bun smile Teddy
bird fun smile Ted Bird
Go got a whole base there with towers
and
everything
I'm going to reach something at some
point here we go I reached something at
some
point
no I can't do that again oh no I'm I'm
trapped get me out of
[Music]
here
[Music]
now let's see if I can find the base
again yes there it is look at this
beautiful base I got towers and
everything and
mines I don't like
mines
wh oh well it happens
[Music]
women
Su I me I generally
can likely armored vehicles with turist
of the capacity to
carry likely armored vehicles with
turrets and often capacity to carry
infantry yes makes
sense get me out of
here well I guess I'm just going to do
some rounds of bombing like that or
something and after the third house is
an auto
cannon with auto
aim they destroy my beautiful bra and
bvr examples don't know about
[Music]
this
go one building
destroyed no no no no
no no destroy it no I missed
it
no
one one one building
destroyed is I should try destroy them
on all the side first oh well I still
have to climb up the other side brism
ifv and BB Soviet
ifv does make me wonder if it's a BMB or
a
VMV
just like how how it it is not
dccp it's
[Music]
sssr
well that didn't give us plan I still
have one Tower left in there BMP sorry
well in that case the the question
remains is it BMP or is it
VMR I have no idea what that is about H
it's called The sck Script if you write
VMR in sck script it will look like it
says BMP in slat
script that's what it's
about
I believe also translate oh so it's like
the Acron of like the English
translation of the Russian name and
Russian is a complet different
name where am I
going three
already okay currently I I'm not really
sure where I'm going so
something I will just return
back and then I will check the
map to see where I'm supposed to
go I kind of went into that a b
blind it's not really any plan that's my
usual approach oh has been attacking my
base B more
for okay so so I'm approaching the right
place I just should go up continue up
north V for
victim
yeah I don't like that
M but what can I do I shoot this thing
down no not that thing this
thing
go when I'm here I
canist a bit
more
than temp continue
appearing destroying
you d thr you across the
water oh no to many
Towers thank
you wait to minut
Towers I need you to move out of the way
no don't show hanger inside
me oh you're Straight Ahead like that
okay
oh no they destroyed my
protection my protection
broke oh no not
you no one likes
you not another
one
go
away
go it has gone
away go ni trees makes it easy to move
around FAL bonon FAL pon
pon delicate pon
pon pon pon the bon
bon I do want to reanimate pon pon in
this spal mode so she actually skips
around like a
bunny so made some progress up there but
then I got kind of crushed seems like
there should be more location for
Flags head
pets because someone said it was weird
seeing pon pon on four legs like no no
no they said that was we to see a bunny
with four
legs there
we the pon pon on for I can understand
it being weird but bunny on four legs I
understand it mean meant more like
walking like a dog or something and I
can understand that but a bunny on four
legs I'm pretty sure most of them are on
four legs but bunes have four legs
exactly but is more like the way SP
works and then applying that to a bunny
I can understand that looking a bit
weird but that's not why it was
expressed cing up
some
trash
garbage garbage
everywhere
nothing oh something oh yeah here we go
to
shoot
me only my tower is allowed to
shoot okay this tank is getting a bit D
strong
now
oh
hello okay let me just get through
here oh no don't see not one
that didn't go
planed let me
see oh while driving home from work
my
that I saw a deer eating grass beside
the
road I pet there before they seem
like they seem to like Che on my dust
account but I watch out for that of
course they were in a petting
suit not wild there don't pet wild there
bad
yeah bad
idea okay I think I did I think I made
good progress there look at that that's
some good
progress that's a quite a
got
there me making beautiful jumps here
progress more like POG
what Pap wolf is come with great
jokes just hear about just hear how
amused I am
not close enough not close enough not
close
enough didn't really was mind on had to
worry about them ever
again destroy those
two well I mean I'm very very very close
okay suain a lot of damage so let's go
home should
I at least like
destroy Towers up here or
something
yeah while I'm out
here and going to return home
anyway
there we go now I don't have to worry
about those
anymore lone piece of w let
destroy this game kind of reminds of GTA
to I guess like to
the top down
[Music]
viu partly 3D objects part to the ob
everything is completely
flat should have played through all the
GTA
games okay so I cleared mine that was
kind of the goal of that run and then I
cleared out some more Towers
but that wasn't the goal of that one now
I can move through safely here without
being worried about
Min pon pon all is going around with a
bag of change of clothes so she can at
any point just change her clothes while
driving a
vehicle no in case someone
does
that's just how f
is so we go doing some
progress I might be able to cut across
the the deep
water okay here's this
area means that there are Towers up
here
yep as
expected
no
[Music]
go shot down that
Tower and this
Tower okay oh no don't sh shoot don't
thr hang at
me I'm creating peace
do anything up
here thank you tower for helping my
course oh no out of munition don't shoot
me I don't have anything to shoot with
myself not fair to shoot

pr oh no so many
Towers
Pap
dragon
yeah just it's peacefully destroying the
towers a
distance stop shooting
me can I shoot this
there we
go
no the the heavy armored vehicle has
been destroyed
look at that though I do have plenty
more to go
through hopefully I don't find the flag
up
there cuz the r seems to say it needs to
be You Must Destroy like 20 20 buildings
before it will randomize the position of
black
I got 253 followers I got plenty of
followers thank you everyone who's
following I've never had this many
followers on any platform
before it feels unre not many people I
don't like compar some people who have
like million
followers like YouTube or
something it might not be much I mean
it's not for me but it's but they these
people are important people so it means
a
lot oh
no we're already going to fight
no my fuel
tank oh don't shoot
me see now I Shu
you there we
go
oh it's destroyed here
already destroy this
place this
me just sneaking through
here shooting more than one one taking
so much damage in okay leave
Le let's destroy these
towers this is a bit safer to go
through
okay I need a way to get through there
let's clear up some
buildings too much stuff
everywhere look at watch out people
you're walking over the
mine these mines are larger than p
meeting new people is nice it is I met
you papa wolf and you are
nice I
hope think I posting a preview of my
Halloween costume to the server yeah
feel free and specific sh put it in
while your content I
guess it's quite uh not not used Channel
much so I guess you can post it
there basically anything you create you
can just post day to show
off and I I
assume the outfits would fall under
there because you can of even even if
you every every part is purchased the
whole outfit itself itself is have you
yet put together I I think that's fair
unless of course you know there's a
conversation about Halloween
costumes you know yeah it's there an
idea I'm I'm free for I'm up for
uestion and for
October oh wait wait wait what was the
question dogs were
borking was that a question
and for October it might be fun to have
a Halloween costume CH I mean in that
case you could could rather have like a
um a topic for Halloween custom
inste I just wish you could make topics
like visible for everyone instead of
having you to that's why I have the
outfit alerts thing
topics that kind of show up like this is
an active Topic at the moment you free
to like instead of instead of just
creating whole Channel you
know but but it kind shows up as if it
we a new channel and then you can just
find it for yourself something something
now you can create thre on in this yeah
yeah yeah yes threads is what it was
called yeah um yeah I'm aware that but
you kind of have to manually join the
thread for it to show off for you unless
you're
pinged and I like don't want to Ping
everyone you
know but I also don't want people to
miss that there's a Str go out but sure
it shows up in in general it shows up in
the channel you created in like a thread
has been
created but if you don't see that
message you can miss out the whole the
whole conversation them and I don't want
people to be
S but yeah I also don't want to
everyone and then there should be an
option for uh come on where where do you
come
from and for those who are moderators on
the server that they can create a topic
that everyone
is shows up for everyone because you can
just leave it not
interested so I think it's
a get get out of way non non abusive way
of doing it feel like come on
again just shut down one of you okay
let's let's leave this
place you know maybe I should just ping
everyone I don't like doing that but
if actually this one
idea there's one
idea uh I can I can make a a
roll
maybe there's a way maybe one of the
current Bots can do that a roll that's B
that is like the outfit alert
Ro that you you get pinged when there's
a new
threat but everyone has this role and
then you can just remove the RO if you
don't nor want
it
there there's an opt out feature thater
is not
fure with the amount of P I would get
another one isn't that
bad oh I
mean yeah every time end joining a new
server I always like disable the
everyone in here
pleas
oops running off the fuel you might need
a car made this noise when you were
running out of
here I don't know this going to be
right did it yeah because as as know if
you run out of fuel while you're in your
base you're still going to lose it
because that makes perf Mak
sense video game
logic an abandoned vehicle should just
be abandoned and then you should be able
to go and pick it up
again
yay
celebration I think I was thinking
about uh on another topic the pon pon
mod which is going to be a massive mod
is it going to be the
first I don't know if it's the first mod
that contains
[Music]
multiple the
the is there any other character
replacement mod because there are some
that replaces the the crash or coco
without different character but is there
any of those mods that have multiple
outfits or will this be the first one
that have that
I do know there are outfits like new
outfits for coco or crash which is still
supposed to be Coco and crash which that
are replacing different outfit
slots but yeah that's a different thing
not what I'm referring to
though
these towers I've left behind are just
staring at me look at what you've done
you destroyed our beautiful
base I
know and iend on continue
that I destroyed the one more than the
tower oh no I'm getting attacked
the
whole yeah the whole chat update because
you really C that I wasn't part of
asking it's a silly sometimes when I
have to refresh
everything maybe I should have a b
right what such character for seen this
I
know he so I got I'm going to destroy
you because you probably going destroy
me so there two more places that it has
the
flag so there's these two
places
I'm running after
Fuel and munition oh
no yeah what's your
problem go they come from
everywhere and I'm out of I didn't even
realize I'm out of okay this is going to
be
tricky
okay yeah have them running team
setting don't even know where I can find
munition oops got stuck at a tree oh
well oh well I guess I
I still have like
one another one of these
so
and plot with one of those builds with
mum Modern Art
well their problem of putting it in the
base more AR and nothing of value was
lost
oh only some duct tape and a
banana which as far as I know that was
just more of a
joke or something to see how people
train
it it wasn't like real never intended to
be more not was
just test I guess you could say couple
color squares one I mean if if they're
like me if this interesting way of I
don't know I know I've heard like this
this one kind of painting with a solid
color and having a painting of a solid
color itself isn't interesting but the
the painting was like I'm not sure what
color is the more like oil painting
maybe H which is it's still impressive
how consistent and solid the color is
for being handmade which is what makes
the painting more impressive rather than
it just being a solid color painting
that's itself doesn't mean
much
um plus as far as I know the
whole modern art or like art itself is
uh tax evation scheme so
anyway I remember hearing it about a
prank young people p in a museum SC
sced trying to re read and try not a
good combination
especially when you're in a
war oh there's
mition I need secure
area so
can continue with that reading of the
prank justum your long message
was
okay so it's this one oops I shot the
wrong
thing it's empty and then there is this
one which is
empty that means there's only one Lefty
place to
go
about
AR about and about L about
okay
okay okay let
me
the and that's about Arch
and about have message behind
it was some PL with nothing on
it nothing on it
okay so these
guys put a pineapple or
an
on it a couple days later returned to
see that mission have thought it was
anex exib place like last case but would
like wouldn't the people running the
museum know what exhibit they have or
not sure some some work like thought it
was an exhibit at the same time you feel
like wait I don't remember this being
exhibit
I was saying strong though but this just
sounds a bit
suspicious
okay now this need to secure this
area and as far as I know there's less
towers and less
mines making it easier to
secure which is why I wanted to secure
this area rather than the other
area okay I'm dying oh no it sho from
both
ways clear clear out the force as well
so it's easy to get
through oh no there's a tower
here don't kill me oh he killed
me
oops Oopsy Daisy
that oh there's no one now good I
remember that
storyy
empty
tomb
that means every building is empty
except
one but of course said slowly so it's
easy to keep what up with what I'm
saying
no so yes there no one com like oh you
speak Swedish is
slow
go which is why
okay securing the
area
shoot the
thing okay running out
ammunition
oh no I'm out of
munition get see I can f it up
here although I have to go down quite
far enough there's a mine hiding here
there it
is kind of a bad spot for
it
okay there it
is
oh ah I know
I wait one inoc
me come
on
that was a waste I thought that [ __ ]
Shing Pon
head frustration yeah I thought I could
shoot it apparently
not
shooting need to be able to pass through
with that jeep
here the tank is on
D can I can I shoot the
T
no can't hear the Laughing skeleton over
the music so I mean there's not much
left to access
that then and then I can get to the
dep still I still these maps are so
long these Final maps are going to be
very
tedious as soon as I'm done with these
Maps I 100% I can't see I'm 100% game
can
I what is 100% in this
game
[Music]
well I guess like I
did still like thinking of should I do
like this multiplayer maps because they
both function the same as single player
Maps except everything is in screen
which I guess could be annoying
much cuz they are different map
so
and I like to 100%
games but maybe I should play something
else and then get back
to the other Maps after
that
okay oh
no
of trees and not Towers left I should be
able to get through many Jeep I just
need to secure the area a bit
more a bit
more
wait what is this
music
generals Gather in their masses just
like witches have black
masses evil mindes that plot destruction
Sorcerers of this
construction wait didn't that
there we
go in the fields the B is
burning as the war machine keeps turning
death and hatred off to mankind
poisoning their brainwash Minds oh Lord
yeah you
tell oh Simon that's your name okay
think short c in
there making it very easy for the CH get
through
here and I do need to get of here before
it shoots down anything
Morey only two here I'll destroy that
one one iy that
three
now see this joing here
okay is it yeah it's in
there okay yeah than
you
[Music]
go
here we go and
then this
one no I'm
stuck look a
flag let's see is the pass to the flag
secure
are it's more secure
now y yeah I should be able to get
through with the gep
here no
problem
oh just did not well I can't remove this
stream then
perfect what someone played a mine
there that wasn't mine
mine oh
cool uh non
platformer Miss Kore
welcome yes this is a non
platformer and this is a top Town
shooter H which I guess have some
elements like that former each
elements nice I don't know it's see like
very
arcanic you don't see any first person
shooters from me oh ads
kid and subscribe that's not problem

flag now I should get out the way now I
should get back
home
come
[Music]
on see I
can this thing can run out
[Music]
anything there we
go does anyone other than me know the
game
bolo bolo B it was an old m game that
played pretty much like this on B I know
it's a type of time one the old
way Jonathan over
over let me check
that
b that's B ma
game
oh ball is a video instated for the BBC
microcomputer by Stuart
CH Chesser in 1987 and wased by chel to
the Apple Macintosh all offered for sale
for the BC micro this version is not
regarded as
lost
it's a type of
tank yeah I I can see it there's a lot
of tank shooting
games
lot of
them but I can see the similarities from
this I'm not playing it myself because I
neither had a BBC micro or a Mac off up
a creek let's move on like did that
take oh oh no this does not look like
good map we see how
it
I have a b tie so is Willi
William S is the sign I was playing yes
that is
true okay this shouldn't be too hard I
need to destroy the three buildings at
the top and then I'll destroy the
building there in the bottom
right
okay wait is there easy way to for me to
just bring up a tank
instead that's a newer 1987 version
looks like the one I
remember yeah the port
to to Mac I see it's the verion since
the original was on the micro
computer
yeah H this game is as spiritual
successor to our game let me
check return fire as it's called
just
uh oh I'm getting
attacked Let's uh let's destroy these
while I did okay hopefully I can
just drive across here up
north some
trees that's not making it
easy I hope I could just destroy this
tree and move on apparently I can't
destroy the tree and just move on it
caused me a bit of
trouble I going to see now this is the
oh thank
you okay can I shoot you
down am
I no this is Lu now I just need to
remember what the map looks
like so much toting I can't hear
music yeah I'm going to driving here oh
mine oh
[Music]
Towers so much for driving
there I'm
doing making good
[Music]
progress
but I'm getting destroyed at the
moment
oh
um yeah fire power was the one
before Apple 2 GS and commodor 64 and Ms
yeah I should have played that games but
anyway far did I get yeah I was actually
getting quite far up there to the flag
so one more
attempt H the same student made a game
before this called Firepower that was
came out night see it looks like the
same concept but not really yeah and and
then then after fire power they made the
return fire with this game I wonder what
that bottom meter is for it's never fall
it's mines when you play M multiplayer
you can play some mines which is
completely useless in play well I guess
you could place mines and then come by
with the helicopter and shoot the
mines yeah any multiplayers you have
some
mines which just mean if I do the
multiplayer maps I actually get access
to more
Firepower
mines but I don't see that willon help
me
much yeah why is there why are these
tents here as an
arrow let's place the T like an
arrow should be able to just go through
here
pleas and shooting there because it's
fun and then I should
just this F through
here I don't like you trying to shoot
me so I'm going to remove
you there we
go no I'm trying
to
let shoot down each
other okay I'm under
attack
okay I'm trying to remove the trees I
can shoot the tower it didn't go that
one oh no not these things
again but there you come and attack me
oh no my my protection is
gone oh no I gotro
okay maybe you're meant to follow the
tent arrows what should I like follow
the tent arrows and go straight into the
wall of towers I don't think I
will okay but I'm still making good
progress how I feel about flying
things yeah
those I got one Tower of my see I got a
tower making great Pro
progress oh Pap
W always with
your great
jokes
coners
the towers SE me they try to shoot
me they keep
missing because they're not
shooting where they're not shooting
where I'm going to be they shooting
where I am which I guess I guess that
would be hard
mode easy mode shoot as they didn't know
now hard mode shoot shoot where I'm
going to be if I C all of the current
trajectory then I go through
here shooting inside
again let Towers to B
me and then I just moveed through here
and then I'm up here where you find
the these
towers let's destroy the one in the
corner Tower in the
corner okay that's one of the
buildings i' rather destroy all these
towers focus on that
because it does mean I
can fly in with a
helicopter I do want to clear out the
area of to first
so going the back back way
here is this here let's destroy this
thing
okay where okay well okay there's no I
don't need to go in there because
there's nothing there there's one
here oh oh okay I need
to not the best moment to
do
that okay I'm do
posture there we go good
posture and then I'll
just move on hopefully not getting
destroyed to the final
building no it's in there oh no oh no
this isn't
good oh now I need to get up here with a
Jeep oh out of
ammo why is shooting me now missing
before hydrate oh no this is going to be
annoying hydrated
spor more timer
[Music]
over should be able to get through with
uh let's just secure the area first B
peaceful not yet I need to secure the
area
first turn this tank is
terrible I mean the je floats yeah yeah
but I know it shouldn't be too hard to
go do I can just take the same area as I
did with the tanks
but just need to make sure I
can don't accidentally get shot you
know that could
happen so just go up with the tank
here
yep shot one other one and I'm not going
to fall on the
ass let we
go and here I should be safe here every
Tower is destroyed some Tower try and
shoot ban from
that's no
problem then there's this
Tower we just destroy
it then it should be
safe
here should start
Tower I can destroy them by drinking the
out of tow and shifting it apparently
not apparently
not
okay I don't need to go through here why
am I going through
here especially because of Mind St
here don't go through here at all he
better better to go around
it and
then yeah basically need these
things have of
amunition
I should be able
to I mean yeah I can get through with
the Jeep that's no
problem there you go much better turn R
this let zoom
out maybe it should show a bit more
what's up
ahead an
idea
and yes a deep do
float they should be able to go up there
where the one other the building is and
then I go go over the deep
water
right it hopefully
work we'll
see oh trying to shoot me
already too many trees is
legs
there we
[Music]
go yeah and then I just keep away from
all the towers and go up
here and then I just go over here but in
fact there are more hydrogen atoms in a
single molecule of water than there are
stars in the entire Sol
you say
so I got
it
wait I know
so wait doesn't that single molecule of
water have two hydrogen atoms or am I
mixing terminology up
[Music]
here uh and there are one star in the in
our solar system the way you phras it
the entire solar system I didn't even
consider like or solar
system
uh but like solar systems in
general
but yeah you meant our solar system
so yes that would be
true
yes
[Music]
y not sure why I think this way bit
dangerous way to take there we go this
song is a ton of fun to play on what
instrument
indeed there we go Bas done that was
pretty short
level for being one of the later levels
more levels like this
please you
video nope same video again hey crazy
party 16 minutes 43 seconds I mean still
still a good time for compared to
levels compared to that the one that
took almost 2
hours de
[Music]
Vu
Vu okay so what have we got every island
is exactly the same it just flipped in
all different
directions wait where's the flag oh no
it's all the way down
there and the quickest way to do this
because
yeah quickest way of doing this is to
take the helicopter and Destroy they
should they should not have the
helicopter this
level and then you has to
destroy well didn't mean to do that but
sure you know when you walk into our
room I forget what you were went in for
it's because you ran into an alien and
they had to wipe your memory in order to
escape sounds about
right that means I'm meeting lot of
aliens every
day I'm
sorry I just want some target
[Music]
practice
okay so I don't exactly have to remove
that
place but it does make it easier to fly
by if I don't have those in the way like
going around so many Towers there though
the path to get those is so
long
but the
more the more of the towers I managed to
remove the more I can focus on removing
towers without having to flee
again
oh oh sorry sorry sorry I'm moving I'm
moving oh no that hit me like that so
much less Towers now it's just easier
to remove more Towers
that's
[Music]
how many T are there
still
48 uh 12 15 and 19 Towers that's a lot
of
towers that's a lot of towers okay let's
count them 19 Towers to remove
let's count them
together there they
are
oops no
no well that was a f
here
oopsie
oopsie why you laughing at
me
one I mean
[Music]
18
oh no
17 looking at me already move
out 17 uh more Towers now basically you
stop all
[Music]
Mo I say that was a good
run that's the face i' imagine when she
say that oopsie I just destroyed one of
my
helicopters I I guess that would be my
face when I say
it you're you're
[Music]
right that's why I need the face
tracking so it can show me tell you what
my expression is
like uh 16 sorry that
Tower oh one don't destroy that 15 okay
let's
leave
so that's 15 more
Towers I only need to remove the towers
from two islands and then I'm
done bang C Le did a 48 Hours stream how
does anyone stay up that long C Le
didn't C least do a more than 48 hours
definitely did more than 24 it was4 24
why am I saying 24
48 um yeah there's no other place with
Towers I'm doing this correctly and she
did
the 48 Hours of active streaming plus
sleeping while the stream was still
active not exactly sure what the point
of that
is cuz if I I could be wrong but if I'm
if I'm not wrong you pause the timer
while you're like away from breaks and
then you should do like 24 or 48 or
whatever h of actual
streaming but what's the point of having
the stream still running while you're
like
sleeping genuine question I actually
done
now
move out move out
no okay this isn't going great because
I've already lost two helicopters and
this is just the first island and then I
have to remove the stuff from the second
island so I will consider this a
failure have for 30 hours nonstop from
what is
Tak that was a
challenge see the streaming now she did
sleep so it wasn't 48 hours
straight took a lot of coffee
topress
my
okay I can't lose a single
helicopter i' say that was a successful
run I could even
leave that was almost a failed
run what was a successful
run Z to destroyed but I did damage
them I was exhausted by the time I got
home I think you were exhausted by
before you got home how many times are
there 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18
22 if I didn't count I twice I think
that's 22 towers and I need restart if
no one catch caught that cuz I lost two
helicopter to say can't do that soon as
I stepped out of the vehicle my legs
just collapsed thre me in the
grass makes
sense you are
crazy okay no no
no
nothing
okay this isn't exactly
working I need I need some water in
here I guess I just need to be more
careful not being
so
reckless if I'm reckless I won't be
Reckless I will be reckful with my
recklessness
oh I was awake for at least 7 hour
before making that
r i mean there are better life
decisions no don't okay doesn't actually
matter if I just try the
bridge
[Music]
okay that's more like it still bit
Reckless
[Music]
but let's see how long this map will
take 2
hours 3
hours let if I don't finish it when I
stream ends I let the game Run until I
start streaming next week and then I got
like a 12 hour run length or something
who it that sounds good when it's level
so much water jump out of the helicopter
and take a
swim in my purple swim see one I mean 21
Towers
left
now 20 Towers
left I'm finishing it I will finish it
don't worry I
will that was back in
[Music]
2014 when my sanity was crazy my brother
and his wife then girlfriend wanted to
back to
Texas still pressing the wrong buttons
but they weren't old enough to rent the
moving truck so have to fly out there
and rent it for
them hly it's easier
to drive halfway and then meet up with
someone there who takes it next
way
well you
know when I was in
uh once we're renting a vehicle because
I had to buy a bed and I was with a
friend at the time and and and we ask
like like because I'm the one renting it
could could my friend drive it too and
was take like
h
no but we won't
know
well the pl we switch out his wife would
drive during the day and I drive during
the
night but that apparently did not
happen
already sustain too much
damage you're looking and I miss now
shoot down the
one
that's definitely something I had to
shoot
down I got
towers and I'm not lost a helicopter
that's some good
progress but it was very windy when we
were druming
s South through
Carolina H
some and she wasn't used to driving
large vehicles that get pushed around
easily by strong winds so I took over
instead you took over of yourself like I
mean like you were driving and then and
when it was her turn you took over but
he was still driving he was driving
before and now he's still
driving I
know oh damage okay this this damage and
still Dam did damage but yeah kill no
[Music]
matter she was driving but the strong
wind made the difficult s switch okay so
she actually was driving
her
okay then you were driving during the
night this one fun being silly FL me

Arizona ARA which was in the desert is
mountains and Forest up there plenty of
signs warning drivers about bears

mean
Jeep and
ring then yes and so now I couldn't see
the cars on my to my
left that's
the kind of
need so TR the B Place mirr m i Le see
again yeah I don't even need to figure
out how I
should maybe it's almost quick if you
just go through with a tank off
own there's so many
Towers it takes such a time to go down
[Music]
there
shouldn't waste
ammo it doesn't take too long to get
down here
but one Tower gone move out move
[Music]
out see
tow now it's
d z
[Music]
can yeah this is taking a
while and then I go to New Mexico Mexico
I see and even draw through all all
back where the air smells like warm root
bear and the towels
are so so fluffy and you can even eat
your soup out of the ashtray if you want
it's okay they're

reference ala
quirky
[Music]
yeah done
this I got the more tower
now that's a good see oh no oh no oh
no
he's going to take a
line I us need to some actually this
island can we build a bridge here
now why is that not a game
element and after now car for breakfast
I found a water Burger there my detour
took me through hours and hours of
nothing absolutely nothing not even SC a
phone
scene event been dead well did you
die way too many way too many towers
down
there yep well let's head
[Music]
here and that was the end of my trip the
end well if you
die guess that was the end of the
trip I mean makes
[Music]
sense oh no they need destroy another
Tower though so that was a
success should proba probably not
risky I'll take out my anger on these
buildings after that I wed up in Rosell
in Mexico wait there was end of the
treat
[Music]

contact as we know Alan's only contact
un
States
fall in world no alien
context and USSR U
USR USSR wait do they have alien
contacts I mean maybe a few but look at
the map of alien contacts
and and it look a bit
[Music]
suspicious
oh it's game
over it's game
over
ah well I guess I had to go through with
a tank
then that's not I can't even close the
many this is the many why is the
shortest oh no it's way too much way too
much and every single business thr s has
space seem and like little
planets time
of
pro okay I'll guess I'll take the
detour quit a minute I want to destroy
it I like
this
okay time to go
home now it's destroying the
bridge oh I mean at least I clean out
the one area so I don't have to shoot
with the
tank and all the lights are neon green
and purple like 70
scii Let's Get r of
that wait where am I supposed to
go
oh this a too much damage
comee turn
that
and before long I was back in Texas just
south of the pan
Hill that's the only part of Texas I
haven't been to yet the pan
handle the handle of the
pan think I should go south
here
VI let's make a map where every island
is the same wait don't you mean that you
just Laing copy and pasting the same
island sh that's
it
don't say it like
that you making sound like come on
another one of
these you say like it's a bad
te
no he got
me wouldn't be the Vu if they didn't all

same
yeah may clear that out longl lasting
swimsuit I know it's been on for 10
extra minutes you like the swimsuit

long lasting I
hope swimsuit this swimsuit only works
for 10 minutes and then it just
evaporates oh

too to focus on the game sometimes I
check the
timers
just let's have some bunny tummy

me and if I remember correctly I should
go there right down right

yeah right down right right up
right wait I'm no
wait
can I go between those two islands I
never check
that I will save me some
work I don't even approaching that
broken Island
anymore good
check and I hope for it's been
true no that's not that's not the
command that's not
path I can't even go up that puts me
water and if I go left or right I'm just
going back to the same thing where I was
that seem like a ridiculous path you
suggest W all of a sudden never
returned
don't drive me to the water that tank
doesn't have a
snor is true it
doesn't okay let's see can I
go across here or I can cross here can I

getting a star
even if it wasn't from
toad okay you need to stop shooting

anyway oh yeah this is going to be
annoying it's going to be
annoying but still I'm making
progress progress
this I'm making
progress just say progress making
progress that's that's the P way of
saying it
progress kind of like these
mines come on how close do I need to
be
okay
progress
progress
from that means like forward
going
I'm sure progress has something to do
with
pogs May
me
punk P
punch like prob me a lot of different
things
okay thank
you
okay I might need to go back to
base okay I'm back to
P should I take a tank
instead think is Quicky but at the same
time it has nothing house so I don't

like peaceful tank
yes
right should go straight through this
area and then I go
[Music]
up oops
so long don't care about
you
whoops oops now get get
stuck okay tank is very
destroyed
okay this don't get stuck on
it
wa wrong
way yeah yeah yeah this is this
place
[Music]
oops didn't pay
attention oh War crime destroying a
hospital building it was empty it was
abandoned cares about Abandoned Hospital
buildings
right Hospital building and like now a
hospital
V after all that the tank exploded
anyway well if it was a Bandon yes it
was shot it once and it exploded
immediately and no people came out of it
that means it was abandoned already
because it was shot already but I don't
think I shot it I think the tower shot
it so the people had to leave
it I think I am innocent
in regarding the people
leaving
and yes destroying that not that that so
I can pass through that a bit
[Music]
quickly tow is
here
still
just to be on the safe
side and then I have to try all the way
down here other more times
here
don't like how they Sho
Bri oh no his tank
instead
innocent what do you mean innocent
within quotation
marks I'm the most innocent person
ever I'm a peaceful tank and I will
destroy you if you disagree
yeah if you don't think I'm peaceful and
start attacking me I will destroy
you but if you don't shoot me I don't
shoot you
that seems fair
[Music]
right
start shoting
again
well
oh no they're shooting
me I guess I do need to F the
tank I'm going to travel this
far I need to secure
that tank and
there
it's being out
security he like I've been on this
island
before feel like a
thank you for helping me
out there we go now it's
secure
now I can use this oh
no but I need to repair the tank so
let's get rid of these buildings
too makes traveling a bit
easier and no not another
one
they keep on
coming one miss
left
oh hello and goodbye flying R thing and
so many of them
too so now I just need to like destroy
four Islands or something and then I
have to travel water B back every time I
think I take too much damage and since
this is my last arm with
people
I got to be exra
careful so maybe I should use
the the other tank
instead anyway in know
news morning uh
[Music]
the on
getro for the pon pon mod as I have
three outfits which are be based on
other characters Coco bot from Crash
bandot Bianca from
Spyro and Isabel from animal
foring and they are spread around the
whole
thing on the character selection while
the four streamers I want to reference
if they agree and they are placed in a
group H together at the bottom so an
idea was that if I manage to make it
work that I can add more outfits than
what game currently have according to
someone that is
possible and I should hopefully have to
do be able to do
that that means that I can put
these
go these three
characters
at the
bottom possibly where the other
streamers are and then then place the
other streamers at the very bottom H
anyway might actually be a better
decision and then I can fill out those
three more three spaces with other
outfits which are just Co COC which are
just Pon wear other outfits which are
not based on the existing
characters let's remove this
thing it was shooting on me before
before it was shown on the screen this
game is a bit
weird
why do I take it longer more difficult
play oh no okay I changed my
[Music]
mind now done TR one
this once you know
what I go back home
now
I keep the ammo I
[Music]
have oh
no let's see if I can manage to get to
that Island to fill the tank
in this part is kind of long
I think it should be
enough but I think I need to secure
another tank
ni now I need to go
around oh no I'm
dead
[Music]
no here comes I'm
dead okay I don't like it when you shoot
the bridge
then okay I don't even have enough for
sping
it
okay he I don't have enough fuel to even
get
[Music]
home it's time to shoot them and well
this is going to be
annoying are going to be
annoying
we need to refuel it from time to time
the fuel runs out a bit too
quickly considering the size of these
Maps
yeah I really hope I can do this we only
20 minutes over
time
no it's not going to shoot me don't like
how am
ising is I way to fill up on
ammo I have planting thison but
[Music]
still go go go
go stand this
St red who
hello yeah go go go
go
there you go that's an
e e doesn't look like that on the on
screen CH
but but what on screen
chat wait a minute that pyramid has a a
feral pon pon at the
top top of the pyramid bunch of
chers P St
yeah I need to secure this
area I can get access to
these because I need
them
oh the people are
stuck now we
can didn't mean to shoot the W anyway
but get out
way want to shoot a hand grenade on me
or
something can't get to this are
here here it
comes then I need TR way
back oh my this
Lon pick because of course they have to
take a long path they could just not
have a slight land bridge there between
those two islands and this level has
been should have been so much quicker
well PID scheme there's no pyramid
schemes here got to be a
first not that no
off I tried to look for it
but I couldn't find uh way to get
across there we go that's a massive
pyramid
rid
like I can fill up am
there ding ding ding and here it comes
[Music]
when I'm
almost at the final
Island then when I finally get to the
final Island I have to destroy the
towers on
it uh
a
plun don't like that mine it has ruined
my
life
oh okay here's here's my progress so far
and this is going to take forever to you
would could nice be done with this level
I have basically two islands
left there's no lamb Bridges I
mean yeah that's that's the annoying
part this would be so much easier you
know if there was a land bridge between
these two Island and then I could but
nope I have to go around the whole thing
but this almost like there's lamb
probably maybe there's Lage there
but I don't know I've already cleared up
the area I should take
ourselves and this is my only
attacking oh
my
oh
wait this isn't way I turn
up
just go through this
are hopefully don't get
stuck and then I have to tank on this
thing
instead here it
comes oh
okay now let's
see and then across this
bridge I mean at least I complet more
than one level but I can't imagine like
that one level take like four five 6
hours to complete The Pyramid game is
growing hello looks like you looked away
before I didn't even see that
thing that was posted like 5 minutes
ago five minutes ago
46 minutes ago yeah I'm playing
Minecraft on what server is what playing
Minecraft at the what server at the
moment oh
Minecraft that's a game I could
play but what how would I 100% it like
getting achievements defeating End
Dragon
some is probably really anointing
yet and here it
comes oh no it shot me once
rude okay that one is destroyed but are
there any more
Towers up here yes they are of course
they
are no Sho in the
wood come
on trying to mind my own business
here nothing wrong
I could be wrong
then yes it looks like I'm
wrong does not seem to be a way to fill
up come on I'm peacefully standing
still he there's no way to pill up
ammunition that's a bit
annoying
well that's annoying but there's a road
pist at Le
nothing oh this is the final Island
before the real
Island
yeah I'm not sure what I'm
doing
when I don't have any place to get more
ammunition which is
annoying so I don't have a reason to go
than oneing
up oh that just adds to the tediousness
I should just have one on this
island they might have it on this island
but
no
don't I need
to look around
but wh don't mind
me don't mind
me oh right I guess I just have to drive
home all the way again just didn't take
Mees to get
there it's almost like they didn't even
play test this
game they put together a map and then
all this is
good this is good no need to change
anything
or maybe that was the gaming in the
early
[Music]
nice oh no he's shooting at me how
right
yeah the only thing I can think of is if
one of these like there's one
there so I just need one of the old item
later on to have one as
well sure I could go up there and try
to secure it
but
no there's a tower
there oh well doesn't matter I have
enough you to get
home this is just too far wait this
when shows up every time your F face
sometimes it doesn't show up sometimes
it shows up very quickly and sometimes
it doesn't
sh seems to be
random
yeah I really need to have a place to
fill up fuel not fuel ammunition all the
way over on those
places this
is having to go all the way back to the
home
bases two
TS
[Music]
but maybe the
island there might have munition because
every island might be like every other
design or something so all for har it
might be higher
uh but I don't
see that kind of gate okay the island
actually approaching that might actually
help so yeah the item I'm trying to go
through that one might have
the munition I'm looking
for
of course problem is that I take damage
and damage yeah except for going back
home I would still have to do
that but at least I wouldn't have to go
home just because I'm running after
Min is also thing that has
happened
anything else funny going
on
funny I'm thinking if that's
funny well maybe not okay
um someone did make a
drawing of a character designed for
like
IDE that could be fun to make I I need
to check if I can make
the move out
first I forgot to
feel
[Music]
something kind of going on I want last
all the way it seems to be able to do
that I shouldn't be a fewu up here so it
can last all the way up all the way here
just a bit risky to to try for it though
but it can do
that and here it
comes so
much there are flying think yeah but
this island I'm approaching here might
have what is it North or South I think
South might have no wait I think I
checked that and it does not
have yeah I think no it's just as a
stupid
Bing
this
stupid
Bing building that there nothing for
me
okay I don't like how you keep shooting
at
me so I need to I'm going I'm not going
to approach next Island until I at least
go back home first so I do wonder if I
can reach that
toway yeah like that
hello Laos welcome welcome welcome hello
hello red is here
what what's going on between
you
n I'm leaving now La is here I mean you
can't do the same joke
it's there we
go that's not how it
works it's okay R in time out right
now
just
joking you're not going
anywhere not while you're in
timeout I can and I
will what
for I just left an aggravating stream oh
oh
was because I said something I'm I'm am
curious what's what's so
aggravating with that stream the people
the Stream the
game it the
game Spill the Beans what's going on
with that
Ang I have had moments
where the streamer has said
something I have stories to tell without
telling who the stream is of course or
out of
respect I Len to rock music way too loud
and what but then you don't hear about
my story
about
streamers get rid of
that I what the shortcuts do
here oh what
band what
BS
okay now there's no
routin R thing doesn't the W show
up did you find a nice swimsuit oh all
right
right H yeah I didn't check back on that
sorry um I should check back on that
again H I will I will look more into it
good you remind me of that I kind of
forgot about
it slipnot is what I have on currently I
like Foreigner I like Caravan Palace I
like
the yeah that's your same
song you sure like the tell dirty
CHS
about white stuff
anyway moving
on oh no
anyway but I also got Nana night wish
Amar
Luna coin
Rod zombie the Smashing Pumpkin six
pistols to name a
few okay
so the last part is going to be so
annoying oh
R
and well I did manage
to make the material for P for the
outfits for the P mod being the same
like settings or
something as for
uh the uh the default outfit so every
outfit should have a consistent effects
applied to them because that sometimes
they had weird effects like different
shading and
stuff if you look at the uh I'm not sure
how obvious it
is but if you look at
the Isabel green dress outfit the
pictures that posted you will see some
kind of blue light from
behind which I mean you could argue
makes sense considering a blue
background but h no other outfit has
that
light and the several ARS have a
slightly different W of how they playing
the Shader but now I made it
consistent as P
ponies because some some some of the
outfits Coco have have quite
different you
watch I'm not going to risk it I keep
forgetting about
it
for some
reason cuz pum is just putting on
different
clothes Coco however can turn into all
kinds of different
things like turning into a robot turning
into an alien
species and
someone you hear the weird out par the
sounds of Nana
yep yeah wait
sorry
s SAS p p
outfit you want pon pon as a suus that
doesn't sound bad like a bad idea was
that already added to the list of
outfits but maybe I should add
it
like CRA which I could do like yeah so
if I put the
six uh put the three out oh
yeah like
there to
think maybe I should put the out SP
other characters as as another row
because then I can fit six of
those
musi welcome welcome is welcome
Raiders welcome to pon pon the bon bon
playing TDS
G don't ask me how long I've been on
this level because I don't know how long
I've been on this level but I'm very
close to the end on my final life and if
I fail now I have to start over I'm not
on this stream though definitely not on
the
stream here it
comes
yeah oh come
on
ands of
course ands
now
okay well that was
awward get twit
yeah me it has a setting that it
wouldn't oops Yeah
oops it has a setting that it should not
play the ads if there's High user
activity like High View like if there's
a peak in view C which I would say it is
when it is a RAID and I have that's
enabl just to see but ads never
move it doesn't do
anything at least he doesn't abuse you
to like play ads because there's a he
doesn't do that he just plays ads at
this
time don't so
don't yeah was by bad
timing I'm getting destroyed I'm getting
destroyed
well that was that area I need to go
home again because I did too much
damage oh yeah that didn't go well that
did not go well at all I well help F get
some
ad I mean I I
apprec I appreciate that at least I
don't know who has ads and don't have
ads yeah this is
awkward I have one more
minute one more minute
no wait keep get to up the
tank have good stream on I'll be off
okaya have a good
time whatever you after to doing
byebye this 17 viewers everyone
left which I understand if people leave
because an are playing
but my phone's about to
dead it's only been 4
hours okay ads should be
over yeah I did not have control over
the ads so Che that
phone okay I've set the ads to play once
like 3 minutes every hour so get like
507 minutes of VI ship only be 4 hours
yeah and uh and I think
that's nice cuz if someone just drops in
they get a lot of viewer time before
even adds playing instead of dropping in
and as we play within like 50 minutes I
think the default is 20
minutes I rather have it hourly
instead this is true but twitch is
supposed to tell me that an ad is
upcoming so I can press snooze and then
when a ra shows up and then like oh
analys is upcoming I
press but that was like within just
not long after the raid happens and
start playing
so it's like 50 and when when that time
is like 52 53 that our starts
playing she can
now and I
said come on so many missiles neverone
Le and and as said the setting for not
playing as when B ship spikes should
also have not played as maybe I should
check maybe that set
disa maybe I thought it was enabled it
wasn't but that's my
fault I want to stay and keep a good
Bean Company that would be very nice of
you but I don't have bean
you're talking about something else but
I should also eat something and sleep
okay sleep sounds important oh you got
the star you are the
star yeah yeah if you need to sleep you
should go to sleep if you need to eat
you should go and
eat I do appreciate the that you're here
and chefing that I do really appreciate
that
now was back to 22 watches
interesting did some people choose to
come back after
that a lucky star you're so lucky you
can pay five points for it and you get
it guaranteed so lucky you can do it
once a stream
too okay posture check hydrate and
star the star doesn't do anything there
you go happy like this is how far I
got there is not many many many Towers
left but those towers are so
annoying favorite customer you are my
favorite customer POG return fire on
Twitch yes inde he return fire on Twitch
a game that is really tedious at the end
of the game and I'm not even at the end
of the game
yet
what even is that map I uh it's it's a
crazy map so favorite
customer I hope you enjoy yeah I'm like
the only one who streams this
game has anyone ever streamed this
game I need to find other games that are
rare
rare and
unknown just me I confus this
map I think I've seen it like once
before
Oh I wonder what they play on but I
enjoyed stream still that's good Happy
super happy
eg a with happy
in C little round
EGS how did oh no I'm out of
hydrate no he hit
me I'm
all but I guess that's a reminder to
continue sting up
street but yeah I'm I'm out of and I
really wish to finish this level and
then when I do the stream is
over all right food and sleep yes yes
you need food and you need
sleep
[Music]
oh stream over soon uh when I get the
flag I first have to take this tank I
have to destroy the
base find the flag then take the the
jeepy and then pick the flag up
with no I want to stay until Level is
done no you don't you don't want to stay
until Level is done this is a tedious
level you don't want to stay until it's
done I'm going to stay until LEL is done
but I'm not sure if you want
it I don't know how long long it will
take it could could as well take another
hour Arrow hour to do this
level
you see how long it takes to just get to
the area I need to fight
in and after enough ammo ammo I have to
travel all the way back
home oh yeah that's
yep and if I lose this tank it is game
over
and then I have to restart the whole
level only from this
St that's not going to be
fun I need to be a bit more careful here
I that's a
p only FS rush
in
okay okay good
good right destroy it
s
go so I'm very close to the place where
things
are but it's just
that on
I need to remove the towers is
time okay I rushed in I'm
dead I'm not doing that
bad okay this oh come on
this place looked a bit more crazy on
the
map and I have shot some of the towers
with my
helicopter okay I'm taking too much
damage
leave so I actually did quite a lot
there wish I
could I'm not reing
it in that case it's not a worry for
me but I can't help giving support to
you I really appreciate the support to
give I go hope you all have the best
time and stay coffee out there think you
sleep you need sleep I need sleep I wish
I could sleep as well as people can
sleep but that's my curse at the
moment I been
cist there you go took a while for you
to show
up
than you
great so I should be able to get home
with this amount of fuel
but
but when I finally done this level it's
going to feel so
good I mean like I not been on the I
don't think like the longest level I've
been on so far has been 1 hour 50
minutes and 40 something seconds is this
going to be longer or shorter that's a
prediction to
make
for
okay
uh let's do that
uh 150 40
something
uh
and I will check if it's uh what other
one
is there we
go let
go
that's a prediction now every everyone
who isn't from restricted countries are
allowed
to take part of the prediction It's the
final time when I finally put the flag
and with the Jeep onto my base is it
going to be longer than the longest map
I've currently been know which is I said
1 hour 50 minutes and 40 something
seconds or is it going to be shorter so
over under that
time okay let let me clarify if it's
going to be exact the same time I I
going so I shouldn't have written under
but more like no not over it's actually
what it's supposed to be so I guess the
second option is a Miss
number but it's just if the times are
exactly the same the second option wins
because it's not
longer and the third option is that I
will just fail the
map in that case I don't get any
time put in your predictions this is
going to be
exciting
up
again everyone is allowed to
party but the all stud it's going to be
exact same time it's so
tiny and that we don't even have to
consider
that I need much longer shorter to be
fine tit so longer than shorter than or
it's going to be a failure be right back
thank you for
participating
prediction yeah you probably will be
back before I'm
done and of course just to be sure I
will check what the longest I mean on
the previous level just to be
sure but I mean unless you can C unless
like I'll check just be sure you
know I mean I technically I BR 1 hour 50
minutes and 40 something seconds I guess
that is the time that should be
considered regardless what the longest
map actually
is
and noing this
[Music]
time
the music goes
ecstatic but I'm still traveling to the
base I'm not I reached it
yet I assume egg left before any
prediction could have been
made he's fine he's fine
anyone else AC and if no one means all
points will be
refunded as I usually
do
fun with Channel
points which about some other like games
or something but I do also wish you
could have like multiple predictions
going at the same
time cuz sometimes you can have multiple
popups on the twitch
chat like if you p a message and you
have the prediction
going
you might have a hypee
train you might have drops and anything
there's a few you can have a few of
those Ena at the same time and twitch
really needs to find a better way of
showing all of them at the same
time but one idea could be
to have the it be part of
the same Banner as shows the gifts and
bits just adds to
that
anyway
saying Okay so I should make sure that
the I do have this have destroyed this
place quite a lot
so okay it's not
there
so it's destroy
it where is a weak I guess it's a good
thing that s is a weak
but okay
finally okay I want
I want the the right one here to contain
it because that one is not the one that
has all the mines around there it
is oh no not you why did you
come not course the problem
is these
towers
and I don't have enough ammo to take
care of
them they should not shoot me when on up
there so this should be
fine let me a bring tank back home in
case I need it again I'm not going to
take any risks at this
point and then I will try to use the
jeep
but there is no guarantee or sedic nice
nice nice anyone El I'm getting to the
final stretch
now put your predictions in is it going
to be the longest map I've ever
done
um I got to keep this tank almost D it
into water okay wait a minute but no no
no I was I'm confused the two islands I
had a form of De
VI that was a joke on the 11 name yeah
confus this island with the final Island
and that was only because of the bridge
that goes up up
up no
R yep it does add the timer but you
know okay I'm not risking at this point
for so long I spent on this
level here comes the root
thing when the only reason I'm going
home is because I'm out of
ammo and not because I I'm barely
damaged
so can definitely clear out that area
more to make safer and cheap I think it
should be safe enough flying R thing
[Music]
y it is
exciting I I have no idea how long this
level has
taken because I don't even remember when
I started I did do a few other
levels so I'm not been on this
level but I've been on it quite a
wi some have been quick some have been
slow
B
so that's
enough
and also when you run out of hu one
person leaves the vehicle runs away one
single person is operating this whole
vehicle we would imagine it was a whole
team but
nope or it's just the captain leaving
and everyone stays in
there no flying R yeah that's what I've
been saying it doesn't show up every
time just some
sometimes
and this is the final stretch home and
then I'll will take the
Jeep but I'm going straight down with
the Jeep that's why I had to clear off
that Island anyway so clean off that
Island was not a waste of time even
though I never was there with the of
stuff D straight ahead is
there going I go bit straight
here PE will
keep this is going to take a
[Music]
while I should I mean I think I will be
a beat to the side of the island but I
will still see the island cuz you zoomed
out it this
yeah here we
go Yep this looks all
destroyed and I barely used up any field
which is good cuz that means I don't
need to
tank Lu there's a bridge to the next
Island
okay go go go go go I got the flag I got
the flag I got the
flag now I just need to cross this ocean
again go
go W speed my head
[Music]
the fa P fun is does not app the
[Music]
singing and then a tower shoots me and
the flag floats because if you leave the
flag in the water it flows to the
nearest land and then will float over to
that Island then I need a tank and go
and clear out that island so I can go
there for the G but luckily that did not
happen oh if that's happened that would
be
I didn't know what I would do at that
time that
case there we go bam Bas
land who getting
there is it safe it should be safe
yes I'm okay I'm winning the level I'm
winning the level I won the
[Music]
level
[Music]
we got one versus one person
voting okay we only see this what's the
time it
is it is
158 oh
my it is it is
longer the other one was
[Music]
150 1 1 hour 50 right well yeah and it
was 25 seconds was not 40 40 second
something but
yeah then I have those levels left three
more levels then four more
rounds then was long congratulation
whoever voted for one which wasian
another
[Music]
five oh I'm sorry at least was 50/50
there it's
nice it it is nice when the colation
amounts are the
same it would be interesting if you had
if I could make it so you have a fixed
amount you must predict with not more or
not less or like a maximum minimum
amount you can set both vales to the
same ifone must predict the same
amount next prediction I'm putting
20,900 on it all my
moneyy we need it's more fun when we
have more more people take taking part
of with this
one
um that would be fun instead of just one
and
one that was quite the
adventure uh yes and as you saw I did
press save but I will make a save state
to to be on the same side you
know so after all that that's
craziness well thanks for thank you
everyone for being here and everyone who
stayed off the ra and thank you m raen
and I'm sorry for the hats was a bit out
of my control it was basically out of my
control h so should we make a Giant Raid
because currently I have four four
options here someone raid we got FS
Panda fdw what playing Li of te we got
the jaas cat who has ra me he has
suggested two other raids to me actually
I think that's what is going on so that
might be a nice nice raid he's playing
Dark Souls remastered with for
viers H fantas six it's not the same FAS
here mlax playing a AP Escape he is
really nice and uh I've not never raed
him before I think so that he has three
viewers at the moment and finally
prongles art doing art which two viewers
doing traditional
comic yes yat games he has a separate
gaming channel from his music
channel I have a request if you want
it's not that I need one but if you
think you have a better request than the
ones I've listed so
far I do feel like I want to visit like
Mass LX or something because it's really
nice and nice and
nice and I I'm surprised how well he
managed to keep up with the chat despite
how active it can be at
moments
and so how about we go there and make
his chat really active I think that
would be a fun thing to do plus that
don't think I've read before so and I
don't always have the option here you
know and I'm consider how nice and kind
is and he tries to like have a
conversation going with Watchers as
well uh so it's really nice
to it it really I assume it depends on
if if you find anything common with him
too of
course you call iation yeah let's do
that let's do
that
let's do that myu slow as
usual it's a good uh uh a good friend
who just started a stream called mag mag
Arts I would write that down and I will
check it out ins so and uh and it might
be a future r t how about that I do
