something
is rabbit
Stampede I'm I'm not I I like to read it
but I I'm not sure how I should read
that I KN I can't even read the
letterers
Mo oh it's
russan
we is back to front it's all
ripped I mean it is
no I was thinking about starting the the
software that will handle the outp
changes but
I still forgot to start
it uh and I still need to do that update
at some
point let
me at
least so I have the controls mirrored as
well so that spider will still work as
if it's
normal
transpire one flash anyway you can try
that
again
o okay
let's it works on this it m
slot oh look it's Arabic it's written
right left in the world of drag I mean
no
of okay rolling oh it's been
peaceful world we can't probably skip
the part every and and everything is
actually mirrored for me so it's it's
not a it's not a trick of the stream
everything is actually mired this looks
very different even though even though
it's just mirrored it's it's
odd it's very
odd where is the portal on that side but
the controls are working perfectly fine
perfect okay one thing I want to change
is the camera from
passive to
Victor let's start
resing bunny Telly do you want to
li no Russian is English but Al
Swedish
what P PS1 SPID wasn't in Swedish other
the contrs aren't mirrored I mean I
mirror the controls so they are double
mirrored so they back to normal so if I
press left he's walking to the left
so how is that different that has now
you're spelling how is that different
that he's not orange and not has no neck
Oh Oh you mean that
one still keep bunny trying to be TW
still s
after oh
yeah I appreciate you
Subs I really
do did I
like just
do cuz I I did mentioned that on another
stream when someone else was streaming
that one thing I did as when I was
really young J young was that
I uh just was quite sloy with collecting
gems and and such until I defeat nastor
and then I went back to 100% the
game the whole world I wanted to do this
in reignited but I wanted to be an
actual
mod because actually changing because at
least they because I'm running on Emily
no
surpris I packed down my PS3 so I can't
use it
anyway
anyway one to two H
so yeah it's just random running
around so the idea was to mirror this 3D
world like mirroring the camera but not
affecting any of the UI but currently
the UI is mirrored too that does help
me uh like understand that everything is
mirrored but when the UI isn't mirrored
that would be very
confusing
anyway the adventure
begins hello pon pon hello where am I oh
I didn't mean to go into this store but
I guess I mean here you should play with
non reverse controls so left is Right
Vice verse I think that seems like a bad
idea oh no I got damaged good thing this
is the no damage
run I didn't even well I did get at
these 10 dragons I could move on from
the first world but I always messed up
on
something jle drunk
young sometimes when it comes to
the yacht sound in
English I actually pronounce it as j
instead is my hyper
correction so I said Jung instead of
young that's because I that's because
the like it take the English word job
which in Swedish is is
yob
because good run past
see how drunk you bunny how drun yeah
that's that's make bunny drink I would
could be a good idea to know that I
don't
drink any form of
alcohol there is there is a type of Al
alcohol drink that is called alcohol
free free but it's because it's lower
than half a percent I
think when it's below half a perc it can
be classified as alcohol free but it's
of course not alcohol free because it
contains half a perc and I don't want to
drink that even but people keep saying
but it's alcohol
free now thinking like imagine doing
that with other things like it contains
half a percent of gluten it's
glutenfree
yeah I'm
not I wasn't even
close I'm just I'm just messing around
at
moment crash with reverse controls
slippery clim oh you you like normal
normal crash but the controls are
reversed that
sounds I mean that sounds annoying at
first but after a few but after getting
used to it that shouldn't be too
tricky or maybe at he's
braging those sheep she shepher I felt
like such a freaking genius when I first
figured out I could jump over the cane
slaps 20 years
ago
yeah that's true
I that was
something
I think I did that
too what are you doing on this side
everything's
it's but it feels we feel so good
jumping over
them okay can probably not skip this
much of a level because I'm not going to
have enough
dire
so I probably have to go
and pick up another
Dragon a bit
disorienting it's kind of like playing a
new level except it's not a new level
not played SPID for a while I play
playing SP for a bit now it's it's the
uh what do you comfort
it's the Comfort game for me at the
moment I can feel
better I didn't mean to judge for that
song what
abouta wait what's
that # gluten gluten free
Bros then I actually saw a streamer do
this and I've never okay I need to go
one step
more
H did they work one
me there we go
yeah I've never never done that
before now i' done that I can feel
satisfied I got 94 no
wait there we go
371 got five dragons I need Z One
dragons let's go into this
place this feel so weird going in
there dragons are naturally gluten
free that
is I don't know what gluten
is the animals contain so many strange
things
so
eh we not being able to eat bread or not
gluten bread at least I do like breads
I'm glad I'm
not gluten
inant but
um
and but I don't know how glutenfree
bread tastes like compared to gluten
bread gluten
bread another triangle hover in spider
one no there
isn't I didn't even try to use it let's
go yeah if they was I could go over
there easier but I had to go up lar kuch
is a fermented
lightly effervescent sweetened black tea
drink commonly consumed for its purpose
for its purported health benefits so
it's not scientifically proven
then it technically has alcohol cause of
fermentation but it's so small you would
have to drink a very large amount of Fe
and and that might be true for the
alcohol free drinks I mentioned
too what percentage would that be like I
I guess it might not be a consistent
percentage
but he oh they picked it up what you
said
glutens but you don't know
it pack for
fun I I said
that I know about like some people being
gluten intolerant
and and like uh bread contains gluten
and inside the thing and and stuff like
that but that doesn't mean I know
exactly what gluten
is he hello J nice to see you oh yeah I
think it was this yeah it was here all
almost completed this level but one of
these Bulls hit
me and it was the last level
too and before I was going to move over
to I think this yeah
poof time
now it's because I stand close
it I move away
oh no don't move the
camera I take you out the fum
see hey also less than half% alcohol
well
yeah see I guess I guess there might be
a similar rule there that if it's less
than half a percent it's does not count
as Al
S A lactose intolerance drink milk and
you expire that's an interesting way to
put
it oh no I missed that gem I didn't mean
to press that but
there I'm hurt in my # glus one SP your
life Al so nice to see your Kitt
face here wait how how do you see my
face where's the
webcam so let's see where is the it's in
here okay I did write in
the
Titan and that this is mirrored but if
someone were to
arrive now let's do this level
too e out
it's
out it's
out um yeah but it wouldn't be fun if
someone did yeah I think not everyone
does read the title
so someone comes in and this feels wrong
for some
reason I don't
know
easy easy
dogs there you go did I I did miss some
gems I we back to what happened what
happened what
happened nice to see me I am doubly
appreciated something's going on in chat
no I I did flame
you that I was going to say was that the
second time I took damage in this run
that was the third time I took damage I
think because I I did kill a frog or
something I am hungry
so yeah eat eat
Viper I mean
if and I get both at the same
time
nope both got me at the same time
though no
[Music]
the dead body protected
it there you go now I deal with
you
whoa T it on the wrong
[Music]
side there we go
88 we're keeping track of damage
ah
yes one
man I'm so
confused continue to confuse
me I don't know what's going
on
anyway that should be enough
yeah
let's go to okam the
balloonist see
lab let's go to three Peak
esap
yay this is not for any speed running
I'm just I'm just playing it bit
randomly
random game Bunny not understand her own
chat but plus 10 K for that times 20
cute for orian for being here it's that
easy for
oh okay it looks like Oran always has to
be here to quantify myness
level so sorry I completely missed your
hydrates even though I did probably
hydrate at that
time
I really wish I
could I can maybe make it play like a
when to out the
star it probably because when I come
when I do the when I speci is 3 mod I do
want to do some design changes on the
stream I'm making
like
something at least like have it play a
sound for me even if if he doesn't have
have to play on
the stream there we
go swimuit
time purple swimuit with the
rainbow your K level no REM kidness
level excuse me
oh Oh you mean 20 times cuteness for
reman
water okay I
see so
yeah
boom so his cutness level stays
unchanged I I thought I hit in there you
know there's
um oh thank
you Z *
20 I'm doing the same joke again
um I didn't like these when I was a
child and apparently the developer
didn't like those either so they removed
him I do damage again
I kind of lost track of my Dem off
damage I've
taken so
don't bother hunting
it okay here's a thing you can do in
this game let's see if I can do it again
let's see let's see come on
Spyro you
do
no you can make SPID fall down it isn't
that exciting but you can only do it you
can't do it anymore but you can yeah you
can only do
[Music]
it the first time when you
rescue it's not that interesting I guess
I think I'm going the wrong way I think
the mirroring confused me
there
five times
damage okay oh my 20 times still man you
need
some buny
not
no it was a
joke do a red proxy what
what's
that what's that red proxy oh don't fall
down I'm confused in this level even
without being
mirrored did you see
that you see that jump I
did I'm not sure how I did
it and next thing
next going the wrong
way
nice
nice no one has been able to touch their
tense
yet can I get those last two
nope I touched well I got them before
they enter the tent but I
accidentally went burned one tent
so okay destroy this
thing that thing I guess it's
fun destroy these destroy
that there you go everything
destroyed I saw the
Yum what do you think of my jump oh
no now I saw
that to jump 11y old in
slow but I was like glitching into the
ground or something I thought it was
interesting looking and then I did
that this is an interesting this is an
interesting
level love equals infinite
love he times infinite
claps T no those are tomato
tarps
what that is there's no such use when
you push
them can I do that you st taking
[Music]
damage
wa get out the way I'm trying to that's
77 gems already
[Music]
nice you can you can touch that platform
very very
far obviously there aren't any tomato
stored in them at this
time okay fair
enough calling it bunny will die to
shamp byee much
love
uh what's the what's the prediction when
will I die the first
[Music]
time I don't know how how what what
would the options be in such a
prediction when will when will the first
Death
happen these
keepers
magic
crafs uh uh Beast
makers dream
Weavers
NEX or no death
before
nasty okay
there you
go let's
go which which world will the first
death happen
on
there we go not sure what happened
there funny typing funny is
typing too early there I I am able to
type I'm a good
typist I'm doing my part thank you papa
wolf thank you for part in the
prediction I do appreciate
it it's all for
[Music]
fun and as I've shown already I'm not
really like 100% in levels I'm
just going through them
casually damn you beat champ well done I
am defeated and now silent
like thank thank you
for appreciating my
flight what a flight
though really looks like they like I
guess it's
not say I probably
should eat some get sparks
back I get sparks back
first just's be on the safe
side
there you
go I don't need Sparks for the
flight and and of
course a death would be when you lose a
life and you don't lose a Life by
failing a
flight I better win oh Rocket Man you
never
win
oh what a confusing level this
is let's do the regular house
here how how do I read that clock 17
16
oh who
who come on spider
fly cing up the sports
way stop ticking on
[Music]
me
[Music]
wa I did
it hello po girl I hope nothing's well
with this by
game I'm going to win wow that was
cold I'm sorry
but I want go too adir
it well I do mean like prediction I'm
not saying
like Roy man is like a good he's a good
video game player that's a that's a term
is a good
gamer but in the predictions for pon pon
those are going terribly POs to check
okay now I now I get TR that I I feel
like I'm keep up the chat better this
time how come the words backwards yeah
why are the words backwards does does
the level look normal to
you is is just just just the words
backwards rest of the level is perfectly
[Music]
normal and I guess it's a normal normal
game is
mered yep every level is
mired
I fig
that yeah the title and says so too but
not everyone reads the title it's not
uncommon
too not read the
title they
cleared I to go through this
level
normally oops one more
try I could predict that I'll wake up as
a human tomorrow and wake up as an
airplane prediction I might think
guys yeah
exactly I did spe specifically say
predictions uh like p man just jumping
out there to get a key and oops the key
isn't
there
reading who it's
reading
[Music]
ready don't forget about
prediction obviously if you're from a
country that can't predict that's just
twitch being
silly one one
two one one
three so I should continue
here make sure I don't me
CH
goodbye all I need to Flame here I can't
shot you all right get out of the
way get your dead body out out of
here wait there was no stairs on this
side I've been tricked by the
mirroring you'll wake up as a rocket
tomorrow rocket man has always been half
a rocket
so that's the
dream that bunny I mean they were
certainly not alive
bunnies look at this Dead
Bunny we have a bunch of gems Jamies
Jamies I like gems give
me I'll take some gems in real
life 200 and
one I wanted to say 200 but I
accidentally picked up another
Gem and then they should be here I I was
thinking that the mirroring would have
done more to make the game confusing
but
I did forgot one thing
um let me just quickly change the
controls there we
go now I forgot to flip the
[Music]
rolling running the wrong way this
time I have a few
gems most
mostly
interesting haven't seen
those have have you kept them as a
secret I don't know
what par
is does sound interesting huh because I
don't know what it
is more than it being a gem
who it's a light greenish
Stone I was hoping for pink but I guess
green is
nice it has a value of
two let's continue
then entering
what
F but
yeah excuse
me what's with
these okay I did not expect that to
happen that was very
Weir
this world is weird this is not how it's
supposed to
look oh
Cactus
oh
damn
no I wanted to Flame
you you are protected by whatever the
sorry there's an ace here which for some
reason I'm really bad at
catching so when I was doing it without
flame that
was almost impossible wait I can't blame
them there is still the idea of no
charge do I to do a run of
that
come on
Sparks how close I need to
stand oh secret
chems can't keep them away from
me that was a long
jump
[Music]
don't mind
me all
anyway
so there is a chest here that
requires a rocket which is over there
which you can technically reach from the
ground but I think you're meant to go up
here and then fly down there to get it
of course oh no no no no
stop doing that but it is a good idea
okay this one has Dro to rescue the
dragon
first hey
hey wait someone read
[Music]
something
[Music]
so after you rescue the dragon you get
this Sparky thing here and now you can
fly over here to the
rocket rocket
[Music]
thing then you can go
here and taada oop almost fell
down
easy sneaks in
quietly hello
C you
are not very quiet I noticed
you but you are very welcom in here
to think to the bunny Dan what was what
was it called rabbit
burrow
hey
hey which level didn't I do did I do all
levels I just proceed to next World
where's balloon over there bit
disoriented at the moment happy Monday
good
people that popping and say hi while I'm
working I do really appreciate
that the
long and let's let's go to magic
Crafters
miss going through the game
after
speed we go that's Sun hydrates that's
requested
do careful
here well turning right this
time you have trouble reaching this egg
Thief there's a trick to do
that could almost keep up just
working
anyway
wa H okay no D here no
welcome to Magic Crafters thank you
Dragon if you don't die this is a
f so what you do
is you open up this passage which you
can use this four which you can only do
once there
go otherwise you have to walk around the
other the
way and
then you take this one
okay not like
that then you take this one there we
go now where is my sear where did my
charge
go I don't know what level I hate know
what level I hate with passion Treet
Toops I mean what uh what a
controversial
opion I'm going the wrong way I'm
confused by the
mirroring what what a what a what an
exceptional rare
opinion exceptional rare don't
know is a good time here
but anyway you take the super charge and
then you zoom pass it and then boom okay
come
on you supposed to zoom in to the ex but
if
youum yeah can let's let's pick it up
normally let's get the SE normally
then
stop you and everyone else is play this
game I don't mind three tops M
[Music]
personally that's only because I went I
was a
little
child I figured out how to do
treps on my
own when you like these you can charge
along with them to begin a
super go
put you also hate Treet Toops but it's
just a nice this
level this isn't the way I'm supposed to
go I'm supposed to go there trick by the
mirroring
again never took tree TPS into
consideration I'm
predicting don't
worry
ow appar bad at hitting this one where
am I going
okay
life no not exactly where I wanted to
go although to be fair doing Treet Toops
mirror that that could give some unex oh
nice turn
Spyro beautiful
[Music]
turn still getting fooled by the
miring well did someone predict yeah
theion timer is over I forgot about
that okay I need to stop doing
that so watching this not realizing his
mirror like
what what am I
doing what am I doing running into this
wall all the time that's how I wanted to
do
it there we go wasn't that hard was it
we almost stepped up
there
stop that would have been an unfortunate
way to
go anyway when you talk to this
balloonist or he
says do me a favor recover some eggs
from them would
you then you walk
[Music]
away and then you walk back he
says I S maybe I can help you recover
those fire dragon eggs I bet you would
do
well to hunt for eggs on Wizard
Peak the
entrance Port is just up the hill behind
you
okay let's do
that
see there is a there's a guide in this
game let's go up to W Peak which is
behind me but I have to like go around
everything this is one of the two
only purple pink spring
boxes in a before who are before the
special
level in that level there's plenty of
them anyway don't worry pon pon don't
worry p p want to die at three TRS she's
the only person in enti world who
doesn't hate that level
apparently it's a fine level I why why
do I have such problem with it I
probably do wor in this
level still J here
yes
where too
Spyro
oh hey are you trying to hit me
so oh I saw a
Miss hey hey
hello now I was in the
air that just
cheating
boom this level is on my train I
especially want to do this level without
Flame
Le you can open the
those no I miss I missed the
enemy I mean I can just Flame the enemy
but what's fun in
that see pon pon really does like Treet
toop
but Spot
It come
on come on game don't do this to me
is a fun
[Music]
lemon
okay really go for
this I shouldn't have gone for
that and I did press jump many times but
nothing happened
anyway as will be playing anyway so
congratulation Whoever thought I was
dying on this
level or
world oh
look so ads in the
meantime magic
Crafters I okay
so that was um a
surprising or I'm surprising
this uh let me just
make a slight adjustment to
the
picture Oh wrong
Buton
I don't know maybe like that maybe
something like
that there you go no more black
bers
so do I have any clap emotes oh I
do
who
wait how 20,000 how much did he he oh he
predicted 10,000 so he won 10 one
10,000 uh I should I should write write
this down
because
uh so plus 10,000
to get
[Music]
man and then it
B no has the wrong
oneus 5,000
and
so there save the
documents but way hen I have fabulous
bungo
bu okay
so the previous person was done where's
Red Red needs to see some bunny me okay
anyway back enough stalling I I'll do I
I'll with that quick hydrate
though back to the
game back to the game no more
filing D that's what I wanted to
do you called yeah it's buny timey
time do you see the money tummy of
course you
did why is there a w here why can't I go
here there you
go imagine imagine if you had to chase
this D we
go and now to see if I can get
back
we problem is that every other enemy
does spawn when you get rid of that one
sadly time to pet fluffy bunny tmy bunny
tmy pop Nemo wait what do you mean by
Nemo
you mean
there is that the emote name oh yeah you
you wrote a lowcase and now I see what's
going on here I see cute snoot and
Beauty be
eyes that wasn't
nice when
will should
[Music]
I what should I
do another
prediction
let's let's let's do the second then
because it's probably because people
like it
[Music]
anyway oh wolf got got a emot too
everyone got
emot
yes squeeze
no squee it squeeze
it oh you you keep
missing we keep
missing
celebration can can Rocket Man win a
second
time
well I reach the end of the
level oh I I I would like to Li a
tortilla wait that's not the tortilla
that's
see what was was it t now C with some
something else I
think there's the balloon now if I go
back to the balloon to the
balloon you miss
me now he would say hey SPID maybe I can
help you recover those five dragon eggs
there are a couple of Thieves right in
here in a magic crafter's home okay I
know this one let's go to that one
then
stop doing
that oh I fell
off they know that there is
one not this
way cuz there was the flight got fooled
by the mirroring
again there's one
here there we go and now I got
five
oh then I can't show that
[Music]
thing squish the cat gently squish the
cat because if you get if you take the
two yeah you need the two dragon EG for
we that Peak and then you need the two
dragon eggs for the for the magic
crafter's home world uh which is four
eggs and therefore you cannot pick a
single egg for Artisans and after that
he would say say that to find more more
dragon eggs you can go to one of the
levels in the like it would suggest like
Stone heels
or or to square or something like that
and give you a balloon ride
there so you can actually use the
balloon to go to a level and not our
home
world but you can only access that
feature in when you do have very
specific
method there it
is I'm doing this in a very weird
[Music]
way y actually F I
failed
no come
on I can't
missing be
right was did the same same
R my me go so close to
edge trying to save time
here
okay
have fun in the Barrow in the funny
[Music]
Barrow
what may you find some bunny
time
[Music]
okay
so I'm getting so disoriented by this
level at the
moment okay this isn't
good oh wait where am I
going
I'm so disoriented by this
[Music]
level oh there
[Music]
they okay
[Music]
there there it
is can I do this
backwards I'm missing him on
Notch it must be down
[Music]
there we have
you and the last Ares
here there a very weird way of doing it
but it
worked as long as it
works there we go no I don't want to try
again trust me
once for
enough High caves is an interesting
level hi
caves
okay let's go into the
caves don't touch me what in the air
that's I'm cheating
game Run spy run don't just stand
there there we go oh
reu a
y
h
so
oh yeah this won't
work come on
spikes ready at the end of the
level yeah is this game you
can't think you can go yeah go to this
tunnel
easy I inan
cave but you can't go over
here
whoops not when you do
that
that was pretty
high so so get get getting to that place
without charging is will not be possible
in the original version but it will be
possible in to
remake so for the Remake I should
probably right oh you can do that
neat very
wait I'm
going I'm going the wrong
way I don't know where I'm
going good thing you can't die in this
level up here whoa that was
high let's let's get out of here let's
get out of
here like my 236 Gems or whatever it
was and the next level is that
one
I've been very sloppy with collecting
gems which was kind of the
idea in this
level so
apparently
yep excuse
me I'm not going to touch that one
don't for me to fall
off Oran is
back look if you stand here the camera
angles up like
[Music]
this
no bunny Telly in the
restroom well I hope you were like alone
in
there though I don't think that's where
I want to find
one I mean some company while you're in
there
there we go that was a bit scary wasn't
it I don't want comp in
there set up a whole company in your
restro it's your room for resting you're
right shouldn't make opening
there
so
boom it's um 6 minutes left of the
prediction make sure you put in your
points
when will I die the second
time there we
go it's not that rock Rocket Man should
predict Beast makers where the Treetops
level
is oh this are is cleared
off okay
on B encouraging gambling
nah not because because the points are
just fictional points
R is
resued I got to the portal time to jump
in I hope I have enough
to
can get what I
[Music]
need I do have enough to go to the next
World so I did that
again
o take
that and this one should also give an
extra
knife W root
let's keep the B I
didn't maybe I should do the boss
actually let's do the
boss I think I did uh yeah I did every
level in the previous two this one it
didn't do the flight in this one though
and this one so I should probably
probably do the boss here
too yeah
boss yeah still options that are
unpredicted even if you put in just a
single point if your option wins you'll
still you get 100% of the
[Music]
points
oops where is it oh there it
is come head packed
you
and I tacked you
too okay the jams on his
[Music]
side
well
it moves very quickly
up and then I turned left for the
[Music]
dragon I could try all games M too it
doesn't really change much in this game
I feel like just deserves just a few
times
I'm being tricked by the
miroring
I'll the Assassin yeah and then I have
to go this way
otherwise I'm going the wrong way there
you go now I go this
way come
on I flamed
you
really I'm playing B but nothing
happens
I don't think there are any more
enemies there we
go will Le be the first level
100% and now it should be eight
398 400 or
four out of four
gems
yay could me could Mir every
letter that would very confused okay I
need
health I landed on
Lightning okay now we're
can
and the timer is
up Beast
makers what is this call
here someone comes in
and very confused what's going
on what language are you speaking which
language is in this
game so so do Arabic it's English but
written the other way
around oh I got full head already sorry
about
that this is probably my least favorite
world in Spyro one or Spyro in general I
don't know as a world is probably my
least favorite as a
collection but does not contain my least
favorite
11 in the Spyro Trilogy that would be
Seer the least favorite level inpire
franchise that would certainly be Spa
Speedway but we don't talk about that
okay please favorite
game which I probably said before people
say
that where wait where's you kill one the
butterfly
app I forgot that was my goal was to
like play the levels
in almost di
there I forgot I was supposed to play
the level in the
the like the intended main
parts and not take the T Parts on
lat anyway yes let say that SP Fusion or
orange I think I said that last last
stream is people is people say it's the
worst Spy game but but they have not
experienced season of
ice
I do don't know did they have more fun
play playing did they have more fun
playing SP Fusion or SP season of
I I don't
know both are
like spaceage
Speedway yeah I do know season of ice
does contain that
can I go out there I didn't
know okay let's take the main
pa okay one
more here we
go
ta at least my Fusion was
winable that is
true and now the chat is acting
up okay CH chat is working for me
again
and that's kind of why I say that season
of ice is worse
than
yeah fire Fusion just because I could
actually
complete
Fusion
HT
do I can do
this oh there it
is let we have more lives I don't need
them
but oh let's wait one more
come on it was
off well I guess that the thing that was
off was my
timing
Treasures my most favorite world in the
spal trilogy or franchise to not that
many spy games have worlds but is
um the uh the next
world
what step that off that
step yes streamers world is my favorite
world
and lofty
Castle is my favorite
level
excuse
me you were supposed to capture the
Chicken St thing to not C the
chicken yeah he doesn't right to
that was
[Music]
C there we
go clear that
off read it only to eat
yes
the delay on that
ATT
delay on the attack can I destroy this
yes it's still works pick them up
Sparks where am I going this
way
oor
we don't have time to listen to the
dragons
no
h this ain't
good yeah I can't go back
think go
hand died and fell into
water
we
okay I
so forgot what enemies was in here so I
guess that wasn't too tricky actually
this part is going to be the tricky
part I
guess
who get rid of
you
and we have another H here hey you aimed
for that one very
considerate oh at least you avoid it
this
time you're not
coming there we
go
which is something I would have to do
when I do the flame
[Music]
only
well I wonder how how easy it would be
to trick
every bgy to run over every metal enemy
don't have to care about frogs those
I
aboob
aboob there we here that's that pink
that
TW
no I forgot to your
name I'm going the WR
way you got me that time
h

[Music]
way I don't need to save the
game do you
sir do you say
ex
deer can I do
this can res
I yeah I realized it was
rescued that's
[Music]
why
oh that playing is leave for a
[Music]
while okay how do I get out of
here wait they get every
chest yes I
did
good
no I missed the
boat no fly SP
fly there's the
boat
whoa I have to wait for this whole
animation Spike F so sour far he must be
really high up in the sky
now PR know he's going to zoom
back went straight through the
camera yay oh
chest that was
some
lag too bad there aren't any dragon
names a
haruk would be that Mar
ievel what's wrong with okay you're
right screw these levels these levels
are
worst
Oola wait
what you know
it I mean I know
it
oh there you
go ready for Treet tops or
spot
spot and those flight levels are no
match for you mirrored except that that
third
flight which was the second flight I did
was the third
flight
now let's see how mirror Treetops
works that's a speedrun category mirror
and I'm not 100% in
levels that's not
like my whole game play so far has been
like taking the main paths and just
finishing the
levels but I I already proven that I can
100% this level in this remake though
but
sure here comes the worst level no this
is the best
level I
mean the best level is all of the
castle how do you do it I I just play
the game as it's
intended who camera
but do you want me to 100% this level
just to show how easy it
is am I going to regret
[Music]
that am I going to regret saying
that and coming to
eat to too bad I can't have two
prediction going at the same
[Music]
time are
you wait I need to double
check yeah you know
like yeah I need to go
there okay let's
go I'm not really sure where to go
next oh there we
go not problem
ah I did
it can't can't see much about
that I want to see why is this Dam
floating oh there we
go on the safe
Court what that's a switch word for
horny by the way
anyway yay but that's only one out of
two I need to get to the other one as
well oh how can I say such I mean if I'm
speaking English I would say what
but
but if I'm speaking
Swedish
um
whoops that was stupid apparently I
couldn't 100% level because I just
died did anyone win
yes Rocket Man won
again
congratulations shet man I'm
sorry I'm sorry man I just jumped
through a window and just
died I need
to let
me where is the there
I haven't
in
on the
pry and I just need to
[Music]
end
[Music]
go
now
I need to write down what you
people predicted there we go I stupid of
me there we go I died on
PE
I guess I guess I couldn't do
it I guess I was just bragging too
much massive
disappointment
well I will not die
anymore
let's jump off to the correct window
this
time jumped without looking make sure
you look out the window before you
jump it's the one with the
forch because I saw it War
then cuz everything is mirror then it is
supposed to be the right window the
mirror int tricked me
again I know I mean sure it's supposed
to be the second window as well
but that's not what I was thinking about
when I went for
[Music]
it no what
what
well well that didn't
go no one
won
oh I guess this is the way to keep keep
track of H how many times
i'
death
at least you didn't lose point this time
there you
go the the disappointment bun is more
disappointed massive
disappointment okay no more deaths on
this level trust
me this was supposed to be an easy level
I should have just have exited the level
I should not have committed to
this but I really committed to it I mean
I really failed the challenge of not
dying
so so there's
that there we
go got them this
time no test you
sure I
mean I
try no promises
though I'm sure I won't die
[Music]
again prob would that die
again goodbye
Dragon oh look
chests
oh
boom should you should I wanted I wanted
to a mod with accurate level Collision I
wonder if it but that would only be for
a remake I wonder if the Gap is large
enough
to
way I wonder if the Gap is large enough
to let go through in
there okay this is this is starting to
get
silly
this
hydrate P the check yeah I need
that there we go now I'm
ready okay this I actually got
to I wasn't sure if it was going to give
me the
Boost cuz I was juming
[Music]
so
so play sa
there this is Big meic World right yes
this
[Music]
is it is the highest World on the list
because those other worlds have already
completed
as that's what the reason right Beast Oh
I thought I removed Beast Mak I thought
I removed magic Crafters don't V for
magic craft I thought I removed
it like I re added a bit too quickly I
forgot to remove it
cuz it doesn't save the last prediction
unless you actually pick a
result sure I could pick the only only
produced
value so yeah magic should not be
there by so
fire
this isn't going through what what
happen
um this is
uh
oh my oh
my well that
happened hey at least I didn't
die why is the physic so
weird
and this charge
disappeared
okay six St I just count them
now I'm not I'm
not because just doing this is
apparently
very very
weird there we go
finally and there's the second
25 you can
walk they so slow watch up to
him yay finally
okay that means I can actually start it
then
CU for real this
time let me
[Music]
just there you
go gu the tricky part is done now which
was
to get to that
place now for the real pred I've only
died six
times there we go that's safe this time
I wasn't going to make that if I didn't
stop
M I don't know why it's doing that
sometime
[Music]
and
then
boom did did I get a
key yeah I I did get a
key I can check yes there's
key now I should just go and unlock the
chest my
chest
the key to my
chest why can't by just ke the
[Music]
key yeah the the red one has respawned
but doesn't
matter
boom is that everything
doesn't look like
it missed a t somewhere oh
no oh
there there they
are
taada level is
complete almost I can make
that unlocking Pond chest does it grow
then I guess I need my pills so I can
unlock the growing ability of my
chest smirk smirky
face no bulge music
though now there's only it only you got
that Melody yeah it only has the
confirmation that you got every gem it
has nothing for Dragons or
eggs boa Crow
Medicine
Crow hey yes I will take some boa gross
medicine that's not what it's called but
that's what it
does no I touched
again hi hi hello G fish Vibes I didn't
see
you lurking here I didn't see you
there I see did see you take part in the
prediction
that's not
hidden is up kep that
like is this the last
level yeah it
this let's go he's leing on the
side welcome for
[Music]
some or
rips or
rips
had think of what it was it's all wait
there's nothing
there here they
are oh it's back to my regular game play
of kind of doing the main path of level
and oh chest oh
oops I hope you change some good vibes
the the
prediction is now up and is propably
time I'm not sure why I died so many
times
wh
Bo wait a
minute maybe I got yeah I think that's
when it nice it sends the gem to you or
something I think it's something like
that M explosion
camera the camera is more they prefer
the camera being more showing more SP
but but it's fine
actually
let's you change with
the cuz
maybe as the camera is
fine if I'm like controlling camera
myself camera isn't really following
Spire in this game it's actually is an
active camera when it reignited when you
change between active and passive
camera it doesn't really see
anything cuz now the camera is actually
turning when I'm
turning which is what I
want but the difference in reignited is
barely
noticeable let's deal with this
boss there we go
bus is running
away that was
quick oh it's up here oh don't jump down
there in the corner look blue and yellow
very Swedish or Ukrainian
theme maybe
palao
no
this one
left
boom
easy many
gems gems
[Music]
oh my gems oh more gems here JS
everywhere there we go that's every
level
can't oh I have not rescued enough
dragons I need find
more time to go back which level has
like the most dragons
I can
rescue still he there go back to the
first
world
[Music]
yeah I'm to go to Stone
H which for some reason is to the left
of the start still feels really
weird this still means that even if I
would die here that certainly won't
happen I'm still I still only have
reached um a beast makers basically it's
it's it's like how far have I reached
before I die
my current progress is
peacemakers but my goal is to get enough
dragons
[Music]
for no hate wait a minute excuse
me if you don't like noise why are you
here and what be a
noise you silly one
well I he I
hope I hope you have a good time
watching
thisy
anyway oops that's not the way I'm
supposed to go that's where the cave
usually is but now there was water that
could have ended
badly Parks why can't you pick up
keys that doesn't make sense to
me it's the key to being a heavy
suddenly these gems looks
huge
okay let's get some more stuff
here
you got in the
way I want P
hands
wow
w n
do
sir was that all of them
yes let's go to dark col
yay let's see it should be the left one
this
time normally the right one no it's the
middle
one is the middle
one and then it's to the left not to
right
could have 100% it sure
but that's not a girl at the moment I've
been too lazy about collecting
dragons and a Dark Hollow is
here I'm glad I could actually find
a that they actually have filters SP but
um where is the
thing sorry if I don't keep track of
one when add a plane which is a bit bad
at telling
me Oh there's a gem
oh here we
[Music]
go
who and here's the
Dragon
n
du that's so quick at
reading text like that I'm not used to
those
words the pum isn't the easiest to read
either anyway
I guess I kill 100% this level
because
boom got to clear off that
area yeah I got eight more gems it
should be on these two platforms
here this
platform
[Music]
go and then two more gems which is the
two on the other
platform
y didn't I did that last time
too should Pro press this button to
land yeah and then just skip all that
like and then okay okay okay okay I I
I'll do deal with this
one how deal with this ass
pist

level let's through that tunnel
there and that's not how
CES these

what
so yeah there's a dragon up
there let's go to the
dragon I guess I can un this level

you

11 F thank

different
rules I don't know if I've seen that
happen I'm also not sure if he I've been
able to to charge uh one of those metal
ones when they grown

[Music]
Homeland

area it seems to be such a CO
area oh
no no can get
that good look at a
f keep doing

to need
[Music]
it and of course here is the only Red
Ring
box

dumb got the
crown what a
fool
to
another one
spares eat yourself full
of
[Music]
butterflies no
wait H that's not safe Ground St
on I yeah the music does not Loop in
this game it fades out and start
over but that's an idea for mod forit
make make all water solid make all Water
Ice
oh they going the other way around now I
wonder
why I defin whoops as I was going to say
I definitely definitely feel more tired
now and I guess that's true he's fell
into the
water water equals ice how will SPID
swim into threee you
[Music]
don't Inspire one is easy
but while yeah inspire two and three I
guess you
will just all the gems that are in the
water is moved up on top of the ice
there we go are you happy
now is
that as same it's eggs and whatever else
you need to
collect all of it is placed on top of
the hey I got
pushed
s that
[Music]
one tries to kick
me yeah I'm going to
wait I've done this two
l
how I supposed to go
[Music]
ah supposed to get
here guess here is the
bus
sequel I know it's not an L it's a j but
it was to say squel
seai
zage
zage there we go that's that's the name
of the boss
now
come
maybe that is a word
already which way am I supposed to
go not this
way
almost of course Inspire three some of
the
levels yeah yeah now it alerts me about
enough coming finally it's play three
there are one world which is mostly just
water where you have to go underwater
to to access the levels but I guess in
that
case they can be a hole in the
ice a hole in the
ice he's by this would be a crack to
destroy give me
oh do I need to jump up to get
it hey you run through my
Flames
almost
almost I think this is the only boss
battle with health in
it
fan
raid welcome fan and fans of
fan welcome
to very weird SP game the game weird but
this this run of the game is very
weird hello hello
everyone and H maybe I should have I
don't
know hey thank you for following
comfortably
um
so
so
F oh yeah uh yes you playing for did did
did take a very quick look at you
playing there before I decided to play
on my
own I felt like doing that so but how
did it did you get any first
places
I I requested no I didn't
request I if that sounded better or
worse p
p hello
F yes we got the grand total of
one one first place why did
you cuz I don't exactly know how to
because what I've heard is that if you
play solo you're playing against 99
other players or something and then you
have to get first why don't have to fly
down all the way and now we turn to the
right to reach the balloon because it's
it's all
MD yes one win but if you play as a team
you wouldn't be like solo first place
you would be first place as a
team Ro s
song wasn't it North Nexus or was that
Chang in the
remake do it says nasis SW I don't I
don't know what's it called North Nexus
in the north
verion oh the home world is called North
Nexus every other one is just called
home I see what's going on here home
home home home home nor
Nexus
when oh another
one
so but sorry sorry I was distracted by
the
game eyes ATT 10 to me H yes 100 players
no matter amount of people but I assume
the rules of how how you win so it's
could be different but yeah you okay but
um I
hope I don't know I've seen like
respawning recovering or something like
that when you're like teammates but I
don't
know maybe I should Play fortnite
Someday but I hope
every I didn't mean that to happen but I
hope everything else is okay I hope you
feel
good and
uh and
stuff how Spyro I play the remaster love
it I do have the remaster too uh but but
the PS1 I'm playing PS1 version because
I can do the uh screen
mirroring I wouldn't know how to do that
inake but I do I do plan on playing the
Remake and do the uh I do a run without
charging and see how far I can
get and see how many hurdles there
are
oh this version I think yeah in this
version you can stand on top of
that
um I'm just messing around in levels two
and I haven't I haven't barely 100% in
any
level I've only rescued 59 dragons and
I've re rescued two
dragons
that
was you can also do
this
oops see underwear is fine in the
game
anyway
all oh he decided to not grab it after
it started making a strange noise but he
decided to just stand next to
it h nice are you playing mirror for an
added challenge yeah I play this game
too much I guess I guess to add the
challenge I wanted to see how much how
how confused I would be and how many
mistakes I've done a few mistakes of
which which of one led to my death just
simply based on their
miror because I jumped through the wrong
place but uh it really
hasn't it wasn't much of a like I
thought it would be much different I
mean there are moments I do get confused
but I really thought it would be more
confusing yeah I'm
not it's not my sh challenge for fun
well
yes oh any need now it lies down like
this now we
can I
think but no because to come to because
this enemy is the only enemy in this
level oh then destroyed the okay
okay this that enemy is the only enemy
you
can't
kill in this level when you do without
flame
anyway yeah
I might have played this game too
much I wonder if they say that's why I
also done the
like the when I did no
flame cuz it
actually it also makes the game not
possible to 100%
which I wish wasn't a limitation
but what can you
do now let's
see this is the way
out yeah in this version it just stand
too close it doesn't bring up a new one
which is convenient if you want to jump
over wear not being pushed to the side
or
something but I wish it
could there you
go
ta
exit and you have to enter the
exit it says
ammo and Ro on
the so the first head does not open if
the dragon is not
rescued we could have put the first head
but hey
Ned wait yeah now the first one
opens wait that that means
that yeah I want to rescue Three
Dragons so I had six0 okay so yes six0
dragons SP I had before entering this
place
so let's see if we can do this
level and hopefully I can
do okay let's be pick up these as
well W take it easy you can hit someone
with
that and we wouldn't like that would
we wait the enemy has
disappeared
I think I touched the enemy but then the
enemies are just
gone just gone and not
even it didn't even disappear in a proof
of
smoke like
that whoa I ran between the two
bullets
go can he
no apparently
not I wonder every
cutie
Cutie Oh no I got
hit I have L counter how many times have
got
hit all it's too many hold those
CL
okay almost falling down
you and
you oh I got
close nice
nice here we go
makit 32 times so f have you kept count
or is just are you just making it up and
do you count deaths from falling down as
taking damage
boink I want to see if I can do this
without picking up a single gem I can do
nasty nor without dying
okay without taking
damage I count a long time
ago well here come here it
comes
ready I'm just going to snooze
the yes they don't come up during the
battle
well let's see how well this goes in
here already already missed the
T
[Music]
huh I'm running past the
thief too quick what count number of
deaths no number of the hurts her is
number of test is six I
I
[Music]
think okay there we go that's what I
wanted to
do wait w that was close this one goes
[Music]
here licking Burger those egg SE are
annoying wait you ran the wrong wait
what happened excuse
me
I think I I think
I bager for princess pon
pon I do like me some good
burger there you go where's the safe
there's the
safe there we
go Thief has been taken care of
pineapple
B yes
sir welcome
pe oh yo steart cop soundtrack slaps
hard you like it other people like this
sound
okay let's
uh pick up the gems while I'm while
while I'm
here and I didn't I don't think I missed
any there hopefully I got every
gem otherwise I think I should revisit
the level pick up the single Gem and
then exit
[Music]
level
I haven't used exit level from the menu
yet
so he's spread out his stretch all over
the
place he's not very
careful wouldn't look funny if this is
the I I ran across the Gap there and
felt like was falling down
down
apparently you could jump
T that happened I died too
nice wait there's no winners no one PR
this would happen okay everyone is a
loser that means that
J Aran are getting your points back
that's how kind I am
I don't like it when points are
disappearing
[Music]
without come on
here no that's not a way to
capure
there col can get some chores done okay
that sounds good whoa am I
loser am I loser
baby great it's h oh I miss the
gem there we
go it's that
key you Los I got your points
back
okay let's see if I can do
this without falling off
who look it's this section from C3
racing I'm almost
clicky excuse me excuse me that that's
not
allowed that was very
rude there you
go how
rude dropped down like that
you stand still for so
long it just feels so
weird you're to
you're toast snork I did it I made a
mistake but got took so long I kind of
forgot about you what about gasty gor
gasty gor is defeated his toast so now
there's order again in the dragon
Kingdom well mostly I still got some
treasure to pick up what will you do
next I'd say this guy's the
limit
right it's
time and ads for all the
subscribers unsubscribers probably that
nonsubscribers
so I completed the nasty nor
challenge I got I don't think that was a
challenge I completed the mirror
challenge that's more of a chall actual
challenge
KY you already cute
mom for coming coming in here and
spending time with me I've been going
for 3 hours
actually and I said I was going to get
tired so actually doing a
full what
is why did it take kind of longer time
to do like
because I think I completed this game in
maybe I did like a 4our stream when I
did play SP the first time because I
have completed this H game 100% in one
stream
so I could probably go back and pick up
some gems I'm not that
tired
so
credits dragons is voiced by these
people whose names are
[Music]
M yeah
do
[Music]
what I didn't I didn't mean to something
like
that
so
H that's the credits of returning home I
mean a
more this is not home this is now work
Nexus
so Michael go I know him or personally
he voices some characters in Skyrim such
as J balro he is also oson Sal in
original Resident Evil 4 I assume it
is so credits are over let's see how
much I bother presenting game then
sunam
66 Alo 63
rescued so now I'll start
collecting the gems in this level I
it so yeah if because I know I know
there are those who want to get every
gem in the home world before they start
any
level and then when it get to a level
they 100% a level this does mean that
their gem counter will always be a even
100 except for this world
oh we one
there and then the
remaining I see the balloon is to the
side so you can get those STS they don't
need to put the G there in the first
place but in the reunited the balloonist
is centered meaning that you are going
to forc to talk to the balloonist as you
try to pick up the
ch
which is annoying some people so yes if
you want
to keep your even 100 you have to avoid
picking up any gem in the whole
world
well I guess I'll clear up
these levels
then
like like Le and not that's a good
level
and I
hope so the area I have to go to is the
upper
area that's the one I haven't cleared
out
yet going the wrong way getting food by
me okay I got this this
one I think I was briefly up
here
there have more gems up here I need to
pick
up the music of this level is
interesting this
all accessing this
area oh there's a chest come
here come
here yeah fin wait this was one of those
I got before
oh there go that's the
one so back collecting gems I don't have
many gems left I
think went around ding
sheep
poofing away yeah should be some js up
here no
here three more here you go one and a
two and there you go 200 over
200 W
W could have done that but last time I
was here
yeah but I
didn't
oops there we go
so I also got this
flight this is something it doesn't do
or originally does it it does it do
this
after you defeat
nasor or after you speak to the dragon
and maybe it's after you defeat n
oops bunny
flight that's the thing it does in
reignited but reignited does it from the
start and not because I didn't even know
that was a thing because I I haven't
ignored that flight before can I do
these flights my normal on
[Music]
wi swims
time because the nors are falling into
the
water
because he because in the sunny
weather a swimsuit can be
nice
oh nothing doing so
great I keep missing them
there we
go why does twitch has a TR St
chat
my chat thing on in
this you know it's exactly
word why I'm doing this mirror is
apparently
not this
Dragon I was seeing that because I'm so
used to do this level H normally that
doing this mirror would be a
huge I mean I I yeah I did the last part
mirrored from what I usually do because
I usually go around that lap around but
un
mired
but apparently they didn't do much
inan in the end it doesn't really matter
anyway but yeah I think I know
lost on and then I think that's not the
the
CES there the gems
are
taada and I think I have 100% of this
wor now all dragons wait a minute toast
isn't complete
yet where's toasty in
here a bit
slightly
go didn't slightly confused about where
to
go there's a
[Music]
gem
then there's this
segment that's s what he says there we
go 100% 100 of Mir pon pon is poor SP
not a challenge anymore I mean arguably
Mir is not a
challenge
welcome nice to see you
here doing I'm trying to think
of
ideas do I only get one and not three of
them time to become a speed Runner I
have been thinking about speed running
like yeah
crash 3
remake but when I have a better
Computing and if if that something
interesting time to move two
peacekeepers So currently I'm just 100%
in the levels I didn't T them
before like back in the childhood when I
is cleared just reached the exit and
left without time presenting it and then
I had to go back he definitely
should I I
yeah I would like
to I would
love of course of course love if you did
too be right back okay
Peach
I do want
to have a mod for reignited which I
mentioned
before why did I not pick this
up oh you missed me uh which mirrors the
camera view but does not affect the
UI that and I think that could help me
um help me actually opposite that that
would help making it more confused
because the UI is correct but the camera
is
wrong
Boom the only thing is the level portal
names but that could be
resolved by having the text printed in
the reverse
order and then mirroring
every this
way
waa and mirroring every
CTIC incredible Glide
Spyro standing on oh
no doing
everything no
sword I should charge I should continue
to
[Music]
charge
well where am we
going
here nope apparent not
website did say it'll take anyway from 7
to 14 days half the time will just be
them not sending
it why did I do
that okay this is just for edit
Challenge and and toally not because I
messed
up
it's only been two days 3 days since I
ordered
it two days or three
days and of course uh work days would be
the one that
counts no I died seventh
death SP e
there we go that's what I
wanted I try to avoid it but oh CH
again there you go now start
attacking get
away
I wonder if they make their swords to
order which would mean it doesn't exist
yet so there is no sort to S yeah I mean
in that
case that would take time before they
start shipping it that would be pretty
neat
too I'm going I was I'm supposed to go
this way tried to go to the other place
but the mirroring confused me
when a mirroring is more of an
inconvenience than a
challenge I do have a key wait I don't
have the key wait didn't I pick up the
key oh no I didn't go back and pick up
the key
then
[Music]
there it
[Music]
is kill the bunnies I don't know if
those are
bunnies oh there's a SE
here come I
safe yep someone got
way disappeared in a cloud of
smoke why is this thief so quick every
other Thief has been so
slow and this thief is very
quick catching up
down here we
go and the thing with SP Flame
that is stuck to his head so if you
flame and then
charge the flame moves forward long no
with
him which is kind of
weird I wouldn't mind learning how to
make swords that would be
interesting custom swords or chain mail
what am I that sounds like got lot of
work I don't know where I'm
going sometimes it feels like a level I
haven't played before but sometimes it's
feel it's like the most of the time is
the level I
play it's SP
randomizing K of that
area oh yeah it was this
area I got confused by miring again
[Music]
this was here I wanted to
[Music]
go oh that was
close
so uh of the two CH ma is easier to make
I guess I guess so I
mean I guess that's true
yeah wait I need to go this
way
yeah this this place is very confusing
M I know how to build that Forge those
are easy
oh well if you say
so no
spiral why are you doing
this there we go
now now there's there's that's
everything ignoring strange noises this
made are you sure you're not
that who said he
wasn't
no doesn't
matter Cliff
town now what
fil fil that
sounds
weird wait I already defeated these what
I need to do
is move to the end of
level or day Thief come thief or chest
nice come here
Thief oh so close so
close come on SP use your use your
abilities
have why you using
[Music]
that
there you go
finally okay I
think now that's wait wait yeah that's
cleared
out cleared
out well I do have a beard right now
yeah
well I do
even
okay every dwarf has a beard even female
dwarfs that's guitar
TW hello uned

Forever Until It Stars this
anyway a bird got in the
way hey
what
what what was that good
for and this one gives me the
Whirlwind God I love this music yeah
been lurking and
joying
original I hope I'm
not really by talking of
it
I hope it's enjoyable
regardless I think I used the
music yeah
there there there
more
[Music]
chests this 400 in this level
so that's 3y more and I know where they
[Music]
are over
here if I understood it
correctly let me get the
checkpoint
k
I if that that death counts because I
wanted to test that
no why DW prefer access whereas I like
swords but there must be dwars at
swords
there we
go let took one
this did I oh this
more did I get
everything who 400 out of
400 I used exit level Vortex every time
so I'll keep doing
it yay more PS one Spyro
hello
welcome yes but something is a bit
different from this
PS1 wait what you say PS1 Spyro yes
something slightly
different might be hard to
tell wait I'm I'm forgetting about the
level I'm a bit disoriented
here that's a very red po
po just just completely
round different I don't see you don't
see anything
different do you remember this level do
you remember how you turn right to this
enemy
here
wish I don't know if you levels that
exactly
who is sp no no it's a far
Spyro
and
well
is it the text of it off yeah like the
how the the gem Camp there on the right
looks slightly bit
of let me unlock these
chests so we'll
see
and doesn't the level feel a bit off as
well here it
comes wait I can't use this as a
shortcut PA would also work I mean yeah
I can bring up the pause
menu they go that's the PO Min the many
of
course which we
have as
bunnies oh no it flew past me come
on
for menu yes and how you go to the right
of this thing and jump across it to the
left that's exactly how I mean I I know
this is Tiny
DET are been playing this game so
[Music]
much for pon pon I'm back and I went up
to the store and got myself a soda it's
Mountain Dew I never had a Mountain Dew
I think there might be available here
but the recipe might be different
because the original recipe might be
illegal alternative not illegal but uh H
there's also the sugar
attack and that's the sugar attack is
simply for health
reasons and um I do appreciate it
because I I do appreciate having less
sugar in
food which encourages companies to
reduce the amount of sugar there I mean
there are still product without the
sugar
in still have the option and then you
can just buy sugar if you want it I
don't think that's how it works
but if you want sugar in your bread
again anyway I hope you enjoyed your
Mountain Dew while watching some pon pon
gamep playay 10 more dragons to
find there we go every gem found there
there that's it I went the wrong
way
believe has been quiet for four minutes
now so that
level done no no
yay and the final level come on
spy come on spy don't get
stuck m
rot Cod rot
Cod just oh there we go I did not pick
up
these one of
these that crazy when it runs up they
got different colors of mountain the is
the
famous roon
yes that will make sense that they have
different
players I want to know about one
though which I think is a
[Music]
green B blast is best
flavor oh is
that okay I did
it oh for some reason they the enemies
didn't
die
interesting until I get got
close you can jump over and get those
but oh I have to defeat Dr shamp
again but I
was I forgot he was swinging around this
club so much I thought he was going to
attack
immediately oh well I have to do the
rest without taking damag
them
it's a smoking
butt
wao
yes
well it would be something to try
yes import it
wait there defeat well oh at least you
put me back on the other
platform there you go is this the last
one yes 300 there's
300 can I
wait no I can't I have to go

complete let's
see is this
here
bunnies I
think yeah I'm missing a dragon here and
hold
egg up

didn't
know a lot of treas in
here there
everything whoa wait I need to go this

different language for my original
language oh oh you jump down
okay so that area
cleared and then
and now I need to go this
way

damage that could be an idea I only
allowed to take a certain amount of
damage I missed
something
don't know what it is but it feels like
I miss
something apparently
not
okay
[Music]
go yes then there the other area after
and then there's this area
too

up so this area that level
done
maybe I
picked I picked up the
Sims crunch R oh the dress is
back dress is back what high
CES which way do I want to go this
way
go
enough oh no the enemy wasn't there
anymore to stop the whirlwinds from
hitting
Spyro when I come CH when I do the CH
for not charging I have to utilize those
places where I can step off to this
side round round
round that's that's what the the bunny
says
ra
anyway yeah then
there I did clear off this
side poof poof but know when I I didn't
care off that look at the
treasure I am very familiar with this
level because I
but I'm very familiar with level but I'm
not familiar with it being
mirrored we go that's that
seed why are the seed so
easy I
mean
not not not like they do feel harder in
rain I
did okay cuz that that's just I was just
like I
wasn't sound like I'm trying to
break that was barely an effort is what
I'm going say I was just running
straight towards it and then like got
kind caught
up hello spamy how are you how have you
been pon pon I've been very anxious
about selling the house
but which I've been talking about a few
times yeah it's lot for me to
hand all
alone that's basically how I've
been
some oh standing on the ins side
there relaxing with some
spal thing I'm not so confusing
version
playing a not so confusing
variant yeah Selling Houses is always
scary
yeah it's worried about how the whole
process is going to work out if
I someone even offers a good amount I
gu
here we
go ignore
me and then I I could use the superch
charge for
wait and the mirroring tricks me again I
think everything will be fine though I
really hope
so there
okay there we are oh my super shot is
gone I wanted to turn around
and do a nice trick
okay let's get the super flame oh it's
this one here have you got a new home
line up I'm going
to move back to my parents for the time
being and then get a home after that one
step at a
time and
here there we go final
gem oh nice smart it does help me a
lot it makes it a bit more
convenient wish I could do
that yeah
I just said oh that not an option for
did I get there thing
yes
not an option for
everyone cost of living is slowly
destroyed by
sanity
yep that's kind of why I'm moving in the
first
place Wizard
Peak that's not a way to
go who by the
mirror
so this level you do
here
then I think it's around
[Music]
yes what
did get out of my
way
no this
way jumping around
blind as long as I don't do like a
double mirroring when I try to think of
where to
go I go be so confused when I play this
normally
see here no there's bounc him because
it's
[Music]
fun and there we
go W 400 that's enough
this level is
500 the whole other area not done
yet wait it's this
way oh now
it's well actually hope everything works
out amazing for you and you get a lot
more money than you hoped for yeah I
really that would be very
convenient
still don't believe that I will
but
[Music]
but sure would be
nice I miss these
chance stop
that what is this pon pon the fer pon
pon with swords
she's
she's she's
going oh no I died he's going
Elemental I mean it

really really confusing me
asno think you should be enough with for
r that pain
at there we
go get it fu
and of
course there we
go nothing more there this might be the
remaining
CH CU it's very close to 500
[Music]

the last one 500 out of
500 I can
do have you played the remastered
version
yep even on stream on stream I did the
um hey I'm above don't do that that's
how we take them out oh there's a sec oh
wa he doesn't have an EG does he
no that's how we take them out if you
want to do it without FL which is the
uh which was what my prited the remaster
run was doing without
flame and it went pretty
well I completed the game so
I defeat n which was the goal and why
did I do
that and because that I had to start
over from the
start wait what do I have left every
level is
done it's just a home world
now I need to get a
key
[Music]
I love it so much I've done it 100% on
Playstation PC and then
started 100% a second
time yeah I don't know how many times

chest which
contain wait yes 10 10

switch too got it on

looking for the word flipped yes it is
flipped
horizontally what what made this what
what was the thing that made you realize
[Music]
it
it has been flipped this whole time
that's why people try to say like look
at the text and
stuff all the text ising
backwards
yeah yeah if we if I could
just I I I I I've said said many
times if I could just flip the camera
and not the UI which I hope which I
really want to do as a mod for
ignited and the uh that wouldn't make it
as obvious that it's
we cuz everything really is
normal well come on
you can do
sp okay one cycle

to yeah I have Chen okay let's let's
free you
but then also let's free the
butterfly flies of the
but
but now let's see can I do this part
without
dying I did get every enemy
so there you
go no manad thanks for releasing me it
seems like I've been trapped in here
since I was your age well yours are
wrong yeah what I say you were trapped
in like 4 hours
ago what can I say but you're
wrong overly dramatic
Dragon so there was that area but flies
I never seen a butt fly let's be
Hest but I guess that's an idea
for
safe up
here okay I'm going to fly over and here
we
go
okay hopefully these are the last
attemps I do not forget any
anyway that would be annoying
no
no I should have Pi up the
checkpoint I Le got I got that
checkpoint at
least stop licking
me stop head butting me I guess that's
not licking
but I turn
down okay let's
take one please there we
[Music]
go that's not how we
fly qu
jump the idea I had was having
a I don't know uh an outfit for pom pon
with a butterfly on her butt so you get
a butt butterfly but but you wouldn't be
able to see that anyway because that
would be behind on the back
side 4 five five I
don't okay okay those kind of high
Valu so okay
that might be
it
home
500 I'm getting confused now I think
it's down here yeah there it
is
yes get over the pool of
water but
mentioned yes
but
yes all of the butts talk about the
butts butts butts
butt
oops oh yeah I need a key and
[Music]
stuff
so sadly ads has to play but that's
that's out which works hope everyone who
gets ads can survive them and will be
back wa the next
level I'll just gather the remaining
gems from this
level
po that's a lot of
GS B almost dead okay I
understand
so okay that took 7 Seconds to complete
I waited expected to like take like
in
there so yeah I said any outfit you can
come up with let me just check someone
has written to me on
Discord
[Music]
oh
okay
so that's
it that will yeah I need to find some
someone must have done like reference
images for what's it what's the even the
flame let me check spidal one flame
flame power fairy
no not exactly what I'm looking
for there's one picture
here maybe I have to get my own
pictures that might be what I had to do
I cannot get any good pictures from
online not not by quick startch
and at that point I
can
so
ready oh must
electrified so
um I didn't mean to do
that sorry sorry I uh it's next
level just messing around a
bit by
head they L
them let's go
and finish up this level there's not
many gems left on this
level go it's still Al 40 of
them let's see the it's not that
one this it's going to be very confusing
to
find oh
ow there it
is it wasn't too confusing to
find the camera does not want to follow
along
SP
well
400 oh it's 500 gems in this
level I'm obvious not done because I
know it
is I
got
than f one more
training start with the
key let's go and unlock the
chest oh was just a
chicken that's thought it was a
chest
how running to the side isn't that
useful do I need to beat the boss again
yeah wait how did I no it
was
thank
you here we
go and just a single
orb time to unlock the
chest well good see it
wasn't drown anything thing there come
on Spire you can do
it and
yes and a lot of
GS it should be
[Music]
one okay now complete let me just go
back and check one
thing look at
this if you want to farm
orbs I guess this is the level to do it
in
like here probably most of
them here we
go wrong
way
go that should be every level of this
world
hooray where is my house oh two of them
good I do want full
hands care full
hands
YK dream
Weavers back to my favorite
world let's name it to Pon P pun's
Favorite
world what strange name of a
level also um so I'm pressing left I'm
pressing right even this whole menu is
right to left at the moment we got every
AK I can see on the count as it
up when
guess shall just go through level by
level
again I hope everyone has a good
time oh
no yeah if
it stop that if it work like the is uh
increasing decreasing
scale wait they are increasing
scale if it worked like the other the
home world that one would
have oh I fre into the
arrow
conr
but yeah I do have
that I do have that new uh redeem that
no one has used
[Music]
yet no one is brave enough to use
it can I reach that from
here let's take a checkpoint
first oh
my just slipped
off yes and I think that might been
intended way to get
here
okay there was I keep forgetting that
there's nothing up there there's a way
back to
[Music]
there I don't know what ask yeah I
understand it was mostly to like
encourage people like to Lear like to
ask something
random the the idea was basically to
like that want oh yeah I'm supposed to
go down here is very not clear about
that
hey big I'm so much damage at moment
because people might uh yeah
yeah feel more it nice it being more
justified by paying have Chanel
pointsa even
though it it might mentally feel
better you shot so
quickly
shoting
sh
nice so
yeah guess that's it
basically people might feel braver
asking a question when I'm paying for
the
[Music]
question but you don't have
to maybe I should like Mark the
different thems or like Mark
the mark the option on Redmon cuz you
don't need to redeem the question to ask
a
question which is something I've said
like before that I don't have redeems
for for certain things because you can
just ask me
stuff but
yeah or at least knowing the options AV
yeah that
too some things you do have to use the
redeems which is the outfit changing
because it's tied to the
redeem I haven't set it up I mean sure I
could go in and do the redeem to when I
do
have hand change change the outfit but
is still have it set up that
uh it's not uh it's not put need in the
que so whenever the one item in the
queue runs out it
will it will it will change the outfit
anyway and me forcing that to change
doesn't affect the C if that makes
sense how is this not everything where
have I
[Music]
missed
apparently missed
[Music]
something now see gems and
start but yes swim
SE in a dark
and dark
level that's when it put on your
s I'm pon pon wearing swims in most
weird
situations
stop
it
h i missed
20 must have missed a chest there
something in the alternative
part okay let
me let me go through this area
[Music]
again yes here
they
wait which which this
way return
home whoa another level
complete 12,000 is the or or ser 0 0 2
1 that's the count can we
say and then let's go back to lock the
castle the best level in the game if you
ask
me miss the
portal
so yeah I'm doing this
again oh yeah it's this area didn't
it
explosions get out the
[Music]
way and then there is the what I se the
cost
[Music]
I'm
trying trying to
play oh no spark is
gone oh Sparks is
back enemy at
[Music]
Sparks
okay can reach that from
[Music]
ground and when you pop these enemies
balloons they fall down but that doesn't
make any
sense that's not what I wanted to
do trust me I did not want
[Music]
to okay so you cannot flame while you I
wanted to C tou so yeah while you're
dropping you cannot
flame good to
know there we go that's what I wanted to
see
I gu I guess the enemy lands on his back
and then he dies from
that I saw I Mr a gem and then I sto I
stop L
fellow
there now I can
proceed
nice landed here in the end
and there's a dragon and there's the
key
Inu
Inu I was going
to yeah this is the super
charge oh yeah go around like this
and fly
[Music]
whoa and then there's
this it says
everything
wait I didn't rescue those pH did I I
don't remember
doing oh wait it remembers which pH I
rescued I'm going the wrong
way so yeah it does remember which pH I
forgot forgot I thought the level will
reset why does some elements reset in a
level but not all so the rescued par
does not
reset
oh I
[Music]
knife
[Music]
exit
yay
celebration short saving is
complicated but I mean it
can
no because
um I mean I guess of savings complet but
but what I mean
is it remembers which enemies you have
got
the gems from
so but he can save each in each indiv
wait I need to oh too late now each
individual H
Jem
or exactly so it did just add
like it does save but I gu is
complicated I guess you're not WR
about
11,10
gems yeah I should pick up
one 1,1
gems
okay
ohif
I mean sure should that's some way to
die it could be that the gem are index
and it does not remember the eny it to
drop the gem but the I mean
yeah when they could have I mean I'm I'm
not saying that the enemy I mean the
enemies come back but I mean
like like in this level the doors are
still
locked
[Music]
let's
go
anyway I need this
think I don't need
this is this where that's where I want
to
go so the second
[Music]
door let's see if I can do
this oh
no
[Music]
and after exit I need to turn
right let to double check normally left
but I need to remember it should be
right this time let's see if I can deal
with no
no music pain
out and
[Music]
start yes I see
that waa that's
high almost get up there
now it's this
way one more
dragon and that should be in
the Z level could remember what I said
before run no don't don't hit the
wall you were so
[Music]
close Okay one more
try these are the only one that falls
asleep again I mean otherwise it would
be very annoying if he fail
this minute no no I hit the wall
again
ah could me this
hard come SPID
[Music]
come there we
go where's the yellow
fairy yellow
fairy makes fire red
indefinitely yep
but it does
not cause those to instantly explode oh
yeah I need to open
the this one is on other side for some
reason what oh yeah yeah
what do I have
left Del
that resc get
that didn't I clear off
this oh yeah I think I know what it is
this kill ever
SE your magic was not quicking
at hello
[Music]
magic yeah my might be some of these I
have
not I think I got one of
them no no no
[Music]
no
no no I lost my fairy
paway oh no not disappointed
funny she doesn't know what to
think she doesn't have the Mental Cap
capability to judge me
boom it wasn't for
that
thing okay
so yeah everything should be gone here
because I already got rid of
it and a checkpoint remembers
that
I need your
help okay in that case I will keep this
checkpoint CU this checkpoint ensures I
can get the fire power
back okay where where is I where would I
go
here now this one are
out that's back
[Music]
here why takes so long before he starts
fir after doing the
drop now that area is cleared
off it must be here yeah I don't think I
went back here yeah here we go 10 and
this should be
fine five there you go 500 500
woo wrong
way that's normally the way
but
celebration no more disappointed
bunny which I used have just said that
she doesn't have the capability to be
disappointed now it should be this door
the man go to the enemy already
defeated FAL bunnies do not eat
pizzas 11 one
52 I'm missing one gem in this are wait
I'm not missing one I'm missing 101
gems uh but every level except
sea
SE so I need to get to
that and I also not on the flight level
so I need to go and get the
flight
long stream
today compensating for every stream I've
not done
before I skipped out
though get out of way Dead
Bunny it's fun doing that you're not
supposed to but they must have May that
intentionally or something I don't
know like
a compromise that did just turn big he
shouldn't fail do today but I haven't
added it to many of the
[Music]
other wait everything's mired how
come this version of the game requires
you to be more accurate there also helps
because one of these doesn't over right
the other one which it does sometimes
ined which is
annoying I'm going to turn left
instead and then re
it
[Music]
anyway
[Music]
with a lower po count it does make that
platform easier to spot and realize
you're supposed
[Music]
to stand there the high quality in
R 300 yes High the higher poly version
of the platform in Dr does not make it
as clear
so wait I was I was doing a quick
hydrate and try
[Music]
again so the first one does not
count well
[Music]
man I guess not the most
optimal can I need no need to turn right
I
think
yes
nice timing with here train there oh two
trains no
no got too excited about the
trains oh that
CH
side well that was an attempt for a
first first try I didn't I fell into the
water disappointed that pizza did you
make no that was a rude
joke now I didn't see the train now I
can now now I know I should come
here I want to make pizza
myself and put I don't remember what I
said I wanted to put on the
pizza
no I
W one more head
cop 20 seconds to
spare no that's what you want that's not
what I
want this silly
one exit Lev in
my yay like third TR or
something was like a quick restart there
if you want to count that otherwise two
tries no that's not
way you have
one
no
Sage there we go that's that's what it
says a raw sexy bunny oh
my ow
Ruess hit wait oh yeah I can
C
the now
when what's what's a raw sexy bunny
by I mean I guess I'm Raw because I'm
not
cooking yes right this
time
AO there
fin
this yeah but yeah I
guess
no
no tricky
jump thought I did that jump nicely
butar apparently the game wasn't
satisfying
there we go that was very close paining
again
though what do you
get I don't know where is this
conversation
going that I'm a raw six
bunny
but I I
don't oh that's a
thing I I just confused about the wrong
part
[Music]
wrong well I got
one
there
you care for the way of doing
it
Romy you don't go to the pizza open and
get I mean yes yes that is
true I not cooked I'm supposed to go
here but this it's just that this place
looks a weird mirror it does not look
like the place I'm supposed to go
to like I don't recognize the
place
going to say they didn't miss S
no hey
what
the when when runs out the other one
runs out that's
one doing a
hand
whoa me if I hit the the enemy I don't
know if counts this
enemy if I had hit the clock guy the
clock boy there that would have resulted
in me falling off but then I failed
anyway how many times am I going to die
just
here the way this song
restarts how's that not the success
I want to enjoy my sexy bunny Al that's
fine okay this is this is getting really
GL
no don't turn it
around how how precise is
this here
finally
so oh look an extra life I can get my
keep
ke as soon as you pick up something at
me okay to keep
yeah yes to keep
it they say is our final gems it looks
like
it 500 out of
500 this is probably we is most
oh and right I need to jump on this then
this and then no platforming all the way
over here because could I made
platforming
no and then you get nothing who and then
I didn't
jump ah
you get nothing or I no I didn't get no
I didn't hear sound or I didn't see the
live count up here just

that
what not where I wanted to go but it
worked
and then you have a barrel on this side
in case you for some reason appear you H
happen to be on the
inside with them blocking you
away there an interesting F
safe well I assume that's what what it's
for I don't see what else it would be
for
look is that every
time now this is yes 4 400
w
yeah it worked the explosion managed to
hit
it yay
celebrations all the
celebrations celebration sharing and
feral p in there being the most excited
there she can't contain herself with all
the
excitement I think 100% the nasty nor

so
I
think there we
go exra help I take that oh
another the light
but so many extra lives I lost I'll take
that
too is that
everything wo
12,000
celebration I do the bonus
now let me save the game Let's oh no now
what's what's it
doing no nothing it's fine yeah it's
what yeah it had issu streaming when it
was
seeing
let's let's take
a short ad break because otherwise
you're going to play ads during the
bonus I must play the ads now
so
Evas
but here we go the tool
of
sang the G the tools of a
gang I think this portal plac in a deep
T in
there
it portal are kind of weird how
they they
work can
I there a back side I didn't expect it
to an actual be an actual backside here
it's
interesting that's very
interesting
whoopsy oopsy
oopsie let me get my health
back GRS where are you wait where are
all the Reds supposed to be many RS
here now the rest are again wait what
was
[Music]
that ah that that that low poly
head not exactly sure why they even have
you can't you can't even get far enough
from these to make
po well I guess there's no more headon
um dang would would
it would it have been open before uh
this level is always
open the other three that you have to
unlock and I'm pretty sure you can't get
on the back side of
these
you can can I get like inside them
through
glitch glitching through
them that's I have this game saved so if
I want to replay the loot level I can
just replay the loot
level not oh
oh the uh glitching through the heads is
a trick used to uh complete the game
with a glitched
speedrun of course that would not be
allowed in a glitchless speed
run I I assume by a glitchless speedrun
you actually have to
achieve uh 51
dragons and 600 gems but anyway shall we
start the
Looting not
the tool of
sang of itang
theost means
of me oh no I'm stuck whatever shall I
do let me just jump to my
KN no they're not letting me up
there I guess I'll have to go over here
then
oh yes I need the
keys yeah I'm not flying quick okay I
need to be close to the
ground
like
apparently just flying isn't
[Music]
enough collecting
gems that would be an interesting idea
to come yeah here are a low a lot of
these 25 Spring boxes but but there's
only two of them before you reach this
bonus which I do find
[Music]
interesting someone's going
[Music]
crazy that wasn't the one I wanted to
play but
sure
okay actually oh yes here we go now I
can access
[Music]
these and these can I get the
see
yes I wonder what's what would happen if
you do that with an egg thief because
has that
[Music]
animation going crazy
and but with this
[Music]
key should be able to open this
story a
plane
[Music]
come on
[Music]
[Music]
plane come here I'm flying so
quick and I'm trying to play short to
dve
but yeah so
quick that didn't
work so
close
flame need to reach
further everything is sp from here
should get
[Music]
[Music]
flamed why is this plane so difficult to
catch
up yeah if I do that it's definitely
going to be tricky to catch
up
um where's the
plane there it is
that was
[Music]
wind why is it so impossible to catch up
the
[Music]
plane damn it go
finally maybe I should have gone walked
up here and done the higher height
before I started chasing the pl that
might have been an
[Music]
issue l
quick
[Music]
play well I need it harder and because
the higher up you fly or more like the
closer to the Limit you
fly uh the slower splies but if you
increase the height of the limit SPID
flies quicker at the same
height so if I had increased the height
SP would have flown
[Music]
quicker tampon nose I don't have tampons
in my nose unlike
you sounds like that play need some oil
on the FR it's squeaking
horribly it must be well
hello I hope you have a nice day
why are
you I do right now just wonder not two
just a single tampon in know not a
double
tampon that was the yeah we going to
follow this plane forever and I keep
running into that
thing
the the endless run
spiral okay I'm getting
[Music]
closer the plane is feeling the
[Music]
heat the camera doesn't want to follow
along so P do you see something
different you might not recognize the
levels as much as
uh I don't know I don't know how
familiar you are
play
so but something is
different I haven't play this game like
when yeah
don't and not make it easy to recognize
anything on
maybe it should be obvious when the gem
C shows up
[Music]
though one go this two so one of these
two hopefully one of those
two yes and then there's one rocket left
I think yeah there you go there's
one I thought Sparks was going to leave
that
behind there we
go not a good idea to stand that
close did I get everything out
[Music]
here 9 and 40 looks like so let's enter
this room this this exciting room look
[Music]
gems look at
this no they're falling
over
[Music]
games
[Music]
who gems sparkly outrageous
[Music]
gems does not look like I got everything
it looks like I missed a 10 somewhere
19990 that's not releas in the game H I
missed a 10 somewhere somewhere there's
a single 10 lying
around haunting me a Miss of 10 oh there
it
is taada
200 2,000 I 2,000 the level with most
gems oh I mean z n91
gems yeah it wasn't obvious everything
is mired defeated gastor collected the
dragon eggs saved all the dragons and
recovered every bit of treasure in the
dragon Kingdom how do you feel I feel
fired up Bob and I'm happy for the
Dragon World of
002
after you need to do the Slash the other
way
around uh never mind what's a minion
that's a thing
of ad and I felt that nasty in spite of
his misguided nature was a worthy
opponent uh-oh here we go
again but but n nor
who has the new and now the same
creds there you go but the TW must be
flicked good luck finding that there
might be some to in unic that appear fli
[Music]
but it's
someone
named it appears
as everyone gets the name spelled
backwards but anyway that's the
game full game 100% with a kind of like
a
double run through the whole game
because I intentionally left behind a
lot of gems that I went back to collect
[Music]
so oh
yeah shall
we look for someone to visit it is very
close to midnight here like half an hour
left who shall we
visit got some interesting options
here D rain Fox ranion
isumi catalyze NV
relation Malo
[Music]
Benny I need like he's like
2night here I mean yeah you're 1 hour
ahead from me you're like 24 minutes in
in over the
midnight we could
visit level again it
was not too long ago but I've only ra
him once and I probably won't get the
chance to raate him any more times
because he he streams quite late and I
don't
normally we'll see how my schedule
changes uh after
I he is playing Elder ring and he
has he is collabing with two other
streamers I pref it's a personal thing I
have a suggestion should you take one I
have so many options
for as I say I prefer not to rate into a
a uh uh uh uh uh what did I
call collab because uh yeah I don't know
if it's awkward to me I like I find it
awkward
that's it doesn't really show up well
when when
otherwise we it's like
fny I have however I think we could
visit Rion
instead I haven't ered her in a long
while I
think yeah only once and that was in May
it was like more than half a year ago I
think it's time to do
that and also I was supposed to I could
switch to this screen I haven't I
haven't updated schedule to my no stream
it's still no streams it's updated but
it's still no
streams she's playing phasmophobia did I
say
that she's Italian she does speak
English
too
and and she's really really
nicey I mean she's also doing
a I'm silly but it's been much longer
since I R
it I mean I can still do excep
to although to I don't know I'm tired
let's I'm I'm going go to bed I'm just
doing a quick raid and I'll probably go
to
bed
anyway yes just going there and say
