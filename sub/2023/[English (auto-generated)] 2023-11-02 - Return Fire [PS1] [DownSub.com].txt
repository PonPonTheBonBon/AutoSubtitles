hello didn't give of the time and
I did the
um and well
no doing things wrong the first the
first first of November was collected by
Arian congratulations this was the last
map I
did only took 28 minutes which is quite
a short
time but it is this map that is the next
one what's kind of annoying with this
game is that if if I if I'm going to the
map to the right I have to press
left don't know why some kind of
basically moving the
background games were weird back in the
day anyway this starting
position I think it's
there it's kind of an awkward place cuz
it kind of surrounded by the enimy bases
I see where else it could be cuz it
don't no wait that's not the start Sy
that's just a spec of dirt the starting
position is obviously
here because that's the
base yeah the the exact St
position would be
there oh a star for orian because Oran
is a
star well got plenty of points put into
the prediction feel free to put in more
if you like
to
um and also the
sorry have this
Discord
slow
saying the messages that I'm streaming
at the moment so we got the rabbit Stede
a blooper wait what's the
blooper you're short wait I'm short wait
what I'm sorry I'm sorry where is the
sportsware there is no sportsare no one
has redeemed the sportsare since this
the uh
okay I I know red redeem this sport but
P wasn't even on screen it doesn't
count to stop
talking you
stop please talk each other even
more wait is um there
go that
counts now phun is on screen
anyway yeah yeah one more thing so I
mentioned the bonus World some people
were confused about that
so if I press down I'm going down that
level as you see on the left on the
screen there it shows which world is
selected and then I caness up thing
is if I press up again it goes off the
screen and there's a whole level here
and more than levels I'm not going to
look at those but there are more levels
there are even more
levels and also also one more thing when
I press up I get to this aness app again
it ask me to insert a password meaning
that might even be a second bonus
world because the password
unlocks like there's no point for the
being a password after that word because
I already got the password for unlocking
that first bonus word so what the next
password is meant for or it's just an
error that is not supposed to ask you
for another password I don't
know works if pon pon is on screen
technically no but I didn't start hadn't
start mixed up
yet so didn't didn't go through but I
mean I do recommend only using it when I
mean otherwise you're wasting your own
time because it comes from whenever you
redeem it
currently red can redeem it again if he
wants to anyway Shall We Begin
enough buffing Rocket Man got a star
nice you must be used to
those let's do
some peaceful tanking
while wearing the sports
sing there
so I got some bases
there so I mean I'm I'm kind of planning
out how I want to do
this why is it lagging so much can
definitely hear the
music
why anyway it seems to be fine though
that was a bit wiish
so it does not seem to give me many
options for how to progress this level
so I
let just go through
then care for p
p my which my Spear and
Magic oh get I'm under
attack
I didn't expect to get attack so
Qui oh no I'm
missing one more
Rion
welcome no
see and
um with my Spear and Magic h
what's what does your magic help
M okay one more try hello unlimited
stick with with your unlimited number of
stick
Spears Z up I hope everything is okay
I'm going all right then I hope everyone
is good and welcome R nice to see you
here happy to see you
now it's my turn to show
me Show my gaming
skills been asking P gaming
skills
I'm I don't know how well I would do in
the games you've been playing
so though not sure what I'm why I would
go up here
anyway whoops well I don't need to it's
fine cuz I need to go
down unless I can cross the
water is from l
oh well it was a long time ago I watched
Lunes and I don't remember any Magic
Helmet
so there is if I can get up that through
the water that would save me some
time guess I could use the
helicopter let's see if they allow me to
cross the
water cuz you can drive on uh shallow
water but not
Port but you can't cross the water if
it's just one square but this is more
than one square that's two
squares so I cannot get across
there
so that means I basically have to go
around
everything oh so to save me some time
from having to go around everything I
will see if I can use the
helicopter hi
hot welcome
jto I hope they like the outfit p is
wearing at the
moment it's our
favorite I do like it I hope you like it
too
so here is a
flag so time to go
home okay that wasn't too much of a
success but it was my first round let me
get a second
round
Quantum flag building yes I'm looking
for a Quantum
flag position of the flag will change
depending on which buildings I
destroy and only a single time have I
been surprised for the location of the
flag I guess you could say two because
some one time I was actually surprised
it up in an
ultimate oh I did actually hit it oh
fair
enough I said
pen no something close
enough okay
light now what you call a man with a
Cris packet on his
what Cris
pants Russell I don't get it hel Chopper
surviv Su enough for me
I guess I guess you're right about
that
who Okay
um not as good as I
hoped uh oh
mines
nice
bike stop shooting me there's an
order oh you don't take orders from me
oh
on well that's
awkward okay now that I mean I destroyed
plenty of towers I mean it was success
that
way one one try I get it well let's good
what do you mean do you say crisp or
chips I mean in
Swedish it's chips ships I think in
Swedish is ships
so that mean
I going
to don't have
any the way of saying
it depends on what I feel
like
okay so I'm actually a bit confused
where am I supposed to go
now I'll return with a new joke soon
okay you just have to look it up online
and see if we can find a good one okay
so if I can get past that one and
continue diagonally I can get to that
one which is the one I want to
reach crisp is British forood chips has
in potato chips and a ret is a type of
potato change T to L and you get
Russell to to
to to Advanced of a joke for me to
understand oh
no well I need survive that was
close to
close
more h i no I don't want
to I mean I do appreciate it that you
just post stuff up the
stuff what bunny take part in the
prediction it's an order no do what you
want and and you throw today there's a
prediction going it's basically the
closest predicted time so if a time is
not predicted it will not count to wor
fig Which is
closest that wasn't obvious it says
losest but that's because I can't
spell but it's meant the
closest uh what's the difference between
an Indian and an African
elephant uh well it depends if you mean
Indian as in uh as in short hand for
Indian person or if you actually mean an
Indian Elephant I mean biggest
difference
is well actually uh I would like
normally I would assume that H you meant
an Indian Elephant but um however
because it's meant as a
joke uh I would assume the joke is going
to be that Indian means a person and
that's going to be the joke or something
I don't know
how I figure out the
joke if I'm going to say like I don't
know what the difference is when Indian
is a person and a African an I don't
know what put 50k on the
prediction maybe not that much oh I'm
not doing so great at this
P of
course
what I
did would I just accept jokes as they
are uh I
know oh I actually survived
that those those turrets or Towers or
Tower turrets or cats are kind of kind
of tricky to get rid of because of
uh y I destroyed the tower and
survived a man walks okay you're not
going to finish that one once an okay
you did actually finish it sorry I
missed that message H yes I knew you
would I knew that was a
joke no no now it's
how did that not activate
mine a man walks into a bar he says ouch

[Music]
one anyway back few weeks later the man

monkey the monkey oh he did bring his
monkey with him jumps onto the table
pick up a cherry put the
Cherry
where
what
okay I feel like your
joke are a bit
too
to
detain I mean I don't know I'm doing the
oops I
wi it was funny as long as it lasted I
guess I just have to take the tght this
time let go no more no more he up the
music now it's going to
be maybe tank music
oh get rid of it so I can move over the
bridge without all right I'm supposed to
go down here I
think oh hello Tower
nice to see you
here
so you didn't even finish reading joke I
know I stopped reading it because it
became
very very
uh
weird
and I didn't want to finish
it what's your thoughts on the Norwegian
football team what interesting well
since I don't watch Norway play football
I don't have any opinions regarding
that I don't have any opinions regarding
Swedish football team either
so but it'll make sense once you finish
reading it
but no it's it's it I didn't like
reading it I stopped reading it because
I didn't like reading
it h Association a rugby well I mean
isn't the rugby is called
rugby I'm moving I'm moving stop
shooting me come
on socer to the
ganks oh s that's Swedish for what's
your opin opinion on the word
well I don't actually know what it
actually stands
for
so but like it's not like
um against the word or
anything what I know is that
at least it has an association to being
swar word I don't know how like a s it
is or anything
so cannot say anything like on in
that I'm sorry if I can't give any
opinions regarding things because
say
because I'm not familiar with the things
you ask my opinions
about sweing is
naughty
nah spring is
okay is this a bridge I should
cross looks like
it
yeah let's
see look another
Tower more
Towers too many
Towers oh no it destroyed my
shield
oh well time to go back well I need to
go up on the bridge before I go back
otherwise it will end
badly jell
welcome H perally kind of reminds me of
the Polish
word as I understand
per is a name of a God and they these
days the same same as saying
Satan so so equivalent to the Swedish
word
Y which means devil although I guess it
actually would be equivalent to swed
word sat because that's
it okay so the two words aren't
related I mean sometimes the meanings of
stuff change so it could still be
related um
so so I have to go up to that base and
then I have to go
down and then I have to follow that
chain of Island
it will be quite
Adventure quite the
adventure who's your favorite wrestler I
don't even know any
wrestling back in the day my favorite
wrestler was the V
Rock
well at least at least someone has a
favorite wrestler back in the
day yeah I have not watched any
wrestling behave Stone Cold was far
better what you can't ask what someone's
favorite thing is and then like hey
you're not allowed to have that as your
favorite thing that's not as things
work that's not how any of this
works go get rid of
that it went out of
tower contining down or hey it's was
attacking me but apparently wasn't even
facing me has happened multiple times in
this
game seems to have like two versions of
the tower one when it's far away one is
close up compl little unrelated to each
other
hello this going to
continue attacking my way through
here
oh
when oh excuse me where did you come
from he invited
you
okay let's get rid of some of this trash
so I can get through
here and let's see what more did you I
go across
here
no but I would like to use that fuel up
over there cuz I'm not going to be able
to get back I
think maybe we'll see if I'm able
to cuz I'm running out the
fun oh yeah you don't save fuel by going
faster oh there's one there good I
should secure this
area but maybe not this
time oh this yeah here good now this
time
here
annoying please don't destroy
this not want to flying things coming
here go be
G thank
you now back to
base okay like my dad actually met Stone
Cold by doing HVAC work on his
house crazy your dad was doing some H
HVAC work on his house and then your
stone cold just showed
up I hope you have some good vibes
jellyish
jellyfish
no hi hi hello
okay
so yeah I'm doing good progress
here this isn't a massively annoying map
like a lot of the other
Maps I'm glad for it it's a it's kind of
a massive map still but not
annoying well the house was under the
construction the GU shut up wasn't
really
exp I
guess I'm so
confused your joke is too advanced for
me to understand
[Music]
so okay you know
what I don't like how you're trying to
shoot
me okay fill up with some
more
and I don't like how you trying to shoot
me and also how you destroy one of those
that's also not
nice moving on
to the next
place at least I got to one place but I
got the other place too I should see if
I
can secure that place
I can fill up my
tank yeah please destroy this thank
you so they don't accidentally shoot
me uh I don't like how these turrets are
trying to shoot the peaceful tank I you
should destroy them peacefully I mean
yeah if they they trying to destroy
someone's peaceful
SC
it is the peaceful option to destroy the
SE that's try trying to destroy the
pieace
well there we
go uh here we
go place to fill up my
tank my Tank's
tank no why why are you destroying them
why are you destroying
them oh there's man of this that's good
but
still oh thank
you a
traitor come on move move
forward wh standing in the
open but now I Tak massive damage
massive damage is one to here I should
probably get rid
of that wasn't
good because now yeah that's that's not
good well
well I made some progress that's
important
and the slow part about this game is
going back and forth back and forth back
and
forth what did you dress as for
Halloween H
nothing what is
Halloween I like I wouldn't mind having
like a Halloween
party I'm not much for celebrating
Halloween but I mean if other people
want to celebrate it I can still do it
it's just that I don't have anyone to
celebrate it with like at the
moment still up to for doing it if
someone else wants to like I'm I'm up
for
like I'm for doing
it
yeah it is possible that the that Dr man
is asking the question more like out in
general to
everyone so I'm I'm asking them but I
mean everyone is pretty everyone can can
be are free to answer them as
well medieval
warrior and my gra CH
and yes i' got a tank here even though
they going to that thing is further away
than just going
home okay now I should
just go up the chain of
irons I was a Mexican wrestler
oh
interesting and speaking of armor my
gloves are out for Li
today
yay but yeah I do I'm I'm a for doing
it and as I probably mentioned before
like because I
like I like I guess I guess it explains
more about my
interests how someone said like how can
you not celebrate Halloween you get to
do things like dressing up and like I'm
a f dressing up whenever I don't have to
wait for one specific day of the whole
year I'm I'm not Che dress up any
after I'm still willing to do it if
someone wants to have like a party of
dressing up but I am willing to do
it just I don't really have anything to
dress up with at this moment but I will
I want to do it like after I move or
something
uhor lad I played n Robin
for is that the OT
B I don't know who that
is I hope it's not someone I should
know
okay I should f up the
tank I just started wearing my armor
everywhere as an every El thatou and
sounds
cumbersome oh hello Tower hello other
Tower
and hello to you Tower yeah this is the
chain of
isance
so
let's steal I mean land
some missiles I will give them back
here I picked up some missiles for you
you can take them
oh
oops maybe you can take
them but nope
okay a lot of towers on this
island a Long
Island loud Vehicles
outside go all I already hit it with the
helicopter or something oh no I'm
missing
it
okay going well so
far no secret Towers there because I'm
doing going over water I'm moving so
slow so they they have time to rotate
and face
me they face
me nice okay I'm I've taken massive
damage so I need to go back
home uh and since I'm in Texas sord
included is legal to car a sword in
public
here oops I don't think they were ready
for those misses no they were definitely
not
yeah
oh out of
munition oh time to fill up the
key I should probably pick up some extra
missiles before I
leave you know yes than cas
then I need to move home I'm doing good
progress
here all right and then fill up thank
you
H
dangerous okay I don't need that
much no flying roing
okay sparkly actually it's not sparkly
you just get the purple message unless
you think purple is partly I mean I I
think I think a colorful message is good
enough
I'm going to say some colorful words
some colorful words I mean the words AR
colorful
me I mean if you want to the words are
just the words are still
white I shouldn't have lot of that but I
ha
oh
that yeah you shouldn't
have no wait I need to keep that
one oh
no out munic
again if you is see an Apple
store and
not anyway get robs there we go does
that make you an
eyewitness
yes I wonder if I should switch to the
tank by
now absolutely
correct we'll see whoever wins the
prediction is it going to be Rocket Man
probably not
considering the track
record is it going to be
um it's going to be interesting to
see
want to see want to
see I've been going
for about 50 minutes at moment
so let me
see
shouldn't matter how many Rockets I'm
wasting because I can hold this F up
again and then I want
to full
tank through
here oh oh wait no I don't want to cut
through here whoops sorry sorry
and then over the chain of islands I was
tired yesterday but I refused to fall
asleep I was a resisting
arrest
oh oh
my we have someone as rest in the
chat we must ban
them report
them activity okay it should be a wall
up here oh there's one
Tower not reach it there we
go
yeah there now wait these are just L
turrets still where's the
one
that's oh I still didn't fix that
because I couldn't see if there was one
that trigger
on
oh here's the one found
it oh I manag to destroy the piece of
wall instead
of
theory okay and then o that one was not
meant to be shot oh good I have
Reserve there's a tower oh building in
the way they
peacefully left the building good
good good good
good but I am running have bullets
missiles
so and I'm not exactly sure where I'm
supposed to
go
so go go go go an invisible man Mar an
invisible woman the kids were nothing to
look at
I that sounds
tragic
[Music]
let see there you out of
munition
okay how much damage have I
taken
should I just stuck up on Min come
back go go go
go guys are said that maybe I should
bring the other tank
instead oh wait need to go
up in these chains of
Island islands of chain chain chain
what have you done with the Q
outfit oh there was a post check I could
see because of all the
outfits okay I'm adjusted
myself and hydrate of
course
there we go how
done oh
no
nice guys when I have two screens where
I will put everything H streaming stuff
on one screen and what I'm streaming on
the other
screen I will be able to easily
see the redeems so I don't miss redeems
because currently I have to cram
everything into a single screen but I'm
playing the chat the redeems the hist of
stuff and the the stream
logs every sing a single screen
it's a bit
cramped neon welcome bong P how dare
you pon pon is not to be bong
b i pon pon the bon bon not pon pon the
B so much fuel being used up just to
travel this between the this this place
to fill up and other
place
boom okay I guess I just continue up
then yeah there Towers here so I guess I
should go up
here me through one camp
okay I'm sorry people but you have to
leave your
building cuz I don't trust this
area oh oh no stop stop
stop sorry
tense
no where do you come from now I'm
stuck
oh no I don't like this no don't like
that okay I'm being very careful at the
moment okay
no okay I destroyed pretty much and I've
taken a lot of damage I should
probably return
home let me just get rid of that
building see it was
empty he had peacefully evacuated the
building
um sorry I was I was fighting Towers I
didn't sh I'll get back
sh so shoots everyone with the water G
oh
you making everyone
wet I see what you have
there it makes pon pon wet pon pon is
wearing a swimsuit at the moment it's
fine P pun can take it deep in this
water maybe not this shallow
water
anyway time
to move home with this
tank and then I should maybe bring the
other
tank nice
shot so out munition
here we go plenty
missiles so I can move here and fill up
the tank and then defend myself from
potential rude thing
coming no things good good then we can
proceed as
normal
oh sport
time yeah I definitely need a sound
effect that plays for
me doesn't need display on well I should
have some kind of
animation
I
could I do have one animation in mind
that I could Implement and it could come
with a sound
[Music]
effect
I'm destroying
everything this
[Music]
direction I'm going
mad okay time to switch over to the a
the tank that's a bit quicker and has
different
music oh wait I should check the
map let me just check the map so yeah I
moved up to that areas I needed to move
down the chain of islands and then I
will go like attacking those two from
South I
think party
ponon this one is a bit quicker than the
other than
it has less armor even though it is the
tank wiggle wiggle wait what's
that it show
wiggling
okay I do have a plan for what I should
do now I know where to
go so since I destroyed the left side of
that base there with the flag I should
uh well I should just continue to left
over the chain of
islands
apparently I got a gift sub to marrow
Mage oh yeah marrow Mage he's a funny
fell then I have to follow on this chain
of
[Music]
islands
I at least I get a bit of different
scen and after
this I move up through this
wall I going to say who destroy this no
there was two of
[Music]
these buing up the
tank tank tank the Tank
tank not this this
way I need to go up here
first and then
I no destroy this thing there we
go prise these towers
here nice oh another
tower indid towers is no
problem water
towers oh Tower here
too a tower
here
and oh that
way and then destroy these
towers
oh guessing this Tower wasn't paying
attention to me
but
okay
so go go go yes I'm going I'm going my
goest go but I'm running after
bullets yeah there we go I managed to
destroy flag building but I'm out of
building
now I need to move back and pick up some
more it goes good so far I think I did
that pretty
well where is the three sh leader one
disappointed PNY and two
shaders they are un
symmetrical
[Music]
there we
go oh I have to so far back to fill up
with bullets going be a place
here
like wait maybe I need
more
I think that should be
there
CU I don't have anything to defend
myself against the flying root thing at
the moment
so oh no there were broken ketchup
packages back there yeah
they are storing ketchup under those
tents and the tents were fell over and
everything in them fell over and now
there that was like
yeah like crime scene with catch
balls awful to look
at
so now back
again so I can fill up the
tank the music is being overly dramatic
as
usual nothing when driving the
tank that's when it overly dramatic
music plays
but when playing the
honor T the music is a bit less
dramatic and then fill up the tank again
and here the flying rot in
comes SE shell imposs
there
go sneaking PST here up don't shoot
me I'm just a tank on a peaceful
[Music]
Mission we don't shoot those that would
be a war crime but they are allowed to
shoot
you well I thought that was going to
drone
there there go I don't have to worry
about
that and then I need to destroy the
other Quantum building
quantum
go there's the other
one
done so now I just need to destroy the
remaining
buildings peaceful mission to collect a
flag no one has to die either yeah
exactly these towers does are not man
with any men they are fully
automatic I know what game I should play
after playing return fire which is kind
of also top kind top down each game with
kind of 3D 2D elements of it which is
also like really old I wonder if it's
some
PlayStation I don't know if the PC
version and PlayStation version of
the oh wait the this thing is in
here let me destroy
you thank for the help I didn't need it
oh there's a tower there that was not uh
fly building oops that couldn't go bad
fly building is up here there it is just
destroy you oh no there's a to
there nice
nice nice nice nice well no stupid Bush
flatten whoa
the bush just got
destroyed oh no why is the flag in that
building oh no that's no
good that's no
hallelujah what are you singing about
this is
terrible yeah now we need the dramatic
music
well hello po girl you always a
different color this that's because I
haven't chosen your color why is it the
only way up
there
um well I need to secure the area a bit
more also for some reason I
completely uh ignored rocket man's
message which
said red purple magenta cyan lime yeah
you can't show choose color like that
your your color of your message based on
on the if you do the highlight my
message redeem is going to be based on
the on your username
color oh flag already I'm going to lose
my C
coin I mean yeah I'm sorry you're
probably going to
lose thinking this will take over 3
hours that's
crazy yeah it happens maybe we will win
next
map hello po back I'm back to playing
return
fire I mean I've returned
to return five while I where I will
return fire to the to the enemies that
are shooting
me so I'm trying to force this joke it's
probably a really terrible
joke I'm I'm not sorry about
it removing those for easier navigation
here be right back lur okay
Oran did you know you can write
exclamation point L and be right back in
the same message your message on screen
will still say be right back it's only
the command part of the command that
doesn't show
up H which is actually a slight problem
I have to fix because that means that if
you do the exclamation point so which is
shout out we'll see if you get use it
today uh and then you write the username
it will consider the username not to be
part of the command well technically it
is so I need to fight fix
that shouldn't be too hard to
fix
so with a full set of Health let's
destroy
everything you get toy destroyed you get
destroyed everyone gets
destroyed
oh
oh joy the war not the tower it
happens
okay
so
of course the next problem is these
mines no there we go
perfect and aside from this I don't know
what else to
do destroy
some more of these B I
guess destroy this mine well that was
really close come
on should have
cont anyway enough wasting time let's
switch back to the let's throw away the
tank and pick up the
oh the sport timer is
up now anyone can choose which out on a
punch
we when you only get sports wear and
swimsuit to select from but
still still get S
touch
could thank me sometime going across
[Music]
here
yeah taking some shortcuts every one
day because I
can UNL what do you mean I unlock
welcome
back I hope you had a good time in the
bunny
barow sadly I don't have any more
chocolate I at ate up all of the
chocolate it's all
mine I got a
[Music]
flag I guess I can move over
[Music]
here don't ask me where I'm
going know they exactly know where I'm
going
there appared Towers over
there we don't go towards the
towers seems like a reasonable
thing we can go over
here I found some Carolina reer Chase
pops though oh
in might B I wonder where they you must
have put them
there pun pun singing
yes that'll be me
singing sometimes that would be
[Music]
singing It's the celebratory music
because I got the flag I just need to
bring it back to the
base
makes sense you should have to bring it
to the platform but I mean if I bring it
inside my gate I I think it should can't
too I
want
but but which of you people have
one it only took 1 hour and 20 so
minutes
[Music]
okay this video is actually kind of long
so there you go 1 hour 16 minutes and 41
SEC wait what who who is who is the
closest
[Music]
um that would make option three closest
1 hour 15
minutes and we actually got someone who
voted on it which is water bunny yeah
good congratulation
buny you did
win I wonder which one is closest 1 hour
160 minutes which is closest 1 hour 50
minutes Ro man he still in
win big
sad be happy for water bunny no wait
this water bunny don't
see no I would be happy with the
bunny I
mean he's the one he was he's the one
stalking so so you
shouldn't got quite a few people voting
here
nice to see people taking part in this
it's nice it's
fun
anymore what do you
mean at least it in about like 50,000 or
something well I definitely got time for
another
one correct
spelling
you stalker took your money
yes this is The Impossible Dream oh no
this this map just look at this
map oh oh this is where I
start I start there do you see all this
green stuff do you see this nice
checkered pattern of
GRE where the flag is it must be this
way or that that that and possibly that
one it's kind of hard to read this map
and so I basically have to car myself
out somehow in this oh my oh
my can you ban him
out ster man
where what
bunny what you
one and we look up how how much he
won I I write that on the server so you
get to see
that I'll right every each individual
prediction followed
by the uh
total plus
minus let
me people are writing me on to me on why
Discord so incredible slow let me start
Discord not sure why it's so
slow why it was let
meion yeah Discord is really slow for
some
reason well well that's the next map not
supposed to look at that just
yet come on come on Discord we can do
it
why is everything
[Music]
slow why is everything so
slow I think I need a new
computer one I can run everything what's
the
H this could still St I wanted this like
finish it start start oh oh
finally he still has a Halloween
theme guess I mean technically still a
Halloween week not Halloween but more
the Hallow WI week this is the hell week
or
something
the the whole computer SL 30th of
November to the 5th of no 30th of
October to the 5th of November there we
go anyway I should
start let's see how this
goes I have nothing left
what oh one helicopter I don't think I
need helicopter of this map oh
my oh my I can't even use a helicopter
on that map I will die immediately oh
my please be friendly with
me
okay I have nothing left um
yeah
this map is
crazy they surrounded your base what
base this isn't even a base this is just
a platform I mean I guess you canot get
a base on
me
well well Rocket Man guess you just have
to predict with everything you
got keep it your
best I have to go up go down go up
go
Sports where yeah make p a bit more
athletic I'm being over cautious at the
moment
uhoh
they are
everywhere
okay it will take us while to
break
soon up down up down up
down
we making some progress
now oh no there
like
rings at least they don't shoot me now
anymore in the
middle
that's some
progress let's get rid of
uh more of these
towers
how does it look ah much
cleaner much
much
nice nice island is mine catch up all
over the
island and there's a regular wall of
towers
they had definitely surrounded
my place
[Music]
here so I need to find like a place to
break
through and break out of this place
that's going to be
fun
Okay
so
so much better
now oh a crazy
map still a crazy
map w w w take so much damage so
quickly
that she over the
wall shoot each other Sho destroy the
wall okay I'm do I'm get crazy
now
hey stop
stop oh it's clearing up I'm making it I
just H I think I know where to break
through I have an
idea can I just want
to
clean up a bit
more yes shoot
it
okay
there are definitely so many that that
are destroying
shy going up
mines don't like
that I want and survived let's squish
it
okay the island is secure it's my Island
no
Towers now to see if I can break
through and I I think can bring it
through up
here
um
but they are plenty of towers
though I should probably destroy the
outside
first CU while I'm doing that I can
destroy each
other oh oh
yeah I'll get it just a
moment
hello okay
so first
to
straight
hyate
I have now
hydrated oh you're still it's because I
haven't still destroying this part
yet there we go now they're destroying
it
sh
nice very
nice
well it's a
start
I hydrate but I have no vodka is that
the only thing hydr
with well Ro man you should have some
more points now you can put into the
prediction
with yeah they went crazy with this
map
he went
nuts oh no another flying R
sink look does it look like I have time
for
you is that why you're attacking
me taking your chances of attacking me
because I'm busy
I think
so
okay no no they're destroying
everything and after the sports play a
swim seat will
come
exciting
oops well we don't need that building
anyway okay I will try to break see if I
can break through here
mind if I try to bring in a helicopter
here it will probably die
immedately
I'm surprised that the buildings have
survived cu the towers are not careful
where he's
shooting
oh look it's such a gap
there what a
gap I'm a cute little bunny driving very
dangerous and
than used to establish some peace here
that is my mission and I'll stick to
it I'm destroying it
missing another one just destroyed one
of
you okay you know what oh I one that one
died oh going ahead of me boom there you
go take that flly thing and take that
you other flly thing so so I
mean a big cap there
now well yeah I technically don't really
need those two because I mean they are
so close to my base I could just go home
to my base and also repair my
vehicle so yeah so this thing just in
the way so I can just destroy
it even though I try to keep it alive
doesn't really
matter
yes destroy
shy yes try to shoot
me noty I'm
incoming there we
go
well I'm a bit stuck here flee flee look
at the destruction they did all on their
own I
no
no get out of here try to see I'm
busy
if the towers had in their code look at
that dark spotting made up
there tank so you have chosen death yeah
ex
exactly why is the base one square to
the side of
this I don't have to worry about those
m well let's
continue I think I need to shoot that
one because it doesn't have anything
that can shoot it so I do still need
need
to okay I still need to shoot them that
at the edge of the map look at the sharp
beaches straight ede
beaches that almost sounded like a
insult Str Str H
beaches
B does not have anything behind them to
shoot
him what does that take to die already
so there we go there's the
bridge how am I supposed to cross the
bridge without them
shooting oh oh they destroyed it wasn't
prepared for
that
I'm just making this get oh
okay making this Gap a bit wi second can
move through a bit quicker and
easier
but run out
munition
so what a crazy map this
destruction so yeah I need to destroy
some of those Towers they don't try to
destroy the bridge as I'm crossing
it cuz I don't want to rely on a
helicopter for obvious
reason the helicopter would not do good
in this map
but I only got one and didn't like if
they didn't want me to have the
helicopter why didn't they give me
one yeah more swim
it yes destroyed
sh cause more property
damage thank
you and then I just need to oh Sports
way what if we rely on you for weekly to
so cute isn't
that wait isn't that what you're doing
isn't that the point of watching my
streams for your weekly those of
cuteness
where else would you be
here maybe
exactly I'm I'm here to provide
cuteness okay that Tower is not going
today because I like you you're Ador p
not for your weekly
kidness I'm trying to break my way
through here so I can destroy these
towers but I'm destroying them
themselves quicker than I can e
them not
really I'm taking my time okay here's
another one
h
okay this should make traveling across
the bridge
safe
what destroy it thank okay now I can
progress there we go now I can destroy
this
one am I going to have enough missiles
to get
through destroying
everything by not destroying any Tower
is
old okay I'm actually not going to have
enough
to cuz that Tower is not going to die by
anyone and that's the no missile now I
need to exit oh take the long way
around causing so much
distraction
don't trying to shoot
me but I'm happy that you're here I'm
happy that I can be your daily do of
cuteness I mean weekly do of cuteness
I'm not here every day but of course I
can be cute on the server
nice
line this not I should maybe cross the
bridge
now even though oh and for those who
unsubscribed jokes are new I don't need
doses of kit
you're here anyway completely of Free
Will
crazy I didn't think that was
possible am I joining up with it
correctly it looks like
it no no one is shooting that
there we
go ah
nice so many dead Towers so much
destruction oh
no
no
no good oh
no almost dropped into water
today almost but I saved
it
can I mean this
Dy here we
go
trying to shoot me
hey
so
yeah Towers too many
Towers I wonder if I should use the
helicopter to destroy the fly
meanings I would basically have to fly
out through this one me what else would
I use the helicopter
for
[Music]
no no destroy that
one the
gate
stupid
Towers all and this tower has nothing
that Sho
it
s be
time peacefully cing a peaceful path
stupid block being any
way oh
mind
I do wonder if I can actually use a
helicopter because that should be I
mean it's quite the large area
without Towers
now quite a lot area without
Towers
I mean I can always
return cuz now I first of the helicopter
can lift off if I did that itm theop
would been
died would have been
died Lu yeah this is safe
straight no okay that was a bad
idea I did
it
[Music]
[Music]
H yeah maybe I should like make that
area a bit safer first and then I use
the helicopter to
like
move the helicopter can basically have
to move quickly across the bridge to
reach the next
flag uh
building and basically have to fly over
every yeah Tower
thingy and then bomb the FL
building to then moves over to the
next it will be quite
the
my aim is
good one more boom
yes
oh
interesting
interesting
well
okay
so so what I basically have to do
is
quickly fly
across no one get En me just get stck
there I'm slowly making
a quicker quicker pause here
oh
nice because if basically cannot reach
the next area with the
helicopter I
mean
oh no I missed one Tower but it's
fine could be able to because there's
plenty of water
below below the
uh the flag building so I can go there
without being attacked by a
submarine
[Music]
wrong
okay
what are you are doing out in the
water oh did that hit it he
amazing hold stop shooting me thank
you oh that was wrong
okay not exactly how
I gu it
works
so oh no I'm I'm out of fuel I didn't
think about
that
no stop shooting
me one stray bullets H me guess it
wasn't stray I guess it was going for me
oh actually man to get back oh
my
you oh look at
that am i supp h CU basically need
to yeah
whatever I I mean it's
working let's me destroy the towers the
turrets on the other
bridge I guess it's still a useful way
to get getting rid of the towers
so
[Music]
I not up
[Music]
here no I missed
no
stop shoting me oh no I'm
dead
okay start wrong
building oh wa
oh
Oh wrong building
hey wasn't that bad
though could have been worse I
gu peaceful
helicopter let's just try to create
peace but it was shut
down and did not land on fllying
probably the worst part of the whole
thing so there are Towers
here come and show me what's up
[Music]
ah there that's what
should okay hey why rotate
nor okay I want to move away from this
down here yes where I've
shot
Towers no D righty oh
can I get up without Dy
nope nope hey it wasn't too
bad wait a
minute
should I use this one
because I
should I should rather use the tank on
the
bridge I should probably not invade the
other base I should probably use this to
invade the base
with and I use the tank to destroy the
towers and the
bridge I think that sounds like a good
idea
and I don't know how to read
it a peaceful helicopter chopping up
stuff
although when I no I was going to say
that that part allowed
me and hello I follow Fanboys
and I'm I'm more than a
fanboy
so I'm actually show tou
um are
you if you're looking for Fanboy you
come to the wrong
place
now here we
go thank thank
you
nice
nice oh there's old base up
here I copy this from the other
map did they need some some Island where
Bridge connects and then you have a
sneaking Road and Bridge connects
out
anyway to move
home flying
anything
time to move
back back home so this light blue there
this shallow water I can go
to well you know what I think they put
the shallow water where the towers are
which you
could in the universe say that while
there shallow water there so they can
easily build the towers there but that
means that if they destroy that piece of
of the bridge that doesn't make the
bridge unusable because you can go over
the sh
watering
go
singing p
p yeah start
sinking we just cing through
here you don't mind
me oh no I destroy
Tre so now that I taken care of that I
should probably switch back to the when
I have to return to Bas anyway because
it's a
broken take the tank and take care of
the stuff on the on the other Bridge not
dramatic music because I lost
[Music]
thank H head
pet I take some head
pets just to wait until the head P
redeem
exists it's going to be good
[Music]
times
boom let's take care
you and then
[Music]
you and then
[Music]
you shootting the Bri
can then takes a lot of damage to
do so at least the Tank's like quick
moving quick it
strength go go go
no pizza to the
bunny and she doesn't eat
pizza
he's shooting
everything oh a
hamburger looking
hamburger giant hamb it's also like
quite the graphical difference between
switch emotes and the
Emoji
they're trying to shoot
me at triangle of
Rhymes yes jelly donut
works yeah every single emote single
code Point emote should
work demon
like blue
heart no
someone is out in the water shooting me
that's no
good now shoot me
instead and it must be
here okay it's stopped shooting me so I
guess it's
died nothing P jelly don't
that well actually
uh a donut that is not jelly field does
beat a jelly donut because I prefer them
not being jelly
fi if I may have a
preference because if they jelly field
they and also like I prefer e like
hamburger for donuts
because being healthy beat eating
donuts
oh
okay is it time to bring out the big
tank
or uh not
yet I think you got it I mean I know
it's from
the or kid St of
Pokemon hamburger F donut
what oh that's Dr
so many distro
Towers so much
destruction
[Music]
okay there are some thers
left there we go
there ah I see you looking at me
was it he did when the
helicopter fting all over the
place all went there we
go maybe I should go back on there
and decide how I should reach the
final power the
final should I go south or should I go
west heart pounding
action who's pounding your
heart yes tank is going across a long
long
bridge a long long
bridge how
exciting that should be more than
enough oh not flying R
thing
my heart it's de it doesn't
pound oh oh no
my heart doesn't pound either e
kilogram I might have to go that fast
because
otherwise those Towers might be too
close that they actually might start
shooting and that wouldn't be so
good
or I
[Music]
go now I have a
plan it's a silly plan but it's a plan
that will
work yeah my jokes
are
Terri
so hard kilog gramming action
yes that is exactly what it
is yeah this this is wasn't
there I could get across here a
bit
so I have an idea of how we deal with
these
and you could
say an idea for how to deal with this
and I deal with
this and I'll deal with
this and I have no idea
what watch while we run out
and time
now
um and getting closer to the Horn of the
Mountain
King yes watch me but don't take any
action
action
oh oh
no oh there
you can't even turn around
here now wasted some
ammunition okay here's my
plan okay I will probably have to deal
with
you two
three and of course you as
well oh
building
oh there Towers like
this okay and
then I just need to know how much I have
to
destroy
there we
go Oh I thought I thought there was
going to be a road here but looking but
I I should have realized it shouldn't
been been a road here looking at the map
I'm
silly I'm a bit
silly but I'm making my own
Road
oh there is a road
here come on he's join
him oh those are
lying
yes now you're destroying them
good oh no flying H thing is
coming go take
careful
this is sa way of getting
across on another
one
and I only got two shots
left when oh no I did another
one thank
you
nice yeah I wish there was
some then there are those
Towers okay I'm going go have
and repair the
vehicle and then I'll be
back back for
me back for
me King of the mountain wait
yeah the Horn of the king of the
mountain C
gory
I want to have to go there and destroy
the flag building and the flag building
is hopefully
empty if it contains the flag that's
going to be something
interesting I didn't realize the timer
for the prediction is
up but we got
um two options predicted
for D we go nice and
clean
anyway now I can take the shortcut over
there Short
Cat ah look at that
beauty nice and clean
yes
like the paral
bunny being nicked by pon
pon she being L nice and
clean sobody
do look at this
empty craw King craw King rabbit
yes now you should just figure out what
the I suffix means in Polish so you can
figure out what R means oh this p is
done pink dress is
back I do like the pink
dress
so craw crawly king rabbit
yes I we should write queen queen the
rabbit
so here comes the root
thing
so yes the straight
sh
no don't
come there you now did you come
from just had one of
you
ano there you
go
need p
p
well the Dr you on you
too
destroy the
towers let me
through
CA is Twin so K would
be what I would guess it means princess
but not that it looks too much like CW
in
some in Japanese the King K rule is
pronounced as king
Cru therefore in
Polish his name could be crawl so he
becomes crawl
crawl
no king king now
it's in
k
it comes
there
boom that time just shooting down
sh St
to
bull yes a single
shot I just fill off with
more CU enough there's not much left
until that fly
building that the flag is not in
there let's go back I don't need to go
all the way back to the base I'm pretty
safe here at the
moment
I need no don't even reach
it oh
well continuing through here while
they're desperately trying to shoot
me they
can't
[Music]
wait why is fun punching on
Spaghetti I'm taking plenty of damage
actually there's nothing here no there's
that
one that's one can kind of reach
te
get no wait why did another one hit oh
no I made a
mistake but it was the first one I lost
so not a huge
loss I'm so close to that
flag you know what whoops that was
shoot you know what I take a tank
instead instead of the
tank
dramatic
music cuz I have an
idea my idea doesn't
really kind of
useless I I still do the idea just for
fun
[Music]
but and need
quick this would be kind of music urushi
what
happen okay
whatever I'm not
shut one Tre on the bridge one in the
water celebrating a burger
can't come stay
anointing dang
it let you celebrate now would
it flying thing
yeah okay so I just
need
there we go run run run run
run run run run run run run
[Music]
run I'm sure playing thing is a drone
but all but wait why is there a building
in the
what but be a flying R thing I mean
drones are flying R things I mean be
fine no way I was thinking I can destroy
the flag building so I can quickly as go
through the flag building to get to the
other side instead of having to reverse
but I cannot go across a fully destroyed
flag building for some reason I'm not
sure why that is I
think maybe maybe they've intentionally
done that because otherwise people would
be able to run over the
flag and then people will confused why
they cannot pick up the flag but that's
because they have red
rules when you haven't used a Jeep what
do you think it's
for
but but it cannot be because you want to
park like Park the tank over flag
because you can someone can take the
flag out of the building and then you
put it on the ground and then you can
park on it
so wrong neighborhood I don't know it
went well
[Music]
so
okay
destroying everything except the flag
building okay well in that case there's
only one place it can be and I destroyed
the last one and there's no flag
building in either and I mean a flag
building in a flag building there's no
flag in the final flag building and it
it's revealed that there are flag
buildings in the the Ring of on the big
island hey what's going on here P Pon is
licking a ball of rice and then she's
blushing or is she or is like or is the
P clone blushing because another pwn is
leing her rice
B there we go there it
is
come on don't need to have the tank
anymore F licking balls I mean yeah I
mean you can probably find
like like you can put like a football
and other types of balls in there and
then you can have p p Le them if you if
you actually want ping balls but maybe
you want it to be a bit more subtle to
actually have food there must be ball
shaped
food I mean there is
a no P Pon don't lick that he coming
straight at
[Music]
you
[Music]
oh Stone's
[Music]
annoying me thinks I will win
this will
[Music]
you it's between 1 hour and 2 hours
which is closest
to it is 1 hour 18 minutes and 20
seconds it's closer to 1 hour than 2
hours
so so um I'm sorry you you were wrong oh
so
this no I didn't def no no one has done
130 I think you need to be more careful
and what you
have well of all the selected options 1
hour is closer than 2 hours
so
congratulations so there's only like 12
minutes left so I'm not going to do that
or
that
so
I I can do I mean 12 minutes loss of a
stream I I don't think I mean I I'll
do stream tomorrow I can do a bit
longer it's fine if you want to see
more
fire same time tomorrow and I might go a
bit extra for
tomorrow I will rocket man needs to win
something yeah he want won for once
congratulations Rocky man you actually
win one for
once you are
