I'm like 36 seconds late
how
can shame you didn't post e where were
reaching
greatness
today it is another day of the peaceful
tank going around destroying
everything hey
tin little
tummy T Tom
tmy
welcome yeah I had to eat a burger
before
stream and as
usual I did not man man to finish it
before the timer ran
out Bon need to play with bear sometime
someday which bear are you talking about
Bailey or some other bear or like a
white bear do you want me to get
hurt C the away let's
go he P ches violence
no I don't choose violence I choose
peace I just go and steal their [ __ ] they
to choose to attack me so I have to
respond I did not choose violence they
did and I respond
appropriately hello hello and also hello
roxies
and have I missed anyone I don't think
so what the bunnies probably sneaking
around here look here's a stupid Tower
who chooses
violence see it's attacking
me stupid Tower and here's another
Tower
see whoa whoa whoa stop shooting
me only only I allowed to shoot me and I
wouldn't shoot
me see they're choosing violence and I
have to respond
appropriately can
you got shot at three instead anyway I
took a lot of damage from that so I need
to
recover
oh there we
go L with wild BS
oh I wouldn't play with white r trust
me probably not probably best to not
play with any wild
animals blow up the vet Towers
yep or did I blow them down because I
did an air attack
agreed
towers
destroyed they started to become violent
with
me don't
shoot okay the first thing I need to
figure out is where the flag is so I
know where I should
go see how violent they are everyone is
attacking me and haveen done
nothing
something tells me I'm not going the
right
way I feel like I'm messed up
already oh look I come came to the right
place move to our forward
again oh no you took out that
tree is peacefully flying exactly
and they just don't like my
color
well I guess I just have to do that
better I guess I just have to get good
at this
game I think it's somewhere here
oh oh oh so it's like
that it is
like okay nothing here I can't I'm under
attack to too many shots made this
helicopter unstable so I couldn't
move
if you me to Sho
shoot shoot a helicopter in real life
how would I'm inside how unstable would
it
become I'm trying to S I need to move
quite
far and I'm running out
helicopters I've been under a track once
by like a
rail Railway
track um I've been in in a tunnel once
where the trains go over
overhead so technically I've been on
track once actually many
times what is
this well at least it wasn't in
here stop shooting at
[Music]
me just move
don't mind me oh
two
okay okay it's probably one of those
let's move in with some
heavier that's why it looks so
weird Okay okay so
I I see I move across the
bridge mooves through okay I I know
where to
go it likely was not fly anymore yeah I
got the feeling that that would be the
case don't even know how to drive this
thing
apparently should the helicopter and
help with the miss one will probably be
out do it in now no under ATT track you
know like a some attack oh under ATT
attack not a
track you need right attack I can't read
apparently what do you mean by being
under
attack why you I destroying so many
trees what have the trees done oh I
should shut down a
tree don't mind me
then
I did not shoot down the tree I want to
shoot down okay I'm going to destroy all
these towers because they are causing me
trouble okay and since I'm very damaged
at moment and I barely got
anywhere just down that train because I
wanted
to I'm going to move back home going
repair this
vehicle he has the peaceful tank I think
to see here
exactly a heavy armored vehicle moving
across a wooden
bridge it's getting very exciting oh I
collided with the house I collided with
the house again
tree let's take that
down
like if they could make that song More
Dynamic making it multiple layers and
they as you approach Towers it it
increased in intensity like that but as
you move away towards your base it
lowers in intensity again I think that
would be more
interesting
H hello see
me I sayum me I hope it's
correct
don't please don't is Sue me for
that I mean under attack
again oh no I shot the wall not the
tower
no oh no I shooting the wall again there
we go going to turn
around here we go let's take care of the
next
Tower I might need to go back and repair
this again oh thank you for shooting
down the tower for
me nice nice
and just to make sure there are no evil
Towers not I think it would shoot me
anyway wait now I actually don't
remember I think I should enter this and
move up or
something
go how dare they attack me what have I
done to deserve
that can I destroy this
mine
yes I think I was supposed to move up
there not not her
left excuse me are you trying to shoot
me very intensive missing
now
[Music]
but I'm moving home
now and now the song is over it doesn't
even the the audio just cuts
off that I can tell is uh
audio
fight audio F sound F CU on play one I
if I understand correctly can
make oh the flying thing yep I think I
would say you can the music comes in two
types the one that just
plays oh yeah I was supposed to move up
oh well those Towers deserved
it you can either either either have cd
audio or you have pre recorded uh sound
effects and then you play the sound
effects that's the kind of music Tom is
using so so the uh so the game is
actively composing the music as it's
playing kind of I guess you could you
could phrase it like
that
so but it does give the effect
that as you when the Music Stops for
whatever reason the final sound that
plays plays out in full it gives that
interesting
effect sorry about that building didn't
mean
to let me get through
here then means you found the
walls it's building fully destroyed I
don't remember doing
that get
stuck no got all this why I'm already
destroyed well I guess I need to move
back home
then
again destroy B
ttra
it's intensive music as I'm moving
home very
fting I wanted to tricky that one
oh makes it a bit easier for the Jeep to
get around when I destroy these
things
SE the towers
right destroy all the
junk it it is how you shoot the base of
the Tower and then it's removes the top
of the
tower I wish I had a helicopter and why
finally get up the flag isn't
there
no
sport that seems like a proper proper
military
where okay let's
go get rid of those annoying trees
they're on my Island but but
still that's how I cut down
three
then so much so much junk
everywh
so I just
going to Dum some
extra I'm very very stealthily the dings
as you fing filling it
up never heard that in real life
I need to take out this Tower because
it's going to cost me
issues I'm sneaky sneaky
yep there are hospitals there I should I
should be able to take the tank there
and repair it because obviously a
hospital for infantry is where you rep
vehicles
I guess they need a mechanics place or
something oh look another door that is
attached to a
wall where are the buildings they are
here
good getting attacked from
everywhere stop Shi oops
didn't realize a little health I had
left yes you can repair attack in the
next two
months well uh yeah I guess they need to
order spare parts and stuff it's it is a
hospital I don't think they have the
necessary
Parts two month delivery time I guess
that makes sense the special order
they must said confirm what part it is
and depending on how damage it is you
might need tol a lot of parts
to oh another one there
you
okay
oh I should have f it
with more
benzine or
petrol or
diesel which is thing Benzene petrol
gasoline I think there's another
term maybe even two more terms lot of
synonyms for the same
thing
with anal they have SP Parts they could
canalies from the what the broken tank
yeah
that's that that's true they could
uh we take some other
tanks for
that okay I'm going to move up here
again then I'm going to take care of you
and then I'm going to take care of
you oh I need to take care of you too
but you're behind a building so I need
to take care of the building first and
then I can take care of you
whoops yeah that's what you get for
walking some mine I
guess
can
I apparently
not come
on no no now they
coming
come
on there we
go dangerous mine there no now the
comes where is it there it
is oh I see you oh sorry about that tent
oh another tent no not the building the
tower okay now that that tower has been
taken care of let's see if one of these
contains the
flag
perfect
so let me just take care of these no I
didn't mean shoot
building wait did they
just or did did the tower shoot down the
hospital I shot it once not twice trust
me I do not attack and
hospitals there we
go this area is pretty
cleared do wish I had some place to fill
up my
munition there we go now it's very
cleared
out H let's use my remaining shots to
just further clear out the area oh that
was all I
had oh
well I guess
I'll use the remaining houseal
to clear out
mines ding ding ding ding ding have you
ever been to a petrol station or a
benzine tank pump
oh wait this isn't a Jeep this is a
massive
Jeep and they have dinged as you were
feeling your
car oh tarps with tomatoes
and
yes or a lot of bucket no they are
painters they walking around with
buckets of
paint
and they they are storing the paint on
the tarps
too yeah protect it as you run out the
tarp you spilling everything
out and in what the game is
rated probably not much because it's
very
cartoony like the the Infantry is just
some pixels
[Music]
moving run run run
[Music]
run
[Music]
oops let's
[Music]
go is there remain Bridge
left
does this song have an appropriate uh
loop if we didn't have that break and
play this song immediately after it
might have worked well
together same video as you
Sean that's new
password or password I'm
bird
flower 24 minutes that
long saved weasel that's that's that's
quite the
name must
say
have you shaved your whel yes

um whatst that can happen lose a
[Music]
helicopter uh see I'm getting betteries
now
empty is since there on this side should
I be able
to do
this
there you go
finally
W CU
me those are very hard to attack when
you're a
helicopter I guess they're not hard to
attack but they are very good at
attacking
you because they're ramming you from the
side and
just fills you with bullets
okay two more
[Music]
places and I do have an idea how I'm
going to do
this okay here it
is excuse me excuse
me
okay that did not go as
planned okay that's pretty bad because
now I don't need know where flying
is so I had one
idea and the idea might just
work no wait I should use a tank
instead
wait that's not turning it's rotating
the
turret in said it had Dynamic camera
that would adjust to
the oh right but thank
you
please stop shoot
me
okay I I have a great
idea well I'm on
STS why is some Dr to music on the first
tank it almost feels like the music is
random for
tank oh no I'm

Racor Edge oh look it's RAC
Edge where is Razor
AG he has been here

hour okay this this looks PR easy
actually W I'm almost in uh Green
Space I'm not going to take out that
first I really shouldn't take out this
next
iay
I shot your buildings what are you going
to
do
okay I'll go up
theise
go up
North but B bunny belly has both words
being be but bunny tummy has like both
where
Ry
no I almost got away from it and I would
have gotten away with it it wasn't for
you
missile I've been up north
before
okay
I am living up
north I was born in
Sweden I
mean a lot most people live north in the
northern
hemosphere
wow no I saw the Miss I tried to avoid
it but I reacted too
late okay three more
places I really hope it's not this one
over
here it really feels like the wish I
tried to say before that they have some
formula when you destroy that one thing
it takes like it's one out of how many
buildings there are for it to be in that
building but they messed up the formula
somehow so it's actually less than one
out of the total number of buildings so
for every building you destroy it's more
likely to be in the rest of the
buildings of course in only have one
building left the made an exception to
that and forcing it to be in that
one
okay well in that case you can only be
in one building I live in the southern
us in South Texas even in the South part
of the
city you know I'm going to test
this
[Music]
actually I don't exactly know where it
is oh there it
is this is
dangerous is staring at me I no it's
shooting at me oh no get out of
here can I hide behind the
building no
no okay so I need to take out those
Towers how do I get to them I need to
move around
everything well actually on the
northeast side of the city well that's a
shame I guess you need to
move
no I'm stuck stop shooting at
me I'm not even here to fight you I mean
I did shoot to so I
mean all
right now I'm getting stuck at Tre
again
three
oh look it's
see so now I can go and pick up the
play I'm trying I could I I thought I
could be a bit sneaky
but but sadly the towers were too close
to the
building doing thing
[Music]
peace
good thing peaceful Jeeps can dve on
water like a
boat
yeah and the only reason and the only
reason they can dve water is so you can
always get to the
flag there you go B that's boat
yes
per
donut make sense of
that that thing it didn't didn't make
sense of to
me is it this level that is part of the
demo late
level yeah I think it this I'm
definitely sure that this is the level
in demo cuz you have two levels easy
level and hard level this is there hard
L part of the
demo kind of start explain this level
even though every level is usually the
same aset
so
oh why did I do
[Music]
[Music]
that
is somewhere
[Music]
here yes he's up
here actually just move forward and
crash into
it what donut you know I hurts donut
F
fly I remember those Dons did he get
hurt by
them or or do HS sell Donuts
now
[Music]
come on come on I'm missing it I'm
missing
it I'm doing so
terribly
so it look like you only need two shots
with a helicopter destroy destroy same
missile you should be able to figure out
the damage of
things and house some
things
there we
go now mov back to the other one I manag
to hit once at least I should be able to
hit it once
more get rid of it where is
it
[Music]
ni it's down here oh no no no no no no

the
fuel out the
way
Flying S yep it's back again it just

used this is inspiration for the
music yeah this
game explosion squish people remember
that
come on come on come
on I don't know to destroy these but I
I'm annoyed by
this yeah I need
to I think Star Wars used the song Mars
ass inspiration
[Music]
yeah
uh wait a minute I
got oh great drop the controll and
selected I should be good for
me now back to the
game I don't like you okay need to it
bit easy to get through
here okay why are you trying to shoot
me there we go a bit safer to get
through
oh didn't get you of
these
oh I'm getting
destroyed now I can with now no problem
I'll show
you
I show you I can do
this okay
H apparently I could
notot okay I guess I'm going to move in
with the tank again I don't doubt you
can see this but I
failed
I'm going the wrong
way I manag to move the flag but not
exactly when I wanted to move
it
there you
go yeah enough that
mine
now I can't move in with this
Jeep
yeah good seeing the towers wer there
would destroyed me I did
that
[Music]
drove straight into the
stone
well proper celebration is
time with it not being pretty much there
we go another video same music though
[Music]
that's a new password flower
Tea Flower
butt
took almost 1550 minutes on
my Reaper realm H I wonder what this
shape like I can't really
tell Victor video yay now let's have
that video play like 20
times oh i
s that's that's not the map
button that's the map
button map
button yeah I we go down first and then
go like
around around around
around moving
down I think this is oh swimsuit because
of all the
water
three
hits
okay then I move around like this I
think this is the correct
way
yes now two hits I guess one of the rock
is just
missed I think my aim is no don't move
back I rotated too
much had promise I'm not
drunk wait where is
[Music]
it there it
[Music]
[Music]
is hit the building at least
y so
empty and then I need to find the next
building there it
is I missed
it
[Music]
okay you know
what there we go I managed to do it the
helicop was out of fuel anyway so why
not crash into the
building yeah water level that's the
reason sure definitely because of the
water not because you like to just look
at her you
swimsuit I mean uh
what w I came me the pump I'm being
drunk pump I'm drunk
say no see no I said I wasn't drunk why
aren't you listening to
me people are people are bad at
listening
apparently I promise I'm not drunking
and what are you drunk no I did you say
that it
[Music]
wasn't there it is what a surprise that
it was in the last
building does that
work it's almost in the last building
you Che
I know right I can't believe Pon is
drunk but I said I wasn't drunk the deny
Mak more
suspicious
no then that's not how it
works why you should not be in a
jury did you do this crime h no while
you deny it therefore you did this crime
well so if I admit I did it I did not do
the crime or
[Music]
something that makes no
sense oh it's got
me you got
me
no no no no no
no oh I got have the day oh that was
close okay I'm at the base now anyway so
let's repair the
helicopter but what do you mean didn't
you deny that wasn't any other reason
than it just being a water level that
you wanted to see pon pon in a bikini as
s SE Al I pretty sure you want to see
pon pon in a bikini so I mean is the pro
that statement is probably in
here the name bikini no I don't no I
don't really like that design but I was
thinking a more
uh that like triangle style bikini which
is quite skimpy you probably like
that there we
go and I was thinking what outfit should
I do tomorrow but the be is probably the
one I should do tomorrow
then
I'm going to destroy everything here
don't need to but
I and you know what I'm complet out of
ammo I'm
completely completely out of H ammo
of both times um half less than half
fuel I'm almost out of a hit
points anyway let's go and grab the flag
let's not waste too much time on this
look at this beautiful
map oh yeah only watch Level that's the
only reason definitely know the possible
reason for requesting P for is a
bikini yeah if there was a if there was
an option for a bikini you would have
chosen that
and I will I will that's one of the
outfits I do want to make and different
styles of bikinis as
well so you can choose whatever
whichever bikini you
want and I hope I can do like random
outfit so you can just cuz I said what I
would what I would like to do is have a
single
redeem and in this redeem uh you type
what outfit you want and then the system
will take your input and determine what
outfit you're
requesting and pick
that and I would like to have random as
an
option so you can type random or
question mark
or I don't know
R
anything oh that sounds
nice
[Music]
and I
[Music]
hope I can have like you can do like
random bikini and then it will randomize
which style of bikini it is
and 8 minutes 41 seconds bikini Pond
does sound like a tasty snake
oh that was pretty easy LEL oh out
flanked I'm always out
flanked look I got a little
base I got the little base look at my
little
base okay I'll start up uh
Northeast look at towers and
everything
so some on
here oh
yeah
great is it going to
explode as they
usually yeah it did explode
good
two Barracks two fuel
places why not
have like ammunition is one one of them
yeah I was supposed to go up
here
okay A bit too far
north why am I so bad at hting
this oh
my we got a new CH neon atomic Galaxy
that's quite a name
got
welcome I'm doing terribly at this game
at the moment B how dare you bunk
me how rude comes in here and bunks me
the first thing you
do well puny again no you don't dare
Bonk me
again I do not deserve bonking I have be
nice nice and kind and then you come in
here and bnk me now I'm now I'm
[Music]
sad again
[Music]
no
oh I even welcomed you and
everything and this is how it gets
treated
oh oh oh oh oh
oh there was something
[Music]
there yeah you got some head pets for a
poor p pon pon for the poor bun being
assaulted
[Music]
oh I'm moving the wrong
way the flag isn't even here so why they
I spend so long time getting rid of
these
not used to
tank oh
no here say do I have enough fuel to get
[Music]
home say
not I actually did have enough few you
told that was
close yo the S I mean hi
there yeah it's swiy time at the moment
I heard it's one outfit you like for
unknown
reason I'm not exactly sure what what
what which you like so much oh you made
it I
know helicop crashes down on the
platform that was
[Music]
close it's swimsuit pon pon doing some
military
operations
Maybe
[Music]
right that wasn't really I want the [ __ ]
but I shot the
mine I'm Sho the wrong things
[Music]
here
ah found
it now I just need to find a way in
here didn't wish it was in this place
but cont like where the fly is I can H
choose where it is
though but I'm always say so of course
say
so P check good good hydr that's also
good hydrated sitting up straight still
wearing my
swimsuit okay let's let's bring in
something heavier a whole tank
oh I had seven heads back wait the
should be
over and yeah I know I know it's like
three minutes of ads like half half
minutes ads like eight of them no six of
them but are probably a bit shorter than
half half minutes so I could see it's
being seven nights or
something yeah I'm I'm sorry about the
amount of ANS
but also we can be together for for 57
minutes without any
ads which I think is more
important to survive the
ads at least it means you don't get ads
every time you come in here you just
come in at the like the whole hour mark
which is when I
play I didn't intentionally choose that
to be the case
but oh they had a secret
mine say has interesting funny relation
to finish language I don't even know
what
say hello again neon atomic Galaxy what
what would you nickname
be neon neon I
guess oh sorry my own Tower you survive
a one
shot we're just clearing out some of
these
trees say
so means stand and something else that
human can
stand
wait something that human can stand up
a
statue a
glass let's open up there we
go I think that's oh I think that's
it now I should be able to bring in a
deep in
here
somehow yeah I think this is
good let's let's work back to the
start that's for you to find out and for
me to know okay you're Neon
oh we got Panda here when I noticed the
uh a menion and purple name it must be
Panda put face on Pon P's chest and
sleep oh oh
my you should should you putting your
face on my
[Music]
chest I I guess my chest can be a bit
soft for one reason or
[Music]
another for two two
[Music]
reasons it's
an thing
what stop bonking
me I don't know what's
worse I thought I okay back good good
that you survived the ads so now now you
can be here for 57 minutes without any
ads I'm not sure why you got the ad so
late though because the ad should
already have been
over maybe maybe you joined when the ads
were playing so you got a three minutes
ad even though you should get less 10
minutes 11 seconds I don't know how
twitch works so I haven't gotten ad in a
long time no gas up so is it like the
fourth special level cuz this must best
special
level
we got no gas here only
liquid Panda just like to sleep
everywhere I notice oh
my okay let's let's get rid of
the sof chest fluff yeah yeah yeah it's
it's totally the the the fluff on my
chest being soft
here nothing else on my
chest
just another Deep
Forest destroying everything
here okay
okay I better move this vehicle back
before it gets fully
destroyed trying some trees I can get
through here there you
go
okay B bely would be sof maybe
maybe now there's no visible belly
let's get you some more
trees I don't like the
mine I didn't get to
you don't like like oh almost almost
there we go now it's
trigger trigger the
mine just shooting some random missiles
here and hoping to hit some trees need
could few
them where my dragon grab Dragon to On's
face oh my p is going crazy yeah
possibly who knows things but I don't
mind ads to help support you that that's
really nice of you yeah I wouldn't be
surprised if there's a lot of people who
when it gets ads they
leave which I technically could see my
stats if the viewer number drops after
every whole
hour but view number seems to be quite
stable
so I guess most people
don't yeah there it's only it's only
that stre minut add block you have to
survive at least it's less ads in on
TV in
EU there's a legal uh limitation that a
TV can only show at Max 12 minutes of
ads
per whole hour and it resets for every
hour so you can technically have a block
of 24 hour 24 minutes of
AD but then it has to go across two
different whole
hours but uh there this as far as I've
seen that there is no such restriction
on
Twitch uh in twitch settings at
least I do I wonder if it does still
affect uh your EU
viewers or if twitch doesn't count as
TV so I need to
somehow where go around here they're
kind of destroying everything on their
own oh no I'm out of munition this ain't
good okay I'm moving back now why you
stop shooting shoot kind of destroying
everything
here yay
Oh no I got
stuck chest I missed a lot uh
yes we we're talking about Pon P's chest
at the moment or
before
uh she does have a bit of a Fluff soft
chest oh I'm being beaten yes you likely
doesn't
I'm going the right way I mean I've
destroyed things here I must be going
the right
way twitch following uh laws in other
countries ah why would they do
that I was talking about the belly I
like soft we're talking about Pon P Pon
P's belly and
chest okay I destroyed that why is there
a single one on the side so I need to
get into that by so many
Towers yeah I need to get into that
somehow I like
soft yeah I think I think I think a Pon
pom plushy would be really
nice would have a
soft
tummy a bunny tummy and a soft chest try
small bed in Pon P's room I do have a
big bed in my
room it's it's like two beds
wide so I can fit there with my
plushies I'm going to create my own
opening here but there's a mine there
which I don't
like can destroy the tree it's getting
my way point it's hard to destroy the
tree and then I'm going to destroy some
of
these oh this thing in
back where is this [ __ ]
down
let me
be you're harassing
me
okay I'm going to shoot down these trees
they they're going to
mine they're going to Mark like a path
that I will
take I know I'm going the right
way let them run off
theun and it also makes it easier to go
through it one I don't have to hit so
many trees when it go through the
G tiny bed for the wi I want the pon pom
pleases so I can hug your bunny tummy
here I essentially have a
c a
c a plusy that you can dress up in new
outfits
exactly she will come in her beautiful
pink dress and then you can take off her
pink
dress and put on her black or very dark
purple technically Sports
where
and then you can p
tummy you
like barely enough room for pluses
well guess you need bigger room
so head
shot okay I need to get rid of this
mine see if I can do that not being
attacked
no there
no she will of course also come with
underwear they can't be naked under
dress that would be that wouldn't be
acceptable and I guess you would have
to it's just a plushy there's nothing LD
going on
right and I guess you would just have to
remove her under the way if you're going
to put on her
swimsuit
anyway
yeah she need she needs help with
that take all my one you
know yeah do you want to support the um
funding of P
pumy already they guarding the Fel so
much
oops it's good thing they're restoring
their own
Towers
oops I was hoping I could should get
minus
one I need P
plushy I'm such many Towers in
there not because the p so your support
me is because I love plushes you love
plushes and you want to support me
because every plush will give me money I
guess I mean that makes
sense technically it's not that I want
the money just that I
want oh want my own plushy but I should
get some
royalties love yes we are assumed it was
love but you L the plushies
um yeah pleases are nice especially when
I can give them different outfits or in
some cases I guess no
outfit
let me go through
here what the flag was in that
thing what a
surprise
I wonder if I can get in with the Jeep
now they don't seem to shoot when I'm in
here can you like shoot that Tower
please
yes yes continue
shooting that's good that's good we
still have a tower here you haven't shut
down
yet yeah I think this is fine I should
be able to ENT
this oh I tried to get to the on M
to my bed is full of
f
I want to come with the pink dress the
black s wear the purple swimsuit and one
set of pink
underwear but I want her to be like
human proportion like of course she's
still going to be
her we proportions because the head is a
bit extra big but um but like quite big
inside so you can actually buy clothes
from the
store
I'm just lagging so much
here sneaky and grabbing the
flank now I just need to follow the
pattern of destroy
trees I'm a few
yeah I got some plushes myself
[Music]
too hey that was an interesting level
they really need more levels like
[Music]
this they should probably
scale more of that same celebration menu
p o n no gas
up what that name is 40 minutes once
that felt like it's too long
and let okay this seems to be see seems
like less and less uh levels the further
in I go whoa whoa whoa chains of fools
this that's not I have got a whole base
down there I don't like this I don't
like this
level I'm currently hauling my skun
plusy
oh my yeah I guess I just need to move
in with this
thing oh Brown
tense
well let's destroy
everything
every single thing
here
okay I don't like the amount of
Mines but I can take them out with a
helicopter
okay it did not start off that great I
want almost lost all my
health
so let get let's get rid of a bit of
this trash that
here and I guess I'll bring out the
helicopter and destroy some of the mines
so I don't run into
them I usually hold mine at night what
does LPL stand for or is that a reaction
pH I don't know is that person holding
light
sticks and yeah I it like to place a
plushy on top of me when I sleep why is
there no gate here seems like they
forgot to put a gate

do
no that house is
gone yeah let's let's get rid of this
tur
one there's people
there
there we
go I'm one more there you go the to wall
is
gone hey Towers you're shooting your own
people can you on hour when need CH in
the pon pon yeah I do agree with
that and well I said when I do have a
new
computer here here's the full plan I've
probably said it many times but oh I
will first get a new computer and then I
will make a 3D model on that computer
which I will use on stream I know can I
have three pon pon for the mod but I
will make a new one for scratch that is
actually uh made to be used on
stream and then I will make a bunch of
outfits and then you can redeem the
different all the different kinds of
outfits and I will make the outfits as
requested by what people want
basically because I can I have two cat
plushies a fox plushy two
rabits a right there
leard a mama and baby kangaroo breaks
and I from Animal
Crossing I thought you have even more
plushies
okay I'm making progress making slow
slow progress on this
level I'm destroying
everything perfect
amount
moving in here oops shot the wrong
building come on shoot the
tree and then I need
to
of those
turrets oh thank you for clearing out
the trees for
me oh no
my
well last one of
them there is a lot of Fes plus
plushies I got a few plushies in all
kinds of different
sizes I other of course the P plusy
so f p a new computer for for p Pon on
stream so you can change your outfit or
my
outfit
yeah I need that donation
too it's easier to
donate
nope that did not go as
planned up some
mine and only a small CT for them all
light down well stack them on top of
you I feel like this level is going to
take a
while
take are quite a good
wi but I got plenty of
time just a quick refueling
you know what I don't like your
building here we
go oh didn't mean to shoot down that top
power luckily no one's was inside
it well I mean if someone
was I didn't notice it it doesn't count
okay does how it counts
right okay I probably don't need to
destroy
this cuz I
know the dark mine is a bit
annoying going to move through here
instead oh oh thank you for clearing out
the
train I am running out of munition but
now I'm
loaded wait where is where am I supposed
to
go
can we supposed to go up
here ding ding
ding I'm only L down and eat them all
it's like having a weighted blanket
yeah that I
know it's a nice pluses on top of you
weing down on top of
you
what's with
the I supposed to go up
here this doesn't seem
right no probably coming
no
nothing just going to remove this Tower
oh no I need to remove this Tower
too please stck on that too where am I
going yeah yeah yeah yeah this is right
place no
but it's better than a waited blanket
because you can hack them yeah so almost
on the right track up
there oh
my I almost supp to deal with
that so far away
too
one I just moving again more pwn pwn two
the C no I don't want to like I I'm not
done any 2D outfits for pon pon because
I did not draw the original image so I
wouldn't be able to make new outfits
that would fit the style and so the idea
was to draw my own 2D picture pon pon
but I think a 3D picture with like
tracking picture 3D model with tracking
would be more
fun so we got more redeem cost yeah yeah
I know that so but yeah so I want to
make a 3D model
instead which I which I just
said told you my whole
plan get a new
computer
sleep I do have being here they could
work like a
blanket
I get the new
computer I make the 3D model I make
plenty of outfits I make the redeem
where you can choose and then you type
in what outfit because I'm going I'm
going to make so many outfits because
it's fun especially if people like
people like pay me I'll make Bas not any
of you want
but basically I outfit you
want there going to be some
limitations but yeah if you if you pay
me I do whatever almost whatever outfit
you want I I'll do the outfit I like to
do and then I they will just be added to
the them just simply
enter the name of the outfit you want
and you'll get
it I will add the outfits to the
description but but if it's too many
outfits I probably have to make a
document
and and add the link to
the you can but you should also be a
able to read it on the disc
sorry

plank

[Music]
from Hello red dragon thanks for
lcking I I think I want to take out
that
and know was a piece of wall
here I'm going to take out because it
was the last piece of
one so there we go my top part of the S
is
clean well move out
again boost it sure that's what we wear
in an s
I don't think you can reach me here I
should be able to go through here with
the Jeep although I can just go with the
Jeep over the water I don't need to
follow
this swim Sav because I feel like you're
going to get wet
fair
enough can't argue with
that stop shooting at
me let's clear out some of these stuff I
can guess through is here
say as I run into that thing yeah I
really don't need understand
why ders of that building are still have
collisions the
corners
no
no to lose this swimsuit time want to
hug the p in a
swimsuit have you was going to say have
you hugged someone in a swim I don't
know
maybe I guess if you have the p p plus
wearing a swimsuit and then you hug her
then you can feel how how pon pon feels
like to hug while she's wearing a
swimsuit if you need that in your
life who
doesn't everyone needs to h a Pon p in a
swimsuit
why are you trying to shoot
me and then I go I do want to get rid of
that
one
no oh no they hit
me
yeah
is destroying each
other that
crazy well I'm going to sneak down below
here until I reach the
next place with the flly
thing yes should
this thank
okay oh no I
didn't well
well yeah I definitely need to go home
and recover now that was
SC some epic going home
music it moves so
slowly I need a Pon P plusy
definitely I said who doesn't need a p p
py everyone needs a p py
almost out of fuel though is there a
place I can
refueled that would be really good to
have cuz I will need to move longer and
longer each
time unless I
need yeah this is going to be an issue
because I'm starting to run out of
fuel yeah
yeah I would not need one per se well
you do need one don't
lie there one thing if you can't afford
one that's fair that's why I respect
that but you definitely need a p p
pleas it might not be at the same level
as food and sleep or something like that
but it is quite high up there
anyway
so I will probably need
to I don't know if
I just need to clear out more of this
area
oh I need to stock oh no oh no I'm being
chased this isn't
good good at all because I don't have
anything to
me
uhhuh okay I was lucky
there I definitely need a P Price be
more important than food and sleep
comined oh my
I said I know it's important but not
more important when to
sleep although a pon pon Plus in a
swimsuit I
mean that is kind of high on the list of
needs
though
okay I don't like how you're shooting at
me I don't really need to destroy this
stuff there's only four pieces left so
let's Dore this
anyway ah so
nice
can barely hear the music
shooting okay out
of
one H apparently the total amount of
shots I guess not not the correct term
missile you have is not divisible by
three so that means that the last the
very last shot you have show three but
you only have one
hft that's kind of
miscalculation it's more important than
sleep because can't sleep without the p
p FL wait how have you been sleeping
this whole time destroy eny building so
beautiful yeah it's kind of beautiful
when you actually destroy them to
Rubble
no come on come on
I was too
aggressive well I got rid of a bunch
of that's neat part I haven't been
sleeping oh my you don't sound healthy
look at
this this I really hope I get something
out of
this one Pinups would be something
interesting wait Pinups in what are you
thinking
then so beautiful so
destroyed we had to destroy everything
apparently
Mah okay
oop oh hello hey
pink yeah I don't have a boob
command would be fun
though I want I want a bunch of commands
like that but I also want the content of
the of the command like what it wres out
to be customized but depending on who
does it and or who you do it
to like someone does theer command it
changes text depending on who it
is but um yeah so I haven't really
bothered doing many comments
doesn't that sound funny though so you
can use a boot command or H command or a
I don't know what el
command could you bring me some more
coal
please you want that as
command doesn't seem to be
any
let's clear out some more
mines I'm really cleaning up this place
now why are you missing
him
there we
go I'm try to Fig what control
[Music]
here I don't need to do
this
ah
anyway I got rid of a bunch
of this means I can move quickly through
everything the train to Lake Min will be
leaving shortly do you want me to play
dog's life
again I already completed that game
100%
I can move through this area a bit
quickly and I wonder if the fuel is
based on the length you travel or the
time you travel for first I know the
fuel does not run out if you stand
still
let see
oh hopefully it's in this
one
no hope
nope of course
not why would it be in this
one
should I go in
here this is
safe oh no thing comes for me and I
can't turn around
well I got it I know another one
comes I got
it what another
one I'm leaving your
base show some
respect
oh yeah I
should oh well I the St you w between
you two I did not take out either of
you not really what I plan to do but oh
well yeah no wonder if I can get back
home
I might need to destroy some of those
Towers
maybe it's based on the distance you
travel not
me time me
TR but I got
back yeah so it's oh no what is this top
of this oh no oh no
I we still find the code be right back
okay so I said
that when these sub goes down in price
that I wanted to do a some special
stream one stream I could try to do is
like Spyro
blindfolded
and I can also try crash three without
power apps because I know way to get
around using power
apps I will I will have to use a new
trick which isn't new it's a trick
speedrun is Ed and I will try to do that
trick on
stream and that can be
fun like not normal game
play okay and then I just need to bring
out in the helicopter
here I
think
yeah it's well cleared
here don't have much munition left
yeah I'm oh no this isn't
good
this isn't good at
all
especially when I have to go through
water I guess I could do
this oh no he's moving away
ah
I'll say that what
happened oh
well I survived quite a
while another one of those level that
takes ages to
do
anything else I need to clear
out maybe this
mine oh
no
[Music]
bit too tight to move in here so let's
open it up
more
so I have the
movement the freedom of movement I
need okay more than that I can't do
because I'm going to be shut
[Music]
down
Aran is
back so I said on the
26th at
17:00 H UTC that is 2 and 1 half hours
ago from this point this
time start on the 20 26 I think it's
what6 was it9 is
it it's should be 26 because it ends on
the 1st of October so why did I choose
this one
again it was not the helicopter I was
supposed to
[Music]
use don't get shut down yeah I know I
will I wasn't supposed to use that one
look how clean out it is now I was
supposed to use a
tank I kind of lost
on yeah anyway so on the 26th therefore
H
17:00 UTC
which is 2 and 1/2 hours from the
current
time current time isus 2 and half
hours
and no no no no no no currently it's
it's currently it's
1735 UT see yeah I was wrong so yes on
the TW on the 26 of
September at 17 UDC which is 19:00 m
time which is therefore 35 minutes ago
if you look at your time at the
moment and that's when the reduced sub
rat
begins and when I was thinking of doing
a special
stream and
uh
this one is very
agressive that's the half of giv it's
technically only half of of uh what
twitch takes so you only get 25% off
sadly but uh it has been half off in the
past which is why people are thinking
which is gotam
it Dy
anyway okay 25 yeah oh exactly noon at
my time convenient it's almost like they
picked out based on your time no I don't
think they sadly picked California
time
but that's tday I think that's
Tuesday there is no problem with that LE
day
nope yes continue to shoot that
thing there we
go come on yes there it
is
I don't need to go to the top of the S
to find the
flag no no they're Shifting the
pr
what a k i I'm not sure you this the
time I we go with but hello K streaming

you can do a lot of I I guess I could
have like five minutes outfit redeem 50
minutes outfit redeem you you pick the
length H for different prices half an
hour it's
anyway there we go let's continue
and uh let's see
what K as
well I can understand that right now I'm
trying to finish up a class whoops I'm
running with
something uh and then I sign up for a
work program oh and then trying to get
that thing figured out at work it seems
like you have a lot of going a lot going
on there Ken I hope uh
I hope think goes great for
you and that everything works out this
well anyway P pun is hecking Kitty thank
you you destroy the
bridge maximum room
this
what can't even hear the skull laughing
over the
music got all the way there destroyed
some of the
towers
well not more not much more to
do go go
tank do you know the Swedish word for
tank and obviously this armored vehicle
type of tank because tank can made
multiple things
[Music]
nope okay well the Swedish word is
panag most likely a c from the German
World
panag H which just means
paner
wagon or like
pcer
yeah pcer
wagon there we
go
uh
let's get rid of this oh
no got rid of it before it showed up on
screen let's just get rid of a few more
Towers just make sure no one decides to
shoot it
deep and because I want to shoot
more I know you but now and H now do you
know the Finish name we have very
similar
vanar
V it's like the
paner
wagon is it that kind of like just
taking the Swedish
word like
the the finished word
h means dog which is just this s word
h
which is related to the English word
Hound well I finally managed to get my
my way to the
flag what Barely Used up any
f
but let's make sure they have full
[Music]
[Music]
tank oh yeah you could say
armored that
work but I guess it's directly related
to the English word
paner
TR imp polish if you say so have fun
time oh I run into a
tree have a fun time streaming I've got
to go back to work have fun with your
game today bye thank you for stopping by
Ken have a good time at
work hope it goes well s again yay how
long this this take 42
minutes oh
my but
well
all campgrounds of America dead end you
know
what let's wait I forgot to read
name these
levels
let's let's use the door what does it
put me if I do that oh it's put me
little
Wars okay can I
no
okay this doesn't seem to be too
tricky got three places this should be
really quick
actually
no base like different people make these
levels like some people think like yeah
the brown team should have a base and
other people think no they shouldn't
have a base we we make the whole level
and plop down the start position we
don't
actually we don't actually care about
the brown player having a
base
M little walls
more again as far as I can
see I think I think it would be small
mve actually they would be on a building
these are not building walls these
are blockade walls kind of they would be
M right and yeah there's a lot of small
[Music]
small
oh come
on
finally okay he not going this quick
that's not going that
right yeah
so yeah make sure make sure there are
not multiple words for
walls building walls
and walls for
blockading and I wouldn't be surprised
if multiple European languages actually
have different terms for those because
the locating walls kind of thing would
be like what you have
on castle walls and
stuff and Europe European language
having more technical terms for things
would make sense that does of course not
mean that every European language has
that that might be more of a German
thing Germanic thing I might
say cuz sometimes languages do drop
certain technical
[Music]
terms well than did not go as well as I
hoped
so I will try to infiltrate that area
with
tank I have no idea how I will
infiltrate with a tank but I will do my
best I'll
just try to go through
here oops I didn't mean to shoot that
that
why is the tank sometimes not
turning
oh no I'm dead soon this was a bad
idea well I guess now I know where the
play
is there you go we
got I don't
know K
King one time use rocket
launcher single one light one time use
rocket
launcher just clarify more well when
referencing for five walls it be
M
more Mo yeah this same word in Swedish M
more which these are fortified ons
that's kind of here for where sure
that's no
problem here we
go
the first Mr the light part here yes yes
see we have
mui and it's the plural
m and mve it not compete to be confused
with switch word word word
m which is
C think something compl
different this isn't going that
one
no Boop this up tummy oh no pooping the
tummy pet petting the
tummy no it's the word for what
wants no this word for 45 yeah the
Swedish word m means a 4
4 is the word for for fortifica
fortified one fortification yeah yeah
yay yeah don't try eating out more more
more try to eat whatever I
want when time is out I have to
test wait sorry I when the time is out I
have
to just how it is
sorry I mean Fair it's fine it's
fair I
understand that's destroy that
too unless you get rid of the
trees can get
an oop you're
Ador I'm happy to be
adorable that's just what I want to
be and I happy to be recognized as
Ador
okay let's make this
quick we want to destroy the necessary
Towers those that will actually attack
your
deep
p p
on what did you call
me exe me why are you attacking
me okay yeah
okay I'm a bit
scared okay I'm out of armor let's go
home
intens
music that's a nice nice
pronunciation what a nice pronounce
pronouncing oh thank
you
when I'm not practicing random
pronunciation in language is for
nothing so sometimes that can come in
handly for when people write random
stuff in the
chat the clouds here look like there's
going to be a storm I hope this is not
going to be a crazy
storm
okay I'm I'm done good progress so now I
just need to remove a bit more and then
the Jeep should be able to get
through without
e
there you go a bit more cleaned
up and P Pon s the stor in my heart
o I don't have an oo for you because you
can just write oo on that one
say a
storm what's that we never get any Sky
water
here wait isn't that a Star Wars
character Luke
skywater is this the way yes this is the
way
oh tower out on the
water okay I pretty safe for the now
pretty safe just some to shooting at me
St they pretty
safe I think we can leave this clan like
this there we go
that wasn't my
fault someone placed a mine
there
so
so I wish I had something that could P
up
oh that thing could
have but no longer they will no longer
cause an
issue okay is Cle out for mines
now is swear to God cry the luk
Skywalkers curing Duke skyw
water Yes sounds about right okay
I never watched Star Wars none of the
films uh they
must they must be happy with us
then
no hey they never cry over us oh
you know I been de and are upset as me
you never you never had de generous here
on my
chat you
like you are very interested in pon pon
tummy and when pon pon is wearing
her swimsuit but it's perfectly normal
everyone
understand I want to watch episode three
oh
well I've been considering just watching
every film in of course release
order that's how I prefer watching film
in release order lick how on to hug P
tummy I said you just have to fun the
pon pon
plushy uh
scene yeah it's only for sio
reason I don't know what say I swear I
don't know what say so so you're fine
let's move on to the campgrounds of
America this is a square
map oh my what is this map what is this
map oh my
what is this map okay let's clear out
the tank the
towers please don't shoot at
me this is what camp currents in America
looks
like see why do you appear
already just started the
game you know what I leave if if you
want to be like that I'll
leave my phone's almost dead oh no they
destroyed it how
D
well wellan I guess you just have to put
your phone on charge or they sure are
aggressive this
time I mean I'm definitely not
aggressive why do they have towers with
a gate like this what what is the gate
stopping cars I guess guess that makes
sense coming
through
you're just a peaceful tank
exactly sure what they are so
aggressive it's destroying every G
here this map is pretty
big
oh they're hiding a mine
here okay okay I leave I
leave and then it's throwing grenades at
me I wasn't the one destroying building
someone had planted a mine next to the
building I mean cars might have problems
with the sand but yeah we
P against
gatekeeping I mean p pon pon is against
gatekeeping Dre true correct about
that tomato
Bo I hate this when I squeeze my
tomatoes and spill them
everywhere oh no there millions of gates
oh well I guess I just have to you know
Gates
then I just have to ignore the gates and
just concentrate on the
flag sorry about that
tent can I go through here
no
annoying
well I guess I just have to search for
the
flag try to ignore the
towers sorry about crushing all these
tents there's also a challenge
for this kind of
game uh complete the level without
hurting
any
uh
infantry cuz as as long as you
don't yeah you can kind hear the plastic
bags of tomato getting
crushed and also when you run over a
person you can hear the the bag of
tomato that were holding being squeezed
in a sque Wishy
sound
when in one of these buildings is must
existing
one of these
buildings and they sure have a lot of
munition oh no speaking of that maybe I
should get
some pleas don't send anyone after
me oh yeah I need I need some fuel too
so let's get rid of this Tower so I can
peacefully tank my
tank no there's singone after
me
hey are you mad because I didn't pay for
it or
something
guess that's totally what you're upset
about me not paying for
it send it send a check to
the bill whatever you call it to the
brown base and and you'll
see
then do something probably laugh at it
but
something okay
right well this
works long as I don't get hit as I get
hit can do this for quite a
while cuz can rest amunition and fuel
but I do get hit occasionally which
isn't that
great yep when I get stuck like
that Miss son shooting at me straight
into where is the
flag and now we
got I better go back and repair the
tank Bam Bam
Bam well I I do have the
idea probably for game like Spyro
replacing every sound effect in the game
with my own
voice every single sound
effect done by pon pon
H wouldn't that be
funny well or quite annoying I don't
know
all games need to have pon pon and
that's kind of what I do I moded Spyro
to replace Spyro with pon pon and
currently I'm modding crash for to
replace KOCO with pon
pon so
that's exactly what's
happening this is a tedious
map
I'm almost out the munition
again who that
happened now I'm out that's not so
good thank you for waiting until I'm
done
I do really appreciate
that there we go that's what's the
explosion ding ding
ding
sexy bun doing audio
eh you think I'm
sexy well sure sure is quite the
compliment I hope I can uh successfully
recreate that that in 3D later
on and I will do take take a lot of uh
feedback from the community for how I
should how I should change it through
the mod cuz I do want
the replacement to be at least as good
as the original 2D model
I I don't yeah I don't want it to feel
like a
downgrade
yes yes still the whole world would be
fun F oh my so
many I'm not even halfway done
yet we halfway okay and
using this for way too long definitely
that
automated that's going to
be
automated now I do see cing like
different redeems for different lengths
so you can playay for 5 minutes 15
minutes might be a good
idea let this count for longer
times
for
it's a lone Tower
here take care of
you oh yeah because this is the end of
them
okay
that makes
sense Tree
Way
I I shot it three times that's a magical
number that one missed
okay maybe one of those did hit the
T why not P always has
been good version of that
me oh out of
[Music]
ammo what a long devil yeah it's big so
many places
buty I I need to go and get some
ammo that's not
good go here get some
ammo back to
shooting
okay
no it's like finding a hay in a needle
stack that sounds
tricky I wonder if I can use a
helicopter
okay didn't go ass
plan
okay this is
the okay let's see if I can do this
[Music]
then found the
flag
well my was at 100% when the stream
started oh okay that flash so I need to
clear out the way to the FL
and okay let's see if I can do
that time to clear way to the
flank
it's a very musical game I really wish
they had more sees per
vehicle and that the seams changed more
based on context and maybe that the seam
were also Dynamic depending on what was
going
on like it's more intense when you're
closer to the more in the enemy
base or like when you're getting
attacked and stuff oh another premature
celebration how
embarrassing oh I mean I did find find
the the
flag and it should be this row let's
move
back
rotate and
attack we back rotate attack that's my
battle
plan wish I could can't put my Markus
somehow I destroy the
tank not my tank but a fuel
tank it wasn't it
here yes it's here
good
than what I will
do we mark this
area is that I will
destroy everything
there we go that should be marked
enough oh I will mark it by spending
some ketchup on the
floor don't know where it is oh oh oh
sorry about
the
um uh that wait
yeah
uh
and let's destroy that now I have
everything
marked let's do quicker and just take a
wash this thing anyway uh suddenly game
is is Shing size oops a yeah yeah cover
that and so at that point you said no
need to feel
ashamed we a premature climax have since
to the best of
us
Hest see any out mode blocks so I can't
unblock whether it was blocked wait
can't you see that the
mob um I'm
actually maybe it doesn't show up on
mobile that's a bit weird if it
doesn't cuz you should be able to see
that even if you're not in
moderat view it should still show up as
an option to
approve maybe it doesn't show up on the
app that is
weird Oh weird I got the message on chat
saying it's being
checked yeah yeah at least I saw it I
guess m isn't show
it well I usually watch on my computer
guess
[Music]
seems like a
huge
[Music]
oversight anyway I will see block me if
you block them yourself such as
spammers oh yeah if you T that the
message have been removed but that's
something everyone
think but messag is blocked by due to
autom mode autom mods should show up for
moderators campgrounds of America in 23
minutes and 46 seconds I do only have
one level left there which is the dead
end so I should probably just do
it dead
end but not when it comes okay
that was not the map
button oh
[Music]

finally
after running past this area so many
time whoa I found
it now I
just need to clear out this
area whoops is oh game
over I found it but I lost the
helicopter
yeah I might be able to get it want
see I had drunkenly stumbled backwards
yeah game pro covered the PlayStation
version call Brantly conceived three a
minute War SC and an
unprecedented blood of action and
strategy he SED the easy to learn
controls in game
mechanics friend SE and and during
multiplay action and high level of
visual detail oh yeah look at these
visual details here I me for PlayStation
game I guess it is lagging so it's
really pushing the PlayStation one to
its
limits it can lag at times it's not
lagging at the
moment
oh got
stuck when I wasted all that Health on
nothing celebration I've fallen over one
drunk yeah I was trying to find the plot
but there is nothing thing on the wiki
wait do you find return Fire
Wiki what does it all mean this game is
an enigma there is no plot you just pick
a map and go is that kind of what you do
in a lot of
game the plot is on a need to know basis
and we don't need to know exactly I mean
there is a tutorial with not a tutorial
but there is like there's any
instructional
page and
like uh 10 different
languages in the
game let me clear out
this
I know where to
go but the head space
off and now I don't need I don't know
where to
go oh why do they have
a
again they have mines in front of the
thing
no but without plots how can I love
bloom on the battlefield well can bloom
anyway can it can't it yeah I think I
took the right PA
there by going to the right what to the
left for the tank perspective plot pwn
plot P what's the plot point of this
game I once pass out face down on the
bathroom floor woke up 7even hours later
and was confused about why pon pon dream
was over
I Ed the last
part oh if you try to leave out of the
map a sum fires a heat sinking rocket at
you yeah I do know
that that's not good no it isn't neither
the orium passing out or the heat
seeking
rocket when I mean you're the games plot
oh deep and very interesting plot am I
so you're saying that I'm deep and
interesting I'll take
it I think I might be able to ACC this
thing I don't I don't get what they have
the uh
fuel tanks and stuff if they go to place
mines in front of
them T is there but how can
I can access it with it with a Jeep no
problem but how can I access it with
with a t the
question please say it please oh no

alone guys this is possible in the
demo yep it was possible here

too
long I can't get go past
