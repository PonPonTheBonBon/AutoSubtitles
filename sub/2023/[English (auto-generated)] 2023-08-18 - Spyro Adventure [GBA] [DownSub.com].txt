pizza slice
oh I see it's like perspective like that
wow this is the coolest snowboard I've
ever seen and I haven't seen many the
cheaters were probably flipper with this
yeah if you
if you place it on the ground and they
don't see it they will flip over it
pretty groovy looking green boots and
everything I think I've turned out this
area
did I get
along the
excuse me that was quite rude

the remain there
off the
excuse me coming through

all the
suffering is
[Music]

[Music]
I should go to the primates Plantation

what why are you only
look the same
ah I did you found all the toddler
spider I'm so relieved you kids had me
so worried

thanks again spiers keeping track of
these thoughts can be so stressful
hey don't sweat it we were happy to help
you out
next time I'll find a really really good
signing please
hehe right aren't you going to reward me
like
nothing
I mean
not that I require a reward for rescuing
baby drivers not saying that I need to
be managed for it or something
but give me something
I mean like it's not not that I reward
the shoe to encourage me to help someone
in need and but I mean is that it's like
it's like everyone gave me uh something
yeah
so why not
the wine is too
okay so I should take get myself to the
climate Plantation and then this is this
area but there should be a money back
walled somewhere
[Music]
now I see
I remember how to get there
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
which is another game I could play
against
my footsteps there I should
check out what I got for you
with those
there you go
and in there this should be our chest
that I have the keyboard
[Music]
honestly
there you go
uh so James
[Music]
so
yeah
let me
let me all day
do that teleport there
that's going to be exciting
[Music]
yeah I can clean out it's
got that chest
[Music]
yeah there we go virtual Hideaway
does this count as
thank you
that's the last gem in this land way to
go Spiro
nice
[Music]
okay so I'm done with
when I do have to journal but
I just needs the remainder of this stuff
foreign
[Music]
yeah I don't think I have all the
required
yeah I'm missing too
the right banana ripening agent and it
below die number five
[Music]
questions
yellow dye number five
you see that's ah hide it okay
um
important to stay hydrated
I guess you're right about that
oh yeah so there must be a Teleport oh
down here for some reason
right Shanghai the way because it still
counts in the same land
whenever you've done spikes wait a
minute
okay so that was everything there
help me Ferris get me out of here
it is indeed
I just realized
14 hour ago I got
two new followers
my girls and little
bite the cat
I mean it's not a little kitty cat
because it's just one tea little cake
and so
what do you have left you know
you drink drink insurance is done
some Dragon Shores done I'll show us
first in the same time
Dragon Shores has been cleared out
spiral continue to the next world
and we will go to the Thieves Guild
which is in here
looking good so far I'm clearing out
everywhere
I just press this does that and we're
gonna put aside on that I just how does
effect work with that same well well
look at that lava
crazy lava wait
I need to go check that again
I haven't really paid attention to the
flower lava but
I hope everything worked looks fine on
screen it does but okay back
like this
they are made
Direction
it's it's like
this part is basically the only part
that flows in the correct direction is
blowing down this one flows up
and here's the lava fall
which obviously goes down but then it
goes up this goes down for some reason
this goes up to and this goes up and up
so almost every segment of this lava
uh
okay that segment up there is going to
the correct direction that segment is
almost messed up
Inspire instead
yeah so whoever made this area didn't
pay attention to the direction of the
lava
but even though I got a tuner for the
way I lost one but Larissa only left two
of them too
oh is this more of this
another footsteps but there's nothing
it's not it's not cool so it doesn't
count
so
this should be yeah there's Pages I'm
looking for
oh yeah yeah yeah what do you have here
what an electric trophy with blue neon
trimmings the chin does would probably
flip over this
again about them flipping over it
because it's either way
anything
and
because I still missing James
they must be one of the merchant
hideaways here too
come here stop disturbing apples what's
made to Apples anyway
um
[Music]
let me check again
yeah I still have gems missing probably
and that's the
yeah
heart there must be footsteps somewhere
then
I am what I need
I'm making a footsteps be
hmm
and this there's a lot of place
oh wait there's a room here too
past Eddie's Turf yeah there must be
Footsteps in here and
foreign
[Music]
there's one more area but
yeah yeah
like there's these but those can't open
hmm
[Music]
so
[Music]
maybe there's something else I should be
looking for
not
like how
items that's inside
because
that wasn't what I want anything there's
one more one more area
what these two more areas
actually but
there's this area too
this is the game when I activate that
yeah they might be
um
entrance in this area
dude
[Music]
how much stack
there yeah
[Music]
yeah I am
I like the instant like
actually
delicious and stuff up here
but you're cleaning us but
no I don't want to start over
not over the race
check me out of here
[Music]
yeah probably around race backwards
I wonder how the checkpoint system works
in this game
because there are different ways of
doing uh checking that you are
completing an apps and there's one
um and then and there's one game
come check them both then maybe missed
something in there but I'm pretty sure I
checked that last time I was here
wait where's the
button
right there it was up there
sneaky one
let me see if I press this
and then start changing the other one
I actually Managed IT
because this one like 2DS can
praise the game
where they seem to have checkpoints and
it just checks that throughout the map
and all you have to do is cross over a
checkpoint at in order and after you
have to cross every checkpoint in order
it doesn't matter if you cross any other
checkpoint it only cares about you
pressing the next checkpoint at some
point before it proceeds
paper lab so if you allow perhaps 10
checkpoints you just go around the lab
and go through authentic poison you're
completely left as if it's that but it
also means that you can go around the
track backwards 10 laps and that will
also count as a completed lap
obviously that is so much slower because
you have to go 10 laps and backwards
but it still works
you have no idea where
any secret entrances that's a shame I do
miss the item but that's because maybe
if I can't override them maybe I'll get
access to remaining gems
things with weird that's not very much
anywhere else but
I think I want to take two areas so far
now let's see
that's it
I think I cleaned as far as an hour I
cleared out a sergeant bird area
but I do have to hand over the
[Music]
air medals so I'll go and do that
they're completed the medals
[Music]
oh it's here
of course of course
I took my
I tried
I shouldn't have
silly me
even trying
[Music]
and then go across here I'm trying to
jump too high because telling off the
platform
whatsoever in a way
I am not supposed to go this way I'm
supposed to go
this way
and somewhere here they should be
I think it sounds excuse me yeah he's
we found all of such a bear smells
captain
I'm studying at Fort Soldier these
medals will certainly boost morale
around here I don't think he said
I'm a pain of my word here is the heart
of birds Barracks keep it safe
this is a gleaming silver green army
helmet it's too small to wear though
even for a penguin
we need to get this to the professor
[Music]
to the professor wait does that mean I'm
complete now I probably some footsteps
somewhere I haven't changed it
yeah I got all the items
but I do have some gems missing
okay let's see
if there's any gems this way
as in I mean
this this looks a bit suspicious
please stop doing it I'm trying
to get across here
they go and now here
[Music]
I wanna hit p-headed
give me one of your headphones
want to go yeah I'm pretty sure it
should be footsteps only
will be wrong but
and it's not this does not lick the area
which footsteps anyway
because I've seen a lot of footsteps
anyway
in my travels
I've seen a lot of footsteps there are
some weird things to say
[Music]
okay let's see
nothing there
[Music]
well let's check this out oh hello
just in time or like
good timing I think this is half an hour
that's fine
31 minutes
you haven't missed anything important so
far
I mean aside from Professor having a Sue
and what baby dragon was in there
I mean that's not important
[Music]
business like yesterday
it looked like yesterday
's turning around
oh yeah Sportsman that's very
appropriate for this energy yeah
not like yesterday when I was wasted
yeah they were crazy yesterday
we're talking about
that
yes she's still there to tell me in the
snow already
so it means it must be
I'm just blinding in
I'm looking I'm looking for footsteps
but nothing against a good job at
finding them though
footsteps here
new Swedish this is t-shirt ready for
you
definitely
thanks
excuse me is something here but
I'm just not finding it
weird
yeah
but can I do anything
but this way I'm pretty sure I've seen
some footsteps I'm looking for footsteps
which would lead to some special
so and I should add that
right
I mean it was bird Birds
I don't know how to spell that
[Music]
all right them stand
and in
somewhere and yeah he's saying at the
end of it marked somewhere
they should be up in the chest
I must done something at work last night
because my right arm has quite a bit
right now
maybe it was related to when he passed
out
or is it not that kind of hurting
I was thinking even though he passed out
in your bed you might have
[Music]
and uh or something before you pass that
I already knew yeah I guess it's
I guess that's that I don't know
such a delay
of Vegas
where did you get start moving in the
Darkness
anyways
excuse me sorry
you're killing me there we go finally
that keep killing it
it's that one there should be some
[Applause]
I just know it feels like I tore
something like uh yeah maybe yeah you
did quite happy with work
there may be something interesting to
that
hmm
never blame me hello
wait wait hi Stinky what what I'm not
stinky
Nintendo wait didn't I what was that an
Instagram
what did stinky come from
foreign
related to that
nope nothing Secret in here
like I know what's what I'm looking for
with this special meal I have
but
guess there's just like one such area
per
who needs that water anyway
so let's push this here
oh yes
stop it already
what does this one contain oh yeah I
need one of those these green powder is
a ripening agent for growing bananas
more quickly
it's one of the fertilizer items I need
more
Mr fertilizer
yeah let me go
almost stepped off
[Music]
let me check oh here we go this is what
I'm looking for
virtual Hideaway
now why the screen turned red when you
looked around but I can't look around
without turning red but I can also make
it to turn around when I look around but
I need to
it's for finding those things
I don't know 550 is this the this is the
I think the first game and that is not
around hundreds for the total number of
gems in a you know 11.
[Music]
so I think
that is
a gemstones yes one item missing
so well let's get out of here
because all right make sure I can double
check is to be sure
yeah I'm missing what I think for it
Bentley I was just Gonna Keep Me happy
to just have one shoe but nah not not
good enough for me but yes
he's one of those who needs two shoes
you know a secret yeah
so there's that's pretty profit yes like
the properties disappear because they
walk into the teleporter that makes
sense but where why did they just
suddenly appear that the part doesn't
make sense
this is back
so they must come from another
teleporter that you need a different
item to see
so
spine drawing the round drained
fire drained on his way back home
[Music]
well I need to go today rabbit habitat
because apparently they have a lot of
chests I haven't unlocked yet
and I'm going to steal the items they
have locked away
I hope they don't complain about the
rabbit habitat yeah it's rabbit time
rabbit rabbit time land of Wonder and
amazement well it's amazing
[Music]
so let's see
[Music]
so let's see
[Music]
go yeah let me just open your chest here
steal your money
that's one pink chest this should be
another one and a yellow one
[Music]
find a bit quicker
did take care of these
indeed so let's see
are there yeah there's another one that
makes one then let's take care of that
can I do that
I should be able to do that I should
actually share my skills and do that
with one hand
[Music]
time to style
I can't even press the buttons
[Music]
okay let's see can I do it
just one hat
I'm struggling already
[Music]
nope
well okay
[Music]
smells things
you know yes because he said rabbit
skills
and show me that I can do
[Music]
I couldn't do it
let's see I can do it so I can indeed
oh I can use two heads and then I can do
it
[Music]
but I think
[Music]
I'm happy that you are here
and let's look at the beautiful image
that looks like a backpack if I said
beer or something this is me being weird
that's just English for me it's so nice
that is a very cute image
also only one hit oh yeah let's pretend
it was I only use one hand
I hope yeah I hope you have a good day
today
I thought it was
[Music]
they become small
I like the default settings
on the games
well I wonder about this cleared I'm
still looking for one pink and one
yellow
and these are my own personal notes now
I have not looked up any guides I'm
writing down your own notes is perfectly
fine
okay so here's another they're going the
wrong way they came out the project
and then walked away and then
disappeared
yet my day went well I'm at home and
vibing watched the first Muppet Movie
I haven't seen that one
um
[Music]
consideration Market media but
whenever you might think you mean
somebody
so let's let's Jamestown
now I'm looking for
[Music]
two more chests
[Music]
I don't remember if there was one up
there
but I'll I'll
miss this
whatever that's the boot
okay I'm walking past Bentleys I can
guess I can drop it up and come this is
one of mainly shoes I knew he was clumsy
but two left feet
hey we finally Ben he's climbing here
now we should return around it
doesn't have two left feet
oh yeah it just said that being left
climbing shoe another left climbing is
here
it doesn't look pictures doesn't really
make it clear that it's left
and left though
I guess that's why they should remake
this game in 3D and
make the graphics a bit cleaner
and of course voice acting
let's make that a
project and yeah it must be up here it
must be up here and look there it is
new
oh yeah this is the coloring agent for
giving bananas that extra bit of yellow
goodness it's one of fertilizations this
is the last fertilized ingredient let's
return them to the monkey working
so let's leave
where's the extent
not here there it is
I think I've done I didn't check that
gravity habitat that is done
I'll mark that as
items done as well perfect
so
[Music]
I will go past
the yeti place
oh yeah I know
uh yeah I know that too
and drop off the last
Nathan and get the thing from there
[Music]
and then I guess while I'm here I just
have to look carefully I thought of paw
prints in
being here
happy to see progress but said that
there's no reason to visit anymore
oh
I guess I guess I could make that a
project
that would actually be a fun product
recreating this game in Unreal Engine
in 3D
would actually be a fun project
sadly I don't think I mean if it was
like Sega owning the ownership they
could like fund the whole project but
that's that's kind of what they did it's
Sonic
but since it is
well it was activation I'm not sure if
Microsoft
registered or not
um oh yeah and that makes it easy what's
he up here
that makes things much easier
oh this changed his look
hey manly we found earlier clammy
equipment
you even find my lucky hair to look
goody oh you get too hard for you now
mentions here you go good luck on your
adventure Spyro
these looks like a tiny climate of snow
but it's hard and doesn't melt
when you think it needs to different
answer
so I think I'm done here now
yes 100
items
yeah fine
excuse me I'm trying to talk to someone
yeah
yay yeah this just the birds
first bags that I'm just not been able
to find the missing footballs Prince I
just have to look around they might be
on some Island
I haven't lived carefully I guess
to try to attack me
very rude
oh yeah I don't read something
yeah some changes like yeah
walking up and pressing a button to read
a sign would be nice I mean like uh it
could be like Inspire I think when you
walk up to it the first time it it's
automatic
and that's fine but when you walk up to
the next second time you have to press
the button attack Maybe
I'm
[Applause]
because this because I can write this
thing but this area is closed
it's a closed course
so
it's not like I can go anyway
the only way is towards this scene
and these places
we're laying closed
oh yeah that's it that's not the one
that freezes water
yeah there's nothing else here
wait I can go here first because this is
oh
oh I didn't know I didn't have spikes
oops
oopsie
next
oh there you go that was easy
didn't have to charge it up charge it up
does make it reach further though
but there we go
buying is not going to freeze water
trust me yeah yeah I know
man
okay yeah when it looks after that can
attack which is such a long process
thank you
and this is the end of screens there's
of course nothing else today
oh yes
hey trying to Flap all these value fell
into the water I should help but I think
I'll just watching drowning
I'm penguin and the water is cold
[Music]
aim it I'll wait there's something there
[Music]
no this is just this place
over here
thank you
let me get rid of
a human stuff came up with
okay I'm having a longer range for Gem
up picking
that's the time right
but it's apparently
not that longer range for
he has no loud house I painted nuts the
lover half is snow
it's like a ticket
over half is dirt
I'm really really really trying to look
around this area but
maybe some kind of obvious place
should have looked at
over here
I've been here
foreign
stay dead but
I think that uh
in
are there with it not so confused but
it's really tough
no I know that's extraordinate I always
see she ran into the washing around
[Music]
for some reason I always press
and to live bent thing
[Music]
yeah the scene right back here
[Music]
foreign
no they're in a foot piece here I can
even check like this there's nothing
here nothing special that shows up
um
it feels like I'm exploring the whole
area but there must be some obvious
place I would live there
I haven't checked my Banks and walls but
I mean
president
maybe maybe put princess in here
and we connect we have 10 tickets
nope nothing yet
nothing here
worth
what what and now
um
I'm just making so many noisy now
[Music]
and
my steps so close to the edge before it
shows up
yeah I'm not
I'm not sure which area I'm not
spinducking at this moment if only there
was a map
there must be something because I'm
missing gems
[Music]
and I just and that's the only thing I'm
missing and I just can't find
[Music]
where the secret thing is
and I don't want to look it up but I
really don't have any other options at
this point
yeah
no see that's what I'm looking for
every area I've gotten old gems from has
I have had at least one and I have not
found the one in this area
now it looked and I never looked and
apparently watch it on turned blue write
them and say
uh I see
yes this place is where I see
the spiders do uh butt Slammer
otherwise it's hard to see
[Music]
I guess that's that's the thing to do in
it in the remake make it but slam more
obvious
yeah
my oh my
modify spiral in reignited so he almost
lost about slam
nice
[Music]
I see I see yeah
right
Master puns
of me
was
foreign
[Music]
because because I've been looking I have
been looking and I just
running here
it is a master
hello
I'm happy to see you
nice nice tree to come by
fancy here for mine
but I'm always happy to see you I
understand the
SE times I stream might not be optimal
for you okay
[Music]
I'm busy at work yeah yeah I'm working
when I stay in here I understand it hard
to watch in that case
um but it's going all right um
in case I'm
getting a bit tired of the level that
I'm not finding the missing gems
so otherwise I'm doing fine
[Music]
Sergeant bird is that
[Music]
all right in the wrong way
what did I go
[Music]
everything back now
I'll come on
come on I guess I'm going here often
[Music]
I hope you're having a find this work
it's fine it's
what it can be
oh my God anyway
no I don't accidentally treat you I
didn't mean to
for now is dying
I need to find my way back
[Music]
oh yeah good
which is
fully healed
so I'm not sure
I think I can explore this old area
it's just one two minutes
30
game
I don't think the 20 25 chance I'm here
[Music]
now it feels like I've been over the
whole place but
maybe I haven't
[Music]
yeah that's something else maybe 25
years out in here it must be one of
those teleporters because I had to find
one and I wouldn't be surprised if there
is one in every
part of students
I found a map online
when I wouldn't be surprised there
I never played this before yeah most
people most people don't even know it
right
Pirate game right now and I guess just
knowing like which area the Paw Prints
are in could happen is
some now I'm looking in the correct area
[Applause]
it doesn't show where anything is but at
least you'll know where you looked oh
maybe I should look at that map in that
case
if it's just the birds and yeah that is
world
because I don't want to look at like the
whole world not yet
[Music]
some is okay so
okay so the map should
only be that
specific uh
lemon
that's good
and it should only be a map
[Music]
wait 10 minutes
login otherwise I can't look at pictures
don't load in now
oh this is
this is a map
oh yeah this is actually an island I
haven't been to yet
yeah this is a map that
[Music]
and let me go to that area then
what did I say yeah the map they have on
this page is a map that
I think seasonal flame hat
I should I could show it on screen
give me a moment
Duty
yeah
how do I
wait a minute
I'm messing around at the moment
[Music]
and
about that there you go
uh
so
yes considering
it's not perfect match but anyway there
you go
in
it's basically a perfect match to
[Music]
promote over a pixel like that
yeah
there we go it fits perfectly it's like
so this this is the uh
a style of map they had in
a seasonal flame so I guess there is a
map item you can unlock in the game
as far as I'm concerned using a map for
a search for resources no different when
games
but in case yeah I mean this isn't it
but the thing is this is an in-game map
is like
or someone created this map that's
possibility too
but uh
okay let me check where am I supposed to
get
I should go to that place in that place
I see
um
yeah
okay I can't sound
I guess I'll do this then
yeah
it's like I so because it is the
seasonal flame style of map I assume you
unlock qmf
later on
yeah it's here diamonds
yeah here is
finally with help with the map that
should have been Hindi game
[Music]
yeah finally
finally
whoa
it kind I don't know if you can't can't
look it up but yeah
I didn't
watch it unlocked in my perhaps
completely
no I just need to
wait I can get that because yeah yeah
just do that
Oh no I got a chick oh I got a check for
breakfast and left the
virtual man yeah
[Music]
but while I'm liking is Quick Escape
because I'm done here
anyway now I should move on to the other
three words land cement
yay
which is Monday's mansion
cheetahs but spa and Kangaroo who do not
this place I don't go in here I was
running past this place
come on game
I'm done here
so I I wasn't sure I was going to
complete the game today but maybe I am
maybe I'm going to complete this 100
that would be nice
but if I'm very close I will go over
time
if necessary
yes if people are prepared for that
okay
yes and then
and how many more level ever since they
have sent it is
five I think
I've completed five so
let's strike into a huge machine
now we'll go to my device Mansion first
everything here
what is this no this was just
slight small area that didn't lean
anyway
yeah
a poisonous mushroom at that yeah I
don't think kiram your head into a
personal smart stream is dangerous or so
I could be wrong
it could be wrong
yeah there should be
too pink chests
in the Hall of majesty so I'll go there
and this should be the Horn of majesty
hopefully
all of majesty this should be two
Pinterest here let's go and find them
I really don't like these enemies these
are more enemies that are
so snow
and stuff and get on this
I do need to press this button today
when I can do that by
not
um
see I'm going around here
in front of you
games
I'm going to press this button
stay on the button no
you can't
you had one job
that was stay on the button
[Music]
thank you Cat
foreign
[Music]
some of them are unsafe to touch oh this
is just too tight yeah okay maybe they
are
maybe the eye
slightly paid attention to any paw
prints as me
oh there there they are
unless the chest as well
ah
painting
means I made an old parchment then it's
a primitive drawing of a tea Cherry due
on it oh look at that
[Music]
it's a cute drawing isn't it
it's one of the Chinese Museum artifacts
we need to find for China
good in that case I should go to the
kangaroo who lose after this
and
no I shouldn't
I kangaroo with that did you do yeah
okay that was lost
that means that I am now didn't get
everything
so I have um
[Music]
gems done
and
I'm missing I think
what am I missing
wait a minute come back
[Music]
[Music]
the missing
[Music]
so I'm missing the
art yeah yeah yeah yes yes
now I remember
excuse me let me passed
account
yes I now remember what it was
I remember how I get it
a heart yes he has it
but I will enjoyed this Splendor that is
my not sure I'm lucky for hearts if
you've got a heart which I doubt hand
through it no chance I will lend you the
heart for my Mansion though say it's
three thousand five gems
we don't have enough gems that's why
I don't have enough gems
yeah I'm going to end up on 3500 is that
what's going on
one item missing
okay let's let's annoying
so let's go to the cinema place first
away today
[Music]
and she's in a place she doesn't have a
swimsuit for that
because the uh
pizza place
the the kangaroo place should have
swimsuits just yesterday but if he loves
it again and then the uh the cheetah Spa
should have been yes sportswear because
at least the female cheetah that's our
Expressway including
[Music]
one explosions tummy just like
yes like spider spiders just like pon
pon and it should be oh yes no need to
go to the Outback to find the
missing there you go the pink chest and
then I should also go into my device
Vault for another day
chest
oh yeah
there's one difference buyer here's the
heart be careful with that zombie it's
delicate this looks like a miniature DJ
video but it doesn't look playable it
has Nifty carries all over it we need to
get this temperature
does that mean I have all items
now I'm missing one item that means that
one chest contains the gems and one
chest contains items
and I assume
the chests
in one very involved
and
it should be the same again
where is it where's the museum
in here
I visit your Museum
this doesn't look very even seem
wow
I have completely missed things
[Music]
this handling looks well yes it's worn
but it can't make out the initial
emptying engraved on it
it's one of my Master's teams she wants
one good thing I looked for the museum
this should still be it must be a way
she like give me a hand Lift Me Up
now I don't
drone
nice here somewhere
it's involved
and if I remember correctly there's a
button there
is a path
annoying let's start over
um
there's a button here
and then there's a button here
since it's not about pressing one
pressing the other and then with the
remaining time gets to the vault in that
case I should
have press the
I'm gonna find the first button is
better just press it because if the time
it does run out and I finally find the
second one then I can just press the
second one again and then go back to the
first one
if that makes sense
uh just some games
well
I do still have the
pink chest summer
and paw prints
a recipe just
wait
what
I'll put the item
wait what
what are statues
I really don't even know what you're
talking about
oh there's the person
went off blind
so there's an item missing
I got the pink chest so
here we go
gemstone
one I item missing
for some reason
um
the way to get inspired
okay let's see
hmm
or one item missing did I get any clue
now I have it let me stealing
I'm just silly
I didn't like it
I didn't look at the wrong page or
something
well you kangaroo spice that
the kangaroo place is done
a bit quicker than I thought
how can they be frozen in the air
think it by the Sheila the kangaroo
we get a bad screenshot of Sheila I
guess
let's get this screenshot of her face
she was blinking just so something took
the screenshot
all right
Sheila I will never see you again
no more we can go to place
when
just encourage me to remake this game
that would be a fun project but a quite
a massive project there
I'm going to finish the uh level before
the swimsuit timer runs out
[Music]
right before I say no I'm going the
wrong way
[Music]
and she's wearing
[Music]
a short serpent skirt just like pon pon
has
I love this
because it's super blind with my skirt
don't let the skirt you do your top is
the same color
it's very shiny it's a very shiny skirt
I guess you could redeem the sports bar
and then uh
refund it and then you get like for the
price of one you get half the time of
both arms it's
in that case I don't really need you to
factually
pay for it in the first place because I
can just switch it without the payment
but you know it's the principle I think
plane
so
how to find all the things yet but
there's a pink chest in here
let me check
dude oh this just yeah these hearts and
the chest so this chest contains the
line
maybe the item belongs to this land
otherwise I have to do some backtracking
there's one button where I stay on the
button
oh there it is
writing anything next of the time me
so
this chest here
only yes no
that ain't good
well I don't have any chests left
okay let me go and find the
Footprints then okay please
okay
the person not dangerous Valerie is
flying around
tiny gems
to put any items
like looking to see if there's no secret
Island somewhere
why are they exercising on different
levels like this why are you standing on
top of these weights things and doing
exercising
there's more logical to have a dedicated
place for all the exercising okay
this is that
exercising sparsing
awareness
all the games another level
15 and wrong side
gemstone
items missing
wait how many items two items missing
unless it's going to change now
two items missing
okay
um
that's a bit
this is someone I haven't spoken to yet
because YouTube
do this picture
yeah yeah
I have gooey things yet I'm on my way
like this dude I'm not talking to me
anyway
s
like
I guess doing that routine connect
firmed that you wanted to see that thing
no I'm gonna think about it
anyway yeah I guess that was just going
to visit
I was afraid of that
when
you get to see more of Pokemon stuff
which
[Music]
Let Me Wait and then talk to you
June 2012.
let me go to the banana Savannah because
I got the things I can go pick up that
well that okay kind of this clear that
off
no wait I should go
when I when I
yeah yeah yeah
let me let me go past here yes yes yes
definitely the press to speak buttons
no
I've got so far
yeah that's that's like
about how about I mean that's not like
yeah
I'm having like in invisible checkpoint
so
as you progress at least it's safe for
homewards kind of thing
so so when you die you just respawn
close to where you die
think it's a good idea so did I speak to
you
no I think I need this
I don't think it was there's no one here
anyway
so I think it was this snow white is
around here
I need to go through here first
RGB one one yeah dude
yeah
completely different voice
foreign
foreign
[Music]
take good care of it
it looks like a small banana
when it's hot and shiny not good eating
I know some people can say it
this means that banana Savannah is done
thank you
I oh well
um oh yeah yeah the swimsuit timer is
over so that's all three and anhydrates
oops I clicked already
foreign
bye toilet water level
yes definitely away from this level I'm
a banana I'm a banana
wait a minute
hmm
suspicious
if I saw a banana move I would be
where's the
right Beach my natural Beach
[Music]
that's the beach I was going for
this beat
I can only think of the Peanut Butter
Jelly Time dancing banana
oh yeah and yeah I see I see you are
bananas
I thought I
you are a cute banana
I mean I should just go in here first
because I think yeah I saw
Prince but I need like
I was a bit silly
so
that's fine you just dive straight into
the properties
don't worry just to feed this
immediately
um because apparently they are immune to
Flame
but they are spinning
but if I touch them while they are
spinning
they start spinning and my flame attack
is then active killing them
they mean instantly
where am I going
why is it in here I think yes what's in
here
and yeah I've been lacking the hard time
just surviving I'm happy you're vibing
and yeah I I some when I sometimes when
I was just playing
I gotta
I'm 28 sometimes for long periods of
time and sometimes I write a lot anyways
like here
's what I found this sign and just and
suspected it was something I had to pick
up to get the power up
but I never visited this actual place
and this seems to be the most expensive
of them all
but according to the game these pink
looking gems that one
is apparently
purple
so
yeah
Denise was professor's secret now which
I would just call it women's lab
gemstone how about Atkins
okay items done as well here we go
and
foreign
thing left to do
kinda
it's a little grotesque that all the
enemies sleep behind their eyes when
they flipped yeah that's kind of an
initial reaction to this game especially
like that
then the eyes are just here staring at
spiral
yep
that's um
it is a mission
it was a bit uncomfortable when I
started playing but I guess I kind of
got history
and the eyes continue to participate
when she's talking on the ground yeah
that's um
I know let's go in here
because there should be
four chest in here and I'm missing four
items
no wait
no no let's
there's only two items in here the four
chest two of which has gems two which is
items I assume what kind of
things that what I'm missing is
[Music]
sorry let's see so I'm done with this an
important thing I have collected this
thing and then then
so here I'm missing one of these items
which I assume is in this world this
land
and yes I'm missing that which
presumably hopeless in this world too
but then push
yeah so I get the item from thieves and
item from Cheetah please and then I buy
the item from money bags but there still
leaves one item missing in the cheetah
area which I know anyway it is
well
I wasn't moving like this but I guess I
guess
[Applause]
okay let's see if I can find this sweet
three chests in this place
get bombarded with bumps
I think you need those enemies so they
didn't kill me
go
wherever I learned now
okay
um
yeah it was supposed to be one in there
we need to have buttons again
oh there's one yeah chest
wow this bag of colorful fun turns speed
blue spider
we're sending us by the time I think
[Music]
I went across one yellow chest off my
list of notes
sound
speaking music
I have a time limit
where is the other button blue spider
yeah this money pick up the
blue eyes another one
Greenspire
this stuff makes a green spider what's
up with that
well I guess this and here's another one
and this is stamps that's not good
that's so there's only one Jam test yeah
because now I just got these two that's
not what I wanted I wanted it is missing
items my quests
don't worry this doesn't make any sense
um
oh there is a button wait a minute
let's see if I can do this then
about the most here
doesn't mean that this one also contains
gems
yep
that means that I have missing gems but
I am stunned
so
let's find the food banks and
that's what I'm missing at the moment
where the foot planes are
you should for presumably be in this
area because that's kind of a lot of
footprints have been
in the other areas in like that the
footprints are located in the main area
of the game
the main area of the land
bone smells like no I like to come and
walk straight into that thing anyway
hmm
there's lots of pounds here
all right trying to kill those enemy
sister please spawn
come on spider you can get it you can do
it
uh
and
I'm gonna switch it in
and go to a different area
foreign
Ty before
let's switch okay let's switch you again
yeah yeah
he's more making shortcuts around there
why haven't I been
like I've just seen some of those prints
by now
in my friend I haven't been to but
[ __ ]
I can check this area but there's other
areas did not have
Footprints in
some areas
nope
my daughter
and so
yeah
I am
when that happens
the shape is kind of
just outside the active so there's
nothing
maybe those enemies actually don't
respawn right I was confusing everything
those birds the university response but
the person
don't attack you so
there's like this initial area before
like the introduction area everybody
gets real earlier and although I just
have to have that but none of those
areas have had the problems in those
areas only in the main areas
what
maybe there isn't any Paw Prints but
what else were the missing gems being
these 50 missing gems
oh okay
let's see if you can kill each other
come down here
yeah they don't drop anything so I
wouldn't why wouldn't they respond or
did I get that idea I saw they dropped
something
as soon as they drop their bombs so you
can use the Bombay mix it up with the
birds the birds respond but they don't
attack
[Music]
yeah I'm getting confused but it's worth
it too
just like the sergeant first world
oh
there we go I found it
weird sheep noises yeah
there we go
yeah it's found
so let's make this cake
gems done okay let's let's go let's see
every Memorial and see what I've done
then
I'm sure it's saving up
Dragon Shores 100 yes
Priory Library
okay
I'm launching of damage my library
foreign
checked the forefoot prints in here and
have I checked for
and I want more
there's a missing one item
and 25 gems
one item
let's see who has left Footprints in
here I don't see any no ads
with another hour
so
uh no I didn't
yeah
okay
yeah okay this is the introduction area
I'm not sure I just double checked there
is no problems there isn't there's this
interactionary all right
I'm not sure what else would call it an
introduction area but
[Music]
okay I think the Poppins yeah I think if
I take this one over
I think the problems are over here
yes they are
okay the remaining 25 gems should be
yep
so let's name this area
that's what I believe this is our name
oh I love the puppies
yeah I think that was one of the
problems
so um
just checking
there's no additional Island out here
doesn't seem like it
so
Mary Library
is
gemstone
uh one item missing as current
[Music]
so
so I need to where can this item be
we had quantity
let's see
but I really should have gone
secret place I really should have gone
to the bathroom during that break it's
I realize I have to go so I have to go
so I will be much give me 19 minutes
so
all right
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
let's see minutes
um
welcome back thank you I feel I feel
welcomed
and backed it
maybe I should like talk to all the
fairies and see if there's Affairs
forgot to talk about you that's an item
to give me
how's the machine doing does it work
yeah it's kind of slowing clunky but
it's getting the job done
[Music]
like that
almost put too much I guess maybe I
should talk to the fairy
um
I was still crying first
I might need to talk to the very outside
the
that one
it was possible that I missed a chest
because
I've only had oh yeah I missed this one
there's missing attempt
it's a light or again oh pretty colors
it's mesmerizing this is probably full
power it is
oh yeah now you can go to the cheetahs
anyway
so
the Prairie Library is done now let's
prepare Library done let's check them
next down here we have this setting
empty which I sent was done
and then I'll just make sure it goes It
goes to everyone man
[Music]
make sure I do
birthmarks done
and that
don't click on fun
see very skilled I'm missing gems and
items rabbit habitat done and I need to
visit them anyways
vanilla Savannah done
and
you can go to hoodoo style that means no
more kangaroos
funny Max Mansion I still have to pay
for that thing
cheetah spot Spa I can return an item
but it's just getting hard I'm not
getting anything that's pretty
progressing one and professor's secret
lamp not just any of them
and trying to sing clothes
and I was shut up
[Music]
I think not done
Chateau everybody tell
James missing
uh the items missing okay
so I go there
uh what's the quickest way back
[Music]
I forgot about his shadow at the top
or something
let's see um
I can find that place again
and yeah
the only four worlds left then
back into the crypto world
I've completed three six nine worlds
four left
these 13 words in this game that doesn't
seem like a good amount
that's
[Music]
very fancy
where's the entrance
wasted in the hands
[Music]
to your shuttle hey I know this
short term quick turns Victor's main
gate
so yeah this is the entrance area so
it's look what
pop means in the next area
and
chest still I guess
[Music]
so I will take this sound
stop that you're killing me
wait
why should I do this this way
yeah let's blow up be safe
oh I didn't work
there is
nope
all right let's put this one around in
this joint that's believe me
but here are cats
do you have to mean but I only really
need one
of that attack reaches no spider why did
you have to take that one extra step
because it's not like you can stack
it in case you don't cause any more
trouble
that's why I wanted to fly
or is it like
can you lie
no you cannot push too much
had to try
but if spider wants to when spider can't
play so
in that case you can just fly
and let's see let's get up here
there's the other button maybe I should
check the
no
that's not why you should have gone
and just check one device more
so I have missed anything
wasn't it
I went up there
what happened this one too okay okay
you have the big green gem spider
there's a lot like two thousands or
something
Sparks picks up the M because because
when you
when because what's spark what sparks
does is that he goes to the gym speeds
it up and throws it aspire
because when spiders touches gems
I think it collected somehow
spice the Sparks picks up one of those
huge gems throws his bio and
that's the end of space
anyway
oh yeah this is
so funny oh I missed this one please
there we go
spider pancake yeah that's test or
something
the version Hideaway
oh
mink gems
but I still have gems outside this area
this is one of the world old lands I'm
not fully
there we go
that means Jim's done but two I can
still missing
okay
how do I get the items for
defeating Ripta
I don't know how I would don't need your
hearts to do this bam
no I didn't want to walk in
wait maybe there's an area in here I can
[Music]
Nike
like I don't have all the
gems yet about the hearts like I still
don't have this one
and I can't pick up this one
that's still too few Hearts still my
Harmony gems to have
this house of 2017.
now I need the remaining gems yeah I
said
yeah
um again
starting to get confused
the missing items
yeah I'm very confused
so let's let's let's check what what am
I missing I'm missing the crowbar
and I am missing
that's the only thing I'm missing so
that must be the thing in
the uh
[Music]
yeah one is the hearted out there might
be the Crowbar in that case
so I just uh
chests that I've not found in the
cheetah again
and the timer for
it's been like I don't know how long 20
minutes
with those cheetahs
will always be cheap
[Music]
oh it's been working he those cheetahs
won't be cheating
yeah when I'm confused to get tired
you see this with their soft fluffy
bellies
how do you know that
they are well trained
and so they have
hard
muscles
now that wasn't the way I was supposed
to go
the Pharisees
they're so strong that they're very hard
[Music]
okay now it's time to put on proper
clothes
for this area
so I look like one of them
I don't even know if this is like the
international even affairs
tests
these are really small area so
yeah definitely not missing anything
here
I have proper uniform yeah sports bra
and skirts
can't be more profit than that
foreign
[Music]
lenses
[Music]
there's a black lenses the rims slow
like now they're too small to wear them
yes now that item is found
don't really like starting now I'm gonna
have to adhere and I changed it when I
tell missing
okay which way
is the last item from the island here
outside
I I
don't remember Hunter being so much into
being Heap and cool but I guess you can
still care Beats
yeah okay if I enter this area
then I paint this area
does it say my checkpoint here
that means I can't believe
she just stands at watching spider fly
away
no no I didn't I didn't think he was
going to I don't want to skip
saying yes just since
nope nothing there
right
always pressing yes that's my thing
can I no I can't even press B T
automatically rejected
that would be too convenient
it's just that when the text appears I
want to oh wait here it is I'm stupid
and this girl bar is strong and light it
makes that the initials empty on it it's
one of the master systems
finally
you know what this means
she's a sports bar is spotless
I had to make that church I'm sorry
lunch time what
laughs
it's deep stenstein
and
look at my time and does it looks like
lunch time
you eat lunch 18 o'clock
I'm not I'm not going to judge you even
though um at the moment
[Music]
I'm not going to judge you but eating
lunch at 18 is very weird
[Music]
okay she's just usually sleeping yeah
you have slightly different sleeps I
changed from mine
slightly different
dude
yeah this camera Maps
and another funny prank
range landscape
yeah it should be in the
don't want a passage here I think the
entrance should be
and the Remake kind of wants to
introduce the map
uh level map and a world map
yeah this area would have incorrectly
flowing lava balls Lava Falls are great
but the rivers are angry
I got some coffee on this way oh nice
nice okay let's see where we can find
the
up here
your place is so weird looking
I didn't mean to do that
wait hold it up we're guessing
oh here
oh there it is about it
let's switch fires I can actually attack
them properly
no not nothing
okay
there we go
yeah missing gems and the missing
it's down there those paw prints are
walking very seriously

looking for my tubes aren't you and then
we found another Tuesday again Oh Happy
Day my pleasure too thank you very so

back and watch us a massive see works is
Magic

soft and Light
just like a rabbit
we need to get this to the professor
no wait I haven't got a lot of things

I mean yeah so these are one second
because
and then like outside of 11.
so how do I get
do I need to fight this riptoe because I
guess it really exists
one of the two
you one of because I got one heart from
him before
second yourself
fight team
this is a heart and it would be final
and it's the final like
well I have still before and I didn't
know what I was talking about
it's what difference it gets for being
here related to playing
that's correct the harsh punishment
[Music]
I'll let you before I eat these planes
I mean I feel like I'm quite a test here
and I feel like I'm really lifted
and I've even been here
and there are chests
appointment now that's right
because it could be more chastisists
[Music]
next that's
not what I expected to happen
that was a bit of a surprise
yeah having the right stick or digging
around and being able to look around
while moving would be so much noisy
quality of life insurance
like what's the point of
this why is that why are they too bad
[Music]
yeah it doesn't mind me moving
it's a
wrong thing
when
okay so just
try to defeat Rift of them
but I can't find
for any other item would be
there are two heads so the mouse has
some one to two here yes they're not
that alone
until I moved away one of the heads but
they moved their heads back that's fine
which doesn't seem to have anything to
do with your heart
really not a case of me great stuff so
professor
foreign
let me
stop that thank you
okay
um I have this certain problem
understanding this but as well
oh it worked
ah you crawling in a tank my device must
see poison
you can't even think I have a taste of
your own when it's in your purple
peasants
oh excuse me
okay so I can't do that
but
for me because it's hard to do
um
let me try that again
can you like
from standing at the angle second
shooting I mean

different attacks then
right
ah no enough what do you remind me do
wait what did I make you do
enough bombs on this thing
I don't know
oh wait
oh wait did I
contribute to you

just keep survive

correct position

surprise there

could have defeated with the scenes I
earned the
since I earned electricity wait wait I
learned the
yeah I learned electricity power up last
which was when I put up out of the
electricity things
and then I ordered it because yeah
that's what I could go to the cheetah
place that unlocked my option to go to
ripto and defeat him
which I could have done at that moment
