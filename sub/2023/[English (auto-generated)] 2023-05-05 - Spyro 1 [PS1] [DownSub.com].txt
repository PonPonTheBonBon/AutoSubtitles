hello
and
I see that kitten is here
and this one watches so
starting with some hydrate
another great video I can't wait to hear
your voice cute voice now I'm here now I
can hear my cute voice
the expired
[Music]
and is it doing this thing again I
thought I fixed that
nothing is working the way I want but
this dream hasn't picked it up at least
not yet so
let me
just take a quick look at why it didn't
say my controls and we'll see if more
people sharp or something I don't know
it says that it's using
oh it's that thing that's enabled for
some reason
okay okay but it's fine it's fine
what I would do like to do
but
hello Stella welcome
it's time to go back to the
old PlayStation 1 version of spire
it was because I was going to play into
the dragonfly but that one it runs so
terribly on my PlayStation 3 so that's
not going to happen
how are you friends I feel
I couldn't feel that better if I could
play the game I wanted to play so
but I am happy to see
that's my friends here on Twitch
uh hug you sad little high command I
should add one
I definitely need to add one
that looks weird in there on this on the
screen chat this next place the
it did my control my reignited control
works in this game good except the
center camera button doesn't work
because there is no Center camera I'm
gonna give this this
oh my
OG spiral yeah
because this game runs better than
yeah I had to do dragonfly which is
running too I think
that I completely Square last time I
played this game for four hours so now
we're going out with my favorite world
dreamweavers
I mean where do you have this one
I'm gonna like when I make lunch sounds
good
see people I recognize
people who are so nice
I'm at work and we'll come back when I
finish a report happy streaming
okay
let's see I don't know what to say
because there's not much left of this
game now
should I continue on the second game
maybe I should
you know my password just skip straight
to the third game actually on a static
reasons
[Music]
because I never played the second game
as a child
is a child Essen
[Music]
I don't remember how old I was when I
first played fire
but yeah only the first in third games
my dream memories is my favorite kind of
wanted though so maybe I stay it is my
favorite basically the Homeworld itself
is my favorite
[Music]
the uh
depends on how important that report is
[Music]
that Flamingo come on
I missed expression
so
let's listen to this
welcome to the dreamweavers young one
while chasing nasties minions in this
world you must expect the unexpected and
prepare for what is not there
I don't think there's any
prepare for what's not there I don't
think that's something
thank you
but there are some unexpected things
that I can create a union
I love the castle I think
oh yes I'll skip the level
got distracted by the chat
it's a nice distraction
or maybe escape to this level quickly
because I think this is one of the top
favorite levels in the game
there
and I
I do like how it has been changed and
reignited
thank you
not mentioning that this time I was
distracted
[Music]
as long as you don't have any
importances today
maybe I should yeah I should try to
basically do
you know that like how um I I usually
think through this level
let's rescue
[Music]
all right
oh you can't uh yeah these enemies you
cannot charge which you can do in the
United
[Music]
I should keep that on my account because
then I cannot see the only reason
[Music]
you go
foreign
fairies are always on your side Spyro
always there's not a sing of evil fairy
I'll inspires for you
there's never been an evil fairly
inspired
or I said
so
goodness
you can still not judge this I will
never die
that's what's happened when you play too
much reunited
[Music]
nice goodness
yeah no
[Music]
I can't cut in in what
hi hi Izumi
I think I got it you know what
the Mystic Lots
of God
welcome Izumi it is me
[Music]
that you might get a nice friend oh yeah
do it too kind
of God
how are you
I'm definitely much better now
you are making me happy
[Music]
is that big step by Street the other one
[Music]
that's the key
at pads
ah Spyro thanks
supercharged will get you to new places
here in lofty Castle too
see where it takes you no it's super
shot I think what's the strong a lot of
things is wrong I don't want to get
through everything but apparently I do
okay here's some technicalities
so
I have
uh basically
I love to say that but basically I have
a backwards compatible PS3 I wanted to
play Enter the dragonfly
and there for some reason
doesn't want to run on Hardware it's
doing emulations that's it's running
terribly second
[Music]
ah
I love you because I need to learn how
to pronounce oh all right yeah you got
me you got the spelling
so let's see
the pronunciation is
careful pronunciation
if you want
you can't speak if you want a big
plastic
I'm sorry I hope everything gets better
thank you for releasing me
yeah you're welcome
hydration hydration manifest disappears
because I need to learn how to pronounce
I can do that one okay
[Music]
hey
[Music]
I would say
something like that
it's just me is this platform closing
you really had it because
I don't believe I will be able to do
this job
I was wrong I was wrong
okay
everything will again
well my option is in that case
to jump off
my option in that case is that I somehow
get a higher performance computer
and then I just emulate it on my
computer instead I mean I'm emulating It
Anyway technically
and that way but it feels a bit silly
because I did have a PS3 which has PS2
Hardware which it should be able to
a bit annoying
maybe there is a way to solve a four
City to the hardware but it really
should do it automatically
I don't know how how to do that
ah I hope you have the best day and the
best weekend because it's super
wholesome and cute and nice
you're the one who is super awesome
captain
and nice and perfect you're always
trying to
make me happy
and everyone else happy too
that's so nice of you
I don't know what to say
[Music]
this I mean they added a lot I'm not
sure if you can get up on that one
anyway I'm just experimenting ability
oh wait that wasn't the password
[Music]
of my cat the emerge yeah yeah I made it
so the chat removes all the bases
between those so you if you have
an emote that is supposed to be long
and
which I
don't have one of at the moment hey they
went up here correctly on screen at
least
yeah now they emerged
weird
it lasting perfect
one too many
[Music]
it's yeah it's made of five
points six
but yeah it does match the hearts
so the hearts are because in the chat
the heart looks broken and it looks like
there's sand and losing each other or
something but now that's not the
intention
okay that's beautiful
that's cool
all right all right
[Music]
um
an octopus I'm why am I falling off me
seven so much what am I doing
I think I paid for with Channel points
again this one
but I don't have the full thing
well and I can't access it from here
[Music]
what
oh well
oh yeah that sounds now only five of
them hit on screen
okay it's actually changing the size of
them depending on how many you post
which I think I should fix so it tries
to fit everything on front line
because it's a bit silly if it always
puts one on the second row
so yeah that that I have to correct
[Music]
well I did use a template to make the
chat work a lot of the design of it I
have fixed myself
yeah
why am I 40 of 11. what am I doing
I have not been this terrible before
I have played through many levels I've
played in many words without dying last
time
yeah thank you for the extra life I'm
doing terribly now
I'm too nervous or something
a lot of people here
probably because I'm also happy it also
didn't help like because
it's demo streaming there was only two
people
whatever they want but now there's seven
people it's quite it's quite the
difference in
like it feels different
I tried to
[Music]
as it says something about page at the
the pon pon altar is provided by
someone else I'm not
when I didn't write but I did try to
draw that emote
[Music]
and then
you're doing is okay except when I'm
falling off 11 but thank you
now now I'm on the ground
[Music]
okay
[Music]
oh that was close
but uh I need this one I think so I know
you're supposed to take this pass and
then to jump down there but
and I I like the pasta I
think
it's weird
oh I also see that the
[Music]
amount broke you can apparently not post
emotes in replies
I forgot to fix that
with
I guess I have to write it down list of
things to fix
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
one
where's the killing one
is it this one I thought I wanted to
take care of this one yeah it's not this
one
green chat oh look at this
so many modes I love chatting with the
notes it's hard to read them sometimes
yeah
let's see hyper times three
happy giving flower
when they have names
flower
blankie oh yeah all right it's a blank
you think
it's fun I like the
Addams at least
I need I need some pump on one so I can
use them
dancing
in Spanish
[Music]
but I is that supposed to say armed
and he packed him
I want to say it's a rat but then we saw
that like
like a cat but I don't know what that
means
a chinchilla
I I have issues with spelling some words
no you're spelling it your own way
it's not misspellings it's just yellow
spelling
I have to understand focused me too
it is a chinchilla oh nice
love nothing
[Music]
ah I mean I don't know if he's talking
cheetah but
the fools I'd rather Flame the fools now
you're thinking
I mean the name is chin tell us
[Music]
I haven't seen it
but the name is chintella yeah yeah
[Music]
yeah
it makes so much sense
I need help
[Music]
I oh that was a bug
what's up I guess I'm [ __ ] honest so if
you interrupt Sparks
somehow after eating the first butterfly
when you should he should turn blue that
somehow cancels
I tried to flame that nothing happened
good
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
and some people think the bonbon in well
my name thanks for ensuite
thank you for releasing me
but that's not the case it is just bun
bun from bunny
his friend was hiding behind the step
what's up
comes from
Pom-Pom
[Music]
-poms pom-poms
again
no I didn't want to sleep out
what is a bonbon I don't know
bum bum
we have bum bum in Brazil
it's a chocolate sweet yeah I think is
it Bonbon like
used in Romance languages to refer to
sweets or something
[Music]
but no that was a thing when I made made
up the name
there we go that's how you did
yeah
it's just going back
hydration
but what is your Bonbon wait what is my
mom
I'm going to look at Bonbon I heard that
name before
see what you can find
the report badge
[Music]
I'm getting attacked
foreign
[Music]
ends here but here's more
there is much more
oh come on
stop attacking me
it is not allowed to attack the purple
dragon
what was the question more like
what does this in your name standpoint
did they start this week
[Music]
that's another person I don't know
[Music]
a bonbon is a small chocolate and fixed
I didn't even think it instructed
I've eaten those before but never knew
the name of the name is
I don't know what the name of it is in
Swedish so don't ask me to translate
into Swedish because I wouldn't think
anything like that like a product name
in that case doesn't really have a
translation
unless it's like
thanks Spyro I'd love to help you catch
nasty but I'd really hate being trapped
in Crystal again don't worry the only
one who's gonna be trapped is him
so it's been ranking is completely fine
with spiral going against
ignorc
he doesn't want to give any like he just
doesn't want to appreciate trap once and
therefore that's why you're always
listens water somewhere that is as a
special activity maybe it's
or maybe it's here actually
[Music]
it's like here
no oh it's insta kill
what
I did I wouldn't jump it down if I knew
that was the case
it's French
ah says
I'm more like Mama
I am a Pom-Pom bomber
[Music]
okay
[Music]
rabbit in Swedish is coming
we don't really have a wet food
[Music]
it's just
thank you for releasing me
more
I don't know he was there was the
feminine of of Bomba
right
[Music]
now
I'd like to Spanish
[Music]
I am taking another damage at the moment
[Music]
by the rocket
is that why am I standing here I am here
for a can use progress
hey guy
yum
golden oops
but I got the gems that's what counts
that is what is counting
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
that's me alright
me all right
for shooting I mean
[Music]
hello
[Music]
I quickly exited that level I kind of
missed 20 gems but I guess I'll
have to be marketing to find them again
I'm kind of hunting why can't you jump
into the portal
because he that doesn't spiral jump when
you enter product okay so I'm using 20
Jets
those are so hard to avoid
do you want the
Dodge them like that come on
they're so quick
they are quick very quick
okay so if I
yeah she's the second one therefore it
stays green and then it turns yellow
immediately
[Music]
quick little bunny
[Music]
oh yeah
[Music]
I don't know the
I don't have the ability or knowledge
how to mod a PlayStation 1 game
and I assume it would be different
depending what engine is running
even if it is engines this
point in the development of games
more like the the way you mod it would
be different for every game
back to the SIM
but yeah
replacing spider weights with quantum
that would be something
why am I missing normal Legends
if they are now up here
will they appear up here
[Music]
[Music]
oh oh hello answer welcome
welcome everyone
welcome
our new name we're supposed to show up
I guess my custom chat doesn't work
perfectly but hello
nice to see you here
I was upset
this is my the very first phrase I'm
experiencing and I don't know how to do
it what to say what you did
foreign
yeah I don't speak Spanish
[Music]
really yeah I mean I've only been
streaming
for a month now so
well you can speak write Spanish and I
can't remember it's reading it
but I think you know
Manito
cool whichever you prefer
I think you know English
thank you
when you aren't part of the room
no yeah
when
yeah yeah what do you usually do I guess
you should not raise the husk like
that's nice I'm glad to be here first he
he you are a good first lady
first right yeah I guess it's all right
yeah okay okay so when when people
liberated he basically ask them like
even though I was I was on your live
stream before I said it's a bit awkward
that way too
so
I'm gonna see my voice I'm getting
about two things
[Music]
therefore it's so nice that
that you showed up since I know you
and usually nice and kind
[Music]
are you there
not the one that pronoun is
[Music]
should I yeah I should probably clean
the rest of his work
hello Spyro nicely done I'll be done
what I've toasted that nasty nork
no thank you but you're but you're still
free to basically say
[Music]
and
they oh my I usually don't speak this
much I guess my voice isn't really used
to it
um
and then also
I didn't do
complete
right work whoa
I've
yeah
and sad has done I've only been there
when she's been drawing it so I don't
know if she does more
she got this job very nice and it's a
very cozy place
which I like to be there
yes
[Music]
so
[Music]
so cute
[Music]
that's a
[Music]
and I would try to expand the I'm
risking too many dragons the fools you
see in this world are invincible but
that does not mean they shouldn't be
attacked
sounds all right to me
[Music]
so I've tried to come up with different
regimes to have I don't have any sound
readings
I'm personally not a fan of this so I
don't think I would add anyone any at
least not anytime soon
[Music]
oh
I did not get spine
[Music]
so I think I
made everything
[Music]
well everything I need to counter for at
least
[Music]
so let's go and do a flight level
because I like playing lemons not like
most people
yeah I would go in here
I got to go to prepare the have a nice
dream thank you for sharing up it's
really
they're really fun to see you a really
fun to see the first yeah
[Music]
bye bye bye bye
um
yeah
[Music]
[Music]
I don't know what to say
this is supposed to stand here
have
[Music]
I see I've like lemon
let's see this is now and yeah this is
this
this is one with the lights
oh this one was high up
[Music]
oh crashes
the
class yeah
yeah you were supposed to say you were
doing that I hope you're not
I've stayed here for too long
[Music]
let me stay you have to be
[Music]
[Music]
constantly thinking
there you go
wait a minute
I miss that chest
detail this is Chester
I don't know
I was confused why is the game
continuing
I wasn't paying attention
oops
okay
oh I think I think I know which chest I
missed
I missed that one
it's it's behind
heat pump fun moment when I Faith that's
right
[Music]
maybe I mean
why am I missing a chest
and why did I go to the middle one first
oh
oh
the middle
I'm a silly kitten yeah you are a silly
kitten okay
because I am not feeling this stuff
bon bon
a bunny bun bun
[Music]
almost like a bun
then
I can sing too much
my pronunciation
the greatest
when and why do I use them
pretty
get that one
add one
and I take all these
that one
oh it's behind here [ __ ] it
but there it is
yeah I think I'm saying bang because it
is bunny
but it's supposed to be bon bon because
it's it's that's how it spells
foreign
[Music]
but it's supposed to be Pom-Pom if you
want to do it correctly but you don't
because I haven't heard people saying
more like pom pom or something like that
and that is as far as I know that
because in some dialects of English
the four and ah I'm a great that's that
thing these sounds
have merged into a single sound
and if you speak and dialectical
converge these designs you wouldn't be
able to you might not be able to hear
this
you can of course practice but
it can be can be hard
I'm still wondering what happens if you
complete two of those very quickly after
each other
[Music]
you did it yeah it took a few attempts I
just lost that chest
[Music]
I had no idea why
whoa
wait where where am I I'm in
three lemurs
now I'm drowning
let's go to the last level
before the
horsepower
I was going to say that if they enlarge
just as you charge them you can actually
knock them when they're pink I've only
been able to do that with the those
brown ones
see
hey little
it's by Saving successful
are we fine
oh you kiss me
you're trying to eat me
divide too slow
too slow
[Music]
it does have his sparkling from the blue
that just doesn't show it
Haunted Towers
that was the name of Atlanta for some
reason from happening
19477 out of twelve thousand
this is a nice lemon it's probably why
right
like this one because like two of the
top favorite lemons are in this one
and I I do like me
magical theme of this it's not that
it's more like
colliding
falling down into the sun
it's not there it's nothing it's more
like a dream
theme and Magic
combined with lucky
fairy tale aesthetic
[Music]
[Music]
not fine it don't hurt
because this game doesn't have that
countdown
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
okay let's get rid of more
[Music]
oh yeah I use the superpower superpower
use it on a mushroom
really make sure that
[Music]
it's no longer exists
[Music]
wait why doesn't pick up this one oh it
does
the range feels shorter
[Music]
oh
[Music]
I want
the sound they make right
I don't know
you that wasn't the cute sound that was
a weird sound
oh I don't pay the power
I don't got the power
I'm weird sorry no you don't have to be
sorry about what you like
be sorry about what you like
I should make a mod changing the dresses
of the purple very true
[Music]
it's a nice dress
oh gosh come on
Chris
hey Spyro all dragons know there's magic
in the fairy's kiss see what it can do
to your power of flame
and now they're already talking about it
is this fan does nothing to my friend
I'm not noticed a difference
[Music]
that was terrible
thank you
that was terrible 18.
[Music]
and that was terrible terrible three
yeah I'm silly
con
the the pile of
armor is gone
you're silly and cute
I do like being cute and see there I
guess
[Music]
it's
that was the wrong door
I want to be a cute bunny
that's why whenever
hypother is more like question
I will make myself
okay I will probably basically Buy I
said it again basically I will buy
myself
and pants
and then
come attach
bunny ears
our design
we look like
I don't know I would put it on my head
if she got a yellow dress
[Music]
fill it with
the limitation of the plantation
[Music]
that's so cute it will be cute I hope
it's cute
I mean a pair of hair shouldn't be too
complicated
I do have some experience
I think that does a nice normal okay
so this is an infinite power by the way
yeah
it's very cute and I would of course
show it
I mean I wouldn't
you've become a master of the
supercharge great work
I don't like to be on camera
but I could show a photo of it
I'm streaming
can I pick up everything
down here
I already four of them you only need
three
one for green one for two and then one
for yellow what the fourth one for
if you take damage while you're
one thing
hold your voice Here Comes Spyro but I
want him to prevent it you'll soon have
the opportunity to battle the one who
matters most nasty norg
y
I saw this name because that's what the
interviewer says and started again
and which I probably had tons of two
people
the GM as well as km that English has
and English Max stick G and K the silent
before an end
you're free but I don't need your keys
Swedish does not make it silent
[Music]
so therefore
[Music]
it's pronounced so
nasty Network
if you want pronounce it
[Music]
I mean you wouldn't be able to come in
Swedish
like if you would just read the words
but with sweet pronunciation the
pronunciation
if you take the English word in life
which in Swedish is almost the same but
in Spanish
so you would say
I'm actually I once had someone tell me
that that's not possible to say that it
is not possible to say
sounds cute
but obviously it is possible to say
clean because I say it
unless I'm impossible
he's his butt is smoking
and the like English word you have a
gnome and it's in Swedish it's okay no
one
[Music]
never said
but you're so smart I mean I'm only
speaking Swedish I don't think that
cancer is smart
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
anyway I like it you like everything
[Music]
I know
or should I say Ike no
[Music]
anyway time to confront
Jacquees that's not how you related but
whatever
Jack Jack
or something
yuck
don't forget about them
[Music]
yeah I should probably clear this
[Music]
what kind of creatures are this anyway
[Music]
and then I will go back
because this level has a few parts
and I realize this is awesome I forgot
about this boss
uh yesterday but this bus is another one
with father
[Music]
it's making weird noises
oh yeah
I need to be better at this now
made me stick twice
what
oh
okay
here you go
I got distracted by the treasures
so I need to do this again
I can do this
okay why isn't he turning
this game is weird sometimes
getting this price by treasure yeah
easily distracted
there we go
with me
what's the solution thank you for
releasing me you're welcome
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
it is nice to take to you in one plane
I don't think it's possible to take
maybe he can't take three three three
in one plane
maybe we can take a tree in my airplane
that was okay
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
and now I'm too high up
okay I'm getting the hang of this
there you go
and these pillars become this is a sick
pillar
this is taller and thinner for some
reason
this pillar is even thinner than even
taller so and this pillar is a thing
it's
it disappears
[Music]
sure you can say
foreign
like that that has nothing to the same
either
you don't need to save to get that
checkpoint you get a checkpoint if the
platform you step on lights up
there you go
[Music]
okay
and then
I have the key
so that was close
[Music]
time
[Music]
yeah we don't have to wait the key
animation is kind of slow
I think they made it quicker in
reignited but he reignited you cannot
cancel it
like you can in the first thing
which is better
I mean being able to translate is better
than not being a good thing of course
any advice before this battle advice hmm
a wise Dragon once told me aim high in
life but watch out for flying boxes
any advice before this
Bell
internet
speed foreign
[Music]
we're watching so many different
streamers
chatting with people chatting with
streamers and people in the comments
I mean great advice yeah I need to watch
out for this box
I still don't remember which
Rollins
excuse me
no I don't
this is a friend
this is a place for all ages I still
think I recognize your name
but I'll take that back
nice save and now I'm not so nice
well I
should
but I attacked you
I already did not count
okay now I'm doing time
so

anyway
and
they got the funny videos
[Music]
why am I messing up there you go that's
a funny one
it's something again
that's the
that's the most you'll get
I want this around to decide
[Music]
oh yeah you don't even get any orbs
and that's everything it is everything
[Music]
oh well land
and that's everything in this world
[Music]
in that case we'll progress to United
Newark and
[Music]

yeah it has the same top
or something
oh come on I can't

level

TNT stay away
just a recommendation
it's the hell

carefully the mouse died because he
weren't careful
foreign
[Music]
explodes
but I want to play with it no don't play
with TNT about since you you should not
play with its TNT
but NTM however
[Music]
oops Yeah that wasn't what I wanted
in the height was a shame
it happened no so many red chills
I like the red gems
I had the silly idea of making a mod I'm
not able to do it so but
and uh I'm not idea
where all all these gems
are turned into ones to the red ones
and then
just that would be I'm not reignited but
[Music]
and then
I don't think what happens
and then there's just more gems same
value in total but
more gems to pick up
more places wearing gyms will be placed
I have to play with it
wow I never thought I'd be rescued
especially by such a little dragon oh
well what I mean is I always believed in
you spiral you gotta believe
bunny welcome master
Mouse
and yes I should have said that first
because now it sounded like I said your
name before
one
we can be squeaking what sound does
friends make
[Music]
it's some PlayStation one spiral
now the schedule didn't say it but
details
it's not nice
okay thank you
that engineering won't fly so terribly
optimized it doesn't run Ben
was that even English
Mouse
first is the keyboard
so I don't even reach
Mouse
indeed
what color is this one
[Music]
so I got the key
oh no
you're not squished
and the key is done
we got starting to know if it is
starting to think that he goes to the
kitties
you just heard once
it's basic geometry
[Music]
foreign
I'm not sure what the reply thing isn't
working
it works sometimes
sometimes it doesn't work
it is the same
this mouse doesn't open because this
dragon is impressive this is not
necessary to rescue this Dragon for the
first Mouse
hey didn't I already free you you're in
nasty's world now Spyro and you are the
dragon who must defeat him bring him on
I'm ready reach the exit in each of
nasty's lands then you can challenge the
Nork himself
it doesn't work
it's it's supposed to be that reply it's
a shorter
message
and then you have the red line on it
can I go into the devil
but look they have changed the name to
Twilight Harbor
are poor
didn't know they did that because they
haven't
in there
because that's everything hardboard
okay now it works
I said it works sometimes
but sometimes it doesn't work
and I don't know why
on my battery place doesn't add instead
of
[Music]
on my battery is this an ad installer
the reply message but it should still
work
if I do if I write just add
astronauts hello
it doesn't work but it should work
because it I I wrote the code so it
should trigger on messages that starts
with an ad
I don't know how I messed it up
no wait no I see why it stopped working
look it didn't work for Aston Mouse one
he didn't work with kids and freak for
life but if I'm right at Pom-Pom
hello
it is working now I know what I made but
the mistake I made
[Music]
it
obvious I don't know if she's off yet
oh on the stream I see yeah in the
that's my special it should work
regardless of what kind of reply you're
doing
but yeah as I said it doesn't work with
astronauts one and it doesn't work with
kitten freak for life but it does work
with one one
it's not because I'm still ambulance
thingy
it also works with the unit dance if
she's in here
foreign
[Music]
I got pushed
we cut like dark pink eyes
get quite to be honest this is
this is actually very quite a detained
mesh and texture will be a Playstation
One cute day
okay
thank you for releasing me
that that was actually thank you for
rescuing me and visiting one I'm sorry
for killing you I I require
you had butterflies in your stomach and
I had them
is that an expression in English
[Music]
I would not eat you for being
why would you eat them
oh you're a cat outside
hey I had to kill the other one because
it was was I was deep enough to land in
the water
well she's stopping in butterflies
definitely
be like when I see
[Music]
you
[Music]
I should stop
did I get everything yes
oops that mask got in the way I talked
it into that intentionally I think my
cat meow
and I'm a rabbit
I didn't do that I didn't touch the
mouse
the mouse committed suicide
kid pun
except
I'm a rabbit one man
but I mean that's yeah the birthday here
and the mouse has revived
isn't that great
okay I'm the get to the upper level
[Music]
it's you can play so high in the
original
it gets so heavy
I have the teeth whites
[Music]
no secret here nope
unban sounds yeah that's
um
that's what rabbit says right
when you give them a card to the mansion
is it bang bang and then they start
munching on it
you can't trust me I'm a bunny
[Music]
and give me a character
foreign
if they're mad yeah
but be on the lookout for Nord Commandos
Spyro
pile again for me
another time tonight but why would you
make why would you make a rabbit angry
okay that must ask for that
it's worked straight in front of me
isn't it's not like I want to kill the
mice
but they keep they keep walking in front
of me all the time
not on purpose
I guess rabbits can be a bit grumpy
sometimes
[Music]
oh my God
dipping of 11. we live it I need to find
11.
wow
ah just squishing the mouse
there's a they're like committing cell
phone
[Music]
like 400 in this town
I know Sparks is gone
[Music]
oh no I'm missing 20.
[Music]
just here they are
not very hard to find
400 out of the 400. you know what that
means
it means that I found everything
and it means they now have to confront
the nastiest of noise
you know what I'm not even going to pick
up extra health
I'm going to challenge him without
health
and I'm going to do it in one attempt
and you know what
will pawn pawn
defeat
nasty ignore in one attempt
yeah
yes and no
oh wait I said
no wait
that was like 30 seconds
well sorry
feet
nasty narc in one attempt there we go
yes no
that's the two minutes at least
there you go
you don't have to say yes yes the two he
nice you are free to say no if you
honestly believe that I will make a
mistake and fail to defeat last knocking
on attempt that doesn't mean that you
aren't have to see now either
you have free to vote whatever you want
with however many points as you want and
if you're not sure how this works you
simply use your channel points so it's
no real money involved
you've built how much you want for one
of the options all my care said yes so
thank you
but you're free to vote now and when you
if your side wins you will win
all the points from the opposite side
and then it will divide it
proportionally on on how what you are
side voted on so if you voted half of
the total amount you will get half of
the points from the other side
and if you are wrong in that case
you will lose all the points of course
oh
and that's very simply how it works so
if you just vote like a hundred because
now it's a thousand
you will lose a little but if you win
you will win a little
question yes
this is exciting
Ethan are you voting
because it's running out I should have
set this up on the previous level so
they could have been longer I'm so I'm
sorry
if we if you don't believe I'll do it it
it's perfectly fine
you have seen me fail too many times you
cannot just me
where did it go
there you go
then we have
hmm
sorry
and then wait a minute
so we have one vote on yes which is that
strong and one one vote on his on now
which is hidden
uh
in this case you don't have to vote more
than a thousand because that's what
astral voted because technically you
only have to work what's the lowest
about 100 I think
because if you vote more you're not
going to win more you're only going to
win 1000 because that's what astral
voted so this system works better if you
have more people
but
I will do my best
I mean you're both I of course want your
boss to win but
therefore I will not collect any of the
gems like
that's not my gun
I think that okay maybe tennis allowance
yeah it's it's best like
but it works much better if you have the
that's why I had tried to do that
explanation
come on
like you're running past the thief why
are they so slow
when I run past nasty New York as well
[Music]
and my bunny money
yeah you do you have a lot but why don't
you spend it on like outfit changes
asking for phrases or something you have
you are able to
yeah I'm catching African
pick it up I don't have a spark
verify doesn't look good again
oh you almost won there
I'm really shy
[Music]
sorry
what if I'm really not smoking one of
them yes
what about ganasti ganork nasty nork
his toast so now there's order again in
the dragon Kingdom well mostly I still
got some treasure to pick up what will
you do next I'd say this guy's the limit
now you're rich
he did say that it was 5500 in the in
Point Victory the technique on the 4500
they should fix that
I mean you don't win your own money that
doesn't make sense
[Music]
uh yeah as the description says that I
would be making animals in the game
if there's no animals to mimic your
country name
[Music]
what
[Music]
what are you doing
[Music]
oh yeah the outfit change the story
[Music]
what does this one do boom boom
that's everything
well I tried maybe I should have
[Music]
put so much
wait there you go
more
a sporty
outfit
it's a nice outfit what do you see
they're having fun
[Music]
we need more people voting of course
that's even more fun
but I have not yet collected everything
having a nice
shoe
[Music]
I studies in that she isn't that she
went like an animal
is she close related to her mouth
what is it actually
well that was fun
[Music]
no sheep or harm during the creation of
this game
I cannot
a few Norse but not heaps I cannot say
for Saturn that no sheeps were harmed
during the creation of the game
they were probably shapes that were
harmed
we're not due to the makeup obviously
I'm just making fun
[Music]
well now I just need to collect the
remaining kits
so what's in there I believe this is
nasty's treasure horde but the gate will
not open until you have found everything
in the dragon kingdom come back when you
have reached 100
I'm sorry I'm asked that I need this
body but don't worry because I also
murdered bunnies it's not lucky
it's not like I'm saving any of the
animals I ain't murdered them all
that looks like everything
no I need to
get the remaining gems in this area no
she's left
253
not much
really that much yeah it is 500 minutes
now but that's a lot
that is a lot of chance
here's me
collecting gems I see
[Music]
okay it's a little inside of like these
gems with Sparks
[Music]
it's making sure I don't miss anything
[Music]
bad meow
why did you spend everything
I mean okay in case you didn't know how
the system works that's
I guess that's a different thing
[Music]
is everything it should end with like
nine oh no wait there's something on
there
you hear it right now I I forgot I've
collected them over here too
take your top Mouse
being good at predicting
the outcome
[Music]
I have a problem I must standing kittens
but you're not you you were sitting
there was four and a half thousand
points and you were not spending it how
can you make such a claim
when you that doesn't make any sense
[Music]
oh there's this one
[Music]
ah
they can have made it almost perfect day
anyway I got everything time to visit
the bonus level
foreign
[Music]
two hundred
sorry ponpon what's what's what are you
sorry about
this glute
[Music]
there is nothing to be sorry about
if you did it to yourself
oh no I'm stuck on this island what am I
supposed to do
like
[Music]
so here is basically the remaining
magenta
pink
bring boxes
outside of this lemon
it is only two
foreign
[Music]
kitten but you were hoarding so you were
hoarding it
[Music]
all right
with this I'm able to get up
to this platform
[Music]
let me see this platform
I hope that wasn't all of your carrots
no okay
how many how much carrots do you have
because I have basically watch every
stream
evening
[Music]
meow meow meow
did a flying Thief
easy
meow meow meow
meow
oh my
[Music]
let's see
[Music]
that's why they are known as meows
[Music]
meow me
because
[Music]
another door
I have a thousand more
[Music]
you have you have spent a thousand
carrots and I have a thousand more
I think I went the wrong way
but which way am I good
not this way I'm done how's it yeah
what
[Music]
keep forgetting which part I'm supposed
to take
is it running on a PS1
no
[Music]
this is not the original heart man
I wish you lick these nights
like upscape ice cream
but I do have I have two PS3 and up and
I'm PS1 we just
and I do have a capture card I do have
the game lines already now
in a box somewhere
the technique that you have on this app
it just
is not only more convenient
isn't completely
and this [ __ ] yeah and then
yeah I have to think
I did make a copy of the game myself
thank you no no I got I got stuff to do
it myself
[Music]
which is why I am also playing new film
version
of the game because that's the version I
got
okay and that has a different rocket
[Music]
Nike
I don't know what I hope it is
oh this is
somehow I missed this one
maybe I just find it like this
pink James
thank you
take look at this Trail
[Music]
and then we look into this room
[Music]
James gems everywhere and so pink
Mark's picked someone up
I did something
do you have yeah oh wait I need
something
I see something shine I completely
missed it
[Music]
thank you
this afternoon
and the game is complete
Spyro the Dragon you've defeated ganasti
gunorc collected the dragon eggs saved
all the dragons and recovered every bit
of treasure in the dragon Kingdom how do
you feel I feel fired up Bob and I'm
happy for the Dragon World of course I
certainly wouldn't want to spend the
rest of my dragon days butting heads
with nasty Nork in his weird minions
what's a minion uh never mind you know
what they say for every good battle you
need a good adversary and I felt that
nasty in spite of his misguided nature
was a worthy opponent
uh oh
here we go again
here we go again
[Music]
yep
and it's more crazy
[Music]
so
should we
move over to the side game
how about that
yeah how about that I I haven't even
put it on my computer
oh
I said 100 well I do like this ad game
like more than the second game so
if I go if I only have time for like one
more game I think
although maybe I should go to bed with
preparation for tomorrow I don't know do
you want some more spiral or should I go
to bed
we have like six watches at the moment
so is it late uh 22 so it's like two
hours to midnight but tomorrow
12 o'clock my time so that is 14 hours
from now
I will have the a special screen
or pom-pom's birthday
I will make a mod for
reunited trilogy
where I will modify the pandas in the
desire game
and it is scheduled to be a 12 hour
stream but I will go for as long as like
at most 12 hours I think I would go
but I could probably go a bit more if
required and if I manage to complete
everything within the 12 hours for the
additional time we can come up with
something else to do
happy birthday wait until tomorrow maybe
you can't make it tomorrow but in that
case thank you
when you get too early you're going to
show up tomorrow I know that
that's an order
tomorrow
that would be nice if you would I would
that would make me very happy
that would make me a happy bun bun
and then you can
so the question is should I should
should I continue now or should I not
continue now
oh
guys all right maybe I can't change
it it tells me the uh it requires the
additional of
yeah because this this search by him has
copy protection and if I just copy the
disk plainly
I don't have the copy protection removed
and the game isn't going to run properly
which I guess it's proof that I do have
the disc and I copied myself because I
thought I just need to prove it but
not that I do
no that's yeah I didn't plan to run a
third game so
anything else going on
well
let me make a quick connection of that
and I'll try to start the game so
yes
this is an outbreak coming up let me
just get rid of the let's play an ads in
that case while so it doesn't play over
the gameplay later and I'll try to
resolve this issue
hopefully with his three minutes
we'll see
oh
if I just search for the exact details
given here
maybe I can get that exact file I
require
because it is just the
specific file
and it has nothing to do
now I got the file
like that
and now if I start the game it should no
longer complain
it does no longer complain
I think that's a success
comfy
and look at this
Sonic computer and same in your presence
a universal interactive Studio
production
created and developed by insomnia games
that's like Crash Bandicoot's intro
however the ads are not our apparently I
did manage to solve this issue quicker
than before I've been done I've done in
the past so
Okay one minute 20 minutes and then I
will be able to basically plate through
because I planned for a three hour
stream that means that I would be able
to do the three hours at least see how
it do the remaining one hour before the
next handbrake so you get an ad free
watching experience
that's those
who get the ads come hear me but
I don't know how many here because I got
six watches moment
I don't know which because if you're
paying which would be the kitten
which that's why it says
and I guess it's uh
yeah this is the first icon
you can't hide from me
and if you don't have it in that case
you haven't had blocker
I mean
whatever
it's not like I don't use it
anyway 10 seconds left and then we begin
the game
and hydration
which level is this one from
English
[Music]
this memory card does not contain
aspired sweetheart do you want to create
one yes
now
[Music]
there's barely any icons she's from and
there's like not like a pink dragon
eat
[Music]
the kind of you kitten
and also the message in the chat is what
I can do
the Sun
a nice gift
after that breakfast
now you two can use the pump money but
it's not it's not an amazing emote but
Ah that's why you're marking
[Music]
you're working Astra
I haven't added the pronouns to the chat
I'm planning on doing that
it's just that I have to manually add it
oh
so Astron you have the choice of
obviously
of how you want to be referred to as
she they or any combination
I mean choose hichi or they even if you
find with multiple choose which one
whichever eyes it is
your highness every last one
maybe you will amount to something after
at all I told you to choose
stop anyone from coming through
back and you're on a cute bunny ah thank
you Juni you're back for spider free
Miss means that you missed the Inspire
one boss battle
which I did
makeup sentence
oh no I had a prediction of everything
the whole came out on the other side of
the Dragon World we found some of the
eggs but they were too heavy to carry
back the other side of the World the
Forgotten worlds
looks like spider forgot about it you'll
have to go nobody else can fit down the
Halls yeah come on let's go
hunting he said that no one has Good
Feet you can't fit
[Music]
find the eggs and bring the best I have
class every chance you got it set
yeah I did a prediction basically can I
defeatness in order in one attempt
without any health that wasn't part of
the sentence but I didn't have any extra
Health without Sparks
and I'm basically yes I don't really
don't know why I would do it
and I did it
I managed to feed last night one attempt
and I
sorry I forgot to set the game to use
the correct controller
how do I set it
I can't set it because
I have to
keep my mind
yeah what's it the spider controls
and then if I
oh yeah and then I did that and now it's
back
a mouse
and I keep my eye on you
no I don't know
[Music]
no don't tell me uh
I went uh
lips like I had to restart the game
because that's because I it doesn't want
to use the new controllers because I'm
I'm I use the same state and therefore
it goes back to the previous settings
which makes sense how do I oh yeah
because that's better
did I have a safe game
uh
fast forward
yeah no
I'm keeping that I see you
that's one
night
okay it's it's just behaving when I
guess that one
hi everyone is my favorite game but
spicy has kind of a nice feeling but
this is gonna answer the same time kind
of weird how the numbers in the corner
isn't 3D anymore and it's 2D
and I said the music's loud
forgot about that I lowered the music in
[Music]
oh yeah say again please
it wasn't what I wanted to do but sure
[Music]
all right they say
Arctic camera is nice
but they realize there's voice option
you can turn off the voices of
what the bike didn't have it like out
loud you had for houses to do something
anyway I need to rescue Sheila
you're a mouse
I asked you
do you want me which pronoun do you want
me to use when I refer to you you have
to pick one
because I wanted to be consider I mean
okay as you said yeah you're fine with
us but if
but if I'm going to refer to you I'm
only going to use one of them and
therefore you have the option to see
I guess you catches hi Spyro and to look
left or right
or R2
to quickly
you can look all around by holding the
triangle button down you are an engines
uni
[Music]
keeping an eye on you keep an eye on
that Mouse you never know what that
Mouse can do
funny
how sad look here Dragon if you know
what's good for you you'll turn around
and crawl back up that hole you came
through those eggs belong to us now and
I've hidden them in Places You'll Never
Find it a thousand years
even if you could find an egg our
expertly trained armies will dispose of
you and take it back do I make myself
clear if I find you here again I'm going
to be very angry and you won't like me
when I'm angry
but what if I like you when you're angry
but if you're cute when you're angry
anyway
[Music]
because because your name is Julie I
wanted to say something like Julie dudes
so specific because it kind of feels
better
amount
remembering something
here we go
[Music]
like that
the intention was you
but I am not a dude
if you know that that I think
it's not that like something that's fame
or something and you're in no way of
failure
and I'm not a Dada
nickname for
like water
I didn't know about that
I am unfamiliar
[Music]
yep
thoughts
[Music]
for kids we have that nickname
[Music]
everything
in here that it
that's this one do that and it's not
yeah
like yeah
oh Hunter disappears as soon as you jump
into your water maybe not the scenes but
yeah it disappears after being naughty
yeah people yeah they say the same
hydration I need it
yay
and only that
[Music]
Juliana
saliva
[Music]
I'm still missing
oh I know where I can get more gems
you can put a hydrate with these
I think I'm kind of Imagine hydrate
myself but
[Music]
piping here
now I can pay money back there's more
chips
Spyro my my how funny to see you here
why I haven't seen you since we defeated
ripto in Avalar
well my business when it was slump after
you left so I came here and struck up a
nice deal with the local Sorcerers
lovely woman she is seems to be very
fond of dragons too
Indiana
Maybe
no advice that he said I I'm a Julie and
only that that is
not short for Union
also yeah
is it the end
he wanted to be Juliana or Juliana or
Juliana
the
pesky animal must have been causing a
lot of trouble for that poor sorceress I
suppose I could accidentally let the
kangaroo Escape if you were to pay me
say a small fee
it is a nice name there's some nice
Tunisia for Juliana
Julie Julie Julie
jujuba Julius
no thanks I don't want free Sheila
don't worry Spyro Sheila won't stay in
jail forever the sorcerer is thinking
about having her executed next Thursday
oh bye Sheila won't stay in jail forever
what what kind of what
I'm getting paid off I mean I mean I
need to listen to that again
well don't worry Spyro Sheila won't stay
in jail forever
perfect
anyway thank you
ah Spyro I love your sweet naivete your
kind-hearted nature might be your
downfall someday but for the time being
it's making me Rich
you can call me any of the above opinion
I think at 38 Julie or Julie probably
it's just say Julie more often because
it's more like
a Swedish way of doing it
or if you want to know the Swedish
pronunciation of that spelling it would
be Julie
you usually
I don't know
English
Julie
Julie there we go that's named Julie
cute
thank you
I hope you appreciate this favor I'm
doing in letting you out as good of you
mate no hard feelings eh right after all
I'm just doing my job see nothing
compressed voice
oh
I reckon you be one of them dragons then
yeah named Spyro never thought I'd see
one you dragons used to rule this entire
world you know then all of a sudden
you're left dragons used to live here
didn't you know they say it was over a
thousand years ago I think
they just laughed yeah and the weird
thing is after they left all the magic
in the world just sort of went with them
I mean they say this world used to have
magic coming out the Wazoo flying ships
singing forests wishing Stones you name
it but when the dragons left it all just
dried up is that why some of the portals
don't work yeah they're starting to fade
out too one by one well I gotta get back
home and do some damage control come
visit anytime you like
at the moment
why was her voice level of quality
compared to everyone else
I pronounce it like well is that like
something
[Music]
I would like a Sim
it's like Julie or Julie I don't know
which it is
it is easy for me to say Julie
yep what was the difference three
seconds last one oh Julie it's a yeah
it's their voiced
so kind of like the English Julie but
without the the at the start
I think something happened
that's my pronunciation
um
yeah no one said that Emily thing was
going to be perfect
thank you
that's what about
his second time I started game
your third time I start again
hopefully it's
not sure if you passed forwarding
loading makes it quicker
that was strange
I haven't had the game failed
[Music]
well I guess that's
the outfit was supposed to change back
well looks like I'm not playing this
game but I wasn't planning on playing
this game in the first place but
oh well
that was a shame
it's been two and a half hours of the
stream already so so I think
I think I got quite a lot out of that
but that allows me to get in bed earlier
today because because really you weren't
here before but I put it on my schedule
yeah I put it on my schedule tomorrow
it's panpun's birthday so therefore
the it it will be at I plan it which is
12 so noon to midnight my time
which would be
now I don't remember so that's 11
through 23 in Western Europe
and I don't know every other time zone
and he has the regular schedule but I
don't have I guess that's the standard
time minus two hours to two hours
earlier
then I must listen on Saturday Sunday
here
no Steam on Sunday because I need the
rest after death
my time is the same as yeah so one hour
earlier
so 12 to 24 my time 11 to 23 in your
time
Halloween sleepy uh
yeah sometimes it feels like that
anyway here's the here's the schedule so
that
yeah didn't intend this dream to end
that early but I mean
the game didn't work for some reason
and then which one is the UK one there
oh Western Europe
since Europe
well I don't know which I country you
live in but uh
at least because it mentioned Portuguese
because I I if many people to keep check
of Portugal the official times are
important is Western time
which eh so so Western Center Easton I
could probably I should probably like
add UK
like a note like UK or something
but yeah West End maybe parentheses UK
that might not be a bad idea to do
so
anything else I I while I prepare for uh
raid I suppose
because that's always fun to do
oh yeah I don't need to do it from here
anymore
should we
should we I haven't
I haven't visited uh Roy X
in a while maybe I should visit him
again by
doing a surprise
right
did you think it's Australian yeah okay
that's how come
how come which is like
this is right then said
yeah yeah that's because the Australian
times are after midnight
so that that is why
the search Thursday Friday's time is so
late in Europe it's already past
midnight in Australia
good day yeah
it was there yeah
I was about to miss that detail in
myself but and then I realized hey it's
past me that I have to change it to
practice Saturday otherwise it could be
wrong
so anyway yeah I should start this red
thing
so thank you for thank you for checking
making sure everything looks correct as
well that I do appreciate that
you
let's go have a good sleep
message I I don't really because it's
Roy
that's just let's do
let's just do pop in yum that's all
I have to say
that's all you had to say
he will
I don't know if it's just because I'm
streaming but twitch is really slow at
loading
and stuff for me
even after I streamed it's really stuff
really slow at loading for me
so again I have to open this this
everything I have to with what I'm going
to straight before I trade
otherwise I want the arrive for like
several minutes after this
anyway thank you all for coming
and hopefully I'll see some of you
tomorrow and you don't have to stay for
the whole thing if you just show up for
a few minutes that would be amazing
and see you at Troy
