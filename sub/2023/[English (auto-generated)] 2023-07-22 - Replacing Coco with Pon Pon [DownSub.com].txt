hello everyone
you're going to the story
and Define
thank you
Jerry and welcome
great to see you hey
so
let's start with one
starting blender I think
that's something good
good idea
and then I should add blender as a
window
[Music]
here we go
simple as that
[Music]
and then take my should probably not be
above everything
[Music]
so
you don't need any of this stuff
[Music]
and then a really nice to even have a
game I should have game yes I do have a
game good
because that would have been a bit
embarrassing
but I don't have only that kid a
character now
here we go and I had a crash mod folding
this this isn't showing up on the stream
now
you know demonstrated of getting like
the second screen circuit
should maybe do that
let me just
yeah
so I prefer not to like capture the
whole
desktop or privacy reasons not
I hope that's
understandable
so
I guess it's a good idea to show like
okay you know what
let me
see what I can do
to improve the name
yeah
and then it came with me to bother
[Music]
okay I guess it's not too many cameras
like
power in picture but then I need a place
to put it I have my mouse game whatever
I'm happy
do you still have your
to keep putting skills
I assuming you had
[Music]
skateboarding skills to be keeping me
[Music]
um
thank you
and to make it better it's also vintage
tea no I am
and I assume you're not going to
use that one to practice your
skateboarding
so I would print a folder for
foreign
maybe I should add it
as a window
oh
[Music]
all right thank you
and then I
like that
um
[Music]
foreign
this is my phone list
no it doesn't show that is my
I like to create a form of resources
and then
put it in here I create my any resources
and since there will be multiple outfits
I should
no wait I should do that
I'll create a folder for her outfit I
think and then there would be the base
so let's create the base then
in here I would save the blender
document the file and stuff so now let's
see let's get back to you but again I
will share Without Limbs canscapers I
mean
while on the wheelchair wheelchair
on this
well
I could I could imagine a person without
names
doing some
which they didn't come to every kind of
trick this is probably someone
out there being really good at
skateboarding and not having games
[Music]
thank you
so
what I need is to extract
since the goal needs to replace cocoa
with
with Pom-Pom
and it's price the mouse point but I
don't even have them interact
can I add this one too let me see
I wouldn't I would like it if OBS could
switch which window it did show
based on which window was active
[Music]
that would be a neat feature
[Music]
so here's a very tiny
new season of work
so
[Music]
so I do have to in games okay
instead of path to the
[Music]
to the uh
packs folder
and then just to ensure that it loads
the correct version
doesn't show the drop downs but
[Music]
you can pick the correct version which
is 4.24
and the rest I don't think you have to
change
Peppers okay in the window displays
working in background
and then it will eventually show up
again
there we go
it did show up again
[Music]
I wasn't sure if it was actually it was
actually going to show up again because
when
because it might have been raised it
doesn't mean you know
so what we're interested here is the
plugin
I think
uh plugins this folder the drum plugs is
probably
we can confirm here is that the
main folder of the game
[Music]
is called the lava
I'm not really sure why how they come up
with these project names
and or like other code names it's a
fresh voice lava spiral reignited is a
falcon
but which way I mean in what ways spider
inspiring Falcon related and crash in
lava at least Lara will make more sense
for spider since he can't breathes fire
and fire and lava is kinda associated
with each other
anyway
[Music]
this means I've only followed here
but
not in the resources though outside
[Music]
I guess I could show the past
again
so I got the photo I would put the stuff
in and the research and snookout and
then it shows the path of hearing
yeah I should be able to change the skin
music is changed skin on the other side
so it doesn't cut it off but whatever
so in this fall there there will be
plugins so now I have to match the paths
I get from
the human
this is gonna
a slightly a tutorial I guess
[Music]
so it will be characters which I could
copy here and just watching that
suggested
sure I spelled it correctly
and then it would be
think this should be multiple folder
height it is
nothing like that
maybe this is
[Music]
I just showed that stuff
anyway
it is playing if I create a new phone
card player
and in player we got multiple poker
skin attack and change the voice of this
video
[Music]
all right give me half a second
and guys c-i-n
which I'm not really sure what it means
after shift that one is used
[Music]
and it's a crashing type coconut
rollerball well CL
[Music]
I want to see a character l
overboard
I said to be a robot a hoverboarding
fish for it it made easy to stop a
country family first moment
[Music]
so a templates that makes sense
interesting here is cocoa
so what I would do
is make sure that the export settings
are correct which is Showbox
but I have an export folder inside the
defaulted with you model so everything
would be put in there
and I do enable export compressed
texture to do this format I think that
would be the correct decision because
I could correct me if I'm wrong but yeah
text say texture
teaching textures are already compressed
in game so if you export them compressed
you're going to get the compressed
version which saves you space because
these clients won't be
you you don't lose any information
there's already quality loss but that's
already done by the by the developer
compressing it in the first place
you can choose to export it as
uncompressed
but you're not going to gain information
because it's already lost just wasting
space
so what's this one it contains isn't
necessary all I do is choose export
and
the exporting progress is not showing
[Music]
yeah there's the internet windows don't
think they approve it working
doesn't take the show the progress bar
though it's just a lot of texting
so it has exported I could export the
like the other Coco folder to just
but I think it's unused and this is the
Coco MP skin which I guess in
multiplayer skin is that the no because
there's no antola
and dingo MP skins
and Cat bath and
that
so this should be user interface
too but
it's one of this is it
prototype
textures characters
menu
oh yeah it wasn't it
yeah here we go
it's just using the face art production
contains and stuff like
and
[Music]
now let's look at it working here look
at the text and it Target contains uh
portraits of the character which also
has to be replaced of course
[Music]
and the
assistant
that's halfway done and yeah
so when you choose which skin you want
to use
and the icon will show
this game properly
[Music]
[Music]
yeah there's a lot of friends I didn't
really need to export the whole folder I
guess
I guess I
[Music]
wanted to be Sarah
it was like two three quarters done
yeah two quarters will be halfway
and these fights are heavy
yeah no it's now it speeds along it was
a few heavy fires there now it's almost
done
and now it's done and I think that's all
of it if there's anything more I can of
course
export more
now I'm done with that full name all
right now for now
wait
I always found it I said it's pretty
um
interesting
oh yeah
no I see I said it's export to inspire
14.
um ceiling
[Music]
so I got this stuff exported now okay
that means that the playable character
for Cocoa
should now be in
available team fortitude plan
so let's try that
it's not this it's in the mesh folder
show up on stream I see I disable scale
down and then I import Coco and here we
go
[Music]
without anything
[Music]
but we can
change that
so we got material so I choose
magic texture
and then go to texture folder
[Music]
and open the sea
[Music]
and preview there you go
now do some texture too
and now I should turn this
I could import another
Pokemon election
because there is a cocoa model with a
dress which might be easier to work with
um
considering I'm going to make home phone
with address
[Music]
so this should be using the same
Armature
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
so
[Music]
similarly here
[Music]
pick it up and you go
so this cocoa has
address
[Music]
and then
I actually don't know if there was any
I'll do
a model I can think of right now though
I'd like to import but I should add a
um
a picture of Pom-Pom to use as an
efforts
how many proportions
probably have to be modified
[Music]
I do it at
in
yeah that's definitely Instagram I just
want to thank you
[Music]
again
and image ref
an empty image image reference in my
back actually no that's the image
reference
foreign
[Music]
maybe maybe they do have simple
questions
[Music]
okay maybe not exactly simple but the
proportional aren't too far off
now
[Music]
I expected much
[Music]
something much much different
[Music]
IAL work
[Music]
seeing a 2d picture in this video where
Elizabeth's age
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
normally copy this part and
[Music]
separate it
because now I got an arm here
primary and I got two arms
[Music]
anyway dude yes this should be there
should be one more than which I rather
should get the ones my cooker skins
that I should try to use for
for the arms because it's
it's a whole part like it includes the
shoulder as well which of course is
very useful
if I'm going to
do one for the shoulders
let's add some colors
it's always nice types of color
foreign
[Music]
despite it not looking like it
this everything that's like now is part
of the same piece
so
um
this whole part
okay it doesn't actually clear the show
name because that part is there one that
actually doesn't change I don't remember
what does Coco's outfits look like in
the game
[Music]
when I try to use shorter names for the
Titans and stuff in for the game on the
crash Wiki I got a page that it has been
deleted I'm used to redirects but I'm
gonna chase it
[Music]
it's still a useful to redirect
okay let's see here
oh no it's not actually showing the skin
on the bikini picture
oh
and then there is the PlayStation
exclusive skins that were supposed to
not be exclusive anymore but they are
still exclusive if I want to be taken
unless there's been an update that
I've yet not seen
because I think they're one of the
exclusive one actually does show the
shoulders
[Music]
well yeah it's one
what would be useful
[Music]
I just don't need it it's just
send me some work
but how much time do I spend on trying
to find
we should use at the same time
because I'm at work but I have it tapped
off while I'm working oh
[Music]
and welcome Jacob
Optimus Jacob Artemis is that
what about me
[Music]
Jack Rabbit
some
[Music]
thank you
so anyway back to
this means that I could combine these
and one thing you can you might notice
is that when you get this flavoring that
means that the polygons are on top of
each other because it because it's
obviously it's trying to display the
polygon that is and like the topmost
part the polygon closest to the camera
of course is the one this one it wants
to show you
but if they are I I on top of each other
like
but in the exact same when they are in
exact same I can't speak when they are
in the exact same position
that means that neither of them is
closer to camera and this current
systems uh
but they only up to a certain point
because at a certain point they started
to differ
as apparently
which is quite obvious here
the polygons doesn't align them anymore
and I find now yeah it is it is where
Cocos
I can see the pixels in the texture you
don't check that close
[Music]
but anyway it is where the sleeve starts
which means that
[Music]
when they wanted to make when they made
these
an alternative
her arms next to me or is it just me
it's almost it's like seeing up here and
it's
I don't know maybe they wanted to live
like that
checking my alarm
I mean I could see something aspects of
it but
but not to that extent
anyway so the best thing is this arm for
the other two outfits and because they
wanted more
of the arm to show in both of the
outfits they had to recreate the arm in
both cases but they really created in
two different ways
weird
effects
[Music]
anyway
[Music]
I don't need this pattern and for the
other one I don't need
this part
and now I can combine them and also
there
color is a bit different here
that's nothing that's going to show up
in the
okay I don't need the hands
but I might want to keep it in me
I will crop it off here
I hope the divisions
[Music]
and then
in half
so I can add the mirror
and the mirror goes before the Armature
so I should rename this to something one
useful like
fun fun
and I should also save this project
so I'll
make a shortcut to the crash mods folder
I'm going to mount on resources base and
then I would save this as base I guess
or
one Pawn base might be available
it works better in when I check like
open recently news files
and problem I was and what is different
from the side obviously that doesn't
work pom pon has a four fingers just
like I think
there are such convenience
[Music]
but did you know
that still in even in the latest
brush or delay designer about Crash form
it's about time the heaven is more crash
games
in Japan having four fingers isn't
common
let's flash that has several of you
probably know the word for four has been
associated with this
do they really prefer to avoid
but so a cartoon character so for crash
that's just kind of a cartoon character
decided that for the marketing in Japan
they changed his hand to have five
fingers but it doesn't they don't change
the in-game models where he just have
four fingers still
which I guess could see a bit look a bit
alien like
when you look at it like that
don't start too closely delicious
I don't think that's how the camera was
so
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
which might be able to help me with the
whole thing actually because there are
these power up things
um
candy
the time power up
now I don't need the time for some kids
it does have
actually in my top now because the body
part content of this part
[Music]
the last one isn't going to be that is
fun
but there are more there are total of
four mask power-ups
so that was time
there's also space
no space is a good skin
and it's not about space Power
you know what I just said
uh we got
space shift that's an action part
but it's also similarly have these
wash attached it really shows how weird
and isn't that
you tell me if this is a weird looking
body
very
narrow
okay uh should be two more yeah another
one is gravity
this one might be more promising yeah
this is this is the one I'm looking for
select and convert
know it
I want to do Mickey and
there we go
all right that actually
nothing to that part so
let me adds added textures it's easy to
see that
so it's not completely white now it's
completely black instead
and now we just color
[Music]
especially got the whole almost full I
had this one
thickest it wants to be useful
[Music]
but it basically
almost off the body
doesn't have a bit of these and
[Music]
Folds
which obviously wouldn't be part of the
body one point
anyway
let's see yeah it does have some food
but I could still use most of the body
here anymore
oh yeah
one part of the leg
okay
[Music]
I need to check yes it does everything
good
she is actually wearing shorts under her
dress so
no worries
not this one
so I combine things
and then
this is just the legs doesn't match up
and stuff
Andy butts doesn't match up
anyway
upper body doesn't match up
foreign
why does it take the wrong path
wants to be more intelligent sometimes
no I should have just one slice too
and then it would be nice unless there
is a function like a field function for
selection although I don't need more
than half the body actually because I'm
getting married anyway
foreign
everything said it wasn't necessary
you can't really see the pixels in this
texture
turning right is close to them
and if I'm not mistaken because I've
seen that in toys because it's twice
about Bob has developed was crash four
and
uh it's probably United
and inspired United as far as I can tell
the texture solution they actually work
with
is
4096 I think unless that's two to the
power or something
and then before they like in the
published version of the game
they scaled all these pictures down
you can tell that it is 4 000
or I well as far as I can tell because
the textures that are that size which I
assume only is the case the only reason
they are that says it because they
forgot to scale them down
or for example yeah
yeah it's jet board texture but for
spiral is is that porn 1000 pixel
pictures is very very high quality in
game
compared to regular skateboard having
ethics a thousand
but because the texture is because one
it's just one texture file that contains
all the parts of the object
so you're going to get multiple
different fields in the texture and
that's obviously something I could show
on skin
foreign
like it got this part
and
there's this it's basically the scene
between
the pants and the hair because there's
also the seams between the two different
parts of the handle so it's just a bit
harder to see sometimes
[Music]
there's some artifact in here due to the
compression yeast
um
particularly that
the uh they still have some fading going
on over here from one to the other
the texture switch four thousand in
wisdom Heights don't have this they have
a sharp Pixel Perfect borders between
the two the different fields
and that's why I think four thousand is
the exercise that are actually working
with
[Music]
[Music]
oh yeah
[Music]
so I basically I have to somehow get all
these parts too
plants together
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
this part is perfectly incentive but
this part is not
hmm
[Music]
thank you
Sam I'm amazing things
I'm changing is my brain
thank you
but yeah he's
really shows that the
account bites how the body it looks
because all I can determine is that they
didn't have a base model that they made
all their outfits pay
ton which but they should have done
so
we should we should have done in on the
games
and like
like
the seams I'm not Crossing
so on they basically have one base
nude body
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
dress I do have
I think someone is one of them without
somebody
which of course would be
stupid
which of course would be easier to work
with
it's a reference
apparently I don't actually have a
picture of that
so give me a short note
[Music]
[Music]
but yeah but basically make the legs
begin and having these line up
let me
just put it together uh reference
let's actually I will save this picture
inside the
Quantum Resources all day I would call
this one
how about
tampon reference because that's how he
is
names can be easy
like that
it seems like an useful thing then with
this picture I should be able to swap it
out
go to picture here
we go image
or single image folder
on the reference oh wait what happened
now
[Music]
it wasn't like
things
range you need
to change the let me see now
just
how strange
doesn't make sense to me
is that something that shows up my
vision
like I was at
reference
to make that one
I'm just showing up why does it show up
there's something with the image is
saying
this blendiest doesn't like the image
because some reason
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
but this should help getting an idea of
how
because quite
white half
[Music]
and I could probably sponsored to the
base of the body this is so narrow
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
but also to simplify my
I will
do this this thing called triangulate
when you turn things into triangles
is this quarterly Heat
turning things into quartz
that's the pretty one
foreign
sometimes that's
it doesn't go as expected
and sometimes you have to
make sure it does it correctly
look here
position uneven number eight you have to
it tries to make as many channel the
chords
but um
[Music]
yeah I'm not interested in those that
wouldn't be quads
I rather have three triangles then
one Squad and one dragon
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay it's nice so fine
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
no
and obviously I should have done this
before I
turned off temperature
guys obvious to me
but I can't stand like
unless it's like a quick mirror scene
with the text on it
it is everything next to
well
foreign
to the left
of the mirror
or something
and
hello
welcome back
as you can see
there is some
undressing Star Stable
[Music]
I should be ashamed for death ones
[Music]
and for a bit eating breakfast we'll be
taking a shower afterwards
nice shower
sorry princess I have not been able to
catch them
it's okay
um
I'm glad you're here now
that's all that matters
I have been
missing you though
every stream I've been asking hey where
is laser
later not later companion
combined later and taster into laser
that was a good one
okay maybe I haven't asked that
seriously anyway
hey that's to be curious whenever you
would shut up if you've missed me I mean
you have it funny
yeah are you excuse me your name is Lisa
Tater the laser tater
as far as I'm remembering we have had
quite fun when you've been here so
yeah I I guess you could say I've been
missing you
it's it's been something yeah
and because I can I can be honest and
right I shouldn't be lying
it's like I haven't been exactly been
able to say like yeah it's it's my lazy
it's like the taster I've been missing
it's more like something
oh
there's something because you showed up
on my art streams I think
and when
I don't know
future streams haven't felt the same
movies
maybe it's a year
it's your fault you know maybe you're in
the missing piece
already got that feature
it that's a different outfit though
uh
let me see I'm division but
uh yeah the laser tater
I mean this series is your name two
names combined to one
electron people in my name is ponbon or
something
or very few people have asked me because
most CIA says pom-poms or just Pawn as
there is a few people who ask me which
asking is always nice if I want to be
called on or Bonbon which I do chokingly
respond with
uh do do you call him Sonic or Hedgehog
because my name is
my name is Ethan bonbon
obviously
joke I'm
I'm here to have fun with people and I
hope
and hopes to fish don't find it
question it gives them interesting
this is good
I know more of these
um
[Music]
this one doesn't look like Felix has one
but this face
correct
okay this makes sense that they are
speaking up and going more detailed here
what's this
I have Mystic cute bunny stream right oh
that means
as he said
yeah I've been able to catch any streams
and it's I don't like
if you want to share
like
I don't remember
where in the world you are could be
because you haven't told me
I mean it might not actually matter
where in the world they are because if
you're like in Europe that's that's like
afternoon you could be at work if it's
there we go
it's so in the afternoon yeah I feel
like at work or something I can
understand not being able to
anyone is of course free to not watch if
they don't want him
everyone has to go away
no but
um
yes
so yeah if you're not working
maybe you can't really much
thank you
but yeah even if you just show up for a
few minutes it's it is nice
knowing that you just checking out a few
minutes of your life
and speaking of work only one we can see
nonsense out of town no not business
assignment
welcome
demand from space
the man with the rocket Rocket Man
himself the number one
nice to see you here
and you're back at
oh yeah
let's talk about your stream if there's
nothing else to speak of
for your
okay for now
and current theme
one and only yeah there's no other
rocket man that's why you had to put a
zero instead of an O and then o one and
I understand maybe he wanted that
maybe stylistic showings
but that obviously means that I have to
pronounce it as man
that's
that's that's how it's pronounced
so yeah so the current progress here is
to
I'm triangulating them on and I will
basically make Pom-Pom which is the
title of the stream says
it replaced cocoa with pumpkin
to make
see this this is sometimes just does it
increase it's supposed to be these one
would think it would be intelligent
enough to understand that but no
it's like it's it's it's joining This
Together completing the panel of each
other
Christmas
with disregard from anybody
polygons
uh
yeah
right that was wrong with me
twice there
[Music]
in ground control to Major Tom
and crash into space
I mean there is
there is
where is
so that's that's all I can say but there
is let me
let me show you
I wanted to go
[Music]
let me show you one
yeah let me see if I can find it first
now I wanted to search for that
foreign
yeah
right now we don't want you
I wish there was an easy way to do this
but
it works
I don't know the marriage right
foreign
[Music]
I guess it's just obvious being weird
again so
let's let's watch this video
wait
where are we going from trying to
squares because it is easier to work
with squares and triangles because the
model has been built based on squares
and then it has been triangulated
and all these squares make a circle all
these squares make this one
they're coming I need you to tell me
urgently
watching pots lots of words
I am confused uh
I see yes that's fine so let's watch
this as yeah
I hope it works
look at this
I actually change stamp active
it's it's perfect
this is meant to be played
if I killing that shit's good for my
glaucoma isn't different stuff right and
I'm confused
all right
but yeah what do you think about this
month
because it's basically oh yeah it's
putting
putting spider into crash
who inspires all animations and
everything
what I guess that's because spider
screens
in his voice
by your animations
a big boy
how to express gliding around
hmm
all right I'm going back to dark mode
Let's see
it couldn't not say anything yeah I
understand some references there's too
good to ignoring
oh yeah
bye
if you like this
I want to watch more of you sir
which is infinite extreme who has helped
me
and develop the code for one of my mods
and
it's very nice
but let's start there's a link to that
video and particularly
and of course download YouTube channel
I do of course have to give credit for
the company my showcase
which is only fair
presents there was another video where
Spiro had me
playing in my sink would actually be
wrong
but then he's happy that at least one
person has
one yeah
it's your best friend now
I think it is Turkey
Jack got platypus
of streaming
there you go
[Music]
all right this practice is so beautiful
hey that guy also made a modifier Cinder
to actually be a black dragon in his
spirit and wait did he work wait
I know the cinder mod was a teamwork
maybe maybe he did maybe he did work on
that one
[Music]
it's more like
it's not that that team made making it
obviously this is perfectly capable of
making it but I didn't remember him
being yeah it says
um
it's more like the work of
foreign
[Music]
and then finally
a Hayden
which is The Voice
reading on your websites it's not
showing up yeah so
[Music]
yeah so he has worked on it and what
part of it he did work on I don't know I
didn't say
it provided some work at least
it is possible that he was credited only
for having like
if I need to try or something and has
actually not done anywhere coming
which sometimes people give
extra credits
I don't think that's what they expected
me
[Music]
it's just mostly because I
think
[Music]
and work somewhere
more technical mods and the mods for
is that the cinder mod is something I
could do oh Adidas mode that I can't do
that's kind of that's kind of my level
of
hmm
[Music]
he's a very modern than me
to expect
I mean it's been a good monster don't
get me wrong
anything showing now I'll be back in a
few yes that's it
[Music]
be that you stayed here for a bit before
you have to
finally come back of
and it shows our social network
[Music]
um
well it's definitely been
over 50 minutes now
[Music]
[Music]
so many polygons
[Music]
before
[Music]
okay there you go
at this screen
as mentioned before it doesn't always
make it great yeah
[Music]
[Music]
I could mean like that yes
all right now
I said prefer to Sweet tongue and so I'm
wondering that's great in such a moment
but which Square should be split into
two triangles
that's the tricky point
to determine
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
like that like that that's better
right
[Music]
she may be
here with Mr podcast day
to me but for some reason they haven't
made sure that Nike is perfectly
centered
and I would quit being that means that
[Music]
means that you can move it but it
collided mirror if you turn off clipping
the camera remix
that also means as soon as it is
attached to the mirror you can open it
you have to detach it
right
and there's my three things
foreign
[Music]
okay
it is shaped in such a way that it
should appear as clothing
foreign
model I will make it it will be a base
but without any
which I then
we'll add clothes too
thank you
and
make sure that these are lines
like that
foreign
[Music]
so now I will apply
when it will automatically put it in a
successor applied modifier was not fresh
versus minus be as expected because when
I apply it it moves it first to build a
cleanser so now it doesn't set tell me
if we made it first
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
no problem
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
mimic the closing Folds
as I mentioned before
[Music]
fantastic
[Music]
but from the other day
[Music]
mesh I'm using his reference
[Music]
of course another idea is for me to
one benefit of
replacing companies that countries
already
like as a female voice I remember this
is the idea of me you're replacing the
voice anyway
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
so
[Music]
I guess purple but it's not that pink
thank you
the links are quite
White
is this thing going to work
or at least going to click to each other
for being
and the message is itself here
all right
well now it's kind of Promise myself any
other parts
so
it's a bit weird but
such a
very fast should strengthen its hands
[Music]
some of his character
foreign
[Music]
thank you
I'm part of lightning because
[Music]
planned
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
now just have this one part come
together
[Music]
it is in a supposed way
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
all right so I just passing the buttons
this message
saved it too much
no
[Music]
interest
record
companies over again
right
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
all right
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]

[Music]
instead of enlarging everything
[Music]
[Music]
and
thank you
cements

adjusted studying
Jake Armory
yeah
welcome Happy singing
with the
moving blueberries
the foundation
[Music]
so yeah
yes
never mind only no based on the title
and my goal here is to put on
foreign
is basically
it is the body parts of a c one point
[Music]
by the legs by the arms why the fingers
[Music]
[Music]
but not so wide it looks weird
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
so
[Music]
that's smooth
and
wait for its name oh
that was too much
I want to balance of that we wouldn't
know if it was like pursue bogging or
something
[Music]
um
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]

[Music]
let's go
foreign
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
all right
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
marked by the shoulders that
that's going to be interesting
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
foreign
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
it
[Music]
is
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
like looking
to fly and everything
I'm just trying to be silly
[Music]
princess thank you I'm
not sure how this will actually work out
in the end
and you can only hope for the best
the king bunny exactly although arguably
this doesn't look like a bunny
but it's more important
[Music]
so
there's that at least
[Music]
so I guess I'll just
match these parts
she can't give a messed up picture but
[Music]
the two parts are in comparable me
pictures
foreign
[Music]
oh
that sounds great
[Music]
so
are we still going to do these
inspired two now
damage run
[Music]
well for Xboxes anyway what and what
games are you going to use on your Xbox
I would assume
it will work with all consoles that had
the same kind of input to to the capture
card so in if you use
[Music]
RCA for example
as long as any console has RC output you
should be able to use that
although it wouldn't be like a fantastic
picture yeah what is up it's Xbox output
is it okay
because it's an old console
you didn't specify which Xbox it could
be Xbox Xbox One
you could also use this shorthand where
the Xbox
[Music]
um console family I'm still going to do
this by doing so soon that sounds good
I would love to see that
and for over one particular level more
specifically
more than any other level
[Music]
you don't need to go for 100 this might
see that would be too much effort
yeah it's enough to because unlike
spider 2 is by one you actually have to
like reach the end of spicy
of this level except to find a world
[Music]
but yeah
at least the first square of spicy only
has a single exception and then it's
kind of spiralized out
of control but I would be there and
guiding new suit
so you basically I want to take absorted
by world and level 2.
make it easy
maybe Bolivia has my back
yeah
when one is seeing what I said before is
because these
textures are incompatible they cheat
because they have from two different
models faces we are making effect but it
doesn't matter because I would of course
redo the textures
so a good idea for challenge One Life to
complete the whole trilogy if you die
and then inspired person you record the
game yes and that was I think the idea I
actually don't know if that was it yeah
I have considered doing that myself and
and in that because I said that we
should try to do like crash one without
dying and like a challenge run between
us
we could do like a collab stream or
something that would be fun
so I know this one basically
let's face that one crash is going to be
quite a challenge because it's much
easier to make a mistake in that uh
spiders
did I say easier
thank you
it wouldn't be fun
and basically the challenge is defeat
the final boss if you when you defeat
the final boss of the game you proceed
to the next game
because there's no idea continue and
then when you find mdv to find boss
yeah I would argue once because you have
to complete to defeat this final boss
two times the second and final time
Inspire three yeah you actually have to
complete that game have you said that I
wouldn't count it as a requirement
I think the first defeat is enough
I think you just have to be careful
[Music]
okay now that's not in season of ice in
your spirit
[Music]
yeah
but I want to do the Speedways but you
have to do the Speedways because you
need the face I mean I can't even
complete season of eyes with that how am
I supposed to do it without the
[Music]
it's kind of
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
because it's a
drawing stream and I've done that in the
past where I
switched it underway for each routine
[Music]
so let's let's go with this one
and try to exhaust on the underpaid
that means what you do yay
really underwear
yeah
[Music]
you want to shame it or something anyway
[Music]
[Music]
well that's all
white lamps
[Music]
so basically have to make this
explode together somehow
[Music]
to see
yeah I guess that's a good amount
[Music]
[Music]
yeah something like that maybe
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
I mean let's see this one's a good one
[Music]
damn
[Music]
that's a good one
wait many minutes
I said I saw one
or did she honest
ly
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yeah if I just sniff beer I'll get try
I can't handle that stuff
[Music]
because
this one for it
take you know more cheeky
I don't know
[Music]
Grinch
I am making a
not first
crash
hey everyone
[Music]
what's happening hey is is that a
question
I assume that's more like and what's up
but I I want
I want to read that as
[Music]
basically
what's going on I'm confused
[Music]
but maybe you are confused we would like
to church
[Music]
right you are allowed to be confused
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
definitely not drunk right now oh
so you are trying to
cause that's what you're saying
laughs
as long as she drink responsibly it is
fine
[Music]
that's not drunk I haven't even had a
shot of thought today
yeah but that wouldn't make you drink
that would just
that's just breakfast
[Music]
it's something slightly back to work
inside the body
[Music]
yeah that's not too cute
anyway
oh no
now you're gonna be sad
and I
am
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay
okay
[Music]
that's what I wanted to I don't know
what happened there at least I could
crack it
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
I've been working
Wednesday
[Music]
that's it
was a quick tune to
and do this I would appreciate it
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
Okay so
what happened today princess
mm-hmm
I'm not sure that when the mirror
[Music]
anyway
[Music]
going on
[Music]
you need to figure out something
foreign
like this I mean I could also just to
know if that's an option too
that doesn't that's just a good way to
deal with it
[Music]
um
hey fun fun I hope everything is going
well
I work with you thank you for stopping
by foreign
makes me happy
care
that means a lot to me
even if I don't express my happiness I
am happy
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
move these up
create some kind of
and more people I guess
and again so say I should probably in
that case
make this off
and uh
let's quickly let's do that
no and then do that okay
this should be uh
now but divides
on something right
it should be subdivided with uh
and recognizing how the higher
oscillation of the subdivision will look
like in that area
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
now I'm just giving it to work at the
moment
[Music]
sometimes I just get stuck
stuck not knowing how to
get unstuck
[Music]
[Music]
understanding
really apply adjustments doing a little
bit later on
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
I do it
[Music]
oh yeah time is if these things
[Music]
yeah and I do want to add these outfits
to my modest one
so you can have
[Music]
we see it
[Music]
and I was in the message
um
I'm gonna get things
let me watch more Western
but people want some Matrix
nice
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
how to sleep
enjoying your stream isn't it thank you
today you're happy it showed up
I'm happy for dance
I know you sleep
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
but you still have to do it because I
paid points for it
I mean I really like the outfit sir
I'm not going to complain
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
so how are they doing
this
so how am I doing
so how are you doing
I am
[Music]
you've been there but it's okay
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
uh how I am doing
I'm doing okay
[Music]
not that I can get ranked not enough
vodka family for me
[Music]
and get ready and enough foreign
[Music]
I have the money for it I just to taste
it now
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
it just looks like a bodysuit of some
sort is not meant to be that
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
passing
exactly
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
maybe that's completely
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
at my ears
again
so I need
[Music]
thanks
which cover outfit shows like defeat or
something oh wait I know
[Music]
I know what that does and it's got this
one
it's not called this one but it is this
one
[Music]
section
oh
there's two textures yeah
[Music]
this texture
and other things that's you're not going
to be able to see at the moment because
I want to fix that
let me open the Shader enter and shade
the editor
and on this one
[Music]
right down there
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
now
it is
how I wanted it
and
keep getting dang all Spam calls they
need to stop me a little definite stop
and that coconut looks like a cat funny
scared something
I guess
[Music]
what it does is basically
if you know 3D models is that they only
have
[Music]
one side of it
self
if you were to go inside a skull
you will basically not see
yeah outside
the from the inside you just see so that
doesn't exist anymore
but that's a very common means Blended
normally shows both sides oh
everybody and green editor does not by
default and that's what's these
they are using here
so everything on the outside is just
this technique but you can only see the
faces from One Direction but instead of
it's the outside you see is the inside
you see instead
but it is a weird effect where if you
look at
like that like this you get this black
line across here
well that's because
on the action models it's not the same
let's see this thing is
[Music]
from this side
you actually see me
absolutely inside cleaning back now
and the same thing if you're looking
from the side but you're going to get
the inside of the arm Block in the body
I started really how I think they they
say with you
it's not really how I think they imagine
it like it's an easy way of doing it but
I think they really want to do is to
have the I want to be blacked out effect
here to render behind the skeleton
but at least this solution kind of wants
I think it's called back face yeah
that's that's exactly what's called here
back face calling
no need to render anything that this is
going to be seen say some reason since
that's true
but this is just being like that
but I would see default outfit which has
the Blacklist calling which I do think
is a bad design really because
and it doesn't matter what outfit you
wear
have chosen it will always use this
outfit for this teleportation
probably whatever software where it is
Miguel
switch normally get around
I don't need one of them that's that's
just the meal of uh expected
of course now I can't see inside because
it's sitting using the black things
well I'm saying this is something that's
that's what they say that I can change
if it means
the least annoying to look at
[Music]
in the foreign
[Music]
execution effect
but you never get a good look of it but
here you go
it's a good look of her foot
if you like it
obviously this isn't the correct color
of its interests
a random texture I'm using so I can see
foreign
speaking
I am here
yeah they didn't do the
classic double bones in arm for some
reason it's not really hard to do
and yeah and there's like
even
yeah I was I'm also shot isn't that
large snap of me
I also there's four toes since in the
Skeleton thing but there's only three
toes on The Swinging model
that means they actually modeled as soon
they're not capitation
I'm gonna tell bones her foot have
because he has four turbos but on a sick
of his details in the morning yeah six
nights what's going on
I will
try to like not to try to
what else
am I even speaking English at this point
so I will make changes from the skeleton
or Pom-Pom
but I'm probably not going to correct
every single thing
plus and honestly I don't have any
intention of correcting any simple so
anything because that's not really
that's not really the style ever gone
with there I'm gonna signify this time
however I would just change it's not
changing the toes to be three instead
point
originally should be the case of of
proper two but I said because you can't
see the feet of cocoa anyway in concrete
I mean if she has three or four tails
unless you look at the three one like
this
but this you can't do this in me
nowhere
then please two of her toes are fused
if you knew together I know oh yeah
since Houston he's dead
to me
can I make in front of it
laughs
[Music]
what an uneven I Live Safe
the appointment is very short feet
look at what must be there so so short
wait for like oh yeah
it's very short
yeah my phone sometimes touching words
without my input I want the right views
but when I tap the design is all the
films to you what I want to guess is no
D is in the middle but I want to guess
what statue tap the slightly too high
and depressing one of the words to
choose from it that only makes sense if
you type one of them talk yet to talk
later which D is not part of unless
you're using a different layout
look at it
[Music]
without these in the middle
and
Turkish
there you go there indeed that one these
at the top
[Music]
obviously
[Music]
instantly at the end that is
in that case it could be a possibility
that the touchscreen is misreading your
inputs right
so much
do you want this person like this
[Music]
I lead a few people like pizza
I guess I'll show it off that
is the food good make me so should I
think it's cute like this I just need to
make it shorter
[Music]
oh that's my clip Channel maybe because
these ones are taking place
I'm sure it's the touch screen because
2018 oh modern phone you got today
um
could be chicken oh okay mine from 2017
so
yours I see you have a 100 in your phone
than I have so
oh my my phone is six years old
didn't work so I see now he's gonna give
anyone the problem I have with me mine
is stuck together
that's weird sometimes
I wouldn't mind anyone that's
not going to spend money on that
and if if I could spend money if that
that's not my priority
anyway
it says like Pom-Pom sized feet sorry
I even got this one was my previous one
I couldn't call the church
in an hour just on standby
that's pretty bad
yeah the
um
battery life on my phone is when it's
good
if I was actually using the battery
would 60 minutes
well consideringly we couldn't have that
shot that makes sense and that sounds
terrible
you know
yeah
at least you don't have to tilt that
anymore
thank you
it's
amazing people expect this time
and it's perfectly impossible to replace
the batteries in the distance yeah
that's not exactly
easy to do for the common folks
however no it doesn't that's my perfect
key
due to that I won't sing
tasty
a ceu works on getting fortnite factors
too
I have the batteries replaceable
as well
having to throw out the whole phone
or
that battery where you could just
replace the battery in their working
phone that's that that's just a waste of
resources
I can't touch nothing he likes don't
miss that resources
now of course legitimate reasons for
another person but I feel quiz
thank you
anyway I bought some Liberty for my
dinner next week
I saved the dinner is for next week and
not that your purchase was was from next
week because that doesn't make any sense
unless you have a time machine
[Music]
deliver any potatoes
potatoes
[Music]
but
[Music]
and did the Swedish word come from the
English word spirola but Swedish word is
singular it has happened with a few

there's nothing wrong I want to test it
in
let's see how it does help management
if the model is acting properly
[Music]
[Music]
now
[Music]
um
[Music]
[Music]
there you go
um
whenever I guess it's a list of things
to be
scenes
list of other things happening where it
states
okay
add team
you can eat now continued okay
definitely not
hydrates I don't mind almost I don't
know
I'm actually out there now
yes I have a thing
and the thing at the time and detain
and all the teams
[Music]
all they do detain
Ed
I wouldn't do the same but
[Music]
[Music]
a fluffy bunny thing and
and in Spanish
foreign
order is the same
very easy
[Music]
the last one is interesting because the
it can mean two things stunts is tail
and swans is
foreign
[Music]
is Savannah's Vance
symbol
see the symbol yeah
pressure test is modeling again how
wrong is they waiting
hmm
[Music]
that is a good question
[Music]
[Music]
a lot of unused
[Music]
underneath
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
weights
where red is the maximum influence and
then it causes rainbow to Blue which is
no implants
which means that the associated bone
being about same name as a group
is on its moves and the vertices the
vertices has a specific offset to the
Bone it would keep this offset to that
bone
multiplied by the implant so
I'm selling plants means that we would
always keep the same offset
I don't care
so
and then if you want some good stuff
and there's
your basic needs
[Music]
industrial detection
because
[Music]
yeah it is some of these places where
you can be a bit fun
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]

[Music]
and because I have the mirror mode name
on it should fix this side as well
[Music]
this is really neat
[Music]

I guess it's fine
let's
slap on
Coco's head I guess
[Music]
we take it for a test drive or something
[Music]
it looks like heat but yeah that's
basically what it is
where the radar would be a heat map
my case
because I hit map it's basically showing
where most of something and being less
of something and a weather map would
would actually be hit
well indeed but not anymore I don't know
what's going on anymore
I always like to be Army because I need
to think I'm very short BRB
oh no I don't
actually I don't come to it because I
haven't installed the required on
another church Justice I guess it
doesn't it won't be a beer

editor for my next stream tomorrow and
then I will test the model
