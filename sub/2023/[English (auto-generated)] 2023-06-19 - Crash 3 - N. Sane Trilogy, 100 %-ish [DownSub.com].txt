oh hello hello sorry for being
a minute late
hello
[Music]
nice to see you here
[Music]
you're always here
[Music]
um yeah keep forgetting starting up
stink that I can dodge the game quickly
but
that's me or an organization
[Music]
all right
[Music]
amazing
[Music]
I got some apple jeans
oh I got connected the cables for the
controller but never actually connected
the controllers
are silly of me
oh yeah we can say released any updated
Steam
[Music]
I never check it out
and it's the same basically
[Music]
important things
[Music]
apparently they should have done
something so the interface is more
responsive and better
Dark Horse 52 Cent characters
that's a lot of care coins yeah
I said I want to expand the options and
I will expand the options
um
so
you will eventually be able to spin
those
yeah
eventually
when I get
because I'm I'm still a bit quite new
wow
[Music]
get everything going
it's Crash Bandicoot
new game next stocking Channel
this last game
should they save in the back of the
music
so that was the special ending of
question
it's getting dark
great evil has come
even once but you cortex
you have failed me twice
it was that infernal Bandicoot
prison
I said you similar instructions to
follow but you lost the chance you lost
the crystals and I have lost my patience
there is now no other power source
matter on this planet I know we've had a
few unfortunate
setbacks
I am feeling generous
there is still a way to amass the power
needed to win to assign this miserable
planet and this time
this time the great ooga booga will make
sure that you do it right
after many years my evil twin brother
has been freed from his underground
prison
long ago I locked him there to protect
the world from his malice
now
free once again
he must be stopped why so much acre
machine in the building I close the door
after that children
and cortex plan to use this time
twisting machine to gather crystals that
lay scattered across time I have brought
you here to recover the crystals before
they do to open the time coffee simply
stand on a button and then jump into the
portal good luck
why
why is it that time twister
my time twisting machine why is it just
a time machine
I'm gonna be a good guy millionaire
hello Coco
this in this game
you don't have to
try enough to complete it let's let's
check out uh
well there's two of them
let's start
with the first level I guess
and I also changed it to Fourth columns
once a while ago I played this game I
played
the EPS one version of email
one and no more people waiting time yes
time okay begin crash crash crash why
must you always Mark in my mud oh look I
have a mask helping me too
we will find out which one is more
powerful soon enough
turn the village
okay it's Mushroom Kingdom
money with
them I do hope you have a great morning
even before I came into here but I hope
that I can't make your money
some funny
funny gameplay
let's say I have probably I can get
before I die the first time
because you just connects them
[Applause]
[Music]
how many times can I complete without
dying
you have a prediction for that but we
like two people currently because I
don't think it is worth a prediction
why was that one empty
what did I collect me I don't know
this works
the level team must
hmm
it's a bonus
b-o-n-u-s oh discover a question bonus
pass
I basically achieved party
the one thing I'm curious about is
how much of the game is actually
possible to do without the power-ups
because I do feel like the power-ups
the definition did we get
I seems um they are required for certain
few things
without them
nice
[Music]
I would like a Christian
oh
nice nuts
strange thing and the gym
yay I did especially for that time
freestyle
and 110
it does
and they wish they made like a swimsuit
and I see times in the first name and
crash one oh
oh my
God
yeah I played the crash game quite a lot
thank you
mostly crash one and three
don't ever expect these two games too
go better than this second hand but
SM on my way towards taking damage
but there's some tricky moments in this
game
foreign
screen
right
and that was that
we're going here
okay
how to do this
I guess that would
that about it
I'm basically started destroying
everything
sure
all right as it's in Sweden Swedish hi
there we go and Kristen
a bit easy in this game since you don't
need a comment because gems to get the
unlike in the first game
okay
destroying Coral that's illegal how do
you know it's legal here
Alice since they are Australian animals
like that cannot be inspirational
insulting
foreign
it is a time machine
it's amazing
of the polar bears crashing right and I
put it by another tiger
probably because
have you changed this I don't remember
okay so you can
in
nice and decent months in the original
game you can't do anything the only
thing you can get the coke is what you
can't even run without aircraft because
I have gotten that power up yet but none
of them walk and jam that's the only
thing you can do
animals
quite a royal
no no
I missed a great
the Chinese is so slow on this tiny
it's nothing like me yeah
how about not missing it's great this
time
Dino it was it was a desk but I was like
that's did he played it you have a cake
I don't know if you want to count this
if that counts as me dying
change
but
the end
no no
[Music]
hey first detention that's the number
three that's why it's Flag as
intentional okay do you want a different
like I never I wanted to make
Nike
I mean I can't make it like Cocos anyway
I wanted to like crash underwear
but it's a bra please
you know
there we go that's what I wanted
the whole tiger segment sections yes
being so slow for some reason
maybe they will get you here in later
and get rich
over here
however
if you um
[Music]
if you have your own streaming Channel
you can have no if you want
do you think people will like that
crashed
crash get crashed okay tiny
tiny is
partly tiny
tiny has certain tiny stitches
why do they have the same tutorial again
look I want to try that thing
I know
and I think
I don't know why it's waiting
checkpoint that means that for some
reason what the same thing doesn't make
any sense to me but
it sees the corner up ahead and she's
Snappy
straightforward at all
11.
I guess
they didn't want the animal to
bye
I need to drink Jam
me my city ideas
now we know my
hair done one thing Steve
yeah
yeah so watch out something so in the
first quest game you're basically on an
island going through going through the
islands so you guys see him moving
on the foot between each level
and then in the second game they get
some kind of Transportation
thing but this built some kind of
teleporting scenes from
one location to a specific location
and this sad game
they have their
not they are not using a time machine
which also allows for teleporting to
different locations
time and space machine
and in the fourth trash came
well
if I [ __ ]
I guess it's not a good Secret by the
name
I guess I should play the fourth game
after this game
it also seems like crashes to me it's
running much better today
or maybe it's just Crush sweet on
anybody
I don't know how my voice sounds like my
plane
because I know my voice has been
stuttering
and one thing
questions before
oh
no
the first action death
you have fourth game yep in the fourth
game they
in the fourth canonical game that is
because this is a big distinction
at that point it annoys me
and that's the mask on previously
and that's when they do travel through
the dimensions
which also includes what I assume
uh
time travel and
positions you can
keep messing up in these lava things
me
Okay Okay jump and I have to slide I
can't can I have to predict Clinton now
it comes
yeah that was too early
okay this is meant to be very annoying
I don't remember him being this annoying
originally
play yeah okay you can't make it
just I just have to be less fanatic
foreign
[Music]
crash game
that was red con into not existing that
was just also time and space travel
but now the actual Force canonical game
is that Dimension time and space travel
um
[Music]
so the second gem is on the Red Pass
so
what will the fifth crash game have in
that piece what comes after Dimension
travel
I don't know why people think of the
Triassic ass being full of lava and
dinosaur skeletons
but it's certainly
yellow on the right and red on the left
which is
the case in
multiple
European countries because you have
those what you call them both sunny side
of the road which indicates like the
side of the road quite useful and like
night driving and snow draining
with the left side you have red
Reflections and on the right side you
have white Reflections even in this case
is yellow
so it's
the case here
in Sweden we actually don't do that
but I have Drive driven in all the
European countries when that is the case
and I do like
Sweden instead uses two different
symbols for the left and right side but
the other European countries does that
too along with doing red and white
okay hey what
so
with those kids
[Music]
so this is the level where you have the
Factory roaming
it was quite
plus every single crash demo I'm not
mistaken before
this one the whole crash one and two
including bosses I think
I had a fixed camera position
yeah I guess it moves along crash but
but then this level comes and the camera
can rotate 360 degrees
and that was kind of neat
now it's nothing special though but
I guess it wasn't technically special
because you had these Super Mario 64
which has 360 cameras
and I do know 360 camera means something
else
when did Super Mario see the four come
out when the crash games come on
yeah I did it I have died
I died the first time in touch not
unintentioned on the fourth element
and did not manage to defeat the first
word without it
well okay first time
and Coco County buses
I don't have to switch like that
stole the crystals but they were just
out there in the open
bloating
inviting me to pick them up
was no theft I mean if you just
leave your valuable crystal on the
ground somewhere
foreign
you can't really blame me for stealing
it can you
oh no yeah
trash break dancing
[Music]
I feel like that he actually takes those
and bodycon
from the side there and they actually
gets removed as those breaks
now there's no no
I still feel like this but harder
Indonesia game because you if you stood
like that I think those on the sides try
to attack you too
you see all right tiny trance there are
more purple belly flop press a button to
jump and then press B at the top of the
jump
I mean that's not that's that's that's
your that's no
what
do a belly flop you jump and then you
press the uh
slide
to do the Bella flop
this power app makes the belly flop have
an area of effect
making it
an effect
per the distance
it's not like you use this button
combination to do a more powerful one
because it's just over a traditional one
gate travel area
go back to the center of this time
twister and save your progress if you
wish from there but you will see that
the gate to the second time travel area
is now open I don't have to go to the
center same
nothing is safe from here
I mean if you go to if you're remaking a
game but changing how it works you you
kind of have to change the dialogue too
at least at least the game was
considering that is considering
considerate enough to actually tell you
to hey maybe you should save the game
what where was I
oh
tiny was a good fellow he hated everyone
and everything
but a good heart nonetheless
be more reasonable with my minions next
time
maybe they shouldn't affect me the
message released was I released it was
so unevident
and in 1964 was released quite a while
after the PlayStation one so I'm not
mistaken
but I
yeah
it was like a year between each question
and I think this is kind of alongside me
[Music]
spider games
but can I still do this
[Music]
my name is
gone
for some reason they changed that for
the European version but then they
changed it back for the remake
foreign
ran towards me I tried to spare as many
as a kid
now so that's that changes what kind of
box they are
weird
I'm kind of red I think
[Music]
very close statue that's me throw Nitro
nature Nitro
I got one
and it's completely changes obvious it
was like one flame is gone
very very quick chicken
this one you might
come on
it doesn't want to
this one is your favorite chicken
boom it's gone
[Music]
then we got one of those bonuses
[Music]
stupid frog
so you basically have to take this first
and then you can activate it
everything
one extra line
[Music]
it's such a long transition
oh
strange
one
only one level
[Music]
[Music]
where that how they forces you to
detonate the green exclamation point
there but
in such a late plan
back to the regular outfit
[Music]
now
hang him high
here's the yellow gem but I'm I'm not
going to be be able to access the jello
gem
yellow yam or yellow gems discover and
finding the secret of wood
for the yellow gem
the yellow game
we have changed the
mixing of the musicians so it sounds
kind of weird to me
[Music]
yeah
I don't know
[Music]
maybe they found the original mix
this their typical because I wanted to
change it so much something
you want to have protein
I want to see
what is a guess
but I do appreciate this kind of level
where I
the
it doesn't have any
turns like I don't want to Curves in the
level
remember you need to go sideways it
rotates 90 degrees
but yeah
and in this game you can also do this
but there's never a point for you to do
that
not just single good
moments
of me
oh
okay I can do this
like that
okay
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay
inches
but I did it
oh that was
I want to get this since you don't know
if they're those two beetros you have to
activate them first and then explode
negative
I got a
[Music]
cut that's crazy thought you meat oh you
celebrating that now you can tell me
you can also do the cheerleader go go
yay
oh
[Music]
thank you okay level eight
uh sadly
can't do it okay so as far as I know in
the original game yes crash can ride a
hog
and they it was kind of the
in someone said it was kind of a joke on
the whole thing that motorcycles can be
called Hawks
and then
[Music]
because he's riding at home but it's a
real animal
kind of being
can I get out the crate and win this
race
we try to win the race Heritage that oh
again another place but
I cannot get the other place too that
would be kind of neat
otherwise I can just
if I if I'm families collect the other
three seconds
continue the game and then the first
step is to well well
bouncing up
the cars
and first step is to basically defeat a
cortex and then I will now I missed it
thank you Sonic trades
oh it gets to run that way
but now I can focus on winning the races
then
we'll be right back are you playing even
speed again motorcycle
is there a single speed with them one
second and it could like the driving
feeling of this game is only
you're not which I do find kind of weird
how
[Music]
yeah a reason why I should have switched
the Press because you can subscribe the
coconut
um because you have a jet ski what no
not yes
okay now I'll be right back
[Music]
there you go but that's a nice shot
moment
[Music]
so you have the Water Scooter 11s
where you have this completely free 360
camera
and
um which I guess technically is the case
we have to
but but here the camera more follows the
road than it follows your invitation
again I did that again
so it has a kind of weird feeling where
it follows the road rather than when
you're actually driving
this is so hard
I didn't remember this this place being
so hard
[Music]
since I didn't win anything I get
options restart
that's what she said yeah
oh what a funny why is it so hard
[Music]
[Music]
it's your thoughts what
only because I'm a cute bunny
how is it because
now this time I got past it without
getting nothing to the dirt and I think
I did it
all right yes I did it no no okay I said
win this
nope
I tried it hid
ES
I'm going to continue this is really
hard but harder than this is done
when first place in order to earn the
power of yourself yeah I kinda know that
I got the second place three times now
[Music]
oh another game start
let's I'm not the only one being
adorable I think you're kind of adorable
too
a certain
he he has some funny
I think it could be really adorable if
you have a dress
I'm military moment
good morning all my uraniums
cars
and yellow stardusts
somebody's son you hadn't seen last of
me of course not never I would never
think that
there you go
and that's how you can get first place
and it's just a sponsor
[Music]
and crash strings down to a little
small but not small enough so you could
still see him
welcome heck
with the triple wolf this time
you're always welcome here
didn't help you I mean you are amazing
[Music]
this is that
the club of the amazing part whole pan
and okay no puppets
gave me orders to bring the crystal to
them during the ice ages
give me the goods and shove off or I'll
roast yes
if they're supposed to be Australian
ancient like everyone speak mastering it
Australians
certainly creating code we should be
Australians
I mean questions
I don't know where they
my voice actually says is from the
ready
what is
yeah where are you going
well e and t
question mark Fox
TNT
a lot of TNT here
[Music]
um
when we need to jump
foreign
and tea
question mark box
C and T they have
okay
[Music]
that was the wrong one but sure
[Music]
I think it's nice and we
[Music]
like one in
nine tens
91 100
.
9
okay you can actually get
it gets a few
okay
these looks dangerous
yes
yes they are kind of dangerous
whoa whoa whoa take it easy
so yeah here's a case where you need a
power up
it means but I can't get the geminist
one
so
I went
yeah
and I apparently can't stand up that for
90.
there is trying to be dangerous again
it's counting me day
almost closing the doors
oh I might I take that
I just
friendship
oh names
that I was in Egypt
is this accurate
thank you
I do think I need to activate this
so many missing boxes
why can't I jump into it why do I have
to stand on the chair next day
and then he's um almost an hour and I
completed
almost
I keep forgetting the numbers
okay here we got another tiger lemon
completed almost two months so that's
one if you can call them words
foreign
intense
that
so what does that Chinese writing say
okay
give me a very short moment
[Music]
from
uh
Chinese
the English
yes use the camera always
oh there you go
get it oh it's just the Chinese foreign
[Music]
yes
I get I I can't miss that one
[Music]
famous high level even
ings
okay enough scissors are handling to
that one this time
I'm angry for you
personally now is every
oh they can't jump over those
oh one overdose
[Applause]
if you can jump over those
okay it's actually not rush
to get to the gym
champion
oh yeah that's how we get them give me
apparently
okay
that happened
[Applause]
okay
so they're gonna jump over that energy
points
and now they are going
in strange shapes
well I thought it was going to fall
after that
what
okay whatever did you say hey change
your tail baby tiger
yeah it's like the
timer before it starts
inside the head start
when you're unprepaid
foreign
welcome
no I don't know if you chose an answer
or not answering it welcome
for three days
I am
happy to see y'all
I am fun fun
and Plane Crash Bandicoot swim warped
that's a lot of words
let's do
[Music]
all right
did you checked out
I don't know if it adds a thing or not
but
that is a chance to send that message to
him
crystals are mine
is
I've seen a lot of people playing that
by daylight
I haven't
but I had no idea
but I am very in it
I am very little knowledge about that
thing
that was a quick attack
let's finish up to get something to eat
yeah that sounds great you can get some
food
what are you playing for it
oh it's so fast
if it was
[Music]
thankful all right I walk into that one
getting distracted
[Music]
it's perfectly fine it tells a bit of
challenge
yeah you have to be getting something to
eat Sanskrit
okay now here we go
I wonder if
I mean
whereas he sends out the shockpoint
imagine if you had to jump over
well well tricky one
or anything more back back and forth if
you have to
get Captain America oh no he hits
that was a very short one I really
thought it should be lonely
carefully
[Music]
they started
a lot of the eyes
[Music]
to jump twice as high press any button
to jump and then press a button again at
the top of your jump and that takes
almost disappear
okay so now the edge should be over
and
said
unfortunate moment for the ads to play I
don't know if I have played for all the
Raiders
but
yay I'm on the bus so it was about to
play during the ads
foreign
swear it
I don't think he's much of a fan of
Cortex
so back to the Jurassic time period or
all right I have this one
I can't do
for getting past points
so yeah sure
that's the moment you needed double jump
but what I'm curious about
is it just can complete the levels
without it
and I get
what do I need
[Music]
okay
then he said yellow yeah I'm interested
so the question is
do I need it to get all the gems the
ugly
all right she can read this read she can
write this one
no I'm not sure why they have to be
restricting distinctive of the other
things right
oh okay
we'll be getting jumped on by that
little dinosaur
kind of big and heavy dinosaur
another way here we said that I have to
leave the dinosaur
everyone would play as Coco if they
didn't have levels explicit pass
I mean you can still
I mean Some people prefer playing as
crash
I think
and some people can have sense that
cocoa as an option
if they Define silly
it's an option
you even have to play like the first
five levels in both teams without Coco
okay that was kind of strange
okay here's an example where you can
power up because which is kind of fine
and these were boxes
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
jelly
I am that's a yellow gem
s
namaste
Dynomite do you know me
oh no oh here's the red one
oh
two masts two two
hey yeah that's the high Click by the
way
this is it amazing that t-rex660 closer
chronologically to the present day than
the stereo size
well
it is quite
fascinating fact that how
long time span it was the dinosaur time
it's quite
whoops
whoops I saw it in an end he didn't
react
deeply me
foreign
that can be healthy probably why Christ
died
here's the crystal
yeah it is
so I had to backtrack that part
when I get to the end of this diamond
that's going to be fun let's get rid of
as much as I can
like that one
foreign
because this one can start Coral it's
just
fresh can't play on its own
so I guess he's not too much electric
ity in the person
yeah it doesn't matter that was sand
anyway so now I just need to backtrack
thank you
don't ever be
it's quite far away
if you can't even swim in here
kind of weird
with her back is
anyway
okay
and then down back here
I wish I had to kill this one
not too much backtracking is and then
checkpoint pushies nice to him
oh
why that unstable stack of
oh oh
oh no
another day
okay they almost tip over
here we go
now stages
of everything
but now
and then I explode it does suck me I
guess the diamond and I get it red gem
beautiful
yeah
beautiful
yay
celebration
[Music]
when did he store that one
he stores everything in different
locations which makes sense
that was that heaven
hi time
and that's the problem how do I get the
purple I think I should you pesky little
rats aren't going to back off
crystals and see what I do
these are threads these are bad kids
I think a rabbit is closely related to a
rat and a pair of cooties
so to get the purple gem
I think I need to reach a point 11.
without dying
[Music]
and it doesn't count this time if I do
that for action points
[Music]
your camera can you move early
well don't do that
so here I said checkpoint seconds
die after this one
but I don't remember if I need this
you can say if I need the purple gem for
the
right time obviously not but
on the way towards the purple gem if
there's any meats or anything you got
let's see about that what about it
[Music]
I question my platform I wonder what it
is
[Music]
opponents b-o-n-u-s
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
do you even want to come in
Vietnamese come again but
completely different meanings in English
and British I said I
don't know because I should take the
platform but just let me
don't know it has its own exit
probably has
when I keep doing this
so let me ask
some extra
I will see we'll see
something definitely doesn't have any
box is considered a little box cam
so what I could do is if it doesn't have
any boxes I could reach the end of the
end of this path
and yeah it doesn't seem like it has
boxes I could reach the end of the parts
pick up the gem and then just buy
[Music]
okay
that is an option
yeah it doesn't have any boxes of course
I can see
so in that case it should have should
it is very likely to have its own exit
again
yep
it doesn't make sense
so that means I had the purple Gem and
can continue now the techniques I didn't
need to do this because I have to do it
again
[Music]
I I don't even think I just supported in
that one
21.
too early
on 21.
[Music]
I could have picked up that one I guess
but I didn't see it was the checkpoint
other than I would have to backtrack
oh that was close
but now when she shoots her hair up
close
tell me
a Swedish expression
I don't know what the English one is
[Music]
it was close but
that doesn't count
so in some kind of meaning for that
that's what what's the expression
while the Swedish one is
you don't you can't shoot the Hair Plus
up and it's basically that
I think like you might have been close
but but that doesn't mean but if you
still didn't succeed or like you still
it's still an entity and something like
that
so it probably has some kind of English
expressions for that
imagine it before I just don't know what
the English is actually yes performing
green
[Music]
okay so I'm gonna go for it first again
trust me okay
I'm thinking one axle
I guess you could look up between his
expression which I didn't see what the
finger if you can spend the Swedish
expression that is
well that's not how you and these things
that work bye
yourself
but in the original cast we need the
head level 31 and 32 they were
officially listed as those two numbers
oh did I mean exactly now
but in this remake they added a new
bonus level a new DLC level which they
live Less in a labeled as level 31.
and then they have unlabeled the Action
level financiality
so have they become devastating now
okay I missed all of this
all mates
practicing it's good in case then oh
that's a whole
Lipsy
commit
great
hey my name is
one in that jumped that means an enemy
started foreign
race track too
I was a [ __ ]
and this is like the
[Music]
it's the uh
let me cut it
Canyons
I'm going to try to go for a lake right
just get it away distracted by
extra life
for some reason
because
you get some kind of dramatic power is
it okay maybe
basically each you have
[Music]
like I thought of them now
I don't know how many should I have
17 now 18.
I'm driving Australia
yep I was trying too much up to it
[Music]
all I have to do
uh missed that one
now we know
but that's tells me
[Music]
okay watch out for this phone now
[Music]
oh I'm falling down I told instead
does that means one trade this time
no it's too crazy interesting
yes just destroy that sign I got to
drink I hate to run over the bike are
you going to change from the sign that
destroy
a sign of drinking obviously
[Music]
no let's just win Let's ignore the
crates
I will win
and I will intentionally ignore these
great some no I can't get the craze this
time so I definitely don't focus on them
foreign
[Music]
has made a huge gap in the road that is
an awful nature
there's no warnings or anything just big
gap all right they put up one is here
for some reason maybe that's for the
close the road ahead back to me
the dogs remember Danny from the other
direction I can just remember that
oh
and now I got first place
okay
oh that's close
and they got finished
in the first place manner
and then brought me over the bike
the diamonds right side of the road
can't you follow the traffic love yay
I guess it's easy if you don't try to
kill before you pray
the boxes
well
I guess I have to go back there for the
diamond later
pull up
anyway
and that was that last level
double header they haven't changed the
pictures of the levels and I do think
they have a bit better
but I never expected you to make it this
far
if you don't turn back
then yes
for the gift
yeah so
double heads
I guess
okay let's do this thing
I guess that works there
[Music]
when you can't do this point
oh this side jumping danger supposed to
be
since the Jam at the end of the level
doesn't
itself count as a box
[Music]
that does mean that you can destroy
every knicker on the level
s
and then get the Gem without triggering
the green expression lockbox
versus a teacher
it just sounds nice I don't know
maybe it doesn't
matter he's
gravity is kind of strong in this one
[Music]
a few
[Music]
all right it's nice
Bunnings
foreign
[Music]
a lot of smoke
[Music]
okay
okay time to
be properly
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
that means I should be able to get up on
this
and there you go
you see anything nope
oh
my food I got exactly 100 that's been
neat it's not exactly two extra nice
oh
hello
Orange
[Music]
now now it's sliding on you
[Music]
how'd you eat
[Music]
obviously
okay let's ignore this one
I'm gonna have to defeat them but yeah
and this one encouraged you okay
give that
okay
[Music]
I can see how I destroyed
before
thank you
when I landed on it
you're supposed to be able to let it on
anymore
I guess I know it's too far behind
too far back
kind of combination of behind in the
back in half
and I still don't stress this
[Music]
oh
okay I'll just jump over here
[Music]
a point
and again
Jam Jam
and that's that level complete that's
three ones I think we call them worlds
three groups three
collections of levels
and now it is bus time
400 I can do a hydrate
do you dehydrate
[Music]
that's how it
and now let's
tackle it Dexter entropy
or was it nefarious trophy what a stroke
is that point
are way too stupid to understand what
you're getting yourselves into this time
you've done it
when I'm getting into your boss and you
know that's what I'm getting into it's
amazing Powers come at the price what
so you're on my time you little skunk
give me the crystals
skunk
he's not skunk he's a Bandicoot
I almost skinny I was clearly yeah right
is someone disagreeing that
I'm testing giant hops
that
craft dead crashing climb up
I could even just
split his back you can't see because she
doesn't care he's
thank you
foreign
foreign
[Music]
thank you
is that the first boss battle in Crash
three that
might have eaten
crash Coco
must realize that this time twister
machine is very delicate without Dr
entropy's constant care and control who
knows what it'll do
well maybe he shouldn't have
a packed on this and then
yes yes
saying
things later
[Music]
get a new pass but I like the blue gems
I think this this one doesn't require
the blue gems yet although it does have
that
let's see I do have the red and the
purple
[Music]
then it doesn't have that the step pass
and yeah
great things
Maybe
maybe let me clear out this area first
[Music]
all right
let's think it
connects here
we'll see
no oh Jerry Harris
eventually escaped holes
so I think I should be able to get
oh okay easy
no problem at all
I didn't know I did that
oh
it actually didn't have any plates
why does it use the bonus platform
um
yeah then it connects him
oh man they should have had one crate
day
did have the method checkpoint which is
I'm using interest Suite which is
basically
a checkpoint but it doesn't count as a
commit
all right
but yeah so I think this level has more
metal checkpoints
on the blue path
oh it's supposed to smell okay I can't
see anything
so I should be able to get the
champ Creek gym
without the blue gem
defeat fire enemy with focus is Savage
hurricane speed what
I think he's more than five enemies
Savage
it is a Savage attack
[Music]
bonus
I'm gonna give anything
oh what
wow
[Music]
I just didn't think Teen Titan explodes
through tweets but
that is my opinion
[Music]
it creates it it
requires
extra effort of destroying those that
you have to better flip flop as you call
it even though it's a
from him
the reward doesn't really scale with the
demand
foreign
[Music]
the image used for the time twister back
to the Chinese
thing he uses the picture of the uh
center with the bonus scene unlocked
it really should have two picture with
it on not unlocked and when it is
unlocked and it switches depending which
it is
[Music]
it's a tiny Decay but
okay bye bye blimps
bye bye please
well there's a song called bye bye Sasha
bye bye Sasha shoot down the blimps
it doesn't look like
crash how did I
this is our [ __ ] please
oh
control
oh now the controls like this
oh thank you fine
[Music]
yeah which I mentioned in a hairstyle
too but
back in the day
that that was applied to camera controls
though
back in the day they had
they decided that left and right should
control which direction the camera pan
scene
but then at some point they decided that
no a
it should be in which direction you want
to see more in
now
and I'm used to it always
neither way should be better than the
other day maybe
and then you're just so bad at if you do
the option these shoes
oh you can actually see them on the
ground that's pretty neat they obviously
you can do that in the original
PlayStation
I kind of didn't have that
because they have enough detains
okay
eight of eleven
and that's the last one
let me be
and I got the gem and I got the crystal
whoa
this is flying with the whole airplane
into the time twisting
this level is covers level and then
there's another airplane that was just
crash level
and in the regional year four she plays
Copeland one of them and crashed in the
other day
but therefore since the haircut being
careful as being able to Pilots
aircrafts
they let you choose purpose yes
[Music]
tell the things
[Music]
[Music]
to my mechanics
weird
let's follow the yellow area
yellow arrow at the top of the screen
the big one the big GPS
let's make it short
nothing even
like yellow orange
yellow orange
yellow in the original game though
when it didn't have fancy gradients
my ingredients had to be a part
detection
there is a bit confused
how do I know
yeah aren't that great this way
there are pants not treated this way
and now I know
can I editing nope
don't do that
you have to go mostly
[Music]
well I did it
oh extra nice outside
I know how to get those
I know a lot of
details about this game
whoops
thick points
it's in this open area
sorry about that thanks
you have to land somewhere else
okay you can get this
knife
like that
so there's a boat over there
go over to that boat
instantly
then you can go around these phones
but there's one DK I'm one additional
detail it's a very very smart detail
there's like there's a gap team
then you can escape Time free
to explore everything Pakistan not space
they still have one here
invisible morning suddenly
and it only stretches straight out from
this area but it's a shame imagine
just leaving level
I mean I understand why they leave it
like that
makes perfect sense
well uh
yeah
be careful now
10 more cleats
I miss the Christmas
the Night Market
seven
three
three
two one zero
and if you're not too because in this
this level does allow you to backtrack
and so if you just go full speed there
and then notice oh no I missed the crate
somewhere and then yeah I accidentally
go into the code
yay celebration more of those root robot
guys thank you I mean are they rude I
mean if they're growing back and forth
in their designated area and then you
come with your Waters
filter which I called it before
and then just ran over them destroying
their boat
wouldn't wouldn't
be rude of them to be upset about that
so these ads are playing let me just
and go get some more
it's chocolate
I don't know everyone watching uh is ad3
but
just kidding let me get it I'm pretty
much
foreign
if they're going back and forth in the
same area all the time
and are they cutting me off
where am I cutting them off
but if they paid to use that area
and I'm just amazing that hey
anyway
back to the game
right tonight back to the game this is
the game
I haven't really paid attention to it
but I'm doing that now because I'm
standing there is this kind of
green filter here
I like lips to me
let's see it's so hard to see
speed track as evidenced by the market
oh I mean I guess you answered the
question about that
say
s
Future Frenzy
polish Rams often have hints under what
powers to use
that's wrong
they often doesn't have that they often
don't have that
anyway
hey the ants should be over now so let's
continue with the next level
Future Frenzy
look
oh
it's 11.
other what I am not
yeah I think I think these things
had an animation before they started
shooting when I say
like they kind of do the anticipation
animation
they have a very very subtle subtle one
as if you look at those rings
you cannot move back before it starts
shooting but it's very very Supple in
the PS1 version they had quite a more
obvious animation than us before they
shoot
[Music]
the stuff that this time doesn't even
have
animation planning
20 easier for my feet kind of dark here
I guess makes sense
I think whoops I think the
um
switch wasn't this switch version of
Dustin parameter
the glass is just a plate if I need to
kind of need to disappear because it's a
meter mirrors out of pitch
but um
do you find that kind of interesting
though because the PS1 version had a
mirror
so what they should have done is
basically the piece one version of them
here I think
instead of actually doing some kind of
mirror yeah
that's probably that takes too much
processing power
do you like a basic form of mirror when
you just put the same objects inside
give me everything yeah
that's an idea
[Music]
what was it worth having here
all right weird
I want to activate on the opponents
bonus
well we'll see how why was that one
doing when I was thinking
the night like and this one has a side
you don't need to use that
because I do
yeah because yeah okay two I can use the
slide jump thing otherwise kind of
Bounce
nice this is a it's just three I can't
forget that normally so I can use that
but four and they need these
nice nice
[Music]
spin I was going to say infinite spin
but long spin I don't know Mega spin
tornado
you don't even need anything because
how did that help me
you might be able to do that
they
tornado spin things
but it is the amount of time sometimes
inspired in Crash one and three compared
to
oh so many times at night into
[Music]
musically so many times I died
nope nope nope nope
sad things that I attacked anyway
essentially lifting up the box so I
could
because I keep jumping
let's see
is this a
robot Hedgehog
or a porcupine
yeah because this is secret opening
um
Why must a crash five going to be
what's the what's the demo selection the
or maybe if it should really be that and
the the
SE things let's say that World War III
will be bought with nuclear bombs and
World War IV would be used by Sticks and
Stones or something I don't know
we're confusing with a different
expression but
um
this level has rising and falling water
but um
so maybe that's that thing should be
used for
Express fire
didn't miss that
so crash one he just walked between us
crashed to use the machine to teleport
between levels press three use a machine
to teleport
to travel and try time and
and then of course between them
especially trans you go between
dimensions
that time and space
I guess crash five would go back to us
working between levels
and that's not here
[Music]
I'm so curious is there something after
the dimension Channel
[Music]
what's like the next thing
[Music]
one two three four five one two three
four five uh
thank you
[Music]
I mean I could just double jump I don't
need a skin pink
to extra nice
maybe I could do a regular jump I just
didn't
once it is
these things can fly because they don't
want to be in the marketing
I don't know maybe don't walk back and
forth
you know watching like walking into
walking
okay
keep me in the head
I'm being a bit careful I really hope I
because it's only 88
boxes I should be able to get
them to get the box jam on this
oh
okay
this this shouldn't have any prints
maybe none of the best around me
that was a long
however sweet scary
[Music]
singers that do the same thing here I
just came to the end picked up the jam
bye
back to the original Temple and complete
intuition level
[Music]
YouTube
that [ __ ]
that's the view Tim
that's the end
all right
such a mistake
I didn't get it
doesn't mean I should easily again
don't ask me how to speak
that should not allow me to easily get
the box gem
yes that's what I wanted to say
crash
knows how to swim
after crash will drowning what level
rises for two seconds I mean
he doesn't he he can't oops
he has like
a one second time you can hold his
breast or something
wow wow
because apparently you can only
he needs his breathing apparatus
candy
bandicoots uh swimming in life
like real life headshots can swim for
example in Sonic you can't scream
now
you think he'd know how to keep his head
above no he's not good at that
it's it's been part of it
he's crash do you think he's smart I
mean you could argue he can race when he
plays playing as Joker
I said when Coke is doing the water ski
but Japan is kind of like skiing
yet ski that's the thing that's what you
call it which was a con first but I said
Yeti was kinda
anyway
she asked wearing her regular outfits on
the jet ski she really should should
have the a swimsuit instead that seems
more appropriate for a jet ski and then
because she has swimsuits version
the underwater levels
when this is over we'll see who is
obsolete
up so Elite asking one two three seven
okay
I do appreciate they have low in the
sound that you've seen because
Ace would be great Annoying
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
shows up for some reason
I'm gonna bring you a pet tiger into
space
yeah I do want to destroy
these things first
they are kind of known
now I can focus on me
the lesson it definitely feels like they
have lowered me yeah
Health on these things are currently
made amazing spaceship shoots
if you shoot quickly that's supposed to
be defeating
and
this is very easy in fact I didn't
really manage to defense
make cracks again
different fruits are the target hold and
left string button to really scan aim
with rejection button and press B to
fire okay
I can't do it now it doesn't power up
that only crash can use individual
I have plenty
but
co-paced upon the unlocks it
was pretty easy boss
I mean I could be better myself but I do
think
it's funny how history repeats itself
yet again engine has failed to defeat
you
must Define
oh my aching head
I'm not feeling myself these days
so the end is in sight gather another
five crystals and again you will be foil
my plan
oh will you
oh
well I will do my best
gun tomorrow
[Music]
oh no I don't want to be gone tomorrow
unlike any parts by any degree no I
don't have a green gem
I only got the blue random person
I guess they mean lips I guess they mean
that's going to tomorrow or something
from
what
why is that not allowed
come on
I got something
well being me science
let's do it
[Music]
[Music]
okay so I need the
I mean I don't
whoops
candy that tea
okay which I think is the point here oh
great in the way
give it that
I think
I think you're supposed to do that
make them
there there are the backtracks
almost had that
[Music]
that doesn't think about circuit let's
make everything too easy it's like oh
it's a cool Power yeah I'm gonna ruins
the game and I also don't think it's
good I don't have
and I
the only thing you have left is
[Music]
a
platforming
I can uh
[Music]
no more enemies
because it's more timing but
I guess
hmm
[Music]
bunnies
I'm finishing this bonus requires you to
use masuka
some things
yep here we go
does that mean I can
[Music]
no I still need to activate this scene
actually
[Music]
do wonder if you can do this without
pressing it
can I yeah you can't get past this
[Music]
oh hello kitten flavor is quite weird
so if I was quite weird stream so fine I
got to go and drive somewhere I mean
that was supposed to say great to hear
you should try
I'm just waking up again good morning
kitten
I think
I'm happy you're here I have I hope you
have a great time
my name is
[Music]
the basically you need to find the
hidden fresh exclamation point
is this yesterday
but the previous 11.
it's amazing that one I think I need
so
Magnum it's as easy to use the Basilica
on the side scrolling portion and the
the snap and depth scrolling I don't
know if you call this scene
[Music]
oh
my geeky to activate Earth Day yeah
I basically need the green gem
the green gem is having a password
17 boxes
which I then kept 16 boxes
oh hello
happy Monday
I hope you have a good Monday
yeah I do think yes question is fitting
for so much
exercising going on in these levels
go go
blaming passion
follow these days I get this there there
oh
and what's the holiday
from this woman that I don't know of
oh they're actually okay oh yeah
youth teams
that's that's us this kind of sounds
like you can
foreign
taking out the part that is not making
it unique
this tablet I understand and say that's
a good thing to send it
perhaps lips no disrespected yeah
it is celebration itself it's a very
good scene
it's uh
it works
it's apparently new as a national
holiday
I didn't have to do that
but it was fun I guess
however here
I didn't want to do like
knockout
honey I did
there's another one oh dude I have to
get scared without dying
killing me to die
oh yeah and then you get back here I
remember that
okay huh
yeah how did I die about that
hey go for competition uh
basically 100 ish
everything except maximum temperature I
would still do the time trials yes no
just the slowest time
otherwise this will take ages to
complete the game
hey what is this I guess I can just go
out with me
nothing
that is what you cannot make basically
I guess you can attack them oh
physically just because it's a bit of
skills I don't have
no
okay you are annoying me
[Music]
I find something I think
but since
I do have to do
underneath the slowest time showers to
unlock the bonus levels
which I'm
[Music]
I'll have seriously study these lowest
times
but
the iron animation tasted so long
my double jump
I'm gonna have to wait for that whole
animation again
thank you
[Music]
oh yeah what's it like if I'm supposed
to use the whoops because I can't get
these without shooting them
but
I really don't need to use these to
collect the
trades above because I can shoot him
there 28
I didn't eat it actually I don't know
oh
yeah I think I need to do that because
there are there isn't like green
exclamation points of them here
see if I don't that's the
gym
the beautiful diamonds
so
but soon
so it has to uh yeah
[Music]
while it's still fresh in my mind
I should probably go for the death and
sing and get the green gem
grass Coco if you have already retrieved
a levels Crystal then you will find a
floating clock when you enter for the
second time
this floating clock activates time trial
mode grab it and the clock will start
ticking race for the end to get the best
time but beware some elements will
change
I don't know if
there's any elements of the level itself
that changes except for the
crates not giving you fruits the
position of TNT neutral air mass
change
and
and when then there are the one two and
three second place that
okay it stops the clock
thing is I guess those elements do you
think
oh I did it
thank you
I see that now when you respond when you
die from that
yes
wait a minute
so this path has to give me gem
but as I said you couldn't get taken
getting back to the level some what I'm
confused about
[Music]
is why don't the other
disrupts that
just make you go back to the level
instead of just ending on its own yeah
this one does not have any
crates boxes I mean obviously not
because obviously copy the first stem
but
so yeah yes this one
whatever confusing oh well I was running
away maybe this one ends like no and I'm
just confusing people now this has a
pack
it says the bathroom that goes back to
life for some reason
it's kind of confusing
because why
considering the other levels not doing
that
[Music]
it's very short
to the end here
[Music]
well I got the green gem
so there's only one color gem left I
think and I know how to get it but I
can't get it now
yay
what do I have now I think it's the only
one I'm missing
and I got the red blue purple and green
and yeah it's gotten green yet
yeah are the 21 games
now I have a green and yes the yellow
one is seen
this one
who is Crash flight level
well let's use coffee anyway
invert your vehicle controls an option
why instead of the hint
shoot down the bumpers
with
battery
I know I'm on this next
that's
20 all right eleven again
oh this one is so fun
maybe there wasn't that way
all right you didn't destroy it
oh
I don't know how much destroy
another year two next
one left
that's the game
well
I didn't
now you can send another celebration
celebrations sorry yay fishing
cheerleaders
could have more animated ones I guess
but I don't know what animations they
should do should he wants
um
like the points
I don't know how to do it like your
animation hybrid
um
[Music]
now I'm out
I'm buggy light
crash Coco remember it is not only
doctor cortex that we battle
beware of Uka Uka my children
he is a far more dangerous enemy than
anyone can imagine when yeah I guess
cortex hasn't really been
can he passed by any all of the column
gems and cortex hasn't really been a
threat so I guess you think that's
correct
he's been uh
he's been quite the lack of a threat
well let's see
I think this is the light now on the
dark level
but not at the beginning for some reason
it's bright out here
it gets dark and they
they're here one of yours inside
the temple with no lights it just makes
sense because I mean
I would have been right inside if
there's no windows or
lights
I don't really have time to pick up
anything
so that's the yeah that one shouldn't
have any
Clean Master to guarantee that you get
his powder
goodbye
bonus
and also if somebody says it has to turn
dark outside too
thank you
[Music]
okay
can I do this
nope
please take time yeah
[Music]
[Music]
okay that's why I love some foods but
it's okay
[Music]
yay I need the bonus it was a bit tricky
foreign
[Music]
thank you
hey
I don't want to do that again
so that's all the levels now to face off
against cortex
hex core
celebration
pom-poms
wait let me see what
[Music]
okay
foreign
no this level
that's the one as you can see
okay one more
three shoes she has some squeaky shoes
learning from a jump with Cam Sonia
boost yeah I couldn't know that
and that's a shame
one more race
[Music]
and Let's ignore the boxes again
go straight
doing
excuse me
um wait how do you understand
maybe we can destroy him if you really
hit them on the corner on the edge
they're jumping over this that means I
have to
I got it
[Music]
second place
some tackling
I'm drowning like you need for speed
[Music]
huh
all right how do I actually get some
lead now honestly
and I need one
[Music]
that is this section
plan and boost
all right
I'm managed to win anyways instead of
that mathematics
whoa and then it comes and turns over
I went there is no I can't face up
against cortex
if base me cortex
[Music]
and then switching back to cash again
foreign
I'm sorry this is the part where I'm
supposed to be angry full of Rage
incensed beyond belief
once again you have outsmarted and
outspun my best attention
I should be rather upset shouldn't I and
in fact
[Music]
take them show me sometimes his first
time yeah that's gonna always that's
gonna help
I'll be
the challenge is supposed to work
he has a force fields so he can't be
attacked
he's angry
now go go go find them
well he has his laser pistol again it
might be used that during the jetpack
Chase
and then turns his landmines
and then he has some problems with his
shield
yeah okay okay okay okay
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
he does throw them
in random positions
they contributed too much
that's kinda interesting
okay no mistakes this time because I
need to be careful about me
my messages three times I think
and then it's
my time
like that
that's two
only one more
[Music]
and this one is going to be tricky
because okay okay let's continue some
ugly tricks
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
no problem
Queen
well I'm very funny down there that's it
that's
first three
this is not fair maybe I should retire
to a nice big beach with a nice big
drink and a woman with nice big bags of
ice for my head yes
a big blue Army
[Music]
so I guess this is just the same
entrance as the first and second game so
let's ignore them
I guess
so I said the final thing now is for me
to do the time channels yeah defeated
cortex
celebration
um do the time turns so I cannot unlock
the bonus levels so I will do the time
chance for the 25 lemons because every
fifth level will unlock uh above level
and after doing the 25 I'm Charles I
will do the
well
I'll try this all right extra levels I
guess the extra levels bonus levels but
they give me a short moment to fill up
my drinks
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
as well
so let me yeah
that's the time France so I do know it's
been actually been
three hours since I started playing and
I usually schedule three hours however I
do want to play for like half an hour
instead
because
that's when
a streamer uh
I haven't been able to watch for maybe a
month now
she does drink three times a week so
yeah I haven't had much of an excuse to
not watch the streams
everybody she is from Spain I think she
speaks Spanish
but do you think she's from Spain
I almost missed that one
and getting the time chance yeah should
be very easy
[Music]
that would be neat
so it would be lovely if people would
join the raid and
she does speak English he she I think
it's been
he wants to get better speaking English
as well
I I say she's pretty good at it
and
where I should jump at the end girl so
first try
and of course
it was quickly to type in the original
game because you had nothing it's
keyboard
on the skin keyboard and anyway
yeah going over there and saying hello
should she's probably going to be really
happy to see me show up especially when
I read
so
but yeah as it's like you start
streaming in
um in half an hour so
yeah that's a good
swimming levels oh my
oh my
the first kiss can get you out of stick
explanations
but you're underwater there's no sticky
stuff on the wood okay let's see how
quickly I can do this
where's the clock babies
come on
but there's a 1430
it's really bright but there's a master
too I really
at least that allows me to get one hit
me taking one hit of damage cement
and that's a second mask
I wonder what you can only have two
masks
and a third mask is that noise
oh I did that shoots that was speed
foreign
I guess
it didn't matter if I picked after first
months
but that's the speed button
pressing this wrong speak button again
count
I was gonna say oh first try and though
I think I should die like twice
but it was so early in the 11th I did
most of the level I'm not single try
yeah I'm happy with that
and I do feel like the time trials are
much easier in a second I do feel like
this game itself
so it probably gets to a lot of these
levels rather quickly
in just 30 minutes
quite funny that I managed to actually
defeat cortex fit in three hours
compared to the
second game where I had like
[Music]
three strings
but the last team was like
one hour one and a half hour only and I
don't know if I went over the time when
they brings me
and now it's taggy time
all right
is it constantly charging if I hold the
button seems lucky
just missed one that's my
kind of ignore that one
I'm so fast
oh you can't do that
I tried it was five that's right
foreign
game because
it runs straight through it while you're
running oh I missed it
[Applause]
so regular jump there
I missed it
down running through the pound
oops
oops
here comes the steps
apparently
Eminem is making cat noises
that's how you do it
wait why why did that sound come now
that was a very delayed sound
I'll focus on that one I will change the
chat as
soon as this time as soon as the winner
lives
I hope for a win
no that was a loss
these time taggy levels I've reached I'm
just a kid I found it really funny as a
kid
you want more kid noises
really you should have paid forever to
begin with but probably another one pays
for that one so I guess I guess that
provides some free ones and sometimes a
demo noises
using just to practice them as well like
why didn't that make me do any noise
I don't know
I missed it it was a waste of time
oh what what happened there it collided
with the box but it didn't break
I was gonna say don't collide with the
one that one your friend announces it as
the clock stops as soon as you land
which is a very nice
families are cheating
[Music]
wreck my cat noises
Kitty
snuggle Kitty
it's a very nice and kind tiger
until it goes off
and becomes
courageous actually doesn't anytime
for rage yes
that's the time right
truck stops of cooking can take better
time cuddling with the tiger keeping
yeah
I mean that's fair right
I think that's fair
and I said
yeah no yeah I will uh I will do the
titles first because I need
sometimes turns to unlock the extra
levels because that's where I get the
yellow gem yellow Jam effect from that's
why I would focus on planetary not the
um I should have taken that one
well that's personality today
Adventure
I've picked up the first one I would
have this super mask now
but sadly oh okay
I do have that unlocked but
I don't think stepping on it waiting for
the whole transition because I don't
think the clock stops if you step on it
and then reaching the end of the much
more difficult
Plus
oops I cannot I did it was from that
okay no no
time save this day
I was just being stupid
apps the first one I think that
um why is that not like that to a swing
or something that's excuse me all the
stuff is behind
look at you
I did it good
welcome Violet velvet Wireless what do
you call vinegar cultivated
I'm doing some
well
airplanes did not trigger on your luck
emote I wanted to do that
but he did not thank you for trying
I need to be here writing indeed
yeah
I win
because it should true if you use the
exclamation point alert you get the bot
mentioning that and it's like the user
is highly interpret the bunny Barrel
and I did it so if you send a message
and that contains
a name in lowercase including numbers
then revert with an up case l
basically an emote it should send it
that should also be value
but I guess the bot might intentionally
image which would be a shame
there's a process this can go
but what else mean
it feels like they can run faster than
hit these drives
I might be wrong there Owen
nope oh that was close
okay okay
up
I guess that's about the way of
destroying the boats without taking
damage
apparently
I'm convincing to know
and this is outside
there's still thing they should consider
making a chicken has a
but I can download the actual time for
it a triple must even in these levels
should it really be that difficult
get this third one poker where's the the
mask and yes for a short time shouldn't
be hard should it
why are you restrict why are you
restricted
[Music]
the truck is almost Frozen achievements
but that's wrong I think
p-o-n one
really paid
in the crash four you choose what's
three letter abbreviation you want on
your save file
and then it will use that for your time
traps still not sure why why the whole
three letters scene is a thing
by getting the like arcades I've heard
that it's meant to be the
the initials
and which is I mean it's not like
everyone has three names
maybe some happy some people have more
than three names
there's something about less
but yeah
and In some cultures like in Sweden
there's no limits to how many first
names you can have
I think it's
accident uh but I didn't know plenty of
people to have two first names and a
single last name but then there are
people who have
plenty of people have single price names
like me
[Music]
and basically most my family
how am I
[Music]
do know one person
yeah the time I spend my time to take
place I'm wasting time and in the family
who has three first names
just missed that one
and also
you can have two last names you cannot
have a maximum of two last names in
Sweden
so considering how comedy is to have two
first things in Sweden plus
it's not too uncommon to have two last
names
that's for example if you have a
quick
she passed with different first things
that could be a situation you can have a
person that have like an initials with
volunteers
wouldn't be too uncommon
well anyway
find this
allow us to type more than three letters
because this is probably what takes the
most time I don't need I could just have
it say hey but I'm getting more this is
more of a credit
yeah
but but what's it I called it
not proof
receipt yeah the receipt that I did the
time tram
yeah look at that I had two names the
technique actually it's like can you do
a blank space
I don't think so but yeah
and it's such an outdated system I guess
our case I say
even though I didn't think they should
have more than three letters in our case
like four or less Maybe
but
like it kind of
think of privacy because you shouldn't
like put your real names
[Music]
okay let's do this
what what happened there
yeah running
um
I've seen pressing the Run button
doesn't make climbing faster
with the machine
all right I do get this one
this does make climbing faster
come on come on come on yes
[Music]
but here is that welcome
all right I shouldn't jump it again
hello thank you
welcome welcome I hope your stream went
well
it's a great moment that you come
because
I
uh
another small Fleet
did we do the uh
obligatory and Penny welcome everyone is
here
the
uh
so nice if you are to show up
does this work or does yeah that one
famous I do have to do it like that
one works I don't I don't know why it
doesn't filter out the at times
when I do the show that but I went
left him
giraffe with the heart
and you're playing too I I did watch him
playing some team right there before I
started streaming
in your
how's this thing going it goes well I
actually managed to defeat the final
boss within the three hours of my stream
I'm going over time for BTM but that's
because I was wanted to plan a rate
which I wanted to do in like 10 minutes
they were lovely people could stay for
that extra rate because it is a streamer
I
almost not watched in problems
and even though I should have
and she will probably very happy when I
read
and to see me again
I haven't been able to share my emails
yet not so long ago it's been
it sounds
so yeah uh here's the end of the 11th
and then I'll get back to the comments
come on yes
this is probably just a good
probably don't get very good on this one
yeah exactly
[Music]
thank you that it's doing strong that's
a good thing hmm
it's well in love
I ended up
did you race quit or it was was more
like
I'm messing up because I'm too Thai
because it's it's like quite late for
you right now it must be past midnight
now
and that's for that
such thing
I can stick around for 10 minutes and
never been happening comments way over
my normal stream today yeah it's gonna
yeah it's definitely late for you now
it was so your stream is
it has such a nice vibe
sometimes it's funny just
two two phones to stop streaming
for some reason the uh WiFi button the
control is perfectly fine
and but the game just doesn't want to
raise the Divide button sometimes and I
don't know why
why
let's say
I can check which stream
oh that is streaming yeah this stream
hasn't started yet
I mean say seven minutes before
we'll see it is still scheduled so I
hope it will happen but you never know
something could have
come up
not hopefully nothing
yes
until the time travel time to get to
unlock the extra elements
I just just in case
ah nice
now which way is faster
today like that
with too many spins wasting a lot of
time in there
but I'm probably going to waste more
time trying to reach it than I came from
[Applause]
next to the chef oh yeah
oh
so close
it went pretty well for a first try
so go go go
yeah I should
in that Gap yeah if I don't expect it I
think I can get across cooking
and it just fell down
and that's not going to get quickly if I
miss the buttons
wait wait
yeah I should I should probably cut the
corner a bit more
there we go
I'm gonna speed running
no yeah I must be done
I don't know the tricks
I should I should have just committed to
it
now I'm messing up no no
that's
go go and then no no
okay I should
cut the corners here
yeah I could just do this regular jump
over
he doesn't even need anything fancy you
can do that in first time played eleven
I have the apartments you have at that
point
okay yay
yes
I'm doing better now
and I [ __ ] it
oh yeah there you go no damage
not that this mags
I ran off so close so close I can't do
that I can do it
I mean I could say I can get the big
ones but that was it close
I'll do it this time this time I'll do
it
[Music]
foreign
I'm happy how it turned out
I guess that works
I don't think damage for that
come on now
that's how you do it
okay don't jump at the end
yeah it was good
whoa
that's how he did me
whoa yay
this is update
stream hasn't started yet I can probably
do like one more Lemon Yay
now it's half
it's like one minute left that could
probably do like one more level and then
and then we make at least sit because
it's probably like starting up the
stream and
obviously like I thought about the Moon
it should be used now like this that was
the wrong wrong level
thank you
if they have like the number above the
alongside the title of 11 that would be
nice
be right back that sounds good
and then I will get 10.
and Time Chance yeah
oh oh oh that's a slip that I didn't
meant that to happen
okay
69
okay
shouldn't shot until I get to the clock
okay
there we go now I can charge
now
[Music]
I think yeah I just need some warm-ups
but before the time turn
nope apparently do not end up up
that's great
[Music]
oh
my God yeah I don't know
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
oh
don't front half there close
okay
and I probably need to stop running at
some some point in the level today
like here
yes
that's the term
[Music]
thank you cup
I'll do this but I know how to do this
now but just being a bit more careful
and
I'll be able to talk
okay the last time was a joke I mean for
this time this time I'll finish the
level and then move on
[Music]
what happened why are my jumps so so
short
is it something like you
stop running and
and then somehow it makes these jumps
really short it doesn't make sense to me
because you should be able to hear
you might miss judging the distances or
something
yeah we'll be a bit more careful here
and this one record
anyway I had a monster snakes point oh
starting stuffing
oh well it's see that
oh oh no
I used to love this seven but now
now it's
okay it's starting I probably can't play
someone because it's time to decide to
study
that I'll give it the last one attempt
here yeah that was it
us let me check if how do I know if this
updates
uh
what
I got
why
do I not sleep
[Music]
well I guess she hasn't started
streaming yet
okay it's been five five minutes past
this Standard time but I'll give it
here's the extra time she might just be
late
I just I really hope she's genius today
because
most of the time she's
it's something they need something to
stop you if you stop running your short
your jumps becomes really really short
[Music]
for some reason
so yeah
he came to
a few more
minutes then
because I really don't get time
what
what was that
what
[Music]
and she's
she basically stinks at the same time
learning these things but
why why why
[Applause]
yeah that works
and then something
I really wanted that one
like today
if I just had it
this is this is only 13 times right is
that first one on this one and then I
don't have to deal with more of these
levels
you know it is kind of fun
[Applause]
do you need some time trends
it's quite something
[Music]
uh keep keep doing that
uh
I guess otherwise you can always make
love it too
yes I said it's this there is that
it doesn't stream on time which would be
a shame
from I can't really come from Seneca
Place that was always
[Applause]
[Music]
because I don't want to wait too long
no I don't want to go up here
I kind of need that mask
if I'm going to rush through that part
planning everything out okay
but you kind of have to if you can't do
it like that
what
I'll keep
[Music]
track
if this dream starts mine
each time I die
all right
okay go around that's nice
really basically just rush through these
parts almost it's running after 11.
gonna take it back up
and then
I guess rushing through that
and then
go I did it
22 seconds
that is 37 seconds
oh I said 370 seconds
and it says
thank you I eventually did it in a
pretty good time
b-o-n
um exercise steaming it no
[Music]
let me be seen
oh
it's been 10 10 minutes past
I don't have I'm not Champion I don't
know if she has a Bitcoin
oh sorry I said I was going to change
today swimsuit but
an emptied so I'm going to refund that's
one
but I said so when she could wait more
or should we just and uh it's not only
two instead
I'm
saving extra fine even though I don't
need to
I'm
yeah what do you think
keep on partying
I mean it's fancy meat place I mean I
can't play okay that's the
that's the uh
I guess there's three options
hey
kept it thank you
you have a great surprise I mean
that worked
oh
slightly too far
you can slide attacks yeah there we go
no it's going very
good timing because
okay oh it's actually good that's okay
this is good no they're working
am I fasted on this thing but I have to
wait for it to hatch
I promise she's slowing I do get one
additional hit points but
but yeah if it's slow then I move in my
[ __ ] voice
he used to jump faster than it
runs yeah
jumping
yeah let's compare
let's say
okay
I guess that quite
yeah I have definitely won that one
yeah if the dinosaur destroyed
I suggesting it so should I say yeah if
she's destroys that one
it actually counts nice nice nice
guns
achievement name is that
wait why did I
did 10 gold
it's three degrees here
I mean is it winter for you now
difficult it's not what we expect
okay it's in the Stream what is
interesting mean it's like 15 15 minutes
past three times I mean wait
there has been on my streams before
yeah is it yeah it must count like 10
gold
uh this one let's give it ah
otherwise because she does have a stream
that is scheduled for a half an hour
late day then it was scheduled for today
so maybe she's
15 for a half an hour but yeah if it's
getting too late for you okay
clips
that was the timing around
why doesn't it get down
why was it stuck up
I had to get to bed so yeah it's
perfectly fine yeah
I don't know why
not fighting before yeah that's it I
have no idea what's going on
perfect okay if you need to go to bed I
understand
Independence happening
without out of all of our control
it was fun it was fun if you'd show up
in that year right all right all right
by the fruits are gone I couldn't see it
that was supposed to come up there and
and I appreciate that you wanted to
follow along even though it didn't work
out in the end
uh 1995
thank you for showing up
I'm still confused right
bye
anyway
have a nice sleep
am I suggestions through the bombs
all right
everyone good night good night
making messages okay
I really need to do this properly
okay that's not how she should do it
properly
foreign
I'm not a fan of the underwater controls
oh
my God
and then at that point I give up
all right I will at least go for
eign
because
oh so close
I keep I keep pressing the wrong buttons
thank you
and sometimes it just it just doesn't
move down
press down
I'm pressing down and nothing is
happening
but yeah I saw a girl for like 10
minutes more and it should if she
doesn't start to stream then I'll just
registrate a lot of the instead
at least I gave her half an hour extra
time because I really want to
that's I'd say that's that's a big
problem with twitch itself you can't
really warm your followers what's going
on
thank you
what
the crash is blowing itself up yesterday
when no
you press enter on button
timing between those two that's so
tricky
pressing the wrong buttons
I am apparently pressing it down
it's it's acting so weird
yeah he explodes when you press to start
it's acting so weird I don't know why
as crash moves up and down
perfectly it's probably the wrong way to
use
the camera up and down when I press the
up and down button
oh
come on
how does that
how does that count as a heat it just
just slightly starting yeah we have a
slightly
and that causes damage
like again it
you want to move down something
it just confused me
yeah that was his bedtime on my part
here we go
it looks so weak that you think damage
it seems to be feeling
like I attacked that one like asked you
to try to attack me I was spinning a
different package
hear me
there's another button
see
didn't
I don't know I I thought you had like
it gave you an extra extra hair on this
point
but maybe nothing
takes a time it's in here
yeah it gives me everything
that's okay I forgot
it's a busy getting started crying what
is that really
yeah
I don't see any like this level so I
just want to get this level now where we
decided everybody
all right
I just have to be careful
huh got stuck there
we go
finally I got gun yay let me
yeah it doesn't
hey I think this is
so
okay
it's probably to 1 to 111 Matthews
more trash can play
that's always fun right
yay
but I'm going for four hours though
that is something that
the uh
start button reacts
constantly
that is that terrible design I think
let's take this level I miss him so it
says that I got 1771. if I press this
button you will press this button and
gets to see the target time for the next
level up
the old is the middle level
white is the platina or Platinum
Platinum is the highest rank
and you can't see them at the same time
that's something you could see in the
original game I'm not sure why they made
it worse because there's plenty of time
to show the time about a Target time
about your time
better see us make it worse something
they made better
that's that's worse
that is definitely worse
and then knowledge is playing Felix to
me but which I don't know what it is
oh yeah not under watching anymore
it kind of stage nothing anybody
oh
[Music]
that's good
then turn off the level ready
to sing
[Music]
come on yes there we go there's some
speedrunning attack
but that's not switch change
thank you
why doesn't
my slide go
[Music]
again some careful champion
come on death
that's what I want my tension
I thought it doesn't exit so
hi jump thank you
[Music]
right
in front of me
I'm not on it
here we go
oh yes
come on come on you can do it
thing

nice
okay there you go like that
let's jump over there
jump a bit early but it worked
[Music]
oh no no no
[Music]
I released and I noticed my energy
was a bit too high there uh this is
wasting time

like that
I did save some time not having stocking
skin
foreign
[Music]
let's go
[Music]
