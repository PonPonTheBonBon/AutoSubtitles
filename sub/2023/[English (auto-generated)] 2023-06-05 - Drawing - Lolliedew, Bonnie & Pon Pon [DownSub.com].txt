and that's
[Music]
me being awkward
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
in that case I know what you
wanted to say
[Music]
I'm going to
get mentally prepared
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
but the moment I start drawing is like a
blackout the darker ends when I finish
the drawing and drawing is not so happy
I would
terrifying oh that's
[Music]
I've had
[Music]
about something like that that sounds
[Music]
and as he said when today's psychiatrist
[Music]
when the
yeah I don't
I feel too awkward for this I'm sorry
um
[Music]
[Music]
I guess
yeah that
and thank you for a form like
an idea of what it is
how to say it's like
okay it's like so
what's what's today
I don't remember my memories but if you
mentioned it before because you have
been here before
uh what's this today your first day with
the psychiatrist
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
especially when it comes to you things I
have little experience with
you're so cold it's okay
can I do it
if we form a character had a colorful
and I like it with a big smile before
this this started to just kind of become
more and more afraid until it became
totally made then there might be against
the turn darker gray and a smile begins
to disappeared
um
foreign
[Music]
it's uh
I I do hope the
well visiting the psychiatrist does help
you see
more progress
and and as
you shouldn't say don't don't like
expect immediate change or something
it might take a while
something
yeah I have it I feel to work with exist
I wish I could say more
but
it's just
really not my area
so if you're looking for Nike I don't
know
foreign
don't feel pressured if you aren't ready
I'll check this
a very great list is made up to 20
and then from opposite because we can't
have an increase in the same expression
then get totally crazy
I feel like I have children I pass it
wait what's up with me
I think of the correct word here
I hope I have this situation yeah I
definitely do hope I
like
I do hope for the best of course
and that the
design artist research does help
and that it is some change
in a small garage of change is still
exchange for a better
when I look at that I don't know
I'm being silly
foreign
I mean

whole scene

[Music]
I'm really shy about saying it

but if you're really shy about it maybe
you aren't ready
[Music]
but I've never said anything like this
so many people before
but thank you today happening it's hard
to form the right way

words to use
[Music]
and I don't know how to say things
laughs
[Music]
yes so continue trying to I'm
[Music]
but I will say eventually because I want
it to sound great

had to go with cats

[Music]
States
good morning
from
[Music]
I wanted to come up with something but
[Music]
from this day
of the European member states
from the crowns
[Music]
good afternoon from Sweden yeah it
wouldn't really be good morning
yeah
but I didn't want to say sweet I would
say I want to say something
[Music]
different
this one should be here
from there now later
when has finished join later already
but is it Daddy wolf
[Music]
yeah see
and there therefore
and therefore it wouldn't be applicable
to me
and yeah I guess I guess the crowns was
my best
the symbol of Sweden is three crowns
it's the more the symbol of the
of the royal
baby
which
represents Sweden's I guess
it still works
[Music]
it's the national symbol of swimming
yeah maybe maybe it's just this color
reading the Wiki page on this this week
rounds now I'm learning oh
okay as report back uh what do you find
interesting about it
[Music]
a similar again about a national symbol
of Sweden and nothing else because I
don't know if there's other things
because
[Music]
it stops working but I do think it has
something to do with
Eclipse Stadium
it's it's probably not as much the
drawing tablet that stops working it's
more that the eclipse Studio stops
responding bring them
[Music]
oh
and in there
I haven't done this issue before
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I mean usually I'll happen often but it
seems to happen more often now I don't
know
if they don't switch software it works
fine so certainly it doesn't have
anything to do with you trying to have
it
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
[Music]
I'm still drawing on the room
[Music]
foreign
do you remember seeing it from learning
games as a kid
practicing what you actually think

however it is from the United States
[Music]
we are using but I have changed longer
since
it is not better than when it's your
styluses
the word brother the reboot it's not an
actual word in every language but it's
somewhat loose translation of Band of
Brothers It's a mixture that is Dutch
German and Swedish
[Music]
there's three crowns above the logo I
also reference to the Lesser National
coat of arms of Sweden citation needed
[Music]
the company's name is pronounced

[Music]
my expectations isn't really
perfect
Bruder band not not broader but thank
you

was it my spirit is mimic the one
from the scene than the other

[Music]
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
Ty
and it's built in Southern New Mexico
and much much less
but anyways the spinning up my work
[Music]
[Music]
once this is all maybe this was all
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay that's not a problem
[Music]
I need to put down the clothes again
hydrate family
thank you
[Music]
I'm standing around in my underwear I
need to put those skirts
[Music]
and then my my dress disappearing again
what could this have happened
who's behind this
[Music]
is
[Music]
I have been working on automating that
part
that
hasn't been the quickest
the easiest way but
because I basically need
so the part I can do which is
I can put an HTML Source yeah
technical
stuff that's my area
but yeah it would basically be a website
because that'd be very very lightweight
way of doing it but it will simply hold
the Deep
picture of pom pom and then with on that
website
uh
it is a local file on my computer she
said it's not online or anything like
that
and it just has a simple function you
run that function
and it puts the request in queue it will
run the request for 50 minutes as it's
planned and then when that request is
over it will run the next one in the
queue if there is one otherwise it will
go back to default it's very simple like
that the only should have but at the
moment
and I wish if someone new now has to do
it
uh yeah that's Facebook I need help what
I need help right now let's get
everything in order is that when you
make the request on Twitch when you make
the redeem
that needs to trigger the function I
have no idea how to do that
exactly so I have the redeem set up I
have the website set up
so it can do the switching I just don't
have a connection between those two
[Music]
and if I try to look up Guides Online
and all they say is that I should go to
some
third party website and use their
their tools
because you can just sign in on their
website and then they will
recognize the trigger and execute
something but that's for like
uh
things that happens when you redeem it
[Music]
that's basically all I can find
I have come 50 or something let me show
that would be nice too I would prefer to
run that locally too but uh but that's
not what I'm looking for I just look for
that trigger and then this solution
don't give
does these Solutions don't give me the
trigger because the website's handling
the trigger I never get the trigger
[Music]
so
that's not a solution for me
[Music]
I think that's America
[Music]
although the the line secret thing
that's what that's interesting
bye
bye
[Music]
this one
[Music]
square piece is thicker anyway
[Music]
so that is what I am stuck in at the
moment
[Music]
that's advanced
well
I guess there is a bit of advanced stuff
in there
but um yeah okay so
but it's
Maybe
[Music]
these lines should we take care
of this color too maybe maybe
I mean yeah
[Music]
foreign
the idea itself isn't very complex or
Advanced or something it's just
I want the function to to run when you
make a ready that's
that's the that's all I want
it should know what redeem is being run
but that's it that's it that's all I
want
all I want
I finished the other drawing
nice nice it's not much but it's nice
this is why I should have my memes ready
it's not much but it's nice
it's not much work but it's nice work
you're gonna get I could set that up if
I had man this time although it doesn't
need the
trick it that way okay
ignore me
but into the hand
one last thing
thank you
try my best
if only other people could see it as
well
thank you
oh it's this one
there you go
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
it's a bit stronger
I can't really see that it might be this
corner
what the hell is
okay maybe it's that color okay
this
perhaps yes
that's it just made that strong there
[Music]
oh
[Music]
no
FaceTime speech
certainly it's a bit like because it's
kind of the color of this shirt
such a nice color
it's nothing to show up
and barely easily
what color is this
it has me confused
[Music]
[Music]
it kind of makes the eyes
visible so I need to
[Music]
foreign
foreign
this is making my head hurt too many
what
but you're not one making the minutes
so basically it's this color but I need
it to be stronger
[Music]
let's stop it it's time
there you go
[Music]
[Music]
something like that
it's
goodish enough
foreign
she's still here
temperatures
it is time
for the next bunny
and I think olimian said that I should
keep these clouds
it might be wrong
I might misremember
I can admit the time
[Music]
unfortunately I'm broken
[Music]
I missed
[Music]
lucky yeah
oh yeah that way all right
[Music]
there you go
[Music]
right now I'm fixing a place into
nice
are you ready to play some PlayStation 2
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
that means that this is
outline
this is of course the film
[Music]
eh well
this is the feel of the green
I assume it's exact same used here here
because
and this is
[Music]
pencil nuts
okay here for the big area
this is slightly shifting apart
[Music]
it's
[Music]
dead makes no sense
[Music]
[Music]
and then there is the eyes
[Music]
and then there is still
sweet
[Music]
sweet
ie
[Music]
and then there's the shine which is
white
that one is easy
other than this mouse
[Music]
I think that's
what this one color
what is this probably isn't scheduled
from this one
[Music]
that should be the whole pet now
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
with one of the memory card slots
and now my dress is gone
so I'm done with that writing I might
say it's towards the end of this
exciting I am excited
I wonder what you mean
what you writings
foreign
another another button next to me
love but fun
um
you love that email
foreign
but it will be more emotes tomorrow
because I will try more tomorrow
tomorrow
and then
because I wanted to be done with this
drawing today
funny isn't
Bonnie yep a bunny bunny bunny bunny is
a bunny

I say what retry the same line five
times sometimes
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
so okay so I need to put the hands on
that
I guess they should be a bit sweet
[Music]
and the sweet is going to be layered
over
the head
and then there should be pumped on the
head office finally then that's going to
be
everything
[Music]
I keep a track of
all these layers
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
these lines are so smooth and nice
[Music]
unlike mine
[Music]
[Music]
laughs
[Music]
why would I have to
draw so
this will be
pun's hand
[Music]
I'm gonna just have to draw it
[Music]
create a new palette on the phone
and I'll send it who owns the character
which is in this case
[Music]
let's create a Pom-Pom palette
when do we have Pony pop
[Music]
losing weight
what's up
[Music]
I can't wait
[Music]
I wasn't speaking for myself here I
guess everything now when I say anything
funny to say
foreign
[Music]
it has since
there are no colored airplanes
black airplanes
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I want to see how awkward it is
I mean
that's what it looks like
[Music]
made it too nice here
then it says to me
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you
oh yeah that's something's shoulder
let's see
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
first please
and keep attracted in the old folder is
from the overlap with each other so they
that kiss you can't keep them in
separate fullness
I love Pom-Pom love
[Music]
so what if someone comes in here and
then pump on his test
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
well it gets in the concept wasn't bad
you just need it
a new cable
after the video but I have my
[Music]
number there goes the dress again
foreign
what do you have to say
are you behind this
[Music]
yes
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
okay but anyway
I'm doing a live stream from a party or
some public events and then she's new
redeem
having hair in her underwear
[Music]
and that would be awkward
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
let me do some minor adjustments
[Music]
and as soon as I have the
[Music]
nursing fixed up I can make it so you
can view up
the outfits and stuff that would be nice
I also never forget to change those
things
[Music]
maybe she sits and actually not know if
she's a bit I don't know
I'm thinking she would say something
sooner or something remember maybe she
shouldn't maybe she should be quiet
ones
are not
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
oh
[Music]
when I first started drew the face he
got kind of an evil look to her
[Music]
that was not my attention
I don't know it looks like she's playing
the makeup
[Music]
not my intention I think
I need that lipstick
okay
let's put the Eyes on a separate layer
[Music]
I think this can work
and then the
heart inside
[Music]
this
is an easy way of doing this
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
let it do the edge color
and just thicken it up
[Music]

somewhere right there
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]

[Music]
thank you

I'm back he's finished a bowl of menudo
and noodle
some bird of foodie
I love the anime
who doesn't
exist
and to get this get to see what's on the
right expect
[Music]
[Music]
take a peek
[Music]
a 15 minute peak of it
[Music]
it's a soup made with
beef right
oh cow stomach
that's what you're trying to see
these things fancy words some people
don't
run away

today we see Saturday beef type oh that

good evening that
foreign
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
laughs
[Music]
okay and to be clear I don't have more
experience drawing pump on them
that's lonely okay I guess I'm slightly
more expensive
buying a drum pump on before and it did
yeah the only time I dropped one before
was that
emote
[Music]
and that's the only time
[Music]
so it's not like I'm putting effort into
pump on
the tea
or something
and I just say it as preparation I guess
if my drawing of compound happens to
look nice and the other team
and that's probably more likely because
final phone is
Dead from the simplest character of this
thing
where but
quite simpler then
drawing Glory at least it's uh there are
less details to look at
this
errors to spot
[Music]
that's funny it's beautiful
[Music]
thank you
I will try a beautiful kitten when when
for that Community drawing you'll see
foreign
[Music]

so
it's a great moment
[Music]
elevator
happy to see you here
look at this yeah I can show you my
drawing
[Music]
is only part of the drawing
that's the reference Let's ignore the
reference there's so much better than me
this is our guns so
oh yeah I think I forgot now I did feel
like okay
it's so cute
thank you
I do wonder how awkward they had fun fun
with black account and lines we look
compared to the colored lines
wanna see let's see what
what people think
or if I should add I'll see because this
should actually be so here's the
original
looks quite much better
it's beautiful
yeah I should probably try to add some
of this as you see how long it takes
if it doesn't take too long I'll add it
so it's more accurate I think that's the
biggest
thing that
makes it look off
and then there's of course a shading and
I've used thick outlines but
[Music]
I've been shading things a bit
so I said I need a
very short break because I've been going
for three hours almost
two hours for five minutes
it's a great playlist
I didn't really appreciate
you saying hi
that's make me happy

[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]

but I have a short moment of
between the drawings
an intervening episode
interlude interlude
yes
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
Italy are passed between as a place of
superfronto University
did a mission well I guess it's an
animation
foreign
[Music]
can I name countries of Africa
okay
did we really do uh
give it different prediction
this is going to go terribly I feel like
that's my
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
nothing actually this is good
[Music]
no okay whatever let's see
that's how it's like this then
you can do it man
if you think you can do it
yeah give me give me something
when I'll get me some more with it
this is an option
put in your points
if you have a crypt you will win
everyone else's points as you can
you know notes
and so do I
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
if I'm using smart
now we got two of these and then
decision
apparently
every person is showing up but now it
doesn't
[Music]
and stuff
[Music]
so and and as usual
if an option that is
an option that no one has voted for wins
I will cancel the prediction and give
you all the points back which also means
that if you are this if everyone let's
make it a picture have has made the
prediction as shows in the same option
that means that either y'all win your
points back or a glass or something else
and you on there you get only one refund
it says
I believe in you and and the Heart the
cat
okay I guess in the one I'm just
going to contribute to this or something
I don't know
if anyone else wants to contribute let
me know or otherwise I will begin
let's go to munch a bit more spread oh
we got some more
[Music]
we need the
[Music]
when did I put the
[Music]
our names I closed it that was my bed
[Music]
we got one person of 41-15
you're super cute and your voice is
super cute
here's an opportunity to vote for like
21 to 30 or
diamond 20.
there's lots of points in play
[Music]
[Music]
LL oh we got
someone puts in even more which there's
no pointers or doing that because
you're alone on that one
just want to put in extra points in the
pot
hello good great timing
I want to come okay
I just believe in you yeah but that's a
very useful to put in so many points on
one option
and it's the my drawing stream but I'm
taking a very short break
to guess the name of African countries
of course no one is allowed to say
anything in the comments because they're
doing the whole thing
but that was probably obvious but just
making sure everyone understands
um it's a welcome gauge
and Greg is a new streamer
has done he's done in seconds a second
stream today
hey
[Music]
welcome welcome so
no pressure
let's see how many I can name
why should I start from the top
I'm gonna take it around this up
okay
[Music]
I don't spend America
my Rocco
Morocco
yeah I'm spelling the Swedish way yeah
area
uh Tunisia
Egypt
oh no
um
well this is
everybody closed
design in Liberia
next to it
seems like Ghana yes Togo
Benin thank you
chat
Central African Republic
a
Dominican Dominican in the Democratic
Republic of Congo and then there's
a Republic of Congo
ose
um
and then there's Sudan South Sudan
booty
Virginia
Somalia
edit so yeah
it's a big one in the middle
Uganda
Zambia
where
[Music]
is SWAT team
is a teeny One South Africa media
say chance that's one that's that's one
where I tried on there Asia maps forever
and a lot of missing ones but certain is
not bad
it's um
it's still I need at least one more
otherwise it's not on the prediction
thing but I want to give up
listening
um I still got plenty of times I know
these
um
let's say money no I didn't there's
money
um
you can do it but like I said man I can
do it
I can do it it
feels like I think it's three countries
and said
whatever and Somalia
this that one and that one
and
Gambia yeah that's one
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
is that in the Caribbean I'm gonna die
if you've had this calling me out yeah
it must be late for you now I have fun
yeah thank you for showing up and
and that's great that's it it reads
enough
and thank you so much for showing up
you're a great swimmer and yeah I kind
of forgot about the whole
time
I I shouldn't have started this
[Music]
video
he's a funny one he has a giraffe which
is funny because I'm doing African hell
and
is it isn't there like a Hillary and
cheese thing I love your energy you're
you can be silly and that's kind of my
thing too
and the Angola is a place
see this is working out
and let's also that's uh without the PIN
that's also a place
and see I'm working I'm working my way
round
thank you so much for invading which it
technically always inventions so I was
prepared just not when you were going to
show up
and but
working movies has been working fast
yeah that was late
oh you're the one learning
too it's fine when you country big part
of the predictions is always fun but
you're cute little button but
um
[Music]
I got the top row it's lucky
it's a huge one
and and I should know that they speaking
in the languages can have something
they're speaking
in that country
that's not that's not the account you
can set up it's just the language
and the
and I think the script is a KS but that
is
but that's what they like uh Ethiopia
yeah
they did have eventually I got the
country
I got guessing the languages in South
Africa that's something
um this is those the small ones then
below Uganda and
wait Uganda
and then
that's one of them
and then there's other one
uh
[Music]
because
Namibia and Zimbabwe
still thinking
and this
I'm still pretty happy with how much I
got already you can do it I'm trying I'm
trying
this is how Tommy
and the between C pair yeah there you go
this one
tiny Island
are the multiple Islands one is satome
another one is a good recipe
yeah coming to my my
family to me slowly
slowly but not within a reasonable time
and more certain islands are not really
a country out there
attack
Canary Islands
that's not the country
it's just Spain if I was wrong
and there's them
yeah
I got that one
's name
no
this is
because one of the islands is great
that's probably because it's France
the list other one is
the thing is
this is Saint Lucia but isn't that
awesome
I think the Caribbean
again
try just to be safe but
nothing is current I'm really trying I
I need I need two more to get there for
the next rank
um I can't do two in like two seconds
probably I've gotten that
never
maybe I was if I was thinking more about
languages but I really couldn't come up
with any languages
all right [ __ ]
Mauritius
because I got them
is
Mauritius Mauritius is in Africa but
Savannah yeah
what is Mozambique
income familiar but anyway
set 9-54
[Music]
that means that 31 to 41 which is two
people I can't see which they are
it's okay but yeah I'm not sure why you
put in the four thousand extra when
you're alone it only makes sense if
you're a multiple people
say 1 to 40.
he's sweet
39 is between 7 and 40.
[Music]
that's putting more points doesn't mean
you anymore you still want to win this
it's fine I had fun yeah that's the most
important
should I do like
yay
new one how much did you win you didn't
put in much but it it was six thousand
that was splits
between you and the other person which I
think would assume is only mainly if
it's not easy
it was put in 2000
[Music]
now you put in one 150.
yeah the 4006 that makes sense right
150 out of 2015 means that doing about
seven percent
out of the total six thousand
so
yeah yeah that was great so you won 419
a and then you got your 150 packets West
so
so that yeah foreign
[Music]
we can do another prediction since we
got more people here we which continent
should I do next
you don't do like America
[Music]
uh they don't have this person has a
main one the days of North American
South America but that's not really
there's so few countries in South
America
[Music]
because I wanted like both
maybe someone answers my one my
countries uh
not Mexico
Central America in terms of America's
eight is set
[Music]
that's almost but except it's not
exactly what I'm looking for
yeah because I'm I'm just going to list
country starting
[Music]
yeah I'm not sure if I'm going to find
what I'm looking for maybe that one made
it
[Music]
oh well
I'm sad makes a few
foreign
[Music]
but that's a few too but I guess I don't
have any more consonants going but in
that case I'll just do North America
because at least that's like
we can't be selected 23 countries I
might like boats
[Music]
I guess a cutie burst at the same time
but yeah the time is 10 and 15.
yeah should I do both
everything right yes so this 23 and 12.
if it is supposed to do both
does that sound fair
because that's uh it has 35 countries
that that works right
that's right yeah
and also forgot to check the uh
okay
let me start one
uh countries of Americans
[Music]
how should I do because I'm not going to
get all of them what is it 45
yeah for five
so then there are them in steps of 10 or
something
Maybe
maybe yeah I'll do that
and then I'll try to find the
the heads of my last run
if I can find it
countries of Africa yes
am I when you hear you decide
and I see my
makeup days for this
yes
because I forgot to check them
I guess I can't see it afterwards
oh I can't
okay here we go
yeah the rarest cookie I got what's Sao
Tommy and Principe
I don't know if that's how you pronounce
it but that's good
and the most known that I didn't get was
Tanzania yeah
from this engine
this is
I kind of said I didn't get them but I
still I mean I I got like the first half
so I'm happy with that
to Egypt this Muslim I wanna
and then South Africa from Madagascar
and Niger is significantly the more
popular than Nigeria you know and I find
that quite interesting
oh yeah
we got some
it's a oh yeah okay so foreign
two people predicting so far so
keep it put in any amount you want in
any of the ones
and also took time for everyone is not
here if an option that has not uh that
no one has predicted is the winning one
I will refund all the points because
otherwise the points will be removed and
I don't want any points to be removed
only traded by amongst people
and that's like yeah I think that's fine
so
and then you put in any amount on any of
the options
and then the winning option
it's so nice having yet so and then one
option it will be winning and then it
added twitch will take all the points
in in one huge pie
and then it will check how much you have
put in on your option
and then you will win that proportion
from the huge part
that means that you technically
shouldn't put in so much points right
away
okay because we got one person
predicting three thousand how much it's
it's fun I I agree that it's still fun
when you do that
um but yeah because uh three thousand
and three hundred that means the person
who sticks with three thousand will only
win 300 entrepreneurs are predicting
with 300 will win 3 000. so it's not
like you've been dumbbell or anything
like that that's not how it works
I find the interest about Egypt is the
people who we consider ancient Egyptian
would have seen the pyramids as
being built in ancients wait wait
what I find interesting about Egypt is
the people whom we consider ancient
Egyptians would have
seen the pyramids as being built in Asia
it's now Anthony
yeah I mean yeah
own stuff
you know in a few seconds uh some more
stuff come soon
um let's do this then
something
and then when this time is up I will
meet
or should I I don't know should I start
I I Never Gonna Save that advertisements
at the same time
I start with this one because I hope you
can get as bad as well and then when
this summer I will start without
and then we verified that before I did
the prediction though someone should
have asked me I can't start
Brazil is no response and China and then
we've got a little Kawaii Chile
um
what
you spell that
wait
it's not called it
no it's something similar to that
um yeah anyway
what more do you have
less Panama predicting
the beta can't combine these Maps
yeah so that's
[Music]
um
take care assistantship some skills such
a point stuff
oh yeah it's just afterwards that are
the ones I'm obviously not as good as
Venezuela
[Music]
tour maybe that now
that's why the yes
[Music]
yeah I'm doing Melodies I love it
[Music]
um
okay
and then it is too that's a French
Guyana is that
is
and that is
yeah
this is starting with s
and that's why I said Senegal but that's
in Africa
and
it'll come to me
[Music]
and that one is to say about all devices
[Music]
which is also called
depending on who you consider the owner
of it
I should know that one it's Venezuela
it is
[Music]
[Music]
Venezuela
uh
[Music]
and then there's just that single one
left this small one
and that is
okay I got like one and a half minutes
left
yeah it's like should I includes I mean
everything I should have it
Panama that's on this one and I'm
waiting for a six to one 150.
[Music]
yeah in Mexico
it's obvious thing but it's this oh they
include all the Caribbean oh this is
going to be fun
obviously they are included
Maybe
and the Bahamas
but that's part of United Kingdom
um
I'm going to forget about it tonight
what that means that uh
[Music]
and then this
uh
oh yeah but you started telling me this
is basically
let's start from North End kind of there
you say like Mexico and and Belize and
[Music]
away
that's the temperature again no I guess
that's not an independent nation
don't mean
advantage and
I know
is it
Saint Lucia
they are independent
and then there is
30 count Saint Martin or son
spent
yeah I don't think they count this
independent maybe not
probably not
but if there are those on the landmass
that I am
and I shouldn't
foreign
[Music]
that's one of them
sorry if I forget your country
but this is one more
and
I can do this
you could maybe do it better than I can
pretty soon from this area but
I'm doing my best
so Angola was in Africa but there's some
some kind of
not simple orbit that's the one I
thought of when I tried to think of what
I'm actually trying to think of
Antigua
and the butter Buddha there you go that
was the one I was trying to think of
and Bahamas other Independence yeah
[Music]
so it's been since
one
what is this this big item I recognize
shape
and if someone had to say the name of it
I would say yes that is great but now I
just needs to know what names
and
isn't this one
big one
we ever think of a different Islands
this isn't Puerto Rico quite a big idea
I know it's not independent but wouldn't
it be great
[Music]
do I just not know how to spell Puerto
Rico
[Music]
we are pretty sure that's how we spent
Puerto Rico and and this island is
probably not Puerto Rican in that case
because it's not great
[Music]
geography knowledge
[Music]
isn't that how you spell it
[Music]
your space sounds nice
Puerto Rico yeah it's not independent
it's part of the United States
this is already 23 independent nations
of North America and so I'm thinking I'm
thinking I'm doing my best
when your Spanish sounds cute
Puerto Rico
yeah there's a lot of Spanish here
Dominica
is Barbados one yeah
it's still not being one
[Music]
Gina coming to me is lovely
[Music]
I mean
let's put for the fact
should we should be satisfying I put too
high yeah
at least at night
[Music]
but I mean
[Music]
I didn't prediction wrong no one said
anything
[Music]
I can't I can't mess up anything
[Music]
so let me see the police station is
invalid at this point but
unless whoever voted for
okay unless kitten because it actually
says here because unless kitten meant to
say 20 to 20 like and that I would get
five five from
the back what is it six from all of them
6 to 16 from the maximum amount
[Music]
in that case I can just subtract 10 of
them but it's only if you're okay with
that
otherwise I mean if you're not okay with
that then that is the the predictions is
valid
[Music]
I'm a little lost now
I actually
like is that huge island
like one of the biggest one that I
really should know the name of but
[Music]
Cuba
[Music]
[Music]
yeah
because if I make this map notch or
something no it's super blurry
you can kind of see how this side and
the design inside I don't know if you
can't see it but
they are gray or like watercolor or
something so
they are not valid items
it's not really a clear map
let me take you to make the countries a
bit more obvious
[Music]
I'm
I'm still thinking I don't you don't
know I mean if if he says like this I
made it like
546 to one zero so that's like six
options the top six option as the top
option and then the next option as the
second top option so if you meant if you
meant it
and second but highest then I just
subtract 10 from every object
in there yeah
[Music]
yeah errors okay I'm only human still
thinking really lucky
[Music]
because
it isn't
[Music]
I mean I say Mexican that does obvious
ones
beautiful human being oh my friend
and then from the one enough we'll see
Panama but what is Panama
foreign
[Music]
still in my head at the moment
the time is going out
[Music]
Mongolia and
[Music]
malicious but that's it that's nature
[Music]
I meant in
those M places I'm confusing it is
starting with M if
otherwise I would be confused
[Music]
no no nothing comes to my head
and kids and nearly a [ __ ] I got in that
one three minutes
[Music]
there is weekend those are obvious ones
a bit more practice and I should
remember those
and I wasn't too far from getting up but
yeah I said one two three four five six
seven one
so I got
128.
and that's outside the range but
yeah it's meant to say 30 35 20 to 29
10 to 19 and then see her tonight
and mine is technology so
so if I had write reading the numbers
correctly get them what I want so do we
consider keeping the winner of this
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
that sounds good eating your area
that means that you mean really
I mean
yeah you picked the option that should
have been 20 to 29 and I got 28. so
you you mean you
want it if you want your points back
and then yeah the the one most obvious I
should have got is a Jamaica so but the
one the rarest I actually got was
Antiguan but bananas the incense
think of another
thank you
[Music]
back to the drawing board
I know that's not from the expression is
used but it sounded fun
how did you miss that Jamaica
I don't know just didn't come to my head
because time is over so the sports Wi-Fi
is away
I mean it's an obvious one if someone
asked me where is Jamaica well that's in
that's that's in in Caribbean if you
want maybe even more specific
over in America
[Music]
did you want to say something yeah
did you prepare a speech you know
foreign
[Music]
yes it's too touchy yes it do to you
[Music]
that says I have a little car I started
okay
I needed to get ready okay that's fine

building up the pressure
[Music]
and I would try to
finish this drawing

[Music]
looks weird of course with the
[Music]
um
now you know how it looks on me
there you go
[Music]
I'm not sure this that was full coverage
[Music]
again it always looks like
yeah it only has two notches
[Music]
there's a huge head
[Music]
yeah I think these because the outlines
are so sweet maybe I can make that
airplanes my body
scene there
[Music]
and I do that without you anymore
it doesn't hurt
[Music]
to find something
[Music]
actually it does work
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
like
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
starting to look like something
looks like someone who knows what they
do babies
[Music]
okay I said that I wanted the
and do that thing
[Music]
because this is
where am I requesting my decision now
you don't
[Music]
just teach everything
don't mind that
okay
[Music]
[Music]
yeah I basically just add another layer
on top
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yeah I guess this is working
[Music]
oh
[Music]
obviously want people in the oven
maybe easy to see with everything
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
oh that's a lot that's a lot
I did not expect that much
[Music]
um
you want me to check it out all of it
I didn't know you wrote that much
[Music]
I thought she was just going to be a
short but since
[Music]
[Music]
you're on a formal
event and you're breaking out
depending on the holy speech
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
last year I completely so I tell you the
short content
I mean because it is a text limit of
500 characters
if you're going to write something
instead knowing just for me yeah right
it is the way to go I mean I don't mind
you writing in chat but
you know
[Music]
of course I
read it
after I stream of course
oh
so I tell you the short one you already
know what it is but I don't want to
touch you
do as you want do anything like
[Music]
[Music]
that
we appreciate the tomorrow when we came
here and we shouldn't definitely never
enough
foreign
[Music]
the hardest part is just doing something
which was the case for when I did my
very first video on YouTube
but just
had to do it
no no one force me to but
you know
foreign
[Music]
if I just didn't take that first step
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
I will have to say sorry after after
after my karaoke stream
[Music]
maybe you should say sorry if not
letting fun upon Lucas
[Music]
you don't have to say sorry about it
[Music]
um
how's it going
[Music]
perhaps it's hanging I don't know
foreign
[Music]
works
I could type this feeling inside a
little bit
doing good playing Animal Crossing um
random Crossing maybe I should play that
if it wasn't
um
like so dependent on the
I mean to like that not that you
actually have to like play every day
and definitely not I mean I definitely
don't have to be everything but but it's
like it's it's so time dependent that's
the problem
technically I can just set the time at
whatever time I want a technique I could
kind of played pretending it's playing
every day
[Music]
by doing that and I mean sometimes
people will probably be against it but I
mean
I started to watch the stream then I
just want to waved but doesn't that work
at the same time
[Music]
okay there you go that's like the first
leg
[Music]
so and then I set it to
the correct color which is that one
lines
[Music]
I guess the
remaining also like that
much work because that's basically a set
so get the game and you can visit mine
and stream
[Music]
I hope you don't have any weird stuff
couldn't even finish the sentence
[Music]
[Music]
Vietnam talk with your favorite
villagers
all my favorite villagers yes
that's prediction who is my favorite
villager
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
sounds like a celebrity Zoom
[Music]
especially since
someone who knows and it is
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I what's you what do you mean
I
I
[Music]
so I have just trying to figure out how
to take it not the time I
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yeah
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
but until then it must be hidden
which is my favorite
[Music]
but okay
now to actually checkpoints and eaten
that I know this is a weird prediction
but it'll be fun we have 13 reviews at
the moment
even if you don't write in a chat you
are free to predict the Visa wish them
[Music]
even if it's like one point
like that
if you follow you get
um certainly certain
and yeah I say that you want to know
that this video you have to wait to make
your guess
everyone has
[Music]
made
their guesses
and kitten has put in his yes
[Music]
buddy everyone else can
fix the kisses I don't know I know it's
a stupid
like 10 options
now
says you know what I want to say
I'm just worried that I might be [ __ ]
for seeing it then maybe you I don't
know if you should date them
too much
what I was trying to say is I love you
Evelyn you're just so kind and sweet and
I know we've been talking for a while
and I remember my stream was yesterday
that I had
foreign
[Music]
there you go
a kitten
[Music]
you're always here for me I was here for
all these jeans
your arm is okay they're nice and have
build my confidence
you're such a lovely person
and yeah
and I
and I guess not I mean there's like
it's like six and a half minutes left
we only got one person guessing so fast
I mean
it's not really going to
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you everything
you're a wonderful person and
I just a hard time expressing myself
[Music]
[Music]
I think so
and now let's see if we get my money is
yeah yeah
[Music]
you're right
I am
[Music]
it can be quite silly
[Music]
[Music]
yeah I knew this would be a stupid
tradition I love that about you
I can I can be
I'll shy enough
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and it's three minutes left and
the only one person predicting Seminole
[Music]
basically
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
okay I'll read it after the Stream
[Music]
oh by the way the dress is back
I really need to get a threat
time into that and I should also have
some sound effect I guess when the
outfit sentence
okay I'm sorry if it's long enough
that's not working no worries about that
[Music]
a minute and 40 seconds left
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and no one would be able to see it and
that would make prediction kind of a
more interesting tip because you don't
know how much people about it maybe it
should kind of tell you how much people
have voted in the option you have chosen
[Music]
no one's going to predict
I expected someone to like his shoes
or something
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
when it's 10 seconds left or something
because
the number should be accurate taking
even if this dream is delayed
okay the prediction is over so uh or
it's a kitten Why did you predict uh
Sasha
[Music]
is my favorite character
favorite villager in our cross
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
ERS because sometimes that could mean
something that happens
driven specific usage from the this
thing because sometimes you want to do a
prediction but you have someone in the
chat who simply knows dance
and you don't want them to abuse that
because it's a bunny and a cute one too
I don't really please but Sanjay is
really cute I have my spelling
yes you did
Sasha is a very cute and beautiful
boy bunny
likes to wear cute dresses
he enjoys that
but the Arabian why did he say that my
favorite is bunny
I mean bad spot guess rabbits and so I
mean that's
actually something
[Music]
my Nintendo switches is for keeping
papers from flying away I don't think
it's not broken it's right back
oh
I wish I had an antenna switch so I can
play some switchy games
[Music]
so I can and then I can stream them
[Music]
because I meant to kiss
foreign
how do you feel
speech
movement of addiction I mean I have to
digital Dimension before I'm pretty sure
[Music]
it's not
because I'm pretty sure it's basically
tells you at the top maybe I haven't
peace on the phone
much
[Music]
am I first king calibration is off
yeah but it's just let's say which
option it is when you like when you pick
an option
[Music]
do you want to donate five thousand
points to the kitten
right here
negative
[Music]
kitten only spends those points on
they happen to wear readings
[Music]
you know it I know it
but has been waiting her underwear wanna
see him
I have one other ways
[Music]
oh what's this Kitten Say
[Music]
it's
probably yes we've found them since that
would happen anyway
yeah I mean you are correct I mean you
would have picked Sasha and then
there was a stupid one
[Music]
oh
for next year
welcome to Fun by everyone
I'm a big fan
you're coming in awkward performance
outfits redeemed but welcome

I only have two babies on my Island
Sasha and daddy
and I already mentioned earlier that he
could visit population
[Music]
yeah I mean
doesn't mean you're confused
I need my switch now why
but what has changed that makes you want
it now
foreign
[Music]
oh
my God
foreign
Animal Crossing myself it's just not my
type of game
abstract game which has not yet clear
winning goal or something
and I do prefer games but I have
individual levels with you
more than an ongoing
eh
thanks
for
um do you have a drawing tablet
I do
yeah I'm not I'm not drawing with mouse
or anything I mean if I was trying it
almost I would be quite
[Music]
that would be quite the skill I would
say
but welcome
which I think you would say it even
though I
I like to say patara
[Music]
Portugal
oh
I don't know I haven't used this switch
in a while I have to be honest I forgot
I had it and I for some reason I have
seen it is

my
so many smooches

and team Xbox 360.
okay now
then enable things look at that it's
it's looking good doesn't it
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
I spent quite a long time on this one so
I'm happy
unless you mean
the actual good one

that there would be a potential for me

foreign
[Music]
foreign

that makes me happy that you are feeling
happy
[Music]
do you want you to feel good
[Music]
okay let's see
I think I have a better idea of photo
do this
[Music]
[Music]
and that's basically to make the fade
I'll just put the mask on the whole leg
but
why did it hurt to be afraid
in fact she could probably deal with it
yes
yeah it looks like these things I just
go to the sides anyway
they don't actually need to stay that
way
they are
and it's going away on the road
no fading needed
[Music]
right now I'm happy
because I told you that one thing but
that made me happy that I was able to
say it again
and I will read your
little message after I'm done
need to sweep
and I was trying to respond to it
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
myself
[Music]
I'll take care of that later
[Music]
let's do this instead
[Music]
you're going up quite a while now
five hours
I'm basically done with this I just need
an idea for like not going to draw a
detailed background
I can do something simple as the
background
[Music]
if there's an idea for that
[Music]
is that kind of shapes or something
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]

foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
let's go
[Music]
foreign
[Music]

definitely be a confirmation with a lot
of words
you've never used that one
[Music]

[Music]
you know me
[Music]
[Music]
there they are all of them
you have access to
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
we are here to be silly that's there
that's what this channel is
oh
[Music]
foreign
foreign
[Music]
relaxing
I definitely did
it's a
what is it relieving
knowing that things aren't so serious
[Music]
and this is to be calm about stuff
it's nice
and be able to
grab
have fun
it's fun to be silly
[Music]
and I thank you when you get nervous
inside it's cute
yeah that's it
that's my thing
nervous and embarrassed
and despite that I present
and that's
my first time but it's nothing nothing
else
[Music]
[Music]
of course
I wonder if the viewer can increases
while the companies in her own way and
decreases as she's wearing advice
if
there goes the streets again well in
that case
[Music]
the dress is gone
because the vehicle was up to 11 before
in stand to nine now it's still quite a
high number
[Music]
people I used
lurking around here appreciate it
it's not the fat chicks
[Music]
at least when I'm drawing is a bit
easier to keep track of routines better
for them playing games
and I kind of miss them sometimes
[Music]
I can't wait until I get it to be
activated that's going to be so
convenient
[Music]
laughs
[Music]
no there you go
This Promise
[Music]
I'm keeping a temporary message
stopping
[Music]
I basically need to cut over this one
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
together
[Music]
laughs
[Music]
type of bunny bun
there you go what's wrong with the bun
bunny
you make a bun and you shape it like a
bun
foreign
[Music]
baking
[Music]
have we done that with the rights
wait what
[Music]
baking stream with rice
[Music]
it would be an amateur patient's dream
[Music]
so that's the two of the city leaves and
now the last name
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yeah
that seems quite easy to promise to yes
[Music]
that's a
discredit your
mood preparation skills
it's okay
[Music]
anyway
[Music]
but it would be fun to do like
maybe she's not going to be on camera
however that I had the idea of what if I
do like a cosplay but that doesn't seem
like a good combination of cooking
but it would be fun though like let's
play today
[Music]
oh
[Music]
I really wanted to cosplay when I did
the time to do it
I want to dress up
since I'm
yes Safari
[Music]
food about five years ago I used to be
really good at drawing animals and
coughing with cream
[Music]
oh yeah I've seen the like yeah
[Music]
coffee okay yeah
totally we did color change that doesn't
matter but
yes when you're prepared
that stuff
but unless he meant like
no I'm silly again but it's drying it
I'm trying animals sitting in a in a cup
of coffee
and and specifically that thing you
would get hit
[Music]
or even worse you sitting in a bathtub
all the with coffee and cream and then
you're drawing and you're good at
specifically that thing which is even a
weird
[Music]
I'm happy funny
cosplaying is fun oh have you done some
cosplaying yourself
[Music]
but honestly I only sound like yeah
anything cosplaying spot have you done
it
[Music]
that's what I meant
yes have you done cosplaying
let me cosplayed first
because personally again of course
that's tell if cosplay is fun enough
but I mean
trying with the coffee with cream is
hard to deal with that much to it
trying with it
no no you say something interesting
[Music]
not not an artwork in the cup that
that's that's amateur
you take the cuff cup of coffee and
cream and using the con content of it
you make
drawing on papers and
I know that's not what they do
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
College changed
it's supposed to be coming up here
anyway
[Music]
[Music]
laughs
[Music]
so
no one used
first off
[Music]
this part
and that part
they need to change into that
thank you
and fix that before
there you go
then it's each of these layers
that look face like this
there we go
foreign
[Music]
how about that
[Music]
it's
looks pretty good
and if it doesn't it
was in this part
and it's so Justin
[Music]
mine are adjusting here
beats to Beach
okay the next
uh
he's a kiss and I'm like
okay but yes I cosplayed many years ago
but uh yes yes but what did you cause me
yes that was my question it looks
beautiful thank you I'm actually quite
happy with that much to do that
thank you
I guess the benefit of many effects is
that you can
select I guess it's like
double-edged so what I don't think I
don't don't think that's correct term in
this case but basically that the more
effects you have the more effort it
takes to do the more chances there are
that you make something wrong that
that's why I say that if you would think
that Pom-Pom looks better than loli does
in this picture I would argue that is
because well only has a lot of details
and there's a lot more chances of doing
something that looks wrong and I've just
realized I haven't filled in this Juice
yet
and but at the same time with all these
small effects if it's effects
all the smart effects
I can't speak
they also add up giving a picture that
just looks nicer just by having these
events
okay
of course you like it because that's the
sound you used to call cat suits
Papa really doesn't fit in front one is
like black outlines and quite muted
colors by Lolly and Bunny
Bonnie they are quite strong colors but
it only has this gradient and
Bonnie has this
although very hard to see Shiny parts
really like that song
maybe it's it
okay the
at the underwear period is over and it's
still nine watches so I do
and so either it doesn't have any effect
on people coming to the Stream
or the amount of people who left was the
same as the amount of people who joined
so it actually did make the number being
stable
who knows
excited what should I do for a
background right I mean it's kind of
empty
[Music]
so
thank you
[Music]
I can cap that it's
done Friday
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
never mind what what do you do
I was blocking The View
I figured out you did okay
yeah I was kind of blocking his head and
seam me coming over here
foreign
a tail if she had a tail it would be
fluffy
like your hair
treason
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yeah
I got this this line is pretty simple
it should probably
[Music]
see foreign
what should I do for the background I
mean I can't do a transparent background
it's a bit boring
but they think
and this salmon pink background is
awesome
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I need something more interesting
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
idea
[Music]
of the same idea but
it's an idea
[Music]
okay
with pizzas or colors I mean anything I
mean I don't know what to do like a
detail
I just want something
no that's that was the wrong note
I want something simple
[Music]
[Music]
since
[Music]
I like this shapes outside
shapes
yes
that's
that's a great description
they did not just
not as visually boring
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
is that different shapes yeah I mean
it's a shape shape is a thing that is
shaped these are squares
yes squares that are rotated
by the degrees
if the road is nice
[Music]
yeah I think this is enough
let's save this
[Music]
saving saving
[Music]
funny still kinda
[Music]
she looks she looks like she has
okay
she looks this looks like she's up to no
good
and to be fair is perfect everything for
her personality
[Music]
two
[Music]
nope no one's looking I was looking she
[Music]
it's just cute
you know online watches yeah this these
are something called diamonds
and I don't think that's a good
time I prefer the term more like rhombus
but I think they need to be taller than
they are wide but I think at equality
and white one is called a rhombus
I could be wrong
[Music]
so don't take my words for it anyway
I'll save it as a PNG
all right I need to copy the phone icon
and that's that
[Music]
and then it would need to rasterize the
picture it takes a bit of time because
it's a huge picture
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
it sounds
[Music]
I don't know
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
I just realized I have already copied
the
link to that foolish I didn't have no
history
silly me
[Music]
all right all right I just realized a
few things
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
because these ears
[Music]
which are made into a gradient
[Music]
how do I do a great guitar
that's
yes
because I need to
since I did a large picture but it's a
duty gradient
drinks array calculate
there you go
will you notice a difference between
this and this
probably not
but yes there is a difference
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yes there we go
this love for our safety video the
problem
[Music]
[Music]
this needs its terminal icon
I'm like that maybe
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
it's been quite quite the right
[Music]
[Music]
so I will finish the this final part of
it
so
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
maybe I went a bit too pretty much with
that
[Music]
why am I sure
wanted to double time
with this fight

to you over
the vending
that
[Music]
all right
[Music]
so now I should just
finish this and sending this

you know the Australia's Dream Will
solitude
no wait
I don't think Lolly Devi is from
Australia
Australian Turtles man uh
uh now I see what you now if you have it
in syncedure
yeah I I I I am tired I am tired I am
tired I'm definitely
foreign
spiders Turtles
tanks guns
yep
and attempting to sing she's not good at
it but she's doing her best
and that's what we can
appreciate it it is funny
to try to not so cute thank you so much
that's
I'm of course
part of the drawing I'm not happy with
but
you say
you are your worst critique or something
I don't remember this thing
[Music]
so um
yeah yeah
yeah I think the worst part is like hand
it looks terrible
foreign
[Music]
trying to make more balanced
it's your choice of course first but
but I
think
just watch her inside yeah
maybe mixed Mixed Styles must Clash if
they are in the same drawing
nah
you could seriously
yeah I was thinking about
if I would switch the outside to Black I
could still try that but
because I was thinking about it
but it doesn't leave so
it takes too much time
but around these days
[Music]
probably eating up one
yeah that's yes basically
uh but I might I missed
yeah
[Music]
same time
as if I do here and she's
and it doesn't it doesn't do nothing
wait I have no sleep there we go yeah
[Music]
I mean
yeah
I think
it's good work
I mean yeah
foreign
has very few names
normally
has its three pokies
because there are too many layers
and if love God
too many layers
nothing but selected
wait
this was not created I just said that
section over there
[Music]
it was fun
you could have killed on a landline yeah
but there's some overlapping stuff too
so that's
so
I don't so I just don't need to say
is respect
[Music]
what is this uh
[Music]
let's
and then there's the range that's the
remaining color
and that is sensitive humanities
maybe maybe nothing
yeah here's the yeah actually somebody I
don't think you would
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
but not doing it is a bit too quick
instead
[Music]
is it because I had that
all right
that keep 10 seconds
and I'm modifying
it's it's there we have finally
nothing
what
uh oh it had
it wrong okay
to be smooth
I mean yeah I think yeah
color marks too I mean that that this
fits more with one I think pumpkin
stands out anyways
but
it's fine with color I like the color
veg color dumplings and then this
question our safety
the hair
in lines inside the hashtag color not I
mean it looks fine
whatever I prefer the other way
I have a favorite color
of course the
it should still have the purple
he did amazing yeah thank you yeah yeah
it looks good here
no thank you I keep it with colored
outlines I just think it looks better
and it looks
it's just what I expect
black Airlines is still works
but it looks it looks adorable so so far
hey I'm not actually
I feel like I'm done so
so it's
I am tired so
I was going to
stop streaming I was actually going to
look for someone's to read
if there's other one
only
streaming at the moment
I do have some options but
say hello
let me sleepy time and then I'm going to
eat first and then I can sleep
I don't know is there any
is there anyone who wants hey
I usually usually I just trade whoever I
want to watch and I usually try to Value
right good night so I mean I did read
Noah's archives before but
he is playing Oblivion right now and it
is kind of funny watching him play that
game so I do feel like I haven't read
like it was kind of recently I read the
team but it was quite a long time
already before that
even if it's like it's doing it one more
time and he has three three watches I
think he needs some attention so he's a
he's a funny streamer
um
and yeah
and while I migrate messages usually 20
feet you can basically use whatever
emails or emojis he wants
right one right how many times you want
it doesn't feel much
and then I would probably watch why I
make food
I think that sounds like a good idea
and I haven't switched you I haven't
since seen and I still have yeah yeah I
still haven't expanded this schedule
either
should I not stand what I should ask one
of it it will be Japan
and
Africa because Africa is like a major
region
and was it dancing once no I don't think
so
I'll start with that
and then I will
and uh
building down schema sketch and see
well bye-bye time is running out sorry
for the rate
and thank you all for being here
foreign
