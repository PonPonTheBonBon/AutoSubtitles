hello
is anyone there
we go
it's Crash Bandicoot 2 cortex strike
let's continue away
and I even moved to the
before I saved but apparently it only
considers which quarterly left
last
I thought
[Music]
you think I'm in divorce area
[Music]
and I did
yeah it was this this level that
going around down the grounds well we
can't dig down into analogies
both hard crash which level is this
you can't go straight
and let's see
no just no level
okay
I want to see
I always always Amplified with my
streams
if I have seen a few people starting off
the Streamline with
[ __ ] people
let me know what you think
is regarding such an idea
yes I think this is the leveling very
annoying to get me
jam on
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
Strikes Back
to crash
ing
what yeah it was close
oh a secret
three four five
three hit point five one two three four
five and there it is
I didn't get it because this game is so
weird inside
content
the mission sticks to English
one of those things in Crash for I'm not
a fan of but
what I do like is that after you break a
crate you will always get deep roots you
cannot speed them away
you cannot leave them behind you again
and that is the design I do prefer hello
hello
just for you yeah
oh I'm beautiful
so you like human I play Crusher but
maybe toilet fresh
[Music]
I'm here to be entertained
and if that's succeeding or failing it's
the same
[Music]
let's team exercise
[Music]
and I must have said
I think
no
oh
this is bigger thing
[Music]
family needs you can't have some lives
because I have been fainting a lot
and also I still have done that
oh
okay
if I'm not mistaken this is the level
where I
well there will be a lot of intention on
this
because that is a box I need to activate
and I have to do that at the end of this
place and at the end of this place
it ends with eyes
and if it goes too far you will slip off
the eyes and complete this section
[Music]
so I guess it's a good thing I collected
all this
try to get some as many fruits as
possible
fruits fruit
[Music]
look at it no
okay you just make this right
he's not leaving anything behind
I need extra free
okay let's let's do this correct thing
all right
[Music]
[Music]
okay this
thing here is very
no problem
in the middle of level you got this
shape
wait some people consider it to be her
middle finger
okay
I think they think the 11 is giving the
player considering the
but
these things
yeah
this part
it's great when you get a lot of lives
then at then that one moment you end up
going through 12 nice and final yeah
this would be one of those moments
look at that jump after
[Music]
did you certainly be one of those
moments
it's quite a challenge
and I will beat it I'm not the one to
give up even though I've given up in two
games please
ignore that
I had a hard time with this letter yeah
I can imagine
[Music]
here we go
yeah
so
[Music]
it wasn't for the eyes but it was purple
eyes it wouldn't be much of a challenge
I guess
thank you and Alexa night
just
[Applause]
I'm waiting for this one
has this what happened
it's the janky Collision of the
character even this guy beats as
like around
like the feet have round condition
if you land
like not probably on to the platform
you'll slide off it and I guess that's
just what happened I didn't like click
on the box let's lead off it but because
and because the
and it talks gaming momentum which made
me slide on the ends
I think division game didn't pass
[Music]
okay
well I do want to play safe there
[Music]
okay
I know it doesn't
[Music]
hit me on this one
this one is moving
why why this moment in Japan is this
what what's happening
because when you're jumping on eyes as
far as I know
is your momentum supposed to continue
if I jump
yeah like that a jump I release
moving forward
but I felt like in Boston situations
before when I stopped moving forward
and she stopped in the air which doesn't
make any sense
and then nothing
yeah
it's physics
[Music]
I don't remember if this game has it
seem to fix the thing crash before as
well but it originally had it
well if you move quickly on the sides
and then run into something your
momentum doesn't stop you you can't move
forward because you're against the wall
or something
but your momentum still exists so if you
start jumping you will then start moving
forward again
and that's very annoying when you do
time frame which the original game
didn't have so I'm pretty sure this game
still has that romantic issue
[Music]
that's it uh I was happening here
okay uh they happen here just
just randomly stop submitting
okay let's see
yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly
that's what happens
and that's what's so annoying
I somehow have to get that box and not
fall down that phone
then let's try it again
it just wasn't without anything
and also have to get back to anything
probably get more shoes
and then when I finally finish this
inside
you need a color gem
ticket the final or like you need to
entry
entrance to actually get to the correct
position where you can get on
foreign
[Music]
yeah yeah
why the why have they designed this like
this
wow
but it will feel great when I finally
game
my night
it's just that ending part that it's
just more frustrating than you
I said these things considering the
design you should you should be able to
slide into them down in front
the ice does feel different
temperatures
in the game
okay
that's just the story I've seen but I
had too much momentum
okay however has not lived in the master
fashion Yeti
yeah I guess much more juice but
yesterday
[ __ ]
how to step in this size coming Parts
because
I mean this is fine
but it's more like this these sections
why why they have that
uh
and I couldn't snipe down with something
it wets me Fame
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
welcome back
[Music]
okay
not just this section left
[Music]
so I need to get through this but not to
have too high speed
[Music]
I guess that works
[Music]
but I just need to get back to
everything
[Music]
yeah that that that that part is so
narrow
okay I'm not pleasing there must be
something okay
and that one
that would make things
I
mean that's kind of not the point of
this area but
and basically ask me a sign and
I can do that
so they can't relationship taste and if
these weeks
hit point
yeah I mean
let me throw a knife
and then it's supposed to be nice
remember
okay that works that works
that doesn't work because that's that's
is an example of the momentum I have an
issue with this game
I was technically
I was not technically okay so I was
visually still I didn't move anyway but
but according to the game I still had
momentum towards left and it was just
and then yeah it was lowering but it
wasn't lowering quick enough
as soon as it moved up again
and that's
I think they have fits I'm pretty sure
they're fixing fresh four so when you
stop against the wall they reset your
momentum back to zero as it should be
and everything yeah
speak funny
[Music]
yes probably because I don't
at least that starts taking care of that
do you think let's do this again
wait I have an idea
okay that doesn't work this works uh-huh
I need
now we invite but I did it
please jump on that one this section
should be removed now
I'm Gonna Leave This section
and then changes hopefully that was
close
and that one
[Music]
and then there shouldn't be any
yeah here it is
okay
okay
and then this is
holes
and then back here
is this single plate
that I need
thank you
I have did it yeah content
no wait
speak I messed up
let me
oh that was close
but I think I messed up
[Music]
it is it is possible to have my stuff
hey you just said I just hate that
that's the
there's no I don't have any control over
that
how am I supposed to know when it jumps
you know I'm okay
don't answer
okay since I died anyway let's see
because
I really suck on my stuff
anyway that's a problem
I mean I shouldn't have died because she
was cheating
right
now I just
put a design and we can jump
master I can easily babies now
okay
I must be mixed it up with a different
level
okay you can do that
okay
[Music]
easy
[Music]
now I just need to pay attention to the
holes
oh that
okay how about
how about slimy sometimes they feel like
the light doesn't work
now
before I guess I should have 95 and uh
if they're destroying on me
face as well
and then you just speed along the exit
one of these
[Music]
that's about to get the wrong thing
today
okay
I'll take the checkpoint this time
I try to avoid jumping over them but
that's what's happening inside
like that this isn't enough timing to
how they jump
yes
okay
very random and then
very very randomly they do that and when
you do that
yeah it's night time and when I do that
he loves the whole yeah like if you do
time track for example you can lose the
hotel yeah
that's another name
and I'm not sure why they kept kept that
to the game
[Music]
I'm actually supposed to I'm actually
surprised that like because they have
done some
sometimes it does confuse me how
how they think that was a good time
because they're playing themselves
they've never never just try to jump
over one of those and then just randomly
die because
it's jumping high and then then them
getting frustrated by that and thinking
now we should probably remove that
instead that's a stupid idea
I guess I guess it must never have
happened or something I don't know
some decisions
confuse me
why is it like this
there's nothing happening
yep
I knew you want something more
of course it's something more
I mean a tank complete that section but
still
you completed this a very hard section
you get nothing
wait that's why honest reason why I find
questions in love be
things
[Music]
if I leave it a hard challenge anything
it's not even record yet
[Music]
renation
where is my remote
I'm like a new park but I need to drink
green chat no I don't have a green oh
wait I do have a green jump good
this must be one of the levels I'm
thinking of
and let's get
okay
welcome to
the stream when one complaints about
this game now it's just that lemon
Secret
and after if I am not wrong
I think
take it
this level
[Music]
contains a similarly
oh
no
section oh it almost did it
how am I I guess you can jump right
around that was pretty good silly yeah
here we go
I'm gonna activate this one
yeah you get created by these
and then when I did fail because
and I fixed it because it didn't mean to
pay attention
I don't have one
I guess I got stuck on Geometry
yeah and then the game does that too
when I press a bit forward
I want to do this
and then it does that I think this came
so broken
I think I did more I don't remember his
name is broken just running reaction is
completely
I mean I'm still lucky I mean cheers
probably
that's the smash crash game on the heads
cheese
issues
mostly related to when it was lagging
so I wouldn't be surprised that this
game also doesn't run perfectly and when
it's lagging and a lot of this
strangeness happening
is because
that was just my shot and because the
game
[Music]
it's not running perfectly smooth
again
it's it's outside my control
if I hurry I can do it
okay
I didn't mean to activate that so this
gem
makes me
think yeah
it is bonus and this is these spiny
things I don't remember this attraction
movies
as I get back
when I get back
I mean more fun if the green gem
that was on the right side it's moving
slightly to the right
and that's it's I can't say for this
game but in the yeah if you ask to see
when you're standing on a
platform like that
character is uh g-string
actually there's a slides part often
it's been so many lives
my life
yeah that's my teacher
and I think yeah it's because the game
doesn't run perfectly in this computer
and
passing these
now is this bad timing
I see these weird stuff
and other awareness
I think this is how he's supposed to I
don't know
because that's slightly here
let me do that here
but
I jumped a little bit too early
okay
on that one
bye hello
let's watch fun fun sprinkles do this
thing
okay
foreign
what
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
yes
I should probably take this
wait
why don't we show why don't you show me
what's down there what's wrong with the
camera
thank you
how I see that
all right
hi Kitty assistant work
I can still give it a try though
yep yeah this is in which I'll ignore it
okay selfies don't okay
DTM the second chance
yes now two five four right
[Music]
everybody
way too far for it
foreign
[Music]
I mean
you could just go and get the Gem
I am after all going for a 100 accepted
time chance so the 100 of the original
Clash team
hey now I should not take the Green Path
as it doesn't give me anything
yes that one
time to connect
oh I think too long
oh thank you
[Music]
all right
I will start the second one with my
invisibility
I can't accept the game away
okay
yeah
email nothing extra lives now I need
some and I don't need
11 fruits here and then I'll get an
extra large
extra
so
yeah
you can't get up on the screen
so there's at least one extra day
it's not my single streets
yeah let's see there's nobody needs me
anyways what
[Music]
I didn't jump too high I didn't even
need to pick the first one
that was a mistake
thank you
except they need some head pets
I've been struggling
[Music]
what's up
sometimes I just wanted puppy jump
not nice
oh it it actually needs me
that was a surprise
that's an idea
you chill yourself from expressions
but that's not the thing in crotch as
far as I know
[Music]
yeah that's an example of this
from the tree
[Music]
if no one is a fan of
[Applause]
whoops there are some weird physics
oh wait a minute
I need to get up on the stack
yeah no
all right that was a mistake
hey
so
that would be awkward thing again oh
okay what's going on
okay
that's fine I can't okay the way from
the explosion
and that's not supposed to be a
functioning game
but I'm thinking
discouraged something
weird
and there you go that's two extra lives
[Music]
[Music]
now do not lose them again
okay so that wasn't too far off from
that we might be nice again
to read a quick bonus
there you go take mine
yay oh it's all right
more time to Celebration
hmm
yeah I definitely
why did I do that where's the uh where's
the Facebook
I guess both works I already wasted all
my extra lives
County 25 more
okay one more
oh no I need to get that
and that's not how you did
okay
that's the game over
no I
they automatically try the level because
I had to quit the game
because
this game is very designed
because apparently if you get the game
over it still remembers all the extra
lives picked up in 11 and you don't get
to pick them up again so you have to
commit
that's the first game over
please
and
wait for the game two loads the menu is
apparently takes quite a while I guess
it's quite the see my mom is here
and then if you go back to the game and
that was like crash one
on this because
for some reason
they thought that the actual lives
shouldn't come back just because he died
next left let's come back when you
oh yeah
when you get to the goal of the level
the exercise come back at least for all
other levels
it is fine
if they really should come because your
live cam please reset back the point
which means that you have timelines more
extra just the one you're using
by the way
but they don't reset on the knives it's
really
fair at least in there
statins
I could see uh them being a big Donkey
Kong is
you get to leave oh wait
okay I'm definitely
okay and then I have to defeated this
one but at least I know oh my three
yeah I don't remember how I did that all
the time
if I have some some reason man this is
like into it and breaking
it's not meant to do that
when it was pretty weak
and I don't get any white those two
which
I have time challenge to get
hahaha
why they don't have me it's more trees
like like extra life
foreign
[Music]
I mean I take it I kind of need it
and I do need the crates too so first
try anything I mean
[Music]
like it's first try after
previously completing it
I'm gonna try
hurry away
that was close
okay bye
no extra knives
I like it's so nice
and you have to
adjust your position hey
more exercise
that's
there you go
that's what I want
to be quick enough do you like anything
yesterday well I did it
no first try no I don't remember if I
died
now it's success now I'm doing demanding
one
five times celebration
100 number two
foreign
[Music]
behave
a special gem lies Beyond a clever
deception
yeah I know about this one wait there's
a special gem
I didn't actually give it a special
check
bye bye
but that's a bad Challenge and
get through this level without going
down
without being
one picture that it also like an actual
issues fall into the ground
like snooting around throwing kind of
like
good afternoon
thank you Denise
without Stevie
I'm not sure the beginning it seems like
the creation oh there's more this time
it was too
okay I guess I'm not sure without taking
them
oh yeah that's the problem
great job
[Music]
you have to be killer monkey
that worked
look at these
thank you
she's quite skillful
okay thank you
that's like the bees
but not the bees
I suggest in order to please it's not
why
wasting my life Sunday
oh yeah nice nice
do that team
let's do it yet
it's nice nice
I do like that
apparently doesn't work here because
there are no
[Music]
there you go
well I guess this is a sweet memories
I said take it okay
bug out
I'm pressing it button
I had to check what the keyboard keys
for it
tap I can do that
the attack works okay it's a lot small
things
because these does not jump
this Audrey and
I don't remember it being a champ but
oh
excuse me
what
oh
maybe and this is weird
and then that's a good steady I think
they didn't explode
I just kind of weird how they put the
stacks there anyway
and of course
didn't exist down there
okay
oh my
foreign
actually
whoa that was close
nice touch
and the last clear is that you can step
on them don't wait
oh oh do I have to leave it now
see that
oh yeah
I can't wait
why am I
am why is the game
dragging out awesome thank you
good night
yeah
okay
I won't wait a minute for the game too
stop struggling
probably just leave it
anyway
this Nature Box okay that's Shake okay
I'll take it back
because you made to jump early
because he did not make me come
even though they didn't do that with
another father once you have to jump
excuse me
oh you can't make that
what is me
wasn't even a bonus level
wait okay yeah
why was that bonus platform at the end
he wasn't even a bonus then
Seth what
hey such snail bites yeah they are very
weird
hello kitten you're
I
can't
we have Turtle you ever see that turtle
with zombies in the back
okay Vanessa I'm here says kitten
welcome kitten
I'm happier here
I wanted to hurry back
okay I can do that I don't excuse me
you're not supposed to get each other
a bit
eager
Ness
eat the pumpkin
how's it going for you
haven't seen the island here for a while
foreign
foreign
[Music]
it's weird
let's say that
okay
I'm happy to be here you change it I'm
happy that you're here too
I love everyone coming by and
then hello
even if he is lurking even even even if
it's just that hello
I'm just going to start kissing nice
to know that you're
around
I guess that was
okay someone once just came and he said
Lark immediately and that was it that
was the only message
I found it uh surprising I still
appreciate it
was funny
[Music]
man's trash wait did I get a second
number
[Music]
anyway
I got 22 of 42 I got oh maybe it is get
half the number of gems required
I would definitely
I added something something
I have discovered that the opposition is
being masterminded by Dr nitrus Brio the
inventor of the evolvo Ring prio was
responsible for our
misunderstandings in the past
forced me to assist him in his plot for
world domination that he's at it again
attempt to stand our way
be on your guard crash
deliver the crystals to engine
like everything now what you can't hear
about that
hey
liar
nice screenshot
you are a liar
no wait no that's what he wrote
yeah
I know what he tried to write I was
making fun of your spelling because
that's what I did
mind
and I said this is such a weird fight
because
he actually has the same animation
that's really neat
because you never get uh
activation where
you would be
oh nice that was actually first one
again
because you never got a situation where
you would do the effect
and the game doesn't even tell me
is that is this something connected
for every chance that and you don't even
have fruits sometimes
life
okay
it's traffic
apparently
he's a kid I forgot that if I said sorry
thank you
so bad
can destroy high-tech in my Parks okay
sure
I mean
yeah
apples
it looks more like mangoes but
if you were to pick up an apple and
throw it at
not just one you have to pick up
multiple
what was that the original game had an
animation it just turns green and then
disappeared
[Music]
and make red
hit them
because everybody's going to have a
rhyme like that well
first try
he's a boss
yay bad average
very amazing thank you thank you
okay
let's go here and move up
to the final area wait a minute
no the six lives
still do want to do no I wanted to move
out
[Music]
pass it
[Music]
but if that's allowed to forget scene
with crash or we can actually see
me I mean
you can see the pictures of the lemons
which helps the damage this was it
no
how's it hanging out
well I had to do that time thing
charge everything right after this life
create the distance yeah that must be
nice tonight right
nope
it was in this level
thank you for early celebration what
field of science this car to extending
and do the new study
okay
well um
the science of evil
[Music]
I'm confusing myself
[Music]
this is
biology and in neurology I can see but
sense
the hearing aids was the first one with
the timer
so I'm looking for another one
Plus
and this one
there's no extra gems here to comments
[Music]
I'm pretty sure
[Music]
what
that food yes
it must be planted
what's that be the time to add a special
gem yes I have gotten the special gem
because I haven't put my time with that
Coco reach out for the polar bear but
there you go wait maybe maybe yes good
idea good that already man I actually
did restart the game maybe next time
and I said
I understand that you can't quit because
you shouldn't do it in the air but when
you're responding you should be happy to
do that
and if the game didn't have extra lives
you could do that too
okay let me see if that works and I kind
of need extra lives too
but I'll probably say anything that
timing let's see if it works
apparently I got plenty
[Music]
how many times was he
yeah I don't think it'd work
what's this
anyway
what did you find funny even that's
remembering last letter of cocoa becomes
caught
or Coke
because cocoa zip code and one abused
well I mean
I didn't decided to abusing polar bear
would give you extra knives
it's Greek
I also don't feel like that was squeaky
that was more like a party
please
[Music]
I do
there we go that's what that must be
yeah I can
collect some trades anyway
get this
right it's here here's the
oh come on okay
you've made enough times to get there
professional
there you go
okay the timer begins here
[Music]
and apparently I haven't failed on that
one enough time to get my mask again
we should go that way
no inside
today
uh okay
let's do this play I guess
one more time
why not
it didn't die with a mouse
it makes no sense
yeah yeah you're dying with the mask
well how boring
hmm
turkey if you really pay
cortex
well I think cocoa would be the same as
pets
I mean although they are kind of evil
[Music]
you know I'm just a cute bunny
I mean cortex was probably the
experiments and fact he likes to be on
animals
you know
[Music]
all right I didn't get this ah
I'll take that
yeah I kind of have to defeat those guys
before I come pass
but
I don't have time for that
they just had power through with a mask
foreign
[Music]
well
16 seconds to spy and I just remember
that one point is blocking the clock
okay
yeah this is a clock in you can kind of
see there's something Counting
I guess it's
the size of the dress is pretty common
anymore
you like the outfit
yeah I like watch this
so I got it
[Music]
thank you
I've been working here maybe I have
heard about the reference is is a
reference to something
else if you've been talking I always
have a lot of
things uh okay I don't say I forgot to
me
oh okay okay so
according
what is your problem
I will not ask you again to bring me the
crystals
obtain the remaining five crystals crash
and bring them to me
when you told me to bring you the
crystals from the start
then he told me to bring them to the
engine for some reason but I'm bringing
them to you I'm coming coming with them
in The Binding seats all right the
bathing suits that assessment
he's super cute
thank you I
yeah you should redeem it okay
I think it would be interesting to start
the other end video because I think his
field of his evolution
but he's also crazy
anything
I mean there's that
here we go
let's make sure it's right
kids swimsuit
okay so I don't think I can
I could just connect the image
it's still nice but
it's
okay okay I went South Park
no that's nice
he he
eat fun fun now
all right I I can't wait
while I'm here
is that one changed
but that one change
is that functions it's out of ten
minutes
it would be nice if you saw me
but none of these
no the game
hehe
the Roomba oh yeah this is the
this is the inspections
we never notice in the classes and there
is the only scientist that doesn't use a
giant robot as a boss
I mean
what I'll decrease serious you mean like
I don't know what you mean he was
throughout the whole series
and released only
scientists that hasn't ever used a lot
but I mean
I can't even think of when cortex is
here
what
when cortex is using uh giant chocolate
yeah the game isn't
okay
you have to explain that things we want
me to understand
by the way I'll just completely never
snowing on there
I think the level is going to be like
this
I'll collect some fruits
and also in Crash one as I was going for
100
on the levels
that I at least thought I couldn't do
without colored gems I ignored several
of the commits I didn't look like many
of them but I didn't even know the
problem it says
and I still managed to get to 99 lives
really quickly
but in this game
yo it's a bit tricky hitting 100
.
[Music]
think about it when do you ever see
anybody use a making end of the crash
games uh I mean I haven't played all the
cash games to be honest
I don't even know it's
foreign
if I recall correctly
okay
this is jumping a bit annoying
foreign
son's name
but tell me the games
when when you can attack and knock
attack enemies it's kind of weird
foreign
so targets
that won't last
so let's
and I should keep that
and then it's
you can't give it a bonus that's about
him
and then I can go back
I don't think he's supposed to be able
to do that
okay let's see if I can get out of
things
there's four
that's four and that makes eight
and that's gonna make me two
and that's all the crates
okay
oh it looks like you did that yeah yeah
I really want to mask for that section
because
yeah I usually for empty those
maybe I want that
was there any more
yes please say that's one of the season
that's there
yeah
Hello Mickey
that's the last 20 something
that
yes
and then I need to do the best route
I'm back
wait do I have sleep
oh yeah you have to well technically you
can make it easier by going to the
restaurant and then basically dying
immediately
that's that it makes it so it can't
disappear
yeah that
that's a tricky part and then there's
this part is also tricky
yep
right
am I supposed to do okay
I need to
there you go
wait for at least but it doesn't really
spawn nevermind yeah that's probably not
at work at least finally it's a free
time
if you want of course the joint Upstream
why I want to try environment
foreign
hate
heathrows and I want the cotton Nitros
s
[Music]
it's the pathway yeah yeah it's going to
be exciting
it is nothing
you need more we need the best porn
and there's a question
okay
[Music]
[ __ ]
I don't even know how to beat this part
so um
[Applause]
[Music]
beat the humans does it count as murder
they are plenty of robots I think
but then there are like humans in
Transformers like I don't know
I'm back welcome back Ethan
assistant
basically have to do something like
nope
thank you that's how you did it
now collectible exercise
okay if this game can be so precise
about certain things
and
hey Kami frustrating different size
sometimes
like
like that
[Music]
all right
the series he had to do the death start
is because Stefan has the green
exclamation point that it lives already
knee throats
yeah because that happens if I try to do
too early
I actually don't know how he's supposed
to do that actually
this part I know just very precise it's
a different size but why not precise
100
whatever it takes
hydrate as a yeah
this winter time is over
I will hydrate
he is here to keep track of the outfit
changes
whatever and mix it up really start
update
not that I would able to use it and wait
because it's complete basic we don't
have any
and the same performance this time but
classic points
I didn't wait long enough
[Music]
see how it just put on that one
oh cool that was close but it was enough
to tricky
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
the elevation
it's so cute
[Music]
everything
and also I do have one extra large so
foreign
[Music]
this is four watch this is backwards
this is down I think
because you're not really
[Music]
okay sir but what if I want to press
like
what if I want to press jump to go up
and then press
one in specific B to go down that's what
I want but they don't give me that
option
okay you know what
[Music]
you know what
they will give me that option
because I'm playing this team
can I change my team
and how do I
I guess I just present it
but then when I press
forward it press this
backwards if this is B
and therefore when I press ah
when I press a it presses then when I
press B it presses now I see that should
be great right
a little bit more
they made it great
so I've done that now does it work
oh it does work already
and then I can switch back
when I'm done
so that's that's the key that actually
can change the controls life
foreign
now I can fly forward and back wedge and
left and right and then I press jump
decrease in height and press one back to
decreasing height this is how this is
how the control should be
this this is
right
position they don't want to give you
this option
Everything feels right crazy
all right yep
[Music]
I do like these these contract I mean
hey
[Music]
so I can have slight
memory of the old controls when I play
this but more
so
I'm not doing perfect moments but I'm
doing much better before at least
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
apparently he should have the option to
have the
on Steam that is to have to dynamically
it's a dynamically change the controls
not based on conflict exactly that was
very lazy but still like
um thanks
[Music]
it would be amazing if he was kind of
remote
[Music]
apparently the
isolated part the advice maybe of those
cake bugs are apparently also dangerous
to patch
which makes no sense
[Music]
if I'm not mistaken
it yes
[Music]
optic points
no it is this is definitely going to
help against cortex lately
okay
thank you
what are you doing mate that's also
getting here
[Music]
don't mistaken there are two jetpack
levels
that should probably do the other one
while I heard the controls it
now I just hold a to complete 11.
[Music]
and then it's okay and then I just press
up at the end of it that way I have been
surprised upon didn't die yet
to be honest me too
maybe fixing the controls for the
jetpack really made it work for me
game set to let's make my mind being say
stupid games usually problem with
console games and when I do give the
option to change the controls in games
it's like in this game
which I can provide prove here Gamepad
controls do you have to deal with
whatever they give you keyboard controls
you can change everything versus using
this is a Swedish names keyboard keys
but what happens
between
did that so that bad
so what happens press any keyboard slash
mouse key to the map that is like
they've just left on there and without
okay I press this
so it's actually reading the keys
connecting that's nice
but it doesn't allow you to remap the
GamePad controls and that's bad I think
and when they do allow you to remap the
controls they don't allow you to remap
them in different
for different gamer modes
so in this case oh you they allow you to
remember if they were allow you to like
attack this other one if they were to
allow you to remap the controls for the
GamePad
like the different keyboard they would
have up to move forward and up to fly
upwards with the jetpack as the same
command they would they don't allow you
to set those differently but at least
you could go into the settings and
change those
anyway and a friend
it takes
it of course takes more developing time
to allow for that
they have some benefits for example if
they decide that they do want to change
what the default controls are
later on
[Music]
you see so amazing
you shouldn't like eat them you make me
happy
[Music]
you only knew how
sad and depressed I was even before I
started streaming and
there are much you
and it's really changed my
enemy's secret or something honey I'm
just like
um
yeah that works
that's what we said what
yeah sometimes you bring the wrong
button
it's probably kind of like how my brain
thinks yeah I should press it back I can
think of down but the dark button is
above the jump button and so I want to
press this button
and the upper button to go up
but at the same time I was thinking
so I want to be
to everything is messing my brain at the
moment but I'm almost depressing here
when I [ __ ] the most yeah
[Music]
okay let's say that flying jet pack is
something
the biggest issue is 89 in spiral
because
since I did prefer emergency controls
a full camera controls
which is the default controls in Legends
if I push this right stick to the right
I want the camera
's physical camera to with move to right
rotating an objective the birds in agent
9 are what they don't want emerging
controls because when I push the stick
right I want the aim to go right
Dimension that's the same
thing you could say the spider remix but
with mods or maybe that would be Cooling
I I mean I've been playing spy remix
with one phone
and
but
do you have I mean is there any mods
that would kind of change the gameplay
otherwise it's just the same game
otherwise I could use some mods and just
um
do well
[Music]
I've done it
that's awesome option
yeah
and then just hold a to finish another
[Music]
and pressing up to get up on the
platform that's interesting right okay
I make like with I mean like with other
mods yeah I think yeah I get that I mean
yeah yeah
I I have like a few months I use when I
play in Spyro when I played Spider
already
there we go that's that
now I can insert back to reset the
conference and let me just save these
controls too
do I have them
which they call
[Music]
what
[Music]
there you go and these are
jet pack controls
up moves forward a moves
but they are technically not finished
unfinished
same
and then back to the
while I have this one
and oh wait what now I didn't change
back
oh it's
I need to press use layout
besides forget about that now it works
here I kind of forgot about that
anyway and Knight fight
[Music]
let's see what whatever
okay
okay so yes uh other mod I can use other
mods that modify games graphically the
mods I have been using is Pom-Pom of
course and the the um well that's
changed Zoe and other fairies inspired
two and three to look as like they do
things that fairy that's Inspire one
that's the easy outfits
and then
best two I use
but that could use other if you have
suggestions but in that case challenges
celebration headpad television and
sneaky headphones
one gone through two levels and no dice
what is this sources is it expected one
now I guess the jetpack levels are easy
it's a skill
thank you
she is she's you're so amazing
okay now now you go this is a mess
yes
no don't activate it yet
but don't think there's any
oh one of the hard lamps in yeah
and wait like this
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
and certainly they don't expect me to do
that maybe
completely do that go and see
[Music]
they can't expect me to do that
wait I was supposed to do that
oh my so I'm I'm supposed to
take the normal route
I didn't get christening
to get to know I'm supposed to go now
when I finish it all right I go back
because the Death Star didn't have the
test scene at the end but just turned
around maybe they're crazy and then go
back
yeah I see when I got that one at least
when celebration comes after
I didn't like that yet
it's almost like I should use a stick to
this one and I would usually stick for a
long time
no don't activate it yet
nuts that's not
[Music]
lips
thank you
that's nice
[Music]
[Music]
the next one
okay
I'm honest with a knife
I mean all right
okay
questions
[Music]
no
okay no no no yeah and now I'm thinking
about new chains with cookie dough that
sounds nice
I don't really cookie though though
[Music]
yeah I'd pick a milkshake
more like
ice ice cream
though
don't wait I do want that but at the
same time not I don't know
[Music]
I am on the time fashion
Sorry video messages
foreign
nine
and Nitro
and that's that milkshake bring the
voice to the eye oh wait
all right it's better than yours
can you teach me
okay some something's going on
because something is going on
is
no problem
no problem
that was very easy
now it almost made me thinking
there we go
what's inside the potency
and that's again
and I didn't have time
I would have to charge
how much do you charge for teaching
someone to teach someone how to make a
milkshake with cookie dough that brings
the boys to the yard
it sounds a bit like a very specific
you always so amazing
thank you kitten
thank you
I made my feel went away
where the cookie needs a firefly in
order to see in the darkness it's
[Music]
very very dark let's say that
and again
I'm sorry
it's
I like any path by adding all the color
chains
but I only got five out of four like
four out of five
okay well in that case
I'm just completely smell that's normal
I will get some extra knives
because I haven't lost enough hotels
already
they're missing one second huh
I like to mix it up I know I said flour
to myself
interesting
that's nice
now these four fruits
that makes no sense
I mean I guess some sense it pushes down
on your head and it got hurt
but really should just push you down
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
coins into this this root of the other
one
is sure that many Trust
[Music]
and I did that again
at least I got a checkpoint
also no I'm up from working oh
okay maybe that was the thing yeah also
about in the which you might not
when you open a checkpoint you see it's
a checkpoint as a single word
I think I need that one
at least some European supplies
because in the original game it said
first it said check and then it's a
point
to leave that animation twice
without image was faster I guess so
yeah I don't think I was supposed to do
that you see that's why I need a mask
huh
um
[Music]
what's the uh
yeah what's that
I think I just think you know what you
forget things that I
that's what's toasty
[Music]
do you need all the color games for that
passwords and they're just colored ones
they changed headphones
[Music]
so I just need one more and then I'm
done
wear this I don't know
I don't like this
um
at least you get a checkpoint from it
thanks
away I just realized I think
please
I just I just realized something
it doesn't make sense
but you can do it
you can do that
it doesn't make any sense and that's how
you solve
the those other situation with those
iron scenes
platforms you cannot stop Stefan
which you can do here team
and that's how you that's why
and here too
and this makes this level so much easier
but it doesn't make any sense because a
lot of these lasers and energy balls and
everything that you cannot touch them
that's that's
you can those you can see
and I got to go back to what happened
I'm glad he came by
the iodine's reaction you know
I'm happy you came by
that one
bye
bye
[Music]
at least the color Jam pass doesn't have
any crates
I mean it might have any
um
[Music]
I feel like my voice changes when I
speak to me
too
nitrogly seven
what is called
saying everything you can spin attack
pure energy that is not physically
possible have you tried
have you ever tried to just SWAT swap
away an engine ball flying towards him
attack and and I said that's what kind
of I'll give myself that's why that's
that I
yeah inconsistencies are annoying
[Laughter]
I haven't even delivered Christmas yet
crash cortex isn't gonna use the
crystals to contain the planet's energy
he's gonna harness the force and use it
to power the super cortex Vortex he's
built on his space station one blast in
the rail cover the entire world turning
everyone into cortex's mindless slaves
craps don't let
engine you fool she's telling him
everything
ah yes
we're back now
pardon the uh
interruption
crash bring me crystals
ring me the crystals
hmm
and you plastic
something was suspicious with cortisone
that was easier to keep him from his qi
get by controls
translates to my Jetpack and France
okay
how did I get this again
okay but not like that
that's not okay
please press that
what what
I could probably see how pressing
anything the forward makes sense in this
because it's more like a veins
then
pressing up to go forward
foreign
it's the single Crystal even though it
should be 5 25 of them
and then
you just die
like
what I am curious about
is that if I move one or not when he's
doing the finishing after being attacked
if I'm pushing that whole animation
forward
because he's for some weird cheese and
he is waiting
nothing else
phonics and adequate
to run faster how does running
yeah
all right uh I'm gonna press a because
you know what this casing in but it's
basically a good kind this game
I mean yeah yeah
suppose happened to Cortex and what
about the cortex Vortex it's still up
there
[Music]
I guess when I have to take care of that
one then
I buy my car is Visions Vision develop
support twice for Bobs to then go down
to make next crunch point
think for better and worse
and then it's basically the same Freddy
he waits because he's a villain and he
wants to gloat about his victory yet he
didn't say a single word
time to collect all the gems
okay
let's see
let's say I want to say
even though it's not the same
30
games 25 crystals
[Music]
okay
shiny gems Which gems are missing
when
colored and 11 non-colored
I'll go all the way to the bottom
I will go to the bottom of this
and go through them like this
so here's the red one which I'm I'll
start with the red one
the last remaining one
snow goal
this government finishes Secrets as well
for a special gem
so this
foreign
gems nah
and a plant pads
okay I am bad not bad
and used to be back
I'll take those I think that's not
well I'm sorry
uh more like this
I'm not a
h
[Music]
and those are interesting
[Music]
nice
well
memory
[Music]
[Music]
I did it
and I got the gym
because they mean I have to
can I get jam on this one
doesn't mean I have to go back and
[Music]
I just finished that one for now but I
need the gems
oh
maybe I got a tab on this one
apparently I can't continue that way
[Music]
tips
thank you my parent is standing there it
was too close
oh apparently there gives you lots of
damage
yeah
Restorations
this game sometimes
can be quite definitely
and that's it that's awesome
I could be wrong and the way the fruits
behaves in this game might be an exact
copy of the original game but I thought
the groups in all this game was
basically if the crank is standing on
the ground
difference on the ground
if the crane is floating
you get to the fruits immediately they
don't learn like games it goes straight
to you
but that might not have been consistent
in the original game idea
[Music]
all right
yeah it's very shiny
if these things as an extra life is not
bad for me to have
oh yeah I went
I'm not sure what you mean just finished
level for now you meant maybe you
already got the gem
he only got all the crates I don't worry
about it well I got the last Red um
well
I did it
why do I have to end up here
a celebration I don't know it feels like
the animation is shorter
or maybe the animation which only no I
don't think
and for fresh which was the old
animation Back Then
what's wrong so
I guess I have to do these parts to get
the yeah
French jump
foreign
gems now
16.
16.
[Music]
yeah I'm not going to try to give those
lives
I would die
oh that's a secret
credit
that was a big I have Beats
I see anything in stock
I don't remember
[Music]
I guess not no well I think that's it
foreign
[Music]
at least
show up
as long as it recognize me as
something else
sacred platform
um this suspicious platform maybe I
should call it that
is
so far
great claiming
the perfect timing
components
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I feel like
if you like the inside game without that
a lot
[Music]
okay do I do the best or not
I don't remember
[Music]
because it's only
22 more crates and then just like these
no needs season yeah I suspect that I
don't need to get due to the low amount
of
great Smith
[Music]
well that was in the platform
and there's like four more trades there
yeah I should probably just trying to
eat fruit yeah okay
okay just kidding
which which Coco can right
for some reason
there's nine more
oh no because you can't feel bad
of course not
am I silly
[Music]
okay I just follow along
another pass
and I was like
those three left
there you go that's all of them
[Music]
what if you intentionally skip the gem
Edition
let's say celebrating whoa
and this is the cause for celebration
I did it
I got that at a gym
18 minutes left so I probably just get
they continue during the game until I
get all the gems I think no need to
push put it and decide for another
stream
[Music]
and this one a road to
a clear hand of the appear at the end of
death so
which I've already done because I got
the bottom gem I don't have the top here
due to this
Secret
entrance
oh my
what
collection of things
[Music]
it's going to be sure that isn't yeah I
respectfully some some hidden secret
inside this
you can't just spin through it
will be fun to try to just activate the
TNT and let them explode
foreign
running around here hey I was just I
would have been Suite you would have
done that and then you would have died
unless
or anyone
a new one
a new one
[Music]
as far as foreign
Watch twice and swimsuit has been the
two options
and then I added on the way
which has been the probably the most
popular yeah
from this one
I'm not I'm not seeing that color
I mean
I've only seen the other color
Oh you mean no it's the underwear not
these other sports something
and then that's there okay
yeah I think if I take the test
I don't see the deserve this movie
but yeah that's the other instructions
[Music]
oh hello great okay I haven't really
welcome welcome
oh yeah yeah let's see
[Music]
wait why didn't
oh
so that's it
well
what happened there
yeah
how's life okay
I was obviously sister is a rate people
coming from a different streaming
because great go get it great if it's
the full name has
it's finished with his dream
so let me do a quick shout out
and this was a funny
it was a funny typo
hello from
um
he said you're a [ __ ] you said that I
didn't think he did three days
yeah yeah
yeah he triggered them both it's fine
Please block that okay
I see
I mean
it's yet probably making
me was being home okay okay well in that
case I take your word for it
he might behave in your stream
are you behaving foreign
I mean if you're if you're being if
you're in something big I don't want you
around here I mean I feel like you can't
be the kid
yeah why wouldn't I
I don't know I mean if you if
I mean if if if you are rude to my
friends
even if you're behaving nicely on my
stream I I don't I I don't like
I still don't like it
we are nice here
but now I kind of got into
but I don't like blocking people on this
TV5
so
serious
but yeah so I
hello hello
hey
so anyway
are we in there
make a decision like this
we'll see how I think it goes so so far
it goes great and uh
I'm currently finishing up a crush tip
all right
I'm currently collecting auditions
and then
it should look familiar because I
okay uh heavy
and getting have you read it before
no wait I I already do what no way
I don't remember
there was one or the other place
but you have a list of all the links
I've done
making this
tips I made a mistake
so
I waited after my first year and you
made me too okay well that's why I kind
of my memory is so bad but okay in that
case both have something
hello
and I saw your plane crash
the remake of course for some reason
twitch doesn't have the remix of Crash
separate but it does have the
remix for spiral separate
and now crash ID team
like mostly
there are quite a few annoyances with
crash which
but uh
and my
boy of doing this is you complain about
it but
what else did playing I still enjoying
I guess other people swear and stuff so
I usually that's why
so this is my way of coping with it
yeah
are you coming yeah
[Music]
I was nice to see if I kidding bye
it's a lot of a lot of activity now
so
yeah so yeah I'm finishing up question
now I will basically go
for as long as I need
yes and what's going to normally end the
stream when I reach
full full o'clock yeah
oh thank you for subscription
I'm kind of you
yeah I did I didn't even celebration and
I was a celebration for a new suspicion
did you get the first batch or did it
oh there's no Christmas so this is the
original level and this team
remember I can see myself without my
nothing I mean every everyone
a lot of people might not be great at
streaming at the start
I do it because I I decided to do it
because I didn't want to play video
games but I I also been talking to
people like wanted to show people
like
I feel like like playing video games and
I have not spent too much time playing
these games
is that all I decided that
Rush
foreign
so I decided that
can I explain I need to get everything
in order when I'm thinking
so I have been playing very little video
game in recent times because I've been
so busy doing a lot of other stuff
but I wanted to play more video games
because it is entertaining
and then and
oh that happened
so I wanted to play more mini game to
relax
I don't know some excuse might not be
too relaxing
we get my mind off other stuff and then
what I also talked about with other
people
but it's it's fun
seeing friends play
and so I decided why not also stream it
so my friends can watch while I play
you
so that's basically why I decided to
touch things
oh scary scary
okay
yes it's a Cool vibe oh thank you that
means a lot of me
come yesterday
I'm just
saying
and I'm of course open for ideas too
what to change
but I will mostly continue to do what I
think
and yeah
and reading comments and and
playing at the same time It's Tricky but
that's part of the fun
I guess you might cannot just walk down
here and it looks like it but pick up
the gym first and then I will see if I
can
I don't think I can
thank you
I mean there's nowhere to go though so
nowhere to go though so there's no
reason to go there
you go on the snow
this is the remastered yes oh hello
[Music]
and the Remake came out
2017 Maybe

19th century the name
I actually make sure it says anything
that's a nickname
in my Thirty marching back into it okay
so
is this just a
it doesn't feel tricky though
it's a bit trickier than the other level
of this scene
but badly
but I think that'll be constantly run
this one last
I mean it is drinking because I died
twice compared to the other one I
couldn't series let's run through twice
without even dying once
it's funny
but before you do all this different
oh yeah yeah
sorry about that
I started tomorrow morning goodbye
kitten yes we'll talk maybe later or
tomorrow
night for you to show up twice or three
times I don't remember
okay back and back to what the experts
it's funny before you do all these super
sketch to do one simple recording and
now look at you if you came a long way
from
yeah I think
yeah yeah I've been
yeah I've been very scared of
doing recordings uh
[Music]
for many many reasons why I've been
get off
doing
recordings like
for people to hear my voice
so even before I
did my first recordings I did ask this
on my
because it's not only that and months
letting people hear my voice
it's it's the also the a bell is been
speaking
so my voice was kinda
I already started following me I didn't
want it oh it's a Time mate
use me
okay I could almost do that with hockey
I remember your first recording I said
yes
yeah that was when I was very very
but now I sound like
a lot
okay
but I don't mind sounding a chipmunks
that sounds like a cutesy
wait a minute
I am missing too oh
definitely was it to me first I'm
forgetting about
and I still
haven't done
it yes I wanted to voice for fun fun oh
that was tasty what a waste of time
I need to count
need to create
[Music]
we do need to create and another 2 to 16
and safety
seven one day whatever I feel like it I
don't think I should do sunscreen though
and do the uh
record The Voice lines for quantum
or my pumpkin not
I can do this anyway back
do you think it's no problem oops big
problem
okay I need to delete that
out picking up this one
okay
this could be bad
no no
I do this
[Music]
thank you
yeah I would not be happy to do that
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
of course
and if you ever do you can always
message me
on Discord or something alright so for
everyone here if you enjoy my playing
I do actually have a Discord
and simple nice little
pop paths and Savage
or whatever one isn't forced tea but can
choose which animal he wants to be
and I I think you uh would be I
giraffe I haven't said that to me
is that how you say it in English
giraffe
giraffe
oh
I need this jump
I'm gonna try see okay
since it would be just
let's see
it's in Swedish if you're curious it is
and says to me and he serves something
to me
easy
so
all right that's that's one of those two
lights
okay do you have so much pain
I think yeah
yeah I do like the one you boxed on your
channel it's very cute
and you're writing
yeah you yourself are that you're off
so yeah unlike me who I I am I'm a bun
oh yeah
thank you
that's fine
oh
but you can't be so cute
thank you the I made
a commissioned
I've said it a few times I should
remember that
Violet Echoes and in Spanish foreign
along with some reference images and
that's and that's what I got and I'm
happy with it
foreign
you've been traveling with having a
common in a word in your name
you will probably hear bunny a lot on
this channel by the way
yeah yeah
thank you
I wanted the adorable
unless I meant to no I wouldn't be able
to keep over there
of weight but activating that we get to
some
secrets
that will be in even
oh yeah it's like when people are
talking about the Pom-Pom pom-poms
but we have Pom-Pom in that case
because it varies
which of course
it comes from the word Pom-Pom
and Bonbon comes from bunny
and has no relation to Chinese sweets
my appointments
[Music]
oh a nice outfit
okay
I have one but the deletions
but I'm not the Bonbon I miss the bun
and I guess bunnies are delicious too
all right
we could calm down this time
can I
just ignore these fruits I'm I'm wasting
more time trying to get the fruits
other bad news is the treats
[Music]
oh this looks scary
[Music]
I'll wait a minute
why would I want to go back I don't know
if it's okay
I think that's just a tricked me
yeah now you have the speed Grandpa uh
actually I think
fat
okay in case I had to press
done so many buttons
and I want to please say
[Music]
oh I can't even put a properly like
stone or something there
this is back my red gem was yes
with
[Music]
I'd like to try some bonbons
[Applause]
or maybe
[Music]
I had some kind of French thing
right one I'm gonna go to me get back to
the game he must be very late for you
thank you so much for today
um
ham and I see
bye bye
[Music]
yeah it's chocolate covered oh let's see
what's there what's on the inside
so good
I can imagine
chocolate depending on how dark
chocolate is
foreign
it's random oh interesting
it's more of a broad term for about a
little chocolate party ah I see
it's a kind of like yeah
chocolate bars there's plenty of those
that have additional scenes
yeah
I was I was thinking about the name Nike
extracted by itself would be a lot of
interested things
on the first one no that's
foreign
so I have done some
done some research
and let's see
keep forgetting that she did that
and I have an idea of how I should do
that though
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
all the crates
[Music]
whoa celebration
over time I need to go
it would be nice to just finish the game
but maybe the remainder of the game
actually will take too long so
maybe plus seven starting with entire
thing so the idea
I have
is that I do one yeah I got everything
here I mean it's not too much but I do
feel like the remaining crystals gem
cement might take a lot of effort so my
idea is that I insert an extra screen on
Wednesday
instead
there you go that's animation
bye
yeah that's it
I think that sounds like a cute idea
personally
[Music]
if people don't mind
and what time should I start that's a
good question though
same time as Saturday Sunday maybe
much make you think that last time will
take that long
because I'm tired
that's why
online yeah I'm just an extra stream on
Wednesday
not that problem right
okay
[Music]
but I did consider one thing while I
basically have a lot of people here it's
still not getting extra stream exactly
but what I am thinking
is that since my art streams has been
more successful on Saturday Sunday I
mean I've only done it once but it seems
it seems more fitting for Saturday
Sunday I could be wrong but
so I considered putting the Arts on
Saturday Sunday
I still do it on this Monday and Tuesday
then I do the extra crash stream on
Wednesday
Thursday Friday I finish up Spire Legend
Aspire three and then I do what art I
can on Saturday Sunday
because art is fun because it's a new
thing I've started doing
so and then from there on there on I'll
do the crest three
Monday Tuesday
more inspires Thursday Friday which I
probably should move earlier because
[Music]
someone is tired when I do those streams
and then they are Saturday Sunday from
there I think that might be a good idea
I am open for opinions
feel free to
keep if you have an immediate opinions
right now if you feel free to write them
[Music]
otherwise you can always join the
Discord stream and yeah
make comments that you
the mobile Friday ideas and all that
foreign
I have watched before
EB
arazzi or something
I haven't gotten to learn and now
listening much but he's an Easter man
so why don't we say hello
because he's nice
all right already I should check my skin
man my great message to this one if you
subscribe if you're not subscribed you
can always pay 100 carrot coins to
unlock this one and then you just post
three of those
[Music]
anymore
[Music]
can I have the new one
the new and improved but yeah that's
that's the plan art tomorrow more emotes
feel free to come come and give ideas
for new emails Tuesday More arts I don't
know what more morning about
foreign
if I feel like it I still still trying
to figure out the community drawing
which probably should be satisfiling in
that case
[Music]
so
I'll try to do the community drawing on
Saturday we'll need to discuss how to
everything should look in it but thank
you everyone for coming
and staying for some of so long on the
Stream
taking your time being here I it did
mean so much to me it makes me so happy
