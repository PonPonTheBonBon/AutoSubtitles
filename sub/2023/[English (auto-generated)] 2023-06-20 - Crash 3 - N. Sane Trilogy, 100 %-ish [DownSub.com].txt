hello everyone welcome
to another stream
I have so far
let's switch to Coco let's add a
character
I have so far completed the cortex
defeated cortex I have started doing the
time trials
but I need the 25 of them to unlock the
extra levels
and then after I get all 25 five turns
I will do texture levels
or maybe I should call it yeah let me
try it first and then
now I do need to do the extra levels but
I miss the clock
I can no that's this option uh
so yes I will do the extra levels first
and then I will go through
on it
foreign
there's no quick restart option and they
didn't even add it to crash for it
[Music]
crash 4 has a restart option but it's
setting up quick
just like how
um
use me
anyway so just like how all the fruits
disappear
when you start to take down how
your mask disappears and don't happen on
this race anyway
and other things like that
I really wish all the cars disappeared I
mean not police cars but the race cars
she can't call this my surprise and
because I'm not raising them anymore I'm
only raising the time and they're more
like oh but you could argue it's part of
the challenge
[Music]
but
there's a way around that
[Music]
which is snow and tedious and he
as I usually think if there's a way to
do something
and it's slow and tedious they should
make it
an option to do it without it being slow
and tedious
and I for example in the
that was that was a great example in the
legend of spire 3. where they have this
regenerating crystals that gives you
health
and and Manas they call it
and because they are regenerating you
can stand around some of them and just
recollecting them over and over to max
out your health matter
so
these crystals
in this same spot without any enemies
they give you so little Health they have
to tediously wait what you didn't
respond
it's now it's time the teeth have to
make for them to respond and then
collect them again and doing that
overnight
and because that's the tedious thing to
do they should touch them yesterday
that's why you see my argument
if you defeat all the enemies in the
area the crystals should basically give
people healthy immediately
so I thought candy he say okay
so now if it's so basically if you do
the time share on a race like this what
you can do is not basically just dance
then let's start with the race
[Music]
maybe you need to start at least to
actually get there
fastest time
because what we can do is actually
[Music]
yes if he move
[Music]
D okay yeah I don't know okay if you
need to start first
[Music]
in that case is different oh I missed it
[Music]
if I can't even win the race I'm just
not getting a good time
but maybe at least it's like the slowest
time
that's good even though I didn't win
which
doesn't make sense
to be honest because you clearly have to
be quicker than this to where
actually get a crystal so by the blue
time isn't the blue time the sapphire
time isn't Crystal and then they're
going to even go quicker to get the
girls and that's kind of interesting
so just by we need to so the separate
time I know you could have figured that
I played first some time around but I
mean
you are guaranteed and honestly
something different going on that I'm
missing
but
to even do the temperature I first have
to win the race and by first time doing
race the proves that you are good enough
to win the race which means you are good
enough to get together
internet
I'm always thinking this I'm usually
thinking this
but that's just my thing
[Music]
what
let's do that
and again that's the prank
five seconds
yes very quickly
all right oh I'm not gonna do that
all right
we can't see you can walk outside lemon
all right
London on the wrong side of it
yep I'm done no
foreign
[Music]
that's two levels so far that's
15 levels in total with uh
with times because I only literally need
the
Blue Sapphire things
I don't need to go
[Music]
let's move over to the next group of
lemons and yeah
for the platform
all right are we doing time test now and
like I didn't do it last time yeah
because I needed the detention to get
the extra levels
I'm not going I'm not going to go for
like a lot in a Time
foreign
okay
so there is
let's see how much time I can save on
this
okay
okay so I can't save some time on that
whoops how did I do that
oh
oh no
it's not
enough changes
there you go that's what that would have
been that that was the high
oops I should I should have made a long
jump
I don't remember which never cost me
some trouble getting today
11 of course I think that
she doesn't really cannot decide
hey hello I'm happy to see you here
how are you doing today
I am doing fine let's see
foreign
safely
[Music]
hello age I'm doing time Trends I mean I
think you missed the whole first stream
of the game where I defeated the cortex
within three hours
so that was something it is
all right all right
my opinion probably
take it finally
okay
that was close
okay bye
and oh I can't do that oh my
God it's not scary
no aggressive
don't see always that's really short
yeah I'm actually surprised how quickly
I could I think it's difference of the
how I've been it too
deep I complete now I did I don't think
I completed crash one in the first
stream
I actually don't remember
didn't that complete crash one stream I
did not completely one stream but crash
two allows you to actually collect a lot
more gems during
the first
[Music]
a lot of people argue that crash three
what's too easy
so what they did was that they made the
European version Hunter and then you did
the Remake based on the North American
release anyway so
[Music]
there's one behind me
uh I don't need another position after
this
uh why is it so far away
[Music]
but I'll take it
what time is that
girl looks nice hey
do you have a parent's license to drive
that plane did he drive planes
wait it's an oh another key I gotta
spell my name
pun
yeah I don't think
I don't think they care about licenses
when you're gonna attacking the enemy
[Music]
good
it's keep pain
will be lost no I'm not
[ __ ]
nothing
[Music]
and I align myself
see ah nope
such a waste of time
[Music]
and Thompson
whoopsy
okay I'll just
do you go faster by going up very Ram
that simply something out
Pepsi
oh the what level is a character from
they were from they are not only fun
exciting
they are fun
I
fun
I still find it weird
but I still decided that she should wear
regular outfits while being in what you
see he's getting a close sweat
hey excuse me
foreign
oh my gosh
oops
whatever can we make when
I cannot see that
was a bit silly
can I shoot
uh wasting more time trying to Pizza
oh wow
how am I supposed to
do that
is this something I'm
just standing here
we
are gonna be here for a while
you can't
thanks very confident
now but yeah
what's with this bird
are the bird is from there what thank
you
range
it doesn't damage shouldn't be easier
it's time to turn
okay hurry hurry hurry hurry
but don't waste too much the best candy
that would be really
oh
not miss that one
another
yeah
and hopefully
burn moves
I don't get teleports
rather clearly I can just run straight
through the box and get rid of bird
sometimes the bird affects
okay that way
and straight to go
let's go and it's gone welcome
strange I had such trouble at the start
of the the thing and then I just and
then I went through everything without
energy
well that was wrong
I mean took a few tries but
I guess I had to get used to the water
controls again
I only played it yesterday so
huge difference
often have
I really did though and basically
without him
my voice
okay let's see
okay and Let's ignore that
taking more time to think to pick them
up and I get from them
I feel like a kid I can't do that
and the clock should stop for this
segment
[Music]
no
what happened that's why I want to
happen
[Music]
there you go
oh man I guess I'm not allowed to see
that
okay
and then I missed okay
made about something
[Laughter]
that was quite the wrong
okay one more
nice
that from
and then and then that is run to your
day and not stop
[Music]
oh I wasn't
I wasn't okay
oh oh my
[Music]
God
can I jump oh no
[Music]
Maybe
quick
ly
I didn't need to see that but
not much you don't stand on me
yeah I can jump over those
if I don't do that
okay maybe I can't jump over those I've
just had too much suitcase luck
oh this one enemy
this one in because it's too much
trouble okay let's see
[Music]
that's what I wanted
I did it
that's all it counts actually
and now
okay now
oh come on why is it the next time
oh you were doing this when so when
yeah
it went somewhere there
yeah there you go
I learned it yeah
give me a give a short amount of here
right
[Music]
[Music]
Okay so
and then headphones
[Music]
second hand the game
welcome doctor
and tonium
have you tried going faster well I don't
think going faster is my problem at the
moment it's the um
not a dying that is my problem
that was close
by Mr sweet
yeah actually it's not happy
memory is the three so keep okay
but
yeah
I must pick up that
maybe I could have gone there
he's about to risk it I shouldn't agree
see you and have died if you go fast I
mean that is technically too
that reaction
can we wait sometimes
I need a quick reaction here
still blame it
the game for not having as many
what
[Music]
oh if I just didn't have to spin that
thing if I could slide
that's one of the enemies you can't
slide and it really annoys me
because spinning stops me from running
sniping gives me I didn't boost like
that
oh my if you look at this time that's
like
five seconds quicker last time
okay not messing up this time
it's more of a game myself yeah good
good
one if you can't slide quicker you're
not going to be crowd huh
come on you instead of hits really I
wasn't really paying attention to it but
that's what I created
hey
they should stop the timer doing the
well
yeah I mentioned that before
really
is going to be like this
[Music]
because everyone has to wait for that
anyways I mean
you can accurate more accurate time of
active thing
oh I hate drinks I'm in
I'm taking care of that now
[Music]
thank you for the hydrates
I don't exactly now which which timing
is good on that one
that's it if I don't have to spin that
one I'll get through maybe this is a
better way of doing like jumping over it
or something
I am using a place in control not my
favorite probably I really don't like
the d-pad on it it's a position three
controller specifically
I do like the d-pad on the Xbox One
controller but it instead has an issue
with the keyboard and its battery
doesn't work so
options
okay now
foreign
[Music]
we can have with that
went very well for you thank you
I have
aside from the previous videos
yes when bring it
I was risking it there with the
platforms again but
I managed to get back
and then went properly
I should have a music
that was the one yes
this one should be fine
tomb waiter I wonder if that's a
reference to anything
where's Benny
penny
I'm playing Tomb Raider
wait which timing is he
all right no ways
okay I see
foreign
what's wrong with the chumps
I mean I might think it don't
I'll take it
I should ever see maybe yes three
seconds let's take longer than two
seconds
[Music]
and these enemies
there you go whoa
I am not very good I thought that was
pretty good
I was I thought that was pretty quick I
did some clever things and I beg you
know
apparently it's not what's good
the spinning attack and the boxes in
water are the best friends here
yeah yeah that is true that is true I
could probably have done that I should
probably have done that that's probably
worth gold
maybe more of that
I hate the same thing that ever is the
sign with that in mind
I mean yeah obviously they for the for
the time times to the end but I mean
they could have passed the time I just
subtracted that time from the girls that
SpongeBob give it to you
it's annoying that you can't see both at
the same time
well I went
seven like four seconds quickly
if the time is stopped at that time the
level will have higher requirements yeah
I mean
you need to go you need to go to get the
final again
all right well let's do that actually
didn't know for the final game
I forgot about the finance game but the
final game is more than 100
and the title says 100 each not actually
100
you have to be clear about that
more
[ __ ]
[Music]
I can see
I can't save time by jumping around them
but it's really nice time
nope apparently
[Music]
what's up
that was something like
I want to think
I don't have to start taking those but
at least three seconds
not much time same but not the time's
sake
where is it is the time it passes during
this segment you get I'm so that's more
reflective over the time he actually
spent on 11.
foreign
[Music]
okay another idea whatever you put it
every time
poor person that has letters in the name
that are very late in the alphabet
and that you can't press the keys on the
keyboard that's just such an oversight
and press p and it immediately Scrolls
the p and moves over to the next letter
and then press o is across the O and
there's the next letter
but then when I press n it just grows
the end
and it just stays there and then I press
enter something to confirm
they should put me on the design team
and also remember what the last name in
inserted was
making a decent type name on PC and also
you don't have to retype it every time
I'm not surprised that no developers
latest in this game sort of that idea
or even if it did so let's think of that
idea why wasn't anything that's a tricky
question
[Music]
some decisions confused me
[Music]
anyway
I'm doing
oh wow that was close I'm doing his face
very on the
previous one
well okay
what happened
[Music]
nice
whoa
I did it
don't
everyone running over the month second
um did it
[Music]
and very soon I'm going to do an extra
level
hopefully Arabian
and kitten can show up until then
they have some time left
[Music]
yep
yeah it was it a perfect run but it was
a good enough I'm gonna have a girls
and I don't need these skills
especially gem lies at the end of death
I wrote no it doesn't I've only picked
it up it doesn't exist anymore
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
heads hot head shot
I meant to be saying okay I should check
no there was no time I don't know
did I really jump on the Fire
okay so enjoy the regular double jump
doesn't seem to do it
at least
I missed
but I've
I was behind
really
I have such a short range
what happened with my slides
oh
I'm messing up now
1990
[Music]
where did the women here get perfume
that can come fast
when
you can
have you tried to set fire to park
perfume
I didn't think it was perfume that comes
that's an interesting thought though
so close to avoiding that
I should have gone all the way
I wonder if I can take this shortcut now
[Music]
then I would have the chicken mask have
it I'm gonna lose one
another one
is it going to rush through that
annoying conceit
it was a nice three second box there
obviously it would probably take me more
than three seconds trying to collect it
but
nice
thank you
[Music]
is this leg I can keep track of the
levels yeah okay
so this one can be a bit tricky
I need a map where
where are we
planes located
so that's one right to the right here
and then they get it okay let's get
right here for that then
go
oh it's far away now
wow
maybe you can't wait
I need a better fan
I don't know which onion
yeah I need to Route out this Bay
because that's clean that's not the way
there's one girl Missy yeah I know
aren't too too actually
all right
yeah it doesn't know how she found this
out
foreign
they look like German airplanes to me
but I could be wrong
I wouldn't be surprised if they made
some German airplanes because since they
are the enemy airplanes
developed in the United States
the game example that is and of course
in Germany is the enemy
okay
not saying that that is the case
but that could be the case
then
it's not a too exciting 11-65 I guess
let's go
what have we got
I couldn't get married
just crates getting in the way
not giving me anytime soon
here we go
oh
come on
I don't want to mess with that one
you know and if you need it I jumped
away
I read that
was nice happy dance City puts you must
yeah that's the the original in the
devil they are
and then they kept them for the year
okay that was all 25 levels so
very very very cute
so
that was very much
and my initials
when they were playing I can't reveal
what my initials are well the first one
is e
H yeah
people having user names that's not a
thing is it
that's cool that's not me I'm pun
one got to go eat
when I went back from their heads
25 relics that means extra levels whoa
it's been one hour so
[Music]
so if people are not here an hour after
the starting time yeah
when
shame for them missing there
extra lemons
so I have no extra levels
five extra levels
you need 25 time relics to unlock the
five extra levels
Canada time to run I'll collect the
crates first
because otherwise I have to if I if I
accidentally die I have to restart the
whole level
S I don't really need to do 10 turns but
I guess I'll do that last because if we
don't in every time child to get a loss
gem even though I don't think it counts
towards 100 anyway
maybe it does
[Music]
now wait don't get over
my problem again
I don't remember
hi hello everyone perfect timing I just
started the first extra level but just
completed all the 25 time trends
so this is this is one of the Excellence
it's a shame it doesn't say it here yes
the name of the lemon I think in the
original PlayStation one they actually
told you the 11 number
it is level 26 out of 25.
I never made it here in the peace I had
no idea what's going to happen here well
this is going to be a surprise for you
we have five extra levels
two hidden levels and one DLC levels is
eight more levels for me to do
this one
with this level nine
this is going to be interesting today
at last
especially that part do you think you
get some
time boxes there
whoa that was close
nice 10 points
we get so many fruits
[Music]
whoa these ramps are very close together
it
oop I missed one
get quite the Boost across the ramp
going so slowly
oops
but nicer theater
of course the intense wants to miss the
Tokyo benefits insane trilogy
foreign
yeah you should take that and move all
the way here first take out that and
then do it in heaven
sadly the clock when she picked up here
see the time plan that one disappears if
you move too far away from it
by the way that's an option
you think I've ever seen yep 100
right
not bad money
and then of lemon whoa
would you be happy to lose an expensive
jet ski
to an explosion
when a radio control by another person
driving into the bomb
[Music]
we kind of have that it was only the
Husky that was lost
yes exact point
so this is an original level
an extra lemon
this is an extra level
this is the racing you can see here
first and this is an actor level
while this
as well as this
I just alternative and Princess to
existing lemons
I just discovered the secret route
foreign
to collect it
well oh wow the fruit bazooka has longer
each and then remember maybe it has
longer range in the remake
but sometimes it feels like it doesn't
have the revenge batteries
and then I end up up here which is
annoying
[Music]
I don't know they didn't correct that
correct it I mean I entered down here I
understand kind of like oh yeah but you
went into the regular girl
or something but but still
you know for the sake of convenience
Mark where the room this morning
[Music]
yeah I can just time it up okay I can't
do the touch on this wait the whole box
is coming
them up anyway
I just focus on winning
first
wait how can I how are the lights so
dark
shouldn't I be able to see them in the
distance
is that because I'm drawing Journey on
the graphic settings
and computers dragons to run the game
as which is my my voice sounds weird
all right
yeah the UFOs don't need to use the Rams
to get over police
[Music]
being a band-based vehicle like this I
kind of need it
I have set the game to the lowest
gravity
[Music]
we're surface isn't Batman
ah
why can't I mask if the mask has the
ability to will crash up from bottomless
bits like this
and why why not do that on regular
levels
[Music]
okay Vegas too
[Music]
much in real life
but but
oh it's not nitrate in Need for Speed
there you go I want to be close
I know a clock and you have these
[Music]
thank you because it's not Crystal
I had to I do have access to the time
what
wait what why did why I didn't control
it when it comes
[Music]
okay
yeah that's a great outfit
some motorcycling right
[Music]
feeling Cool Breeze
in the ears
thank you as I was thinking that one
I am silly
and scarcity
thanks
but if I don't need Instagram
[Music]
I didn't happen
[Music]
yeah can I have to memorize the track to
me
no since I can't see it fully
oh
I think
[Music]
hopefully I can at least get enough time
[Music]
can be right back
thank you
have fun
[Music]
give me guns I know it was a great time
but
foreign
nothing
it wasn't a great time
not demon Sapphire
how terrible am I at this
tip if the if I was moving I probably
needs a card yeah but they don't always
move up because they so
and indeed
aren't the problem all right
[Music]
well excuse me
like yeah
that one moves up because there's a car
but
I mean maybe it's not always be possible
to see them next one
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
cars so far
you can see if that changes
right
I don't know if you have to use first
one to do to tackle me on the thing
don't
and then
I got first place
they get the time too I got time
man enough getting out early
but maybe that's tasking too much
well well
I didn't mean to sound like that
whoa
I did it
I just did it
[Music]
go ahead do it again
for you
a celebration
so
this one you have to use this to get the
Gem Box Thing box gem
it's a time to get all the
oh oh it's not heavy one
oh you want like that okay
excuse me
yeah how do you like that
I want to do the Hydra change the time
twist today I want to see something and
then I mean it's fine you can use it
whenever you want
[Music]
and why do you call the panties then
when it was originally called The Warp
room
I cannot do this
as far as I know you can't use the
Bazooka um
excuse me wise
yeah
with panties on those
I actually destroy all of these
well this game is based on time Journey
it is which I mentioned several times in
last stream
the first first game doesn't have any
form of
systems to Traverse I mean except
working on foot
the second game is using teleportation
to move to different locations on the
planet that's what I know
that's weird and the third game
using
time travel and
adaptation is kind of built into the
same system
leave them different times
in different parts of the planet in
different times
and page
wait a minute
it cannot it canonically
um
F4 crash game he is using
a dimension popping if you can see that
but yeah moving to the dimensions
[Music]
as well as suit time and then
space
maybe maybe it's just that different
dimensions are located in different
times more than you're actually moving
into two different times
but it gives the effect of learning
through time as well
my question Still Remains What should
the fifth crash game be following the
trend of
this uh
yeah expanding the well
excuse me
is it more
I don't know
yes there's more
oh this is
because that came
it's not because I have two
yeah all right collected them and Henry
boxes
oh there was okay I was wrong
but good thing okay
now I don't think there are small boxes
this is a start
alternative version of crashing copper
means we do you have
Nina
um wait Tana is different by the way
unless you mean
no no that would be Nina
thank you
the Tina is Nina imagine yeah but like
alternative versions that's just
the characters from the different
dimensions they combine that into one
if they didn't have authority version of
Turner
in that game
in that case I could see that as an
option
but they already done that they must do
something new
[Music]
what really is the next step after
dimensions
this level is empty I wonder why
oh look
at this where does this come from
checkpoint nice
that I can save all that projects I mean
constant why do I have to press this
like button end of the attack button to
shoot the pursue here I mean at least at
least a lot of pressing both because one
of the button doesn't seem to do
anything
[Music]
you can also why does those have to not
upside down
why can't you get oh yeah you can we
just had
and you can I come
and yeah
and I believe crash and Coke you have
infinite Pockets I mean how and to keep
it all the best you can about it yeah
like up to 99 Foods how did it again
convert food to see
knives anyway
maybe they eat them
and then they put like four up to four
Netflix first things at once
no maybe it makes the maximum three
things
I don't need these instructions
I'll do it my way
[Music]
I think I'm fine oh there's another one
wait a minute
[Music]
so yeah
[Music]
perfect
50 trips thanking boxes
and two legs
honey you're breaking news
I am doing
see I am evil in French
you can't stop me I will use the Pacific
in the bonus level
haha
hey hey
I haven't actually made the
evil pumpkin as a cacti
I have a
I have actually made yes Blackberry red
red markings
and other details
[Music]
this color scheme not certainly based on
Shadow the Hedgehog
he will park okay that would be fun to
see yeah and I added it to the wheel the
win I always been when I get subscribers
and
okay look
I'll pick up the chain and I won't even
touch that one
Evil Pumpkin strikes again
breaking news
yeah so if evil comes up on the wheel
I've been turning the Evil Pumpkin for a
second of time
and I I don't know it should basically a
different personality and after it
happens the first time I must also want
to add it as a redeem good
[Music]
an expensive redeem I guess
because I say
is it
all right it's this button press 16
[Music]
.
oh
I missed
that was the shoot button
that wasn't what I wanted
to do that maybe I should shouldn't spin
on that one
this is new for me yeah
three
I mean see if there's alternative
entrances we shouldn't
that's uh after this one I should do the
diner lemon
you like that one because it's a diamond
[Applause]
okay one spin on that one
[Music]
and I should probably not spend on that
one or anything
it has to be safe
[Music]
okay or that's fun
thank you
mate
uh
oh come on
come on
this Scene It seems a bit unfair the
plane scientists is too slow yeah yeah
the turning on this playing so often
I mean
everyone has awful training
and no one's turning off for me
so all I need
the last thing I want to add to the win
is uh
some kind of food thing
and
something that can be prepared quickly
and last for a long time
before it's prepared
it's so close so close
I have it this time I have it
again
okay I'm back
and now hey I'm starting an email
a new extra level
sorry for the food thing in spicy it
can't be anything I'm saying
something I can buy in advance and store
that's also all available for me to buy
requirement see
I'm actually not nothing I
15 come see him
this is a pure restriction thing
the wrong button
[Music]
so yeah
and then I feel comfortable like
introducing the
wheel
I will retract with the
retroactively
do the previous subscriptions
so don't hesitate on the subscriptions
ahead of time because they will count
starts to win
there yeah
thank you perfect
I should go to the 911
The Hidden 11.
yay
cheer
[Music]
foreign
which one is it
in one of
someone here
yes this one it's just pictures
different
let's go
yeah you need a yellow gem to get to the
super secret lemon
let's pick up some nice tonight
and best to not tell a mask
foreign
[Music]
so you never know
this camera gem part of the earning I
call again
I mean it's hard to because I discovered
I mean I actually using it it is hard to
use a jump fast and before collecting a
collagen
you know
yeah yeah that's it I miss that
that's the fun fun
that weird fish must have DNA Cottages
to make fresh
what would be fun
is because the fish is obviously based
on trash
it's amazing
would be if they made a lot of
challenges based on cocoa and then just
swap out the fish depending on the good
babies
or something
that could be about I just don't know
how to modest thing
because they are using um
an internal engine
in-house ending
very bad place
[Music]
anyway
I just walked into it
um
but cortex create cocoa what kind of
Bitcoins
I mean
assuming these characters are just
regular animals that has been modified
to become human-like
basically what cortex is trying to do is
create inquiries
and he has succeeded
then presumably
it created the cocoa and crash
and they came from the same
then they are siblings remember me
because I don't really know how the hell
in there
isn't that the howdy but I don't think
they actually go into the details of how
they become like
if they became a supermarket
due to crash or if they always were out
to the market or anthropomorphic and was
like
okay it has a crash before and
mm coordinates
and it is
created by Cortex or at one hand was
kidnapped by Cortex to be brainwashed or
something which was really awful being
like
and feral animals that have been turned
more humanized now that it has three
sense
the berry
and then they broke out and
middle life anyway
until the secret level
s
and you know I'm at this level
oh
where's my baby has never heard of this
yeah attack this smoke never given me
this one shouldn't have any creams it
should just have a time to get dude
maybe it has a gem at the end
I don't remember
and here is
a checkpoint if you don't do it on time
but as far as I know there's nothing
else enough time to see
and I don't feel like going back to 11
yesterday the time
right away
oh
what
and I forgot today all right thank you
hey
existed
he's quite 11 isn't it
it's uh
it's so strange how to get to this level
too
they don't really make it obvious how
you get to it
but at the other day
did I make this one
is much more obvious
[Music]
yeah
exactly I need to work for a few steps
yeah there was a diamond at the end
let's go to the other secret level the
less secret now this this one is super
secret the other one is just Secret
but I think this one comes before but
for another day I think this was was the
original 1131
yeah I guess you could describe that
the other secret level you might have
seen played or something because that
one is much easier to get to
and more obvious
that's that one and the girls ones
foreign
yes
this one also has a super secret melon
this one has this uh Secret
not super secret
they had the one request you to have the
yellow gem and then
go on to an enemy which you normally
wouldn't you wouldn't normally attack
the enemy
[Music]
so I should have picked up the time to
try this to make sure that I don't
I don't need it
all right fine without me
but yeah it should be over here not not
here
yeah let's yeah bye so it should be over
here they have added this part in this
game to make it more obvious but here's
the sign the very weird sign
and
we
foreign
I mean
well they they wrote her hot Cocos I
mean how are you supposed to be
yeah this is
not a secret level by the secret level
some people might just find the uh
that alien scientists be a weird sign
but it's a special sign
oops
she just wanted to text a little slime
anymore
[Music]
design looks a lot more open than ours
yeah this one has this volcano and you
can scramble really around it
this is like a ring around the volcano
you travel in it's quite a neat now
this ritual game they had a water big
very colorful
I like it like it was an oil spill or
something I don't know
I'm not sure what they didn't apply yeah
it's a little bit too hard to apply I
think
I would argue
this is checkpoint
now you should you kind of want to
collect it
as much as you wanted before you pick it
up but there's one thing everyone and
there's a another shaking
this year
there's one additional thing I want to
do and it's all the way over there
because that is
green works with exclamation point on
um
or nitrous if you want
so getting
but there's the checkpoint Ash
just about to connect some more
a more easy one although I should
probably paint me
like now these these one here are very
easy because
they're not more
tricks yeah that's it thanks
nothing able to avoid anymore
okay how does this one I should just do
a long jump but I can do that
no problem
no problem Famous Last ways
[Music]
yep I wasn't supposed to do that
those are some giant bombs
yeah
yeah
did this pick up some more
that I I'm from here
expect points
after
taking out the green exclamation point
again
I don't have to redo all this
because there's another checkpoint there
so
that was a bit scary
come on yeah
what
[Music]
[Music]
there you go whoa I did
uh-huh
Dark theme
and sneaking on the islands
around these bombs
accidents happen yeah enough
happens
okay
here we go but I
managed to hit now I think take it out
good
oh
it's a treat underwater
you'll just pick up some more please
whoa that was dangerous
what can I do that
and then I will just have to pick up
these two I should pick up the
checkpoint
and you have this progress
go
and then try for this jump because I
know what I did wrong
70. I don't understand
okay apparently that's not what I'm
supposed to do
um
um
okay I'll try something else
about this
yeah
now it's like the perfect place
you don't like to go at an angle
that yeah there you go that's how it's
supposed to be
hey maybe in here they're just right
about the speed
yeah I was thinking about
um maybe I was going to snow but I'm not
really sure
I'm gonna go and get this playing
backwards now I feel like
wait why is this shark and two bumps
over there I guess not even like paint
though
nothing Shadows what that's why I could
do it
anyway
interesting Ram
however
no there's one more checkpoint
[Music]
okay let's find one space
oh
[Music]
boy
three
on this last two second pick up this
checkpoint and then go for those two
and there you go that's all the plates
and that's
[Music]
the reward
apparently you don't get a reward for
just completely 11.
which is a shame
okay that works too
I wanted a reward for completely 11.
and the gems in the bonus levels I mean
that was a secret that was one of them
bonus levels
sound
playing
so I will just redo the level
I think of going the time turn
I think I didn't do that so to complete
this level and you have to explore the
interest because they're blocking the
exit
there's a way you can either I think
there's like two ways to get around it
you can either have be lucky and have
the correct balance on the water to
bounce over those
overdose
you managed to trigger the in them so
they explode
and without you exploding
[Music]
I guess you don't have to go far so it's
just one
I like the other one
can I say people right now I was too
late
so yeah
so I go for timer
and then basically
rushing as fast as this jet ski can go
watch the uh
detonator
just over there
and then just rushing my way back
yeah taking the last one is taking too
much time
wait where's sexy
hella strike up there
hydrate
yeah I need to hide it
[Music]
okay one more try
quality
[Music]
all right great timing there
this is much better
thank you for this yeah like bye
I think in the wrong directions of this
scene though but
yeah I can do this
okay
I can do this
okay nuts
what what
makes it locked off
block off so I can't get to it
[Music]
let's have read of them
like that
nice things
then I just have this tuna
are coming at the bad time in here but
[Music]
I'm gonna exit this over there
whoa I did it
oh can you be quicker than that I think
that was really quick
blue
I do wish they could add like
anyway I've done all these six levels
now it's just the DLC
I really think they should have added
the two bonus levels to
the DLC area maybe
no this second level as you call them
signals
because bonuses sufficiently in Steam
like yeah you still have to find them
first
[Music]
but after you find them
you just go to these extra plans from
here
which is the DNC level
this one
and there's ants
the other two here I think that can work
future tense
this is a completely new level for this
game
I see you're not knowing about
hey with great powers can great
opportunities
do you not knowing about this level from
the PS1 version that's understandable
so
it seems to be very calm here at the
start
of being
oh they were they were dead close
they got me
because they're moving will be back to
the first thing
[Music]
you have some food I might need them
what is it but like this
but now they're gone
and these enemies are completely here
all right
okay no shooting
interesting
[Music]
interesting indeed
[Music]
okay
thank you
man if that's something I think
foreign
against cortex
oh they don't
have any sneakers today
during this level without unlocking all
the
cover-ups
as I said with big power apps some great
opportunities
yeah yeah yeah about about this
oh you stand there okay
another one
this is
what
what what
this seems awfully long for like
alternative path
oh my God
all right oh
is it that trident on this level
okay
thank you for the checkpoint though
foreign
[Music]
okay I don't see
I'll just try to cross him
and then I had to fight it again ah nice
jump yeah
there you go
and now with that put it out of the way
I can concentrating the boxing there you
go
this morning
[Music]
oh
oh
okay
hey
okay
I can do it I can do it
foreign
[Music]
yeah
I wasn't freaking up
here we go
okay let's let's just ignore I mean
there's no point for me to wasting my
and I
trying to get those nice
but
oh I think I forgot one parts of the um
yeah I forgot that one
[Music]
does it I mean I had
okay now see some handbags so I can
shoot it make plus you can
which I assume is the point there
but it's uh
that's what I wanted last time
but is that timing timer for how long it
takes me to relax back or does it stay
upside down
no that was nice
[Music]
I guess I guess it doesn't jump us back
I guess it's my red Speck
[Music]
we can't shoot me
not much I can do this
I just have to be more
like that
what
I mean I can then on that platform and
like jump but I really thought that was
going to be able to jump over there
bye bouncing on it
didn't they
oh the license got me
why not spin it's been inside for the
arcade I keep forgetting about the
spinning
yeah like I keep forgetting
[Music]
[Music]
I mean yeah certainly I can do it back
because it says to me situation and
that's my mom stop shooting yeah
everybody
okay I'm back to the normal level
so this was the alternative pass to this
yeah
that's it I keep forgetting about the
please please
I am shaking nice it's having the
problems
can easy something now
that is
oh yeah I can let's say
oh that's good
excuse me
what a bonus level
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
and checkpoint
and now I've balancing them
okay
here we go go
come on
you can't be
okay thanks
[Music]
okay very timing
oh that's close I heard his skin
[Music]
oh oh I see
I see
it's a sort of timing thing
[Music]
and can I get the knives afternoon
foreign
you can
[Music]
I know I think it's best in
I mean
yeah
and I got it
I can use it now
you know to be on the safe side
let's see
and they want to eat it
[Music]
I mean that works that works
I mean yeah I was supposed to make team
he explode I mean now eggs
let me take it
whatever works
something
at all okay
oh
wait a minute
this is like oh you need to go down and
find a secret yeah
yeah
he's one of those
and of course
the we're hiding this one
okay I was gonna say yes grand found the
one on the side and then you just use
your gun but that was it but you can't
use the gun on those
first thing I did
but yeah concealing it didn't work
I had my suspicion up
I had to take you around the Midway
okay I mean nice to know I keep
forgetting about that thing but I mean
that was too
did it might be harder myself
you know what this time
yep
wait what
oh oh of course of course I should do
something that is completely impossible
to see
yeah why didn't I know that but the
solution to the problem
and that's not how the game works it's
and now I now have the not what I'm
supposed to be
I have a case is not part of the Game
Boy
and making up new Goons
breaking established rooms and that's
that's how you make a little harder
right
I mean he does make the human body
and things to do something
when they do have the mirror showing
that okay
but
at the same time
they have done that in class one without
the enemy right
so
[Music]
especially when it no they actually have
pictures
okay
okay
great timing
everything
okay
I'm gonna just jump over two boxes
really I mean
not enough
yes
okay
that's what I wanted
oh t-shirt
I think you've been left
there you go
oh no that's I mean
here we go
everything connected down here
and there's just this one
and then we're going to in some trash
over here
because they're not supposed to play in
there
and then this tricky one because there
is a thing up here
it's a cap here
but yeah there was something up there
and
I suspected guys
nice
that's how you can do it
10 more
let's see if I can get some more
oh oh they're going to do this
[Music]
foreign
one two
come on
[Music]
I got the checkpoint the keys I think
yeah
that was that was very unlucky
wait are you calling me
hey you don't think it was pure skill
um
yeah let me just see if I need a good
time first like this this is a good
thing
that is the point
Orange
there you go that's how I should have
done anything
I needed Japanese
[Music]
yeah yeah of course the little bit
I'm missing seventh grade
do you think I came back and find it
your skin this is coming from the bunny
you ran over more than 10 signs and her
Need for Speed stream
more than 10 I mean 10 signs
throughout all the need for speeds
things like this that's not bad to be
honest
that's not my head
I
considering how many races I get
there's a bet on
um
really one of them are missing
no no
[Music]
I don't think I can shoot this as I
always they can't get behind them
here we go
heavy
working so so
this is me now this
this one one box left because I got 37
when I reached them so there's one box
left
yeah so I should I should go back and
find enough so I have 44.
I'm working those
for the Coconut Point
yeah penguin is that that's eight
even though they were side of on the
side of the way but stupid
tune
yeah the bonus and things
and it's clearly nothing else here
[Music]
keep taking the saves no way down
[Music]
and I don't see any boxes in the mirror
either
really really
dead
can I
packed today it's probably the same one
no no yeah it's the same one
there's quite a lot more up there where
it can be
because it's not a small amount I think
right into that one
but
bye
you get that 44 I need eight
oh wow nice oh I can't stand the last
two without that boring
[Music]
no where was I
yeah I went I went up to this yeah
that's why I went
and the address was up there
there I had nothing else I honestly
that's
not
no
thank you very much
for me to lose it immediately but
three things
to die
let's see more time
with my jam
why did my jump go
what not okay
what was what was that
what did you fly forever
and now we're going to hit my mouse to
this because the game has I said I want
ideas
hello I'm here welcome Kitty and I'm
doing the very final level of the whole
game
and I still haven't collected all the
game sitting in this film a bit more
okay
currently I'm trying to figure out
because I missed eight boxes
eight boxes that's a lot of them
okay
19 check if there's nothing else above
all of these
I collected all of them in Valencia
because it has a separate Champion it's
yeah so yeah there's like this area
yeah yeah
and there's nothing up here I think
[Music]
and obviously
nothing else I think
the only thing
that had to change
and change
[Music]
oh okay I had to check that thing
now
what have we got
all right where's my
when's my next lemon months
you may need to do 11 again why
did they miss them in the desk area or
something
there's a problem I can do this
I think yeah sure I might need to do it
down again but at least I can like
you would never let's see
be like
[Music]
[Music]
okay
any
good boxes on the sides here
yeah maybe they are
um
[Music]
eight of them
yeah they're probably in this area that
thing
I don't see my answer would be
okay
oh I see here
Mickey
tonight you just need to get a vacuum
until the end of love again so that's a
problem
if I die I just stop 11 because it's
easy with chickens
thanks
I needed it I found them but I should be
able to do this without dying
I wish I had my mask but I went
are you serious yeah there they are the
eight of them
[Music]
and why I didn't check for that so I
didn't know I should have
[Music]
okay the level is short
I mean I don't have to do the
do the uh a bonus of this and yes that's
my previous one
this one she's High
[Music]
I wish I got the checkpoint but
definitely so for the one that you want
some iron
yeah I'm going to play safe
for like stepping on this one
checkpoints I could wish
and then I'll get to the end of knowing
and that's gonna even be tricked by that
one
father I need to get through this area
one two three four
yes thank you
[Music]
okay is it uh when we did 11.
if I don't
I had to try
but I didn't say 30 level
if I die and I died Saturday
points back
just those parts just like it's rid of
those enemies
you can do it I mean I did it I got to
the end of the level I was just missing
hitboxes
I just couldn't get to the level without
lying
they just had one and it's yeah
I should have seen these because it was
kind of obvious
so
with all that practice I should be able
to do this without knows
we definitely [ __ ]
without DC
but consider me I could probably without
no history
here we go see easy
I don't know what this one does but
let's activate it anyway
[Music]
I also not get by some
some of those Arrow boxes are metal
because that one could easily beam
uh wooden
[Music]
just by having
one more to Boston maybe they wanted 145
instead of 146.
I don't know
it's not like they could have removed or
added a box to that part
smile
see what the hair is you can add two of
them
and these funky does and also if this
one is made wooden
and that means that
you have to think and I consider this
area above to be 100 completed before
you remove the wooden box
adding to the difficulty of 11. let me
see that what they want
okay
I don't know there's some ideas okay oh
oh you want these I have anything
[Music]
you're welcome kitten
wow hello
the idea which I'm asking foreign
but basically after the
yeah
after I mention it on Saturday but I
guess I have made evil pon pon
and then a different character design
black with red markings I'm gonna create
other details which could be nice
Henry's stickman games
what kind of games are those
so
and then I was thinking uh so even fun
is on the Wheel
and when that option gets selected
obviously I would be even from fun fun
but after the first time that option get
selected I was thinking about adding
adding as a redeem as well
well now that one
okay they're fun I promise
I mean
I would doubt that
uh I didn't want to step on that one
Owen
oh I did it I did it
[Music]
I guess I should have sent one here I
don't know
[Music]
and I guess it should be an expensive
team and then there'll be Ableton
yay I did it again
I have now proven myself twice or I
should bring seven directions because I
could talk about that one
what happened to my double jumps
no music
all right that's not what I wanted
yeah they they didn't custody of dying
and responding in me
backing it that's about
painted I mean you must be able to do
that in other levels
too maybe it comes
Fair now
now
don't worry
I'll have this
easy
oh my
God this is Titanic damage from
everything
[Music]
how about it's investing up
okay mainly fine
and then don't step back
is kind of weird because
you don't
shoot
what
about because you don't like aim
the basuka around itself
you're moving a Target on the screen
which if it's overlaps on over something
it uh
yeah she would aim in that location
I know
it's just weird
I think it's in Focus but yeah I focus
mode all right see that again
I didn't want to think someone would be
a food like me
no
food as I am I don't even want to shoot
down my market I guess it works out
nicely
tough day
foreign
because I completed it and it became
even dark enough
there we go oh the missing of the 11 is
completely gone
not even outside
even outside needless thing
all right
I can do this without PC
is anyone message
and no that was a machine
and enable music
this certainly not an enough
in that case I guess it doesn't
descended music when you set it to
Sierra it just plays it as a volume
upstairs
one
way
sometimes I should just
go for damage
so you get to hear all these nice sound
effects they have community
yeah because that is possible because
then I'll actually start the music
and arguably leaving the desk area
should have started the regular music I
guess it continued and I had a good
music back
oh nice
okay I can do this
what
yes I'll take it but that was weird
[Music]
okay
doing this quickly I should do that
and then I do this
hey I got one for Less that was the
worst solution
[Music]
the music is back
the music is gone
music back for two seconds well someone
better pick up the phone
huh
and then there's
a teammate once
foreign
music should come back at the bonus yeah
I guess I caught it yeah
bonus thing but that means it
and I think we can't be funny but hey
by the idea that
he eats
I mean
you can upload them first okay
what's the idea that when it left when I
left the desk area and it should resume
the music we didn't so I would assume
that it
wouldn't have received
I haven't gotten that one it wouldn't
have received the music I've been
meaning but I said yeah okay but you
didn't
let's see now I get past this without
taking any damage
okay
I got the jam
I got the gym
nastic silenceness
but I got it nice
thank you
I mean not everything
so now I can
um
do the Titan
for this lemon
speak in this dragon and the future is
clear that's that genius for I guess I
did complete 11 or getting all the
bosses I don't know but anyway I will do
the time turn
attack will be quite subscribers
apparently because the ads are going to
paint
you get like 20 seconds
if I can complete the level within three
minutes but I got quite experienced now
with 11 so this should be enough
crafting
oh the timer is all the way over there
let's say we're just about me
you can do it I'm doing my best
um
all right
let's destroy everything
all right next one
I wonder what that is
I don't think he's worse
going for it
now there's a thing
get out of my way
I'm doing a tank plan
the second thing to my friend was King
what what
foreign
using the Pacifica during the adventure
and that's something
and I think it wasn't one more time yeah
the water level
we have to wait for all the water I used
to drink but guys and although I said I
could do the jump and the same thing
that's
that's definitely possible
[Music]
the thing I keep forgetting even ability
I got hit by
I'm doing my best
all right crying foreign
that's why I see
[Music]
okay I just
think you know what extent
like that
it's something
I guess that works
whatever works
Oh I thought I made it through that
skills
okay
got some skins
and that's the lack of skin
and yes that that's
foreign
but I'm not too far from the end of the
level
we just have to
do less of stealing mistakes
and then if I manage to just not lose
one of the masks that would actually
have a Trippy mask and that would help
me a lot
[Music]
thank you sneak pay attention to
um
so that that part you can see
anything
[Music]
amazing
yeah there you go
and then and there's a third mask
the game stopped working
this exactly
why the next happened
[Music]
it's still running
as hard as that
was awkward
you went so fast
let's repeat two else in two
that was fun yeah
I did so well too
I didn't lose the mouse I mean
Activision presents
I'm sorry
well it's not here but
he didn't want to blame
but it turns out the same seminar I
haven't lost the promise
Crash Bandicoot the continue option
should though they are the same I think
let's see
I hope this stream is running fine I
just I know my voice is like this this
constant
uh kicking I don't think that's a good
term but yeah there's somewhere nice the
only happens when I'm playing this game
so far
there's something with there the engine
that they're using as mentioned uh
in-house
engine of Their Own
unlike spider or crash four which are
using uh on Green Engine
an Unreal Engine cost is noises
no I'm on the screen
perfect get these
that was close that was close
okay
yeah
and now
I just need to clear that area
without taking damage and now to not
stand there
what
there is sometimes the slide just
doesn't work
and I don't get why
can I say I did jump off level
intentionally because I got cristies but
it's like no point here
[Music]
C3 yeah hey
this line is broken
why isn't the slide working
I'm not I'm I'm not going to get a good
time when this line is broken
and I've even started the game
okay don't get why it's
going to chill to the broken dude I'm
gonna start a new game
that's it I mean device
or something
no
I hesitated a bit too much now
memories
this line isn't broken but yes
me getting
yummy that's fun
that was yeah
what okay
wait all right
okay see if I did a regular double jump
it's fine
okay
I'm messing up I'm messing up so much
that's what I wanted
me but he's jumping so high
laughs
a touchdown the platform maybe that
messed everything up
I don't know
all right that's one I think
so that works second is
falling down
we're trying to pass enough
just run through that I probably have to
jump on it
okay so I have some ideas have you seen
me
foreign
[Music]
I wasted so much time
it takes like one second take to all of
them
beautiful God
nobody was close
yeah
magic damage there
I didn't remember what's supposed
that's me
pick up
okay so okay so if I do it like yeah
yeah
I'm not ready
[Music]
nice I think both
fell
oh
okay I mean
it worked but
yeah then that happened
hello
nappies hey
what's up
lemon
sure if you can call it DNC levels
included
from the start
the insane level
like me
vicarious lemon
[Music]
I mean it's not no thank you
come on it wasn't even doing that again
yeah
I mean
yeah
I know I don't know the festival says
that is human when enemies stop
attacking but they're attacking hitboxes
are still active
or you could argue Maybe
maybe I hit it just uh right before it
and then there was something yeah
he actually uh attacking I love
yesterday half thing
his attack was over
but he didn't have the attack and he
[ __ ] acting
I could be wrong
but nice nice
I'll take it
okay that happened
[Music]
how did it eventually
soon as it gets through this first part
and keeping
I don't like that
I don't know what it is it's
if I just want to jump up sometimes you
just
throw yourself something whatever I
don't get it
because yeah what happened
sometimes you just want to jump straight
up but you have lies forward
going on
and those are completely new enemies
as far as I know they don't exist in any
of the ordinals
and then
yeah that's what I wanted to do
and they are only in bed okay well did I
exist in the desk
they don't exist inside scrolling
portions
I guess the hitboxes are quite wide but
I mean yeah
yeah sometimes it is
nice nice
sometimes it feels like the visions of
the spin goes directly in the box but it
doesn't destroy
thank you
I need everything
go go
I'm messing up here
trying to do it this time
I'm sorry I can do it
about myself
when
I was nasty
yeah
I mean I think he's like
okay and then
nice
okay
I like knife
and then just rush through this hey
I guess I kept away
I want to be
can I save this no more
I was about pressing the wrong button
and
then I realized which part am I supposed
person
are we in the um
no except
that's not perfect
extra Health boost serious metal and
because I mean there's like two terms
and damage boost which is when you take
damage and use the
knockback to boost yourselves through
and that's the term which
which is sometimes used when people
meant means all the time which is
invisibility boost when you take damage
and use the immutability to boost your
through the level and sure maybe
sometimes in this case
in the same case when you are wasting
your extra Health
too and let's do the lemon
uh it should leave the laptop at the
time so she can have other than speak
again exactly
that is so true
yeah imagine
but with two faces
a little different
um
oh my God
if I could slide that means that I was
standing on the platform and if I stood
on the platform I should be able to jump
right am I wrong
it could be wrong
[Music]
oh no slime okay
[Music]
with me jumping but
I'll be done
this is awful
depending hands up
here
have fun everyone else don't have fun
fun
finally lost my demons
and yes I understand
um
very fantastic working
hey
yes
have fun goodbye
hope it goes when
[Music]
you know yes
[Music]
beautiful
doing that let's just keeping room
interesting interesting anyway I should
wait two things in here
I just seem to get
a better timing
with everything at least
terrible but
I'll figure something out
for that
I need that
okay just trust me you need a lot
oh my
this is quite
the challenge just missing you up and
not
you know
I mean
and yeah and I don't like how you can't
slide this and I don't get why you can't
slide doesn't it because you can
perfectly attack those with your spinner
pack
and if you can spin attack them why
can't he slide them
and I don't get why those are an
exception
I know I can't spin it back then you can
also jump on them so you can spin them
jump and then why can't you slide on
them
I don't get it
why are they accepting
I need to leave soon as well expecting a
quite a few minutes here I'll be back up
and then
if you're still going there well
certainly not at 11 you know
I don't know your time
and yeah
I hope that you come off is strong but I
mean I'm excited
um
no but I actually like okay it was like
and
maybe probably not
I just want to finish this happen and
being done
oh perfect perfect
I mean if you don't know I can find you
but I do want to add the coffee this
thing back add the banner about the chat
let's break that
and I mean you could say I did back in
half an hour I think that there's more
recent one that doesn't even rely on the
same thing there we go
it's just me
thank you
trying to say happy happy happy happy
I should be able to do this is going
perfect
yeah
I haven't done it yet but I want that
Xbox in my name before people can see
how unless it is
come on come on come on
[Music]
I take it
it's very quick it is but still get that
fine
oh perfect timing
I know you can do it I know I can do it
yeah I should be able to do it you know
what I will use the Pacific in that
moment
I could just jump over it but you know
I'm scared
I'm just kidding funny
I mean I wasn't great but oh come on
and also it's a good start to be packed
so
and to be fine
I didn't practice
come on
why am I messing up so much
they don't really run after lemon
oh my
well I got a kitchen
that's great I really hope this one
I have a jump in here with corn ones
it went
and a jump engine person too we found
someone weird
but for some reason the person was very
fixated in a particular or at least next
time he's
stuff
be back in half an hour if you still
playing we'll see
probably [ __ ]
because I'm already a half an hour last
over time
so
it's probably just throwing an extra
stream tomorrow to finish up first three
same kind of thing
now now I'm just messing up everywhere
[Music]
no more time yep it's over time
[Music]
because sometimes you can run through
them
goodbye
by side and I was saving so much time
and and that's team
I guess
is there enough errors
yes thank you I'm going to be with that
one anymore
foreign
mask
Ed what happened I was straight above
the platform and then I slid off him
that was outside
I was doing some great today's
what I was doing here
different expensive
but this problem didn't even show up and
before I did a platform for some weird
reason
I've been down on the enemy sure but
that should pushed me up
and then the bathroom
I think it's because I'm
right
but I mean I can say nothing
um
I shouldn't wait for the question I
think I should just go
I'm doing better now
again again those enemies are so weird
if you touch them
everything messes up
why are they so weird why are they not
like all other animals
you really need for me
on other enemies amazing yes drum series
no problems
in fact they don't fix 20 and Superman
at least that's the thing I get
everything
do I get overtime pay for today I mean
if you're working and I've been working
every time
you look you don't get overtime first to
me I mean you do get behind
me I do wish as a creator
that I could enable like
extra point appointment
which would be applied to everyone
and
[Music]
it should probably be a restriction to
how he can use it so he can't
what
what
I'm confused
what is happening
why are those enemies so weird why can't
we behave like every other thing that
amazing
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
why not
no thanks
I don't want the slide him
come on
man
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
twitch and then
the announcements
a bit too many space there
because it would be a neat feature
I don't think
I think
it's quicker to do that let's have a
shooting that's enemy
you can do the Russian boxing I mean I
kind of think
I see what that happens
what is it more consistent
and there we go
then
thank you
this area
what happened with my double jump
I got to go I guess
this is a good time for me to end this
week because everyone has a girl
yeah he understands and if you leave I
don't think I have any watching this
come on
no I want to see fun [ __ ] being
annoying the news
I know I understand
[Music]
tomorrow at the same time just to clean
it up to the remaining of the game
I think this way
so next week I can start something else
I don't know what it should be
okay correct
[Music]
candy
all right as soon as I finish up this
level it's going to be nice
I really really SmackDown on
like that
foreign
that was a defined
got the spinner
you can talk in the hands by nothing
what happened to my jump
I was pressing to jump so many times
I I mean I realized
and wanted to jump back but
what what
nothing happened
because that's bad
it's so close to finishing this lemon
foreign
I shouldn't have account for that I
should probably
try to do like tomatoes thing you just
think it's called
you think
[Music]
what happened with my eyes
I guess I landed a bit too being drunk
that way but I mean if I fall down and
touch an enemy isn't that
high temperature and jumping on the
enemy I don't know
don't let those enemies
beautiful dog
okay I hesitate anything
I really want to stand on the other
platforms I could do another
night jump
s
I just thinking that one
crazy I was crazy once then knocked me
in the room
what
a rubbery with rats
Rex makes me crazy
crazy
that's crazy
welcome Mexican passport that's a very
interesting message I have to share
there
is
a good champion
yeah and he knows that that was a weird
request message
I hope you have a great day today well I
wasn't having anything today I think
this never decided to be another room
what's that follow I got secret screen
I thank you for the photo I actually
hadn't thought
but I'm I'm I will have uh can I still
need to streaming
I haven't gotten anything set up
it's completely it's a week so
I can barely play the game with Stephen
Sin Cara which causes
and ideas like that I don't know
I'm out of my dreams I can
I've been hydrating you know I'm having
your own I am
I'm for five minutes over time by the
way
we use this position
so I decided to just finish this level
and then finish up this morning after me
you want to know it all right I mean I
think it's never going 15 minutes now
I can attack you
okay
quite Vine it is affecting
just above it I had wrongworks
by the way I didn't take damage
no buttons
thank you
let me know next time
no
I didn't move forward
I fell off
I made a mistake
another restart
[Music]
I like that that why couldn't I detect
that one
why is the cube so inconsistent when I
can and can't attack these animals
[Music]
which is it does and it's not specific
in this location it's a pretty nice
experience
but that type of enemy is what has
ruined the most of my runs
a weird inconsistency
compared to every other animal that that
have no problems
[Music]
I'm fine with all the other enemies
just those
I mean he's going to push me off
platforms
even though they should die they die but
they still push me off their friends
it's not annoying because it's jeans
what
[Music]
mm-hmm
I guess if you jump too high
okay
yes I don't know just the fast side
that's going on
oh no
of course
I might take that much once when I can
take those twice
okay and listen
you know what that one
I mean what's worse the hanging I mean
sometimes we just die from affecting
them even though I said no we shouldn't
make ways around anyway because that's
the mask
not like I'm trying to get funny okay I
guess I'm going to go
so
I don't know if you can find this pen
I'm back welcome back that was cute
but you did say let's go very pretty
thing yeah Finance your day is to stay
with me
play with me when I'm standing on the
bed room and falling off the bathroom
even though I did stand on it but I mean
I don't like making opportunities for
this game
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
okay let's see
all right thank you bye but then I have
to get something to eat
I can't do that
watch me
I mean it's working it might be
a little bit gold
if they did anything nice little time
it's a technique but
okay thank you
okay
[Music]
no
no swear the enemies I was supposed to
jump on really strengthy there you go
I think what's good I got good
all right I want that far away from last
night is
but I got it
I got gold I could have done it again
but
[Music]
I got it
I got it
and you remember that means that is the
end of the Stream
I just want to see how far away from the
other time but
only four hours I mean it did not take
place
but for some reason the game took very
long time there without being too sounds
they got
five minutes 10 seconds well
in 70 seconds
to say okay all right kinda but apart
from it like 18 seconds
which is nice
so now I just need to collect the
remaining gems and
ringtones and times like this one is
society
of 31 but wait
all right must not have done time
channel one of them
and by the way 31 minutes it is 33 level
switch
is it meant with that level is level 31
that I just did and then you have the
two Secrets level 32 instead of three
so
whatever
[Music]
which is the most important thing here
and then
and yeah
and basically everyone left to give me I
mean the history myself that's it
but welcome
the
should we go and visit someone like I
don't know Benny he's dreaming at the
moment he's a nice
he's nice funny
crowd is gone
he's playing Tomb Raider unfinished
business he does the
ass PlayStation
[Music]
restaurant achievements basically
and he's if which people probably know
if you met him before he's quite
into too pretty too
tubing and reading
[Music]
what
more subscribers do they change one
because that's the funny one
otherwise you can always pay 100 points
to unlock one of the other ones to
yes if you feel nice
and then we're gonna say hello
because I'm tired because I'm
I'm
56 minutes over time
and I'm tired

[Music]

[Music]
