in
welcome William
and campgrounds
and kitten
and it's coming with that e
it's a it's a great letter
but you don't have in your name
okay let's see
let's go let's get straight back to the
game
yeah
so as we can see
in the Need for Speed tour I'm doing not
so great
well but let's continue I'll do this as
many as I can
oh
this one requires a higher class
[Music]
and polish
I need to polish up on my polish
Becky downstairs
can I
can I even purchase now I cannot even
purchase is that only three of them
but
there's six million
me point eight
and this we
yeah I need like not much more
like
a bit more than a million
problem I should be able to do that
before I can continue here
oh
yeah basically need to perform better at
these races
which one of these brush what's supposed
to do yes
I mean this is fully upgraded so nothing
more to do there
what do I I can't compare
from here Trevor
it's not compare
and that's okay that's
a bit bad but I think this one is the
one I should go with
so let's repair the car
and use it
to do this
just that clearly that's
okay
so anyway
let's waste no more time and begin
with 15 minutes
[Music]
three
can I quickly change that
possibly yeah
there you go hopefully that worked
so let's continue I changed go then
layout
I thought I changed it to being
numbers and not analog
do anything because everything I want a
digital so I can see the numbers clearly
second easier time with Stephen
the game is running smoother too
it's the biggest
the speedometer
I didn't really clearly show what speed
it was
make sure it was the only and it's which
was nice I guess
they could easily fit two numbers there
which would be nice
[Music]
oh well
[Music]
it's good enough
I did I think I did well in the first
race but
speaking to him well
oh no
[Music]
yes
I'm doing so when
and then the car is on its side
so
let's practice in okay I can climb this
again there's no problem
just need to learn that the
help countries button right instead
I think this layout
I mean this is layouts and
that's it's not much of a big much big
rapid defense
okay
[Music]
lap two
[Music]
it's basically just the speed
oh whoops and the map that has switched
positions
and when the time
someone is whoops someone flick the car
I will do such a thing
how silly of them
and I wasn't responsible for that I mean
I've never been responsible for that but
I was definitely not responsible for
that one
I was a negative romantic responsibility
responsible for that one
right not by my English
it's probably very obvious that English
is not my first language
already
I don't think I have to say that for to
be obvious
yeah I'm not too far behind
why is this should I be trying
more off the road than I do
that's some skin
heavy counted how many signs have
killed this race
don't remember running over on the signs
there so
[Music]
maybe two cars in the league are up
ahead
[Music]
don't think the hobby is
your English is so cute oh thank you
in which way is my English cute is my
French grammar now the game is a bit of
a stalker it it's very rarely but the
audio cuts out
not sure what's going on but it's fine
it's
it's at least not like before when it
was dropping a lot of friends
so
now our skin is running very smoothly
making it more painful
what what I didn't kill that sign so
it's good
whoa attack only
in this game you can basically drive on
grass like it's asphalt
okay
[Music]
here is the finish line so it's on the
one left left
stop saying like
okay I will apply that after the snap
I really wish I could have trying to
cherry juice
but it doesn't seem to pass the
shortcuts
through even though it should do that
but of course the goal is to have the
wow what did the UI change I told you
sadly this is the only way to get the
numbers for which speed I have
the other one is a bit
and not specific enough
and I prefer the numbers
it's just the speed the map that has
switch positions okay technically
the map has taken a speeds position the
speed has taken the time's position and
the time is taking the maps position I
think
or something like that
and also for the time I would I wish it
could show like
last lap total time the space for that
congratulations you placed first okay
let's change
there was as I said the first left first
race is easy this second race I wish you
told me all right is just mirrored step
forward I should not know if you thought
about what's forward
it's cool the king see I got some
support here
it is much cooler
but yeah this is a situation where like
[Music]
one go which I think a lot of games
actually
the previous song was not mirrored and
backwards or was it awesome yet
no it wasn't near this because the signs
were on the right side
it was it was backwards
if not mirrored
perhaps I actually killed that sign this
is forwards and near it
anyway
yeah when it comes to screaming which is
another game haven't considered when
even if they do consider statement I
haven't considered this very important
detail not everyone uses the same units
so
as a streamer it would it would be quite
convenient to have
usually both sets of units being
displayed on the Stream
because I said there is plenty of space
to fit a second set of numbers
they could make the secondary numbers
gray so
they aren't as distracting to me or
something
but sad thank you thank you a lot of
scientists this race for selfies
huh
uh
not that they must review from this car
[Music]
this car is going fast
something sense tells me you can't drive
that's like coming maybe sister roads
like these
[Music]
making a corner 120 140. that's that
seems a bit too fast
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay
stand left now it means
that was half the naps and I always mess
up this
if I did have a works Night I'd be
drinking shots of popcorn I mean you can
do it anyway
that's I'm killing sciences and really
kind of
FM Sunny is dry oh well we're off on
Monday next week and I have full body
ready for it that sounds great
[Applause]
this game looks fun I might try it one
day it's um
[Music]
I like this for the carrier and the
Damage thing
but
it can still I mean of course the
problem with it compared to Modern
racing games is obviously
but the graphics isn't that great
there's a very small number of cars
available as far as tracks
and
this physics season 3D
death rate
which I do kind of prefer
and I'm arcades simulation okay
how are you
[Music]
yeah I don't think I'll win this face
it's the final lap
the speed bunny
not much speed much I'm on the crash
balance moment
[Music]
all right
yeah that that jump really messes me up
that is it
oh how rude
just push me off the track like that
yeah and I was catching up and then
okay if it's a cute crash button
yeah not to be confused with the crash
damage but I mean at this point it's
basically the same
oh yeah
car
stopped
I'm not going to catch up with those
other cars
I had my chance and I
messed up
I might be able to get past one car
yeah I want to close out of two cars and
go now I'm not gonna catch up
I didn't come last at least that's
something
[Music]
and I'm second in points
so yeah this car needs some repair and
this is the night track I think let's
double check that
okay let's check the standing so yeah in
second place big gym is in first
and a track
what about no mirroring and now it's
raining it's not night
so I just need to get ahead of big gym
preferably pink team should
get far behind
three two
yeah
[Music]
sorry meeting
oh oh nice a lot of conditions happening
[Applause]
oh I'm sorry about that
oh
that
didn't you guys can
what the name
trashy
that's a good description everything
that happened just crashing
[Music]
if it was more stimulating that would be
the terrible accident
and the race had to be canceled or
something
[Music]
oh I rate this ahead
hey all right did you want to get past
big team let me pass you
and take care of that for me
I'm sorry let me pass
okay
now
no no no don't do that
[Music]
okay
[Music]
taking that corner much safer
now that I do think it was that corner
let's hope it's thin
[Music]
I got a broken thing right
excuse me
welcome
he's running him
[Music]
something uh it reminds me of that song
that's why I haven't quite
and I've tried to remember the lyrics
Because running the things whatever hey
kitten hey
I'll add you
how are you on
well I'm definitely feeling better today
I was feeling about it yesterday too but
yeah yesterday was not a good day for
streaming but that's that's behind me
now
today it is a better day you can stream
is going much better and this game is
running smoother than before
and however my driving is still as
terrible as it's usually so
that hasn't changed
and you're doing great come from
I'm doing I'm in last position I'm not
sure what you mean by doing things here
sorry about that
someone got stuck in the Press
I had nothing to do with it I see sure
foreign
[Music]
as long as you're having fun yeah that
is the most important part I mean it is
fun to win too but I mean I don't mind a
challenge
so
[Music]
let me you have to think that one
[Music]
in the moment I need a bit more
concentrating
here
they're lucky
[Music]
gosh
I would have crashed a lot of fun now so
yeah I didn't wait
well that's
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so
you don't really started
fast cars
rainy weather
[Music]
[Music]
now what are you doing bitching I wasn't
interviewing thank you card for being
there
no don't don't affect me more
I just need to get ahead of this
painting
nice last segment
ation
nothing this is the last requirements
now he's flipping apart no
congratulations and it said it's an
improvement over the last laugh but
be right back okay have fun yeah
let me know when you're back
[Music]
because it's fun when you're here
spreading so much positivity
and now it's like
I did the outfits cheaper
and a bit cheaper
I think most most people do like buying
what that means and now it's set to 15
minutes
okay
there you go three two one three two one
okay
good guy just hit your car I mean it
happens
luckily the cars are invincible as soon
as they cross the finish line
that was a feature in real life that
would be cool
[Music]
sort of beef James
thank you
backtrack yes
I hope you like to design
[Applause]
[Music]
of the doctor now that of the of the
underwear
[Music]
come on big team what are you doing
thank you
[Music]
on this yeah she she's a racecar driver
she needs a bit of sporty underwear
I do so cute
with a heart of course because
from from Mike's hearts on Underground
whoops I think that's cyanide
and
there we go
now big Jam is a little gym
ah
[Music]
I'm building 15 I hope it's okay this
would have been this qualification in
real life but
a few things
now the swimsuit is perfect
uh for the fish came it is
I really hope you know if this game
really
improving performance
is one magical important performance but
otherwise if someone knows how to
multiplicate anything like change the
controls that could be a possible it is
a Unity I have no experience modding
Unity but it is possible to Mark Unity
so I should check if there are any kind
of mods for it
someone needs to remind me of doing that
someone should write a message on the
Quantum survey
we write that a check for much the
fishing
in Celsius
yeah I guess it would make sense to have
certain outfits being
a cheaper or like probably last longer
that's probably insane
we were certain things
orange
still of course
I'm not making any prongs here
especially if I try like that
free
but yeah
if I am doing so tightly on this track
foreign
[Music]
thank you
you are amazing
and helpful and kind
meow meow
meow meow meow
yeah I'm not going to get the first
place in this way oops I killed another
sign
[Music]
I think it's going to change his song
that it starts at Microsoft
it's fine it's much better than how it
was before so I find it
I wonder if it is because
when it loves the next song it loves the
whole song in the memory and that makes
it fine
because loading it is loading from
memory is there another song
the song fires out that loud show
putting the whole song in memory to
shoot it just take a very short time but
if it requires that to be done during a
single frame the game would start
so it is possible that that's what it's
doing
[Music]
[Applause]
there's a song can't be more than a few
magnifies I think
[Music]
because it is compressed
so yeah I could believe
no no right if it loves in the memory I
mean it it could still love the whole
song compressed into my mind
now it would aren't compress it and then
it will take a lot of space
trying to think about how to how they
develop the game
[Music]
I think I said with his third place
it's not too bad I think
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
it even started that time so maybe it
doesn't have anything to do with the
songs
[Music]
congratulations you placed thirds
so many questions maybe you shouldn't
like
I am quite big gym still have one more
point for us
yeah he got past that eye right
that I rate
anyway here's a smartphone
nah
mirrored and forward
it says there is no weather but it can
still snow so the cans will be weather
you should be on off or dynamic
chronic Avalanche there's no ambulance
wait I forgot to check who was in the
first anyway
[Music]
touched it
[Music]
[Music]
I am in first position and I did nothing
oddly to get here
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
so far it goes well
I'm in the lead
and I'm actually
[Music]
two and a half seconds ahead that's
that's not bad
[Music]
oh they're catching up
I was throwing a bit more careful there
to not destroy the car
because I still have the lead
as long as I can keep the lead is fine
fun face
with an emotion I can't feed
bearing
intently I don't know if that's a word
even
[Music]
and if it is a word I have no idea what
it means
[Music]
but maybe I shouldn't say it
[Music]
well it is the second lap
oh I'm actually three seconds to have
the half a seven
it's something
specifically
[Music]
and something yeah
it's a word it's just an adverb well I
use it as an adverb so that's good
meaning to do something with intent okay
okay
she's starting with intense
Love Hurts
great to see such positivity and love
is it sandlap I've completed a half left
so far
[Music]
yeah five and a half seconds you need
it's very easy all of a sudden I don't
know someone feels like the game is
easier if you are in the first position
when you're trying to get to the first
position
that's a big gym fun for the last
position for some reason the squad is
still right behind and I don't know who
had 100 points
I might still not win that first
position I mean I should just try better
because I don't need to care about what
their positions are if I just get
practices you never instead but oh well
that's control
yep
non-sentuation she got this pon pon and
thank you
I hope I got this
[Music]
final lap
final leg okay
thanks
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
I think that section of the track is
where I can pull ahead of the computers
quite far
then there's the second half of the
entire
up the track
where I started
yeah he's like this part
[Music]
this is my last record still like yeah
and there's a scratch a car again
[Music]
[Music]
best left you placed first
oops
Unity
so it's scorched that purpose so
basically to win this I basically had to
push scorcher and
but yeah it's now it's actually snow
ready
so let's see
yeah yeah
hydrate and also
time
of hydrating
three two one go
and attached my exploration so bad
foreign
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
oh yeah
of course
I look straight away I can do it okay
[Applause]
thank you you're welcome it is a cute
swimsuit
foreign
probably using winter tires and I don't
have access to that
[Music]
so fast
I'm supposed to catch up
that's a piece like I see further away
you get in the car faster it seems like
the car is going
yes honestly it seems like you have
reversed the rubber banding somehow
[Music]
and now it's stuck
I am catching up
but
[Music]
[Music]
someone is smart
come on
I just want to talk with you
one on one
close together
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
fine are you so fast again
[Music]
okay
[Music]
don't push pause
[Music]
thank you pushing this watch
please get that right
please get out of the way
I'm not racing it I'm only racing
scorched here I really need it for me
all right stop pumping me
that was intentional
I would never intention about someone
[Music]
oh wow
seven pump again
[Music]
I'm not here to fight yet
I only had to catch up
nope nothing here uh
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
that's Mass my chance of me
but I did not do that
[Music]
it's not anything I continue this race I
guess first no one
probably a high performance class
Seattle would break their dreams
congratulations
something at least
it's not the first
place
move on to the next circuit well
you don't have enough
and this is not I was supposed to use
silver is better than
I guess
which one of these this is
the second one I used
this one
I think the star was built by Bush
because of losing his cars his voice
across the house
the divorce is the only thing that he
had left him today
he got paid to build snowman
okay concentration time
concentrating on getting first
and then take that away from me too no
it gives him another reasons we don't
understand
that's his income he leaves them and
forgiven one go oh am I so sad
dest story
[Music]
maybe you should build the snowman so
close to the track then
[Music]
can build them anywhere else
oh
that was my intention
[Music]
I tried to slow down what's going so
fast
[Music]
used his performance ahead
[Music]
and if you think that's bad
I'm sitting here laughing at it because
I just had a hug
is that one another person you're not a
horrible person
who she's a horrible person
and I'm a horrible trying
the first edition thing
[Music]
about that
[Music]
just a little push
[Music]
okay one car left
bulls eye
or bulls the first
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
get out of the way
[Music]
that car disappeared I wonder what
happened to that tragic
where they used to draw parents then
drove into that
through that fence for some reason I
have no idea why
such a strange Behavior
okay there we go
I'm back you're back everyone's back
[Music]
yeah
luckily I guess that's the benefit of
different gamer laptop
yeah I have a backup battery so I don't
lose my promise
but of course I cannot speak him at the
same time
because when
if I would have a backup battery
body directing wonder if it would work
then
because the route you just connected
okay well during that is that it's not
the same as electricity so
thank you first place again
the random setback
[Music]
well I guess that's the traditional
every stream is currently connected at
some point for some kissing
congratulations
only two laps first place nice nice
I think like last time I think I got a
first place
for the first race
just repair the car
and now it's shaking Pom-Pom what is
that supposed to mean
why did he he's checking I started to
have something animated
the sweet spots is going to be active
whatever so it has compensation go
all right
[Music]
when
yeah I didn't expect that to happen
like an excitement
about winning
that's not how I read it but I can I can
see what you need
uh I'm trying to tell me and then it's
supposed to be basically the same right
putting it hurts
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
hi hi
now I see bullying everyone
your lap takes like one two
and a half minutes
for each
race here should take about five minutes
[Music]
going a bit too close to that one
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
excitement
[Music]
it is exciting I have the first position
right now right at this moment
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
a few seconds sleep
means that I can't be without
that's gonna say because that means I
can drive a bit safer I say as I almost
yes I almost run into the
metal railing
so that's two big dreamers
tortoise is the one that could cause me
issues but I don't need to concentrate
on that
as long as I'm before a tortoise that
should be no problem prepare the car for
the next race
and that's actually probably
at this point confirm that it is three
two that between fitting down at this
point
okay so it's raining
[Music]
all right stop attacking me
I do not approve being tackled
a surprise kids
okay okay
[Music]
taking slight damage but it's okay
just need to keep
now I'll probably take the long play
around
too slippery to do any tricks there
of all those cars are so close together
are they like that tortoise is
quite far far behind now
oh I even further behind
[ __ ] oh
oh okay okay
can't decide which positions you're
going to be in preferably [ __ ]
behind
upside
uh you made my swing swing by me
[Music]
anyway
with tortoise so far behind
that means that it's quite different
between me and 30 sister
which is great
It's the final lap
the final lap of the race is done
now to the second half
is the exact same house
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
no fancy shortcuts this time
[Music]
[Music]
is this going around
[Music]
thanks for driving better this time it's
almost like a high frame rate of the
game it's making it easy to play what a
surprise
now when the game was running at 10 15
frames a second that's that wasn't
enough frames to react to especially
when it was Amplified
but now that it has a stable I actually
don't know which framework is trying to
name it
but I'm not really happy that's the same
famous I'm happy with 30 plus
easy games
that would be 30 60.
that's that's been usually 60.
computer skin studies
technique
[Music]
great lap you place it first
great life a great race too I would say
[Music]
I look at that tortoise
who has this is the second place yes
only 57 points and I have 90.
and if I have a great enough need
[Music]
um let's start this over the third is
far behind again because tortoise is
going to start further behind welcome
second viewing
feel free to Mark or write to the cards
if you sell if you want to
three two one go
[Music]
Help contact me no attacking
I don't want to tackle
[Music]
okay
oh
let me try this side right track the
sweet races now
I shouldn't be surprised by the corners
but I have
I am
I A Night level yep
and there went the light
nightmare my worst enemy
Duty
look at it
[Music]
all right good thing is that
too dark
this is quite dark
something like it up to these cars thank
you for the extra night
I hear a lot of crashing
and it's not me this time
yeah I was afraid that would determine
this one
[Music]
's eye is your name
I'm not sorry about your partner
I'm so talking but it's so dark in here
foreign
that was close
that could have gone badly
but I did it
or I did not smell the trash into that
wall
there
[Music]
[Applause]
okay uh
no honky
you're not a kiss
surprise I actually managed to take the
first place
that
driving distance
damn it
[Music]
another crash
that's I crashed
this doesn't help yeah I guess I'll take
a circumcision it's not too bad
[Music]
[Music]
great laps you placed second
it's it's behind Thunder which isn't
really great though but tortoise came
last
so that's nice but not that I'm just
about with the second most points that
wasn't too bad actually
I'm kind of help with that
but um
I have more than 30 points which means
that I care for fights fourth fate
horrified One race
but obviously I wouldn't do that until
it's the last race
three two one go
okay new tracks
same track but it's new
value
different
that
nothing oh don't step down
massive crash
[Music]
ES
[Music]
um yeah this is now take this part
instead
[Music]
okay let's see
like around these cars they are already
roads
[Music]
sorry about that you're just a bit away
[Music]
else
you're driving into the one like that
what
The Pastels
I'm Alabama
[Music]
all of us in the way
let's keep that side position I think
this yeah
first position actually and I forgot
about myself
[Music]
it's good
now I just need to keep the first
position for the final lap
let's see if I can do that
I'm already off the road
[Music]
okay
so that section in it
you must kill ah touch them on
should be easy enough yeah
it should probably be easy
I feel like that that Fountain has
caused another position it's not
declined in
[Music]
and they lost it again
[Music]
Pips
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
why the crafting damage and
yeah it wasn't good
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
he's three two one go
[Music]
okay
so it's mirrored okay that's fine
you can't do nuts
let's see if they want to do this
foreign
of course
[Music]
but it looks good so far
[Music]
and then pumpkin one
[Music]
that's my point
that's the song that's me
but I can also have one money past me
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
but
it is the second lap now I'm approaching
the end of the night
now and then
Victory will be mine
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
great left you've won the race well
I'm on the Reigns
Dante came in this position
so that means that I have now over 60
points in lead yay and you know what
that means I don't have to do the
remaining two races
I mean not that I think Dante would have
wanted to
remaining races anyway
[Applause]
so that means that I don't have to do
this final 10 minutes of strange
but of course I still have to start a
race and perfect the race and not for
free this circle which is an important
distinction to be made
I have to wait for it to start with
Buffet the race and now we can check the
standings
[Music]
hurts I just think he's still happy
it doesn't make any sense
so Dante came in last
that doesn't make any sense we had 107.
many different I'm stupid how much how
much Point did you have he didn't
understand
he must have come very far down at least
from this race which position yeah it
comes three two that was lost
such a bad driver is congratulations you
have successfully completed this
year I think that
I want to check the standings
he gots a little pointer at a headset
the copiest
okay the best car for the AAA class
is this one that costs 6 million should
I go for that
or should I go for one of the existing
ones
and that's awesome
[Music]
like maybe I can do one of these other
ones I didn't take this one I should be
able to see this one right
because I do have uh this one
yes let's do
this one
do you want to do a
I don't know
something like this
I don't know
I'll do
probably One race
so you can get a sense of how this will
go
so you don't have to put in your points
yet
and then after you see how this goes you
can determine although you might not be
able to see the full race because it
sounds at five minutes
there we go
that's around the two laps as well
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
one reason
[Music]
oh
[Music]
[Music]
my
God
[Music]
okay here we go
that position is not bad
about it
he's being upside down on the side
all right yep
that's the first race
great lap is one minute left put in your
predictions how do you think this
Championship will go
it's only one minutes to predict that's
but that's the time you get
um I will pack I will repair the car
after every race
45 seconds and One Direction
no pressure five seconds
yeah
because no one wants to predict
I I I understand
oh well no prediction
Let's ignore the prediction then
foreign
[Music]
I swear
this is the second
track in the championship
and I am doing better than me
previous race
but
you got this
I don't think I will win this
Championship because I
just four hours
Fitness train
we got a cheetah
is it okay to
feed a cheetah
what
I didn't do that
final left
yeah I don't think that's an out okay
other there was no fit for yourself the
speeding to the people that's
but that's a penalty
well according to the audience it's more
exciting He's 33 so
[Music]
foreign
I will keep the audience what they want
that's not how
that's not very dude
the tuna came by the tuna
oh I don't know that's that's worse
[Music]
great laugh congratulations you placed
third
and my rabbit Karen and that's a tuna
boy
so
okay
yeah I don't I have got this I probably
need to try this again
okay let me try this again so what I
will do is for some reason this track is
this map on screen is blue
so I will forfeit this phrase you have
to take whatever take whatever money I
get from the race
and then I'm trying to finish it in the
tournament
finally got anything from this probably
paid Morehead for the uh
at the entrance fee plus the damages are
paid for probably more than a one
three two
one go
sir anyway let's try this again
[Applause]
so there you go this is feels much
better now
don't forget
there's no point packing now
because there are no points
oh
wow
figure first position
and now let's see if I can keep it
keep getting along this track is
the awkward Matthews map should have put
it in the middle and assumed in on it
anymore
[Music]
Ah that's the one
It's the final left
[Music]
final neck
[Music]
only two left
I cannot do four or eight laps which is
also a strange thing in this game how
you can
how the number of laps is so limited
why not stream or six
ten
[Music]
I'm kind of glad ten laps is not a
sinking sandwich but
and why not I had a number between two
and eight
[Music]
which next game which is Hot Pursuit too
I think
I missed the garden flip
I think you are allowed to set any
number of laps
from two
up to whatever the max is
your pants
so long ago I played that game
I did I keep some comes inside like
I did it I won the first race let's
repair it I'm not sure if I should
repair the car for every race
yeah
race with two
three two race two yes
race two on Raceway two
subscribers
okay so far I'm good so good driving a
bit too much outside the track but
but it's fine
[Music]
final lap
speeding through the pits
[Music]
I guess it's also seeing Need for Speed
there are no reviews
all right oh no
there's more damage than I expected
[Music]
great laps
[Applause]
60 50 40 72
and now
the final release
on Raceway 3
.
so I didn't try one last time
three two one go now
ready
bumpy
that was a hard press
but I don't know
disappeared
sorry for ruining your
nice work
[Music]
and where's the pizza
they're not Pits on this track
the first strike
oh see
[Music]
how it counts
pumping the Moon Final up first place
doing it I'll take it this time bye
I might actually win this championship
that's your best lap you played first
I came in first
congratulations you have successfully
completed this circuit you have
congratulations you have successfully
completed this tier you have been
awarded the gold trophy you're ready to
challenge the next here
very nice
do I have a Porsche
now I had a point check
in that case I can't do it that race
but is I want this car
oh it's supposed to stop doing this no
it's not you can see the numbers there
which doesn't seem to be as good as
this one
broken Maybe This Bear actually
is this better
and these numbers so speed is 12 speed
is one two three four and a bit
let's raise this six in a bit
and if I look at
this car
this one is one two three four five and
a bit
and this is almost seven so I guess it
is better
fun pumps back behind the wheels look at
I've been behind the wheel
for two hours now
um and then no human has died yet
that should mean that I should be able
to sell on other cars I mean I could let
me sell this one because this one isn't
good at all
and I don't need a jaguar
and even if they would be like a
challenge like that
certainly that's quite good enough
still don't have enough money I still
need six million
I can't do this one
so
you could redo this one and actually try
to get gold
and this time I can use this card
that sounds like a good idea
do you want to do what's their
prediction for the if I'm actually going
to get go this time
does anyone want to do that
quick prediction then
willowin we like come only second or
third so that would be a
whatever you call it I still get a medal
or do will I come in forensics
someone has six cast secondly sickness
an option otherwise they will start
prediction
your eyes
we have one person going for the first
instead of just pressing add more and
more you can press add a custom amount
is you know
now we get now we're getting something
here
one person at first one person's on
second third
yeah I'm learning
this is going to be exciting
anyone else wanting to to bet
I'm trying to win
last time I got third third place no
wait the first time I got set placed
last time I got second place and this
time I'm going to try to go for first
place
so
I'm trying my best
trust me
well this time is running out
that can at least start the race
I can't see it for the screen like it's
infinitely 10 seconds left yeah I can
start erase it probably takes like 10
seconds for it to start up
and since I didn't win this car from my
race setup with the car isn't broken
prediction time away
your people predicted
[Music]
and let's see
I can't do this
this is me or this
just tear your feet
or am I small
you're going well so far I will
try to avoid pump unitizing I said oh I
didn't even complete the sentence before
I bumped into something
but no damage so that's good
no not super damage
these still think there's like one this
one something
[Music]
okay doing well so far
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
and then
if you I follow it
comes to prediction is basically if
there isn't at least two different
options anyone has predicted four the
prediction will not go soon
twitch will accept it but I won't accept
it as in that case all points are
returned but since we did have two
different
uh options being predicted for this one
went through
and the second route is that
if an option that no one predicted wins
I will also give all the points back
because that's not fun
so
I do still think that
because
yeah you you either switch the skin that
option that added you
a specific winner
or
you
can cancel it and give all the points
back
but it really should be
an option to pick two and when there's
two or more winners
and and what it does at that point is
basically combine those options combine
all those people into a single option
and then it clicks that as the middle
name
when it does the calculation that is
not that that would be valid in this
prediction but sometimes you might have
a prediction that says will this happen
or that happen or a certain happen and
then two things happen then you have to
pick two options twitch doesn't allow
that
in that case the compromise I guess just
give all the points back
which is sad because I think the two
options should be
one supper goes well
but it I usually win the first race is
the remaining race as that goes total
that's fine that's fine I'll win
this first one the beat
thank you
so far
no problem
it is
it's a rainy version that gives the
biggest problems
my second or third place is fine yeah
I assume someone with
up to in there
prediction would say that
I think that's
that was nice
I didn't try to kill for it but
it worked out nicely
[Music]
[Music]
flying high
okay
now
what's left you've won the race
because more white than black but if
Chef saying that caused color is black
matter
okay the first place no problem
memory repair car after each race
the second race mirrored I think
we should mirror this picture
[Applause]
this is forward that mirror
huh
that's it
just to make it with voice I think that
I didn't
that's that's fine
make let me pass this car and pretend
that didn't happen
[Applause]
one car is upside down
and I had nothing to do with it
as I said
just going to pass this card it can look
like nothing happens
[Music]
huh
yeah not my fault
[Music]
okay now
now and
it was only the first is this streamline
this is no problem I can think
[Music]
I need my mind full of that yeah
[Music]
okay
it's trying to get past him
[Music]
[Music]
why do I keep falling off the trash
at that point
I'm falling off the track
[Music]
being
slap free and the other directions
I can do this
than mindful of just jumping
like that
you must get me
see now in second position
easy
never mindful here
[Music]
well that was almost I have to check
[Music]
[Music]
oh someone disappeared into the forest
just me and my car
and no other Racers to be bothered with
buttered
foreign
no pressure at all
but that was just a second race
it is four more
and now comes the trickies because now
it's wet
you should have already up with this
with boyfriend
on the second race
three two yeah last time since Saturdays
strike of the races
yep the sign still stands
I did not knock it down
thought you were supposed to
keep track of that stuff
I mean not really but
he did list it before
once only once
so now it's your duty
I guess that's another idea
some kind of
twitch function so users watching the
stream can't check the current stats
easiest of course when it came has some
twitch inspiration
or if you could there
have some Bots change the information
so information pound basically
you can expand and look at
[Music]
it
they're very amazing game for example
you can list all the tracks that will be
raised on
the current standing in points and and
things like that
oh
okay so far no problem
I would probably make a mistake at some
point
[Music]
lap three
yep
I just did the exact same mistake again
cat lips
a sign
got locked away
could have done such shutting
not me at least
I'm such a good driver I'm staying on
the road
great lap It's the final lap
yeah mistaken again I'm learning
oh no the rabbit slamming
yeah if I can
okay positions
that is the last left
two times like after that
nine
that's your best lap congratulations you
played first
I please first
got 90 points
and now
it's time for the terrible part of this
tournament
these snowy lemons
[Music]
underneath
[Music]
better than night levels
I don't know
they both seems seem very terrible and I
like Schneider
yeah
I'm still in the lead but my lead isn't
much
[Music]
[Music]
um
yeah see someone just
it takes like that
oh that was terrible for me
oh no I I got tackled
[Music]
type of thing
[Applause]
scorch
that's how I guess me I haven't stopped
anything against gorgeous ever love it
ever it's never happened
[Music]
okay fourth position that's not good
I want first position so I don't have to
do this one again
all right
okay now everybody
[Music]
do you like
watch out anyway
s just a wild one there
I don't think tells me I'm not gonna
catch up
[Music]
foreign
that just happened
oh thank you for that fun
yeah I said
these tracks are
kamasa come on
you don't have to flip away
[Music]
come on guys slow down let me catch up
track
oh this trick
[Music]
I still feel like that night levels are
better than this track
this is not a nightmare on this
well there was no connection there
[Music]
don't
want to come in last
I don't get fast which I'm obviously up
at this point
it's the one at least
it's not fast
okay fourth
no that's not good
I have to flip the car again yep that
just happened
[Music]
okay I'm sorry too fast there but
19 seconds left
nope
we'll go as the nature which is
foreign
and we get eight points I'm still in the
lead of the championship but I was 10.
drawing the whole cash
[Music]
and wonder which Chevrolet Corvettes and
I'm driving this
bonus car
nitive
come on now Pom-Pom
[Music]
s
go
I can do this
[Music]
what happened
[Applause]
[Music]
out by the way I'm painting funny
[Music]
it's mine belt
I came to drive here
in your Spaceman race
I won't see that I paid first
[Music]
I need to stop being outside the track
well not the kind of worried about this
it's the wiring form I mean
cookies is completely White
come on
okay please stop the car that would be a
wild thing today
[Music]
I see you came for something interesting
[Music]
You Found Me I mean
yeah it kind of told me that you need
something so
whoops sorry about that
it's uh slow now
there you go I hope you appreciate the
the favorite thing for you
and the design
[Music]
I love it possibly
I have it for you and everyone else too
of course
[Music]
Family secret kitten reading
all right
left three
on the third left oh no
that's what I'm wearing one is still in
second please
with that person didn't do much as long
as I can be ahead of one
fine
it's fine
[Music]
[Music]
that's that's how the music went
foreign
[Music]
there are snow tires
[Music]
there is no time
[Music]
what do you think you are
well that car went for a
quite the uh Vine
[Music]
other I just feel like this kind of
outfit is not appropriate for this kind
of weather or what do you say
that's amazing
wow are you having anything on the way
no this is this is definitely my
sportswear yes
it's totally
I don't think it's a perfect hit
okay
yeah I mean if you say so I can trust
you
I'm from getting the attention
regardless if she wins or not
okay
driving mode outside the Dragon
[Music]
you know me so well yes I do love you
you've been here
at least at some point
during every stream I made
just a stream day I mean it's probably
really like a steam moment
when it cuts out maybe let me know every
one of the places
actually
maybe they've been a message on every
single stream
[Music]
128 points
now
does this mean that I have won this
Championship already
nope
I only had 21 points in lead
that means that that the winner we get
22 points over the one coming in last
so that means if the white one comes in
first position I just can't come in last
position
[Music]
anything but last
can I do that I don't know
that's asking too much for me
this track
with this spider
[Music]
this part of the year
anyway
but I do my best but if that's what
happened
so either
I come from last position which can
happen
Wi-Fi can't come in first position
that's
kind either of those things cannot
happen
first happened at the same time I have
enough to win coming first
the most could happen
yeah yeah
but yeah there you go
yep there's one one is just see me away
and that's next part
so yeah
[Music]
[Music]
I'm not completed
the sauce wish snowman oh yeah
it's at the start he built a new one
[Music]
push campaign that's now
on second position again
and yeah
reward position in Swedish is spelled
exactly the same as in English
but it's of course not pronounced
position
but instead it is pronounced
that's that's the screen's word for the
day
I didn't think you were supposed to
drink
maybe the face was I thought you weren't
supposed to drink
first
[Music]
don't be attacking that's not necessary
[Music]
[Music]
I don't think they'll mind at work
if I'm a little bit positive
sure
at your work you kind of required to be
partner actually
no it doesn't accept it
but yes yeah if you just a bit maybe and
plus if you just have a big you probably
won't get past the anime
as long as you can perform you are
duties as required
it doesn't matter what state you're in
I mean
yeah that's probably the case
I'm learning so much about Swedish life
for me
oh
Hi man you know
the switch for posse cone is obviously
related to this team's work position
and would refer to a physical position
or something
that's what I oops oops
I'm still not lost
important it didn't feel a bit more
formal to use than word
instead
you can use this switchboard flaps which
is related to English birthplace
[Music]
just like I would say I'm in second
place
snowman is dead
[Music]
okay I'm learning so much
the English you would yeah you say
current time in third position or I mean
surface
can I mean my choice position in English
but
third I mean it's the end yeah
you wouldn't say like
foreign
actually when I think about it that's
that feels more like
okay if you have something like
a place for something to be in
as in it's it's like a it can be in some
fixed positions like uh like a lever
like a shift stick something like that
in that case you could use
equivalent to describe every location
can be
but you would argue you would apply to
position in arrays but that's not
because that that's more like an
positional race is more more an
imaginary position
like a physical position
that makes sense
[Music]
bye snowman bye
now it's near foreign
that's German for the Snowman the
[Music]
yeah yeah that's a girl
so
going to the prediction
that's the first position
first is make sure that first is correct
result yes I'm pretty sure it is
the result is first
congratulations the person he picked
first
which is Benny if I'm a mistake
yes congratulations bunny you won 1000
coins
and I have six million
this means that I can go to the showroom
take out my beautiful La Nina which is
n't that just the girl
[Music]
we have someone speaking Spanish here so
you can confirm
it's
yeah that's not how you say it speak
English
you would say it is
but this one has to be pink
right
[Music]
cost 6 million Swedish crowns
and let's do it
[Music]
let's try it out for a knockout
and then it's like oh it says dumpling
of tripling
yes I did you didn't mean to say it's
you meant to say yes
okay
I mean it is without to be a very fast
oh no not this track I didn't pay
attention it's the boots
[Music]
get out of the way
get out
get out of here
yes
[Music]
thank you for saying yes so much
that's very positive of you
I can't be behind that what's that
second
that's double A
up sound like United this is a trip no
that's that's awesome
why am I behind so no class cars
I love me

this is the first track of them all whoa
that was like trash
I had nothing

do you like the sound of the car set
family
hey acne
you want to stop selling fast
someone asked point
[Music]
I mean I kind of forgot that it was a
knockout
I actually don't have any
I just don't have to come last
the one who comes last this will be
knocked out and will be screened
which one should be fast because
Pharisees don't want to trip on
a car here
oh
goodbye
and
it looks beautiful looks weird being in
the center of the car one
it's a sports car
that's why you belong in descent
great lap congratulations you placed

didn't win the trash

and the car isn't too broke I mean I
said steering
but I can't fix the steering at least
now you just don't need to
break it too much
but it's like Lamborghini and Ferrari
and stuff so there's not a single replay
car
I'm the only one
and that's
and that's all we need
[Music]

that's so it's basically a snow figure
[Music]
that's your best lap are you happy with
that
20 seconds ahead these drivers have no
chance against this one
I don't need to repeat I mean I don't
have money that's a different scene it's
the dark track
yeah
I'm happy to make you satisfied
[Music]
that was very rude of you
[Music]
that is not okay
[Music]
okay
[Music]
[Music]
and yeah
yeah oh my um that's a different word
that would be a while back
destroying everything in my past
It's the final lap
It's the final left
it's a wild race track yeah it is
[Music]
gonna write this I'm off the back
I have the same distractions
still fresh
but they also have the high stakes race
do you think that will be bush
imagine if it was wish I can finally got
this life back together
and then
passing ruins again
well the drivers here are basically just
random names which is a shame it would
be fun if they actually had some kind of
personality
patch
and his life will be sharing the can
yeah maybe he should stop doing such
kind of music
[Music]
when he lost the first and second car
and his wife divorced him
he had to live on alimony or whatever we
call it
and then he managed to set this life
back together
again
now the picture is raining right away
which I didn't think should have killed
him when it's raining
it is clearly not raining
this is breakfast
I think this track pack for cc numbers
now he still had to pay the element why
I mean he his life really was in Ruins
sense
[Music]
and shine supports isn't that what
element is I don't know
connections
maybe separate
I mean child support
sentence
you just said the bush and it's slight
person here is
okay I've heard the start changing
you mean they have a lot of children
I mean
okay
you track yourself some years
starting on the right side of this is
supposed to be England
so
[Music]
yep a lot of children buy those
mistresses
when
[Music]
with enough time frame but that makes
him still have to pay child support
[Music]
there's none of them have become adults
yeah
Hot Shots street racing driver
congratulations
oh
ten thousand five
which he had a lot of stuff that his
initially passed from gallery
oh
hot shot either that has hot dog first
he was a hot dog sweet racing drag fish
one go
I think you should write that Pokemon
please guy
sounds like an interesting way
like in the sign
[Music]
I saw the sign and I ran out of it
[Music]
but he's making a comeback
he's cleaned up
he washed his hot dog and decided to eat
it
[Music]
in the microwave oven
and hot dog is not a euphemism for
anything else
but to clean that one as well anyway
moving on
he had his hot dog
and 82. oh
that's that's
they have two HotBox and still had a
hard one
let me see how they counted for how many
times a certain person has made
everything
I think you're the one person being the
Swedish phrase the most
you as in Oregonian
because you're the only one chatting at
the moment so
you are you
for at the moment
tomorrow it is fairies
whose life component is really I mean
this is one of me so
we might still have won that called
knockout for what I know
because all it matters is that you just
have I'm lost
if you come next to last in every single
race you will win the knockouts
just coming next to last and last
knockout means that you first
this game only has a race Knockouts I
think
that's not enough
and that's the only one that appears in
Champion in the single famous but then
there is a type that is a lab knockout
congratulations you placed first
every every when the next the last
person crosses the Phoenix line the
person in last is not bad
final race 101 okay after being
wronged by fairies pom pon has damage
there is no fairies fairies is a Miss he
never existed two
one go
is it
yeah imagining
if there's a racy comes to fairies is
there another race account we
obviously fairies only can refer to Fair
his wings and nothing else
Paris wind is known as a Paris wheel
something tells me it wasn't it was a
French man called fairies from Paris who
made the wind but that's obviously not
certain
because
sometimes it can be confusing because
Danish Pastry
in Swedish is known as a Vienna pastry
now it is called you know it's called a
Vienna bread that was cut
yeah
okay
so we have two different locations here
and in German it might have a completely
different name
some of those Germans maybe they can
pick it up what are they translating
and then you got the one which is called
the
um
which is what is called in German in
some dialects
one in others
like in
in
Berlin specifically that one is called
the pancake
and what you know as
the one where the rest of Germany would
call Pancake they would I think they
call it egg
cake or something
[Music]
but uh
the Berliner is also called the bismack
I think
from Germany
[Music]
where's kittens you can say that wow
you're so smart
[Music]
he's be right back in right he's not
back yet
I wonder what he's doing
because it's past it's like a half hour
past the end of stream I'm staying a bit
extra due to the power outage stuff in
front of me a bit
so but I have been finished after this
and the high stakes
[Music]
would be exciting
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
no
new place blessed now
I crashed I went
doesn't matter I get silver you have
been eliminated from The Knockout
competition
apparently can't get somewhere in this
you have to win it
I win
so I guess the same applies to the high
sticks
[Music]
which is four laps somebody
a big buff
anyway
yeah where's my ceiling
where is my silver
it is a bunny Stampede and there's the
schedule
same time next time tomorrow uh you got
the starting times there if you're
a location is not included
let me know in the chat or
to whisper and I can edit
but for now
I actually don't know
now I was thinking about
and the the
her but
later
I'm trying to think
Easter
I rated everyone in the Middle East so
I want to go back to La Liga because
she's nice and she's a bunny and bunnies
are the best
because she's nice
and a bunny
and candy themed and cleansing
and
just write copy this let's see
and paste it in the chat
when the rate has begun
very simple
because she will be happy to see
everyone appear
I don't have anything more to add so
thank you all for coming
and
more racing tomorrow I don't think I
will be finishing the game tomorrow
probably need another whiskey
I did I did I should finish up the game
100 as well because that's been nothing
I've done

now
yes that's all
that's the right begin
