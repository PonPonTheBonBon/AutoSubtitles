this but this is what this game would be
even worse on concept because you don't
even have the option to fix the controls
I mean I barely had the option to fix
the controls
I don't even know if 16 controls even
worked but we'll see now hi kitten the
game is hopefully about to begin
we'll see does the American control
Parts
the inverted control actually works
now to actually set the controls X yes
switch the the inverted left stick to
the direction I actually want the
holiday
[Music]
s
did you eat my mouse
no seriously
[Music]
all the controls in the game is tied
okay changing the how this thing erases
the control separated improved the game
that doesn't make any sense to me but
sure
but show
I'm not going to change controllers
while I'm playing the game but
I just wanted to correct the testing
value it is proper value
so now with the rockberry controls let's
play the game for real
[Music]
I guess now the controls should work
can't control Sports
because I have inverted X and Y this
time ahead to disable invert Y
and reverted the whole state so
another thing seems to work properly
here
that's the normal mode
I'm gonna wash the cutscenes we can skip
the cutscene unless you have forgotten
about the cutscene some bought some
weird wobbly bread
and the fish were fed over a course of
period that I couldn't keep track of
a course of period is that what we said
I don't think that's something said
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
let's eat bread and look at that latch
tap the game is running
your could do it
you always make something use your
thank you for believing in me
I was driving harder
controls are good
so what am I supposed to do now let's
look around
my secrets and eat bread and become
strong
this fish is a bit Derpy
and my typing although yeah you're right
I knew you are good if it would make
sense
it's a bit
it takes up excuse me why I
no I don't want to change language let's
check what language is made but anyway
Russian German French Italian Spanish
Brazilian Portuguese Japanese Korean
Chinese in simplified and traditional
form in English
the North Swedish no polish no
other languages
so frame rate is 30 ml streaming on
inside this is Mary
um but slowly
I guess
I probably have to lower it slightly
more I don't want it to look too ugly
it's a highly load of seven attractions
okay let's try this out
it doesn't look too ugly
it transparent the nail at least
but it doesn't look too actually it's
fantastic
what's the tear things are requested
[Music]
which is like the most important aspect
of the game
I don't know
no one got kidnapped
someone else got kidnapped
covered fish
[Music]
with the
all right that was wait the uh
dreaming at the same time of course
[Music]
so now that was the introduction to the
game
[Music]
hello again
[Music]
come on game
why is it struggling so much
why is it struggling
uh so now the controls are working the
game isn't working I guess that's the
next thing on the list
okay
I might play this game it looks really
cute
I haven't been getting cutting game
started
okay at least I don't have to go through
this for him the tutorial is pretty easy
those are these like it confirm that
everything is right it is even sale
everything okay wrong buttons yeah I
said anything
[Music]
maybe we should just jump so pictures of
these two of them it was going to strike
me so much
[Music]
thank you
so is it it works
but I can see where the bedside at least
it's the running smoothly now
but it looks good so
[Music]
I only got two watches so I guess
there's an important
but a sad starch and they will see if
people show up
and then we do
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
okay
instructional way
and loading all the textures
okay
I came from 2000
.
computer
yeah it's
attracted
is that I want to go City
a basically said it's a low
I guess is that sa SSA 37 is what maybe
they are cute okay such
okay
it seems to
nope it does not
that
it was playing fine before
okay for now
[Music]
please
on his situation
something sometimes because it sounds
fine and then oops
and then it just
it just stutters and then in this
situation
the whole game
then you have this slow Reiki yeah it
was helping the it would uh
I was hoping it would be a slightly high
performance of the game
and this puts it as unplayable
and I put it at lowest quantity settings
commented computers in this bad is
running game game doesn't even look
at that demand
I mean why is how I why do I still have
Chrome open
that explains why the game is struggling
Chrome
types of like 80 of the computer
performance
okay but in that case
we can also
I can't do it from there I do wait what
can I do it from here
ah here we go
let's give
I didn't expect it
now the game should have okay now access
Chrome now it turns please
concrete
kind of I mean it started slightly
and then I also put the game to be
allowed to have hype higher priority
oh
yes
because obviously that wouldn't break it
yeah I know I want to switch browser but
can't I give out this
I want to oh
freedom
don't worry it's opened
for now
oh I would say
I can't obviously not count down
nice
oh
[Music]
like a half made up a glass and half
past
I mean sometimes the game runs fine
sometimes the suckers I haven't gone to
petulant yes
explaining
it must though isn't it that means
nobody blew up a petrol station that
just went off like that
was
his first show it was fine
[Music]
oh no
she died
after this just died no worries
Market it seems to be something done
[Music]
she missed it thank you
let's see how beautiful that was
and I was without this much
I first dance with graphical features as
this level at this
[Music]
so
the fan is
you can see God as well
in case the spring to stop
can I
man on this
there you go
[Music]
peace all right Barbara lovely day for a
walk into it
wow
[Music]
I guess that worked
it's about to break no
wait I don't think I'm supposed to go
here
is this a secret I
think
I guess you might maybe you can take
both paths
starting to feel great
no not there
[Music]
the only suffocating
suffocating Spectrum
[Music]
now it's no longer trained
that's our fate usually spawn with a new
one
[Music]
you want flowers like that
progress
so far
no company
but now it's broken again
this looks like
[Music]
um
push out okay that was that worked it's
some outfit underneath
does this mean I have to break the glass
so I can
attract again I should be able to do
that
apparently
and I guess I have to walk and go
downstairs and hopefully it works on the
way here so soon
that's why I've done it
whoa
I did it
with just failing five times stars but
the fish is stuck the fish is still
stuck let's see
[Music]
we'll hide it in the Loft so Mom and Dad
don't find out
Happy Fish sad fish
hide it in The Lofts mom and dad who
oh yeah I said so I don't have a cursor
but that's the same I wanted to point
the map but the fish man it sticks to
the water and now all the way up here
well that's a shame
[Music]
Happy Fish sad fish
[Music]
that's it
hydrate
fish noises
oh my my voice
point point
let's see
if like it performs better
it doesn't share is showing good
progress right now
like can I
would like to set a low performance or
something
this is stuff you can
because it's
I mean
can you do that
[Music]
does it perform better now
[Music]
that's definitely been far better now
okay
and then it starts stuttering
it performs kinda by
foreign
ERS and also I just realized
um
it should be this one
no no it's not much of a difference it
says
I like to spreads why didn't I see a
singing right how many people get the
bread
[Music]
it is neat it's just a shame that my
computer is trying so much to run the
game
it doesn't run the game
[Music]
you want a cute one
it does run the game
stuttering about and I but it does
stutter less yeah
yeah but I did
change the mode of the computer too
let me see
I mean obviously there's a difference
because this is like a small studio for
the game I just started my Xbox online
you're going to you're going to complete
the game before me because it's touching
so much for me at least I get mixing
controls if I'm going to change it on
Console which obviously would perform
better than this I wouldn't be able to
handle the camera anyway so that's not
really an option anymore
all right
so this is like
like a tip over the edge and you adjust
the load
the fish died when I can't see anything
Classics game is playing one frame
open but fish died simulation
response
okay so that was I didn't even get to
keep the bread without Chef that I could
get
I like
[Music]
thank you for the applications I might
try to play the game later today
definitely would perform but
can I
put some yeah let's let's see if we can
push this down
um
something Crouch
my fault I'm just a fish
down
[Music]
and sadly I can't
well now
okay the game was actually released in
2000
21
and then they had like a six months
back
fixing yeah
and that was it
and then I come one and a half year
later
but yes
I do might
they want me to cover that thing I do
might actually be able to get a high
performance computer it's not it's not
guarantee that might be able to get some
be with my hands on something like that
this doesn't make any sense
afterwards out included laginess
it's your messaging yes pumpkin is the
best
drivers I will check the rest
but there's sometimes it's
very hard and struggling
[Music]
conversation
day
light
[Music]
okay can I like change the uh
performance
the one is someone gonna investigate the
noise caused by the ladder and they
won't help they were awake
can I change the uh
the recorded content camera type
streaming quality nothing
okay we go
you might change YouTube quicker uh
and rendering for a stream and a
conversation performance
[Music]
oh
wow
[ __ ] it that makes sense nothing bro
[Music]
oh Brett
[Music]
doesn't have to load the Deep Red eating
animation every time
foreign
[Music]
stops for two seconds
at least so what am I supposed to do now
well I guess I'll
live here now
jumping please
I mean
okay
but
it's not like I can download the edge I
think you never get out of the pool
the fish
ability right button is that really best
button for abilities I can't change it
that's that's what this game is
a bit confused about my supposedly
avoid
because through all these stutterings
and popping in for us since I have set
quality settings to lowest this is for
that no
huh
this is mid settings
everything is off
just on this one if I could turn off
these things
but I just have to play them their
resolution I'm playing like
our destination
that drink soaked so much
can't play
yeah this is the lowest resolution I can
go to update
this it doesn't do love it
sounds like a piece
let it goes smooth
I sometimes it's nice sometimes it's
listening
[Music]
oh
I got out of water
what was the point of that
that's his test
okay shouldn't I learn nothing what what
else should I go
um
because these parts was the intended
past because I got a checkpoints because
I can't go back that's not an option
I don't think that's going to happen
yeah that was a failure
[Music]
and if I continue
and I said yes
what am I supposed to do
[Music]
what am I supposed to do
[Music]
that's any
aside from the water inside the ground
but
like clipping issues aside from that
foreign
[Music]
I mean that makes sense
now there's no secrets to me
okay yes sleep fried rain and I was
learning
the next time
thank you
I think the important effect is what's
no
the fish is stuck Release Me
[Music]
Release Me
okay
that was a bad idea
I guess I just have to be careful about
the trash
because the trash is dangerous for fish
hundreds leads the oceans
yeah but it's like water treatment
oh
careful now fish
don't
get don't do anything bad
you did a bad job
did I tell you about
which is so slow
now watch out there's trash
bye
there we go oh
more dangerous
oh I almost got stabbed
yeah
progress
okay I don't like the look of this
there's a stream here
let's follow it
oh it's trash in the water
we can't go away I have to go I guess
trash then
I can't go
and
they can continue anyway
look there's more there okay let me
continue then
okay
yeah that was a horse
no I've got Spanish
it's better judging he jumps but that
was a good jump but like the wrong
direction
okay
why are you jump so terrible
shampoo
what kind of sewage area has kneels and
sweats swords
finally
so much cleaner
well upstairs
where they
put trash in the toilet I guess
when it's on the toilet paper
okay go upstairs I guess
this is the way to go
that way
that was a short end
did you end up in this one
this is my
my brother a human
do you need water
you forgot your water
huh
see look away
well be happy there's the toilet paper
now I wouldn't really practice inside
foreign
[Music]
it's in there and
who knows what's in here
just running away
no it's getting stuck now please slow
down a little
is that
is that a fish no
it's finally
out of the fish this is dying
fish farted in your service okay hi
[ __ ]
try to navigate
it's in there
get stuck again
why was a fish in my bucket
I know you killing the fish how dare you
hey
don't make me run
sorry you have to run
going
what is
good man
amazing
love
frame rate
University in these cities
what are you
important
sorry this doesn't look like a place
deficiency
so it's using poop water to wash his car
yeah that was like the dream
that's the water no it was it was the
Clean Water it was actually had been
cleaned
oh
but the bad water in the good water was
very close to each other
with some
splashing of water
and it's and what is contaminated
I'll hit that person fighting the sheen
it was just a bucket of water how much
can it weigh a few kilograms 20 maybe
no it was a small one and
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
well I'm running the game with the best
as I can
[Music]
and now it is actually oh yeah there you
go
it sucks in water here
[Applause]
yeah that's kind of nice broken
[Music]
off the fish survived
the train is supposed to drained
watching
you are a fish I am a the French lady
hello lonely nice and sunny here yeah I
wanted to try out this game because it's
actually quite interesting it's from
it's two years old and this computer is
really strong in playing the game
sometimes it runs very smoothly but
like yes it's really struggling here
hello
okay I guess it survived that
[Music]
I guess that's what they try to show
very shiny flooring here
it's very strong
[Music]
and a lot of people have these
but when they fish they swim around must
be the other fish
Bowl
[Music]
yeah
I hope you don't mind the stuff it's of
course nothing worse to play in the
Statue especially
especially when the game like freezes
for two seconds
and then your two seconds ahead in the
game without being able to see anything
[Music]
unless I'm supposed to go here
all right mostly story
yep it's like
I'm the one frame a second sometime
juicy
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
all right come on fish
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
is because they play music really loudly
I think it's safe okay
it sounds a bit hard for troll I mean
it is hard to patrol in the first place
because everything is delayed but then
you add a little frame rate to that
[Music]
nice music kind of loud they have to
speak over it
can you hear me out with the music
[Music]
I'm not even sure if I'm doing the right
thing
an artist you could move the chair so
I'm moving the chair and loud music
while the song is over
like slow motion not slow motion at the
same time
I don't see what I'm doing
I'm doing something
it's not really
man
I'm making some kind of progress so I'll
continue
well I don't think that chaos is
progress
well
there will be ants but this would
probably take me the time in the ads
place so
let's see
as for those who aren't subscribed
it's stuck again
no it seems like it's not stuck
okay not really was to the loud music
part I couldn't really hear you
now
I'm confused
the music is loud not really or
I said
no wait maybe you said I was gonna say
and then as and I said
do I need to speak louder not really
right then
what did you mean can you hear me not
really
okay I don't know
there's another music at the moment so
it's fine
two frames a second or something at the
moment
that's it
I really wonder if the low frame rate is
affecting physics
in some games do Thai physics to the
frame rate which is a stupid idea
foreign
music
no more loud music yeah the music must
be really low
am I making progress
doesn't feel like you're making a
promise I'm not sure what I'm supposed
to do I've been pushing that chair for
many times
it's not even sure if that's what I'm
supposed to do
I don't think another positive so
there's stuff here I could probably push
sorry chat today I mean that's
speaking of delay
maybe I could push the door open
even though it was
welcome back everyone I realize you can
just push the door open
I couldn't switch possibly one person
that went wrong way it wasn't function
for some reason it's like this that's
the thing is
but it should be the latest updated
[Music]
no fish
es
what's that for
isn't even doing anything
he's just riding alone
[Music]
but yeah after
after probably two hours of struggling
just to fix the controls after playing
game the computer is struggling playing
the game so
[Music]
let's check what happened
[Music]
here some random airplanes
randomly placed
that's this price of how well for
example it can run
it's probably because it's a small City
how well is Kerala like inspiring very
excited because that's without any
stuttering
Heavenly disrupts even but not like this
and this game is of course from 2016
but every like
graphically
and it's like when you say that
graphically this game looks more intense
and inspiring
do you still think the spider be sharing
maybe it's because spider look is
visually more interesting
20 seconds translate exactly can also be
on yours
okay
be on you as well if you
get everything out okay closely open the
stream
or do the changing the video quality but
I got to take customers
I basically have to go downstairs
oh hopefully
are these steps not meant to take
even supposed to go here it's extremely
steep
okay
[Music]
we
need something
damn it
nice now you're free nice and new here
do you like it here
okay I'm still yeah I'm assume I should
pick one of these and give it to you
it's like a puzzle in here
if I take that one first away I would
basically go along this path
then go to this one which I think is the
one I've intended to take
but if I take this for example this one
let's go to
one of the other ones let's see what's
happening
because I'm curious
okay I follow the passing quickly but
yes it will be one of these and then I
would just land in
but the one I'm intended to take as far
as I could see is this one
break break the fountain
fly fish supply oh no oh no
okay
[Music]
what obviously I'm supposed to land in
that one
I found it that way
yeah
clearly supposed to land in that thing
yeah
yes there we go
yeah
to come see the wild out bridge I live
over in Wellington
I've been meaning to go to yell in the
market for ages oh yeah there's this new
ever Avo proof thing
oh yeah I saw Doris eating one the other
day it has this huge Stone inside it is
okay next thing yeah we're supposed to
put stairs
maybe I should go this way
hey human can I check this there we go
thank you
now we get some speed
[Music]
yep the world's our river goes way up
onto the laws
to believe it allows our pounds on the
channel
[Music]
and also
would suspect this water being like
that water which is
good
oh wait there's something
yeah it looks like something there
if I can't get over there no
I don't keep Bang
fish inside me
don't
think that I was computer
but I will look up stuff online and see
if I can do something like
a performance
I'm stuck enough to get enough now so
this will be open now but I will
try to do something about the
performance of game shoot people just
keeping stuff I'm not even trying to
walk around do you look like down on the
ground anymore
I'm open to different opinions
[Music]
promise
it's all right
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
but
you can't
I don't want to start from the last
segment
[Music]
pretty much
it's now too much too much stop
[Music]
Charles pretty well on the maturity
well I
think a lot of stuff around someone in
this game
now I just need to rotate it
what is this by the way is this some
kind of
construction site
this game looks sofa it is
entertaining but it would be
it's it is entertaining even at low
frame itself
Hi friend oh
so as soon as something happens the
whole game stops for a moment
[Music]
well I assume this is in UK so
you have to check
do you have to check with the UK
please
I don't know what that one is called so
you have to check with that one
they clearly have other rules
okay
leading along
again
over a bridge generally
they're around the city
okay now you can
infrastructure I don't know maybe this
client with the UK
r
construction site regulations
oh no
oh no
no
fish
went out of the jar did not get hurt by
the Fall or or any shards from the jar
just runs out of water that was the
biggest profit
that's looks more like Australian name
maybe this is Australia
maybe Australia actually
foreign
it's been too fast already so
yeah you're not wrong
not the best performing game on this
computer so bear with the day stuttering
yeah
I will try to get it on my
speak
for me there we go now I got it thank
you thank you
foreign
[Music]
fish version
like you don't have
um
you don't know all your team ready games
okay
Canada to the story yeah
they're perfectly aligned with
the them ready nowhere
off the sides
but they clearly have
a different set of rooms
they they
have a set of rules that makes it
I have trouble getting through here
[Music]
just
hit
yeah it this is this is the
this is
well
[Music]
okay
I continue to the Sun
[Music]
or maybe I should continue here
just
okay
this kind of reminds me of
um
excavatories like to try
yeah
probably easy to try my next question
it's very true
wow
why why is it so advanced
Me Speak Easy
English
translator actually
that sounds cool too far towards health
and safety
have you tweaked your graphics for
better AI set everything to the nose
settings
I don't think this game is like
optimized for
I might be able to like adjust some
config fines or something to get a bit
more performance out of it
but this isn't really the anything like
the highest performance computer
Target water
the fish died
what a splash
my current job is with the
and plus there you go that's that's how
it goes okay
[Music]
okay
yeah that was sent his husband she's
done that yep that's what I have done
that's
that fish
let the fish is back yeah
I am
struggling
it's just an extra challenge this game
will be way too easy if I didn't have no
fragrance okay
after sunset yeah that's is a fun
this
yeah I mean if th is
like in there
yeah
it's like in there
things the girls thing
DH would be the voice equivalent mean
making it that
so it will be this again
that's the English of spelling
oh
that is perfected th okay
I'm I'm my job sometimes I'm the reason
for this safety meeting other times I'm
the one they asked to thumb [ __ ]
maybe stream unlike 720p stuff you know
what this is 720 what are you talking
about
yet
it shouldn't be 7 20.
and also this redeem you have used them
you have gotta like what time selects
output no wait video 720 yeah what are
you talking about season 7 20.
James game is starting 7 20. I'm
thank you
770 30 frames per second if you cut down
to 15.
but that's but this this structuring is
of course not the string it's a game
and of course I mean yeah streaming is
going to connect
even though this uh computer does have
the only graphics card what you meant to
use
oh
it seems to be passive
I must not have this to the fish because
the fish believe
it's slow gotta go faster
yeah
game was getting slow who's The Speaker
the fish has reached the ocean
[Music]
but the fish doesn't have its friends
wow
everything is funny apart yeah that
wasn't really
it is something and it was that all that
water splashing that makes it go because
like
five frames per second
the water turned into carpet
well if the fish because free the fish
is Happy the fish misses his friends
and the fish forgot about its friends
and then you have the other three in
different locations
yeah I probably have to do something
about the performance and it's also
getting late because most of my
streaming today has been struggling
and trying to get to see the settings
there by the way low low that is there's
nothing lonely though it's dirty there's
nothing other than that if I do around
the windows so I can watch
chat
I have no no other programs running in
the back connection the streaming and
the controller things I can use the
residence recontrollability
everything started off here I don't
think missing would improve performance
no I wish I could like turn off Shadows
turn off fog and well this one is turned
off so
yeah but that
there we go
that's the introduction to the game
and hopefully I can get the game to
perform better next time
otherwise I don't know
it seems yeah
because the reason why I considered the
game because obviously I didn't know how
well the game would perform the computer
it's hard to know it beforehand I could
check that stuff but considered Aspire
was performing well in the spiral I
would say is more graphically demanding
and spiral I can even set at a higher
graphical settings even
bunnies
yeah
it's my custom
transition screen
it even looks like the transition is
lagging
but that's pre-rounded it shouldn't lag
funny stampede
but yeah this game is newer
yeah so I guess this I expect people to
have better computers of course okay and
of course Spyro was developed by a white
by a
is the developer who suddenly I
might do have like
I would assume they are like a bigger
company than the developers behind that
fish game
so they are they are capable of
providing uh
more efficient
basically
but what the engine is the game running
it's in unity
and so that's that's the difference
Aspire is running in unreal
I am fish which is the fish cake it's
running in unity there might also be a
difference in performance performance
between these engines
unreal might be better at performing on
worse computers basically
got three targets
I think this game uses more resources
because of all the physics-based
movement it's possibly that but it
doesn't seem to be strong well it does
struggle a lot when it does theme
physics because the girl Game Stops
basically and goes down to one frame a
second
but it still struggles even when it
isn't running in physics
do I have no I don't have any funny rate
what did I read last time I forgot to
write that down on my playlist
oh god I've written down and I've been
waiting for a while
now
my battery is almost dead oh you don't
charge your phone it's
always been up guys I don't know play
Philip guys this
all right I'm right there no you love
ghosties
I'll call this stream is I'm following
the one when anyone is streaming at this
time
you know guys in streaming
I went I guess so
I can't wait to play The Fish game when
I get home
FM
okay well I guess we'll try
there we go there was
that was my great message
was very important for now we'll see if
it changes
and then we'll miss it
hello guys
I guess
from the right side for stream
I did my best
by the way the racing game will prove
definitely before better tomorrow
and I don't have anything to add because
I've talked too much today and the whole
day has been struggling for me and I'm
tired
so good night
I probably won't go to bed yet
a good rest Maybe
to myself
and thank you all for thanks to the
horrible stream
that's for I think that being Arabian
and kitten has been here all day through
all the struggles
are the annoyance
anyway I guess the rate the beginner
goodbye
no one is writing anything
I don't know how much delay there is
