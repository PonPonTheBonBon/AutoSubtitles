first C off the map evil
Towers
oh nice the Towes are cleaning up the
forest for
me and due to how this level is
designed we have better luck with the
uh mines this time I think the mines are
kind of
randomized which could mean that I could
have a really terrible luck as well
okay
so really clearing up this area
now please hit the
trees shouldn't been de hard to hit
him and I still have more shots
here doesn't matter if I clear them that
far
ready
anyway cleed up quite a lot I was eating
my spaghetti last night and I took two
bites of it and I was like hey this

destroying my
helicopter hello D clubs
welcome probably need to take care those
Towers
otherwise they will take care of my
helicopter sure is high density
off to
here
cuz I cannot trust any mines since last
time don't trust
mines no out of
munition what way oh wait wait a minute
I forgot this this is first time I I
very new to use to mix it up I actually
need to start it this
way forgot about that wait for it to
start
up and then I will then you get a new
chance of
redeeming broken yeah you will get to
redeem it again give me a
[Music]
moment
[Music]
there we go the Mind
whoa beinging out of
[Music]
control

land go so now if I refund that one you
should be able to redeem it
again Pon skirt is broken no it isn't my
skirt is perfectly whole and
unbroken
yay yeah the outfit changes are working
as they should know they will be AC for
15 minutes as
as the redeem
set and then it will strange back to the
dress but you can of course queue up
more of the outfit changes like the
swimsuit or more of the sport
way I don't know how much it can hold in
memory each AEM should not take that
much memor
soon
but technically there's only a limited
amount of memories can have
so giving up as much as I can why are
they so
aggressive usually they aren't shooting
this much when I'm behind a w these are
very
agressive feel like people are queing up
a lot of outfits
now right no why does it reach me very
aggressive Towers this
time now I want to shoot oh whatever
tree you get to leave this
time okay so we
have six outfits and so that's one and a
half hours
of when
then so it will be down
1742 yeah should probably
h
don't forget about the
prediction for everyone who is
here it's still
active you get to leave this time um
what did you think peaceful tank means
by but
that
guys
than after the any
am.
we go clean up
more
that L thing
somewhere we go taking care
of took a lot of
damage now we CLE off
everything please
die nothing stands in my way
three let's not waste time on
trees fun fact
okay how is hot bun doing that's not a
fact that's the
question and last Panda almost smashed
the bow on the
ground last night Panda almost smashed
the bone on the ground oh
no that sounds
bad
this level should be like shorter than
the previous swirly thing in total
distance travel I
think it's just that there's so many
towers and walls in
this Al the S level did have quite a few
walls time is almost
up
got to Tower over
here there's a
mine don't like that oh there's another
mine okay I need to send in a helicopter
here
let's clear off the
area the helicopter can in peace clear
off the
mines you know peace of mind
mine
[Music]
en
so so while
checking trailers in the yard last night
it began raining heavily pouring down
even and stuff cled on 30 seconds exas
weather I think I've seen that
before this heavy rain and then it just
stops I'm hungry wait don't you have
anything else to eat
isn't there anything for
[Music]
you I was prepared for that your Chun
Gauntlet I'm with that you Gauntlet i p
app por chop yes meat and a picture of
bread yeah didn't really answer my not
fun
fact he I wanted to switch
VI oh how is hot pun doing oh sorry
I forgot to answer your not fun
fact I'm okay cuz I've been struggling
with painting the ceiling I really hope
the paint sticks this time so that's
what I'm
doing how I'm doing and that was what
I'm
doing let's clear off these
[Music]
things
this doesn't really
[Music]
matter I AC up
some
mines
[Music]
so
yeah what is that an onion it doesn't
show up that's
thing it doesn't show off my funo pot
yeah here's some new emote and the
source I'm using apparently doesn't have
it
the S probably have it is that twitch
doesn't recognize as an emoji as switch
fault I would need to put up exception
for
those we don't really paint our ceilings
any they use the bump protection SC
instead well I
guess I guess that works
too well it has become very bumpy due to
a lot of the repainting cuz I'm
repainting parts of the ceiling where it
paint keeps cracking but it cracks less
and less so I mean I'm making
progress that is very
UNH what I'm trying to
say okay so this is where the
hey can you stop shooting me thank
you yeah keep shooting each other that
sounds like a good
idea
oh shoot
me you think around your enemy or
something okay time to move
on
they clear of some of these trees that
make sure I start I can quick
here come
on there
go can I go straighter and saving some
fuel I need to be fuel
efficient
painting ceiling what color if I may ask
this this
[Music]
white
[Music]
soup I'm shoing with clothes but this
there's only
soup wait what does clothes and soup
have in come or house has wood ceiling
and are probably treated while on the
roof
and and potentially a
factory okay this this house does not
have wooded ceiling but my parents has
that I
think where are you I'm at
soup what do you mean you are at soup
I'm at soup what store are you in I'm at
the Soup Store why are you going to the
Soup Store to find clothes
why are you buying clothes at the Soup
Store
exactly why what kind of strangeness is
that F you what
now good meme now now the chat is
getting
he
I didn't think anyone else would get
that
difference secretly R didn't understand
the reference and just played
alone oh
mine
so there's a mine
there I need to mine
that so I
can
go and I need safely escape from here so
I don't get shot
down yep they try shoot me oh so much
for safely getting out of
here
go and I guess I just need to call in
the
helicopter I'm not taking risks with Min
everywhere
then I
wonder it's clear pon pon has never been
to a soup store to buy clothes no I have
not I would admit that I have been the
clothes to B
clothes I bought a nice pink dress once
or more than
once and wer the softest part of my body
is stronger than your hardest
observe sish fart noise
I mean
um the hardest part of my body can be
kind of hard I mean now I helcopter
wait anyway moving
on Super Sonic ball crushed
what you see one punch stand
maybe yes yes talk about something
[Music]
else missed
missed there we
go a it looks at me there we go
g I'm not drun trust
[Music]
me it's just hard to fly a helicopter
when you're in toxic K I
[Music]
mean
what about NYS no I'm not sure about
that
one these
jokes comp out is going to change every
15
minutes now it assumes
it because I'm on I'm on the ring of
fire which is a ring of sand around
water so having a swimsuit is
pretty practical I
guess but wearing a swimsuit while in
the helicopter say if I need to bail out
I have a
swimsuit I think that's practical at
least no another mine I thought we had
enough with mines
but apparently
not course I don't remember the exact
location of our M so I don't know if
they are different they feel
down
these trees I do want to remove because
I want to be able to go through
here got word non pece I like the
episode with gon is that a
digimon or as he's called in a non piece
a man in a
box he's curently filming Man in the Box
too I'll add it to the watch list do you
finish off your watch list or is this an
ever expanding
list it's made by the same guy who made
the
Codman H I got a Parma Violet candle

oh that's what wrote was was one bunch
of serious of word and I was
confused where I supposed to use this
one I don't
remember I got the par CLE going it
smells great just like you
read the watch list is
94525 3631 be
long
I'm a robot I can only see
numbers I don't see the bigger numbers
they
[Music]
represent
boom easily taken care
of
[Music]
no there we go that's what I
[Music]
wanted freaking
easy
f is SL reacting wait a minute did
someone Shoot Me Maybe maybe some was
maybe I should take a
look
maybe I don't really feel like taking a
look but maybe I
[Music]
should back to tank yeah it's one of
those wax wax melts it smells just like
the sweet par
violet yeah e
chocolate I like chocolate too much I
can't help eating
it one is neat little package of fun and
sweet
maybe I have a neat little package I
mean
anyway I just um
[Music]
um
hello I'm glad you find you think that I
have fun with
weet I want s a type of Polish
cheesecake maybe want Swedish
cheesecake which is the type of Swedish
cheesecake well we call it call it
cheesecake
here but the Swedish word for
cheesecake which is just a combination
of work cheese and
cake and to not mix it up with um
what is usually considered a cheesecake
in outside of swen the foreign form of
Cheesecake is just using the English
term it's just English
cheesecake this is a neat way of
distinguishing them even it's a
bit weird to having like the
English
mine let's see what I can do
there we
go let's go and get the helicopter again
so much switching back and
forth but I need to be
care
this
yesak I want some
usak maybe it's more like you
st swiish
cake I I get
Kakak cake I would
assume from Swedish
Co not to be confused with Pon cake P
Pon
cake I spell it correctly yes you
did course um the Swedish uh the Swedish
word
tort means cake and English word
cookie
means translates
Co but then you got that in between
thing between cookie and
tort which in English is cake but in
Swedish is
[ __ ] I was supposed to get a
helicopter let's get rid of these towers
then one I'm
out they probably not going to POS that
threat
but to be on the same side I'm just
making an
assumption making an
ass um
sh
making an ass of you
and that's do
[Music]
great there it
is
[Music]
so much for trying to destroy the
trees destroying the
[Music]
trees
there's one Tower still
[Music]
alive meic
away back
tank if only they could have some roads
here I could travel a bit
faster what's with far ponon what's
what's what now what have I done music

like something for
once got the quiet music
now yeah don't think I can get the
correct

thewis you should see how she climbs
climbs on the
walls have to Cal down with
music a lonely tree ah let's get rid of
it there you go
okay let's get rid of the more
Towers okay by engaging rid of towers
you were supposed to
disappear getting of these otherwise
it's hard to get through with the
helicopter got a mine here better mind
that
okay perhaps it's safe to approach with
a helicopter now
and not having the helicopter being shot
down very sturdy helicopters
still consider how much they can get
attacked pon pon things for a
feral she less judgmental when listening
to
music but she's very judgmental when pon
pon tries to
sing yeah time to do the
helicopter oh no you wrote
helicopter you have brought shame to
yourself oh leaking the feral
p

and just getting rid
of all this trash
here just posing still I'm
[Music]
sorry I need to fly home I'm wasting too
much
fuel you see if I waste the bullets that
makes the helicopter light
[Music]
there that's still the OU works
right and if the helicopter is white
lighter it you use up less fuel when it
flies there
go I am nobody's
pet but Fon Pon is my pet
but you can lend her to take her on a
walk you on Red's
tail ha my tail is made of
scales the measuring scales as durable
as iron iron made measuring
scales refer te don't even Dent them

fine sh through red no you can't shoot
through through people's stuff that's
not
allow that's a banable offense hey you
Cheo right through that person's leg
you're banned from this
community we
go and then there was a bunch of Towers
here causing me some trouble oh no my
defense
disappeared no another
Mine mine's
everywhere well I don't switch back to
helicopter as soon as I find a mine I do
it when I've taken too much damage I
must go home and repair anyway
there we go second
mine can I reach that mine without
getting shot
that yeah this is the
corner
okay and out of bullets out of
missiles two two two mines in in the
corner there I should take care
of I need to might need to switch to
the to the other
tank wait I move more
fuel I even get down
now can even get back to the
base I don't see any R saying chewing
true lims is not allowed it's an
Unwritten
rule
Che Onan limbs what
limbs gives panda a big
steak y steak eat
steak
what
okay it looks like I might be able to
get
back doing through body parts is quite
disrespectful
yep kissing someone is
disrespectful really now I need to make
a pon pon kissing something as a as an
emote
I feel like that one's going to get a
beast someone slides into
picture with the
police evening
all so red is against an emote of ponon
kissing something next to the
[Music]
emote
and then show how I should read your
message another mind oh I I will move
out yeah I got
it no no I'm moving out I'm not going to
face off against that
the of that
youo you boat stands for underwater boat
even though it's techn not underwater
it's in the water underwater is a
strange
time cuz it's not underwater I mean it's
technically underwater but that's like
say under air when you're above
water all the water is like a
connected
solid even though water is liquid but
what you know what I'm
saying gra hand spin around head up in
the air oh
my this
tank I take it back I'm all for
p oh
my you can have like an emote of red
dragon and then P fun kiss sing next
to so long
me I was long king
bow not that's strange is not only such
other B but I like you though
gigles is the giggle pon pon
uh subscriber emote I don't remember
which subscribers should
not so long B no it's definitely so long
King B in that case but so long King
B I don't don't know how that really
I've heard that they add like an a sound
at the end of syllables that ends with a
conent maybe he says more like B in that
case it ends with
what about oh ads
ads I'm I'm scream screaming
ads for everyone who has ads who can't
hear me because they have
ads
yeah since I usually mix it up I wonder
if it has a trigger for when an starts
playing so I can set the command to be
automatic that will be kind of
convenient you
know
um I I think that be comfortable to join
the Discord you're
welcome hello silver pen one sorry for
the ads by the
way in case you have
any
let's check the
community we got any
[Music]
[Music]
come
well I guess the attack
continues hopefully I can get to that
fuel
tank so I can fuel the
tank hello hello hello as should be for
40
seconds um
you
[Music]
giggle giggle what are you giggling
at that's fine going to respect the add
add honesty yeah thank
you yeah the ads start playing like at
50 when the time is like 53 it plays the
3 Hour 3 hours 3 minute ads and then
it's no more ads for like the remaining
57
minutes
oh I think
like while 3 minutes out as is a lot for
like online video streaming or like yeah
I can understand
that but it does mean that anyone joins
after that will get like a lot of video
streaming without that which I think
there pretty
neat feel okay I'm dying
I'm definitely dying with this thing at
me there we go okay I really need to go
back need to go
back and it's really and it's kind of
frustrating that ads
plays when ad plays when a newcomer
comes in or when especially when a raid
comes and start playing
ads yeah so that's also another reason
why I have the three minute ads at a
single point during every hour because
that minimizes when ads happen when a
rate comes
randomly and
so hopefully but when it does play it's
like 3 minutes so it has a big impact
when it
happens but doing like what's like one
like 1 minute add every 20 minutes or a
half minute add every 10 minutes then
like adds one the time that would be too
much for
me anyway back to fuel tank to fuel the
tank
yes I'm kind of reaching the end of what
this tank can do where is oh no the oh
it's so far to I'm not going to be able
to do this am I
how am I supposed to re reach the fuel
tank
because since I no this a bit of this
map not full map the fuel tank is over
here if I go go down there and go there
run running out of fuel so this is going
to be very
tricky this is tricky very tricky and I
cannot enter with that yeah I don't know
how we should do
this would you like to hear I definitely
true not made of fun fact about the ubot
you you mean like in general not
specifically the one in this
game think have ad wouldn't that be
amazing in that case you get after that
you get 57 hours of no no
ads that's how it works
right sure did you boat well it's
actually called the submarine in English
I'm pretty sure but let's go with you
but was actually part of a line of both
you both me both they both he both she
both them
both that's a work that's a joke that
only wait it's not called you in English
right it's just some marines that joke
kind
of kind of doesn't work in English I
mean I I
appreciate appreciate the gway because
that's kind of
like com it's like a muling lingual joke
because it come takes the ubot name
from um from other languages that you
actually use
that combination
online together with the English pronoun
you it's
clam and I haven't oh now they
mine
it's clever clever I appreciate you
do I mean totally real facts I
say legit not made of
f
okay I need to entty with a helicopter
now
okay okay it's just that when I'm
attacking and moving around a lot to not
be like a sitting still and taking every
shot even though I do still take a lot
of ration so guess it's not working
perfectly which is taking a lot of fuel
[Music]
so I should be able to reach it it will
just be a bit
tricky lay head on p p
[Music]
SL yeah lay in pum SL that was saw a pun
opportunity and took it yeah you did
well was a great you you seized
opportunity and you did well I will
congratulate you
for your quick
thinking the German boats are known as
you boats in
English every German
boat thank you for the follow
silver pen
one or silver I can call you silver I
guess that works his name
right I'm honestly not surprised
that even those German
submarines are would be called OTS
without specifying them as German ubot
then they are just OTS even though every
German speaking country will call their
subm you boats meaning that she actually
makes it
ambigous which is the same with um the
term I don't know if I mention it on
stream but the same same with the term
Autobon which is the German word for
Motorway so instead of saying German
Motorway people choose to say um autobom
autobomb something like that
instead even though that's the name of
the Australian not Australian Austrian I
was supposed to use the helicopter
Austrian Motorway there we go and the
Swiss mway at least in ger speaking
area
so it's a weird way of doing
it it's not like the Swedish term is
used with the Swedish mod way so it's
very
inconsistent
and M way is a type
of type of Road a specific type of
H is it's also not just the British word
for
the the United States are called high
weight there are there are technical
differences what come to language with
fun
fun
what and that would be the Swedish
term obviously I'm not going to
criticize anyone doing it like saying
that they are wrong for doing
it which I think might be what people
think I'm going to do or doing or
something but I'm not I'm mean saying
that find it
silly I don't not have a problem because
I think someone have mentioned something
like uh salsa or something that like
that which is just a Spanish word for
sauce but it's not like you call every
sauce that comes from Spain salsa or
salsa or something I would see that that
would be just as weird but that's not
the case it's a specific category of
sauces that are called Salsa and that's
fine I don't have a problem with that
cuz anyone could make us
ala but not everyone can build
uh in English would be called
autoban autoban only Germany can do
it by definition if I understand it
correctly anyway helicopter time
Linguistics with P yes the Polish word
for both is
W there's also a town in Poland named
w
[Music]
w
[Music]
well and and the Polish word for
submarine
is I don't
[Music]
have
at the same time I wouldn't be surprised
if that was
like the
[Music]
word okay shoot there we
go
I'll move
on not going
to f with the
towers fing back mission
complete I think there's like a tower
here
yes that was a bit protected which would
explain why I didn't take it out
before
um moving
up there's another a town in Poland
named Ole
which later means oh a
field there are a few places in Sweden
called o just the letter
O which just means
re and there's a few places in Sweden
also known as like you
got
lulo wait
P it's more places like that it just
ends with the word rer but if I don't
think it I
don't I don't know if it's mean stream
or not or if it comes from anything
else it just happens to use that
leg turns into a cook wait I'm going to
eat eat you panda I like
cookies but my personal favorite town in
Poland his name that is very long and
Tak off the
screen I don't know how it's show up
this on screen sh cuz it's kind of cover
cuz I don't have two screens I cannot
have the like the what this shows up on
stream guess what just of the stre isn't
exactly what I
see yeah breaking the illusion is that
bit
different should be able to enter like
with the yeah
the no it looks like the M are same okay
I need to move back home now
no I'm still not able to access the
place to fill up
with more
munition anyway let's see if I can make
it
home anyway in let's see what you wrote

[Music]

be able to
access the tank with the Tank tank I
will tank up the
tank I don't think you say tank
up ah half I will from now is when pon
pon should be wearing her dress again I
think

swimsuit but will go through the dress
so you might see the dress at any point
during this
[Music]

hour
switch from the swim [ __ ] to the

go so many mins
here
oh okay the tank might die from
this no it survived so that means that I
should be able to fill up the
tank didn't need to fill it up that
much but I should be able
to now I need now I should like switch
back to the helicopter
and get rid of these mines I don't run
into
them all these
streams very
annoying
there we
go 't been count now it's 4 five minutes
yeah he had another 50 minutes how dare
you
red don't die tank you got to leave the
tank did
Survive by the great piloting of one pun
in a
SE
not f is Good Pilot is
[Music]
G
up the
time so clean
up should I remove
uh you know
what can I
reach I can't move over
here but can I still be be able to shoot
I think I could do that last
time maybe it wasn't with the tank maybe
the yeah I think the
heavy there we
go this one is able to reach a bit
longer nope it doesn't seem to reach
ly oh
well and I'm not able to skip over the
water
here cuz I really want to get rid of
these towers because these towers are
going to
be causing some issues for my helicopter
tank yeah I have a few tanks a few
helicopters so
well
let's work from down here
then now if you keep shooting me you
prevent me from mooving forward and then
I keep shooting
you should
die again need to repair the
helicopter this means that
they I only shoot a helicopter twice
with the missiles but I can replace a
one missile shot with a
bullet and it will still be
destroyed but I but I need like five
bullet shots to destroy
[Music]
power so my my initial that means that
can oh I missed one of
them
still there still means I can destroy a
few towers that
[Music]
way cleaning
up making a bit easier to through
there
yeah I really don't want to fight with
towers with my
helicopter in a pink
helicopter it's not
pink but that's a Swedish
song Alo in
Swedish and was a
helicopter a ping
[Music]
helicopter oh got someone down hand
train sh
me there we
go
there you go some
safer
oh there
we go go go
go this means that I should be able to
fly over it and just shooting
misses and a bunch of the towers should
explode let's fly down to
not draw draw their attention
whatever oh no I'm wrong
lights here we go oh I'm shooting next
to
them he know
going go
[Music]
M let me try once
more I was shooting next to the most of
the
time peaceful helicopter you already
helicopter before
so oh I'm shooting next to them
again think
ha anyway I think that's a good amount
of
destroyed
Towers I know I have being unpredictable
o i so many I was down there though
anyway
let's move
that so the towers guarding the
water now I should be able to fly
through here without any worry look at
this everything
destroyed
[Music]
hopefully I land I approach the land
would have destroyed it Towers otherwise
I have
to do some evasive
maneuvers yes here's where I wanted to
land you can say land with a
helicopter
[Music]
I mean this one is completely impossible
to
reach time to move up
[Music]
again will I spell it helicopter or
helicopter
I
mean yes that was intentional it would
been predictable if I
[Music]
birthdayman has gone
mad hello Chopper
choer hello
chapter you see that thing that appears
like I made a mistake it was completely
intentional and not a mistake trust
me I totally meant to write both varans
the
same
it totally not that I forgot to add hel
chopper as a valid wording
dictionary this
belck it's all according to
plan darn that's a good one hello chop
there and yes I've indeed gone mad night
shift does that
you but it's
day
[Music]
yeah I get what I
mean I never done an N shift
myself should probably not do
that ooh
spooky yeah ban is the not working
a
ghost there only a ghost would be I
don't like that
[Music]
mind right in the way of me bring up the
tank here filling up the
tank there you go the tank has been
filled up the tank in the tank has been
filled up using the
tank go
so many mines too many mines did you
take a bit easy with the mines
here the to from my these
things
oh no
machine my protection
broke come on Destroy sh you can do it
you
too there you go thank
you
out the munition oh no one
Stu should definitely have enough Fu to
get
home
but I can't feel that up here
slightly just to be on the safe
side I wonder if I got rid of enough to
send down another
helicopter they shift 72% water native
caffeine and
nicotine alcohol hate
I
profane whatever that
is these mines are your mines these
mines are M mines these mines are our
mines these mines are their
mines you flying rot thing nope no
flying rot
thing
we do not allow the fing rot things
here oh thank
you
[Music]
now moving down
there yeah maybe I can't move in with
the helicopter
now iine is an anti-inflammatory use for
easy musle
[Music]
pains
okay
what's muscle
pain H is what keeps me stable when I
get M greams oh okay in that case
actually
[Music]
sounds yeah try
of I cannot
like I mean yeah
it's Val
[Music]
then sounds like a very
Val okay looks like I cleared off every
mind not that I'm to judge but yeah
so obviously
not
but alcohol is more effective at that v
c my drink of
choice I don't drink
alcohol disclaim I do not recommend
drinking nope you should only eat no
drink OB this
joke
I prefer rum or Jagger
Meister back to
tank I am in search of a Quantum flag
for none not familiar with the
game like for example silver pain pain
pen not
pain silver pen is new here and might or
might not be familiar with the
game my goal is to find the green base
green
flag and it's in one of these green
buildings I said it is a Quantum flag
and the position of this Quantum flag
depends on which buildings I
check it usually appears in one of the
latter buildings usually the last
building I
check um if there's a lower number of
buildings but it is a very high number
of buildings it does start appearing a
bit
earlier
that's why I am not going to check these
early buildings if they I will actually
check the last building first but I have
to work myself my way all over there
first and then if it's in that
[Music]
building then well it's not going to be
in that building and then I will destroy
every flag building that it gets closer
and closer to my base
maybe I should destroy the next to last
building first maybe you
know could destroy like the oh no not
where do you come from I forgot to check
my radar for incoming
enemies he there the bom is
again I just forgot to check a
it
go no another
one now then it really matters
okay cuz it's not because even if I
destroyed it next to last one first it's
still going to be the first building I
destroy it's not going to be in that
building
anyway regardless
so okay I'm approaching the next corner
I
think what
so I will fill up my
tank
not that's definitely
enough
and then just move back home
again to fill up with more
bullets that's the current annoying
part I don't have enough
bullets and I was to play I could get
more but they had place a mine in front
of
me oh r i get weird dreams after few
shot of R especially 151
proof 75 and
half% is proof
anyway percentage seems to be the most
recent on SC to
[Music]
use well I haven't been um while I'm not
drinking everything here is basically
percentage I don't think I've seen
anything on
percentage so where's
the yeah I'm definitely closing in on
the corner
there where the next flag building
is MHM I had some of that polish about
think it
called
spirus
spus and going de KI on your ass and
keep you there for a
day
well certainly will do that to
me
[Music]
okay back to Wars at least this isn't at
least I don't have to travel as far to
the area to attack as the the one of the
previous
levels oh my that level was
something that one level was sure was
something they don't using up that much
field to
go all this
way yeah there it
comes here comes the
thing now I'm shooting
you come
on
finally to
shoots
okay
what my
shield
well is a m
day does that mean I have
to
have the way here so I can get through
easier I probably don't have to fill up
the
tank should have
enough did have enough at this
[Music]
point
not the most exciting
map it was kind of this part I was
afraid of I actually didn't know this
was going to be we can talk
about talking about funny
stuff I like cute
bunnies like outfit ideas for
p
[Music]
as I got that on my Discord server at a
thread for where you can post outfit
atas that I will add to pon
pon for um the 3 mod I
make I will make a dress the sport where
and the swimsuit as the first
outfit yeah I'm definitely closing in
that the next flag
place and then after that I will do
whatever other outfits I feel like
doing
oh just
thisy and there's already quite a few
suggestions on
that and I basically just do it like
from the one I want most and work my way
down since I mean oh there we go
switched to the final 15 minutes of have
changes
I can probably just disable the
animations so hopefully it doesn't need
[Music]
that but there are plenty more to go on
this level it's only been almost 2 hours
streaming 1 hour 43 minutes so
far
and I choping
vodka everyone at Works thinks I'm crazy
for drinking straight vodka yeah you are
crazy and I don't even drink
[Music]
Vodka Here Comes daning
oops wrong
button we
go they count that much
EAS
okay so let you deal with it
son
there we go
that's oh
okay don't like these
[Music]
mes I need to bring the helicopter
here there's a bit many towers around
here making it a bit tricky like there's
a tower
here let's see and Tower
here it can I reach this tower that
short tries to reach me
though I definitely should be able to
reach it in that
case
[Music]
okay I should have enough heuel to get
home
but
yeah no flying ring
good so
anyway as I T say I'll do the outfit in
the order I want to have them me but I
could do an outf someone else once I
mean if they pay me for
it and then I will prioritize that after
of
course and then I can do basically any
outfit you want it has to follow of
course the
twitch
[Music]
rules and presumably the same rules that
applies to human when it comes to
exposure and obviously it cannot be an
outfit objetive but that that
information will be provided first if I
will approve the outfit before any form
of payment would be
[Music]
made my start I should probably do a
proper list of actual the actual outfits
I do so people can see if I missed
anything I tried to make a list but then
I kind of didn't update it
anymore okay how is it yeah I should be
able to fly hopefully so Diagon and
reach that
part we'll see we'll see how much I mess
up I'm actually doing great progress on
this map
hello Towers don't mind me as I'm flying
through
here what isn't that
bad I think it sounds
bad I don't drink alcoholic bages
because I don't like taste I don't like
this
smell I don't like the idea of getting
drunk either
so okay I much to get here now let's
see no that wasn't the mine there we
go oh Tower is
alive how dare you won't be alive
this peaceful helicopter does not
approve
offive
[Music]
Towers anyway time to fly
back sing for the f b b at one point he
does not
approve who is in
different
he prefers listening to
professionals and as you can see on the
ra the helicopter plus plus means a
flying
thing
and it isn't
really so the the r is just a portion of
the
[Music]
actual let's
see
so the helicopter trated just this
map
uh which this map does show the
helicopter on it I just cannot see that
map and the helicopter at the same time
but you can do that in
multiplayer and then it just cuts out
where the helicopter is but it doesn't
do it accurately so you can see that the
the dot for the helicopter moves bit to
the side ever so
often depending on how you fly cuz it's
not accurate and the same thing about
this map you can see the Red Square
which means a land vehicle does
shake and that's because it
uh it moves the maps first and then it
updates position of the
square oh
like the function it uses to determine
what part of the map to show and what
part the map the tank is located in are
different from each
other slightly slightly different from
each
other which also proves that the dot is
not just put placed onto the map in
dependent of the actual location of the
tank
anyway ning about te
technical
things about this game over let's
see on buom Bon what I'm not a bum what
are you talking
[Music]
about does not approve that's her calm
face she looks
disapproving
boom SN I missed the
M
sniper
intent
oh
P oh no
double now she's going
to now they're shooting down my
protection my protection broke again
This Ain't
Good okay
I touch it that building
oops I when it was empty
anyway
when I used up all my health in this
tank
though I'm use up
the a bunch of the shot remaining
munition
here and make
a clear path to travel through it's
easier to go around that corner there a
little lot of junk
here that was a nice 57
minutes yeah it's been 57
[Music]
minutes
it's F flag
ahe
a bit weird because I moved away from it
it's F singing FL
there I I would use that you know there
because it's like over there it's not
where I
am you know I don't know it's not like
I'm in the building I'm like away from
the
building o
oh
Netherlands look at that carrot is very
very
long you can you how many can you do I
don't remember 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 is eight
Max I think I allow like 8 10 I don't
remember 10 emotes before it splits into
two
rows but that is a very big
car
so yeah I got three places
left well I guess I'll just continue or
should I take
[Music]
this I did lunch was better with y's
company I'm happy I'm happy to hear that
I wrote it while you were still over
there yeah but I mean I mean like this
is a tank it's just R distance I
mean anyway anyway doesn't matter I mean
it's
correct I guess if you're talking about
over the radio to someone else and it's
like yeah there's no play here I guess
that makes sense to be fair you're
right hello 10 emotes in one row 11 was
10 on one row 11 start the next row yeah
other it gets kind of
tiny of course with 11 they could become
big again but I don't
[Music]
know they are made so you can they are a
single one is made the largest and it
can like two when it's three it scales
it down to a by a nice Factor so it
doesn't become like
weird
and then it lets you put like as many as
you can for every time it skills
down before down the next TR is back
whoa pink pon pon is wearing pink
again that's
the oh no and and her pink bow because
the bow changes color alongside the
out
was like sounds like she was naked
before but she wasn't she was just not
we she was not wearing the dress which
still sound she was naked
before
Oh kind of forgot about this
thing boom
sniped yeah she was wearing different
outfits and now she's wearing the dress
again
because with the automatic outfit
changing it's kind of
like when I I'm manually changing I I it
was like I CH was changing my outfit but
now it's automatic the outfit is like
magically changing outside my
controller uh so I don't know if this
one it changes I guess you could see
that as just being a pict too I guess
we are
seeing with magic outf
changes I'm trying to shoot the tower
but apparently tricky I
thought okay I took a lot of damage from
that oh no swi
it I have has
changed
and the magic changes my outfits and and
I don't feel anything just it's just
different unless I I look at myself and
see that my outfit is
different but
with that power don't misuse
[Music]
it I know I I was ref feeling for too
[Music]
long now we just need
to no where are you
going we need to go back to the base
oh now it's chasing
me
oh it's
swiit I now it
isn't definitely
not
it would be a b
direct p p you're going to complete it
in the next 20 minutes
please hopefully someone is the winner I
don't want no one to be a
winner no yeah the Tank
died where is the next place where I can
fill up with bullets or something that
would be very
convenient I need a such a
location I only know about that one from
previous attempt when I fa fail the
level I don't think I will complete this
in 20 minutes I'm
sorry it only takes time to reach the
part and need attack and
then and then those towers are very
annoying well class time I got to go
bye-bye still
thank you for stopping
[Music]
by thank you for surviving the heads
too have a great day everyone have a
great day
s hope your day at class Works goes
well come on I'm shooting
it why isn't it counting it does does
help clear out
the didn't we going find
any yeah there we
go
no I didn't mean to I destroyed my own
protection but it was very weak and easy
to
destroy no
throwing my protection again we are your
Tower is so
evil I need somewhere to
hide okay I'm making good
progress oh destroy the tower I need to
get out of
here I need to get out out of
here okay this time I'm going save some
bullets
K flying R thing I tried while I
couldn't because I didn't have anything
to kill it
me okay I mean the late this one I did
Kill I'm going to kill this one to there
we
go we
will we win if she finishes the level
between 30 minutes and an hour from now
20 minutes and she and we
TN
oh red was
misting yeah I've been going at this
level for
um 2 hours now I
[Music]
think I have checked and it does count
the time in the base I don't think it
should but it
[Music]
does then that does mean that there's at
least three more outfit changes that can
be redeemed that fits in with the
remaining for to five minutes of the
stream but I mean it really depends on
how much extra I do I probably should
not go for another level after this
unless it's clear that it will be a
short level but it will be the last
World so what is a short level in the
last
World so
yeah yeah yeah there must be
uh okay here's what I'm
thinking I'm still I'm planning things
out there's either
something here or there another way to
fill up the tank and I really need to
get
that wow is the
question
okay actually
actually let me at least take one of
these because I have not used any of
these actually I did start up level but
I have not used it
since and
uh and I'm probably not going to use it
more cuz it's so
slow but it does have a lot of armor so
maybe I can be really aggressive with it
and
and get a lot of done very
quickly is what I'm
thinking we'll see it's not too slow but
the level isn't too long we'll see if
we'll see if I can even reach is the
first place to fill up the
tank this will probably be the longest
map I've ever done so
far
espe people only voted for
like right now this like only has 30-
minute span that there will be winners
within every other span they will be
just points will be
returned so I do hope you you people are
ring it does fill up the tank
[Music]
quickly
takes a long so the whole song had
played out in full before I reach the
first place to
shoot
a day for a
stroll here we
go
okay there's another set of this kind of
wall
here no where's where are you coming
from kind of busy here excuse
me
going didn't feel like going back all
the way
anyway wait that heav
thing I did some damage
but I was hoping it could do
more
no
[Music]
in me this back did I miss sensing yes
when the heavy armored vehicle try to
get through the base but
IED but it destroy plenty of poers not
too many I was hoping for more
but but since it's so heavy and so slow
it wasn't really worse much so I
wouldn't say I was a big
loss I didn't not lose any of the
lightweight tanks I mean except for that
one a while back but you were here
[Music]
then boom
sniped
y a Havey vehicle night
woo
don't
okay I'm taking more damage but missing
so much when I try to shoot them but
no probably has to shoot them straight
on without too much messing
around
D tank
TR there's a mine out there no
Drive
clear out this
chunk
[Music]
so
[Music]
flyinging die yay T color
treat need so much
damage I wonder if I can like go
around I guess that's kind of what I'm
trying to do I me it's how it shoots
[Music]
but because I have the
uh oh know I know base
there I really hope this place to fuel
up yeah I cannot approach with a
helicopter they're kind of useless takes
too long to drive with a heavy vehicle
and so
on cuz all I need to do is reach the
final uh flag building and just destroy
the building and then
Retreat shouldn't
like destroy
everything
[Music]
well let see how when that
goes cuz I'm going out un like the out
side of theing the West Side so I'm only
really need to focus on destroying
the the towers that can actually reach
me I don't need to destroy every single
Tower
even though I basically destroyed every
single
[Music]
Tower
there you go fin me not the successful
as my other
attempts
and then I just sneak through
here and then
I go L all of
this I just don't engage with one of
these
I
can oh
no didn't mean to do
that let's undo yeah here we go there's
another place to fuel
up nice
nice
but me Panda
eny got a star now I need to bring the
helicopter here oh Retreat Retreat
retreat
Retreat get rid of this
thing need to
[Music]
retreat I have all junk
[Music]
anyway I got enough junk
already
popcorn for pound
pwn I see this Spar is Red's favorite it
would be nice do like statistics which
outfit has been redeemed by which
people
obviously a person might choose to not
redeem a certain outfit if it's already
been redeemed that day or currently
active or something which would
influence
the the results so maybe not necessary
to do such
Tes
so I did find the other
place there's so many mines there so I
want to bring in the helicopter but
there's still too many Towers I need to
clear out the towers
[Music]
first maybe you should end the for p
regular Dr it can be c as
well I mean yeah technically I
could but like if if you queue in P's
regular dress and
then yeah
but p Dr is also an outfit if but if no
outfit is in Q she's not wearing
anything and it's only in her under way
wait a minute why would anyone redeem an
upit in that
case fun is waiting there for someone to
demon
outfit
so h I might actually be able to fly in
with the
helicopter P Al
ising is redeeming a bunch of
[Music]
swimsuits I forgot to
change that
mtic oh
no apparently I don't know how to
reverse a
helicopter okay could you power stop
shooting me so
much is that too much to ask
for I need to go back and repair my
helicopter thank you very
much if no outfit p p would have box
stress box press or or like a yeah you
mean like cardboard box it holds up
just he inside a cardboard box she
doesn't have anything close to
we she still has underwear you know
Rocket
Man coming in from the SPAC ship welcome
Rocket Man how is this how is your
spaceship holding up
[Music]
by it or
[Music]
bit oh now I need to FL back and repair
yeah I can of approach the wrong place
that was a lot of Pary I should not end
today yep or two cardboard boxes on top
of each other like a cardboard box
around her chest and and another one
first down she still see she still get p
tamy as you like
oh probably
not do that with
[Music]
B spaceship has been the better days has
seen better days need to take it to the
auto shop
yeah I take a bit too far up I need F
down yeah
how I guess you will be known as a
regular there it's not every day someone
comes in with a spaceship to be
[Music]
repaired do you you're well known by
those
people when you come in oh look than
comes that comes Rocket Man rocket sheep
[Music]
again yeah I need to go further
down hey why are you ignoring
me oh
there we
go might bother messing around with
Rockies if I he it
once no You' have one box for top and
one beneath it unless some
one te outfit I'm not exactly sure what
they mean I thinking like yeah a small
box around her
chest and a small box around her legs or
hips rather more like
that just like a sport spray
[Music]
outfit that seems like something fun
[Music]
for hello rocket man says Oran so if
you're half man half rocket you go to
the hospital and mechanic I mean
obviously it depends on what path of
Rocket Man is dep part need to be looked
after
see depends on what part of me needing
some see that's what I'm mean plus
obvious come
on think up it like a dress but made of
two okay so like a more tighter box of
upper body and then like a loose white
box working as the skirt or something
probably not
the best way to describe it but it's I
wa oh really
[Music]
strong
okay that could come
back
is it like the merid situation so if the
top half is rocket or the man a bit
different my left side is human the
right side is a rocket or
AER
resit kit that's what's
[Music]
[Music]
called
you
man
man okay
um one more try
is
well so do you like give people rides
oh now he that a private
[Music]
question
oh stop shooting me thank
you my goal is to destroy the mines I'm
not doing great progress on
[Music]
that are rocket right
yes
keep people
[Music]
r i mean if peral pon pon was a big
bunny I guess you could write on
[Music]
her I got a secret I've been hiding
under the my skin I was going to read
that as under my skirt and which would
be true
because even the ponon has kind of shown
it off before it's kind of still kind of
secret on her
skirt I guess you could say that I got
kind of a secret under my
skir
Bo my heart is human my blood is boiling
my brain I BM so if you see me acting
straight strangely don't be surprised
I'm just that rocket man who needs
someone oh Rocket Man needs
[Music]
someone no oh destroy the armored thing
only not even a single
mine not a single
[Music]
mine
well I shot it tree come on let me no
well I guess I
did I guess I managed to do what I sort
out to do but I'm still destroying the
armor place so
I H I mean it was not going to survive
the mines anyway and I couldn't access
it due to the mines I mean it was it was
a lost
anyway I need someone and somewhere to
hide to keep me alive to keep me alive
somewhere to hide to keep me alive I
mean Rocket Man is kind of hiding in
space I guess you could say because you
cannot see something if unless me there
is the Suns I guess you will be seeing
but most people can't see
him mean if he's like mansiz but half
rocket you wouldn't really be able to
spot
him I mean yeah except if you have a
telescope but I
mean he he knows those people he's good
friends with
them riding has two meanings thank you
for letting me know
[Music]
Di and my skirt

sniped under my
skir and P P pun SC their
height some panties
which you will be able to see if you
play the pon pon mod for crash
for her panties will show kind of a lot
when she moves around due to all the
kind of different Mo
moves it just is it is what it
is
uh cleared out area how
nice these Stone
but I can take this out
quickly
that there still that
one oh I destroyed the wall not the
towers
[Music]
M come
on come on
on and think this
went quite well I would
say there's a tower
there the tower
survived maybe I
should
possibly be able to get rid of those
towers with a helicopter because they
are like individual
Towers is one towers are together that
think
CA their real threat to the
helicopter here SW yes it's what it
didn't
need indeed went very well took out some
towers and tanks Sur yes it's all we
want it's all we want if I didn't like
get rid of towers
then and the tank gets destroyed as
well that would be
ter
there we
[Music]
go
has switch to swim
[Music]
seat but hopefully I'm done with this
level soon I actually don't know how
much left it
is this whole stream is going to be a
single single level it's going to end
with being at over a three hour stream
for a single level and then no one's
going to be the winner and the whole
prediction thing is going to be
refunded
[Music]
okay I said let me take the
helicopter yeah was a
[Music]
helicopter
Miss there you go no one lik that one

just flying with the helicopter and
destroy it let me try I mean if I lose
the helicopter well in that case I go
there with
my but if I manage to playing with the
helicopter one
good so step
one target practice I will destroy the
towers here on the edge
first
on I'm starting off and
okay than you
[Music]
home did not go well I kept my
helicopter
so PTSD intensifi do I go back to that
game
sometime having some stream there when I
go back to games I got stuck on and left
crash bash spiral ice of
season so I can complete them so I don't
have and C3 racing as well so I don't
have incomplete games in my I played as
I kep track which games I played and
which I've
[Music]
completed come on
no this ain't good here we go I should
not do that that was a bad
[Music]
idea one Tower destroyed and hel leave
good run exactly but least destroy
one so yeah yeah I'm I'm at the right
ads at least I'm in the base now so I
can write this easily
so Galaxy Speedway yeah Rocket Man what
do you have to say about Galaxy Speedway
Inspire season of
ice
tested this speit level is near
impossible to beat even on easy mode
perfect let's keep
it maybe this was more
like so every level has been tested
except uh well wait it's like okay we
complet the game every level tested and
game is ready to be shipped and then
something like wait we forgot to make
this the final Speedway ah let throw
something to together as quick as you
can we sadly we don't have time to test
it but with your experience and
knowledge of the other Speedway this
should be EAS for you to
do without any issue we don't have to
worry about this
thing never heard of it well sounds like
you should go back and check my vs when
I'm playing seon of
ice I maybe shouldn't go back and check
my so when I was playing season because
it's it wasn't a good time I mean the
game was still fun to play even it was a
terrible game same same with like SPID
of fusion or SPID orange as some people
call it like it's that terrible game
but was still kind of fun to
play
well
okay there we go so all I now need to do
is get one rocket to land on that
building that's my challenge at the
moment or you know Kam the helicopter
but I watch you play it just didn't know
that was the name of it okay it's the
last it's the last Speedway the one I
didn't
complete that's the
one and since it's G
wait it was not called Galaxy Speedway
what's called space AG Speedway what are
you talking about
mean
[Music]
come on yay I got one
ex okay now I manag to get out of there
oh
no oh no bullet h of a
sudden what do you mean complete you
complete you just didn't remember well I
certainly did not remember a level
called Galaxy
Speedway but I destroyed the
building so many missiles too many
missiles so now I only the need to
destroy remaining
buildings starting with the last
one
I think my aiming with the helicopter is
improving cuz in the if I'm not mistaken
there was the first rocket that hit the
building I did shoot two rockets so the
second rocket hit the tower behind the
building but the first hit the
building satisfied with that that's why
I'm bragging about my aiming
skins two more days and then I'm on
vacation cool story
bro no well I'm glad to hear that I hope
you have a good
vacation what will you do on your
vacation
giggle giggle you want to gigg gigg like
P
P Watch streams who are you going to
watch who are you watching if
[Music]
it's boom missed it boom boom
there we go hit some
trees hit some
trees yeah so like
watch what streams are they
watching what
CH polish streamers like
K
yeah I do prefer raing you know
English speaking
streamers I did I mean sure I did raid
uh ranion who speaks Italian but she is
fully I think I destroyed the building
up here yeah definitely
did just going to check just yeah that's
the last building up there just making
sure but yeah yeah I said R Rion is
fully willing to speak
English and if you speak English you
does speak a bunch of
Italian why is the flag in this building
of all the
buildings well that was weird all my
talk about
flag appear in the last building found
and then this CH
B
well we see if I can get
Canon
so mine
than well I guess I'll travel
home why think someone other than pon
pon
B
well
red I think I've seen you on other
streams
so to be fair if pon pon stream 24/7 and
I have no reason to watch other
streamers will you support me to stream
24/7 that would include me having oh I
hit it I'm surprised n should do
that that would be including a stream of
me going to bed as well I put up a
camera in my bedroom and then tell me
like cing into bed hugging my
plushy no no tank got poked in the
behind by a red
missile the red missile tried to
penetrate the armor but it failed
the
the my tank had protection and it
worked no that was an imposter red
dragon oh it wasn't red dragon
6969 must SP being someone like Dre
Dragon
6969 easily confusable or like 698
69
69 oh as a letter
69 some some
options pon pon pet stream would you
watch a pon pon pet
stream watching ponon in her sleep 69 69
69 69 yes watching me stream stream
watching a stream of pon pon going to
bed brushing my
teeth probably in the other
way H not changing into my KN gown
that's not going to be part of this
stream that will be off camera okay but
I will have the night gown on camera
when I go to
bed while I could travel across the
water um there's a risk that I would
should be shot by the towers the to be
safe I'll go
around
[Music]
maybe I'm going to watch a pon pon
cooking pancake
stream I mean it would be a 24 hours
24/7 stream I I stream for
constantly I said it won't include me
going to the
bathroom changing I guess I guess that
would be the only thing trying to think
is and the I would I wouldn't show on
stream I don't
know and then like having camera set up
so and then with the phone changing
which camera is shown on the
stream so you can follow me around as I
walk around the house still sounds like
a fun
stream be very different from my usual
streams I
know too much stuff in the way too much
garbage there it
is
okay I did use more than half the tank
so I did do have the
tank and it's not going
great yeah going to fill the tank or
something that should certainly be more
than enough and if
uh flying root thing comes I guess I'll
just have to trick it around BL flag
closer to the base
so but there doesn't seem to be any
flying Ro things so I'm
[Music]
safe maybe I should have brought in that
flying R thing let just make make it
someone up here just to make it more
[Music]
exciting cooking with pon pon would be
fun to watch even if it's only on
Discord and not twitch I mean if I was
to set up everything to stream me
cooking I would do it on
Twitch too much stuff in the way I have
to go around so much
stuff three flag buildings left to
destroy and it appeared and there wasn't
even many flag buildings on this level
this level can of broke the whole thing
about which building contains the
flag it has been a consistent rude it's
always the last building unless there's
like more than like 10 or
something then it's like or like seven
or more then it's like in the second to
last most
often but this one barely contain any
flag bu like six maybe contain
seven where it wasn't like this third
that makes no sense the only way it
makes sense is if it's completely random
but it isn't completely random but so
many levels I played in and it always
has appeared in the last building I
destroyed regardless which order I
destroyed them
me it is not
random unless unless it is that very
very I did not fill up the tank plane I
just enough to
[Music]
jump okay what's the time did anyone
win spent this long time and no winner
that would
be and same video let's keep video we
done
we only need the winning
time 3
hours did anyone
win no one voted for 3 hours there are
no winners everyone is a
loser you all lost you failed and this
was the longest map ever a whole stream
on a single
map C
crazy
crazy that is
crazy
well you know what that means refund
time know winners maybe me and might
fight yeah know winners we are losers
one point is willly woner what I'll
stream for one level and no one
one one 11,1 point going back to
people if I could have more than like 11
options I could do do like a lot of um
options to pick from and then the and
then the closest time is the winner or
something like
that but is I can only have 10 options
which still is a lot but
but guess that like 2 hours Zer minutes
and like 2 hours 10 20 30 40 50 yeah
actually that could work and which every
option is the closest wi problem is that
two options no the likelihood for two
options to be equally as close is not
likely it's very not likely due to DK
measuring seconds
for that for that random moment no one
will
win because not a winner can be deter no
because it should always be a winner
because zero
to no 30 exactly between Z and
60 I'm too tired to think
anyway yeah because start yeah
whatever let's switch
SC it
is soon H
summertime over in Europe
so in United States and
Canada the streaming is going to be one
later by 1 hour for one week until
United States and Canada goes back to
not using
summertime
in other places around the world which
doesn't even use summertime in the first
place it will just be 1 hour
later in Australia it has to be
completely
reworked and
Australia
know I wish I could set it up to
automatic or
something should we visit
Benny Benny is doing Tomb Raider one
it actually says Tomb Raider
[Music]
one for me at
least what is he doing and also I do
have socials so I don'tget about
it and the line you said you get nothing
you good they
say was the one like I said in the first
CH but I didn't say that
I think I
said you are you you all lose you get
nothing maybe okay
maybe I don't remember what I
[Music]
said Batman is raing raing streaming two
raider one unfinished business sow low
snow meds as it's called basically if he
dies he loses the
game and he's and uh that means
basically no loads you cannot save and
load the
game so if you die the game is over
because the
game I think the game is kind of weird
in that if you die the game
doesn't you don't get a correct me if
I'm wrong in in Tomb range one you don't
get a game over if you die the game just
continues but Laura is just dead and you
can't controller anymore so you have to
load and hence no loads therefore you
die and you cannot Contin
game instead of calling you down no
deaths around or something and of course
no meds would be no healing anyway where
was
I I was supposed to rate Benny I should
execute the command jate
Benny H message I don't have any
like if you if you don't want to do
something like and my chat are
completely Frozen for some
reason at least I
can
cut if you have like and then look 3
hours on one map no nah
let game on I can I can tell him how
well it went on my M my game
play po sounding back yeah something
when I like open up H the browser to do
the finding a streamer and finding a r
Target and stuff it's it's acting weird
