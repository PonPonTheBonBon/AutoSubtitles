a few seconds and
so
he says that I have five years already
and he she didn't have this many when I
started new stream it's usually like
zero one or two
people
so
today
[Music]
I feel like making
a new outfit
for Compton
today I'm going to do something I've
never done before
because otherwise I already have made it
and don't need to do it again
so I was thinking about making the
other swimsuit
and he's preparing for it
[Music]
and let me just check what the
name of the
folder
which I'm doing
let's see this this should be the
artist
popcorn what can it be called actually
uh painter that's the one it's called
the artist in the game
and here's called painter
and I was thinking about making it to
the bikini
and you started before the time he hits
here so caught me over here
so you didn't remember to put the feral
Bunny at the start
uh-huh
I'm so
Delhi
exactly
I mean you can write the message again
if you want
it is fine
so one of the things I want to do is I
want to
because
it was not too naughty for twitch
so I wanted like
like
the idea was for they begin to be like
yeah this kind of triangle bikini which
isn't too uncommon
so I want to uh
try try to shape
because currently it goes across like
this yes
it's meant to represent the fabric for
the closing too that just goes across
because that how it works even though
video games often like makes it go
around the breasts like the clothing is
glued onto the body which doesn't make
any sense
if we're going towards yay
so I will probably just
extract this part
foreign
large enough area
[Music]
something like that
separate and then I can delete half of
this
I like that
like that and then I can apply mirror
I like that
now that means that I can edit one side
and other side will copy
[Music]
so
[Music]
[Music]
try to sink because every birth star
kinda small
when I was imagining how I would do this
I didn't remember her breast being this
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
that's not the closest one
sometimes time is broken
so it comes like
in like this
[Music]
so maybe maybe if I just where the bunny
[Music]
yes I am looking at the rest at the
moment
but I am modeling
her breasts
that kind of kind of is kind of the
awkward part of modeling like modeling
crotch breasts
but
[Music]
just what you have to do sometimes
[Music]
so can I reference
Focus chest plus cocoa
basically don't uh but her whole body is
small is it's a card professor
like she's completely on the inside
she's so much things
[Music]
not
foreign
but maybe I can
but remember how much I enlarged me
[Music]
next I can launch it unevenly
[Music]
fair enough to make sense
[Music]
yes Orange
[Music]
even though it sounds like you you see
aurum
[Music]
I'll never get
understand English speakers pronouncing
things already
I guess it just comes with being an
English speaker
Anthony practice
like learning a different language
[Music]
so what do we have now swimsuit I am I'm
working a swimsuits
it seems appropriate
so
[Music]
yeah definitely thinking about this
unevenly
let us sink it manage that much
as long as I get it's like
and I think I found I went
[Music]
so that should give me an idea
[Music]
I'm working in the beginning
yes because
people who make clothes
dress all day
the type of clothes they're making
of course
[Music]
like as I see oh no that's all that
maybe it's easier to see me
Shades flat
[Music]
maybe I should suit Divine things as
well
and then I can
turn these back together
[Music]
but it's gone
but this one doesn't have to remember
but this one will be my
[Music]
[Music]
Chinese putting the correct direction
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
and I guess this way it moves like this
could also be considered how it how the
clothes go down
as I kind of model her breast based on
when she's wearing clothes
because that's how
a restaurant normally going to be seen
if I do more like this
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
s like that
I don't know maybe that was a bit too
much
maybe this kid
of course not easy to see because it's
completely bright here
okay look at her breasts from different
angles
yep
I mean
that's what would exist
like is this good
oh thank you
my breasts are completely exposed
moving on its furnace
and now it's when someone should read
[Music]
and there we go I think
[Music]
I think that's that this is what I'm
looking for
I think
right
of course it's very hard to see like
this
but yeah
there's there's
it has more shape of breast now
I take feedback
but I also reserve the right to reject
feedback
this is
you should make your breast speaker
which of course no one has suggested yet
but that has been a thing like when I
say like
this is the thing I do I take criticism
and I like
nah I don't like I don't want to
criticize
you know that is some something like
it would have been nice to criticize
your work or something like that and
like
letting me have something that looks bad
is why and you I mean it's not your
responsibility of course but I mean it's
nice to let me know that something looks
bad so I can fix it
and then let me have the that's it it's
bad
but um
when they do give feedback then it is
something that I don't want to do like
it is not
if I intentionally do something and then
they say I shouldn't do that thing that
that's the whole point that I'm doing
this thing and then and then they come
back with like let's see you don't want
your system but I think
it has happened to me a few times
maybe I don't think it looks bad yeah I
mean that's fine that's fine if you
think this is a good
perfect
and I respect if you think so
that is weird moments
let me see
if I
make it a slightly bit
about that that away
like that
I almost
Savages and now of course hard to see
but yeah now it's a bit
[Music]
because I mean if it is close
like it like her breast is aren't going
to be completely free this is still
going to be close on top of them that
much
[Music]
I think there's some
okay I think that's that
[Music]
there's actually two outfits
I was going to use this for so maybe I
should make a copy of it because I'm
done I'm happy with that
and that the outfit that's called them
future
and this is going to be
let's call it bonus it not to be
confused with bunny costume
I don't know it's
when I should do first
[Music]
I feel like I'm going to do the when I
see it first
because I should already have
[Music]
every yeah let's see because I only
edited the uh
no idea doesn't need to fix the UV
[Music]
no problem
[Music]
because I was like half of that that's
just that
she's like a bit quick
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
those are also some easy which actually
evil pumpkin which is a character
trending sign
foreign
what they
obviously wouldn't put that much effort
into doing
[Music]
but I am
I would assume that fake cocaine crash
would have different voices from regular
Pokemon Crush
so imagine
[Music]
if there would have gone so far
as to f
[Music]
f
and actually of course separate voice
lines for those characters speaking
differently
[Music]
another evil Phantom would have a
different voice
we are a replacement
oh yeah yeah
they have fake cocoa and
the one called one one the wombat which
is kind of like the the
idea of what
will the wombat sister would be
[Music]
if she existed at that time
since we will the one that was the
linear concept for a crash before I
crash was crashed
[Music]
gonna that's
suppose I realized I had outside the
premium but
there we go now I see what I'm showing
something felt off
so what part is that it's after the
things with Beats
area
I am bringing some more as a scene
this is a fit in there
no problem
let me just do this again
let's go
and now they are connected perfect
now it should be done
yes perfect
and it should be the exact same UV
foreign
defense
but now I modified this now I need to
duplicate it to the old one
okay
[Music]
no more pills and this is done Taxi
which contains panties
so yeah so if they had a separate voice
obviously that would buy a lot of work
if they're going to have Super Bowls
Wanda and a separate voice from great
choco
but it would be so nice because
[Music]
obviously they would never do that but
then I could record them I could record
the voices for over cocoa sources to
make Pom-Pom have her own voice even the
crocodile has a female voice
and then I
then I can record a separate voices for
him
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
so
so I'll do the balance it first then so
I will open the
drawings that's why I'm using
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
let's open
The Outfits project again
thank you
I know at this point I should probably
understand a copy of it and
the arteries project that's become big
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
doesn't contain much at this moment
[Music]
so now I can switch over to this view
here and we got so we'll see this
princess or the continuously hair
princess
this is the back side has the seam split
the tears in her hands where the thing
goes
[Music]
wait it closed what
when did that happen
that was weird
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
because it crashed
not so much I have no idea why just I
didn't I did not get a message that it
did crash it just you just closed down
I need no idea why
yeah I mean yes and this computer is
definitely struggling
but it's all I have at the moment
and this mod is really pushing
pushing the computer Beyond its limits
[Music]
so back to the program which is open now
I'll duplicate this I am making a
version B out of this
which is going to be
[Music]
[Music]
there the um more outfits
it's keeping everything separate so the
only way we're not show when wearing the
team
punish it Playboy Bunny seat I guess you
could call it
I have a reference
place in here
it is
try to erase things in them I don't have
one of these shows happens really and I
really think I don't get exactly really
quickly
uh so yeah if you respond to those
previous comments up there I didn't hear
them but it's running fine now
that thing is very strange because it
says
the arrow
maybe maybe it wasn't the copy yeah yeah
I said the computer is dragging but
because it says it has lost a zero
frames meaning that they must have sent
away on so either either your internet
has struggled
uh because not so obviously not to blame
everyone else
because if I look at the history of
streaming every it looks stable I don't
see any hiccups here
so that's
that's the only thing I can think of at
the moment
I'm blaming your internet at this point
unless someone else came back back up
that's my section
it was struggling for them in that case
[Music]
this is different from the other shape I
don't know another person I mean it's
not me
[Music]
and that easy to know such things but
you only have one reference point
[Music]
oh yeah
the um
the outfit alert role that exists
[Music]
is not only to get
the remain
the main user you use of it at the
moment is to get notified when I
when you can give names for a new outfit
I've done it because it's easy to come
up with a name when you see the outfit
even if you don't want to come up with
names if you just want to see the
outfits it's still a good
or it should just it's
like you could have their own anyway
just cannot find one a new options
foreign
I'm probably going to do that yeah that
has to be a texture on top of the
but the straps I'm going to make like 3D
because they're going to
I wanted to copy this part first
[Music]
so I'm probably just going to copy
already how it's music
[Music]
we can
now I can close this
and this will be uh
and then I'll change
basically
everything here
up here down here
[Music]
I'll take care of it
yeah so let's see though you can
probably use the name that already exist
for it wait
I mean the swimsuit is replaced in the
pyramid that's one of the booty Seeker
You could argue I could still live I
mean obviously it's a suggestive name
because that's what that's what crash
goes with and I promise to just name and
referencing that boot you can also refer
to but I mean that's that's the joke
they're going
[Music]
and but that reference only works
because it is pirate themed
we said where they are related to booty
as in not but you know this kind of
things and but if I do it on the
swimsuit which has nothing to do with
pirates
in that case I don't really see how
how it could mean anything other than
but
and that kind of awkward
[Music]
so I'll probably explained that really
badly but uh
I'm I'm free I'm I'm willing to accept
suggesting names too
but they kind of if they're going to in
that case it has to be more of Indian
loss that actually works
if that's there if that makes sense
probably won't have to end up making
yeah for for this part here
I'll probably make the uh a mesh on top
of the breast which is 100 clothes
and so they saw the outfit doesn't go in
between between the breasts with much
the very thing I was talking about
earlier
people
it's supposed to be in there right and I
said his swimsuit ended up quite narrow
in the final result which is weird
because I thought that I content kids
narrowness
when I was working on it
let me save and see what he's saying
maybe the problem of mine I just went
through another rust patch and it's a
zero here I can just check the
I know it's actually dropped down there
but it still says it's fine
no no it's their drop down because I
dropped yeah I load it
just in case
that's why it dropped down because I
loaded it but it has not gone below what
I loaded to
to you being here and chatting
but so no one else
can
confirm at the moment I guess that they
also have issues
and if the CC I do really appreciate
people telling me about it obviously
yeah that doesn't mean I can only do
something about it but I will try
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
okay found the problem what might the
problem be someone
is that obvious joke
I'm downloading a lot of porn in
background anyways
[Music]
that was a joke everyone said back in
the day the people telling you statue of
course outdated
I guess it would be out there because
who is downloading
stuff now it is watch it they look it up
on the internet and there it is no need
to download it anyway
my phone switched a different Wi-Fi
router in a slow one yeah dad would
explain it and you had me worried
[Music]
me on
or several other system it says aurum
or uriman
because he said you don't care
all right yes that's going names
[Music]
yeah so I did not find me no I mean
[Music]
I was usually those I think
that way you can know that is if you
check the
[Music]
uh
because I have the quick access I know I
don't know what your your phone is like
yeah so if you check there it tells me
which wi-fi is connected to at the
moment and there we go currently set to
the five
gig connection instead of day I think
the other one is three or two
I think five key can't think it hurts
and
so it's not like a 5G because that's a
different technology
yeah the 5G
broadband
thing that's that's stands for
Generation if I'm not mistaken
but I'm connected to the file geek
Network
which all season is a 5G but
it's different
it has a different meaning
so I'll copy this over
[Music]
foreign
is always acting because
you wouldn't really need me slowing on
I need to
connect these two
no I know I just want to move on
and then I can delete now I can
calculate it
[Music]
that's fine
that's fine
uh I only had it as a backup option but
since I mobile that is I'm leaving now
the other Wi-Fi route is no longer and
necessary
but is it still up and running
[Music]
there we go
let's see how this looks on
the
um
so anyway create a new bone there which
would be cocoa what's it called again
future future because
it's a sexy body seats are the PG
trust me I've been into the beauty
this one would be called future C
making a T's underscore CP3 704
underscore Coco fusion score C it's
a very
very crazy yeah funny
so
[Music]
let's set the material question
let's pick
the pirate or something
and step one
so that's the one with the swimsuit
make a copy of that material I want to
copy it anytime that I think it's a bit
slow at the moment
this might be quite huge shame because
that's what materials called
settings oh it's so slow at the moment
why is it so slow
and then I only have this C Textures
moment so I'm gonna replace that one
going to the Future folder open image
and that was my church but if of course
still use the owned there it's tough
without that I'll get to that
so
yeah
right here but I think that's fine
we'll cover and give it a whatever but
this is important
going down quite low on the back
and then I just need to fix some of
these awareness here
doesn't look that bad
no this is a benefit yes I'm stuck on
the panel sheet because I've already had
a pattern done for it
I wanted to do the
I'm going to draw the outline for the
a triangle one basically draw the
triangle outlines for the bikini before
I do the bikini but then that I I had to
do off stream which you know but maybe
no one else here knows because if I draw
on the 3D model I wish I do when I do
this references
which is what I follow when I did today
or something
the whole stream lags and the phones
behind
and that's not good
so time for most of you
[Music]
I don't know
all right the name of the wrong one
that's right
anytime now there we go
one excuse me factorating the wrong one
okay quite nice doesn't it should I yeah
there's a one detail I want to add
it's like uh
kind of like folds going across here
like like slightly unevenness maybe it
should be like
yeah something like that
I probably just add slightly on the
normal map
something it's just hard to find good
references I love that kind of fabric
[ __ ] but no attack it well if you found
uh
[Music]
oh
it's pretty slow now
[Music]
whatever
[Music]
they shut down for
I mean it's 50 minutes a long time just
to make sure it's properly cooled down
I'm kind of performance today and easy
computer best
opportunities
the efforts against you just to make the
swim good
[Music]
and I said but
one day when they
oh my Terror
[Music]
I know I don't know how cleaning and
selling the house part is really
Disturbed that I was supposed to see I'm
still with them anyway
[Music]
let's see if I fix this
where is it even this list this is no
patterns
cut it
then yeah
[Music]
second problem of the
up on there
I know it's the midnight
okay I'll fight
I'm going to edit this
is
but it's a bit annoying but I said
something about it
nothing like much if I ever seeing
action I can't wait for a second
it's really nice over time
my phone or something just doesn't run
it's me smoothly yeah that might
actually just be the computer struggling
so
it might just be my computer and I'm not
even sure even here
[Music]
selected
[Music]
oh it's weird
[Music]
button there
that was prominent
foreign
[Music]
so it looks smooth and nice
on the model
so let's see how this hanging out when I
update
oh well
everyone is even dark but that kind of
fixed it
okay to that point I want to move up
this point
because what's happening is it freeze
after when it goes again it speeds up
the audio to catch up when streamers put
offices on every podcast stuff
and yeah I think I recognize that editor
I'm not sure if you can hear me you
haven't clarified that yet so I see you
can't hear me
[Music]
okay
uh see me
uh that's my just be my computer since
it really starts today I don't know
anything
[Music]
badly
today despite
the girl
conditions being the same
hey yeah what can I do
I guess I just can't strengthening
like I am
with stream is what keeps me motivated
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
yeah it's kind of dying at the moment
it's a lot better now okay but it kind
of but yeah but the stream is kind of
dying at the moment now it's gone bad
gone into the red
okay
um okay that stream
the
the the
let's say
dream house
the craft of the stream house let's go
over there as going into there it's
stream ing time uh
yeah what can I do
got some other viewers there
like it started at five years even and I
didn't even announce this dream so
I'm happy so many came today the number
three demand reviews have absolutely
nothing because there's some twitch side
that says nothing to do with me
like
um like if I have more views it's going
to he's not going to affect the stream
if not
that makes sense
but um
[Music]
yeah really really weird
[Music]
that's too much I think
[Music]
maybe the computer you can't is
I mean maybe
[Music]
I mean it is running smoothly now no
it's now it's raining smoothie I'm not
sure what happened why why
uh
committee is
wait
[Music]
yeah I really wish I had some kind of
cooling
platform thingy that can take the heat
from above itself which is where I place
the computer on top of it and move it to
the signs
it should be things like that I hope
thank you
because basically have Rich works
I can put the computer on top
actually put in the computer in the
bridge wouldn't be back
but that's generally countries
well like I can't do
it happens it could also be twitch side
so it doesn't seem to be twitch signs it
just seems to be my computer notes
foreign
behind
um but that chat delay showed yet for me
now
but he wrote it I mean it wasn't against
over a minute ago but
it wasn't Fine Again
[Music]
okay
actually when it when it had to load the
follower
information
[Music]
yeah I'm really happy for the photo and
that you're here
[Music]
hello but for some reason my computer is
dying at the moment and I don't know why
so I
don't know an unfortunate stream for you
to catch up yeah I did try to go to Fort
by the belly stream to test see if it's
mine that was drawing for me as well
maybe I've started to but
now maybe it's twitch being strong
overall
but I can't do that because I
because
um
it actually went like the quality of the
stream like the um
the one that shows the connection
between
me and twitch that went into the red so
that could be still be twitch fault but
you can actually Cry For the First Time
nice
okay
when I get my best
so is your nickname okay or maybe a sky
[Music]
then that does make me wonder because
sometimes when I press a name I say well
we press it correctly I don't think I
think wait how how are you supposed to
mispronounce it Kiki
yeah so I will put uh
mesh across here
I can't
I will keep this upper party
I'm looking at
any time thank you
uh
could probably throw it a bit more I
feel if you'd like if you'd like that
[Music]
um
happy
a computer is driving again
[Music]
Kiki oh
I'm not sure it gets bad from it
[Music]
don't mean maybe they get different key
yeah
aye
um
but that's not what it says
some people are weird it's like when
people say my name and they say
Pom-Pom I've heard like it doesn't say
Pom-Pom or did they say bon bon
like at least I get that that's actually
part of me using it like but but I'm Z
I'm not
ah like I'm a Pom-Pom
deep company
that's not my name
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
people tend to have trouble with my name
too it's just a screen name and not to
worry about it
and I'm not really sure why people have
a problem with your name
because it's also quite straightforward
me on just sound like syllables
what I mean someone I mean I could also
see it as
like the country that's some people
pronounced as Myanmar
it's actually supposed to be Myanmar to
cinema
Myanmar like like uh like the the cat
sound yam
which is not neon it's just Nyan
it's Myanmar Myanmar
yeah
that's some geography information for me
you might not have known that
Elsa I mean
sounds that doesn't exist in my language
so you can say it's a bit ironic for me
to tell people how same supplemented but
Myanmar is not English so
[Music]
because I like to take a look into the
native name which is Myanmar
and that's why I came here so that's uh
yeah why in that name is supposed to be
a separate syllable it's just to be
yeah
foreign
anyway let's see how this one looks now
I'm also used to my last name being what
should everybody be
[Music]
yeah
birthdays as far as I got from you is
that you kind of used to it being so bad
[ __ ] that you don't even care
I can see let's see I've lowered the
front and fix this and see if this works
yeah and also yes but I'm going to
mirror over here maybe
okay doing that
did not work as well as I hope
it's a bit behind the chat
when I do these split screen mode
[Music]
you just do
foreign
[Music]
to the left so I don't misplace it
behind the chest so often hopefully less
often now
[Music]
to like
the diet and then find a good position
for that point
give it a smooth side shape
[Music]
my real name is Evelyn
and I pronounce it Evelyn
but since I'm in Sweden where we had
where I did and it sprouts
that
[Music]
I it used to bother me but after so long
he just kept tired of carrying around
here
[Music]
I guess so
[Music]
okay I should just do more
no and and I am from Sweden is a nice
place then why is a separate vowel with
a separate sound
and sure I could just build it with an
eye because that's something going with
[Music]
Evelyn
which might sound the same to you if
you're not used that sound
but that's not what I go with but it's
fine it's fine
it's close enough
but then I had something like every line
or something that's that's not my name
should be too too off
[Music]
all right
[Music]
they're in the windows same dialogue
everything is lagging
uh at least it's a common problem for
people functionally in the Years
everyone expensive science
well I guess everyone would be because
in the surname size written incorrectly
and so
please pronounced and
misspelled
that was a question I asked
and then we got an answer to
because I read that in some countries
the names that you can give yourself are
limited to what the people working there
can type on the keyboard
Uso UK keyboard
actually
give a standard keyboard
you can only type letters as you said
and that's all you get and special case
of course
but in in case of letters that's that's
that's all you get
nothing more on the British keyboard you
can actually press down the right alt or
Control Alt
control left off and you get and then
you press the
five vows you get the five arms with an
X in back
exits to just a few more letters
there you go that smooth it's really
nice
yeah my stomach anything is spelled
correctly because the proper spelling is
Swedish keyboard allows people to type
a few more letters
okay this on this one is keyboard
there are so there are keys that are
called
um and dead keys because when you press
the key nothing happens I just don't
think second don't know where the name
comes from
so for example they're just Accent key
which I guess is a good name because
there's two accent marks on it
hey to press on it
and you get the so-called acute accent
but nothing happens when you just press
on it but then when you press Naval you
get that vowel with the action mark
and if you can shift the accent can you
get a grave accent instead
on the value person
[Music]
and then there is the then and then
there's this a second that key with more
markers which it has to tilde
the
viruses Tremor I don't know what it's
called
and then finally the um
Chevron
the roof looking action Mark used in
French I think
[Music]
and and similarly you press one of them
and then you press a vowel and you get
the value to one of them of it
goodbye or good luck
and that's
and if you were to follow the same rules
is that that means that as if we were to
follow the rules of as long as a person
at the office can type it on on the
native keyboard you can have it in your
name but would at least give Swedish
Sweden allow a few more letters
purposes they are still
[Music]
um
[Music]
[Music]
I speak as it goes
use the other way around
yeah it's like that
[Music]
wait no it changed
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
oh
my God
[Music]
[Music]
something like that
and worst part is this
so it's that corn and it just tells me
here
I can go see how
[Music]
something like that I think
no
[Music]
[Music]
I don't care export this now and then
and now we love scenes as well
I will laugh
[Music]
but perhaps it's changed my performance
model computer tonight
[Music]
you know a low performance to say
battery or something
I mean it's not always the same battery
results it's the same like
business power something
[Music]
[Music]
outside
no one in an electricity
[Music]
now it sets a high performance
sorry assume that's an immediate the
case
let me export this
I don't know
the second time
okay let's see
[Music]
and then that sentence
I guess this part is a bit
jacket it's this parking
yeah I can definitely miss out
[Music]
and when I'm happy with the shape I'm
copy all the top on the side so
support again and again
okay let's see if it's moving now
yeah that's something else
now it's very nice
right
now click it sir have a look at from the
front can I get this weird thing here
[Music]
[Music]
okay instead um
and now it's runners
I didn't even the name of that one I
named the other one
good
yeah this is part of that thing and it's
going to follow
happened in that much
that's not going to be much of anything
yeah again I think I'm happy with this
so I will copy all these
I'm giving messages while I'm streaming
I am busy
what is it
the most famous
I wish you didn't notify me about
why is it
easy
it is still selected
dislike it
why are you why is this
why is doing that
let's refuse to bring this network
and why is this one too high up
he has my everything is
more problems it looks fine down here I
went up there
[Music]
no just just to hide for some reason
why is that
someone explained that to me
it doesn't make sense to me
[Music]
I don't like it when it's uneven
wait what
then I press there
foreign
[Music]
to pixels but for some reason does not
allow me to move them in higher
resolution than in in whole pixels
oh what's the point
what's he doing your best
stream is probably dying as much as it
was before
let me check if there's anything about
moving the geographic points more than
in high resolution I think so
I mean there is a snap to pixels mode
but like
but I don't want that
but it doesn't that I don't think that's
in any ones
I'm not sure what this thing
it's been only at the moment
as usual
like it's supposed to be
it's
because it goes about there
and then it got all confused okay let me
fix that and
I have a solution with that
oh yeah 35 seconds for myself
I mean I could I could like
like a longer break
and that computer cool down and then I
start streaming again
that is an option
and that might be what I need to do
[Music]
I even say that sentence correctly
that might need what I what that might
be what I need to do I think it's a bit
I don't know if that's correct
hello everyone
you might notice that by my expression
sometimes
I know what color is this object gonna
be purple black Maybe Pink I think it
would be black
all right now it's safe to file almost
instantly interesting
wow reverse bunny suit
yeah you're definitely behind
yeah just let me know what you think
about the the um
the idea that I
although it does run smoothly now is
that the streaming by
that I end the stream was like I was
update like need watching I'm done for
now I end the stream I will
I have to compute the cool down and then
I just go back to streaming again
then I'll say yeah reverse is like a
full bodysuit like the black suit I did
before but you have the cutouts for the
bottom seats showing everything would be
very inappropriate
it's very inappropriate outfit
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so I probably need to do that then
[Music]
on there
stop streaming now and let's go get cool
down and get back to streaming
after what that means
the warrant routine definitely doesn't
help the community
oh yeah there is
because it doesn't exist
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
we break with uh not to hydration
yeah now it's time to to viewers anyway
so yeah I think it's a good idea to
break here and then I will be back
whenever I'm back and we'll see
you soon
no it's just an imagination
imagination oh a notification in my
service
however I'm not even drunk yet
and I think you should keep it that way
or I actually got to have 200 and one of
us now thank you everyone for following
and I got 22 or 25 but I'm not sure it
like it never it went there back down to
21 and I was back at 20 trillion
and I did not remember anyone
re-subscribing uh during that time
and if you don't want maybe I think
right then I won't drink today
I think
I think
drinking is fine
but you really need to be more
like yeah
[Music]
mindful of it
hi full and
he's basically what I'm trying to say
[Music]
since since you know
okay so there's some ads for early
viewers but
in here
who doesn't get ads
so now it's back to the normal scene
but
this part will be used for
cleaning the words for them
yep no one asked me I see a subscribe
it's very nice of me
that's the best thing is
trying to see it now
because it goes down like that
and some Flats like
hmm
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
in count
um
I think I can mix a lot of things

[Music]
all my friends from back in the day have
long forgotten about me
[Music]
[Music]
yeah I don't speak anyone who has I know
serious School except for like one
person one and a half person
um
[Music]
the thing is it's layered like once
again
that's my struggle at the moment I I
intentionally made it that way
because
like this is the action
visits
now it's more
that could probably
does it cause you have deep down these
things I can
probably just
remove these without it being not small
[Music]
[Music]
and you have something that is good but
for my co-workers I left yeah I actually
have no connection to any of my promo
codes
[Music]
let's talk into talking to my former
co-worker for a long time
and one of my co-workers
one of my co-workers was my mother and I
haven't spoken to her and going over
there
I mean I was being there not too long
ago it's just that I've been so focused
on lots of stuff but I mean
I won't get to speak anymore when time
comes
foreign
comes
I really really trying to figure out a
good maybe
I am trying
and I am struggling
because I don't know how to do this
because it's all good
blender is also struggling
[Music]
[Music]
I don't need these edges around the
thing
that is
so
[Music]
I need to run away and back okay but
what about me have fun nothing and
running
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
if I should attempt
make a copy of this
for this part
visiting this part
but I got loads of empty space Visa so I
can copy
let me defense
[Music]
I've got so many
so I'll copy extra
I will I will copy extra much
[Music]
so the action uh yeah I need to copy
[Music]
it's actually only the sponge
[Music]
welcome radius gaming
932 USD on the other ladies gaming minus
set
I messed up that joke
where the other 931 radius game mean
yeah
that was messed up the joke it's not
funny anymore
welcome
I hope you enjoy art
because I am
making a 3D models in
and making bad jokes that thing
optimize
foreign
so yeah
so I'll put this part somewhere
I guess close by where it's free
[Music]
in the foot
and there is 931 registered but I don't
know
and we got some contact with her
the radius gaming gang
radius 3DS gaming rebellious game
foreign
Army just feels since you come in there
everyone is not what I mean his name
and I don't have an army I have a
community
I have the poor College Community
amazing
[Music]
and everyone is welcome
if I said welcome
Wednesday
you know do you like
and relaxing music
Ian that's a very cute one
you should touch the name
look at their emails in the future
I should just make a note
and take a look
after spring or something
I don't know why the specifically purple
and looks perfectly and set but it's
very blue on screen
but I'm happier
they can run any if there's any any
questions
you have
for any reason whatever it is you want
to ask me
I am willing
to speak about it
[Music]
yes
name
this one will become changed but
okay
I'm on the way I should have been Beauty
this one is unchanged
this followed me
anyways
I was going to say this is going to be
very annoying to you but since I've only
merged the body into uh
single layer
for the outfits
and actually make a couple of it is not
straighten it all at this moment I've
changed jeans
because she's not going to have her
underwear inside but um yeah she
wouldn't wear underwear underneath
it wouldn't really work
boom
and if I did this correctly
if I go to this View
pattern anyway
and here
it should be exactly important used here
which of course would be very hard to
see
except maybe it's a bit hard to see
there but
then it should be on edge
[Music]
but let's make sure that the bird
pattern matches up together
company
that means that can I can head outfits
more
I know it lets me
export
and
go and r
as well as M which is empty m e
um
so I could just copy it from another one
you know
I've got skated down to smaller signs so
oh yeah I need to export it's in this
one again
[Music]
[Music]
this one get good that's respect to
blending
so now
I can move this to this application is
she gonna have fishnet stockings with
this outfit yeah I was like when the
bathrooms now I have seen that it's
like sometimes it's like fishnet
stuffings sometimes it's just been
dark see-through
and tights or something
now I think it's better actually just as
her legs
foreign
[Music]
wait what
ah
why does everything flashy look today
I did not saying anything
this far
okay
in his mask before I made so when I was
smoking for sure maybe it it's about
saving I
mean good good
course now then let's recessed it
s middle size presence not sure I
haven't had blending crash through any
of the stream thinking
that was surprised
but it's it has all the same so
but so
competitive covering the last session
did not recover like they ought to say
but now I need to recovered outside and
now it should also have updated
yeah
no I do not no because it didn't say
because I've been searched now and I
need to know that I want to text your
singing
[Music]
same no the texture are
known color same and notification and
the non-color change here we can
now is her defaults now she has pictures
and of course
but anyway
so now
these two parts should be flowing
together
merge
that
points does not mean the same match
there you go now I can match it together
but then I had
this part
what is
again monitoring
that it seemed
that's now and insane
very very nice
um
yep
I think she'll wear a chocolate disaster
but some kind of color
um
color color
yeah I still don't know how I should
yeah
I'm still struggling with this thing
okay I have an idea
oh I should do this
uh yeah
there you go
something like twice
because that means that
I could just delete these parts
and these
and then all I want to keep is this
button means
so for these parts
which I should have moved down here
I move that back up again
which I can take by because I close the
this unit there but I close the
notes of my flashing them
when it's packing uh oh that's my
closest
okay now we're back so now it's only
these parts
what I've done now
is that everything here is using the
oregano texture this part is only for
the water cleavage
and this is the piece that is placed in
front of
margin the two together
for some reason is slightly inside not
sure why
I should put uh
oh no her breast Taurus seriously
breasts are exploding
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
there we go
and
soul but then we add like that
it's not sure
all right
I'm not sure why is it moving something
my voice is so sensitive
so it's everything except know it
this axis you move on it's this actually
not new one yeah
[Music]
oh
[Music]
I'm just getting so hot
let's see another nice person half an
hour is already
Cuts definitely now
kinda
yeah here's my kitchen doesn't give me
money so I can fight completely
being straightforward about that anyway
that means that this part
is reading over there
it's fine
if that means that
[Music]
What's Happening Here
I could make this part
more purple
and because otherwise you get
um
you look carefully you get this white
connection machine
[Music]
foreign
so and one day I would have a set of my
own people account
so people can just do donation without
me
instead of having you do it is the
possible to do like single donations on
patreon
by subscribing to the streamer
and then immediately unsubscribing
[Music]
okay let's see
there we go now that it was supposed to
be purple my wallet purple anyway
so I should find that position anyway
this is all of these
but then it's
like that
so it's an article pretty high but I
don't have to go
directly
I say yes I go hey
no that's enough there we go
that piece in the Middle East not much
and that's the whole shape
let's save that and
put it to the test
see if it doesn't what I wanted to do
[Music]
so I will update this so what we're
going to see is that it's not always
going to take this one Edge
now it has a shot
one cup
[Music]
it's still not sure why it's so
incredibly sensitive
because
does that help
nope
just incredible sensitive anyway
don't be so sensitive is blender
[Music]
and then
the edges damn you know kind of melting
oh of course you don't call me
as well to do this perfectly because
they are
of course maybe these
will be separate
and this person join
and then
these parts joins together
[Music]
otherwise and then I have these
when it goes in here
cut them
with awesome
get that artifacting
[Music]
[Music]
okay now
and I need to
[Music]
and how I have designed
[Music]
underneath this thing
[Music]
you believe that so
[Music]
now there's no more artifacting
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
okay all right again
[Music]
there we go
second and then
I actually don't need these points
anymore
[Music]
um I kind of stand about that though
there we go
no more no more artifacting
just like how I wanted
now it's not perfect but
pretty cute
now we can
very tiny so tiny but
tiniest tiniest
yay
[Music]
I should answer a little bit of Shadow
because it is in the dark
[Music]
afternoon
let me just export the
thank you
wow it's clear the window
yes of course it's going to be a shame
although I wonder if it's going to be
like self Shannon
about South shadow
that stuff
all right
[Music]
I mean technically no new team
[Music]
so
that's from when the seat starts
and that's so large the things
so I'll put this over here
this thing will be a gradient that then
darker and darken
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yeah
just having a safe
[Music]
something like that
for some reason doesn't show up
I mean
um
that's my that's right
it's supposed to be white
now I can set it to this move
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
it might be a bit too strong
Let's test
[Music]
your time is over since now I'll do the
hydrate now as well
[Music]
you're probably getting so
[Music]
updates
um
[Music]
so it can definitely
[Music]
okay I see so
[Music]
this thing can definitely turn darker
quickly
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
let me ask my shirt
because this one is sneaky
but then this stuff should also be
appearing
all right okay
it's not
all right
like that
so last night
I was getting some food out of the oven
and my hand brushed against the hot
surface inside the oven I mean premium
what are you doing it again
burned both hands yesterday
uh
chocolate
cake
Darkness
my old friend
okay
further stations I like to have those
seven big fish
okay which further changes
I'll do the following
right it should be at least the second
one wasn't as bad as first one
was it surprising at the same time
as you would imagine
getting burned by a knight wouldn't be
expensive getting burned by a oven but
[Music]
one of my left hand side hurts
ah
[Music]
[Music]
this will come between
not hey
I need that
like this again
[Music]
update oh there we go
and now it's
like
there you go that's more like you
that's morning
so it's this
done I guess
[Music]
uh the the outfit itself
I should
now take this and make apply it to
me okay
materials
what do you still have I see all the
stuff
uh other I don't need to give it a
comment
s
although it should be blank
yes
foreign
[Music]
just because
I don't know the first color doesn't
match up with me all right it's usually
match up but not when they're out to be
displayed and it seems together
[Music]
but I do realize that the bow
should be black with this apps so she's
gonna have a bow that's a question
because she wouldn't have hurt yeah
though
yeah
the plastic base of the bowl which was a
fluorescent bulbs it was so hard it was
melted and that's
perfect apparently I and I couldn't just
drop it and get broken glass over the
floor where's the next step on it
barefooted I mean it is glass so crush
the lower at least you didn't step on me
no I mean everything
[Music]
I'm gonna go inside I just can't see
[Music]
black I can't see it
take it
and maybe pink
[Music]
and this one
[Music]
that's gonna be much
that's not what is this
and here
[Music]
it seems was copy
types
[Music]
okay
here
which color should it be here
let's go to school too and check that's
what you should be basically as in the
skin suit I made okay
[Music]
finish this
collections but this is collections
that Tom is not metallic
normal yeah you have to arrive
as a normal
the obviously
it should not be furry it's not going to
make no sense
now I like it yeah
I hear not scars at a piece from broken
glass oh that's actually that's bad and
you must have quite the adventure with
influence
have written oh wait yes now I remember
what you told
yeah you don't need to tell us
the pets to me
so the
[Music]
this one should probably be shiny
because
I know you you wrote it anyway I just
felt enough to how did she
you know I know it is
[Music]
I guess we'll have a story time we got
in here now
I'll just save these first
and let's switch back to that day
and click on it so if I click this that
was black very nice but it's Safari
as well
and switching to
and this one would fix that up so that's
flat
but of course very well it should be
fine
and then roughness
oh oh my it would be too shiny
maybe it should be let me
reduce the shininess
yeah I was confused when nothing
yesterday I was looking at around seeing
that explains it
so anyway I'm gonna make that shiny
that's more like it
so anyways see oh I guess people there
who don't subscribe don't forget to hear
the story um I mean they can read
I was chased by a dog since the ride as
ice
stepped out my front door I ran towards
the back gate because I didn't think I'd
have enough time to open the front door
okay
I like when companies doesn't make sense
because normally sorry imagine it says
because normally when I imagine someone
open the door and step outside and like
oh that's a thing I don't want to
interact with
better go inside right away
I guess it's not
immediately I guess you stepped out
close the door and then like
maybe took a step from the door
and then but yeah
um
and the banking was coming in here but I
didn't see the large piece of broken
glass in the way and I stepped right on
it with my phone went well
I'd have to see my future
and the glass was gonna use shapes there
was two shockwise
what I'll conveys is what it was
if someone just threw it on your garden
or something
I mean I heard people here is so
attractive grass outside my house
next
not gonna do it
[Music]
I'm not gonna read
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
in a shot
yes I like the only thing I can remember
maybe I should speak one
maybe I should
Okay so
I do want some normal wrapping on this
because it always needs a bad bit
a bit better when you have normal don't
be sick
[Music]
oh air server everyone is back
so this is the 190 for the swimsuit
so I was thinking I wanted something
similar
or
the
bunny suit
and so
[Music]
not like that
that was a good thing
a bit wrong effects
[Music]
that's more like
[Music]
but then I covered that up because I
don't think
[Music]
maybe I wanted something it's
foreign
[Music]
trying to think
yeah it has this okay here's next thing
the seams be here like on the sides of
it
[Music]
because I got two options but it should
have seems to be on the side like here
I have one no if I do one scene here
let's continue to be anything with
beautiful battery but let's put it on
the sides
good thing I asked I guess
I just duplicate knees
yeah now they are here
side Simpsons
theme
foreign
[Music]
for this one if you want
because it doesn't have too many things
[Music]
because it could be a different
Manufacturing
because because the point of the outfit
is that it's going to be
nice to look at I guess and I guess some
people like boxing so
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
today
[Music]
and that's a neglecting yep
[Music]
[Music]
anyway let's check it out
okay
[Music]
now we need to go to the object let's
then let me play it there we go that's
the setting
there we go
[Music]
I was saying this as the
Heights map then I will open up website
which I think I remember the name of now
because it's smart Dash page
[Music]
March Dash page dot snap
[Music]
no it was smarter than this.net but you
can't use the web page you have to I'll
send you also do slash smart normal
foreign
[Music]
and then
take my height
there's a slight difference between a
height map and a heat map
uh
go
now I got this outline around her thing
we've got the seam here on the sides and
I got the lovely Patsy
so I will export
not same buttons first and then rambling
sport
this normal map come on here we go
foreign
[Music]
saving but
[Music]
just discard messenger
well I guess
[Music]
I'm just close this button
close
because I think I this yeah I think I
changed it says so
that's the whole topic
I haven't seen you in a while look look
I'm trying to move it but it's pretty
again
I'm I'm working on a nice outfit for
quantum
and oh no oh come once the computers
close as soon as I do something it's now
and I have to wait like two three
seconds before it does something
um
anyway let's see if the seam here shows
up as expected
yes it does
look at that
stinky button I'm sorry I need a video
what is that oh it's a teeny
entertaining
um
now it's in a notice that your name on
the chat and then it was kind of
different that's because you haven't set
your switched color yet but you can you
can set your Twitter color if you want
[Music]
you know I don't know if you if you know
but she streams when I'm sleeping
so I can only catch the stream early in
the morning when I wake up properly and
she's dreaming late and I bother
watching go open Twitch in the morning
and so
so I can't actually so it's really hard
for me to even watch I I do like
watching my streams and I do like seeing
you around there but
[Music]
um
but yeah we need this heart
but it was funny that uh the day before
I was doing my because on my karaoke
which which I look like
can I go yeah shy or something
and you might not know about karaoke but
that was when I made it public that I'm
a trans woman but the day before I don't
I don't know it was the day before or
even the morning before the hotel okay
okay it must be like the morning before
the only day I was doing the karaoke
because I woke up early to be ready and
I was watching the stream and she and on
death day of all day she asked me if I
was trans
shh
whatever's public about it so I had to I
had so I had to ask like what makes you
think I'm trans like what
yeah basically got some Limelight but
and then she has said that now it's just
another trans people watch her so
well fair enough it was fair enough I
did not I never said that I wasn't trans
and she
took it as I wasn't transparent next
time I got just streamlined I told that
I was actually trans it was funny
anyway and we're gonna go to the Dixie
here hello hello sorry I I honored I had
so much to say about the first coming
there
and it's not stinky
I can be a stinkiest
one
is
[Music]
look at those ears just normalness
stinky
but by the way you want you have said
that you want all pants like they don't
have her pants and on this bombing
because bunnies don't have puppets but
whenever one of the outfits I went to
deep order on what is more than making
it's going to be I want to make a
that'll make you happy
foreign
[Music]
friends and that's about three seconds
I really hope that doesn't mean to add
its reasoning like
that would also
that would be awesome
I'm only seeing 30 frames per second if
I tried 90 I own my six six inch that
would be too much computer and I don't
think you need 60 if you're watching an
art stream
and in fact I could probably go down to
15 years to make it easy for my computer
may be consider doing that
I will look a bit stuttering Wild Things
remember I mean it's already
I mean okay this moves smoothly now but
sometimes when I edit something
everyone going in and out of end loading
a switch mode if it's like something
this doesn't need to go into 300 grams
no and and when I edit this
this is not searching this is very
stuttering and that might be response
team
[Music]
especially maybe in a little long
journey
[Music]
and sometimes it's something is more
stuttery so I could
try to stream Arch teams in 15 as the
same performance
because it's so such anyway
it's not going to be a difference
mini China not getting sick I'm not
taking anything don't worry about that
why do you have so many cute emails
passing me
why are you subscribers so many
streamers with cute humans
[Music]
but you're not subscribed to me so you
don't have my kids
[Music]
oh yeah yeah one more thing we need we
need to look at the boxing the unboxing
all right and I don't think exactly how
I want it especially when it goes down
like that but
it's kind of hard to see
what kind of sharp angles your teeth
[Music]
but yeah
[Music]
they're very nice very very smooth
outfits
everyone to look at my butt
of staying at my boy
and also got a hole for the pain because
it needs that
I mean the the black Beats by maybe 14
parents I guess that is my suit and I
still have the like other stuff to do I
should put back one ears on top of the
head
so let me do
foreign
since they do have their
if you if you want the seams to be more
active
[Music]
they do have seams back across the
breasts to Simply impressed boy
bunny too
thanks you know
depressed eye
shapes
they have shape
yeah so I could make it more accurate if
I had like a scene here
I'll add like another strong scene not
not like some something like that no one
is too many
in like the the I mean if you like
scenes across the breasts or if you like
the smooth cleanly I'm up before
both
I don't have to make everything a
decision
[Music]
[Music]
so I
don't let me know what you think
no she's not wearing hippo she's decent
all right it doesn't have a bow with
them
yeah okay let's go
he would still behind me I have her
though of course
and I need to check that it's to this
outfits there you go she has a black
belt
mashing black motor actually
I like it she lipsticks
yeah all right yeah I guess I guess we
left the screen
but this seems good that seems good
so yeah so
she would have a headband across her
hands
let's create that
there's that way
being a very small and actually it's
just
that Circle
oh yeah
and then I think that's the invitation I
want
[Music]
thank you
Big Swamp who's going to take the road
heads
that's more like it
still give me her the bunny ear
headbands therefore yeah of course you
need stick
he will have that one
but it's going to be fake yes obviously
it's going to be very obvious that it's
fake news
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
wait what's the originally
it went into point is clear the nuts
and as it moves
restaurant in 19.
[Music]
so the orange and blankets came
yeah we got those points shrink towards
that point at least definitely one
handing a movie
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
okay so this is assistant
what is your point
[Music]
so all I need to do is move this that
way
so it's this one
that was all I had to do
okay there's water here today now the
origin point is okay
perfect
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yeah I think I'm happy with that
let's separate this
so I can work on it separately
when it comes to this headband how
it's like wider on The Middle
less white than the chance
how far down does it go
it doesn't have like ears humans
what a surprise
I mean a human also has two ears but
still
where bunny is so that's still four
years so
[Music]
and keep points my drink is almost out
such a jam a
don't give me a month you can up
I will be back
Chinese
foreign
[Music]
whatever
thank you
foreign
2 minutes 15 seconds
but I put the ads onto
push back when the ants are playing next
time
[Music]
I think there was also only two watches
at the moment see if the other watches
done easy and guess that so well
and that means that if people are
joining
an owl or something
that means stuff now we have one hour
and 26 minutes of ads to be watching
the people showing now it's so much more
such a nice thing before it has been
playing with it
I think that's
really nice so let me
actually turn this
into a headband
[Music]
so there we go the headband done
maybe maybe a bit more thinking
[Music]
thank you
Okay so
looking at them
reference images softly sentence don't
make sense
hmm because they're like too short what
is going to make sense it's gonna have
to go down
more on the side of the hand so it's
gonna not that I need to make it I think
it makes
it I'm making it anyway I can just make
it make sense that's fine
actually that's not about like this
this difference for it
since
let me
foreign
let's see
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
my phone
it's
doing things
it was good to have gonna kill and I
think that one this one shows that I
should do it in advance
[Music]
let's snag your back before I was yep it
only took me one two minutes and 15
seconds
so it was yeah
[Music]
[Music]
like this this stuff
[Music]
oh
if this container says and that it has
measurements and magnetic things that's
crazy
it has like a thousand megalities
I thought that's like
because one little thing is one kilogram
so
1000 magnitude is a Megaton there
in a crazy weight
so anyway
um
[Music]
[Music]
yeah that's another point
foreign
thanks
option there
so it's starting to become a headbands
[Music]
but technically I normally then went
every normal headband is like
just perfectly around it's good
it wouldn't even like that gap on the
heads
she's gonna let me connected and she
only loves you that heaven
hey if you think so
[Music]
Okay so
here's the thing
the headband becomes smaller at the edge
is here
but this can occur in Instagram with
Tunis
that's what I've got moving is stable as
this point is
it's only a kind of
yeah that's that's no words
so I need um
is as big as possible without affecting
the minimum point there you go
[Music]
and now
that's that's kind of like a headband
right
and knock on the tiniest part
let's hide from one
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
let's take this disband but it's never
been bad
okay let me uh
without adding more faster current event
we open a second then they
was running one instance
yeah quick
important
fine I'm not going to show this because
I'm going to do it quick tonight
just go through a very quick message
no I'm saying enough games it's just a
default cooker
it's just a default mesh
[Music]
and then I go to her headband
which
are slightly keeping their head but not
much
this one is
this one is
oh yeah
44 centimeters
so let's go with that
44 as benefits
[Music]
so let's go to when yes I initially when
I think
we're about 25 centimeters
okay so I want
if there's a function for that that
would be
happy
like this
I want to extract every problem here
what
wait 25 centimeters
and obviously it's not surprised it is
in real life because
like in 3D space you obviously have all
kind of numbers to specify which
position happens and in blender in the
past baby just turned was shown with
done with arbitrary units but stand
excited to just go with meter because
meter is
like Universal standard university
and then
I think it's a kinda industry standard
as well I mean unreal engineer does sync
meter as well
and so let's get
uh but in my regardless if it's uh the
blender unit or meter you could and you
still have technically the prefix still
so so even if we just Blended units what
unit
unless you have a better name for it
uh blender
blenderized it's a blender right now
okay
oops
[Music]
if you have blender right
you can therefore have a scenty blender
right if you want
let's go with units that's it anyway so
yeah you have a unit you can have a
center unit
another unit and a milli unit
s
Mega units you can eat
battery units
okay this is pretty you can put these
prefixes on any unit we want
[Music]
I don't have expensive blenders I have
no idea what is no it's just calm I
think the unit is just called uni
that's must be
one story for looking Lenny
[Music]
I must be able to learn that one
oh hey it's it's in properties there we
go
none
yeah in that case it's just it's
unspecified in
but then like if I move this unit
one yeah this is one minute out but then
if I set it to metric I know it's one
meter
at the same distance
there's a
[Music]
they're having piano games today
I think we got your attention
links
the default unit you should mean
it doesn't remain Mass kilograms
I'm
seconds temperature Kelvin
it only got to set Kelvin in Celsius it
doesn't know it of course because I have
certain magic I have got Imperial it
does give other options
[Music]
going between and now you in The Matrix
metric is just given names of the
non-units but Imperium doesn't really be
and I don't know if it's going to break
stuff
[Music]
I don't want that to happen
you can tell me to use the cold Blends
you know I mean blender like and I'll
believe you but I suppose I know the
unit is not gonna release
it's they they are basically called I
think they call the same thing as the
units are in
like in Photoshop and what units are
called and try to think of a different
type of
at this afternoon
[Music]
and basically they don't they don't have
a name it's just
okay I think it actually units in simple
you have names because you have pixels
you have
real units like millimeters and inches
but in that case you have to specify the
real life resolution of the picture
yeah
but since I only work with digital
lockdown in pixels and I annoys me when
World shop is in default pixels because
it's about the editing software ninja
realize it and stuff
maybe maybe there's a chance for that
maybe it's a fair reasons
[Music]
I won't select that lucky
love that
[Music]
every single one of these which isn't
many of them
luckily Leslie goes but now
and then
[Music]
they make things as well
here we go
each and every one of those deleted
shoot other insights Monument
you might see it inside of it
so
apparent and SD chance
whoops
that wasn't wearing one oh it's which
way
this is why I want uh my championship
before
which I hope you can get pretty cheap
but keyboard because yeah you might
recognize this person but who knows and
the other question is watching oh wait I
got enough information
and now it's another location
a certain days on notifications
thank you
thank you
up to him yeah
up to speed there
so anyway once I mention is that there
are keyboards that you can purchase
things inside for laptops which are
number pads only
and then of course like the gaming
keypads which are
which are like indeed the left side of
the keyboard wsd and and a lot of
numbers close by that amazing access
because what I probably mentioned before
and all the keyboard is is a thing that
sends you sends a number number
represent which key it is so
so you can you can do whatever you want
as long as you send those
as standard numbers you can make it
simple
consider it being whatever it can be
considered keyboard and that's what the
these devices that are designed to
hack you
because what they do
something right now and you
what they're what they do
is that they pretend that they are
keyboards and send these standard inputs
and standard
and the
one makes inputs on your computer
without your consent
[Music]
this one should be the same as this one
and why is it this morning
[Music]
[Music]
um yeah
there's anything that can give these
numbers one pack that's keyboard for the
computer
um so this this USB devices are just
and keyboard with
some AI which kind of need to know any
IP programs but it just go through the
desired keyboard inputs and then you
will do it very quickly and just
change a lot of settings and stuff
wait didn't it change
why do you want to change
I didn't press the combination
so anyway
yes yes now I actually switched to the
string painting
so if
that's exactly how these the special
number cheats and gamer number passing
gamer pass between column notes uh words
because they are just certainly standard
keyboard input as you press the what
looks like standard keyboard Keys yes
that's that
and that is
um
something I want
yeah but
I don't have you doing so it's difficult
and
that this is SpongeBob
but I want one that presses the
[Music]
I think it's easy
thank you
[Music]
that presses the um
at the
f is
basically
the number card with the F keys on it
and it should be the key f13
1224 which are valid keys
that computer does understand
[Music]
that instead and let's put this I don't
know here
that's why I like to put stuff
apparently
[Music]
and since since most keyboards don't
have and don't have any skins
but these keys are valid keys that most
softwares do recognize anyway and then I
[Music]
think always should be able to recognize
this keys that means that I can use
these keys without them in playing with
another software accessible software are
intentionally yes set them to
[Music]
again
so what's this map do the white frame
Department it said this that thing is
called a Yumi map
and
and basically each of these polygons are
specific points which for some reasons
that's interesting
it's not like just alignments but
um
in each of these points represent a
point on the 3D model
and so the each of these areas is an
area here so
so this area which is this area
I will read this part architecture
as simple as that
[Music]
[Music]
very simple
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
and yeah
and now the good question is why is it
called that you UV map do you have a
guess or why it's called UV map
[Music]
it's a an interesting reason
I don't know if you can guess
Ultra Pilots there and nope
that wouldn't really make the same
name
[Music]
Okay the reason is kind of silly
I guess it's kind of half silly
when it comes to exercise
yeah when it comes to this 3D space as
you know if you have the X Y and Z axis
and which you might not know however is
that when it comes to rotation
now I just don't know what should so
this is position exponent
is there a danger then
okay okay this okay so for rotation you
do have a w x y z there's there's such a
relation mode
location w x y said
rotation
so what they did was pick u and v as the
two letters before W to refer to the
position of the point
politician
and when you think about it that a bit
more like okay U because we're w x y z
yes but when
so it kind of makes sense in that way so
UV doesn't actually stand for anything
but it does not make sense but because
for location you only have X Y and Z so
the it should not be called UV issue or
X because VW
oh
and but
um you'll be easy if you have to say
than VW and VW
yeah it's kind of already a brand name
average of brand names
a manufacturer
[Music]
V
VW yes
Volkswagen
the the folk wagon
let me spend that
oh
God's been away
the Volkswagen
it can be it is a
sometimes in Swedish
they're called
which is the literary translation
we're not I'm coming to be with saying
that
but again we have excellent because it
says VW and then it's pronounced
I think in German people say about
it could be wrong there maybe a German
you can correct me
okay good yeah
I got a reference academies for the
penis
so
I would add
plane
and route 9.
first is it there we go
and now it is the horn
I don't need to do down
foreign
let me double check and these are the
accessibility
um
[Music]
oh we've got someone
interesting
yes here it is
I guess is your name Siri
Pizza
Pizza
are you swinging
all right
I am sweet I have been happy that you
follow
[Music]
and there we go
and let's say
they're going to set to minimize when I
press to close button you know I usually
just minimize the software and I'll
close it but there are people who just
close the software instead of minimizing
it which is why if you leave the setting
I never mentioned that but let's also a
thing that there are some people
complaining about and Skype
and doing
Asia I've seen it like I mean on like
Discord stuff not how well when you
close Skype Skype doesn't actually close
down yeah this one is exactly the same
thing and both allows you to change
but yeah that's not a subscribe thing
that's every software that is a chat
based that's that
let me know
like it but
it's not just a skeptic
by them
I'm using this myself I do have a
Discord survey
when I have a
what people can suggest names for these
um
I'm here
[Music]
this is
trying to get a good shape of it
[Music]
and then how it seems you've been there
anyway
[Music]
shape
my ship's larger
something like that I think
[Music]
that this subdivide and then
expenses but so just makes this this way
path
[Music]
next track wow
[Music]
oh
wow
oh yeah and then I love this one
anyway
um
hopefully here I'll show it Forward yeah
I'll get that
Pole
I guess I also can apply
means no that was amazing smooth
practices
and then it should not spoons um why
because that's going flat
just smooth some X not set
that's the other one is already did
no that's not changing the final points
so let me deselect that one
but I can't change
okay
[Music]
if I did that it's missing out and then
I widen it up again nothing
yeah I want yeah
more terrible
okay I'm doing one at a time actually
doesn't help
anyway
[Music]
she could help out somewhere instead I
see
I mean
the ears aren't sharp these are Dolly
[Music]
yeah let's do it means
[Music]
I guess
thank you
and then I cut it like
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
publishing that
yeah
no mapping take care of things
here
[Music]
the shape is good
now uh
on it
bad for taking care of
so
let's add mirror
and then I should
yeah it should have like a band to it
I think some some do you have like both
ears forward somewhere like a band
halfway Stewie that was sharp Bend but
I'm not one of them some have like those
fences form right
um
my kitty lights
now I think anything I want the most is
standing up I have like
I was saying
foreign
like that
yeah exactly it's not like this isn't
good
and this machine by two simple edits
so it doesn't need Underside
that's going to be inside this scene
I wonder if they should carry a
different decrease making a bit
that's symmetrical
yes
but one point is a symmetrical bunny
symmetrical
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
let's see
why does it
take it and then
[Music]
straight it's right now like
[Music]
they were flaps down
yeah like I've seen in some that where
that one is blocked today I'm sure
like that idea
[Music]
[Music]
and there you go
it's a snake
[Music]
I think it should have been in
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
uh on the era we
is currently live
I mean I wouldn't make sense that we've
got to give some questions
I'm gonna give you something anyway but
um
nothing to judge people giving pictures
yeah that's that's neat
do you guys nice here I mean it's it's a
I didn't like looked first and then like
all right should I make you my face
first
why
why because I I
recognize the Bongo
[Music]
wait a minute
[Music]
it doesn't nothing going to do anything
right
and relaxing that's the button
so
instead of what is this large piece
smaller more dish yeah a fractal design
whoa
425 so it's a teeth yeah
amazing that
oh Bailey
she's going to be happy
who is the Sumdog sound
maybe someone who has watched but I've
never written a single message I don't
know who that is
but I definitely recognize baby
yes like like I don't get like twitch
like
please please yeah because this was a
game Community gift I mean one name
everything exactly and why couldn't just
pick a shy necklace then
as Mike been watching more than
but it's never been active in the
community
and I do want to and we do one thing I
mean I I do appreciate everyone chatting
and I'm chatting I do really appreciate
everyone watching
and you're free to just sit there and
watch I I do I respect that but but at
the same time it's actually more fun for
me
so while you are all free to be quiet
that's all up to you
but I do want to encourage people to
chat so I want the prioritize those who
exercise
there you go
whoa thank you thank you so much thank
you giving away so many
subscribe subscriptions
you're taking it I guess you get off too
to take a Beat
and but then that made me wonderful get
me the
required amount
did it update
the
ground automatically
all right
thank you
25 has been achieved
next step is certified
and then I think it's like I don't know
which next step is
15 25 certified
at a 50 I think and then there's nothing
after that
Sandy
[Music]
and then
and then there is a
responsible half of this but depends
technically not
you have given away certain
subscriptions in total I mean cost
yourself so 14 subscription you have
I haven't no actually you have you have
a
or Monsters
the starting gifts more of yourself so
that totally 17 months of subscription
payments
2500 new subscriptions you might not be
responsible half of those
[Music]
you probably are there you're probably
you might be even more than a harsh
[Music]
no you can't remember what not
you can immerse before King
technology
[Music]
but yeah
[Music]
okay then you know how it works
you are a smart boy
[Music]
that means one new email
[Music]
s
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
yes
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
but I really appreciated
lastly random gift sums
yeah
I know like you can pick people from the
chat to give substitute this is the
Easter convenient way to pick someone
who is sending a chance
maybe I should have like a
foreign
[Music]
like if it could be at least off
people who regularly chat here
to uh
deserves
uh so even if a service you can't
believe tonight
but I don't know how easy they would be
if like give to your specification you
can like insert a specifications
that is true
[Music]
that is substitutely
and then
I am really happy about
how how people are I think
searching this
you know technically the
Keepers up week
they give some week hasn't started yet
I shouldn't do something during that
week
apparently it starts like
starts when I'm in bed
there we go
it's
but I said in fact let's stand away for
something
and I got you on the price for ourselves
yeah I'll never give it we give this up
as a point and stuff
I guess that's technically a way to
purchase travel points
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
if you got
540
that will be the first
Gifts of these months but this month is
almost over
that doesn't make much sense
oh no
what is this
510 minutes so you're going to have the
same amount as kitten yeah
you're probably 11 so it's just one
point ahead
thank you
[Music]
okay let's share 510 things
not sure why that one is stiff
yeah but uh
thank you fine
bits too
but
that was a man that's too much
but now you have a nice drama two stars
2016.
well
here we go
now you go ahead
[Music]
I wish there was an emote but two songs
I guess we should feel and push twitch
to make one
it's my thousand five thousand and ten
thousands
it is that much closer please
yeah and if you help me
see if you vote for that scene which I
should write infinity
even more
Beats I mean they really shoot me more
doesn't mean people actually have to
actually make emails for them though
which I think is the most important
thing to know
just because it exists doesn't mean you
have to do it
[Music]
foreign
and they would regulatively unlock more
people even donate the beats
yeah usually should be at 200. I I yeah
I think there should be a two cents 500
one for five and 500 or about 400. Maybe
250.
hundreds by a hundred thousand three
thousand five hundred five thousand
and thousands
I think I will be good
[Music]
[Music]
this is the headbands
he's like
okay
I should find anything
the Xbox
me too
how many points is it to unlock the
basement hey
the only ones I have now is one thousand
ourselves like that's right and 1K 5K
20.
[Music]
boom
you more than halfway there that was
amazing
um
so what I want is 100 500.
and two and a half k
[Music]
yeah
those those I want to edit
the 100 is to really get people started
with big donations
[Music]
and 500 is
like
that requires four times more than they
have donated so far
but that can get them
click continue
[Music]
now getting them hooked
[Music]
um
thank you
foreign
please
[Music]
I probably had that imaginary I was a
force it's on subscribe
yeah I guess it's
us
because that allows me to have more
emails
in the first place which also unlocks
more image for you
and yeah give me
let's find the same one steps
by watching
about 70 plus related
it's I have so I couldn't have started
to give that substance
but I don't have certificates
but she's like
[Music]
[Music]
so let's take a look of the ear
[Music]
[Music]
and I switch to this one
because it's
a color
yes
I know
right so that's that work then
it's fine
and I do want to help you attendance
that's usually appreciate that it's
that's
something that doesn't make me happy
let's put this one
let me move this body
[Music]
letting my
that's my assistant and then it's the
one I'm gonna meet at the moment
roughness this one
I didn't need to export
something else is going to have the same
maybe the ear should be more levels
and sandwiches
so let's see
after this statement black
updated roughness and shine Yeah by
shiny
I'm sure the hair like shyness in the
middle maybe should be more like
otherwise
let's do something about that
[Music]
yeah let's get the
um
[Music]
quite bright then I thought
yes
from here sticky yes cry they need to
fluffy
well I have a distance
plastic
yeah more like this
it's hard to get off a fluffy
I guess I could do that but
I think
I'm gonna
after him here okay I can make it
smaller I can make fair this one and I
just but yeah
like the whole headband might be
reminded me
foreign
I guess I could do
cuts
they're making good thing
[Music]
yeah yeah
and then
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
but let's see if I can add some
the indentation I wanted
maybe I should just have this be the
same roughness as a body
maybe that comes off as fluffy if it's
the same
so I got this
but let's do
one for the ears
this is this ear I want to do that
in here
doesn't drip too
I want this to be completely white
actually
[Music]
is
the um
the fake years of the dream is
yes
I guess that's a good answer
people
okay this is your time
and to take off the clothes
and also keep I keep forgetting that
kind of [ __ ] namely
on the way for the art strings
remember perhaps pumpkin isn't too keen
on taking off her dress and make sure to
cover this
yeah taking a shower for I don't know
anything
which makes sense
there's plenty of time left on the game
I wish I could like easier
[Music]
since
access that can stuff but yeah yeah I
can still access it because it's like
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
mm-hmm
oh yeah yeah this this one is bad
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so this will act as the indentation for
Ian let's try this one
so I will save it as a
all right wrong
and it export it
as a
right map
which and then when you go to smartstash
AS
nine.net Slash smart normal let's start
the website
no
it's not page not start uh
sorry I almost I want to see you in a
minute
but that's really key
one day
[Music]
well I got it generated
no I can go to
oh
that came up no way
I think it came out to me but
if you say so
that's the
ear
let's see how it looks
here
on the ear
perfect
hmm
having your own sign
what
[Music]
it is
but why is it
[Music]
that's what we need
[Music]
yeah there must be any more correct
Nation you know
yeah
yes doesn't
no
[Music]
oh yeah maybe maybe that show
uh it's just me missing
okay I'm back to editor on board
and they're ready
what's that
I forgot the entertain
so when I was following his age I forgot
that this age
is white bands
so I need some
I need to make sure that it glows thing
in a bit more
[Music]
[Music]
so it's more like this
this might work nevermind
is what you say importance of Summer
things that does it to your health and
incidentally is also what you say before
taking naturally
yeah well
the terms sweet in Swedish is proceed
whereas needs uh
which is similar to some languages when
it comes to the drink
away
they have some like proceed Plus or
something like that and something that
cost Maybe
therefore
drinks
okay so generating a new one
one of these colors penis
noticing anything
so
this one is further in but the
ingredients longer like it could need to
make it shorter we'll see
yeah let's see let's see
yeah wait it was contribution
that's the skin I'm replacing
so
how do you spell that proceed
the EA
is not pronounced the same as the EA in
bag
that's something else
that's blue seat
and there's a joke that it sounds kind
of like blue seat
and blue seats that means to like yeah
[Music]
um
I close the
draw Stitch meaning to request well I
guess I guess there's a it kind of feels
like proves it comes from a mess like
it's it could be from the like the
Romani people
uh
because we do have words from from them
but yeah when they improved proof seats
that is when you should like tests test
seats that's another one translating
how does this chair feel like just
sitting in it that will be proves it
[Music]
so let's update this and there we go
that's more lucky
[Music]
nowadays um
[Music]
very weak one there
[Music]
a little bit strong in the front down
against me
okay let me
let me try more
more adjustments first off I had this
gradient that's super strong and strong
but
um
let me let me know that's all that's
right let me start in the top
and then this glow thing that's
[Music]
oh yeah
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
yeah we'll see how that looks
[Music]
what's the worst that's gonna happen
[Music]
like that
there's this
are comparing a new one two one
it's definitely
really less and it has a Sharper Edge it
might yeah it makes me seem more
inside
I should get that range okay
there you go
it's really it gets this effect to look
good
I could also have the
ringing is only working
[Music]
[Music]
a place listening here
[Music]
so let's see this one is
2012 this one chapter nine
minutes
outside
this coloring
foreign
[Music]
let's see how this looks
I got that drink whoa
[Music]
so that means that the
part of the ear that's inside will be
shinier
on the outside
[Music]
I can't
since I'm on audience
I'm happy with that
I'm
I'm pleased with that
that you want
[Music]
me about you
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
just
[Music]
ice
that they're asking what they can choose
[Music]
anyway now this part is more attached to
the Head
and this outfit is taking the whole day
when I was here it's going to be simple
[Music]
nope
I mean it is already a panic yet at this
point but
it's more
I like I wanted 10 more it's not ugly
it's more
[Music]
difficult
what mission position
so it should have the E coli
the color alive all right
oh it's um
let's be simple we've spoken before
every single difficult times
I made simple I guess but just takes
away
is this a bunny wearing a bunny outfit
it's indeed this is
if I applied is that just me
I can imagine close it again there not
nothing much though
here's a half meat
uh I mean
yeah the scale of this thing is it
it
cost me then
but that was the thing I could check
like if I actually picked the points
like this didn't happen but take this
point here at right at the top of the
hands and then I made
it down to
air
we can see that one point is 52 meters
tall
unless as we know is true
nah I imagine being the same height as
me
to be
180 centimeters 52 meters yep
and that's just the scale of what Coco
is uh because they haven't made the
skill to do things
that's the scene
modern
years
it's saying
by the morning spiral the scale is
completely off
but and characters are not and if you
import multiple different characters
they are not going to be in scale to
each other even Because the actual scale
is set in game
foreign
so
I quote scale of me
you take 180 divide that by half you get
90 divide that by half get 45.
I mean that is that is huge but
um
bringing out my machine tape
[Music]
at 45 70 tall Quantum figure which is
this is a it is a huge for being a
senior
hello
yes it is
I don't think putting the ears closer
together
[Music]
artifact never ever zoom in the spring
yes I don't know
blurry shark no hopefully it doesn't
show up with me
but yeah
let's not just
negativeness
[Music]
[Music]
so I'm just going to add a color around
me
neck that's
I mean that yeah measurements
speak too hard
[Music]
no I think
and there's like a bow bow tie
[Music]
uh
I mean you do 3D modeling so if that's
really pretty you could print
okay
[Music]
I guess that is true
that's it
let's do this
how about that company
blush
[Music]
watch
how does being like
it's it's separate it's actually
separated
both spots
[Music]
on plushie
almost like a pumpkin with easier to
start with
yeah let's let's do that start start
with one point videos
finding some company that
can do
let us finish
[Music]
and then
I'm probably in the morning like he's
landed for anyways before that's
going to be a thing
[Music]
yeah
and Buddy when we found out
in in the
button
[Music]
s
hey
let me see it's trying to do like
3D printing things
like sweet
IE isn't like a good as far as that it
doesn't mean like good
because
I mean like
[Music]
more like you don't make the final
product in 3D printing what you do is
you make a mold in 3D printing
and then you actually make
and then you make your figures out of
that mode in proper
rapid material foreign
[Music]
[Music]
yeah I don't think that would be good
quality
I think I have for what I'm understood
it
[Music]
could be details amazing things but um
I haven't seen pretty much the time it's
collecting dust so one reason I want the
best most of the moment is between my
own thing yeah
I mean yeah if you have like your own
sweet pink you just make like
your own
stuff like your own figures or stuff
like that that's just I think like like
that's fine
I guess
[Music]
that's foreign
[Music]
that's the first day I almost like the
time
the selected band is the best place to
place it on
[Music]
like doing
[Music]
yeah the proper way would be to
foreign
[Music]
for example might
so basically ahead with them I haven't
3D printed
sure
right now
I would invest in a 3D printer unless I
understand mostly um
is that glass light which is kind of
concrete so the middle is nowhere I
probably switch it out for one of my
magnetic map Maybe
[Music]
why not
and see
[Music]
fancy words
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
this is a good shape
oh no that's wrong there you go
[Music]
this is
seem spicier than the one I had earlier
this may make sense I mean I wouldn't
expect them to get them well no it
doesn't miss because that's the thing
and because they do want the taste to be
the same every time so you have you have
a tasty kind of loud but
I mean that's something but I promise
and they have a different tastes so
it just natural that did not it would be
perfect everything
yummy spicy chips
I mean I'd like to try maybe one but I'm
not I'm not much for spiciness I could
still do it
[Music]
[Music]
oh they're very because it's crazy
but yeah it was not left about that
that wasn't that was on me he's sick
[Music]
jalapenos and those are very mild
how do you know what the heck
are you spying on me
[Music]
foreign
spicy scenes
yeah
yeah
I don't know what your size is
so this is a good color
so I can't make you like planets
[Music]
[Music]
um
okay let's see
and it's focus on this
I am eclectic a electric spy I am
protected the electric eye
makeup was a clicked
[Music]
it's like six no idea but it's part of
the song
and that's a man I want to put ducks in
this one
[Music]
can someone made a typo in the lyrics
the thing is one pretty typo and then
now it's just part of the next
which only requires enough
[Music]
which part is itself is intentional but
[Music]
it's only because Swedish General region
doesn't have a word for touch
so to express touch because touching is
a contact
and they they phrase take on easy
instead so Take On Me means which region
does mean
there we go
but
[Music]
and then more of the Linux
then it goes take me on which is kind of
like an English phrase
but that's kind of maybe maybe that is
the case and so these two versions
either they intentionally made it to
take on me but that makes no sense in
English
and all this really sort that touch in
English is taken me because they like
you know something that happens that you
you accidentally translate a sentence a
phrase literally into another language
without really saying you know what that
doesn't make any sense I've done that
before
and then like oh yeah of course that's
what's called in English and and takes
me on either face in English as well so
that is going to be great and then wait
a minute
Take On Me is actually not correct
English oh wait wait another song now so
[Music]
um for probably this one who wrote it
apparently it shows him oh
I'm eclectic electrics buyer so it was
intentional
yeah
I wonder how many things I'm electric
and electrics by
you know not getting that it's
intentional
probably chosen intentionally because of
similarities we collected
[Music]
and our song where the lyrics are Take
On Me
one
is it by aha
or do you know any other song
yes that was his honestly the Friendship
boy
now was the song I was referring before
we've seen these Swedish friends inside
how many Swedish you want to say
referring to
recant yes let's skip the word too when
you say referring
and at least
that's awesome
no no correct it's probably not correct
but
who cares by speaking correct
I had another group it sounds like some
techno songs yeah it's aha this thing
good
thing
[Music]
I I actually don't know this
oh I know a few words from it
oh
and I think it okay so I can't
when I delete all of these
I don't know if this was quick here
and the other way of doing it
foreign
edges and faces that should be those
points
yeah I guess
yeah okay
group
I know about as much as you so I don't
know as far as to me
oh
did I do that song okay okay
200 followers
again I can pretend it's like
retroactive me if you can see that the
other karaoke thing I did must be
attractive karaoke
and this one I should do now should be
200 foreign
[Music]
ah
[Music]
[Music]
make an inside even though it's going to
be the hardest making you see the inside
when you just make me just
you know
[Music]
so let's start
about a spicy zip search
Garfield's game year and a half
potatoes call me scrambled
okay we are what happened
or one and a half
Curry
[Music]
scrambled can be in the SCC unit
huh
sorry
there we got tested
no exactly
you will use an application because it's
a name
so it can be capital S and let's see
I'm sweating yes by hitting them no
sweating is my scene in the mountain
but I'm probably starting because it's
kind of warming
I can't stop it
[Music]
so
[Music]
there's there's the cola
needs to be a bow on it

[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]

find genuinely spicy developers and then
today and tasting sponge from those

swimsuit the time has been gone being

all these things
[Music]
and I also need to correct command today
I didn't do I didn't generate
right there's no rate I'm going to read
message here

I'll make this one totally
without actually kind of change the sign
of this now
a bit late thing whatever yes but
snap actively
[Music]

meter

[Music]
I'm gonna be too much to it
so
[Music]
and then as you show anything
[Music]
yeah this is why I shoot that knots
merge
yet
let's just start at half again
so I can
[Music]
make it into uh
[Music]
boxing and then vaccine as that's
usually what they do flash
and Kristoff Market in those corners
yeah whenever it takes over a yarn
instead of thick silver and yard I don't
know am I you know as usual I need to
perform
and I see this is just for the color or
maybe pink people can be black right
I think but the color is usually white I
know I know enough on transfer is white
but everybody's still going to stand out
because pom-poms very very textured
but the color is this color all right
color Annabelle should probably be black
the Box should be black yeah of course
yes
oh
cool
but I mean
and then
apply
so
these
should not be as
all right all right
[Music]
it's the next half of it
visible
and it's like everything yeah
and then move back
spread apart
these can match together as well
oh the cufflinks
yeah they they will be that thing
you can rotate this
amazing

ugly I mean that's that's supposed to be

but I got one outfits done today
let me have that day
[Music]
okay let's name this one
thank you
which should be I guess
[Music]
completely White
[Music]
and that's what this dream is about now
we discuss color we haven't even
discussed we just mentioned the word a
few times
that's not been a single discussion
about Commerce
and I'm very disappointed about that
because I wanted to know more about them
where did it came from and where did it
go
where did it came from
inside another Museum
and I also think where did they came
from does it sound like they're bringing
the Simpsons do you tell me
because I think it should be where did
they come from yeah that's that's the
English I think
my shirt has a blue color it doesn't
mean that you're a blue color worker
because I heard that Facebook why
um
and I have no idea when it's listening
Yes actually
[Music]
kind of
[Music]
so
let's do another
foreign
[Music]
where did it come from is
and in fact the correct synthesis from
where did you come
now from where did it come
and
we'll be getting another rate welcome
everyone
what's up Bunny and Friends you are all
welcome
to this stream
now I need to show this off
this thing I'm working on here that's
still a work in progress
actually actually let me
just save the
the same this texture by accidentally be
at the
uvp
and save detection
it's not completely done yet
respect to blend there
which is it which is sweet there we go
there you go and here we have it here is
the
again
and
here we have
fun fun
with a nice suit so welcome everyone let
me
who do we have here Drifter clock
the Ultimate Fan I hear my Ultimate Fan
wouldn't be it would be weird if you
weren't part of the raid I mean it has
happened to me when I was training
someone and the chat broke on me so I
couldn't send a single message
and so that has happened
[Music]
and another time where twitch took ages
to even load this stream for me
so it took a while I actually showed up
but
yeah hello daddy bunny welcome
nice to see you
I'll try a little bit no UV stands
foreign
and she got a real bunny ears too
I find any luck against if I to find
some food and let my dog yeah then we
let the dogs out
it was water water
is perfectly fine you take care of
yourself okay I'm sleeping great thank
you
even adding adding details such as
scenes
yeah I'm working on it
color which I haven't really learned how
to say apparently that color color not
color color whatever
be next to me
so that is what I'm looking at the
moment but
random one here who doesn't know what
the burning it would be really strange
thank you
may I be cheeky and ask how you make the
eyes rotate nicely
I thought I
no not much
I have something to do that no I'm I'm
not
sure what the questions
like
um
which size what is
tonight like
um
how in London
like on The Mod
unlike the eyes
like this is uh uh mod so it's
just
using whatever system was used
so in this case they what they have done
not yeah so
what
is that the eye is a separate item
that can remote 3D
and then there is uh
uh a bone attached to that eye that's
mostly and the rest of the eyes is
static
but there are multiple ways of doing it
of course
thank you but yeah that's how it works
in crash in
Inspire aspiring himself has just a
single texture for the eye and then the
texture moves around to make the eye
foreign
other characters in Spyro which has a
perfect circle spherical eye with the
architecture on and then they rotate the
eye itself
so that's our
three different ways of doing it but
you're welcome I hope
I hope that comes in handy
with your project
so yeah so this is a mods I'm using
any existing sauce the existing system
for how they have
made the eyes
there you go
this means I need something sometimes
and that's like maybe that's fine
hey I haven't learned how to make a
texture rotate yet versus the mesh one
link this case it's just the in the
texture offset
um
it shouldn't be
too hard because you got the victory
here
and I also never say I forgot to change
the view because I was working a bit in
the Under Pressure
so I used to a vector
[Music]
transform
apply that to the texture you want to
transform
and it already has some values here
then we set those two
nothing else
[Music]
I'm going to update every time I change
one of these values
no wait a minute what happened there
well this is
Trench
displacement
is that one no
it's strange all right
was it object object
object point
[Music]
I'm confused
[Music]
[Music]
yeah there's some way I used it for
uh let's
I use it for the yeah I wanted to find
somewhere
[Music]
it's a much
practice I guess there's a lot of things
I don't know
though
whether if that I
but yeah yeah
which makes which which game is the mod
for egg
oh yeah I didn't yeah
what happened last night yeah I didn't
know that it's a title and this is for
Crash Bandicoot four
uh it's about time
and uh really some time ago it's the
latest crash platform
huh a nice skin
oh yeah yeah
yes
but I'm working on now so now I'm trying
to make like the height map
warm there
just add some
more interesting
so it is it's so flat looking because
you don't need to make every
[Music]
every bump and thing using actions with
modeling you can just use a height map
and add extra pump stuff
very useful
[Music]
when you're having a model for game
[Music]
because you don't want the game you
don't want you don't want the model to
come look we love computing
and I do want my my water to be more
accessible for more people say so
lacking
exclamation Partners
[Music]
funny message if you want
what's that happen is fine
a Mexican airplane
and crash racing
lurking I'm like yeah this look is
unlike there is really nerd
but I don't
I don't think this will be really unlike
for uh um being like
nope I didn't do that
all right
at least it is a dark and dark and relax
you think I think that's funny well I
did item because I thought it was funny
so that should add something there
and then I should open up my
reference again
[Music]
so
I
said basic we should have something
like that
but
with some changes
I only have one screen team which is
and I'm working on a car in a week on
beauty and laptop more specifically
[Music]
and I do have some struggles but I am
I'm doing the best I can with what I can
it's amazing how far
I can push this computer
so
[Music]
something like that might be
foreign
map
so I save this
as a PNG
and then I go to our website
which is
smartpage.net slash smart normal
yes I remember it this time
I don't have the web it's a website that
I don't have the browser on this stream
so give me just a moment and I'll bring
up the result on screen
but it branded image
but here now
this will be more
the end normal map
and then I call this color
I think color
and there there it is
not a normal map in here
best thing is my team give me the result
I want so I'm saying this
I'll overwrite the
zip that up some Shopkins
go back to blending
yes I know you must spaghetti today
rabbit
um
and now when we zoom in on the scene
and I switch panel here to this and then
I press
reload and there you go it's not exactly
how
conditioning
but
yeah you get nothing extra with the
polygons you get some extra people this
way
nice thing
[Music]
yes I can
do some slight adjustment here
like I think I could make this
bigger around
like that
[Music]
yeah I think that's
oh yeah my main Bell actually
keep me hydrated yeah I thought it was
on 14 minutes but it wasn't 24 minutes
and then
and then when I look back Investments
I think
that swimsuit was written
I'm doing
I have to be changing everything's
manually
I hope everyone has a nice time here
bunny bunny
and nice to see people joining here from
alone
second show of my beautiful moments
you all about New York yes
and also I can also make it softer so it
doesn't
[Music]
as as
exaggerated as it is
update
yeah I think that's more what I'm
looking by actually that's fine
I don't need to make this message
exaggerating
[Music]
more exaggerated
anyway so
yeah there's some stuff there too
I guess the color is fine as it is
but the only thing
oh
there's one last thing I need to make
sure that this follows darling
which energy with a data transcript
[Music]
and graphic Scripts
unlike near space interpolated
generate apply
so this one
my guest 1.10 everything on static skip
even
empty ones
and I don't need like really tiny ones
so you should be bad
[Music]
a bit
relaxing morning anyway and then
normalize all because
I
change because I removed some of the
smaller like oops and because
Unreal Engine which the game is running
so I have to use that first when I make
months they only supports eight weight
groups per
vertex
you know you're gonna have to make the
T-Mobile Arch as well right
there
[Music]
what do you mean
foreign
[Music]
but let's go with something more
interesting I guess
yeah matching color to you
but that color
and then that's that one before I went
it's been there for
at least an hour I think
London's outfit brings everyone to the
Stream
so
I guess I should do the Cuffs then then
that's the only thing left to do
[Music]
and they
should need to make
because there's like a just a wrap
around me arm
okay right
and my milkshake brings all headed boy
to the yard
when it comes out she brings all the
points to his team
for the water came but that was the
swimsuit maybe maybe he went to the
channel as these
readable channels like oh my swimsuit
but I do have to take a close look at
that and share it with everyone else
yeah
everyone seems to like me
we're looking at the name
okay that one hasn't even larger
so maybe I should make this even larger
well well not that soon
foreign
this one is very large so I can't make
it larger
[Music]
[Music]
anyways nothing slicing but
this is notice
[Music]
I'm gonna add this thing yeah
that's
that's connected let's make a lot
this seems
[Music]
a [ __ ] man
necklace
I think it's fine I have Smurfs
wait a minute
Sharp
nah not this time
nurse
it should meet
[Music]
maybe maybe that works yeah
thanks
and I look back
of course since I moved it back
to make the band
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I think that's an improvement
oh
and everyone doesn't agree I don't know
it's okay
to have
your own opinion
[Music]
um that's
uh
engines
and then smooth
smooth very Jesus oh that's that
I'll just posted us anymore
I guess we didn't shrink together
try to keep the length of it
anyway it doesn't matter too much
and
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I need to see myself
so
craft things
so some some something like that I guess
[Music]
I hear a cuff and my ears right here but
it's not me when I didn't think of yeah
[Laughter]
[Music]
but I don't mean
[Music]
but I'm happy still here
I do like that
yeah you like it
you like good boy
you want the cookies
I should give you some headbands
you have a very cute
[Music]
I usually go and check out people's
emails
yeah lots of doing my screen there
I will put this
that means
that just let's put coffee on the list
come but thank you okay
I'm a cute kid I'm
at least you're on the list coffee
online I found these people to have good
emails please
[Music]
I think I think it's something like this
completely notification button makes me
I never said what I found stupid about
to give me no wait I did say this they
say yeah because otherwise the name
would be
a VW which it should be but I am
standing playing with that
I didn't actually say that already
understands what day do you access and
v-axis
there we go
Flint something like that
but yeah I
I know what you mean by
breaking up when you have her here word
that kind of sounds like your name
but black buttons well in the
once I kind of paste it on it's actually
golden buttons
[Music]
another two-sided on one side I wanted
the second back side
[Music]
so I guess gold would be fine
and I can finally use metallic in that
case
this is good when it is slightly big but
I think
I think that's fine
but but yeah I can next
[Music]
connected
meaning
well not that much
then it online
[Music]
maybe I can
shrink it
let's put the cursor there
that can
[Music]
something like that maybe
[Music]
there you go
[Music]
yeah I think I guess
thank you
I should probably do the
trans
all right now
[Music]
[Music]
yeah and then and then some
waiting
and then wait no no where am I nice uh
now it should follow the arm properly
hello it's clipping through anyway
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
like that
[Music]
you should almost
[Music]
get two separate
okay thank you
and
yeah let's see quite great
okay yeah okay
[Music]
so I can check that the the timer for
now they only wears out
[Music]
Okay so
let's do the usual streak
and then I can't hide buddy
all right
I can hide the body
now I will know where it is
[Music]
the x-axis is red the y-axis is green
and the z-axis is blue
which is based on the normal mapping
and seems to be an industry and standard
but blender also use blue for the
tangent
or under attack next time no it's not
tangent it's the what was what's the
opposite of pension
perpendicular I don't know if that's
very expensive his own assembling
I think they should have different color
of that we're gonna make it white or
something
extract why green dead blue exactly
and that's the colors they use
kindness or
another map
left and right is red which is the exact
is up and down screen which is the
y-axis and like even out
and obviously picture itself which
doesn't really work because the enormous
is kind of a 3D
yes
[Music]
which is the same with the height map
is emotional 3D
right ahead you have an X and Y position
of each pixel which is of course the two
axis which means now
one aware and then the brightness of
each pixel is the side axis
where black is usually bottom and lower
is the top
[Music]
a tangent is when a line touches a curve
adjusts and cross so the opposite what
people will be alive
or simply yeah
which I don't know
uh
how is USA
[Music]
all right yeah perfectly
normalize the perpendicular lines where
each line is occur including Airlines or
is
yeah like if you take the attending is
where you just touches it and then if
you take the tangent line and rotate its
90 degrees that is still perpendicular
line
I don't really know because I just
learned the word third in a few seconds
ago
uh when okay
I went
perpendicular this word anyway
when you have a flat surface
[Music]
and you have something standing up off
the off that surface and every angle of
that line to the surface
is 90 degrees
that's the perfect
and this of course works on current
planes too it's just that when you
measure 90 degrees you don't lead to the
very very the single time point it's
that sun
which of course easy kind possible to
measure in real life but he
mathematically what at least
in mathematics a lot of stuff works
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
steps that are true and stuff that are
not
[Music]
today
I hope you don't mind
which of course I understand it and you
don't mind me enjoy this journey
and I enjoy streaming too
and the six hour streaming time is just
uh
suggestion I guess
I mean sometimes I'm going for like five
hours or three hours I think once I
think like one or two
I did not feel great that day
it was probably just going to go for one
and one another part today if I just
doesn't like giving you a message
but now it starts around there it still
runs hot but
but at least that's your own
baby
see
and this is another one of these steps
like that when it's kind of good morning
let's
use that
that's it so
no way it's turning to me
late stream today but yeah running
smoothly no it's not an eight streets
may I started Norman just took care of
half an hour break in the middle of
stream
I don't know
quite Works done this one
I guess I'll just have to unwrap this
thing
even though I don't want you
at least when I like this I think like
this
okay
puppy puppy puppy
oh
you mean running me that I started
since
that makes sense answer over everyone is
back
thank you
don't want too much no
no yeah it was yesterday
h
and uh yeah the UV mapped definitely
does not mean I'm trying my not today no
it has definitely not mean ultimate
it's not a map of ultraviolet stuff
so it does not mean that
[Music]
happy that you know that
[Music]
although
sometimes I just set this to new Origins
all right now in that case I need to do
that's it that's it yeah oh
and then I can do it
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
something
[Music]
closest
nice because of death I think
[Music]
why is acting so weird
[Music]
it was even because I selected it figure
them out
[Music]
let me think that was
nah it's just like me
for no reason
[Music]
and he had the add button but
something
because I don't actually know what's
supposed to be on all these times
[Music]
on the back side
[Music]
waiting if I just
[Music]
do that and like this side that needs to
do that
we can
definitely worth sleeping like that
this product yeah it is and I really
wish there was uh to fix this
that's my I mean like
Photoshop as a team
and like that that would be this morning
and the mic back to it he had in my
teeth for me but I don't know what that
too is
but it's really quick but
and it was supposed to be this thing
meaning
I don't know if it's none of that means
let me do it for me yeah
[ __ ]
[Music]
you wanted
let's make a big bang on me
everything
so
of course
same on that one
oh
well more so nice
[Music]
let me select everything
so I know where everything is on the map
then I should just place this
is the best thing
[Music]
thank you
I guess someone just plays with him
this effect is over
that's not how it's supposed to be
you're not supposed to be back there
when
um
I'd like to pick something
that is fine that's fine
[Music]
yeah export is
and then
[Music]
come back here
[Music]
gloves
no wait no there's no nothing right did
I see something wrong
no there's no one left
I am an hour you'll see you soon
we got really
you were
thank you
yep that's exactly how you came in here
I felt asleep
[Music]
yes you fell asleep I must dragged along
with
we came welcome
but like I would say I'm happy you
stayed here through the rain but it was
kind of upset you cook
and yeah I've had those moments but I'm
watching a stream to bed because I have
trouble sleeping
and it must have been dragging with the
rain yep
and then
and then I wake up because all of a
sudden that rain is going on and I mean
yeah it's it's funny and this is in the
makeup
okay so the Cuffs must be nice
yeah I see what you mean by like what
would happen I'll just do that because
there's nothing
left those things all the way up there
so there's no problem
there you go
up there
so now I just have that button to do
check
if you're not getting confirmation I
used to be back since I'll just do
both sides the same and
doesn't matter if you see it from the
front or back
I think that's a compromise I guess
of course button time
sorry I missed me I didn't didn't see
but thank you I guess panda
that's what you call it do we have
we do have another and uh but if you
both happen to be your without the
pattern usually but yeah if you both
here I guess in that case I can call you
well you are the real when you're the
EXO panda
I call the exopath in that case I think
the answering this thing and planning
continuing I don't know what you usually
call if you call it so let me know or
something
you let me know that
I will try to remember
adding an extra like that
so
the button
is let's create it in
space
but I okay we have we have two types of
spares
I knew we swear and I could swear I
don't actually know sure I thought this
call is fair it might be a reference to
UV map where UVS are reference to the u
and v axis and doesn't like the second
pregnancy
foreign
would be good
but it doesn't need to be design
resolutions I can off it
was a kind of high resolution Steam
this is going to be pretty small
it doesn't need behind the solution
a little thing
yeah so you guys are fighting enough
let's see if I do that that means that I
know
position my contacts when do I have to
do this
now it's
split split
pretty big
so I do have to eat smoothly
let me check my reference
I can't make it a bit extra big place a
little bit it's like place by your
options and if I check more media
preference pictures
and that one thing
and that place in the middle
I don't know as you typically should do
because sometimes there are rude as to
how you should do these things
that's what probably I can read it
again
okay I will
[Music]
go
let's attractive
respective on them
and now
you know
I guess it's about yes
it might be I don't know if it should be
these values that's black isn't it
[Music]
[Music]
here we go I mean yeah it's using the
whole texture as you can see
oh she's touching
but that's not for now
[Music]
you can't do what things is rotating
[Music]
so let's first uh yeah let's let's do
that lessons
like that's that
[Music]
from this point
rotate it in such a way
but it is attached
as as best as I can
pick that
of course learning is
irritating this access to
yeah like that that'll be cute
[Music]
there's the buttons
I'm going to have them
just enough so they touch
and then
a bit
okay
there's an angle of it became a bit
weird
but it doesn't matter much
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
so I think it's fine
so I was stretch that
[Music]
out yeah
to ensure that
there's no Gap
[Music]
it's just this one
this one has been more than the other
day no I didn't want to complaint it
wasn't done
okay let's see
and then
that
yeah on the battery light in the
airplane is done yeah you know when when
it's running in the game
[Music]
is interesting there so
[Music]
there it is
let me
finish up
I guess it can make it be
[Music]
and separate not that anything
fine
um
I can move them he's Wi-Fi like always
right like that
[Music]
I just thinking that uh
yeah that's
girl it's a interesting
[Music]
but um buttons
[Music]
can't make it definitely the biggest
thing that's it that's my name
let's place it in the middle here
[Music]
then I'll just make this whole area
in the this side
thing
what color is
good
this is just around the orange color but
let's find out
thank you
and I reference to guns
like old car that's
[Music]
a good phone
ffd7 okay
let's try that no one owns colors ffp7
business
[Music]
although I mean in case someone is going
to argue that they do own the colors
like it also got met characters
and this one is
a d for
af3 sound you must be disconnected and
then we take 10 of that and mix it with
other and now I have a completely new
coming which is unrelated to the
previous
because this one is the fbd306
and now I can I mean sure someone could
claim that they own that oh no that's
just coincidence
[Music]
I have nothing to do with that
so
[Music]
I will export this one
as the C
[Music]
then
probably have missed another Miss
the cup should go there and the colors
once again here
this one should be oh there's something
knocked there we go only that one
if this is
whoops
because it's just a slight change
anyway
do I have anything else or Amazon
please
and then I'll go to FW
why is everything pink now
because that's the f e
and this is the FW
which one news
we should color everything
this color I don't know what the last
one should be
maybe this one
let's get this
and then it's m
and this is the only place
where
direction will be something
I'm gonna make this one because that's
the next challenge but let's support
that
no it's actually got the first
the first texture with metal on it
and doesn't mean anything
as you can see you know that that thing
is
and finally
corner and cuts this part
which we just use the
what
this one should have zero roughness
because
that one like that
and you rest I guess still just be the
roughness of the rest of the stuff
and the expertise as well
to Grafton Smith
so let's go back to blending
and
oh yeah
we should also shade space
because they need to be smooth so let's
bring back bonbon
so
and
now it's great again yep
update texture
that same position
[Music]
I think more difficult about them
and she left me
[Music]
same C
I should have seen that one
[Music]
why didn't anything I can update again
there we go nice but this is more white
I can stand up north now
and
yeah but it's not you got metal
so let's enable the metallic by updating
the method picture
enough
update and there we go
now
it's very shiny and you're probably
bearing again no problem
that's yeah no one no one I don't
understand this money
[Music]
you can get it nice and shiny
and
let me just check
[Music]
I'm happy
if we touch it like it let me just check
what's the actual
because a couple other side buttons
[Music]
not roughness but I do need to face it
just seem already
[Music]
so here is here
so these are completely White
and then finally left this
yeah so they're not completely clear
yeah
I mean they are very rough then I'd say
that's interesting everything in life is
quite
hmm when
let me try that roughness for the button
and see how that goes
it's a bit too much I guess I guess the
uh the it would be more polished for
1948 fancy outfits
updates
I mean yeah it's the one I still like
[Music]
yeah let's let's say the
use are more shiny way
something more shiny
body
that was like extremely shiny
I kind of a nice oh nice oh lights off
lights on
update there we go something more shiny
but not like it's a dream machine
