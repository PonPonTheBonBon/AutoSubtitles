welcome
here with something
let's continue in English
continue game so last time
I managed to get all the way to
the winter Fairhope
the Panda Garden seeing hummingbird fort
right now which is quite
quite give me a challenge
very hard jumps to determine
as I can see as well as
nothing before that because there's
nothing about it
[Music]
I didn't like this they actually hear
this one point
percentage
so
they are invaded
bye
none other than
there's nothing down in the bottom of
the room
[Music]
this is
you can continue out
and die
the only enemy should be back as I
reloaded again
and I have
experts rescue
you don't accidentally read the message
[Music]
stop shooting fireworks
and I can't make it
do that thing
wow
so I've been here
more
[Music]
yeah I definitely been here before
someone shooting me let's take care of
that
okay enough to continue
when I have been there but I have to
pick up this gem this little lonely game
I think I'll stop shivering soon
okay
so this is a thing
oh yeah I can hear um
button
funny
there you go yes
goodbye
okay so you get over to the other place
that you probably have to be on a
these times like this
so I always expect or something
[Music]
like must be
maybe it's from
[Music]
yes
I
think you are the one who shoots me
something that has to do
so
and I think that they're cleared out
this is awesome
then there's that
area because this one I reached from
[Music]
this thing from here
all right
[Music]
this game
it's
[Music]
green cards
[Music]
spider you are just a soldier I need
helping meter yes this is
[Music]
experts
okay let's see here
can I get to that I must be able to get
something
it's bad thing that because I can
probably determine
at a position above
how am I supposed to get this
[Music]
because I've tried to jump in here
before that's that's not choice
[Music]
if this doesn't work
[Music]
University of them
[Music]
you can't hear me outside for him and
pretend like I can play to it and then
not that allowing you to fight it
but just that is just really
there's the birds but
the big eyes
I need to
[Music]
do that
and actually jump
that's probably what I have to do
thank you
let me try to have the game
yes
[Music]
okay I got these things
[Music]
like this
[Music]
so
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
of all the spider games this game needs
a mess
[Music]
amazing
so this is how I get here
then I can claim this
so I'm still missing chips it's the
chest but the certainly cannot contain
80 sweet that's a bit too much I think
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay
there's still upstairs
I guess there's still enemies around
let me sing yeah okay so there's the one
place that some things are very and at
least once I have been here
this might be the last element
there's another one here
keeping the less annoying one
[Music]
subscribe hey
um
[Music]
that's fine that means that
can
uh
yeah I'm trying to jump around here
excuse me
because it just means like that
[Music]
the second determine the height of the
platform if I don't suggest is the top
of it
[Music]
all right there's another one
no that
and now that I know where I'm supposed
to go I can take care of that I've lost
energy and then I probably have to come
back to that area again but I'm not that
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to go
and then continue put me outside
important I just was that
this is
which at the start of the universe
okay
okay
let me
go there first
that's mission one
[Music]
where was it
[Music]
but I'm clearly not going here first
[Music]
please
[Music]
this is our place
uh if not 100 completion I'd say just
that there's attention
six
not some
okay nice bouncing way too far back
[Music]
and I thought I knew where I was going
crazy I don't
kind of bag
[Music]
s
[Music]
I was gonna say yeah
[Music]
okay yeah
foreign
[Music]
oh
okay I'm just aimlessly walking around
the area
I got pushed off by the cage
where did I go last time I got the
camera and then I forgot where I went
foreign
area
when I can remember stuff
[Music]
yeah
I think that's the place but sometimes
my for some reason specifically that
part
that was the part I was trying to kill
last night
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
yam
I'm confused myself now
I was to run button but oh here we go
and I got knocked out I found the place
but now
I wasn't allowed to stay there
or just aimlessly wandering around until
I found a place
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
okay
[Music]
oh yeah this is this area
there's like
that one here
fantastic
and this was the tricky part because
this this is a very special
this is not very platform
I think I've already in here
this this one
wait I've been to this platform but I
never walked all the way over here okay
so
I still didn't like the Panda Gardens
yesterday yeah now I'm a honeymoon 19
gems that's more reasonable
convenience
[Music]
for the just to contain
ER I'm standing on somebody
the way it has Sprite positions you
can't hear us if you're standing behind
it but yeah
I was standing on topics
yeah I said the device kind of sprite
see something to eat
that's all the cages
thank you thanks to you can receive our
training session the soldiers of
Hummingbird company
let's see would like to like you to have
this trophy
show or appreciation
well thank you I'm the best friend
nearest good hotel
yay
[Music]
so now left I have is two more which is
the Flames the the
fire things and the enemies
over here
I need to learn this game
when I say it was
how to determine the height of platform
it's not really because all the
platforms are the same
they are the same height
you want to find a platform that's
flying high enough at them this platform
is
level two
I can go to this platform which is 11
ones
it's not hard
taking particular design like which
lemon is taste
that's level one
[Music]
that's a lot of green
and what can rock it man yeah
I think it's at this Rising com for us I
don't know
[Music]
maybe you've heard of it
promise I can't determine which level
this platform is on that's the problem
now I can see it's level one but I
couldn't see it before now it is
and then here so if they just found a
way to show me what's 11 this platform
is I can determine if I can go
Let's test my
business station this game I guess now I
have my assistant I don't know what the
biggest issue with him but it resets my
progress as I die
can I have where are when yeah
these are however I can't determine
because they are using hay or high
places
[Music]
some communication
[Music]
take these Frozen
we have W's plus a plw with you and I
beat you at your ideal when the switch
word is
you rescued cans
amazing is important but I
have
never chest to open and some more Flames
to light up
can I do this
yeah
twisty
there's this can you open it but you're
walking into it so now I just need to
find the last
buy anything tonight
to the anime
because I am
missing one Ferry
[Music]
carrots in hand
[Music]
s
ome yeah you have to try to top off
that's funny you've got this Choice
behind
yeah if they if they are otherwise if
they made it so Each pie had a different
style to it that would work too
so the bottom one can be green
then it could have like okay appearing
on the second level or something
then and then these when you got of this
uh
the third and fourth and so on levels
they can be completely
that way you can determine
right it's much easier
and obviously M11 has its own design but
something new and then reach heavily
play
[Music]
I just find buy yourself on the lips
person only one
[Music]
I'm at the top of the world
[Music]
I need to hold that from here
[Music]
oh no
let me set all guys are not only yes
that's how this game works this is
downloading part of the game
I need a map
I mean I could draw a mask
I guess that's kind of part of Gaming
[Music]
good
[Music]
morning
[Music]
so this is the chest location services
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
every level has this one connectable
you have the flame and it resets
sometimes
[Music]
there are no checkpoints
all right
I'm so
doing so well but then I messed up
[Music]
[Music]
I should try to figure out where I'll
Define sorry
I don't know how many of these I just
know that she said numbers
[Music]
what kind of Tim what's that
about the starter these two blocks and
the greens is it it is
after it beats
that's very good they're like a little
bit of hay like this could have USB used
to Market number two and then they
should just not have anything another
one
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
my second seats
this is
traditional one is not too
platform
[Music]
which doesn't allow me to jump to level
two here
I just and maybe maybe it's so close I
can jump up
[Music]
I'm gonna make it more confusing
[Music]
okay
I'm just watching around aimlessly at
the moment
thank you
[Music]
why is it easy to see surprise expired
screenplay and it's because all the
planets are
exactly nice
that's
that's the icy part
[Music]
I meant to look I didn't mean to work
now I have started again okay
that's that station is an actual issue
with the game you cannot look if you're
working so if you press the look around
button while the spray is working it
doesn't do anything
and he has snipe safe I hold as release
he does continue to work as long as
as soon as he stops the bathroom lights
second hole I can hold it down with
Point stops
but as long as as long as he does it
doesn't stop okay I cannot it even more
since then
[Music]
thank you
I want to be careful and look with my
jam
doesn't work and he just walks of it
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
good
okay I know you win thank you
you're persistent yeah I guess that that
is that that's uh that's a good way to
describe
my name
persistent gaming
this is
[Music]
and to make the game worse there's all
the hardware ability which they want me
to use sometimes but now it's a the
extra life service behind which I guess
is a good way to have a new teaching
up
I guess that's the
the decrements if I manage to pick it up
so many more science human being
[Music]
yeah
let's do nothing I spent
at least one more
I wonder if it's always the same number
probably
things in every
[Music]
um
[Music]
Nursery
[Music]
[Music]
on nice
[Music]
uh
I can't believe
how many are there I don't know
but I can't
stuck in all of them
oh
every single one I'm buying now no I
just oh this one that was the last one
I got them on
whoa wow I wish those careful it has
been lit before well I'm sorry
they might have warmed me up
pick my best okay
at least I don't have to
find it so I can use exit 11.
hi yay
did someone count them in anywhere
[Music]
that was one of the more annoying levels
hopefully future lemons won't be enough
I don't even know how many words there
are in this game but I guess we'll see
how many words can be there's at least
one more oh
oh
and we have enough today
let me
[Music]
just it's like one minute
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
hydrate
[Music]
so
and now we're back to the game
[Music]
wait why did I not because he's Exit 11
and uh
Russia when they come back
I've done it
yeah let's
find another portal at least at least
this game counts me all the levels
[Music]
so I know if I miss the level or not
you have money bags here we go
it's a little different Sparks up for
another challenge against us physical
insects we did quite nicely in the last
time surprising for such a purely that
scene it will cost you a gym or two you
know and then I don't know why the voice
would give me yesterday but I felt like
a decent voice
and there's some snow this season yeah
this is the winter
2600 sure oh I love gyms almost as much
as I love I actually use this that's me
I love modern gems
I take it back
okay so this is the winter fairy home so
this is the winter place
[Music]
this is a recreation of you know
there are some differences
for example at least this level seems
easier because it seems more open
a shield
sorry I didn't think I trust me
[Music]
okay okay
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
he's shooting blue balls that makes no
sense I love it I mean sorry
the translation
because you don't seem to seek towards
Heat
the target system and
tell me
[Music]
so the Blue Area done
there's the door a bit too quickly
what is the red door
that's the purple door for my they might
jump between one
oh
it adds up too I guess this one is
useful against the boss to be honest
[Music]
so any
sad to watch out to put it second I want
to eat green and blue butterflies
I think this was from the green
butterfly
now I need to find it
it's really gone
I wonder if the Green Door is
[Music]
so safe to eat
[Music]
something that takes another
Ally
to destroyed
up
there you go
[Music]
foreign
no don't chase me
[Music]
get it I mean I guess you did get out of
the way to be fine
girlfriend
[Music]
so I assume this magenta door is the
boss
there was another one so I'll go to that
one first
yeah that thing I destroyed my
spinachian
now
this one I can attack now
if you see my brain
what what's the temperature
welcome Gage
always come and welcome ladies
the Aspire Adventure
right
okay
[Music]
[Music]
I think that's on hey
let's face up against the boss then
your boss
back
it's not working
[Music]
peace yes
be Queen
are the bus is turning red doesn't mean
when the boss died and he rescued
charity
foreign
I think so maybe
because I got I got an even a hundred
two hundreds so certainly could be a
hundred more chance in there
maybe three
hey how much is any grasshopper but yeah
I kind of had a power up to tell me
because um I guess I was very attitude I
guess I got everything
I paid them six times to get 200. so you
guys are not cost forehand anymore
I hope you have a great swing it's a
it's it's going great
from when I'm struggling but oh
thank you for following opportunity
[Music]
the rate didn't take me I don't know
what yeah it happens
happened to me Bradley but it has
happened
it's really sad when that happens
I see the message count down and then
counts down in the Stream ends and and
then and then we're sitting there all
alone
and
what did I do wrong
[Music]
I didn't do that for me
[Music]
yeah if I'm um
computer I tried to open the link to
that print
beforehand I have it but I wait until
the rain is officially being made
I shouldn't have to but
CH a professor
ah spider my time child work has been
going when
but I see that our old bows the products
have returned
but maybe we're now in the past and
there are new vowels or maybe anyway
let's see what you can do about them I
mean I'm taking care of every Rhino so
far so
why have you dressed up myself
[Music]
yes thank you you have a lot of upcoming
stuff here you you have me you can take
care of what you need to help thank you

much appreciated and have a have a great
rest of your day happy today
[Music]
honey Marsh isn't this 11 in entrance
is this the flower machine yeah it is
I think that's where Lincoln is
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
something else
[Music]
this seems to be afraid of the class
level which is
because it makes jumping around easier
get over me
[Music]
I didn't have the charge but I don't
they're using the charge in this game
okay
[Music]
I seem to get some kind of indication
[Music]
yes yes this higher potassium seems to
be covered
so I need to get to that
[Music]
no
um
[Music]
excuse me
stop doing that
I'm supposed to do 70 attack
maybe a character attend something
and here's another one
[Music]
okay
um
yeah I just started 11.
I also had quite a few nice Head Start
let me get better that never try again
no I don't have to speak here
and this is the home where she can't
promise
[Music]
[Music]
11 is done right
now I found it
yes
[Music]
so back here
[Music]
my first year said as far as I know that
there are rhinox which is that thank you
for telling me there is
another artist
[Music]
those enemies are kind of annoying
[Music]
wow spider it feels great to be free
yeah I can imagine
[Music]
I don't think I need to eat does
to
get the extra life stuff here it's
personal
but in spiral they're United they don't
have to keep fan of these but Mr Knife
that came because if you eat don't sort
of
[Music]
as long as it's extra nice
more flammable buns yeah
[Music]
that's kind of funny I love to play
I'm very grateful for your husband
grateful as in great
but grateful as me being great
well well what was that
[Music]
it attacks me with its back
okay
avoid taking damage by me talking to
someone
[Music]
so I guess the first step is placing it
between upon the enemies
they tried to kill me
[Music]
I only managed to kill one of them not
the only one
[Music]
[Music]
I'm not ready
[Music]
cameras
kind of slow
[Music]
okay I've been there

[Music]
thank you
[Music]
airplane gets angry
[Music]
professing but they don't remember which
voice he gave me but the right next I'm
not my time machine into the honeymash
then I need to get back to the Future
Okay do you think you could get the
piece in those hives to stop making
honey for a while so I can clean up my
machine
I used to now watch the trick to bees
once but I think I need to go back to
the next year to figure it out I seem to
remember something about charging oh
huh
[Music]
see me assuming I should go up
oh a nice chance to think
the flame these steps
okay
[Music]
yeah I don't know
sorry professor at Grand TV
[Music]
made a healthy if I need to completely
99 but I'm gonna do something about
charging
there's something about the bees
[Music]
all right
it must be a secret area because I still
have it from here
key
you know he would be a great help in
this level doctor please I don't know
[Music]
teaspoon
[Music]
I wonder what happens
if you manage to melt name one of those
things
and to the last anime at the same time I
have a nice night around 11 now 2
minutes
[Music]
maybe that includes the beads
something with charging effect
[Music]
[Music]
Okay so
[Music]
what's this
that's right
I try
[Music]
okay let me see yeah there it is

[Music]
about charging
[Music]

I missed that part of 11.
[Music]
and then where I'm going

security
[Music]
I finally found it

foreign
[Music]
running into enemies will slow you down
and take away time do they also slow it
down I know it takes the only time
[Music]
we'll start with this
[Music]
completely bad
bang
designs instead of time as you can turn
that means that I really lose because
I'm not going to be able to play games
[Music]
okay
this is

[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay
[Music]
remaining
dance
[Music]
because it's the original Spider
you got 60 gems from
we did appear
imagine it
[Music]
what do you see gems then becomes
[Music]
but yeah as you can see you get 60 gems
after collecting eight items
which I think this changed anything
gems
the native games
instead of
bringing him
[Music]
which is easier to calculate so if you
get your 80 gems that's 10 gems for item
the money if you had to
keep up
like any chance for you to be careful
every item in this joint
[Music]
thank you
come on
that's
emotions
yeah
there's the tense
they'll meet the few gems

foreign
[Music]

second one

in the second boss to the second
sequence
[Music]
all right
it's the same commands
it's doing the same things
anyway shortcuts
[Music]
all right
[Music]
I think there's no notification
[Music]
almost 30 seconds
just one head in red left
[Music]
ah sometimes I mean yeah I guess I am
able to do anything for life
the United first was like I really think
that's the same pattern I can't imagine
it just seems to be buying half a cycle
from the other one
and like marriage
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
still failed on the bus
y first thing it was like one minute
five seconds or something
[Music]
you need to have quite a perfect run
it doesn't matter
as many artists
[Music]
like how would that
try ideas
[Music]
foreign
ever I really don't like how you found
 when you take damage and how you
take damage before you shoot
me I guess that's
intention but
[Music]
it's already really difficult it doesn't
doesn't need to be more difficult
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
yeah how fun is that
things have to actually play something
again
[Music]
I don't know the amount of the other
ones at the same each time certainly
[Music]
dance they fly close to each other
how
how many it is like a second

[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
a movie Faster than spiders

I think it's so impossible
I guess this is the feeling when
everyone else is doing yeah
[Music]
but those things more and management
than this those aren't random like these
[Music]

[Music]
I'm just about to find more stuff it was
[Music]
almost like okay maybe that was a hard
lemon and I've been spraying with it but
imagine that in every like there was
that level that's what's in this game
[Music]
another
[Music]
mistakes
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
with this level
because I probably have to switch the
bosses but I had to do it more strategic
Point drop some of my eyes closer

to the portal I'll take some extra large
oh Wednesday
okay
[Music]
now
[Music]
all right thank you
[Music]
I think he was like maybe far down here
man united

difficult person you yeah exactly like
like only additional Hardware with the
original
[Music]
to my my ceiling or something
[Music]
yeah I can you know Bianca current
spiral you're rescued enough fairies now
stand back oh
[Music]
no I don't think I win as I open portal
then try not to laugh
oh
my my magic is a little rusty okay I'll
try why are you supposed to stand back
time to move to Spring
starting your Autumn going through
winter and now it's spring but my this
is a home runs
excuse me this is supposed to be
Homeward
done
wait a minute
Bianca this isn't a home world where
have you brought me
doesn't look like Sprints and now
exactly
Bianca come here I'm lost this is
confusing
this is a fairy home
I should be rescued before I jump in the
lava but I wasn't
Bianca where are you
[Music]
I'm lost
whoa
[Music]
okay he's kind of elaborate
[Music]
yeah I'm definitely lost now wait I'm
running in seconds
all the level is falling off the heads
is nothing from there
no that was the same in
very firstly was awesome
I also had lava and that was the made
you jump back and learn we just really
think everyone should be like
[Music]
I had to train
oh I wasn't there for those yeah yeah
okay this is the start why the worst
person too
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
cannot find something
[Music]
okay
[Music]
now I'm confused I mean
I need
I can press Exit 11 but
this is
why am I supposed to just exit them and
then
because there's nothing here
[Music]
oh yeah
um
this is more specific but
I have some words to wait
foreign
speech
I don't care
inside home yeah
okay
I need to need to wear something
more appropriate so now it says save
states that's it
let's see I've changed
but there's something oh wait
play
this is her continue
well spiral this is
Facebook
it at last
did you think I approached all those
fairies as a game well this is a game do
you think I wouldn't notice that you
have been messing up my plans all I need
to do is the wings of 100 Pairs and my
potion is complete isn't that the same
thing the sources wanted the wings of
the dragons
in case you haven't noticed I have two
hits now I didn't notice that's actually
not very easy to tell
me and I don't want to hit I want one
really smart hit
I don't finish aren't the key to all my
planes
so after I'm done with you I'm getting
all the fairies back and getting rid of
this headache
okay sharing
is that what I'm supposed to do oh
excuse me that was rude
[Music]
I might just be blind on this thing
so these moves one of those
whoa whoa
[Music]
that was a bit speedy
what am I supposed to do it and let's
see
don't walk into them
right
nice oh he's sexy you think that was
nice
and
if you say so
and yes
thank you
take balance or something
is that trick him to jump in the lava or
something
[Music]
all right
you can't just create new ones
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
okay sessions
okay and don't want to see
[Music]
like I said I should let them get rid of
those and then Charlie
[Music]
apparently tried to make him jump into
mama
I really don't like Fast spells without
a head spine
or any bands without his part that way
obviously Android is not necessary if
the opponent just as one has or have
some kind of
indication of the model itself
[Music]
oh I guess I didn't hate seeing
explodes huh well I guess the evil boss
is the beaten now so you just hit me so
switch the game completely
spider I have a funny feeling about all
these I mean about all this we still
haven't found Zoe
um
so there must be more face out there and
grander's one is missing why don't you
see if you can Round Up in us after Fame
like the last of the space I was
supposed to say like that while I try to
track down that I want and what I went
want
it is this the action exit to
bring fairy home yay
ah this time I can't walk up now
it looks like a nice place
[Music]
find the bus and this is explained yeah
maybe maybe a crypto is coming back
that was my guess what to find them the
because of this game would be it is a
spreader which is these two different
voices for now
[Music]
I think
Okay let's listen lower
and then when you jump over there
[Music]
do you like that you can't mess around
up in heaven
yes
okay what is spring in Swedish
I like the cold I love spider but that
crystals are a little too cold I'm
thinking
the machine I have 58 even though I
collected hundred percent of every level
before there are still levels I can't
access
I mean the first game didn't have enough
Diamonds the second game did have
not cleven's
with orbs but I think if you collect it
everywhere in the first world
you would have access to every level in
the second world and if you call it
every orb in the second word you had
access to every lemonade server
[Music]
actually in the status bar game there
was actually being levels in the
evening I ever heard one of the rhinox
saying that winter wants to turn himself
into a super smart rhino
he's going to use manage to do it
[Music]
oh no magic wait uh yeah I just spoke me
not Magic
[Music]
two bunnies
bounciness
let's see what it is
trying to remember
[Music]
what that was close
be careful of Korean those spider I
heard he's the one who sent the right
next to capture this I mean I'm already
the biggest surrender
it wasn't even a threat it was a bit
ceiling
he has two heads
oh 20 Banks
[Music]
worries
I still have flowers to find burn
to sleep
not really like to be careful
so this area has seemed bottom
hello this is a cup separate area
I'm very grateful spiral
you see like when they do some
animations
and when I rescue these friends meant to
be hard to see but it really looks like
there are some
beige pixels I like on the dress I don't
know if that's just artifacting or if
they used a 3D model to animate that and
then it has some clipping issues
[Music]
[Music]
get this portal to work oh what a
surprise you're going to need to find
more fairies before I can access enough
magic to play
everything
oh yes I got put a circle over the E
yeah it's a completely separate City
that's that's like writing uh no one
uppercase E like oh I forgot to draw on
the bottom line of the letter
I mean I'm not saying that you
um
[Music]
okay
[Music]
but yeah that's my thing I have wrong it
would speak to we'll get the part of
anything making it turn it you know if
you touch it yeah that's the type of
best yeah
I think that's a good way to describe it
for people people who use a language
where you where they aren't considered
separate letters
is English biggest but also like
French I think
also doesn't consider any of the letters
being supplied and that is the German in
Germany also does it consistently
it's a different interesting but because
the German Austria does YouTube
president's appendages
uh for AIDS well what's the echo Age Ice
Age I get Stone Age I get Aqua Eight
[Music]
Stone agent Ice Age what are the two
peas
where's the last flower it must be at
least one more
time
I used to be one more
kind of how the Polish see and what else
you said c and chia are two different
yes it would make sense the Polish
potatoes yeah
[Music]
no the difference between E and F is
that both letters are connected and all
the stocks are connected and I think
that's the case for every level with
except for the dots now I didn't want
that uh oh well
I guess I can end it portals from the
side
I guess there's three ways to see
letters either it's just a modification
of the left it's not a separate left a
just a modification which is the case
for all the french letters the German
German letters
and almost all of this in Spanish
not with exceptions one of them
and then you and this SEC and when they
are considered separate okay no they are
not concerned they're not going to be
sorted as a separate letter I think I
think I recognize that okay
aims it
[Music]
and then
the second variant is that you are
considered an ABS complete disabled less
daily life so that is in Islamic
languages
like nursing college the case in Swedish
the case for German you know the
Austrian German and that letter
in Spanish
and they are sorted as separate tattoos
so
usually after its value which is changed
in Spanish and German
and and Islamic languages
and or
depends on a different spot in Africa
which is fine Swedish
where they are sorted at the end of the
airport
[Music]
and when they also the end of their
pretty eyes
thought it's the same when it sort them
alphabetically
you can see sorting them when you're
sorting alphabetically inserting your
icon in there
foreign
[Music]
which is that it is considered a
separate letter but it is not sorted as
a set of system
[Music]
and the only language I know this is the
case for in sang area
why don't they have the accented letters
they are completely considerably
different letters but they are still
sorted as
Madness
you understood record I was hoping to
see each time to get to fairy Festival
started with citizen fatty or Master of
Ceremonies your MC Paddy you mean that's
cutting himself a lot in that mysterious
face
could you see if you can catch that
reason freeze it's in padding MC Paddy
come on out
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
letters and compute letters you can
sometimes
compare differently
and and how that is and numbers are
written and also different depending on
which country it is
[Music]
[Music]
and that's similarly in Swedish what
that is
which is r a and o with two dogs above
and Swedish handwriting and those
everything with the children steps four
eyeliner across about Emmett
the two going subtracting those
and over the aim with the circle about
can be written with just a thought about
[Music]
times
consulate Stuart this is a thief out
here inspired and he's down the trophy
for the best float at the very first one
would you see if you could get it back
for me between you and me I hope the
Little Mermaid with her sand castle
wings oh in the Bible yes I want to see
the mommy
foreign
consider which language
is written for it
because like a handwritten formed
[Music]
would have
want the Swedish that is and everything
with the dot system
but
they should have had an exception which
which the fonts standard supports well
when it is Swedish because in that case
they get my kids are still dancing which
is really easy because they already got
foreign
[Music]
yeah
this is going to be one of the hardest
things to get
now I need to get rid of this
let me see it finally
there's a key which I need to get to
this side
[Music]
and this is a big platform
[Music]
any celebration difference instant yes
it's regional Rock language space that
is the front standard doesn't support
richness changes
um yes
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
uh I lost the king and everything
definitely foreign
[Music]
[Music]
it's defeating
[Music]
[Music]
yes
let's do this strategy now
over here I think
all the way up here down here from this
platform yes
[Music]
cut the key again yep
[Music]
again last time
I'm cleaning to the water
which I'm a bit thin
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
in Handbags and the Frog crowd
[Music]
yeah
cups
sometimes enemy
damaged by
e
and and
[Music]
there's another one here
[Music]
that is correct
[Music]
that is something there
thanks
to explore
welcome area here
[Music]
so we're still then miss around that's
how triggerity
sequence yet
thank you
[Music]
I guess I'll Explore More
peace now
[Music]
well Disneyland
what's up
[Music]
yeah I've seen others isometric games
that was
like old flash games this is Magic view
but they made it so that when you press
up on the key keyboard you use the arrow
keys and as you moved
yeah like I don't remember it you had
too much you can lock up
right down left or you can have up
left down right and
As you move and that was always
confusing to me what I have done in this
parking is it's up left down right and
if you want to go diagonal you just
press two of them at the same time that
seems the most reasonable to me which
you can do you want to keep put sandwich
already made it like that
[Music]
next
things
which makes more sense
I have picked I don't know
q-w-a-n-s and where he hasn't there in
the diagonal movement that makes more
sense arrow keys
I'm glad this game didn't do that
because I would have been messing with
my head
so there are three more enemies
oh yeah there's a tower there
let's see if I can get through
this I'm not going to taste it now
[Music]
ceiling
[Music]
welcome welcome
[Music]
[Music]
that
sorry for my heads
okay I'm not finding

indicate from that Tower
[Laughter]
I guess I'm going here in a minute
[Music]
[Music]
this I can play out there but I get this
safe to get from here in case I got my
teeth fixed we have the gems but
[Music]
that was interesting interesting oh wait
I have the homework I forgot about the
holiday
there we go
around you
sing spider

[Music]
I don't forget to help her yeah but that
was last one
nice then I just need to unlock the
thanks for finding me
it was actually pretty easy for once
so now I just need to find the chest and
after finding that
I don't have to worry about buying
anymore
that all day
did everything resecting of the plane

[Music]
it's done
I got this distraction
the answer already I found only what you
call those things that is
start
this is
[Music]
now my Landings I'm trying to start now
this is the start
minus the Analyze This is a single
platform here and the chest is the last
last one
so I just need to go and get the key
again
easy situation yeah I don't need to
claim anything or and then they okay
okay I see
I see it
oh where's that
in some way
so
wait a minute is it this thing 11.
no it could be that easy
[Music]
okay let's see
where it was picking up here somewhere
yesterday
so now I just need to go
this that one that's not the one I was
looking for it it's all the nine

pistol is all messed up I don't know I
watch this Frozen thing is but it's at
least in butter jelly very snow cone now
it is since it's a fairy
Johnny
so whatever I left
okay this is that container which I
didn't break
and then there is
two more calories wait a minute
it's the AC one of them
then there's like another
he and I do
yeah I can die get infected starts it's
easier that's why
by the way
oops I can always teleport back now
all right
continue
okay I forgot how to swing yeah that
sounds a bit weird
and this is it
oh yeah about this
oh yeah
[Music]
I guess it doesn't break the game when
you treat these things at the same time
I didn't try to
because we added three years in that
moment but I guess this was too far away
this was the right thing
that's lost them now I just need to
figure out oh yeah that's the dust okay
it's nice I need to get the face
that's the last gem that's last Pie
playing with the outside 11.
I need to find
we got this one after this
probably
yeah
I'm flying off camera yeah at least
you're allowed to do that it doesn't
where is this
[Music]
all right gotta go and search for that
place
[Music]
oh is it here yeah what that was easy
yeah well climbing or you remember so I
started falling with stuff
I'm not flying I'm falling with spine
you guys remember where I'm supposed to
get
it was like boards like this in the
corner
it's not technicism and like that
[Music]
okay
that's easy
[Music]
and back to my seats
[Music]
and a random placement of those men
and honestly they have any very
nice
[Music]
and 90 degrees match they couldn't like
stretch them out great so they aren't is
in them
they're very long and then there's like
a 90 degrees Fahrenheit
last
thanks
[Music]
[Music]
like math
s carpets is the Alternative Market I
think carpet where you would use
nope sweetness or carpet which is why I
use the term matte
[Music]
and
um
[Music]
okay that's that's like top top right
Northeast of the world
explain that
just
stuck at 11 extra nice
I don't know the Swedish word for Matt
but I do know what this wish was from
Mark is
[Music]
this is
Norris something
good
and this is somewhere in the middle
[Music]
[Music]
schools
by somewhere I really need something
I spread the overlapping here at the
beginning
[Music]
there's such a
position
[Music]
that shouldn't happen
[Music]
this is
Now define a location I don't know it's
going to say there's like a mask going
around the East Side touch grass
thanks
[Music]
this is
[Music]
it it has its
position for when it should trigger
where if spice hide in front of me to
behind it in the wrong position but
certainly the position for when it
should be considered ahead in front of
or behind spiral
should simply be based on the
[Music]
air position
[Music]
and she would be based on inspired
basically y positions which is the
height of the world
if it's a high-end value
oh gosh for these objects I need this
more special skills
but if you single instance I mean like
this
you can just check inspire
further north Times by behind inspired
Friday
South
let's buy in front of it and then I must
have one point and I think they have
picked a bit of the wrong point where
when she when it switches over
[Music]
and therefore you simply used in here
why position of the object but then you
put a slight offset on it to
[Music]
to make things like that to appear in
these bags
I don't know
if that works
three hours now but let me just finish
up this lemon
[Music]
exciting
one more joy okay

[Music]
trying to find a way to go down there
I'm sure
[Music]

well did you invade this
pinky hello velvet
busy
Ninja
was already in this chat and I'm
basically right on that streams Melvis
again
[Music]
welcome everyone
I am
um a mission to find a vase a jar with a
question mark on which is located
somewhere in this level and I'm very
confused of where it's located
um
well and then now you think about this
game is if you die you have to start
over with this base and I
uh all right this game
[Music]
but it doesn't say that you are with the
red penny
can I trust hey Alice Alice on a lot of
stream and you brought a long weeks
because switch is something like it's
like that sometimes
another business came as a child I've
never played this game as a child this
is the very first time ever I've played
these things and I'm going for 100 and
I've cleared the first two versions
the speedway if you don't like the speed
race
in in the original 3D aspire you're not
going to take the Speedways in this
thing
I struggle with the Speedways in this
game that should be and that should tell
you no
how many spy games are there since oh I
don't know too many and I'm going to
play through them on
and I go through the 2013. actually not
some PS1 I'm actually gonna play the
first one of drinks
and then there's the remake of the three
original games this is Trilogy Of The
Legend of Spyro there is
there is this is some ice and then this
is a fire and then there's Adventures or
attacking the rhinox which is on the
cards it is confusion or purpose is also
called
and a Shadow Legacy is one not one of
them
all right
is there more spidery things
but I'm forgive me
wow
[Music]
so many spiders yeah there probably is
as some working some cooking things and
I forget to enter the dragonfly and I
hear his tail yeah
so
can I still get that one I've been
talking so I kinda
did it show the one with the SMS
I think I got lost track of where I was
going
the last one and last one
I don't know where it is I'm confused
[Music]
so no
Wiki says 14 upcoming the remix
[Music]
somewhere down here
it's hard to see too
the one with the purple dragon around
the sky girls no not yet okay so and not
still have to get the money first
okay
I guess you even get distracted by the
chat which is perfectly fine I enjoying
it's chatting with people and the chat
can help me out in which Step I'm in I
do appreciate if people don't tell me
like answers them hit this thing
and yeah this is
[Music]
because
I get the one up here
yes that's what I guess
so the next one
yes
so bad
[Music]
another one
it is the one that should be on this one
didn't forget this one
yeah I got this one
it should be the the one with the rug
around the girls now
okay
I mean
no
well I got lost so I mean
can I find it
that's Parts even
let me find
this this is a cross around the garage
then that's the opposite everyone feels
like I've been
every location in the world
it's very well now in our way
it is the uh
that yeah
it is this this one
and the active left the
they're very original active so it's
like a contract piece
so
I want to think
so can I get that thing can I do
nothing
[Music]
there we go foreign
there it is I found it
I found the location
let's see if I can
yay
[Music]
Let's scan the area
yeah so I can find him again
okay I know how to find it
okay
[Music]
this is a lot of pixels in correct I
don't notice this but
Ah that's why then like they're supposed
to
yeah
that's the points
it looks uneven because let's buy the
same
[Music]
no I really also don't like how you eat
the water is insta King instead of just
sticking damage and then you just jump
off just watch it
but I still know
technology is hiding in the bunny Barrel
it would be funny if I can make
the uh dark messages different depending
on presence I mean I could
and not
I am using right now
but I am going to switch over to uh
different
uh pot which is going to be self-potting
which as far as I know is is allowed on
Twitch
that's why he forgot how to swim all the
water has an incredibly strong undertale
and outside forgot the
okay this time I didn't foreign
[Music]
like okay
I'm going to delete anything
[Music]
there you go Monster Hunter rice
I know about that thing
I know about the games is that it's not
explained
the character looks butterfly wings
and also the sports bear has been active
for
we're almost in the highway now this
kind of shows how long because the
sports player was became became active
and
it was redeemed at the start of this
level and there was been an hour episode
I think that's chefs you know what this
game can be
an hour per lemon
I don't know when it's his face
I almost said start over again
let's find that central location again
there you go oh
yeah the last time when I got cookies I
actually got that one so okay now I know
where that is
you come here you go here okay here
I go here
[Music]
I go here
and here it is
[Music]
ah welcome to have a wonderful fairy
festival and as talking about
appreciation we want to give you the
first fairy trophy
yeah I mean it's a it's a living
breathing
not breathing parents
[Music]
I don't think that's a thousand years
good Sarah
so there's only one thing left to do
it's crazy
okay
and then hey
it's gonna feed the pumpkin right first
carefully does that mean they have
multiple stabilized they might have it
I mean
yeah no it wasn't that
okay wait
until they have one more
very attractive I mean there's one more
favorite nice
but what did they did the did the line
say it was our trophies
instances
[Music]
oh yeah here we go
this is Brian he started traffic for
this yeah so they got another Trucking
[Music]
so it is
[Music]
so yeah I'm going to chase this seat
without touching it
Galaxy
oh now this is the wrong turn okay
I forgot to put a real Turf in my
pockets to save him thanks anyway
well I had to rescue the face and
nothing but here it is so I guess the
Frozen first aren't the trophies so that
the online might just be a bit confused
and there we go German city which
accidentally entered is not complete
if Roman city seems like such a
pouring generic name for a living
but I did it I finally
I completed level hundred percent
or in seven minutes hour time
to save the game but I'm the same thing
once again just push for safe for safety
[Music]
I got that extra half hour streaming
that was fun
well
thank you
and I made it quite the progress so I
completed the second world this Stream
So the first one I completed the first
stream and I started the third world
so the third world the next Thursday and
then that's him
so
how about we go and visit the Izumi cat
folks because
she's playing a spider dragon
it seems appropriate I think
fitting the scene
yeah which romance it is it's just a
Roman city do they have to specify it's
the one with uh with the mayor Leo
it's a Santa Villa that's the one
so eh
I guess the usual stuff here
I got the Discord server where I post
stuff if you want to communicate with me
I guess
if you don't want the comment ideas and
I have stuff like that in at the YouTube
channel where I first
I'm interested in the video I will post
a video as soon as I get the updated
code which can happen whenever
and whenever I get the time I will
probably see if I can get that done
uh
in the upcoming days
I should probably not say that we'll see
whenever it happens I always got a
picture which no one isn't anything but
that's fine it's fine
I just have it there just in case
never know if
and that's that I guess
let's go over and share on the zooming
who is
the second spiral and chasing seeds at
the moment
