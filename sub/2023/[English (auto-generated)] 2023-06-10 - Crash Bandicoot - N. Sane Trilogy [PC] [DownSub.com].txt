I didn't mean to switch View
but anyway
schedule
let's see
the volume seems to be good
hello Damian
it was a surprise Stampy not a sudden
I see that they have joined
the Stream
and this time
it will be Crash Bandicoot 2 cortex
Strikes Back
cortex
nigging
hello hello
so let's start with cutscene after
cortex got defeated
hmm
crystals
of course no
distance of course
to reach full power we need not all your
master crystals
pink not red what do you expect to
retrieve
D
you fool
do you think I'm unaware of the
situation where's the subtitles if we
don't have any friends left on the
surface
KitKat an enemy
I got all right
thank you and that's uh you did for the
reason you thank you for following this
one
during the countdown
what's the exactly this for this game I
mean
19 blocks
that's exactly low because this computer
is weak otherwise it wasn't sometimes
speaking
after this hurts okay
this is
[Music]
I don't know what it is
I want to combine cocoa from hey
fresh
ly and Spanish Fork
hello hello
why am I using this
oh no I was kidnapped
foreign
[Music]
invitation would have been turned down
I need your help
surrounding you are a series of Five
Doors through each door lies are well
hidden Crystal
the crystals look like this
bring me the crystals
that is all I will say for now
we will speak again
now why would I give you the Christmas
nothing stupid
I defeated you because even
did something weird with the animals
now you're back
threatening back
what
okay I will not disarmadina leave if
that's what you request
[Music]
s
yeah because he was not seeing something
secret very unsecret secret
okay okay
it's perfect I can get it all right
that's fine
and these birds with helmets on
oops whoops
I didn't mean to do that
trust me
well I guess that's the first place
okay
I guess that will get through that
system
do this okay
I'm not I'm not getting enough time in
foreign
this is the first level
this this this this secret area
two three times accidentally
two times intentions
hey I'm going to run out of lives
thank you
why is why is the first level like this
finally I did it
I'm not giving back my house
that I wasted on this
okay yay
so it feels good
okay too but I'm not really keeping
track okay it's promises me now
maybe I should message
him that I'm saying it now
foreign
I just wanted to message
I think they are offline
and yeah
so I just want to actually understand it
earlier but
that's done another chapter but this is
the actual bonus bonus
sorry about that back to the game
and we'll be focusing for him is he
working another battery no apparently
I've not been offering that but I don't
think he would like not rabbits he lost
the last one
bananas
I think the other onion was considered a
bonus area which is awesome because I
lost nine
I wasn't sure if I was going to survive
that so I had to
epic unit
looks like something
easy
oh
mods
[Music]
I know
I can't understand
why
I get it by doing
this
yep
that's not continued just making sure
that means I have to die again
like I don't want to buy a game
voice
why are the questions that you have no
idea
oh wait I should die all right
there you go
I think
breakfast cats
and paints there we go
I love you though
nice to be beaten by a moon yeah
okay
this time
finally
I'm making progress the next three
actually that's the three intentional
deaths this effortless dancing
[Music]
again
okay here's the crystal that cortex
wants but he he's he's not happy
all right and going and dancing
Queen because he's even
there we go past the gym
[Music]
back oh
celebration
for some reason
yes it's not adapted to the assuming
View
there it is
celebration
thank you
Court this is back
crystals
one more time they look like this
crystals crash
go back through one of those doors and
bring me crystals
something since me is upset
they already got the hint but they give
you yeah like the the other Disney to be
kind to the boxes such as special gem
but they already like
they already have a hint in the level
that shows that what you're supposed to
do
I'm not even going to collect their
boxes this time
but they make sounds that's something
that sounds like
you know what happens I haven't
collected single happiness in your
crafty
oh yeah I I don't want to connect those
idea
I want to come back completely
empty-handed
oops
when it attacked me so the
self-defending mask
triggered and killed it
again
I I did collect those but I mean
it wasn't my intention I had to get over
somehow
oh there's the crystal again
Let's ignore it again
foreign
but
[Music]
when you get to the end of this level
after collecting all crates
after you get the Gem the normal Gem and
the boxing at the end of level this case
and I think I'm pretty sure that happens
because that thing turned into the gym
but in this level if you already
collected the gem and gets to the end of
the level you will see the boxing again
but it will say number of boxes you have
destroyed out of zero
giving you the hint that maybe you
should try to destroy zero after zero
incredibly Jam okay
this isn't cortex
no I'm not
tired actually
as long as you are Allied
cortex
this face the world is truly your
concern you must gather the gems not the
crystals
you obtain all 42 gems I I use them to
focus on laser ah yeah there's a laser
beam that will destroy cortex and the
space station he has created until then
I'm choose my forces to stop you from
Gathering pistols
noise critics
oh and I guess I'll pick up the crystal
then even though he said I shouldn't
pick up the crystal
and you actually need to fight yourself
to progress the game
it would be interesting if you could hey
it would be it would be interesting if
you actually could progress the game by
just collecting it gems
I might try it
but as far as I know you need to find
crystals to progress to the next section
to the upcoming film I remember this I
wanted to have it quite decency whatever
like this one here
yeah I'm on after the
afternoon
let's let's oops wait that wasn't
supposed to spend it
let's pick up this
checkpoints
definitely need that one
if self defending skin
oh that's close
beautiful God
[Music]
all right now
my speed running
okay here it is
I'll pick it up
so insist
thank you
this morning along with cortex business
it takes such time
and especially when I didn't even get a
dialogue because
cortex didn't even speak
everyone has left I guess I'll be on my
own
foreign
during the course of my intellectual
Pursuits I have stumbled across a force
that threatens to destroy the world
the crystals are the only means of
containing it
the fate of the world is at stake
imperative therefore that you bring them
to me
[Applause]
this is Kevin Hart is
kind of hard to see if you have I guess
the crystals are a bit more shinier than
me
the whole thing when they say that but
I guess if I increase the graphic that
thinks it's it's more obvious when you
have one
the crystal stuff should be
shinier
surrendering it to play as Coco after
the first boss
like in the first game
wait snow go isn't that
oh it's a snow level
let's destroy this because it was fun
nothing look out
fresh comes
and I
get
you over here
videos
an evil penguins
every animal
yeah hi my cortex to stop crash
[Music]
why doesn't red mask have so Brown from
the back
pointing everything out
those icicles look very dangerous
if they're not there anymore
[Music]
is the wrong design
this is unacceptable
and it should be it's in Cocoa
there you go
that's what I like it
future
all right suspicious
brand is not inside
okay so this is about this shirt let's
do the bonus
I can do the bonus
cinch
now
[Music]
I'm not saying the bonus
that would have been embarrassing
apparently it's still stuttering a pizza
[Music]
me
names are it's only for like one or
three PC games that I had to reduce the
quality
everything about a computer
okay
on my computer
oh yeah
[Music]
I know
I saw something
[Music]
there it is
[Music]
count
weird
back to the warping
lights
the most
this was a long long time
wait Lena
perfect
let's move on to hang out
I think eight
hang out
failing a bonus pastors and class lives
that we try it
just for fun
intentionally fails you can just try it
again
nice and deep in there and you never
know
got a message
oh it was a platform that was supposed
to happen yeah who needs that
I can't stay there
oh
it's happening
you can't decide if they want to do it
do for
No More Chance
have fun
[Music]
ass
ESS against lives
soon it's right
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
here's some extra knives
can I get the
oh yeah
that one first
just in case
where does this go
[Music]
a diamond is rough okay so this game I
saw okay that was my fault hey let's do
this
and this game has a weird tendency that
if I try to
I can just make small jumps beforehand
and no problem at all
yeah
but maybe maybe I can't like this
sometimes just just sometimes
sometimes it does that
again
this is what I want to do which
sometimes just lies forward and that's
apparently enough to cross the whole
plate mean that
Finance on the other side they're
working
and I don't know why someone does this
thing that is very annoying
finally across not sure how he can slide
from stanstein
everything that was too fun
he's surrounding it across the side I
guess it makes more sense even though
the slide is getting faster than he's
running
[Music]
I'm not trying
I guess that's it and then you start
sliding
it does make perfect sense
[Music]
okay I have a bit if time to kill
Muhammad probably you died I forgotten
he doesn't match he
that's also kind of joking too
either please for some reason I've been
dying a lot
I'm making a lot of small silly mistakes
I haven't been counting up in a I
started camping but I'm gonna stop
counting but I
you know I don't know what's going on
you know it's touching again
what okay let me just take again did it
reset my setting or something when I put
it to priority
maybe it did
guaranteed apparently
uh
you go
that can get some priority
anyways I guess
try to do something like that but that
games
but
make sure there's some stuff you can
abuse it
that is your back
okay spicy oh let me guess
nitrous mattress
I need to pick this up first
and
the mommy hits two and uh I want to come
to the desk or not and this is just uh
this is not the best job this is just a
camera
it's typically Jam around oh these are
another greens
you never know
fresh
I'm going to be trying after this so I
can keep taking this amount of stuff
anyway driving
get your vodka
it's like actually seasoning fresh one
as I'm sure you guys here here I mean
aside from them we have started in one
video probably right
[Music]
sweet house
there's Secret Door there can I get rid
of that
you're gonna buy him some [ __ ]
that sounds nice I think that picture no
yeah but if you give up and then I died
and then I didn't pick it up again
foreign
[Music]
nice like that
Sunrise area
[Music]
so much easier to get gems in this game
I like the Walker skates for the thingy
it's a
it is something
it sounds like something you can crash
for us you know okay
should I play Crash Forest about time
after these three games
or should I go to like the 50 First
Crush for
Wrath of Cortex
so
there is one secret gem
so did you take your home network shots
for last play too
much
I need to conserve power I will
communicate with you again after you
retrieve the fifth
Christmas
not that it's a time thing why don't you
can speed choose from this the main
reaction to this afterwards
I'm not going here for the time chance
because the only game I'm going to go
for tractors is Crash three which was
made with time turns in mind
and then
because you also need to do 10 times
again
bonuses
[Music]
when you step on this one here even
before step on this one thank you
foreign
no
[Music]
it's new
I forgot to remember how many I actually
took it you took some energy for cut it
crash is a real dumb dumb working for
cortex in this game yeah and also as a
player you know you know what what is up
to
so you can decide to not gather crystals
and also when if you get a gem first
before the crystals you can do
and
first test of this one
I I mean no but I've tied my time
I mean yeah you're not going to do
you don't need to count it's fine
it's okay
but uh but you're not going to do that
anyway right
put on the dress again
he's getting a bit cold
yeah so
but especially since currently I'm
trying to make this time
[Music]
thank you
so maybe I should pick up this
checkpoint and then try to download the
rest
no it must touch down kids
nice test on mentioned by the way
just put it on top of it
he was supposed to spin down
another company
got it
30 seconds to stay
I thought you would play as coco or do
you need another coffee needs to be an
actress
yes Sam yes after they defeat the first
boss
get to the second Warframe Coco will be
there in some way
and in this game Coco speaks the crash
so if you play as Coco hey the game
switches back to crash for those
actually article scenes are speaking the
crash actually now I think
so then we always switch cash but for
the
well it's calling you the cutscene might
not be the appropriate term
ah swimsuit but it's not a swimsuit
lemon
hello
welcome oh no wait wrong one
then you want to switch I mean redeem a
second one and I switched or something
okay I mean okay if you if you did the
wrong outfit uh
let me know and then I can just read
something that's no problem
I I I am that kind fine
um
I mean sure
oh yeah
[Applause]
was from
this is this elephant
but maybe
could you imagine you know that
creepy camera we could be looking at the
bunny in a swimsuit from behind
I mean
I I wish there was
and Visa was playing as Pom-Pom
okay in this game
yeah I do want to multi so
fun fun is in Crash foreign
okay you can slide on this detail okay
and now this
is
evacuated moment
oh why did I think
who doesn't want to see a kid but in a
swimsuit I mean yes you're correct no
that was close okay no more time to get
back I want to see a cute bunny that's
crazy
I'm just walking around in there
I met during the building scheme
oh oh all right yes that is true and the
mask is
at on the side of screen
but
that is true he's creeping in the
background looking behind
one now I see
now I understand him
yeah the mask is creepy
is it this side the question like
exclamation point method tracing is
don't you need all the crate yes that's
why I'm going back
how do you lose the mouse with this box
because I am
hung on the mask you say
did you see that study
I can't keep my mask for five seconds
am I licensed mask listen
thank you Daddy
killing other madinas Amadeus armadillas
Amadeus
[Music]
in Spanish and yeah and I cannot I don't
want to type on this
yeah I didn't kill them this time
so these are kind of in the way of me
getting across here
funny needs
bunnies smoothly bunnies
whoops how much was it's been on that
one or nothing
but I was in the air
yeah the stuttering is really getting
I mean that everything is off
or as of office it can be
I'm only running an rgtx 960m I don't
have anything but it's easy
it's a black top it's what I have
foreign
[Music]
okay
Navi
nice potato stopping by
be happy
compare this back
nice
Doctrine what is happening
[Music]
what is going on the game is even
running priority
you must be able to see the large
foreign
high performance
let's reduce the
encoder email further it's it doesn't
say that it's it dropped a single frame
and on this stream
but streaming Wise It's perfectly fine
because we can start to transmit
but hopefully
not too far into the future I would
actually get a access to a high
performance community
and then
get away from me
foreign
11s as much as I can
and my Superstar
I want to see yeah three four one two
three four one two three one
let's just
be another case of
Secrets crates that doesn't show up
I'm not sure
so it is not the second exclamation
point But
one one
Panic maybe I can reach this actually
no problem
and that was all the kids
whoa I didn't think
and that's the solution for this box
[Music]
got two Mark mates
I've got one more print and then last
one is every day
[Music]
um how could he say
[Music]
dawn of the dragon's combat was born I
mean I'm not saying that that games
combat specific is going I'm saying
that's the combat in
the combat over
well it's it's more like the legends of
Spyro combats as a whole is quite boring
I'm not I'm not a player I'm not I'm not
really for brawling games
so
in that case I shouldn't be playing
Legend of spider case
and I think the uh this one Donald
dragon is the uh
least fan of these three in regards of
the combat
many lack of health bars which I
mentioned and that's also means the lack
of funny names but that's not that's
departed me I find it funny
[Music]
and we should have fun on this team of
course
so
and
I think Donald's dragon has the biggest
issue of compared to the previous genes
when it comes combines because your
um
last night the thing I mean yesterday
all this time and
the uh
oh yeah you need science
in this in the dark dragons are so weak
compared to the previous things
relatively speaking of course and why
the abilities are much stronger he
wasn't as actively wrong
could misremember but I don't feel like
this the difference between the main
effects on the storm and elements but
that huge can you experience
[Music]
making you have to rely on
which they are very distinguished about
giving you
oh
about giving it green crystals so
let's just start now you can do this
so
whoever May Design This bonus level
let's say must have forgotten about
this in Spanish one this is a crash
abundance level and this is an actual
cash one bonus level
[Music]
yeah I don't I don't I don't
there is something I just want to move
slightly forward and just flies what
effects
[Music]
that is fun
you know what's a bit more beats one of
the best I mentioned to give brush
heads
oh yeah
when he gets
headstone
[Music]
here we go next
I don't think that one's more rich
I guess I would step on more and more
better than him like
burning turquoise and then
this one apart when I
how about the one where he's sliced in
half
after this this
looks like the part all right how about
when it's squished
[Music]
I mean I mean
whoops I get what he's saying that
he
respect
I can't
uh that was a complete noise at least at
least this game is more kind to this
Boulder levels foreign
or something else
I mean suddenly
okay I need to stop doing that
I would
I have considered putting up a
controller of the screen showing me with
something
it
it shouldn't be too hard
because yeah it should just be a plug-in
in because other people have done that
that's right a basic plugging in
obvious which I'm using
just simply highlights the buttons as
they are pressed them
[Music]
oh
I guess that works
[Music]
is that don't really need to take this
because the bowl there just starts the
right stick
and I just noticed this because the game
does freeze up happy yeah it's
stuttering
I would say this uh I don't feel like
this input lag and the it does that
stutter and
the inputs aren't really responsive
which is um
but I'm really trying to make it
work as great as possible
[Music]
celebration I got all the chains
just have one
voice records
oh
no he was quite excited that he would
show up after I
oh
[Music]
I just realized that I did skip the
dance but
that's giving that you can cancel the uh
if I was in collection
you need to beat repairing yeah but he
said everybody would show up if they get
fired
[Music]
he's giving a mustache
yes
more sequence Mass explanation and then
attacking
what is acceleration is
philosophy
with it
and velocity divided by time
wait a minute
vaccination is
n't it speed oh
it's velocity divided by time yeah
beat meters per second
time seconds
and if you don't mind meter per second
per second oops
no way
no
yeah maybe it's correct actually
I'm wrong I'm wrong it is
correct
all right confused velocity times time
that is sweet
you are smart
and getting distracted by
the questions
together
you can do that again
[Music]
this is much easier compared to the one
in first one I disagree
I mean
it's still an easy boss that has
but
it's it's too easy to make a mistake to
I think he's insane he is insane
all right
yeah he's basically destroying himself
but
I'd say it's too easy to make things
okay first section TNT
hello
how did he get stuck in stone the
festival pulverized
but now he lost his hair he had to fake
hair
you don't say
yeah has always been insane and it will
always been saying
laughs
where's cortex
that's cortex time or something
they've changed things
[Music]
um
foreign
[Music]
[Laughter]
I see that Ripper Roo failed to prove
much of a challenge yet again
but back to business
the planets will align shortly all 13 of
them and this will create a power great
enough to rip the Earth apart
properly utilized however the crystals
can absorb and contain the energy
I've been looking everywhere
everywhere tail units you have to be
careful trusting cortex seems a little
unwise crap I didn't keep the data back
open much longer
oh hello
and she's saying
[Music]
so this is the Box
13 planets yeah second planet
Mercury Venus as much
um
and it's like
there's a few
dwarf planets in our solar system I
think it is is Coco from Fantastic yeah
yeah it is
this isn't thought of fresh history I
did this is Coco from
Russia Corpus I guess I I'm thinking
that is
that's funny
to Cortex actually had slightly
different
close it
there's only five fence and then if you
want to keep that thing you should only
count any questions but
it's not Spike on the front
it's cheating
at a space knife
out of that case I'm ignoring me
I see my music please
it doesn't matter what yeah
porcupine
yeah those are babies
foreign
I think uh both endings should be blue
the sink bow settings are Canon crash
one let's use them because you didn't
say like
and everybody else went through
ASAP and
but yeah seeking knowledge
[Music]
becoming a professor or something
so I guess that one is Canon 2 but you
don't see the if there's characters
anymore anyway
you know we met fresh team but I haven't
seen the casino yet I don't remember
them
we'll get there when we get there
so I would assume that both endings in
all three games are Canon RC defeat
cortex and then you get around again
I like
I mean I did ask it to have it so I
guess I like it
perfect run up to your death performance
it up here
is that what it no it was a Chris I
don't know how do I tell you
that didn't tell the difference between
a damn fast one right and our best
platform when they're disabled
well I guess that should get the
password
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
the southern spit you get from the
Goosebumps
nice nice nice all right
I'm honest
I don't remember yet
[Music]
this next to me
I have not done these lash scene knocker
but it is sad it's the same
no it is not the same pressure it's the
same ones where the court is
[Music]
yeah yeah it's the same
I mean maybe you should be comfortable
in fact
I don't actually don't remember
I have to eat this to say they use the
same for them
[Music]
crash course
several times
pretty sure she can't
do this for the time
[Music]
oh
why did that cut the second bus
no
I can't see that drink again
but I can't when when I cut it and since
you can imagine
no
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
okay now I'm just messing up
[Music]
okay okay
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
nice to see you here
yeah
um
I am ceiling but that's that's that's
the part of my camera
I ain't seen
and I was standing on it really fun yeah
yeah really I need that
now I'm going
okay
this time I will do it
I'll show you
[Music]
and show you on
what I can do it
all right Daddy
see I could eat all right now
I'm yet to complete the salad
it's like okay guys okay
I guess so
okay I have the mask nice
oh you look creepy from the front they
turn around
yeah
[Music]
but then I didn't even get the other gym
I got the wrong gem
[ __ ]
wasn't that's like a colored gem
but I only got one color gem so far
in Canada and more
ten garlic gems make make everything
colored
[Music]
I mean I shouldn't get
focus and see character is not allowed
the writing
and no riding have run for extra speed
at the cost of control wait I don't have
a run button
well I don't need speed I'm not losing
attention
uh she tripped
but then fresh just
showed up some reason
jump and drums
and oops
I didn't do that
so um
anyway let's try again
skip this checkpoint setting
I don't know if it was
just test what I was thinking
welcome to the level of intentional less
I didn't sign it this way
foreign
let's pick up some
let's practice the remaining level
we have some okay
they don't make more mistakes
anyway back to
there we go back
not like that
[Music]
like that
okay
and again be careful enough bye
supporting my second place
be fine
what else guys
oh nice placements
whoa
behind me
all right that was supposed to
get to that secret platform
and I got the gym
I can miss the all the entrance the next
dimension of the old crash too is
trying to hear clockwise
what do you mean and cheers
it was a long time ago I may play the
original
it was kinda
awkward
I don't know
one but now I don't see that
anyway okay
it was a air crash there was a secret
platform
and outside didn't get all the crates
but doesn't matter I'll go for a secret
place
they're not that good for him a
different platform a suspicious platform
a platform you can get two but not from
therefore it's suspicious
any crash for it you can also change the
outfits so if I replace cocoa with
and fun fun
you have a similar structure of the
names
and they acted therefore make it about
this for quantum
now actually having the outfit changed
when you make your teams will be
possible but I could uh
that would be possible but as soon as it
change between levels
I can switch around
[Music]
oh
oh no
I can do it
I wouldn't put in here she wasn't very
easy right
I need to get to the one too like
outfits yes like if I was on the
I was stepping on the platform
he if we were counting yeah if you were
on a bet or something I wouldn't
napkins
[Music]
did you step on the screen I thank you
this is definitely they had me
who do we got
[Music]
broken is a swimsuit here
yeah I never said that before when you
ask me
I don't know
that's stuck on that phone
oh yeah this is so easy to be
this is
jump in the chess board
so
the
yay I got to the platform back to the
war room
back to the Department
two
or this is like that this video
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I need to get that back
I'm sleepy
anyone abuse okay back to that I was
trying to say
no you can't think as Coco on Crash
levels specific crash levels because
either there's two tea and yeah not
either because
I would say because they haven't made
animations for specific Coco
and
what else so Coco cannot ride
although you could argue that she should
be able to try to put a map because she
can write me thank you
I
are different and using different
animations or something
and similarly
it doesn't explain why cocoa
well yes yeah yes okay because
I'm playing Coco on Boss levels because
I would require a few
do the picture animations
obviously is that one
supposed to go here already
11. I'll go down and check this
I know this is the continuation this is
something weird
weird stuff
but purple can't do the same but it's
not the same as a different one
now what is this
oh completely
it is one pack
why don't we have some we have
because like every animation she has
been speaking
I would argue
I mean she's yeah yeah she can't use the
same yeah
exactly I said to myself because she's
holding the laptop that's that's so she
can't use the exact thing I wish
every animation must be custom made more
token
so the and they they've been quite lazy
with
15 yeah
there's a lot of test animations that
you can't say hi Coco you do
[Music]
the messages from cortis I can
understand why they need to switch with
crash
yeah I mean yeah
and the messages from my little
Christmas
[Music]
I
like this this is headed now it is
[Music]
interesting design
but there are
one okay I can only think of one neck
and level where the egg white crashed
yeah my crashes
in a special state which you can also
play as Coco and that would be the
airplane level interest three for trash
because cocoa has is one of her own
therefore you can play as crash and kill
for both of those times
let's go for under the hairstyles
animations
what
I don't think we just have don't be
silly
see what's that animation then
all right all right I was supposed to
switch to this one see
I forgot to say timing
because the timer was almost out 20
years
I really need to make it happen I'll
make it
so on a nice thing
and so one day I will get it automated
well what is this
one is nine
it's an experimenting a lot too
so when you do another theme
box stamp here
of course
don't crown
and that's why I guess
I can do this I can't change it
I don't know I don't know oh no I don't
know if that one is 20.
what what's
it requires custom animation
and apparently the polar bear and the
tiger are different
because crash can't ride the biking I
started sitting on it finally after game
is let's try not
thank you Rockets man
thank you thank you
so yeah it's a chain chain another chain
it's a shame that they didn't bother
making Toca available for the the
special first levels
thank you
quickly
open the door I want that
I'm close close
yeah because there is a
there is a swimming level
and I wanted them I think yeah that wish
would require them to make a swimsuits
for cooker which they should have
I want swimsuit cook
and then any crashed for it it's about
time they decided crashing cocoa should
be playable on all levels against all
bosses with no restrictions which is
greater there
but there is no swim 11 so
I hated those
so I mean yeah it's based on Crash dance
but it's still
animated Edition
the special GM hides behind something
fake yeah I think I remember that one is
this this early I thought it was much
later now
and this is the uh
before the work
wait what do you call it
no yes
forget about something
maybe it's fun
then because they're cute
hmm
I left with this mouse has some green
Artemis
isn't right not the mouse sorry about
that sorry about that threat
who designed he designs Black armor
yes not follow the
roots
that's nothing
yeah
you can see just people see me
like it's not okay
for rest
oh yeah you can't really spin this
is
[Music]
what now should I need to go back on the
way
but I can't contact that one
at least I don't have to worry about
this man
I'm using a mask
maybe I should have destroyed out there
what's the uh great
it wasn't okay
oh yes no this is before I went today
there was one thing that extensions
here
but I don't remember if there was any
place after thanks
at least you still have the gem yeah it
did follow spiral rules here
are still connected
another Spiral is even more than ever
that because inspiring
which
exit level and you still keep it if you
exit the crash level you lose it
oh very cinematic
Ally
lowest point of that
[Music]
I'm doing suspect
[Music]
please
it's not nope nothing okay
what a weird bonus
embedding me
[Music]
I'll check right next to the checkpoint
nope
right yeah you can't even speak
there yes
another one of these let's follow
um
wake up
I'm going to shoot that in front of me
first this time
sorry part I need to go but have fun
sorry for missing the last reminder
no one no worries no worries
perfect
don't worry about missing any streams it
is of course very fun when you're here
in chatting
it's
more people yeah
everyone is welcome
hi Jake
yes
you are adding different quantities
which is why I want
this time I should not make mistakes
exactly no you're not likely
okay
so
thank you
okay okay
nice
here we go
so it is some kind of
storage room
students
[Music]
on our timing section
okay in this
and say you can't do this
Lift Up Lift Me Up your legs
let's count how many times you have to
do that
physics and much faster in this game and
then
compared to
foreign
but I can still enjoy it playing again
I like to
because I like to like find Solutions
And discussing design I don't have
problems like these Catholic dishes and
coming up with ideas I've been through
it it's like I think that kind of stuff
my favorite reaction is basically often
if you don't like it why are you playing
it
but I like it
I mentioned on once
that's one annoyance with crash four is
that they put the insta kill the zones
and too close to 11.
so
there we go let's see
10 of 25 crystals you're on your way
I'm running low on power so
communication from this point will be
difficult
I'm counting on you
well what's the thing
so I got 10 of 25 this time he says
so I think yeah
see him like a double jump in Crash four
which you can execute at any time
anytime you've Fallen you can do the
dummy jump
this means that you could if you're
missing a platform and almost falling
down you can do the dump jump and get up
onto the pencil
except you can't because they're tasty
yeah
oh
my Killzone white too close and
which means
what
what are the nice then then
she
I mean
and my personal reaction was basically
yeah why would you play a game yeah
it's that kind of if I would even play
craft games if you if you don't enjoyed
that Tennessee
but I enjoy fresh things
[Music]
thank you
it's just
and it's it's not like the insta kill
zones are here during the game
foreign
but
um
it's just that
when did you when I land in a well hello
to Cortex what is careful
show crash
no it doesn't work again
remember the world is counting on you
thank you
I've been hydrating for too much so I
need to take a short break
it will take me
a minute or so I really need one I
really need a screen
hi Emily I'm here it's perfect timing
because I'm going to like a one minute
break because I've been drinking too
much
okay right back
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
I feel honored
and then monster to crash crashes a
little often
okay plant food
11 15 of 25 I guess 30.
what is that 2018
bosses
be the timer to add a special name oh it
gives you another one of these
another one of the
I don't want to do time to him
sure but
these diamonds have timers that you have
to be together
[Music]
I wonder if that
came after me said yeah oh
doing the these times for special gems
first and then they decided why don't we
just make time trials
[Music]
scene
is that special
or the research has left so he doesn't
seem completely mess they left this game
and I don't know I'm sure I get medicine
watching after my horrible showcase I've
seen anything
to cover your eyes don't look it's
horrible
I'm not a good child
when I get well I I think that's good
yeah surprisingly
without trying to complete levels
then I'll go for the special again
that I'm not seeing anything
that's that's really nice of you to sing
Vision all right I do have to find a
solution for the primary
but I guess I can do the same thing
there again
wasting a mask
[Music]
excuse me
we're about to 53
oh it's uh
never mind
if
you are a cute development no no no
never too bunny
got to respect your level twoness
try and jump on these bullets
pumpkin
okay
they're all mine
hello me and my
welcome again
it's funny when you're here
I was going to say that's not another
government from jumping and now the
design
with these plants eating
okay I got freestyle
[Music]
another spot and it almost looks like
it's it jumped standing position
that would have been fun
nothing to say
here here anime system
I was gonna say maybe I should jump out
and jump on this to get other foods but
you get a lot anyway
s
[Music]
okay anything
I need this special gem I cannot see
maybe special
s in this key can be quite annoying
because important remember this one
level
that way maybe those breaths could take
something
I actually don't remember where is this
game
I just remember okay celebration oh you
want to you want to be nice
and you want that nice coffee oh it's a
yummy
look at these times
[Music]
thank you you're welcome you're paying
points for it
purple cat is enough it's a pumpkin
okay let's do the timing is fine please
let's do this time at this time man
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
it's so cute
yeah you need your own emotes a popular
New York persona
maybe you should have someone make them
for [ __ ]

um
he was going to start in that when Sarah

kind of been short and Crush one back
everybody
please Mom
and that's the Polar Bear have any nice
to give no
okay no it doesn't
I'm glad that he said so
a nice device
slide in water
yeah
I think that's every time I respond here
I don't want to get there
does that means
[Music]
all right
annoying
I died
I feel needs
it's alive so maybe I should do the
bonus for the extra knives oh
a heavy Shadows
really gives me more of a cinematic
theme
so where's the cat
another way I don't want to affect me
so anyway
[Music]
[Music]
um beats quickly there
[Music]
I think that was 60s natural great so
[Music]

[Music]
I didn't even see that
wait why didn't you lift it up
holding it down for so long

Jam let's go back
because here we have these platforms
and a secret bathroom
island hopping
back to the regular outfits
I'm finally getting put on my dress
again
it sounds like a dawn
[Music]
perfect
anyway she managed to go out before
it changes
[Music]
I wish you instead instead of just
pressing up or down you could like and
up and down it's fine
but if you could like press a number to
get to a specific door if you have a
keyboard that is
which which I have
Row the two
it's nothing in that way uh Evelyn sucky
clear James often appear at the end of
this drop around

okay is that is that some kind of person
either one
in that case I said grow throat
foreign
[Music]
that one is very

that is that point
uh
only seven diable and exclamation point
close
nice straight sweet
and I
yeah I don't know what species of possum

[Music]
that's that's
okay
why is this so many places
okay
I still have the sound of this means
I'm so happy for you I would show the
strings to you when I get home from work
today this is great we spent so much
time making them
and I don't know how clean it was two or
three of them
because I do want to see them
yeah my only computer
um
Cash Time
hey
executed how many points do you have
I'm really curious
okay I wish I could think it's very
special to me
all right oh oh I see what's going on
here
oh yeah there is the bear that's
unbearable
very bearable unbearable bag
[Music]
foreign
that's scary
oh
damn
four out of four
thousands
this guy is I've lost everything
yeah you doesn't need gambling
situations
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
all right
oh that was easy
okay that man just
died
hey what's this
behind
and dead bye yeah I just fell down and
died
[Music]
oh hello cortex
crash my boy you are more than halfway
there
but I'm sure you've noticed that things
are getting harder the last 10 crystals
will be the hardest to gather and my
our enemies will be sending the
strongest forces to thwart you I'll
contact you again when you have
completed the next walkthrough
[Music]
let's not talk about things getting
harder
this
I think this is
okay
[Music]
another fresh
it's a little tiger
he doesn't pay attention to his
surroundings okay
[Music]
um
[Applause]
platform disappeared how could fight
into the water again
that's why
I don't feel like I'm Kitty
is a very big kitty though
all right he's gonna get back on that
one
I'm mad cheating
yep
[Applause]
there's a pen again oh silly and sucky
today
oh I made a mistake
foreign
yeah you can
just give me a bit soon sometimes
like what is this mean
I need three
nice job thank you
I think I need that nicely
not perfectly but
I'm cute enough I would say
and the game starts running so many
there you finally
and he's dead
all of these bosses spend it that night
I don't know
hanging out
worm Foods is that for the
fat jumping right after side with great
distance I've been doing that I'm
wearing food so like
you you kill a cat to make it into one
food
enough
nice outfit
I like it
looks so sporty
I like it because of the sponge bra but
oh that was a speedy one
there's a speed limit in here excuse me
I got them on
thanks
giving
words yeah when I first time I made
anywhere actually
hey hey
he doesn't like some
bad timing
but I didn't fall down the subject and
beauty of
that's so kind of thing
that's such kind of let's see
this [ __ ] I was gonna be too close to
that one
[Music]
but if I if I came up it's really great
that obviously means I was on the train
hmm
that sounds nice
okay time to not be a silly
there you go did not see the way of
doing it
twice isn't as fun as the silly way but
yeah
I'm really about to keep in my knives
so
comparative that's crazy
I'd say this game is easy if you just
want to see this but
quartets but
uh oops I Did It Again
foreign
perfect
yeah as I said it's a trick you could do
to uh catch up with this dream of
healthy
uh you can't I've been overseeing it
because apparently all you need to do is
possibly get impossible
and
that would sync it up back
[Music]
foreign
and that's the only part in the whole
game
you have to use that
that ability to lift up to raise your
legs
nowhere else in the whole game you have
to do that
you can still do it in class three but
there's no point in how to catch three
where you have to use it either
and everything is bonus levels of
benefits
I think that's fine
[Music]
celebrations
[Music]
I'm cute
wait a minute
wait a minute I didn't even get the
crystal
s
yeah I couldn't believe it's faster too
and maybe go with my straight and don't
spin this punch
or like yes I said
versus numbers and go straight to that
floor
I mean I haven't tried the keyboard
so
speed
I don't even see anyone
I was prepared for that one okay let's
do the level again without that secret
exit
foreign
spiral
I mean there's a lot of animators
inspired
so I'm at first this summer smell oh boy
another if you want to see a snow enemy
to inspire
I'll wait until it gets to take your
skin
there's a snow in everything in here
okay
next
quickly
which I will play afternaged
okay after Legends by the tree I will do
try
washable automation but
and we do enter the transfer again and
this time you can hopefully work
properly
you get nothing
and then after that um
and it's a fridge anything we can't help
okay my name was a secret exit which I
shouldn't go to
put it on Open sounds okay
I just want to make sure
points
bonus
and after a hairstyle I want to go
through all the handheld spiral games
thank you
starting season of ice
one two three four five eight
never played the Game Boy Advance
I don't know maybe they are yeah yeah
they're probably
yeah
it's just
it's just
yeah this is enough ice and seasonal
flame and then there is
final Adventure
time am I missing one of the games
yeah I think I've missed this by Fusion
oh no not that thing
different stream I will I will go soon
I'll touch it myself
he's really fun
and then it's a spider Shadow Legacy
which is the only handheld spiral I have
played but I only played it so far
around here I stopped playing it because
I got coffee and didn't know how to
resume
but
um
with a few people in chat
you might be able to assist you when I
get stuck
YouTube that's your name
is last time
you see everything is cute and after I
got gets through those Prime games
and that should be all spider games
every [ __ ] it is like a spider mobile
game
I'm gonna play that too I mean it's
probably really short so I could
probably played
obviously
not the original Hardware but
um
[Music]
you said I know I said nothing it is
kind of
this is a feature I really really really
dislike in Spanish they decided to
neutral credit shoot bounce I need to
jump over this so if I jump in the wrong
timing
seem to have a specific timing but some
of them seems to be random
another feature like a request game
that's
almost everything
and it shouldn't be the case this
shouldn't do that
it's a bad game design
I was on the platform
the game design
they should just not tell them explain
anything no but they should expect and
you should just not have them jump
that's it that's on
it's just it's the importance of that
I think they are glowing they are green
yeah
they're like pulsating
yeah it's quite obvious that
they are dangerous
I tried sliding but nothing happened
and then I jumped out
celebration
can I complete this
thank you
I think it's
and the gem
and be good
triple celebration
uh here's the chain
all right I still miss the crystal where
is the crystal
I might be like I never stupid
sleepy
I got it him at least
so I'll spending three minutes of ads uh
finally Crystal I must be blind since
yeah
foreign
[Applause]
bye bye
we talk more lately
I do like electricity picked more
English more because
they have made it so their hair gets
like burnt and face
I need to make
and maybe also that purpose okay like
fresh feeling here on the way it's like
fresh
where is the crystal
I've been playing 27 likes this is the
third time
okay
now twist down
we can walk fast
it's working past that one
you know Tristan
not this now
come on
Kristoff
we played 11 to find it this um
foreign
[Music]
kind of mountains background
most cases because they're quite obvious
I would have wanted people finding
systems it's probably more obviously
something possibly no classes
it makes us stand out the big boy
completely fine timing there
now
oh see the box is gone no it feels like
paint away
that was
thank you
a dentist
[Music]
yeah so okay let's see
borrowing avoids plants and bees but not
mallets
okay
bye bye and the celebration
whoa
is there uh
well
and these are not deadly
so
what else I think that I annoying here
everyone seems to shoot don't worry here
in another reason
um
[Music]
didn't even destroying half of them
foreign
nice placement
I'll continue
getting rid of the planes
if I wasn't there they can never come
plan something
it stopped
that's amazing
what
all right
what happened
[Music]
bonus level
which doesn't seem to be much of a
challenge
I think that's just someone put their
hearts put together for some level and
cause the bonus
hit me
no oh no activity bus
all right
December someone
yeah I guess
because the game had to be that picky
the swords is just so you can't walk
into it
the game should be a bit more effect
bigger
okay
I don't know I will never know
I mean we never know what that's okay
what
what
that's not how it works
that's nothing
[Applause]
thank you
oh nice
okay so they ate something okay
at least I got those two guys
and that's the what wait we
exploded by the yeah
foreign
[Music]
just want to do that what's that so hard
thank you
foreign
yeah I'm just walking past here
let me be
I don't need to do this
okay I can't do that even
okay sorry
they are big huge and
imagine anyone walking past them beehive
I mean one of five
even though it's
Pinkberry purchase bees
and they're not there lovely but I can
see that I wanted to say
maybe maybe
they are
what do you want it
foreign
11 flowers
yes you see
um
break fasting
yeah I probably have to do this for a
while
wait
oh yeah this is
wouldn't that be fun if I could do it
backwards
Secret
the Flora flop
but everything I will not sequencing I
mean it's more secrets how many
because as you find these sequence you
unlock
importance in the secret workroom
[Music]
what are you doing
the new space station something's not
right with his statement beware
Okay so
all of these are acting now
but this didn't
want more
Secrets I haven't found
[Music]
foreign
I'm getting tired
and I got stuck today
yeah see behind me
[Music]
and I completed
two
three and I'm on the fourth one at the
moment so I think this is a good place
sure yeah
basketball streams there ain't not many
people here so
churches I got to spend spend the day
and
yeah
let's and do a very quick event because
it provides you with points yeah it fits
for it and it also gives me some it
doesn't
[Music]
and I would let's let's just give me the
calf fantastic because I don't seem to
have done that before
stream so
okay very simply
[Music]
oh wait I see oh he has changed it to
only followers and subscribers can share
parakeet
I don't like that
[Music]
oh
I will
oh
as I don't want to send someone to a
chat because chatting because not that I
expected anyone to chat anyway because
most people don't search anyway it
doesn't matter and I just think it's but
but it's done like that
I went unless you know what his dream is
Raven I don't need to do it
and let's just do a regular goodbye
bye bye
[Music]
oh
[Music]
