hello oh there we go let's fix it
welcome everyone
kittens
it's nice to see you here
right here
unless you're falling asleep already
are you still welcome anyway
everyone is welcome
[Music]
that's a bit dangerous
[Music]
so this is a paragraphs button
it doesn't show your tokens
one of the tokens optional
optional but there we go that's a long
Fox
it can be three
longer oh okay whatever design should be
this time
I mean
Coco design could work but
[Music]
I could go with this one because I have
usually 36.
hmm
something different
no
where was I I did that now I did not do
this
taco part let's go talk bro
the sporty
too long no that's
that's the correct number of any emails
you can use but these double head
hey we let's party it's kind of
[Music]
ah
that's okay already okay let's see if I
can get used to
this game again
[Music]
[Music]
that's the first step to figure out that
[Music]
restart
I did not find this today here is the
idea I go to track backwards
oh there it is
[Music]
okay so it's like
here
okay let's see if I can do it then
okay
welcome with a bunny I forgot to say
welcome
everyone is here
let's see if I can
oh yes
[Music]
good boy
was on this thing here there it is
[Music]
and take all the letters
no my here take these
can't pass it on
my beautiful box upgrade okay
so now I just need to win the race
[Music]
yes
them
[Music]
that's a technique
[Music]
not sure how that
this side exploded without me taking
them
[Music]
oh nice
somewhere I can't something stand for it
but always I'm not really sure how that
works in this game
[Music]
Capital One
all right
like that
and a disadvantage using cocoa
who had you have here
last round
[Music]
kitten with the double-headed Fox
celebration yeah that was pretty easy
I'm actually surprised how well that
went
this however
can be a bit tricky
considering
[Music]
which makes it funny
so
that
Coco Park is really a terrible track for
Coco too
and obviously not to make that
implication but
I guess I guess they can animate that
indications because Coco is having a
slower cars with better attraction and
such
being the easier card to use
oh
it's the girl character
let me see Harrison
[Music]
okay yeah
the only thing I've ever seen
all right nope
[Music]
[Music]
intentional driving
distance
I'm not sure how am I supposed to get
those
yeah
well
I got the surprise time that's all I
need no wait I need
suffer good I actually don't remember
it's been a week since I played this
last around six days expectancy and but
100
completion
the gaming doesn't really make it clear
see
thirsty Mercy
and
here we go
at this girl okay so I need to I need to
debate
I need to go
ahead and go to the Princeton
yeah there's the girlfriend
[Music]
not doing like super great but
[Music]
you can evaluate
[Music]
a good gift somehow
[Music]
let's have this box
when I got it
yeah
yeah I need to make him happy like
all right
right
like a challenging trash
for being quite simple track at the same
time
yeah it definitely my speed okay
I think that was like a second okay or
something enough
doing great yeah
hmm
no you actually do it for all yeah
I do need gold another thing certificate
on this track I need I need some a bit
more technique going around these
corners and everything
[Music]
no
the worst thing that could happen
there we go
[Applause]
remember it's when I do try to speed
boy
I just missed the boxes
did the drifting I missed the boxes
I talked to the 15 here and pick the
boxes
[Music]
again
like
get rid of those boxes don't be a
challenge well I got that
and somehow
okay
[Music]
[Music]
no hey
I really don't have the technique for
this
it is going to be the hardest never
something because
I would say a high school
I wasn't even high school
so that wasn't worse the words that
performed so far
yeah this is this is going to be
distracted
[Music]
yeah I really need a better idea of
getting that one
and this game has a lot
lessons
there's like a lot of marketing how to
become racing
it makes sense it was
it was the area
Park races
[Music]
no don't mix every crate
thank you
[Music]
yeah that was the worst yeah I really
don't have the technique
for this game
this game is asking too much for me
[Music]
okay
that's no idea how to get those
Box Thing
and
my name is ELC
ie
yeah don't even have the ability to get
there
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
number anything
I really need to pick up that three
seconds before because I barely get any
any from anything from it on the last
lap
yeah
that could be like a 14 seconds it's
almost I just need to get to pick up the
craze slightly better than I'm doing at
the moment and I should be able to get
it
I need to miss less basically
at this one
still don't know how to get that one
we hit that once but
[Music]
I guess one of them
like basically got stuck in the grass
anyway so
it's like gain and seek from it
[Music]
whatever sir
one way of doing Heat
so
Australia
[Music]
okay
go go go
I was going as quick as I can
which is different really quick
but this last one
that's one minute 20 seconds is slightly
out of my range
[Music]
wow where did that sound come from all
of a sudden
all of a sudden I made it
and I mean I still need like one second
who care but
all of a sudden I got a really high jump
there don't you really get the physics
of this game probably okay yeah so close
[Music]
now come on
okay
okay
[Music]
that's how we can do it
thank you
go go go
there's nothing boosting
okay
well that worked I got the runoff thing
what do you think I need
[Music]
okay I'm doing much better now
I didn't want that boost ramp
s
[Music]
okay here we go
this time this time I'll get here we go
beautiful
[Music]
I really care about it yay celebration
new high score as well
look at those pixels and clean arms
okay let's take the Platinum thing then
let's see what
see how much I need I need to eat
[Music]
4.9 seconds
time to put on the dressing in
congratulations

49 seconds
[Music]
okay
missed that one but let's do the
scene
[Music]
let's find the lettuce first
oh it's raining

[Music]
I have to put my way

[Music]
what I need
but
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
all right
okay

some kind of
first
I should have kept the Boost
until that one

and then
I hope I get a mask for that one
either nothing

[Music]
I should have kept it

okay
I did something
okay
a little kitty yeah there is a kid
racing along
to make a secret okay let's see if I can
do this this time
now I didn't get a jump
might have gotten it without any foreign
trying this for the first letter
the second latte
depending now it's not camping
[Music]
no I missed it
yeah
it's ran out
hmm
that's another thing is I noticed yeah
gotta be a nice Bank okay
[Music]
yeah I'm nothing
that's fantastic oh turn hey get started
doing
the races oh so close
hey you don't need those
okay
uh

but
it is not going to help me
there you go
perfect
oh he's ran out
Minecraft maybe I can use that
nope
[Music]
so
[Music]
okay give me some
something
not peace
you can always try and it actually works
but in that case I'll take it
can take it I want
a city after but how am I supposed to
open that door in the time chart Maybe
I guess you're not supposed to take it
in Italian I'm actually happy that thank
you for that again
oh that's a bunny
[Music]
and asking me to remove my dress
[Music]
okay
third part of the celebration yeah you
can take off the dress

take off and take off your clothes as
you lose
between
come on

am I
gonna be back soon
Jimmy
they weren't that even
it could have been
something again
on my
okay got that one
I think that sells me
you want to do
a form of strip stripping game every
last two successful recipes
oh come on
and again
all right
um how does jumping is King anyway
okay I got
one minute eight seconds hopefully
that's the goal
but uh no yeah one skill then one minute
eight seconds
saving high score there we go
I'm an amazing high score let's
score
well I might need to say Kentucky
[Music]
nice thanks I got that
okay
now
rain
all right let's see
I'm losing everything now I've seen so
much better than the first first weekend
yeah now it's cut off that room
now I got that when I wasn't going fast
yeah I don't know at least 15 seconds
came away
oh it's so close
[Music]
every time I
went faster retire today
and now the jump right
yeah
that's amazing but
anyways there's so many boxes that was
missing
all right
okay
[Music]
thank you everyone
no don't miss the whole event online
completely
it's easy when you don't know what time
yes
I mean it's not like
it's not like I'm trying to do anything
different just because the time is
shorter
or like because I know the time doesn't
really changing anything
[Music]
okay
still trying to do this as quickly as I
can
my students names
foreign
right
[Music]
well
yeah hang on that was uh it's very
and that jump I wasn't too satisfied
with physics in this game is so weird
[Music]
sometimes
oh nice they got clothes
yeah which cook was compensated with
some like higher jump height or
something
foreign
[Music]
let's go
okay now I'll get it
yeah yeah

it's picking up crystals in a level in
an open level although he's Superior
Christians you know if you know
hey yeah hey okay
oh no
and now
okay
I see
this is going to be tricky again
you can probably picked up any
okay I see okay I have some ideas

apparently
question mark thanks
so I need to do a jump there
okay let's take them
[Music]
I can see it no problem
see I get it
let's shine another jumping
all right okay what kind of
I I was supposed to do the champagne

mysterious thing up for me

need to drop down the hole
they hold so I need to do that
[Music]
yep it's that one perfect
[Music]
what is this me is that one
trying to do something
this doesn't suit it gets connected
to me
oh this is so much easier to pick up
I know I lost one is fine
if I just didn't miss that one
ah so close to
broadcast to get these
like what am I doing
this is a dirty process question
[Music]
when it's working like
[Music]
okay
it doesn't have stuff he's a bit weird

I guess
they're basically not that one
this is the bonus
so there are the three tracks then
[Music]
they didn't show that like the golden
running
because I didn't get that one
back with the dress
okay let's see
one minute five seconds I should be able
to do that
wait stop
I thought I disabled
every
a shortcut why is that shortcut
wait I disable the shortcuts in another
the other software let me
I'll just change the shortcuts in this
then
mixing up the project
maybe there isn't a way to change the
shortcuts or here we go hot keys

potatoes
foreign
[Music]
[Applause]
quickly
I got it I'm still not getting a good
time
it was actually worse yeah what
not already
I got one minute six seconds before
so I mean getting one minute five

post
[Applause]
why am I so slow

they're not making good jumps properly
I got a bit tricky today I got nothing

it
[Music]
I missed
all right
okay okay
[Music]
[Music]

it's the same
the same last time here

they switched the order on this the
sunscreen
they're kind of confusing
the celebration yes I didn't
I'm happy with that
that's
all good
wasn't that big I think great you've
earned A Relic
I did not really indeed wait
they were Speedway
is this one
[Music]
it really should be spending a little
bit earlier but let's do another
relaxation
[Music]
let's see how easy this is let's see
what the gold time is and what my time
got was
I guess it isn't that take it to get
done when I get more into the game
one minute five seconds that means that
I got one minute six seconds and a bit
more
that's how it works right
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
finish work
okay okay
no missed that one
oh my God and I got that one nice
one
[Music]
yeah I'm gonna show away practice
all right
now
welcome Rota
The Dark Knight
welcome
I'm a bit during
[Music]
relics at the moment
I'm doing my best I can
this track is a bit confusing to me
[Music]
it's like boxes on a platform I'm not
doing this here and I'm supposed to get
to
again
[Music]
[Music]
um
using everything
definitely missing everything
he's gonna explain
I mean no
I'm not sure how power management
okay
shortcut
I mean
right
these aren't watching
all right
okay there is something
I was thinking
[Music]
I think that's more interesting
foreign
[Music]
there's something
suspicious
now
yeah
it's good
yards enough kids
what about the other one
if you like
that's your participate
I don't know
I'm using anything
no
perfect
when all right let's check but mine I
must
hey
[Music]
bunny tiny
and it's kind of like inspired
party okay
and have a lot of people know shortcut I
mean yeah yeah
I mean I'm sad and a lot of people know
the Joker but I don't know about the
consequences
I know but uh right
now yeah but the shortcut being a pain
doesn't mean this course is the way
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
long way
that sounds terrible
parking
maybe I don't actually need too much
wait
wait
to do that
nice
whatever
okay nice
that was the worst shot oh wait um
chicken
[ __ ] is I don't got me still
I don't know that yum
this is
this is some
some weird gem
attention like
I don't even know how I'm supposed to
how am I even supposed to keep a drift
in there
the tunnel is kind of 15.
the road is like going the wrong
direction
all right
okay boxes
and also why did my jam no wait first
time I tried this my name is supposed to
jump
okay something like that
oh wait
now
it's not
[Music]
yeah maybe he's
a short guess
it really is a pain
yeah if I'm lucky I might pull it off
but I have no skills authority to do it
thank you
yeah look at these skins
apparently any champion on been doing
nothing soon I don't even know I don't
even know when I'm supposed to jump
I don't care I don't I don't I haven't
really learned the physics of these
games the accident
foreign
it just seems that depending on when you
jump which
the Heights is different which of course
makes perfect sense but the
it just seems to be having too much and
effect
[Music]
watch YouTube I mean I could but
you don't really get one
okay
watch out other people do it so I
all right
see that's
if she doesn't need YouTube she got the
fidgets
yeah I don't need YouTube
[Music]
oh yeah let's do it but one one hand tie
behind my back
oh that was the worst jump
good
I'm going to be stuck here for
everything
[Music]
all right
well I guess we're taking this part now
and I missed three seconds
thanks
[Music]
I don't even know what when the first
started to check yesterday
uh I'm messing with everything now
[Music]
everything
[Music]
thank you
you're not getting all right distance
I can't do it
[Music]
I can't even do the rest of the track
why am I supposed to do that jump
position
please
one and two shaft here right
that wasn't that hint that was a cryptic
message I had to be coach first
off
beautiful that was
that was just amazing
[Music]
but I guess you can do that
[Music]
heads
foreign
[Music]

[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I'm not talking about him today

what I'm doing on the final left
[Music]
yeah yeah
now I can do it let's let's ignore that
stupid shortcut
I can do it without it
I'm a journey now I don't need
I can dance without the shortcuts
[Music]
[Music]
stupid shortcut
[Music]
oh
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
that's for continuing at the moment
[Music]
meaning myself
oh what
that wasn't perfect
this is four seconds six seconds
technically seven seconds because then
it's one of those who refused here
oh man
seconds
to see if I just didn't miss those boxes
I wouldn't have gone by now
We Believe see everyone believes me I
don't need that shortcut I just need to
be a slightly passion even though I've
been better than this previously but
I can do this I just need slightly
better timing
and less missing boxes
[Music]
speaking I'll just be driving I plan to
start
come on
but I think that
[Music]
no
no
I found the gate started
justification
oh man
until
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
finally
[Music]
didn't go that question
but no
I said I won't take the shortcut
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
hang on
[Music]
hey
[Music]

with one thing
and I didn't
oh my God I'll see you now
[Music]

seven seconds now
[Music]
[Music]

better go watch your my lips
are doing it I'm really getting better
at the game now
yeah I'm going too close to that one
okay I need to
I need to decide if I'm going to turn
left there I need to be because I can be
a very very turning
strategy
doing such things
jumping between spices

hey guys I can't do any
I just need to fade slightly slightly
less time
and I will have guns
like if I take the two the two instead
of one okay I'm messing up the stuff
okay
yeah I just had to be slightly less
better but like if I didn't miss the one
box that started the race and pick it
too
can I Pikachu over the one
a slight decision or whatever even be
killing there
and I was
I couldn't really decide which way I
wanted to go so I went no way
keep jumping on me

[Music]
sanity
kiss this planet book
is it that that is coconut
let's go
but
coconut isn't that what
I'm sure you can't skin drop back down
but if you drive just a bit further yeah
probably drop down to any point

those at the same time
but I think that
oh
right
you say I'm happy for not nothing else
for the wall save me
all right I guess I take that next to
Captain
