foreign
hello
I didn't plug in the microphone again
embarrassing again
for like two hours and never taking the
microphones plugged in
here now let's get hello with him in
first as you should
do you want a cookie with that
and the Red Dragon 69069
number twice
afternoon pon pon how's your day been
I've been cleaning today
a strong solution that I got warning
that it would ruin the pattern on the
floor but it's not strong enough to
actually remove the
dirt on the floor so it how is it even
supposed to
dream independent if you can't even get
to the pet any diversity
the key do I
I don't know maybe you're the one that
doesn't like cookies some it only
depends on what kind of cute kitties
that you try or try on try a singular
okay
that's a cookie in Sweden
and it's tasty
I like it a bit too much
there'll be moments behind so one
question I've been asking here like
should I just flick the chat so the
challenge that appears at the top but at
the top and then they're pushed down
behind on
I've been thinking of that
and maybe I should just do it
cooking punish
I'm just
let me change that and to be honest
that's probably something I should
change as soon as possible
[Music]
so people are using new formats because
when I change to
over to the 3D model
let's create something as I mentioned
before
and currently the chat is set to begin
right above one percent it's slightly
behind One content now it's actually
touching your hair at the moment
but uh
when I have this 3D model and move
around that's obviously not going to
have a fixed Point anymore
so
[Music]
like a Sweet Child version too
numb wait what is that
Nom Nom are the global tweaks you know I
don't know all in the global ones
so let's see do I have
measure limit zero
they offered to
minutes
try it in Fade Out
wait where's the direction a line
messages bottom top
okay
now it's a fresh write a new message
I get to do that too hello
oh yeah yeah
did you show up it's just
there we go there they are
apparently I got another give some yes
you did someone it was on
on yes at that she's Channel I would
stand when it happened
someone just threw out 20 gift Subs all
of a sudden even though it's not the
it's not the sale of gifts up yes yeah
[Music]
this one
oh wow yep and I didn't get one I was
there I was active I saw the 20 Subs I
was chatting before that I was chatting
off that I didn't get one but you did
I'm happy for you though
you don't have to
no it's fine it's fine I don't need
I don't need adaptive subscription
[Music]
news
I mean she has interesting events
I do like the cat once instead if I had
to choose
do you like the foxes are they like the
cats
because you can't they're loving cats
oh hello red dragon again
so do you like do you like to have this
yeah I think I think it's something you
have to get used to of course but I do
think it is better without the short
message appears at the top of the chat
and then they're pushing back behind
ponton
I do know that there is a lot of
streamers that have the chatman's
appears around bottom and go up and
but when they have them up here behind
the model as and I do and some other
streamers do
I think that's you speak now is speaking
of that [ __ ] I think
she is one
of them who do that
yeah I like to send my books see me yeah
I think that's if you liked it
foreign
what
[Music]
okay and there's one thing one thing
let's fix this
[Music]
um
let's switch over here
uh yeah the music did appears and let's
switch over to the final this screen
I need to make this one that is one
that
of course the countdown
so
everything has been organized now the
chat box has been fixed
it's nice to have that done no
so
I will duplicate these three things
one-point body boy shorts and bow
because now
is everything Yep this thing shows up
here
because I'm going to do the school last
week which I'm going to replace the era
Torah
prefer
so here it is let's do some more
preparations
now this would be called colder
[Music]
boy shorts
and bow
let's see how many is confused Bunny at
least there's an animation for when
check messages appears in my clear
animation so and a message to stay up
for two minutes I could make them appear
for longer if you want
do let me know if I should do any
changes to each chapter I'm open for
making changes like there's a slight
AF
s and
finger to pointy
there is a and it can have a pretty out
screen but it is a slight uh
Edge there and which does not touch but
it does touch the edge here
and then there's a gaps here and these
are perfectly defined there there's a
gap here maybe I should remember that
well at least she has clothes on today
she had that corn last night hey what
are we talking about
animation you mean the sliding effect
exactly that is an animation
until just clearly show where the chat
the new chat
[Music]
it's something some sometimes uh chat
messages instantly appears on screen
and some strings
let's say and sometimes it's hard to
know where I thought you might see
inside of them it works when I have few
messages
I guess the animation needs to be
quicker if I have more energy
yeah let's speak
pirate thingies this is why I wish
marriages
[Music]
let's see
I guess it would be a blue boat too
all right all right because she has a
ball with this album
save that
uh yeah I'm gonna make a new
I probably can't do that now
I don't know what else to add to the
chat box because I don't know what I
mean the I mean it doesn't matter what's
available or not
because I mean action code
[Music]
I can't count okay so I need to create a
folder cocoa
is it Pera
I guess like purple
a little pair in Tiger
and then it's called Persona in the game
there you go his her second place
see
oh yeah another side of the previous
window that's what that was missing
leaving the girls I can see what I'm
doing
I mean I can see what shows up like that
on screen
and we can see
a bit
I have replaced it pirated paint good
job one point
I replace times per there you go
oh yeah I don't have that one
I need the M textures one
perfect and
refresh
but it should be set linear
this is r r like a pirate but now it's
Pera
linear
and finally
and
in
after all it's going to have the boys
shorts that's part of this because he's
wearing a skirt
with this outfit but I'm going to make
now
it was a full swimsuit she was just
wearing her boy shorts over the
swimsuits you know as you do
bang it's cold in here and the stone
directly underneath the oven it's
perfect it probably doesn't help me no
you don't say
but I'll be going to the store soon
maybe 20 minutes from now and therefore
you won't look at her underwear even
though you can already see her underwear
okay let's put cinematic underwear on
oh 100 sure Hello Panda
welcome what a surprise to see you here
you can double down the way
yeah and you know she's not my hair
bra but she would just buy a shadow I
think so
I should start with a skirt probably
so I got a reference skirt again
and I would have the
I think I should have the bow on the
back side of it but this is just from a
different model from my game I will not
copy this card earlier only if she
doesn't
so
power out of here
it's great and got some cleaning done in
the morning
even though
it was a lot of work
so how high up should short skirt be
placed anyway
like
here
but yeah that makes sense because in
that case it kind of goes
that's it yeah I don't know I guess
Haley's just going to give us really
keep forgetting that she has to take
Anton why do you have a team
let's copy that
like that
and then I would I do want to make
plane
add a plane
what is it is it that tiny
there we go
okay
there oh a bow in the back yeah yeah I
think I think she could have bow on the
back she does have a bow on her dress on
the back which you could maybe kind of
see before her dress was down
I
will cry if you okay now though yeah
you're not tired now right
I don't think that's having grammar
you're not died now right
so I've got two planes
so
no wait
there we go no no no way
that section is being me
asures I should have placed the plane
here actually
okay
so
and I think this thickness might be good
but I do want to move it down
yeah maybe I should have used
used to front as
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
sounds a bit scary
yeah who who's whose job was it to
supervise that thing
do you have someone to complete
no
intersect bowling I think oh oh look at
this this might actually be
let's see
I guess swap
the Union
defense the difference is the only one
that swap works on
okay
I'm happy with this
weird having a command available for all
of those when it only works on one of
this
okay this
okay actually maybe I don't like that
[Music]
am I still missing a part
no I didn't get
[Music]
[Music]
and then once you remove these these
points
that I don't need
because I only want the ones that I
want to eat this sections at the
yeah I think those comes from the drank
Nation
[Music]
there you go and then this song of
vertices
and now
[Music]
I should be able to delete this
and then I do want to empty these only
faces there we go
it's beautiful isn't it
I have no idea who loaded it only into
the trailer of by the vendor because we
don't have the equipment necessary to
load them in the trainers oh
yeah I don't think you can really
listening
yeah it doesn't seem like a good idea
anything as a door
foreign
oh man that sounds scary I'm glad you're
okay though yeah I'm happy you're
you are fine
that sounds
very
hairless by the person who's singing
again the thing about the pair of people
working with the stuff here
like
[Music]
please think of the people
seriously please think of people
you're you're your laziness could affect
someone
[Music]
so I guess some of these uh
I can't see
well no not not that far
hunting again that's my name
is gonna work
Friday
so far the heaviest object that hit mine
in the hand was on 18.
um
36 million bucks from about three feet
no and one media up other than supposed
to be up there but it was
I wasn't looking forward to an object
between minutes on the other training
[Music]
um yeah
your this job sounds scary
I'm happy but okay
all right let me know if there's a tool
like it for this because I can't select
multiple
but then it looks like this this is what
I want
I want them to move into individually
let's leave multiply them and then
there's too many together whatever just
select this Ah that's what I can do
okay so I can do it a bit cutie
and lines anyway
you save me some time but I still have
to do twice
I think what lines everywhere
all right that one went the wrong way
that means that have been normal the
last one is the only way around here we
go
some reason
panties don't look at the panties
she's only scary when people aren't
doing the job correct yeah
yeah I mean to be fair
and that wasn't me her original so yeah
then I have to go see this doesn't say
with this job okay here I come to do the
individual scene
um
but if you have seen The Incredibles
you know
so hey
you know there's one fact if you can
turn invisible
but I've seen at the very start of the
film
not creatures not as funny if I
mentioned stuff in the film
and she possesses the ability to turn a
misspelled but not her clothes because
this does not have a magic box it's the
same in um
same in fantasy sport
actually
but then she's given a special suit that
can turn invisible alongside her
but that does mean that
[Music]
she she must only give in a suit that
means she can't then that was about to
defend us before I even made a
references the only way I wouldn't go in
Isabel so that's going to be
embarrassing
it would never be that would be a Comics
to make girls fun fun
she she turns invisible hairs special C
turns invisible but I'm not here anyway
so now she's just underway walking
around
and they did now yeah primarily that
with peach she was able to turn
invisible for a moment but not to
address
yeah that's fine
but she didn't she wasn't given a
special dress that turns invisible with
her leaving her in on me I'm very
visible
but I guess they don't wear underwear
underneath that red dragon near their
outfits then in that case
officially confirmed
[Music]
yeah that would still be
[Music]
a funny comic
to draw appointment
system is returning with ball bats
dress is turning visible now
with the ability of the redeem
now peace had to take off a close enough
to sneak around the valley visible in
the marketing
oh my did you see her on this
[Music]
morning for explicit you know
[Music]
[Music]
So speaking of great things there have
been people like you said like oh
I I like I like the levels I say like
[Music]
I've seen that someone's like oh I like
the preferred letters over the numbers
yeah but these are there's a reason why
Europe goes with numbers instead of
letters because how would you even find
a letter that stands for for example
everyone or adults if it's going to work
with every single language in Europe
that's why it goes with numbers because
numbers are Universal
behind a transition and you see our
trusted Russell okay
well then I guess
do the thing
so every point is done there let's let's
oh yeah I need to
be nice it's here inside the pain
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yeah it's a service mattress is quite
interesting because when they released
brawl and that was but because it's a
Japanese game so brawl it's super Super
Smash Bros are made based on the
Japanese rating system and then whatever
I think appears in other countries it
doesn't really matter that's not of
their concern
and so when when Brawn was made when
Peach made her debut debut debut now she
appears in the mainly sorry
foreign
[Music]
you can see her underwear in the game
but if you try to look at the trophy
that exists in game the underwear is
hidden
even though you can just go into the
game and look at her underwear just fine
that's an interesting decision I made
but not only that
because if that if that was all that
that would be
um
why are you doing this
yeah I don't know what to miss
yes I'm doing one at a time
[Music]
in the next game Super Smash Bros for
3DS and Wii U
unless you preference hey and that was
between bro and 3DS and they it's Sarah
the Japanese reading board
I decided that in the lowest rating you
cannot have underwear showing at least
not like I'm there like you can't have
upskirts or anything like that that's
that's not an everyone everyone's not
anything that's not an A or anything as
they call it even though it's perfectly
fine in other countries
and mainly one of the traffic does sure
okay maybe one of the trophies does but
not like Main Beach Trophy and same in
Brown
um
[Music]
but yeah but yeah so in 3DS and Wii U
therefore my pitch was censored in in
that game
[Music]
because no longer look up her dress it
was just a black void
and because that was the Japanese rating
required
yes
the game is rated in illustrating in
Japan
[Music]
um however
boy
however the trophies because that game
also had trophies
both versions
for the trophy they decided to to have
two version of it it's two version of
the texture one for Japan which is
censored with one international which is
uncensored so so now the pitch is
censored in game or like in the battle
but you can look at the trophy and see
her panties
she becomes a Badness bloomers and as I
said that's a weird I think
[Music]
why
oh well we can't share her underwear in
Balance I guess we have to do that and
trophy
which is the same form in that game
there's another trophy which is
101
where the pink one has their panties
showing on the truck as well which is
also also another one censored in Japan
and yeah you can get rid of Amy Rose and
Cream the Rabbit and they they have
their panties showing as far as I know I
have and there's no censoring of their
panties even in Japan for some reason
because that's apprentified I have no
idea how these rules works it's so weird
I know I'm talking about panties
and that's that's that's
talking about panties right
but I'm talking about more like in
intend this ingredients we had a
decision made by Developers
hey good afternoon and happy Sunday
hello
sorry for the weird conversation
and there you go that's whatever place
it so same like sport but this will be
tampanges it's a good thing right
yeah
and they could
I don't know how it works in Wii U
H because in Brawl what they
no no no no no yeah yeah in switch
now yes I know how it works out we're
talking about the inconsistencies of
Japanese no the Japanese sensitively
consistent in in in in in in Japan Peach
was censored both on the trophy and in
game
it's the international version that's
weird because before this censorship
itself it was censored but not I don't
meant to say inbound the trophy was
censored and intel was uncensored but
after Japan required censorship
the trophy was became uncensored in
internationally and in battle model was
censored because that one was the same
for everyone so it was
because they apparently didn't want the
the textures of the which is really
that's that's what I find so we had rice
and Peach
obviously I'm not not to ask for it but
some characters
such as the red costume for Captain
Falcon changes name
and changes textures if you're playing
in Japan or internationally
so why does not Peach censored up skirt
become uncensored internationally
and I'm not saying they should defeat I
just find it weird that they didn't do
it because the developer Sakurai is very
Adventist static term to have a peach
panties showing
he wants he wants them showing
and he's like what is the only clothing
why do you why do I need to censor it
cute
[Music]
but yeah that's Smash Bros and then in
specials or switch Smash Bros ultimate
stayed and got rid of all the trophies
anime so
no more trophies
oh yeah I'm looking around slowly
resources Bass
[Music]
at Bixby against
so let's switch over to
uh I think only when you had that trophy
because I don't remember seeing him soon
yes
which trophy uh because both versions
should have the trophies of the each
fight right
let me
[Music]
like is me not being here up to me
thank you
[Music]
which is one of the things I didn't like
about Donald Trump is
I can understand like it it wasn't too
much at work anyway because basically
what it did was uh
let's see
[Music]
they just yeah
this is Kura and this is
Google girl she's got to become a school
again
[Music]
there you go
that's what I now I need to replace them
anymore
I think all of these actually
[Music]
I can understand what I was talking
about we're talking about everything
um
all right I need the underwear though
boy shorts
[Music]
there you go that was actually going to
be showing showing
boys
what is the game rated in
Japan
let me take a quick look at that let me
take a quick and do
foreign
[Music]
a okay so my mod would not be
appropriate for the Japanese rating it
would be it would be rated 0b
[Music]
sorry if I disappear I'm perfectly fine
and I respect you and whatever you know
I'm letting wife sleep in and taking
care of he knows the dogs yeah I
understand you got a lot of stuff to do
and take the time you need I'm happy for
any moment you're here chatting
I mean when I am when I'm watching your
stream because it's extremely kind of
late sometimes I I kind of disappear
when
but you always stream late I disappear
when I fall asleep
mainly I had the best traffic out there
because you could zoom out and see your
entire collection is now looking at one
perfect Broadhead that team
printable headaches
I can't say about no Wii U had that too
I think as far as I know each of those
games had it
[Music]
maybe Wii U didn't attack it actually
maybe we actually had no now that I
think of it it's we probably had uh
groups where you could only look at the
group at the time a brawl had it
don't look at my sketch it is going to
be a bit tricky like a prescribing game
but there will be moments
apart from making lewd mods no it's only
rated as slightly higher
is the bunny suit
that's probably that's right that's a
bit naughty
I can't remember Randy that yeah bro
must have done that I've only remain
mainly I could mainly did that melee had
like in the house Brown had on our
donors for some reason
so yeah
my mod will not be ready sir I mean
[Music]
in Sonic games where you have peach and
cream flashing their white panties all
the time that's perfectly fine
foreign
a short dress and one of her moves is
her doing like
uh lip a spin I don't know it's called
in English and you can see upper dress
and they had I could save certain States
panties
it kind of looks like it and that's
perfectly fine too that they are very
inconsistent about the rules regarding
panties
[Music]
so two hours okay let's see
120 Minutes
[Music]
go
timer is running
foreign
it's it's cool uniform
there's a reference image
I've used
this
screen I guess
so which design I'm going for
or is he obviously it's a picture I'm
going to make it as 3D so I'm obviously
cannot just a PDP okay so I I can't I
can't think anyway Tracy
because that's impossible and
so and let's place the Meetup screen
so this is the drawing I'm going for so
it will be
okay what is my appointment here it is
yeah and so I'm gonna be the pink skirt
yellow
uniform shirt with the pink color and
pink bow and I'm going to help people
behind too I think that would be nice
and of course a pink box
ping ping ping ping
so that's the sign I'm going for
it probably smacked that tennis money
I'm actually starting to think that
because that peach design and the same
as a Cream and Amy they don't have any
details it's just plain maybe that's
okay but peach in a brawl
like in Smash Bros they have actually
added the details decoration stuff and
maybe that's where they draw the line
yes
it's hard to contact these companies too
organization and ask them
see especially we're going to ask them
how that's pen it's anyway I guess
that's enough talk about painting
there we go here's one I want to see if
I can mix together a good thing if I use
this pink
and this pink
foreign
take this pinch
can I get this page
that's not like that like this
when it doesn't get pinch
let me do a quick
look for
just starting
that pink I like that's a bit too strong
and that's Victory DMT I think this one
works
[Music]
let's
let's take another account
like this pink
this is still looking a bit I mean it's
going to beat it in here
it's a bit lighting
what is that
now mix together four different shades
of pink
I go with this pink I think it's pink
[Music]
anymore
[Music]
like that
[Music]
so now I will export it and see
what does someone call me for me
hey Pura season yes
[Music]
down
so if I refresh this there we go and it
also remove the bra it's like something
to be part of this anymore so this is
the band
[Music]
that I will I guess attach the Bell to
somehow the problem in high end now
[Music]
bring up the skirt
so
let's cut like this
[Music]
um
and this is going to be a bit tricky man
I'll do my best
as I usually
my best
[Music]
another question is how long it should
be let's bring up everybody shorts
there's obviously you need to be longer
foreign
[Music]
front
and like that
would be a nice shade to have
[Music]
yeah it's now I should have the
[Music]
look it's already a skirt
[Music]
let's call this one lately
and then let's
let's separate these and call this one
great
yeah I don't have cocoa
with the dress it's
[Music]
important cocoa with the dress
[Music]
and that one is called
[Music]
right time last night
take care
oh
yeah I don't mean skeleton
thank you
now because I'm replacing M1 which one
is this it's hard to tell but it's
clearly using because of the pattern
but this must be
foreign
non-shiny this
is the High Point Let's shine yeah
doesn't matter what Mary is just scared
it looks like this
I didn't want to measure some things
like
distance here
25 centimeters okay
and she does him about me actually
my records I'm gonna take this bow
I'm going to land this Bell
because after all I'm making mod based
on
Poco I can make the assets
not based on Cocoa maybe I'm not
replacing your cup
like difference
and
I like this part
they get everything in almost
this one is that should be amazing
but science
that should be amazing
so
it can't come in handy
it's so interesting probably checking
more
[Music]
how long this can actually be if
something
but hash cat is more consistent
in a way it's shame
it is a bit longer in front but
and it's about this one that was also
what I was taking how why did she be
I'm gonna have portions of going through
anything against
[Music]
extracted
namely a
like
[Music]
yeah
she has panties on their skirts how does
that work
paintings
yeah don't look my panties are showing
this kind of goes in like this
I'm just gonna go in like that and that
[Music]
yeah when you're
modeling a skirt there might be a a few
penny shots
[Music]
yesterday
[Music]
and then I apply mirror
[Music]
pants are over
[Music]
because she's
sounds sweet
[Music]
all right okay now you can press add
skin
so
[Music]
[Music]
it's easy a bit I mean let's focus on
this side okay
so it goes in like that
[Music]
thank you
foreign
like that
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
I'm trying to make sense
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
how much does it
not even my shirts it's so much now
yeah I probably have to
create
additional reading sound
I want to take care of the lady
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
buttons
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]

[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you
okay yeah so this is let's make sure I
get
no
thank you
inside the reference and it's been good
I think
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
a simulation line like this
maybe I should asked
triangulate everything
[Music]
and then check like
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
no run
let's let's bring at least
these are kind of straight
[Music]
maybe they don't need
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
you think
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
runs
higher up on the sides I could
do that too that those sink would be a
bad idea to do actually
please
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
clipping
for their best to lead stand

[Music]
make a copy of it again it's three and
same thing
foreign
[Music]
let's see the
upper part here they should already have
the
valleys Mighty Donuts
um interesting
well step one is to
apply a data transfer
in that case I saw that I should have
kept those values but yeah maybe it
doesn't but yeah because I did the
cutscene
the intersect apparently that one
doesn't keep the weight values for some
reason even though you should
it might have kept the weight values
from the planes instead of the
the other thing
no problem
let's do that
Edge interpolated
that should be fine
okay let's see and then the usual is
this
and my name
warmth roots
it does have a really really tiny vanity
there
but we don't need to find the values
presentation is today and then away
normalize all don't you look anyone here
we go
foreign
matches

Maybe
where are the seams on a skirt like this

I'll export this as the attempt
and I went back here
where I will add it to texture
yes so I'm what I'm doing at the moment
I can show you too is this outfit
yeah yeah I'm only taking inspiration
from it I'm not going to make that exact
outfit
[Music]
I I keep in the churches
oh a lot of people showed up all of a
suddenly
oh he removed my dress and then everyone
came hey
so what's going on here so let's dress
this up here
we need to take a closer look of what's
going on or researching now
cheers
coming in with rings and everything have
you noticed a difference would you chat
by the way
[Music]
another huge difference but maybe some
difference
okay yes
[Music]
the chat on screen pops up in top when
going down instead of up
f is true yeah yeah because yeah as I
mentioned before now a few times I do
like the idea of actually moving on to
using a 3D model
and I probably mentioned this and then
you probably heard this many times now
and that
the chat was previous
[Music]
moving on
the because I placed the chat so it
would appear
and right above Bumper's head which is
fine when one is static but this Pawn
point is going to be animated in 3D
which tracking everything there's not
going to be an actor at the top of her
head anymore so
[Music]
I will instead make the chat go down
down behind
[Music]
he's a cute idea
foreign
[Music]
so I'm going to do something about that
[Music]
so what I'm doing
viewing
[Music]
is that
more space basically
I don't think it's mayonnaise anymore
[Music]
I will make my own Fun Fun City Mall as
requested by people
with a bunch of outfits I'll make I will
probably maybe at that point I should
have a redeem where you can request an
earthquake
I'm in feet

I mean I guess
foreign
[Music]

I mean you could see but I guess I guess
I could

on a different server
I guess you can get there and see it I
guess I could show it send you a photo
of myself you know what
um
okay you know what I'll send you because
I'm I always you know like to show
photos of myself much personally in
private obviously you would keep it I'm
trying it I hope
thank you
very interesting with the
what is
your dress sending it over
I haven't considering if I should post
it on my own server as well
[Music]
so same in texture
going back to blending
[Music]
here
update
girl look at this
[Music]
what's important is these buttons
I'll give you my input if you wish I
enjoyed
[Music]
I mean if you want I did
yeah
they're pretty
but yeah ready to write it on the
in the chat
[Music]
unfortunately
put on the idea of me posting my photos
of myself on my own setting because I
don't know if I should do much
I never considered it but
yeah let me move up let me
let's see if I can move the line up a
bit more and see because it looks a bit
weird once you know them
yeah that looks bad
definitely better
[Music]
on the reference the
points on the inside of are actually
lowered down and the question I would
say
maybe I should do something about that
too
[Music]
oh no she got snow panties on I don't
live
foreign
[Music]
but I enabled it for not only connected
[Music]
[Music]

[Music]
[Music]
something
[Music]
okay I'm Gonna Save this foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
blurt out
by a lot
a lot a lot
the step one
step two
don't make an ingredient
[Music]
you have this ingredient that
is
a big dark gray at the bottom
black in the top
you know what you need
and then nothing is
I want to set this to
updates my account
why
okay now this is a subtract
now it's like
like that
okay let's export this and see how it
looks
if I delete it
I want it in one half now so
yeah it's only the back side everyone
says because it's yeah I think this
works because like
shadows in there let's see okay
[Music]
so now I just need to do the same
with the description below
laughs
Okay so
and then
and there oh it's definitely
I guess this is just one of those
massive ones
now I'll put in the meal
whenever it doesn't
all right I can't do that
because this one's gonna be like
come on
let's see okay all right can do here
[Music]
foreign
okay
and then I can
[Music]
do it like that
[Music]
[Music]
oh yeah it doesn't die
[Music]
so now
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
but it's just generic types I have for
whatever I play games which I did
but yeah you're not allowed to take the
seat in the back
so don't try this
church I knew yeah
that their content tanks per cap without
releasing
don't like
balance set of tags and a different set
attack for specific Japanese like your
art
but I don't need any practicing thanks
if the line maybe I should fix the
internet
Maybe
I can be realize whatever I think
let's see if I can generate one
[Music]
so
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
in my texture
to normal
this one I'll click on you
so I'm not even sure
normally use
again
and then
this one I think
so
um
that's that
stuff stuff second thoughts on this
thing only then I go to
render
[Music]
or is it this time
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
let's
let's say and make it
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
foreign
foreign
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
foreign
[Music]
I think so
one and a half hours
and it has gender it generated the same
world
look at this beauty uh it's a bit weird
in places we'll see if it works or not
um
[Music]
[Music]
there we go okay
enjoying music
[Music]
so let's try to
[Music]
run
add it in here
so I don't have the wind
go turn on the map
[Music]
so I should not have these anymore
instead I should add a lot of maps from
here which is the
boy shorts
cleaning
planets punishments
a girl
and then
all right what I got now that's
important
[Music]
yeah it is
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
this is apparently what the
[Music]
end between the king beds
hopefully it works
let's see how it goes when I apply it
worst case it looks ugly and then I'll
just remain it
back
if you went by 1443 and it's 16 20
you're here in in in in in one hour
and then
37 minutes or something came back
a bit earlier in the estimate
but there was a procrastination
I've been working on a skirt when you've
been gone
it's been done
and then let's switch to the
skirt
let's update the knowledge which I just
named
because it has some weird stuff like
this particularly there you go
yeah right so it's not I didn't didn't
go as planned
like what's this
I mean yeah you have these four reasons
but
what happens here
[Music]
yeah so yeah no I did not guys plan
another thing that went as plans
record family do you like
the enemy
Let's ignore none left he didn't turn it
it turned out bad
but instead
let's fetch
this
mentioned that I have a
the bunny suit on a map
yeah here
right like me
like this
wait a minute straight lines
yes
I can do straight line because the time
should be here
there you go
since you've been gone
I'm out of my head
I'm checking
could I be wrong but since you've been
gone because the spell to break it I
don't know it
I found the song sounds like
foreign
how do you know
are you inspiring on me again
foreign
on me
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
my God
[Music]
there it is
[Music]
well I guess he's scared of English
[Music]
look carefully let's hit
well there's a skirt
I mean it's only versions
the Shimmer can't get the this is like a
high television
with stuff in it but
that doesn't matter I can delete this
well
there's a high polish
all right
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
we're looking normal map
this is some
nothing this is
[Music]
maybe I just need to
increase this further
this is really the problem
yeah maybe it was a Dream from the wrong
thing
[Music]
when it's obvious for me was what it
should read from it
thank you
I'm gonna cancer again
so who's spying on who I mean I don't
think it counts as spying if you're in
if you're the one
telling me stuff
but you know
and I can't like here's the video of me
and then I know
now he's spying on me as you're looking
at the video of me
[Music]
that's not very interesting
click
the princess
[Music]
oh there we go now it's spinning away
another
almost a fifth Stone
[Music]
licking the princess
to lick away all that makeup
that's our 50.
I wish I could make it wider
[Music]
[Music]
done
okay
foreign
snake
did you get a snake
why don't you try and snack with me
I'm a snack team
this system
[Music]
what kind of nuts hazelnuts
definitely mixed nuts
yeah I'm asking
what kind of almonds nuts
I hope you don't have none of that's in
there like peanuts
and I bet you don't have like a
strawberries
the yellows
beads on them or not which is nuts
because he's
[Music]
it is done
but it looks a bit weird
[Music]
yeah it's gonna
yeah right here
it's definitely a written the other
night in this room
oh wait I guess I can't use this
and when
that's a shame
[Music]
can't make
but anyway it's a kid's kid isn't it
and then there's art where I should add
like bow on the back side
it's the backside that's the back side
here's the front side
and here's pon pon wearing skirt with no
panties
no she's wearing pencils
yeah I will uh
okay I will
because currently this guy just singing
straws sleeping lines down I would I'll
try to
add multiple
layers nice characters
it's a nice cake
oh
that's nice
I hope it delays and blessing maybe
about the real name
well actually there's a few more scenes
like
metal
s
thanks anyways
[Music]
remember today roughness yeah that this
one is updating
that's kind of neglects
thanks
I will add back the
boy shorts
which I guess represents the roughness
of clothing
that adding the clothing
they'll do this
and that's the roughness so far I think
so
after taking era there's currently
roughness
is not seen
But if I have to eat
I didn't want to change and see nice
yeah
oh yeah I was supposed to map these
cards uh animation at the bottom of the
skirts the yeah that was first thing I
should do before I split it up in this
program so this part is supposed to
animate according to cocoon
so I will put create a new
way to down here which I call call
something like
data transfer
it's funny
the names of my internet always when I
use my switch
polish word for skirt
skirt
do you know what do you know how to
Spanish
okay
and I must take this skirt part
duplicate as a reference
that would be scared would be used as a
reference for the data transfer of this
one
not really all right let's see see it's
it's that's the spelling
again
I mean I guess
I guess your spelling would technically
pronounce the same and I guess that's a
spelling that could be
used but this is actually how I spelled
[Music]
DJ marks there
only I mean you could argue that's the
yeah it's basically the SK before from
vowel makes that sound but ask
care sound for backgrounds
and then but if you want it who has
sound before backgrounds yeah the J
it's getting back up Spanish it works
but it's
the mixer
before back vowels
and this sound before France pass but if
you want that because Sam with my front
value instead of spelling see you spell
q e instead
similar deal
it's a bit silly
[Music]
all right let's see nearest
facing
The Dumpling but it's only should only
be applied to that that trans straight
[Music]
now
these should be not affected yes but
these
victim
[Music]
here
wait why does it says
[Music]
quite clean
right normal eyes on
okay
wait clean
and Destiny everything
for me well that's nice
I do not have
trousers
or skirts skirts I mean shirt I know
that was one of the best way I can wore
a shirt on me at the moment I have a
dress
ah
white pink orange dress
[Music]
they were suppressant
maybe I didn't do
wait why can't I played
that's right
right
I don't like this why does he do this
and I would replace this but I didn't
tell it to replace me
[Music]
and I'm gonna try
to read data from that one
just to only apply to the bottom
replace
[Music]
oh wait now I see
I see I see
[Music]
thank you
I'm seeing I'm sinning
[Music]
because when I did the home sing
obviously changed this way thing
[Music]
it only got to replace
[Music]
so now it says there I'm actually going
to ask
okay now it still has that
oh yeah I need to remove it
hello
so now it should have this card yeah now
we've got this card that is here and the
not scratch buttons up there there we go
that's what they wanted
um
including it was
celebration
I need something good
[Music]
so what I can do is do like something
like
thank you
[Music]
like this
[Music]
and then I can
[Music]
and then it's up like this
and that
no not having
but underage
[Music]
oh no she turned invisible with her
clothes are still misspelling here you
can see her anyway
[Music]
laughs
[Music]
I think there's like pretty good
[Music]
so I think somewhere here
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
again
[Music]
no it's a bit smoothly
yeah
getting scared
the skin is amazing
oh yeah and this is the height of the
Sims character trendy which it broke
everything I didn't break anything with
it couldn't generate the proper normal
map
thank you
yeah I hope it then it's correctly again
when that took you forever today
[Music]
so there's this bow here I wish I was
going to learn from Coco
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
and this thing has spread out everywhere
oh my I can generate the name
such a mess
okay probably
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
where you did break it in Cleveland by
the way
[Music]
but yes on device is almost good
again in the tricky one when you should
negative foreign
because the focus is on the on the
peanuts being lacking and not the having
that is being lacking
yeah I would say that makes sense
because
the bank has stuff which is not peanuts
and therefore you negative peanuts
but if you're talking about sticks
there's enough peanuts and if the bag
that doesn't have them then you would
negate the having
but that's not the case here that's been
penis out of it anywhere else
internet systems
so I mean technically they are sometimes
because they were never put in a bag but
that's not the pointy
the language is too advanced it's this
you have to specify it's important
what kind of language is this
[Music]
he comes snatching me when he's speaking
and then also when I have to think well
this sounds better than that but why
oh yeah that's why yeah do you think
doesn't really explain it in Terror
Indian
well
yeah it doesn't really explain much
[Music]
yes so see in there and
wish you luck and sometimes it doesn't
be me with you back
at this kind of though I'm looking for
it it's like more than this animal
but uh
bye
381
[Music]
verbs not nouns yeah
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
sentence but that's the negation of the
incline development in question
but I guess your language
that's that that was what Snapchat name
is
[Music]
inclined stuff that's fun
but yeah
[Music]
in a good language lesson
[Music]
that's why I I guess that's uh that
that's it's not a proof but
I guess one way if you remember it is
that Indian inflict space
on the now
in there does not inflict
[Music]
but of course there are very upset in
verbs words that go with nouns that
don't inflict even though they are
referencing the nouns so I mean it's not
a proof
made something to go on yeah it's again
I know how I feel exactly
[Music]
more of a
way to remind
myself
[Music]
it languages out here my Creations is
even the Rhythm the languages are random
I don't think he even needs this inside
this is
this thing
actually does no it doesn't
it only goes into it and then it just
ends
so I can save myself
doing inside
[Music]
oh
German inflicts French inflicts English
you need to see flexibility I mean
English implants
stuffed in
just to
certain moments a few moments
[Music]
[Music]
for some reason it's very natural to
reflect stuff
even though some people don't like it
very many languages
that is true
[Music]
but a lot of languages does which is
very annoying when developer asks for
translations
this is a whole Topic in itself
but I like well can you translate this
thing yeah but you have like editing now
separated and they will be affected by
at least now on this you can do it like
this
well now you have to translate this way
yes
oh yeah but that language made it work
yeah but that language made it
grammatically correct
well you have to find a solution anyway
but
foreign
[Music]
yeah
it's only
one energy team I know of that agree
that must reflect according to the noun
but that's that's not that way though in
English
it's based on
biological gender and that would be the
addictive blonde because people still
insist of reflecting even in English
name is
[Music]
thank you
I am I can't see myself
[Music]
oh yeah blonde blondes all Supernatural
Nets okay I guess there's not working
My Moment
a brown hair man and a brunette
in any case the difference is the only
reason that's exactly the same yeah
it's those people who insist that
well it comes from this line which you
should infect it this way because that's
what that language does
even though that's that really isn't the
Whole Health consistently
my name is like practice should be cut
by people say
instead of cactuses because that's
how it's
but they argue that's how it's inflicts
in the original language but imagine if
you did that with every now and
like
phobia yes
well beer
here it says that
yeah I guess it does have a different
thing around here
doesn't give me the pronunciation
phobia phobia
I guess I should look at the Greek
program pronunciation then
it's from
it will be a what is that
for instance let modern reach
because the plural 4B Bobby I should be
for for
poor boy oh boy there we go that should
be plural phobia
I certainly when there were people that
remember where they they were from
inside in different languages okay
okay
it's like I totally want to steam this
design
don't tell anyone
can I just take what I mean previously
instead I'm not a pregnant one
like
I think this one works in a small scan I
don't think this one would work in a
large scale
yeah it's a bit too low probably
so definitely needs
yeah so if I enlarge this
wasn't made to be this touch
pause in English they use
symptoms
yellow
I mean yeah that happens
I mean
like a spaghetti
spaghetti is plural of spaghetto
[Music]
sign up around here
[Music]
yeah I am not sure exactly sure how I
would do this because here I made this
the very difference between the ones I
made in the this one it's professionally
made
foreign
[Music]
if you're talking about different types
of spaghettis
plural spaghettis
without the E when you want to purchase
one it's a spaghetti name
a noodle or spaghetti don't get
determined we got like noodle
the people talk about the ramen and
there's like spaghetti
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
all right
I should have had this claim it when he
was refer to Hawaii
I mean it makes sense
and blade of grass and noodle of
spaghetti
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
this is
[Music]
an English
which speakers also have a tendency to
not call calc
nouns that
[Music]
compounds that they take from different
languages despite having a perfectly
word which is a cognet
foreign
word which means wandering word it has
the cognates wandering and word so why
not call it the wandering word a Wonder
word
not a wonder what one reward
and another one is a late motif
which is the German also German which
has the cognates in English with lead
and multi so why not call it a lead
motive
it's a plaintiffness
and it's just so weird to me especially
when we when Swedish actually
takes the colleagues of German words
I'm not Easter before facility is it
easy
yeah
and of course on these teams begin
versus specific is the class of dishes
in ground beef tan vanilla sauce because
which makes it even worse
Elizabeth spaghetti was used it's fine
it's not fine then it's the pasta
[Music]
and nothing else
[Music]
[Music]
I mean it's not like other languages
have done this
is where I think I want word and I'm
using for something
[Music]
medicina makes it weird since so many
people they speak English in every
language
and then most languages okay that this
is how it should work English that
new
[Music]
when yeah
[Music]
okay
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
okay so now I created
flat version of it
[Music]
now let's see if I can make it more
three dimensions
so I'll take these
this is
but against this team I think isn't
this one
thank you
foreign
[Music]

[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and
except for myself nights
all right I had missing
okay okay
[Music]
manually nothing takes time but
right next time doesn't take too long
but
conveniency
[Music]
that's okay
[Music]
so these always fit in somewhere
together with everything else
thank you
chances
[Music]
[Music]
what do you think a lot of space at the
moment
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
I separate this part
[Music]
and it respect for this thing
[Music]
I got the fair bunny here

like this
I am
[Music]
so like that
and then it's doing that to me let me

[Music]
now of course it goes into the foot
there that's not good
it's like this city
this came down to make my way
[Music]
and I said it between
[Music]
and definitely doesn't pick the closest
yet we are random I'm not sure why this
starting thing now
[Music]
and then when it's starting that the
wine started doing that
this one upside down
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
holes

I could see what you mean if that was 15
years or anything
so in here
on the dress the armholes are the eyes
what is the address it's just her naked
body
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
like that and then these
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
right here don't bother so if you're
already 0.74 which is 77
okay
that was weird
at least you chat message the new
messages that needs to show up in
chatbot
is my voice and speak should be in sync
with
[ __ ]
[Music]
ing
yeah that's the best of concerning space
[Music]
foreign
why haven't you been studying
Terror been teaching all these years
boys
not like that
something something people
time again
so if I sing on this
[Music]
you're going to blending
fresh
like me refresh what what I'm
[Music]
not something I'm wrong here
can you see all this
is it
say over again
let me finish there we go that was me
and now it's pink
yay wait what
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so this
this can affect me
don't try to apply here
[Music]
you just should be able to do
foreign
what's up
now
now
will it sit above it him yeah I think
foreign
used to be in the safe side
let me
there we go
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yesterday
why is it because it's
that was probably right
now uh
[Music]
[Music]
yeah I think I want things to
no
[Music]
so
[Music]
okay this is not exactly how I am
fishing it
that
here's something
okay and this is
[Music]
and there we go now it's it's been
sure
so
[Music]
yeah
foreign
there we go
let's just do that for
the
because then I have a look for me and
the high qualification
let's see if it works
very interesting a new team
use this to me not here
but
and I think that she's gonna see me
this
and let's see if it works
thank you
there was just showing the picture back
at the top
Oh no you're lucky
[Music]
it does there
generating the normal really quickly of
course if the compute was more powerful
it was for you being you know quicker
and that would be nice
is doing it really quickly
[Music]
but I do wonder how instant it would be
quite powerful computer that would be
that would be purely needed to see
what audience is still my work now but
it's like this that's the same it's done
now it's not bad next time or something
and if it means it's done
[Music]
thank you
thank myself
there we go
it's something
uh same as
some friends
[Music]
yeah
[Music]
yeah
back here
now I should just be able to open a
[Music]
there you go the stats but I only need
part
[Music]
we only need this much
[Music]
and rest and stay and learning that
[Music]
and then
sport
and all right and now we're going to
look at this
amazing feature
[Music]
as I said I generated this
ah okay
red dragon new funny
hydrate
[Music]
is that is that your
way up
well well I did steal your dress but at
least
at least you get a heart rate
so
[Music]
now if it switches both to this
this is a high quality match which like
this
and then there's the no quality image
they're currently use the low quality
lists
not use up too much performance
but with the new enormous
look at the update there we go
no
this looks like this okay now it's using
purple here letting know that
but now this one looks like the other
one
but it still has a few
points it's so amazing against this
I think it's amazing
because now it looks like a high quality
image
when it isn't
we have vehicle trade that's true what
day yeah sounds good well wait a minute
no
this does not sound good
I have been tricked
okay one difference here is that that
one is much more
crunched up
[Music]
but that's the direct
[Music]
I'm back and while you were back someone
came in here and start my dress
foreign
[Music]
someone need to locate my dress I can
find with it okay that's the thing
that's a game for chat today

reference skirt what no

that's what I wanted
ah look it's a tough thing
and it turned out pretty good I must say
foreign
but don't worry I don't see it in there

feel like you have to say it I think
through your actions
[Music]
let us thank you things

conversations with Benefits there but I
don't I won't see any shirts
if that is okay
I know it's gonna cut the circulations
you have hands oh no it's cutting into
your body
I always feel like I'm not seeing enough
so
well
when you're wrong
I could see this one in here
I guess that's kind of I mean space
and then they
that way I don't have to waste
I'm clever
[Music]
I think
um
[Music]
no I'm not very likely spending the red
line but I won't do the
other design which are following
it
I think it costs instead with white
lines
might wait for anything
when the best body says
oh that's what I explained this
as the wrong painting
all right
some weight fighting
so
back here there it is
so I guess let me explain this one as
Charlotte

favorite songs at the living room Jimmy
Buffett It's Five O'Clock Somewhere
first increasing with me buffet buffet I
don't know he passed away today

that's him
she'll be
I'll leave the hip painful for me
nice
well

like five somethings
uh somewhere

it starts with it but to me it is five
something somewhere
action
oh I'm saying
yeah the big two lines like that

release for the really going to be
released for PlayStation 4 fire and
windows

[Music]
there's something tall and strong and
make it that hurricane before I go
insane it's only half past 12 but I
don't care that's why I plug somewhere
that's my special song
five o'clock what
started a new JRP game when I was a long
time ago they said that they were
co-developed by another company who left
the project in
2019 so yeah it's been it's been a
development for quite a way
okay so it has like a c around here I
don't have
this separate
basically yes
Shadow on it
then but like this
it kind of got a shadow for one and
shared with all that without it doesn't
like this never seen yeah and that
killed it yes okay
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
and
color will be made separately I'm sure I
say yes if I'm not the one making a
color
color color
that was like a dead one again
you can't separate
and then merge with this and now it's
falling in
[Music]
so
okay I'm getting even inspected by
I need to go to passing again because
people have asked me to hydrate so many
times
so I would have to go to the bathroom
again
but you can rock this you can write the
stuff you find interesting about the
game I've never really what I converting
is we have a topic to talk about English

aim for three minutes that's in the
meantime because I guess

[Music]

playing
on the floor completely
pasta out
not knowing I've been five hours
thank you
well I'm working
a lot of effort in this out here
I wanted to be good option

and I hope people find
because this is giving me experience I
said more when I give new outfits
online if I do or rather than when I do
but
I do need helps like
running a PC
don't get so happy that or any
but if you really like what I do and I'm
really interested in having uh that I'm
having a pumpkin model
that's
[Music]
[Music]

no my face 90.
it doesn't a lot it takes four shots of
that round to knock me out of the
bathroom floor well you got halfway

don't have enough to get wasted so you
get tired
okay
[Music]

understand that side

sck Swedish Brown skoda including
recycling well

you can buy
eight of them and then you can go back

but yeah
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign

that's when
I tricky constructions
I don't know I don't know what I'm
talking about that
in Swedish too I don't know and
hopefully you can try the word yeah
I'm going to stop yeah
oh well foreign
thank you
so they have a a little section session
not the section
not God
because
you got the correct letter but you know
R is a background also it comes to God
but hey the front balance becomes
yes I want to cuddle yeah I want to come
yeah
what is my color party
[Music]
I want some cuddlers now
I'm starting for cousins
look it's a shirt
don't don't mind me
fire protection
that kind of hard to see different
texture anyway you can see this from
here
yes that is true my spelling Swedish is
okay it's fine anyway it's inside itself
oh yeah do you wanna have a nice one how
many channels without me
20 something
yeah
so yeah it's kind of interestingly
because it's going to use the same
there was this thing I was questioning
before like how am I going to do
with all the textures but the shirt
which is covering the whole Bollywood of
course
still use the same parts for detection
the person is just telling me not only
color this one
that should be too tricky
but he had someone made
well a thousand points for Carl section
[Music]
I have sent seventh since
I get fast puzzles
I have no exciting about cuddles
otherwise no one gets cuddles
[Music]
by anyone
you've been you've only been naughty
here
[Music]
I wonder if it's something like this
right
[Music]
care if it's already
[Music]
been eating I had to make my number
[Music]
foreign
something like that and maybe
uh here they do have the extra piece
hear that stuff fighting I can try to
come along can't wait you're not making
you already mean
wait here is that working
yeah but Mickey has the barrel fun
hey how do I get that first
yeah
you can get the princess Batman I mean
it would only cost you
330 there's 3 300 bits but you know
and no need to do that
he didn't make me that's nice anyway
yeah that's yeah
I'm gonna head out now have a good
evening thank you for being here red
it's been amazing to have you here
and the funny funny videos you need
it was fun
have a good day have a good evening
have a good life
forget everything
have a good night bye bye
Theory man can you inspire me three
thousand years
it's a shame you can't gift like
you can give someone a subscription but
why can't you give someone like Beats
not that nuts
I was posting in like spending them for
in someone else's name but maybe that's
a bad idea why not just transfer them
over so another used to have them on
their account
it's the impossible Champions I don't
think you can which is bad
yeah they should add it I mean there's a
benefits for for twitch
[Music]
I mean
most people would get there yes I mean
[Music]
but then twitch gains from it so what
happened there
[Music]
is this me and they haven't done that
oh it's not even
I didn't expect that anyway
this part
it's not on tracing
to changes
I have to motivate afterwards any
to make it
I'll stressed outside and work myself
when they're back here and get deep
straight through
you know that there you go
um
but he said he wanted me to get first
place in bits right
well yeah but then you took over the
fresh face of you
clown yeah
yeah let's wait on the gifts if you want
to give give sweet until it is gifting
time
which will it be will it ever
or is it I mean it's just now
in position
yes there we go
[Music]
in there
I actually took first place on gift sets
and then
if being time is
here
boom
it will happen in 2023
um yes 26.
only about six this month
starting at 19 o'clock
in Europe central time
um
the f26 yeah that's so funny I know
they decided to not do the gifting thing
through the whole month even though they
use you're doing the buy yourself stuff
but it's so far and then you still
waiting one week of gifting people have
seen people think that switch is getting
a bit a bit stingy or whatever the word
is and I agree
I think they used to have it before
though yeah and not only that they
before they cut out they didn't take any
money they cut out their cuts off they
completely removed their cuts of the
price so you own 100 went to the
streamer now they're keeping half of
their cut so so before you got 50 off
now now you only get 25 off
at least it doesn't affect the streamer
in how much it's streaming is but the
people it does affect the streaming
because people can't buy as much for the
same amount of money
yeah yeah all right it's important
someone around
you haven't seen any money for those yes
you're going to the whole party the I
only if you could use because I'm still
only affiliate because to be a to be uh
and it's a whole complete different
so in affiliate I can only have um 50
but I can have more than 50 subscribers
but only 50 subscriber counts towards
email slots
all right let's switch feels like
changing that at some point but I
probably won't need it and I currently
have only 24 because I'm not Stephen
something right now
and I'm not even try and have fun
listening no you need to try
it's important to try you know
and don't give up
[Music]
you can fight about that that's right
okay
[Music]
that's the same [ __ ] fight a lot
so let's hide this
is basically
but I need to modifying is
[Music]
I'm glad being second position games
though yeah and that's but that's good
[Music]
that's good you're quite far ahead that
position
so long I'm not sad still doesn't mean
don't bite the hands
but that's just
it does not heat
[Music]
need to keep me on my feet
thank you
anything
so let's
I should look after my reference picture
and see this is yeah maybe I shouldn't
make this one that's it deep Maybe
that's way for me to make everything
[Music]
all right but not for you active chat is
well it doesn't really matter because
not expensive
people learn as well
I'm learning more and more
[Music]
this would be a fun party
although maybe I shouldn't even like an
extra stream
what not that much what is the 20 lines
you never attendance right 26 26. that's
a Tuesday
I mean I could I could do like a late
thing
when the whole event starts
[Music]
and uh I don't even see him
I'm able to do anything because
and at least they need to clean up my
house and move out
he's kind of not bad
nine twenties
I will see how quickly I'll get back to
streaming after moving
shouldn't be much really much TV for me
get back
everybody
[Music]
yeah I know and oh it's time stream I
mean it doesn't need to be oh it turns
too much
[Music]
you want me to bring that is that is
that the
battery
she's not really
[Music]
amazing game
I mean
that that would have to run on the
console
that might be a bit tricky to run
yeah
it was after that move I should set up
the console again
in that case he's fine with it but if I
take really long time before I move
then I don't have to cancel that
but I'm not going to unpacking
of course
I mean I just can
get back and then
don't worry
I'll get back in me
what is it me
[Music]
this thing should probably not go with
me
[Music]
as far as the
yeah
[Music]
with her
because
that also makes it big benefits
now let's
cancel
that's why I'm trying to
I mean
it's not that's not why I'm saying
basically I mean
verdicts here but
I mean changing every vertex thus wasn't
mean that is not loving scene
there
[Music]

[Music]
[Music]
depending on how I managed eating the

[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
beside that during and think
foreign
[Music]

bunny tummy time
I got this bread from the dryer and I
still want
um
971
nice and warm
any advice
that's fine then I can I can survive
this
should I
[Music]
do that
instead I can relax
[Music]
and then I can leave this
pieces
all the things since
Mr lines
I will also the song yeah can I select
the points I want you to select
I'll just solve that too
so
that's what I want I need to basis and
then the basement
it would be a shame if I put my wolf
powers on them
why would you do that
why would the every beautiful spots on
them
I am responsible for doing consequences
by him stealing pom pons clothes and
running away with them
I see how it is
but oh no your your dress is deadly let
me take it immediately of your body
you you certainly don't need the word
this fact
only at this moment giving the fresh
class Poppins I mean I guess I guess
having like a paw print
because she could have a paw print on
her bra or something back anyway
[Music]
that's just like a cute idea
[Music]
it's
called doing the laundry and Princess
must be clean and presentable at all
times that is also apply to her wardrobe
yep
or she includes the clothes he's wearing
at this very moment in case the clothes
is wearing up his very moment get
started
foreign
[Music]
more pants so
what is this is
not there you go
[Music]
so we're doing bunny poppies
welcome you're doing great yeah okay so
this is the reference don't mind that
mind the one that's made here
this is what I've done
I'm actually apply proper texture to
this shirt
currently I'm
thinking
[Music]
if you enjoyed this design I'm making
foreign
foreign
I love that body
anyway
with high pressure
oh my
I guess these are the
oh yeah oh yeah
he's funny
edges
yeah it's broken
don't know why
does it work if I
some reason it's broken
[Music]
the face is broken
oh there we go yeah now I see
I see why it's broken why it's broken
[Music]
this one is completely already knows it
doesn't have a new map
so I need to give it to you a map
you know what I'm saying
[Music]
so let's find the bunny I can see what
I'm thinking
yeah like that
Mark seam and then unwrap
right let's check the previous this is
pretty so wrap this is terrible unwrap
this is so much better on right
people nicestation
[Music]
it's me
that that run animation which is not
even animated
[Music]
that's the next one I run the animation
every animation
Spider-Man noises
so this is the underside and this is the
oversight that's what that's what you're
saying right
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
wait and
[Music]
oh my
God makes sense
and I said I would sleep with that one
[Music]
scene here
merch by up
my shoulder strap is slipping off
remember
[Music]
I did we just didn't show up properly
no spraying meat is far away plus I put
on my paws on your clothing onto your
own hooks no nobody managed to take what
all of his clothing to do laundry do
they want to check them away again
okay
and I failed him
you have confidence all right no cheese
that's drooling it's fine I already got
nothing it's very
I want some treats I want to buy some
chocolate for myself but I don't got the
money for that
I'm gonna give pumpkin money
's bunnies should not have chocolate
or anything
I'm not Pony I'm a bunny how can I mix
those up
I can survive that suddenly very fast
I wish I had such cute emotes anymore
[ __ ]
I need to be a partner
now
yeah okay hey
I have kind of started on a request for
twitch to add more emotes and
I will I should finish the quest and
then uh I guess I'll have you people
look it over
and before and then I set it in and then
you basically float on it
and because evil don't need using your
Twitch account which you have one yeah
I know you have one you can lie to me
yes it can
well
oh you're contacting me
there we are 19 Square
chocolate don't eat chocolate it's a
fall I guess fools maybe but if I focus
then I would continue
I have some bunny treats
I like these
I like donuts
I like chocolate
yeah it's all about trying to mix
if the if the way
that one oh yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah
if you want if you want to use an emo if
a regular emoji
for some reason if you post a singular
one it breaks
but if you post two it doesn't break I
have no idea it is my own code it has
nothing to do with twitch or anything
I haven't still not looked over my code
so it's something me and my code does
well I don't know
because if if it breaks a one certainly
should break down two as well I have no
idea what's going on
it is possible that it is Switched as
well it might handle a single one
and more than one differently
that's because it's really strange that
it would work for one
but it wouldn't work for one but it
doesn't work
that doesn't make sense to me
[Music]
yeah I said I have to look this morning
to that at some point I'm just not
taking my attention
[Music]
yeah the chat thingy it's my own
do you like it
of course you like it
you know you're all black to like it
[Music]
wait you coded the chat box
charts Fox yes I know I took an original
code and have modified it heavily
[Music]
I was disappointed with then you saw you
saw the original chat box design which
was your plain text
which sounds too much too stealing is
a simple design
[Music]
it does its job it just text on screen
oh yeah it was a bit planned for me and
I couldn't really find
[Music]
a chat that I like
so I made my own
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
but it's it's not amazing either it's
it's for anyone who doesn't know the
music that plays during the countdown if
I switch to the countdown screen
yeah
yes that's music
[Music]
yeah so there was a twitch after when it
added the time and it different sized
nope
makes my own design
I mean if it was a twitch update why it
doesn't anyone else have it
I mean logically speaking
[Music]
and the image has always been the
different size in the chat
and just made them
the largest size this time
[Music]
foreign
seats
Yeah you mentioned the music is was
written by our other story and the the
music in the counter is written by North
archives
and While others don't have the same I
think they just have different settings
so yeah
[Music]
fair enough
I mean I guess I don't have to connect
this with fan
[Music]
quality sleeps like this yes it will be
yeah I mean
this design is more like a toilet seat
or something
when you have a toilet seat around me
it's not a toilets in it
next
yeah they kind of have a bit of a tooth
shape I guess
so
yeah I have so many plan changes to the
Stream
and I can
we needed a toilet seat to put it up
[Music]
no okay you know what
less bits on something special for this
opinion
hibernate
also when you say you need a toilet seat
in the bunny Barrel do you mean that you
have been using the floor all this time
bohemian
whatever I said about using the floor as
a toilet
[Music]
B make me disappointed
I mean the other design is all also has
a heart fit I can see like the
prompt placement of the heart I guess
thank you having a puppy
keep your fingers to yourself now
I mean I I do get it though
it is it is fun to talk since
I need to wash the dress after certain
oh that's mostly sorry
France wasn't supposed to kill I mean
you could have gone in the forest or
something but the parking's not nice
they are like chickens and certain
clothes look
thank you guys Adidas
well
[Music]
I wouldn't mind
oh Prince I guess
um
but this shouldn't be like
30 poplings from some food
from some
30 40
it should be intentionally designed
[Music]
but it has their logo on the hoodie if
they can have
um if they can have that you can have my
own one [ __ ] done yesterday too I
mean I could have a perfectly done if
I guess
that counter is staying hard on the
front of the panties
[Music]
so there will be an this is the backside
so let's pick up doll color for it
foreign
[Music]
but you're not a rabbit
I do not eat rabbits as Foods rabbits
are good stories about this stuff like
hardly smooches laughs and stuff and and
apparently undressing and looking at
their underwear but
I guess that's just
nuts
yeah but anyway it pulls back away
hey what what are you doing
hey I didn't say that
no but the actions he said
actions speaks louder than words
am I full onion weighing yes not a month
see
if
I guess
I'm not sure if I mean
abnormal artfuls in the first place I
have never seen a wolf in real life to
prepare never seen a wolf in real life I
think unless they have that much guns
and in that case I might have seen one
they might touch the head and they have
my effects to see Monday
yeah
I think this will
but yeah
do you want to give me a wedgie is that
the
is that everything you want to have
give us
that sounds a bit really
I think I know it's pink and now it has
this problem too
what if should it be large or not
and we should have been largely no means
you'll not be as close to the edge
Maybe
right away from the edge
now see Korean said working oh maybe
maybe whatever
okay so there's like 20 pieces from The
Edge I just need to calculate out how
far in 20 pixels inside
each other
I guess I'll just move this character or
something
so one two three one five six seven
eight nine I want to do that but I don't
need to do this
ten
twenty and then go back
there we go
10 20 and go back two steps
[Music]
so much you see
where did two thousand I mean yeah that
seems like a fair price
because who would who would willingly
give no one would use it obviously
because no one was willingly hurt from
fortnite
right
yeah you can manage any points put down
here
foreign
[Music]
I guess
as long as it's no one thinks it's a bit
too too much
hopefully no one thinks it's too much
this is turning it up for this channel
yes
I don't even should know man nuts left
and blur out a bit blurry like that
make fun fun sing the alphabet in
Swedish for it once that's very
character
how would I sing that
but but spots like this song
find me it
to the newly present what year I did
foreign
thank you
[Music]
because it gives no purpose in switch
air language generally finally yeah
do not fully recognizing WS it so left
me
[Music]
don't let me
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
oh
okay let's have two a's that sounded
different yeah why would you have that
sounds just weird adaptive Ace that
sounds different
imagine having three A's that sounds
different that's that's even crazier
[Music]
and and if that's not enough
not only have three A's that are take
detected the language considers
different A's also also have these three
A's these three A's each have two
different pronunciations defending on
different contexts let's see remember
this is such a thing
anyway
I I think that that I added an irony but
but I guess no one cares
[Music]
oh no I know what did you do
you did it
I mean
I mean
wait where did you why did you ask me to
translate that to Swedish it's all
really in Swedish what are you doing
okay
I didn't I didn't even know how how the
song even would go
I guess you wrote it
yeah
I'll be seeing the EFG
X is
honestly would say after that
that's alphabet song it's
perfect next time for arcade
I'll do is not next time
you are unsatisfied okay I will I will
give you one more time because you spent
2500.7
obviously ESP EXC
thank you I've seen happy how are you
even happy

but I'm happy like sheep
I'm happy to be entertaining
that's pumpkin's purpose here
and
wrote something
uh good news everyone
my right arm has stopped its spasm
uh I did so for a week straight
um
I guess it wanted to shift gears in my
car again which I didn't have to expand
here's what I've shown is like someone's
bad and I think so
well if it's not one normally it's the
owner
as in that life
but I'm happy for you the arm I'm set
for your arm
and I have no idea what's going on
[Music]
I'm happy wait why is this one this one
is one pixel too long this one is 10
things you should only be mine because
it should compensate for me
and
distance traveled
distance traveled
[Music]
foreign
enough of that
here it's over here starts doing that
shifting in position
yo
if I was in the shower scrubbing my
right arm and my left shoulder started
hurting badly probably an old injury had
I'm centering it
[Music]
sadly
I don't know any
if I can do something for you
you got to see cute pumpkin anyway
with with the heart on the front
blueprints on the front is really cute
foreign
[Music]
because this one is just nine pixels
sometimes they can't think
wow
[Music]
this is what did you think
[Music]
so there's one line
I think that's white
now it goes all the way down
should I have a chicken
let me get one
that's not the one that's the one
[Music]
so I have a rotate it
one two three four five six seven I get
yes seven should be quick
[Music]
let's place it on this one and I want
one two three four five
it's like a good memory
done
thank you no it's not working isn't it
[Music]
that's one again because I need a second
one
got to go to be a second line anyway
sorry
um
let's see working as I've had so far
four months on my are called muscles
it does and reported in Egypt
Machinery I think that what was the
worst had blood during the leg which I
knew was however ignore just let myself
what
well
when
[Music]
you are crazy
[Music]
[Music]
I did my best to make sure no one saw it
but eventually they noticed sent me to
the office about it I just wrapped it in
causes and taped it out and went
I don't know I don't even know what it
is
one two three four five
these two shapes as the other side
should be a perfect mirror
because I married the uni map
s you have to be possible just
to treat it thank you
and if everything is correct
it should now created White Lines around
the whole thing and I should have about
equal this information
it's not perfect
but what is in this life
what is it in this world I want to say
think I can't even speak
ta-da
it says good
foreign
[Music]
let's place this one here
okay
it's been seven hours now
this also helps absorb a blood oh
but I guess it's it's more like yeah
socks up blood even more
so it's not just dripping everywhere
yeah that makes sense
anyway
yeah
I'm going on
hold on today
but it's fun
I mean I don't want it funny to end
anyway
I don't
know me I'm having so much fun
we are talking about
a very nice things like work injuries
and panties
now any string can start a
conversational appearance
[Music]
[Music]
so let's make it pointy
[Music]
that is very
but man is not this is why
so anyways
that needs to be added
so there's no metal No Limit
yeah this trust me the
[Music]
roughness back there
shirt
[Music]
it's nice and different roughness
so it doesn't look
so it doesn't look off
I'm still yeah and then
and then roughness sausage
I'm sorry I'm not I haven't even
switched here I'm so I'm starting to get
tired now
all right I haven't forget the surgery
off ten minutes
I basically did that scene which is
shirt party
so I'll export this too it wasn't too so
I could like it
trust me
[Music]
probably getting older the only ranges
when we were younger beginning to catch
up again
I'm gonna have to be I cannot see much
injuries myself but I haven't been like
[Music]
going crazy with stuff
I guess
I don't know
you know and I'm across a new advice so
you can get a school together now you
tell me I was kind of looking around for
it because I wanted to like a 3D
reference like this
no I finally found one
but you can give the art pictures that
in the rapid Village
oh you're talking about Bonnie
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I mean it doesn't have a skirts
[Music]
unless it is a different design you're
thinking of
[Music]
wiggle we know we go we go
selfies
[Music]
yeah I guess you can't see
I wonder how much everybody this much
basically not see
anyway
[Music]
especially at this point
but yeah like that you can see
you can see these
you already looked
to be on that come from the seat
we delete that was from
this shirt
[Music]
oh yeah
look at him foxy foxy foxy
yeah I'm not Crossing one doesn't have a
ribbon it's almost like two points yeah
this game
been crashing all again like
and you're gonna get
to pick out complete outfits
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
anyway
here's a burger
it's very working yes the burger is
working
[Music]
is licking one of the burgers because
that's her bergy the other burgers for
someone else
[Music]
so this part is the shirt
like this
is attached
really
wait what are these attacks
all right
huh
oh I see okay
kind of questions because
I didn't mean this but this happened oh
no
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yeah I think I can hide it I think now
[Music]
[Music]
like that
and now I can design versus
[Music]
and I press fixer piece
okay
now it's beautiful again
[Music]
here you can delete this don't need that
anymore
[Music]
does it looks like here
kind of makes my system
[Music]
yeah I kind of the same thing now
[Music]
is it clean now
that's the thing not listen
but that's what's amazing there we go
those
[Music]
interesting
[Music]
all right so it is
[Music]
burning now it seems fine
minus
marvelous
light was a bit
that's good perfect
[Music]
[Music]
but of course there's one more thing I
have done
and two bags of fun because they're her
favorite I do like burgers I wish I
could make more Burgers but I don't have
the money
especially that's me every day I wish I
could have that when I got a family
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
that
I think I think this is
here we go
[Music]
we have now
I can export this because this needs to
be turned into
clothing
I think I sobered up from the room
already that didn't last long it doesn't
get to be sober
don't be drunk
be so better don't be drunk
especially after this video because now
yes I should import this shirt
that's been exported
yeah
it was an advantage for me to speak to
all the way down there
thank you
I don't want to be silver
well let's
when
too bad
too bad so sad
yeah wait a minute
let me have a quick look here
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay so um
after a quick look
I can
in that
doesn't matter how long ago because the
bottom
part isn't included
[Music]
yeah so if I can import
the
body
a reference body
[Music]
that's more likely
wait a minute
moistly wrong
[Music]
maybe yeah that's great
doesn't mean
[Music]
I'll find it
easy
[Music]
and I can wear this 40 here
[Music]
and I said that doesn't really matter
[Music]
same here
no it's fine
[Music]
paste that face again yeah I don't look
at me outfit is looking really good
really good fudge
making a really good really good
one thank you
thank you so much
I put a lot of time in it that I and I
am glad it's
it's noticeable
that I have put a lot of effort
I do hope other people will appreciate
it
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
what's up
foreign
let me see if I can do that
pushing back here
so
um yes I'm going to delete parts of the
body that is going to be in the business
bone
which is basically
everything that's
colored yeah
so it is this punch
yeah this is going to insert an app
that means the basically everything here
is that we use
well basically the arms
ensure I could delete a bit of their
hands to
measurement shoot
same problems
[Music]
like that
I think that's everything that's covered
so it's this part is uncovered
but it's also covered by
this part
so this part is not visible enemy
calculate that too
that leaves just this part of the neck
and back
I mean somebody carried anyway but then
guys
that means that I should easily be able
to move
this part
um to the unused section
which is by 500
bound bye 1500
[Music]
but then it needs to a little bit more
centered in here
120.
izzil can move down a bit more
okay
[Music]
the question I need to put back in
effects and stuff there's no problem
two foreign
burgers in general and not specifically
those two hamburgers
that's my conclusion at least
[Music]
yeah I need another anime
I seen it yeah
very a lot of logic when it comes to any
languages that's different a lot of
languages now
Okay so
so it's basically this part
isn't that copy
and then I will move this
or no let me just export
this one anyway it seems easier to do it
this way export
temporary export
all right export is from London now
so my name is done I am at the part
where I can make simple phrases in
Swedish I'm happy now you can say
the rabbit
is making
a 3D mode
I don't know how to say that
well
you know I'm happy or whatever I say
I've been sober for a long time I say I
have to drink when I meet someone that I
can drink with I'll feel nice and
content
do you mean do you drink which because
they drink back with you if you can use
the Expression drink back
or yeah
people who are comfortable being drunk
around
[Music]
drug-ish
doesn't mean I fully drunk and then now
I use the wrong lettuce
oh no
abort aborted
he has committed a crime
yes
I mean
trying it first time well yeah
personally I'm
[Music]
I'm not one who drinks at all
I am sober
I mean I've tried
not much but just
like today it tastes weird
it does a weird taste
and then and then some people very few
people said like yeah but you can like
mix it out with a like another drink and
you know once they taste it anymore
yeah but if I like why would I drink
drink it in that easy
what's the point of drinking in that
case
it's not like I'm drinking
soda too
[Music]
mix it out until I can't taste it
anymore and like what's the point
anyway now the messages come
pick here it comes all the messages
that's one
[Music]
when I'm gonna go ahead and ordered my
execution for the crime and spelling yes
that's horrible of you
[Music]
I was born
yeah
so I mean you basically been trying
trying out drinking with people you
haven't you haven't like you haven't
been drinking you have more like taste
in it I guess
okay
I've been sober for an hour one hour
Subway annoying
no and no it's a one hour sober noise
that's what you
[Music]
that's the noisy dude
[Music]
after being sober for water away
but I definitely drink last night in my
20s yes
it's about being responsible
[Music]
the drinking less than you but whatever
you definitely drink less than you did
in the d20s
which we're still in
[Music]
foreign
towards the 30s
you have to be so confusing and it's not
enough time because
there's still a little plenty of people
who just write years without in this
century and like referring to the what
is but the night
17 years we're in the 40s so I think
it's a long time now
[Music]
when our celebrity noises I have no idea
how surprised me with this
meaning I wasn't there
munching on Burgers okay but don't need
anything with this
but I do need this
so copy this
again don't need those things
place it here
Bonnie
and then I smell
[Music]
down here
What freaking things
oh yeah it's perfect
this one I don't need to touch I think
I like this now because it's it's the
body color and this is just black this
one I have to wear is one
here
puppy
puppy create
body paste
better mode
[Music]
okay
and roughness I don't have to touch okay
I don't need
and I can't find any science
thank you
so it's the normal app
all right yeah yeah
so
this is a shot I'm working with me
hey come on my mom's mom's stuffy
Burgers I want burgers
I bought a pack like
not just drinking my diet as well
nothing but fast food and it's already
the kids well why
I mean fast food isn't like
it's bad but it's not accidentally
and I do know about that
film it's about the person
overeating but he must definitely
you can definitely survive although they
really depends on the quality I mean if
you add spots with like places to have
like more proper food a lot like
chemicals
you probably didn't find
one is not best quality food it is the
lucky healthy healthy
at healthy ish let's see let's say that
like that
well yeah I bought
that's why I make my own homemade
burgers
so that's that one
another will copy
of these
now I'm getting the messages
no I said something called Mexican
I don't hear coming some of the messages
that
come on shirts
yeah
put them in here
and now
let's see what is that I hope you are
doing well yeah okay that you are
healthy nasty nurse removing it
foreign
one bag of burgers which contains 10 of
them
and then I decided to
because then I bought
two packs of six buns that's 12 so I put
two buns over which I can have something
handsome
it's not like it's a waste or anything
oh yeah here I need to put insurance
with you
[Music]
and then
it's like oh the bag is ran out like I
know I know there all that why don't
they make matchup it's not a big deal
it's still a bun you can still eat it
it's not like
this
it's not like you're wasting food in any
way I mean if you're right oh we got two
months though I put them in the trash
now we just eat them like it's a
sandwich instead of it's definitely
using the bread the regular bread to eat
the buns then
there we go
but then I just decided to I buy two
bags of burgers that's 20 and then I buy
three packs of buttons that's 18 that
means I have two burgers over and then I
can just fry those and eat them as they
are
again not a waste of proteins
I'll get two birds I'm very very very
sorry I put them in the chest
so yeah
[Music]
back here
indeed she's talking about more burgers
this is content yeah yeah I'm talking
about boogies
I can talk about veggies
there we go
now as you can see
this is the fur and this is the shirt
but I haven't updated the roughness
is badly in the difference between us
and then the him that does the most
thing is the any normal wrapping because
nowadays as far as this doesn't matter
and will not be satisfied this doesn't
foreign
but wait there is more
why the burger become rabbits and the
rabbit become a turkey
it's
it's that's how it works team
why are they still Marcus
are the are the
um wait yeah that's six thousand bit
demon oh this is live
uh I guess the yeah this is why you have
to donate to me so I can get to Market
why is it I thought that's an
interesting name
yeah okay so this
okay okay you might have figured seeing
what the issue is
you might have come up it's not some
something here
so apparently if you post two emails
they switch places
[Music]
they are the same what happens if you
post
three different things a bunny a burger
and uh
and uh
and uh
and
and snail
oh they only oh they okay now I see now
let's see what they're doing it's only
doing in the universe order
so the email you put first will be
replaced by the emote you put last is
this it is due to my code or the twitch
card
see so yeah so when you do you didn't do
a palindrome now but because you put the
burger
so yeah because you put the burger last
the emo to that is first which is also a
burger will be replaced with the burger
and then the donut is the second to last
I would have replaced this second mode
which is a rabbit the rabbits become
Donuts
and then the rabbit is started to last
represent its third emote which is the
donut so Donuts becomes rabbits and
there you go
[Music]
that's the that's what is that's how
it's worked so as long as you can see
that's it it's very simple
and so it's it's it says as long as you
put them as a palindrome it's it's there
going to swap each other in like their
own
it's pretty neat isn't it
so where do we have all scenes we're
going to have seam here because that's
what the original had
I think that sounds good so let's start
with that
we're going to do a height map
not to be confused with a heat map
[Music]
this is
[Music]
we don't need the old Heights
we got
I think I actually hate what I meant
height before that was the joke that was
the thing I was referencing
by the way
[Music]
[Music]
do
do
wasn't perfect for that one
[Music]
I heard some people liked it when I came
nonsense
[Music]
so if I copy these
[Music]
but as long as they are emotes they're
working perfectly fine
there's something wrong with the Emoji
code everything
because that's held separately
[Music]
you want that banana
and I'm licking it already
you haven't even
yeah I will do that
if you're okay with it I I eat the
banana straight from your hand if you
want that
[Music]
will that be the activity on the Pom-Pom
Meetup
peel and banana and I mean she had it
had it for me and I'm gonna eat it from
your hands
and like an animal
[Music]
like some animal
[Music]
wait this doesn't count as
[Music]
yes it's filters they are layered it's
apparently
apparently
when
there we go they should give the
shoulder seams
I got these I'm happy to see you here
quiet wait are you
are quite nice
yep
and then you made a spelling mistake
what okay
and what's the height map in Swedish
did they were the longest name in Poland
yes
here
change I'm happier here looking quack
could that be the space deck space duck
let's go and watch the space deck
since we have people here
what's the code for uh
is twitch.tv
slash
I don't remember what it is
and then I go to another
uh yeah what's the code for only use our
filters oh no I want to fill this
clips
last 24 hours I know it's been more into
the rest I don't know
but it's now it's it's nice to say
something
let's see this
what's that one
step one
okay there we go let's see if I can show
it on stream
there we go
maybe it goes on Space deck
I have no idea how to say hi or map in
Swedish this height is head you might
recognize this similarities to English
height hate
math is
I think in
in this context it would be Carta I
actually don't know how many translated
to anything else
I think caught them like
yay movie time yes we will watch the
space dark
and then I have a second hopefully the
audio works
um okay
sure
whoa where did that go
oh it landed in water okay
thank you
but I did not expect that to happen
just fleeing the space
[Music]
this one
I am very cocky I'm the cockiest cop
wait
no
no I'm not
and that was the second clip
amazing I hope you enjoyed it
[Music]
yes I
[Music]
I am very smart I speak before I think
[Music]
I
I'm indeed the cockiest cookie
[Music]
when
[Music]
I
was not my fault they made the words too
thank you
simulai
once is
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
copy
paste there we go
so let's see this this adds this theme
and this this will also add a scene
in the desired areas
so I will export this as the to
if file a museum which I don't know I
can speed for the rough here
[Music]
so switching back to blender let's see
if I can update there we go look it's
actually working
anyway well I guess I could hide the
body against
Light extra detail
s
yay
but um
I guess they do have a scene down the
front chain
I don't have any other seams I guess I
guess not it's just a piece that goes
around like that
they do have these things that uh that's
that means we're almost done is
secondary or Miami working with cologne
now
[Music]
I've been working
or Raven
[Music]
so
I guess this should be a much
[Music]
I don't know that must be too much
not let me
I was thinking
nice
fine like that isn't
oh let me keeps lurking
can you sound the alarm because again
it's almost your bedtime did you ever
change your outfit wait this was
supposed to change my outfit
ah your requested six minutes again okay
no more dress I guess
I'm not that war I'm not a virgin
It's really because I got a one dress is
that why
do I need to get another dress
I will I will probably do yeah for more
outfits
yeah I need a princess dress yeah
but yeah I shouldn't do that for
I didn't say that one of the outfits
would be a princess
yeah there will be a princess dress in
the game it is
the girl that's the front thing
let's see yeah
probably
preferably and not Escape that area
generally like that you have
anyway
that's the scene
because I think I'm basically done with
the outfit
there you go
right I've been inside out as great as I
hoped
in
in the game
hopefully it will look better than me
because then I have this part
this that I said I've just got pixels
let me duplicate this
and so this is weapon
I said ribbon patch
back with JC here and front or Hydra
it's Joy
kitten we have a kitten here I mean it's
really so long the kitten chest
because kitten is working quite in my
time so quite late
and haven't been able to
catchment of my streams lately which is
which I fully respect owners
should have spelled me this morning
he did this hard working
yeah actually
my friend is
there we go
above on the front so you can see that
and up on the back so you can see that
which I have to adjust a bit funny
and but now I have this shirt yes I can
adjust it to the shirt as well
yay builds Bells out of the way
yeah now that feels already thin now I
just need these straps too
do the same let's hope
[Music]
behind that
okay let's
let's move them
irritating that message first
and then
the I mean that's a bit weird
I should probably move definitely more
to our sign
[Music]
and my both the same amounts
foreign
[Music]
yeah
now it's clicking now I am when I think
I fixed it
okay so and probably
find the potty
don't let them run away
like that
now that's that's my next
if it's not one thing it's another yeah
[Music]
that's more like it
I like that
[Music]
these
okay again right incense
[Music]
I do feel like they should be able to
wrap down like this
[Music]
start from Williams like that smooch
and then
yeah yeah
let's go let's definitely
there we go
that's the outfit
got the girl love you thank you kitten
for stopping by even if this is your
time
it's
all the time
times
it's a lovely time
I want the lovely time
so
yeah it was
debating whether we should but it's kind
of covering up the shoulder anyway so
maybe I don't need to
oh yeah yeah the the last thing I have
done yet is map missing
I could probably watch this thing now
and map these things so they have
properly fall over the body because they
have some
data transferring let's do this
and not that funny because that's not a
complete bunny I said cropped it down
corrupt it down this is ugly bunny
I wish there's a body underneath the
clothes which I need
vertex groups and
nearest facing triplet I see it's a good
mode I like that mode generates
butterfly now
uh weight clean
there you go that's some nice values
and my normal line on I wish they had it
like a check mark you can clean them and
normalize them automatically at the same
time
it would be convenient
well
this one also needs
the same because I created that one and
never fixed me
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and then we
didn't get here
I sit at that day
[Music]
that's my sandwich in there that's this
one here
[Music]
anyway so that's when I was
load the body
where is that what groups near space
interpolated generates
apply
check using a point here they go
acting weights
normalize
Norma lies on
although they do is American spelling so
this is normal normalized but that's it
even though it is European developed
software so if you press s it doesn't
show up however they made an exception
if you do right
right actually write the British
spelling it will all it will be an alias
but you have to spell it correctly I'm
not sure why they couldn't just make
sense that aliases to each other they
would also help with like spelling
universe and stuff whatever
you mighty Church
[Music]
I guess you could argue that they said
the spelling is the international
spelling because it's actually part of
the iso's iso or ISO
I think ISO used a pretty spelling words
but with the is I said e
Berlin which is the Oxford spelling
that's like a international spelling
that if I need to create this planet
that way because s does not like I mean
I wanted to say why I found we need to
spend it on me am I like it makes sense
no it's more like it makes sense to
spell it that way hmm
it's just that it's not necessary it's
better that way that's kind of my
because the SS is making that salmon
surrounded by bounds
anyway
enough about that
generated by the spanning is fine and
it's not like saying if someone is going
to use one or the other day
and I mean there are people who complain
when people choose a certain spelling
whether I'm not gonna I mean I'm just
I'm just making observations
it's also funny when I'm saying
something and then suddenly I love the
messages
what
um like why isn't working
Why didn't it work for you
Maybe
[Music]
it takes
you made it you or did I no I'm like no
I have not said it accidentally mods no
I mean it worked for me so it's not
broken it just hates you
[Music]
and there's nothing set to
uh you don't need to be learned to
unlock
[Music]
okay it is possibly possible that you
have a
because you did two commands in
oh no no no no no no no
no no no remember
I have I have set a timer on the alert
and unlock commands so you can't spam
them
so because you used it in the same man
like 60 seconds or something you
couldn't use it again
that explains but because you need
successfully use it before
and then you learned and then you try to
unlock again and it didn't allow you
that's why
so it does not hate you it didn't grow
up or anything
we use that spam feeling about this
no I think I think the outfit is done
maybe I should take a quick look at
because this shirt and you like pure and
why
let me check what action shade is using
not that I need to copy
the exact shape it's using
um
at least switch position a bit
I'm
not
okay
let me check price
Point where's the
this one
it only means no which texture is
belongs to the shirts itself
um
because the shirt has shading and
everything so it must be something
this is weird
but yeah it's clean as shiny but I can't
find this afternoon
that is it is kind of small
it's located there okay let's check in
that corner
you know bye that's fine
yeah can't find it
yeah not sure what section I should be
able to see me
first one
ah no yeah I'm checking online
I've explained
I thought I went to the question I did
not
nice in your net
okay now I checked
so
yeah I could change the shade of it's
sniking
because currently it's pure white but
her body is not
you know what the actual Shades used
which I shouldn't copied
is this one
so let me try to mix
I need corner
sound like a copy kit
charminated coffee in it
explain it yes and the animation have
definitely been anything actually quite
a good time because I worked at six
minutes
8.4 means now that means it's been 18
minutes
and uh yeah sadly I can't can't make
um uh redeems make a noise like that
does make a noise
[Music]
like annoyance but
what can I do
[Music]
thank you
and then I had the other drawing which
she's using
this coloring
that
is it more of a red coloring
but
foreign
it's more of a pink color
but then if I mix these two I'm mixing a
color that is new
but I color that
and then let's change the colors that I
think
oh it's kind of quite a difference
actually
um
I mean this might
you know
okay
because basically yeah
yeah
it's not a huge difference but it's
better
this is really one did I did I get
everything you feel it really feels like
I'm missing sorry so the reference image
let's bring that one up again
and double check that his sister
reference image yes
this image
which is of course
the smallest part inspired image
because I didn't make that actually it's
more I mean there are similarities
though but
and also
one difference here is that the tail
goes underskirt but if I try to do that
on one phone that would mean I had to
lift up this card so much yeah I'm not
going to do that
how much yeah how much
you begged me to do that
she has such a big fluffy tail here so
her friend is so not going to be shown
from behind anyway
I mean Amy
I don't know if you should consider it
putting
doing something about it
and there's this ox
but I don't think Boulevard should have
saw I mean only sucks while running
outside
would be kind of weird
and I think this is fine
it is
cute image yeah the artist let me check
let me post uh the link to the artworks
that seems fair today
panda
Yes actually
[Music]
like that
give a moment
an affectionate rubbing
hmm
okay I don't have my login business
oh and I guess I just posted anything
it doesn't have a warning and stuff I
mean this is amazing plus Channel
whether I'm talking about that's good
that's the link to the artwork anyway
which I just featured on screen
[Music]
sleep wait are you in bed Panda hey is
it not like 20.
it's part about her but you're hugging
someone's sleeping
I've been hard
yeah yeah
a peeled banana
her Plus
I want to sleep is it late for you it
might be nice to me
are you like yeah because he has 22 at
the moment is you know but I have to
clean up so you have to clean teeth
yeah I think I think I'm done so I
should Dash I'm fine if there's
something else we got back into US quick
sand that off screen stream
so what I have to do now
peace
do this one
[Music]
so
yeah it requires a logging to actually
access badly
I am
I tried to log in but
I did not want
because I don't have a login anything no
but yeah yeah yeah
sensitive the nights I would have yeah
if I could Panda that would be so
awesome I'll buy you playing picky
Giant Eagle for cleaning
that does sound like an amazing dude
and I commit now I actually had to clean
my own place so I don't want nothing
Community seven
so
sadly I am a very busy disciplined
that is such a short skirt originally
there we go
your vacation is finally just cleaning I
mean yeah yeah the case of a cleaning
again sounds great
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
laughs
[Music]
and for the skirt
a basically the same thing but this time
without the Shadows
and then
[Music]
cute
cute kids
yeah I guess these brushes do the main
way
and then for shirts
yeah it would be good
it's really remain right
[Music]
and relaxation
[Music]
[Music]
hey
[Music]
laughs
[Music]
and then the next one
and this one is using my inspirations
[Music]
yeah I guess I just got here with these
and then I need
only shorts this one
and therefore only clothing
that would just be
this shade
dot exactly
yeah this is the first sentences
never meet
the stripes on this one
again the stand one
this one is done there's no metallic
beneath it's understanding is
so I guess I'll just
text that
I'm even happy about the result
sorry
export each of these
nothing to excite me about that
and then
I set it with every outfit
I will put up a
thing on the
[Music]
a thread on the survey if you're not
downloading this website
I don't want to spend it like the street
now
[Music]
okay you can join in the
you can help me decide what each outfit
should be called but I need help with it
because they do have names in in Crash
[Music]
you know I can't use Coco's name for
Stuff
I will take screenshots
screenshots of one
is this outfit on I will also take
screenshots from in
and then yeah you can feel like you
became a longer anymore
is that just me
thank you
I mean if I do stretch it out Mr shot on
the textures
I want to begin
I mean chance to cheat up then I just
it's nice
and then I just make sure the uh
[Music]
it's evenly spacing
so let's see
that we should shoot
[Music]
[Music]
something like that
[Music]
uh yeah I think it's I think that's bad
yeah there we go and then um
post a thread on Discord asking people
for him coming up the name come up
you have the in the channel
roles that you can assign yourself the
outfit drone if you want to be elected
about
when a new posts are put up because
even if you can't come up with a name
you might come up with that at some
point but if you can't come up with a
name you can at least here at least
notified when there's a new outfit which
you might want to detect
so there is that
so
I think I'm done here we can talk more
about the outfit on This Server if you
would like
and don't chat about it in the outfit
name brands that's the only thing to
come up with names I will post it in a
general chat
unless you want me to post it in there
since I made chats but but that's more
for everyone else I think it's in there
since
I'm not I'm not going to say that I have
priority on this area but I mean it's it
is the server for one month
so I think it's funny I need the
exception shout out to let me know if
you don't think so I'm I'm listening to
people
yeah so you're
I don't keep snack doing look at this
cute snack
what do you think
is this a kid's neck
I don't know it's like taking teaspoons
and look at look at the beautiful scared
I think I'm pretty happy with that our
amazing skirt
sorry I mean sure this part could have
been a bit better but
nice sketch other and my problem is that
you can see it's because I'm behind the
whole time so I mean
technically a good spinner
let's put it away
there we go now I can spin it again
definitely not me like this
but it was
made for this orientation
I mean it's still good you know
I think
nice outfit I hope you think so I think
that it's next night so I also have my
yeast
y
okay it's fine everything yeah I'm happy
and super lucky you people
I'm satisfied
and isn't that the most important
I think then it would sound better there
because it's this specific thing we're
talking about and nothing some something
more in general
if I'm not wrong I mean mythical correct
me then if you're talking about a
specific object be it if you're talking
about more about the concepts like an
idea and stuff
I think I'm making it too I remember too
I mean it's hard to remember every
single thing the language is weird I
know the cloud is done but I'm still at
work
you want to go on a ring
let's go on Marines let's go visit
slowly view because I have a great
Authority in a while and she's playing
Splatoon if you're wondering why she's
streaming this like this because she

share

Miss Kitty core and velvet Violet I
don't know this one
foreign

all right anyway

else to say so yeah
oops turning
