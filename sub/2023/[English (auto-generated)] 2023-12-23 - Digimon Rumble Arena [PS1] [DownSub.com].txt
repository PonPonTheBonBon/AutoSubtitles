stream is starting phonal Cosmic Powers
ITP living space okay I know I know that
one that Hey where's the picture where's
the
game why is it messing with
me come on show the
game it might show up as soon as I press
play and never had the opportunity to
play PS1 games as kid let's see how this
one looks like
H it it will be very
poal yeah that's my that's my
English it
work there we go yes I failed welcome by
Pani continue thank you for the raid
thank you
Raiders right at start of the stream I
was watching it play some I
didn't
I've been so
busy packing and
stuff
so so hey I hope everything is okay with
you no
nool I'm happy you decided to
ra um can I help everyone
here now I just need to remember what
I'm supposed to do here iide from wiing
up
first oh yeah I was just supposed to
beain
no it's hard to win against this B
pretty much all my runs have been
terrible but what kind of runs did you
do was familiar with Yu-Gi-Oh forb the
memories and sof the more popular games
to Ranger resent evil nothing solid Etc
yeah game doesn't look
better it's um
I think they could have done better with
game it's a bit SP
bones
digu it's like it works
but it's not it's not the
best definitely not the best I could I'm
not good at the game
they do they have put a lot of
still even though it does come across as
some people said like a Smash Bros
clone with heal bar pon pon the cheese
continues this is the second stream by
the way not the sad I'm not sure what
you mean by
three
and it's not ke I mean and I mean you
might unless you call
Bing very
cheesy look at the yellow and the B so
much
cheese
no stop that
okay this isn't
working anyway do K I don't want run if
that I'm not familiar with
that M you can lower a little bit the
game volume yeah this game is can be a
bit loud here good good okay I'm dead I
see I should probably Lo
again okay
I'm probably not speaking you'll never
be a match for me speaking my
loudest basic a super hard Pokemon run
yeah let's let's
see where comment I mean I'm down by one
anyway he basally super hard Pokemon
randomiz with r single Pokémon Peres oh
oh single Pokemon that that that will
suddenly be
tricky H Perman death would definitely
make it annoying only if fight trainers
and lots of
others and lots of other rules I assume
okay so let me never be a match for me
let me do this for real
now continue I wish it was a quick
restart option or like what the game
really should do considering you can
restart um if you
lose uh if you lose the first battle it
should be an in
like um instant fre
start I feel
like like if I'm down by one that's
just
I would I
continue a lot of there's actually
plenty of games that have this isue
there
where stop
that yeah I'm really not good
plenty of games
where if you mess up the you have to
basically start everything but with
being down by one whatever it
counts instead of just resetting you at
zero no
I
no
yes perfect I get to do a lot against
this
B like crash for is the same issue
because you're supposed to complete a a
level with that Ma Max three deaths but
if you die before you reach the first
checkpoint you restart from the start of
the level which is the exact same as if
you were to restart the level but it
still counts is at
death crash three and the Crash insane
Trilogy did not count that as
dying so the death C should only count
if you spawn from a
checkpoint but yeah that that
when that that's my demonstration of
many games have this
issue
what it's perfectly
fine uh because for some reason this
game has a point
system I guess I guess in this game you
do keep your
me yeah
um
there there are of course ways
to like
that
ah
so run run
run run
no
disappointed come back anytime you lose
yeah I have I think I've defeated like
the boss in a single round once or
twice but I have not been able to do it
with two rounds in the same like
battle it doesn't count it
as oh yeah it's the even though the as
far as I can tell there's noal
difference
but that's
the that's the yeah there's a high
attack and low
attack I'm losing health so
quickly that Ultra is so bad
too
uh sides from shielding come back
anytime
lose oh
I'm
yeah is that
is
I was a
key
no oh
CH never mind
myn
nope fa again speaking is super
hard
you you
lose in times of
difficulty
this
boss had a technique like last time I
played it like
increase but the boss is
Tak too long to
Shield yeah
bsy almost face r as my best attempt so
far yeah
not and I've done 400
shs over 400 that's
that's a lot of
runs no stop
it Diamond storm time yeah yeah I'm I'm
get I'm guessing there that I will
eventually get
there stop it I'm trying stop it trying
to attack
you hello
Bailey
disappointed come when
day I will defeat these BS I don't I do
not remember what next Pokemon I do not
remember when the next Digimon is in the
list
hello thank you for stopping
by thank you for showing up I don't
know no hit the attack boxes the hit
boxes are to B oh a
star doesn't do anything
die yes die oh yeah check that sounds
good I hope
they off yes it
works
okay I do need
this and I'll do the
hyate you'll never be a match for me go
you lose
hydrate ready now it's
t
oh look at the damage
defense no oh
wait why is that not allow I I really
don't like how twitch does not allow
trans
yeah to be all low
word and it it considered trans to be a
highly offensive
word because I've only set it to trigger
on highly offensive
words and it's really
um I'm pretty sure you can call me a man
and twitch doesn't care which should be
considered highly offensive but yeah
calling me trans which is what I am
that's not
with
and which is
stupid you're trans super here oh am I
thank
you what would be your trans seam catch
I don't know like I should probably have
done a bit
more I do not know what and
SE no stop
it die die die die die
yes funny did
it whoa you're not very good huh
you imine not which allowing you were
specifically you were trans
themed
no
okay now it's time to
win nope G
away so I managed to win one B like one
round not for but yeah I did lose the
one before that which I don't think
should count
because that's kind of
why if I lose the first round the second
round is
just
annoying cuz if I do manage to win the
second round which I did there I have to
win the third
round I understand it's a best of three
nario but in a system where I can retry
over and over again
our best of three system doesn't
work because it's not the best of three
it's it's until I
win no no no stop
it
hold
on no oh I suck
you and also don't like how the boss
just goes through
attacks
digu yes let's go through my
BL
Oh yay I won the first
round moment time you
win ready this should have been a one if
we didn't lose the
first uh round last second
SE is
life good cheesing no it's not
cheese
moment what is
that s [ __ ] yes it will be S [ __ ] in 9
minutes
he's currently 50 minute cool down oh
down
okay I can
wiy no not like
that die die die die die die die it's
not almost dead yes I
did I finally did it who you're not very
good huh

it do not know how long I've been stuck
on that
bus but I did
it let's keep I have play I have played
cred like three times
now yes no
what and also realized I did not
change same as yesterday let's not
yesterday the day before
that celebration time that's not a
celebration celebration for you

no stop
that we have problem reaching this
card
digu path finding is a bit tricky no
wa
we go the stupid
attack and I win not be defeated you win
I was about to lose but good thing I had
a stupid
attack digol dig
volution on going for the
tank take this now I can also Evol I
don't know what is it some kind of super
plus I don't know what else it would be
oh oh here a you broke my attack I want
to try making this one dish I saw
earlier this
week boom
and the video on YouTube isled
maon W that's
my or pasta with
onion oh thank
you I would like a bit more than just
pass that
onion I see past the onion and more
I
canol I canol and then I I'm going
to
ha you fell off the
stage I will not be defeated you win
they does use more than that I
so a stupid
look it's a cat poke Pokemon it's a
cat Pokemon I don't know are they stored
in a dig device in your
pocket for a
Pokemon ah a new
Challenger I don't know why it can't
just haven't F black World game
on going be another
character and also I didn't unlock Black
so I'm not exactly sure all right it's
this boss on this
level boss he basically a boss
character at this
point
like
how is more more difficult
than actual
boss y not going that great at the
moment oh the Icey stage yeah the I
stage terrible for some reason it feels
really slippery when I'm trying to move
around
but
obviously sleep for computer too why am
I always facing the wrong
way yeah very easy to
this you
lose it to lose technically you should
like
lose one round every time but like just
one attack and then you that what am I
supposed to do like from shielding I
guess g are supposed to be shielding
but dig
volution
no come on and again I just have to I
always have to hold P
down
just just what has to happen
but the computer barely flies
anyway
my attack Mak me
fly I just can't consistency grab if
there only was a button to
grab a dedicated grab button must be
destroyed you
lose is that too much to ask for just
just I think I think that is one of the
reasons why I'm not a fan of fighting
games in general they just don't have
buttons to do actions you have to input
commands that's why that was a that's
why I prefer Smash
Bros because you can actually you can
actually make inputs for what packs you
want to do instead of having to do a
bunch of complicated
commands doing do actually inputting the
the thing you want to do shouldn't
be it shouldn't be the difficult part
with the
game in my
opinion yes this this is how I want this
game look I grabed this B does
anything confus cheating Dragon Ball C
doesn't require inut commands to use
specials what special well that's that's
something need
something no there
who's your creator you
lose and people people make excuses like
but you need you need a lot you need a
lot of different commands because
there's so many attacks you can do
no I think I think you can do
that like with like
I would say eight eight input
buttons we can do like eight directions
of the
joystick and that
64 commands just that
way and then you could
combine buttons as
well that is a
lot
both combinations you can
do oh
yeah that's that's only because I played
like games like spy and crash and racing
games when you want to do a command you
do the
command
oh no be Shield against
that I
Rel
no
no there we go just had to be
a do that way I youn but I got game out
that means that my full score is
gone like every 10,000
points going want to
head I mean sure I'm not
getting look it worked f
the Comm fell
down
no use both trigger buttons to open
your dragon
ball just requ you to hold right trigger
open your command menu then you press
the corresponding button to use
yeah like you could you could have the
four buttons on the back side to modify
the four face
buttons that's for back buttons
multiplied by the four face
buttons that's
a
okay that's 16 new
buttons aside from not
having aside from not holding down any
of those buttons that's additional
eight so
that's 7
different I'm counting for now play same
time now I meant to say
not 20 different input that was I'm
going to say the for fade button
combined with one of the buttons on the
back gives it 20 different
inputs times the eight directions of the
stick that's 11 160 inlets how many
different attacks do you
need well right bumper locks on target
left blocks yeah I mean depends what
kind of fighting game you wouldn't need
lock on Target in this kind of fighting
game
this is
SA
like how how do I grab so consistently
like the computer
does I don't think the computer is doing
inut I think the computer's
just telling the character what to do in
certain
moment
objects must be
destroyed you lose
an yeah you don't need to see me fail
here probably not going to be done can
over
in these games you do have two jumps
normally you would use the first jump to
get off the ground but if you get off
the ground without using jump you still
have two
jumps most games would you would have a
ground jump and then air
jump nothing this
game
that's not how this game
works got my
attack didn't meant press that Buton
but any mood from that but
probably at the edge day
no I land P one
nice
aha that's how it come to your
gra no stop okay ah you fell too far
back so it couldn't reach me
boom so right at for open
at SK like and I forgot what kind of
skill but it allows you to escape com by
counter
attacking Counterattack skill
there we go this is how it
did okay no stop gramming
you
someone try to do a
tornado
over welcome back everyone look I did
not defeat these
ttic
as I suspected it would take me more
than 3 minutes to
do
I
can fall out
yes this is cheap but I think the
character Che
to we
go I'm basically fighting and
involed andol
Digimon
guess
unol I mean there's like two two forms
before this form but is the form and
then there's like
the okay after all that battling yay
maximum
celebration it's time find time to fight
the acual
find
meu that quick
attack that didn't oh I mean it didn't
work
wish I had a projectile kill it kill it
kill the B kill the
boss like
that so much easier than previous
character which is not a boss might
should be easy because there's no
slipper slippy slide
exactly and you cannot fall down fall up
which was
the not
on take so much
damage
I
went did probably not involved and just
kept it for the next
round and then where you belong you
move
ready come on stop locking me like that
that's just
cheating oh sad have some
noodles no stop doing
that just Chey come
on
come on this is just
cheating this is just maximum
cheating like my armor
I I'm glad for that I guess you have to
show I
guess I can of got off track
here show show what it looks like with
all all of your new pieces
together dig
volution
no no don't
die
no this
bosses
was is so
annoying and I don't even get to see my
m i mean if you're you
lose you wearing a
helmet
digivolution
that doesn't
work
just the way to come here cancel your
attacks as in not doing anything like
as far as I
know the point of
uh the starting animation of the attack
is so you can react to it and defend
yourself against it but not for this
boss this boss if this boss does talking
animation the boss freezes you in place
you can't do
anything and if you're doing your Ultra
is this attack H it just
cancelled even though I saw the point of
having a long startup was for you to be
able to counter the attack but nope it
does not game does not allow you to do
that yay one round
one yeah but I lost the first round that
means that if I lose this round I have
to win two times a g
have two short arms to short arms grow
some longer
arms come on
come
on
and you weakling you
lose yeah it's hard to win with against
the boss that's just cheating all the
time just
cheating
ready
rum thank you
sh
y
sing about
attack gu you stand
here do
nothing
okay
dead go go pon pon hello sweaty
socks sweety
sock sock for sweet no sock for
Sweat Go Go pon
pon some chil
see here we
go
we going just stop
Ching
that and defeated the boss in the first
round so easily and now I'm strling
again you
lose
continue dog eating
spet I
get spaghetti first run I mean
um
this is like the fixed
run
Eggo by Oh you mean
ego that's that's a
problem I don't sure to had that
inflated eego when it came to this game
did
I if I had I didn't mean
to so you tell so you tell you succeeded
with the Bunny come back Oh you mean
tell yes I did you
lose after many many attempts I man
managed
to too many
attempts stop cheating I mean at least
that's not cheating I mean except that
they have like a single frame reaction
time that's a bit cheating
though
yeah yep get getting locked in place
can't do anything can't cancel the
attack
like that's a stupid boss continue such
stupid
boss ready
Rumble dig ball
digu well but we continue to
try yes this is my attacking
now
what
okay I can't I can get two Jabs in and
then just
nothing the boss blocks the rest or
something I don't know what's I I don't
know how this game
works I don't know how the game
works
than that's heal
me
yeah think a frame
reaction
don't
you'll be unbeatable once you you clear
the game with you'll never be a match
for me I'm still I'm still really bad in
the game
though
continue fting games is
not
see if you like watching someone
struggle
nice like why can't why can I only get
two attacks in why can't I get the third
attack in disappointed
come back why does the boss work
differently from every other character
I've been
fighting can't change the rules of how
the game works of against the final boss
and then assume that I can defeat the
like this
is this
is this is not what I'm been practicing
for
H what you struggle I prefer saying
winning a hard for with
the because
struggling and tacks that just remains
on the
stage
disappointed come back anytime you
lose I just defeated the boss first
try
ready like it where final Bon at C race
in Crash pass well I did defeat the
final boss in Crash pass did not
complete 100% though
but i' probably go back to crash bash
doing it 100% at some
point come on what happened to
shielding this stupid
ging how am I supposed to win if I can't
do
anything you
lose I don't know how I do
that
digol
oh come
on
thank why is so much
smoke and locked in place couldn't do
anything if I jump and attack and land
on the ground the just locks in place
and then you just can't do any input it
just nothing
happens that is so stupid how am I
supposed to win against the boss if the
boss can just freeze you in place and
have a free attack like
that what am I supposed to
do
yeah like Shield nothing works no inputs
is responding dig
volution I'm going to spam that attack
because this is the the only way I canat
the boss bu
is should have done
something really
works yeah that's that's how defeat the
but I will not be defeated by spamming
the same attack I mean the boss spaming
the same
attack
yay one win in the first round too
which is
beneficial
come
on nothing
pleas go go go go
go he come
on nope
cancel wrong
way
no
disappo canceled with nothing back any
that's that's the power The Bu have no
you're not allowed to do the attack
that's that would make me lose the
battle there for
let
digu kind of like when you're fighting
the botes on in Hearthstone like now
that that card would be too powerful
you're not allowed to use
it is going to destroy it when it play
it anyway
thank there
go dookie dookie B he's the
bus are you hungry you
win dooky bus there we go I finally
won
wooho yeah not
great
so
yay GG I'm finally
after many
attempts I did it

progress because I guess I forgot to the
happy there you go this is why I but
this is
like black or Gman which I still haven't

though
Diamond come on attack me come on come
on come
on you can do
it this level is so
stupid are any Swedish transitions
you're looking forward to I
mean I'm not sure what would count as
sest Traditions compared to like
other
countries
Traditions I don't need to evolve should
get a bonus for not
evolving and a bonus for the highest
combo give me like highest combo I got
times s points you win
ready Diamond
Storm come on take me come on come on
you can do it oh you jump into the
lav get out from here digu this is my
platform
ow there we
go now we're back
digu
ow W can cancel
my
why did you do
that this is
mine
oh you win I
didn't this this AI is fantastic oh
ads sorry about
ads it's it's a boss I'll be failing the
boss
I'm dead
so is anyone here who doesn't have ads
at the moment I can
wait I I'll type that in
chat and then I'll punish the h bus why
you spent Soo long reading about
Christmas gnomes that was
fast I just wish I
didn't fail the first time Christmas
gnomes yeah yes the
um I think that's I think that's what uh
people tend to translate the the
Swedish
um because a gome in Swedish is Tom and
that's the word also used for Santa
Claus but comparing like
a
um but but it is quite a difference
between like a garden gnome and like
Santa Claus
still I still still see those different
things like the way the way how gnome is
not used for Santa Claus is what I'm
used to so translating the swsh for
Gnome to gnome when referring to Santa
Claus yes feels
wrong H remember to feed your T porridge
rice porridge
yes never done that I'll eat it
myself I'll take some porridge and
cinnamon and
milk
maybe some sugar to
eat haven't had rice per porridge I
haven't bed po
it I need to get some I I like eating it
both warm and
cold and I mean benefit of having it
cold is that you don't need to eat
it it's easier that
way but I said I don't know how what is
counts as Swedish compared to like other
countries I don't know like rice
porridge yeah that's a Christmas thing
but I don't know if like if that's just
a Swedish tradition or more commonly
across the world I'm not sure I have
ever had Forge well well
then run run run run run run run
run that white that was the wrong button
I SW run run run run run
run no are you
shielding
sing do
it well let find some rice porridge and
try
that
no some
way nope
canceled I'm being
cancelled back down to where you belong
you lose oh ready r

time
Pap ARA for Esports oh orts
wear is that is that what this is what
pon pon should wear while she's doing
Esports play huh which well I guess I
have to use worm
on I don't want to use worm just a
worm see I'll get a c one
something going going for two two hours
so
far ready Rumble
ready I'm never
ready
all let's do
something head
but okay that was that's yes that makes
sense just pushing
around no yeah that's the that's the one
I
just yes like
that yes look at this
strength
no I went back to
where no I'm I'm
away what is this
come
on come on
Noy I won clean
andry I
lost
no I lost what is this this isn't the
time for celebration because that's
apparently your
celebration I said dig bom digy
I'm getting close
CL this this cat is too strong affecting
my
M this cat
catm go there the back like they should
be
dig
volution look another
worm worm versus
worm I'm going CH up
my this is such we sounds
Vol very easy
spam
oh what nice platform
there the it's the act tform
of
I up
okay cat turns into Asian yeah Asian
Dragon I
mean what this meant to
be um kind of weird like
H yeah that's now way
despawn it's kind of
weird I said dig it's
weird and it's not going well this is
the first battle I'm already losing
cardu cat's I not
this
no just
stay Asian Dragon with very long horns
won you win yeah finally first win ready
now you just have to win
again oh the level remains broken
now dig dig I do think the actually
don't know it's the second version of
better it does it's been a while since I
played it last
time but I want to remember it's being
woru party game kind of
like and they did change it
from what is this by the way oh it's
this
one
such weird
noises oh this oh
nice was meat was kind of one full
anyway
but
ow ow
I said dig B digu the Weir of all is uh
C named after worm turning into green
Ultra
well but what I do like about the second
game is that the the the evolution has
three steps you
win
but it's more towards uh
platforming I wouldn't mind
another Digimon game they should have
more more steps of
evolution doing like one onone doing
less platform more like probably more
platform like this game so we still
have
positioning let relevant at like part of
the
battle it shouldn't be like the
massive the The Habit focus on platform
as a second
G and have more
moves here we
go digol woron dig volution
okay I guess that
happens okay this
yeah oops
digivolution
I don't know
maybe sometimes the AI does stupid
things
no that's [ __ ]
heal let's evolve again
then
dig wor dig
volution I did turn
around okay
sure course in the second game you also
have Ultra but you have to evolve to the
to the thir stage and then build the
Meer
again me I think I think something like
that you you after you third stage
again and then you can do your Ultra and
you de evolve when you
Dieu Evol
wor what if you could do your Ultra in
in exchange for the evolving one stage I
don't
know
oops I don't think that went in my
favor you
lose losing the first
round dig ball wor dig
volution
Warp digol
digivolution
and by having more special attacks being
available it could
also I think the case for some of these
special
attacks where you have
uh did you do
that where you have a cool down before
you can do the attack again you can
still do other
attacks that would be a way to
prent so much
spam they actually must have VAR your
attacks you going that why are you going
after
that of course you're going
back
no down arrow what's a down
arrow wor dig
volution
wrong way again I
was facing the other way
there
look at this stupid
a war dis
down arrow attack down okay so attack
down is a down arrow but attack up
is some weird
shell
okay sure that makes perfect
sense now come
on die
already there there
go didn't that attack up with an up in
that
case consistency what's
that
dig no Y what are you
doing nice can
than attack
up oh attack up no you're not supposed
to get it
digu
no wait you didn't get it I guess maybe
have because you have B then back down
that sounds good
then my
sweets all I complet about to do this
attack attack up oh
no
come no save this he don't I press this
big red button that says do not friend
you oh
why you running
away I'm just doing a little
attack why is the computer not
evolving yes do not press the button
that says do not
press oh I'm being
eting Evol woron
volution
boom and then get rid of the oh it
didn't can we won should have thrown the
dead body off the
stage so we don't have to deal with
it
tell oh no it's also kind of weird since
it's not connected to anything it just
has two wires flopping from me well it's
wireless
then get away from me have a no way
where you going we're fighting
here not
no get back down here who fighting here
righted
no I'll take
that what does the yellow one
then on now your chance Ball but it has
wires okay that sounds sounds about
right
no why am I sent off the level so
far chocolate do give your worms
chocolate that sound like
I why didn't you Pi it you can't just
walk
down
goodbye
ow oh I did not get hit
actually the weird flicks the worm that
did confused
me did they get a plus sign see there's
a plus sign for increase the gauge and
minus sign for
decreasing developer need to figure out
something that's called
consistency see yeah that was a stupid
decision that was a stupid
decision
oh I am so happy you
win ready
Rumble dig
volution I don't think you complete the
main man in decision
thing oh my it's
tornado
ow okay still hit me and I'm the one
falling down of course of
course come
on
come on come
on again you're picking up the bad
ones
yeah fighting the boss with this woron
is going to be
tricky
dig
look happy we not
longer come
on yellow remote car is a remote Ste
does nothing with guard nothing
so useless
card what's the point of the
card it's not that you can't for the
computer to evolve because to Wi evolve
regardless
of even in bad
situation let
demonstrated when it comp shouldn't
evolve it computes the
levels
come down
for no i s
down
many of the other
ones inant
Evolution where did the music go oh

been much of a
threat

you see I want something very I don't
know I don't know what else I was
looking for I never seen one SP Shield
before maybe because I had a
different maybe continue
maybe the is doing a lot of weird stuff
in this game maybe maybe because you
aren't playing the game in a weird way
like I do
I'm confusing that that's my that's my
strategy I'm confusing the
computer computer doesn't know what to
do okay you know what come
on
digu
what's this what's this for
Jor what have I done to deserve
this confusion technique on

confuse
Digimon

put in
trash doesn't seem like a great way to
move a boxes to just dump them into the
hole in the middle like
that ready
R the level design doesn't make
sense lower
wise I can't have that in a fighting
game can
we leave me

I think I won at the end of
that this
amazing fall
down
well St
close
digu almost that
again
no if the yellow one like forced your
Alti that that would be
annoying I feel like you win most of
this level fight with just see next to
the lava po
yeah yeah
probably fun
that speaking of thousand lav pools
jumping one that's will play in like
some minutes I will I will wait for the
to come back before I
continue is don't know hello
I actually survive that dig I'm
surprised that
was not land on the
thing
I'm trying to cheese the
lemon
ow yes that's how we
do
ow no oh that was
close okay now
I'm that's oh give
away you
lose continue let me just take four and
a half minutes
instigator
welcome that's
a that's a great
Bo
welcome going for some
Digimon I'm not I'm not that great at
this game so don't don't expect some
amazing game
play
especially considering just got the game
overare right before this round and I'm
doing
this
digu
like you like watching someone overcome
there well I stepped too close to that
one dig
volution overcome
challenge of this
game
okay this demon is annoying oh you're
not supposed to be close
up
oh come on I think that dig
volution now
are going to repeat
this I made a mistake there I didn't
mean to do that I didn't mean to F no
problem you lose I me yeah ready Rumble
I was planning of doing it a slightly
different come
on dig volution that's how dud I came
here from seeing your 3D model work from
the
verb that sounds interesting
um oh from tw Twitter now I I get
you he not why am I fighting the wrong
way I haven't seen that bird in a
while yes yeah I did post the uh um you
said that you shut
up
hey I have done
some yeah I did I did stream while I
made those but I
haven't
Dreamed a model making a model making
stream in a
while what they do to me being busy
moving which is going to happen in just
two days that's going to
start
driving
amazing that
worked it's done
you
win ready
Rumble the goal is to fix the while do
the last uh outfits have not done yet
for p
Pon and then play Crash 4 with the pum
mod with all the outfit
your Alti actually did a thing for has
done a lot of
things to be
honest oops it is a good Al it's just I
need to use
P oh there we go that's that give me a
moment
uh let me
uh
just fill up some
water while the ends are playing
anyway
here
go swimsuit
time mandatory upon sub
celebration oh no you stole my clothes
while I was gone how that's stat SHO
taking a sneaky peek while I was in the
way while I wasn't
here well I hope you like the
design I didn't make it myself I mean I
did use the base drawing and then I
modified on top of
that
so
so yeah well it's just a few seconds
left now so 40 seconds more
specifically so
um then that would be 30 minutes of
swimsuit in this lava level I guess
swimsuit will work considering the heat
of the lava need to even though the
dress should be quite cool
already I don't know what would feel
cooler the cooler p p is cool need
some okay anyway back to the
game
see it
works didn't do as much damage as I
hoped I
no
who I guess it's because the character
jumps and
then dead
and then you add the knockback with your
attack it all adds together
really how did I lose how did that t
play so
terribly V headbutt V punch V
tackle
vit V
sleep me
on
vital
V
aha you like
that we spin the arm attack
S I tried to
jump I didn't mean to go into the lava I
mean come
on
uhoh I try to be
sneaky no problem you lose but not
sneaky enough and now went down by one
no
now digu wor evolve into something
good this is good I
guess
digon dig
volution
come
on okay I should done that done the way
around
I can't take
it
oops
okay why I
have why do I have so much strugle with
just during a single battle against
some some non boss
character if I consider blackw Raymond
as a boss
character
ready
Rumble which I guess could be considered
B
character yeah should not have done that
I said
dig dig
volution sh have not done
thatter
okay nicely
done no
bomb I was a bit confused why nothing
happened when I pressed the button the
first
time
that can actually R here oops andless I
get attack
no
yes I did it feel like I'm taking more
damage when I fall down this it because
I'm this because of my
time yeah definitely taking more
damage
I don't think type effic
efficieny is a good thing to have a
fighting game like this characters is
stronger than that character in this
case I don't know if there's that
between the characters but like yeah
this is
a nature based
character and therefore this character
takes more damage by lava compared to
this character who is I don't know water
based or
space i i blue and
like but it's probably punching and head
butting and stuff it should be like
physics physical
based like so that means that one
character is just objectively worse on
this level than the other one and that's
not a fair
battle makes sense I guess
but don't think that's a good nice done
there I don't think it's a good game
design no move so
quickly hello
girl now I'm doing
digon
wow
yeah don't know maybe see while for
confus just jumping the lava or if you
seeing wow because I'm failing so much
at the moment see
com yeah yeah okay that was that
continue that was
amazing amazing
combo ready yeah I'm string a bit
here
think lava
D
nice
they ghost for that I don't know
why I just have to win this battle 10 10
10 for femon style oh even even even a
get a
better from the P pun than I get
you yeah for for
salty come here come
here I
that was I so small I should not be hit
by it
see how never going to win
this you
lose ready
Rumble come
on
my dig dig
volution
when nice sweet I me
say
behind dancing around the lava
pool but there's too much lava down
there and I take so much damage from it
so stop
it
there we go that's
how guess that's the strategy I should
use against the
Boston I'm dealing damage
so
nice see Al is good I just need get it
to hit which shouldn't be hard because
it has quite large activation
area the opponent gets Frozen with it
so I'm still so bad at getting it to
work plus the computer loves to walk
into it sometimes
too someone to get it and risked going
in someone by that I mean demon and even
risk going into the lava for it but I
stole
it and you went into lava without any
reason
no
digu s time number
two that was be
Dre
downa
ow
no
exactly where I didn't want to
go on I can also
spin look at these SPS okay you win you
win okay I have to get this to work
now there we
go Oh I thought thought that was going
to miss that w i I threw it out and
randomly and it worked in my favor this
time oh no reapermon this is going to go
bad I also have a sword this
like
I said dig ball dig I do I am
slightly that not
work chasing
me you're going to
chase
not exactly what I wanted to
do the first
round you weing you
lose ready
Rumble
no is this some kind of
punishment damn that's
inst that
really quite embarrassing oh wait it
happened wait SP from under under this
this
work
that's how you do
it and then
die C through the Alti with an
Al and swim is
back it
respawned
continue
at least that works as the first
move I don't have any
projectiles
digu now we
on
well I great okay
in the middle of the B
see okay this isn't
working P Pon I'll go out for groceries
now
brief but thank you for brief

hit
yes you can Shield against it but she
decided to stop shaling for whatever
reason that's a
win I

win but no high score only 40,000
points I need at least 80,000 so then
then I can fill the whole list with just
P Pon
sces actually did manag to do that with
Worman who would have thought
that
ARA probably some
people I mean it's me playing
so are you to play with huh Von did I
say Von or
woron I didn't win with woron and now
now it's time for
Von isn't it strange that
the Digimon text somehow works
for like matches Japanese
one one to
one actually don't know
I would assume
the coming
down we have a b
hereu single move do you need anything
more
amazing amazing just to I mean this
first balance I guess the computer isn't
doing like the
best
effect out
nice I guess the attack just goes on
even if you don't get
Theus or enemy I should
say didn't get attack by being carried
away
that was the one I
want there you
go many attempts then I got to
work a dead
body food for
tonight look another
Pon isn't Digimon like Pokemon
like a species not a character thing
it does get a bit weird when people talk
about the Pokemon ass characters and
there are species of char
PES now I pack up
run
that just Spam
move I mean this these movies can of
spam
to demon does not have a projectile but
a protile himself
protecti
projectile protecti is a projectile

level I guess this works
to
I said dig dig
volution I guess it
wor that
big you are
small dig
volution some speak quickly cuz I assume
it's exact same timing
for how long they have to
speak before the animation
starts landed on the
platform and then and then it speak
quickly just to fit in the line and then
there just
silence they didn't need to speak that
quickly

wi those are the rules of the game oh

uh the stun effect instead would mean
that the compu would do a follow up

Digimon is off placed and then there's
this

is the evolution of cmon and this should
be black or
