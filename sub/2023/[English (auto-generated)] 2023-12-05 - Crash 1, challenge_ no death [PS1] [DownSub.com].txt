early
start
like streaming
Sly
so it's R here I S you got
first
no
so the old school
intro than cutiful hello
jeto let's start the pr Venture see us
doing this time
of oh oh hi
hey where did my dress
go
back those 10 seconds felt short I don't
know 10 seconds a good
time that
time short short enough time for you to
to get a good good
look 600 Point well
spent I guess
so
so yeah I don't care
about I don't care about this stuff or
me
swimsuit
yes the swimsuit will stay
on I think you could props props up it
to a mean and just do a
longer
maybe just yeah just testing it out for
now I think I thinking it would be like
a I mean it feels quite a long
time problem this game is the the end
but that gray screen should appear every
time otherwise I died and respond from a
checkpoint though it does not prove that
I died and respond from the
start okay let's
continue
yeah I should probably make it a bit
longer in that
case let's go
getting
stuck but I don't want the bonus
around so now so this is the last bonus
ignoring
that
wh
and then there's these there you
go yeah I could should
probably let me take a
quick add that in
back to the
game I can't put that away my phone
somewhere there back to the
game yeah I could
to maybe do 30
seconds six time six times
longer
come here
must I stepped on the bounce bouncy
box
oh roxies you got you found a star
yeah the Stars should have a different
description this time
hello I see some
otes yes missing that
one
and then being carefully in
end there we go bouny B bouncy B oh my
bounc
too
well so let's let's do that change then
let's change
the redeem to be let's double the cool
down but make the length of the
redeem to No 10 seconds to start that is
three times
Leng double Leng cool down three times
the length of the r while it's active
it's it sounds fair same
price you keep wearing swimsuit because
people can't redeem
it
that is
why now now the sports isn't ke the swim
seat isy more
Sports and swim
seat and
sports
so many
outfits but in new uh that new
outfit
redeem does like
a it ignores the current outfit and just
changes the outfit for now 30 seconds I
didn't change the description the
oh only need up the
description so it's
correct now the description is
correct so so that one will not be part
of the queue and we just activate
whenever you activate
[Music]
it so due to
using
mix it up queing system that means it
will technically take out 30 seconds
from
your from the current
at timer but the time the outfit is 15
minutes I
[Music]
think removing 36 from that I think is
fine
so wait for me
leave I do have 50,000 to
spend yeah I will
make I should
have made it timing with that a bit
better yeah when when
I
change my
channel when I switch over to this 3D
model of pon pon I will add a bunch of
functions you can
use so you have so you have stuff to
spend your points on but you all your
veterans oh reman sneaks in hello all
your veterans will have so much points
so you can just spend stuff when pay for
redeems whenever you feel like
[Music]
like and then the boss will remove the
masks I'm rude of the B
the someone me
something
okay no how rude
wait yeah you start with a double mask
on bosses I forgot about that at least
this B
there we
go not sure what else is
[Music]
tricky that
button that's the button I supposed to
press okay time to be careful
I want this one good I have some
protection oh it
lagged the worst
moment okay remove that
one no I said the wrong
way yeah it
worked dir
boom get out of the way
tortoise
um
P Bey and you have
protection is this a good idea to wear
protection you
know
who knows what things you need to have
protection
against
who get rain for work got to be running
3 hours of sleep and bunch of coffee
they'll have to last about 1 hours well
you can do
it you are actually pretty good at it
for in my
experience I believe you can do it I do
think you should try to get a bit more
sleep
but
yeah
indeed protection is good
e
protection
a I can get the gem on this level I
can't get the gem on this level I miss
the first
[Music]
box the very first
box
this
[Music]
side
boom nice that was so tricky when I was
young but now I can get
it
wao it's a scary
level great but you missed zero
boxes last level of the first
world okay
so this wi Street will
be I am open for ideas for what to oh
yeah the hog also removes
the cuz the what they do in the boss
spells is that they give you double
mask and then
they but they did not do not take into
consideration what you had before
that so to be
sure that you don't not proceed after
boss with more M than they had before
that they simply resets theam M count to
Z something
it is
some some African language I don't know
which it is even though this is supposed
to be a
Str
W okay go away monkey what makes this
Australia because it is set in
Australia like officially set in
Australia I don't I don't think EXA
because this is the
um yeah I don't remember they it's
possible to look up the
face online anyway the uh
this is this the insanity Island I
thought it was like I was thinking it
was like a w island or something but
maybe it's maybe there's multiple
Islands
which uh I mean in this game it is three
islands which are located I think to the
east of
Tasmania
Tasmania
okay no problem so far oh

level
who that was
tight just make sure I don't get B level
two
complete so yeah so now the the redeem
should work
properly and it's available already in
almost one minute and some
seconds yeah if you're using the web web
version of the twitch set it does tell
you it it actually has accounted for the
cool
down they have not added that to the
mobile version they really
should
I do think the cool down should be
visible when you're on the selection
screen as
[Music]
well how I messing up
I
want to complete this
challenge
what oh it moves slowly if I touch
it I didn't know that was a
SC

mean I'm at
moment wa have a weird choice of outfit
in the
winter

especially if you're a bunny with a lot
of
fur I mean the sports for is quite
she does have her exactly that's s it
snow

only six B boxes that's not bad has six
bunnies I'm not a bunny pretty sure
you're not a
bunny I mean not that I'm the
one I did the hydrate for
you I should do the post
sh
you as requested by you
boom was invincible
for that's how you do it you walk
[Music]
into he walking him so you bounce up and
then land on his head
I did lose I
mean it appears that I cleared the
previous level to two masks Ander the
boss with two mask lost two mask and now
I have zero
Mask The Masks are cleared off after the
bossway it doesn't matter doesn't change
anything and you only start with two
MKS in the original version I think they
changed that in the
remake
yeah in the remake you start with zeras
but you can bring MKS with
you or something like
[Music]
that good
and
imity
oh that skun did not make
it a be too too far
there oh so
close Nostalgia to Dr shamp Spyro
boss you like that
bus you don't go back to do that
level only that well I do need
10 10
dragons and then going straight Dr
[Music]
sh St slap
SI
well Dr shamp has
a hot
[Music]
bum when fighting
[Music]
SP okay let's see if I can do
this
that was a bit
scan you can
do I'm going to have one box
missed
yep one mly box
missed great but you miss one
box yay slight disappointment but
[Music]
yay Bai shocked
face
what SL disappointments she's
celebrating too yeah but she's not happy
that I missed the
box and then I go back in 100% the
game when still not
dying that's probably asking for too
much
okay of you or you get
okay she's never fully satisfied
anyway there's
that first life lesson spin while I
gu well means dead enemies I do that
every day I mean
you can assert your dominance by te
posing and also
spinning I
guess come On Monkey come here we
go come
[Music]
monkey
[Music]
okay
go takes the shortcut but because why
not
hey something was in the
way
and
then the rest of the
level okay thing is after this one
the next one is three of them no no it
wasn't it was the same one this is a
three
yes there you
go look extra
lives
[Music]
[Music]
not sure what should have that
for
yay another
level
defeated yeah I missed a lot of
boxes that level requires red gem anyway
look extra bufer
bufer oh
no h i
was for some reason my sshit has now
been replaced with
underwear she
was p p is obviously not wear underwear
under the SSH because in that case you
would see her par stick
out just enjoying some popcorn while
watching pon pon stand there
in her secret
wardrobe a the swing C is
back okay no mistakes this
time
anyway
oh yeah you you take your opportunity to
pet to the bunny
tummy why am I going to fail on this
level every time
now okay I just want that nice and clean
run through the whole game without a
seing death is that too much to ask
for I guess it
is
and I can want to see
that the game
screen
go yeah like that that's
better
like taking
[Music]
p is shaking out of
excitement I think I could be wrong but
I think this is the only level in the
whole game that changes music when you
enter this second
area which you can't hear if you get the
triple mask
anyway I'm not sure if there's any other
level in the game that does that I mean
iide from end like a bonus or like
that or if there's any any of the other
crash games that does that there's
probably some
that I'm keep I'm
forgetting but it is a rare feature
still on updates on the swords but so
probably hasn't been sent
yet yeah
oh what have we
got
spin I don't need to spin but it was
fun no I didn't want
itang getting stuck behind the
track
no I got it
anyway yeah I'm going to ignore that
completely
useless yeah can just ignore that
one I don't want the enter bonus bonus
that's going to be whoop
that wouldn't be so
good I remember one time I was playing
something on GameCube and I didn't see
my brother Point thing a sword at the
back of my head oh this is kind of crazy
so when I went to lean back I got myself
stabbed in the head wasn't deep flly but
it's still stung for a couple of
days
well
that's
um
something
okay back to this
level
boom it shoots the box up up in the air
well what we
got rushing through
and you
that BR it in bad timing this
instead there go and then there was the
time oh my brother almost shot me with
an arrow he says the bow string slipped
and he didn't mean to lose it I went
right over my
shoulder and that's why you don't aim at
people even if the thing they're using
is
unloaded or whatever it's called
there we go no want to see
that no D it I mixing up the levels I
think should I get the gem on this one
may maybe that will give me some good
omen can Omen be
good
come between
but at least not one
changed
uh do me does your brother have no sense
for weaponry you don't find a weapon at
people if you don't intend to kill
them what
if what if there was an intent to
kill okay
that's hopefully
not I think that's one
boxes there is no box count there
yay don't trust Sol's brother with
anything with a place to cause
harm
yeah I mean you should wait I didn't I
didn't want
to anyway here's
password I didn't mean to
save I mean I could save but I no reason
to save
or N64 controllers I think he broke like
six or seven of those things hitting me
over the head with them usually because
I won in whatever game we were playing
where the part is that you kept playing
with him even though he kept on hitting
you I
mean I mean first
time yeah second time sure you wouldn't
expecting to do it again third time I
mean wor time okay
now RA welcom in raid
days welcoming
profile and Ander Raiders okay wait good
timing here we go that's what I wanted
let's see if I can do
this oh oh yeah yeah I could do
that
and yay I stepped on the go with a
triple mask that was my goal I did it
welcome
Prof Pro I think your nickname is and
the bed
Rick bed Rick bedri bed Rich wait
how why did I say
p
yo how what so you were playing fortnite
how did that go thank you for
[Music]
following thank you hey P how are you
doing it's going well I'm trying to I'm
trying to complete crash
one or not now defeat neocortex
specifically without dying a single
time
so so this is very
inappropriate we have guests
here anyway
um there we go
[Music]
now you're AF freid to use the redeems I
actually you see see he so um I hope I
hope you went well
playing playing I I watch a few people
play fortnite I never played it myself
all I know is that he a third person
shifter and your goal is to win as in
most
games that's a terrible description of
what it is but I actually don't I think
there's like envir I'm not sure if it's
like called environmental destruction
but it's like least construction
destruction there you go that's that's
the term going with here you can restore
constructions not so much the
environment unless I mean I guess it
counts as environment in video games and
I guess you can build stuff as well but
I don't think I've ever seen anyone
actually build
anything that's what I know about the
game
anyway
yeah so I hope that went
well there we go triple mask again and
also read mess I kind it was reply
sometimes I like to read them
anyway
like but to be fair I scaffed him up
just as much like time I threw
a at him and clocked him in the head I
mean was that like as part of the game
like you didn't mean to aim there
because at
least in baseball you kind of no wait
baseball bat not baseball ball I know I
see no you're not supposed to throw that
that's not part of the game I mean
unless like he threw the ball wall
towards you you tried to hit the ball
and dropped the bat and it flew at
him but I could of but for what I can
see from your comment that was it was in
an accident maybe the didn't go as well
but I've been
starting gr of SAA five
Midstream and that went pretty good
did you
play so so you played fortnite first and
then moved over to GTA I can
assume my first thought was to switch
over to GTA and then he switched back to
fortnite maybe he
did
okay can I get the gem on this
[Music]
level can I also keep
forgetting like there are levels I can
do there are very very few levels I can
do there we go that's how I do
it it's very scary though because it's
very close to
failing oh no and then I miss that box
instead
oh no gem for
me no J for
me
okay
uh you're the one in the
under okay I I know that's a that's like
comment but but but you you're the one
who made the redeem okay it's fny tummy
again
well now you got plenty of money tumy
too uh I played fortnite a couple of
times not my kind of game though I have
been thinking about playing
like now we're back at the last level of
now they actually this level I've been
playing I was been I was thinking about
playing like Call of Duty and Halo of
course single play Campaign on
stream yeah
that would be quite different from what
I usually play I can work I
think uh well I start off with Need for
Speed oh completely different which Need
for Speed switch to fortnite then GTI
then back to fortnite okay yeah that
would explain what you why your category
was set to fortnite unless you forgot to
change which
happens since it only tells what the
last or more specifically what the
current
categories so for those people who
switch over to just chatting when they
go to
their ending
[Music]
screen it will just say just chatting
when they raise
someone and actually most optimal
system
so oh right ads sorry about the
ads let
me no shiny shiny pretty sparkly Jam I
wasn't prepared
for so let
me let me just take a moment to no I
didn't want to do that what do
BU like
that hold no I still
cut but there's no way to must be
B to just check I oh no person not reply
to that I did get a reply
on playing just make me take a quickly
um
so that's
that I say just take a quick look at
something else anyway H
hey you want some some
Secrets how many people do we have here
by the way I know people say we should
look at that six people should
we is the let me let me also double
check because I mean this becomes like a
triple check is the underwear active for
30 seconds is it is is it actually doing
it because it does feel like it's
shorter I wish I could move
um this screen I guess I
can't um
can do this but that doesn't have
much does that
work works at B
guess that way I can kind of see
what yeah if I do
like
that I can have a better idea
of because I only have one screen so
playing games and showing the stream at
the same time is a bit
tricky under I mean her p p Pon is
changing her underwear during the stream
you know that would be kind of weird
anyway back to back back to the game
Sorry for the interruption there
okay but now now I can actually
see because I have
the like I have the previous screen but
it's I
jumped well that was a waste of
mask looks like it's been denied must
mean she's not wearing any Che out wait
how is the underwear you haven't
redeemed it
well I was thinking
about redeeming it while she's wearing
the swimsuit it wouldn't be
any two damage from the fire how does
that
work think damage Ming
now it isn't good
[Music]
but I think that would oh there we
go got distracted by down
way kind of kind of be distracting when
you close just
disappears wouldn't he
say yeah can't redeem something that
still in cool cool down carry yeah
exactly you just you don't use it too
often if we use it every time every 10
minutes well yeah I I feel like that was
a that would
mean if I do 3 hours
that's 18
times there we go I did not do a
good took a bunch of damage I feel like
suddenly having skin TI swimsuit instead
of dress suddenly would be more
distracting I mean that is true dress
and underwear disappearing and then
those skin tight swimsuit just shows
up all of a
sudden you are right that that would
be that would be quite quite an
interesting
feeling hard to replicate it in real
life and with it 3D model with all those
different outfits that going to be going
to be very very
interesting clothes you could switch
between some clothes and some non cloes
I
guess this one goes to the middle for
some reason I don't know
why
okay
let me
show that I can do this without oh swing
to time okay let
me get out of the oh did wait why does
it do that okay okay not exactly how I
wanted to
do
monkey
now I just want one of the outfits to be
latex monster I mean as I
said do you have the outfit uh
additional outfits for pon pon thread
where you can post any outfit you would
like to see pon pon where I will unless
it's like definitely not allowed for
switch or if it's like actually
offensive
in that case pon pon is not going to
wear
it there we go not a mistake this time
almost they made a mistake anyway
but yeah you made it that time didn't
jump on the fish yes
but almost missed the leave I feel like
it would need
to move on its what okay what are you
talking
[Music]
about I think it's the next level I've
not yet succeeded without
dying so
come
on he jump like
that okay change of
plan
thisor
no
no okay let's
see don't
move there we
go whoa
big TNT let's see massive celeb okay
this level is the Fest i' got in this
challenge no wait I completed this level
this the next level I fail
on the latex monster outfit but what is
that this level I'm managed complete
without
dying don't need the lives but
sure yayu best
boss it's an interesting
boss okay that was stupid of
me no hidden
m a bonus
token no hidden mask in
there this should be one place with a
hidden
mask okay
careful keep losing my mask this
time
it there you go maybe
it's
okay let's me
see no nothing
[Music]
there
hey it's a ltic monster that has attach
itself to you and moves oh and maybe
it's corrupting you depending on type I
see
that sounds
interesting making it
whoops G giv me support to that feels
like a lot of
work how did I do the same mistake
twice
okay
okay there we
go ceiling
game I'm not sure why that one was in in
a
box oh no this level well if I try down
know this challenge my game would be
over before completing the first
level
well with a little bit of practice you
could probably complete the first
level okay be careful here
go not
yet no no don't lag on
me then I had to wait out the
timer
now
whoa four times a charm and yes to come
s is from saier art oh oh still have too
fast hurt my back no be
careful well heat up
the I I hope you have some good fried
rice okay let's let's get rid of this
one
wa that's also way to get a
box
see
that one is easy the other one is AIT
tricky just waiting out the b just to be
on safe
side here we
go
well okay and then I wait
this want to come back just to be
safe and there we
go no that's as far as I
know I mean I guess I could have gone
for J
now temple ruins no my
clothes red what have you
done I feel
exposed okay
yeah it's off in this section for some
reason I just jump off the level every
time ah going swim to this
back yeah good thing it doesn't just
remove the clo right there we go that's
what I wanted look a personal
best I've actually progressed two
platforms three platforms I mean four
platforms
licking licking more bunny Tommy
[Music]
P you people need your own Pon
plushy to
interactiv that's an interesting way to
phrase it I pressed the jump
button what
happened Let's ignore
that that didn't lose my
master come pretending like nothing
happened I know I
died
okay that flame was on for too
long at least I guess I I can K that as
a
jine I don't know why no jump happened
hello
[Music]
po I'm still on my quest to complete
crash one without dying
but that Quest might just be too
difficult for me to
do some deep interactions
you can go as complex as you want with
the interactions ignore what I don't
know you tell me what to do
ignore see the swimsuit is fitting for
this level because starting off on a
beach and I guess pon pon was out
swimming replacing crash with p
p
I wouldn't know how to do
that especially on PlayStation one
where they didn't use skeleton
animations they
use and they are moving the they're
defining the positions of every
polygon every vertic
which is kind of
crazy wait do we get the customizable
underwear we got
L customizable
underwear
maybe maybe Pon p with
wait and maybe pom pom will wear a bit
of different underwear each stream who
knows maybe I have to take a peek what
it this every
stream new design every stream that
would be too much
more
and they finding the position of every
pon
pon but there's only one p
Pon insert s pitch about selling you a
lot of pon pon plushies then you can
Define the position of every pon pon
plusy
one pon pon plushy wearing a dress
another pon pon plushy wearing the
sports
wear another Pon pom plus wearing swing
seit and a fourth Pon pom flet just
wearing
underwear and the fifth p p flashy not
wearing
anything now you're just inviting people
to look at under no no I'm not

out stupid stupid
crash he made me lose
everything the run my boys my
clothes is it going to switch
back there we
go there 30 seconds felt like a long
time sounds like nice time I I watch
straight into
that anyway
yeah that didn't go as
[Music]
well wait I
was I
was I was supposed to quit out and but I
mean I died in the first level I
Le there we
go cuz I been three lives instead of
four
now hey don't mess up this time I am
going try to not mess up no promises
though I'll do my best as best as I
can it's not
saving one box from falling down at the
end
the goal is to have one full
round it's going to feel so great when I
when I finally managed
it
but as I get
to the further I
reach am I trying to speak
English the further along I get the more
nervous I will
get there we
[Music]
go
okay there we
go
who
taada I'm really excited for my mods to
be finished by the week before it
release yeah I do I do hope you manage
to fix up the remaining
stuff
I hope it turns out
[Music]
well The Great
Gate we
go and
uh I do still have to finish up the
Ember mod and
then I do want to make the uh ponon mod
turning ponon into an actual rabbit with
custom animations replacing SP
animations which will be a lot of work
but the goal is to make pon pon move
like a
rabbit and jump like a
rabbit and I guess using her ears to fly
I did also mention the idea
of having like secret
wings hidden Insider body that appears
when she starts playing which are
like magic she call Angel WIS or
something the voice actors did say she
wants the voice M set again for my mod
oh uh I think you mentioned for when you
make the mod for another SP game
whenever you get opportunity
to G your man touch if you would revoice
the
mod because the voice actors doing uh
ember's voice did do all lines and then
she completely did the whole every line
again that was
fun it turned out well I would
say yes it's fin for friend one wasn't
aware of it
already world will have a custom
voice every other character will still
say
Spyro but oh
well
I hope I got everything however I needed
to pay two voice actors to play Sergeant
bird and agent n from Spire
3 for for when they say
uh
Spyro I wonder if you can find like a
voice that someone who can do a really
similar voice and just
replace replace SPID with manificent
Maleficent
what
we cuz if
you
yeah but it needs to of course be
similar for it to sound
ni but the but the question is
I should I should have G for it what
what
sounds what sounds weirder them saying
Spyro or them saying Maleficent in a
different
voice here an interesting
fact h i maybe I should say the inst
right now I was concentrating
um in the Swedish tub of My Little Pony
friendship is
Magic and they went there is
a there is a
group that are referenced in many
episodes by their name and they
originally went with the English name
before making up
uh
wait before making up a new name for the
group a Swedish name so every time the
group name is said in the
show you can
hear because it's basically only one
character saying the group name every
time oops that was way too
early anyway so every time that
character says the uh group name Oops
why did I do
that the uh there's a
different person doing the voice just
for that
word
and at least when I watched in
Swedish I didn't notice it at
first but after someone pointed it out
it was very obvious
because the voice doesn't exactly
match but it's good enough that if you
if you don't
really
well so if you don't think about
it it just it still works so that
that's what I'm thinking
if someone can at least do somewhat
similar
voice hopefully
it's it could be replaced without being
noticeable and of course you you can
also do
additional sound editing to make it
sound similar such as adjusting the
pitch of The
Voice
what and you sorry about that s bird
says sir so I have to replace the word
with M ma
ma yeah I think this m that is
true
I do wonder if an AI voice could like
take every lines he says in the
game and just do a
simple
edit because it's only a single
word I would understand if you try to to
replicate the whole sentence the speed
the intonation everything would be
wrong but you will only replace a single
word
maybe maybe it doesn't speak enough
for an AI to be able to do
that wa that was
[Music]
close
[Music]
go two Gam
[Music]
and you can't press triangle on that
screen just test
it moving
on shouldn't the ants be playing very
soon on 8 minutes
okay let's go
no
mistakes
oops time no mistake start with a
mistake at least that wasn't a mistake
leading to
mind I'm starting good at these levels
and this this the benefit of this game
is that it does have more masks that it
gives
out PR three becomes very restrictive
with the number of masks it gives
out
okay no safe place to
[Music]
time
okay so you think voice AI might work H
I don't know exactly
what it
is I think I think you showed me
something about that before but
I did not exactly grasp
it
[Music]
basically you insert every line that
Sergeant bird is speaking
already and then
train it based on
that and
then have the voice generate the same
line of
text which the uh s replace with
m' and then you so it gets the stom
correct intonation and
stuff
and then replace
uh only the sir in
the line of
dialog while keeping the original audio
for the rest of the sentence
yeah I do not believe an AI would be
able to replicate the whole
sentence that that was my idea the the M
will be a bit
off but since it's a completely
different word
[Music]
spoken maybe it one has
noticeable boxes
falling they
CR
that's why I pay a voice actor to play
certain yeah I mean if if you
have if you can afford
that and they and if they I mean in that
case everything sounds consistent I mean
that that's the
best best thing to do I like
the easiest if you can afford it
yeah
yep up the
cre that is
annoying
second
Monkey
D this technically is a level I can get
every box in
but then I have to play the bonus
too now wait I could probably spin away
our
token that was a bit
scary but I did
it as are going to play
though let's play some ads I guess I can
defeat the boss in the meantime is that
okay I'll do
it and then I will be
back
[Music]
no
[Music]
why bad landing on
boxes
[Music]
go he you backing for it oh missed my
chance okay um chance
again
W okay I canot get him down here there
the
time TNT is
wrong there you
go there you go find
it I got this p
p adding ads to this
yep let's do some stretching before this
level you got this I'm trying I'm trying
but I keep failing at the level after
this this level I don't think I failed
on it so
far let me take a quick look at what's
going on
here and
[Music]
so
um
so there you go
now back to the
game you got this P I'll take
this wait wait I got this pon pon which
pon pon okay now it's the next level
after the the first level after the
boss technically I
could but that just risk that I die so I
should probably not do it I'm not going
to risk
it I'm not comfortable
enough I don't need
lives
also oh yeah I was going to say ask why
do I have a mask all right I get a mask
first thing I do in this
level oh no p is being got by a
tentacle don't touch pon
pon
I'm being very careful
now but so much for being careful that
was that was so
scary
don't exactly need that okay this time I
could do
that leaking the
tentacle wait what's
the I'm not sure about the last one
but I get I
guess but I do like the lineer of the
last one I wish I could make line out
that nice My Own Line
so
amist am aurist
I I need to get to work now okay have
fun at
work I have fun with the rest of stream
later everyone I'll I'll try my best I'm
being punished by
this
level not this level Next
Level keep he keep thinking it's this
level when it
isn't it is it it is this
level it punched
[Music]
me
oh you got to see me fail before you
left how
embarrassing H head BS I got this I just
have to restart from the
beginning
I need to stop doing stupid
mistakes that's a bummer
yeah could say
that
let's go this
way now it's now I missed much less
boxes
nine quite quite a lot still
yeah and I was supposed to and I was
supposed to be
good I was supposed to do
good do good in defeating neocortex but
sadly crash died on his way
there no wait I'm not supposed to be
done do I watching game awards no I
don't think I watched a single game
awards maybe someone else here
does I got that one
t at least
at least there's the one box I can
easily
ignore this
one
wa I'm planning on watching it since
it's it announc announced announced
crash team Rumble last year
well yeah let's let's put it on my
stream and let's watch it
together
[Music]
nah not done that before I'm not sure if
I would do
that would be an interesting thing to
try out at some point I
guess
what
we get out of my
[Music]
way I'll try out of pness if spy for is
announced
they going to be a trailer
for showing
Spyro in a completely new art style and
then this is just Spyro being
gu character in some other
type in some other type of
game and everyone is going to be
enraged is third
L got a bit greedy yeah I'm feeling like
I'm starting to mess up too
much
