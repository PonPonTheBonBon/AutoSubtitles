hey welcome

everyone here is here

and everyone who is here are still

welcome

that's hey that's again

so so much I have three minutes late

that wasn't my intention hello Papa wolf

welcome

nice to see you here

I made a very small adjustment to the

screen I have now centered The View

between the empty space like the chats

before it was along the edge of the

screen let me know if you like this or

not

so let's uh well begin

[Music]

with the starting skins

let's go from here

good afternoon

[Music]

thank you

well

[Music]

no voices no

it's just so sign I guess I'll do the

reading

oh multiple same slots fancy

that's starting already

[Music]

story mode Friday mode trading phrase no

options I think okay how's what does

cortex sound like

so it's a greedy crypto we work together

to read ourself of

[Music]

they couldn't fit that on a piece

my genetic modification to your army of

rip talks will cost those this Rift I

have rip talks

I didn't rip talks inspired too I

actually don't remember I don't remember

spicy will cause those to even more

trouble which again you didn't have to

put on a third page if you just die

yeah we'll see if these will be fun

times

sometimes seem to eat

don't forget that the first routine you

should redeem the first one you'll be

the first it will be your first first

film I think

[Music]

I said I don't know how these characters

like and how they speak in their own

games but

I really can't imagine what they sound

like anymore

and then me tried to portray their

voices

use cortex and dressing them up

as crash and spiral wait what

[Music]

they should be on the same side

I mean it is kind of awkward dialogue

I'll activate the word pads soon I'll

and we shock and carry this measly

planet

[Music]

this is nice

day are they

as crash wouldn't be able to sell if

it's spy or not because crazy obviously

knows who spider is

[Music]

yeah that's a horrible question

[Music]

something is wrong with it to jungle

again

and soon since our last I should have

played City card game in like one day

because this is the like Coco from twin

size or something but because the reason

why I go in with the crash bandico

inspired Fusion

and now it's because I'm starting off on

a new game with both of the games so I

want to play 30 crossovers at the same

time I just thought that was getting

good okay why are you doing it

something is that in the wrong going on

here not wrong

and all these strange creatures are

popping up everywhere

perfect

[Music]

this is cortex work again he needs

someone who can

please someone Brave and fearless you

can get distracted I don't know why I'm

subscribed reading this now

but all we have is Crash to help City

yeah crash is useless

cry

[Music]

wow

nice I'm afraid wait who's speaking

I assume it's speaking because he's the

one moving

because I'm afraid of course he's happy

to use all the tricks again this time

he's

recruited a new Dragon like creatures to

steal the power crystals they must be

stopped

and oh yeah because they call it ever

got better because and

[Music]

each leads to a purple Power Crystal we

can't let cardix get his hands on them

ASAP to you to save the world again

crash

[Music]

oh it's starting immediately

it's

you can jump you can spin

and dark and spin while ducking

[Music]

sleep done

hello Coco

[Music]

hey crash I've managed to build a warp

portality take you to other parts of the

world you need to collect five purple

crystals from each area in order to

power the portal to the next section

though okay good luck fresh

okay other kids spiral stockless fire

well this isn't like

such a bad effect of the flame

is that stocking out for that

immediately

[Music]

towards it I'll be fine okay

[Music]

you can't even make it

it's nicely on

after it comes with constraints in that

direction

or should I just

okay so I can't find out right there I

can't buy it because I already bought it

exactly

so I just have to repurchase until I get

every single

hunger 100 cents game

um

too expensive I need to so I'm

[Music]

um

[Music]

the best way to form the performance

it's probably something oh accidentally

fall down

I actually understand it down

[Music]

I'm lost where am I going

[Music]

this is a much bigger area than I

thought

all right

[Music]

back at Dragon Castle Dragon club

and this is Crash Bandicoot and I'm

akwako I feel or Enemy new cortex is

behind all of this

say cortex is behind this to me this

seems like the work of crypto that's

crazy look an awful lot like his

reptiles

oh no it's worse than expected it's

appears that says team buff with

himself

[Music]

your enemy crypto the two of them

working together may have enough power

to take over this world

everything they wanted us to find each

other instead of going after them even

though the fight was two seconds long

if we team up and they watch down a

chance against us

come on Chris let's go

[Music]

and then they just basically did

you like the question ones I didn't even

like frankly

before I don't know I hope they just

don't repeat too many games and and like

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Applause]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I'm not seeing a single checkpoint

throughout the game

[Music]

you hate making the same

foreign

[Music]

okay

[Music]

[Music]

but the Stars

before I get my snakes

[Music]

like this that's the exactly

but that was the one that I did I think

[Music]

you like the music

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I got it

this is

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

Roots anyway

let's be

let's let's look at the bunny

oh there it is

yeah

imagine if I didn't have anything

it's it tells the 3D models crashed into

pixels so it looks terrible

you really should have painted off this

thing actually made pixel art of these

cookies

that really shows how

Rush this kind of thing was

[Music]

um yeah I do value those bunnies quite

low I guess

they are pink they have nice long

bunnies but like

[Music]

I need I need I need a way to farm my

friends

[Music]

how long is this lemon

[Music]

there's another one but but I can't

enter them with a farming where's she

staying

I need a place where like you have a

fairly

it's gonna think

[Music]

and then you should perform the end

knock it down like that but

yes like this this is this is what I'm

looking for

let's go crash you can eat

[Music]

another problem there is a shadow it

does not show boulders

because really

[Music]

[Music]

have one job

the nursery fits in safety outfit

I'd say trust me I am a believer expert

I have a neighbor in the foreigners work

[Music]

at some point they decided that Bianca

should have a wand

I need to hold that one this is me that

was in the bouncy box it intrigued me

and there's another one

[Music]

even though she's shown

[Music]

shines

even though it's been shown multiple

times that Bianca can just do magic with

her hands without the aid or any rods

of anything and

[Music]

he gave me her dad

fire mountains

[Music]

I got another foreign

[Music]

thank you

these animations

[Music]

[Music]

you're right

[Music]

I don't

I didn't

I didn't know what they're rocking

stinky

that's actually we think cheaper things

hello shy I've seen them being around

them are stinky feet they don't look

stinky hair

[Music]

yeah that's that's your new seasoning

rocket powered

03

or not

yep there seems to be a interest of

having

an email of

[Music]

you know what

if you can encourage twitch to adding

more videos

and I'll add the things so the regular

email slots will be basically emotions

and emotions and other expressions and

fractions and then I'll do the big

emotes for yeah those things like

on-punched

bunny

[Music]

[Music]

everyone's cartoon that is placed

somewhere in California back in the

extreme sports is the most expensive

[Music]

[Music]

but maybe because we will never have

this Radical Face

[Music]

why can't I just have a mask or

something

and now we turn this to one mistake

don't be so hard on me

just uh I'm just a bunny

[Music]

is

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

but then I

went too much

not a nice place to place it

[Music]

okay

[Music]

because it's quite hot in this area so

wearing something more

exposing kiss

turn down the dress

I imagine it's quite crazy as it is

[Music]

[Music]

a promised Frederick

[Music]

all right thank you for the hydrated

Rocket Man and I should just myself

and insert

[Music]

I need to find get lost

[Music]

someone says

shooting off some orange

machine

[Music]

quite different from her

[Music]

because

[Music]

snipped

then go to this area too quickly or

something

thank you

give me the last card I need the last

card stop showing me cards you don't

have I need the evil band

you want to see the even breath which

color was it green right there it is

this one looks like the sister being

pixel art

[Music]

I think these are just

[Music]

that's something yes

[Music]

again

[Music]

[Music]

wait for the timeline

[Music]

my teeth

[Music]

could be sitting somewhere else but now

we have to sit down

[Music]

don't understand

[Music]

or something

[Music]

I didn't eat and then another one fell

from the sky

[Music]

that piece I got all the clear gems and

all the crystals

um I do like that this game does show

you how many clear gems and how many

crystals that you can actually collect

for this area so far and then

and that's a thing that it would be nice

if like crash three or something

and nice

I don't know maybe it's useless

information everything is unpacked too

I'm gonna light it nice in here

[Music]

Nina let's go Nina

sharp chat

please

like that's not even caucus coloring

keep the color straight get this out in

here

I will help black crash it hits the

professor at Coco No it's

do they say the professor

or did they see as professor

purple happy Nina wants to play I don't

remember if she's speaking with them

maybe she does

crash distracting us so I can get the

professor and Coco to safety okay

run trash Oh my God

anyway

[Music]

what am I supposed to do program I guess

this is a lot of characters

okay I'll get between sanity one day and

[Music]

um

I think she was in the first one is

called crash of the Titans yeah that

that's the first

is

[Music]

the same she might be announced me

and then you get all the problem

[Music]

thank you bye I mean is this distracting

me no I mean I guess it worked but uh

polar bear running is fastest no

foreign

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

GPS

[Music]

moment is like always their job but at

the same time I'm kind of curious if it

is

[Music]

this is these

[Music]

the most healthy boss battle

[Music]

you're quite acting you're not actively

attacking your opponent

you're just running away

[Music]

okay maybe this time

[Music]

four and eleven soon

and 11.

okay sure

[Music]

good job crash

and that's all and trans entrance and

trains a good job crash we captured

our work is ruined we were so close to

discovering their heart out

what can we do

I'm afraid it's up to YouTube well we'll

have to continue to locate the crystal

the two of them will be twice as

persistent now

[Music]

if we can learn them the two of them are

out maybe we can put a tracer on them

and follow them back to the base

then we can stop them for good press you

need to travel to Dragon castles and

locate the crystals there first fire can

you head to our home

um

why why do you have they have to switch

places

like what's the point

[Music]

you can count on us

thing is

a butterfly

goodbye

[Music]

so this is this is the

fireworks I guess you can stand by I

don't know

hey French sorry about our

misunderstanding before I thought you

were one of which were on the roof to

sign it's good to know you're working

inspired now as far as you know

[Music]

the area

[Music]

[Music]

this is the first game

and only Gail

when you have to spin a bouncing box

[Music]

do you miss

a box in total two but I mean I stopped

carrying absolutely

[Music]

well I guess that's Farm first time

money bags is expensive

because you just step away from

Instagram now I can't doesn't actually

require the brain

you're asking too much from him

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

perfect

I didn't eat

and one more time just this

[Music]

is

[Music]

anymore

[Music]

[Music]

he's bringing even more

[Music]

you're supposed to be able to jump up on

this

is

[Music]

anything more in here

[Music]

[Music]

yeah

let's go buy another one of these just

this one of these

I thought I was going to miss that one

but I didn't

oh sharp

[Music]

this is going to be too tricky

oh yeah

[Music]

it's only been 20 minutes so it's okay

foreign

[Music]

into separate body parts so I can do

some simpler animations

I don't know what animations

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

this person retracting me and stuff but

how does that work if it's an Odd Squad

there you go I can't really choose

anything

is my position is

I guess I mean if I fall down in a race

off maybe take longer

doing it across so there's that but it's

not that I get full cut shoulders if I

get over to those spikes them retracting

is it really something I've been talking

to me

well

[Music]

well as you can see I'm at least I want

it I didn't

miss this now please don't put these I

mean

exclamation point great in a very stupid

location

we want to do this right now

[Music]

maybe they aren't getting

boxes in this section they're amazing

and then I didn't have to bother about

that Lindsay remember

[Music]

yeah how much do I have 3 minutes that's

a good amount I

foreign

[Music]

nice Bandicoot

[Music]

I like the sound of the pointing

oh money bags

I'm opening my new shops everywhere so

feel free to stock up by any of them

foreign

foreign

[Music]

let's go

sorry

dark sheep

sorry

that's basically all I could see

it doesn't seem to be any

more

that's fine

hold on I guess that's it it's very

annoying

many annoying next area

[Music]

[Music]

and see what Secrets hides up

[Music]

I saw a bonus let me go bye

[Music]

I'm getting very connecting my fruits

[Music]

[Music]

I made it

again

but I'm not going to do that again

[Music]

there we go

[Music]

[Music]

all right stand up get foreign

[Music]

[Music]

boxes

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

there's so many boxes yes all of this

has been contacted why are so many boxes

I've ever got any time

[Music]

and don't ask me what to find it of his

Quality Painting shorts I have no idea

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I can't work

[Music]

[Music]

okay so now it's

Collective

eleven went out only forever

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

have they recorded the

because when you pick up a clock in this

mini game

you can hear the sound of the fruit fly

flying away which is the sound through

here

at the start of a time period in Crash

because that's when the fruit flies away

oh

[Music]

so that makes sense

in that context oh secret

but that's not the sound that plays when

you pick up our box

fresh

you got a new guy

three three dresses

crash response

[Music]

Namaste conversation

[Music]

the angle of these spikes and the angle

of the ramps are in two different

orientations

[Music]

other two

and this looks like the spikes on the

same angle as the boxes and this kind of

transition here let me up from here and

let me up

three times better go what

all right here

uh funny name

[Music]

oh so chaos oh another one of these

[Music]

all right

[Music]

this is one of these I must

[Music]

size

[Music]

happy

about this game again how many times you

can see

big and easy no problem

my face I want to destroy it

never mind

[Music]

looking for yeah you have a bit like

yes

twist the nice dragon one card

s

[Music]

when I

I guess in the foreign

[Music]

[Music]

you see

[Music]

going back

butterflies

[Music]

hot buttered lies

jump nice jump this this game does not

have what they call Coyote time

[Music]

when you step of a platform you can soon

jump like

[Music]

just after the jumping

I need to stop making mistakes

[Music]

okay yes

that is not my current goal

I'm trying to get across here

[Music]

trying to store this area

[Music]

can we come back here

all right I should do this

since I am back here anyway let's say my

progress

[Music]

times

happens

[Music]

I don't lose all my promise

[Music]

oh no

[Music]

this one makes more sense having those

Pals

[Music]

I'm moving way too far back

[Music]

[Music]

that far behind

me

this time you can say not this game okay

[Music]

okay at least this is more common crap

guys this place was fun

[Music]

it just

it's your hammock crash brush I'm honest

that is

[Music]

controls the same thing as tight as

stationary

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

I mean I did touch it

please

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

Trust

I don't know but first game has their

Applause

[Music]

I don't know actually

[Music]

another

because I post animation

yeah are you not paying attention

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

like they have a jump animation they do

and when they do all the poker stick

scene

[Music]

they should have it so during the

startup of the animation I'm going to go

into this game

[Music]

and during the startup you should be

able to turn around and take a different

location

even even if in there I mean if

tightly

partly into the jumping ones next

and square some frames into that

animations to be able to still continue

[Music]

[Music]

that's one of the struggles I had with

the game

[Music]

so the ending is really nice one like

the start of the animation the jumping

ones so sometimes when I want to do its

location

and I switched too late and it had

already started the animation

[Music]

oh come on

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I can't say that you're wrong

[Music]

speaking of frustrating

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

as quickly as she came

trust me

[Music]

[Music]

I realized

too much stuff together

[Applause]

okay

I do have that

[Music]

message like

[Music]

don't see much of a point

[Music]

come on

continue on account

[Music]

hey

I'm gonna train today

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

why are you crying

[Music]

oh come on I didn't see that one

for every day

I mean speaking

from yeah you will die from it on other

people I die so much even he would fight

for me

no vodka poisoning

[Music]

of course he needs

that's that

Night Fights aren't deadly if they just

retracted extracted what what is the

time no one told me

what's up this is retracted

so my tolerance should be high right now

my name is

it should not hurt you but during the

cancellation

trying to have those spikes that and

then while they are extending you still

hurt by touching them that's not how

physics work

[Music]

but having spikes quickly extend and

poking and I get I get that I think

that's fine

[Music]

and I think that's actually the case in

first three because it actually has

those arrows and I think they only hurt

you

extended

[Music]

oh oh come on I took damage I only took

damage from that thing

[Music]

what what what age

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

wow

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

this is my karaoke

[ __ ]

[Music]

even even if I like I wouldn't

choose to use fireworks myself

because it's it's not like it's not me

who's right I'm just I'm used to

repeating again

all right keep forgetting about that one

[Music]

finally

I completed 11.

[Music]

swearing is bad

[Music]

there it is

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

come on

[Music]

I will catch you and

[Music]

whatever

some people hide their swears behind all

the languages

thank you

[Music]

yeah like this threaded Swedish way yeah

[Music]

[Music]

all right

I think I was scared already on my way

back by the way

[Music]

uh tanks are us

[Music]

you don't shoot with the shoot button

issue

and I like it again

[Music]

[Music]

damn

this game is showing it's a tank so it

has what do you mean

they are they are toys

and then they stop operating us

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

stories

[Music]

I've only made the Toys R Us stores in

Boss

International terms

I know

[Music]

I didn't know what you're talking about

this

are you talking to someone else and

write me in this chat

is there any messages

no

all right against someone last much on

me

okay I'm freeze

maybe you should really adjusting when

it gets strikes like that

four of them I said about three of them

didn't know where it was supposed to go

Daddy I said you know about choice so uh

[Music]

you know about the Toys R Us yellow

pretty

[Music]

when I was in

England

[Music]

so I need to do something

[Music]

shower

here we go

[Music]

don't worry

[Music]

how many are there if I like six of them

or something oh mine

can I start I was smart or something but

in the game the game just had to do that

to me

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

man

it did

one but that doesn't defeat that it

doesn't change my original statement

it was shooting like six seven of them

did shoot too

I don't know

[Music]

I'm trying to

turn the wrong way let's get the tank

control center just take control

and I don't even get to find the Pikachu

I think the terms make sense if like the

camera just towards the kid

do your meal

can I guess because because

that makes sense in that way

for money

[Music]

[Music]

then

[Music]

there's so much going on at the same

time

so much at the same time

[Music]

so more than one can spawn at the same

time

I think yes all they have done is said

that each of them responds they have a

certain chance to be opaque

[Music]

[Music]

give me extra chance of getting him

[Music]

him please okay it wasn't even the end

of the game

person

[Music]

it seems their Base is located in outer

space

what a surprise oh dear I'm afraid

inspired to reach rifter and cordless by

instead of the three of you can put this

stuff to them again

look at you doing here Bobby just open

your shop here in the tech Park coming

I guess I guess I can still get cards

oh this is a proper way

[Music]

foreign

wait

[Music]

what

[Music]

I have twin oh

[Music]

why in that case

why in that case

I'll quit

[Music]

do you like the more centered view

anyway

oh there you go there's some background

music

they're very calm icon music

did you like that game

it wasn't that bad actually even though

it's a collection of mini games they

could have I mean they are already two

crash games proper like platform cash

games some Game Boy advanced so it's not

like they had to do another one then

they feel like they should have done

something about like

hey

why was it a game anyway that's the

vspeaky question

that's the year

and then it has to be a question

[Music]

hi hi or wait what is the same when it's

mirrors

I don't know what it says I can't read

that I mean I know it says hi but

I can't make sense of you you know what

we should do

it's hard in Russian

I mean I could kind of see some of the

letters uh the the third letter is kind

of a bit weirdly shaped

and his fifth board members and the

second letter is yeah but with a missing

stroke

and the first letter should be more

rounded I think for a year

so if I went by that that's your young

and then there's the closest Russian

anyway I will say so

let's just let's just read lonely I know

I read it like twice yes we lost we

she's playing Boston in in her legs

let's say

and uh you know the news

um

I got the socials Discord patreon

YouTube I will I will at some point when

I get the clothes done I mentioned

before I will post

the next and release the next flammable

mod and if you don't know what the

flowerable mods are maybe you should go

to my YouTube channel and look up

the flavorful mods

and see for yourself

it's an old video I should do a new one

oh F I don't know if I shouldn't like

reading videos

and then

it's an idea these are much better

speaking now than I want to start making

it with this I did make this kind of

before I started streaming

then I did that First Avenue as the only

one

but

that's about it

[Music]

and so

thank you everyone for being here it's

been amazing it was fun playing the game

you chatting along

and all the other fun stuff you didn't

want

the amazing

and of course

and now let's have fun

okay
