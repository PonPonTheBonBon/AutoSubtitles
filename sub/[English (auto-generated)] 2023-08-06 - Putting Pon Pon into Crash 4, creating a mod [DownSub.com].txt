[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

yeah

hey

that is really coming along

thank you what's up

yeah and if you go close

then I don't know how when it shows up

[Music]

then

as well

foreign

noise

always different

I missed

eating some fish

oh yeah and then I should bring up these

creamy picture

I can see what's showing up on the

Stream

without having the streaming window it's

not

really useful

so now you can see that

is up in that moment

so this is the blend here

also that's the showing at the moment

[Music]

so I've done

basically everything with the hand

[Music]

which can be seen in this system final

version

[Music]

that's what is left

like my field but it's this part

of the night and then it's like

that stuff too

[Music]

represent one

I guess this one

now you apply

[Music]

I see I see

[Music]

all right

feels like expensive let's see what you

mean

it looks funny

I can definitely see what you mean

[Music]

so

it is this part

it's not exactly sure what's medium it

means all right

but yeah

[Music]

but this part definitely has to be

mirrored which is the science

this thing which of course is in here

[Music]

cute and remove some

[Music]

of things

triangles maintenance squares is it one

bit

[Music]

[Music]

all right

I guess I really only need to do that

money yeah

middle part here so I can easier

it's like half of it

is

so I need to select waffle beans

huh

[Music]

crafty little rice girl thank you for

following me

foreign

[Music]

welcome welcome

here we're making

it

but

I am

as the title says putting confon

into crunch band before it's about time

it's about time I do that

yes again

thank you for stopping by

using it I really appreciate that

during the inside of the mouse at the

moment

and

I remember one one layer at a time

and I have tested this model in the game

if it does work

it's just

checking one of the endings of the

previous not the previous mod but

the pre did last a device from last week

I think I have

a short statement of it running in the

game

if you are curious

[Music]

so this is the inside of the mouse

so

[Music]

and then add some padding

[Music]

too much planning you don't have

anyway

[Music]

I'm gonna make us because you're not

going to be able to see

the mouse from

like a distance

and when you are a distance from the

character you're not going to see his

details anyway

[Music]

and that is my case

there's a lot of

pictures

handling Netflix

[Music]

[Music]

so the first thing I will do is move the

mouse because I want to

Bunch all the pictures up in one place

and I got some space

so if I enable this video and I want to

keep all body textures about this

it can be a bit tricky but I'll do my

best

so

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

place it here but

it's apparently not going to work

it does not fit

but I'm curious about it's

I rotate this

it's almost

immersion 15 and actually the mood

so what if I rotate it then

[Music]

and then move it down

let me Zoom inside getting

great why is it off by one

[Music]

it makes no sense

right it's something quite going on here

[Music]

doesn't matter much

[Music]

[Music]

and then

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

like this

oh

I have one

it's really

explains it

so I just need to take

some reference pictures of my

you might be sitting

before I move it means

[Music]

great to meet let me

[Music]

same this

so I get more accurate

[Music]

and this one thing one thing I need to

do

because when you rotate attraction like

this this one

you must take into account

oh that's the enormous

so on this thing still don't know what

that is that must be where the scene

clipped through the thing and they

backed it into the texture or something

so it's so the red is if we look at this

part Knight start

and green is like dark

red goes from left to right but this

thing is rotating now

that means that Direct

and the green is wrong way around no

problem

we apply two contests

31

of course it will show up over the

Android settings

but I've flipped the red and green

with the channel

so without it out it just flips what's

right and what this way and the other

plate filter will invert the green so

dark

dark green becomes light green and light

green can start cleaning

inverse only the union channel so now

[Music]

like dark as so the red channel is now

doing what the initial did

right here it should be American right

[Music]

I think it's your main Martin

[Music]

and we'll see about that

[Music]

so if I switch this

[Music]

and you need to exchange

[Music]

there we go

come to the CNA I can't make something

online

[Music]

streams

amplify

[Music]

multiply

[Music]

where it is this victim

[Music]

I lost it for a moment

[Music]

[Music]

so now I should multiplying zero

[Music]

let's look at this green effect

[Music]

level one is fine

[Music]

you know I think what I need to do

[Music]

is subtract

[Music]

and then we finally it should be

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

anyway so if that's all I had to think

and I didn't know that

this may start if I

take a screenshot

and then move this according to the

notes I have

it's two

and to the right buttons Json 394

[Music]

and then rotate it that way

[Music]

and then make it sure

[Music]

this one's supposed to buy one pizza no

problem

[Music]

if you don't know what pixel bits

[Music]

that means if I take a screenshot of it

now

amazing it's

it's slightly off and it doesn't show up

on the stream but

it's nice

the uh

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

shading values or whatever

[Music]

[Music]

this is a bit weird but it might be one

of the other

[Music]

yeah I can join it now after this one

[Music]

well

and this is not how it's for slick

[Music]

but that's because

I'm showing a certain affected monster

[Music]

[Music]

okay now

[Music]

everything is right now

[Music]

anyway back to uh

this

comes with this one I want a little bit

okay like

you will never see this but I mean what

if you do see this

thank you

marimia and welcome

nice to see you

so

simple for that

metal as a bit

a bit of magnificent corn in here

don't need that

the normal map

thank you

and it's normally it's a girl that came

off from yesterday

it's fine

come and go as you like

[Music]

I appreciate

I appreciate when you show up

but

I cannot

entrance let me finish

so

there must be something we need to

roughness map I saw

uh it's acting weird

animals So Soft that

[Music]

keeping some of the uneven roughness I

guess

thank you

making love to start

[Music]

this one was missing

but nothing is going to affect the

simulate

[Music]

singing on a map same roughness map

[Music]

like back to blend it up the number up

next

reference

to eat that part of the mouth anyway but

beautiful

back to normal

[Music]

and the only thing left here is the

tongue

foreign

[Music]

Style

I mean I do have a

house

being here

[Music]

okay so and I hope I hope to be

entertaining for you

and if there's anything

any questions you have I think you want

to talk about

if you feel free to write the kids I do

have Fun's tongue here and I guess it's

a bit lighter pink

Power grayish pink

[Music]

and no problem changing the color of the

time actually

it has to be active

it really shares the details I like to

pretend to these ones I make

[Music]

unless someone remembers this part or

someone watches this part in the future

it will be

like we take seven of those people

it would be amazing if someone managed

to actually see it like wow even the

tongue has a slightly different core

[Music]

thank you

anyway the

[Music]

what do you want

[Music]

I mean why is he splitting

too oh is it

um I see

[Music]

oh and now I see yes

[Music]

my commonly used email list of us

deleted on there

[Music]

it seems to have reversed it back to a

bit on older version

which makes sense they might they must

have done some overhauling

yeah at least everything is still here

[Music]

yeah I can't see that easily

don't worry about

all right

all right shade yeah

[Music]

foreign

about losing anything

[Music]

because twitch isn't going to let that

happen I mean

I know they made stupid decisions but

they're not that stupid

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

nice

whole pieces on the texture

they're probably related to the issue

from yesterday yeah it's been an ongoing

thing for a while and then like goes

back to another one and then it gets

back to being weird again

[Music]

so there must be definitely be something

there up there

I just wish they were they were a bit

more

open and clear about what they're

working

certainly it's not a secret even if they

implementing some new feature

they couldn't understand at least say

something about

hey

something

so back here and now

they don't they don't need to be clear

about the whatever you know what

they're working on something

there's something I do think they should

work on

okay two things

that I think they should do

one thing is Mama

is that

you can mark your stream as a knot

more children

and you can

[Music]

and that's about it

there's nothing on your stream that says

that it's not what you learn

and nowadays with an implemented system

they tell you that

but but again it only tells you once

anything you'll see before you watch the

stream that this stream contains a video

game that is not suitable children this

is not what I'm talking about

because for example now I'm just using

doing art and there's no content warning

for that

but I have set my stream to 18 plus but

I want people to kind of know that

without me like

I could add 18 plus to the times a

little bit most people don't

but I guess it could be more normalized

than is

it's not like a proper solution to the

issue

foreign

[Music]

twitch

I'm saying that

this is an 18 plus stream like I have

that as a

I icon on the screen itself

you're just gonna make your tongue green

or purple again there are some questions

that you have meaning but everything is

not not green I think

perfect I've seen

in a few shows

green tongues which

don't really get why

it's an interesting design

doesn't look like the tongue is metallic

I do

[Music]

now it's working for some reason

I know I didn't want to

I don't know why I didn't want it

the tongue is

Mouse is actually kind of rough

nothing I came to the original roughness

they have but

I didn't expect it must be a bit more

shiny

when I leave a page let's say 18 plus

but yeah if I click that I'll assuming

it's going to play it takes me directly

to stream nothing that that's yes

laughs

exactly

a current active life that's the thing

which kind of what yeah

a lot of you said when I was an ice

cream last

and that

yeah she told her you said that they

shouldn't like to tell her what to do

and

I should have been more I think

and then I said that like she said that

a no backseating is allowed and then I

checked the chat rules because the chat

rules you can on desktop no first time

is not on mobile which is also annoying

thing on desktop you can press this

setting the chat settings and then you

can open chat rooms which is very nice

that I have that they just need to add

it to the mobile version and then you

can read the chapter is whenever you

want which is very convenient

um

which I did and there was no reason

about back sitting

which and then she said that well now

it's on the about page so I went to the

about page and double checked in

technically it only says that you

shouldn't spoil anything it's it says

nothing about backseating

[Music]

so

but all those rules really should be in

the chat rooms as well I mean it makes

sense

and that's it not to tell another thing

about cheese you do but

um

that's amazing what the anthem

and yeah

why wasn't going

yeah yeah yeah and and I said and

basically she said that she usually

reads people's about pages and and I

kind of admit it and and that I really

actually down but that but the reason is

because I get to just dream two ways

either I open

uh

an active live stream which goes

directly to your live stream or I follow

along a raid which again goes directly

to your live stream I never see the

about Pitch

perfectly on

the browser version when the live stream

is playing it is technically it it does

have the about page below the streams

you can just

scroll down and read it

today is that but if you're on mobile

that's not an option

in that case you have to open the name

if you want to be doing it then you can

get that button it's not too hard to get

to the about page

[Music]

we're watching on my switch I get an 18

plus warning that I need to accept let's

go to my phone

well

and so in that case the the the client

can know that the stream is that made in

custom

and I'm missing now and no vaccinating

single Edition

Beauty I don't

yeah this one upstairs

hey at least it doesn't require you to

pay to use a standard phone feature like

uh minimize

10 year

drum picture and yes

but yeah and last time I was a lot of

stream versus the only supplies stream

because she hasn't been streaming she

has been busy

[Music]

absolutely no hand speech I agree in

this what is

yeah my pressure is 18 plus Gmail

I need to be respectful and that's like

it is Egypt generic stuff

now back seat no hate speech

preferably avoid political topics

because otherwise

foreign

[Music]

election or something that's really not

[Music]

it can be a political tangent and sure

call me a hypocrite is some I guess

political topics that are allowed it

would be regarding

Nike

human rights the rights of people like

the rights of who you are like mainly

LGBT rights

but yeah

don't advertisers oh I'm from exactly

it's a basic and I think it's basically

the same

oh yeah yeah she actually does have it

sorry menu that's true

please ask first before sharing tips or

like she does have that that's true but

yeah she should just basically just copy

this and put it in the

uh centers

[Music]

please Clips here please keep suggesting

lead speech time minimum I don't know

no flirting

English only please

pretty pronouns here

I had the pronouncing I haven't

implemented it in my chat

I haven't

is it

a stream is usually coming to to two

ways when it comes to language

I do they have absolutely no tolerance

for other languages that's basically

it's understandable in the sense of we

don't have a moderators who speak every

language and even if you have a moderate

who speaks a certain language we cannot

have that moderated manage

everyone speaking that single language

that's too much work to put on one

person and that person is not available

some streamers are perfectly fine with

other other languages being used

and it's it's like

it's It's one oh yeah let's watch me it

is one way or the other it is it's very

absolutely nothing it's like

don't don't write anything or you're

going to be time without a band but that

was really nice to have it set up the my

audio properly

has it been echoing a lot

sometimes the redeem time glitches out

on the phone and then I can't use them

or click on bonus points yeah that

happened on the phone doesn't happen

often for me but that happens don't

forget really from the team

yeah I mean it is a sporty outfit

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I hope it sounds less echoey

but I said I have been

wish I

I don't know how remember yes do let me

know

if something is off if the if I speak to

quiet if if the game audio is too loud

like the

and when I'm playing the Game Boy games

the audio from those games are very loud

so I had to lower it a bit extra

I didn't realize the first time around

so

those clips that were made and doesn't

sound as great as I hope because the

my voice isn't all like the game

audience is quite loud

[Music]

foreign

like the hair

there's so much of her tummy showing

[Music]

but yeah

I don't know where I was talking about

I'm talking about streamers talking

about learning

[Music]

the streamer talk about the most

[Music]

why does it stop playing

no no I want you to sign something

now it works

weird

and it's up to the end to get good

and then

the knees be up to this

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

this week including today

[Music]

oh my

friends I can't stand even certainly

and you're going to have four things

I would melt when someone said I am a

snow bunny if it makes sense

thank you

[Music]

so it makes sense

[Music]

around 600.

[Music]

it's not annoying that it doesn't really

fit between here

but I don't think it's ever been

so 10 steps up I mean someone with the

five extra

[Music]

there we go

and I can enough that it's necessary but

[Music]

without them

[Music]

13 minutes

in the middle

[Music]

so

[Music]

and then check that

[Music]

in this final memory each of these

[Music]

[Music]

end

oh yeah

I don't even know what's

and this is

[Music]

[Music]

like that

foreign

[Music]

F Dublin

[Music]

oh it's FW

system is still a strange name for a

letter it should just be called

letter W should be called y because

that's making the sound

and the letter Y should instead be

called yot

because that's making the e sound

and there you go

I just improved the alphabet okay

[Music]

no need to thank me

[Music]

[Music]

oh yeah I mean you could also call it a

wind or something like that that's

amazing

[Music]

also an old name

there we go this is the roughness

let me think I'm even

of the average yeah

area

over here

[Music]

the roughness map is going to end up

with a little bit

you can wear this everywhere

[Music]

so

thank you

because I need to make these two

and then to be right back okay

[Music]

[Music]

I assume that that's outside

because our instance

you can finish this good

nice time

let's switch it to the real

I still need to update

audience

but also in the machine because the

tongue is in the rent I was supposed to

make it I think

[Music]

how do I do that

I will need to increase

blue Channel

I have onion

so the blue Channel let me read some

from the red Channel

[Music]

and now it's magenta

okay that's not exactly the correct pink

let me yeah

emotes you know taste

there we go

here's the actual pink

[Music]

Okay so

[Music]

she

also increasingly like this yeah that's

more likely

I think that's enough really

no I think I name it

at that time

so

now I can export this should I export it

just compare

this is with coke coke or red it's

saved

but I'm not even showing what I'm doing

uh me being silly again

[Music]

okay that's Coco Ranch

and then

okay and then update

now it's back Pom-Pom pink not shady but

let's have this thing that I should I

just

[Music]

good ticket

here is what I'm working

and not showing people

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

please should be stronger

[Music]

thank you

maybe not

I mean this presidential percent

[Music]

based so

it's fine

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

I have not made this decision

[Music]

yeah so now everything in the face is um

that means I can

move on with this one

this

is faced up here

with multiple layers of missing

is

[Music]

from Bianca

[Music]

this does mean that

[Music]

going back here I should be able to open

up

NPC

Bianca

and then

[Music]

on it hang out and there's the ears too

which I will ask me

now I didn't copy it for me I get copies

on phone

now copy The Edge from here

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

first there are some

I wanted to close that one

nice that's the same size

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

I'm extra detaining when it comes to

that part

oh then we came out from the panel

Barrel what did he didn't die

[Music]

oh yeah

oh you know

bunny stuff

you're not

funny enough to understand

[Music]

[Music]

one idea ham

[Music]

and it's a silly idea

[Music]

and it's anything that is kind of

complicated to explain

[Music]

this is which is just what

waiting for my how much

I don't have any

friends

it's slightly slightly

foreign

now

Let's scan this up photoshoppers uh

some AI thing that tried to calculate

how this fit look when I'm scared but

I touched this it is an online version

this

and when you compare

one is cleanliness

yep

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

that's what she looks like

[Music]

people

unright Underside

I see the upper side

oh no yes

I can do anything like

noise basic Flats you know

I think

[Music]

I should maybe copy of the enemy

[Music]

[Music]

and

rotate

more exact

crappy and stuff

foreign

[Music]

too much

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I think that's right

and it's great

I had to tell me what

[Music]

hard to tell when it should be great

[Music]

why do I know I'm just here morning in

my swimming suit

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

so let me open

[Music]

oh

okay

one day

[Music]

thank you

there we go here is how it should be

really this one

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

looks like it's

off

in many ways

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

laughs

what am I doing wrong

no shape

[Music]

except this doesn't beat

[Music]

it it should fit it's kind of like

when you meet

oh

I mean technically

this is

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

lines set sporty and feet to stay

tummy ready to be nice

foreign

when coming in with the dancing

Diner

and dinosaur dinosaur

eat probably leftover fridge from last

night and maybe make some coffee as well

it sounds good

but I wouldn't be interested in coffee

but

thank you

I could assume it would be good for you

foreign

[Music]

trying to figure out

how to make sense of this because

I can't make sense of this

like pizza makes this electric works

fine

this part

not so much

it's always nice to see Swedish friends

on Twitch

I'm happy

to be at yourself

[Music]

yeah sounds just have to work it in

place or something

[Music]

okay where is she working on again one

[Music]

s i

okay I guess I showed it very quickly

there

it is

angle I'm replacing cocoa and bamiku

from Crash Bandicoot

and the

game it's about time

and

and then

I also placed through the

crash series of games I will be playing

soon it's about time

when I am done with this mod

let's keep playing

[Music]

I want to see how well

I guess when it works out

if it works out

[Music]

it

might

I have like um

tested that the model is working and

animating

fine in game so

that's no problem

so what's left to do is doing the

textures

[Music]

can I guess

just

and yeah so and then

some of the different outfits

Pom-Pom has at least this stream is the

well there's three different outfits and

uh and since it's about time allows you

to change outfit

I'm going to add one punch different

outfits you know to the model as well

[Music]

oh that's that after pair I've been

wondering what it was

yeah

tuft of hair

you know

we're looking bird I guess

um

yeah

[Music]

adjust the position of the even mapping

to say an optional space it's a bit

wasteful at the moment

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

and again

definitely saves on space

this is gonna have its highlighted well

I'm I'm just working out position of

everything at the moment

she's not going down like well I guess

it could be like

some outfit if someone comes up with an

interesting outfit what I'm gonna have

with like highlights in the hair that's

not from

if I like to design okay because there

will be

outfit slots

left over

[Music]

10 minutes

[Music]

[Music]

so

[Music]

Let's scan this

or I crop it down

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

I hope to music is entertaining

[Music]

I have planned on explaining me

[Music]

music library

I have I have the temps links open to do

now but I'm just not on it

[Music]

Okay so

[Music]

I don't think

[Music]

like

other games coming almost

[Music]

and she took here

yeah let's see if we did

I'm gonna see how much they need to move

then

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

like that

a bit sneak in there

I've been working on a model in blend

myself but

near Earth I mean

okay and myself but as I am

inexperienced in working with models

it's taking quite a lot

yeah

it also depends on

what uh

what

you're trying to achieve as well

how difficult senior trying to make

okay

anyway let me use sculpting anyway

really

got the hang of it then

we got into it

I'm doing mostly

shaping by hand

that makes sense

[Music]

there's a place the pink one down here

definitely above the rough Market thing

okay we have better get something to eat

after something

since the model has a lot of defined

muscles trying to scuff us directed for

each other yeah that might be

might be a bit too to use in that case

so I've got these chained out here

so these are normal Maps so they will go

to

for another mapping

then I just have to figure out what to

do with rest

now

I guess I'm just

maybe I should try to

I'm also

I

I'm most excited for working on a close

addiction with his first name

she because I think but not excited

anyway

um

yeah yeah I yes

as soon as I'm done with body and as you

can see on my

my question is obvious

and this is a regular outfit the dress

as soon as I'm done with the body I'm

going to move over to work on the

clothes that's going to be fun

foreign

and then add the other clothes on top of

that

so

I guess that's right there

oh no this is shame you do that no I

I got in contact with

someone on Inky bunny named violet

Violet Echoes the exact spelling is on

my about page in the credits

something in some

references and descriptions of what I

wanted and then that's what I got

something's not according to what I

asked for but I actually more happy with

the How It Was Made instead of what I

asked which

so

I think they made a good car in altering

some of these things I requested because

it turned out Patrick's Day like my idea

plus it also makes my character more

original things that I've just been

copies of things from other characters

honest

so if this is the normal shade how dark

is

[Music]

okay

[Music]

I don't know

I really like the shark style in the

palace

yeah yeah I like the uh I did request no

shading since changing the outfits would

be a bit tricky with chaining

and then

outlines that coloring any ideas

plus I do want to uh which wasn't the

idea at the time

because I requested the character way

before

on my mind

um it's just swim was a thing if you

think I'm not that old and

[Music]

but

I do want to make the characters

not care

animated

I know there's like the

tracking and everything not that my

computer is good enough to run that but

and also

I don't know if that's my style anyway

okay

here's the static characters online

which would be such a drastic change my

name is

but starting off with like simple

animations at least oh

thank you for the follow

so

yeah I do the

as I as I did mention that I do also

stream games I think like he says to

check my schedule to see I'm working

films to

currently going to get the crash

inspirations

I want to

play soon

I've wished to complete every spiral and

crash game 100 but that's

that's

[Music]

hello cinnamon

100 videos of course welcome welcome

I am

very happy to see you on here we did my

preview window girl

anything

how are you I'm doing fine all right

um

what is it and this is such a big fight

I'm not used to race

well um

welcome everyone I am yeah

I guess I should present represent

myself

definitely a lot of friends

so um

and well today I'm making a 3D model of

pumpkin which is my first owner which is

on screen at the moment so

to put into Crash Bandicoot 4 it's about

time

I think General thank you I think you're

so tired

I think thank you I guess that

[Music]

you're a challenge

I am

I like I like

oh I'm sorry if it's Workman

uh but uh

I cannot actually see anything like my

pizza coming or pancake

it's a

yeah I've seen

I should do this Shovel by the way

shout out to cinnamon

and it's really really nice and fun

streaming

I try to I think I try to catch off the

these things per second yeah because

it's fun to be

be there okay thank you for the

following

that's right it's fine we had to support

you in a good time

yeah I'm very new to streaming I started

in April

as that is four months already

a time flies

but but I'm and I'm not very introverted

and

and I get shy so

yeah

after this imagine

thank you thank you very follow

how do you say that

that's my attempt

and thank you so much

how much

um

I think I think I've

I really want to see

I promise I'm streaming so much myself

and if I need to find this films are

very rich

takes time for me to watch other

people's dream I do like I like the

coziness of the game

sometimes I'm I'm like lurking not

writing much I'm still there watching

listening

ended up making a spreadsheet with a

formula stick cooking stuff that sounds

like something I would do

I don't think I've done so with any

I've done I've done a spreadsheet for

the games I've played and I've actually

made at least

for a future game

I wish I'm going to play tomorrow and

but yeah but I'll probably do that with

some other stuff you know it is much

better than I did not expect I have been

streaming almost every day I don't know

how much did you dream when you started

I don't know

I feel anything experienced I think but

thank you

[Music]

I can't imagine I I wouldn't

dare touching the game

feels like a game will get stuck in

but at the same time I know

I tried saying like Animal Crossing and

some in some ways either it's addicting

but there's some in some ways I can't

really

do it every day I don't have one I don't

know if that makes sense it's addicting

but at the same time not

and then

tennis and her face about what you're

doing are you texting stuff yes I am so

let's let's do the

so far I've done the head

so I've taken Coco's model

and multiple models team put together

this whole thing

I can't say for certain

if you have seen

a crash

so you have

different

oh it's not learning

I guess I don't have the texture yeah I

don't have the texture loaded

so there's multiple different uh outfits

and like

oh yeah I changed the format of the

textures that's why I'm not learning

[Music]

and apparently they must have created

this model first

because when when they made the other

and

models

uh

and because if I take the parts from

each model that

like shows her body which I wanted the

body to put together and for the base

for uh

the different body parts

it doesn't align with you each other

I can speak

okay the body parts doesn't align with

each other so I suspect they made this

model

and then for every outfit that shows

different parts

like it and when I did the rest which

shows the legs and like that and they

recreate those body parts

and that's why they don't match up

and there's a lot of extra work too

and which also made it trickier for me

to put together the base to use for

pumpkin

but then I

I made all the the arms legs much

thicker like cocoa is very thin arms and

legs

[Music]

so I'm going to do basically a naked

model I guess you could say

which at the end will put a different

outfits because I have different outfits

for foreign

suits and the

sportswear as the different outfits

and yeah currently I'm doing the

texturing because what she shouldn't

look like this okay should be

yeah one year

like the head here which is I'm done

with the the white part first okay so

I'm working on the tough stuff and here

let's try to plan out where the normal

mapping should go and that's a lot of

technical stuff I guess

so

and I'm working trying to plan out how

to do the shading

and I would probably just copy the

shading I

part of the

well part of modding for a game is that

you

I guess you can just take the models and

textures already existing in the game

that I think that's fine

because I'm in the mode is for the game

itself it's so

yeah I'm not the greatest explaining

things or

making a presentation but I hope

I hope

some of that makes sense is this your

future and some people have suggested

that my I may might maybe should use it

as

like an animated model on screen

uh

it is only meant for this game

so

I wasn't planning on that but it's not a

bad idea

I guess the only issue is that I'm

already using existing

Arts from the game I don't have I don't

own this stuff

so I don't so I wouldn't

I guess from a legal

standpoints not be allowed to use it

I guess it would work as a base too

and with Mark as a base for a future

model I guess hey welcome back

another guests

from cinnamon who I rated not too long

ago oh yeah speaking of spreadsheets I

have

for some reason decided to see at least

every rate I done I would probably stop

doing that at some point wait

but I did write Cinema

the 2018

[Music]

I mean it was last week I guess it

wasn't too long ago because they know

how many different people I have read it

when I get the chance

I noticed I need to read well you can

still we have cinnamon

[Music]

I don't know

it's a it's a

seat that sea set battling there that

makes me think is that share sounds

[Music]

and I mean other voices would be kale

but I know I don't

I would assume it wouldn't be that but

you're the one

to decide

and we have one more

clutcher yes

and

PC sorry I missed you

supposed to greet everyone who writes a

message

[Music]

though

I see my dress with

zip

stinka

I mean yeah

it does look like a word but

it does not I can't find anything but

just searching for

that but I can look up the boulevard

yeah

Jeff yeah

[Music]

which that would what would mean

when a little girl

and then if kale means something it

could be I'm I'm resetting you gonna

leave

Carla is also polish

which is the local vocative

of a cow

which

which means

something else

[Music]

that's

ignore that

if you want to

well you're free to say what your name

stands for if you if you want to but no

pressure

I am curious

[Music]

I think it is fine

I worked up in a while here

that's the same here but a bit change

like that so

if I save this

[Music]

oh yeah I need to

this one as well I need to

[Music]

add that thing

thank you

[Music]

and here two yeah

which is a really interesting thing

uh

how is it an interesting thing

however

um

in there which is I really want to make

a video about the translation everything

the Translating localization of aspiring

Knights Trilogy because one of the

things considering cow

in Inspire 2 there is a animal that is

called called a cow Lake

it just happens so that cow and leg are

two polish words

means medicine cow means feces so

this is medicine

and that's a very unfortunate name for

the accountants

so and empathy or not calling calling

them colic

and since I would be really awkward if

they did they call them

well the Polish word for spotted

elephant that would be two words

[Music]

and there's a lot of interesting stuff

when it comes to the organizational

translation of

from interesting translations

interesting coincidence like this polish

alcoholic in Polish and also

incorrect translations or just

lack of a transmission which makes it

incorrect

[Music]

so

um

and then there's another match

something done

and find an interaction

[Music]

yeah

a language

is kind of my thing

I find that stuff interesting

foreign

[Music]

because I want this

pattern part of this so I wanted to do

something about that

I'm but for now I just want to see that

it works

so I will get to that

saving

[Music]

switching over to

blender

so now

I update this oh

that was nothing else first

time to move this to

oh yeah

now I see

37.4

and 110. and the other one is 3761

and internet that's it

no

now it might not look great because I

need to change smooth

then

[Music]

energy read your comments too

and I must admitting to the sporty

outfit which is

so there we go that's one of the redeems

that change is pom-pom's outfit so this

is with the sports bra in the skirt

which well I guess it's

about a

well the dress is showing your shoulders

and arms and legs already

no you can see her tell me as well I

don't want it uh

practical video

foreign

maybe you can

review my

Linguistics video

I wish I could just Mark a fee like this

and then yes by mark C but no it marks

every single scene and that's not

and not what I want

let me

like March themes of the outline

oh yeah that one too

I don't need to Mark the same but I

don't know

a slight bit that means to me

no yeah this is something else okay so

this is the texture

and then I have the roughness

doesn't really do much of difference

but the part that does that difference

is the normal map

there you go

I don't know it's so bad

[Music]

oh no it looks so bad

[Music]

what's going on here

[Music]

oh it wasn't

and I guess it's better now

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I don't know why

[Music]

is it that

[Music]

rent being inverted or something

not sure that I can't paint what I was

supposed to do

you know this

this will be wrong

okay

she's just

all right

yeah

now this actually looks fine

must have accidentally invited the red

chair or something

yeah International University

[Music]

okay but I explained why it was so weird

looking

[Music]

my name is Michelle that's next time

sorry about that

around it

[Music]

I keep forgetting to switch back

depending with it anyway and now that I

inverted the green and red I'm not sure

why I must have been able to read

instead of being I'm pretty sure I'm

about to the green and I should inverted

green but I don't know what happened but

it just please looks so much better

[Music]

but they're fine it kind of doesn't flow

well in here or something but

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

in there

[Music]

you think we can make

um

[Music]

twitch and emote slots more

I I would say 100 250 500 and then 2500

and simply 25

000.

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

because I want everything

[Music]

here

but unless as they say

100 bits a day is 32 days and you'll

have it

now when I said that

[Music]

anyway

tells me the amount I need okay that's

good

it's a neat feature

so that part I need to do much

produce the normal mapping up

[Music]

[Music]

I deeply please I do appreciated my name

make it convenient

[Music]

they know how much you need so

[Music]

why not just tell me

oh

thank you for modeling your Vladimir XD

2626

hi hello welcome thank you for the

uh

I assume you don't have onion

arsenia wave unless you have audio and

forgot about the badge and batch was

last time these are very useful you know

being from pretty much that

I am here but I'm unable to hear

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

jokes

[Music]

there we go

now when it fades like that

[Music]

that means that

one actually like this

the first means

[Music]

that

yeah

this hard sharp edge here might

not be small

[Music]

in the

in the game in the end anyway but

one other reason why it might show up is

because

[Music]

wait

[Music]

yeah why is it so

[Music]

that's my Nike

let's put this back down here

again and became I was bad for some

reason

that me now they're going into

the peace smoothie

and I'm back here

I have it fade into

yeah because it gets too dark here and

now it fades into the same color as the

head so so now everything Fades into

I mean sure on the head here I could

just add a darker spot for where it is

which I really should still actually to

be honest

[Music]

but now I don't know no it is there we

go now it's even better there's only

going to be something yes like

it's two different angles

I guess

yeah as I said

actually under here

should definitely be

saved it

where is that here

okay let me do this save

[Music]

and then there's a tool

that I can use

which is called texture paint

I will use red

and not a huge

uh oh wait I'm drawing

share my drawing them

too many options

you get paid

yeah I'm driving around I'm supposed to

draw on this one

and then I should have bam

lighten

there we go

Now by doing this

thank you

I outline

on both the head where it's Tufts of

hair is located

also on the

it ends

that makes sense

[Music]

it's blood

[Music]

y

[Music]

and then

you've seen green eyes

[Music]

did that make sense

there we go that means I got this part

again

and also this part

so this one I can

save

our copy

and it was with another name

say a copy I think it's the one I should

use

and then

let's say it is PNG

thing

done

and then I reload

okay now it's reverted back to the

original file so all this stuff is gone

back here

who's that

I couldn't hear I think twitch was going

very slow and everything that you said

what's this job and jumped up

[Music]

oh yeah

[Music]

that's named I didn't like me doing the

doing the drawing and screaming at the

same time that was apparently too much

[Music]

much

mathematic

it wasn't too important

I have her anyway done with me

I got the pattern done anyway so

foreign

I guess that's not what I need

[Music]

it should be fine now like that

[Music]

no let me check

[Music]

then there's quite some DeLay So I just

syllabus loves someone yeah they

yes 80 is

just

right got behind somewhat let me check

um

I don't know

how far behind is it

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

okay is it better now

I'm backing in that's good

okay foreign

Okay so

um without even

if I take tries to

[Music]

correctly I I guess it's a fourth person

in the name

certainly much better than before

[Music]

this surgery

don't mind that

[Music]

hey what's up Gucci

fix btw7

hello this

[Music]

is Fantasy on the community these things

[Music]

yeah doing some modeling work at the

moment

if that's a

[Music]

something that's interesting

but if you just hang out in this chat

is

chatting with people who have some

[Music]

friendly faces friendly names

no faces only names

[Music]

and that's

just mindfulness I guess it's

um things that they're used

computers beginning slow

foreign

from my point like

what what's happening is that

New York

and the um

well yeah some sometimes it just gets

too much for the computer you do so it's

kind of likes behind

on sending this dream

and then at that point it's just behind

and that's and and when I was doing the

drawing thing

just went behind and there's no option

to just

for me to what everyone else can is to

refresh this dream doesn't help when the

actual

ending of the stream is mine which it

was against for me

it doesn't happen often but it does

happen

and some streamers have I just never

have had issues with their internet and

like a short way at the moment

and after that the house that stream is

massively donate

again the honest way I could find is

just

restarting like I re-re and the stream

and start a new stream

I don't prefer not doing that

especially when you can do this

if you have things that are ornament to

be redeemed once

and you have to restart the stream it's

guaranteed them again

and that's not supposed to be

things

[Music]

so

I was gonna do that you were too slow

the way it is now

[Music]

so this creates a bit of a shadow

[Music]

let's see how it looks

[Music]

in here

so and I refresh this

so it's crazy this challenge which is

fine

which is what I wanted

to test the shadow over here really

makes sense

I'm not going to

[Music]

black and I click that but if you see

like

outside is like a shadow there makes

sense

[Music]

I mean

[Music]

you can like

I mean Institute

[Music]

you've got plenty of time

[Music]

I forgot I didn't even put itself

[Music]

sounds like I need protein

thank you

I have to stay connected version for the

situation

yes

rabbit

nothing but rabbit

how many rabbits

and being

overwhelmed by rabbits

I can't handle handle this much rammy

thank you

it looks like pumpkin is becoming

[Music]

in

Yan Chan

from a Dragon Ball which I don't know

that is especially considered I don't

even know how to say the name so

when

it's shadow

it's going to spend me

the singer with three eyes this is a

line This is

but then they would look like an island

what are you talking about

tiny eyes yeah these eyes are very shiny

that's not shiny they are in the gate

but this is our designers of the game is

doing running blending

how it actually appears in the game it

will be different because there's a

different lighting Indians

but there we go

[Music]

attached

one day

[Music]

so this part is done now

these things

[Music]

which are here

communicate progress taking a very good

so far reading your message to reverse

our day

[Music]

well I want them it's raining for 10

minutes

now he's playing almost three hours of

body time flights

[Music]

more almost three hours

[Music]

yeah 10 minutes

but that's all the time it says

it is another reason for a while like a

[Music]

standing refresh stream thing would be a

good thing

and because

that it will doesn't also not reset the

counter

my attention is stupid it is possible

that

because I did a quick refresh and it

might not have actually refreshed on

which side it might actually be exactly

what I'm looking for it's still it's a

little bit refreshing some things

so

[Music]

that's the same when I look at it

the fixed watches but I guess I can kill

enough

now it says 20 minutes now

I did three seconds

and all the people from there

no like half the people from and that

was here from the

it's just messes up Mr C6 and everything

from the raid like he left

either because they were inactive and

there's and the stream ended on their

side and they haven't updated yet

and where they decided to leave because

the stream is

another reason why I was seeing function

so the stream doesn't end it just

continues it's just a cut a clutch a cut

in the Stream

right in the late video beat ends and

the new on

with less delay it starts

Bridgeport

okay

so

let's make that request

the twitch

I should call this

shares

foreign

[Music]

knitting dealing

I need to

see this person is

but this folder with this project will

only contain the quality and then I will

for whenever I make the clothes I will

make a new document where I will merge

everything all of this into a single

single layer

before it's from the other body

unless

because this software is lying a bit

I could probably simplify some names

yeah but as a group student

like I don't need that

and then it softens

that I don't need anymore

so next step moving

soon

but where one in there I guess

[Music]

and then moving it up

hi um

and again get some more hydrated then

let me get some hydrate be right back

[Music]

oh

my God

you know

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

all right

foreign

that took me quite a while

dehydration has been found

and I will not hydrate and the sports

bar is being more effect

three times the length it should have

been

I guess you could have joined and

enjoyed the view of fun funds outfit in

me

during this eyes

[Music]

celebration

look at what are we celebrating

[Music]

it's nice in there

[Music]

I mean you can always do the Anarchy I

mean doesn't it

you can also do really I can agree um no

I

yeah

nothing but

but yeah I really like it's a thing too

everything what is this a rain which you

speak

we have got a red warning on the weather

that it will come a lot of rain in so

little time

like one monster three other one two

things

I drink my coffee funny

I mean

I drink my coffee white nothing it is

not coffee it is milk

[Music]

isn't it

that looks like I had to do

that's right this is what it looks like

it looks like a

what does instant body no still not

going to work

quite a deep shell up here

[Music]

with my sins thank you

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

no rain in all forecasts only 107.

temperatures

all week and they're not a cloud inside

that's nice

that's nice for you

let me

see

[Music]

that's niceremia now let's get you to

pitch

[Music]

stay on

my mean

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

I want like

each person should be allowed to do a

single like a redeem that you can redeem

once per stream per person

and it should be some kind of thing that

you That Is Random to you I've seen

like some streamers like Lolly deal and

another streamer another bunny streamer

has so you can just redeem

well Lolly has the little tweet me

carody and another streamer

Honey Boo leave

which is the name and I said so you can

redeem company each day and when but uh

and live Channel and when you redeem a

bunny it will count the number of

bunnies here redeemed

a little twitch

yes

and and then there is another streamer

when you do this redeem it will

randomize what a like

is a random Bean you get but you don't

get it it just has a random beam here's

a random message I think some other

streamers are like

a random message you get when you do the

redeem

when I heard from The Voice mentioned

under bunnies The Voice goes low and

Status nothing assume everybody's been

so

it's not what are you talking about me

okay

I think

this feels personal

foreign

but then it will also count the number

of each random scene got and then and

then I just

and I don't know what the random thing

would be just I just want some

interaction going on you know

you know

that's what I have been thinking so far

and I do want to

do something with that

and of course this isn't specifically

if the in case if someone else is

lurking you might have an idea of what a

random thing would fit in my stream

I am all ears like my ears are [ __ ] I'm

like

fifths here

yeah I mean it sounds good yes hey it's

just that

what should it be like what is the

random thing that you should get

like

run around the counter thing 101 both

we're going to be alcohol okay no vodka

yep I already know okay

yeah

like lonely obviously have sweets

the little tweet which I did suggest to

her that she would should like randomize

it my idea was just to have random

colored wrapper this is like different

colored like different tastes

what do you call it

taste

flavors that today that's what I was

going for different flavors yes you

redeem it and a different color grapher

but different flavors

yes flavors that's not how you spend of

course that's

just kidding

and but the sweet is obviously a longest

thing I should have something else

of course the ear should not be lit

or carrots can be orange yellow white

different color the carrots it's it's

still limited that's yeah it just kepts

vegetables in general

that is a bit boring at the same time

but having vegetables

could still be an interesting thing

where I would go by the botanic

definition of vegetable and being very

restrictive based on that that could

give some funny results

but uh

I should try to make ears

think so

[Music]

that would be this one's word for cats

than the audio that would be the Spanish

word for carrot

maybe that's not that way

I don't know how are you

polish is

there we go

[Music]

didn't anything

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

this is a Pom-Pom pink

[Music]

okay here we got something

quality

all I really wants

[Music]

I wonder name

I mean I'm like

I'm not really asking for a new

new routine idea or something like that

I already got the redeem it's the uh you

do the redeem

it will randomize a item that it will

tell you in the

in the chat and it will tell you how

many of that item you have

and that's it basically and it's just

some interactivity from the Jews come in

here and do the redeem and then you can

leave if you want that's perfectly fine

am I like what they want per day for one

purpose yeah but

I wouldn't be able to do like a random

fact of on the phone per person per

stream

[Music]

I can't think of any ideas right now

okay

[Music]

at least that's one way of expressing it

obviously languages

have foundations

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

it's literally I am not coming to any

ideas right now

[Music]

well if you really really want literal

is like I'm I

coming not on any ideas right yeah

basically what he said I guess

no ideas are coming up to me or

something

ah is that when I read the

other pie yeah

yeah

a problem is I'm not saying I would be

able able to

Implement anytime soon anyway because I

will need the mixed up thing which

should be able to do it

but I don't think I will be able to run

it on my computer

anyway at the moment I would I would

have to do that with a new computer that

is more powerful

oh

this computer is a little niche

and that I think mixed up is that

the main language

[Music]

are you exercising that's why you're

sweating

why are you are you looking at on in

this visit

[Music]

one is quite large on my stream

he's ready to show off how she looks

like

come help me maybe I got influenced by

I was gonna say maybe I got influenced

by as some other funny streaming he also

has a very large model on screen

but I'm pretty sure I'd peaked Snape on

Bonsai before

I even watched it did that other

stream it

okay yeah Jesus asked me to know then

international language

yeah that's true I don't really know

what the komapoor

is like coming up on an idea

and then you got it really they want

combat Hawaii that means remember

is a really old expression that for some

reason has is leaning

uh

it's kind of kind of interesting

foreign

it's a very archaic way of saying mind

so it's it's a

coming

in the mind

although it's it's a bit weird to say

that I'm coming in mind when it's

actually the scene I'm thinking of

that's coming to my mind

because

if the expression was yoga

that should be mean I remember because

it's coming to my mind but

that's the thing with languages they are

ingredients

in Polish you say

when I I don't know what to set is

Polish

mom

and I think not

that's German I know

to me I'm 30 years old however you

should do this I have certain years yeah

that's

that's the banana working out nothing to

worry of

good yes thumbs up potassium in banana

should not be my thing then you get a

random fruit

large bunny Maybe

that sounds like water bunny

yeah kiddos actually have quite a large

no no

the other streamer has a larger Bunnings

I don't know I haven't compared

you has the biggest body on screen

come to think of

um yeah I would definitely say that this

other stream has a larger

comparing the two sizes

uh oh is

there

that's my attention

okay this dream I'm referring to this is

only the obviously

obviously

comparing and comparing sizes between

stream waves

okay

you want to see mind size

um but that's an idea otherwise just

keep a random fruit it's not I don't

know the best thing I come up so far

yes

maybe I shouldn't show it on screen

[Music]

oh no nothing scream

foreign

all of her curves

very pure

[Music]

it's pure for the Merlin

oh nice actually

myself with a single point which makes

no sense that it's a good guarantee you

would do that just need

it's not guarantee for that

[Music]

uh it's not that sounded awesome

but I'm up for another character string

by the way still don't know when or how

or what

that's it I'm still so focused on the

other stuff I have to do I'm gonna be so

I will do another one but it will be on

hold

[Music]

I think one point is 116.

I don't know if I'm actually having no

wait I do have an official Heights

report but I said 180.

thank you

180.

[Music]

this is this how we do it

[Music]

casting

[Music]

okay let's see how this looks then

[Music]

moving on to

Santa

Rivers

okay

[Music]

all right all right

I love this thing

[Music]

thank you

now anyways

do the knee again

there you go

obviously this is not what I wanted

but it's a step in the right direction

[Music]

against me drinks

the blurriness

saving this again

100 each larger than larger

I'm not that fat yeah

I'm actually very tall

which uh which actually made a funny

situation where

because I do like

long GB I guess

oh no not for it if you're not falling

in the heights I mean

anything in it

[Music]

and I mean

I mean

oh anyway yeah

I show my initial years I mean

[Music]

[Music]

I hear messages and rain on some

dirty things absolutely riding at one

time maybe

so but anyway I did like a small a small

small and cute and funny

uh

[Music]

yeah

the proportions of Pokemon is still like

a bit isn't like human I mean it's human

proportion left me from a short so

Quantum wouldn't really be 180 because

that would mean

I mean the proportion is all is all

wrong for the next time with our key

proportions should be shorter

maybe closer to 140 120

and one month will be smaller regardless

of size 11. yes

[Music]

I think

yeah so it is

so that's what's going to say I think in

Final Fantasy I think

why not fantasy and where they have a

bunny race and those bunnies are tall

and I said that I do prefer small

bunnies but

um thing is I am myself a tall bunny so

I guess it makes sense

I don't know

I don't play

I don't know

I don't play

so from here it should be extra shine

shading extra Shady

[Music]

but not on that I guess that would be

yeah I should want to be on this side of

these

[Music]

going on the inside

and make sure that one

do that will be pink

I think that's actually White

and then

okay let's undo the ear

and a I think

mirror

one pun this don't you know but one upon

told us about Final Fantasy bunny bit

[Music]

who dress in a very revealing outfits

their dresses are completely open on the

sides that are fairly long enough to

reach this Vines

Irish sounds like actually playing some

bunnies in Final Fantasy I mean

[Music]

yeah I'm bisexual

foreign

[Music]

yes

I should make it maybe it says

this morning

[Music]

I mean I would

oh

like that

yeah I'm not going to seeing that anyway

so let's move out of the way

and then it should add it something here

[Music]

is your connecting things

foreign

[Music]

wait what

[Music]

all right I see

let me split them off first

and then wait

that's why it's there that one's there

okay

that's one thing that one there this one

[Music]

I know

[Music]

so I'm focused on

yeah should I practice this earthquake

this now foreign

[Music]

[Music]

and I haven't kept up any final

fantasies

[Music]

should I play Final Fantasy

[Music]

is that what you're trying to say

foreign

games

[Music]

it sounds like I have to play

I'm not giving much of a choice

nice it sounds nice

foreign

inside are you guys and I saw it sounds

like

balance uh

chat sound

foreign

[Music]

here I'm doing this weird thing

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

Archer skills and their secondary

ability

faster second ability and you can

prevent opponents removing performing

actions Etc while waiting on that test

skill to do the job

and they're the fastest range which is

important because the agility start

determines when characters are in a turn

as well as how many times they can do so

return

well sounds

very strong

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

like

hello Noah

[Music]

and let me

[Music]

know export things

if a character is fast enough it is

possible for them to act 10 times before

the first opponent moves they can

essentially warm out an entire enemy

problem before enemy can respond

that's some higher GLC

guilty

a guilty and glittery

[Music]

I've killed ones that requires getting

attracted to level 99 in a game that can

be beaten around the researchers

yeah at that point you're kinda

joining

[Music]

grinding

[Music]

and since the enemies camp out around

the 30s you'll be one shocking them

anyway

well yeah in that case

[Music]

it's for those who really really need

that extra

but I still don't manage to win

without the vegetables they should be

able to see

foreign

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

about him

well

it sounds like a good name that should

be named Karen if I was a name from one

of the name Karen

foreign

[Music]

every time

every time I have to say that I have no

idea what I've seen

then there's this thing

foreign

but I guess I'll copy whatever is inside

[Music]

cookies yeah

which is this part

good

Market

that's my marking

[Music]

there's more five seconds and it's the

same except this one is one like

jungling

which I don't think is properly

[Music]

uh I'm Gonna Keep the meat

and masks

foreign

[Music]

roughness

it will be this roughness is near

[Music]

and they seems to use a slightly

lighting why the Philippines

foreign

[Music]

I don't know maybe it makes sense

I mean the ears are shiny a lot of

bunions

right

um yeah

[Music]

so now I can

it doesn't really do much of a

difference but

I will do the uh

and I'll get to it

[Music]

I'm not sure how easy it is to see um

like the phone or something but

got them very angular name

there you go now you can see big signs

Peak

hey one game I want to play through

again is Golden Sun one of my favorite

RPGs on the Game Boy Advance

it's the graphics are amazing cooking

for advanced status and the music

stopped it's amazing how they manages to

get

such a soundtrack from a Gamepad Arts

game

and I have like an extra chip or

um

so for ES I don't think I'll do anything

with this front

but

I will add

this texture

to air but this part

[Music]

[Music]

is there any interesting curling my kids

and because I want it to be like

indented

if that makes sense

foreign

[Music]

foreign

you know I actually have an idea please

quite some Adventures

thank you

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

so I got this shape

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

and then inside this shape

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

doesn't matter what I call it

[Music]

it's going to be used to generate

a normal map

[Music]

oh

foreign

foreign

here I am working on teaching

and I'm happy you showed up

I always like to see creating a month

for the crunch exactly

crash banquet for it's about time

let's switch out the blending

I am

trying to get these ears to

um

but yeah

as a 3D model

that is what is

um

thank you the celebration amazing

amazing reaction

thank you

foreign

thank you for watching

[Music]

I've been working on this air for quite

a while now

[Music]

[Music]

I hope it will be good in the end

[Music]

I'm adding a lot of detains

one location takes however long

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you but that means a lot to me but

you love

[Music]

I have done a few mods

or spider so far

so this would be the first

multiple crash that I would publish

[Music]

but I do want to use the amount of

myself before I promise it

that makes sense

and but I will not be able to use it

sooner I think because

again things okay

I don't in this computer they won't be

able to run it like that well

[Music]

um

so

[Music]

but I am in the process of moving things

I mean the new place

thank you

I might be able to get access to a

different computer that is more powerful

there's no no guarantees on that though

but

if that's the case that would help me a

lot

[Music]

yeah I guess it's

[Music]

see

unserved his legs

surely laggy

sometimes

fine

sometimes it's stuttering um

[Music]

[Music]

what level is what I wanted

thank you

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

but it went back as a

mask it only is or Heights match

threat stretch

[Music]

and then I went

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

laughs

let's see if this is more how I want it

and put step 5 into the generator

it looks more to me what they're looking

for

I'll take the output

and

inside of here and there you go this is

a normal map output

well I can test it right away

before I started working on it

that it does what I want you to do

[Music]

many

because it's only the ears

well it did Define the edges I don't

know

and heading away

well it does Define the engines which is

what I'm looking for

foreign

[Music]

but is it

is it the right way around let me

let me just invert the red and green

[Music]

is a switch spaghetti

[Music]

it changes what's indented

indented and out

what's in and

foreign

artist

s

[Music]

inside

foreign

I like to add it

I think this is the other way around

I think I had it correct right before

Alex

it's just going to be

well

um I need to

use the bathroom

so keep me a moment

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

took me five minutes

that's minus one

[Music]

so

foreign

[Music]

feeling lost

and keep those apart

[Music]

yeah

and she probably doesn't remember myself

and then

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

but duplicate it

[Music]

and one of these

will have the red Channel go from CRT

and that's the date

[Music]

another one would be 128 to turn this

way

[Music]

and it should be

a man should be American

which I can't do immediately actually I

just forgot about it

so

this one I can just

immediately inverted

[Music]

I think the part that

[Music]

shouldn't

yeah I think I I messed up

that that this one should be emerged

from the Underwood

there it does let's

see

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

Channel

[Music]

[Music]

so this is this one I had one then

it says start

[Music]

students right simply it's like I should

do first

[Music]

subtract add

[Music]

another button

these two should be selected and

subtract

[Music]

ing at the same thing

wish

it's outside

oops

[Music]

wait now let's start this out no it is

great

I mean it's expensive

[Music]

I'm going to plan a

foreign

[Music]

between it

hopefully

it's just going to be a bit roughness to

the actions

[Music]

instant princess this is the wrong way

around

okay back here hopefully and that's the

last interruption

but if I stream for 24 hours

[Music]

I won't but

since

okay so I will invert being normal map

because

[Music]

now it should be quite loud but I'll try

and invert you know my language because

right now

[Music]

I'll see how it changes okay how does

this shape

this looks wrong

but that's definitely better before

[Music]

it was definitely better

foreign

textured that

and texture to this thing

and I guess the whole hand is done at

that point

[Music]

but yeah

foreign

[Music]

should be done at that point so let me

get on that then

I don't know she was beheaded

[Music]

The Headless

[Music]

so for this thing

it's just the same part and same same

thing again

but it really should be a much easier

for me dude

that what is the nature

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

meow and here

meow meow

which isn't that bad of a way to go I'd

actually like to find out what one sees

what their head is separate but for

obvious reasons you can only do that one

yeah

if we do that can you report back out

it's like a case that is that like

the very last thing you want to do

before you die

thank you I want to be beheaded so I can

at least experience that

before I die

what is such purposes

well that's not brought back how it goes

I'm right at

thesis

dancing with short side

on their own experience

but hello kitten I'm very happy that you

have

showed up

what is exciting action anything

[Music]

is

I'll be sure to let you know what it's

like

yeah don't send me like a Bitcoin

message

hello kitten

have you

swim

oh is it wait wait I think you know I

think I have an idea okay look at this

and this is an issue I have with this

software

and

Okay so

let me see if it works and I'll I'll

explain what I'm doing so this there's

an effect which is add it will simply

take whatever the background color is of

the

of each input pixel pixels as area

picture and then you place a picture on

top of it but you set it to add it will

check every individual pixel that means

the computer doesn't instantly and then

it instead of just because normally when

it plays a picture about another picture

just replaces every individ each pixel

but with the add mode it will take the

values of each color from the red green

and blue and add those values onto the

other on the on the pixels method

being that a brighter pixel on the image

you're placed on top

the most will add and the dark edit is

the lesson it will add

it's it's kind of like shining a light

or projector lights on something

and I got my car washed too nice I need

my car washed I should probably watch it

some after I'm done cleaning here

but you know what it's like to look into

a deep cut of your hands through which

you can see the pants and I don't know

if I wanted

already

in that week so how it is doing you

really enjoy eating lunch watching your

videos and you just got my car wash for

the cute day so that sounds like a good

thing

so that means that if I set this value

to 128

and

yeah so if I have this like

this color this is a this has

because this background is 120 127

2055

so this is 120 800 28 zero

but if I set this an ad

it will make it white

because

it just add

however if I take it to one day that is

[Music]

if I set it

t

[Music]

hmm

my demonstration isn't working that well

[Music]

[Music]

I said I need to test to see if it's

quite

[Music]

now if I set this to add

yeah

did we say as it increases in brightness

it will add more and more until there is

white but at about the halfway point is

already reached 20.5 in The Valleys the

rest is white

problem is if I lower the opacity

[Music]

because it's still doing the same it's

doing the exact same thing it goes

halfway and it reached the maximum value

and that is the wide rest of the way and

then it does the transparency

so it's already so it's this all [ __ ]

off of it it's just

pink oh anyway this is other one called

film if I know what that one is done

yeah this is what I'm looking for

because now

now it does the gradient all the way

because now it's like the layer wasn't

even the right this might begin

good that I could confirm that

[Music]

um

yeah you didn't want me to do another

character

what's fun

it was scary I was worried about what

because I did so much practice

beforehand so I kind of my voice got

tired and then like

dumb people this is kind of neat effect

in this this was

this wasn't what I was going for but

this this is kind of nice of it

thank you

so yeah so it's instead of going to feel

very close first

shooting

it's in here

[Music]

so I should start using film instead of

fasting because

it does steam a difference

not a huge difference but

I need more coins

it is more correct it's

very first relevant

thank you

so

keep keep the noise that

a velvet scissor phone emotes I don't

think

someone's sending all the love

oh I get it now someone someone liking

it

dream as you can you come no wait you

can't do that on the phone

twitch has a reaction to this system

they're ready to fix that universe

here's listen do you sing along to the

beginning there's nothing over there

it's not trying to sing along but you

you're saying some people

I forgot what I was talking about that's

the best

I think of what is

purple skin is remind me of as well as

stringing a memory for my Channel right

now they can't quite place my fingers

purple screen

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

and splits it up like this

and that would be nice

[Music]

[Music]

that means that now I can

which I think that's

something

maybe it's easy to see on the other side

because it's more

it's bright every piece you see here

[Music]

and so I said only this thing is like

ETF how um texture this is

a thing of

thing

of me

[Music]

her texture is very funny

I sure hope I'm turning

all right grab this together which is

something actually is for kids party

okay

[Music]

all right

[Music]

now

there's this one

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

and the same for green

[Music]

lights why is it

same again maybe

[Music]

this corner should be able to see

you around here

yeah I didn't

there we go

much clearer

and

calendar afternoon

that would be correct

rabbits rabbits do that

say thank you something rabbits

and air on all this together

do you have

this one should be subscribed

and these should be packed

and there's like difference but

it's just me

and then different texture

but yeah

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

but yeah I wasn't thinking about the

uh

okay let's see if this works

now it looks like some

it ain't perfect but

it's better

better

yeah there we go

this is a Pon pun

pink eyes

shiny pink eye

yellow teeth

should I make should I make the teeth

more white to me

I mean this is this is

not called I mean it's not yellow it's

like

it's like more natural natural teeth

color which makes sense

whitening that's silly

did you say that

oh yes

not too much lunch you have

haven't you told me what lunch you're

having

like we talked about

yeah it's a very cute

brown nose

eyelashes I do like how the eyelashes

kind of

tomorrow

do you feel like buying even more stuff

to make more pancakes actually

because I did prank so when I do

pancakes

it is one liter

it is one liter of milk it is 300 grams

of flour

about 250 gram egg

and a tiny bit like 50 gram

cream

and that's about one and a half kilo

of batter that makes pancakes

good

healthy teeth are really more profit

off-white color anyway that bleach white

is actually not good yeah

makes sense

[Music]

I keep my teeth natural obviously

appreciative

but no cheese the white one

this mean I can watch them and

Edge

yeah I definitely like that one it's too

it's kind of a

there's no

transition between the furry and the

black I mean there is some stuff and

[Music]

plenty black

so there's some stuff like this part is

furry this is

not very

this part is more rough than is this

much shiny so there are things

Edge there

when I get through stuff

sharp edge it should be smooth

I guess I didn't see anything Sharp

anyway

and that

foreign

[Music]

pancakes yummy

The Apprentice is good

so I can get this stuff for

[Music]

yeah that's just softer

oh yeah a documentary of the Moon

looking like a Leonard surface

fish now why

waiting considering the moon Grammys of

Japanese

yeah

the eastern part of Asia saw a rabbit in

this dark patterns of the Moon

well

you were simply enough oh wait let me

switch back

I see what you mean

you see what do you mean

so take things

and make a copy of this

laughs

[Music]

did I do this again

light background

and merge shapes into one

make white

this will be the height map

there's a sharp transition should I keep

it Sharp

I could I could soften it's just a tight

tiny tiny bit

[Music]

that's not tiny

[Music]

that's tiny

how much is it yeah

[Music]

because it slides of the transition it's

good

[Music]

and then

I'll save this at night

[Music]

oh we got a new message from an user

welcome welcome

welcome

and no way this isn't that goodbye

why are my Tunes

[Music]

where are my modded moderate it is

oh yeah I did that

[Music]

okay

I went to the wrong thing

I still haven't figured

apparently meow

[Music]

meow indeed

[Music]

oh yeah I was about the same as if I

want to be interrupted

my food is gone oh no

considering

hopefully

it went into your

into your belly

when it belongs

[Music]

[Music]

so with this new generated shape

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

step one

[Music]

try

[Music]

and next

[Music]

red

[Music]

which would be

at

[Music]

America

of course

I don't want to put to kill anywhere

else

[Music]

we should we should bake some pancakes

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

subtract

[Music]

I'm happy I like a kingdom

that's

[Music]

me talking about making pancakes all the

time

making pancakes

all right now I wish I had more

[Music]

he wants nuts

[Music]

now there's

really shows that we we see who has

a second Channel just add more emotes

which two require you could argue well

if you could have had more emot slots

that wouldn't encourage people to make a

second subscription but

um in that case how about not being so

restrictive about the tier 2 in emotes

as well by allowing me

paint

and that would be kind of the equivalent

of having two subscriptions but instead

of having to deal with your subscription

you only English one we have the first

set and the second set of course

wixels is a core again another Fox with

mustache well I didn't say anything else

although I did come with some Angie

oneself

I mean hey I did that thank you

of course there is a one character

argument here is that at least when it

comes to

Vixen pixels is that you can choose

which pack you want

but isn't like

there we go

yeah

so it is effective but go for it in

terms of emote spare money spent

with

uh

[Music]

oh I know this one this is the

the space kitten

[Music]

Indiana

[Music]

and that is a velvet violet

one of us advice right

man was buying it

VT or something like that

and the head patch that is

now

let's see if I update this now

there we go

[Music]

now there is some Edge to it yes but

that might might be a bit hard to see

but

yeah I do like that bye

[Music]

even edges there's a slight speed any

color aren't really notes in it barley

I don't know everywhere

is this crazy cat

um

thank you Kita for stopping by

[Music]

that's a really nice of you to be here

matching company

A really lovely of you

[Music]

and the Pumpkin is done

I don't think there's anything else for

me to do

so

hey

that is just rest of the body

what's next well the rest of the party

foreign

good place to start done it's a

getting a

um yeah

something something yeah

a lot of details such fingers and

everything yeah

so I want to see if I can get

this is correct

my name is done exporting it sure is my

birthday

but it's done

and be right back wait a minute I

thought he said that to your word it's

going learning any more encryptions

and now you go and have another

interaction

I'll tell you

[Music]

so switching back here

[Music]

I know I did what a liter of coffee goes

through your fast

ah yeah thank you

judge yourself

okay

the question I have is should I even

care about the rest of the textures and

wrapping and stuff

I don't

I think I need to

I think the head is like the most

most important and then beyond that

now I I as much

okay

and you have to do a bit I'll probably

do that of of streaming

it's actually same thing anything when

it comes to D

and

[Music]

then the final result of the texture

just cleaning up revealing a lot of

stuff I don't

[Music]

know simplifying a bunch

so the idea is basically I

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

plus this music is gone

and it's not ending with that song I

find interesting sounding but and then

just end up something just ends but I

wanted more of that

[Music]

I started sounding interesting at the

point

[Music]

ish knows a new song for me

[Music]

this is the arm

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

showed that

and here just a question

I'd hide that seconds

yeah this part should probably be long

[Music]

and after that shot everything except

this part

[Music]

went

[Music]

oh yeah

this is these parts are added and this

is that part and it makes sense

makes a lot of things

[Music]

shouldn't have had things since Charming

advantages I've seen here but

oh

clearly they are not the same

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

there we go

now they are attached

[Music]

um

[Music]

pensions

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

thank you again

my thoughts confusing me is this whole

part here

kind of like the next uh

foreign

will be weird it's um

foreign

culture where they have

dealing lovely

[Music]

[Music]

something like that

don't like it tasted it's more salt

oh underneath wow wow

oh no

oh no

it's better walking

yeah I understand

start with the Torso

I'm hungry again

are you hungry

okay

I'm always hungry that's a thing or not

yeah exactly

you'll always like me and my own

responsible

I did it again

she's just going here or something

yeah I should put the other one around

so they're they're there

and

I want to make

[Music]

I didn't buy the necessary ingredients

oh

well

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

laughs

everybody

they both require more space than I have

eBay and all them both I will still

require a lot of

[Music]

and then there's this

[Music]

yeah I need to figure out how to do some

things

[Music]

all right let's see

[Music]

oh

yeah

[Music]

that's why I think that was sure

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

this is

backup link

[Music]

what's trying to

[Music]

have everything like this well it

doesn't need to or something

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

this thing

[Music]

it is very importantly I guess

but but

there is no animation in the game where

someone punches cookies but because that

would be an inappropriate

[Music]

that would be inappropriate I don't know

what appropriate is

but it would be in one of those

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

there you go are you happy

[Music]

rump when you add that

would likely be a couplet

but you seem to be very Geekly at the

moment

our butt is that funny

I guess but oh that's funny

but everyone has about including you

[Music]

push away it's properly

[Music]

here for being with you right now

[Music]

yeah New York

white so

anyway

this looks

[Music]

now it's starting where it just adds

another one

because why not

why not

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

seeing here too

activity

[Music]

now

this is much more management

and I get it

more of your kids

oh no

my singing

[Music]

that's what you get for not writing

anything

oh wait do you want that

[Music]

um

well

[Music]

yeah I am

[Music]

new

[Music]

yeah this one is a bit of a mess

well don't give me an incentive to not

fight anything while in that case I'll

never anymore never ever think

[Music]

is it gonna wear shoes or is she gonna

be bad but well what do you think

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

she's going to be bad

[Music]

when she's not going to have bear pods

if

because then she's on the bed

she's making that clearance

oh

my jokes

[Music]

okay I should probably fix this one

first

[Music]

thing

between the app it's

shoots away

let's see I should be able to disable

it's like this move this aside move this

aside

[Music]

oh

and now

now I should be able to merge this team

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

I mean

yeah I don't know maybe

I wasn't singing you know I thought

foreign

s like a cat which means they use them

all the time for traction

a car does not need to claws his class

in in normal movements around the house

this information is

leaning

as a person has lived with dogs this

information is maybe dogs do not have

retractable clothes however dogs will

still use their claws and not use the

glass when they move around depending on

the traction

I guess the [ __ ] has been declocked she

just said yes

oh

because normally because because one of

the example is when

when you have hard lower

and the dog tries to run across and and

tries to use its claws to get quick and

they can't move anyway because the class

isn't given any grip on the hard floor

however they're poor their paws claw no

chlorophone yeah

do you give them grip which allows them

to move

so they just have to learn to not use

their clothes to get grip because that's

not what gives them

or is this movement correct I don't know

Maybe I'm Wrong

but

I have definitely noticed the difference

between a dog trying to use his clothes

smell around and not using his glasses

because a dog can still like

creep

oh it because that's something I've

noticed by touching a dog's paw but they

can still kind of grab with the flaws

like that

obviously not says

patience as a human hand but

[Music]

[Music]

that's just my experience and my

experience

I could be wrong

take everything as I said to you perhaps

and crafts but

over time I know sometimes

what are you gonna do about it

be sure to set timing

there's a suggested time limit meaning

that it's not the time limit

what am I gonna do about it let's see

yeah I'm waiting

for our team

[Music]

that was not going to be like

[Music]

[Music]

I mean by the wind

why does

[Music]

I don't mind this is a mess

[Music]

[Music]

Okay so

color changing Bonbon Army wait this

last one is missing one

that's fun for this

should I do one like this is the default

head

um

this is fine I guess

but I could do like a custom RGB version

where you have like

there's no good one

I can't stop that I ran out of color

changing points that wait there's a

limit on them

sorry you have used too many color

changing pom-poms

please refrain from using more

so she moved forward two steps

okay let's see if I can understand

[Music]

[Music]

ding

there's a whole

party in the Japanese but only

RGB and business

this they are using the found Bunny and

then you use RGB on that

[Music]

um

so if I did this correctly

this one is off but

[Music]

[Music]

almost

this one is flipped

[Music]

anyway

[Music]

that should be it

[Music]

I found another guy changing one point

that one doesn't flip to be color

changing though

but that one is soon

I mean that one oh yeah and now I see it

I like the blue one

[Music]

is a cheering Fountain and if you look

very carefully you can see your bunny

prints

and her outfit

for my thousand spots

[Music]

[Music]

I don't know if you can't see me

[Music]

here's the leader yeah that's that's

definitely

and the leadership see it doesn't seem

to me

you're afraid though

[Music]

like

why do you have to change color

how do you stay white like the rest of

us

Legos

thank you

we're here at 17 years

not exactly the same thing

let's move that it says why it's really

short which one is

getting too fish

and then you see it are you feeling a

bit silly at the moment

yes you're feeling silly

it's

I didn't eat it no coffee made you see

me but

what do I know I don't treat coffee

foreign

hmm

[Music]

come on

[Music]

baby baby

which is our food

be

[Music]

the only thing that game was

it here

[Music]

hey

kind of speech

and

upside down

here

it does if you get a caffeine high and

Lucky Feet already slow because I

haven't been drinking coffee or caffeine

in general lately

makes sense

that makes sense

what was this one

[Music]

I thought honestly

now I'm listening one

I don't think you always

no she said this again she's dead

the Records cut in the past

day

hmm

[Music]

yeah I don't know how to

do the neck but um

I guess for the last not here

[Music]

let's see here

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

random

if I'm I saying so

foreign

[Music]

do do

[Music]

it

[Music]

should I stop streaming at some point

[Music]

I really had someone asked me how

experiment tonight when

um I think I have seen in here

[Music]

and then do you want something to eat

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

oh now unlock the air cones

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

but

[Music]

you are not the Angels if I were to

keep measuring the things

[Music]

[Music]

song

[Music]

let me wake up looking up there my kids

but the Torso I should be able to do

okay

[Music]

if there was a film option or something

[Music]

I mean there is like

[Music]

his second Mark a scene

[Music]

[Music]

okay this one

when our place is that my first time

when I switched on some um

[Music]

and then there's paper

me

trying to feel bigger the good place

I guess not really

that is the first thing is kind of

decisive

also

ancients became spicy you're not now the

color it looks like she's wearing a song

so getting a movie

[Music]

red part

I could see that but there's nothing in

yourself

[Music]

without anything

[Music]

oh yeah can I

look at this definite size difference

when the rich Champion says

coming here

[Music]

amazing tomorrow probably it's nice

[Music]

of course

president two of them on top of each

other one for each side

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

everything definitely

however the black light

I don't know I guess I'll

I guess I had to get on the black line

and stop eating it I think it's fine

okay I'll

have them seeing it

anything doesn't even have any

it's just a single single point

okay I did have this tentative

that's where my

and then

and then the last one this one baseball

so I guess

it's part of clothing

well then

saved named

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

today

when I didn't

[Music]

so while I didn't I wasn't able to

compare everything every estimate and

when I was in something I was like to

complete the detection of the body I did

it quite far and I did put a lot of

effort into the

extreme of the head

which I'm pretty happy about

and make a good Pro yeah I'm making good

progress

yes I I would say so much

so

I am happy with what I've been able to

do so far

I continue my weekend and be finished

body yeah I feel like I should be able

to finish the picture of the body

tomorrow tomorrow the next stream

not tomorrow

and then

I will

hopefully start on a clothing

at least

[Music]

so

because the body shouldn't be as

difficult as the handle the internet

exactly and I'm also not going to copy

over a lot of the

effects from the

cocoa and because I don't feel that's

necessary on the body especially

considering body looking so different

plus a lot of the textures of a lot of

the parts of the Coco's body is from

different parts of the from different

textures from different skins make it

even more difficult and a lot of those

are not even compatible with Johnny

which I mentioned slightly

don't yeah

[Music]

I thought you'll be adding a dress yes

yes

I will have different outfits the dress

the sports wear the swimsuit

I'll also have bikini

the underwear only as an option

well I love you

so they will give you different outfits

just like how you can eat so how about

we visit Canada

who is also currently playing Halo

infinite with a Dom Dynamite

keep on

we go there so I can visit

[Music]

and

I don't know what

what else to say

I need

the social command but apparently but we

got concert because it seems to be

sleeping

no one is extending anyway so

but please follow along with it

yeah

that is counting loudly
