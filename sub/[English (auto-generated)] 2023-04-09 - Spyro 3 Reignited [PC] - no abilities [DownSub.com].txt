hello
yeah I'm still nervous doing
these things
they're only my second
we've only got one watching
welcome
so um
are we continue
oh yeah I need to make the game active
so I can control it
continue from
where I left off last time
hello
nice to see you here
you are
um
yes that is still there
so I need to
relax
so
um yes and
last time
I did to do
the
England level
in the panda level
cannot access that devil because it's
too far away
well now I fell into water
and I sadly still don't have any mods
that I can adjust they have
any point
why am I for
gett getting a little man
maybe I should continue with this level
that thing is back
at this tried it last time
hey Spyro
yeah here's a question
I forgot
it can inspiring eat things in the first
game
is that considered an ability am I
allowed to eat that one
I don't I don't remember his
is there any point in the
cabin
I can still use this ability
so
I don't have to
remember
I press the wrong button my bun is in
the way so I can do that
but the question is more
I can eat more projectiles in this level
am I allowed to do that
maybe because I
forgot
that's it
yeah I'm trying to do a quick search on
that and I cannot remember any levels
that being a singing
so maybe I should be on the safe side
and not use it
I don't remember any about anything
yeah
I probably cannot remember any of it
because he'd never do it in the game
and if I would accidentally eat it
I can just throw it away like that
just eat it
image
and hope yeah there are some that I will
not be able to hack my access to this
I
my timing there was off
and I stood too close
I'm going to die give me
and I'm also using the mods that turns
slowly into the
the design
of the ferry in the first game
which isn't silly
on the referred to the
safe area in the code
hello fellow bunny yeah and now we're
now the bunnies are here
you like my bunny picture I don't know
can I make that Gap
I need to be more careful now
oh adorable yes thank you I commissioned
an artist
now I should remember
you it was
because
yes I it was I contacted you sir
Violet Echoes on Inky bunny
or a commission
there we go that way
which one is cute
okay okay yeah I
I wish I could draw that nice okay I
don't think I can get because there
I do want her to animate
maybe speaking moving I don't know
why is responding taking so long next
time
you can charge this
bad timing
okay let's continue the level Let's
ignore that extra area
move on here
here's the end of another it's quite a
short level
I can't see anything we start the
explosion
uh extra lives during the Full House
you could use that
nice to go
oh yeah I need to activate the last one
first I forgot about that
now
yeah hiding
inside is that here
a secret area
skateboarding and I still haven't
changed the design of skateboard
Stairway to
profit without crashing
so here's a
skateboard the tutorial
even though there is another
important
level okay
late for a tutorial now
also here Spider-Man is super cute
I was
during your YouTube
please
yeah and now it makes sense
oh yeah
I hope the videos are interesting
okay
Justice in experience making videos on
YouTube
all right you nailed it now let's see if
you can do a nine hunt it's been much
faster than Inspire Aspire it must be
much faster than Humpty
three spins
am I allowed to
build ups
need
that's absolutely
I want to do the five or something
I have to admit no that was
kills what does that become
that's three times 360 Plus 180.
okay
I don't remember how many you can do
there we go wow you learned really fast
this challenge is very easy
if you
only use this first ramp
let's see how many I can
oh
no
again
one more try
me on the skateboard
there we go
and the uh
I don't remember how many points hunted
again
it's been a two-minute Challenge and
it's
almost
like what's the backwards I did last
time yeah yeah awesome
I landed before I crashed so I got
friends
when I got after ten thousand
and he still left on this
year and a half thousand
I don't remember you being able to do
this in the original
the
up those points
they usually cut the points in half but
those silver Styles number cut
was reduced to 500.
oh
no anything again
yeah I don't think I need more points
three thousand
and I guess I should pick up some
how am I supposedly
yeah all these gems lying around here
there's
there's placing all these jumps all over
the place
although if I go with the rule that I'm
technically not allowed to
eat and spit items because that's not
something but I couldn't do any Regional
oh that's a trick
I should technically not use the
skateboard either
okay one more try I should
wrong sides
the
I mean
too far
I think I can flame it I should try that
I actually got it this time
another question
after that platform in the middle
you'll be able to get this
oh
that was strange what did I crash
now can I no this is way too far
what should I go to ten thousand I
wasn't
it wasn't like I got a 13 000 before
and therefore it beat the course record
see here are some of these
these the points you get for those
tricks are to
it's not worth doing basically
did I get everything on this now
no no it still does does
I don't know how to get
not a lot of things
okay maybe if I
let's take it onto the towers
and you were supposed to
all right there we go
yeah I'm not going to yet but maybe
maybe I can jump back from here
no
might be able to do that with a hover
but
yeah I think you're supposed to use
hover to get up to today
I wasn't
me to take the paper with me
so I cannot reach those gems
and then there's
another area over here
I can't uh yeah wait there's there's uh
yeah I cannot activate this one
see camera colliding in the violin
wow
where are you
that that was the route
let me just a piece for little bunny
um
might actually be able to get there can
I reach that platform from the
from up here
okay what happened there
supposed to stay on this one I can't
reach this one
that
should have a
wrapped out from
yeah from here I cannot reach it but if
I go
yeah
and I reach it from here support us try
yeah
pretty easy
you can reach quite a lot of places
without using Hardware system
very important ability that's kinda
I guess that's kind of what I'm testing
cannot search this area
I need stop Flying it's not nice
I cannot fly like you
get down from there
in YouTube
Now Let's ignore that one
being mean
just building me
this one
with my pet wolf Mr pet wolf
you fell down here
but the wolf looks pretty healthy it
didn't get hurt by falling down that's
cute
wait a minute I'm not allowed to pick
that one up
that was rude
but I'm not allowed to pick it up
therefore
I cannot do this level because it
requires me to pick it up
oh well yeah
sorry your wolf is stuck down there I
cannot do anything about it
yeah items
but I can switch
step inside I'll jump
you are you calling a child
okay I can't control this penguin
I think he's a penguin
I'm not throwing about that
which
isn't limited by spiders abilities and
in this game please please thank you
pick up that phone
okay I have no idea where you're storing
things
maybe don't hold me in on these things
you cannot actually destroy
then I can also access this area which I
recommend reach
it might be able to read it with a
really good chance
I'm playing
the challenge of not using spiers new
abilities but playing a spring or not
now it's gonna get this thing
if it's the purposes
I guess that should be another round to
not use
but if you have ideas for different
challenges I should try
I'm interested in
I have the idea the idea of trying to
complete the games without you seeing
I uh for one run to not use Flame
and the other round do not use charge
and see how much
maybe you did
that can do everything else except those
two things or I mean one of the two
things depending on which run it is
as you know those are the
fundamentals of spiral
is that have you express Express
so this is seven
for the skeleton
one more link here
nice one
okay
these shoes thank you
yeah I assumed I was going to be
teleported
I have seen
I can actually skip it right
so
I assume I'm just missing a few chance
then last time I think
I said that I oh yeah the the gems I'm
missing in these and I don't have
anything to destroy this
is he cannot do
wow
that was
quite the rocket
yeah actually an exit bottom
oh yeah you can
but I'm
not going to be able to
that it would be something to play as
him
your health I guess that's a challenge
too play us Sergeant Birds
in every level
that was pretty easy because he kind of
life really
announce another ability would be
the passive ability of gliding on eyes
there is no ice Inspire one
if you cannot slide on Ice Inspire one
Yeah clean out this area but um
reading if spider one could work on eyes
as if it were regular ground that's
probably make it too easy
not that ice is much of a challenge
anyway
he's really great at that thing
I was supposed to meet Doug to go ice
fishing I've been trying to clear the
way with this cannon
yeah you're not good that's clearing
away with this cannon
ah
I mean I'm not so good either I guess
close
I'm not
I'm not going to hit that oh there you
go
I hate this as well
oh
the path is cleared
I think there was nothing else hiding
here
so let's move on
and also let me know about the
game volume
since I don't hear how it Compares how
it's How loud it is compared to my voice
was the first game that actually
contained eyes but in that game you
could not stop on ice
inspired three he learned to stop on ice
apparently
so I guess
I
it's trying to reduce the number of
probabilities buyer has I should not
stop on Ice I guess
oh
I cannot blame that enemy
so
can that see that I cannot
I guess I'll just try it like this
no it cannot
unless I wasn't supposed to stop but it
really felt like that wasn't I
more like
that's yeah the eyes was rough enough to
be considered
this regular ground
it's hard to
pass it in the reflection on these eyes
is a picture
foreign
doesn't work like this
do maybe it's I'm not running game game
at highest Graphics at least this
computer won't be able to handle that
maybe the eyes will appear more correct
with
higher graphic settings would of course
require
ments
let's see that thing
no
no it was
yeah ice disappeared lately
look at that am I supposed to shoot the
fat part from here
but
no I I wanted to step off it thank you
can I access this room oh yeah
and as it is
at the bottom of this frozen lake
and of course I cannot access this
yeah I need to get you that thing
through another way
so you should be able to yeah
hello I'm fine
my orb is gone
my arm is back
and it's
uh
without the eyes
if that one doesn't seem to be
what's the word house
yeah I don't remember what word I was
going to use it
aggressive
lovers are good
and
up here we'll have
a nice character
oh yeah Full House yes
uh what are you going to do
okay let's
store all these things otherwise
we are going to have to destroy me
I am clearly
not good
I'm
and then two at least it's not a large
amount of things to shoot but they are
quite far away
requiring
I thought that was going to hit it
if I find the correct
and also I cannot see the depth
what are they colliding with
that's
something like that maybe yeah
and that thing I'm not going to be able
to land on
I forgot this one I said
there we go
hey
you're not doing your job
see this green thing here
I see it it's not
it's not camouflaged against Grass this
time
spark your hair take 500 I guess
now
I went to this portal
we got this polar bear
I wanted to look at your bow
hockey players are ruining it
the time I start my routine they come in
and smack me with their sticks oh I sure
wish I had a partner someone courageous
strong handsome and purple will you
please help me you're looking for
someone purple I'm probably the wrong
one for you
but I'll try anyway
I'll show you that you don't need to be
purple
okay apparently you need to be perfect
um
I failed immediately
life's going
go
next one
huh
I'm sorry
keep an eye on her
hmm
now there's one more there's one on
there no stop
don't hurt someone with a large pink bow
it goes for both of us
must protect these
[Applause]
performance ever well I think I did most
of it
well I thank you for that egg
let's see what he has to say
night's performance well I think you're
a bit too late now the performance is
over
well
pinched where you were aiming
and then down here
we got another
area
in fact there's a lot of secret lines
and this one requires running
and then there's the second one
why didn't I get any super charge
or did I miss that
whoa
and then there is a fuse
I felt like I wasn't getting super
charge that time
um
it was a mistake
so you should be uh breakfast
not so suspicious Ice One
and that's the check
and then
somewhere here
that's not here
uh you must be here oh there it is
quite Artemis I guess
when I went to the correct place
ment thing I hope
okay
or access the areas here
foreign
flying into those
yeah
right oh there we go
I'm just gonna say I was aiming too high
yeah
around
I have it
and there's the chat
so now this is on the
so why the camera is spending so much
there's the
price
that would be a place they should put a
holler
these are things
picking up the gems and then I will
access design
now I
missed an egg
is there an egg from the eyes or
something
and I cannot pick up all the gems
because of those gems but
that's him
I mean
my dog oh yeah that's the egg I'm
missing
I haven't reached the girl yet
oh I ran into his sneeze oh disgusting
there we go that's all the egg
Okay so
on to a
well that's all the levels I can play
well I didn't like the apply level apply
level on the first row
I guess I skipped the flight level on
this world too
the flight levels aren't that fun
inspiriously
I do like them Inspire one
especially the first flight level that's
the best one
oh that's how you come from camera
effect
um
so because I cannot access this level
and I cannot find any way to access this
level
I will
because the only way is to climb and
that's not allowed
so what I will do is just complete the
level without
collecting anything in the level
just like the water level of the
previous World why is there always one
level getting in the way
that's an interesting thing up too
these pariahs are terrible
wait
I lost the health
now on to the code
I think that was some valid IQ
a weird one but
now now let's see the girl should be
here but this one
is it new
now what are you doing
you stupid
thing
is
I'm not in the correct place
he forced me to pick up
oh no yes
well that was annoying hmm
wait a moment
nasty smart
it's worth a try
um now it did not work
uh
stamina have to basically
give me one more mods if I go to save
slots instead
that's that part because it would we
would be good to know if this works
because now I'm picking the same
I don't
I don't think maybe it does save after
every gem that you pick up
yeah it's it seems to do that and that's
quite annoying
but a bit lost
yeah I should be your sponsor here
then
that
and then you first
uh
only level
I'm I'm still not sure why that
wait only
oh yeah because I quit the game
therefore those were already added to
the totem
so so if an enemy destroys a container
you are given the gem
that's interesting
let's see how this goes
onto in the lake
I do like it better in there
one how
do you when you unlock the next next
World you only have one option to go to
the next one
because that menu has confused it still
confused me because when you reach the
closer to the end of the game
you get quite the long list
my technical instincts told me the
Sorceress would attack
I think
here it is
I
didn't mean to
do that
it's aim a bit more cap there we go now
it's going to throw this yep there we go
thank you
oh power up
oh that wasn't oh
I got squeezed
and it can only take damage once oh
paragraph
now eat Flame
eat bunny Flame
after project time
it's not that projectile
you eat
even though it looks like
what is the bus
it's an it's a power up you gain the
ability to shoot a projectile
what's this next bus required
now the next bus also of our wraps
or not
technically eating anything
if I'm going to keep that rule
did I eat anything in the first world I
don't think so I don't think there's
anything to eat in that world
and if if there was anything I don't
think I was required to eat it students
complete anything
oh no the bunny's back
he seems to me bunny
no I won't listen to you
speak me too much
so this world is
yeah I was going I was asking is there
any levels I cannot access in this world
if I cannot access a single level in
this world
um yeah this
this is a problem
like most levels are in the water
there is the climbing section there but
I cannot
fine
so there is an area around the corner
here
one
two
and then I can't see pictures again I'm
back
so
and
um
stuck here
and I mean I will die from this
I cannot risk
picking anything up so that's restart
level
okay
let's be more careful this time
but I want to I should be able to at
least pick up
two or three eggs so I don't remember
how many
and when you load a city back up you get
full health
you know the corner one
two
sometimes cat and I jump in water
and then first one and then back down
below
to another three and three I have
nothing left second
I can't land in the water three times
the first time another water is camera
wait I cannot pick up anymore
wait how much yeah that's the area
but these are your car is climbing so
yeah this is as far as I can get in this
level
and Beyond this
this is all
uh I wanted to remove one more
now
I did
I died in the homework
all right I can't okay one more try
oh wait wait
okay now I'm apparently
so no no more Sparks
and also yeah the second problem is I
need more eggs to be able I got 49. that
that's the 58 is what I require so I
need nine eggs
hmm
so I did is four levels I should be able
to do
which forces me to collect those eggs
and so let's start here I do like this
level but I cannot play it
it's a shame
more like I I think I like the music in
this level actually
welcome to Frozen altar Spyro on behalf
of the ice fairies I want to Grant you a
special
and this fairy is also changed oh enough
Choice she's stuck around before she
disappeared
what a short level
and now it became my children
well and then there is
one
thousand gems
just lying around on the ground is it no
no no no
oh yeah I was supposed to watch that one
because it's pumpkin
this is going to be tricky can I
complete this level without picking up
gem I mean I've already failed that
challenge because of that other level
a big plan
but I don't have any price
hey bro
got this
can't really jump over it
so and there you have him
then you need to talk to him
but then he he
Ard
snowballs at you
oh yeah you're forced to pick up these
yeah
these bags you get the checks this thing
is with this
I would say specifically
disband level and the
traditional level
and the uh
this this band level of the Sheila
kangaroo level
and then
finally agent mine
monkey level is
scientific texture technical terms
but um others levels feels like tutorial
levels
and that's the whole level and there is
no other
that and you can do that if you want
there are no other full levels with
these characters
so
you're like there aren't really
utilizing
the potential of
making action levels for these
characters
so that you have these smaller areas in
other levels you can play the mass
like they ask them on those levels
that's that's just small
segments
it's quantition that's a lot of gems
you're forced to pick up
maybe you can skip over that first five
I couldn't really jump over but it's in
the middle of the past and it's
he doesn't jump that great
no let's continue
last level
and this level is interesting
I've played it
but now so yeah I think I need to
actually do the flight levels
to to get more jump more eggs
but maybe I should just do the easy
Parts on those
so let's
avoid picking up gems accidentally I do
I'm doing this without
any extra help
[Music]
because I need to pair of this area
but well I don't need to clear out that
area
more do you need
I don't think I need to clear out
anything else
is there a gender why yeah
well it's good to see you again
she should walk all the way over here
and then jump up here yep
let's talk
let's talk about
it and then
put those enemies are all doing that
Jim will skip all the way to the end
and Pom-Pom is already there
and that's that
it is an interesting level because you
have to
do certain things
or the level to progress
most levels you only have to access the
and the last part of the level
that's some interesting
and now I place this cutscene which
means
I cannot
kick up on that kitchen
I'm not trying to pick up the gems
you need careful around here's another
level
you need to guide him
it tells me to be careful that you just
I could see him invisible on this thing
that means I have to basically know him
before I step this
step this off that's that's how English
right
I do have to be careful
then I go here
I mean what I'm not sure why he's
waiting I mean I guess he's waitable if
you show me the way but
yeah
that's being careful
I guess that became a bit greedy
right where's my checkpoints
and this is a quicker way of doing it
okay
let's use this one
foreign
oh
I think someone did a challenge with
trying not to pick up any gems
it is
I'm not sure how he's supposed to
regrets in the game
we heard
of butter dying that's not good I need
to be careful now
there you go that's the end of the left
kinda easy with the invincibility
activate
look at her face
it's a black bunny now
some
I mean I can also do this
now this is a free camera
inside
we appreciate all the details
by the way
and then it's for some reason places the
actual
that's
a nice bunny yeah
nice magma bunny
very hot to touch
now it plays next cutscene
and then next level is that one and I
don't have enough gems I need five more
but no problem I
have two flight levels I can do
which I was supposed to do
what did I do
that I don't remember what so long I
guess
foreign
flight level though
let's go and do the playback
have a look I missed the gym
so
let's see
blue
green okay
I'm able to see that
match your room Speedway
to rename the level to mushroom circuit
or
European release
it's not necessary
hello
orbit so this is two
now here's a hint
follow
these things yeah this is why I don't
like this
levels just look at this
at first you do the circles
then you do these
dandelion looking things
which she flame but apparently they
don't burn up they just explode
and after that you do the spiders
okay
and after the spiders
they arrive at the butterflies
and that's it
I'm not sure why retry is difficult
and then raise the butterflies which I
just burned up
[Music]
you're really good at those levels I've
had
lent dear friend is through my
I am playing
Maybe
I mean I guess
it's uh
good introduction to flight level I
guess
but
I feel the problem with
the uh flight levels Inspire is that it
feels like every level inspires things
like this
and the
and then these races aren't
a few exciting
it's an interesting idea but I don't
feel like it's been executed well
and also this
other flies for some reason
I fly faster
how am I supposed to beat the
butterflies if they're faster than me
I'm really bad at the lifestyles yeah
that I you
don't
end up suffering up to YouTube
yeah if you want yeah
I mean how much have you played quite
limits
it's more like
more like in general in games
push flying inspires
not the same as flying in other games
but if you haven't done
lying levels
at all in any game
at
could just be
I'm trying to
and the weight here
in uh
but yeah I
I guess there are similarities
I really don't play levels in other
games but I will try
like
it's about also like games about flying
could it be
because a lot of people have expressed
that they don't like how
the flight controls are inverted
it is meant to reflect the flight stick
in the real
the real airplane
so you pull it back to fly up and You
Pull It Forward about it to fly down and
that's the same in Spyro
and do you think they should have the
option to change that so they could
oh
Building forward makes you fly up that's
not how an airplane works
but you should still have the option to
do that
if you prefer it that way
I mean if license
yeah I
airplane spiral but here's an airplane
there
Inspire doesn't really need an airplane
no let's take a look at this now
you get these rings and after the Rings
you down on the ground and use this soup
Shard and in this game the ground acts
as a supercharge in an
oh yeah if you do that you will frame
then you take these
house protesting and wearing
oh yeah and then I was supposed to pick
that airplane I guess
trying to
the powder flying
I had the flying suit from a circle like
this okay
yeah I didn't help that I missed one of
the
and of course taking the airplanes in
Reverse or it would be better
okay let's do it for real this time
it's one two three
come on
okay and Let's ignore that that happens
and then I have to pick the airplanes in
reverse order
I guess kinda supposed to do that
Cupquake
there you go
and check marks because
I found the collective cells
where's the butterflies now the the
biplanes because B planes the body
planes right
let me know
oh yeah there it is
forget about the Stars
I don't know if this works going all the
way up there to pick up
nice try to pick up the star
here near this one here
oh yeah there's what's
coming a bit
we'll see if I can
I'll win this
going this really hot
this time I already kept that one
and that one
and now in second place
hopefully it can hit wait where did it
go
oh yeah all right
doesn't
track it that well
I am slowly catching up now it must be
close enough to hit
I'm not cheating anything
rockets in the race which does make
these race much easier than the
first race
I will pick this part so you have it
how do you
because this count is actually a pizza
Planet pick the
Blue Star
celebration Rockets
first place
viewing
hooray I need some kind of Celebration
yeah confetti cheering
well thank you
appreciating my win I guess
I don't know
so I need was it 58 of there was 58
right yeah I needed five more eggs I
need just one more egg
you're really good at the race thank you
thank you I
it
yeah I guess
it got went quite well
I'm bad at comfort
there's one more egg here I can now pick
up
because I have now
now I don't need to speak it
because I have the
this level
tap inside I'll jump
and
calling me old and calling me a show
but
yeah I need to talk to you and activate
this mode
and then these came back
right
became
I actually didn't touch me because I
don't have any
Mr House
which is Maybe
that's something
about me pick up these gems
or oh wait you don't make damage from
the parts
it's such
I thought he did
well in that case although I might drop
actually drop the heads if I get
super it's the first touch
it's me if I get hit by the birds that
was what I wanted to say
so I should still be careful
it would be a shame to drop these heads
in the lava
well that was close
oh yeah there's this
there's a secret egg here
I actually got the eggs now but
I better pick up one more egg
just in case
and a few more gems I was scared to have
hmm
yeah I must not have been in here
because there are jumps oops
if you want me to do that
obviously but
careful
there we go I'll head start back
I don't want to be a member of your Club
I don't know what it's about
could be something weird
I don't think there are any more gems
and this slug isn't back so I cannot get
more health
so I think that's all I needed
it
no I missed seven gems but let's ignore
that
I should be able to access that level
now
to just skip the whole level anyway but
to get to the next one
let's see
now there it is charm root this is also
fun level but
the fun levels being
inaccessible
the second level where you get
Dr ferry in the beginning not sure why
she had to fly out all the way over
there before she disappeared
so to complete this level all you do is
right into this if it's above wall
um
any time now there we go now I'm over it
then I can land here
and I'm forced to pick up that gem
but this unlocks the exit
and I get a Sakura
with Edge from this level
yeah
and that's
one treasure found more like one
pressure forced autonomy
foreign
and because all the levels are
no actually this one level that is not
Automotive
and because almost all levels around the
water
you don't meet the person outside the
portal to tell you to
move on to the next
to go to the Rockets
look at this list
it's always the last option so it sees
like that but
it's a long list
it's a lot of treasure 1743
I don't think it is a lot of treasure at
this point in the game I've skipped a
lot of it
and I'm also skipping cutscenes
if I'm going to replay this game
multiple times it's going to
be a lot to wasted time on cutscenes
and dialogue let's keep the dialogue as
well
so
nice
yeah let's pick up some health
and here's the power up
and then
more Health thank you
then I'll just
continue shooting
this past something
it dies basically
but
all right
he's not waiting
[Applause]
all right I walked into that one thank
you
[Applause]
uh
Stood Still at me too much today got
surrounded by
oh
just
one more hit um
yeah I can probably waste everybody
a lot of it
let me shoot at least
and the poof he disappeared in
something
[Music]
land in the acid I think it would be and
then he
disappeared
entering midnight Mountain world
yes this world should have levels I can
actually play
I don't have to skip so many levels
and Skip cutting and we have people like
coming in and leaving
so there was another person for a bit
no welcome to stay
again
no thank you give me your magical powers
that would help me stop the sorcerer
I'm not going to be able to do this jump
it's
platforms are have the same height
meaning I would need the cover pretty
sure
I'm here we go here's the first level
picking up some more gems
it's on Islands
they are wet
that I just made my hair nice and clean
and now you're ruin it with your spit
first a polar bear sneezes on me and
then
this
one is a bit cute
let's kill it
if I don't I don't care
yeah I'm here to rescue your people or
help you out or something else
let's skip to Thailand
there's I guess another inconsistent
spiral
I guess not because I mean
they are crystal so it kinda implies
that you cannot blame them
and they are small so which implies that
you can charge them but you cannot
so yeah they're not metal they're
Crystal but crystals aren't really known
for being flammable I think
wrong
but
I would like to see a magic trick show
me
whoa three stars or diamonds of ruby
sword I'll take those
how much are those words if if a small
of those are worse one those huge so
especially these
it's one of the huge one must be worth a
thousand or something
must be able to do this jump
money money
my name is
okay you have to show me your magic
trick again please
oh yeah I do Audrey please help me
[Music]
more Magic
same magic but
let's we'll get to see more magic tricks
they aren't
I mean it is quite amazing to create
such large rubies
this one looks like there are diamonds
in this there are diamonds in this
closely look
yeah look at this I want to pick this
one up
all right if you
do that it's it gets
weird about the dialogue I forgot about
that no more camera trickery
back to where it was
because the third game is acting a bit
weird when you do that
yeah it kind of looks like
um I can actually knock them too
because they are similar to one Studio's
in the first spider which you can knock
down the gems from we should have done
it with these
oh it fell into the water
these Crystal Christian looks quite
heavy so
or want to dance
but I think they would sink
yeah let me show your magic trick
[Music]
ly
and then
I like running backs is back
hello money bags
yeah
you are a magician
you make my money disappear and then you
make something to happen
I've seen your magic many times
and I'm not a fan of it
it's swapping sure is getting in the way
but maybe I can attack that's
oh no I fell in the water
and the the gem fell into the water too
so I guess it's not worth killing them
wait I've already seen this trick
I think someone else is already knowing
your trick
so
yeah
it's not a new trick I'm sorry
there's
a chest that requires a key so there
must be a key somewhere
have this
thank you
I like to pick up eggs
no
here's
the boss okay aside from health and it's
a slide
oh yeah I forgot your message you said
that's a good magic trick
there they do have good magic tricks
I wish I could use them
oh it's going pretty fast now
try it
attempting this without Sparks
is an interesting challenge
would be
quite challenging to actually try to
pick up the gems because you have to run
into them
and Louise
or Alloys no
silly
so
let's go through the view too here annoy
me
when you reach the end their magic stays
I don't actually know how that works
it's this last character that kind of
makes the
gems not
okay
when he disappears their magic
comes infinite
anyway
welcome I must esteemed Dragon I'm not a
dragon funny
I'm a funny
okay first we move this one
I'll wait a minute
let's let's ignore this by the way
because I have technically not unlocked
Bentley that was the thing
twice
there's a power up that's fine to use
because I had to skip that levels I
couldn't use it
so I should not play Badlands
ready to go
try to take a shortcut there
well
no my flight power is about to end
where did it go
I've tried
okay let's try to follow the path it
actually went on and see if I can find
it on the way
maybe it stopped
I mean it was a airplane it wasn't
really
what other it is
nice I ran straight into the crystals
it's not really a helicopter or
something that you can use
[ __ ] in the middle of the air
I guess you
no
I tried to come up with a reason I don't
think that's how it works with airplanes
although I'm not an expert
could be wrong
oh I tried to trick me there
you go that thing
now with this
fly power up
I can access places
I wouldn't be able to like this thank
you
Grace
think well what are you doing
why are you jumping up
now I need to go back all the way
so I do think there is a shorter at
start but
I remembered it's too late
because there were Treasures up there
Oh I thought that was going to miss the
whole platform
back in
and now
oh look at this
no only one another boring
nice
I'm not gonna see the fireworks
that's a lot of treasure
what's this all on this platform
just to be like that
look at this strange program
anyway
invisible walls
I don't sink
it must be one more secret platform
somewhere
because I need the key
there's that platform now I can apply I
at this time
oh there it is
here
and there's the when I use the camera
Let's ignore that and so that's that
platform that means that there is there
it is I found it
that made last
Origins one one likes channels
nice shiny gems worth a lot
now time to fly to the kill
that's as far as I can complete on the
level
but I hope I didn't use an ability I was
in the love views
so
enjoying these
screen
now we are messing up my fur again
look
the exit
oh no
70 eggs that's a lot of eggs
but I should be able to gather quite a
lot of eggs here
my thing
my next
67
yeah getting to 70 should be quite easy
probably have to do
and also I haven't realized this
backdrop
because when the portal is active you
can't see
now I could do
this
monkey action figure or whatever it says
space monkey action figure once I was
here oh I have
yep honey likes to help others
[Music]
say you ever see a bear dance
uh no
well it's yours
and there's a lot
grandma left
I heard all about how you've been
fighting a sorceress and her armies and
kicking all that button I just wanted to
say
we should go stay but my homeworld's
been overrun by a rhinox since I've been
captured if you happen to see the
Sorceress tell her I'll be giving her
dance and listen real soon you know what
I mean you bet
later
I can't cut spiers on you for some
reason I
wait
50 gems that's not a lot of treasures
what was that did you see a rhinoc
qued let's cut thing
now
I do prefer
all right
control acting up again
do you prefer with inverted camera
but obviously not in this mode
two cents again I think
like it moves a bit too quick
when it starts moving it moves too quick
you can't move it
yeah
and also you cannot move at the same
time
and the lipsticks is inverted from the
right stick for some reason
yeah the the controls are better
compared to I thought it was on
Playstation but
it's still
I still have issues
what a strange creature
vast number of rhinox are waiting okay
they're shooting Red's panic button
where do they come out of there's just a
wall in there
you've been straight
again this room
there we go
this room is also just uh
you didn't miss anything I don't think
so
indicators show that a bunch of rock
okay let's use sniper mode
that's it
somehow
come on
now shut his ear
all the way over here
at least clear them out
what is my reward
no level feels like a tutorial
it's like this should be a real
agent line level at some point but there
isn't this is this is the level
oh yeah Maritime spots
I smoked with zooming
do they attack you from behind it sounds
like it
okay
because in some games they choose to not
attack if you don't look at them
well nice
which of course means they can can I
always keep the camera away so they
don't get attacked
when I've said one such game would be
Crash Bandicoot 3.
warped
in the flying level there
the enemy airplanes
will not attack you if they aren't in
view
now I'm shooting everywhere
and so if you keep turning the camera
because they have to keep making sure
they are in the view so they can then
start attacking you
and when they are in the view they have
to get into position before they can
attack you
get away from me
well another one
they are everywhere
one is
are you still in the one
where's the last one
I hear it oh there it is
and if it's and that guess
lamp is cleared and I also took your
gems if that's okay
it doesn't seem to care
oh these have armor on them
I cannot shoot them
yeah I need to use this
bomb
if she can pick up
oh wait perhaps I used it you hold it
then you release the button this route
oh they are well they are very bouncy
let's see I cannot throw bombs from this
one
does that work
I have to
yeah like that in front of them so it
continues about in mats
um
yeah that works too
good to know
I mean on The Last Enemy they probably
hasn't had to use it anymore
um
oh how much was in that one
I mean it that it does make more sense
that these contain more than just one
but
it's a bit weird to just put a single
gem in a single basket
now
does it explode on impact yeah it is
nice
quite annoying
I want to see how loud
is wrong
oh
quite far
those two alone is 50 gems that's a lot
I think I might be able to collect all
the gems on this level
I mean
it's not like he can unlock more
abilities so
I guess this is another time to use this
sniper mode
oh this is this supposed to be a laser
this does not look like the speed of
light
all right
pretty sure a laser is light and
therefore should be in instant
I didn't aim for that one but
yeah this is
yes
I should shoot somewhere
slow speed of light
imagine if
if the light actually was this low in
the game
someone should make a mod for that
come on
come back
let me
there you go
into that lineup
laser
because
if the
if the light is this slow right part
then he turns around and drives
the thing
irony
that means that things that are far away
would take extra time so if some if
something happens in the distance
jumping
because this game does not have a speed
of light because in our
due to the size of these levels the
light is basically instant
considering how long it takes for this
laser to reach that thing
in this thing can someone count
I don't have a [ __ ]
please please stop
I mean it takes
it takes like a second so
that means that everything it does in
the distance will be a second
behind when we actually get to see it
so that means that
as you go
there's there's nothing in there oh yeah
you can look out for that stuff
so oh this is first unlocked
so as you approach it
you will see
it as
it will appear that it's speeding up
because you you are walking into
a newer and newer lights
if that makes sense as an explanation
and as you're walking away from it you
will see it it can slow down
because you are walking away from the
light
it's it's it's basically the Doppler
effect which you can hear about with
sound it sounds high pitch when you when
you order sing I'm moving closer to each
other and it would sound darker
when you're moving away from each other
yeah
and the same would happen with
light
and the same thing does happen with
light it's just that lights lie so fast
that
we don't see we don't really
see it
oh that's funny too close
yeah good thing you don't need to be
accurate I can hit the vase and the
balloon next because
I
I'm starting here
I must have missed something
on the other side
oh wait can I destroy this
I can but they don't seem to complain
anything
let's press this button
from me you sure have large buttons
it doesn't seem to have poor vision say
maybe he needs touch buttons to be able
to see them
yeah where where did it thanks thank you
oh wait ah there it is
yeah that's seven seven gems that's
quite a lot
let's move on to the girl
let's bring these bombs with me
should be able to throw it
let's do this through the portal I've
said and what it is true
I wanted it to go through the bottlene
I wanted it to go into the portal not to
pass through it like the Portland in the
next thing
obviously that wouldn't happen but
let's turn these on again because that's
how I prefer playing games
it might hit someone on the other side
yeah like this scene
now it's that
homeworks are kind of empty
let's continue
this desert ruins
you need to drink
so this level takes place in a desert
no surprise there
this is a quite highly value gems
just don't protect me I'm a nice bunny
I don't like I've never seen that's what
being in real life so
and this water
kind of water is this
it looks kind of as City acidic I think
that English
wow
I
find your scorpion
John is a bit amazing
oh I need yeah I need the key to Captain
James
look these are metal I can't find these
uh no white stop stop stop don't jump up
and I can't proceed
okay can I get there some other way
no I don't think so
I don't think you came from a few years
they usually don't have that detailed
collection
that is a mod I've been wanting to make
it just takes a lot of effort to make
the pollution accurate so
not really something I
I'm going to do here yeah
yeah and that's maybe fix this thing is
that that's kind of necessarily for them
to have yeah I cannot perceive the lava
that means that I simply have to skip to
the end
I just need to make sure that I don't
pick your virgin gems on the way
and here should be the trigger
hello Tara
see
um
um
ruins Raider there we go that was the
time I was going for
okay Torah maybe maybe it's more like
Torah if it's like no no this was
it was it supposed to be Laura Laura I
don't remember
maybe it was Laura actually maybe that's
why this
I don't remember
so let's say it's Lara
so that's
I forgot my joke
that's the haunted tomb
should be desert tomb and the haunted
sir ruins Source I don't know
a terror traft the ruins Raider
now let's continue
yeah this level allows me to eat stuff
but I am going to avoid it
and no eating
Miss but this will be
no way to destroy those things
yeah and then I cannot now
apparently drowned in that water
famous
a bit inconsistent
that that spider it's
it is inconsistent
as far as I can tell
this is perfectly normal water so why
can't you not swim it
foreign
it is
perfectly normal water
it is out of bounds therefore obviously
you cannot
oh yeah even though they are almost
wearing any metal armor
can't
you can still not flame them
and they are about as large as the
results there are even larger than
Christians but you can charge the dogs
you cannot charge the
distance
wow that's that's not nice
I don't I guess there are enemies that
are not supposed to be nice
nice oh yes thank you I need some health
and I'm about to
all right tell me something in my
face I'm come on
in my oh yeah this is going to be hard
how am I supposed to get 30s without any
help
yeah that's me
now there's no house
oh
no I got some
Revel hits some gravel hit me
this The Rock was already gone how did I
take damage from it
wait no checkpoints do I really have to
start all the way over
I mean at least I picked up the gems
they remembered that so
I can just run past anything
I love it
that was felt like it wasn't in that
location last time
yeah but it was probably enough
now
I suggested yeah exactly
yeah
things do that without taking damage I
don't know how I'm supposed to do it
I'm not sure if I ever got since you're
that that second language
that's
yeah after that
which is sixth session whoa Powers guys
hey where am I
oh yeah I should press
and then I need to rush all the way to
this door
I know more rocks they are everywhere
can someone please turn off the rocks
just need a chance please let me go
no don't eat it that's against the rules
yeah I don't think there is
any more gems there
another Chapman didn't pick up oh a
secret
oh yeah this is the uh
vehicle
sorry I can't turn off the rocks
you have to
round if one dragon
how long would it take for 100 dragons
to lay 100 eggs
well
I would assume it takes 12 years very
impressive yeah thank you thank you
the button is broken ah I understand
yeah
that's
it happens sometimes
well two of them taken care of
oh thank you
MJ or is it me
Championship round already
oh
I mean these don't put up much of a
challenge so
can I hit that one from here
very pretty bunny yeah
biggest greatest
now a dead bunny
you may now and my
ethics
you said that last time
no not that bad is back to life
has this
magical ability to
reignite
should change that to you
laughing up or something else
if I can shoot you from here you can
shoot me
let's see if I approach
and then you can hit
wow
Do You Think You Are
taken care of
I do find it interesting this area has
two of these
red but that area only has one enemy TJ
RTF okay all right was there any gems
here
I don't remember I mean I can ask spots
now there's no gems
but there is
okay maybe I should
approach it
no
let's exit is back
and proceed
already getting attacked as soon as I
fix it
he doesn't throw at me as long as the
camera isn't facing but now it shows
yeah exactly
so if you walk through the level
backwards you should be able to
not get attacked I guess
to do the riddle okay let's see follow
you wherever you go but the more of me
you take the more you leave
you don't take Shadow because you can't
take time
I guess time is warm that's good a giant
lizards
okay
oh yeah this is some flag uh
I mean six shooting
or whatever you call them it should be
one
yeah I first need to destroy
respond
and now I can take care of all these
things
all right I thought they were supposed
to spawn snakes
already caught neither not cobras
thanks
but he's still also following the camera
rule it's going to have a different
camera they don't attack you from behind
they're very honorable
attacking you from behind
oh yeah
wait can I shoot
because fire cannot blame those
so we have two more one more
there it is
this the final area
think so it's quite large but yeah it is
I
didn't
or anything
ah I find everything
apart didn't go
oh yeah it's because it's
done I see
and then uh
but I have to start from the beginning
okay
because I do need it
okay I have to start from the beginning
okay
I do need to be more careful in that
case
foreign
more
quite right
and it doesn't count down as soon as you
shoot them it counts down when they
disappear
yes they do spawn snakes
okay
I guess not when they are only
and that's what
thin and shape
ah look at that
oh there it is it's chasing me that's
why I can't find it
okay so now I'm back at this stage and
now
foreign
let's get rid of
things first
oh that's
go well
three more
one two and that's the last one
oh them at the same time
so that they are complete
I cannot climb so I cannot access that
area
without hinges lock or lid yet within my
walls a golden treasure is hid what am I
is the inside of a dragon and golden
like a chicken egg have you heard that
one before you might have heard that one
before
someone to solve that riddle really and
you came
and answer this
I I can't wait it's stuck but there's a
timer so they will disappear which is
good it must be quite annoying if they
didn't tell the timer you can still
choose X level from the menu so that's
not a problem
13 39.
so
that is
one two three four left so the last one
is the
dinosaur level
and it requires 80 and I got 75
it's going to be
and I cannot use that I can't get an egg
from that fly level
I think
I think I cannot go further
I think I'm stuck here
could do this Sparks levels
yeah I can place I'm not yet into that
egg
no I cannot just get that egg guide and
this requires hundreds and it's
definitely not 10 eggs if that's level
that will not be able to
get to the boss
the reason I can actually reach
Evie I mean every
something something
so
yeah I cannot do that because I don't
have
I cannot
do the surgery if you mean speaker
because I cannot get through the first
part of it
is it the only level that has a climbing
section that requires progress
myself on 11 that requires climating and
Alex is the level
I cannot do this next line because I
don't have I cannot climb up to it the
question mark
it must be that area I couldn't fly to
because my garage hovering
[Music]
I can't rescue the last wolf unless I'm
allowed to eat
cannot access that level
light the Heat and yeah
no I cannot do that but I could do no I
cannot do dependent level because I
don't have access
this is
cannot access that level
foreign
two more eggs that's 38.
and I need 85. yeah I don't think I can
continue I think I think that these ends
here
oh it's on 80. uh but that's
I guess I can do this
do those two and then somehow get two
eggs from somewhere
baby
it's one of these mushrooms
oh yeah it must be that one
a huge mushroom
here we go
perfect
and look how cheap
lotion
oh yeah all right
I hope you can swim
he doesn't even react to Lucy
guard the volume of this
thing okay where did that come from
if spiderless is a challenge is Hunter
sure loves to talk about that but when
Hunter lose is a challenge
here and that's uh not talking about
okay I'm
the okay they shoot out from behind
and I oh yeah and and they cannot run
into me that's also a thing I cannot do
oh I can also shoot okay
so I need to approach them from
that must since there's no cooldown I'm
shooting
I'll shoot all the time
and I shouldn't approach him from behind
after they didn't see
they don't seem to be limited to
shooting from behind apparently
they seem to be able to shoot
okay for some reason
this challenge
yeah wait them
that looks difficult it's um
let's say
um
easy to mess up
since you only have one one hit in
Europe
that's definitely tight like
doing the no sparks challenge basically
oh my God yeah I didn't follow it into
the tunnel that would be bad
now I'm just playing around
do you think everything
yeah they can shoot from the side too
I guess not from the front
so a single one left
in a minute
now let's see there's last one
and that was last one
Peter
it was uh you did it yeah
[Music]
celebration
and that's the gems I got from
the Homeworld not the flying level
in a chair
I need I mean a picture of Pom-Pom
celebrating
challenge should be easier
I hope
celebration ah
okay
let's see if I can find Hunter this time
think
he is in this big blue building
I'm just guessing I know
just look at this I was wrong
no here it is I
I was correct spiral
wrap on your
wait how much is it oh yeah that's how
you did
you take house
products
of our circuits there's no counter for
many cows there are
good like estimate
and
this doesn't look like cows
they don't sound like cancer either
I guess Hunter isn't that great that the
animals
I finally
he's not going to acknowledge that he
missed that
a cow and a saucer that does not look
like a cow
maybe he mentions uh sheeps and saucers
as well
I didn't really
but he said
that only the cow should look out
yes
and also these
they they can't stand there
someone shows up with a gun
nice again of course
and then just points at them obviously
you wouldn't do anything yeah
racing having a gunpoint without you but
more like they don't even seem to
acknowledge that they have something
point seven
and it's more like what they're trying
to say
the aiming is a bit
lost
do you try to move the stick it's just a
slightly to move it slightly with it
that's not possible
I don't think it was good out there
okay whatever you say hunter
yeah
that challenge was a bit easier
I looked fun maybe maybe you should try
it
it's um
yeah the aiming could have been better
but I guess you could get a bit more
used to it
and it's it's not terrible
yeah underwater I cannot access
guys I need somehow
to
a terrible grammar I need to get the two
more eggs somehow there we go
yeah let me almost this this one level
is unaccessible
are there really no more eggs I can
access here just there's three more eggs
what's this oh yeah
yeah I don't know what's what more I
can't do bottom of Lake I cannot access
and the and that it requires head brush
I cannot access
yeah I don't think
I don't think there's anything else I
can do
okay the only thing I can think of is
trying to reach this egg and hope for
and it really really try to get it
even if I managed to I will be able to
play the last level but I will not be
able to access the bus so
I think we can
be quite sure that the complete inspires
three without the abilities
it's impossible yeah I'm not I'm not
going to get that thing yeah
yeah it's uh I think this is the end of
the Run
so
what's up
quite the uh
if if you don't have anything yeah
it was a fun run yeah
I I cannot come up with any idea to do
get two more eggs so
I guess that's uh
the end of this I will take
it was a fun run I really liked it yeah
it was was quite interesting
seeing how much I could
achieve
make sure I could play one of those
levels I haven't played properly like I
keep
let's see how many of these eggs I
actually carry
yeah I don't think I can get that one
it is
one uh
I saw saw something there I don't think
yeah that doesn't do much because I need
eggs but
wait a minute there are two eggs I can
get I'm a bit silly now
look yeah I have uh there's a whole
level I haven't played yet on the first
level so the run will
include the dinosaur level
hooray
yeah
because I haven't even done this box
levels
or
yes they're on Sparky's levels in this
case that's the meaning
or
now let's see say yes so I'm waiting
you found an egg yeah
hey that's not good I like I like to
pick up this ink foreign
okay
but the first level is kind of like a
takura level
not part of strafing okay
no it's not not charging strangely
I think it's kind of useful
oh yeah
here we go
I guess the name of the orbis
genius
it's kind of a random name
good thing I remember what this shoot
button is and because I am playing
the orb basically have to pick up the
gems myself
the gems are large so
how do you start
the game if you cannot kind of weird
and then okay
no I think that was
only takes half damage
but I do think
okay I got the red key and here's the
red door
[Music]
green tea
switch it out and use it more
put a cream door
and what's this
oh Shield I feel like Shields
yes I can basically run into everything
makes this much easier
and this one should disable here
yields
all right
you can shoot that thing and now I got
the blue key
and I think the blue door is in the last
Corner yeah
I think this kind of came out but also
we could be
between click on it
it's mean to do that
oh here we got that boss
I'm at the bus thanks
ah
I wasn't prepared for that
Nora
okay that's an egg
thanks for the hot bag
picture is the lock spark stuff
and that's not the gems I guess that
could have the picture replaced with the
glowing one
so I see that's one egg and there's one
more egg
and only one more spark level I can
access
because this search box level requires
climbing
oh
I think Sparks appreciates the
compliments
I hope so
now to the second world in the second
Sparks level
and that one
I have to go
I mean
this sound gonna kill somebody at the
same time it sounds fun
anyway
wait not the speedway I don't really
don't have one
this one
by the town
the Adventure Continues
now there is no tutorial
and and this is
behind the heart you set me
and go diagonally
keys for this one
I do think they
no
spider spawners
oh that's one other one of
keeping those but I don't think I need
them but keeping them there just in case
foreign
I don't know
I am the right direction
I still haven't gone like that
where does the key go
not not that one
oh yeah there's the
shouldn't it disable the shield
and this key should lead to this gate
even though there is no indication
and even though the orb is just uh
title
therefore not not really anything that
indicates what's forward or not
he uh
the sign of the Wings does help
no he doesn't lead to the gate it's
right in front of
foreign
I died
so that didn't go as well as I hoped
NASA
this is one of those game modes
that becomes harder when you die because
I lost my power up
oh
all right
because we got one of them
or they spawn gems I do need them
and then shooting diagonally
that's not the one
I don't know okay I don't know how that
works
it must be because I destroyed the other
one before yeah that's and I had
audience picked up
that's how it works
yeah please roll into the box
exit
and the button is right behind
this is like a good place to place it
I mean it doesn't make sense to have a
button that's the same as your prices in
the first place but
considering they can go straight to
their own Force build this must be the
best area
look at this
these
Parts look like a little
like that yeah
it's fun fun partner
look at this I'm just trying here
there's spiders
oh ow
damage
wow
it didn't
why are you back
or this
Health just in case
I don't have to destroy it every stuff
attacking me
there you go
whoa dude
and
you did it yeah I did
celebration
got the egg got all the chats
celebration time
and liberations
Frameworks
confetti what more kind of
Celebrations by the way
it's light show lasers
not cheering as well
a lot of celebrations
so now I actually got 80 gems
I meant eggs
yay
I can finally access dynamines
I don't see how I will be able to access
the flying level
and these
wait none of these dinosaurs yeah they
have actually actual guns
with bullets
and that's perfectly fine apparently
but the uh and dynamite
dynamites Dynamite
it's called in English I don't know
when it says
British words
but I'm sure I'm not supposed to
pronounce it Swedish way
but yeah they changed the guns in
the first spiral game to
other stuff
don't shoot the bunny
this bunny will be killed with both
hands
of it
Spanish chicken hot dogs and I can not
Flame
that enemy
thank you
even though the enemy is not the master
uh and I forgot about this now I cannot
continue on this level either
oh
that's the end of this level
that is sad sorry bunny you're stuck
here
gosh darn it you're stuck
cannot help you
no
I didn't mean to fly but there's a
there's a thing there
okay let's go back to again
and try again but this time for real but
I do think this is another case of our
lands
I or I could do that apparently
you know lying against the wall and then
somehow
getting pulled up
okay I can steal I mean
the other levels I did actually that is
cheat to get to the end of the level
stop
stop doing that and use your guns like
they're meant to be please
thank you
and now
let's just skip to the end of the knit
one
hopefully there's no Collision on the
roof
and I should be able to just drop down
the street
doesn't
always landed on that one
react if I don't destroy this one
how's that scene one
oh wait no it's a really sick one
actually
thank you now
I don't think they break down the wall
and then build it up again I don't think
that's how they escape
or if they do break down the wall to
escape and then you build the wall again
and still have no clue of how they
escaped
yeah that doesn't make sense well
foreign
ly getting those two eggs to get access
to this level I couldn't even play the
level on YouTube in accessible areas
so I mean this is the end of the round
now and now it must be an option
wait why is this one selective
I don't want this thing to be active
anyway
and I'm definitely not going to get to
this door it requires everything
okay that's cool fast builders
yeah they
reset the power ramps
yes yes
willingly dying
yeah it does good
not that that matters much because
because now I need nine eight I can't
I can't Ma
eight more eggs
to get access to this
which provides me with three eggs and
then I need seven more eggs we reach the
bus and that's not going to happen
so yeah
I guess I'll
have to officially declare this round to
be over now
unless you have some additional ideas
I keep
that I'm forgetting
this
too many
eggs missing
like this
yeah I think I think this problem is
this whole world I can't see this world
the whole world and inaccessible well
yeah
a lot of eggs
yeah it's
150 eggs and I got 82 so
but says yeah thank you for watching
and
see you next time
I will stream will be
on this Thursday
easiest is to check the schedule more
time in your time zone
hopefully that link works
it's just the
the link to my twitch page then slash
schedule
and that's when the next stream will
happen
18 o'clock on a Thursday in according to
UTC
if that helps
it's great that you had fun watching I'm
glad I can be entertaining
and even though I'm quite inexperienced
still
I hope to it is fun for me too
so
yeah how do you how do we end this
stream
I liked watching your videos they're fun
yes thank you
it's nice to know that you you like them
it's fun making them
aside from the editing
editing can take quite a long time
when I had them with those
videos on YouTube
yeah
no and I also been playing for three
hours though so it's probably time for
me to take a break as well
for that reason as well
thank you all for coming
and we'll see
if people the shows show up on Thursday
you're welcome yes yes
I I want to stay
just click the game
what's up uh
I don't have any ending cards or
anything like that so
I should probably make one
I can switch over to that when it's over
so I will close down the stream now so
if you have any final words
you want to add to the chat
I want to show up yeah I hope I hope to
see you there
it would be fun
and it's a different time so other
people might be able to
drop although it's on a Thursday so
unless you're
in
like class four
in that case or
later or plus four or higher in that
case it's on Friday
yeah I don't think I have anything more
to add so goodbye for this time and
see you later
