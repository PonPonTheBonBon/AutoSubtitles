welcome welcome everyone

hello imalo

imalo

I give you all the options

today

um let me switch over to

the correct view

which would be this one

that's

expand the views I have one more to work

it hello good evening as well

was first with the first redeem

very nice so as

see here

this is what I'm working on

creating this 3D model let's remember

this skeleton so it's easier to see

so today I should try to get the ears to

better fit onto the body

so let me hydrate

thank you

[Music]

I guess they're nice to actually have to

look something

[Music]

so let me just

make some smaller adjustments the

working area here

[Music]

yesterday

that's it

[Music]

thank you

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

no

[Music]

it should hopefully

done better now

[Music]

good morning

foreign

[Music]

not like yesterday when I fell behind a

few messages there was a pun

it was fun talking to you

all of you

so there's going to be some hair and

maybe

nothing besides must be too much time

it's not the exact

ly

I'm still waking up oh

yeah sometimes it's like that

[Music]

taking an easy morning Sunday morning

Sunday afternoon here Sunday evening

some places

[Music]

simplifying the

[Music]

shape of this one

[Music]

[Music]

hmm

[Music]

it's easy to work with after it's

growing everything

I said I wish there was a function to do

this easy here we go

foreign

if it shouldn't be like that that I

don't know

[Music]

I Like It by another way

or

I'll just do that like that

oh thank you

[Music]

oh

was a bit

not sure why it picked up on that one

welcome

palette

summer

which way

which one you

[Music]

said

why you sounds very good well yeah I'm a

girl woman and everything Elixir guide

well that's it

yeah yeah I guess I do have a pink

background here

I hear your voice by the way

yes that's that's good

I'm sure I sure hope my voice is coming

through

it's always good that's that's that you

can confirm that

yeah

um

I am mad again no actually

I don't know if you came again

I mean

foreign

[Music]

your very first message

and welcome

nice to see you here

I say title says I'm

I'm against 3D modeled

for pumpkin

it is taken from Coco in Crash already

but I've done a lot of changes to the

model so it doesn't look like cooking or

the face

how are you doing I'm doing fine

sleeping bag

[Music]

not being able to catch your late night

streams due to that

[Music]

other new hair

been streaming this as far as I

understand it

but you do is three instant stream

right

here

making a sneak at your schedule

yeah you best you're doing one string a

week

but still not being able to catch

because it's past midnight and I really

want to go to bed before midnight

so sadly it's like two characters I

would appreciate you try to be there

I hope you enjoyed at the beginning of

it at least

let's keep doing the countdown which I

guess

but more of a boring time

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

I remember hearing Castle Thompson

videos

[Music]

maybe the second song

[Music]

trying to think if that maybe maybe yeah

I think that was the second one or

something

but I appreciate the train and you were

there

and I'm very happy for that

and I can't ask for more I can't even

ask for it well I guess I could ask you

[Music]

what a bunny

come

on

[Music]

water bunny

is it fancy

[Music]

what a bunny it's a cute bunny

yeah there should be morning here and

there or something

[Music]

over there

okay

places

[Music]

so yeah this is tricky part right here

I mean it's kind of

okay quite a different reception

between cocoa as a main character and

the ears are from Bianca which is a

NPC and from two different games

so it's starting to have increased the

number of polygons

so I can

there is a function here I can do that

this increase is not applicants

instead it's too many original way to

like leave half as many that doesn't

make any sense

because

in that case it would have to do some

weird

thing

because when I increase the solution

I guess it doesn't fully keep these

positions but

kind of keeps these positions

but then they try to calculate the new

positions and finding a smooth way for

playing those

but yeah

you seem very confident

I'm happy I'm happy you think so I do

feel more confident now

and I was very scared at this time

[Music]

especially considering my own

automation

[Music]

I mean I like how I didn't present like

[Music]

oh yeah yeah definitely

it's important thing let's go to YouTube

and so

yeah since maybe I don't think

yeah I don't know if you got to know

this project but

I'm a trans woman

assigned mail address

I made it to myself

if that's a good way to express it and

last year someone last year

so one of the things that really scared

me about swimming is that I represent

myself as a woman

but at least a year

no not at least here

before I started streaming

I'm gonna be excited when I first

watched you

oh no

[Music]

and it's nothing I wanted to

say at first

[Music]

I'm basically had to test the water so

that there's something to see how

people

[Music]

okay I'm not everyone is nice

[Music]

Eric came about this day

smoothly transition over here

but yeah

so to some people it's obvious some

people had no idea I think because it's

it's because basically just mostly my

voice

and and I think

at the start it was more obvious like if

you go back and watch my very first

video

it's probably much more obvious and

[Music]

and there are

qualities to my voice I think I still

hear that

I find typical love trans women

because most people don't really picked

up on those things

to be fine

[Music]

but I think the best I guess it would be

a good

confident I don't know it's not meant to

convince more

and it's what's that one person said

that from my behavior online

they was thinking there was a trans

woman considered they recognized some

behaviors

there

trans women friends

and and I could definitely see that from

my fixation over femininity in some ways

but then the person said that when I

heard my voice that made them

reconsidish

[Music]

so the

that's nice to know

[Music]

ing that my voice pass

[Music]

I don't really look into that character

stuff because it's in the end here from

phone I mean yeah it doesn't matter

regardless

but I I just don't feel like hiding it

[Music]

it is what it is

[Music]

that I just stopped by this part but how

do I again

nice nice

I could probably sound like this part

too so in that case I should something

like this both at the same time together

so this is just

foreign

in between because that's what it might

just be

this is trying to calculate

ah create any guns as in

a

multi-sided guns uh

pentagons hexagons

how is July I haven't spoke oh how is it

Julie you know it's house do you like

because

Julie oh it's

everything

anyway

you haven't spoken to her in a long time

she was here

yes

there are two days ago because she she

showed that video in this virus string

and and that's foreign

[Music]

shhh

she seems happy

I don't know

it was um

[Music]

[Music]

was this something

yeah she was actually

so I said she was here yesterday but she

hasn't been here

for a long time before that so it's

really nice to see her in him

busy with stuff

and

this is working as a transition I

thought

maybe I should

change the hands because it tastes like

this in here

basically creating a similar one here

somehow

[Music]

that's

[Music]

yeah I haven't been able to

actually since I did check that for it

schedule

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

for a few months

[Music]

there you go

[Music]

that kind of

in stats

you must get it's almost three months

ago

[Music]

Yule is taking two nights

I tried to make a plan but

I didn't make it work eh

it's the answer kind of clicking into

the hands

minion

I only want

to rotate me somehow

[Music]

I don't know if I can

thank you

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

that's left

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

probably not but

[Music]

yeah it's not getting connected

[Music]

but I need something

an idea

[Music]

[Music]

what time is it

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

for what I should do here

there's some clipping kitchen here

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

only two Einstein tonight they aren't

the animated identical so I'm gonna

apply the Armature

it will put on the proper name

but I don't want the effects

to this

I don't want to affect that part of the

eye last one

that can go back to the hand I guess

but then there are

either yes

wow why

affecting so much

thank you

[Music]

thank you

enough

so

[Music]

I basically have an eye open

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

so again make a copy of the eyes

with the original eyes

[Music]

apply

this means that now

here

we're gonna affect the iris

because that's the I'll just cut them

[Music]

oh yeah all right she has a nice height

yep

that's an issue

that's just how how this this unboxing

[Music]

yeah

so after applying the Armature the

problem now of course

[Music]

there isn't animating anyone

so what I have to do now

is add the

another transferring

you stink a backup

copy

magic scripts and here's vertex is good

for this one

now

is going to be

again doesn't show up because I haven't

applied it oh yeah I don't really know

this must be some kind of bug

now they show up not I think I think

what it's doing is that it needs a bonus

for it to show up

but that doesn't make sense because you

should be able to see these values

because sometimes you can create a

vertical vertex group that has nothing

to do with an Armature

[Music]

because it's just a group of vertices to

really

on the

foreign

[Music]

form

and that's why

it really should sit on all because now

there are no because these are acting

the D4

that is why

it's not about it's it's by this thing

so I want to do a weights clean

obvious not sure where I can't stand it

now you only have needs but

just

I of course I don't want this to animate

anymore so to remove those

with that of course of course of course

it does make the weight

but it's strong because

[Music]

thank you

there are some points at least that

doesn't have anything so wait normalize

on

don't look back there

now when I take

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

so

let's select invert

[Music]

and I guess this will just be on The

Chase

[Music]

I don't know if that was the best

decision

because this thing is a whole night so

the other option is to

foreign

okay

vertex

there you go

like it's cleaner

remember everything that is zero

can I

copy the value of one

foreign

[Music]

group to another

and a car like move

there should be something

okay it's not exactly what I'm looking

for

this is a nice mode that's definitely

not not what I'm looking for there's a

manual mode

is very

ladies

foreign

[Music]

to go here

and then I had to do that thing on all

of these points

and I really wish there was like a

manual that way of doing it

these were TJ so by it sounds fun yeah

not dreamy

um

[Music]

let's hit this government it is

Plus

take this

Plus

delete wow two points out of I don't

know how many

foreign

thank you

[Music]

wow

that's rid of some of them

I really need nothing but different

maybe some we need some

and blender Guru here

knows how to do this

um

otherwise that's not all

a lot of these are on top of each other

so that's no problem

it's on these

yeah definitely need an automatically

experience I can't do this manually

before

transfer

no nothing works from different

why lick everything

and we'll keep everything

inside

oh

my God

really it should be able to

foreign

from one mesh to another which is what

I've been doing for all this time but

obviously that's not what I'm trying to

do now

oh you're really licking away from the

not know the now the

funny set

add the third one you should have very

fast licking

and

[Music]

I'll show you

foreign

[Music]

I wouldn't mind taking a shower though

[Music]

like all these values should end up

there one

[Music]

yeah

because

if all of this doesn't have no that's

not it then I can just copy that

[Music]

for some reason it doesn't

be yeah

thank you foreign

[Music]

[Music]

it's okay let's copy this one right one

mine is this value it is a bit quicker

so

I really don't have to focus on all

these points

spaghetti

input one is in love

and the swimsuit time is definitely over

by now

I assuming it's a throw in the spaghetti

but um

maybe it's part of the spaghetti jumping

away

it was first yesterday

no one

I guess now I redeemed this year first

yesterday

oh and

no one gets the price

you're gonna make it much I'm not sure

whether it makes this large because you

can't see the high top but I mean she

foreign

[Music]

in our hearts

there's no instituting I know there is

no animation anything made for that

anyway so

but they should be

foreign

[Music]

in my dream of having fun animator

and having these funny routines

the bathroom's tummy

partying

do you want a little dance

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

cup

by water please say for the remain

whatever the source model contains you

can

versus

missing participates

must be exciting one

that makes someone championship

one let us know the missing groups do

not overlap therefore I could go so

everyone please need well in question

and check its groups if versions no

groups it must start with the one in a

missing you it's very simple one group

and it's less than one is your blood

jump

foreign

[Music]

thank you

no it's really easy man

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

work on useless stuff

like the eyelashes I'm not going to have

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

points I want to

make this very coordinated

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

oh

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

chest

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

probably simplify the geometry here

because it doesn't need to look like

this

[Music]

is

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

because I don't think it needs all this

polygons if

if the blink animation is gone anyway

[Music]

because you can hire institution anyway

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

I really did the tastes because I didn't

see these before

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I'm making some pair with only

[Music]

[Music]

good morning

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

foreign

[Music]

foreign

foreign

[Music]

let's go through

[Music]

yes it again is Now activity

foreign

[Music]

nice all right perfect but

something

[Music]

not yet

Chinese girl here

it's a flower

because that point

blood in

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

anyway

[Music]

I got that put together that means that

now

[Music]

I just need to add

very nice

the actual eyelashes she has

[Music]

I don't really know what the history is

representing

so for the black line there

I could just follow this part here

I think that would be fine

[Music]

the a shape the eye shape isn't exactly

the same

[Music]

could probably do some

adjustments to that room

shouldn't be any problem I mean

it should be higher here I think

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

foreign

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

okay

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

foreign

foreign

[Music]

thank you

I should probably create a collection

that is specifically

so this is

what for Stuff This is

on on

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

thanks

[Music]

[Music]

I guess the bottom of the eye could be

raised up

greatness

this thing here

in here

[Music]

that's what we'll call it

[Music]

I was also thinking but

[Music]

considering the less roundness of

don't worry

question mark

I understand it is

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

oh yes okay

now I have a nice CCC

good night

blessed that you were around me

makes me happy

I want to spend some time with

[Music]

tonight I've been kind of quiet

because it's not

much to talk about

sometimes

but

all right

foreign

thank you

foreign

what kind of snack is there

so yeah I'll make I'll make it black on

this Edge I think that would reflect

what should it be up here I don't know I

don't try to

dependent now

the cooker has like this

foreign

dishes but the chips everywhere the

flavor this is a joke I like

I like the lightly salted chips

[Music]

the lightly salt these chips

last week I had a ghost pepper flavored

but I

put the top

oh

yes

[Music]

[Music]

really don't try to think like

are the things when what are these ships

[Music]

I think

I just

it's

[Music]

chips

so that's the piano but I mean it works

in singular after because the plural

doesn't change

in that entire world

she has quite ahead

this should be like a small point a big

Point small point

[Music]

should just copy this one

[Music]

is there anything I mean this this

yeah

she has hair in the English

foreign

[Music]

because it needed yes

so

and then it's in there that's great with

non-spawn

Smooths

products

[Music]

so tomorrow it's crash bash again that

game are playing after that as crash

bash

I don't know

it's a lot more from Crash pasture

it will take the complete Everything

James is getting harder

but

foreign

[Music]

games

I think back to the team first ones

and what would be fun is that I get the

crash inspired across over at the same

time

[Music]

like that

but yes pressure about it it was a yeah

impress of mortex

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

up

[Music]

if any appointments

[Music]

I didn't eat that one because that's

just somewhere like that

you can use my aesthetic envelope

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

no that's what they said

yes the curse of more text that's

because if you split the two first

letters it's Wrath of Cortex which is

the actual name of the game

[Music]

of course I don't think I will be able

to sing Everything

actually no no

very nice if a spider it is the

adventure or attack of Grinders whatever

your car that's the next game no

no they have a spider

after crash bash

as he said it's the huge adventure and

entranced

which are

despite the crash games however I could

probably skip straight to the crossover

for crashes one

let's try to finish crash bash and

spiral

Adventure at the same time although I've

already started as a crush passion I

can play it like these two streams and

I'm going to start Inspire but maybe the

spider game is short we'll see

[Music]

[Music]

we will sing

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I wonder if this is working

[Music]

so yeah

[Music]

can I meet up

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

already

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

discolored this color

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

laughs

[Music]

maybe I shouldn't like

[Music]

connected out this side as well

[Music]

yeah I think that that would be very

light slowly taking the shape of

London's face

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

it's like adjustments needing

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

thank you

I heard many times

[Music]

like that

[Music]

but I need to

it's smoothly connected right

[Music]

the same problem as high with the ear I

just don't know how to

properly bake them

go together

[Music]

speaking of that maybe I should go back

to the ear short bits

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

foreign

foreign

foreign

[Music]

foreign

you want it

foreign

foreign

foreign

[Music]

it would be in a sportswear I mean the

pink dress would of course be the

definitely front outfit with a purple

hair

actually but what

oh hey I see why don't they hurting

in space

[Music]

otherwise it's it's a bit picky I wish

they just did the

discovery of just

allowing cold out there on it

but sadly

yeah

search for it but

let's check that like

having it well change color is

interesting that should happen next

I decided to it when she goes swimming

she has to

switches out the whole Bowl 121.

[Music]

one left

[Music]

matches the swimsuit and I guess this

it's the same sports but she also

switched off switch switching it though

she likes of me

foreign

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

there you go that's that's a Swedish pun

ultimate based on hair

but not but with a different part of

course

the Swedish word for hair

the

their

hair

on your head

that is pronounced as horror and what we

spelled completely different

does not sound like

switch word for hair which is hard

[Music]

[Music]

and graciously good yes

very good

Bridge itself isn't

it it's a very awkward way of saying

that your hair is good I guess

good indeed but it also means I have a

good one or something like that

[Music]

bro

[Music]

however the beat you can change too hard

there bro

some reason the D sound calculation R

sound

and I don't know

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I don't think they do but I actually

don't know

because I did two choice but I so I

don't know if you change it to an orange

sound

I don't know if all dialects but like

what fundament work if there wasn't one

thing so

foreign

[Music]

don't singular dominating

in a similar

[Music]

is similar chances to Peru two three

[Music]

like Scottish I don't think I think

[Music]

thank you

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

thank you

six seven one two zero Perkins

627 yeah I know I know I don't really

have anything with spend enough but if

there is something in the future you

will be like the VIP when it comes to

like I guess a good thing is whatever

you want this planet you can spend it

could never be fun

without it it's basically like you have

an infinite account

which I guess you should

I guess you could be lovely

you just don't have any

this stuff is basically

arguments I want to be shot assassin

yeah

well

certainly would be

I mean

as it says

you get

30 points per 15 minutes plus the

stressed if you are active every 50

minutes

that means

150 minutes an hour

multiplied by the subscription that is

384 points per hour if I stream singers

regularly that's

1152 points for every stream

or over a thousand points every stream I

do and then I do this drawing stream

Summits like if I do the six hours

over 2 000 points

but if you go back to original value and

if you have you won't reach 100 000 in

here C7 100

and then divided by DMR ticket and

that's about 28 more days

so yeah it takes a while

but you're like two-thirds of the way

you ordered a good way

I don't have worked yet because I looked

huge yeah

I mean it would be strange if someone

had more than you someone has been

lurking every single sleep

and never spent a single one

the energies

because you can I guess it's not true

because

that's your viewers

and also knows when I was thinking of

you

so

[Music]

it should be a badge house

I mean that's really because that's just

however if there was accounted for how

many characters or points and in the

brand new channel you have got overall

for oh across like

yeah overall basically if you spend the

points this character will not subtract

yeah I think you know what I mean and if

this character reaches 100 000 that's uh

okay that I could see

because switch shouldn't encourage like

not spending points

which is kind of problem with having too

expensive redeems

which does give me idea currently that

it would be something that I like

to

points

and Care coins and

[Music]

numbers

I can carve something

[Music]

spent any

I don't know

I have a lonely history of events

happening but it only goes back so far

it doesn't say how much it cost down

which is a problem because I did change

the price and I don't remember

yeah it goes by 23 days with the redeems

23 days ago you did

doesn't say

which time but he did redeem the hydrate

and another one

and another one

three times

empty

we are having a lifetime character would

be nice

but uh

[Music]

someone could argue a bit too late to

add it now yes but I mean better late

than memories

today

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I have accurate I do this doesn't matter

really I should just be like that and

then it doesn't really matter in the

middle of you

yeah those hydrogative side more to let

you know

oh if that's what you're trying

yeah it is nice to know that you're

still here

[Music]

thank you

so that's that's the one I don't think

it's gonna be with this from Friends

that's it it's nothing

well

these people are watching it which means

that's kind of neat

there might be a number but how many of

them are actually paying attention to

what's going that's I mean sure you're

right about that

might be sleeping I mean Roy had said

that he was going to bed he might not

have turned off the Stream

which is the case because I have watched

a Rolex

before I go when I'm going to bed and

then basically said as an office today

basically going to go sleeping

or lifting his team play

[Music]

which of course would keep the number up

but

yeah I'm not bad feeling watching

[Music]

I don't know what the body is running

his own stream but I can still there

yeah I don't really have the ad stuff

works

like can you do like

[Music]

a Wolfram screaming some of this

[Music]

like

foreign

[Music]

the only people that shows up on this

list is

outside

[Music]

but myself

[Music]

which are the four people who has ever

written in this chat since I started

screaming so I don't think

okay it only shows four options okay

that is

[Music]

[Music]

how come

[Music]

Roy's first one

[Music]

yeah

that's that's it

so yeah the only people who show us up

other people are essentially written

something

[Music]

that's not

[Music]

because restaurant high and then I

haven't seen the word

foreign

so if you were to refresh the stream you

might not be able to

at anyone

well

if I promise to be able to help me

and yourself

okay

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

you can't

so you can do like a

this is a ping against

and this is a reply

not as far as the sunscreen chat is

concerned they are the same thing

uh it might be a way to me because in

this in the twitch chat on desktop.com

they haven't implemented this movement

and you can actually see which message

you're applying to which is nice

featuring and also I can then further

reply

how do I reply to

which again on otherwise the desktop the

browser version and then I can show this

thread

the original message that was replied to

in every reply to this thread

what I don't like is how when I preview

the

the message that I replied to

a previous the the actual original

message

which is really awkward if you have

because I have that's something they

really should consider if you think

because I read I write a message someone

replies to my message I reply to them I

said creating a thread but then on my

message if you when you see it on

desktop

I should say web when you see it on the

web and the the

preview of the message I'm replying to

is my own message but that's actually

not what I'm replying to but it is the

first message of the thread

they should fix that

[Music]

but it in outside it's a book because it

is

it's a very nice picture it keeps things

organized

peace right page

be a wrong batch

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

something like that

[Music]

this means that I can

remove the interior because they should

really not help

ing inside like this

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

foreign

[Music]

oh hello everybody

[Music]

is training

I think that's the interesting

it's supposed to be the second inside

Maybe

now I see what I did

[Music]

oh

my God

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

let's see what about this acting

now about the ad system may only come

hey Thursday whoever is

regardless if they're actually not this

for a second team sadly

yeah I guess what it's too much well um

I mean he's dreaming he's not really

watching but he has his team open

[Music]

I'm still interested I have a bit of a

problem doing that like like if I'm

playing a game being open but he's too

much power he needs too much performance

[Music]

foreign

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

and then I guess the ear should move a

bit with the animation like the both of

[Music]

who are these things

I also like how they haven't even make

sure that they

Microsoft discrete patch

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

because if you just do this yeah you can

clearly see that that the Whaley part is

not meant to go on there

[Music]

decided experiments yeah

you considering the final piece called

four not five they don't really have one

piece

let me leave one

remember maybe it's mostly see

one two three four five six seven eight

nine

that would be the longest

you can do without having them different

things

to be fair one of them is

you could add one more wave today what

is that I guess you should make a

lounging company mode that is put

together and see your first one yeah

but that would take so you afford it the

hair embody starts you know

behind me as he props as well what I'm

saying I was also taking the proper

stepson hey my first batch is appearing

in some of my messages guys

is she that's weird

it's secretly telling you that you

should switch over to the panel

it didn't funny anything

he doesn't even show up

it should be level levels three at the

moment I think

just as I am

and they will sleep on me

[Music]

so there's a Clipper switch and not

purchase

[Music]

[Music]

I mean I guess I could

make it

it's kind of oversized

eight percent

[Music]

there it is it's five percent

[Music]

I can't stand on my end but it's missing

my previous message yeah and sometimes

it disappeared it stands

nothing f is happening

what the f

play

song bites from Anonymous Channel

hey do you know about knowledge

[Music]

[Music]

yeah

that's what

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I don't normally secretly working in

here

who's that is

foreign

[Music]

I don't know if he has

I'm not like following much not

something because he doesn't tell me

give me something to create more

it's busy with another substance pain

maybe she's

waiting

because she's working uh

[Music]

[Music]

public useful and

making sure

this is expectation that maybe they will

be new

emails based on anymore

[Music]

but there is

so there should be a tuft of hair

and I've talked

do you still have this one which has a

head of the hair here

which I should be able to copy

so

empty

there's all this stuff though

this one's kind of hires

do you think

[Music]

I definitely designed that doesn't get

in there for these groups maybe I'll

delete them from their home

thing

[Music]

[Music]

come on

is here

[Music]

a cute little kids

[Music]

that's that's a bit oversized isn't it I

mean it's not too far off

[Music]

[Music]

sneak these two extra Tufts of hair on

the top

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

because it does have an inside too

what

let's copy it again then let's see if

it's that early

everything is finished now

and this alcohol

what should I call this

these are like

hands but

now let's cut let's call it

Jeff flips on now okay

let's call this one hairs because let's

paint it what is at this point

and then this one I'll call

um

[Music]

thank you

again

is that seriously similar a single tough

to appear I guess maybe it's better I

don't know

I didn't know I don't speak English

fun fun standing on a fair open what's

telling one study soon she's riding

someone's actually making a mods

adding crash to spire

another

so crashes riding spider

yeah but I don't know if that was

actually I have any animated crash you

should steady crash but considering it

technically it's possible to do customer

animations just takes a lot of effort

you could have an animated compassion

that was fire who is reacting to

everything just riding along spiral

that would kind of be funny

that would be kind of funny for some

reason

[Music]

especially with all the things but like

lines mine is flying

spiders dying defying

[Music]

I think I powered up

foreign

I mean that's the point of the

animations you would find a way to make

gliding work

[Music]

Spyro mod crash

no uh that wasn't working trash riding

crash and exactly writing those

priorities

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I mean if cash is sitting like behind

spider's Wings spider could see if

they're not nine

[Music]

and because as I said yeah the flying is

it's a separate animation of course okay

so crash could

like

be animated in such a way that it

doesn't get in the way

of

the pregnant lady

oh no of course Pittsburgh

foreign

but I do want to take these pins

duplicate it

this long robots

foreign

foreign

it would be so much nicer each

[Music]

if there was like color shift

if

the

customizer okay what they need for the

customer suction is one allow for any

emails to be chosen sure and so so first

off they definitely need to add

vulnerable emotes in this list

and then sure they could lock out the

second tier two and three emails as well

as bits emotes from people who have yet

not unlocked them and only allow you to

customize them if you have them unlocked

that doesn't seem like a hot check for

them to end

they could technically do the same with

having to unlock the uh

tier one subscriptions

[Music]

but

about this

what is this green and blushing blush is

a cream but when you do customize them

they you have mirror which is good and

you have switch which I think

but it's fine I guess the English I have

a big bits the same way then you should

have this question the other way too

unless it's completely useless but I

lost mature TV but

it's so easy

almost as if they should have been here

they are thinking

this classic country

[Music]

and also there's thinking hand in being

yellowed and also with the I mean that's

also a thing that could change so

yes when you go to your emotes

which takes up a slot on me so yeah

so basically what you upload an emote

is in your emote library and then you

can assign it to a slot that's basically

how it works

in this emote Library you should be able

to see and yes and in the emote Library

and you can assign an email to

as long as I said I was going to say you

can also choose who the artist is

and I wonder what she's ready to

[Music]

foreign

artist

s

yeah but missing a bit of poop in your

mouth instead

[Music]

in in those settings they could add the

uh which color the sinking hand should

be

they could also allow you to I guess

more settings like session

off the hand then

sunglasses

[Music]

[Music]

so those effects can be quite useful

okay

welcome back Ultimate Fan maybe I've

been lucky

[Music]

and you said you had

that baseball match

yeah there we go I caught here she is

not your fault

can you hear [ __ ] now

anyway

no I don't put my nose

I mean yeah that one is the worst best

[Music]

and you should basically have

adjusting the length of the

Beach Bridge I guess

position height and how close

the glasses should be and there are

lessons it wouldn't be a lot of

something still to make it fit

just having a position itself would help

vanish

American pump

she said so

[Music]

because it's my sunglasses America

sounds like no one knows this

[Music]

you know it's an American if they wear

sunglasses like this doesn't say

[Music]

well a glass base

as glass is less and I got the space

[Music]

so but almost great

foreign

[Music]

and

this one is a bit trickier because

I would I would argue this is the only

way to spell it you could argue it

should be spelled this way because the

final vowel is short but that's not

really a valid spelling

I would argue that should be the

spelling in Swedish or Swedish should

utilize

um long vowel markers in some languages

do but

yeah we just answered around yeah

so yeah yeah you're right two glass

organ

[Music]

[Music]

I don't know what glass is maybe there's

something for that

please

[Music]

she just didn't remember which left

skills which would sound I guess which

makes sense

you'll get it eventually

the spelling isn't perfect it has a

system

um

but it is fairly consistent

[Music]

and some inconsistencies are consistent

like how the k sound can make both that

my care sound and a share sound that's

simply based on which vowel comes after

if it's a front burner background

[Music]

I mean it's just because you know it

more but I do give you that songs which

words are

small spin is probably

Eastern some

because it's probably more consistent

and so that's probably not the problem

it's just mostly

mostly home

not to slam kiddies

I know it's me about it but otherwise

it's probably consistent

it also has its fair share of electric

combinations making silent sounds

distant independency I mean

you do still have a letter exchanging

results depending which vows comes after

them team

foreign

[Music]

I guess it's just Swedish is more of

them but I mean it's still consistent

it's just that of a consonant some

consonants a few consonants have two

different sounds depending if you have

if it's group one or group two polish

kind of has the same it's just that it

has

one vowel in its own group

Swedish just has more vowels in that

group

so I guess you could argued easier

because it's on the singing vowel

instead of more than one and that yeah

that's it's true

I'll give you that I mean

it

it is true

I can't see that's wrong

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

and there are some exceptions I'm trying

to think of an exception

it's usually when it comes to sprouting

it's usually it's common words that are

okay

and common words and

rather modern loanwords

like one word that is often inconsistent

from languages is the word Pizza it's

often used in Italian spelling or

Italian pronounces that z s

the

and some languages do change the

spelling

especially if they are not using Latin

script

the most languages keep the

the Italian spelling

process inconsistencies with the rest of

the language

and then people arguing like what you

teach entirely and we should keep the

Italian spelling because it's an Italian

word

but that's apparently not true for every

other word

yeah the same way I can miss it like we

should we should spell the word online

not not like the Swedish membership is

but the English waves because it comes

remakes

see but

there's so many loan words in Swedish

that has changed the spelling

and I'm pretty sure people will not go

back on those words

the basic people people aren't arguing

for

that they don't want consistent spelling

well

that they want the original spelling

wherever it comes from they just don't

want to change the spelling

foreign

[Music]

think of the people who has to learn the

language okay which is both people

adults and children

anyway is that that's important

and Sweden has had spider share of

spelling informs

the recent

uh

is changing the spelling of

these three words may they say

to their the way they are actually

pronounced

this isn't an official spelling form and

people can spread both ways

but when you're learning the language in

school for example you are allowed to

use both however you must be consistent

it's one or the other not you can't mix

them

is this good

sorry

movies again

oh look it's pink

this is

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

from whichever question you want to be

this one should be a bit smelly

and this one

it should be a slight emoji

[Music]

okay I Can See For example

[Music]

that's right

at least you tried

[Music]

[Music]

so like

thank you

[Music]

it's starting to look like fun fun

please put the potato

es looking things

I don't know I changed pronunciation

trying to say the word

[Music]

[Music]

oh

okay

we found an example

um

some exceptions can be found

foreign

I wonder if I should now maybe

maybe I can add a big puppy

that's a tip

suppose this would just be and

it's that thing

very realized

okay I think it

yeah that this doesn't really

steep

yeah

it's smooth

thank you

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

yeah

in that case

and I don't really get it

point after it's not writing it with the

ash sound when it makes a dash sound

range

DN is probably a reason but

because I did that

well

ah I forgot to add

mache

thank you

[Music]

why so high up

there you go

how face is messed up

and I really don't get that because

well that's a tent

on Instagram

[Music]

copper face that's the same thing so

my coffee stuff like that

let's meet away from the distance but

that is yesterday ending of from this

beauty

I don't know this is always messed up I

haven't fixed this yet I can remember

now

all right

I don't know what animation is this is

it's possibly that they haven't

considered the

what the face looks like because you're

not seeing the face

this is

because I haven't modified the face

very flexible I have questions I'm sorry

and the ears

everything beautiful

I know it's making that space

I just don't know it's a bit weird

you should be like going down into

Chrome

just everything is a bit

[Music]

laughs

let's um

that's some kind of idle pose I guess

she actually does the game

[Music]

[Music]

is different

[Music]

all right this is a long ID Plus

[Music]

now it's clicking into the body

[Music]

but it moves

[Music]

into the body I need to fix that

somewhere

and

because that's that's something you're

actually going to be able to see

that's not good

I know introducing Dimension they have

things called work Intercity like

uh smear frames would be anything that

looks ridiculous but but unless it's

Reflections mostly English best answers

the translation

the memorial means

yeah

[Music]

so

it's it's it's

[Music]

one reason given is that it's

that thing animation

you can get the next

exaggerated animation

[Music]

sometimes once

[Music]

or added effects

[Music]

okay

okay

swirl

I wanted uh

it doesn't really move as I expected it

obviously I don't want that to happen

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

years

just a girl

that's fine that's quite fine

yes wouldn't it be much more trouble if

I just

modify it

be complete

okay let me

modify to actually work please

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

what did you do in there

[Music]

badge

[Music]

already in my pony barrel with someone

else

[Music]

and because I had it

[Music]

I have to wash my coffee cup and my

French prints

oh my French press

fancy

swimsuit

s are swimming

[Music]

suit yourself well I usually put on my

suit myself

[Music]

thank you

yep I really like how the coffee turns

out that thing

and then changes offensive

minutes here's where there goes

I need to

don't ask me how it's connected to the

Head

that's irrelevant

it just is

glue down there

thank you

foreign

thank you

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

is

lashes and

[Music]

[Music]

all right

[Music]

Clips slightly I think

[Music]

it's better than a bit more at least

hey man it's so nice that the ears

actually element

even though they are like

I said gelatin

I'm gonna take this to the side okay now

let's see does the

as far as I can see the tape this is

because there are these tailbones here

it's your heart related

particulated

why is the tail line waiting does Coke

have a tail

here but it does have that contents at

the maintenance

is a technical kids

because it should be much more

consistently animated I like the thing

the thing right not actually

and some animations

[Music]

foreign

and then I can add the whatever

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

this dancing he is fighting yes I don't

see cocoa has attended Frankenstein that

functions liver yeah but why does why

does the skeleton have

uh

[Music]

fail animation on the Coco's animation

[Music]

that is the community party

[Music]

this bus is very very different you can

kind of see it

if

I was expecting a bit more bouncing but

I guess it adds a bit of characters

this this thing here and I don't know

why

[Music]

because Coco doesn't have a teeth

[Music]

the animation for it

okay what how does yeah

[Music]

hers is running start working

[Music]

and the answer back

it's just a very

[Music]

very weird

animation

[Music]

yeah

[Music]

anyway

and yeah

[Music]

and like I know that it probably meant

for being a dial because every character

is used in the same skeleton never

playable character but why would it be

animated in Coco's editions that's the

great parties

[Music]

maybe they used to wear cereal

[Music]

so I thought I fixed the eyes no I

didn't

all right

academic experience

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

oh you're at point you've done this

correctly

ah

this is

yeah because they are pure red that is

why

we like to select invert

by those then I deselect select invert

with these

[Music]

Magic

[Music]

so I had value here

should basically be one minus that

is that

minus that

because zero

when I confirm that then

[Music]

minus that

minus that

and yeah looks like it's not sealing it

[Music]

is

every each of these three

apparently this

is

interesting I didn't expect that

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

now

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

that's it

what's up

I just took all the missing values and

set at TV

[Music]

that would save me some

headache

[Music]

[Music]

no I lost my attention

[Music]

from here is where it starts having

actual value

[Music]

and that that was much easier was just

one minute

[Music]

hello Alexander Kevin

[Music]

welcome to the modding

[Music]

I like your love listening that's why

it's a hit

[Music]

when I was saying that I was 18.

I like it

[Music]

hello

yeah if I apply these values this should

hopefully start stop

acting weird

this one is going to practice you don't

need

[Music]

I have my eyes

[Music]

and sometimes they had

great group is included and sometimes

it's missing

[Music]

I just

remember that I actually don't have to

click on a point

because it doesn't have anything he has

to copy itself

one of the property value or however

you're ready

foreign

team

makes me translate this I don't know

which

the Earth

and I don't remember which I need to

remember which

I do it

I'm out of hydrated

[Music]

do I need a headache

should I get highlight or should I just

Niche upward where I am

been so far

and I'm going it

as in ending the streaming

so

I want to finish up these points and

then I want to test it in game

because I think I'm basically done with

me

[Music]

scorpion

can you do me this kind of favor depends

what it is you may Call Me Miriam but

that's not your username I'm not going

to remember that

a nice because a lot of people make fun

of me

some drugs can't bring it but I'm not

saying that

constant voice by serving anyway

but I'm not saying that I'm saying

Alexandria Gabriel

[Music]

now

[Music]

well but

Alexandria

or captain

[Music]

I need a reminder of listening

to be to remind myself I think

I think he said which

[Music]

yeah

because I can't think I'm really

they didn't realize my appointments used

to teach you still can't teach us

Bad Teachers friendly and well

[Music]

I want to respect you by seeing you

um

it's fully and as properly as I can

[Music]

but I can

not do the freedom project

[Music]

foreign

but uh but I still want to want a

nickname to still be a part of it of the

username that affects everyone and

because of the two reasons one as I

mentioned I'm really bad at remembering

names so having

a nickname that is not part of his name

is going to be hard for me to remember

and the other is that which is an issue

have another streams where people have

what the streamer is using a nickname

for a user which does not reflect their

username I don't know who they're

speaking about

and even if they tell do tell who it is

I will forget about it

and then I'm confused next time they use

that name and I can't remember who it

was

and sometimes I think I know who it is

but I don't trust myself I don't trust

my memory

what kind of meant to eat yeah

are you going to be changing his name

is

[Music]

yeah when it's 100 hands yeah and it's

only hands up that's definitely makes it

easy

let's see then stop the left hand nope

have it tuned already

then there's some

back here

because if I sometimes when I click on

it to edit the value

it doesn't open it like this

okay

but sometimes it doesn't open it I'm

gonna move the cursor and then it types

it

so it is ready to just doesn't do the

update

and I guess it doesn't update on the

lemon because

I didn't realize it's all right

this one should be open

[Music]

what's the brow all the way down here

when it wasn't all right one

so

enough

[Music]

oh and then this between sometimes with

it and this button is

and there is a big software itself

I guess you're gonna have to expect some

all it is with it

not many many points

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

I forgot about food be right back

what kind of foods

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

with what food What food did you bring

with you

and can you share it with me

food

[Music]

which is kind of funny when some some

people have like my personality is

eating

um that's not like everyone has to heat

so now it does that and as soon as the

cursor is

which of it

with me no no I did it again

it was weird

like

one chicken from a restaurant called the

Panda Express

do they have pie this day

no I didn't do this correctly

did they deliver by paying this

[Music]

I don't remember pandas being so

expressly

[Music]

I want to remember Paramus being quite

of a lazy animal

maybe that's the joke maybe it's a joke

yeah they do so pain that's why she's

I do have a pair of pleasure

[Music]

let me stop now

someone should walk into my bedroom

and I open the door and then get swarmed

by pandas

drenched in plushies how does that work

the drowning that she's

[Music]

okay

this one

one answer this is the risk of Ashes

learn it again

it's awkward

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

oh yeah oh yeah for some reason I didn't

show up in my oh

you know I didn't show up in a field

because I had 50.

oh sorry about that this account only

follows men hello

um

Mr transform remember what we report his

account

[Music]

it wouldn't go under using it maybe

[Music]

I put it on the username and

um

[Music]

yeah bullying and

[Music]

targeted a

H okay

and

[Music]

thank you

and how about me block the usual edit

there we go

that's what

[Music]

and

since I blocked the user default should

be removed

hello I'm here for a little bit my

supervisors art for a family emergency

so I have to take charge today oh it

sounds like a very important job today

yeah don't let me distract you

uh but it's very nice for you to show up

here

you really appreciate that

[Music]

what shame I've missed that photo when

it happened

anyways

thanks for letting me know by the way

even though that wasn't the real photo

so

[Music]

it is no problem

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

maybe I haven't been a I try to

senior I actually don't know how much

because I can't really see I'm actually

um

there you go that's your that's your

magic trick

medium

I see any clearance

scene that's so much better having a

username you more comfortably

did you change the account what did you

actually

yeah it says that the earthquake count

is gone

and you still have follow me for it

two months so that should be it

seems like any name in the account is it

quickly

but

can I say something in Finnish that you

will then translate for everyone I mean

I don't speak English I wouldn't be able

to translate it

but sure you can write something I don't

mind people watching different languages

um like

I understand that some streamers don't

like it and I respect that I am that big

one you're not finished

stuff oh you can still write something

in Finnish

[Music]

and then you can hear my attempt of

reading it

[Music]

I'm open for different languages

obviously the default these standard

rules Appliance and even to other

languages

[Music]

there you go there's some

Swedish instance

[Music]

yeah I think I have it might not display

for you and depending on where you are

watching from but I do have the text

Sweden

but yeah

it might not it's not just doesn't

always show up so

I understand

read for it

three two eight

two three

[Music]

one two three

or something like that

[Music]

I would actually practice finish numbers

[Music]

thank you

and I can even do it in English

the first lash in singular but have to

see General even though yeah

[Music]

well I guess that's just how I am anyway

foreign

[Music]

as currently

these are completely completely towards

the head

that

doesn't seem to be mean

[Music]

now I feel as good as a puppy being

patented

peace

[Music]

I need to have

[Music]

have any much for that

but maybe it's a bit

weird to have it as fun fun

but I

they have access to other at pets which

are cats

a cat cat the human cat coming back

hello and hello kitten again eating for

the heart

[Music]

once you're not speak and I see that you

turn pink

oh you did a trick and changed the

outfit

that's a nice trick

[Music]

so this is I

vertex group and

this vertex is going to give

like this effect

apology

Edge vertex

this vertex

[Music]

this face

let's give it slightly different effect

foreign

Maybe

because these parts are affected by

brows a lot maybe that shouldn't be

things but

you can see I so close today

so maybe I should

[Music]

reduce the effect of things

[Music]

okay so no worry about nice

now they have a higher

there should be seen here yet

I see the Lesser there are the higher

effects the more stretched it would be

I have I have one

equivalent to that

which is this one doesn't sharpen no it

doesn't show up in large of an entire

airplane

we are in summer and everyone goes to

the pool all to the beach let's all go

but put police at home modding in her

swimsuit

I have a Swedish friend who taught me to

speak Swedish in three months

how much speed is doing them

that's so good

[Music]

yogic Channel

[Music]

oh no no

I didn't want to reduce effects

even further

[Music]

this air

maybe I

could have to all of these

memories only

and now

I think it's probably affect being

affected

okay you know what

let's be do this and duplicate these

separate these

this is three and then when I change

from

currently this one

there's three

basically 10.

[Music]

okay let me try again

switch everything is Edge in this

changes slightly and then I switch this

there we go that's a bit better

that's what I keep

we're still very right here

[Music]

Los Angeles

[Music]

you're doing

you are a very good kitten

you're doing so just such a good job

I'm very proud of you we got focused

[Music]

we learn Swedish

today's word is I don't remember what to

do this for this

[Music]

thank you

so much

bye kitten

have a good day

something he could sign some

I don't know what time it is over there

is a good day

[Music]

no I'm going to find them

that is my destiny

family Roman

[Music]

figure

any final modifications

dancing [ __ ] is very cute I should

probably have one one to do that

business

leave it alone by hand

leave it alone which is pure cherry

sometimes I Shadows you don't even go to

kindergarten

let's pray let me

or is it yeah I've heard that some

people argue that they're a really

terrible hybrid I do Monday

is it because

[Music]

it doesn't work because I also had to

modify this stuff really me

yeah

because I was consider myself to have a

terrible handwriting however I did very

carefully slowly making it look much

better yeah

nice so that's what difference it's much

necessary this one but I do wonder if

more people just who consider themselves

to have bad handwriting if they would

put more effort into the hair writing

enough

anyway here's pumpkin should we test in

uh

let me take one one for a spin

I'll say this as brushing through

and

I haven't launched the editor I should

probably have done that while I was

working on this

thingy

it's nice to see you again and here you

see the boys have to

have to pay medium I'm happy I'm glad

you like my voice

I'm gonna do silly stuff sometimes speak

silly

eat a bit silly that's

that's when I go into myself the remote

I did have the silly tag but then I

remember because it wasn't popular

you should see my handwriting let's just

say it was there it was beneficial

because no one could be in mind how it's

different no one ever asked to borrow or

steal them

is not a problem not tasty forces

thank you

that's how dates work

my previous test

it's been like 24 hours since my last

attempt nest place it with a

Silver version 0.1

and now

I will

not close

wait

[Music]

I popped

yeah

let me let me just copy it one more time

just beside sudden I got a little bit

thank you

because he says no it says 30 yeah

something comes around there

I had to run with it okay generate a new

one

copy the new one

placing you up

yeah

now it's using latest one

so now

across I really entered

since I'm not going to do any more

changes in blending yeah because Blended

because same resources

uh well quite ahead shortcut to the

start battle.net

yeah I guess I could have started too

before

oh it's actually

not six seven yeah you can secret

protein so I just got a lot of credit I

might not be ready to show them all just

yeah

you know

why does it have a lot more than one

short one

[Music]

oh

[Music]

starting fresh launching press and

perspective oh

in what

one stretch to the side and one stretch

forward I guess

this one's got poke itself all right

[Music]

[Music]

when starting a crash

[Music]

it is launching crash the learning bar

is hiding behind Pom-Pom

but it's not the leveling bar it's just

uh

it's just an animation it's just a video

file having the the bar increase so

that's actually doing something but

however if the video file ends it goes

to black screen

when I fake glasses

I was going on here I guess that one was

the best because you don't see any Aries

please wait for login

this game says automatically

do not turn off the game wonderful

wait what's the

pressure music

[Music]

whirling swirling it's loading and then

loading

dude

I

[Music]

wish I don't know

the texture is all messed up but that

wasn't bad

she got a little pause

moving the window

chairs are sick hands

clipping a bit through this but I can

make a new tablet which I'll make a bit

shorter

to compensate for the new hands yeah the

hips are working

yeah there are the right thing

but the little hearts after their

forehead yeah that's also animating

slightly not too much but there is some

animation thing

everyone shakes her head with the ears

are flopping around

and yeah and both should

is slightly coming through but

I could I can reduce it around this

slightly on the air I could probably

push the inside

foreign

stretches out

the black part of the eye

make sure I guess

next part I guess is to do the

guest house now should I shouldn't have

this down

okay

this is only those two and

and also

this like because this is inventory

attached to the face like that this bit

actually see in the teeth but the tooth

is working as well I could make the

teeth

not as low make them slightly high a bit

higher absolutely

from this is

I think the eyelashes are fine and I

don't know what you call this part

the other is stretching out

and I'll just have to do something about

eyelids yeah I needed something

is either that the bottom part should

follow up uh or at the top part of that

should not follow up

there's two options

what does it look on regular cocoa then

yeah it's

yeah I should I should just in that case

yeah I have the top part of the black

not move up

the mimic chart works on cover

says that they have that's his question

with exclamation point but it is what

Flash no I'm not going to play

point

outside

that's not how to Twitch

anyway so far it goes well

and I'm happy with what I've been able

to achieve so bye

and I will post I guess some more

pictures on the

description so

take care of that it's been six hours

already happy with I always amazing

let's still post

when that was a disco only

[Music]

that's the whole thing

there you go

very protective modding session thank

you

antique got through quite a lot actually

made a lot of pregnancy yes

and

as the end of the Stream

I want

uh

it's like that

now I went

I don't like to

[Music]

create usage here for long exclusive

chats I went that's the same

because I don't want to force people to

follow with what I can chat I really

don't like that

visit

is

now they're doing a group thing

wait what yeah I was thinking I was

thinking reading water but Papa wolf

and the army

and the most archives I think Noah is

the only one who hasn't visited my

stream but the other two has been here

they are also streaming

and the question is how often do I get

to read them and how often do I get to

read

water

I think what is funny trades honestly

I mean I'm closer to what the

Institute those

he's not playing that one anyway

um what is he doing now he's just

chatting is it any streams

let me speak right back soon

[Music]

maybe that's why it's just just chatting

because it's away

wait for him to come back

with because of those other serious

Elements which are part of the strange

Planet Community they haven't started

stream yet they will do that in finding

it

we're having people probably a lot of

energy Jesus

as in lurking usage water being one of

them

so

but if I were to

something's changed no registered

I was playing it early yes

as well as 60 he doesn't love the game

or they

as I ever

[Music]

made once

and for

eign

the other option is that I made a great

job and still left with speech lift and

think yeah I kind of kind of

not I want to do a double hit that's

honestly too often about the same time

yeah

[Music]

the option would be to read

when you read what all right probably

said both are not active at the moment

so whatever it is

yeah it's funny when it goes silent

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

no it's not back is the wrong one

but he's not

I had the wrong thing even

he's not back he he will get

how long is the timer

30 seconds

come on like that come on let me come

back

come back with the

because when I really Lolly there it was

like just before she was back

yeah

yeah

[Music]

oh he's back he's back

right right

[Music]
