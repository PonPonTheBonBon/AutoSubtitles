Towers that also makes things more

convenient oh this does not convenient

somewhat out

of out of

ammo

[Music]

so

chess how do you say hello in

finish the name of

you mean

Housey polish D

mean hey hello Jay welcome

[Music]

doing

some War here piing and speaking out

finish fin on for

[Music]

War mostly about guess defending themsel

against War not much doing

War rele

me oh took a lot of damage

[Music]

there yeah this isn't going too great

but it is

going

beautiful destroying the their

wall their wall are going

down the walls are going

down a when you're toasting around you

say now D to your house War it's

actually impressively lot of doing

nothing I would assume so

is this more is me going back and forth

[Music]

constantly and missing my

[Music]

shots

[Music]

okay okay I got a few shots into

those there we go finally no let me out

of here no don't destroy my

helicopter well I finally destroyed that

building I call that as

this so we continue towards the next

building I got a shot

[Music]

T no

no I miss

building no I'm deep inside the enemy

base now

okay this helicopter is about to

die I need to take it

[Music]

home where's

home we lost home this helicopter is

about to

die

oh there one

well oh well that was that

helicopter my P was the one between

Canada and it was some random Rock in

Atlant was that considered a war or more

of a

disagreement is that helicopter still

there

[Music]

I mean I know I know War are

disagreement but

[Music]

like this think there's a slight

difference between

actually killing each other and

just saying this this stuff is

mine I don't I don't

think I mean they I don't think they had

the declared war between each other so

there wasn't like a formal war between

Canada and

Mark I mean normally you you could have

logistic people doing that

and of

yeah after flag plant Canadian flag

and can flag

flag I that one a few years

ago Australian em war is the more

lovable one yeah at least that one was

like a

war with combat and I've se but I don't

think that comes as a war

either CU it again it was not a formal

War it was never

declaration of war of both

sides since one side could could not

consent to a

war I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm pey but like

if one side just attacks the other side

un prompted I don't think that's a

war I think that's a

un prompted

attack whoa

flag I don't know maybe they

somewhere how am I supposed to get up

there it's I War they sent there

military Flags milit operation between

oppon cling cont is more is it

though shoot to the

tree military oper you were very way

with that so military operations between

two kind

like like between two

countries very vague statement

there I I I mean I mean so so when what

was it I don't remember which country it

was that accidentally entered the wrong

country and then they left and made a

formal apology so they entered another

country well

illegally H was that a war or was that

just

accident I think people are bit too

eager to call this war

Theos is not speak of those Wars mostly

because the EM Overlord don't

permit it is a war it's legal War wait

what was legal

War 100,000 Kines

congratulations

now you have carrot coins you can

use or whatever you

want it was

not it was not military operation

again we talking about swis

lonstein Lin

lonstein we

go H I don't know if that was the one I

was talking

about we' to it twice yeah it happened

twice

even out of

ammo well with our declaration is

technically legal War as I

understood yeah but but but my question

is basically if

you if you do if you do something

against another country using the

military but the other country isn't

there and like you have no casualties

you have

no I don't know it doesn't feel like a

war I don't

know especially since I don't think

Denmark or Canada had declared an

official war between

them don't think you can call it a

war when they weren't even at

War I'm sure they weren't at

War what the I maybe maybe Denmark and

Canada an official

War well I mean as I said illegal War

but I mean did Canada and Denmark have

an illegal war against each

other I don't know

I can't say you wrong that you shooting

your wrong

building you're destroying my

vle so much for filling up the tank and

then I lost

it as per Geneva Convention yes doesn't

mean countries always will declare

though

okay has like start a special operation

Co well there was the Cold war between

years and Russia during the 80s even

though it was a war no military action

took place by the side at least nothing

over but a lot of c c Ops though but did

they declare

war was there an official declaration of

war between Russia and United

States I think Bo was declared yeah

assuming it was in that case it seems

that it is a war when they declare war

it is not war when they do military

operations I don't

know seems to be that seems to be the

case I know I'm picky but I mean I argue

someone else is picky when they consider

it a I don't

know I don't

know

I'm doing war against the

greens cuz we declared official War I

assume I mean they built up a military

base and everything

clearly it's

war that was the flag building that

doesn't cost me

threat these things

do shoot the tower not the

wall

no it's an easier map than the previous

one I well us it also a lot of these

mercenaries in Africa I think but aside

from that n side was willing to take

direct action against no might does make

sense at the same time it seems like a

lot of war is done on foreign lands not

against the T the the countries like

when they're fighting against Russia

that's the Russian Ukraine war they're

fighting against Russia in Ukraine or

something like that not on Russian

land I could be wrong he correct me if

I'm wrong

yeah the proxy BS but fun to be wait

what

peaceful peaceful yes I am

peaceful I am a very peaceful tank thing

let's remove this building in a peaceful

matter someone died I mean someone fell

over with their red paint bucket they

did not suffer from

any

death building is in the way I can't

shoot go can with that

Tower this Tower and it should be safe

soon there's one more Tower up

here there we

go let's destroy that thing as well it

should be safe enough for a Jeep to go

in here I think mean there's a tower up

here and a tower

here oh thank you for removing the tree

I was stuck at it again I getting stuck

at trees

this things should be strong enough to

just crush the trees there's a building

in way sorry about

that there is people for remov of the

building because I didn't the there was

no

casualties everyone left the

building now I should be able to bring

up Jeep

here

oops they got in the

way way out of

munition yeah I should be able to take a

Jeep

here yeah let let's more

home peaceful at more

yes peaceful bu up peaceful tank yes

it's a tank of

friendship it's

uh it's peacefully removing non peaceful

buildings yeah the Jeep does not have a

radar the radar can for some reason see

the tank T you can see the um

flag I wonder what the flag

has drove into

stone this game well has the same issue

as CR banic could have when you drive

into something and get stuck you still

have momentum forward but the vehicle

isn't moving so if you want to move back

you have to break remove all that

momentum

forward before you can actually start

moving

[Music]

backwards so if that sing is removed

while you still have your mum forward

you just start moving forward

again and

weird friendship tank friend tank yes it

is it's a friend tank why do I still use

[Music]

that removing vegetation with hand

grenades that's what peaceful people do

[Music]

okay and removing

walls with gang grates thank

you I it didn't not take too

long less than 30 minutes is the same

video it's the same

video same video as

p o n Jeep th they call it Jeep th but I

really thought it was some special Jeep

map 25 minutes 48

seconds enormous Camp I'm really curious

what this

is it looks very interesting and I'm far

in the South as

usual oh oh that's what it

is oh

my

oh

my

well fair enough don't know if try but

since fin

thought uh on the same side against USSR

with the Germans

in what

AG I guess there are moments like

that

moments like

that no don't shoot

me don't throw hanger at

me just going to peacefully remove hey

this piece of road does not have a

square that marks the end of it like it

just

ends that's not how it should look be

shy they should have an end piece maybe

they don't have

one maybe that's just how

they do

it so what was my

plan I think my plan was to just get

through

here I don't think I have a

plan what is the battle plan

nothing just get rid of the

towers gu this is

an enormous Camp okay I sustain a lot of

damage let's move back home and look at

the

map and get a better idea of what to

do collecting

Rubble today I consider myself the luest

man in the world

why I mean that was the first me it

wasn't that me

here there we go sorry I shot my

w okay so I removed those Towers but I

basically need

to

remove some of the more there okay I

see there is a con part of Poland though

and yes we call it

cont

more yeah but Poland still had a

government in ex time in Britain I

believe let's do some re research on

War I could do like yeah there's

like more

game European univers or something like

that

yeah

like can also do like uh cations but not

fly my favorite type of game Europe is

probably not my type of game

I could play like

Risk we go should be able to enter Jeep

here oh come on squish the

tent this should be enough one more okay

one more we

go be peaceful in your T I'm not going

to attack

you those buildings looks like parts of

a

motherboard whoops I could do not

consider my

house it's important so I removed the

towers on that one I basically need to

remove them on the second

wall and then I should be able to get

get through with the

Jeep

I should just make sure I don't lose a

tank boom look at

that look at my Precision sh down the

trees with

rockets what kind of rockets are these

blue tipped

Rockets didn't that squish

these

there we

go moving

along there is clip oops I destroyed the

wall sorry I didn't mean

to didn't mean

to

okay do like this one so I'll try to

keep

it

then I need to remove

these cuz these are trying to shoot

me and these

two

F oh no I'm

dead there was too way too many Towers

okay I need to be I need to be more

careful I can't continue like this I'm

not going to get through the enormous C

I continue like

this I'm losing my heavy

Vehicles can may we build a bridge

here making traversing this a bit

quicker

secure in the area and then you build a

bridge

let's let's do

some more care and ATT

you there we

go

perfect oh I should done the

one

go should hopefully be safe

enough no that thing is still trying to

shoot me

stop with that and you stop

too I don't like

you but hopefully you don't try to shoot

me want a Jeep

which

is what's more important don't you be

deep oh

no sustaining too much damage move out

don't shoot the

bridge

I make open it up here I can go

through open up so I can get through

there we go

clean and then a lot of

problems happen because

no one

oops put done

it listen to General pan when her

pushing toward

Moscow there was the whole East Germany

thing as well as the uses are being

allowed no

time

there we go the holy Germany seeing as

well as the users are being allowed to

spread their influence of Poland and

Slovakia

Etc okay so I need to remove that I

me and Russia really side with the

Allies if we being honest Russia was on

Russia side not AIS or

yeah that's what caned

that Russia side with deci side that

benefited them at the

time Italy the same Italy was kind of

maybe not

like a big thing like Russia

though Russia had a bit

more

military we

go oh

really okay there we go what happen

now can't come here and destroy

potentially destroy my

Jeep we

go it's like you might destroy my

Jeep

okay okay I need to move

out oh no there are more Towers here

oops

let's count on that okay I need to get

back to

safety guys I've sustained too much

damage

already B too agressive there yeah so

Jeep should take this way we some more

oh I want

more can take a shortcut through here

maybe something

something Prett sure the je can just

take a shortcut across the whole

ocean no I really I want the bridge

there I can take a shortcut across don't

have to go around

this yeah can we build like

a gate on the Northern side of the wall

and then just build across there that

would be nice the towers are removed you

can

build you can build a bridge in safety

okay with so many Towers remov now this

Al going to be a map doesn't is this an

enormous Camp

sorry

enough

don't s grenades at

me go now can through

easier because that was count it should

be easy to get

through no other

reason oh trying to shoot me well I can

shoot you

[ __ ]

this well I can shoot a building no

apparently

not I can shoot you through

that so that area

cleared then I should just clear up this

one

mine oh I shouldn't move South

anyway I don't really have to remove

this they aren really shooting at me

but I mean they shooting at me now I

guess but not want to move up

here as long as I keep moving this

should work

don't like I closed that Min

KN okay you

what don't like you stupid fa it

anyway and don't like how you're

shooting at

me well I mean who who does oh no I'm

out of

ammo okay let's move this

mine come on that was close

enough the the detonation area seems to

be different for every m

so I don't

know course I can't remove that

meing helicopter

but that work

too my friend is funny that enemy

soldiers only appear if you destroy

building that they

occupy hey what's this noise a tank

attack in the B should we you know do

something about it nah he not attacking

or bu we won't do

anything yeah but but it's not

like all they are equipped with is hand

grenades and they will attack you with

hand grenades as

a effect effect but if you destroy the

building they will escape before you hit

them with the last

shot they will uh just

um they should bring in a tank H they

will uh run away they are not they're

not going after you

just run away run run

away speed run in the in the return

fire uh Sports bir timer is long over

there oh you want the

translation streams oh yeah that will

distract the

opponents P Pon is so cute okay I can

translate

that wait where is it there it

is p

p

to time while and

drive which you should preferably not do

but s set there you go fun fun s set

letroy these

things is a lot of

towers okay I'll I'll move I'll

move over here okay this tank is

dead no it has like one shot left on it

something so sad no so

sad P pun ass what

sad I knew that one

that's what I heard no funun is not

sad not at the moment funun has been

really sad

before that's not now Swedish use those

letters

too or that's a sentence that contains

all all three uh extended letters of the

Swedish

alphabet but yes it's one of those

Scandinavian

Germanic there's a lot of languages that

uses the circle with the two dots

above even Turkish languages used

it which in German is called

uml it's when the do have the roundness

from or but but the uh the front value

of

a a so you get uh

instead which is used in Germanic and

Turkish languages but it is also used in

some other

languages where it instead used to Mark

the vowel as a separate pronounce

separately and

not so it's not a deep stone or

something

no

well that was a mistake no I don't want

the exit by je

yet well that was a

mistake the hard D I seen Bridge well I

guess I'll just have to use the TX now

oh

volume oh yeah yeah yeah have to check

there we go

hydrate

[Music]

there go now my

ha so now have

straight it still looks special wait one

look

special

I

guess I guess I guess

so

well no I'm moving

away but I moved into another part of

the

base okay well don't fun to watch it

again never already done that

once okay

back to

base oh

no now it tells me about an upcoming

end

again it's very spoty on if it does

that let's make it easier to get through

here CU I don't want

to as I'm trying to escape with the Jeep

get stuck on

this

stuff that would be so

unfortunate back to base don't confuse

base with Bice yeah there's a bit

difference mization base

spice how would you spell spell Bas if

you use a Swedish

orography not the same thing do you do

not want to go to

buys but sometimes you'd want to do go

and do that thing in the verb

form if you know how to write there

infinitive verb form of that for that

noun which is pretty

easy go take a

b why would you go and take a one why do

you need it

for I think you should put it back back

where you got it

from this is

the PE of

B well in Swedish we wouldn't say peace

of

B I think everyone knows what about

B when this seems sure seems to be a fun

of

it

immature

humor wait time or sustain so much

damage

H can I snipe it from here

that's

raining okay okay just had to destroy a

few pieces of WS

first could

like okay this isn't going as

planned

yeah

hand in college is

how

C I want to this tree because I feel

like

it

a Polish person doesn't speak English

but to know the English word for that

big animal

and and an English person says

cow and the Polish person is

[Music]

confused I thought thought if he want

the vulgar just just has to

there and

hiden in English is go

goor

Governor I am the

governor why can you write out those all

those forign words but you can't can't

right forign they're not foreign V is

not

foreign non ha can WR those non English

words out full but you don't write out

the English

[Music]

word yeah definitely your type of

image okay anyway I cleared up this area

I'm clearing out this area well we

already cleared out this

area I'm currently clearing out the are

above which is should be the third area

I

think

so so the last area is

um where all the buildings are

today I should be maybe I can take

cheaper on here

but

what

right I'm a bit confused where I'm

supposed to

go wait am I supposed to no wait

what

H time to

hit I

know I'm

hiding

there

you

okay don't think I need to go further

north would be fine

I do want to get rid of that

building

well there that there's a tower

here and a tower here

oh oh and I'm not really gotten got

gotten got CH speak I have not

really I guess found any places that

where I can fill up the fuel or munition

around this area except in like in the

first area that's that's the place I

found but that is so close to my own

base so I can just move

home but the question is fuel if if if I

have enough fuel for that can I get back

I should probably get back I need to

find another place I can fill the fu

at

it sure is running

low that should be

[Music]

enough CU I'm basically home right now I

can just go back andair the tank and

check the map and see what's going on

cuz I'm got a little

confused okay what's going

on okay

so oh yeah there's one more area wait

there's a building with a flag in there

too is

see

so the question is if there's any place

I can fill up the tank or fuel or

something in the big square at the top

right wait I should I

should I got a

plan I'll use a helicopter and scan

area

good plan

yes thank

you y

missed I don't like

you shaoting me okay there

are nothing

to wait there's there's a tank there

good good good

good

but it's just

that

which I can access from there but can I

get more munition

somewhere they should at least weaken

them okay doesn't seem to be that which

can be quite annoying

I can build a tank but I cannot F

my

munition I can feel the tank with liquid

I cannot fill the tank with

solid

but I can't feel the tank with gas as in

air so you can

breathe

so so yeah it's in

here can't fill up the

tank

yeah there it

[Music]

comes but no munition doesn't

[Music]

annoying go go

go no don't shoot it

Kate oh that someone missed

me glad for

it no it hit

me

oh he's trying to break down the

wall no I didn't mean to she building

there's a tank outside building they're

hiding in the building it does not

contain the flag but a surprise no one

is at least no one has been watching

this

game for a while should not be surprised

want out of

munition so

well just to get of that I guess yeah I

really need a place to fill up more cuz

I can't can't keep going back and

forth no flag shocking yeah

this one place in there but

we're so close to

home like relatively up

course in that case I just go all the

way home and just repair the

[Music]

tank so I just need to clear out like

up not too far from that

place I

see 3 minutes 40 seconds to head wait

why are that so

late they should play before oh yeah

yeah because twitch decided to change

the settings for ads they decided there

should be a minute of AD every 20

minutes which guess a minute of ad is

short like 3 minutes like it's start of

time you get this three times often it

just gets more annoying for me like this

head now I have to say I don't have to

say it but like prefer saying it like

every every 20

minutes

um

the bot should really have a AO

automatic message it can send out when

ads are playing cuz it should detect

that ads are

playing

okay

boink I'm not driving that good okay

let's not comment on mind

driving who who

who we clear I know oh clear line of

side with this one I did not do this

efficiently tanks stuff take so much

damage

so

Qui I CLE out

these wait didn't just shoot at me why

AR it facing at me if he shot me was it

oh

no that was

close

yeah basically almost cleared off this

area so there's only the last area

left let's get rid of this

wall there you go oops I shot my tent

where they still in the tents at this

point I would not be like like to be in

those tents

anymore should be

enough I think I think the best part is

when you do this actually this as a form

of demonstration you you place you just

place the tank here and then you shoot

the building and then they walk out into

the tank and

die I actually want

survived you get to survive all your

friends are

dead they got squished by a part tank

that's

how

yep oh the swimsuit timer is also

up no more swim suit have

suit they wanted the pet tank yeah but

how how how did they get squished that

doesn't make any

sense that makes no sense at

all

what Pon squish you want to squish pon

pon don't have a piece I'm still

annoying by that land is ending I really

thought they had a piece that was meant

to Mark us through ending but maybe they

don't have one that seems like an

oversight

yeah the one one minute that for some

reason so I cleared out that area in

that so I just need to remove that Tower

and probably some of those Towers should

have be able to do that with the

helicopter

yeah I should I should add that to the

list of reasons why why you should get a

Pon P plushy you get the squish the

plushy they drown the D they drive

too

no let me get

through

go and then I basically have to oh no

I'm not doing so great at the moment no

no I missed the

tower

well let me do it again but no less F

made it round in Driver 2 you could find

a Stationary train and now walking into

it kill the character provide message

you

drown

what drive it too H in

not that's probably enough oh

San I would suspect that's an hour

sight what an Easter

egg but where we ising that case

it may be even bad taste if e days about

dying I don't

[Music]

know yeah I don't have to take care of

those there you go I'm I'd say that was

a

success

well

[Music]

okay I guess I don't really need the

helicopter

anymore no no don't squish the P do you

squish the P She Likes to be squished in

certain ways like carpet bombing on the

rest squish pwn into a swimsuit well I

do want to include the swimsuit

so wa you wait do you want to squish Pon

into the shape of a swimsuit and then

wear pon

pon y she was an an actual swim

suit that's sounds like a

[Music]

fetish oh no oh no sorry

sorry came to the wrong meeting

[Music]

I think it went the wrong

way now p is much nicer the Ser P again

wrong

[Music]

party well I'm happy I think I think so

okay I completely went the wrong way

where what did I yeah I went to the

wrong Island that explains it you go

straight up and then I should

okay

connection go go go go don't go the

wrong way this

time okay I should go up this

road

don't shoot

me don't shoot

me don't shoot me even though I'm

shooting you but you

know I'm allowed to do that

okay no no

no

yeah I made some bad decisions there I

got really

one oh well I guess I just have to with

the tank

then F Pon P yeah that's my

reaction the helicopter is a bit too

weak and again stand I'm really not good

with

it

[Music]

I wish was a shortcut and have to go

around the whole

thing all

and I should not enter that

area should go around this way probably

safe to enter area anyway

but then I'll just land this one a

bit

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

through here I wish I could run over

that but for some reason that's the only

type of building I know of in this game

that you cannot run over despite

shooting it down

completely

okay let's soften this

up I should probably G in here and

should some of this before I went the

helicopter or

something a crazy

idea don't like that

mine

okay oh no no why are you shooting at

me shooting at me no I'm almost

dead well I guess I have to move back

then get rid of that it's easy to turn

around very exciting music for going

[Music]

home is there I need to

take context into

[Music]

mind

[Music]

well I mean I was partly successful with

that I

think this that go all the way back

home it's not as long as the other level

but there are more Towers I don't know

kind of equals out I feel like yeah I

kind of cleared out the front there so I

basically need to go

around clear out all the towers and then

I can clear out the towers

inside how many more rounds do I need I

don't

know but we'll

see I think I cleared two

levels in this today

so I'm working on the third one and I'm

very close to the end of the third one

[Music]

[Music]

I

forgot build

[Music]

[Music]

thing forgot about

that looks like he shot in front of me

so I didn't get hit all right how's the

gaming going hello haris it's going a

bit slow these Maps require me to tr

Traverse the whole

map and

so hey hey P hello hello y hope things

are going all right with

you moving around there a

tank pon pon playing is a friendly

tank

okay how should I do

this sneaking sneaking around as a tank

here no don't shoot

me I'm a I'm a sneaky

tank

go can't that oh what you shooting me

are you my in me or

something than

kill oh another

one

oh okay I come

far no I'm

dying

I'm shooting

something who I'm shooting one oh

no okay time time to

leave it

time to

leave made them very

angry M supposed to

do Navigator around there

hello people hi yes we got some people

now now it's not just Arian and and

andto got

some some actual some people who aren't

here as often well haris has been

here

occasionally yeah thanks are know for

being quiet and

sneaky yeah don't you hate it when a

tanky sneaks up on

you B P be a hot

K I guess she's hot and that swim

suit I guess she's wearing the swimsuit

because it's

hot

move

[Music]

the game

[Music]

safe maybe they don't care about

that

A's tanks are apparently surprising

Abraham TS I

suppose yeah happens in the while all

the time on way home and then boom tank

sneak attack I mean

Y game known needs to be so

dramatic game is very dramatic

sometimes it would be something yeah

that's what I meant with the music speed

the dynamic it needs to increase the D

dramatic level when

you as you move into the enimy base this

has been en base but it's quite

destroyed should this this should be

considered a safe

area really the only thing it should

consider is dangerous are the towers

because that's basically what I'm

fighting the USA MBT

what the tank is

having

what the tank is having a brad by

episode music Beach

episode I was wondering what kind of

tank bras you're talking about I know

howed like that

main battle tank

okay do you want the tank

BR the only thing I can think of is like

a tank to

BR which against pon pon kind of

[Music]

hand so C out the sou part so maybe I

should be sneaking clear out oh that one

is already taking care

of oh no it's my my shield is

gone why am I so bad at hitting

that there we

go no it shot me no my shield is

gone aha

that's okay well I'm open open out in

the

open no not

you we invited

you I've got to tank tank the tank

again

thing

oh you're still here you're still

here I think this D some of

them okay I'm basically out of munition

and fuel

so

so I need to go back home

anyway can I get through

here

yes yes yeah I know the tank is

empty of course the problem

is

because I'm out

of have save

this

okay no no it's

coming it's

coming

[Music]

no no I'm out okay this is going to be a

problem

I should really not be on the bach with

this after

me oh no it's

coming I clear the bridge at least stop

shooting

[Music]

me can't shoot me I'm underneath you

H mition over here come on come on come

on hurry

hurry no oh no this isn't

good wait did I shoot it

down wow I did actually do that amazing

[Music]

I guess dramatic music was

relevant that was that was quite

dramatic but I did it I man to shot it

down I much I went to the okay now it's

starting music it doesn't dramatic

anymore the drama is

over I did it raw you want that raw

command sorry sorry I've been ignoring

comments but that that was an intense

moment I couldn't I couldn't stop end up

get the

comments

All In guess the tank needs a be if it's

on a beach or you want like a tank on a

beach

with

uh that sounds

funny oh god I've been looking for this

game here it

is so you know this

game I hope I hope it's funny it's quite

interesting

pon pon random question what game game

class does pon pon likes what what do

you mean like like yeah game genre but

in that case it would be platforming

games I

guess thing I guess it did go away

somehow I think I shut it

down H did you shoot it down yeah I

think so ters can be hot but do you want

like a anthropomorphic tanker or

something or should it really look like

a tank but with like added some added

features to make it

feminine like in Cars Disney cars

with with with very very very slight

Anor

anism that's the we

now tank with a bikini would that be a

tankini

yes RPG so yeah it's a b game genre or

do you mean oh no no you mean what what

class character I would play as in an

RPG I don't play RPG so I don't really

have a

preference honestly there are more like

added features yeah yeah I've

seen I've seen some of

the some of that artwork is B human with

added

Fe this is

fine well I hope this is fine I forgot

to tank tank

[Music]

again oops I didn't mean to move forward

that was a

mistake the wrong

button hard to control tank PR wrong

nothing I know I'm very aggressive at

the

moment attack is dead no it's

survived and there are all the buildings

I still need to go back and get back

with the tank once more so

so I will not touch the building

yet that's

soon now get out the way get shot

at I remember an old game from N64 Mar

called rocket robot on wings well I

guess you should suggest it on the

server so I can see it off the stream

cuz I would like forgot about the what's

been written in chat here and

then here we go it

exploded that's that's one a platform

this sounds interesting it really

depends what kind of platform it is but

I'm have for trying different platforms

I never I never could be to final

level what's

harder space Speedway or that final

level especially Speedway through like

Platformers

so that's that's a reason okay oh the

fin is definitely winable

okay I like spous speed which is

definitely not weable even though some

people have done

that but they're probably

cheating I should do a stream one day

just the spous speedway stream I'll play

through the level until I beat

it

so I got a five Towers left

only and then the area is safe that's no

problem I even tried cheating with like

same States but not even with that I

could beat

L cheating or they got really really

really lucky I don't even see like how

you would get lucky in that I mean it's

random but but it doesn't seem to be

like a certain random sequence of event

that would make it

easier okay okay

okay so much going

on I guess lucky and that you happened

to be in the right position or

accidentally shot a lot of the correct

ones and

maybe yeah they did not make that a

good

but I'm definitely up for a remake of

The Game Boy advanced SP games with like

modern 3D better view use the right

stick to move the camera use the left

stick to move around or something move

around and you can look around freely As

you move at the same time you don't have

to hold down a button and use the

movement to look around I should fil

first which would make that easier and

also maybe click the right stick to zoom

out you

can't so everything you can see when

move around is all in view but

everything zoomed out in

that but on a modern high definition

screen you're still getting more pixel

zoomed out fully then you get an

assuming Game Boy view

anyway and then then they just need to

do some slight tweaks to make the game

better

like on a on a Speedways maybe give you

like a bit more time to do I mean that

would be

nice that's only need just a bit more

time and doable maybe have like less

Health some

bues oh what is missing un

affected

oh I'm sneezing when I'm in the

tank no I need

destroyed no I destroy the one there we

go

Viper thank you for booped I feel

booped thank you

for the

subscription okay let's see where is the

pl

then is it this

one Sho is this

one how many do I need 1 2 three 4 five

six six that's an OD

number

tree hopefully it's one

of there it

is oh out of

ammo I would say there's definitely H

some function because one would assume

that assume H if because the flag is not

predetermine where the location is just

looking at random odds of which building

contains it always one of the later ones

and if I destroy them at random that

shouldn't appear so late every single

time can I even replace some levels for

it wait I'm going the wrong

way uh and always in the last

one so this seems to be a

function because you when you do like a

random chance

of what's the odds for it to be in this

building you do like you take one

divided by the number of buildings there

are and then you randomize a number

between zero and

one and then if the number you

randomized is smaller then smaller equal

to and the one divides number of

buildings

uh you should spawn it there otherwise

you don't but somehow it feels like

they've intentionally messed up that

question maybe they have like take the

number of buildings left and double that

number or

something not doubled maybe that doesn't

work well they could like double the

number and the result minus

one

don't need more

F so if it's a single flag buildings

left you double the number which is two

and then you take minus one which is one

but if two left double it you get four

and minus one is three that means in the

two buildings you have a third the

chance of finding it when it should be

just like feeling when playing this

game cheep

time but anyway sorry for not reading

your message by I've

been

a keep

[Music]

keep hope you're having a wonderful

day and hope Chad is having a wonderful

day too I hope the Chad is g a snake

bag yay now I should get go and pick up

the

flag but the random isn't actually

random yeah tanky wanky p p to focus to

read message yep but I wouldn't call it

tank a wank it's

just T tank and made pwn oh oh my made

P yeah there

are I like

Rhymes that's an approv word I approve

of

wanks in different

context just don't be a wank

okay don't trigger the

mine there we

go the music is very calm I know okay I

need

to destroy some of the

plants we go y the flag now we're going

home after destroying these plants I

can't drive over plants without yeep I

just need to First destroy the plants

with an

[Music]

grenades they

oh another word I need to

prove approve I

said

groovy tank the tank the to the bank

call a pank and then call him a

wanker call a wank Follow by a spank

with a

plank

yeah

that please indeed

don't the B maybe not a Jeep but if I

draw like a tank full speed into a tree

I don't feel like the tree should stand

up that might just be

me I remember remember in GTA

san

I get cross

here the ingame aine is

called drank

air it doesn't mean much if you use the

English of that J but like spish think

one I realize

there wank I

guess

inent find my not

funny I'm

sorry not time can you D

Che with mean speed and depend on tank

the chees yeah that just took 1 hour and

21

minutes let me

say still at they got down in flames so

these levels are so much so crazy at the

moment

I'm up oh oh

no that wasn't the

map by my

vehicles my

vles yeah this is going to be a long

map look at this spider web of

oh you didn't

die

H thank

you not much

fun get of

you and I guess that's going to be just

going around and destroying

everything I should be able to go down

here not that I need to move up to it

but you know just be on the safe side

because I'm driven off into the water

before don't get there destroy

me

okay this vehicle is already getting

destroyed going down in flames going

down in BL a bles of Glory going down in

flames going down in a place of

Glory let's get rid of the junk can

through

here got some Towers on my

side so I need to move up I guess and

then oh my this

map this map is

something if I was better at the

helicopters I could use those just like

crushing those cuz it's fun

this is also an hour long

map well I've been going for almost 2

hours and that map took like 1 hour and

20 minutes and I've done three Maps so

far so the other two maps were really

quick in

comparison oh here they

are

didn't even consider our close

hours oh you did not get

destroyed someone trying to break

through well that's destroy that

se then I can destroy you apparently not

because I have plants protecting you

there's a m

there

so

okay I need what's the point of the base

towards South there I don't think they

have anything they just there to annoy

me my St we shall see they are coming

now they're after

me they want blood yes that's true going

quietly I just don't going down in

flames going down place of Glory but I

don't know that song I mean kind of

recognize it but it's not like I

remember so let's see yeah there's

nothing South and I don't think I need

to can go anywhere with that base I'm

not sure exactly what the point

is but if if I continue on the outside

there I can I can reach

the could reach a flag building is to

destroy

it

obviously should rather not destroyed

you know increasing the chance for FL to

be there that's how game work so I can

travel shorter with

Jeep maybe I should leave that

behind but since I came up that plan now

you heard it I I

mean yeah but I just don't remember

like I don't have a Ty of memories I can

hear song once and then I can replicate

it I know they're crazy crazy

stop shooting

me oh get out of the way stupid

tree phog graphic memory but for

music a recorder like

memory

Al when it comes to using

record recording like memory tape like

record memory that isit bit

older well you've heard it before that's

probably why it sounds familiar if you

don't

it

music like it's nice to be able to fill

up with munition but I mean it's not far

from where I have my base as usual sure

love placing those close to my

base doesn't help me

much

so okay now I can look at the map so I

basically got up there I'll continue so

I can reach those

bridges well I got a

plan those bushes here

looks

veryable and that one

too

so I need to take the bridge I can't

just go over the

water there not

works strong Bridge

easy to destroy that's why I don't want

the towers to destroy

it

so yeah going toore

those it's not that one not missing

that's what I'm not going to

ignore

no just sorry I need

to I no get out of

here annoying flying

thing can you stop shooting me

oh that's

nice I can shoot these without entering

the

bridge that's

convenient

I guess we

have

oh not going to D we

out here it comes

again stop shooting

me out of ammo kind of I got one even

though it shows three I should only have

one shot

left

so oh yeah know

El so made some good

progress let move this

mine there we

go no no not again there we go that was

the last

shot the number of missiles you see on

it does not align with

a the SP over the

hydrate and swim

it the number of missiles you have in

total when you started

vehicle almost every m is empty there

not he not divisible by

three so I'm destroy one part on the

bridge

there

so not the bridge though

but I'm doing good progress but this is

going to take away this should be the

last one for this world we'll see what

the next world has in

store more tedious level look like two

hours to complete last probably going to

have levels that takes like 3 hours to

complete each how to have one stream per

level or

something is that what the future in

store for

me looking at chat there there's several

long messages

recently oh no I spent too much I fell

down to 9

996 oh no what will you

do can you wait 5

minutes that's not one I want to

destroy we

go

so wait didn't I destroy you I

cannot let's clear off this

area oh no now I was running out of

ammunition

munition if you

want

bro I'm bankrupting carrot

coins

understand don't Sho the

bridge you

sing

yeah shoot me not the

bridge try to turn around

here taking lot of damage okay so now

they made progress

here let shoot that tream

please

I

will check back on the map and see what

I should do when I go down the bridge

and go also go back and repair the

tank I'm saing for investment oh what

are you going to invest with your carrot

coins where's my V needed now more than

ever

do you want to buy one with C

coins I probably need to fill the

tank when I get all the way over

there by what can yes we found

right now one thing I would like switch

to do is basically have a total number

of points you have spend no not spent

total am of points you have have ever

had because there are some streamers who

have like so if I go down there I should

find

out have like very high expensive Point

amounts so you can get like VIP or

something like that I just encourage

people to just save up and not use their

points which isn't like

fun that's why I don't have anything

super expensive plus I couldn't really

add something that's worth it I mean at

least let me expand my stream first I

need a new computer

so so I was thinking what if

instead you have the total amount of

points you have ever

had these points do not you cannot pay

with these points so every time you

get CH regular Chan points you get

points in these two because the same

amount it's just the the total amount of

points

yeah and with this number reaches a

certain number you

can well I was going to say like kind of

like redeeming but you're not spending

the

points if you have achieved 100,000

points you get some reward or

something

no no get this

SEC but you don't have

to take the W I can choose not to redeem

it oh thank you are you on my

side

okay okay going destroy

that I'm destroying everything at

okay there are places here we

can okay but I do want to repair my

vehicle

first

cuz it is sustaining a lot of okay got

okay one shot

left oh happy day oh I'm back

2,68 care coins I'm saved happy

dance oh happy

dance

but so if I clear out that area I can

use I can f out up with

more

um Fuel and mini but VIP FR shiny

icon VIP whatever it that I don't want

to someone to spend like 100,000 points

on a VIP I don't like that

I am still like I'm still up for the

idea of having like how much points you

have ever had

like commun like all the points you

currently have plus all the points you

have ever spent the total

amount so yeah so clear out that and

then

I

then I can fill up stuff there not time

to go back to base problem is there's no

repairs so if they have the repair

place that would be

something spaghetti for pon pon makes

pon pon

happy yeah give me some

spaghetti

I like spaghetti sure a lot of noise

outside I'm moving up to the

bridge rest of

the

anyway up to the

bridge

oh there we have

you and

you oh no it didn't get destroyed

get

destroyed oh

no we got this thing

again no there we

go oh another

one sure happy with this

now come

on Boom how about

that

so how is this place

looking much

better oh no it's shoting at

me I can't accept

that oh no another one oh no that's a

plane

oh

no okay there we

go

no don't shoot

me oh it can't shoot me because I'm

behind the

building oh no I'm

stuck tck on some

plants

but no I destroyed the

wall okay no

problem okay I need to get out of

here I take

shortcuts like that

mine

okay I got far I

think

tot

shortcut had almost over

anyway oh people are surviving

that so long

bit sweet base can we move the

base

so

yeah so basically now I have to move

down and over to the next place how am I

supposed to oh I see I see so I move

down and then clear out those four

building see if I can do that in one run

probely

not but at least I have fuel and

munition over there so I can at least f

up you still have three yeah I started

with three helicopters and I'm not used

them

yet if I used them is going to get

destroyed I can do that if I like clear

out an area and got a few turs Towers

left and I I can probably go in there

and destroy them but then when there's

like 20 of them there the helicopter is

going to get

destroyed so because I'm driving it

soone could probably do par

me

started with three helicopters three

Jeeps but only

one of the two

different tanks thank

thanks this is close the bridge but that

one is the one with the

mine

that to half the

tank no I missed it I missed it again

boom there we

go oh never we got it Tower oops missing

Tower there we

go

now moving

down oh did I miss

it um hope missing everything

now okay now I'm moving in too

quickly

that it's so [ __ ]

me go no

there we go now I hit the one hit the

tra the one thing that shoot

me

okay

no I'm backing

off I don't want to deal with that

anymore oh want turn left one mines

everywhere I can probably use the

helicopter to remove those

mines mines everywhere excuse me people

I need to go through

here

yeah I was too interested there that's

not how I can do it there way to lose a

tank more evil Towers I can't imagine

the eye of sa over those

Towers be right back

okay

so Sly

like moving with the helicopter remove

some mines I'm going to starting get

annoyed by these mines

now let's do

that

[Music]

so let's start with the helicopter and

remove some

mines mines that are

irritating and I'm scared of running

into

them although if I remove the mines then

I might be too

careless

I'm not going to get hit by this

mine hey why there we

go oh

no so

fire there's the m

[Music]

stop shooting

me very bad helicopter

[Music]

control

so yeah appar can't shoot to

mines

go mine up

here sorry people in the building but I

see a fall for planting a mine up inside

the building but you

safe there we

[Music]

go you were probably not the ones who

planted the mine outside the building

but but you get to

[Music]

T can't blame the

Godless

but maybe it shouldn't be in a building

with a mine outside maybe they didn't

even know it was planted there that

seems like easier okay so

far okay so now I need to infiltrate

with this

tank got rid of Plenty Of Mines so now

it should be

safer and I just need to infate with

this tank

and

then can I we'll see if there's a flag

in the

building Al I shouldn't

technically Tech I should always start

at the building furthest

away and then work myself closer and

closer but I don't think it matters how

far deep needs to travel in

TOT don't more

matters Al long far in I need to go to

destroy

powers

can I reach from

here Maybe

not

maybe

go beat safer approach still taking

damage though

but no not went over

there

so I think

then after to this place I should move

west assuming North is

up of course I just assum nor up nor

like

there hello welcome

back

should have stuck up should I still come

back I don't

know I don't

know oh look it's safe to go through

here

I'm destroing everything

here excuse me when I use

this and also

this

h

nothing had they attack me enough with

those flying

things I do appreciate they not

coming it would be nice if they know

consider me taking over the part didn't

care about it

[Music]

anymore

which usually say before

but I wasn't expecting you to say

ATT

yeah I think you can see something like

they

like oh now it comes excuse me you're

going to destroy my tank you know

that so I guess I just have to move home

then that was that was

dangerous maybe maybe I should move in

with the helicopter maybe I can do that

maybe I cleared up enough for

that whoops I destroy a tank with my

than uh nice and

clean I guess I keep these prevents me

from running off the

bridge two P punch sh

leaders and an encouraging Fair of P

very encouraging as sitting there

staring judging

silently destroy the fuel tank with a

peaceful tank yes

I'm the

peacekeepers

caning

h no it didn't mean

[ __ ]

so yeah might be able to enter with the

helicopter now at least from the North

like have

to work myself down piece by

piece let's do some target practice I

think let's is some target practice

there we go that's should do

it now let's see if I

can D here

to go that's

one no let me shoot you

okay

[Music]

yeah I mean I should be able

to the building at

least no I'm up I leave I

[Music]

leave

I'm destroying

everything yeah I'm moving out I'm

moving

out there we go there some sucessful

Target and

land I'm I'm sor I'm sorry H

yep I'm sorry for my behavior I will do

it

again I mean it doesn't work but problem

is the helicopter is a weak so have to

move back and forth back and

forth here I

come

oh I missed

it I see

on boom I missing again boom I missed it

again P pun I want do it again but she

did do it

again what a

[Music]

liar

oh destroy

B come on Sho

it okay let's see that's too

[Music]

many what the one that CH Me From Here

There It Is destroy it okay

I'm going the wrong

way who that's

Dodge okay can

I here we

go Tak

SP

well

whatever there's

counting not sure what to

[Music]

[Music]

count not even a

flag yeah I didn't suspect it to be a

flag so I do have an option that I just

move

to and because I got those places like I

could move South there's so many Towers

there but I don't want to go around

everything can I check if there's some

kind of Water Bridge across

there Shallow Water Bridge or if I have

to around

everything guys obviously I don't want

to go around

everything nope there's no way to get

over there with a

tank okay okay okay I'm moving out I'm

moving

[Music]

out okay so now I know

that

[Music]

wait how am I supposed to get there

what's the what's the correct

path yeah it must be that that other

place with there that should be Shadow

Water

[Music]

Bridge

yeah wait too many stuff I probably have

to ENT with this

[Music]

one can we Air Lift This one

somewhere I have three helicopters they

can work to

get

[Music]

need to go around

everything around the

world I didn't never how that so good

anyway moving

on such destruction here what has

happened

so there's a tank there it's one that

contains

liquid and I was thinking that I would

use that but then I found out about more

down

here which was very

convenient

so I should go east and I cross skipping

over

water there are some Towers guarding

that

area this tower for

example I sh

did

yep and there's a door

here s's

here what a nice

Island now right

here

oh a lot of towers

there no I got

hit when

let's get of these chunks I can move

across here

easy get some and fill up the can get

some more

munition I'm running

out and one more boom empty

so this feeling of this is

quick I appreciate those flying things

are not showing you

so slightly damaged but stock

up fa Pon Pony I'm a

pony p p b oh wait here's that error how

did they end up with that

eror

can few

AR doesn't seem like should be too hard

to no this

but who am I to

join Okay

so

well oh no I didn't mean to do that oh

move out no there's a tower up there

stop shooting

me I need to take care of that s

too you are trying to shoot me you are

actually shooting

me

so I need to take care of you

too

so spwh no flag there

actually where am I supposed to go

now

so I'm do

the okay I need to

H it's fire should I go maybe I

should

three so maybe I should go back and

repair the tank and check where I should

go

error what's the

error Oh you mean oh yes there's an

there look at this look at this

Square every piece of land that meets

the sea has this light outline but

that's that square not supposed to be

there

so gu I can defend

myself just ensure that I have enough to

get home

[Music]

okay I didn't know which part of song it

was

something

destroying

everything so I've take the few of those

now

I mean at this point I could probably

just use the helicopter and just crash

into those buildings to figure out which

it

is okay so yes I've got got into that

place you're like if I'm very careful

and attack like the nearest

one and I attack the

towers oh you're facing me

already no I'm

shooting I'm missing

it

here we

go this doesn't work yeah

board okay I

mean it works I just need to be very

careful Le there a roof line thing there

is but it just doesn't show up sometimes

oh

just this yeah but it seems to show

quite R now don't exactly sure

why haven't seen it here yet I mean it

has been here I've sh shut down a few

but um yeah for some reason they haven't

shown up

much

well

well see I

got I Tower and a piece of wall the wall

I didn't need to

destroy probably need attack from corner

or

something you know there's a tombie too

I do know

that should I play it or should I play

like crash 2 or

something I probably need to attack in

the

cor to 2 is not available in

Swedish what about polish I mean if the

first one was not really been polish the

second one definitely isn't

technically I don't know but great oh no

oh

no oh no he landed on the piece of wall

asking since to shange AV langage

well I guess this is a change but is

more like they have removed languages

more than they haven't I don't think

they have added any new

one I think that's that's basically the

r Swedish and Spanish and I think that's

about

the remember removing basically not

[Music]

transl yeah that was a successful

run let's go back and repair it and try

in

H box in a CH last night that had the

name of the contents with in

Polish Polish

oh yeah I assume you should write the

content in the box and the language of

shipping it

to even

though sometimes the work is just

writing in language the shipping chome

which isn't that useful for the people

who receive

[Music]

it unless they happen to have someone

who knows

coming

no

yeah I think I think that was successful

I think this can work I just have to fly

back so often but it is working slowly

slowly working my way down on those

[Music]

Towers course was going to somewhere in

San

Antonio but it wasn't mine

though you have bought something from

Poland what are you waiting for but

anyway was the next a

machine and hel chapter is fast yeah it

this it is so I can move back and forth

quickly plus this is a area that is

close by I just can't access it with a

tank because it's on the other side of

water

and that work because I had already

weakened them with the missiles I just

had to get in some few shots to destroy

them

fully

mean I still think

like Precision shots with missiles is

the better way to go

but I remember the books from Pand

before

[Music]

v v if you say

so than so I order books I ordered stuff

from different

countries it this

fun books in different

languages I should have in

Spanish why is trying to lag my

face

there we

go what nothing singing that

one the

yeah The

Witcher I recognize that

[Music]

spelling

so I guess I'll just have to go to the

next place

then and continue my my

attack did fining and flag

High them hard target flag

again

okay no this doesn't go

in

I'm

[Music]

terrible yeah I probably need me

[Music]

signs precis shooting

bushes

okay

[Music]

wait was that the place with yeah that's

the pl wait which

one no I take the one with it N I should

go f

out which one seems to have bit less

density of

towers slightly less

Towers

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

now this is no this this is B right yes

this is

B I'm missing the Tower

I mean as long as I get

hit I'm getting

hit okay time to

be

so I think that was

[Music]

successful me ICBM for headp what's an

ICBM I destroy some towers and now you

just need to destroy some

more I assume the Red Towers are

actually functional and will attack if a

green vehicle appears just that there

are no green

Vehicles no no no

no my attack has

failed I need to go back try

[Music]

[Music]

again intercontinental ballistic yeah if

I had some missiles from the base I

could use that would be convenient I

could remove a few

Towers so I'm soon I'm going

to get rid of that

base need some more bombing rounds for

the

helicopters let me guess there going to

be a map that I can only use the

helicopter well of course and then heaps

of course

but oh these

[Music]

reasons h no

no no I a

single

who oh no I shouldn't flow through this

area

next okay kind have gone

[Music]

better

F over the drun neighborhood

[Music]

yeah so yeah I might I think I made some

progress not much though

but let me try

two towers destroyed at least okay so

two towers I guess you have to keep

track of

that obvious that doesn't

count only active

Towers I should attack

here one

one but I

[Music]

can't no no one

Tower Two Towers okay two

towers that does mean less towers are

going to shoot me next time I come

[Music]

back where are all these helicopters

coming from they keep attacking

[Music]

us they seem to know they Stu

we are never prepared for the

attack just keep chipping away at them

[Music]

yeah two more Towers gone I should have

count amount of towers

there I

wi I'm going to take down the whole

B I'm

coming wait I shouldn't not my arrival

schedu my arrival at the enemy

base like one helicopter versus two many

Towers one

Tower oh I guess I missed that

one two towers three towers Four

Towers no no five

to okay I'm

leaving that was five

[Music]

Towers should add a sketch team that

make sketch

Dr the G SK for a few

seconds

H I mean I guess that's an idea

currently none of the redeems or

anything is like does anything automatic

I

think is there any automatic redeem at

the

moment no I don't think any of the

redeems are automatic automatic so I

have to do everything

manually but I do

want uh automatic

RS yeah when you can make it automatic

first yeah I guess there should be a

channel on Discord

too redeems what redeems would like to

[Music]

see there it

is here we go one Tower Two

Towers

[Music]

come on come

on come on there we go three towers that

took you a while to

[Music]

die make

it there go I hit that

that okay I should leave I should

definitely leave now okay that was

dangerous oh no wrong

neighborhood oh silly

me I mean it still makes it even if I

lose all helicopters is still going to

be SI for the um tank to get in there so

there's still a

benefit but I obviously don't want to

lose my

helicopters

P got pounded in TR neighborhood

W this the Bas is

destroyed the base here to the West I'm

not started on yet and then there's this

space

go there's one of the FL

ball the other one no flag okay then I

can ignore

[Music]

that swim seats that's a good

[Music]

one

[Music]

[Music]

still thinking of the amazing future

with automatic redeems

and so that one does not contain a

flag so kind

of should maybe try

more a flag again well I got still got a

few more

places I said it really it really looks

like the chance of it appearing in a

building is smaller than it really

should be when you destroy a building it

almost has a bigger chance of moving to

a new building than it is that than it

is to appear in the building is

destroy oh no it

lags

no

no I

win I think I still destroy the annoying

places with the helicopter I think I

think that's still good those remaining

placees is aren't really too annoying to

get

to back to

tank I think that's what's

important I wonder if it's appear is a

percentage based on the number of

remaining buildings or if it appears of

X number of buildings have been

destroyed or if it's a specific building

it does not seem to be a specific

building and it's not the same building

every time I redo a level uh and

considering the the flag appears always

appears in such a late

building uh um like if there are three

buildings it appears to always be the

third building regardless of which order

I destroy them mean and there really

can't be a random chance for that I mean

sure there is a random chance

that they I just accidentally find it in

a certain building in two games but if I

do a third game and a fourth game the

the odds for it appearing in the last

building every time even if it's better

determined before I start the

level the a is so

small that is

unlikely while the building would be

chosen at random each time level

lows if it works on the third principle

I mean yeah yeah I get that

but consider considering how it's always

the third building in every time I do a

level with three buildings the odds that

I managed to always pick the correct

building of the third time is so small

so here we got one of

these that it is unlikely that it

appears that if you have three building

is forced to be in the third building I

destroy so yeah

but it's not always in the last building

I destroy if there's enough enough

buildings in that case it seem to be a

bit

earlier so it

seems that it somehow does a random

chance still in some way but the

percentage is

heavily leaning

towards

find

[Music]

it why trying to shoot

me I don't know maybe someone can like

look into the game code or something

figure that

out wait everyone destroy this

place okay let's move over to this place

the place that is shot down by a

helicopter hey why are you shooting me

I'm behind this thing in

safety oops now we're not

thisy no not you too oh no they

destroyed it okay now it's now it's game

over

stop shoting me okay actually surviv

that I'm surprised that I surviv that I

you still have

the the other tank so it's not compl

game

over but I wish to not lose

this sure I would be quite impro but not

impossible I mean consider how many

levels are done with three buildings

in You could argue that it's always in

the Fest one but I mixed around

sometimes I go with the furest buildings

and sometime go with the nearest

buildings I don't know it's always the S

one I'm going through the jungle and

that almost caused me to

die

ass that should be enough to get

home so

yeah I do think it is all also possible

that it is predetermined but only by

select H buildings that uh some

buildings are just dummy buildings that

they never

P but yeah no

idea

so what is my plan

now go in and get

destroy your house was

ugly and you sit in your spine on

from your

building okay what do we

have okay so started attack I not even

attacked the base yet really wish I

could access it from another way and I

got the South Base there too we'll see

how quickly I can destroy

that building with a flag in

it

yeah this this munition building is

completely useless cuz when I traveled

all this way back I'm not going to stock

up on my munition and then return to the

battlefield I could just return the all

way home and just prepare the

beacon

so

yeah a lot of text yeah must need to be

be smaller if Tas that

one Welcome to the Jungle we got fun

games we got everything you want honey

we know your

name We Are the People Too Much

T I'm trying to trying to read chats

when I'm ring the

tank oh let's get of

that wait am I going the right

way yeah this should be the right

way well I am going to the

right I should have

tanked there's a tank in here 7 return

quickly yes

pleas I'm going to L there it

comes

no one shot it well I didn't the second

one but the first one hit

it well I guess one shot this thing does

one shot it I think can I sh down trees

just trying to get through the jungle

here I do not feel welcome in this

jungle

cuz I'm getting

attacked oh okay there is a building

let's destroy

it say I'm missing the

building

okay no flag

there so then it's just the way south of

here but I should stock up

first what's your friend flying ruding

yeah that's his name flying rud

thing see I'm going stuck up I'm going

to waste some to destroy each

other

bunnies

maybe well I I don't know I may I made

the emotes shrink so it's always on a

single line until it gets to the

smallest size it doesn't fit so many on

the single line anymore and then it just

stays at that size I

think I guess when it reach 11 I could

make it bigger again to try to find a

way to put on two lines but 11 is a

prime

number that much but I yeah I could have

like six and our lines so

get with 12 we get two

lines 14 you got three in line and then

basically starts over with how line I

don't too much

effort on the flying rout things

back

waste some munition because I can't

stuck it up again

so now let's check the base to the

South and basically cuz I still left one

base top

North but you could argue that flag is

in there

but that I should check it but I'm kind

of forcing the flag into that building

by destroying every old the building

because I'm still going with the

assumption that I choose where the flag

is based on which building is I

destroy

don't know if I hit

anything apparently

not whoa whoa way too much way too

much okay I need to hide

oh oh

no I don't like

Corners oh what did I just

say

w no I don't want to destroy my shield

well I guess I'm destroying it

I'm shooting next

H

well strug with TB to try to get

back you have to be very

careful as I say as I'm not very

careful no I'm not very

careful

well oh this is a

problem

when I got far at least she just said I

don't like

Corners I no I said that you what are

you trying to point out

that's as I moveed down I find another

one I can't find that out myself

immediately I don't

know I don't know where to get you're

confusing

me these have two different destroyed

animations if squish the plants or if

you shoot the plants with a

helicopter or any other kind of things

when they land on the of the thing but

apparently if you shoot a tent or run

over a tent they have ex animation or

like deaths

appearance just to pick up

some

okay so I'm very very close

now I've destroyed a lot of the place

where they have one building or was it

two buildings cuz there's like three

locations left with buildings in them

one of which has two ballons by thing is

dead yes isn't that I leave I'm going

like half an hour over time

but

I will finish this

level I will finish this

level and this should be the last level

of this world or something and then

there's like three wordss or was it four

left was it even five I don't

remember

[Music]

this game does have a lot of levels

yep and they are quite different from

each

other yeah so if I continue South I have

that building I should be able to shoot

that building

now and hopefully without taking much

damage and then I just have to go to the

other South place where there's last two

buildings and that that should

be and if it doesn't contain any of

those it's just that upper North Place

left where I can just enter with the

Jeep not really I still have run

somewhere but almost just enter with a

Jeep almost

this game does run on quite high

resolution by the

way um I

think

pix

cuz it's using the full screen it

doesn't have like like these black

banners that a lot of other placing

games

have don't remember I should use this

one

yeah and I should follow that bridge

oh singing

emot if I knew the lyrics I

sing long I

guess there are no lyrics to this

song I mean lyrics are they just making

noises

then

where's the building

here yes there it is no flag what a

surprise let's just leave this

destruction behind while I'm done

there yeah I don't think they're

actually saying any words

well I don't know the me even if you

have like a non like even if just

gibberish you will still kind of have

lyrics I would

say just just transcribe the you're

saying but maybe that doesn't count as

lyrics

there's a tower left

here I don't care about your

Towers

destruction

right I don't remember where I was

supposed to go think it was south of

this place

so let's get R of you

then no it's out there oh I see I see

now so this is not this place so was the

right way I'm just running out of Fu

again pass through apparently not they

get colliding the

wall almost

drown okay let's

uh fill up the tank and fill up the

munition and go to the intend

place we played songs that had

localizing in the no real words yeah I

guess that's that's what it is

then but it should still be ways to

vocalize because they still

like they're still doing it in like a

word like manner if that makes

sense F Latin or what can't it's Latin I

don't

know yeah it sounds like a voiz is using

the same s

completely where supposed to

[Music]

go

oh

hello I didn't see you

there

Corner

okay I'm sorry people you have to leave

the

building

no stop throwing grenad at me

oh okay I'm getting attacked by

everything and

everyone this didn't go as

planned

I

wi oh no my single armored vehicle is

destroyed

well

one first time we play

[Music]

had over and over yeah but that's kind

of that's kind of my point what kind of

vocalizing is argument did

make and yeah and that that was kind of

also my point I guess it doesn't count

as lyrics because it doesn't have action

words it's just

jish no no but yeah but that's kind of

what I meant with what which kind of

vocalizing because there's a different

sound between ha and who even though you

can put them at any

tone but they still sound different from

each

other different qualities to

them

maybe doesn't matter but I know that's

cap I of the black Force

L I don't know I don't you

know say

backwards I'm

tired I'm TI

luno you okay youo

oh no oh

no we

go

you and

you and apparently

you no Flags

there no flag there in that case there's

only a single place it can be let's go

and visit that

place this this tank doesn't have those

markers I know they're not technically

markers on the other

tank but they kind of show you like a

third and two

thirds but yeah those aren't men this

markers but I kind function as

them

[Music]

go is it going to attack me now yes just

just to takes a quite the

one

ta flag flag no flag again yeah see was

a good thing I left this up here I'm

pretty sure it wasn't up here to begin

with it's just going to spawn up here

because it's the last

one

when can never clear out this

area

here it

is okay

okay so I cannot risk losing this

tank I will go back and repair it and

then I will destroy the room towers and

I can also check the map for how many

Towers

left might was one t yep hello

Prince hello I'm here but I'm going to

get lunch right now so I'll be

back well good luck on your lunch

what will it be for

L CU close Okay how many tow I got a few

Towers I'll probably go

on I don't know Outside

Inside I shouldn't need to remove that

man

Towers May me a sandwich m

like a nice

sandwich with sand and witches in

them I will be back yes I will be

waiting for you although I'm probably

going to end stream when I finish this

level so so we'll see if you manage to

get back before it because the flag is

just here so you might

not be back before this

thing I'm trying to reach

you

okay go

oh someone got

switched

[Music]

W let's

just not that this will attack the Jeep

but you know just to be on safe

side

and has been

secured and now back to get to the

Jeep well if you're have happy I'm happy

I'm happy happy to see

you as long as you're having fun and

stream that's the one manag to me yeah

yeah I'm

happy

keep an eye out for the flying R thing

now flying R things for

now thank you

for being so

supportive

now there's a few Towers left still

pressing back when I open the menu even

though that's not how you not get that

many the really should I put it the

because because the controller has a

primary button uh which is the accept

button the secondary button which is can

cancel back button then I have the third

and four button the third third button

is used

for CU is a third and four button but

the third and four

button it really depends on which which

one

you fors but they are used for opening

map no they're not I mean one is used

for opening map but then use the back

button to open the information panel

about the vehicle but they can just put

that on the force button I got the flag

and now we're out of here that was a

crazy map

this I'm pretty sure that if I replay

this map destroy that bu that that flag

building up there and then just restart

the map and destroy it again and

repeatedly do that and count how many

times the flag appears in that building

I wouldn't be surprised if it's less

than what it should be or maybe it never

appears

there shouldn't be too hard to do

because I can Bic basic I think I can

infiltrate with a helicopter and then he

crash down on it whoa oh I missed

it

whoa like B that is Will

William

aure would be easier to learn by here

okay let's skip this

how long is they take 1 hour 50 minutes

oh my took almost almost two

hours that was quite the

map quite the

map but there we go 18 minutes 1 hour 50

minutes oh it's quite a difference in

length on some of these Maps but that's

wa for next

time this this map boat

race I don't like the sound of

that next time is okay is five like

maybe three words maybe four words left

no it's five it's five words one of

unlocked and not done a single level on

and then is four

more but what the leev other levels are

that's that's a secret for now you see a

slight bit of

those that's for next

[Music]

time H what did you say almost two third

of a stream

yes but race but race what but

race you want a butt

race I was going to say you're a butt

but you're not a

butt you have a

butt

so maybe you don't have but who shall we

visit you know

what we should visit jber I think he's

streaming together with h

isumi but um but that allows me to you

know rate J

barbs J barbs

games doesn't that sound

fun

that was quite it was

crazy I almost lost everything there at

the end I was too careful about

it I would be quite annoying if I

actually lost it

there and as he lost the game not lost

my

comp at least the computer is acting

better this time I'm not sure what was

last time fun you are cutie and have

good

night thank you for being here J

and chatting around and uh well that was

fun

later see you tomorrow for

another outfit

stream thank you everyone for being

here that was fun maybe I should do the

P Pon pink dress tomorrow which which I

still have done I should probably do it

tomorrow because that's way

overd oh which outfit one

one p yes you kind of wrote that before

I said it I

guess

so they got the other the links to

stuff I'll check if anyone has because

no I should get an EMA if someone sends

starts H donating on patreon which I

haven't received unless it's set WR

account or

[Music]

something uh

but I still have

ACC just that technically I don't won't

see that money for quite a

while for reason so it's not

important stream rain is

[Music]

happening
