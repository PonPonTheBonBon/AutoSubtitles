you made some

some in some size and some in a smaller

studies basically

Market Mesa 12 ferries wait I need 25.

isn't that very easy

but I think I see something sparkling

out with that foreign

oh I did it

you know if you need to look far into

the distance oh yeah I do need that hold

down the L button and move the control

pad in the direction do you want to see

oh

that's pretty nifty okay

yeah they can commenting

one second like

shadow or something but it says

sometimes it shows up

[Music]

foreign

flying over there

nothing Secrets up at least

okay

I'm not allowed to give away

it is a very very tiny hover

[Music]

I need to help her

in any of the Kings

but they started flying at least so

don't worry

that for me not the greatest in this

game

I I had a feeling that that for me in

this metric game wasn't going to be like

fantastic but

here we go there's a little Shadow I can

use

good job Spyro we got a lot of

terrorists to rescue yeah like this one

oh what a spin don't worry if I got

falling into the fairy worlds

this Autumn Ferry

on that money Banks

Spyro my funny smile of oh wait that's

not nice spiral my Spanish singing you

seems high school poets aren't as

profitable as I had heard so I came here

and struck up a deal with the rhinox

crazy things

I'm getting paid a fortune for a very

large rhino

to keep this insect infested level

restricted from dragons

come to think of it he never did mention

anything about a dragonflies I suppose

letting a dragonfly through wouldn't

cause any harm now would it

is this a Sparks lemon

especially if you were to pay me say a

small fee

pay foreign

oh yeah the the fairy screams will

surely stop

someday

would I risking them

those lemons in my symmetric

that would be interesting but I do need

more fairies

okay smiley bags let's paint up

ah Spyro from your heart into my

pocketbook you just have you spent your

this possible income wisely

disposable income he said I didn't even

get into 11. Jesus first means it

I was gonna say apparently it didn't

count me paying my bags it did it just

specific it updated

today 30 comes up to the 400 before I

can subtract it

[Music]

okay so I can shoot I can speed so

apparently I don't put

when it claimed that they were singing

of tempo me ring them in a very slow

phase like this certainly it's going to

have them bring them and

scene you have been seen in Tampa yes

I'm set in a Green Valley in a temple

[Music]

this is much easier to find my way

around this time

pretty donuts I don't know why I think

it's just smaller

I think it starts because there's some

some landmarks for this balance

foreign

[Music]

this one

yeah as you can see something must

happen

oh spider it's simply marvelous the

choir is singing just perfect now please

take this metronome as a token of my

appreciation

that you held hostage here is this

island

I like that

[Music]

don't ask me

stop talking to

YouTube

to hear something

I just need to figure out where I mean

is it up here

yes yes

Stone Age Speedway

well winter Stone Age please

Homeworld

it's difficulty normal difficulty only

exited

but I can do it hard no problem be the

cars Before Time Runs Out

this is running into enemies we slow you

down and take away time

[Music]

well well

[Music]

all right

[Music]

I'm gonna miss one

[Music]

you can see it there's a tomato

[Music]

medium normal

[Music]

[Music]

at least one second but I also lose the

opportunity to begin as I continue

I don't have a sense of

them is over so

[Music]

it's not nice

no best time

why how how long is this

wait wait do you really like a progress

bar or something showing

I actually did sometimes continues

I know

[Music]

I am an adult I can do this on heart

[Music]

should be

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

that is wasting time

[Music]

that was one of them

[Music]

and there's please

[Music]

wow

what's that yes

[Music]

I can do this

that busiest RK Einstein I just thought

became my sister in this shirt

while it's so not sure

come on I can do this

this shouldn't be hard

[Music]

well that was a waste of a second

[Music]

when I say how did they really matter

[Music]

so this passes and then we went into the

Temptation because

why am I giving the heart patterns now I

got the ease button before and before

when I got these but it was still hard

because the boss man

[Music]

very

tricky

[Music]

[Music]

maybe I can put you on assembly

come on wait

where you would like to have rather

because it shouldn't be able to you must

be able to

react to something

but

he's probably trying um

sometimes it's impossible if you get the

wrong patterns

and I would say that the

this is really hard

I'm gonna do some very much

for being

for just being

for adults

[Music]

I didn't expect it to really be this

much challenge

[Music]

whatever is bad at this

I mean yeah but

[Music]

this is so much harder than doing like

to be raised in regular spiral ways

so if you see the Speedways

[Music]

the regular Sprite is hard it's

[Music]

[Music]

nice

come on come on

friends

[Music]

was shooting with cooking

[Music]

what what he is shooting

[Music]

thank you

oh it's a fire is

it

let's shoot if I don't see it

it's another another

shoes straightforward so if I'm going to

shoot something I need to cover it but

when I cover it like I can't see where

it is

when you get home

foreign

this was quite a challenge

but I don't do it I'll do it

I can only see my head like

one thing if you're doing hard one fan

for doing it

but if I do hard first I'm speaking in

both ways unless normal is a different

challenge

[Music]

thank you

another problem you have is thanks and

when he gets hit he no no shoot

the problem with and then it gets into

invincible and

for a period of time but then when it

stops being invisible it takes time

like that for example it takes time and

um

just

it starts being

vincible

concerns

and before he can start shooting meaning

that you can

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

times

how many attempts do you think this

would take

this is supposed to be the first

Speedway by the way

some reason these enemies are much

easier to deal with than a lot of other

enemies in the first world

foreign

[Music]

this might just be a

setting me up for

[Music]

yeah what do you say prepare me for not

preparing for what to come

[Music]

it's probably a nice template

[Music]

thank you

brother was trying to find a place for a

Solitude of solitude away from the

rhinox and hit in these vase

Okay so

sheep where he gets an extra knife you

know

Okay so

then I just had to buy but there was

torches deuces

the last remaining enemies

and this this way over here

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

if you see myself with

a wasted jar

as he said that

this is where the base was as apprentice

the base of the jar what's the

difference between white piece and jar

and

it's in a place

oh

which I can't find

I guess I'll just Trace

the age of the level again

all right I see an enemy

kit

so these were the things I was supposed

to go to

[Music]

I didn't mean to kill you

and on behalf of the Panda Garden stuff

I would like to thank you for spending

some of you Tranquility time here I have

a present treat on your way out bye bye

now I want to eat this

[Music]

you're a sweet stepping

and where am I now

[Music]

is this display

[Music]

so I still got stuff to do

[Music]

things

you're welcome

okay it seems like I got everything here

but I have

38 more

to advance

this one's

same company I had to Choice

that's the other Ferry and the key are

you

this is the second time I've seen

someone

of the Frozen fairy as a treatment there

are more are they eating okay

that's that

I don't know I don't want to talk to you

I want to fly over here

yes I need to find that other secret

place

oh no this is going to be hard

[Music]

now

when I did something believe something

on it because I already got the ferry

from the

watch sing Oh wait I lose the jar don't

they

foreign

because

how did I get to the other planes

all right it was here

[Applause]

probably get a fave from this

what is this place it is a landmass died

and then

so I basically to

left

tip like this

[Music]

but not that

this too much this is just be nice and

slide around

and he can't be here because this is the

end of the word

and it was not such a scenery

like a continued trace the edge of the

world is knee

Maybe

apply

take that

and there was not

playing

this chest

it's

yeah okay so there's his chest yeah

to do it from

with us

this scene

[Music]

thank you

I can't find something

[Music]

there you go

whichever question in class because they

got this one I just need to find the key

tracing the world outside continues

now please throw a button

am I still have left

it's the yeah if I find that place

that's probably about remaining

size one

it's not this that part because it's

only supposed to be like a

I think a small blue building

and

all right

and this is the bottom of the world

this is the right edge of the world

yeah

oh there's a gym I didn't see this stuff

and that was a good thing I found it

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

all right this was something here

[Music]

okay this is the only thing I get

only vehicles

it's a very small building

this is a very heavy dress cute

the jar is obviously there there's the

key

and then there's the tiniest of land as

you can see on the right

which I assume I should jump from land

at the base of the building

wait

I can't even get up to the building

because this building is two levels up

two levels up and then

and Afraid like three levels up I can

jump but

[Music]

bring it up on screen

[Music]

so yeah

[Music]

perfect so

this land mess I should jump from and as

you probably are

very short that I would go down there

and just lie down here but but when I

get down here I can't get a PA

because this is two levels up you can

only jump one level at a time like this

height you can only jump up so there

must be some kind of building here that

I can jump here

that gives me another clue

maybe there's this one of these small

parts

work but

um

do you like my fancy transitions

and like this

then but that's the same that's not the

thing I'm looking for

should I like

thank you

yeah is it like this

oh I see there it is

mystery salt oh it's a lot of knives on

that with her

I can't have

and Miss does it seem

this landmass is what's

and it's this level

okay let's see if we can do that it's so

much more to think about than a kid why

is this all but anyways I mean how to

get up I know how to get there I need to

get to that

let's go around and cut it

all right

I mean really going around

looking around

foreign

doing some

spiral season of eyes

I know how to yeah yes it's a Disney

sheep I jump over here

and then I find this jar

[Music]

and this building is behind that all the

other thing

down

now I just need to get back

here

[Music]

and then I need to get back up here

and then if I got everything cracked

down

it should just be

it doesn't seem

Ed

yes this is the place

this is the place

let's jump from this corner

thank you

okay I guess that point my hero what

what's the name oi

that should probably be easy to find

this is part of the year I know it's

very annoying as you can see I promise

but that's my biggest issue with this

game

certainly the Game Boy Advance had

enough memory to save your progress

because obviously that same microbes so

right Justin

don't reset it when he died

doesn't interested enemies it doesn't

reset gems

because but it does reset uh

which items they are activated

thank you

it's running around all these unless

these places

what's the

oh yeah

the chest is there okay awesome

you just go back

so they have for some reason

decided that those things you reset

kind of running out their lives

oh yeah moisturized I'm glad it does

reset some things

need to work

there's all the gyms and now I just need

to find a giant

yay again

I'm still killing the father and

he's going to form like extra lives

kill it every time I walk past them

I'm just trying to find the building at

the moment

[Music]

and the annoying part is never always

want to speak to you

[Music]

approach them

that's it

yes

all right is it back please because

because yes

oh long I'm so glad you're safe inspired

please take my meditation Crystal as a

thank you if

probably not the voice that he used to

put a panda from this time

does that means

then the garden is complete

I don't need to but I can't take exits

yes I know it moving here

sorry I got to thinking away I'll be

lacking the

you said

I'm happy that you're here

even if you have relaxing okay I

appreciate it

Technologies it doesn't change anything

it doesn't crack anything

[Music]

at the end of the year exclamation mark

killer

it's as an innocence it does write the

large message

but yeah

what's this hummingbird Forest

I can do it

treasure found serum 777

oh that's what they mean behind bird

you call it Corporal Elise

it is a relieved serious iron a plate of

Nancy rhinox has impacted maneuvers

please help us get rid of them

when you are speaking today I was

running very very

[Music]

I can't really see which height this is

[Music]

you are just the soldier I need help me

with the resignation okay the run is

kept six members around my Brigade and

lock them in cages I think your charge

will break those kids doors

yeah I'm not going like do you accept

this mission

nope that thing was too high

I can't tell the height of things

why can't you see one out of six

not just one

I'm gonna speak

these things

[Music]

because this level doesn't have

[Music]

oh find your mind wait did I take damage

from me

the Box actually for so long can I check

like I had no idea I can jump over to

this piece

if they just had like ground just to put

some watches I can determine the height

but that's part of the challenge being

able to have no idea if you can make a

jump or not because that's fun

[Music]

right

oh burning bunnies yeah

I will be playing with these things

I mean

it's a different kind of bird bunny

I think I'll stop shivering soon thanks

bye I can help you

in spicy pieces

I was gonna say this is spitting

when speaking fines one is really

priorities

[Music]

where is that meaning that locked in

that Ice Crystal that is

tapping wait I'm going to say this

progress

assistant

[Music]

I guess they have more

abilities

[Music]

I really like that you like the camera

[Music]

so they have no idea that you're

approaches

[Music]

no

[Music]

am I supposed to go here anyway

but it is

[Music]

[Music]

but how many

more hundreds what

many fit 400 gems in this level

do you see this is not a big level 400

gems I only got them now hot

[Music]

[Music]

because I was going to say that

[Music]

before

um

no no

if I get the key

code the practice is still yeah it saves

everything everything is safe except the

objects you can activate with your plane

these are the expires

in Arizona

in this level it's like those things are

insect and that it gives them it's very

specific things

[Music]

I don't get why

it's such a weird assistant

[Music]

parents or saved killed and Mr said

thank you

yep the jar and the activities

deactivate these things that leaves

their Ferry

I heard my Flame

in my way

back here

does it say my jam collecting

[Music]

this is okay

so I assuming just themes when you die

it's like you get the game over

because everything is reset as if you

got a game over so what's the point of

the lives what what does the life say I

did play a bit of a Super Mario 64. and

I have the same question in that game

when you die you get thrown out of the

painting if you get the game over

you have to be you are forced out to 11.

so

it's like to go back when you're getting

him away

academies don't come back when he died

that's the difference here

but what's the point of life

[Music]

since then he gets thrown out the

library on it

[Music]

the only difference is that

yes

hello

[Music]

oh my

God

you know what

okay okay okay that's it

it's been three hours I can't I can't do

this anymore

thank you

[Music]

are you sure you want to save me again

of course

she wanted Equity came that's my

question

oh

yeah I try on that last one that was

oh that ending

that ending of the game

that was embarrassing

[Music]

um

yeah

and so

because I'm feeling

[Music]

you may have moment to check

so tomorrow I will continue the game and

which I haven't said yet and

the uh

[Music]

let's not do that uh the uh

the collab That was supposed to happen

on Sunday is instead moved to Saturday

[Music]

so at the same time so that is six

things you'd see

so

yeah 17 18 19 European Time

and then that would be

is let's say Canada

9 10 11 12.

19 11 A.M 20 P.M

Pacific instant

and in Australia

that is

yeah

that's 12.

130 and 2 A.M

but that's on Sunday because that's past

midnight

a collab wing with a shot of director

and easy Mechanicsburg

and that's about it yes

so how about we go and visit the 420

belly

Railway

thank you all for being here and it's

okay

it's been fun it was an interesting game

I always I had no shortage I had no

choice I wasn't sure at all how well

that game would go yeah

but considering uh

inspiring was like

not a game designed

it it's like a 3D game

making a game boy version of it could be

right bad but

it could have been really bad but I

think they did it very good for what

they still annoyances what's everything

resetting when they die and that's very

annoying but aside from that if they

just didn't do that I think it could be

a really good good game and aside from

the camera being so zoomed in but that's

just due to the resolution of the Game

Boy

that's why they added the

moving the camera view but I wish they

could move the camera automatically As

you move around but I guess it's too

late to ask for those changes now

oh yes I didn't say it but uh

Ben is playing medieval too

for the game I should play at some point

foreign
