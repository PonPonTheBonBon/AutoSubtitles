[Music]

think fix

[Music]

thing it's because

[Music]

I on

[Music]

my there you

go now I can have the calm and relaxing

music

[Music]

so this is the robot I was working on

last time rabbit

stamped

wa

[Music]

I

don't really think that Swedish

[Music]

has

[Music]

yeah I don't think swi has a term

for Sweden doesn't have any St

Peds we don't need a turn for

it animals in Sweden

also

they have one translation here which is

calik but it's not really used that

[Music]

way a tomal AR Riot a distorted chaos

yeah comes from Turkish timan tur is or

modern

Turkish

cab

finish really no stamped rage r

maybe

and in my pony where they had the rabbit

Stampede I think they translate as

caning yeah which now doesn't really

have

a translation

otherwi but pic flick but it kind of

shows

that doesn't this not really I way

but

[Music]

and I hav not really had a reason to use

[Music]

[Music]

it

[Music]

it that would be

fake let's comment fake parentheses fake

it's behind the text can't see

it

yeah I can't see it doesn't matter

much so we take the regular pong

pong actually think better to take like

this

the fake one is going to be slightly

different because fake

Coco I should have taken some

good screenshots of the original

costumes really

comparing

but you said eating some car Carolina

cheese

p and yeah that that can be transl to

Rabbit

Rush rabbit are rushing to which I guess

could work

or could could

work

how you know it's rabit robot like the

robot p p

actually it's not yet complete so I will

work on it over the weekend over the

week I mean not weekend

week did you say what outfit you were

making on

stream I think I said that I was going

to to

uh the fake pon

[Music]

pon so what I will do is

import oh yeah this

one

this Windows is showing up but

whatever skes Coco fake mesh there we go

import and here we

go that need it so this is fake Coco and

the important aspects of fake Coco is

this bush bushy

eyebrows

which and these beautiful teeth she got

here okay can I select the under and up

and have everything includ it no of

course

not of course

[Music]

not that would just be too easy let's

delete the head watch out for creepy

nice I guess it's not creepy without the

texes cuz what else is I don't think

there's anything else to Pi go

the bushy eyebrows and they bad

teeth very bad teeth

[Music]

I know what you're making just not sure

men on stream and didn't want it was a

secret no don't

worry no worries about

that

[Music]

beautiful oh I'm going to need two BS so

what is

that just called to

me but I warn

you

so I need to remove the old

teeth which should actually include the

T this

time go I think that's the only

thing needs to delete let's separate

these two so I can work them independent

of each

other okay so the

uh

it kind of Clips through the B the thing

here I could remove it and have

like f pon pon thing

different I can also keep

[Music]

it and I didn't upscale it take

um oops

[Music]

that's

[Music]

annoying know I might be able to

to SC I'm

using the one just fine I just need to

do part of it if the te and eyebrows are

in the same

part now of course course this stuff is

on this

side ibrs on this

side otherwi I could cut out this part

and do the UPC only on that but

apparently that's not an

option I guess I need to up them

separately

from P kind of looks give it those

eys The Fluffy eyebrows they are okay I

guess I guess you're

correct it's kind of a cute

look even even fake

one

so was when I was working with

[Music]

class

and yeah is not part of

that yeah it should probably because

it's part of e

not the split them

map well your job for today is make her

look

I know but I want her to be

[Music]

[Music]

kute there we go if I just copy this one

fine

[Music]

mean this

better

B so small like that the best it can do

obviously it's very limited what it can

do

we got a modify dress for this outfit uh

well considering how well on the person

how you

see Focus outfit isn't different except

for what's

pink this turn

black and you can argue that since

[Music]

H uh p p dress is pink it should be

turned black but it's such a large thing

on the model on C it's more like smaller

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

details COC it kind of works turning the

pink to

Black

I and it's going to me the face animate

I just need to decide like what the

frame rate of it should be the quicker

the frame rate is this the shorter the

will

[Music]

be having a short

animation also makes the

animation like a slow animation can work

like the

r

[Music]

that seem be same they just this ni

happened

[Music]

eybrow change color yes that's the what

and and if you hide this

eyebrows you see that she only has like

black eyebrows so

something

worried about spamming too much here I

appreciate people writing a lot here

so want spam as much as you

[Music]

want I have no problem with

that red dragon pon

pon

[Music]

hello

the whole part is

here I

I there we go that's what kind of behind

the

chat can

might the those

smaller

that's I don't know might be too small

to mean I guess you can see the layers

now it might B

black B

black so I said I can make the straps

black only want make the whole dress

black

everything

like is the straps okay that's not just

the straps that's the

band as

one let's just take a look how that look

Theon

on come on there many

times

oh beening today update

it's updating very slowly there we go

black bow black eyebrows that are not

bluish

anymore black any more like this maybe

it does add a nice

contrast what you up to

today P

Che

and a

hydrate I'm making the outfits for the

pon pon for the crash for

[Music]

mod and this will be the fake Pon

equivalent for a fake Coco which is an

equivalent fake

crash so that's

uh many datives

here but I can like black traps maybe

this edge here should be black like like

not not having the whole dress

black maybe that

works oh I see that's

awesome have you seen the mod set them I

need to show off you

know yesterday I worked on this one good

job any time okay

now I don't know

[Music]

why

well I don't have anything else running

other than drawing software plender

streaming

Discord

one two tabs in CR I can close

kiss I have fun

away Bando

M Bando

mes know you want me to read that I fell

asleep early yesterday I said I didn't

get to see what you ended up doing you

were working on a TV

yes and currently I'm not working oh

there we go they crash died crash died

blender died and crashed blender crashed

crash to die that wasn't great PR

day anyway it what

happen

just be able to open it lightning

s is there reason why at the

moment I don't know why like I just save

so I haven't lost

anything

that

I just want to show up what I made is

that too much D for like if I can't

switch objects how am I supposed to work

this there we go and

crashing oh the J has problem at the

moment and I don't know

why

no followers stay I'm actually amazed at

that that means there's only 15 more

followers I

need just going on at a

[Music]

moment it's def attention yeah yeah why

it that's is

totic yeah don't know what's going

on okay now it's loaded much quicker

so I can hide this and show this without

problem I understand it takes a bit for

it low because it needs Lo and the mesh

because it hasn't loaded those

[Music]

stuff it crashes when I want to show

them all

F don't know what's wrong like I had to

pre fine I could probably open that one

and have

[Music]

show I can do

[Music]

that I still have access to

it but you know would be nice ACC f

H can you show a screenshot now here's

the in 3D yeah so this is the screen I'm

been working on that's the face a very

pixelated

face pone is becoming a computer so her

fluffy bunny is gone it's all plastic

me

shiny oh that is

awesome thank

you yeah the goal is to have her face

animated this

[Music]

one let me see how that

[Music]

goes so anyway back to this

one guess I'll just stick to that

[Music]

and that turn out

fantastic thank you thank you I'm not

done with it I have uh some more stuff I

want to work

[Music]

on most like fixing the beit a bit more

it should be a bit different and

[Music]

uh yeah what

[Music]

El

[Music]

16

got

this what is

nothing

[Music]

[Music]

one

you have selected

[Music]

Lu well in that

case I'll do this and see how it

[Music]

looks

[Music]

yeah I don't exactly know how I will do

the okay like that that's like some

black

[Music]

highlights and

update

the wrong

one

one there we yeah now I got some black

highlights

w i one I guess it's more Mis with the

black

m it should be strength

though looks fine not question is how I

should should do the inside maybe the

inside should be black

too H H is amazing

as thank

you I'm happy I think

[Music]

so I'm Miss what I

[Music]

[Music]

like let's make the dress black on

inside then I don't know a decided

fabric on fabric

so it's pink on the outside black on the

inside and then you have

like they have

what don't like too

much be one pix

more

I know I took a peek on her dress how

how rude of

me how

D anyway if

I Oop There You Go that might

better there you go I guess this is fake

pon

pon I don't know if there's anything

else to

do

wait how is it the eye color and stuff I

think that's

the because COC has green

eyes

ni

how is it for fake Coco does she also

have green eyes and I mean the fake Coco

specifically crash 4 I know they changed

fake crashing Coco

from not guess crashes well I guess

crash ano is wearing

blue

because main characters have to wear

blue I don't think that's a trend but I

mean Mario

Sonic even Mega

[Music]

Man I should I had a longer list of

characters crushing

Coco if you need any ideas I filling the

gaps on p p the B but add joints

leg I wanted to add like joints there

but the artist didn't want that the

artist wanted the part to

float

so I I could either but since the artist

wanted the pieces to float I mean it is

easier for me in the

end what am I doing I'm I'm trying cck

for a fake COC stion that was what I was

doing now nice is still green yeah as

the show is the pink is black

more it's not pink it's

black like

that but yeah so I guess I don't have

anything more to do with

this well I guess I do have to all

suppli

here

so for this black Parts how do they do

the what

color that color no problem I can do

that yeah if that's how the artist wants

then give it that yeah I think I think

that's

my all

right

[Music]

wait I me what I mind to

me

again

show oh um

so I need to set this up to be

automatic I keep I keep

foret that's just that's just

[Music]

something

so what now hey I need to fix the

uh so the FC is done I

think

fake oh see done yeah

the FC is done because it looks like

this

instead cuz it adds a bit

of

effect and other than that I don't think

I need to change anything

else this feel

like

okay I they want that way I you that

way yeah I guess fake fake Pon is done

now

it would be a quick and easy one to

make and it took like 1

hour got a bunch of blend issues

too so there's one

other I would

like

[Music]

check my

[Music]

phone so checking the phone for which uh

outfit is

replacing I know how to name

it

and it will

be okay I to call this one Copa fake I

just call it fake not unnecessary

to uh

[Music]

so I will do Pon

p as a dog that's the

idea we Coco with

B now she's going to my

I I'll keep it as a reference and the

dog is going to my

shorts

but I will have her fantasy I know long

short maybe just one set of polygons

further down maybe

so instead of there can

have short and there instead or

something oh

no

dress how

sh give it back F needs

it I can do

[Music]

like half like

[Music]

that I

see

what so

that

[Music]

I think that's

everything so this will

be

this I didn't any the start of the

shorts blush blush n

hisy oh no

naked but but there's nothing

here close your

eyes I'm going to turn this into shorts

don't worry they won't be naked

anymore

I think it has like an angle

of

[Music]

so h

[Music]

that's not my

[Music]

time

[Music]

don't

[Music]

mind

okay that

again yeah that should be fine inter

intersect the wrong

sign that

works

[Music]

[Music]

some edes then it's

just some does seem be fine this time

sometimes it

waes I don't necessary watch this but it

okay

now there go there some I need

to separate the B tmy I'm

[Music]

just making a good height of the

shorts and then I will add the

[Music]

solidify

and

how not that she's

going and is actually part

[Music]

of one wearing this outfit at same time

but T this

stick because see because I think on

Coco

[Music]

at this cocon one

is

[Music]

r no I probably have to load

in let's

[Music]

open H default

Coco here we

go messed up

texture this is the thickness they

use on the

shirt

is 24 cm obviously not 24 cm that's

really sick

but the units while editing are not

correct we to take a

point

and put it the that to

the to that

[Music]

point sh let's hide their hair so I can

see what I'm

doing

[Music]

yeah

and then me her up to the top of her

hand it says 50 52

m c is 52 me tall but anyway that's not

Point especially here this is a very

very

sick think there's any other part I

really can I'm going to sh here

like

25 maybe I go with 25

then on the shorts cuz that's like

actually

go

same that means if I set it on the M I

set it

50

now going

SES let's start

this

and also all these seems will have to be

remade

so

wa his crazy

this

your

[Music]

there we go it's not

confusing I just

have body where it goes straight the

body I it ensures no clipping issues and

stuff I was

[Music]

Sports way that's a good one that's an

outfit I still haven't added to the mon

yet but I

will

eventually

there we

go the soft fluffy bunny tummy

yes it is probably very

[Music]

soft yeah why didn't Crush have that an

enemy defe defeats crushing Coco by give

them

wedgies would make more sense with crash

and

Coco outfit

but I mean it doesn't have to make

[Music]

sense now does

[Music]

it I guess I

can

[Music]

here

oh no it's clicking

[Music]

soon oh

no I'm peeking on the inside of her

shorts don't mind me now I have to this

isue of

course Bato hello where did you learn

blender basically

self I've done a lot of

[Music]

yeah lot of Trail in

here a lot of figuring stuff

out oops

wrong oh still wrong

[Music]

mode have M wish it could

like m have vanish

[Music]

[Music]

together

[Music]

[Music]

no should have that

[Music]

issue learning plan isn't too tricky so

with

some

tush blush it's just shorts don't worry

about

it and this part is completely inside

that's going

show sure it's a body

texture it's that's my that's

fine so then I was thinking

like I'm tanked up on top of that let's

go

top

SP on the top or the

bottom too much

sugar too much sugar

[Music]

energy

[Music]

would

be hyperactive

forever

forever taking weeks

to get rid of all that

energy cannot

sleep there you go wait how did P

multi one became so hyperactive she

multiplied she's multiplying like

arits

yeah I

want the to to be a bit

different

what can I try to think like what kind

of she is moving so fast that someone

moving regular time she appears to be in

several different

places H is not how it

works

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

what is like the option

T I going to see a

this

I know ask for an option but I never

said what option looking for I don't

even know what option I'm looking

for oh yeah yeah remove the

[Music]

[Music]

it's

it has to be quite

big

[Music]

that's kind

like what I

need I

hope spr the bunch of

[Music]

P correct angle

[Music]

I'm

yeah will

probably I needed

[Music]

to

mirr are you going to animate it well it

[Music]

is it is a mod so it will be tied to

Coco

skeleton

so it should already be

animated also this up which she had

before okay yes I'm basically using Coco

animations and

such

what that's fine it's

okay I well I haven't talking but it's

[Music]

okay

[Music]

sometimes

sometimes I might

[Music]

[Music]

touch

maybe I'm going out this little

WI

[Music]

[Music]

oh

[Music]

[Music]

I

if you wonder what I'm doing

know what name okay I'm

actually trying to figure

[Music]

out trying to make the to the strap

something so clever

[Music]

way

[Music]

PR sh

[Music]

okay yes I can see that this my time

s

can the name of the

swim I

[Music]

see no sport well in that

case you can only the

sports I think that is

[Music]

[Music]

acceptable

oh no no this is

Kid

[Music]

for

[Music]

it's

something I guess I just try it out it

back up just in case in case I need to

make a difference

like something like

[Music]

that just like B land REM

everything

[Music]

okay no

not

[Music]

and thank

[Music]

you

[Music]

oh no

okay after finding correct mode I realiz

that these are

offset C

issues

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

much there

go and clean up after then

intersect back

hopefully no

morees like

that

[Music]

right like

that there you

[Music]

[Music]

go

and he's

try

[Music]

did part there

[Music]

to I can

[Music]

actually I might want to

for I'll make it of that just in

case and then

intersect and let's again clear

stuff see how it looks

then it

is

easy determine if I like it

or not after these things has been

removed

which I

use should be really small tiny tiny

train

second

back I hope the ass didn't SC away me

newc since time is definitely

up

making sure you get your points

worth so I'm going to delete

this yeah this this is more my what I

want that's a beautiful poons hello

L they are very

L

out yeah using them

to determine where everything's going to

go can look a b fun

with now now it looks very without them

covering up the whole

[Music]

one so the part here is going to be so I

this and then comes

[Music]

here

that

distance then I

Don't Really T

[Music]

there

go that's my

one yeah it's when you

come to like this part here is becomes a

bit

messy

I should mail some coffee be

right who are you mailing coffee

to come back hone need

[Music]

now make

oh he didn't want to play along with the

J will have

B oops

that let's match them match single

point and then I

can move those

and then I just need to figure out how I

best press I can't have like this

man maybe if I make a point between that

remove these two

points it makes a lot of verses there

but under a PL versus here

[Music]

to

maybe I should go back

[Music]

and obviously the topology for Coco here

is like

made for

it while I'm basically not doing that

for Pon pond because

I'm like obviously the topology has is

been made to work with

this and not look like

this

[Music]

but

that requires a bunch of extra

[Music]

work have time for that

I can do

that a b better I can't make

coffee did you realize that

now my actually get make C goes out and

T

be look around the available tools and

wait a minute I don't even know how to

make

[Music]

coffee too much junk on St can't boil

water I guess that's a more reasonable

explanation yeah I don't know what to

say the problem with leing with other

people

here

don't take this stuff away from

[Music]

me and S you to joke it's too

late have already

[Music]

[Music]

cried as much as I try to keep that Stu

clean for next person no suest fav what

I have you said

[Music]

[Music]

anything

sing plenty of times oh

well oh

well well in that it's

right

[Music]

they obviously not the correct apology

here because this

[Music]

is when I could remove this this L

[Music]

here Mak it that b

[Music]

cleaner

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

see

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

okay

so I'm just doing this just to see if I

[Music]

can ni

topology keep talking about

now you're SI no just do

this there we

go

always has like this Cuts in

[Music]

here

right

[Music]

yes

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

and

B

[Music]

that

sound

where

hand wait do

this

[Music]

oh

[Music]

h

so yeah this is like proper more propery

it's like nothing perfect but definitely

better I'm

sure it should be

not no

this is likeing

proper

what color would it be that's a good

question what color should the mtop and

shorts

be so I do like how I made the bology I

actually want to do the but it actually

look

good I mean something I'm

satisfying

orange wait why orange top blue

shorts

oh want blue that's an

idea

yeah otherwise I could go with like a

pink top and light blue

shorts

might otherwise be a nice combination

because you know

p

and second or red wait red talk

of course red says red I promise that's

not a

b like do you want like a red trop with

like a maybe a dragon PR on the

[Music]

front oh wait never seen that

before I mean it's not like

can oh open SVG

find no it

cannot well that's a

shame that would have my S if I could

just open

it and that

way

I guess I'm I have to do this

[Music]

way was way to like is there short

command to like wait

[Music]

image in view or

something there is something back now it

is maybe pink top black shorts black

short is not a bad

idea red with a black animal symbol on

the

front I recognize

this this might be from

somewhere that's not another dragon has

a twoed

Phenix is it

Phoenix no it's two-headed

eagle de

Dragon I know it's not a dragon but it

was the the this flag I was thinking of

when I said the red red one with a black

dragon well here's a red one with the

black well

Eagle even

wor

[Music]

well you know what's worse if you don't

know what thing it

is right

[Music]

yeah that's good

enough do wait too

minute is there

everything is not sure what that come

from well I guess I keep that one

because that's from the other

one looks like a mess first clean it

up

I kind like

but if you're going to do rad with a

[Music]

[Music]

bird

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

by

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

yeah I've been a bit quiet I

guess I'm

[Music]

sorry

yeah it's okay how much did

I Miss

though anyway cling far

asent CU using the same texture so by

removing I get that

love

need cuz I got got so much free

space but I couldn't move

[Music]

part I been quiet too yeah let's

um let's talk about something

like hey red are you still

here this I don't

know wanted to invite him into some

conversation

for

H what am I

doing yeah it's exported so let's import

it here it's all of this

stuff what happened to

me

no

[Music]

and

talk about Einstein's series of

Relativity you really find that in

interesting einin theory of

relativity wasn't that

just the

initial concept

of the idea and

then it has since

AED

so I don't need it actually on way need

more

space change

leave like

this so let's do the actual unwrapping

of the clips then apparently they are

one all over the place

and but we press on ramp they are

all over

[Music]

please they might be

more reasonable this supposed be short

they don't look

like there are other unwrapping Master

nights cylinder

projection

happen something happen

[Music]

bit this is Weir why it dis

play

um

[Music]

keep wait why doesn't it show up show

something like

that okay here it does

show

weird weird

Weir

[Music]

anyway back back to us well what I was

doing

doing

doing a lot of chat

messages

we could talk about

food

food I'm probably make burgers today as

[Music]

well always making

[Music]

burgers

[Music]

there you go it's

[Music]

[Music]

strength what's pon pon

sexuality breakfast Burgers lunch

Burgers dinner Burgers yeah but it was

breakfast

cereal lunch

Burger andon it's

bur

[Music]

all

yeah a lot of B this is quite bad for me

like compared to what I otherwise would

[Music]

do

[Music]

[Music]

I me

again um

[Music]

s

262 for I'm happy for everyone

following this makes me so happy when I

see any

following and they come in here and

like

funny

yes

I'm trying to think of if I have a

favorite

food favorite

food but you probably

sausage

I mean sa is more like a like most of

things a lot of

food like sausage can be really

handing but maybe like

the that's say my is whatever feel like

anything at time

[Music]

yeah

oh yeah saus is the

best the whole

category must be they must have multiple

different sausages do you like them more

maybe you like them in general and

that's first statement

then

like I could add a print to

the and here we

go is I want to

like the same with the shorts because

the shorts doesn't even look like

shorts

[Music]

where s like an option

[Music]

to get in

there

they look like a type of

shirs

monic

[Music]

shorts that are

very

very tiny

[Music]

maybe

[Music]

this

[Music]

is cuz this is the back side it looks

worse maybe that's

[Music]

fine really wish it was like a softer

mode I can do

like

this oop def

s

[Music]

ding

not sure I should say it on stream

regardless of plus

stream

what what I'm now curious what what

[Music]

what you mean

[Music]

like

okay boot the shorts was that so

dangerous to

[Music]

say I

mean just

[Music]

strength

see exactly what kind of H clothing that

is and it doesn't seem to be any

consistent

[Music]

design which I guess goes with a lot of

terms people aren't consistent what the

qu cring a bit

[Music]

this

[Music]

but yeah that was considering everything

else you have said on stream I'm not

sure why you didn't want to say that all

the

[Music]

things

[Music]

what said because of she

[Music]

said

[Music]

[Music]

yeah I don't know if this is

good it

[Music]

work

[Music]

popcorn for

princess the princess would be very

happy if he C if you served her

[Music]

popcorn know the Swedish wonderful

[Music]

[Music]

popcorn I guess

the very question is do you know the

pronunciation of this mission

[Music]

[Music]

m

[Music]

[Music]

so where should I place

this in to be

[Music]

caning music with sound of cold

wind

that's when I feel at

home okay let me take the reference uh

text here uh what this bik is one I'm

replacing and so this would

be okay piure see export and then I'll

import it

here so I'll switch to another

[Music]

one oh look he

D then

change Captain

B makes it easy

me let's swap it out

[Music]

here

now here we go here has all the free

space going to get another rink be right

back okay

okay my

again

come on guys go

[Music]

deep

just me stuff

maybe i

s i that

[Music]

compar with a p pun

B yeah good

prob 5%

[Music]

s

[Music]

okay let's see that's the

front so they are so they kind

be Ming around

here this is just WR

way

[Music]

[Music]

sh

[Music]

like

[Music]

that

[Music]

texture here we Havey

clothes

go

[Music]

Yeah so basically thinking

that's 2 hours in this outfit already

Place 1 hour first outfit 2 hours

already on this outfit I'm

done I'm not done

[Music]

yet

up is

back that means that the party can

started

wait party can

starty

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

the

[Music]

party so uh so starty is uh

as PR more representation of parties in

[Music]

general so I was thinking of like this

but I'm not

p pink and blue might not look

good

this St

Pi

yeah maybe maybe

[Music]

not

[Music]

what do you say do you think pon pon

should wear pon pon the dog I will

change the

ears what El it should I change other

than ears I

[Music]

guess which doesn't mean I have to

repair the head somewhere somehow

because I put Hol for the

ear

[Music]

[Music]

go and

then close

guess oh I see these colors I like these

colors well I guess you see them up

to but I didn't make sense to the

comment yeah I was thinking of pastel

colors but I don't know it just didn't

look as SC as I

[Music]

hoped so maybe I should go with stronger

pink and

[Music]

and

[Music]

black well here's the Sleep shop

answer doesn't have idea emo p

p

[Music]

[Music]

well here's

the I didn't click

there you feel like emop P would have

ears up oh why is

[Music]

that we need AIC Dr yeah

exactly yes go but I just feel like

it go

okay I guess I guess

that's not a bad

idea I guess that should be added the

list of outfits I can have so you can

redeem this go P Pon whenever you feel

like

probably just adjusted

this B

good this form this shape of

[Music]

it this Swit work shape is

form yeah think more

form cuz it form something into a shape

or be a form does make

sense but something takes a form so yeah

there we go B it toward don't think

people usually use that way or

like

this

like form take shape

[Music]

[Music]

yeah maybe something like sh hair or Ro

Mark I think you should post that on

case

I yeah there thing which you all know

about but I say again someone else might

not be here someone else might be here

who doesn't know but eh it seems like

everyone here is on the server

already got server got a topic on the

server where you can suggest out for p

Pon if you don't know where how to find

it just let me

know so you can add GH pon pon

preferably with like a reference

image

oh no p in too much sugar

again becoming H

bad she

bad

[Music]

someone needs to hide the sugar yeah

prer I would e a lot of

sugar just

digging going

soon get all the sugar for

me and nothing for

you

[Music]

I'll put both P this that sounds

[Music]

good what I think I think of Mora

Adams mortia

Adams like which in

car Nation is

that is that

cost I mean I guess it's gos inspired I

don't feel I search for

gos because I get stuff that is much

more

cost I guess it's more like cost I

change it's it's more

like I'm getting more of a vampire

feeling I guess guess they're not too

far from each

other well thank you

for adding the suggestion I mean even if

you just add a text without the

reference is done like something I can

look up

later and find something I like it might

not exactly how you imagine in in that

case but if you do add a reference I can

try to go something more like the

reference

just because did you know I can't reach

your

[Music]

mind and I might also not be very

well knowledged in the area like go like

I know about it

but doesn't I don't really know what

exactly counts as what or what kind of

elements of it that people

[Music]

like did

you wait where did

you oh oh you

post you posted the wrong

place oh you're not in this

I did that work cuz you put it in memes

he's just going to get drown

out I have a

specific uh thread I think think it's

called where the POS the post goes what

outfits goes that's the one I will go

through so don't like write too much in

it there's a few

conversation try to avoid it so C you

know there we go there they on and yeah

feel free to add any additional notes

like the yes like you wrote in the chat

and just that that's one

very did I press the wrong button press

the wrong

button you want that too I

guess I guess that's fair

enough very round dress first one

another one very short

dress yeah you you like you like a with

a very short t

for no particular

[Music]

reason I move them good thank you I

appreciate

it is a bit

easier or a lot

easier so I don't miss it or like going

around whole

one I

don't who sent this because I'm not

going to remember who suggested but it's

too many suggestions

already I appreciate I mean you

get but what you get out of it is to see

p Pon in out

so who's watched Al family knows mortia

Go game is second know sleep on the

floor hello P why are you sleeping on

the

floor is it because I've Ed him before

I'm sorry I was

so I was so into everything else is

going on here so I missed you I'm

sorry

you can sleep on Pon pom's ears that's

no problem so many go dresses for p

p l has been here

for 7 minutes 8 minutes

already sleep on or that's a good that's

a good resting

spot the

pets

it's pon pon ears

oh pon pon

ears

[Music]

okay

[Music]

so that's how you want to be

then iix

it

[Music]

actually this one

came I don't need to follow on this but

I do

it cuz that's who I

am head pets

everywhere and

hug such a

nice whome

[Music]

Community you can have a nice aesome

Community despite having a what some

people consider and hot

funny

yeah I got a few options I'll probably

try to

mix uh what outfits I make don't make

same

out I guess

ack because to not fill

up the redeems with like

to not have an outfit for every redeem

wait that makes no sense to not have a

redeem for every outfit there we go

that's what I wanted to say because

there will be a lot of redeems which I

mentioned

before how I

want and basically a text input

redeem and then I guess a document

somewhere listing every

outfits but it will list every outfit

there too I

guess post

check

corly my

position and

[Music]

hydrates

therefore enies there needs to be terms

for each

outfit preferably something

short so if there's too many outfits

like of the same type it can be tricky

to come up with how you would

even refer to

them well find the

[Music]

way

and as far as I've seen on other streams

particularly what stream you

can when when when are made one after

another even if the redeems are

completely unrelated to each other you

can still have them que

[Music]

up which what I had issue with his uh

booping redeem because it by default

queued up after the outfit changing

redeem was over and then it

[Music]

played so yeah so having the outfit C

option

not where it get you

[Music]

now I do

want doesn't

matter right maybe

maybe

no

[Music]

noticeable okay and another the sh

[Music]

here

[Music]

and I also realized that first time

around I copied over these shapes and

this time around I just remade

[Music]

them

okay let me copy this

time let me I need the

[Music]

[Music]

permissions

[Music]

something like

that yeah

that's

I said this

today was possibly going to be short I'm

not sure going

short that's

prob I want to show him like

that guess it the last

thing down the close just doing

the effects

here and then let's see if I can make

the

ears don't know if I should change

anything

place okay so not that this has to be a

dog it could just be P Pon with a

different outfit but hello toxic SL tur

coin and I hope everything is taking

care of the house oh that was not what

you WR I hope everyone is taking care of

their house because if you not I'll be

doing it for you oh well um my house

isn't the best at mod can you come and

take

care let

offer

like

that I think that's correct a very

strange

shape well let's export this as uh the

height

map but

welcome toxic slime turquoise what's

your ni name toxic

or slime or turquoise if it even is

Turco that's just my guess I think

turquoise sounds

[Music]

started okay

so I got

the this

[Music]

done pressing the wrong

button

again

close here the

I

beautiful and let's test them

out and see how they look on the

m so we just load it up here and then

we

well let in here I

need

open noral

uneven here maybe I should this one oh

it's so bad so

bad inside head yeah this part is so

bad the other part were

fine this part is fine this is

[Music]

fine well this is

fine think should be same here

too so let's

do that then I'll get rid of this

seam oh I had a seam

there

[Music]

good

hopefully

so

I should be able to do that deleting

those so I keep those back just in case

I don't Che

mying the box of

popcorn okay because you never said

anything about this before I the Swedish

word for popcorn is

popcorn

go wa it it's here supposed to be

one that's the one I'm Miss

see

[Music]

[Music]

oh I went too

far oh was supposed to be

here whoops

see

[Music]

[Music]

now it is great let see I'm doing the

same again

[Music]

no I wasn't I

was

there

there

[Music]

next okay that should make

it the strongest

[Music]

one and if I need I can also make

it

[Music]

definitely

[Music]

s spaghetti for the

[Music]

princess this I might be happy

with and now we can switch over here and

refresh

oh now it doesn't have this over line

and

then

[Music]

yeah it's

better why does it feel like these sles

are strong

ah it's

okay no it's not okay

[Music]

oh now I know

[Music]

way that doesn't do

anything this

does

that explains what's going

on and I also forgot to do this on this

anyway

so

well bons bza

[Music]

welcome just making M here but it's fine

e it

f sa it over once

more and

then come and find me come

and yeah this should be better I

see no did I did it

[Music]

correctly cuz this seem is very

missible

f

but you think

yeah

switch Let

me refresh

this 100% ctif

minute show

you show them moment it happens

[Music]

sometimes so what this map do I'll show

you I forgot to show you but I'm show

this

time there we

go as people see has a bit more texture

into it I guess but see bit more

interesting it's plain

flat don't guessing just here to VI

alone this sounds good I hope you like

the musical

Vibes and the Beautiful Vibes going on I

know what you map does but that black

and white one I mean the black and white

one is the UN map I think my normal map

maybe the black and white map is the

height map which I use to generate on

normal

map and a UV map is what defines where

the polygons reads from and does not

have any itself does not have any

defined effects just we get all the time

straight

here get all the time straight

creepy we realiz one on

the in here I should have deleted

these

[Music]

unnecessary poons that

exist weird

one I just need to way I way to f up

this wish I would use this head

[Music]

for let's go C hands for

now yeah definitely don't need anything

of this

thank

you there we go that's just a

[Music]

h oh what a mess yeah

sometimes

[Music]

sometimes it's a bit messy but all

things as

all count once someone can to if it

hasn't or not is there is there a reason

for

that because not only does the countdown

to when ants are

playing

not only does

it while inform me that ads are upcoming

and which is quite useful but it also

has a quick snooze button so I can just

push them back a bit I can't of course

push them back in definely there's only

a certain amount

so inde definitely I don't think that's

how e see to

word

definitely INF Infinity well the Swedish

word is

w when Le which just means end Le it

means no

end just continues

[Music]

forever

I don't need to be this

py

part something

saying do to exra stuff that I don't

need

[Music]

to

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I

where pay this attention to that

now that's

weird like orang names

thank you for thinking I'm a

[Music]

Cy this is only P not not everything

I haven't heard anything you mention

about face muscle

missing oh

yeah I'm not sure

why why that happened anyway yes I'm

just

um

that's not been going

for why I do

this I could just do

this

I don't know what I said

I a tour of her ears because I'm going

ears

friend the music to

chill hope it isn't putting people to

sleep oh yeah that's why I want to use

mirror as I

can I only need to do one side not both

sides match by

distance and

there I

went wish I could make coffee I could

really EAS

it if only there was a solution

for but of course a the solution in most

scaning only cleaning clean someone

else's mess mess

mesh cleaning I can do clean off someone

I

Wasing too

wait

except the SK sinking full I can't use

the trickiest

part

[Music]

here

I
