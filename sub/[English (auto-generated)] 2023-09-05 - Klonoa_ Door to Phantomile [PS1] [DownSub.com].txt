welcome

longest message so hard

the text is so tiny

I might need to make the emails even

smaller but there's that many of them

so

here's where I left up the game is quite

quite on the screen

I don't remember if it was passed out

last stream

which the music has designed to not play

because this sound has five seconds down

so currently

I'll try to find the missing character

and then we'll see if I need to get like

a sink

it could be wrong but I think you should

get like 100 gems

behind the backwards waterfall the

kingdom jackpot this is the last one

but I'll still try to collect these gems

[Music]

I think that doesn't give you any gems

well there are gems here

as far as an average is one nothing

there

or maybe this exactly one okay let's

keep cutscenes and maybe there is

exactly 100 gems per level or something

wouldn't that be annoying

this enemies don't drop anything

oh that was close

oh nice cylinder he's running

here was one of the

speedrunning techniques

hey sweet works perfect okay you use

less rabbits next time nah nah

that's that's old enough to you

what do you think it's from there's

nothing here

I mean that would be rude to put

something there today

hey let me out of here

[Applause]

oh yeah I need

I need to die this far

squish

no no no

please please get me out of me

I need it for this thing

there you go

[Music]

see if I can get 100 gems I just count

the stuff from serious things could be

wrong

it wouldn't make sense where it started

Sierra

[Music]

I moved out of rabbits okay

weapons

squishy fishy oh yeah nothing else in

here

make sure it gets everywhere hey where

are you going

oh look

this one in the distance it's drowning

[Music]

there's nothing here

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

but this is how I do it

[Music]

well taking damage

[Music]

hey you didn't record one James perfect

round on the second half of this time

that would be

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

no no

well I got pushed out to the other side

again it's nothing there that is takes

but as far as I can see he doesn't

despawn them at a distance

get systems

promise

all right you have no wait I don't

because I can't go through here

[Music]

I really like the music in this game

I mean oh no there was no enemy say okay

it was only that at me okay

listening okay what love is crazy

it was a bit easier than I thought

never have a nice scene

yeah I'm not sure what happened there

more than anything

okay let's see if we can get this

there we go 100 gems

foreign

[Music]

oh yeah I needed to

wait a minute

[Music]

there was nothing else there are some

gems but

[Music]

[Music]

yes practice making my skills you know

and then damage anyway

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I oh is this part actually part of the

level I think but I still have to do

this

okay let's do this then

the fish yes

whatever the name was

[Music]

okay wrong

with that side

from

oops

I mean I did press attack but

there we go that was very early I think

almost missing

go go Kyle

[Music]

the fish

because this species have a name or

something

what is the bubble being attack thing

there it is

[Music]

summoning this fish with a lot of

attacks

they're both supposed to be the good

guys

no I think damage again

run attack me

I did it

[Music]

I have no idea what happens if you

decide to die after you're winning

before saving but I did not find the

last

with me now

[Music]

anyway

[Music]

goodbye

well yeah I need another one please

[Music]

and we're here

[Music]

so does it always

yeah I think I think what it does with

that counter thing

is that it fills it out in this specific

order it doesn't matter which one you

pick up

if you're missing one it's always butter

on the right that is missing

because I don't think I ever hadn't pull

out the water and

considering that was one of the first

one zombies

[Music]

apparently

[Music]

I'll do my way

nothing on my way

and then go to go I already have 79 in

the right body look still picking up

games

and I did a double gem thing

but like I needed some practice

tonight

I feel like I need some

98. I only got 98. Steve from an extra

knife

prefer

is um

games where you have individual levels

[Music]

right I'm for example not

okay

as a big fan oh excuse me

of an engine of spider I still take 2D

games because because it's spiral

sometimes the chemicals hips

continuous story with

connected levels and stuff that's not

really my style

Express from ads

this level

let me just get one out wait where's no

I can't destroy that one but they are

the same

that was the scene

but wait now I can

all right now

[Music]

okay

now let's talk about the INR content in

the best way oh and I can't destroy

nothing then

Shane

I want the scams

the panther I'm not allowed to take them

okay

I have satisfied with these two gems

instead 150

thank you

yay

remember there's 150 gems

and it's just pretty

I mean it doesn't prove it to just

imagine you get 150 champions for the

2011. but I've not gotten more than 15

gems and this was exactly 150 gems

and how many times can I say 150 gems

time

[Music]

[Music]

keep changing for him no damage can I do

it probably not but I'll try

this part that is tricky one

[Music]

yeah here it comes

nope

I must can't make that

[Music]

again

everything is yellow and as you know

this boss does not like yellow for some

reason

he I mean he's red and yellow so why

doesn't he like yellow

color that dislikes but

I'm going to pretend wow

I'm going to pretend it is

it is the color

I guess

he just unfocused

[Music]

something like I got that one from too

far away

now it's changing form again

yellow is cheap prank me

if they have a leveling effect or

something

[Music]

all right

[Music]

well wow

I wasn't prepared for both hands being

affecting

[Music]

oh he jumped up into me

I died

he died of self-preservation

[Music]

there we go he has stopped doing that

it's yellow now

yeah take a bunch of damage

[Music]

over there on the way over there

[Music]

take that

you

all right

no don't run away

[Music]

there we go in his butt

or on your family

I mean in a room that was painted yellow

it's kind of annoying color I mean a

real nice kind of orange colored

at the moment

celebration

all right let's get everyone though

and I got 150 gems

yeah there you go

there's extra

oh yeah oh oh yeah yeah yeah

150 is definitely I think

that's annoying

well a better man get going then

I mean

[Applause]

[Music]

Breeze gain the wind Village

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

yes

that bonus level

has nothing that shows complete

percentage

so I'm just going to do everything that

the game considers helping this or like

showing a change of some sort

[Music]

that's enough

[Music]

there we go

and one more

this is why the game should have counted

the

before

probably this one

[Music]

let's start music ever again

[Music]

it's fine at least I can do like

checkpoint and we try something that's

why I should have

extra lives I can die

salad is an option restart from last

checkpoint

the first

you can get me everything

[Music]

same thing gems whoops can't stay

collected like inspired

there's a double gem thingy

and you have to be successful with the

double GMC

that's probably going to see if it's

annoying

so I got hundreds

in our safety count we could just count

over 100 elements

[Music]

so like sure it can have two digits than

normal gameplay but when you go into

this mode you could switch over to

showing CDs

back here

[Music]

yeah

that should be all of the gems there we

go 150. whoa whoa I got all these games

what happens if it gets more than 115.

we're starting to be a challenge

sometimes

I got all the gems

[Music]

that's a rescued on well thank you again

for telling me there's nothing else

those are stems that's correct camera

and that's the figure for 130 something

that's a blue gem 115. next vision

That's Why They Call Visions because

this is all a dream

the diva and the dark spirit

this is a problem my aesthetically most

favorite level in the game

and do you think the music does fit it

[Music]

that's only James

I guess yeah there's no gym here

[Music]

and

takes way too long to reach that time

before they can't count it to still be

active so I would count that as getting

all the double gem gems

2015 all levels and you unlock money

back yes

[Music]

for college 950 chance

you get you get

female clanor

[Music]

glow here yeah

[Music]

[Applause]

I think that was only gems

[Music]

and

not having a cc honesty

laughs

[Music]

kind of remembering

which class I was supposed to take

is

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

this one contains James

[Music]

on a for now

okay let's see

[Music]

yeah it's supposed to have to do that

[Applause]

I think that's what we should do it

[Music]

because I still need to destroy this and

the gems it drops will despawn if I take

too long so

certainly those don't count stress the

double Jam but what happens if I do

manage to

foreign

you should be able to at some point

get to gems even intended ticket

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

Point

[Music]

rabbit thingy spitting

yeah

spiky bones

rabbit Singh is seeing with spiky balls

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

exactly

[Music]

is so empty

it feels like it should be tempting

wasn't it

in fact they they

accidentally wasted all the gems

previously in level and they're like oh

we all we are we have this whole

whole level left here without any gems

but we can't place anymore

[Music]

I don't really think that took damage

from a small minion

what what are we doing

there we go

[Music]

what am I doing

[Music]

it's a good question

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

I'm exploding

when this one because I told you to is

that why Drake

[Music]

should I win it only because you tell me

to

I don't know maybe I should lose in that

case

whoa

yes because you told me to

where there's a reference of your belly

tell me the reference I don't remember

Maybe

[Music]

someone here none of this

oh

[Music]

No No One's Gonna See okay

[Music]

[Music]

Okay so

extremely avoid

[Music]

I want to break that

maybe I just have to be really cool

[Music]

it's been a driver gemstone yeah and I

can't get any more gems from that

and there you go

I think I did it

I think I did it correctly there

it's not

did it correctly

different outfits for fun fun

no like

a bunny suit

[Music]

all right okay I need to check

everything

you play SpongeBob with a picture of you

Jonah I can't change that was that was

definitely what I said right

I got you

this is speed training oops I wasted it

can I come later in my technology

[Music]

over there

[Music]

let's see and then it should be a very

short double

gem segment here

I got it possible no no

I got it it's been short pretty easy

[Music]

to start your flight

yeah and of course it's still going to

be routines to changing quantum's outfit

but I was thinking about just having one

redeem and then you just type what you

want the outfit to be

and then it would you do like

figure out what you're referring to your

context

[Music]

nothing man well it will basically have

if you if it if it direct I want it for

that but I think that if it if it

recognizes your

input it will change the outputes and

that's happened to the appearance when I

pushed it into working

[Music]

let's see if I can do that again

even to do anything special

yeah if you recognize your input it's

going to change your location

and then take your points if it does not

recognize your input it's going to

refund from you

that's a plan at least

and hopefully I can set it up there

again

[Music]

pretty easy

now back to this thing

oh yeah I need

I need

this to first get up

[Music]

good thing I didn't hit it that would be

annoying if I T and then no I wasn't

thick enough

okay

you're weird that would be an

unrecognized request

all the things he said

all these things she said runs through

my head running through my hand one of

the things he said this is not enough

this is not enough okay that would be

out so

um you know

wait how do you say what like running

through your head what would

what what kind of like

I'm trying to think here and this is my

Swedish exercise because I know the

expression but I don't know if there's

equivalent expression in Swedish

they might be struggles just at the

moment trying to figure out how to

Swedish expresses myself English

expressions

yeah this this thing can't help me with

what the

what's the expression would be in

Swedish

it gives like

literal

no I didn't want to do that

it means you can't stop seeing him yeah

yeah yeah

but I don't think this uh

foreign

so

I think I

have to fame

this one

yeah and I know and knowing you how you

Dow that would be expressed

I tried to find something but sadly I

couldn't find something but

oh well

I press helicopter I think

I faint

[Music]

we need them again

helping out with that

was also why you can't Farm gems from

the big ones that's obviously there'll

be an infant number of games

Swedish but there is no lyrics in

Swedish it's an English song and it's

also in Russian though I guess maybe

and

[Music]

me

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

yes look at this

[Music]

oh yeah the timing door is here we don't

go

[Music]

celebration

I really do wonder if that was the

correct way of doing it because we did

double jumping I only got three times

with

what

it does not feel great

it feels like I should be able to pick

up more gems with you

[Music]

I don't see I'm seeing

[Music]

I hope that was the correct name of

Sharon but let's see two times bonus yep

okay

[Music]

there's some other gems okay so now this

Festival right

now

that was going back

41 more

[Music]

and certainly I I it must be at least

one more game because it might be an

older

I know I love the phone

thank you

[Music]

give me the last one yes

at least I got all the gems that man so

these are way too far away

[Music]

the next thing is

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

games

that means I can bring up

yeah yes I mean I don't have to

[Music]

really small reaction still do it again

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

okay

[Music]

I did it

no sir I I should be able to pick up six

more gems

with the double singing then in that

case somehow somewhere someone

okay

[Music]

so

interesting

yeah it's definitely another 13 you're

getting

first thing

why is

that one off right so okay

in different term

so I need to

not pick up games around that area or

something

okay this is gonna be tricky

[Music]

and we have these you know like outside

this area

but

[Music]

this is out here

but

oh yeah I'm supposed to pick up those

but that's nine that's not six that

would reception we have a few minutes

but yeah sure

I'll try it

[Music]

I'll try it

[Music]

I was supposed to go again

[Music]

and let's pick that up I should pick it

up

yeah I need the key from here

[Music]

where to go good question yeah this this

level

this level is something in Orange

[Music]

I should have taken

and leave it away

[Music]

okay

[Music]

I'm hungry

one

and not

[Music]

welcome oh I got it

[Music]

fastest

so

always oh I see I see you know what

maybe the double thing is meant

[Music]

to not collect those three maybe they

forgot about those three it's just those

six you supposed to call it

[Music]

why don't you see we'll see if it works

if my idea works one of us at least die

now why didn't I get those this time

yeah that works

but

but that's not fun I wanted to get all I

want to get more than 150.

I'm trying to get past this I can fall

down and die

you have food somewhere just too too

nice to cook right now

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

that's why I ended up with sticks 15 not

nice

[Music]

there we go

well I did it

I got too many gems

well now I just need to complete the

normally then

[Music]

that's that's quite a celebration I got

too many jams

[Music]

seconds

all right I need activated

the interest

yeah okay yeah I need it first

[Music]

to get over here so I can activate

and then I can you see this show

headache

let me find out if I could start a thing

anyway

maybe you can maybe I'll just missed it

hey

[Music]

also I it required me tonight for the

rest of the stream and I don't want to

leave

I'm gonna cook so long

you've got two Penny gems yeah I wonder

what's gonna happen now

[Music]

well the gaming include will the campus

stop 550 what will happen

[Music]

probably not the impression thing

it is possibility account that we stop

at 150 maybe not the India in-game

counter but the level let's count too

much stuff at that

can get you saved out of it pretty

corrupted something right now

[Music]

that's thirsty

ignorance me get an exactly

[Music]

no I need you again

[Music]

he's running

[Music]

[Music]

prediction one that stops at 152 game

questions three kind of doesn't know

what's this play I mean it should be

able to be there 115.

but yeah

don't worry

[Music]

it gives me a different game

even though there's a blue and green

[Music]

[Music]

but I got 100 gems now

[Music]

this room is too small to bring an

enemies here

[Music]

foreign

wait

why is that eat an apple tree

I mean if it differs are kind of

floating behind the trees but still

I mean it is possible you can just give

it to an apple apple tree and just munch

on the apples without actually picking

it off but it's kind of weird

[Music]

yeah let's just say that heart but this

time when I got you

[Music]

Christmas

[Music]

got two

now I guess

nine

[Music]

this oil is lining very funny this

outfit has a bunch of gems

oh yeah here we go

[Music]

wait

this doesn't make any sense

we got 150 gems now

[Music]

I heard that that way that was missing I

had 12 to 2 last time why what happened

here

yeah what is possible

the first three gems I picked up they

might not have counted as doubles

because they were never meant to be

doubled that's possibility

[Music]

someone has to go back and check the

recording there

[Music]

symmetry

thank you

all right even if it's not the first

three it might be just that that double

is coded to only give me a double for

nine gems in a point

[Music]

[Music]

[Applause]

oh

[Music]

Mountain jumper now I jumped off

[Music]

and

[Music]

work was supposed to say off

of moving around here around on them

now all the time away

[Music]

yeah kind of a different

I think there's some different

situations

[Music]

if if the situation for you to save the

world

requires you to run on the comment about

your work

I think I think that's about the

exception

[Music]

no I wasted the enemy finally that's it

for me

[Music]

thank you

I was going to do that big thing

[Music]

no it destroyed it anyway try to save it

[Music]

again

oh perfect jump

[Music]

that was jumped so nice

wasted enemy must be having a good day

or about everything why he's wasted

I wasted the enemy

[Applause]

[Music]

I probably have to go back

regarding the uh

jumping

because I have no idea how that worked

not how did it become 150 at the end

anyway

because when I got to double thing

because I picked up those okay I picked

up those nine gems

too early

and then next time I and then blood left

those three M's I picked up the Three

Gems with the double double GMC

and then at the end of the level I had

38 38 means I'm missing

when and 12 minutes I had to pick up six

new Jets

[Music]

as far as my ma

peace

[Music]

oh

[Music]

this time I got those three gems lasted

the action the nine actually dance which

is posting it

so I have no idea what's going on

[Music]

why I ended up with 1050.

no because when I collected the

at the end there

the the gems perfectly ended with

didn't you see when I was collecting the

final gems out

the company never stopped it was never

like

I couldn't connect 151 if I have this

first time it was now

it just for some reason

it somehow worked out

and it doesn't make any sense

you haven't really seen something

[Applause]

[Music]

on bottom area

that I have no idea how that works

oh

[Music]

now I need to go and die

[Music]

Apparently one time because there's no

bottomless people

can

the only thing I can think of how that

works is that

the girls yes

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Applause]

I don't know what's going on

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

last time

Double Diamonds

[Music]

there finally

[Music]

Mr greens welcome Mr greens

and the tits was not spicy in your name

two spices Yep they're ruthless

[Music]

apparently they can which is coming hint

it would be annoying there were like

three of them

there we go another blue gem well I

guess I'll just continue

games playing in hard mode apparently

the four arms coronia Temple of the Sun

thank you

coronia

let's let's go with you greens what were

you doing today even though it's not

very

That was supposed to check the yellow

one

[Music]

um

[Music]

are you like them peace

wait for me he's just been found so just

to get back

if you change your mind

[Music]

don't waste my steak

I don't like you

okay but

[Music]

there you go you can activate it

I think that's the point

point point

it's one of two of them

all right and wait I need one of those

[Music]

last time I did the yellow pass

some reason I could go back

you'd have known of the other part

allows me too wait that can't go first

this is huge drop game

[Music]

remember

plenty of birds

no no it's not now

come on time for you to die

that's that same word try

how am I supposed to do

foreign

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

form

I have to return anyway

the yellow one has been returned I've

already got 53 cents

I've only got a third of the gems

might have to be fair a few of them was

shared between the green and yellow five

so if you divide up in six sections I've

done two six that means one third so I

guess it makes sense that I got one

third of the gym so far

[Music]

and now

I'm going to do the remaining

[Music]

Parts here which is the third fast

that means that I've done three six

what's known

we'll see if they Jam count is out

[Music]

the music

come here come here

ready

[Music]

yeah and then I go here second

select this one

and then I can go back

and go through that door

Cupid

You Know The Enemy is a stone that warms

and Community never finds something

exactly where to go in order to find the

whole confidence of them but yeah I did

comment on that yesterday but yes

that is very considerate of them

no no no

they're starting marching

[Music]

hello everyone

no when he turned into Ash

ES

[Music]

[Music]

yeah it is destroyed their armor and

then like oh well

I guess I don't have armor anymore

okay

squishy squish

[Music]

got the green orbital eternity

immediately so now I got a 75 is half I

got 82 that's kind of hard this stuff

checks out

now to do two parts here

that would be fun afternoon

wait a minute

[Music]

oh I must miss the comments Maybe

you were away maybe you were lurking

although I was kind of quiet when I said

it

maybe maybe I'm still spoken so maybe it

is

this is what I'm supposed to go

I'm so silly

[Music]

so past one done

and that's two

this is somehow easier than me

but this is the first one right that's

the missing polygon now it has appeared

but the next part is the chicken

wow

[Music]

all right

wow

okay that's why I was wondering where I

was supposed to kill

I can hear you fine the enemies

expression doctors turn to armor what

the well I guess that's that

I wouldn't say that's an expression way

sorry about that

they look pretty happy to me

foreign

[Music]

yeah

I mean with you but

where's my enemy

so that's quite stiff and I got and wait

what's

yes I should have 125 now

I guess it's a bit I guess the red and

blue paths are longer

they're all the higher higher yeah

let me turn into an orbital and we see

I wish it was that easy

[Music]

that's clearly you can't bring enemies

to it with you

to the Next Room

[Music]

no

no point over that bird is

the anime

[Music]

it is

yeah

I need to thank you then

you will leave this time fish

[Music]

they told me I could be anything so I

became

blue ball

so then my game blue

Orange

yeah there must be a section

[Music]

oh no

I know

I need an enemy

to me and then nothing is moved out of

the way

I was doing a bird no we need to destroy

my buried

[Music]

here we go

let's find it now and pass as much as I

can do

hope that was great because there's also

beans

which is fine so let's see if I'm

missing oh

yeah

I'll see him from missing five again

10 at the moment

and

hopefully there are 10 more gems prepare

for a bit too blue

in this exit

all right this one I think you need to

restart what

[Music]

no

I refuse to restart it

now I'm missing attention but why where

did

that's interesting so I can used it

I haven't seen 10 years from

[Music]

where do I get things

yeah we confused now

felt like I did the whole level

the last the yeah but where do I get

10 games

even if I do no but how am I supposed to

get

every gem

[Music]

but even if I do double of all gems I'm

going to end missing five games and then

anything yeah but that was only five

gems unless you're going to say that

there wasn't five gems that was five

games which I did pick up the double

would give me five additional gems from

those games that still leaves me

too little

what is the last five gemstones

so I mean plus I have the time is too

short to do this I don't I don't think

it's possible to do

see I don't know where

I don't know when it lost 10 gems far

and I don't know how I should do the

double

um section and get all of the gems that

seems very hard

I'm almost impossible even

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

yeah

I can't go through this one section

no come here

[Applause]

[Music]

coin

um

all the time

now what did you die of

[Music]

now

let's Chuck you

but I did fire right here

[Music]

of course of course this is the low

visual thing and

it is

51 minutes I I guess that's the moment

because it's a hot level therefore needs

to be hot I mean cool down

[Music]

sorry I ate all cookies yesterday

all of them

I'm out of cookies

so everything is

not like that

[Music]

nope I guess I just have to fry the cat

no yep

squish squish

[Music]

yeah I'm pretty sure I got everything

there

41 gems something between section

let me write this down I'm gonna take

notes

[Music]

our enemy became a painting

yep

buckets of not putting in enemies with

you

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

no come down but you're ruining their

routine

now come town

oh I messed everything up

[Music]

weapons

[Music]

yeah yeah I want to be if we can take

that extra camera over there

[Music]

this gem here

that's probably not happening

I don't know

[Music]

dang it

another way of doing it

[Music]

[Music]

after the yellow section yeah yeah no

I got 82 that means I have

a valid additional 41 gems

but that's not that didn't count how

many of the yellow angles again

so the yellow section actually contains

green

sections like less than 45

check out okay let's let's do it

properly

put blue that means that you read in

blue

okay now we're ready

doing some professional notes here's

Christmas stuff immediately

Okay so

that means there's 16 so with this

section okay

let's continue

this is a red section

oh it just jumps really fine

very easier for something

[Music]

like hey there's like a platform named

background

not that you can use for anything

[Music]

okay you can

that's out down you can go back as soon

as you pick this one up now they go up

oh yeah

let's take this checkpoint

how am I supposed to do this

yeah King

I can't take the bird

and like try to

you know what no I can't I can't bring

the bird in here because

as I said there's only five games here

so even if it

[Music]

I guess I can try to go today

tap

nope

apparent Kate

okay

no no

you're even destroying my bird

you cost me harm you destroyed my bird

no no

I guess I guess I'm supposed to do that

but it still leaves me five teams behind

there

he sounds like anything

yeah I mean to be honest

it is China and irritating to fall into

llama

[Music]

all right show you this side is possible

[Music]

it is quite

tricky especially in slice of platform

now

[Music]

um

when you sing foreign

[Music]

just hated when you accidentally

[Music]

there you go

I succeeded in the scene

foreign

[Music]

name someone said animation

listen yeah this time we got the extra

five gems

so now I should end with 145 right and

returning 50. nothing makes sense to me

[Music]

okay okay

yeah but why is that missing fine

when

[Music]

[Music]

it was possible to do that

I'm going back

that was kind of neat I guess

you got me some polygon the polygon is

miss me so you can see the sky

what are those Temps

what are those

I'm not being very

a lot of attention so bye

so if you found a secret

no it was just stiff previous part of

the level

no secrets he ever move on nothing to

see

wish

oh

it's a good time for moved again it was

just waiting there

okay this time I'm not gonna quit

this time of trusting the platform

which

I'm interested in the platform

yep

see that

I think I see something

there it is

the missing

any chance

no let me see fire tips yes

the missing five gems

found the last game

celebration

there you go

damage boosting

oh James have been found all by myself

well we're here

now wait

I need to do this but then I can skip

the cutsy

there we go

buy one done bring nothing

150 chance pound

feeling proud of myself

[Music]

lost a lot of Life there but makes sense

115

only two levels left an extra level of

course it finally doesn't have anything

but actually that does have 150 jumps as

well

oh my

first time 59

minutes 59 minutes and 99 something

I think they went I think they wrote

that incorrectly

anyway moving on

to the Moon Kingdom

the legendary Kingdom Christ the Middle

Kingdom

yeah

[Music]

it's definitely not only live in Sierras

[Music]

this last stuff from the next week
