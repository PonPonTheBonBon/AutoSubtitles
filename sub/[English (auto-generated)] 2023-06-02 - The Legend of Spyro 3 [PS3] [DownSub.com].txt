foreign
nice to see you
some spiraling
somebody
and now
as spider looks weird
Cindy is not happy with spider
and now it's going to be
on the PlayStation 3.
which I'm taking his photos two games
but
now the picture colors it will actually
be good
and healthy ticket
the legend of spiral dawn of the dragons
let's start button I guess it's written
with Captain letters on the controller
so
well
the whole menu navigation here kind of
reminds me
because the previous two games were kind
of static because I did testing game
before
and the whole menu navigation here
really makes me think of like Blu-ray
the whole
menu transitions especially
it doesn't really it doesn't really feel
like a video game main menu
punishment
did you see an enemy in the air
cross
what
if he says
now let's continue the darkest of time
there's always hope
sometimes fear clouds our vision
sometimes our strengths gives out
and yet sometimes when all sings lost
light
light of times through the darkness
and we are reminded that even the
smallest amount of Courage
can turn the tides of War
I never got subtitles
um
if something is happening
oh
[Music]
and the inspire you
[Music]
Spyro stop
I can't
get close to me now
[Music]
cuddle time
what are they doing
and that wasn't the shape
the way it just switches objects to
another object
cuddle time
cozy time
awesome so they kind of rebuild the
whole place
get up
Cinder what happened they look a bit
better all right
it's all a blur yeah me too
heads pounding shh wait
yes I hear it too
for once I wish it was
what are they doing
let's not stick around to find out come
on
look as weird
oh what is your problem
oh this can't be good
video server gameplay starts
how does that work
okay let's start with subtitles
and
I don't know if you should
wait a minute inverse what
camera movement
basic message jump light attacks drunk
arcade I have changed that
Old Triangle to knock everything that
sounds different because that was the
circle before
nice it doesn't work there we go
press L1 to block oh there's a block
finally and while blocking well
and move one left stick it under a
direction to evade because that's in the
and much further as well
[Music]
if I hold that direction
that could be quite useful too
okay so the weight is quite
[Music]
fare together
that's the other thing I was questioning
how can I jump down
so that's grab
right
because
it's going to try and repeat the
oppressed across to jump
okay so that's that okay I see
and when I jumped simply what am I
supposed to use them
okay if I press it again
okay I see I see I see
if I do this
they didn't teach me that part
I can't wait until later
okay later Jason
's uh
I don't know what is this we have to
break this thing it's holding us down
[Music]
hit the Golem's hands oh
I think I should touch that
I think I should touch that too
ah there you go
sh
it does yeah watch out
perhaps touch the internet
right
I'll take the chance thank you
I like stems
from here
that you want me to come up you don't
see
you're not going to fight like that
his chart is so slow
I guess that was down we can't fight it
we'll have to move in unison Follow My
Lead why should you leave uh-oh take
cover
the missing gems okay good idea you lead
I'm good predictions
[Music]
the animations are kind of awkwardness
you should
foreign
but shouldn't we be going unless you
want to wait for that thing to climb
back up I hate to think what it might do
to Sparks
who is he
I don't know all he said was shh you're
making too much noise I like him already
they yes they fly actually fly I mean oh
yeah yeah they're flying they Aspire did
fly in
in the first game the second game did
you ever fly in that one
and when you are doing the uh touching
thing
now it's just just for a sake of
explanation
uh you know you should always Break
Stuff you find
I see got stuff from it
okay so there is nothing more here
and the camera controls are as I like it
the inverse of regulated
okay how pick is this game with thumb
jumping okay it seems to be
yeah I can basically touch them
almost whenever I want
this that is great that was for some
reason I decided to change out the
second game but the first and third
games are much better
Spyro Cinder how do you feel
anything broken
[Music]
but not too badly did you read the books
about them I am relieved
relief I feared I might be too late my
name is Hunter Hunter you've been
tracking me far too long Anthony
tracking we didn't return to the temple
whale
I don't know who that is
foreign
three years
but that's impossible yes I'm sure this
news comes as quite a shock forgive me
for the brevity of my explanation but
this is not the place to account the
missing time
sir for three years they have rebuilt
the temple unless the crystal of the
dragon's bee and left alone or that it
basically put this on a pencil but
apparently press LT to switch between
spire and Cindy okay
captain
okay
basically I see
looks nice the place box Sparks how do I
play Sparks and she replace spiders in
here
today
okay
the difference let's cut a score
okay
[Music]
yeah they can have quite a lot of Health
is that that's not here much
yeah Blair Underwood is hunting this way
follow me
wait well yeah my uh
fees
it's getting closer
testing out stuff
[Music]
what are you doing you're destroying the
place
oh
um you go first Cinder it's safer for me
safer for me Amy quiet you'll give us
away
and you can fly really
I mean
hold eggs
it was a big gap I tried
press
Crush Crush Crush to fly
this crust wildfly the Flappy Wings song
cross and release the light okay that
was a lot of
I should no I need to fly it okay
let's see
so this is up here
did I normally fly upwards and yeah can
you only keep like one elevation
I'll take care of something
15 minutes
[Music]
Maybe
a point position dragons in the purple
light to save the game what that was the
requirement in previous games
create an inspired trademark
data sure why not
say complete old megabyte before I say
let's
why can't I look around property
I wanted to buy give us a moment to
gather our strength
this can get weird
it is fascinating how your kind draws
strength from these crystals dragons are
truly remarkable
yeah you say that now Tillman tries to
kill you and by one I mean her
yeah
I mean it wasn't the previous games
fixed save points anyway because you're
saving our checkpoint progress
that's not how
spiral
that's a real popular dragon
you can wield many abilities that others
cannot
now it is time to awaken these Powers
within you fire
electricity
[Music]
ice
and Earth
Cinder no it was wind
ermaster only a single
[Music]
the darkness
[Music]
fear
wind
and Shadow
so interesting yeah
green gems restore your Mana
I wait so the first game is first breath
in the second game it was magic and in
the third game is Mana
they really can't keep things consistent
do they have
Ozzy
day
[Music]
be careful
RTR attack okay
[Music]
oh
yeah
[Music]
perfect problems don't let them surround
you
[Music]
press defense ignite direction is like
normal okay
well yeah
[Music]
um
wait
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
oh
oh I like ice
uh it's it's it's much worse
is
wait I have an idea
that um
let's be a scared there's some energy
here
[Music]
okay that that is for his plant
hey
okay wins
[Music]
so that's the uh
other use in it I mean
[Music]
I can't see either just use this app
oh yeah
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
this pie doesn't have a number
[Music]
basically so that's the uh oh here's the
moves
either oh that's triangle of course it's
triangle for that that was the thing I
wanted to do before
[Music]
I see
at least you're not having your problem
like last time yeah this is an actual
PlayStation 3 game so it's worth
my Dragon Age I'm gonna try his breath
all right
how about this actually
I see
okay and there are
Armory
um
nothing okay and then element
is the
oh
I
I'm gonna say okay
what do they cross different
at least it gives this game gives raw
numbers for everything which is nice
yeah I was trying to be
it was trying to be God of War yeah
oh yeah wasn't that
these Vines block our path we must get
through
certain elements can be used to destroy
various obstacles okay so I assume
because the Divine you don't use fire
okay
get down with Darkness
the The Taste something do you like it
blue gems increase your experience and
can be used to unlock new abilities okay
[Music]
as it goes
back to share between us but this needs
them
add the Mind Arabs are heavy and limit
your ability to fly okay
but what's the point with it I can carry
it
[Music]
okay
so okay so I place it on a so there will
be so like customs with it
[Music]
I guess
I got something here
if I press to selected electricity
keep on depressed to activate
aspire
hey hey over here
right
okay
to get your energy back
and then
let's gather some more
nothing hidden
it seem to be much happier
man
there you go
I'll keep it
you forget you have to
press three times to fly
Okay so
I need that thing place there to open
the door I see I see
they're going to tell me that now
right
over there
oh my shots and then don't tie
foreign
[Music]
drop it if you're going to die
does it respond
oh it does nice
okay it wasn't bad I wanted to
it this I wanted to do this
okay I can't do it because he wants to
fly too
yeah
what are you doing
okay the
the computer cannot platform okay I'll
get the platforming then if that's if
that's what you want
you can also not use this one
I will I tried
I tried to be smart
wait a minute
that thing is back
no that's I didn't want to pick it up
Magic
there we go hey hey over here
this is some kind of time limits
[Music]
[Music]
okay it worked
okay making progress slowly
so
we must be getting close
it's just a picture so blue on
not really realized it
but yeah
one of the Kings
no it's
I don't know
any of the team lost these things about
you
I guess it's stable now now it's not
it's
because
I don't know what it's doing
okay now it's you know it's very
ah
it's probably exe has started no it's
responding it but just the picture for
me was wrong
okay it actually has stuff responding
because I apparently
um
it's no longer updating the picture
is you all right
oh
so back to
back to the game
this is actually working now oh yeah now
it's working yeah obvious
moment there
yes now it's working
around the head
equal amount
climbing sounds oh they can climb there
yes
yeah
I can't even
seriously what's what is wrong with
someone funny
now now the picture is working press
Circle because he didn't really show me
anything before
is it me or Instagram
sorry I'm picky but
yeah
that's
that was fine I don't know
I guess maybe it's a TV being wrong
and then when Harry travel this
apartment okay but I certainly grab onto
climbing sounds per second against
releases them
there you go
goodbye hunting
real fly over here there's no problem
that was a problem
hmm
they should have you control both both
of them at the same time
questions you know go around on the
other side and clever upon it was that
necessary
like from here
I don't know
ah land
these controls are weird
perfect
Hello Mickey
I am going to a temple
and trying to fight with controls while
at it
oh what a what a view
so
how do you charge
have they forgotten how to run
yeah hi Mickey how are you
my case fine
okay what was the point of this
can't even do anything about this
what's that push it again
okay
I don't know what I'm doing
and what is
preventing flight
I like this
I don't know
okay I see why why I have trouble with
flights
because you don't you don't use
normal
okay like how do how do I
how do I fly ah
that's right work
I'm okay Steve snake
here's the headache but it's okay
oh
and then
I'm glad you're
oh I see I'm not a scene okay let's go
back
let's go back
that's a little hand I guess
they are Aspire why is this
black is limited it's a certain height
because platforming but it's all
but it's stupid
why
like here I can play hi
I fly so high but if I try to fly here
no it just about drops down it makes no
sense why why into this slide and let me
fly around if you're going to restrict
the flight in certain areas that doesn't
make any sense
that is bad game design
I guess that's
okay so much for that idea
thank you
per second to grab around the climbing
set
yes
can I see the Jets moving and I think
this stream is stuck because I refreshed
it and it's still on the same screen
all right this is
oh yeah good thing you said that again
because I'm not really paying attention
to
the hard lips on screen
yeah it's gonna
it's kind of acting out I mean the the
uh
yeah the cash card is not the black can
I fly but you know
this makes no sense at all
yeah this makes no sense
I thought of myself but it's the same on
my phone yeah as long as the chat works
on screen and the stream isn't stuck
it's
and also if I get compound animated uh
then then that would make it even
clearer that is like this stream is in
stock
face
jump on me
[Music]
okay I don't know I have enough to level
up one thing
I haven't really decided what to level
up yet because I haven't really
so those guys are thousand each
okay
it should be reconnected now
yeah
stream is up
am I pretty please
no at least the game is frozen if it's
just a random disconnect actually like a
cable sorry I said
um
[Music]
smash
yeah
I'll try this video
move
stitch in any direction and press press
to jump to distant climbing Stones then
press circles to grab all I need to
I promise this again
so where are you going okay my turn
you can do this spider okay
I started trying
[Music]
[Applause]
to say spider says follow my lead the
first thing you need to switch to the
ceiling hey look out
huh I am right now
trying to be climbing
spider is about to die switch character
yeah oh yeah you can't you can't switch
got a nice stem
I see I see what's coming on oh yes yeah
yeah okay
see spider is smart
yes I said for trash when I forget
[Music]
that's the uh
[Music]
be careful again
seems that you're falling behind
[Music]
oh yeah and you can't you can't climb
there anymore
I want this
[Music]
for your page
in this best dragon seem to this more
powerful than spiral in the game
inspires
weekly
and the Inspire was more powerful than
Cinder in this action game
you have gotten enough experience up
here I mean I mean I did that for like a
while again let's start and select and
now it's just left
like that it's like the elements managed
to use the experience points you have
gathered enough experience ability has
said that president
you just said that
like I have five socks in a 800 I had
like this one but I said I don't know
what I mean yesterday
on the sides on that later
[Music]
with my students
what
[Music]
there you go
I got some time that was the wrong
button
they died
[Music]
do I oh yeah
so I keep the
yeah I wanted to see and Crystal dance
with one just making sure
okay that that was okay but
that's the head up my
[Applause]
[Music]
what happens if one of them dies
the other one has to drag around of
course
I'm doing that
[Music]
I don't like spy feedback
it's literally true oh my God I did that
again
what happens this time
now it's time for video
[Music]
[Music]
it isn't natural that Crystal radiates
with dark magic destroy it quickly
okay
that was was that quick nephews auntie
Elite enemies I haven't bought the
director had missed next for especially
Dynamics hidden oh
this one rice behind what
at the foot of the waterfall
I just need to jump down
it is 100 get hurt behind you
otherwise I want The Dark Crystal I know
a pink Dragon who would want a Dark
Crystal ring
yeah why can't I use this affect
anything and it's this one
okay
say
is it is going to ask me to
create a new safe stuff
yeah it's finally I'll be tired
and exactly then
got it
I guess so
okay
[Music]
in this walls
nicely done
how many fall damage
I'm gonna Pistons
say maybe crystals
might be able to upgrade
she doesn't deserve the Dark Crystal me
what
that's cute
she just says anything she asks for
we are close to the surface it's best we
remain all right man I get the message
sheesh
versus
trapped in a crystal
at the top of a mount and what they told
me about this doesn't make any sense
the horn
it must be part of some sort of locking
mechanism honestly why not just the lock
and key like normal folks
the ground there must be something we
can use to lower it
as Hunter you came in here don't you
know how you came in here
and again
[Music]
what is going on with it with the cables
today
I am getting
[Music]
I need to press that
epidemic okay she doesn't when uh
okay so I in the pictures
so can a picture say so and now
oh
[Music]
what's that one of Chris
this one seems
very useful
[Music]
[Music]
perfect
[Music]
let's say about that spider
he looks like an enemy
[Music]
oh Dragon City
[Music]
I would have been surprised if this
doesn't even work um
from beginners anyway so I don't trust
that one
[Music]
are you tired
[Music]
and dragon cat coins
and we've come
spiral hurry
hurry open this door
in there I
probably open the doors I've seen they
didn't work first prior
yes and right select wind
clip art to press okay
[Music]
okay
I actually have to
wait until it's done okay
yeah play a trumpet yeah
yeah
system pretty quickly
break their legs off
and also why don't they have the
necklace on at all times
what's it I don't think there was a
trumpet
was that a trumpet
we'll follow the river it will lead us
to shelter where we can rest and then
we're off to warfang the Dragon City
where ignitis will be expecting us all
right now this is
still alive
what's a weekend
week before
yeah he's going to ask me to create any
set each time I think filling up the
whole hard drive it
saves
why did Hunter look
so cool escape to karakum's objective
complete okay
nice nice game inspired
[Music]
[Music]
okay it's quite stuck here
let's move on
yeah I want to I want to explore
don't keep me stuck here nearby I can
reached it and chanted Forest
I like the frame rate in this area
why is my PS3 lagging
okay
yeah all right
why why can't I why can't my PS3 handle
this game
the points activate itself only when
there are no trainers never
Okay so
I got bamboozled
buyers in your power too
because you can't it can't hit Lions
eyes but I do like it in the previous
game it's quite too much position
this is quite aiming
maybe maybe it is good
personal life
because after it's Dimension Hunter
I like you spawning gems
okay and with Bianca this is a rabbit
Channel we need more yeah if you have
yeah we definitely need more rabbits
definitely agree on that
different
dimensions she doesn't exist here oh no
this is the first dimension
at some point but Cinder
okay okay thanks
I don't know what's going on
okay you can't say if mud crafts are
around you cannot save when enemies are
nearby
you cannot save there are enemies nearby
I said I said for the previous game
what's this like
when you say it wasn't that far
in your the last checkpoint or something
[Music]
it is lagging
okay electricity is kind of good too
until it turns out but I said from bad
but yes electricity will answer
[Music]
better case them there so I mean it's
kind of useful and this one is
I can't do this yes that's better
all right
that's why your element is fire you're
going to have more Firepower just seven
thousand
your elements level has increased
foreign
increase your theory level
yeah that would be
of what the fair is him
I prefer just the one bunion that's one
fun that's very nice of you Daisy
and I prefer the just one Pacer and
that's you I've never had enough to
taste
um bunnies bunnies everywhere I found
some rabbits
the music is nice
I haven't wait to put your attention to
you okay let's try out the new five
hours
okay so much for trying that one out
okay
I need some more energy
okay can you do this
not that
I want you to fly high
and then I want you to do this okay that
actually works that's nice
again
where where are you
going to taste mine
right
eat fire
thank you
that's nice
watch out
what's up
guys
I'm still experimenting with with all
this problem
but what did they have to fly can't I
get like normal enemies to try and stuff
on that one
suspicious shorts
this one seems strong yeah am I wrong
I need more enemies
okay
[Music]
I guess
anything on this
okay
yep
as I suspected
by the way
version
should I draw a fairy Jam is that that's
going to be
that's going to be a meme
Eat It
Rocky beats Dragon Fire Gem to increase
your furry level
you know how high my fairy level is
there we go even where's the frame it's
looking
when I'm swimming City
okay okay you don't you don't even need
to see that is
even
in 30.
you might be able to see
the
yeah I don't think I don't know if it's
just up on the stream but there are some
massive frame drops in this game there
we go
yeah I like this one this one is this
one is called
[Music]
oh
yeah
don't let them Escape or others will
come
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you thank you sorry sorry
so much for the my
missing stuff here
hydrate done
that can hydrate
beginning
then
I ain't going to wait for that right
and I'm sorry about that is it um yeah
it's really themed and the rest
I've been so bad
okay that one has to be on cue then
[Music]
fun funny I have somebody tasty teeth
and yeah I really need to try to be
automatic somehow maybe I can set it up
now I don't really need to have one
animated for that
foreign
[Music]
but I do like shadow
how it's R2 to use a cloak of Shadow
release R2 to perform a shadow strike
that's cool because for a thousand okay
well this costs seven thousand Target
speed then
okay I didn't see it no I'm says it
that's right
I will
give my memory
switch Yeah I was yeah yeah
foreign
[Music]
thank you
okay let's try it out on this one then
buff elephant living thing

what's going on
[Music]
but I guess that was
[Music]
there we go
if you haven't seen what's going on when
you don't have health class
there you go finally
I like seeing the shadow element
yes
it is neat
I can say there are a lot of these but
although it does cost a lot to update so
they understand
jumping for attacking from the previous
game
that's the assistant
[Music]
yeah this this foxes are very cute
like those
I found everything oh there's something
here
let's get some some

let's
how is everyone doing today
everyone yeah oh the enemies don't have
names anymore yeah I don't have names
they don't have life bars

my guess is
my guess is if I attack it
[Music]
thank you
I will kill the purple meat there but
then I really nice attacking doesn't
feel like it's killing with us
yeah it's certainly something I'm
missing
something missing
don't need to say please
thank you
oh there we go
that is working
breakfast
India never slapped the death
I think I even Firefly and despite the
name fireplace are beetles not flies
yeah I mean yeah
yeah that dance because you just said I
don't know how I'm supposed to do damage
to it
I'm taking a left still early
we're supposed to go here and then they
left
there's another Firefly
it's your birthday
if you came definitely
I can't defeated
you can never defeat these Bots this
will be
this is why I get stuck in a game
I am free from your vitamin this is back
this is environment okay
you get me back there
ah okay I guess we'll take a left I'm
not laughing
I'm flipping out of bounds no way I'm
not
that really evil game
it gets hey get caught in this world
wind there you go where does this even
lead
like Lance
so the only thing I can think of is like
finding out different
[Music]
is there anything that Christine
well
not electricity either
[Music]
stop the enemy but
nice
I think they stop standing away
um
[Music]
has it been 50 minutes yeah yet since
that will change
and it has but it was requested twice
this I was waiting for a swimsuit yeah
they have to wait a bit longer I think
this was part of ridiculous
three of them but I can't remember one
of them
but also I can do that I agree
I said that when it's done
I know
yesterday yeah
[Music]
thank you
for the game for the nice Beats
overheat danger what
why doesn't he do anything
[Music]
here we go now it's past the fan
instead of warning me about the way he
didn't start the fan already
[Music]
much
and there it is too that one is a bit
okay
[Music]
and that ends the boss battle I assume
now I like
like this
[Music]
I like this level Collision it's
beautiful isn't it
anyway yeah
yeah I'm feeling confused about the boss
battles
overheating PS3 yeah that's
it only happens I happen so far with
this game so it's a demanding game from
lots of optimized
[Music]
but since they still have those prices
I'm pretty sure
I love you I didn't fly
yeah
I can't see this too far away
okay
[Music]
it seems so but doesn't she normally
have braces so you can't really see
and also thanks for the
as well but you didn't care the message
but you know it's more fun
I believe in Japan
yeah the problem is I don't believe me
myself
that's funny because I'm getting
I'm getting
feed you by this thing
I'll take over friends
I really I really don't understand what
I'm supposed to do
okay
is it really generating this in there or
not
I don't see it going up I have to we
have to use today but it originally
generate
because I can see not
having a chance to select it wouldn't
work but
doesn't it March
it's not selected
that's not switching that's switching
that's this one is now
you
okay yeah now it doesn't mean and I've
switched inspired this evening anyway
maybe about to see yeah it looks like it
probably needs one too
Finance one two three
what am I supposed to do with this
is being broken or something am I
missing something obvious why
why is the first why can't I deal any
damage to the boss
what is going on
because it doesn't doesn't do anything
I tried all abilities is it some obscure
move I'm missing
this is like
some kind of
as Secrets or something
yeah there's a great way I tried grab I
try grab many times that happened when I
try grab the helmet is the key what
I don't I mean I basically attacked this
thing
a lot I don't I don't get it
I don't can easily change the armor
again yeah why don't we to remove the
armor by the way that's awesome man
that's confused should I save the game
after selecting it to start the climate
something
because I don't haven't got the
checkpoint after selecting it
whatever it is
did you sneeze
I hate that e about Firefly yeah I just
don't understand what I'm supposed to do
but I think what you mean
like
I guess something like
because I'm only only thing except as
far as I can see is that the helmet's
sticky but like
this is way too much for that like a
very first boss or something
it's interesting things
foreign
[Music]
is glowing but like
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
because basically
it's packing because it seem to do
anything
I'm doing some kind of paragraph
grabs
doesn't seem to do anything either
trying to do something
watch out are you dying
it's very dying
should I
what is it
[Music]
thank you
now make it dizzy
okay I mean it doesn't work
[Music]
yeah
I
don't know what to do
I only fly why are you flying
guess what car did I need to keep track
of colors now
I don't know it's it's Earth College
I basically use this power
thank you
uh this is
wow
uh
I I have not finished
okay let's see did that work
that's right
let's have like ten thousand yay
it should be like hundred thousand or
something
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
like I feel like I've used every Power
the limit on It season three very picky
about what I'm supposed to do
today
yes
yes I need I need multiple game and
replace pirate
with pumpkin yeah
maybe it's replacing it but if something
I replace Pirates I don't know someone
else who wants to cooperate with ponton
[Music]
maybe kitten
kitten cats because one is based on a
cat
I mean okay so this is brown so it's not
that all right
I got it
I I don't got it
okay let me try something crazy then
[Music]
yeah and that's
that's
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
ah
it's way too little everything
[Music]
[Music]
there you go
again
it's not the same for the humans
that's a human
fire
I didn't know the final boss was this
classic yeah it is like
I'm not I'm not leveled up enough to
defeat his boss yet
namaste
okay like I feel like I'll try
everything
came in my house
and this is definitely the dark master
even doesn't
said to be a dragon that was a that was
they confused the uh dragon that could
use other elements with the action dark
master which is this one which has
gained the ability to be invisible
and you know it's the dark pass ticket
important
you can do it finally but I just what am
I supposed to do
I'm confused
I am very confused
[Music]
[Applause]
I need more healing power for a first
Cinder
[Music]
I'm trying to think like I feel like
I've tried
like
I feel like I should have accidentally
managed to deal some kind of damage to
their opponent
it seems to be way too icky I mean
um like
way too too picky to like feel damaged
at least
[Music]
in this healing kinda
rapidly but
um
yeah
I hope no one's getting sick empathy
running around in circles
I have no idea so what I'm supposed to
be
is the bus have to run into a rock or
something
is invincible
watch out
what's happened I tried should I get
serious in your tray okay jumping attack
right attack foreign
[Music]
like that
because the second as the second game
clearly showed if you okay
actually having the green power
activated the Moon
and then all right here we go
okay
you can try and grab
me no no I think we're having a kiss
straight
it should be much easier to grab in
there
I can try it I grab
I think that yeah the Eye Group doesn't
work
or if it's possible if it's wet
power
companies
that doesn't work it gives off the exact
same
perfect as
f1s
which I assume is uh this attack doesn't
work
is
and then the other option is I should
not use the
between one and cities are completely
different power but that's obviously not
working this is
so
let me know yeah I mean I'm I I really I
I I really can't think of anything
I probably needs anything else well yeah
at least like a hint
even though you said the mask is down
similar things didn't help because yeah
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
spider
Inspire but Spire doesn't even have a
green power what are you talking about
all right it has a yellow powers
I've got that orange power
I believe power and a brown power we
should have RC used before because I
think this
okay now it's actually Council seats
okay the game is stupid I should not use
the green power on Green Scene
I used that before and nothing happened
but I need to look back on that watch
out
all right now yes and
everything is
he's the good Power
it's perfect
come around from there
where did it go
you defeated Elite Destiny oh it just
fell out of bounds and died from there
I take it
it's us okay
so
yeah it was game being stupid
I guess clearly this is the green power
this is green
now I'm not a stupid one right like this
is brown I mean sure gloves green but
the icon is brown
right right am I so stupid this is this
is brown
yeah I'm not a stupid one
but this isn't even where it's supposed
to go this was just stopped on this
thing today
so
you did it yeah became a cheating but I
did it I managed it
I didn't like that pen that was a stupid
pen
let's save
that that was a massive frustration
bundled into one enemy
yes
so I that makes me curious
what makes
I've seen there's a lot of
points now he's okay I I like the dark
one but I don't like how it puts that in
the air
called I want to please shut up oh I
should try that first
give me an important give me someone
uh yeah the time is up now
and that's the
that's the swimsuit for
a half an hour
that was the most annoying
boss battle ever
okay why then we're missing this hard
candy so confusing
yeah I have the wrong one selected
that's possible
there we go
there we go that's the one I wanted
I was just stupid that that was just
maybe
I want to see how that works at me give
me someone's pen
crawling in the air
so where am I supposed to go
we're hunting Banks oh yeah no it's not
he's just waiting
that's what you did but it is
yeah it wasn't hard
okay
yeah
I didn't like that
the ability which is smoke from the
front of the dragons that
happened yeah
foreign
well that was fine
because clear lady
he can't
[Music]
because they can clearly cannot just
feel them or something I like normal
yeah I can Inspire other has four red
centers five minutes live Crystal
collect three more therapists by his
life
why didn't they consider imagine these
individual single message I don't know
everything right
[Music]

start off when I
[Music]
maybe if we try twisting it it's no use
Magic
I can watch this all day
starting for gaming is its suggestion
the dark master he's returned hasn't he
afraid turn he must never gone just
shortly after your disappearance
it's been fighting your dragons for
years
claiming the throne at the temple
which through some dark magic he now
suspends above the land a symbol of his
dominance we've been at War ever since
and if
yeah
what are you talking about
[Music]
counting on me and I failed how could I
let this happen some things are beyond
your control I mean you had the option
between dying here it's freezing
yourself but sure you were lucky to be
alive all of you that was no ordinary
creature back there it was an ancient
Earth Gollum from the deep they are the
embodiment of Destruction summoned by
malavour himself these
a dark time
needs to be stopped I have to stop him
whoa whoa Stone out tough guy you don't
need to go around pick and fight I mean
we just woke up after being frozen for
three years got stuff to do
what the [ __ ] is she sleeping hey
[Music]
let's find in the daytime I've been
missing some
lights
what does it look so
shiny
[Music]
oh
cheetahs
respect for our laws that you form an
alliance with the very ones who caused
all our misfortunes Chief prowess
malaphor he alone is the one responsible
this dragon is our last hope
see that yes yes the purple dragon I
know this story but unlike you I have
not forgotten what they say malaphor was
like when he was young and I not
forgotten either what she has done I
relied on you Hunter
as I must rely on all of us in this
Village to protect it but you chose to
abandon us and bring the dangers of the
outside world with you when you returned
the dangers are already around us don't
pretend to ignore them hey can't you
can't just stop arguing
it's getting awkward for everybody
in the valley yeah
and why do they have the ability to
lock the magic thing
better use your eyes power
[Music]
now see what you've done but let us go
we can help our Warriors can handle this
now is not the time to be stubborn hey a
lot of weird stuff happens when they get
upset I'd listen to them if I were you
that was easy to convince
iron scale I mean blocks
it Sparks the light
it's so much fun stuff going on in this
game
I have to be a level two bunny kitten
yes your eyes
so now you can attack him
but I want to try I need to change my
power
this one yeah
I don't know
thank you
I guess it's working
but they're attacking you
the free front
[Music]
foreign
this is this doesn't seem to be much as
[Music]
fantasy
excuse me that hard to pick someone up
have with that
I expected anyways
I am a level two bunny asking to teach
me how to do that I just got to learn
how to do that today
[Music]
we are all gonna die
[Music]
okay
[Music]
[Music]
best friend

mode but if you need to play multiple
train something
okay let's see what happens
[Applause]

[Applause]
thank you something
I like reading channels doesn't make
sense but
it does its job
I'll handle this
I don't think
I can increase the house if you want
okay
thank you
[Music]
yeah I guess you have to remember take
place
I still argue that I've signed much for
homes
they were all right
not returned yeah I don't think it says
120. you have to go find him
no this is really interesting to search
now
very much
[Music]
[Music]
however yeah
I may reconsider
don't bother returning before then as
you'll likely succeed only in attracting
more gruplets to our village
fine weather
yes
to
like if I upgrade this one or this one
that's expensive
scorpion strike
is Phantom
I was expecting the jack is the
girlfriend but the music
[Music]
um
I want to
experience
okay that seems interesting
what's that
let's find someone to use it on
don't explain anymore
if the prices keep changing
I'm sorry harmful
uh so this is the legend of spin music
from the first thing
okay now I got any cities
so it's a big area it's a nice
[Music]
being around
girlfriend becomes cuddling
quite impressive
[Music]
I walked past it
[Music]
very suddenly can't live what you mean

came out crazy coward and Such Thing
that's why we make Spy Academy
what did you like as a
very inspiring class or something

[Music]
okay
More Level Up

[Music]
I can also switch in 2016.
upon that he would be nice so yes I I
would love up on purpose
is that a team yet
the spark system
okay
yeah but Olivia which is
a hard choice
apartment yeah I was like a
as I mentioned before back there
probably
150 centimeters
I think that would be a nice good size
I mean like a really good plus and of
course since
changing aspects class has been
a scene on my screen here
and that should be
one of the features for that
2017 changing websites and also if it is
made
to have human proportions partly Which
pumpkin is supposed to have
oversized head for the second bed you
could even name
by tilts from the store to me right
so I don't get back from this one
I said something at Tryon
Alex

my new challenge

will up if it will level up the
a few stuff
how long was the next one take
the helmet level has been increased yeah
can I see the period somewhere like a
visual thing if your level has been
increased whoa oh wait there they are I

oh I need something to place in there
[Music]
at least one other one of these
as you maybe get back to this place a
little time
at some point and learn new abilities

without other baby so I guess I'll just
progress again
what was the progression token
I mean
yeah having seen their Inspire on a
leash and let me pulling it
[Music]
with that
I see
why didn't I get that message before
indeed
yeah
no need to fly
oh wait someone is captured

okay
all right
come here
oh that killed it
I guess
yeah oh I got these small ones
oh yeah and this one you should find all
right
[Music]
nothing wrong with that
when you need to have your pom pom place
um
you can certainly look at the underwear
as much as you want
without having to pay any points
it has probably redeemed the underway
advanced
then it is no statistics for that
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
ERS no doubt not all of us are of the
same mind well that's putting it mildly
isn't it can you move
we need to get you out of here I'm sorry
I'm afraid my leg is broken
just go back to the village and tell
them where I am your leader doesn't
trust us if we return without you he'll
likely assume the worst yeah and blame
us for it oh
I understand
I found to the valley if bring it here
perhaps I could pull myself onto it okay
we'll do it to launch it you'll need the
weights from the supply cave but it's
locked
oh that Figures ah there was a Hermit
who lives beneath the waterfall at the
other end of the valley he has a key but
the cave is hidden look for the market
he has pink eyes open the path that's
pink nice easy uh raft cave Obama
uh
we'll come back for you me I promise two
three part times the middle part
I'm a good kitten how exciting you are
I'm honestly yeah you are a good kitten
where are you walking away there's a
treasure here don't walk away from the
questions
[Music]
oh another place
Anthony
[Music]
um
attacking enemies
[Music]
so when enemies are attacking they're
getting damaged
by that very small plate
okay sure that's how it works
three two middle parts
emerald green eyes
where am I going
loading
there was no loading last time I went
okay
doesn't mean the area has changed
like that seems seamless transition on
the
High performing PlayStation
[Music]
[Music]
so I need the raft I need the hermit
under the waterfall okay let me what
happens if I go back to the Village
should I try that
[Music]
that was easy can I start that sweet
[Music]
hello
[Music]
so I'm gonna
I'm not supposed to be here according to
themselves I guess we weren't supposed
to return
but you're allowed to return to save
and
yeah
nice work but I mean
I'm sorry but this is not at home
now why do you have to put it up on
height left because okay I have to read
it this is the home review Channel this
is a completed home
you got you got some shelter nice and
all and negative wooden floor you have
nothing to sleep on if you don't want to
sleep on floor wooden floor you got
nothing else you know it's just yes
you're sleeping
and
what is this meant for I think not on
the outside
and yeah
it's a nice help do you want to live
there
didn't even have
honestly came I came from foreign
all right
I will move over to the other side
yeah I have to open these for the right
then press him
anyway let's follow along this path
to the other side
why don't they fly instead oh anyways
let's take care of this
[Music]
thank you
there we go
with that taken care of
[Music]
okay what's the point of this
foreign
[Music]
I see yeah I see artworks
fairy Jam not really
is missing one important thing the air
defense
oh yeah yeah exactly I mean yeah I mean
it got nothing like it nothing to sleep
on you got like no food storage or
something and there was a climbing
section okay if you don't need time you
didn't fly
that platform and everything in this
game since he's silly because
open the passageway sure
put this open
okay okay let's go ahead
so this is where the hermit lives then
permit whatever it was oh he requested
me make animals what animals by the way
and like
yes
don't do any distinct sounds
I want to do that
I found something
[Music]
this is
wolf oh
hey okay sure I could I could you just
make up a Amazon but that's an exist in
the game then oh
I had for that
invade myself
this guy lives
did I
don't work in a circle
yeah
this is not where the hermit lives
after flying yeah
is it that great
[Music]
what does cinder sound like again I
don't know what signal sounds like
we have fly in here but
really
it's very good
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
clothing please wait
at least the game asks kindly please
wait
let me guess I'm supposed to trigger
this for stuff to happen okay let's do
it I'll inspire
I'll pick the wrong side
let's push the third in I don't see the
point of it
great now we can walk away
it was like the design this world and
then decided that three five to be a
thing or something and
[Music]
skin confuses me
yeah I know what it means here now
you are a wolf sound that I have me
jealous
but it's like is was that like a it's
like a good chill it's a bad chance
[Music]
is that what the cinder Sounds here here
[Music]
is that basically what Cindy says in
this game
higher
[Music]
Cinder is really high
okay why am I supposed to go
pissed
what is the point of this
game is
what's the point of this
is a bit of time in here
but
I mean
what what kind of invisible was this but
you can yeah anyway you can fly up here
this world is so confusing and this is a
point that you should be using because
of students return today
yeah I miss Divine you can't sing now
for this draft hello
all right I actually have to fight me
nothing
I still I I still don't like how they
don't I have scars
[Music]
there are no enemies nearby anymore you
can see me
good chills a good chance
Maybe
yeah he he stands for this in the new
one
she said she keeps
I'm happy I'm happy for that
[Music]
as I can
change the sound redeem then make it
like
give me an animal team or something but
it was
yeah I think that's better
let's do that
do I need something to play some
distance
[Music]
what's the command of sitting I have
their seats
[Music]
why are you running
this one almost looks more comfortable
than this
event is there
find the hermit okay
any upgrades the level bonus there's
there's a few more but this is the
secret boss that is almost impossible to
defeat
they're 99 this is hard soon okay
[Music]
so you can't anything even ask me to do
different sounds that actually sounds
fun
thank you
I'm still unable to find the helmet I'm
sorry
and I don't know where I'm supposed to
go
I've never got some enemies here is that
a good thing
it's not a good sign what did it gets
doing here
nice
this isn't half bad in fact it's raining
so much
right
you can see there's basically making all
the power
let's continue this
[Music]
and also
I just started here
are you going to die
thank you
this is it yeah yeah
I can't remember
how do I get through here
we go underneath
foreign

[Music]
okay so it's red

move here you know
I can't trust this game
[Music]
okay I I assume that means that nope
that's wrong is fear
yeah now it says there's
[Music]
I finally I didn't have um
spine
[Music]
what is
[Music]

[Music]
okay I will let
update the redeem

[Music]
[Music]

with it with the game the music is so
nice that's important that they are
still having fine fun with me fooling
around what
yes clearly
clear it was
no she stopped her telling something
wasn't there
oh yeah it was the year it's okay but
you can do it oh now it changed colors
now in Seattle
[Music]
that's cheap thing the previous one is
always the same color that means it's
Grandma
my turn okay
yeah you're definitely your turn
all right you need to remember where it
is
[Music]
[Music]
fine
[Music]
there you go
[Music]
and you actually can't stand back okay
so that was not an option [ __ ] thing
that it's about to buy the time for
something
foreign
wow wow
hahaha
I'm keeping the enemy in love you for
quite the way
is that fire too
it's not well legend of
the food
and then back in there put it down she's
even like yesterday which is something
sharp tiny grass drop yeah how do you
cut yourself on guys before
that's that stuff can be Sharp
nice meeting
okay thank you bye
finally beautiful
it wasn't what I was going for but
[Music]
okay enough moves
um
most of these in this one for now
it's I don't know maybe I should save up
for that one
I found another one
soon there would be 11.
a bottle of spit that's as exciting
[Music]
is strong winds
no don't crash it's about to fall down
[Music]
yeah I always feels like
you're telling me see me
okay here's something did I go here
before
yeah I think that this was the first
place I took that
I think I've been here before
yeah this is
I mean unless something else I shouldn't
I can tell me in there
maybe it allows me to go through here no
how much that I was going to but no
as you can talk to him again maybe
maybe you can let me know what I mean
when your friends is slow
[Music]
they're always flying
perhaps she's still flying
okay that was fast flying okay sorry
could you
maybe let us know where to go excuse me
what
how do you speak to someone
yes I am not sure why I'm supposed to
get I'm confused again
foreign
got the key right nope I don't know what
the key is I don't know where the key is
I don't know
why is it downloading when I exit but
there's no loading on anything
I wasn't making sense
then though
where are the keys I don't know what the
keys and I don't know how the keys
need to go to get that at the other one
but I wasn't
[Music]
I guess that wasn't that the other
[ __ ]
[Music]
I guess I should go to that whatever
is a lot of waterfalls here
[Music]
look I think that was perfect for this
time this month
here's some waterfalls this says we are
missing here
[Music]
Maybe
yeah I see I think I should go back to
that
[Music]
it might be exactly a bit more careful
for a key
not this one yeah the feeling that
wasn't this one
[Music]
that is this game is overloading the
PlayStation
you don't want to get the password but
it is
and then it was like
what's in there
[Music]
yeah and then it was like
seeing here
why doesn't this one
okay
[Music]
I have upset things
[Music]
I'm sure I open one of those maybe it
wasn't that one
what about Canyon
[Music]
okay so this is the raft I need
something for that
and then there's like
the waterfall there
and
[Music]
I come through here
then
and then there's this thing I interacted
with before which I personally can't
rejected now
that that is confusing as well
here
fine
yeah I'm just confused
I am activated oh here's the waterfall
maybe it was this one
and here we go
okay
kids sets
[Music]
yeah I need to so you know stuff
oh okay
all right he touched water
oh there's a climbing thing here
[Music]
press cross repeatedly jump directly
from our climb Zone the next one what
try that
if that obviously didn't work with
lighting
when flying or jumping close to certain
walls press the cycle stick to the one
around
um
that's that's going
okay so I have to
[Music]
basically jump upwards
this what was coming again
all fast
pressure painting
oh I see
by running on a water press it's crossed
80.1
okay I pressed to run anymore I don't
okay
I'm starting to get
and you know about this stuff works
okay okay
foreign
because then that happens
what
you're dancing insane and then then
changed
make this work
[Music]
for 5 45
[Music]
now
I made that before
[Music]
I can do it
give me
15 more attempts
there we go that's what I wanted
okay you can you can glide the next
platform
yeah I got that it was yesterday
you can't
you can glide but you cannot fly
that makes perfect sense
if you shoot our place
come from
you can't climb on this you can you can
hang on to them but it cannot get it
okay
oh I want I want that one
give me no no did you do that for
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
thank you
it could be used to get that challenge
of
a little closer so I can
[Music]
see they're standing in light if they
get closer they're actually going into
the dark what do you mean I've never
been here before not you
don't because someone emails
give everything away
dragon
that Dark Masters rabbit I was but but
I'm not anymore
[Music]
you don't have to listen to him
did you not recognize the creatures
to serve the dark master but all for
their own greed and thirst for power
than any true loyalty to him this is how
Bella Falls she can think heavily
you
can run
Cinder let's go
we'll find you
[Music]
Cinder
are you okay I'm fine I'll be fine well
I am not was I the only one who was
freaked out by that guy she's
okay Lisa wasn't a complete waste of
time
come on what you waiting for
what You Waiting For Boys in there
oh no we're going back going back it was
seal his distance
he doesn't deserve to keep Goosebumps
and pick that one
now you're going to my Captain
[Music]
oh not anything about it
[Music]
after this time
okay you know what
foreign
[Music]
ladies first
nope
nope that's it that much
[Music]
left
that's a big key now it's a small spice
obviously
there's something there
[Music]
we go oh
wait how do you get in here
it wasn't that nothing been about 20
minutes okay
more braces
[Music]
FIFA new armor foreign
[Music]
visible racist too
let's say
okay I got the key
that's him I should use the key
[Music]
or that gate change his first dates
is it a consumable key
you need him
it is a strong independent Dragon
Dragoness
[Music]
Okay so
I need to remember what that kids were
[Music]
when I can fly so it's that tricky to
Traverse this area so
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
you think you must intended today but
you can do by
not giving me
[Music]
a password
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I don't miss this one it's only affect
audience
[Music]
nice
[Music]
okay
I guess I need to
find that
okay I just need to pay more attention
to where it is
Swedish accent for me
you sound like you're in a boat what
wait what are we talking about now
[Music]
what is it what
so I am
now you're confusing me
did I say something silly
it's fixed wow it was something weird
a lot of churches here
buy a helmet
[Music]
you finding your arms
the fans
yeah spider needs that look at this fire
this which now I put the
Matrix now it's back now it's gone again
it must be my headset what no because
yeah no one else is commenting on it
maybe it is your headset someone else
hearing some streets if it affects the
game audio as well that's obviously
nothing it's my
am I
voice recording at least and that
doesn't mean
[Music]
but there's a whole bunch of these here
find the right
okay how am I supposed to get
I do have an idea
very much that thing again
all right all right come on Cindy
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
is the greatest fan
I think
I think there is another one out there
is
no it's straight there
okay explain why don't declaring to say
thank you come on
why doesn't he want to climb to the side
point
question
how's it
it's it's hanging on there
no
okay you're not supposed to do that
I thought that was a clever idea
can I get okay I have another idea
okay let me try this
is
experimenting now so
okay
no no that's not what you're supposed to
do
are they doing stuff
okay
love it down a bit okay now
here we go
here we go
and now
I
I don't know if I'm doing this correct
or not
but
maybe I can just
[Music]
maybe tell me maybe you can do this
where they can
[Music]
yeah well in that case
I was trying to be smart but you don't
even need to be smart
[Music]
daddy greatest together but together
in imagine if a pump on Lolly stream
I've always been able to
when I speak together
if we're playing this game and strap
into it
there we go
finally
[Music]
I actually never had that I said that
anyway it's quite obvious that scene
there has gotten more
Elemental Minds why did I pick that up
I don't even remember getting up today
oh yeah that's what I got is that but I
haven't gotten it how am I supposed to
get up there then
sessions
playing games together yeah I mean yeah
yeah I'm up for it if there's some kind
of
multiplayer game that's possible to play
preferably like a co-working
family one with bunnies I mean this is
that will be more fun it would be more
fancy and only struggle with playing
solo
but because playing multiplayer and uh
ruins the core idea of the game making
it way too easy oh yeah I was supposed
to bring those to the right
thank you
myself
or something
oh yeah behind us all right
my coffee is on myself again probably it
really looks like you should be a very
lady be visible walls of this world is
too small
[Music]
how about extracting this world thing
and they're like for what I want to
check up on this one
what
how did this work well why why why did
this work all of a sudden it's my
personality
[Music]
frankly
[Music]
okay here yeah okay since we need two
this is about two dragons
I do have an idea
foreign
[Music]
oh that's why I need to think
I need to get over the outside first
that's why I needed to do the wait what
happens if I can only come over
I said no it's okay
yes
you can fly high
I need to get over to the others but
there we go that's it that's the thing I
used to get up on the other side
come along
this is the
follow me
for a spiral actually that was foreign
why is there no option to like
have them staying in a fixed position
and why is this water splashing after
huh
yeah the water is not this high
what is going on
fly
fly up on it
my turn
yeah you can do it
nobody can't [ __ ]
okay
then you get up
there we go this place this thing is to
play first
okay how about this stuff line because
clearly you don't know how to fly
that's in computation
that was beautiful
excessively being
okay now
I know
[Music]
please behave
[Music]
walking through the forest
like uh living is a climbing okay
and what she came in
[Applause]
no problem
here we go then
wait but that's why this exists
I say Aspire releases and
okay
wirelessly
[Music]
yeah
like to me it was clear clearly that oh
that one existed so you can have spiral
or whatever
sit on it while you move over the other
character
what are you doing fine we're walking
this way
I think I wanted to do and if they're
going to behavior oh that there's a lot
of okay that that that that's
that raft is going to be scratched up
by all these rocks
okay let's do this
brighten indestructible raft they
clearly shouldn't he's clearly shouldn't
work
look at it you can do it
and weirdly decided to do this
not they have not only designed it so
one dragon can hold on to it
they're also designed to another dragon
king and
[Music]
what are you doing now
um what it really
okay let's give fight some
you want to see Fury
[Music]
want to see fairy
oh yeah
[Applause]
all the theories
you can't make the fear last long yeah
how would I defeated everyone
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
the message
okay okay
that is nice to when you show up and
it makes things good very sweet
all those bits
and you're incredible positivity
it was fun having you here definitely
it was stiff on him in here it was
hate you too much why
for me
nobody there is nowhere to wait to play
maybe spiracy did the flying he came out
better at me
and a half
yeah very slow
I barely got City games
[Music]
so I guess
anything of this mission
I'm also getting paid so
this is what's the stock of the game I
guess doing a long machine is fine oh
you've come back thank you oh yeah yeah
we came back before too but you were
kind of busy being knocked out
dead
let's get you home
not like it works
make sure maybe maybe it's gonna work
the other way but before he couldn't
even stand up
why are the things you should clarify
thanks to these two dragons
the texture quality is quite bad
when I chose
I do not share your faith in this Dragon
Hunter but by putting you in Chains
maybe I can see the pixels in the
textures is it supposed to place it in
three yes
Implement me
use the Forbidden nice clipping I will
lead you directly to the Dragon City
if this dragon is indeed our last hope
and I bid you safe passage and good luck
we could use your help
very well
the invitation shall be left open
it didn't answer
because you have and very well
ding ding thing
made the textures
and kids say to the quality of this game
as soon as you are ready to set out for
warfang
I shall be waiting for you
he's the one who opens that one
okay
let's find the same point then oh
there's one
the first chapter I said no
deep belly Pierce
oh
okay thank you I have the point of
sleeping now at this button is that
I am sleeping by me
[Music]
how do I see things like
record seed
[Music]
yeah whatever it doesn't matter
um
turn off system
[Music]
isn't that fun
[Music]
very fun game and made some progress too
I'm happy with the progress
I have uh I didn't mention it I tried it
and also the
uh
this Prosperity team is over since quite
a while
yeah I should go to bed soon I'm glad
you liked it it's um I have played it
once before
it was on Xbox 360.
[Music]
it's like a it's like a pleasant
thinking of scaled
[Music]
quality of it
but yeah but it was very very long time
ago I barely remember anything
so I have managed to complete it before
but I did play it Co-op so I guess
being too working together to figure
stuff out did help
gets certainly
[Music]
so
[Music]
I don't have much more to add so
tomorrow
[Music]
today for some people and Saturday
and I will start uh playing
at the
the Crash Bandicoot the uh
in insane Trilogy that version
if that sounds exciting
so away
yeah that's basically it I'm very tired
these these streams are late but I do
want to vary the times when I stream so
not so funny yeah Christian fun game and
it's more more like action because it's
a it's a bit like an action platformer
this Legend of spy is more like a
Adventure especially it's a game from
what I've seen so far it's definitely
much slower paced
in the bikini area at least I can't say
the rest of them
of course
so I thought it's definitely somebody
will visit panda
anime or something
playing red phone thinking about this is
one of the other friends to
and
Noah archives which I mentioned very
long time ago
the first streamers I saw on Street
[Music]
yeah thank you all for coming
[Music]
