where's the audio why is everything

there yeah

yeah I was playing a PlayStation before

so it was just a PlayStation thing yeah

that's the properly Stampede very

interesting

your texts the leading fan compound and

the running buns after

trash bag kitchen entrance and trains

and Trust I don't know

I can't speak English

so

yes I'm supposed to defeat this boss so

as I learned from the game medium loud

this is my headset it's probably as my

head

got more watches today

with 212 followers too what what did I

say last time we had another followers

I'm so happy to see so many people being

here at the start of the stream when I

mean and it's it's such a sudden change

because

because it's just like a few days ago it

was usually one two or even zero and now

I think starts four or five I'm really

happy to have seven people in here

I mean I'm happy to assist Jimmy in

general because that puts me in bad mood

even if games are frustrating such as

this game because what I've learned

is that I can't see my hands can I see

my now

so

in this game

um

when you die five times you you start

the mask

um

and

apparently when you go to the second

phase

like apparently and that one so when you

die for attention you get the mask but

if you start a new level

it resets the desk counter and that was

not the case for PlayStation games

uh Game Boy certainly has enough memory

the same social value so when you

restart the level you got a new level or

something we have to die

it restarts come since you have to die

probably more times before you get the

mask again

this and apparently when you go to the

second phase of this boss that counts as

starting a new level so it resets the

count there

but when you die it goes back to the

first phase for some reason even though

it counts as a new level

according to the county so I have formed

a few lives repented that doesn't even

help because that just adds to the waste

of time

[Music]

so I have 18 lives but I don't need 18

lives because

this is completely useless

I can just waste lives like I kind of

forgot I actually had a

musket Stars I actually didn't have to

paste

but anyway so

um

anyway

what I'm going to do is yeah

I'm just going to

foreign

so yeah oh annoying me

I'm just going to restart uh oh wait he

did not shoot the thing okay

that's the most important thing first

like that

so

like that thank you

and when I get a game over I will start

in the first night without a mask

oh

and then when I die I will just die

until I get the second mask

foreign

more times and then I will have a

husband have zero extra lives and then

that's my second oh come on

okay he actually takes 0.1 when acting

classes damage

amazing

so he doesn't show me the number of

viewers uh that's weird

I have a large wooden structure on the

back of my house I put Furniture in a

grill on I have a big thick energy

are you doing that joke again but you

see do you see papa wolf

I'm not from I'm not from man from a New

Zealand I don't speak of that accent

good morning and good afternoon to you

man

I guess I'm starting

it yes

paper sticks ceiling

that you could be talking about

hey time to do this properly

I hope everything's just a final Spain

and we should simply he was a bit bigger

what's that it doesn't cause any damage

one

the arm is extra it's

extended which of course does not make

any sense I can just walk through him

wait he didn't take damage but I just

want anything and now it's the second

phase

and then I did that let's see if I can

see no I've tried in there we go finally

so he takes one damage once he does the

red one which is fine because that's it

oh wait this is reverse control it says

enough time

move so slowly as he enter and now I

have no mask anymore because that

counted as an 11.

so now I hit the mouse back again

foreign

hard to save these boss fight revise

that he doesn't feel damaged holy crap

it's extended yeah and it's kind of when

the second place doesn't attack much

which is nice

this is hard it is hard

that's what she said

I mean I'm not going to have done that

so I mean the first place isn't hard I

just wish I didn't have to redo it every

time

and that oh

and that he said

what reverse patrols now it does this oh

no it's stopped doing reverse control CM

move straight into the thing

and last The Mask first thing that

happened

and then this is yellow attack which is

really hard to avoid because

oh no okay that's fine that's fine

because that's what just does that

stop moving ah

now I just like actually so big

so it's really hard to avoid those

attacks it's big he moves slow

so yeah

and crash but stuck for some reason yes

this boss boss battle is probably going

to take all day

like this lemon

and this is how you fight these spots

the only way I know

come on

come on let's just

crash crash level that's ping pong

section one thing under a lot of this

stupid delay that

oh come on what is this

I guess I'll just have to stop trying to

do nothing

is sending me somewhere at that point at

least I'll do this then

attack him I was avoided again this was

what I want but I guess it's a safer way

of doing it

doesn't make as many mistakes on that

something

foreign

there you go

105.

just switched

this is so hard to avoid and then you

must be still close to him so you can

attack him

because as long as you're aggressive and

attack him within a time limit

okay that's terrify

nice nice red one that's bad

is that your first control

because it doesn't look now it's yeah no

no come back comment

no you don't attack where did it go

there we go three times

I need to

oh no

no no no

double pack there you go

only one more time don't stop the yellow

now

I'm not good it's right

now I just need TV I can see one no no

no

no

[Music]

yes

so close that was the closest I've been

but

apparently it does not count

as I didn't do it

come on

face two again

I'm like he's on this side

here we go one out of five

yellow

TFT t85

yellow again like

so so big

trash is so big trash moves so slow

this is so hot

now it's only cows in horse shoes and

Hand Grenades as my dad would say

yeah yeah

not sure my horseshoes has

never been seen like

I guess hand grenades don't be close

with those

thank you

because horseshoes the closest person

wins oh yeah but in that case you have a

lot of

more things were closest matters

there we go finally

now I can't attack this I mean I can't

gain attack them again

but yeah

I got two chances per game over to do

this

I mean the game is very very quick by

resetting some

I don't want to use they they have the

option

do you want to do this properly

thank you

because you got games like curling and

yeah I know just a

all right oh yeah hang on it's just that

good

one two

anymore

nope

they go two more

please don't shoot more yellow

one more I guess I just only need to

find a specific point

thank you and now die no I missed

bye yes he died I did it finally

I found something that way I guess I'm

going in the yellow one would I I think

think I put too much effort into

avoiding the other one Infinity two

there are the Torches and hungry is

working with a shower yes that's true

and

high jump the closer you are to this

still outer space and viewing

okay wait I don't even remember my voice

it is for distracting

no I can't defeat All The Wretched

bandicoots myself

but unmark my words I'll be back

good job Crush

you've rescued the Audubon cuts from the

entropy empty Future Insurance are you

calling

Coco his sister and crunch who I really

don't remember what his relationship are

to crashing Coco as auxiliary bandicoots

here

that's kind of

okay sure sure

two burden should be got away if only

we'd had all of the gems shorts I could

reopen his space Vortex and you could go

after him oh that's why they're like

half the end the question mark question

mark that was the question marks and but

that's that's the game well I will

collect don't want this James charts

and here we go the

credits

gaming design programming

uh in which of these people do we blame

for and making that boss battle

additional support

special thanks to these people

and Company

some key testers that's fine I mean you

might want to test

let's play kids testing game too

okay I guess there were no other testers

that explains all the issues with the

game we're talking about testers before

doing that

all right that first scene is a

no there's testing

absolute quality I think you need to

change your name oh there's some proper

testers

is one of the names glitch

to the artist is bucket is looping

terrible run all over burst of speed

yes I I do want to I still haven't done

everything

and let's go back to this wait can I

speak here yes

oh

so when I get all the charts

are you on update okay but then we get

on the charge first

chance

let me go back to the starch

the whole labyrinthians

this is dark

should I get the relics maybe maybe I

should do like relics and gems at the

same time

tea bag yes

we're gonna be fighting this boss only

defense in less than 20 minutes

you're right it's been tested 90 minutes

I mean I'm happy with that

Let's test this it didn't crash when I

turned it on

um

to be honest that's kinda how the Sega

company was like

which is some hint respect because the

developer from Travelers stays he has a

YouTube channel which I don't remember

the name of the game hat is the name of

that channel so apparently I didn't

remember he said that one of the things

Sega did not allow was games to crash so

what he did in specifically Sonic

3D Blast was that if if the game

and

some for every single error code that

would cause the game to crash it

basically started the game but into a

bonus mode

and then it pretended that you found a

bonus that seek bonus

and that way

Sega was Nando I say

no

wait but

let's do this thing

hopefully he doesn't have these

question marks anymore

like that

that and then he does not have any

question marks anymore no Google get

stuck all right I'd have that foreign

baby

but I should realize that

turn down

speaking of easy doing that

wow since when did foxes all right I

mean I guess since they died on it

that's fine enough

[Music]

there we go that's what I wanted

why didn't I get see what I got

you can apply to beam me quickly

25 subscribers so thank you for being a

subscriber okay what's that yes one is

one non-animated and one animated

so what should they like the new emotion

be then

being there in England

I'm open for this

what

thank you

also an issue that

um

there we go

oh no this devil is like a library

[Music]

wait should I go down

yes

and then I take back

this level is causing me so much

confusion at the moment

yes I think that just in case

[Music]

my my little green content oh there's a

clicks

oh my my brain this level

okay good I'm happy with that

wiping her brow upset rage and one point

doesn't get angry I mean I can get

frustrated I guess but not angry that

would be out of character we can't have

that can we

like like something like

there again

wait

of course our Spooks this is Boost

I think so

oh yeah this isn't

nothing much left of that ball

okay

I need to watch out for those wait that

wasn't even supposed to go there we're

supposed to go here

because they are expenses every morning

okay this is gonna take a few attempts

because this isn't nscc there we go

wait Robert I missed that one what's

that whatever

but and now we're supposed to go this

way

[Music]

because the fences everywhere they're

running too

out of the Thirsty boxes of obviously it

was the wrong one I hit

beautiful

missing every time whoa did you see that

I'm missing every I'm using every box

that has their green

yeah welcome

[Music]

yeah the

Heat box like the

the position you need

to hit a box is so high

like it's Precision yeah the area where

it crashes it in the Box this is

actually so small except

except for when they are green

pan bun trying to go fast again yep

more like wiping her brow in relief like

I think is really because everyone

always give me fine it's like a few

months could work

there's been

moments what up

missing everything about except that one

I don't know how I managed it

so it's so weird

it almost like those big boxes of BJ

somehow

I just tried to give students yeah

[Music]

like that I'm trying to hit the box but

I can't

but make it green and

I'll hit it for sure

no no

take me a few attempts

[Music]

oh

I can always start lagging

I missed the clock

I'm not sure if it has a three or a one

it's like

thank you

the numbers are so hard to tell apart in

this game

because at least it goes to

[Music]

okay and that's that one I should

that's not how I avoid it

yeah I'm missing every box

and spend tradition

again up here

[Music]

I I'm really curious if um

the uh

clean boxes

neutral boxes

I have a bigger you are taking up more

space that they are easier to crash into

because it kind of feels weird

that are for some reason I'll hit them

so easily but not but then when I try to

take the times I can't

keep running this is not where I'm going

around

yeah okay in that time I got through

[Music]

yeah that's okay

thank you

um

obviously won't be anything because

sometimes my name is

they hadn't been tested these time

travels with us yeah they seem to do

that I don't know I don't want to eat

anything so because we're going two and

all you can eat restaurant after the

stream and don't want to fill up too

soon I know it says

yeah that's the one

spend more than one second cleaning up

we're going through there

yeah I need to remember

this level

going through here

and then it's

why is it so easy

why is it so hard to pick up these like

these I means but as soon as it's green

I crash into it so easily

it makes me so confused

yeah

even though I know I'm

managed to

okay

I'll pick it back

[Music]

Okay so

isn't this whoa whoa whoa straight to

the gold

no it is so much modern level

foreign

got caught in something eh

oh there's something something happened

green stands out better on the ground

texture and yellow yeah yeah yeah but at

the same time that's why this is a hit

sticks yeah how does that make it easy

to hit them

thank you

[Music]

and I get fruits

it doesn't make any sense I'm doing

trying to charge

why wait

what is this the underwear option is

enabled

no anywhere Liam's still there yeah I

didn't disable it

hi it's new it's actually not new it's

quite old it just

I have it disabled for most of the time

I wanted to see if

I don't know if if because people like

to read in the underwear which of course

makes sense

looks nice

but it might make some people you know

[Music]

you

but if people like being awkward having

fun putting underwear

is

done like perfectly

going across the

not much people like not show up because

they think

fun is too scantily planned

and I don't know if it's

like it feels like I've gotten

more popular since I stopped

don't wait I'm getting a phone call

give me a moment

[Music]

[Music]

right now

baby

videos

[Music]

so I am fine

I got a delivery

package

so

they were had to drop it off

I said they would be here anyways

I don't know what is our set before 50.

residency

looks cute in underwear I'm the

assistant live playing on the way well

I'm glad you like fun fun in any way I

mean most most people probably do it

people maybe they don't want to see that

the last thing though that can be

when it's cute engineering

people think that too can I marry people

think so that I can be

I really hope I have a voice that fits

the cuteness of quantum

at um

a package I wonder what it could be it's

a package with closing

specifically

more dresses

because I want more dresses to wear or I

can sneak in from today that's nice

oh now it's close Okay and then

do like that

what

you do I like your voice that's good

they feel like I'm not doing my voice

consistently though

since

as proven body tags after all I am a

trans woman that's no secret

you are

oh nice I got through there I didn't

even believe so

but it's actually I had one person said

that they had suspicion I don't know if

that's correct word because

and that I might have been a trans Woman

based as soon as I touched the ramp it

just speeds away and I don't get that in

physics

is so inaccurate

I know sometimes your voice change

depending on which character your voice

I mean obviously I didn't count that

um

yeah anyway I also I was saying was that

yes someone

thought I might oh I've been oh

been a trans Woman based on my behavior

but they hadn't heard my voice yet

then they heard my voice and then they

didn't think I'm a stressed woman

anymore

and that's nice to know that my

my voice is believable and doesn't sound

faking or anything like it

so even though I'm getting

like there's a clear fruit coming out of

the box and flying up to the inventory

um

it doesn't count let's be connecting

them apparently

[Music]

come on now

oh

I guess that worked no move forward

okay and then

and then we move down and then we move

down here and then we move down here and

then we're down here and I'm not even

sure where we're going anymore

[Music]

okay we're going up here in the front

well

no too quickly

such a long level why is it so long

the only thing I've seen it I've noticed

in your voices when you speak more

confident enough than you did for you in

streaming right

yeah I'm definitely more confident now I

was so careful that when I started

in other news

I guess I have some

no I didn't even see it so yeah let's

have some dresses to try on

yeah

after streaming

[Music]

already got some nurses but

some more dresses that might

like a

trying to find a dress that

when it's not her

oh

comment is here seems to have a more

consistent stress

pricing system which is nice

it's not a specific address this isn't

just clothing in general no stop

boosting across

he became even more confident after you

come there remember I think a trans

woman yeah it was something that

constantly worried me

people figure out or something

but now there's no point for me hiding

that anyway

where's my my tool sale being because

that was also the day I was singing on

stream I was really pushing my these

things I was afraid of doing

that might have helped my confidence as

well

ah this is going to take a ride

okay I don't have to do this watch list

of the Stream

and the way you can go into the level

got stuck inside lemon somehow

or something

I know it each fall after platform

Canyon in a strange way but well that's

the only

type of obviously an athletic pickup now

stuck I'm pressing down

I wanted to stop

and it gets really weird

as

it stops pretty quickly try to stop

it doesn't require that long distance to

stop Within

but if you add the ramp going up a ramp

which presumably should make him stop

even quicker because his upper ramp

depending on

it's like they're using the same idea

going down a ramp that you have less

controller really speed

and it might just be me weird

oh

oh

and then there's a stop here and then it

is a very annoying box there animals

there

and then I'm going down and down

and of course I miss both

and this is to the exit

nope can it move along the track no

what

like the physics don't make sense

I pressed

I pressed along the track I did not

press any button actually did not try to

compensate from going outside I just

pressed along the track and nothing else

but somehow he went back and forth

around that half pipe and increased in

speed which does not that's not a

physics work

if you if you put a marble on a half

pipe you're not going to see it go down

and up higher on the other side and then

back and forth until it flies off that

makes no sense but I have not been

paying attention to chat

yeah yeah no idea every every time

something happening happening weird whoa

what the bunny

being abusing you very much probably

she's for sure getting excuses

but I don't know

bang for his son

I don't know what you mean

like

but

like this is a classic

we also got

um

physics don't make sense

they are physics they don't make

anything

I guess

yes I guess

you're right

[Music]

and I was doing so well today

and then you see it really begins this

queen stream chats although very briefly

because it seems to write more messages

but

um

yeah I made the most biggest

they can be although with any compute

because I'm streaming 720.

which you can you can see if you go to

Quality this afternoon say goodbye crash

um

but with a new computer I'm most

thinking about upgrading to

um

an ATP instead

a new

computer should be able to handle I mean

if this computer can do 720 and actually

good computer should be able to handle

1080. I guess they'll stream at like 30

and 25.

yes

as I usually do

doing 15 more Arts jeans no

that was only for this community

but I still could do 15 for archery

because you really don't need High frame

rate for art

to be honest saving some performance to

the actual auditing

well

yeah

as soon as he touched on this this is

like the ramps of boots

but that means that the because the

emails currently did because

he emotes on Twitch are 120 by 112 which

might be seen as a very random number

but that's based on

that's the original R20 by 28 which

doesn't seem as a random number 112 is

just four times

28.

but it might seem like a random number

two but

that's kind of the size they appear on

the chat

so when you send a single or two emotes

and they are displayed in their largest

size

on my on-screen chat which is 112 by

100.

[Music]

yeah this should be the pass to the exit

okay the exit should be there yeah there

we go underneath and everyone who's not

subscribed he did not see no that's not

something like that and I just started

as I go Michigan

and I did not even get a good time

guess this is

rather cortex all over again

apparently I need to be 10 seconds quick

eh and that's only for him Sapphire but

that's not even gold

oh no yeah

this this is impossible

yeah maybe I should give up and do 100

I've completed the story

but at this point I do not feel like 100

in this game

not if I had to go through that and I

didn't even get the Sapphire

uh it hurts

oh oh

should I move over to the next crash

game instead

10 more questions

because sometimes yeah because this

isn't the only ball level there are more

nothing very good like Simon's here

no why why do you steal my dress again

this is what I mean when I have the

underground available constantly used

why is the game lagging

but I don't think there's any more game

no wait no yeah yeah yeah there's crash

boom bang
