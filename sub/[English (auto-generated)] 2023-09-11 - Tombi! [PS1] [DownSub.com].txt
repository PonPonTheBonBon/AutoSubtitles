this is the evil people that caused our

spell on this Village you take it the

bag will help you find the evil pigs

when you're near the pig's hideout

the pack will reveal the evil Peak Gates

the entrance to his heart out but

remember evil please do not hide in the

places where they have positive respect

evil spells then wait says speaking but

also each Pig has only one badge that

can still living with

in other words there are a total of

seven evil feedbacks for

one for each evil Peak

the evil pink bag should be near the

places that have been cast under husband

Point well but not at the place but just

near the place find the bags and you

will find the evil peace be careful she

must not underestimate the power of it

even fixed there is no need to cut to

Deforest the more you may pass at your

place well first try Phoenix Martin it's

used to be really peaceful Mountain but

reasoning was

three reasons that I don't give him

enough attention

that's a practice yesterday's dreams but

more streams than that

and he said that I was flirting too much

and it made him uncomfortable

and also that I've been using him for

money

I cannot deny that these reasons are on

maybe true

and like maybe not 2D

chosen to

basically

this is all complex

[Music]

I think currently the other way have

been communicate him is my email

because he is that's why you have the uh

blank spots on the

break that part it was it was a warm

down gently

[Music]

I'm really relaxing on the bed

do you have any plushies in your bed

let's see if I just jump out like this

yes

one crystal ball like quiet not still

found yeah this is all the crystal ball

I can okay let's wait where was the

other crystal ball it was in the it was

in that area

why did I ask a question when I don't

once I'm so stupid because you know

I do have no packs you can see

of course I don't want people just tell

me what to do

so we can talk about all this stuff when

I'm playing of course

oh well Bailey Bailey's here Bailey's

cute

[Music]

Bailey is uh they're a polar bear

it does funny screens

and I like watching

just can't see me when I'm streaming at

the same time so it's ready

it is

apparently out there

it's not that far fresh to say that it's

something right

um here is a monster point I got two

crystal balls

well I had no idea myself

[Music]

okay

we could see who developed so I think

this game is Japanese

[Music]

Wings the Broken Sound thing a thousand

points got

it's not a certain point of viewing

mission

nice nice bumping

[Music]

so so yeah this came in Japanese

British so if they

so there's no connection like that

if they have like inspirations

[Music]

of this this game this is a Whoopi camp

or something

uh just looking at the beautiful thing

just make myself feel cleansed Oh you

mean the the the small Asian

we stay

it's out yes

yes that's that really

that really cleanses your soul

[Music]

well everyone has their own interests

all right so a monkey named Charles in

the village

he said he was so hungry he couldn't

move yeah

but I wanted to fix that

that the fountain is in the middle of

the square but it doesn't work

yeah I I watched that too this is

Charity Square yes yes

interior below the Watchtower is built

with the wood and isn't very sturdy

if you hit the sides of a platform hard

enough you might break it oh I should

try it

did you come here to see charity

Fountain now I just come came here to

see what it was

yeah because this part is beyond them

now

[Music]

remember the wrist

red plus blue equals question mark

let's see about that

[Music]

have you heard that there is a mushroom

in mushroom Forest that can make you

laugh all right

well I wasn't expecting it to be

mushrooms but I've never seen it but

okay the mysterious mushroom we'll see

about the mysterious mushrooms yeah so

they're taking mushrooms in this game

because apparently they're changing your

emotions

[Music]

it said that when the chair charity

companies revive it works once again

something will happen

well I I assume it was brainwatching

the ground pass here is like a slight

low cost quality Leaf sliding I'm sorry
