welcome

everyone I know I have a few seconds a

bit early

but see now it's

16 and look it only say

C It said c s

before so one thing i' I've

done

which I would like to show off on the

stream even if everyone here has

probably seen it

already hey there might be some

lers I should have prepar

it

but

what me

p

underneath P's feet Yes underneath P's

feet that's where you

belong

right rabbit Stampede tiny

one I hope you like that the emot or the

Emojis are working as it

should um what's see let

me trying to show

off there we go I'm B not exactly what I

wanted it to be there we

go I made this

schedule start before I could get was 10

seconds I mean how

how oh oh yeah uh okay first off that's

not correct because it's still missing

the uh

the variant selector making it into an

emoji instead of just text but yeah I

actually not fixed that I forgot to

actually do

it I but yes this is schedule I have

posted it on

the Twitter and I did post it

[Music]

on

uh let make invite this

message

wait wait oh I see I see what's going on

I'm going to say why why don't I hear

any funun is quite the musicians yeah

this is this is next week when I play I

did an update to it but I apparently did

not update the picture here so I will do

that

when when I get to the time

to there go

M beon anyway this isn't the map I'm

going to play this is the map I'm going

to play Inner

Space one person has put in a prediction

everyone here for watches the prediction

is open and one is willing to take part

in it and as usual the closest as as it

said the guitar I like the saxophone

thingy better because it's like close to

her Mouse the guitar is kind of the

wrong way

around so yeah the closest predicted

time will win therefore we at least if

one person has predicted something I

mean they will always be a winner but of

course the person would just win their

points back

so yeah the trumpet is completely wrong

and there's a plan of adding a mirror

function to

emojis and it's going to be for humans

but it really should be for everyone

they really need a mirror the other way

around as

well she's trying okay she's she doesn't

know how to play a trumpet like there is

a large hole here where she could put

her

face so maybe that's how you

played

uh so I hope everyone has a good time

here and I should begin the level and

not waste more

time I'm already wasted 5 minutes let's

go let's see how this map

looks oh look I'm surrounded am I

supposed to see the fly

buildings Mama M yep yep look at

this Mama

Mia wait did

that no wonder one of these yeah they

sure love to do this for some reason at

least I three helicopters this

time they're just killing each

other which is also the thing like why

even do that if the towers is going to

murder each

other so

thank

you

that's there you

go I want to turn thank you

so it's only in certain

places

I

mean yeah I cannot use the helicopter in

this map

but I could

just one I guess break

out oh no that was a

mistake

oh I did

it that was

close

um don't stop an enemy when they are

making

mistakes well I

guess

oh now I'm

stupid now was stupid they didn't make

meion no I'm

wrong ah that was stupid that was to it

done I didn't pay

attention there deep water and it's also

to squash

wi basically need to go

around no

problem I go between the

towers where I'm

safe

safe

oh not one of

these there we

go kind of hard to get out the there we

go not

one

tanks don't swim H that's true that's

true a just a brilliant

man that's sent

to one I was half as

smart realized

that oh no mine

I guess I'll do my usual

technique of exploding and

running just stand to be to this mine

for it's

trigger very close

apparently okay the sure

next

Easter so

um guess I'm continue work my way up

there oh this is going to be an

interesting map for

sure I

think

oh another one of De

again can't you see I'm

busy

okay there you go

oh falling into water B

here but I'm slowly making progress oh

no another

one oh nice

it's it got taken care

of stop spreading lights in p p

Channel don't to hit me are

rude well have you put in your predicted

time we totally take 45

minutes

well

[Music]

those which way should I

go

come

on oh you B shooting down near own

Towers I was hoping it would be a beat

better

right there

go well I'm making

progress moving up here through the W

where I'm protected from the

sides after removing the to shooting me

of

course

I

know I don't have anything to shoot

with oh wait I can't cross

there so I guess I just have to go back

again

so this is basically another map without

any place to fuel up but don't exactly

need it because the base is in the

middle for

once so I kind of have easy reach

Tower

yeah I

am don't you see the bummer next to my

name what a bummer and yes I

was too lazy to correct the me sping up

there so I just swapped the letter

around

instead buom there I see buom there

instead of instead of

bandare you're confusing

me

you are a very confusing

person come on shoot the T

there you

go good good good help me take out these

towers

good continue like

that

oh don't take me

out I'm running out of mun

destroying the towers too

quickly oh that's

it oh another

mine and this deep water here I need a t

Water

Bridge asro Malaysia f

you have quite name welcome

back hello P I am Dex M and Miss dog

what from a Sonic

OC is

that why isn't your usame de the dation

dog in that

case me I

think how I call you as Astro

Astro I think that make name you will be

Astro they want

come

I hope you have a good time

here hello in the

M I thought was a

skunk well I guess I learned something

new

today

destroy

those oh and another

mine come on come on come

on not not close

enough no thought that was really Co

that was

close all of a sudden

explodes where did you reaching me from

there I don't like you shoot

[Music]

me there we go hey course trying to K

me I learn something you too I

have

just

clear up there bit easier to turn I

guess I'm moving home

anyway we clear out this path here

shortly distance every time I'm going to

travel across here anyway there you

go

there we

go I'm broken out of

this this

prison I hope there's a flag it looks

like there should be a flag up there how

I'm getting

bamboozled

that would be

sad I lost one tank because I was

stupid I just I just didn't pay

attention and just ran straight into the

water

okay there we

go and then here

come

there go def easier to shoot it down

with the missiles than

they even though you only have to shoot

them once I guess this misses are being

or something I don't

know yeah there are flag buildings up

here two of

me when they just three of

them

out of

Miss I mean I guess going on outside

would be easier than going inside I

actually don't

know yeah pration time is almost up

anyone who wants to take part of the

prediction put in your points now how

long will it take for me to complete

this level it's based on what the game

says and it will based on the

closest time that has been predicted

for so if you want to be sneaky and put

in your points at the very end you got

your time now

only 2 minutes and 40 seconds

left and pon pon is showing up her

T yeah she

should I counted up I wrote a list of

every outfit people have requested on

the the requested outfits

thread on

Discord and plus some outfits I wanted

to make

myself and the list of outfits became

something like 55 and that's a lot of

outfits and that's actually because

there's a limit on redeems to 50 so

that's actually more outfits than there

are redeems for so I definitely need

uh that yeah

uh drop down redeem PK that I made

a suggestion for twitch to add it has

got

some people voting on already which is

nice but definitely more

attention oh it did not exist in this

building what a

surprise I can drive over with broken we

cannot drive that collide

with don't know

why almost like they forgot to remove

the Coalition after the building has

collapsed there's so many missile sounds

I can't even hear the

music

I I take get you that

too and one left

oh I win okay I'll be

back yeah of course oh right there's a

building there con

Ste of course I'm I ran out before I

could destroy the last

building and in um all seconds left

second left 10 9 8 it's probably less

time for you when you hear this you have

to put your

prediction and and in the event that the

time is equal between two different

predictions I have only cover this uh it

will round

up um unless you want wanted me to say

live yes it will round up because I will

assume there

are uh seconds a fractions of a second I

mean obviously there are fraction of

second that it doesn't

display I just assume there are some

fractions of a second there so I will

destroy that and then I have to go

down oh my so yeah it's it closes a

longer time than a shorter

time but the likelihood that it lands

exactly between two is so small

already so the benefit you you gain from

having the longer time is so

small technically have benefits but you

know nothing real is that you can take

advantage of

okay so this the shallow water here I

can there's a slight deep water there

for some reason and this corner here is

missing there should done some error

checking on this map to see just check

that every tide is

correct there are some errors

there we

go more flag buildings here have been

destroyed let's go down

and let's go down

south and see what they

have

I know you said it before but it's good

to have in mind for those who may not

have heard

it the contingency yeah that was the

thing I assumed you went

afterwards took me away this

realiz all oh come

on finally let's see if I can get out of

here

nope this isn't going good I drown one

tank I got another one

destroyed

sad

time yeah sad

times that flying root thing was so hard

to

hit Panda done

streaming face and P Pon

face are you streaming

panda

I'm look at that maybe it

should unless you mean that

depend not

depend what oh

Minecraft I know that

game ium

that so what uh but I really like this

yeah but nice see here

Panda coming to cuddle with pon

pon we saided lost our world because my

and my ammunition went

that Grandma power went out in the file

corrupted since my place want kind of

fre

oh that's terrible

and yeah I heard some f crap

and that's

terrible did PR far that

world a lot of history going wonder if

it's a way to repair the

F although if it's a PlayStation 5 it

might be tricky to even get it off the

PlayStation first

place kind of want to stop using

FAL a

disappointment emote though she might

show up as respond to exactly see the

[Music]

game machine is the disappointment bunny

and the eight finder we back where we

want just my last house oh you had like

a

backup I wouldn't mind having like a

Minecraft world but I really wish I feel

like the blocks are too big so one one

thing I

really wanted to see is like half the

every length of the

blocks giving a slightly higher

resolution without going too far I know

this like a mod it still plays in the

regular Minecraft block size but it

allows you to

like break down blocks in each Edge by

an eigh the size but that's a bit too

much and it still doesn't really

change enough the regular Minecraft

stuffff

obviously it would be a messy mod

nothing would have to change the world

generation

too that certainly would like to play

that no back up sadly well whenever

wants to get into I'm

to

yeah no another in

mine I'm not going to take any risks

now

[Applause]

well if you just want her to be

disappointed and I'll

continue I just don't want to feel like

I was aign

specific but I can I don't know I can

accept it that she's like disappointed

or

[Music]

indifferent and and

uh and I still want to do the bouncing

here pon pon which I will do when I have

the drawing tablet back I mean pack it

down I want to move

first and I want to do the gardening

today but I didn't do any gardening

today because it rained a lot and do

like doing gardening when after it has

rain is very annoying and and it uh

rained lost raining when I wake up woke

up as well and of course it is raining

on the day I was planning on doing the

gardening because it was not raining

yesterday or the day before that and so

on but I guess that's just

life hey I got shot how

shoot

I'm just traveling

here cutting to

Shar I probably have to make another

shortcut cuz I'm using up a lot of food

here I don't like how that is shooting

me

yeah just getting down here can of uses

up off the

fuel I probably have to make another CL

through

here

H H say oh

no D

it

yeah good

getat

kind

of wow tank fight

what yeah I don't like you shooting me

either what a

surprise

there yeah now it's very calm

here let see because she did start as

indifference but I kind think iort

itated with

disappointment I mean I guess it's kind

of

both

I don't

know me yeah it wasn't

me it was meant to be like no no real

emotion CU she was just going to be a

f no opinion of her

own

I need

to oh getting

attacked there you

go now I have much more

fuel more fuel efficient thinking a

shortcut like

that maybe I need to go take like the

other

tank cuz the other tank doesn't use up

as much

F that might be what I need to

do to actually

reach

there

well how long does it reach there we

go I didn't waste a not clearing out the

very way to

go

singing Pon

PS when I hope everyone has predicted D

the B they think it will be we got two

people

predicting looking at the number of

people predicting instead of

dry debating whether I should eat this

kind cheese puffs

well maybe you

should sounds like a good idea to do

maybe you should share some with

me maybe you should buy 100 bags pack

them up and send them over

to so oh this so so long left so far to

go let's try try the other the

tank yes

sure I'm still so far to go if I didn't

have to go down here to go around this

water yeah and then I remove this

thing and then I can continue up

here

and then go down here there

you look how much fuel I'm

Saed somewhere St Tower some

somewhere there they

are

supposed to think has so little health

so this doesn't actually work

well

H already out of

hands uh would you be able to eat 100

bags of shes before they go stale well I

mean especially if they're sprinkled

with Reaper pepper I mean they packed up

I hope

they hope they are

securely en cased in the plastic

bag

okay using a tank was not a good

option so far so far to

go

so

far moving across

here getting shot again how

shoot have I

done but think so much fuel just get

down

here

d

don't know things oh out of no

a I just didn't shoot it one yeah this

map is quite

something it was a shame I wasted the

tank right at the start stupid

reasons got annoyed by that

see this is probably to I would just

started the level at that point but I

can't really do that if I'm doing the

prediction well I guess I just have to

do this

one but if I this far

down good just going now

say

oh

Fu

wow actually something good for

once H would I be too many mins there

know

know

what oh to on the other side going

too

really going to mess me

up okay since I wasted fuel already let

me go back refuel tank and

then go for another

round

[Music]

yeah I don't know how long it would take

for those to G

them

so I guess that's an option I just need

to it's the inside that's going to be

the

issue

cuz I kind

of I don't really need that if I no let

ignore why would I even want to refuel

the tank over

there I just me see at the moment I just

need to destroy the buildings with the

flags and then I'm done

there and then I go home

again

so

easy fun fun like Su yeah that's still

[Music]

true one time iniz right for

now every

moment well I guess it was

because SE color of the ants Banner it's

darker it's like purplish

blue oh no I can't go across

there

no excuse me

hit where am I going next oh down that

tunnel oh

my guess I'll do

it that's the only past tense and

Swedish

F

well let's

start

that

wi

so basically I have to break into the

wall and after

that that should probably was than

yeah destroyed shter e

sh

okay well I

survived

oh and then when I get far down enough I

can break out of the warning on outside

again in Polish you

so

I had to work myself down quite

by

why

doesn't I'm going to trick

it can't shoot

me

no it can't shoot me

now you can't shoot me he's

gone okay I have to work my way a bit

further

down out of amunition and the flying R

thing is there no sweat I did

it

celebration

okay then continue down here wait

there's a mine here down

here there it

is

okay

so then take out those making it a bit

safer to cross some mine here

too okay

I'm clearing up this lemon thinks it's

so

smart but in reality it is so

stupid

unless you're talking about punon Pon P

pun thinks she's so

smart what

why would I think Pon

isn't one fair enough P the bunny bunny

sound known for being

smart they just broke the wall

there and I broke another

one I'm shooting the wrong

powerway okay here starts to be a place

where I

can break out of the

war out of munition

again run run little

tank you can get out of here why do I

have so many Discord

messages

someone is writing me have fun streaming

I

will I

will have

fun there's one one person who managed

to seem to contact me every time I start

streaming like is not best best it's

time to start chatting with

me obviously the person is not in this

chat but if you want to chat with me

you're free to do so well I'm chat on

stream if something private well in that

case it's have to wait on after

stream

okay

now what

Corner very bad place to

be

well let's just

reverse and see the destruction

happen so that corner p is not making

easy

perfect

ta see smart destroying towers without

wasting time

yes I'm doing my best yeah I don't don't

know why the animated emotes stopped

working doesn't make any sense because

other animated emotes are working

so it's not like I'm I'm not adding a

special case for fun fun OT they are

exactly the

same I need to deal with that

corner

so wait no that wasn't where

leave yeah here it

is and then I will get down to the

corner

but I just have to deal with a few of

them there's the

corner going to just do

this apparently not because I get

stuck come on come on come on damn

again and another

one apparently not they not getting

destroyed

quickly the St trying to reach

St

okay I'm taking I me too much

damage I'm trying to be a bit safe here

time to go

back

one time left

here there you go taking care oh and

then over

here than

care many fireworks yeah this this is

the fireworks Factory which is a level

Inspire

three

y not

Amun

Bo that's

it's p stream

now taking care of the business wait

taking care of business taking care of

business taking care of

business taking care of business and

working over

time I don't know I don't think that was

correct oh someone wrote to me on

are morning

but it's

late very late is like evening

now

anyway close

enough I still get a golden start do

I leave

here

1711 now it's

1712 it's very late how early do you

wake up I mean it's not like morning

it's very late for being

morning oh mine and then I have to

travel on this one

again and H still morning here yeah I

mean fair

enough 11 one here

ooh

ooh

not

corish not they

corner but this is well the

end

so is like this

[Music]

building

now behind

it come

on and then there is

that

go FL building

destroyed now I can move back they're

still destroying their own towers that

makes it a bit safer I

guess hope I not I have enough you to

get

home hello but

girl still no flag still no flag still

looking for a

flag welcome back to some more fire in

your in

return even though I'm not currently not

firing your turn they are firing at me

though I'm not returning

fire mint

salmon what what are you humming about

but

welcome

interest

hello do you recognize this

game is there anything other hum about

the game there's a lot of to hum about

here I

think like a mint salmon in itself

very yeah I should have enough fuel to

get

home

okay back to the map Che clear of that

area thata that

area

so I'll go on the outside and then I go

to that area I think nope not at all

what is this game about it is about

driving military

vehicles oh oh oh no mistakes were made

I was supposed to go this side I

think well yeah the the different

military

vehicles and you have four

types this tank I'm using now which is

uh light

speed uh

light wait I guess well

okay

okay you have one vehicle which is have

the most armor is the slowest but the

strongest it's actually not the

strongest

actually anyway you have three different

attacking Vehicles one very heavy strong

tank that is slow but can't take a lot

of hits this

uh this tank which is weaker

cannot take his money

Heats requires to hit enemy more times

to destroy

them but it is

lighter it's a bit more fuel

efficient where capture FL game oh

capture yes and uh and then you got a

helicopter a rexis welcome you found a

star and then you have and then finally

have the Jeep your the Jeep or H but

must call it Jeep now check the game

text and has a rot can yeah the tank is

the only one who can uh independently of

its direction aim freely and the team

can also just aim independent with Mo

direction of movement but you cannot aim

the team with je has just 10 grenades it

can Sur no 20 grenades

but the de this KY one single

shot

so so and the goal is to find a flag

which I call a Quantum flag because this

flag has the uh quality that its

Position will change depending on which

flag building I

check this is why iend to start by

checking flag buildings that are further

away first to to make the because

basically the flag cannot appear in the

very first few buildings you destroy

seems

like seem like almost hardcoded to the I

actually was surprised once I don't

think it's explicitly PR that way but

the odds of it appearing seems to be

very very low but it did once appear

quite

early so I guess if you're really lucky

it might appear

early

not oh yeah I don't I'm just not

expecting it to happen de is used to

collect the flag it's the only way I

carry flag

yep

very simple

game rules wise and my go currently by

streaming this game is to complete every

single level cuz I like the 100%

games and I'm almost done with the game

except that the game surprised

me with some

extra oh my not done with the game time

soon

now here's one of the flag buildings I

will check

later

so and the towers do like to this

one kind

of makes the towers kind of

silly

no no no not B aing there you

go another one of these

don't shoot that to come come on you can

do it there you

go well oh no and then the enemy also

have things oh I

got usually at shooting those now oh no

I'm us I'm out of

amunition run tank

run the shake how you doing

and also star I think I mention

it swimsuit and then sport Square after

that nice

nice ding tanks through shallow water so

swimsuit oh yeah you're going to drive

this tank okay and you're going to drive

it across shallow water oh that's fine

and you're going to wear a swimsuit and

what

why that hardly seems appropriate

military

where not sure I'll do it I have a

bit longer to go to find flank

I'm making my way over

there driving

fast I'm going outside which is kind of

a longer PA using up more

food hard to see exactly where half is

on that meter would be nice if it had a

marking oh yeah I was supposed

to shoot down the corners I think to to

make the path a bit shorter nonsense

it's a perfect thing to wear they're

going to they're going to he looking for

an army people not

B oh I mean they are going to look for

people in army gear not for a bunny when

seem if there a bun in a swimsuit they

not going to S that's the enemy I

see I see I guess it makes

sense

exactly yeah if they St a cute bunny

girl in a swimsuit they will not suspect

that to be the person driving the

tank I guess you're correct about

that

so much

shoting I can hand out to do music but

that much

noise yeah tank is taking a lots of

damage really you should dress up as the

Spanish Inquisition because nobody

expect Spanish

Inquisition

when

okay

indiff yeah that's that's me okay you

say

so

oh it's a Monty pison reference I have

not watched Monty

pison probably wouldn't be my thing

anyway people are tried to show me clips

but they're just not

funny like the human eating bunny I

don't see what's so funny about that

that's just how I think

is this is like a nature

video

okay so

um I do need to take some shortcuts

because I barly have enough fun to reach

the flag there

what what

what what's the problem

Alan

I sh down

this that killer rabbit even got

referenc in which three

yeah oh I shot it down

nice that's just how bunnies

are

he's not not a killer rabbit it's just a

rabbit we can find a k with a human

skull in a p outside and only a single

killable white bnny hopping around why

is it unkillable will it kill

you it should be killable but it should

be really

hard

when you kill enough rabbit as

soill lucky it non

hosle because I'm sure even Master stand

Char against it

oh

I did not take those shortcuts quite

well

dang

it

okay I need to be taking the shun B if

I'm going to do

this

yay

I got R of the RO flying

SC

so much easier so

much

yeah itively I make another

PA guys just don't have

enough

might

need it should probably be possible to

get those two

FL if I just be a bit

more fuel efficient

okay let's do

this

go got one

corner and then

[Music]

[Music]

yeah I mean it's not a ma amount

of aome cutting

but I'm using

p um

py across the land

here one of my favorite scenes from mon

p and the holy grain is the ni to say

me

yeah

see oh FL building isn't in there

shooting

next oops oops

oops

oh and the French man who T everyone not

sure not not famili with that one okay I

destroy this

too or the guy guarding the bridge no

idea who that

is

i f in your general

direction

okay I guess that's kind

of fart

humor I

[Music]

mean I feel like

I could have a bit more sophisticated

jokes that's the Frenchman

ta if you saying

so oh there they

are

boom oh they making progress and the

bridge guard he ask you three questions

answer wrong and you go flying after

cave

oh I wonder what the questions

are

H okay oh no I should go

there so asking arur what is the average

flight speed of an unladen

swallow

oh it's European or

African say I don't know and

send

what

that that wasn't that wrong answer

because it wasn't an answer to the

question a stupid

game

okay

anyway taking a lot of damage tr get

through

here because he answered incorrectly he

didn't because it wasn't an

answer it was a

question for asking for

clarification imagine doing that at

school

like if you if you ask for clarification

about that question on the test it

consider a wrong answer

SW

s

um

like I'm sorry for picking apart but

like it's not

even is it's like you're watching a film

and you you noce a huge plot Point ploto

hole I meant to say just doesn't make

sense and it kind of takes you out of

the

experience this is with me and questions

questions

ch um yeah

whatever that's just me I know I'm

it

I

oh I'm taking damage so quickly maybe

you enjoy some M Brooks I don't know if

I I don't

know it probably would be different if I

actually have watched mon Pyon like

quoting a lot

of scenes from a

comedy I don't think comes across as

like the impact they have as jokes isn't

really going to work for someone who

hasn't watched anything of

it I I said people are showing me clips

but the clips T it's B Waring like

nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition

like I've seen someone show me that clip

and like

okay what's the

joke there is no joke I don't get

it sorry if I'm not finding fun event

just I don't

know

no expect the Mal

position it's just me see get

it maybe has watch multi

Pyon

maybe I'm sorry if I'm boring

but I don't get it I just don't get

it

I was the whole gra gra

man I

knew that's fine if you enjoy

it nice you have something you

enjoy

nice most people like how can you not

enjoy this not my kind of human as

why okay

[Music]

now now should can of blind oh wait

there is nothing

here oh some's trying to shoot me oh the

last B destroyed it nice time to go back

okay I'm almost there almost destroyed

it you got do those flags to destroy

them

hey where the rabit prepare the holy

hang

grenade what is your

name what is your quest to seek the holy

gra what is your favorite color

blue I mean

I'm just going I just going say same

thing over and over again if you get the

reference you might find it funny I have

not watched it and did not get a

reference and I

think I

wonder I wonder how other people

like because I only like everyone here

is like show me clips and stuff they

have actually watched the

f I don't know if they're mult I wasum

there's multiple but the whole game is

basically the one every want ref first

to so

um and I

wonder if we were to show the clips to

other people who haven't seen it they

want react

we now just Court

yeah but that's basic I

mean I guess that's basically

I aren't since that's what everybody is

doing when every time see like

this and I'm I don't get

it I don't get

it it's not the question of how he grips

it is a simple matter of weight rati of

4 o per car one

pound this small thing is a running joke

yeah see see if if this like a running

joke I have no idea about that because I

have not watched it watch it and that's

that context kind of need to

have I think that's the problem people

just assume even though I say I haven't

watched it people still assume I get

context when I don't because I haven't

watched it I don't have the

context not saying you people do that

but I mean I have other people like

saying why don't you find this funny how

can you how can you watch this scene and

not even

react I'm basically the fal pon pon when

I watch

the so so now I

got one flag building

left can I shoot

it

yes I got it

done right

should our next one is over

there okay so

I need to go

back

resupply come

back and get that next last flag

building in

there hello usern name

because that's a great usern name I

cannot say

otherwise that is the best usern name

was is the the P gunon P well

um

Hello

can it

wasen

um wait wait a minute and

English vast

is something's off here with your

German unless that's a Dutch actually

Dutch because I thought it was

German did not look like

Dutch but yeah I speak English

flu I assume I speak Swedish fluently I

would

argue H I know some

German not to hold a conversation

though H but this is the pcer game and

the German P are

good they

good well I would be with an

S which still the same no no yeah it

should be S so it becomes Z good because

if it's SP with a z it will be

Z I don't know I'm I'm no German

expert but as far as I

know German PS are good well I don't

know if this is a German tank

considering the

the the um videos are of United States I

assume it would be like United us

tank what Ty it is I don't know it's

just

tank there as much detail they went into

the game it's

tank

I didn't mean toy

that you know I'm

M so close to

F maybe I can reach the FL Building from

here

let me see oh yeah yeah yeah destroy yay

no I'm

stuck

yes good and I destroyed one of their

tanks but a different t for

tank okay time to go

home and see where to go next but yeah

this is a tank tank tank game it has

helicopters and and the heavy armored no

it's an armored support vehicle and

ASV as they call it in the game and it

also has Jeep or humbe depending

on well us English version uses

humi uh every every on translation of

the game uses

[Music]

Jeep

there is no English British English

version of the game

translation one this one using the

British flag but it's not Bri English

anyway but I wonder if they actually

made one what term it would use juice

use uh

anyway so are you speaking Dutch right

now or are you speaking some accented

English I mean it is like German wish

wish where where they like a few typos

and I don't

know but it does not look like Dutch

so unless it is Dutch maybe maybe Dutch

is a ger with a few

Ty getting to this last one going be

hard

and that's not meant as an just that all

I see is chman with a few

typus it's genuine

D it just I I don't see the ey

onent which is very iconic with

Dutch

the ey consonant which is H which is a

vowel not a consonant by the way the ey

vowel the ey

dong

um which has a prefently reasonable

sound but the expanding makes English

speaker is very confused about

that so d word is using

it's yeah English speakers don't know

have it's

funny but of course I

mean it's not like I can read language

obviously yeah I'm working my way

through

that but is is pronounced I as far as I

know it's pronounced

I but it's still fun hearing people try

and pronounce it as IG which is Notting

me

f but I'm very happy to see some people

showing

up

okay now I'm going need to run oh make

steak oh that was

close I was pushing that a bit too far

a bit too

far s that quite distance to

travel

uh I cannot go outside because

there's Towers on both

sides

I was certainly not able to find a

command I would just run

me whenever the add a playe but I

wouldn't be surprised if they are

considering adding

it someone has probably already

suggested

but it might be added in some later

updates

to the

uh what we doing to enhance my streaming

experience streaming experience for

everyone else I

guess

oh already out of bullies oh everyone is

back come back

audience hope you survive the

ad I have so far not destroy that single

new flag building this is as far as to

come I will continue forward but at

intersection is going to be some

trouble but I will continue pushing

forward play Under p p ears Hello Panda

I mean you've been here

but but nice to see that you're still

here

and

H these Carolina Reaper cheese puffs

aren't as spicy as the ones from

yesterday maybe they went a bit

stain yeah

um that's the thing with food they

aren't

consistent I'm a P Panda sandwich yes

you are the P Panda

sandwich it would be py

draw I

need

I start to

Panda I hope you enjoy the star doesn't

do

anything star star star maybe I should

write that in the description of it this

one doesn't even s CH and SM go wait

what I mean you're missing the the

indefinite article there but

well yes you're a sandwich

nice uh SP yes nice nice

nice

boom boom I

thought if you were saying you something

you didn't need an article no that's

like if you're an object and you do

still use the

art like

yeah is a b

inconsistency

I

know oh no I'm on

attack oh no someone's chasing

me now he's slowly catching

up there there we go now it's

gone

okay okay getting

closer young inos but like

young there like more objective way to

define

that

cuz I'm thinking like if you I think you

know occupations you can skip

it making such a mess I want I wonder

like which terms

Jingo doesn't use it for and which does

use it

for I mean it might also be a dialectal

going one way or another

and oops oops

oops um okay I took a lot of damage from

that moving

on he making such a mess do you mean

it's making a mess in the language or

I'm making a mess

here it's

supp that

both I'm so close to that and

then and then also up and down and then

I got that collection

of

three flag buildings down here actually

Four I think CU yeah there's two two

North one West one East I don't think

there's anyone

set but we see we'll see where flag ends

up

being

go there you

go and then I destroy this wall so I can

destroy this building here we go no PL

in that one so now moving back no flag

here not that I wanted the flag to be in

there

anyway I mean I could probably move in

with there not in the S one I has

destroyed

whoa they are they sure to me going P St

shooting

me

we

go

okay I'm sitting on a

stool at the

stall I don't

know H yes

this war there we'll see we'll see

whenever the flag shows up I just start

quite a few fly building so

far and I'm getting close to finishing

this

level oh they're really destroying it sh

oh my dam I is such a

mess yes destroy

other come on continue

okay

so then I um

oh there it is well flag has been

found evil rud thing has been

found now it's

evil

when

well just need

to make sure it's safe enough

for the Deep to get through

here and I think oh nice and I think

that's than for

now let's see if it

works come on Jeep you can do it wa

shooting

already all right I don't have

uh don

don don't mind me I'm just piing this

up

and now I just need a

stram stream is sound hitting me or

something

[Music]

whoa that's a

success who is the

winner

that's is two almost two hours

exactly

H

that's that's

it's pretty

cool

so 2 hours almost exactly is

so well whoever predicted the well soon

they only have predicted 1 hour and 1

hour 30 that means to who have predicted

the longer time is the winner one the

winner one is the one who

wins um if

yes we actually Pi 130 yes 1 hour 30

minutes taada

congratulations I'm sorry

red it looks like you lost game

only mil

one 5,000

points and nothing good good good good

let's save this I have on

it next level

link

starting a new

prediction

[Music]

who in different F in the midd and then

Princess P shows up congratulation Aran

I'm

sorry but now it's time for the link

level yes the starting

position

is here so this time there's no rude

Towers is that going to attack me as

soon as I leave the platform but I will

assume which is kind of hard to see on

this map that there's a flag building on

every single

Island every single island is connected

by a bridge and there's deep water

between them making it impossible to go

through because it's at least two

pixels two

squares so that's the map

kind of messing with me at

moment

the yes

so what's that the fun level what do you

think is Panda here is here is usern

name because L

say name is

fantastic is at

work

me ni to see new people here always nice

to see

new new names that's much new faces

well well has been two mon two minutes

that took like 2 hours 11 18 116 28

minutes 9 29 minutes and then there

Metropolis so there's two levels left

wonder if I can do both this today and

then I'm done with this world and then

just

bonus level before yeah I mean it's fine

it's fair it's

fair

Yep this is the yeah there a flag every

single

[Music]

L well let's

go so many

mines take care of

this

yeah oh there the

okay wait I Sho

downo

okay would have I if they didn't react

to me so

quickly

no okay helicopter does not look like

it's going to

work just one flag

building okay maybe I can use the

helicopter like on this oh a place of

the bridge broke a lot of violence yes I

mean that at least you could deter from

the map

against

no

oh oh my

I'm using my helicopters

[Music]

wisely

[Music]

oh I change here with

[Music]

this

nice I actually manag to destroy

something

[Music]

there we

[Music]

go

it had some

progress

but yeah still a lot still a lot left

these cheese puffs aren't making me

sweat as much as they want from

yesterday well better return

[Music]

him

[Music]

and then I I just fly back didn't manage

to destroy everything though

[Music]

but yeah there's this play

missed still missed it ah still shot

next don't the

Jo the tow is not flight I mean I guess

it's still Val

but at least I get to fly some

helicopter

now still not done with this

Z there we

go complete complete

Miss

[Music]

come on come

[Music]

on still

not can't think to yeah

that

one no they pushed me of course I can

really shoot building oh those those two

FL buildings are going annoy

me J bird hey there hey Jay

welcome nice to see you I hope

everything is going all right with

you hi how's it going apparently I'm not

doing that well at flying helter so it

could have been going

better get that fly

milon this doesn't work I don't know

why but it should

work I haven't changed the code as far

as I

know so not sure why they would be

broken and if I did change the code

doesn't explain by only some of them

work oops sh

bre oh thanks

bike oh the missile made me turn quickly

oh

no I I guess that was the last

helicopter that was all the fun I had

with the

helicopters yeah that's the motion of

pon

pon oh go I will take this one

then

Let's Get r of

these here we

go s

time step

one

these

no where did you come

from come busy can't you see making it

rain

today well yeah with the

points I did rain today made me very

sad cuz it always does that the day I'm

planning that's

face like like oh yeah today is the big

day I should spend a lot of time

gardening oh it rains say done happens

like that many

times and even if it doesn't rain the

day it like rains the night

before

time to go

home and hydrate

too

hydrate

go

be right back

okay have

fun destroy all well I mean came easy to

destroy them after doing it with

helicopter Iman is hiding in the bu

Barrel

for

stop shooting

me fly in this one nope of course

not

I'm contining

on okay going to remove that

oneing me some

annoying and if you cost me some ANS

you're getting

removed

okay there we go suffered a lot of

damage I'm going to move back

home okay

so

helicopter can come

but every want

to now when you seen how the level has

gone I hope everyone has put in the

predictions I got one prediction so

far need at least two I mean

otherwise the only one who has predict

is going to win their points back

so that would be a plus minus

zero we almost at the

bottom how am I going to have enough fi

for this

Lon

that's what I'm worrying

about I guess I'm going to work myself

in columns from right to

left

because due to how many flag locations

there are this flag is not going to

spawn in last one

so just work my way

down

and the flag spawns there or

something like oh

easy

there's

more feel like I used to if

now that's a problem at the moment I

just don't have enough fuel to explore

whole cuz if this takes up half the FI

how that can go down to the bottom how

am I even supposed to even get

anyway this is going to be a tricky

one let's see how much fuel I have at

end

so far

home yeah I'm already running out of f

so this

is I'm really curious how I'm supposed

to

do

I am very curious so maybe I can't do it

in columns

then I might do need to do the columns

and rows at the same

time you know what I

mean still

swimsuit because it suits

me I'm

back let me see it's I am a back because

it's not an

occupation

t

j d one really

you

no what's

going ah what a waste of a tank yeah I'm

going to Fe this one

because cuz I'm doing the mistakes again

and drown another one of these wasn't

paying attention to which angle I was

going probably not not really paying

attention

because so confused how am I even

supposed to do this level because each

of these islands contains a few towers

and a flag

building I don't see anywhere where I

can fill up the fill

up how am I supposed to even reach

because I can reach all the way down to

the bottom of map and then I have enough

fuel to get back up

again how am I supposed to get anywhere

else

so I'm so

confused yeah I don't know why English

doesn't

that or English does

that good question yeah I'm bit I'm bit

distracted by that at the

moment

okay this time I getting across without

drowning

than and then I move back

and the second column is already done so

this one is the extra small part because

it's at the edge of the map they fit in

some extra ones

but the one next to this is already

cleared

out so I guess after this one I'll do

the first row and just hope P spawns

within a reasonable amount of

fls fuel

tank but did you see

some

okay I don't need to refuel it I can

just let it run out of fuel but I

already wasted the whole tank

so but that certainly cannot be the

required

strategy that Cas I've already

failed okay yeah yeah I barely have

anything when I reach back and that's

just going down this one so how am I

supposed to even reach the bottom left

corner I have no idea no I didn't see

any just ask was few T were distracted

by

no I'm well no I'm more distracted by

the lack of

them

if

something come on oh there we

go and of course oh another one of

this does not make it

easy

okay how do I get to the bottom left

corner

out

not and

not another

one another one

already let's get that

then

yay

well I just continue row row

down serves that flying ring

right

serves it right serves it

left this was some safely

oh guess

nothing

oh I destroy the door the gate not the

tower wrong

thing this thing oh the tower there we

go since the gate gets destroyed when

the tower gets destroyed so

and also the gate has the same Health as

a tower so there's no real reason to

shoot the gate

specifically it's better time for the

tower don't have much more

mition oh

yeah definitely not have hey stop

shooting brid

I mean at least this level doesn't hurt

too much if they destroy a bridge

because I can go

around kind of just see the fuel doesn't

last last that

long they tested the level by making the

flag appearin the first building the

destroy the story there one brought it

home and considered level compl pleas

[Music]

[Music]

up Sing Sing Sing yeah that's me

sometimes I'm

Miss sometimes Miss like

that

W this didn't go as good as no there you

go that's the one I wanted to

destroy

just with one of

you

oh that was was that

he see I like this

see well I'm glad you

do prediction time are up mind people

did

predict one person predicted two

hours and no one else I

one no prediction

then I wi I

mean I

guess did I remember the game eruption I

mean you alone so you can refund anyway

so I do you win or is the refund I mean

there's no losers

so

y I guess people are bored about this

game

and we're bored about doing

predictions no matter how long it takes

my choice this is the closer has made a

prediction that is

correct and there's last

one nice and mine

oh come

on come

[Music]

on I

go they better not be bored of this game

better not be bored of fun fun I mean it

can be B of the game but not of pun

pun but that's why I'm playing different

game two two games per week so even if

they don't like one of the game maybe

they like the other

one I think that's a that's a nice

compromise

yeah

yeah

but I can understand people getting one

of this game and this is the game

play wow such game plan again as I

reached I mean sure I did destroy some

towers and

stuff so I didn't Dy like the most few

efficient but

that's what makes an annoying here so

having to

drive okay like if I decide to go

down

stop shooting at

me have to like go around the

flag is that one is kind of in the

way of

course going destroy

those making the path a bit shorter

that's this one has sustained too much

damage already so time to go back

home

I'm trying to change shorts as much as

possible yeah I think this is not best

L the last one of this world looks to be

a better

11

so as far as I know it's not the time it

takes to drive but the distance you

drive that

determines the amount of he that is

drain

I think that was

a nice way to

approach

no you been sing to me

anyway

working one while at a

time

so time to go

home need need fuel

tanks yeah that would be something

calling out a big tank that can transfer

with

fuel I think you meant the C D all this

fuel

buildings fuel tanks those fuel tanks

not a tank that go goes out and fuels up

other

V what do ween

[Music]

to yeah F

Depot oh yeah

Depot I guess they're called yeah I call

everything tank in this game

see that holds at the fuel a tank the

attacking Vehicles tank when you put the

fuel into the vehicle

tank when you take shots uh because you

have a lot of armor and can survive the

tank

and uh hel

tank I don't

know can barely survive any

damage in know wor being call a

tank oh no a stupid mine in the

way

um come

on no I'm flying

interesting there we

go not in mine but at least it's on that

side of the buildings it doesn't getting

my

way

oh another flying

ring okay time to go home repair the

tank wa it did destroy a mine so

what did you say that was a loud mine

was

it I don't think

so this game loud hope not that man is

in a bad

place visible I mean technically yes

y already running out a few now this is

going to be very

tricky I need bring out the auto tank I

mean it has longer

reach better

fuel

efficiency that's fuel by distance

Dem wait does it already see me has a

good

mission

I want to destroy

it guess kill

the this way is not F efficient

because I would have to destroy so

many pieces of

buildings to make it f

efficient other way other way I can just

destroy basically these two and

then then I come past

you

well no already

out oh shooting the

bit

well well

[Music]

well so I guess I'll use this tank or

something I still still have three more

down there they care light tank doesn't

carry as much ammo as the heav tank it's

well it's also that the light tank

requires you to shoot more as

well on each

Tower his bit

bow well it doesn't have as

much armor see I have to travel back

just because I've taken too much man

hats this

one

that's

like can apparently very

sneaky yeah maybe it's meant to use the

Tank tank we

can seems to be very F

efficient also you can for some reason

they don't try to shoot you across

the W felt like I was was going to go

into the water

there not going to do that

again done that twice

today

not enough

to so I just waste it like that and then

I go back

home it's not waste I'm actually using

it I guess that was the

last

still running quite low on F

regardless as I'm destroying the towers

I do still have to move around but when

I

go between these broken Islands I can

just cut across like

this he broken as this destroy

[Music]

LS

so each island I destroy the more fuel

efficient I can

be if there's a light tank where's the

dark tank H good

question

p

p on

Pizza I don't think FAL pon pon likes

pcess maybe if you like put that whole

fruit with

its

peel cor for that fruit h on right on

top of the pizza maybe maybe she's

like not not too interested in just for

that

reason not that she's not interested in

pizza but maybe the way the pizza was

served it might be more of the

re yeah exactly now right pretty I still

kind of half P

though I

see that I

am one let's see I see how far I can

get

but no I'm running out of ammo anyway

so thank I could see I could see how far

I can go and destroying all flag

buildings on the southern

part or the botus most of

these

r that sounds

[Music]

disgusting fun fact despite what Brock

from Pokemon say this is not a jelly

field donut thank you for the

information F you are a very smart

[Music]

FN yeah if I do want to go straight

down let's do something out now

why would it be

any why would it be any any place to

refill

now it's going to be one of those

annoying

Maps there's something I'm

missing

yeah

because I must be able to reach oops I

about about this corner oops because I

must be able to reach the bottom left

corner even if it goes straight down

first or go far to left first and then

straight down and I must be able to be

able to

reach

nothing point just try to any buildings

now oh

no taking so much damage almost

sudden

when let's see how much view I have when

I get

back just that travel is making quite

tight how much Shield I

have yeah this might be

something this is supposed to be a fuel

efficient than oh it's not like I have

an even lighter tank with more fewu

efficient I have to use that for to

final switch thing

yeah I can reach a bit

further this is really

[Music]

really is almost is almost like it's

exactly so I can't reach reach

it

only the fly bu were place in the middle

here would be more efficient but I wi it

is what it

is

must really pay attention here so I can

spend the fuel

wisely I do have quite a good amount of

fuel but

ah it's like about down here should I

don't like to

here

shooting

the

come

on nice

is it more ficient to reverse going

forward I don't

[Music]

know course now it's distance not

[Music]

time and can I reach back

home otherwise this is this is a stupid

map

he this is

[Music]

very

[Music]

but it

worked oh my oh my how am I supposed do

this basically one must have to waste

the tank just to reach the bottom left

corner but

anyway yes the P Works nice

nice and bunch of P

which is those peris I can't see

really whatever you say

so if you say but hello Oris do you want

me to

hydrate this this level is

something and I'm trying to be really

really efficient and really

really like I don't think uh the game

should really require you to be this

feel efficient when you

playing Just

silly to me

[Music]

this forget it was

last didn't hat too much distraction no

to little

distra guess welcome

[Music]

back oh cutting close

yeah princess Pon Shing her pet cillar

oh isn't princess ponon a

cutie

and this is the last

one at least I don't need to drive you

know into the last

one see like I shoot it from a distance

but still

oh I really cutting it closer

yes really cutting it close there now I

don't have to go down to the bottommost

and can do the one before that

but but at the same

time doing

it I should have cut more

anyway it's better to use do them by

columns than rows

[Music]

cuz it definitely need more F efficience

to go down and up between this and then

going left and

right because up and down I can just aim

for the next bridge if I'm going left

and right right I have to go around this

thing

nope even there very close doesn't

count

now I should bring this tank

home how do I do

that could push

it I should enter

[Music]

it to take the

Jeep

and add

it and jump out of

it and jump into the

time I

know should be able to feel the fuel

from that yeah exactly you should be

able to

like Rel the base that should be

enough but yeah that's that's how games

are

for

wasting a lot of

information

can going

back oh no one of

these

[Music]

well I guess I'll just continue down I

mean the flag should appear

eventually

it's gone someone stole

it I wasn't looking when I was away from

the

base H must have eaten it yeah that's

the only

conation nothing else makes

sense stupid mind being

there and let's destroy everything as

a remind I mean I heard the mini map I

just need to look at it a bit more so I

can see that m is

there come

on I was a pixel off the bridge in

it

what should get in the food I'm being

bit careless when I'm playing this level

[Music]

at this

moment here's the

[Music]

mine

oh B damage

nice oh that one really Sho

me another

mind

not

here yeah because that didn't hit

it and it

man

[Music]

win

I just hope I can't find the flag

[Music]

soon go go go go go go go

go

well I'm working my way

down I mean Hest I

should use this one and not spend my

last tank which I probably

need probably use this one while I can

use

it I didn't know this

were

gu I can't really see what they supposed

to be when I in TT chat let's post

one oh yeah look at that is it because

it so tiny and small and tilted in the

chat looks like a

dumpling yeah now I can see

it

kind of look like a taco in

thing the windows

font what a cute game we have this

annoying this annoying isn't exactly

cute well hello Prince mittens the

kitten good

good

there Lely

[Music]

something

so I got to go do some paperwork okay

thank you

for by short time I will be back

eventually I will be awaiting your

arrival

l

okay time to go back

then well the flag need to be in some of

these

buildings when is the the uh gep has the

best fuel efficiency would be annoying

of the way but not that it really

matters it could just have the same fuel

efficiency as the tank over

worse as long as I can reach the flag

and move it closer therefore the next te

can get to it

earlier

in

oh woke up with too little

sleep okay so I can reach further

plus wait yeah so basically have two

more I need to go through I should be

able to reach that with

this

when no

B CA depending on which M you want to

use car means map it can means game map

as

well and

[Music]

Ne is like

level in the sense

of what

guess stage might be a better

translation

actually and B would be it means like

track

but it's valid for video game as well

not not track as in music but track in

like

racing

oh wait this one is missing a

tower one

interesting

come on this way and then there's a

stupid mine in the

way

on

uh

boom you're

right

we

go map map

map mum

lemon yeah

level can be translated

as I

think because level can be used as a a

stage in a game but it can also be used

for your

rank I think like leveling up your

character which I think never can be

used for as

well

I don't think uh level when it comes to

Maps I guess level feels more when you

have a and everything comes in squ

sequential

order instead of free order well the

worlds here are in there we go that's

every what did they even destroy that

mine

for about's done there anyway

so two columns done time for the third

one carrot for a f

bunny she she likes carrots even if she

doesn't want to admit

it

forish third

one look someone's been

here I can't wait to find a

flank get out of this L now I said 11

anyway this map

this yeah map I think is would be the

correct ter in this

context Oh shot me once how

shoot and it was flying too maybe we

should call it with the flying

musing such a crezy name I came up

with all

original credit pon pon bon

bon

flag well

then perfect

well then then we just do this and pick

up the

Jeep no Rabbit doesn't actually eat

carrot that came about due to BG SP I

was eating carrot which was a reference

to some character in an old movie played

by clar G

G who would eat car while speaking fast

I

mean

case you're not

[Music]

wrong finally getting out of this pain

of a

level

did

finally oh I was not did not like that

lemon p o n sa 1 hour okay same same 1

hour 70 minutes 12 seconds was not a fan

of that level

Metropolis I mean I feel like doing it

on level it's like stuff I was playing

to do today didn't

happen

and you know thing to as I said I was

plan to do some gardening that didn't

happen because

of massive rain I mean it has stop but

everything's wet and and when stuff is

wet it's fair you hard to do certain

leening you won the

level one level left and because it's

only one level left on this world I mean

there's another world so I can do the

next next World in next

week I think

it's don't you

think as long as people are watching

like four watches like my usual amount

but did I get pink

here wait

twice oh someone is posting in the wrong

Channel on on a on other streamers

server am on that stream isn't really

like that's F isn't doesn't have like uh

see we do the prediction

anyway but I'll have it all up anyway

any want to join but I think I think

better a bunch three watches left yeah I

think people are bored of this game no

helicopters I don't need

any

so

yeah if this is Metropolis very watch

out for Superman he want appr

appreciating you you destroying this

place I mean he probably he would

probably be on the red team Brown team

right it's officially the brown

team that's what is written on in

the in the help it says the Green Team

and the brown team it is not the red

nice to play an oops I'm shooting my

tower when when you shoot the tower the

first time the tower turns green and

start shooting

you it's it's betrays you because you

betrayed

it obviously it doesn't because I

accidentally shot it and it did not

betray me cuz the towers are just

computers basically they don't have any

form of artificial

intelligence they they just aim and

shoot that's their only

purpose

yeah like this just aim and shoot they

don't care what they

hit they just destroy

everything obviously I would as I

usually do try not to destroy anything

in my base unless it's a tree the tree

gets destroyed am I working my way

correct yeah I'm working my way up there

working way up to the flag

buildings why a your tur

have F here because turrets only fire

and vehicles not other

turrets I mean logically speaking they

should be sping at other turrets but

apparently

not lazy turs yeah they're a bit

lazy we

go let's do up this one because it's

green who likes

green

here we

[Music]

go move slowly

forward

Lev I don't have to worry so much about

fuel nice nice who

ons but like that have

been seem in a lot of the level so

far

yeah I'm kind of running out

of okay time to go

home out of munition

so which way was home I think this

way through this wall I make my own

doors

here yeah and

then down here

but then I did use this door and I might

broke through here jellyfish Vibes

welcome I'm going overtime this

stream Oh no I got stuck on my turret

trying to get into my

base but the TOs does not shoot down the

F flying root things either I think they

should but L the pro

phone's almost dead 6% battery yeah I

guess I was going to say that it's

probably going to be very late for you

as well so maybe you need to go to bed

and that's perfectly fine if you need to

and if you need to go you're free to do

soly don't feel like you'd have to be

here

nice to see you

here I like The Vibes you

provide with Vibes with

yish

okay oh why are you shooting me already

to me I'm going between the

trees oh what did that tree

do stupid

Tower

okay there we go oh

SP nothing in that one no surprise there

nothing in that one I'm

stuck and a flying R sink wish I totally

come up with the name last

map Totally

original fun F creation that's

the anyway

very late what it's only

1336 I know how work F enough stay

up I don't know your

schedule but I'm not to go down

here I'm supposed to go

here be right back maybe I should find a

place you can you know charge your phone

while watching or

something find a second

phone yeah you need a second

phone so that part is done then I need

to go to that

part very top

right the EA prediction going for how

long it will take me to do this

map anyone who wants to take part in it

and it's based on the the closed break

that time so even if you

don't obviously it's not going to be the

exact time written there but who who

whoever guess is the closest time is the

winner I cannot do like a free

input that would be kind of

cool stupid Street protected there we

go

finally I hit hit

it

no get

attack oh 10 in the

wa

okay I'm kind of slightly lost of where

I'm supposed to go so I'm going to

just I'm just going at the

moment we left two shots

left it would be nice to ref or rest

I have refuel oh I have

restock there going to be Towers in here

right no I destroy them

good

Go full full

of uh shots full of

missiles full of

munition obviously still broken but

didn't take that

W if I continue up there I will take a

lot of

damage that's not where I want to go oh

you're still here thought I I destroyed

you

h w whoa whoa whoa

whoa now we take it easy with the

missiles

okay I need to go homeair and see kind

of figure out where I'm supposed to

go kind of confused myself a

bit

ah here we

go wasn't that far from my base

switch me his back have we start your

phone H

so

okay up there basically yeah push up B

is charging good

good so if I just push up up up

up I will be able to go on the

norn

beach

and attack from

there because it's not like I care care

about going on roads I take them if they

exist

but but here they

are

come

there we

go that was a wall not Tower that's the

tower that's the other

Tower I destroy the gate

oh look a dark piece of land oh it's one

of those dark spots they

make uh but that's the first time I've

actually seen it been made like that

it's like it's like they made it like a

Farmland cre way of using

it destroying Metropolis noive Min site

yeah but it's Green Lantern has taken

over could land

for okay I'm kind of running after of oh

wait the flag building is here

okay this right

here there we go then miss

complete moving home hey they're

destroying the

trees such see the green L is causing

inal damage see look at that Destro two

more trees I would never destroy a

tree

see the only attempt I

miss yep out of min

I'm not causing any inal

damage Green Lantern don't you mean Le

loser he have a green

se you see like the green

one I don't know if green L Superman is

in the same universe and I don't keep

track of that stuff

oh I'm running off fuel let me correct

that not been bothered about fuels I

kind of forgot that I actually have to

be bothered about

F that's definite enough to get

home

um BL clip of pon pon completely destroy

sh oh yeah I

mean that might have

happened Superman and Green Lantern are

both DC so both in same universe see I

know my

stuff so that one is done or three of

them down there so I will move towards

the

West uh 10 minutes left on the

prediction and only one person so far

looks like it's going to be another fade

prediction

what is Rocket

Man well I can't blame that I've

actually not been

to one of his streams for a

bit um he has been streaming just

that I've been watching this other

streamers I'm sorry Rocket

Man He's also that he streams for kind

of short I mean I stream like for 2

hours I

think which isn't too short like I

stream normally for 3 hours so it's not

much of a difference I

guess glad for how successfully it has

been

don't look I'm destroying

trees was playing GTA 5 earlier oh look

at that oh this is the son of

disappointment and that's the sound of I

made a

mistake okay I guess I'll move home

then I guess I'll take this path

then and of course I

meant man I he that resarch

man he doesn't dare take part of another

prediction he's just going to

lose that is

why

game's called return fire not return

home now return fire I am returning the

fire at them look at

this oh look it was obviously I couldn't

exactly reach

it because I didn't have munition to

take out the towers but a great moment

of um running out of

munition

just trying to get through the jungle of

buildings cilling this place whoa whoa

whoa

as that's what to do

oh I need to turn

around no I'm doing

wrong watch is

Up's

gone excuse

me then has continue South here and I

should be able to find a f

buing whoop how did I see that so

late was about to run straight into that

mine and why didn't I ref restock mun

while I was

there good questions good

questions

there it

is

oh Mission then return

home your moderator disappoints me what

oh wait I can't go in there that's

that's

dangerous what do you mean

it's very p

p disappointed

with it I'm

confused disappoints wait no not

disapprove disappoint I don't know what

I

said yeah FAL pon pon is disappointed

about the uh

moderator wait who's the moderator oh

wait yep she

is wait a a minute I destroy one flag

building didn't I say there was three of

them there is three of them I kind of

disappointed myself there now I just

need to go back well at least I got a

repaired vehicle this time

I'm sorry fa pon

pon I will immediately go

back I didn't imagine F pon pon being

able to

speak I was Imaging her to be

like an actual

bunny

that was kind of the

idea but then she turn into a bunny that

just doesn't care about

anything I'm not

disappointed your moderator well maybe

the moderator needs to do something

about that

then I only got one moderator active at

the moment

so why can't I shoot that

tree okay good there's another fly

building down

here maybe it's because I'm a rabbit

therefore I understand what the rabbit

rabbit are saying

not that far rabbits have a

sophisticated language system anyway

but which means that the whole idea of

making a device that would translate

what an Anal says into like full English

grammatical full fly grammatical

sentences doesn't really make sense

because they aren't even speaking any

from of grammar in first

place the only only thing you get is

like I want

food I want

attention come more like food

attention there we go

now the three buildings are destroyed

now I can move back home now the mission

is actually

complete when s a missiles through our

jungle and it managed to miss every

tree

nice

yeah you probably understand her because

she's a rabbit I hear nothing she's just

looking at me with this

disappointment wanted look in her eyes

yeah that's what she been that's what

she

do

well moving

home and then I have like one place

left this level really don't fit in with

other levels of this world this is like

a normal

level mix together with crazy

levels

yay there we

go

H okay two buildings left is either the

further one or the closer one I'll try

to destroy the further one

with

there

without having to go around

eming can actually fight with Towers

well prediction time is

up

yep it sure is and what do we have we

have one person and and no one else

okay no prediction this

time oh

well you win by default

congratulations how does that make

you one participants

whoa let me again yeah it's not going to

be recorded in the statistics though

because I mean you want zero so there's

no point of recording

hey what you shooting my

tower just shooting my

tower that means you

die see I can stand up for my

TOS not completely

heartless

the watchtowers does not contain a

person or I mean you when you shoot them

there no person runs out of the

Watchtower it is possible that there is

a person in there who just

died but we don't talk about

that oops I S shot another one there go

miscounted

what two two TS very

SP want it fing massive

damage

than how much SP

oh no not another

one

boom nice

nice problem is of course you have

taking massive damage

d

w that one didn't die there we go now

it's

dead so I need to return

home try the tank and

see stand out for your turrets but they

stand

oops I didn't pay attention doesn't

matter quick way to get home I mean I

don't think lots of one tank is much of

a

loss yes I had to break through that

gate and

then I can just move towards the

flank building which does not contain a

flank

I didn't see that I I wasn't looking at

screen which of course is a stupid

idea not watching where you're going see

this is this is

uh

certainly a good uh message to learn if

you don't watch when you're going you

you might end up running into

mind

I basically have to go through

here

stop stop shooting oh look

water that's shallow water where is it

deep

what would be weird to have deep water

in

there

oh the tank

exploded okay move out I need to get out

of

here oh there's a

mine I that was a stupid tree I had to

destroy

so I'm very close to that fly building

get out of the

way over

reacting well until it was too like yeah

when it exploded it was very obvious

there was a mine

there unfortunately in some countries uh

that's a bit too

real stepping on mines that were left

from walls decades ago yeah I've heard

that Bosnia has like areas where there's

risk for mines where they have to clear

out the mines

still I've never been to an area like

that so it would be weird being in an

area where there's an actual risk that

you will explode if you go

somewhere

anyway moving

on so some

yeah I this one or

something in here stop shooting me or I

will shoot you I mean technically I

don't shoot things that don't shoot me

unless they any way of course don't be

in that one thank you that means that

the flag is only in one single building

unless I missed another building in that

case it would be kind of

annoying inin tank moving through don't

shoot now it should be

in one this tur is guarding

it so I will destroy

them I mean they're probably weren't

close enough to actually hit the Jeep

but

whatever

NOP I

win that happened let's bring in a

tank let's let's make this

quick okay which way should I take go

down here I turn in yes and then I turn

here let's get rid of

you and you looks like thank

you but now you have to

die I appreciate the help but

only and here it is

this one pieces take way too much to

destroy

so oops oops I destroy my

tower

okay only two watches left D watches is

really dropping out at the

moment let's go and get the

flag come on

[Music]

that's what I wanted you to do it wasn't

so hard was

it

[Music]

thing it took you longer to get flag

because it got stuck on a building only

the building was completely destroyed p

and 39 minutes and 6 seconds a pretty

pretty short level compared to the rest

of levels of this world but that's it

for this world still got the next

world but yeah there we go I completed

the 11 completed I going to

check yep every single level of this

world and

tomorrow it's not going to be a stream

and next week on Thursday same time is

this well I do have this cand here in a

completely new format isn't it

beautiful look it's F pon

pon he's here joining us on

screen isn't she

Kitty

so and this bar pump on here why don't I

have point on this screen either wait

let me go fet it

uh copy back

here

H

paste there go there we go wait what is

it

I mean have copy it over certainly would

copy over

the so there we go this B should be two

half times taller than this picture but

this is displayed in is high resolution

based on Twitch emote yeah there we go

this is next week oh not this week isn't

it

beautiful covered everything and I tried

to do some something here marking that

this is so even though it says Monday

Tuesday Thursday Friday this is

technically Tuesday Wednesday Friday

Saturday in Australia but it's really

late at night if someone happen to be up

you can always watch it for I'm

there yeah it is it is what it is can

obviously not have a perfect time for

everyone it's amazing think I it's a

very simple and clean design I

think I think it's it clearly shows

everything it needs to

show and if it's no stream is quite

obvious and

stuff to be really

clear come on come on he see and GMT so

yeah no confusion

hopefully oh yeah if you if your time

zone isn't here uh hopefully you have

one close to the other time zone or you

can

just add or subtract the times given

there and you will get your time

zone it's what it I like it it's good

that you like it I'm happy that you like

it and I hope people like

it the old schedule style is still up on

the twitch about page because that's one

is going to be like

active like those it doesn't show

specific games or anything and then then

I basically have to update this every

week but I made it's easy to

update well

done

so why don't we go and watch Panda anime

doesn't that sound

[Music]

funny he is starting up at the moment

but he doesn't take too long to start up

I

think see where is he where is he in

starting

process

[Music]

um yeah he's

basically yeah he's

still starting up this stuff right so

probably

going yeah yeah so I

think think we should go there

any anything

else I mean we be a tiny amount of

people watching at the moment so I think

we can go there even during the startup

page so no problem so what's more H

socials enjo rest of day I would eat the

burger as I usually

see hope you had fun it was fun I mean

the one the one that level got me really

frustrated

I know made so many mistakes on it but

the last one was a much better level and

I didn't to really any major mistakes on

that I mean still lost vehicles but not

nothing like

major like falling into water that

stupid of

me H I'm not sure if there was the last

level last level was that I don't even

remember which link was the last level I

think yeah yeah because cuz the first

one was the walls of turrets which took

quite time to go through but yeah yes

very good for

p yeah I don't know why it doesn't shake

anymore really weird I have to look into

that doesn't make any sense to

me

well it's

way making a drink so well I guess we

show

up when he's

gone I said I got too much not too

important

[Music]
