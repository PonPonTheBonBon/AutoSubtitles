hmm

with him

is the music Martinez it should be

it's very very quiet music

comes from pionics nice to see you

yeah I'm pretty much so I appreciate

every machine again

the sound of the counter doesn't count

over a thousand

the 40 minutes since

a thousands messages

that's

now

we go now

is for me too

[Music]

thank you

what a bunny yeah we're starting off

Italian right now what should we go for

this one

yeah that pixelated

switch built-in emergency like subhead

I do like sugar I actually had chocolate

here already

chocolate

or or chocolate so let's go to Unreal

editor

so I have to start a new project

a games project

it's a little bit blank

because

I'm not actually going to make a proper

anfield project I'm only going to use

then we have to convert the files to the

game format

so this shouldn't matter but play Prince

is the one that should work and then

preferably I choose never started

comments I don't have to bother about

that and then I need an increase

now

this was what I was going to do last

week but I only had the

4.19 version installed which is for

Spyro this is 4.24 which is slightly

different if you used to be used

but they do use the same I mean I can't

change actually yeah like 0.24

to ensure that they are separate from

each other

which which I'm really really should not

understand but if they cut less

I'll call this one

or something but the finger really

replace more effective I need to be more

specific

Coco

or something

or should it be Coco popular

first all of them will be good to

getting affected me to

tell person create infinix

okay today

the loading window priming didn't count

okay

[Music]

thank you

so here we go here's our name

what really matters

because I'm only going to use this for

the content of it that's only what I

can't but now

sounds good

and outside

happy

birthday months

like this one this one is so funny and

it looks much nicer when it's me

currency looks nice

but it's easier to tell him to speak

that's fluffy tea

and then the details like on the ears I

mean the refunding Rings

so

what I have to do here

is to

create the plugin which is I'm not

editing

so I have to do that

but I don't need to add it yeah

this phone is empty it's

so I need the name of the wish I had the

I have it

the the plugin exported so I go to is

this sugar properly

it is no it doesn't show this many

but it doesn't show this menu

it doesn't matter too much I guess

oh that's actually shows me nice

so I insert the name

I should put content only

and then create

don't need this no more

yeah good

then this button which I don't know why

it's hidden because this is

all the folders and plugins and

everything created it seems like a very

good scene to have

so

um because this is a toy survive game

it's basically the same

design as

the same structure as inspired so it's

name is mesh folder

there is the textures folder

but then

the

Armature what the old character is not

going to go missing oh there is going to

be something else

foreign

[Music]

foreign

this one is made for fortnite

originally

and then later added the balance but

this works for any

or basically any

unreal game

so I just need to add the game two

this F minor

and then as long as restarts

and

it does not want to show up

[Music]

maybe we show up when it's downloading

nope

mine

I found it

so I'll just load all the files I guess

that seems pretty quick

two six to 672 virtual class 11 exactly

and then plugins and then we find

character

and then it's playing

and then this one did I use

okay

the one that's called CP for character

plane

and then it was

purple

[Music]

yes that was in the content

and then what smile is the match

and here goes a few files you should ask

him pH which one get and the missing one

is the scale skeleton I need to figure

out where that was but here's one thing

more seeing when it comes to replacing

cocoa with planton cocoa which is now a

more question to give people

cocoa has a tablet I cannot simply just

remove the tablet because all all the

animations are assuming the tablet is

there so I mean I'm gonna have a

template that's the problem and but as

seen here there's also the two shoes

which for some reason are two separate

models and stuff used invert and one of

them

which kind of means I guess

um

which

um allowed me to do another month much

funnier just can't happen again

a tablet however Coco has two shoes

that's like one crocodiles the two shoes

fly up one

without separate measures I think you

just pass those two meshes as part of

the animation

but one Pawn doesn't have [ __ ] oh

a rabbit field

that's that's it

do you want to do you want it to

announce the cubes to you

sorry sorry you

there's no s at the end

thank you

GM

and that's an abbreviation

but welcome I'm happy I'm happy to see

more habits here

you got patapony

we got

a few

morning it's

um

[Music]

afternoon but

it's saved

I have had problems sleeping recently

but I feel I'm getting back one two

I bet it's extension now I said

[Music]

and I ain't saying

so here we go here's the actual skeleton

I'm looking for it should go in a plugin

called character common no problem

against coconut

go back to unreal

and the plugin which again won't show up

on screen mirror

it's a pretty simple

because I have a custom plugin

waiting for the beds to go close this

and now we have a cat coming

so rest of the past content no I didn't

want to open that

content is a foreign

and then it's just animation and then

it's called scale hero character

yep and one more something

or the First full episode

clanging

so this is oh that is needed

so far so let's go back to blending

and

I just properly set up now

this one doesn't have the

Armature set

interesting

so anyway with these two now

detection this is going to be with the

mix

foreign

[Music]

this one is used here

and this one is this here I'm gonna take

this little something

this one is almost

and spices there

so

wait where are the Texas missing

oh yeah

doing now

all right

[Music]

I changed it open it takes it from the

wrong

oh dang that doesn't work that works

so that's

[Music]

I think there's anything

anyone wants to ask me it's

I'm taking it

if there's anything be curious about

anything

so there we go

so much I'm curious about is

we just need to Denise

I guess that's fine

so I take these two

[Music]

along with the Armature like this

oh yeah I was supposed to put up the

seconds because I could see what was

going on when I was

whatever

[Music]

and I guess it doesn't show up here but

[Music]

it's basically just in default export

settings plastic standard communication

you do for spray modes into the section

here

I'm hungry finally I hope to find

something to eat

so

go back to

when you saw this hearing and now I

exported this one

yeah if I had a second screen I could

probably just capture the whole area so

I don't think it's actually show

everything I do

prominence if

something that I don't want to show

shows up

it would be like I'm more than working

on it I'm not really too easy

[Music]

[Music]

so importing

oh no

and

[Music]

following the bones are missing from the

bite

is this going to be an issue

oh yeah I've got nothing

else

actually I think my name is

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

foreign

names of stuff

so this one is

it's part of the name

that's this one

don't be with ph instead and finally

this one

[Music]

is going to be moved to animation

thank you

and we need

in this scale here okay

oh nothing if you have no kids food

and I think

for time being this is all I need

nope

[Music]

so

I press cook

[Music]

[Music]

and I might be playing that

I can go back here

and create the cocoa Fielding

[Music]

and the cocoa folding

[Music]

it's going to be called The Following

EPC 704's on score

welcome welcome

the whole party is me

[Music]

foreign

and now it has

completely

speaking process as technology

in the show of day

progress buttons

[Music]

add it to this folder now it's here so

all all I need now

and is to

[Music]

add these shortcuts which I use on the

olive oil actually amongst the shortcut

so this is the e-pack thing

since we're going to have two changes

which I'm not sure

so it made me

oh God would be a different name and

instead of saying fast food lava

and of course

it's it's

not just I don't know

[Music]

it is nuts

your name

not to treat me

[Music]

locked out the circuit

but I'm pretty sure

yes I forgot this shortcut

it was always so have to be seen still

it points towards

the correct spot again

[Music]

so now I can open this one and it opens

the

trash bag could fly all day

very nice shortcuts so since I put in

the files I need I just run this one

and then it will

speed out that time

and now I can only hope for the past

so

well this one says close by let's call

it Flash

and then I run this

and hopefully in the game launches

without any issue

all right

okay so I need to

let me add

crash four

well

that's not what I wanted

[Music]

crash four one more time

and

okay there you go wait what's

this we're deciding

I don't know what it's going to say

oh

so much for playing for the game on this

[Music]

well it was probably wants me to launch

the

nice

and I'm gonna have shortcuts

better.net

oh welcome back to him in

[Music]

foreign

yeah before

for some reason

well I guess that's a topic

one at a time

[Music]

and why isn't the audio system shut up

[Music]

and then anything

I don't need it keep background music

anymore

as you could probably do something about

this

so

my question oh it's about time

it's about time I test these mods

no I've made action before

regarding the tanky beans about time

please wait for logging also that W said

that there's nothing you need nothing

private going on at the start here I

don't know it's

you never know what these games

that was up on screen

not for this is

thank you I guess that's my username

though

and they have one same slot

but they're not in any

one ingredient

my plan for today

I'm

very very

funny at the moment

it's too fine that that became a

different way

I don't want to start with everything

with me I wanted to go to the menu

connected to the menu or do you have to

do the first level I can do the first

level

but I wanted to go to the menu

let's keep it for now because it's not

19. no I can't create this menu okay

first off let's

um

set controller buttons

I was

because I'm

here we go I think

his name

that's what specialist

I'm using

let me

I think I said set it to something like

that

just now

oh nice nice leg there

okay let me just oh my this game next

though in my opinion I didn't like no

everything though

oh is it is it running it's on it no it

shouldn't

nothing wrong with that card

it might be

yes because everything is not working

like I wanted stuff to work

is it because I'm running I've been

attitude back then something

found me

bank there's some of the programs I

don't need anymore

and I think I need the pressure of

obviously in the background I got I got

blender I mean I can see everything's

been a lot and then open up them then

when I get back to working on the mods

that's the problem

hey

[Music]

[Music]

we only want to be

any day now

give me

um it's it's so slow at the moment

and it's like no nothing around the

stream is going to act like this

is my audio uh being wet again

like when I was playing Crash

in Century

or does it sound fine I press and then

press open

with no Samsung

is this just going to be how crash

gameplay is

terrible audio

terrible thing like it's like less than

a frame per second

oh no I die

but I didn't die you must die

yeah this is

a beautiful gameplay here right now

why is it so terrible at the moment

let me restart the game

and let me check

this is a pet shop it would start to be

my wife now it's just a yes tablet

moment

playing play Inspire just fine but trash

yes

why is everything stream is now at this

moment now we close the game blender is

closed already that interest because

everything is closed

then

but it's still

and not laughing but it was not working

man

I'm coming all the way from space

it's just a mustache right now well it's

it's currently it's more like trying to

make the game Run but this set to use

the bow

graphics card anyway so that's not the

problem

and

when my idea is a big new game that's

what I'm flying on the computer

[Music]

so yeah I did add the Pom-Pom Coco tag

fine

um

oh yeah I was supposed to remove the

video files so it's good good enough

just starting games without these

loading speeds

let me create a bow left work loading

okay

and it's all these bumpers that I put

the bumpers in the film

and then you didn't have to consume that

it doesn't really matter because it does

this building's been here anyway so that

shows that the time but I don't know if

it saves times loading

that's not the progress bar that's just

an animation

you just finished up and then

and then after all that

nothing

because it doesn't want to start up like

that

it has

because it was the piano

yes as I was going to say

to just wait sometimes

where's the Nets just like steam Shell

City

products to purchase

it tells me here's the amplifier

and

okay I guess that was

and then it tells me the game is rated M

that's not a valid rating

I'm from Europe

and

and panel.net is sent to Europe

so I have no idea why the game is gives

me the wrong or anything

but I guess that shows kind of the

quality

I think the quality of battle battle.net

can I

yeah I wanted to move

anyway

it does run better now does it sound

better

yes 17 is not a valid rating

does it doesn't matter it is an invalid

ranking that's my point

why couldn't why couldn't they give the

correct 19 that's my question

and then obviously they I mean that's

the next question aren't they legally

quite true because

I guess not because

I don't it's Sweden does not required

everything to be used it's only like

recognized

it's commonly used anyway but it's it's

not like required

this is fine because basically every

game is using it anyway I'm just a

rushing soon it's never that moment

I I will play through the game properly

I really hope they

audio for my me sounds fine

and then I'm

pick up masks so I don't live stem

anime

what

it's speed running

or a bonus but that's you know that

oh wait

there you go

Elon Musk and shot the gameplay

gameplay

no come out all right

that was bad Timmy

okay there we go

now I can go back to

one linked foreign

skins yes that's quite useful or

so I can have different skins but no I

don't want to play next level

it sounds fine right now that's good

doing quite much for the first time

playing this game I'm not playing the

game for the first time

I can't play this before

but yeah the game is not performing well

at the moment

is there a good level okay

I guess I'm just

yeah I need that mask apparently

but

and also you don't get to keep your

masks to the next level

so getting a triple mask in this game is

a bit tricky because I basically have to

restart

oh that's like that it's meaningless but

anyway because I'm not

doing fine team

only is there plenty of checkpoints I

can use

wow

that timing wasn't between

okay

at the same time

and these cutscenes are in Game except

they will respond for some reason but

this isn't for now

even though you can't replace you this

physical family

and I guess I mean I can I think I can

after I get to 11's next screen

so

I I uh I could keep this save

for only

so I can do these levels properly next

and when I actually play the game for

again

but yeah the game does not shine

smoothly but I can probably do something

about that

run crash run again

so

I never complete so it's two levels

and then maybe go to

yeah and then this this is in this is

pre-rounded

yes it is

and even the premium cutscenes are like

so the very first cutting you get when

you start a new game or when you start

at the first level and then they got

seen at the end of the second level it

also prevented then there is one

somewhere in the middle of the game

it doesn't get it why do why aren't it

premium did I get like

party at like

when they play the game first time

you're going to have default crash

and you're not going to have a crash

with a different outfit

but

anyway

well

the mod is clear not working

so anyway but I got them this far so now

I can't quit gaming as soon

so now next time I start the game I will

I would have access to that

immediately

but okay now the next question now I

have to start

[Music]

now the question is why do you need to

replace cocoa

fantastic question now

[Music]

all right

however

hopefully I might be able to get access

to um

so now it's everything 20 testing

I might be able to get access to high

performance in Computing meaning that I

can play the game smoothly before I

start playing the game guys

so so I have a focus on other question

before that

um because it might still take time to

complete the more anyway

and I do want to complete it with my

planning

[Music]

is it a different Nursery from the

default coconut it I mean um okay and

that's me

and I am replacing the uh

default okay I mean I guess it's kind of

hard to tell them what's going on here

but

the only way I could make sense is if

[Music]

it is not CP connect being a place and

it's actually the cim exactly

but that doesn't make sense because the

cin which I would assume is the

character

in

interactive movie and I I at first I

thought that I am that student when I am

[Music]

and the interactive cuttings

I feel interacting makes sense to me but

I did not instantly

[Music]

however

that's not the version used in game the

last version you think because looking

or closer at the cim model it does not

have for example people's games it does

just have

[Music]

it doesn't have the unified skeleton and

instead spawn and that's not how the

game works

so

can I

please absolutely yeah the name of the

flash should correct didn't do the

package working inside it

[Music]

wait wait

because he did make his patch it has

file content but

did it package correcting

that's a good question

I could check that and

I can do it I was starting

a engine and basically just

loading the content of the files as far

as you can tell yeah it has specific

uh like I can confirm that it has done

that quickly

[Music]

so next I guess is to check that my plot

display

and plugins yes characters especially

now it's quite expensive

[Music]

player

and and then it's

like me

I'm stupid

obviously doesn't it

should be a Content folder because I I

didn't even create a content for all day

and then I had to specify where I only

found this one and she's going to match

for their completes we got that part

time it's silly now we should go in here

no wonder it doesn't work yes I had this

suspicion that it wasn't

replacing Define this because I played

the fans in the wrong place

now

it should work

so back to the question

and hopefully now I don't have to play

the levels anymore so now I should hope

you not have to close I'm going to edits

anymore

to save me some time

please wait for loving

I think you don't have to do diamonds

I guess

I mean

it probably does some kind of

DRM check it's just more seamless

yeah yeah let's go straight to the map

oh there we go this is working

obviously the texture is you're wrong

but

unfortunately everything you said your

Snapchat of my head I did not understand

well

Owen

but as you can see the mesh is working

and I said I have not done any texture

works so the texture is just deep of

cocoa but incorrectly map it's about on

the body

and of course says can be seen

foreign

but the for some reason the eye breaks

and

I have this outfits

which is this electric skeleton I would

I will make one of those for a cocoa

Coco

that's one will also be available so you

can play a skeleton

yes

looks like she's running around me with

no choices

yeah she got the sleeveless top and

bandaged legs not sure what's going on

the back side

and then just

gloves maybe maybe she has this bright

hands

and then some short sleeves that I've

completed my wrist

foreign

but yeah so it's working it's working

I would say we can

go into the level and just look at some

animations

and leggings

for their arms

okay let's eat this

now the animations aren't working

so yeah

perfect

so what's next

okay

um

I should start a planting again I think

the game was running smooth and in the

show why it was trading so much last

time I started

so

I need to add a tape I do want to make

the upper body a bit wider and lower

body like the hips beat my deep relax

and if you like this part should be

eat out yeah I feel like the upper body

is a big mouth

um

foreign

but that's me

I can't

so

I could

because I wanted to make the upper body

including shoulders a bit whining

but I need to find that

hey

good amounts

all right

y'all never put anything here

and I'll say it as I haven't started the

message thank you

again

foreign

music

[Music]

which keeps on getting flagged on Twitch

for being

uh

dumb song called unknown Title by and

practice known as unknown artists

[Music]

and every time that happens

I just find one of those which is so

much nicer onto it

that is on my video doesn't contain that

song

and then they want you to fill out all

these big old stuff

I do just fill out my name and then and

then you have to a bunch of hot stuff

you have to fill out today don't fill

out any of their stuff stuff because my

good eye because I don't use that thing

I mean like

um all right sorry about this let's play

request

These are nice statue because if they

make a claim it's an automatic claim

there's nothing someone maliciously

what if someone is a claim like

[Music]

you are using this that you are not

legally allowed to use

and I'm not using it

obviously I don't have to go through the

whole legal processor I can't say I

don't I don't use it you have to prove

that I'm actually missing

[Music]

and luckily

as far as for me Twitch has been pretty

good about that kind of stuff

and and release the the honestly

the fastest thing I've ever kissed

[Music]

which is nice

foreign

[Music]

what's the fancy word for arms because

decapitation other than

cut the head off which would be I'm one

of our friends

apparently I can't spend the capitation

wait

our respect the captivation of

decapitation

thanks pinky I can't spend it apparently

okay there is there is the term which

team if you look at if you look up

decapitation of dictionary the first

word

is in Swedish business and decapitiating

which would be the same origin of the

English word

however I don't know if that's an actual

word used in Swedish I have an

activities the other one is house

spooning

which is a combination of

the word for throat and to cut basic is

basically cutting this out

[Music]

of course then there is the English word

to be hands which is a more literal

meaning of

based on what it

it's more clear what it means

foreign

[Music]

English that has been one of my

struggles

so many words doesn't really explain

what they are

[Music]

which I probably mentioned before but

yeah

my life growing up blood is English

one of the things

which I guess was taught a bit for a

Dance Movement

I got the concept eventually watch the

whole is the marking

how when

[Music]

and yeah it was

it was weird to me

for some reason that's a thing I

remember that I just found it it

obviously isn't weird to me now

but

at the time I didn't know any other

handsome Swedish so

I didn't have any other frame of

reference

[Music]

if that's a great time

and so

um yeah and they've seen how fun went

over it which I guess is the Swedish

nationality

is that in Swedish

you use a suffix to Mark the definite

one

foreign

thank you

I would like to make like an English

equivalent of that

yes but it takes the word the reverse

the water and change the swing so you

get ease but make it s so it flows

better as suffix and then you do that

instead of saying the rabbit you say

rabbit death and there you go that's

[Music]

that would be the equivalent series

and of course it doesn't sound very

strange when there's no tasty but

but that's what our place Swedish does

I have already looked at uh languages

more in general

yeah

sounds like

what happened

[Music]

well yeah I assume it's the

second person signal

platform

[Music]

Janice runs

[Music]

which of course would be a better form

that's been out of use because the

second person fell out of his

[Music]

which of course makes sense

[Music]

um

and then English decides to

invent a new

a second

second person plural

I had no idea if that second or second

knows me

English is decided to drop second person

singing

yeah first person's yourself second

person is but the first person is you

and everyone who is with you second

person is

everyone you're speaking to and sad

person is everyone not involved in the

conversation

[Music]

and then there's ideas of a fourth

person but there's not a

an agreed upon the way of considering

what a fourth person is

[Music]

for example it could be that you're

speaking about a third person who was

speaking about another person then that

person becomes the first person I've

also read about the language

and it had what they considered a fourth

person pronoun

which is when you're speaking about

a third person which includes objects

they answer third person

I mean unless you're speaking to that

okay but normally normally you speak

about the object so they become the

third person

and

if you're sentenced then includes

third person doings an action and a

third person receiving an action

so

and the dog

the more song and let's say see the dog

sees the rabbit

third person is doing the action and

this side person is switching action

in this specific language and I'm gonna

have lost the track yeah okay and you

therefore have this third person pronoun

which can refer back to the dog

but the fourth person pronoun would

refer to the rabbit and that's a quite a

useful feature

[Music]

and something I still have questions

but as I also said there's no agreed

upon is not agreed upon what a fourth

person is though there are different

ways of seeing

so it's basically just the additional

way of referring to something because

yeah

but I think the definition is different

but not good yeah okay

there are different it is basically

a force type of a pronoun more than a

person

which is not covered by the indefinite

or the other

variance of indefinite

[Music]

because indefinitely sad person's thing

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

language like German

I can also use nice a similar system

because

I like English where you say dog and

rabbit

if you want to refer to back to them

usually would use them for around it

if I said verb then I might see that had

nothing to do with it

but in German dog is masculine and as

you really want to specify it as a

female dog

and rabbit is neuter

therefore

when you say the dog seems the rabbit

[Music]

whatever that is in German

and

yeah

speed and

that's

something like that Mickey

thanks thank you

[Music]

therefore you can use the

masculine key to refer to the dog

and the neuter it to refer to the rabbit

it will be grammatically incorrect to

use it to refer to the dog because the

dog is not an

it's it's

and me which

doesn't make sense in an English

sentence there we go

and that's just how the language works

laughs

the gendered pronoun doesn't look like

grammation

it's just that the grammatical gender in

our lines with it biological gender in

many cases

it's been a while associated

they're just different

classes of verbs verbs words

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

yeah let's see I think I made the hips

like too wide when I look back at this

after

done with the sourcing I felt like you

know I'd probably do white like me

hey again

like in Polish referring to water of

Water he is family pronouns so if you

want to say I see it you're referring to

what will disturbance when you say

yeah yeah

because

yeah

[Music]

because her doesn't mean it's a female

scene it just means that it has the

grammatical gender

of

acting

it's just that that's it

just grammatically Acts the same way as

the words for a woman mother and so on

it's important thing it is not a woman

[Music]

yes and that's important just because

someone is acting like a woman doesn't

make them a woman

is this particular should I make it more

defined

present because I really want the uh

[Music]

one interesting word

is

Magic

it's part of the female Jews regarding

reflection

is

[Music]

it might be the case of

it kind of being a feminine

feminine words that people are using

masculine

[Music]

words surrounding

[Music]

I don't know how far German goes with it

but the word for a girl in German

has become the diminutive of a previous

word

and all diminutives in German are

Newton

and not feminine

yeah so

they were for girl in Germany is

neutered as a very common example of why

the American General biology doesn't

like

and

so you when you're referring back to a

girl you should grammatically speak in

use the program it

however people might still choose to use

the word she because

the biological Association

and I don't know how far this goes if

people when they use adjectives

if they use the neuter version of the

family version

if Germans choose to use the feminine

version of addictive teams I can see a

similar thing there because

the word I isolated is I need to learn

but

[Music]

it is referred to as feminine

because of the biological

Association if that makes sense

a lot of people do say thus which team

did use new trackers

so bisoki

the town man

bisoka

would be

don't know incorrective people can't

accept it

let me get back to me

if you keep deleting it and adding it

back all the time

[Music]

look at my workflow here

[Music]

yeah

[Music]

we speak of languages

[Music]

and very

Broad

and public and another product

me

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

laughs

sometimes even humans just

say that it should be like this even

though it makes no sense

[Music]

[Music]

like how I like how some people argue

that the plural of cactus should be

cacti because that's how it generally

works in the language's origin okay but

why specifically that word why not

why not be clear enough everywhere like

that that's gonna be such a mess in

English

[Music]

I I need a random word

like the word restaurants that's a good

word it's got from French

restaurant

and the French word for plural is

[Music]

yeah so so you should not say

restaurants in English that's incorrect

they should be restaurant

yeah

restaurant

we don't

keep following this

at logic people trying to come with me

and

she won't be

like

what's the word for a man Italy is

actually probably at the birth of the

region Union

[Music]

at least Russian is easy to read and

polish

[Music]

message

it's just polish is better off like that

it has abused the Latin script

and it's not it's not allowed to use it

anymore

it is interesting to see ways people

come up with using this really script

for different languages

and then apologies for me to read the

Russian

what you used to

wait I hope I said that I can read

Russian instrument polish I think I said

that

[Music]

nope

[Music]

although I can't imply that only

spelling is bad but

yeah is it hot I'll see that

some spellings are just

it has the interesting pronunciation too

but the spelling is now

[Music]

you've got the personal pronoun then

all right

Maybe

maybe I didn't say I

or something like that

well I meant it there we go here it's

about

but she will always have clothing

covering him but I meant for me I speak

of my own experience

and though I'm not one to talk about

vomiting the person setting up all the

time yeah it happens

[Music]

I think that's important I think people

struggle with

um

and I think maybe we should say sorry

new things

if someone gives uh something that's

more of an opinion like easy and harder

the one it should be seen as the

person's own experience

[Music]

like yeah Russian is easier to learn

because it aligns more with my

that's an example

yeah doesn't mean that direction is

easier to learn for everyone just this

person in particular

[Music]

[Music]

there's an idea but I cannot say this

can hurt you inch probably if you use

substance in such a short time

ago experience when you say that

okay something is

something

and you specify it myself

I know someone says that's not true

only you don't know how

I find that easier well that's not true

um

though it's generally stated that

Russian is even a Polish

even almost like people but it's about

the most difficult level is

far as I've seen it does have kind of

bit of an odd

combination of consonants

so I could see that being uh is more

pronunciation Wise air polish a bit

tricky

certainly that should be a way to kind

of measure that thing objectively a

language with more

or should I say a language with less

different sounds

would be objectively easier to pronounce

than one with more sounds

easier doesn't mean better of course a

benefit of having more sounds is that

you can have

shorter words and more unambiguous yeah

communication

it's like my favorite words

it's 20 letters or so

which is

is

the name of a 16th and I think it's

[Music]

[Music]

well

foreign

thank you

something like that

kids little feet

or a cute little rabbit

imagine making the main shoulder or

something

I wasn't experimenting here

[Music]

maybe that is bad

[Music]

maybe that's more feet

[Music]

so

that's a long time for this watch me

so this is the pumpkin bunny

buddy

[Music]

so an entertain

this stain

detail of the detain

so you might have just

characters in

I'm trying to think like

jump started the daily creating process

by importing an existing tape

those

the SEC

might be curious if

other kitten another that's an idea

another collection

it makes me wonder if

no that's not this one

import

psk yeah it might be wonder if a

character like Bianca has a

[Music]

great time it's Bianca is of course I'm

gonna PC not playing I wish Bianca was a

player

uh

let's compare the size of Bianca too

okay

no more sportswear and fluffy Canyons

once but she didn't have a rabbit stain

it doesn't even looks like it

no

another lady

nope

I don't know if it's a stupid thing

anyway

there you go no more

Cape ish is that rope they call it the

cape it was a cape in original just had

a dress and a key look at this

I don't know she likes capes

but there's clearly no tail here

oh well

which other character has a tail

[Music]

turn to sink a hunter has a long tail

that's not the style I'm looking for

the palace have spherical things

um

[Music]

well who doesn't like capes well aside

from England

Moon from The Incredibles

no

Apes

she was not a fan of capes

[Music]

a rabbit monster

does that contain anything

probably left over from the ramen

monster that appears in the cutscene

that they made pre-rendered

sadly

well

looks like I have to invent that hit

no shortcuts here foreign

I see

I keep I keep missing your estins

I'm being silly

yeah let's let's switch to this one

she says there's a liability at least a

bunch of capes who caves left in their

minds guy got escapes nine on a rocket

and thin and blew up

and I got the Cape Cod in a running jet

engine

Etc

what are you here

you should totally made those stories up

it was because she doesn't spend escapes

to look

now

I guess it makes sense

I'm trying to be so nice how the tail

looks in 3D

because it's just all I have is this to

the truck

thank you

that's all I have

I'm currently I struggle I'm visualizing

it which is why I wanted that shorter

before I still want to remember that it

is a character inspired that's actually

hasn't

pale and the characters called ellora

now

and Laura

and Laura come here I want to import you

to have it

wasn't

Elora

there you go here's the tail

no expecting half for some reason

[Music]

select emerge

delete everything else

they have to have connected to the body

our turn

team

[Music]

so delete that

and it

overflow

versus let me show my split in half by

the way

[Music]

the real reason is they couldn't get

cash before problem CD radio animation

I know I was scared to subscribe

now that's totally how I would Rescue It

well they did try to do some

[Music]

some crazy stuff in that film

did you just cut off a Laura's tail in

order to listen to Fun Fun well

no

I don't know what you're talking about

[Music]

it's everything

[Music]

what are you talking about obviously not

how big is the tail

[Music]

I mean in that sad too I I still had any

plans of change it's entertained so

foreign

Frankenstein

by me that's kind of my morning

when I make I'll make the tail in

whatever size it becomes that I'm

defining

adjustments as needed

take care

thank you

again about a dfl

I'm going to do this shape

without this head just copying

and on the strength of

like that

[Music]

once it's stuck now the same with

clipping

and there's t7 merging

resistance like

this makes no sense what's going on

um

what's going on

oh I see I see let's see what's going on

the mirror editing thing was enabled

which will

this enabled mesh symmetry index axis

which is a weird name because it's it's

only for editing

and it will therefore when you do an

edit to

a Vertex or something called one side we

do it it would find the vertex in the

exact same position other side and apply

every same modification you do but the

opposite way around

which means that if you have a vertex in

the exact middle

it will therefore Target itself

and apply changes both ways so

it won't move away from The Middle

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

I have a lot of random stuff to say

find it against this is good

I mean

hydrate

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

hanging they have an odd number of

characters

how did you end up with that

must be one of those predictions you did

foreign

oh yeah no it's the uh it's the first

first redeems

[Music]

what do you want

I I've seen a redeemed to waste your

points on

I have a certain one you don't like yes

it's really in this one so you get rid

of a pocket

[Music]

get nothing at it

the first one yeah

it does that I do wish

more points giving up wasn't so

you get like okay

you get 10.75 minutes

and then get 50 points every 15 minutes

if you're active

and

then if you watch multiple streams in a

row you get like 300 for the

and points if you follow along on a raid

is like 250 points or something so all

the points you get is multiplied by a

factor of 10 of some sort unless you

have like the one

the tier one

multiply but guess you get 12 points

every 10 minutes then I'm from inside

[Music]

but it would be nice if they had more

the more stuff to give you how

um

[Music]

yeah he's the redeemed to cost my coin

for the soft personal balance

balancing your balance

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

how am I thinking of doing this

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

laptop

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

of course not because I have to apply in

the mirror

okay I'll delete it

[Music]

where it is

[Music]

at the same in the marriage

[Music]

thank you

okay smooth vertices

um

[Music]

[Music]

then

there's like two of them

it doesn't get me to scare me you'd

imagine to have them merge together

which will give this

back there

obviously I can and it is a big nice

[Music]

and then underneath everything there's a

very tiny one

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

thank you

now

oh

[Music]

I hope rocket man enjoys that's

access to the cute bunny image

that I guess that's basically what you

get from it

I'm totally unfortunate

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

oh it helps

I think

uh a thousand beats that's amazing

access to this special I think let's see

that

yeah

the funny one which is this one

[Music]

application expression of them

[Music]

yeah I don't have any

special

and sister happy when YouTube channel

I don't think I will change this

[Music]

they are good I say hi there it is

that's what I wanted to get

well you did give an additional 245

since you have shared that before

now

755 should have been enough

I love you

[Music]

[Music]

okay I do like the post that's funny I

mean when I watch things

[Music]

and then I see the facial expression is

just amazing

Mr blank stay

thirty two

that sounds very mathematical

[Music]

[Music]

there's a lot of them

yeah

they are doubling every time

[Music]

it does take time left to prefix

the one that has the shorter number left

is shy and gray

[Music]

and was there any other yeah here you

[Music]

[Music]

so with this one you can actually fit

[Music]

it's more

[Music]

Rocket Man yay

[Music]

[Music]

that can't really see exactly in which

months

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

how is it coming up yes

um

as

this I'm building a tail at the moment

I've done the whole body and I just

notes Here

I tried to make the upper body I think I

got this correct and I'm a hips stop

this night's Legends I think I think

this shape is good

so we know these notes are currently

adding retain now

hello navis

welcome welcome

to this

and also welcome back

as well you've been here before

fingers

and welcome back

how are you doing

um I didn't really

and

and you know

dancing

I did feel I don't know

[Music]

yeah I don't know how this job how I'm

doing but you know yeah

let's see really good

I'm not pregnant that's always not the

one you're replying to I get that but it

looks funny

okay no problem making anything good

[Music]

yeah

foreign

yes it should be

[Music]

all of these

so there's quite a lot of emails

but then it gets this for

one thousand Beats

five thousand beats everybody very rich

ones

okay

seven thousand ten thousand

[Music]

and of course and they how do you say

stacks

or not stacks

and so if you get the one from first

that's a bit you do get the one for a

month so we said the same thing

yeah that was hurt yeah and and

according to Twitch oh hello welcome

welcome

according to Twitch uh you it's you

really cheap that's not something

now it doesn't matter when you spend the

Beats as long as you have spent a total

of The Quiet amount

you'll get the emails

[Music]

technically you don't keep the email to

get these slots and that's an important

distinction

could change I will not try to avoid

shaking the notes

and if I were wanting to do that I would

try to contact those who have made that

much to see what they think

foreign

[Music]

I got access to the follower emails

basically adding five more slots

so there's actually quite a few words

from there

and if yes I don't know that's it

[Music]

but if I understood it correctly that

means that

you should have access to them so let's

see

and you can have fun with them

[Music]

happy

I will use them every message oh

oh my

he's the one eye did the one I like to

use in every Master just like this one

it's just a facial expression it's just

the

I guess that pen the expression of it

I just

[Music]

it wasn't what I wanted to go for I

wanted to like have a neutral expression

or something

laughs

[Music]

a bit

[Music]

thanks

yeah my rabbit what about it

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

at on the 27th

at

at

15 o'clock UTC so just apply your time

Stone difference there I also know the

European time zones in my head

which is 16 UK question

70 Central 18 is 17th Far East

but

outside of Europe

that um

those I don't know

I don't remember is like

Eastern United States Canada is like

minus fine

during summer

am I right

what is it minus four

but yeah

on 27th I win on the 27th oh so and some

spaghetti before

that it's kind of kids actually

[Music]

so it's only 27th I will switch I think

the singing one is uh subscription

remote but I will switch it out for

whatever I use for that thing

for the karaoke itself

yes because of course you need to see me

more for example

but then I would swap them back I don't

know which one thanks because I can't

remember which one of the following ones

because twitch doesn't really say it

when you are a subscriber and I am

technically a subscriber according to

Twitch

so it's on to my own channel

at tr3 subscribing

scene

because it would be kind of silly if you

had to pay for subscribe to your own

channel

twitch is a bad community

but almost

yeah I don't think

yeah I don't know this is good enough

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

all right

[Music]

[Music]

this is good because I love the

performance

it's because there is every Falcon goes

into a single point

I don't know what's yeah I think this

effect here

10 minutes

hopefully it's nothing that shows up to

me

more than anything means

flip over to the green thing science

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

and the Sun

[Music]

again

thank you

okay

perfect

results

Thursday and yet this tourism is it

executive bad thing if the rabbit does a

good thing

would a rabbit consider it a compliment

or a insult to say that the rabbit has a

big thing

at least

along this side of nowhere staying here

these edges should go

follow me

like that

oh yeah

when it seemed in and he looks big okay

yeah yeah he gets that depends on how

the favorite people okay

[Music]

smoking it can I live in the situation

it's just fun fun and then turn into a

rabbits and fun fun turning around which

is very indifferent about the

opportunity

like I guess I'm a rabbit though

um

[Music]

[Music]

okay first off I'll scale it down to

attempts the size

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

in another way

but I don't need this one anyway

now

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

laughs yeah I give another word I didn't

steal it from her

I used to scientific

function of cooking

biological copying let's see Laura made

me take damage when I tried my

notification oh wait are you already

playing

I thought you were going on Monday

or did you like try it wait how did that

Laura make you take damage that doesn't

make sense in the world isn't

[Music]

what

that was a favorite

it

I am confused

I need a replay of that

let's see one

all right I'm doing this

because you

no I don't think you ever

yesterday but she hit me so I had to try

again today

but what delivery doesn't hit you she's

not an enemy she doesn't cause damage

but who's talking

to confusing me

I guess I guess

bomb characters does put spiral in like

uh the same hurt animation as he does

when he gets damaged but it does not

cause damage

and which obviously you don't take that

much from such a thing you'll probably

should not get this damage

one of those examples is

inspired to let you plants

the seeds so like you're a flower

if that's not the spoiling no that that

[ __ ] right obvious and when you do

that instead too close the way it will

grow up so it is and grow happy plant is

growing up and it will cause knockback

on spiral like he has taking damage from

an enemy but you actually don't don't

lose else

so it's fine

yeah I really need to play on that

industry did you stream that or was were

you playing offline

it was online offline in the key sign

I don't think I've been able to

see your stream if you did streaming

[Music]

because I am confused

I'm trying to think of other situation

like

Ace on my page as I was only made it

about okay

okay

you know what

oh no

I've learned her because she wants me to

get the words entrance and oh

so she didn't actually cost me to

take them and she's possessed to you

[Music]

yeah I think I I don't know if I said

that but but what I enjoy about

by I probably have said that my one is

my favorite game and that the aspect of

that I mean I don't understand yeah but

one of the aspects is just that you all

all at levels six of people in the world

are optional

and you have nothing to do you need to

do a certain amounts

but none of the levels are

required

except for hormones of course

there are going to be an easy science

exceptions like that but starting from

spider 2 all levels except the Speedways

which they are called now are obligatory

and I don't like that

makes doesn't make the game lucky

if you're going for 100 Brown it doesn't

really matter but if you go for like a

challenge run it's it ruins

experience it

ah

time two

seconds into this morning

[Music]

and for uh and therefore a no damage run

Inspire one allows you to determine

which levels you really want to do

except not Street tops

oh

no no this one

Box by one and it actually did three

tops

while I'm doing that everyone said that

I I really don't want to do Tree Tops

and then at the end well I do have to do

one more level maybe I should do three

tips just

supposed

yesterday that was

when pumpkin leaves

[Music]

okay what happens if I liked

that's my vertex Smooths

[Music]

yeah that's

when I get I need to apply them in their

face

yeah that's not that bad idea

but

thank you

I don't know even mixing those two let's

make a difference

this is different from doing

one and two

better

Maybe

thank you

foreign

[Music]

because it should look nice

and as I guess

nothing that way

except Saigon because someone decided to

see she should not have Pleasanton

foreign

[Music]

right now

I mean

on their body

you have the outline there

[Music]

I guess I'll keep the tail as a separate

model unless I can modify the position

of it afterwards

without

[Music]

yeah the references here

I mean yeah

and then the question is is

she doesn't have a small number

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

you basically see this perspective so

maybe that's good

[Music]

it's foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

okay invite me ahead on that is the old

thing

is it like greens

this is

part of the food that I deleted

and if it's another

place

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

because I think

because I think the shape of the head is

gonna

[Music]

it's a bit more oval sideways than

mountains so I could probably squish the

hands again in a slightly to him a bit

more of a component

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

oh

[Music]

my God

[Music]

[Music]

now I added a theme

so

I guess no one hurts but this is a head

shape

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

so just about enough chairman this is

[Music]

and then

[Music]

same old as

previous as

that's off the hand off

[Music]

so I can apply a mirror to this

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

actually I should probably not

I spent falling in this part

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I'll cook a skin

let's see if this one that speaks what

I'm looking for the best

foreign

it's certainly an idea

[Music]

[Music]

so

[Music]

unless this is nice

I don't know

that's three pin printer sounds like an

expensive thing

I never heard that before I say princess

would only print out like make the mold

foreign

thank you

there's another step when looking at

this it was me simile

[Music]

thank you

isn't it

foreign

[Music]

model nothing fancy

but yeah I think it's about something

[Music]

enough

[Music]

so

now

you're a sleeping thing I like the one

thing

EQ

to be one of those

Japanese figurines when it puts

another 18 in very important

parts

[Music]

okay that was very weird way of saying

it but basically

those figures they even adds like to

have

a dress and then they also have

underwear and stuff

[Music]

hey let's see coming out with the bunny

around

it's a cute black bunny with rainbow

it's HD RGB gamer rabbit bunny

no if these parts

thank you

I thought sauce for amplished at first

well only as far as I know

Umbreon is space on a rabbit partly

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

thank you

so base wise I think I think we've been

fine to have it like that but maybe

maybe one has a flattering nose

I haven't really considered how I'm

probably looking 3D

they bow on the head I can import from

dancing just like I did put it Inspire

replacement

Okay so

these are the teams and they and the

creepy face let's let's hide the cheap

face

[Music]

ah do you make your face in your lane

that's true it's a

it's Bianca's face actually

and that's basically eat

[Music]

Beyond yeah that's me I guess

yes

I don't know how to say that names

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I'm gonna have a nice messages

it was just a bit like my feelings

[Music]

[Music]

this one seems that makes

to look less

I don't think that's stupid

[Music]

that's funny actually [ __ ] too

[Music]

twos

people

wish that might go up when she speaks

hopefully

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

ties but

[Music]

really depends on how she sent me

but fine because they might in their

animations they might actually know my

Clips to each other

[Music]

all that stuff I can tweak from thing

too

[Music]

so anything get rid of the ears

okay what is this

I mean until like the part of my team

but it is

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

closing this might be

cheeky

if I wanted to see if

you prefer perhaps someone can extract a

mother's room

and press team Rumble that would be nice

so maybe someone else I want to do that

if a question remember this is running

in Unreal Engine we don't need this is

PC ports and I can do that

cine could be used for the little stuff

oh yeah

yeah let's see what you mean got bit

back to work

all right

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

I think I don't think this will make

even though my ears around me

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

windshield pain

attacks I need some headphones in my

life

[Music]

[Music]

expect killing things

[Music]

like

that that's followed by that stuff like

that

but

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

first and perfect

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

and there's a

all right

[Music]

like people get tired in different ways

[Music]

yeah but I feel like when I it's not

like I'm more than anything

[Music]

because I'm actually excited for this

stuff

foreign

[Music]

unexpected

like that

it seems there's a lot of stockings in

my life

[Music]

I'm still here I just don't know what to

talk about yeah I know

you never see

that's one of the dishes

[Music]

[Music]

I said obviously but

[Music]

I guess my only chance here is 19.

what no that takes me

[Music]

foreign

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

13 person

eight years of practice and and then

it's like

solution

[Music]

solving

[Music]

because you basically need to figure out

what's to do to achieve something

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

that's facing enough stuff mixed

all right

[Music]

I guess so

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

this doesn't look good

that means

yes second attempt

this could be the part that actually

needs

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

oh it's probably good

but I need this one

not only do you think for you to make up

the pumpkin

that's why I probably took me a week

but I am

it's awesome

your he always said you had he has a

practice have you made other mods before

well I mean well

me before ignated

[Music]

okay in that case I mostly made random

speaking of this

I'm gonna try to do stiff stuff

[Music]

so nothing

modern related

but create dance studio model is

same practice

same process

[Music]

I've only done minor months every night

was very big

first game actually did

[Music]

large performance

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

basically

and I did like

[Music]

existing modeling some games

[Music]

making games and then I

[Music]

modifications to those but it's to

anything because I didn't know how to

[Music]

now

[Music]

highly score has like a circle this is

triangles

[Music]

so this question actually made up of

things

[Music]

Maybe

yeah if you look carefully you can see

that

is actually teaching us

but

[Music]

because polygons only works in dragons

maybe they have a square like this it's

still a triangle two dragons but

during having

the software itself see them as squash

and we work with squares and that's just

Institute

however I'm really tired about

responsible

and I did notice that someone is

actually

playing

Witcher 3.

let's see

minus a g

uh he's still playing so that's

this straight

[Music]

because he is she's just a Dutch

with a landing accent a cat can

isn't that nice

he liked mixture right

you can comment on the gameplay

it would be fun

[ __ ]

and then I will

oh I don't know I'm so tired I don't

know why of course request

and that's here on

me which uh
