Indian

um

[Music]

so

[Music]

it's really fun

oh

[Music]

am I preparedness

[Music]

I was gonna say where's all my gems all

right

when the bags got them

looking loudly is always something

like money bags holding on them

we'll see you around you get them back

or they might say some funny thing and

not kidding then I'm back

[Music]

you're definitely perfect is

okay let's see if I can do anything

foreign game

[Music]

because last time yesterday there was

it didn't display the level name

[Music]

after 11 because I can do it for the

menu but

let me just find a portal no except this

portal okay

wait

may I thought

or exactly I find I'm finding all the

importance that kind of doesn't I don't

have your head support them

I didn't want to go into it but yeah as

my as it showed it didn't show there

title of the lemon for some reason it

doesn't show up anymore

anyway I can work to a level

I don't know if if this that's an

intentional Design After at some point

this doesn't show you the level names

is it possible that it stopped doing

that since I got the ability to work

between levels that doesn't make any

sense

but I mean

not everything in this game makes sense

it's weird it's only in Spring

yeah it was working at first but now it

stops working

and I do want to complete this without

the same snakes because

you know I have the option

I have completely games so far without

using

and I have no intention starting

come on

no don't move

on and then these once again

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

yes that's like me

I know I could argue that

made me

due to it being harder

that the luck Elementary

maybe that's true

thank you

I think a good time I'm afraid

I'm trying to relax

yeah hey you relax

I'll get with this pain

[Music]

I promise it wants to do the same

and then I have to pick difficulty it's

just because just restart or whatever

let me start hard mode or something

yeah if these things

thank you

so much

oh yeah this is

I need to be quick and attack them

immediately because you quick the

quicker I am

and be quicker I can get rid of them

not me spinning coming in that

that specific person

I run into them instead

thank you

now

[Music]

it's really Legacy

sleeping is something what comes but oh

faster you get rid of them faster you

can imagine yep and therefore I have to

somehow react

see which position they have

I'm sweating

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

it's nice

and I just don't have enough time

oh come on

he's rid of the bus anyway

[Music]

s

[Music]

thank you

this is so much

oh

I don't have

next question is did the butter testing

Speedway I mean it's difficulties

exactly yeah that that's the feeling I

get from basically every game I'm

playing it feels like they have to test

the vacations

like

at least

begins that are

less equality I drink

expenses

like

grass of Cortex

but of course it needs a time traveler

but

let's not actually test it away I mean

let's test that these things right like

yeah you can pick up boxes and pick up

the clock you can pick up the clock and

you can reach the end and you get time

all that noise that that you have tested

but haven't actually tested doing

anything turns

oh

[Music]

okay

foreign

basically every spider game has said

that

the second Legend of spy is the hardest

one

and sure this game isn't hard it's just

specifically this this Speedway

and I've done the International Space

yeah

[Music]

so I guess I'm

this is like the second hardest finding

of the world so it is going to be easy

after this one

foreign

but it has so much health

I said

slime

hey so yeah there's some fun fun

complaining that 11 is too hard

[Music]

let me close

okay oh

hello man welcome

[Music]

oh no worries

I'm doing

playing at terrible spider game

in my opinion the worst spider game for

a couple of them but still but I'm 11

level

it is this game is something else

[Music]

[Music]

thanks

all right

I'm trying to extend

Ed

it's amazing

whatever I gotta speak

so much

no I ran into it like four times but it

lost

12 seconds but still has so much hands

My Life by trying again

oh I hope you made sense of it this kind

of weird sometimes monitors

who's your friend

I like and then I should I should do

like this but basically everyone here

everything is probably following you

anyway

it doesn't matter

this is one year because it counted me

or something yes I was watching or did

you actually

did so much

I did close down the stream

they are some instruments

you're right

oh come on

well at least I did this one is quick

enough this section I'm not so kick at

I think that's annoying

oh can we have a few things

shooting creatures

he's shooting really quick

right

now how come I always I was clipping

through the things secondly that you

count

I like game

[Music]

I got all gems

just

to get the last thing from this point

it's an ultimate Ferry

which I need to access the final

level where we get the final planning

and after getting that Ferry against to

the final final event

11x

and

and then something like that happens

uh

the problem is like you take damage and

then you you can no longer shoot it's

not like the invisibility is helping

because then when you stop being

invisible you become invincible because

that's the part before you can shoot

and then you get hurt again and then you

can shoot anymore so you can take damage

multiple times in a row without being

able to do something about it

and you can avoid being my enemies

they're spawning but

that's

give us quick cheating quicker and could

shoot while yeah like this

you can get stuck in not being able to

shoot

and that's my two piece

yeah you could shoot for me it's been

being small and cute also shoot quickly

certainly would make this easier

you know what I don't care

[Music]

that was the worst one area

not basically yeah why would he have

stunned luck in a single playing game

like this

I mean except yeah I mean it makes sense

in certain types of kids

[Music]

I mean I guess it makes sense

because

[Music]

now I wouldn't say it makes sense now

because in Crash you don't get stuck I

mean sure you get stunned a beat but

you're still Invincible while you're

still able to attack them

thank you

yeah it's doing this thing again

which it didn't do like

that many times before

so I guess I was lucky before

but in that point I could have had like

40 seconds but it means

[Music]

he complaining about the game

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

so far

come so far

okay that time it went very

so I am very close to you

but

yeah that's it I'm not really like that

certain way I can be

do not get heat

so it's not like too hard

it just it just just hard enough

yes

don't close to doing it

I don't want to know

okay

no one like this one

oh God come on stop doing these

take the down almost impossible to get

missed and they're taking so long time

it disappears we're going to do everyone

like this

is really trying to make a difficult for

me

and this is going to be an extra hard

drive

anyway

[Music]

no I really wish I could use

[Music]

is this a game for a game it doesn't

have anything other than a d-pad and

doing life like this with a deep back is

not

great

if you think stick Amy in first person

shooter is annoying try deep pad aiming

oh what are you doing

kid movements is that

oh my

God this is going to take as I said

three hours it's gonna take three hours

you can do it I can't produce things

yep it's no resolution

it's it has a limit of how many Sprites

it can have on screen

so

using

d-pad for Amy

there's probably something oh okay

okay there's probably something

okay all right I must say it

like

it has a boss at the end and then it has

this mini button okay because having a

bus alone wasn't enough

[Music]

so much time

come on

and that sounds annoying it shoots

so because it's not shooting so quickly

I mean it's good but it's not too

quickly and you can actually end up with

them moving between the shots and what

am I supposed to do should I don't

really take that into account when doing

this level

he's not asking too much

so that's my stage

it should be shooting quickly

across the camera between the shots

[Music]

that's probably because they are much in

there

right

like these Sprites these spice down it

doesn't look like quickly side wings

it's gonna slide me

excuse me

illusion of perspecting

20 seconds I have like 40 seconds

yeah

yeah

it must be like two words

right

oh try to avoid hitting here

how much for that

thank you so much

and it's doing that again

I was

doing this again and again

I mean sure I shouldn't okay

never shoot me

like come on

almost everyone will be in front

[Music]

yeah I got next one this is not enough

what's the villain's name he can have

the first time

but what does this say then this way

hasn't done anything wrong

and I don't need celery I need both

I need 100 fairies

regarded so enough

for once

every every Spy game is like

oh the villain

isn't even been a good villain

such an annoying meaning

United

wow

you just know yeah like it first moves

in front

and animals in the middle that's when I

can shoot it and then it moves in the

background which is like two pixels

inside something making it basically

impossible to [ __ ]

foreign

much more than one second but it's

slightly more than one second

[Music]

what's shooting that

[Music]

I'm gonna try to avoid it

randomly

this way made you go through this time

I'd say like this phone hasn't made that

if I was captured

that's what she did the series she was

captured she didn't choose to be

catching what are you doing

is it someone's been kidnapped

and your reaction is well it's your

fault we can't keep nothing

good afternoon did you get some sleep I

tried I got some sleep woke up with a

headache

probably because I had to do this lemon

okay

hello kittens

and pets I need some handpads

but in my dress back

foreign

[Music]

[Applause]

then this tune has left two seconds lost

and then they can come in front again

and once again

and

oh the terrible game hello that's why I

can't believe in you don't believe in me

I'm at the level of giving up if I can't

completely slamming in this team I'll

consider this game

it's been here

next week it's seasonal fire regardless

of those because I can't

I can't deal with this anymore

it does mean that when I eventually get

the slam done I'll complete this game

like adhesive take once you know

I won't do these ceremony house

okay there is our option

at

if I can't complete level 18 hours

she did

but I want to consider myself

but at least I can like

I don't know

I don't want to see it

I don't even know if I have any cheats

available

[Music]

to be able to do this now minutes

I'm not really sure why it's

constantly Chef's the champion

sometimes Maybe

I made you all right

show the time and it must show me Jam

counts as well

not even a 40 seconds I can do that

the next perception you know means

[Music]

this is that I don't think you had to

kill him

yeah

I'm not the person who wants to give up

or come on always it just shows up there

and I brought it up in a car today but

I'm supposed to teach I'm going to

confidence

left

oh my

God come on stop moving in front stop

money I said stop moving your

surrounding don't do it easily

and again

I basically need to run but they don't

move in front

and then move

they move so slowly

and I'm clipping through the Rings and

not getting anything

why is this level so 10 um

yes

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

how are you thinking about this

even with

thanks

come on

yeah can I keep doing that sentence

for a few minutes

he's good pattern

this is fun yeah it's just been nice

thanks

man

I need this game

is going to be bad

fix all these issues

like mannequin around

[Music]

[Music]

Japanese fashion season rice or

something I think this one is

and I think it hits another species

which is introduce which they brought to

see snap playing

yeah sometimes I can see

okay okay so I was inside that guy I'll

give you that okay

that's so much hell how am I supposed to

get rid of it

oh

like

I think I'm quite doing that quite well

what am I supposed to do

so

this one out

let me look at how another stream a

little bit

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

S I will add

browsing

doesn't matter what it's called

browser source

and then we go to

that let me

twitch twitch

the usage extremely

magenta sheep

thank you

nice

foreign

now

we go and find

I should

I'll do a shout out in foreign

this Speedway

ah this is this is something that is not

fat I I thought it was going to be the

end of season of ice

how do I go back

where's the back

why isn't that back

the twitch integrated browser doesn't

have a back button wow

nice design obvious twitching again I'm

going to say OBS integrated web browser

doesn't have a back button

oh beautiful if you remember this level

also because I wanted you to give curves

yeah yeah but sure sure I do get that

hey

heaven

because the game requires you to do it

I know she has done it

okay

um more searching for that let's see if

it's nice

maybe I can't find it

in these levels before anyway

this is a flight

that's basically night because it's

weird

how weird is it doesn't show up

because this is this right

yeah because it's

because it should be this space

apparently I noticed that if you hide

the uh

view you can't interact with content

which is really perhaps because

and this is this flight

it depends the flight I'm actually

sitting boring why is there no back

button because that is probably the

biggest annoying that for me at the

moment I guess did not go back and she's

next and I go from multiple times or

something

and certainly this is the very first one

certainly it shouldn't have been here

because it's too early in the game

yes so this is the first place

it's the last one

can you send me

did you give up quick game or something

easy

no she's actually

how many responsibility

yeah it came up in the game or something

she because

it's an expected by practice

I don't know I don't know what's going

on here

I just can't find 11.

with me

how do I

sign as the game for myself

ah there yeah that's how I can't read

and the web brows say

is not making noise

I need to check that

oh and then it needs differentiate

oh my OBS integrated web browser or web

browsing created in the BS the worst

voice function ever

oh no we need to reset the whole thing

but she want audio I don't even know if

it already Works I'd still show up here

okay let's see if this works

and see what she says like

like if you're gonna give me a level

like this where it forces you to

memorize everything so you do it

perfectly and have just the amount of

time to get the boss

then put the enemies in the same place I

can [ __ ] have them do random [ __ ]

like that and come in and hit me when I

don't expect them to because it was

different but last time I did it

it's just it's bad

this [ __ ] is not fun

it's the least fun Spyro game I've ever

played

yeah almost made it to where I was

before the end of the last stream two

more fairies I still need to get and

we'll be where I was before it just

deleted half of my progress

okay

it didn't I didn't have to restart the

whole game at least so that's even worse

oh okay so this is the this is the last

stream of the season of ice and I guess

she gave up on a game I must ask ask him

lucky

City yeah

I don't even know what she's using

[Music]

but yeah that's that's all I can stomach

for today I've got more fun things to do

like errands

more fun stuff to do like errands okay

yeah so um yeah that was the same street

and there was no more stream after that

because the next one was

doing three and this is stream one of

seasonal flame and at the very start

and it starts immediately with

yeah this isn't seasonalized

so

yeah

anyway

yeah see if I see I can't say if it

started I will ask her no that's not the

man

uh but it's a possible that she gave up

on the game as far as I can see operated

highlight if it is possible that one of

the highlights is missing

but um

that's why I have to ask him and so and

yeah

so anyway if

I guess again if you want to watch your

content

and she's going to

Legend of spider 2 at the moment

because she does the games in release

order unlucky me

yeah

looking great thank you again

so I guess I didn't get any answer on

how to do this then

fun

oh funny

so yeah let's see that's all I could do

it

pay in shout outs for it Teaching

Company

the name and everything was on screen

too so

anyone invite watching back on devot an

issue

finding the channel

but yeah

she's actually going to have a birthday

celebration today

because it's your birthday

it would be fun to read but she's still

quite frankly name

I don't remember when she said

it's going to be you know it's just

I want to see how long these were taken

yeah look at that time eh I got no time

at all

thank you for this video

well I'm happy you could

just

explain my complaining of this game you

can't cheat but when I can't do it

come to eat

where's the chairman

come to me

oh I've been trying so many times I'm

trying for so long and I just can't do

it

must be a gaming cards to do this

I'm not one of them

I'm Just a Bad Thing Man

okay I'm not fat again

I have some skins but

I mean what's that

expensive new thing

now I'm being distracted by addition

ah wow it's a cabbage I see

[Music]

it's called cabbage

is what's the difference yeah I think I

had a hamburger today which I had a

lettuce what's the difference between

cabbage and lettuce

cabbage was called cool in Swedish

she's asking the word for cone

cone or something else I know like it's

nice

the black stuff is that stuff

thank you

uh

my friend again

see

basically can never get a good chance of

getting this when I'm moving in front

come on one two three four five six

seven eight nine ten eleven twelve

thirteen fourteen forty minutes that's

an interesting number

things

look at the time

[Music]

20 seconds to beat the boss

right

maybe we can't put anything from that

[Music]

okay 27 seconds

Charlie or something

probably not you know

I got so much hands how am I supposed to

do these

yeah

you can meet

from cabbage but not from like this I

guess there's a difference then the only

time I can tolerate cameras is in my

environment

too

wow how much calories in that plus

he has in that box is too damn High I

think the name was

yeah and these have too much time we're

giving you one second

come on how much help do they say

and then I'm finally killing them one

second

that's all in here at least the big one

gives you three seconds but the big one

seems like less than smaller one

perfectly

ah now it's moved in front how am I

supposed to I need to move and shoot

them so quickly

and then I had to reactive there in

front or not

and sometimes I don't even have time to

react because they do mean so quickly

this is the worst

first

first level of the whole game

and also other Speedways except for the

stars but anyways

I miss them

it's almost like they wanted these to be

like a second apart

but they didn't actually make them a

second apart they are slightly more

you're actually losing time you want the

ring section to be so you don't gain any

time

darling

they couldn't measure it

like

because fresh developers you can't

really measure anything too so it's the

time

I guess it's hard I mean I still have my

lips

this throughout the solutions but

to get things timed

yeah I guess I'm not developed through

here

next week

but they take forever to make and I'll

miss the Stream make it before this game

wake up

I mean it's not like I'm giving up on

the game so

I totally completed the CC racing

what happened

[Music]

that is the worst path and it just loves

using the same path and over and over

again

the worst pattern of them all

is a kid's perfect

this phone always used to keep cracking

there's a less good part and when

they're cute enough catching

our head run but not the same one moving

from

and I managed to get to the bus with

like 40 seconds

to get rid of the bus

I need like a minute or something

because

he got so much hands

[Music]

or something so let's quit season of ice

age

between

[Music]

sounds like I got two plus ones but I

think two diamonds

did I meant to shoot it like on the same

frame because I took damage or something

[Applause]

thank you

no sound

we got two orbs left did he cut two

balls left

uh I never reached

this game is breaking me

this is definitely worse than that

hamster ball Time Traveler's course yeah

at least that one was possible to do it

I was close but two times

I could see me being able to do that

that's why but this one I don't feel I

can benefit too at all

can you know what

bass that's not space Space

Age Speedy wave I just typed that in

and

next piece each Speedway and age

should I put this on screen let's do

this let's let's

just relax there

seriously how many times did it take you

to do it this is insane so this is the

same price

wait

no answers

and also

why can't you scroll

what okay why is why is it twitching

here the web browser is so so bad

it's the worst you can't even scroll

or is this the fourth place you've got I

could score on Twitch so why can't I

scroll here

tonight

having you know four pluses no responses

yep

that's it

I just can't scrolled

I can I can click on things but I can't

scroll

password indica

the heads ETS

all right next

now

what are you doing what are you doing

really

wait how do I

I minimize the comments how do I expand

the comments

right clips

this button knows if I enter you can

render slide again the fact that goes

beyond 100.

I think interesting

here's that option

if I if I glitch myself into this legs

ah give this back you know what is

yeah this is ccy

I click the wrong button I must Cliff

this twin

well I don't consent

hey spacious Speedway is one of the most

frustrating split face in the game and

possibly the entire series

how much how much of how well you do is

going to be based on luck and how good

you are at attacking the dragon and then

things are normal it's hard enough but

I'll put Sarah

yep

yep

I don't know if I can do this

this might just be one of the games I

have to give up on

if you are using emulator what if you

can see the Slowdown domination speed

uh

[Music]

there is no left

I don't know everything is just that

doesn't

foreign

thank you

the art sheets codes for the game

thank you

I have a piece of pretty common in

Sweden actually yeah yeah

I like pineapple and pizza

wait how do I know

my voice why is Google broken broken

is broken that's

oh

I really can't do this now and I really

don't know what to do

thank you

and I had peanut butter pizza maybe you

should try it maybe you should try the

one I prefer pineapple ham

and

shrimp I can tell you it's 100 pigs with

my pizza except sardines

first piece of the bench I haven't tried

any service

again lots of limes like this there's 99

lives

instrumentals in Sparks infinite lives

infinite weapons and spikes spy

walkability but I want all the fairies

there's no fairies

yeah I have to do this

I have to do this level that comes to me

I just have to give up on this game

shameful sounds good yeah I just have to

give up on this game

it's been over an hour I mean I haven't

played every every minute everything

I've been contemplating about my

suffering I needed to this level

good

Ness

a joy

the inside of the gym

it's in slow motion

if you think that's my neighbor

but in that case I'm not beating the

game

Fair anyway in that case I could just

use

front yard

in that case I can just do this

see and let me see how this works

yeah there you go

but I can't do this Vine I

maybe I can set it to the controller

can I

why do I set control arms

and things

okay yes there is

right now guys

foreign

[Music]

get that one

why can't I get that there again

no

I'm basically have to figure out which

stretch this plastic

how hard it get

[Music]

it oh come on

come on

thank you

I'm doing it

even eight nine ten eleven ten thirteen

fourteen

okay

yeah this is the worst

the handsome set of planes I could have

gotten they are so spread out

[Music]

[Music]

but even though even though with all the

cheating

I only got Sports well enough for two

seconds

36.

very sweet no not not even doing that

that can be

hang on

even even doing that it's like important

anyway

it's game is insane yeah

so

screens

I don't know

I I can't do this

I can't do this

if I give it one more try

one Crocker I think

and if this doesn't work

because you obviously won't work

the best end of this game

I press the wrong button anyway

but then I

because I think this month for like a

minute I forgot which one was first

because

yeah anyway

looking nice

[Music]

okay

[Music]

let's avoid that

yeah that's that wasn't worse

again

also noticed that no it's just me being

bad jacket

and amazing

why does it have so much

what part of it should I be shooting

please

now

come on come on

this

is

please

oh my

God

yeah I mean yeah this game's insane

this is this is ridiculous

this is just

foreign
