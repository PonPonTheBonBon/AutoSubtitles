oh that's the
one why
doesn't why doesn't cc racing exist it
is a game trust
me oh
no did
[Music]
they did they remove it did they merch
it
de the side of the
mar wasting uh the North American
version but that it's a completely
different
game
so I can't but yeah I mean what I could
set it to that
one well I guess I have to report that
it is not the same I mean it
has it has similarities it has
differences I need
to I actually have to load the game is
the only game I can remember you're not
completing I mean I didn't complete why
how couldn't you remember it's the
season of ice i al also not completed
the the crash
bash
I did complete
China there the UK in USA wait I thought
I completed the one track in
us maybe I did
it is it showing me up
fine because you already completed I
mean I complet it
now I mean this okay okay fine enough
then okay let's go let's
go such a long time I playing this this
was one of the first games I played on
stream let's see if my gaming skills has
improved since
then
yeah there's like
now I prefer I prefer being in the car
when I'm
driving I don't like to like the third
person have racing
h d more Andy why is everyone fasting on
me
whoa oh yeah Crush bash do not remind me
ofu because it's already too late
oh you playing a Caring Game I am I mean
a completely SP game
and there any other Spy game I should
play I mean Shadow Legacy is what I want
to play but I can't get it to run
properly I will run it in the future and
also
um game
away yeah like you probably have to
adjust everything
here
[Music]
to get the car to behave as
expected it is
a the difficulty of this game just I
really S I completed the first first
race
here maybe no May no I completed the
first race of UK that's the one I
completed maybe I never completed the
first of this
okay it's more difficult this game work
racing crash P at least do
[Music]
second
go I'm climbing the rank slowly
here slowly second position
already not not driving this as I were
driving well I did maybe I got a lot of
practice from driving Need for
Speed I did after this Need for Speed is
a bit more simulating than this and
since it has the damage
system uh I'm not I can't drive that
game as crazy as I'm doing
this wh
slippery I guess the problem is that I
can't read comments while I'm driving
but I guess I can do
like the problem right P me on this
stretch of road it's too far to the
go I I guess I can like read comments at
Finish Line probably do have to fill
around with options I just have no idea
what most of that means and also even if
you know what it means what does each
value of this thing
mean like it has reached it like maximum
speed here I kind of need
it like I need the
uh the uh I really wish I could change
the settings up time because yeah it
can't go over 20 160 that's like the
most this car can do but as soon as it
come to these sections having this uh
personing closed gearing it should
probably
uh I think they call it widening it just
slightly but it's really useful for this
section it's really useful for this
section
come on get out of the way I'm trying to
drive
here okay let me uh yeah close Garing
normal Garing far Garing that's what I
call
it
um maybe maybe let's make try normal
spammy hi Aon Pon and everyone hello
spamy today I decided to finally conf
fin finish SP season of
ice has bested me for it has been
a the one in my side for too long I
mean I I consider half a victory I
cannot I cannot consider fully proper
Victory I still had to go through every
every part of the final level it's only
that I used save
states but I still have to do every step
of the process is just that I I took my
it's kind of like taking your best
performance of each segment and putting
that together to a complete
run so so every performance was by me
but it wasn't like how you actually play
a game if that makes
sense
so why do you make it
what
sorry you have to wait for
me they they did make the SP reignited
Trilogy
[Music]
finish there you go that's your
joke J BB games welcome J thank you for
showing up in the middle of the race
thank you for following
now eight now
eight it's doing some unfinished
business
here as the title says I
hope category set to nothing at the
moment
because they decided to remove this game
fromb they actually decided to merge
this game with another game which is not
exactly the same game so anyway let me
just read your comment up your engin
so cust yeah message cu the ches shifing
GE into your retro race F the factor
size read
is is is that because I know you have an
AI is
that is that something was the
AI why right now anyway
it yeah it kind of feels like a bit
AI somewhere in
it welcome everyone who do have a Ms MFS
CD no I missed
on I I shouldn't read and drive at the
same
time your Shiva your
Shiva
well
maybe okay I can't read and drive same
well maybe someday you can attempt play
H Speed without Save St
i h yeah and of course J bird but
St keep them Sho
up I don't even have
shoes no yeah I was doing termly I got
distra by the ra which is perfectly
fine look at this I don't have shoes I
am Barefoot bare P compare
P go fast B hello Benny you like racing
games
Benny yeah I tried after completing the
that Speedway with with the safe State I
could complete the uh boss for why they
have decided to have a boss battle in a
Speedway is a good question but I
completed the boss battle in h 50
seconds and I entered it boss battle in
54 seconds
so
w I was doing so good I I I think I can
win this bones don't need ships exactly
but I'm going to PO this
she not of course you
want want to play with the
toes feel the fluffy feet feel the
fluffy on side where there are no P
plants to distract you from the
fluffiness insert that to try to cut
over here a
bit this this
is kind of an attempt to do like a
simulation racing game on the
PlayStation one which is not very
accurate kind of between arcade and
yeah got stuck
but in the ditch I'll be l king yeah you
you came in lurking at the start of the
stream too it's getting quite late here
P I'm going to move move hope you have a
lot of fun
racing reading message after the order
thank you for thank you for writing
thank you for oh
yeah yeah complet forgot about your
uh your gaming there on in your ask came
what I really get the because the r are
so spontaneous get the questions in
order like how it went with your
stream okay I think I think it will be
possible for me to do this I'm not sure
why I had such a trouble with this game
actually I mean sure it was when I
started streaming but it wasn't like I
was new to
gaming I in first place I'm not
struggling at all with this level as I
say as I'm getting bounced
around I I've decided to try to read the
comments at the uh stopping
line um Bri
LA and and I that that way I decided to
try to catch up the
com F right then
so take take me like up 10 minutes
before I
respond hope you don't
mind starting line somewhere
here there we
go
[Music]
okay I drink coffee without sugar well
done you did that great I might stream
tomorrow before the game awards oh yeah
the game awards which I've never
watched I I was still considering if if
I should stream something like that but
I don't know probably not it probably
should be more planned in
advance but yeah maybe I should see if I
can uh now I am wondering if P had KN
sucks uh there is some in some people
interested in ppon with socks and I
don't mind that idea some of the
suggested outfits for pon pon do do
include knee socks knee high
socks and uh so yeah
I I since since the outfits are going to
be made in
3D I'm going to model everything and
texture stuff
so I'm not going to do
uh uh
shoes because that saves me some
modeling work and the shoes is shoes are
probably going to be outside the vi most
of the time
anyway that
time than
go now this game is very easy
have you switch controller
too
yeah the ru the rule isn't because I
don't want Pont shoes it's just because
I don't want to model shoes I already
just put a texture on top of the legs
and feet so much
easier sa me some
time okay H my ideas were horrible for
pon pon
oh what what ideas wait what are
this new lap
record uh I think yeah I think you gave
me some okay so
uh some
ideas horrible I don't
know right now can't remember what ideas
were tell off stream
sure
I canot see
it I'm up for
like
many different outfit
ideas but the outfits have to
like
no yeah
bit
reasonable the only goal I have here is
to win the race come on oh yes the the
computer lost and
the I don't know how to say it but
need to slide to the side lost all speed
so I'm going to win this
now who I mean this was super easy I
don't know why I struggled so much
before
not I too have horri ideas for fun fun
yeah I have got some
uh interesting
ideas
save I'm definitely going to save after
every
race the horribleness is just the ideas
might be a bit too
skimpy try two new car available
finally I just
one yeah I have to
strange that the games yeah even though
they merg the games on IG
DB the
other yeah I'm going to use defa setting
seem to work fine the the game the game
should still show up for me because I
have uh because the uh because they've
set the CC racing European
title which really shouldn't be much
intering one game but hello is Fox cat
Fox P puning to say good night in your
rest of your stream thank you for poing
and have a have a good sleep have a good
night still no SWS
oh that's a can't remember where I
was thank you for stopping by really
appreciate
it
so now we dve through this little town
here let's see
how okay good so
far go go go
go the yeah
improper CU I'm running the game at high
resolution you can can I see the gaps
between the poons but for some reason in
the ceiling of the tunnel but not
anywhere else and in
this and on some of the
mountains but not on the road for some
reason maybe it's because of the
angle he's not too distracting I hope
it's a bit weird but
still feels like I did complete the
first of the two and I was striving with
this one let's forget to save or
something Sun place isn't
M or the first
lap
okay that was
bad and the game M Shing in
heeter 300
me
see if I can get catch
up it would be
nice yeah I'm catching it 100
me come on flip over flip over
no now I'm falling
behind to get used to track
itself still can't talk though my voice
is just
gone just rest a bit
more
come on come
on right into the water okay that was
just a warm up fast P go fast I think
staying on the track is high
priority what your car's upside down
yeah it fell
upside it fell upside down and then
right into the
water
what someone's driving on the side of
the
cliff if you fall into water is game
over that also applies to the computers
which I do appreciate like it's the game
is fair if a computer falls into water
it's out of the RS so technically
because it's there's only five computer
players you could spend your time trying
to knock every computer into the
water uh and then if you knock all five
of them into the water you can use
finish all three laps without worrying
about
any it's an option only works if there's
actually
working
obiously someone
crashed
goodbye car no I lost
SC come
on I wanted to get rid of
you CU I want to win this well I lost a
gift there maybe
well hello
car
who H also I forgot
to yes I should read the comments too
hey here in Sweden they drive cars
upside down I thought well they are
upside down compared to Benny at least
no what did you why did you Ste my
spw did you see pon pon I got the world
record best laugh in your favorite G not
challenge well I did play the PC
version I I I like the carrier mode is
this is the carrier mode the same on the
play one as PC with I don't know I look
much into it use the pit maneuver yeah
nice a SP back oh doing upside down
that's near is the S Swedish word now we
can type
it just up and down is the
word that's as one word
Ultra Punk p no what's the what's the
ultra Punk
for what have I done that deserves the
an ultra
[Music]
Bonk you're hurting Little Pon
P an ultra Bonk would have been
animal who don't slide down it's a bit
slippery
here
come on car you oh no and down in
watch
oh oh that was a terrible just straight
into the yeah definitely not too
simulating if only that happened in real
life when you accidentally was driving
into a wall of or a cliff side or
something you car bounces off the wall
and
back those are some crazy G
forces amphibious car if only sadly
isn't car is sadly gone oh
crash now I just need 200 me catch
it okay
he
catch up to the next to the leading car
and then I bump the W
and ah okay it's a start Place let's
let's start
over yeah the cars kind of have physics
yeah the physics in this game is a bit
wonky
[Music]
I guess it's part of the
fun buy py py
cars did we go speeding past that
car
maybe exploit because when you go into
the water you drive
slow in that Chanel
[Music]
water and then idea is to exploit the
physics so you somehow with high speed
bouns fly over the water so you don't
get slow
down 200
can I catch up
100 I do wish it was a bit more
active I mean I do appreciate it's ging
100 m or hectometers as I qu
it one hect two
hect we can add one more this
one really driving on the edge of the RO
there and the engine sounds just
disappear I do wait wait a minute I do
have even more games I haven't finished
yet like mot racer World Tour motor
Racer
3 and
I mean and
obviously the other games that I don't
have Hardware to play which but I I
assume those don't
count and Al also check yeah I'm taking
B and
hydrates I get to the
hydrate hydrating mid of
Drive
um that would be I am fish and a spider
Shadow Legacy spider enter
dragonfly how does he enter a dragon
flag
um what more is
there
gam have tried started playing but had
to abandon due to Hardware
limitations do we have any
games the hair
PL
who Miss going to cut over here and
while it's slow let me take my
dehydrate and also clear off this list
of
ring and
go I know that have done
stuff with the
uh when I switch yeah problem is that
the outfit shows up in the list
que I do still want them show up so I
can refund them
but I could
just redeem and them myself as the
refund to be
honest I should do
that
okay I still have to win the second
place is the same as a sixth place
second place is the same as last
place win counts as progressing just
like in mot
racing
[Music]
one I'm not catching up to
l
switch back to the a
car but you know retry retry until I get
a random event that gets theing card to
crash now now car is driving away from
[Music]
me
well that was in the wi H restart and
then now wait I was supposed
to which car let me try the other the
other car and see if it goes
by TKD
Conor
welcome no not that way this
way welcome
welcome wait when did I say I have to I
have to PE car after I Pi the race I
don't need to go to change why is change
car an
option TK or Conor Conor is fine
Conor yeah yes
okay do you like racing
games do you know about C3 racing on
Playstation
One this car seems to be better for this
track
thing stick to this car for
now
yay
S I asked two
questions no initial need
though about
that but I have no experience with
it I know it's like a TV show I
think it was a video
game maybe based on video game maybe
video game was based on
it or maybe it's just all a big me and
I'm just being
bamboo careful about this around these
Corners not played the end racing games
in a long
time me neither
actually don't know when I played the
racing game last
who he come on drive drive drive
not to I
mean the physics in this game is a bit
weird
but play for
fun
[Music]
okay just have
to this part I do get through quicker
than computers here's where I can catch
up if I don't make
mistakes
go
yeah here com very
soon I when I get a straight part of
the okay let's I think last what I play
properly was I say Mario Kart lash on
GameCube or Need For Speed Most smart on
Play 2 oh Double Dash is the best Mario
Kart game there I like to play two
franchises of
games H so the I guess there's an idea
to play through uh Mario Kart the Mario
Kart
games I should probably not 100% them
because that requires a lot of
effort
oh I almost crashed
out but for some reason I'm not that far
behind
Ste yeah I think I can do this I just
need slightly better be slightly
better yeah one of why is the plane
still flying when wait yeah I think I
was going to say when it's paused it's
not
paed one of my first racing games I
played was Formula 1 95 on PC ancient
that's also a franchise I'm not sure if
you can call it a
franchise have the Formula 1 games every
game by every every
publishing normally I would assume there
only one
formula yeah I can't do that formula one
game per year because it is a
brand just brand like it's a
trademark I mean it's a actually race
I'm not sure brand is the correct term
here guess maybe it
is so the developers need the license
and they usually only have one one
publish holding the license and and
similarly I would be interested in
playing through like
every
FIFA game for
example I do I do like to like what
would be considered completing a FIFA
game would I be play through like a
whole season or
something and then playing through every
game and see how the games evolve oh the
dress is
back someone is driving on the cliff one
yeah I just wish the leader could do
that
too computers do make
mistakes so so l oh I'm so close so
close to Le just have to not make
mistakes now yeah the leader did a
mistake a slight
mistake mistake nonetheless who I'm
making a mistake now now I recovered
[Music]
okay problem is that the computer is
better than me on this part of the
track better me I mean like better than
M hey wait why did you steal my
dress oh
rude to tackle
me sh Ste
my yeah yeah always they stealing my
dress now you should redeem a different
outfit so instead of the dress comeb
back is a different outfit
comat but I guess you can call call that
my my because you have like the GRE
girls wearing the don't know if that's
correct term wearing like the crop top
and short shorts I guess you could call
it the G girl outfit for
the for for the racing
game
go well don't make mistakes
now not catching
up
and so close I'm so close to doing
this full concentration now oh yeah
computer made a mistakes let me read the
comments
now anyway time to to go to work hope
you have fun with your bye bye hope you
still heard that sleep on how how are
you supposed to sleep with his his arm
if he's going away you following his
team to work because it's funny and you
look good without it I me I guess you're
right P do look good without the
P I follow you follow to work maybe you
should do the
work maybe we should help uh or speak at
work where's the
computer I'm driving off the road but
still going quick how does that work the
computer is
200 me behind no's catching
up is definitely catching up now I
wonder if there's any it definitely
feels like there's rubber band in this
game so in games when you have a form of
boost system that you have to charge up
or something and then you can activate
at any point if the game like a racing
game has rubber banding there is no
point unless you have to do a certain
maneuver there's no point of using your
Boost if you're in the
lead because all all that happens that
all the computers are just going to use
rubber banding
to make your
Boost
like what what would you
say like like if you never used the
Boost in the first place
which is would be for example need to
speed on the ground
to where you can use H where you have
the
Boost which you have to charge
up you can use it to catch C get up to
the first place but after that there's
no point of using
it if if the computer is catching up to
you you can use it to get more ahead of
the computer but if you're already
the and also when you get closer to the
end of the race you can use
it otherwi it's it's only going to be
rubber banded
away no cuts too much but I'm going to
win now because I'm like
a so far ahead
winner please win pon pon 2 for the
bunnies P Pon One the race
whoa the yeah Canyon
bunnies wa do not actually
save I need to save out every
face saving
complete would that be howy phras in
English three new car
available is this the
that's there's a lot of
car I still don't
have okay I will stick to this car for
now because it seems to do the
best I'm actually happy to to finally
make progress here oh you adding to the
swimsuit
P Bun's racing layer I guess I guess you
could say it's a bit of racing style to
it with the with this rainbow stripes on
it oh as started okay you know what uh
ads
uh
uh
guess h i wait wait
P hello Cipher
T cyer I guess I call you Cipher I just
like to say read like all all names let
me just look over
this if
I make this
closer or lower I
guess and then I set this so close May
that's more more like it's all good yes
I it's fine
yeah oh someone someone really redem
the how long how long is
this
H this is this is 1
hour I will I will change it so the
outfit redeems will be 5 minutes instead
of 15 when uh I have more outfits to
pick from for this 3D Pon pom I'm so
excited for 3D Pon
pom have so many
outfits I wish I could look at the list
maybe I can do
it it's nothing like it's not not much
to look at because it's just a list of
uh list of
text I guess it's a list of text with
like links to reference
pictures
so it's not
um gaming
vet a gaming veteran not a gaming
veterinarian let me a che here this list
[Music]
contains
one 112
outfits I cannot have I I cannot have a
redeem per outfit because that that
wouldn't be you can only have 50 redeems
so that's why I I want like a drop down
redeem
selector but it's going to be text input
because that's all I can do at moment so
write the name of the
outfit there's going to be a bunch of
aliases so you don't have to I'm going
to use this thing that's called Rix so
you can
use which will
yeah I don't think if you know what it
is you
know basically if you make typers or
something it's still going accept it
anyway back to the
game now let's go start a thir race no
one should have missed anything
now aside from I guess conversation
about P Pon
outfits okay don't know if that gives me
better
VIs
um I think I stuck with this lighting
light because when I use the light that
is further
away it uh it does light further away
but nothing
close I think that's to simulate the
high
beams oh that actually
worked but that's not how high beams
works this looks more like high beams
and I don't exactly know the terms for
the all the lights on on
cars but I know that my car has three
light
modes high beam low beams and the LED
lights I don't know if the beam are hi
are LEDs
I I
think I think there the maybe AR I
haven't
checked and Jellyfish launcher
mode yeah there's some
jellyfish there like you have the blue
jellyfish jellyfish the green jellyfish
fish the Blue Jellyfish that goes
straight the green jellyfish that goes
up one like the Tentacles goes
down and then there's like the speaker
mode maybe I should look into that if
they there are
ledies
tacle WAP outfit that's an interesting
idea I mean I already considered having
[Music]
whoa I still need get used to this
track he I
was considering
having ribbons tied around Pon body as
an
outfit with a nice big bow so she's like
wrapped up as a present
like that would like that to see that
[Music]
one what you do be nice
present it would be nice to finding a
pong lying underneath the Christmas
tree
I would be quite
depress who that was actually scraped
the side wall I saw I saw
the
Sparks only cuddling I could do to s
yep
that's that's what that would be what
the P pump would be
[Music]
for the nice warm
cing oh that was
terrible this trke is a combination of H
track one and
two for some reason the water has turned
around s there's no train on the train
tracks me there's a fence going across
the train
[Music]
tracks but there's no there's no signage
for the train tracks it's just you're
driving there and all of a sudden there
there's a wa someone is
[Music]
losing still going to win this I mean
this whole whole left left which is why
I'm considering maybe I will win this
because next car is just upe
here I missed the turn
oh come on don't just get
stuck the car was stuck I would have won
that if I didn't get stuck maybe it's
mered uh this game does not do me a room
as far as I
know like this part is track one I think
no this is track two because you go
through the
town this is track
two but then when you go to that
uh do the uh go on the bridge or
whatever it
is uh well I
can yeah I should probably start this I
messed up there on the first lap I can
sh so I should also practice on that
turn over
there so instead of contining track
to up ahead
here that was a bad
turn you go over this Stone Bridge here
any
time here you
go and then you are and this is track
one but as far as I can see
uh this because at Stone Bridge you turn
left for track two but there you turn
right onto the bridge I'm not sure it's
stone bridge but stone fence fence at
least and when it ends that where track
one merges coming from the right and
you're coming from the left merging onto
each
other but what does not make sense is
that you cannot see track 2 or one but
their original tracks while going first
I see is a bit
weird that doesn't make any
sense thank you for the
Boost
okay no don't bump me here this is SC
Place being bumped
you're allowed to get
pumped well don't lose grip
now oh I see someone crashing oh both of
them are crashed nice nice
nice no no don't pump
me maybe it was like
an and it no I survived but I mean I'm
lost the race now haven't
I maybe there is an entrance there I
just don't see
it we're still keeping up with
him I definitely need more I beat more
tracks on the
track well
yeah okay now now it's time I'm not sure
what is speedometer says times 100 and
writing the numbers in tens when I could
use to times a thousand isn't that what
I usually
do
and they call revolutions per minute
they could call it kilo revolutions per
minute and have it being in
once
oh they they do it revolutions
per uh decc and divide it by 600
I'm I'm
seeing here we
go now I me second
things watch out car oh I said watch
out but I didn't watch
out who I think I lost more of
that ah I'm still kicking up tried to
slow down but it didn't I didn't slow
down early
enough car are so
bouncy go go go go
sometimes when I stream it just like the
pictures and showing up on scen on the
stream there we
go that with that driver totally illegal
move trust
me
the Only Rule is
to lap around the track and cross the
finish line three times doesn't matter
how you do
it oh wait the second rule is that if
you fall into the water you are
disqualified you oh
[Music]
my nice
500
now I just need to keep
that what
what
this car is good on this track maybe I
should use it for the UK track as
well try to use it for
UK my Frank is up need spe me or
something oh come
on recover thank
you
plus if I fall into water this game over
I just need to beat more careful
there I'm so so close to being the
r would be so nice
to finish this game
here finish up some old games I haven't
finished
before
am
new lap
[Music]
record I'm quite far ahead
now okay now we just need to be a bit
more
[Music]
careful okay
go and then
[Music]
here do have to why do you have to drive
so close to the
left
okay so far so
good
yes there we go not done with the water
yet though but two more segments of
water
segment one
complete and segment two up
ahead and there we go no more
water and now just straight ahead to the
go or curve to the
go
no turn the wrong
way you
shall lights in game on need
record whoa I did it
celebration fastest R time fastest Life
Time p n p
n
Save there we go I completed it that
means I unlocked a new
location
which is Norway but
let's a new car okay let's try the new
car
then Nissan Skyline
GTX I completed the first track does it
not it's apparently cannot save that you
only complete that's
stupid well one thing I use say
St
H is to for to
remember wait maybe I should do the
same here oh it's it's already like that
okay here we go let's
go first you can try I have won this
track before this track is located in
some real well the name of the place is
some real life place
wait it's this place I need to look at
first K how do you say that thing
K I really want to read in German
Gilda but it's a place in UK
okay I don't know if I have anyone here
from the UK at the
moment if anyone here is probably K if
you know right
I mean that person has to say
themselves have you ever been to kill
there kill
there K there I hardly know
her get the stat up
done
doesn't work as well because that that's
one of the past
tense K kill there such
accusations okay this is definitely
going much
better don't know why I had such trouble
keeping off with the traffic
in when I or play the game why is the
game so much easier now it's the exact
same
game and I think I prefer the upper one
cu the lower one has water W get out of
my way you're not even a leading
car I
said come on you're in you're in my
way for some reason I'm still just 100
me behind the leading card despite that
accident no it's 300
now 1550 more
like because it switch from 100 to0 m
ahead a bit far ahead then ahead of you
and then stays a zero until you get it
far far away from it so it goes to minus
100
me so it must be switching at each 50
m it basically rounds the value if that
makes
sense I'm I'm ere explaining
it
I would definitely enjoy
having one addition thisal just feel
nice so I can see I'm making
progress here we go of just saying the
same
number for a long time oh that was bad
running
keeping
UPS so maybe that's why I recognized the
new lap
record why I recognize the uh second uh
track so
well because I did complete the first
one it just didn't say my
progress and that's one of the
situations where I would use
save states
for when the game doesn't properly
save that in that way I'm not using a
save state to go
back to
like time machine or anything I'm only
using it to like continue for where left
off that makes
sense h okay this there been 30 minutes
of swim stre 30 minutes
left only
need I tried to get the car to drive
into the barrier
there car had to make an abas maneuver
which let me which did let me get ahead
there we
go how about that new life record how
about that win I need best race time too
but I've already come what's that like
a first
attempt yes there's no point of
saving in that case I only need to save
after completing all three I mean I
could create a safe state to be
fair this this ulator does have a system
for automatically saving save
states
um wish it I could set it to
periodically for like a reverse so you
can reverse the
time so you can have it save every
second every 10 seconds or something
like
that okay let's go back to the previous
car
but I would just like it to have because
there's been situations where game has
[Music]
frozen and it would be nice to be able
to go back to
previous
yeah remember
that so you guys to reverse the game
back to before it
frows but I will still not use it like
undo any mistakes
undo rather have like save save states
every minute or something so
it's quite some
amount of time between them second
music I
thought I need to pump the
tracks yeah still
not I must have complete the second one
too because I'm pretty sure I know about
going up the dir Road of site was there
missing
f
I wish they had a fourth track where
they have every path open so you
could
explore cuz they have
a uh open track where you can drive
whatever you
want but I wish they had it for these
tracks
too
wh you can choose how you want to
tr second place already that's not
bad
Qui I'm just bad at this segment with
this car or just overall bad at the
section so this is where the computers
catch up
and drive away from
me but I am able to catch up to them on
the dark
segment
[Music]
so yeah it is open there for some
reason and then you can get up back up
to
the eh not sure why you would take that
pass then I just catch up with the
driver
here the car ahead here which uh
finishes off
with this and the Finish Line Is Right
at the beginning of
the the asalted
road there we go hello
s okay yeah now I'm not going to cash up
sorry maybe I am I comment and
get your
comment is this no I touched the one
okay let's me to comment why you
approaching the Finish Line are you
coming for a
visit I guess I'm approaching the Finish
Line every time I move to the
east if we consider the line in the sea
to
be for the lake to be highest one I me
this but already too far
apart okay that was a weird driving but
I'm still only at Max
150 yeah this 150 me away so I might be
able to catch up with
this I have to confus some mistakes
Community seems to often do a mistake on
the segment
so which I appreciate still 150 M away
all right saw
something something okay not make a
mistake here
there's but I'm not sing
up
oh I mean I lost anyway but but that
finish was so
[Music]
so
H that finish
was
terrible at least I got a record I can
say now I can save
it that that ending of the
race
nice sticking out of
T to UK track
too um so this track two and three of UK
left and then there's two other
locations one is
Norway I don't know what the other
location
is
anyway I think there's one lock location
left and I think it starts raining after
a
while oh hello
yeah
he so maybe I
should goes so well in the
next a car on side
or perpendicular to the
road watch out
cart another car passing through
here let me switch mode then
still just bounces off a rock killer
that's how it works
right quite a difference actually
switch fin on gear
mode whatever you call it it's the only
thing I
catch
your car is made of
[Music]
you show something
yeah
[Music]
w sh
Pro and then I get
stuck it's typical game it's way too
easy to get stuck just so such big
polygons in this
game you should make a remake of this
[Music]
game it should play exactly the same it
just be I mean aside from a higher
polygon
count
that would be fun same exact
physics
where this the engine sound
go okay seem I seem
to seems to go better on
the asphalted
part asphalted I didn't know
oh someone
bumped
bar now I just need to catch up to the
leader there's the
leader Oh Me Oh you left left
[Music]
quick I guess that was
quicking
[Music]
losing distance
or distance increases I don't know how
you would say losing distance
losing
I mean it's this I want to this to
delet I'm losing
my
cany well it's a carate out of air
something just floats there
there
okay that didn't go as
[Music]
planned got a bit too eag just catch
it yeah now f
behind I'm doing
ter one doesn't even have massive bomb
to get stuck on the old rabbit and
[Music]
ttles I might rabit is that why I can't
win time the rabit doesn't give up
yes well thank
you why there have to be a
rabbit that should have been a
turtle well excuse me c we be to remove
the
shell even though the shell is Technic
body but but you know car
physics there we go that's
P the inside IND
grass
okay I definitely lost speed there okay
because I lost speed because you're Floy
and so too much air
resistance I guess that's something you
can
practice get a get a pon pon plushy and
see how far you can throw away
is there massive air resistance
considering all the FL people have I
want the material pump FL is made of to
have a lot of
F four
fur I think is pronounced four i f
a fake F
basically
polyester or whatever it
is
whoa except of course inside of the ears
and the eyes and any clothes would not
be made of that
material the clothes should preferably
be made of the same material as clo are
made
of no I don't want go in there again
that's how I lost the previous race I
lost the previous race for more reasons
but let's see that was one of the reason
you in general seem fairly everything
time oh
my what makes you say
that
is it because of my small
boobs my Bo don't get in the way of
catching
[Music]
air there is a lot of
rain I'm pretty sure I won this second
race too eventually
for when I
play
things come on
[Music]
now well I need
it no don't want to go in the
[Music]
grass this is not a lawn mower this is a
car oh
L I keep driving a lot to CR
anyway oh here we go here we
go pass you yes
no yes I man get back onto the
road yes is this a
win da car is so close
behind that was very close that was
close having boobs at Round you up
little wait what kind of sentence is
this a heck I just see um a random set
of words
here well that doesn't
same let's
do what did you
say new car available but let's probably
stick to that one also this is a snow
track we'll see how that
goes having boobs that
round you up little but don't increase
your aerodynamic surface you up little
what while reducing angle of attack for
the air while not having massive ass for
same
reason where is the
snow I always promised
snow I wasn't promised uh Eng sentence I
wasn't able to understand
I had a bit of a TR what you try to say
there I think I get
[Music]
it but
um oh yeah
yeah okay that was
terrible yeah my my butt is not
messy my boobs are not
messy I do want to
the if it's not too much to ask for
having the boobs and butt and defin on
the
flash
okay everyone is stuck go go go go
go go go go go I'm a lawn
mower M okay there we
go need to remember where that is next
time cuz I can't see exact like maybe I
can use my second light mode
too it is shining slightly more ahead
it's not by much
well so yeah this is the alternative
path you could take in the previous
track which sure why you
would because it seems to be longer but
in this track three you're
for now back to regular race one of the
two one of the two parts in a branching
SE segment you might be for to go into
the water this
time
nope they didn't
fory you never
know okay I did complete that
oh hello
my core that's not your
name that's me much there we go hi pwn
I'm back I don't I'm not sure why I
can't remember malefic welcome
back new La record I need to
remember where I need stop bre here this
the
bridge turn left
here turn left
more oh and then there it
is and then
no I hope you had a good time
away I'm making progress this is the
final UK race I completed all the US
races and then I only have two locations
left it's a total of six races left and
and then the game is 100% it I would say
there is the championship mode but it
works similar I thought that the arcade
mode would be more fun it's kind of like
two different waves of playing the
game the championship
mode I think goes to through all the
tracks as well so there's four
four
championships split
into 2 by two
TS two of them are the track one version
and two of them are the track two and
three
versions two of them are the the amateur
class uh vehicles and two of them are
the pro class vehicles I don't know if
that that's think that's the turn or is
the
gtn I something something I think it was
amateur and pro but I could wrong I
might pick a different
game
oh come on
car thank you for the
bum Im doing that in a real race is
still be in the first
place why is the comp e of this
TR maybe Compu just does call in
darkness
SE
yeses the six is in Swedish races yes
the number six in Swedish is sex it's
the exact same word for what sex in even
in
Swedish six and sex is the same
[Music]
W which is what I saw some map on
like someone tried to do like a map of
Europe where they listed the funny
number of every country and 69 is the
funny number of every country in Europe
except for Poland which is
like one other number and turkey has
another number but I would argue like in
Sweden it really depends which age you
go for if you're like young children
like who has starting to learn about six
and stuff uh six would be the funny
number for that
reason I think that map just shows the
uh an issue that people often have
people establish some default and apply
the default to everything unless
otherwise
stated which gives a lot of
errors
are you saying that manosi oh Monaco or
Monaco that's not where Monaco
is that's not what Rome
is and that is
UK but is that where what was the place
again
called um what did I say the play let me
just take a quick look at what the place
was
called well I read a comment last one
was pretty good
co
coy
coy just a quick look at what track what
the location it
was there we go it is
heal there okay heal there
UK and that's
it it's a location in the
UK and it's
located in
like it's it is in
England and
it's it's close it's a bit it's more
like Center centered West
East it's a bit further a bit South and
bit
east I mean Norway I mean Norway yeah
China I'm pretty sure that's not
China USA I mean that's correct Peru
wait swim s done
now for sports malef is that first
redeem Brazil That's I don't think
that's I think that's outside I don't
know it's a very stylish map Africa at
least they managed to hit
Africa it's so weird because every
location ah J is coming in with the rede
every location is a country except
Africa
um and uh Rome Rome and Afric are to
that AR countries why couldn't they use
call I mean yeah it's it is Rome but he
could have called it Italy and Africa
where is this Tanzania or something
anyway back to
Norway R is relatively close is it
though it's like it's like place in
North Rome Italy as as far as I know
it's more like South
South it's like in it's it's on the
western part of Italy but uh western
coast but halfway like in the middle of
the whole
thing but I feel like that point was
more like a sunmarine or
something this is snow
track yeah wow someone's sliding all
over the place
this
slippery I say Ro in in the circle
doing I mean technically true I think
every location is in the circle when car
is doing that every
start uh start the race um when the
circle is the biggest it is uh it is RO
with in the circle but when the circle
is the smallest just a dot it is not
where Rome is located or
where K there K there maybe it's K
there that's how it's pronounced I'm in
the west coast oh you're in the west
coast I was born on the east coast and
then I
moved but I'm going to move back to the
east
coast I am at a moment
nothing come
on can I just finish finish can I just
get cross this where's this can I
complete this first
segment start running into that rock
every single time it's very narrow
here so yeah if you want to reveal are
you are you a West coaster East coaster
or are you in the middle you could also
be a South coaster or North coaster too
whoops I saw the track went that
way
that's a p to
make which CL are you closest
to yeah
Point H I live near po but not not of
sea yeah uh yeah fair
enough fair
enough yeah if it's like a little Lake
H if it's like a massive Lake no I I
would say it should be the same I I
think that's
better or I mean yeah we for the Bal SE
also that's a question for you uh
because
uh in Swedish the Baltic Sea is known as
the eastern Lake I think I've heard that
that's the same term used in Finnish
taken from Sweden eastern Lake makes
sense in Swedish because it's to the
east of Sweden oh ads why does the ads
have to play every
time
um I get back this coming then unless my
left cor does not get an which some
don't gets sorry about the ads and I Rel
near one of two of
them
legs so yeah I think you're correct
think eat something like
this Mar for
here here
mad that like romance
fory
mad I'm going on
this now he's back to gaming difficult
again maybe I need to leave it for
another 6
months eat the East and M
sea
yeah that would be a c of
[Music]
[Music]
Swedish I wonder what
the Finish borrowing would be wait two
SIDS it would be possible to fure that
on we also have Su
l i
[Music]
don't I'm trying
and I'm doing this really bad probably
need a better car this car is not doing
it for
me gol of
Finland is it
CH where is the game okay let me try mon
first Toyota Supra which wasn't that
super
golf of
Finland oh yeah that one between
uh yeah we call it the Finish golf in so
golf of Finland in Swedish as well
between Finland and island or in
Estonia so everyone back so I switched
over
to to Monaco
instead the uh Norway track was a bit
too slippery for
me I'll TR try this
part bit easier track to deal
with and after I complete the three
races of this I might unlock some car
that might do better for
me on the norion track
should probably have been on the left
side it's
shorter
out relatively middle of the country we
are live near L
too okay
don't don't Ral too
much
too bad there's no track for
Finland which I did joke about having a
remake of this game it would be
interesting to have like
uh
a sequel to the game a very late sequel
oh no my
clothes my sports
way p p forgot her great girl outfit
when she was supposed
to stand on the
grid so she just took off her dress and
went out there and underwear and hoping
no one would
notice no one realiz
it there we go CL are
back I'm ding more of the wall than on
not very
much I think I need to
hydrate okay I see I your fur oh no
raling too
much my my he that
fur I'd say you can get to see a lot of
P Pon fa
already if you if you take the amount of
f you see with the sports wear and the
swing
seit there's a lot
of s
with those to
M or too little depending on how much
you want to
see maybe you're
right maybe you're not satisfied with
the
on The Voice shorts are covering too
much
I think I think it's kind of more like a
compromise having like voice shorts
training
bra it's more of
a i covering type of
underwear closer to the type of Goofy on
way definitely not l
[Music]
we we call them boxers well boxers would
be uh or
[Music]
men boxes are the more loose
type they are they would be tight around
the like the waistband and then they're
like very loose below
that while boy shorts are mostly tight
all
around it's just panties with short
legs but still tied to the
body I think the the male version would
be boxer briefs I think that's the term
which
is which is breached but with legs like
boxers but not loose like boxers no my
box is tight all yeah yeah
so yeah box brief the combination of
briefs and
boxers I could see them being called
boxers for
short I'm not going
to be say no to that but a difference is
though that boy shorts are for women so
they are
designed not designed with male Assets
in mind if that's a way to phras
it so that was an interesting
they do take space
yeah the mail on thew to give is the
signed to give extra space in the
front female underwar usually
don't but if you find the right type of
anties you can find some that are
quite whoa that was close sorry I saw
those Sparks
Fly you can find some that are quite H I
was going to say
elastic well yeah quite elastic
fabric so they're still comfortable to
wear even if you have assets most women
don't
have
that's the second sport
way my goal I have to win this oh it's
past midnight
there me have gone yeah been streaming
for three hours
now I did not managed to complete this
game
within how no long I was playing this
okay now too bad the blue part is run
into
me it's
only only I running to pillar I'm
catching UPS here this is yellow car
go oh that's quite fine 650 M to catch
up I got one and a half laps on me or
so
150
550 I think I'm too quick here come oh
come on
on I couldn't just hit turn a bit so I
could face alongside the road I could
keep on going need to go a bit slower
before
[Music]
[Music]
that
and I'm losing distance to the yellow
car now I seeing losing distance again I
don't know what the ter term is what is
it called when
I'm yellow car is gaining distance from
me of me to
me y there's the yellow car again
I see nothing in one left I even still
behind yellow car prev lap I passed it
before oh now I got stuck on the
raining
go now I did not drive up on this one
that was much
better
[Music]
but and it's crashing I was S I wasn't
going to do
any but I'm not to far
think I can win this
race who whoa the blue car is crashing
over oh I'm crashing all over what
weened there so suddenly the car
jumped
wh here we go busy I'm doing much better
now 5 50 m oh come on touch the grass a
little and then
just then I'm placed all the way back
here and I'm I
lost I me sure in real life if you touch
your you
the wheels on half side of your car is
no longer having good grip
and slipping and that could uh lead to
some accident I would
assume left
what
okay oh
now what am I
[Music]
doing
okay
bye
oh that was close camera can K through
the pill
to okay should be able to win this
race
yeah yeah
out I see there's the camera changing
Buton I mean if I crash and
like gets back to last position that's
like
d
I guess I could just restart if I'm just
falling if I yeah if I
crash up in last
position gu where restarting any right
the start
of must just say start of
that mean I'm gained
[Music]
nothing some car is standing on its nose
there we go this is much
better this is more like
it
so no no too tight corner
[Music]
there h
no wiggling all over the
[Music]
place I don't need how take Corner okay
I was hoping to be in a second position
at this point but I can I still making
too many
mistakes
there is another racing game I would
like to play but mostly put challenge
mode more
than now can see if I can catch up to
yellow car 50 m to
[Music]
gain now let's see
could
worse like that I need bump everyone
going I mean I still go quite right
right quickly
but you keep bouncing back and forth
B has spe
left
no see quite distance to the next
car
and then I drove too close to the
C5
and
S oh my
right so much to
me okay hello P hello mad
[Music]
que Queen I
guess
welcome welcome doing
some completed some unfinished
business never finish
this
game so better do
it let this
game be better than me
second place nice there is the lead okay
let me read the comments but just want
to see a magic trick yes oh got me some
magic
trick
see okay I'll make the bun disappear
Oh Oh no you're very
malfunctioned then you didn't make me
disappear I got knocked into the grass I
got distracted damn it out this head how
could this have
happened oh no
I'm why did you do this to
me oh my outfit is back
good that was a bad Magic
pck
because you keep laugh you always want
to show up your mck everyone that shows
up yeah I always
morning I was always morning to science
yeah whoop two cars
crashed
Le come do that I mean good
but there we go jumped over the cars I'm
not exactly sure I that
but kind of look like I
did okay it goes pretty well
now at least at least you come to you
mag pick for a
while hey why are you quicking let me
what is
this now I got knocked into the side oh
it went so well and then I know got
knocked off the
[Music]
track same
s hello P
El and what time do you
call
Se
what this go to bed ah
what what did you do
what
when
no I not won this race
yet I need to win this race otherwise I
can't go to
bed
go of
course after I win
this
um I mean at least there's no damage
but
I should probably not crash into
things Oh you mean by call you mean like
when I'm am I going to end the
stream I don't
know I'm getting so distracted by
everything
okay
whoops that's there should be a button
to
place find
button there's like no not maybe Miss in
the
Buton come on what's that good
forter just out to get
[Music]
me
strengthen you
one let me
through right three more cars it's only
five only five cars I have to
pass shouldn't be that should
it very scared to drive these fast 180
fast those
pillers we not do it in real
life
[Music]
okay and then there's this tunnel
here
[Music]
go
[Music]
next
lap and
fourth that was so close iced the
pillar
that was so close I scraped the pillar
again but I did not
crash not I'm trying to be
close complete
crash oh this is
this is a
challenge get out of
way I'm try
TW
oh constant crashing let me double check
this what if I move
this
not and see how it changes
things
some cars are
cing sparks are
flying why do I have to go
this didn't didn't even get to test how
the car would behave cuz it
pressed
one car is driving on the click one but
how how come that car tackling me and
then
that B from I guess this perfectly
possible still have
nice
okay so the max speed up now
220 that
means but I do have high
acceleration that might allow me to
catch
up as long as I don't achieve our speed
of turn
20 I don't lose out on potential
speed the cars still drive past
me
byebye
okay there's only one segment so far I
managed to achieve that
[Music]
speed here two okay two
segments okay so I need
to adjust it
slightly
so I can achieve a slightly high
[Music]
speed don't even see
Le
new
La it's quick but not quick enough to
let
catch par crashed
perfect the car
stuck
well I
guess I guess that's my
[Music]
luck it's yellow car that was normally
in I guess see yellow car is second
place
now starts in second
place the lead car crash completely okay
with
this
then I might win this R then if I don't
completely
[Music]
myself
see this is why you don't give
up
oops what my my
is
this is not far to the go from

the ghost of a
rocket just half a ghost and Rocky

which which side of Rocket Man is which
half of Rocket
Man going to ruin that
joke I think that was the question
before which half of Rocket Man is the
rocket don't remember which side he said
but how about the back
[Music]
side t it's time a mess right oh like a
bad mess
or okay mess but just a big
mess I do personally feel like a
complete mess due to my current
situation but not to one up your
situation there everyone is allowed to
feel like a
miss which is kind of why I'm streaming
to just get my thoughts and other stuff
so I don't cuz I'm going I'm going
through so much
[Music]
[Music]
insy qu gohost quter rocket quter man
quter I don't know
okay which place is on the dni and
[Music]
next qu
[Music]
profanity hope you're okay I am
okay and I do have people who are
willing to support
it's just
that I need to sell this house and move
out but get in contact with any form of
real estate agency that is like handles
the location I have the house in it has
been hard the agency I got in contact
who I bought the house through I've not
got announcer from within like over 48
Hours contacted another a agency spe
yeah that might be able they do other
locations that are not too far away from
so they might be able to cover the area
but other agencies are
like capital or like the biggest cities
that's I'm really living far out in the
countryside or whatever it's
called far away from big cities
so in a small
town was able to get get get the house
for cheap in the first
place first things aren't working out so
I'm trying to sell it in
just but that isn't working out there
so that's the from now messing
up oh look the other panda
the real P imagine companies leaving
market
caps sometimes feels like like sometimes
I try to contact companies to like do
business with them and they're not aling
like I guess sometimes they don't cover
what the
do oh that was
nice red car wanted to go left the blue
car wanted to go right the both went
into the
pillar this is a good start I was going
to say oh look at that look at that
flip look at
that nice 360 rotation through the air
landed back on the
wheels still lost some time on that but
it's good
that sounds a bloody
might I assume it's supposed to say that
sounds like a bloody
nightmare yeah first worried about like
um that I wouldn't get the same money
back that I bought the house
for and some some parts of the house
might
have
fallen
apart but the moment I don't didn't care
about getting money back I just want to
get the house away from some
money I was doing so well and I'm just
crashing all over place the
first loing a little bit of CR play
doesn't fix yeah I've been although I've
been playing a lot of scratching
byself by way man I think I think
we had the idea of doing
like don't remember crash one but no
death as see how far we can get I did it
and uh not completed the game though
just be clear on that but I got to the
first temple level I don't remember the
name of
it say for some reason I remember the
other level which is JW of Darkness
that's the other one what's it first
called for some reason I want remember
temple ruins but that might not be the
name of
it it's the level after some at
Le the hardest I got on that
was B into the
level and it was one why did I do that
some one jump I just kept failing and
then I S successfully crossed that and
then for some
reason a jump didn't
happen and then a f
but yeah that's the first I got without
D I wouldn't mind watching you trying to
play the it was the PS1 version if you
are
able because
the Remake might behave differently
so I just can't play the Remake stable
enough to stream it on this
computer sadly
oh come on need to get some serious
practicing before I didn't I mean I just
went straight into it I'll be more
rusted than a behind on the
back I mean that's part of the fun isn't
it I mean if you're going to do practice
you should do it on stream that's like
that's part of the
fun there we go 400 m to Next Car 450 m
to the lead
there I just went straight into it on
stream okay 550 M I lost 100
me
oh why is everyone quicking at
[Music]
me out of the
way up
oh where did the engine
go another thing I do want to do in
Crash is play the
uh remake of Crash three but try like a
speed
run but I
said need a new computer before I attemp
that oh 750 me I lost like
twoes I'm not going to win this race the
only thing I can hope for now is that
the leading car crashes into the killar
again which happened for
me the previous race I almost won but
then
I tunnel and didn't win the race anyway
so so oh
well m it as a Christmas special that
would be fun do let me know you
you're
like if there's any like suggested game
or
anything I suggest this really good for
anyone who streams but most people who
follow aren't
here and that if I suggest a game you're
perfectly fine to just ping me whenever
he start streaming it that's perfect
perfect
fine I can't fully understand not doing
that yeah most dreams CU that would be
kind of
inconsiderate bird is perfectly find if
I suggested playing a
game oh like telling me like daytime I
can probably put it in the
schedule long as specify time zone or
use the Discord time zone for or time
and date
for then I can inser CH there's some
ideas and also the leading car has
already cross there's no no need for me
to
racing it would be a fun Christmas
special cuz you did try to uh do Spire
two without taking damage I tried that
for Spire
one I did
uh I complet I got s dragons to to get
to the next world and
I yeah I did
um not 100% thing but I did
finish almost all levels in the first
world except the boss because the boss
is scary the dogs are scary not so much
the boss
um
but I
failed right at the end maybe I did try
to maybe I did have 100% levels but I
failed right at the end of Al P Square
because I accidentally got too close to
a
ball he hit me from
sight o Kitty bum I'll head to bed you
should to
see
you
see if you still here would it be too
much to ask you to add some commas
between like the different thoughts in
her sentence
yeah you definitely still here you want
to take one last look at the
underwear if I look at my the list of
redeems yeah is terrible the last four
redeems has been G doing that
exactly H got a list of games that I'm
looking to play but I'll add crash one
no death to it when I locate my P oh
yeah oh yeah I think
you if you have like physical paper and
Pen instead of doing like notes in your
phone or something I do I have the uh a
channel on my Discord server where I
have games I should be
playing that will be when I oh I
this that would be when I get back to
streaming regularly I will get back to
doing the
gam and some games I'm just don't have
the now goes really good as far as I
know this does not
oh I don't know how further we streaming
for
so just want to finish this race I can
end the
stream let's
see
p and under on the next road side
give me that moment yeah it's like 3
minutes
in give me a I will I will push the ads
back and then I will continue playing
for NE hello isn't it really
late or S midnight again don't look at
my time though
oh wait I was supposed
to I was supposed to take a hydrate
for
for
man I sleep on the
floor
well I hope you find it
comfortable clear off some here
go I just want to win this race and then
I wanted to end the
Stream
well how about to head to bed I just
want to see how things are going
yeah yeah done that too before I go to
bed I just sneak into some streams to
say hello it is it is does make me happy
even if you stay for like a few
minutes know that you care enough to
show show
her I
mean
I I I I assume you care anyway like you
have no reason not to
care that's something weird of
this but car so much that you actually
decides to show up and uh type in the
chat that actually means a lot to
me see still be sitting here you
watching about 3 hours I yeah it's
either well wo wo wo wo it's either I
finish the track in like let's say let's
say 15 more minutes on like or like
let's
say
1:00 U so 10 more
minutes and then if I haven't won the
race before that just end this I'll end
it
all the
heart
ah sorry about
that yes no I'm getting
tackled yeah I
like I like looking at the emotes I had
to make them as big as I could on the on
the on screen chat which makes it easier
for other people to see the emotes in
full size too two emotes will be in full
size three emotes will be sced down
I yes random Tre I gu you can do it just
focus on the
road fa up fa up reading chat while
driving is not a good
combination especially when you're going
like
200 okay I need to make one more adjust
to the
car and
yes this
one that's
a that's 30 steps that one is so F def
find
of little hearts but each their own
wait it C on the floor wait what do you
mean by har har what do you mean by
harsh
I know I know I said about the weird
stuff
there I said a lot of
stuff I mean if you meant the part I
said
that people can't
that because I I did realize that it's
almost sounded like I tried to say that
people only care if they actually show
up and write in the chat and I and I try
to no no that's not what I meant people
do still care but they care
like the amount the amount of caring
people give that when they actually take
take
time out of their day or night
especially when they're going to to bed
and still taking time out to write in
the chat that does mean a lot
okay I think it's a little mean that you
called my in-game driving bad and I'm
watching this with my seat belt
on oh you're referring to something
completely different
[Music]
now yeah what yeah you were driving
um uh GTA there we go that's what you
were driving now I remember yes you were
driving that
bad I mean to be fair you were driving
in a lot of traffic I'm
not but at the same time I still felt
like you weren't staying on the road
much but I
am but to be fact GTA 5 in this specific
case has different driving
physics
so I have not played that game so I
actually don't know how tricky it is to
say on the road and especially
considering those roads are more meant
as roads of
traffic this is more of a race track so
there is a difference like that stop
tacking
me
just want to win this
race it's still cold on the floor why
don't you lie down on
like pillow or
a bed or
something thanks now no don't
trry you'll get oil
everywhere okay
that's there you go some head pets for
Rocket
Man there
there little man of
Rocket don't be sad you are a good
driver we can pretend like you're a good
dve oh you found the
[Music]
star and stars must mean a lot to you
you get so close to them I mean
relatively distance proportionally not
so much but if you still like orbiting
a but you are technically
closer if you're orbiting
Earth I'm still cold you need a blanket
then or like a what do you call it maybe
it's call a blanket in
English thanks for tackling me little
man I'm 14t
tall what's that in actual measurements
to hold
in oh chew hole in one no don't chew
hole in
it climbing this wall I actually don't
know what these walls are made of they
are quite solid so I'm not I actually
don't know what they made
of
the outer walls are like
bricks inner walls some of them probably
brick
team I think I checked
that
like no I don't know what not
here bananas at one fun 4 about for me
okay
don't know what Swedish people use for
measuring stuff well meters like most
people around the
world meters with two decimals or
centimet with no
decimals take your pick could be
decimeters with one decimal which
really I mean we could measure people in
just decimet and fine with that I'm 18
decim who who to Ibrahimovic
yes what I touched I touched the white
line and got bound back climb on man
head yeah that's a good place to like I
see the
world let's take over the world Rocket

militaries it appears I have a panda

attempt okay that was I okay that was a
terrible start I give one I one more
attempt with a good
start well blue car can me
there this p is chewing my brain look a
perect message

surprised here we

drove over the grass that was not too
close that was on top of
it
no too quick too
fast not so Furious though someone
bunny well it's 1:00 time to end the
stream yeah at least you should finish

speed I should probably whoa whoa whoa

my time my that was my opportunity
pass but I didn't take
it I didn't take it I lost my
opportunity second place is for losers I
