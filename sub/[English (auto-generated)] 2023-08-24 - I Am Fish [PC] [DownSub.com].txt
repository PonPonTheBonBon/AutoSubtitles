uh since I did there was a game oh hello

Rocket Man

rocket man is here I have a solution or

another solution I have no solution for

playing Shadow Legacy instead however if

I play

and the other game that I tried to play

a long time ago which is called

I am fish

it was running on the wrong person and

like graphics card before so it was

running terribly it wasn't running too

bad anyway uh it's surprisingly good or

after realizing it was running on the

wrong graphics card but now I switched

over to the audio graphics card

so now it might actually run

as smooth and stable

so how much trying that game

um

I played the Shadow Legacy before very

long time not too long ago I guess but I

never finished it I didn't get it or

even

and

I'm actually interesting yeah I guess

that's like my backup game

and see if now that I've switched the

graphics card

because I didn't realize uh it had two

caps cards to pick from in the first

place and wide pick the wrong app start

uh iron fish is made in unreal

and

then there is uh

crash the trilogy which is when I

realized that

like I had team graphics card

that game was told me which graphics

card it was running on I'm starting at

the game it's audio game

and it sure took its time let me bring

it up on screen

uh window

iron fish

I guess

what do they call this Nike

no

Unity not unreal iron business made in

unity

thank you

right

there we go

and it's not playing while I don't have

it selected

so let's switch like that

add audio

to the game

and there we go

I haven't played this before for some

reason I can't use a deep path

[Music]

but I guess I'll just go back in

I don't know

they start and try to find the

bread or some stuff now that the game

should run smooth

too many is run smooth

let's see how this goes then

the backup game

hopefully it doesn't run smooth because

it wouldn't it would be strange if it

didn't

because when I did check any

charge settings

I wish I could see like now which which

is running on

it is loading the game slower I think

oh

for some reason

like now it's stuck but

ah

there you go

it's

running smoothly I think definitely

running smoothly

I've had some weird Poppins what what do

you call it but it's definitely normal

[Music]

and until it's switching scenes then

it's

nagging a bit

[Music]

because she's friends

that the Goldfish lost in the intro that

they didn't play

[Music]

yeah and they're definitely definitely

must be playing one at this point

[Music]

some occasion is stuttering but yeah

time to time to get out of here

so it's staying

Factory

it's kind of running

I said today it still raspberry but

you're my teacher but you're apparently

not a fish

only

sorry

why do this

yeah

another fish goodbye fish

you're not my friend I don't care about

you

well well

another fish but you're not my friends

so I don't care about him

it must be like

five pieces of red

that's

maybe she eats friends I guess

funny should not eat breakfast

like

how when

is it

yeah it's definitely much more playable

now than it was before

you could probably

um

let me adjust everything with the

streaming because I basically only done

smaller game currently that doesn't

require

they fight over this

set to

that should be true

this piece of bread more priority to the

game

foreign

like

is that your well

you're not my friend so I'm going to

kill you

[Music]

whoa freedom

and that's the

game everyone said like no response

settings

this computer it's not powerful

the game is from right let me send

well and yeah I can't go down there

that's that's

that'll break it

sure

it's almost like this is purpose built

to roll across how weird

hmm

how are we

I like Outdoors

[Music]

if you I don't know how terrible it runs

what if another one blows up I want a

chicken sauce

it was the middle of the night and no

one was there

I think there's ever so [ __ ] yes

well

10 million days what if another one

blows up

again it's a freak accident

that's worse though isn't it that means

anyway moving on

oh

what's uh

did you get started for completing these

levels it's like based on how quickly

come back

how many times you said

good thing that lead still shocked yeah

it was very very well designed

container for the fish in the first

place

now it seems

seems like a hazard you know

what is the fish in this boat anyway

that's that's um

no

let's not be sent

I was supposed to get the right

cannot get all five pieces

but I need 2007 gain so

the aniti

camera here

okay

yeah there's something here

let's ride this one down

he would leave

[Music]

um

I need it

[Music]

I

kind of lost where the other pieces of

Reds are

me I said fine and oh

okay

and I've only found

here I don't even remember

oh no no no no

no I'm moving the wrong way

I'm curious about

that was

tasty girl to only Recreation

perfectly safe to land them

right

wow here we go

[Music]

what happens

here

last time

ah it is about one what is this

this is unacceptable

in the game

[Music]

you did it but I'm stuck in a bar

they hide and seek hang out still try

why are you not why I didn't go fish

crossed there oh wait there is someone

on the ground fish Telegram

apparently

maybe you get

[Music]

we'll hide it in the Loft so Mom and Dad

don't find out

I don't like it my name right now

while the character speaks one line at a

time

final point two or five it definitely

runs better than

right

should I

[Music]

[Music]

the second thing

let's see if I can continue this

see if it runs Smooths because this

shouldn't be a big city anymore

hey

[Music]

hey hey hey

I remember this level crossing out

another lag

and I know the um

other catfish you could cry yeah but how

did I

[Music]

what was the controls the one

[Music]

that's ID

it doesn't detect freshwater

and don't drink this kind of water

oh

come on come on please you can do it you

can do it

you can do it you're almost in the water

come on come on oh you did it you almost

died and he did it

then what counts

tonight

it runs better but it's still like him

[Music]

[ __ ]

how

and what's this specific Studio

[Music]

whoops

come on come on land and wait I was in

touch

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

and why did you do that stupid fish

not really dying

being stupid

[Music]

you survived and be lucky

finish it that seems very appropriate

motivation

um

I need to adjust the uh

can I

[Music]

so I can see what's going on down the

stream

oh yeah yeah one more thing

I should

there you go that should save some

performance

[Music]

we have nothing I'm running

[Music]

oops

you can do it come on come on

come on touch the button here we go good

fish no checkpoint still

[Music]

this song is unboxing

[Music]

nice but there was an attempt yay

[Music]

wow it's nice

head first

needs to watch the legs

and I'm like the next next frame I'm

already

no no

[Music]

let's be them

the fish has no emotion well this is my

life now

fine

yeah like you like that

it's no emotions

one more time

one more time

oh yeah

[Music]

be right back

he left front

oh that was too early

jump into the water

[Music]

and his workers

spraying bag

there's what's over here

nothing

I guess nothing

nothing of Interest

sorry butts that's fish drinking is not

funny maybe maybe fish will stop lying

whoa

and band the nine

we need to Diamond enough

into the water

Kitty

good piece

well

prediction at how many resets there will

be at the end of this

oh

okay

sorry

I guess I'll leave in here now

um nosed

um

what's

no I wasn't dead but I was down in that

what I said satisfied

but that wasn't the difference

um

it's been up at first another one

hmm

yeah I'm pretty sure what's this this

track has solved right this one wasn't

acting

then we're right back in now

anyway

amazing job

Okay so

where am I supposed to go

oh I can come back oh that's dead

no no

the fish is dead

okay I'm respect back okay yeah

Fitness

let's go back and change it's nothing

there's some it's that thing that's that

looks interesting

[Music]

foreign

activate

the only thing of interests

is very suspicious distraction with the

warning

General danger sign

well

yep that is something

I don't remember because last time

Watchers racing

you mean

I can't swim through him

oh yeah

I'm a free fish now

three points

okay more more of this

song

the fish didn't make it [ __ ] you know

nope

I want to go up uh to have some behind

my head back to square control of the

flying at that point and then I'm back

against this right that was supposed to

get here because there was a checkpoint

I hope they gains in 19 or something

there's another

yeah same here

the game has taught me that I should go

for the signs

if you've seen wanting something in real

life just go up and hit them that's what

this game is talking about

come on come on come on

that was next to the sign

that was nuts where I was supposed to go

but I might be able to keep you sign up

yeah he still counts

uh-huh

yep

thank you

does that means what level yep there we

go

oh the fish got enough by the same

another sign

there you go

okay moving on

opinion is back

hmm

interesting games I guess you're around

the gates what's the point of this game

I guess it's different skin

also this is very very general rule in

the game if you see a pattern press it

no way I can press that button

does that mean that would eventually be

able to press that button

wait I can't

I can't hacking

that doesn't look good

don't don't watch this training against

an electrical boards

and here you got an electric box being

open with a buttonini

not reach but maybe I can progress to an

experience because clearly this cake is

not blocking this fish

uh we got uh ads

tonight

thank you

[Music]

here it is

when I can't

try to kiss me again

that's nice nice

[Music]

but

here again

now I don't think I'm supposed to be

here

maybe I can reach that one

because it was a swimming

no let's let's give a heck

why'd you learn watching for me to begin

with the other day

Let's ignore this one for now

oh this is back to this room

oh yeah they they that came has changed

in

clear away again give me a snack this

time why didn't you bring the snack last

time

buttons just press the buttons

okay the only thing I think I'll be this

one oh there's a sign there that other

side okay

I have to press the sign

my fish flying

all right now it's on the woods

you only need to touch the sign

I missed the sign

you're whatever but I forgot yeah it

happens to me too I go away to do

something and that's the only thing I'm

supposed to go and do but I forgot and

then I come back and I know you guys I

didn't do the one thing I was supposed

to do

and then I go again

come on this thing

wow something easy

at least it's not lagging now

foreign

like forcing or like

something

[Music]

I think that's when when enough options

let me

all right

I know anyone who wants to do the

prediction is a prediction for how many

times I've personally said

seconds

I have to reset or maybe I shouldn't fly

maybe I should just let let the place

fish flying

I think I did that the first time I

don't maybe I've never tried to just let

the kids like land for crashes that is

fine okay let's see if I can just let

the fish

crash into it without

maybe I'm always thinking this

I don't know what I had to do

okay and there I definitely definitely

out of that okay

see we came here some messages sometimes

I have applies sometimes

[Music]

and okay here we got the button

definitely

okay what did they do

let's follow the table as fast as I can

the gate has been open

I drink okay

I will hydrate

man of rockets

I am now trying to move

no myself

as I increase the level of water maybe I

can reach this button

or coming in while you're lying so much

now can I just check is there a setting

at least or something

even a settings page takes time to open

call say hi now

we're too low

do you want to hike quantities

you go to go to my patreon and donate to

my patreon and then I'll get you some

high quality pictures

I'm a Warframe right

you have to pay for the fish right back

again bang back in here we're back for

real this time

was that was that because

instead of uh

like the quality

I was learning more because I said they

wanted to text you soon

now I said behind qualification you know

the next less now

since

okay so I definitely can hit the button

what I apparently can't see the button

but it should be possible still

I got a link of dried sausage

bought it from the meat market does I

don't have the means to make my own okay

[Music]

I hope it's a good news

and the link to my patrons kids

there we go that's what I wanted

now the gate is open

this one Gates

this can't

this kid doesn't even oh wait there's

this

okay

it's front of the cable

you're gonna be stuck in this

come on how am I supposed to find that

okay that's not bad

there again

supposed to go

I missed that my smoothie you know they

miss him at this point

in like a

space

from him

foreign

luckily

can I

if I go to my two weeks this should be

that managed

video stream manager

how to manage

they can manage the one thing and

Intimates

again

is that a

that looks a very weird way of saying

the Swedish WordPress

and

yeah I don't know if that was what you

were going for

sometimes this stuttering is a great

amount of touching

all right

let's see now fish species can fly

[Music]

yeah there you go I know fish don't die

on each day

that would be a sad sight

oh Pablo has had predicted

does this latch

there you can do yeah

and now now we can get out of here

I know it's stalking

and like one frame a second

this is my life

this is what I'm doing

and live with for a long time

when I win

okay so that's where I need to go

the only thing I can think of is going

into

this one as a step up

and it doesn't have water in it

it's very high up because then I should

be able to shop that away

thank you

um but

a nice view is that

yeah and then come in

yeah I can't bring up my

prediction on

ah here we go

yeah

[Music]

honestly learning how to how to Twitch

[Music]

point

thank you

I actually have the two people have

predicted so far that's fine

that actually means can mean something

else and

um

yeah the prediction time is over and

let's say you should

you shouldn't do

if there's no winner I will just delete

the prediction again all the points back

right here is where I'm supposed to go

Billy me

campaign

go

nice

I don't have bad animal to me

good afternoon

come on come on come on yes

um no

[Music]

you need to

move

change the angle

so close

I'm not stinking the water

[Music]

there we go all of a sudden there the

cameras all right

am I supposed to go from here to there

to one of them otherwise I have to climb

up here again

okay

it's not going good at the moment

come on come on

I guess I'll just have to go back

please

thank you

the brain doesn't have a fish to begin

with

and also don't

expectedly Stone

oh what do you call a fish without eyes

when there's only one eye on that fish

I mean it doesn't work in week before by

the way

thank you

that's it doesn't doesn't work

[Music]

oh it's such a handy thing

yeah there are too many frames to work

yeah sometimes this sometimes there's a

big jump sometimes you better energy I'm

gonna really really yeah like that there

was no jump at all and I really think

I really think this is due to the other

frame rate

but now it's running smoothly

no you're not even running smoothly

before

if this was a real game another unity

game it would run much better on this

community

yeah um

I'm still confused about it

I don't know what to do

but I like that

that is six thousand points in the

waterfall is feeling watery in Japan but

where is the water going from there how

is it not allowing exactly it should

it's the water level should increase so

I can get out of here

I am so confused

because now I

[Music]

I mean it was taking last time

anything no

foreign

s

and did Kate up there before and then I

just faded flying but there's no

checkpoint up there so I can just reset

back up there again

because that would be convenient

thank you

there we go finally and then I almost

I've shot it I know

and that would be a shame if I

overshot

so and now I should just do that once

once again all of a sudden it's just

quick

literally

okay finally

whoa I didn't

I didn't

oh

Full Speed Ahead oh

this

this looks weird

this doesn't look like

it's like a building that is has a

slight water damage

report number 359 how did Dr Robert not

predict this you should have known Bobs

would eventually gain sentience now

they've escaped labs and began living

across border chair with no knowledge of

what they're supposed to be

they were made for surgery

they were Mighty to let anyone become a

surgeon and I'll be damned if my son

doesn't deserve a better future than

that of a biker

[Music]

foreign

if it's like

because it constantly

in the morning isn't it that bad

actually

[Music]

okay it is kinda loud

now that I'm possibly

let me just release it a bit

just just a tad bit

[Music]

Okay so

[Music]

that looks like a glass glass cut

and I got something here

[Music]

yeah

they definitely have some

water damaged this place

well that looks like it's classed him

[Music]

growing growing or something

[Music]

yeah definitely yeah I can check with

the camera the camera camera goes

through or not

[Music]

why am I supposed

to scale from here

[Music]

yeah the music definitely is louder in

here

[Music]

we've done on this thing

honeymoon is back finally

[Music]

I'm stuck in a room

[Applause]

[Music]

I'm back again

[Music]

[Music]

finish my fire I have not listening

[Music]

but it's fine by the way I heard the

question about her hair yeah I mean it's

definitely loud though

I mean it's five times before but this

section is definitely balanced

it's like the Audio Level I try to

keep my voice at

so

so I would argue

maybe it's loud

even though I'm not listening to the

Stream

this is for the level I do want you to

keep the audio of games like

[Music]

oh

[Music]

my name is Stones growing through the

wall I mean I know they're not growing

but

a little confused at the moment

I got in here

there's a skeleton that colorful bones

I guess they're

teaching what did developments are

called or something

calling them

or killed it

oh it's the Gap here blind apparently

sorry about my blindness

[Music]

looks like the building has a water leak

yeah there's a slight possible water

damage nothing the cab on the camera

that's what let's see that's what I

think I want to say when it sounds right

water damage

easy to fix

yep just a slight water damage

nothing to worry about

a light switch

after nice

swim around in the dark

oh checkpoints

speaking of dark it was a bit dark okay

[Music]

oh medical box

with medical supplies

and hopefully I don't have to reset so

many times in this level

[Music]

oh

this looks like

another case of

water stairs

oh no

the fish landed behind it

I think I don't die

[Music]

yeah how are tonight's still running and

the water just sorted inside which

circuits lifetime you move okay

[Music]

there we go

I'll see a piece of bread

oh no the fish missed

not me I need an excited correctly what

is the fish missing wow that must be too

far

back in here

I think the fish got stuck

why did the design never like this

the children may have considered this

[Music]

you would be able to fall behind and get

stuck

[Music]

yep the fish is definitely stuck

[Music]

yeah finish this stuck oh yeah I guess I

have to resetting well great level

design

I think you're the fish a break his

brain damage do you want me to break the

piece

hit its heads on trucks too many times

definitely

yeah it's not really

in its best condition

[Music]

there we go

[Music]

oh yeah we did it all right so she was

going to fall down

oh again

sometimes the jumps just aren't High

Enough

they're really really sink

because

because that's obviously what you're

supposed to do like

jump across

thank you

okay sure I jumped you around today that

that came here but the second box is so

small now you're supposed to do

yeah yeah

[Music]

that was never going to work

[Music]

no don't okay at least you got down this

time you can't play anything you can get

stuck there it's almost like they have

planned that you should be able to get

killed down the line

Casey in case you miss but

[Music]

as apparently that's reliable

[Music]

[Applause]

thank you I'm fine

[Music]

the benefits is soft and Squishy it

doesn't stick that way it's fine

[Music]

well

[Music]

come on

[Music]

foreign

after a few more tests it would seem Dr

Robert's New Blood formula might be the

reason for their rise in intelligence

incredibly short-sighted but if I can

get some of Bob's blood within range of

a bomb its reaction will be a dead

giveaway my son will still get the

chance to

victory

left hand straight into one

so this video was flooded long enough

again for plans to grow out of the floor

but there is still nice line the ice

boxes yeah

it's really really nice

you should definitely divide the ice

boxes from this company

[Music]

different

plastic shapes like ice lining whatever

you would call it

[Music]

that's the time I'll use now

come on there we go

and one more

nope

rain trying here

very good isolation to keep eyes for so

long even finally hit this up

and yeah that that's true

[Music]

thank you

whoops grab the controlling

hey what happened

foreign

well I guess you have to do a minus one

on the number of resets then

because that was that wasn't me

[Music]

I think the large caps and then I'm

gonna resets

once

affect your results but yeah it should

be a minus one at least

and there is above and this above

melting point Washington

yeah [ __ ]

[Music]

the water must be covered there

[Music]

no no you could almost make it into the

next box

it needs the first Box come on jump down

in the water

you jump in the wrong way please

there you go you're almost dying there

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

yes

yes no

[Music]

and again

[Music]

and there we go

another way to get getting into this box

immediately

[Music]

oh my jumps are not high enough

at the bottom of that thing

right sure

I'm not an expert at fish flying but

[Music]

they don't live much removed

perfect

[Music]

a couple of their fish campaigns but not

the entire game

I guess I have completed the

goldfish one

this is going to take a while

because it's almost like it's starting

like more and more the more empty

yeah this Canon game without me to get

into

[Music]

oh right into the metal pole are you on

PC straight drop is I mean everything is

low except

pictures which is on high because even

lower detection starts lagging more

yeah I can't do anything quality more

[Music]

yeah

I think give me some money

[Music]

strengths

first thing I I'd go foreign

[Music]

and developer comments

making them up as I'm playing the game

this game is not made for low end

computers we're not even going to allow

you to be completely insane with shadows

nice jump there it was Louis jump baby

[Music]

oh now we got stuck again

I got three

kids

[Music]

so close

that is a positive option to like

override each other because there are

shadows which comes in on the fish

and I don't really need those Snapchats

they are not helping me

[Music]

so I'm starting to guess now it's very

smart ones but not this

nope

and the biggest biggest problem I have

is that as soon as I get out of the

water being relaxed

[Music]

nothing for the message

or whatever is called

so yeah

[Music]

a bit of struggle this

[Music]

go go

[Music]

yum

[Music]

these were just a little deeper

I didn't get enough I do this almost so

shock this

[Music]

there we go finally

[Music]

[Applause]

so

I at least you can reset it now

come on this shouldn't be maybe a hard

jump

[Music]

[Music]

okay

[Music]

there you go that's what I wanted

[Music]

there we go let's continue

don't keep the bread of course not of

course not

why would I get to keep to bed

I'd like to pick up the bread a few

times when I go back

but

you know a few times until I get more

like this

in that sounded like nothing

no no for some reason

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

so

and then he's going back to my name

I seem

[Music]

well first try

where to now

[Music]

um

I'm not glass window

I mean I guess I'm supposed to go

through that but

it looks like it's

window

wise man

I see

[Music]

but I said I might need like yeah

[Music]

a cooling platform underneath the

computer I'm not sure where whatever

even would find such a thing

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

that's easy jumps oh come on now

[Music]

well I guess I fail to pick up the

bedroom

[Music]

well where did that Speed come from

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

goodbye pets

yeah

[Music]

[Music]

[Applause]

well I mean if it's if it's 51 now it

needs to be 15 now because I need to

minus one but

oh that wasn't bad right

yeah at this point it's like

I didn't expect it's like

[Music]

yes

um

yeah

yeah

[Music]

there's no no bets anymore now all rats

are off

at this point I mean yeah yeah I would

like three seven more than 50 times now

it's really

yeah

because I can't have to include the the

part for the game runs enough

and there we go that's it like

want to try it which was the first event

um

another one of these skeletons

many attempts later

[Music]

oh yeah he did it

so in something that's easy to navigate

even though it shouldn't be

[Music]

answer was right in front of me this

whole time

I took some of Bob's blood and added it

to a batch of bread at my bakery Ash

predicted were brought near a bomb it

practically came alive

he'll tell me for sure

box made for surgery I can track them

all down

now the technique is not perfect a loaf

of bread seem to have its animalistic

Tendencies persist even after no bulbs

were around so I must get around to

fixing that otherwise things could get

very much out of hand

this is an interesting story

hey that's reference to iron breads the

other dev's game yeah

Entertainer

[Music]

maybe transparency

every one of those MacBook is always

coming

conveniently with with water clean after

a fish to survive His Wish fishes seems

to survive even in Dark Water dirty

water

oh that doesn't look good

[Music]

I'm gonna just jump out of this it

doesn't sometimes you jump

this is how he's Young

[Music]

the game like no I said he's jumped out

twice

[Music]

so I guess I should go back now

[Music]

it's a good attempt fish

I should have put it in the corner

[Music]

there you go

[Music]

reference to I am bread and also oh

Chevrolet FDA

uh

I don't know because this would be uh

the

what's taking place

[Music]

they call it here

all these letter abbreviations that

people use there we go

quantitative response then

yeah it was at the end there

the game did not make it easy

[Music]

but my bread I was supposed to get one

a shielding discovery

well I guess I guess it wasn't more than

15 then

or 27 response

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

when

how about no

unless you want he wants like more

because most of them were in fish tests

I mean

I mean if you really wanted me to like

climb up the whole scene over and over

again

that's what you're saying

one see if the game wasn't stuck me so

much

[Music]

best case I could probably do that yeah

[Music]

it's fine though I don't know what it is

definitely like now

[Music]

it went there

foreign sometimes

whoa

take flights

and the thing this is specifically

recessed exactly

exactly he did the rules was

um clearly outlined

okay I wish I wish there was an option

to like add the

prescriptions to post

and apparently got stories

completely

do you like things

but I mean let's do demonstrate play

spiral trying to set up spiral

but there's a new prediction now for

everyone who wants to partake in the

prediction

for now we're going to the airport

I don't think this one counts

I I won't count that one that's just a

game being glitchy

that's not supposed to happen

this doesn't look like an airport

Airport

they all have doors that you can just

push open

how about that nice

okay let's see

you're twisted like

damn I should go into the fan slicing up

the fish

maybe I can reach the fan anyway

give it a try

[Music]

there we go

that was a nice

spam there when fish got

hit by the fan Bladers

and yes

I read it

serious resets so far because the first

one you knocked down

oh my dislikes this is the laggiest

level so far okay we gave me like it's

laggy and lag yes as I progress

okay I'm supposed to go there

I guess I'll just try to fly there

I'm protecting that

okay I couldn't even fly because when I

I didn't even get any frames

as soon as he left the water

this is going to be a tough level

finish a little bit fries Brands can't

be done further at this point

on the

fan

oh there's some birthday Waits I was

supposed to get that

okay it must be sunrise that causing so

many lying or something but there's no

option to disable all these effects

is the most annoying part

like I don't need I don't need bloom

I don't need water reflection I don't

need Shadows they don't add anything to

the gameplay they take away from you

think about it makes playing I didn't I

don't need water splashing can I disable

all these things

let's have a smooth [ __ ] play please

game

been there

I assume this is not the way I should go

unless the game is so long I can play

yeah I think this is the point where I'm

not going to play it now

now this is done

this is going

now I'm going to name

way too laggy okay yeah I gave I gave

this game I did not the second try

with the new graphic card it still

doesn't work

still doesn't work

did

my best and also I never changed from

the swimsuit but I guess this means it

was a fitness team for me so I can't run

the spider game I can't find a fish game

well um

yeah it has to be with Sunrise effects

the server for explore experience it's

not your fault you don't have to be

sorry

I'm used to it

it is what it is
