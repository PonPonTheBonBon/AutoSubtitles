let me switch there we
go unival interactive Studios is
everything working oh l
so very Qui game so
far is it just me or is
it there we
go let me now is it seem be quiet that
know
let me know if I should had just the so
this is the so far the only game that
I'm yet to complete and still annoys me
still annoys me that I haven't
completed and this is the last level
before the final BS
down
and one
day
yeah this is just the warm
up and just just maybe I should have the
game at
the
shoo try to get
some oh
yeah I can't do
that oh that's not
SHO
yeah I'm doing not
doing that moves around so
much it's going
right trying to look up a good ways
doing this and you basically have to
keep the timer
at 50
throughout and I'm clearly not doing
that oh
yeah
[Music]
so
well
[Music]
I guess I'm not the Pro
Gamer
sometimes feel
like didn't even get to the BS wait
didn't I press try again or maybe it's
yeah it does no not normal why did it go
back to
[Music]
normal oh oh my I've even tried cheating
and not even with cheats
was as in using like save states and
stuff I can't let this this single
game defeat
[Music]
me
it's a simple to this
fire they should remake the game but
instead of giving plus one per timer if
they give plus two it might wor than
one
how much health does that thing
have I was shooting
thing
I missed I miss terrible at
this that's the problem it just
don't I'm missing too much I'm taking
too
[Music]
long
[Music]
[Music]
two man at the same
time he should be more more consistent
with try
that here's the
post why you
T it's a torture to to not have this
level
completed I cannot accept having this
level
uncompleted I I cannot
accept why does my headphone cable
always get stuck on how do it manage to
do I I'm trying to move the C get
stuck I wasting stuff
here
ah I'm sitting in my bedroom
now instead don't really have a proper
place
to but stuff it's working but so it's
less equ and good
luck I need more than a good luck I need
I don't know what I
need
realistic
luck come
on hey
mov that
move it's mve of
randomly me off
[Music]
guard okay this is
better I don't like
those yep don't like those patters
[Music]
do many at same
time
[Music]
no CU I saw some good things that just
disappeared without giving me
anything
W change
direction I
mean I didn't know I don't
know
yeah you know how what the satisfaction
it will be when I find defeat
this where's the gold
ones where's no
gold
missing
him hey I wasn't even prepared
for oh
my okay now I only send this t ones that
I just
can't un
that's I think the Rings are the worst
because it takes more than one second go
from one ring to another but you only
get one
[Music]
second
[Music]
let
[Music]
PL okay if they are far away they don't
seem to make a
noise
it seems to still give you a
second something Mo
doing why is the game like
this why
why
I think I said
it can
I he still
like hello
P where's the
wait where can't I
find
um no I'm very
confus
okay
and
I don't
know I mean I have more games I haven't
completed yet I could switch out
to watching myself more with
those at least I'm not
frustrated
just me me doing the usual challenges
I'm enable
to
I like to
do challenges that are really
hard oh no I moved
up such as completing crash one or three
without
dying trying to Do complete SP one
without taking any hits or just
completed this level
normally
[Music]
that's apparently
a very difficult
challenge I'm
[Music]
human let me four of them and lost a
second lost a five
seconds
come
on
oh see
com oh no
Thief
still the
oh I don't feel I feel like so what did
all of these spy planes do to spy what
oh my dress is back what did spyer do
toast the last level and the thing is
you have to complete this level to
complete the game so I can't even say
that it's not it's not that I'm trying
100% game I mean that would be nice
because I Tred to 100% every SP
game but to even complete this game
normally you have you have to complete
this challenge regardless if you do it
100% or not but this is the last thing I
haven't completed yet so after I
complete this I going complete the game
[Music]
100%
there not help that things moves so
quickly and Spyro moves so
slowly
he
[Music]
[Music]
I would like to a yellow
[Music]
plane would like to complete the
challenge without using any
cheap
oh
no
didn't
come
on
close I mean I am so close to do
it I just need to take damage less
often that so
[Music]
closey yeah that does
matter
come
on I got so
much
not the best
friend
this game is dynamic
[Music]
difficulty
but no I didn't pay attention
to two two lefts what this
I don't I don't know what it is the the
last two just just doesn't
disappear I I get it down to two and
then I'm stuck at two I just because
it's the smaller guess is hardest is to
hit as
well it just need like 5 Seconds more or
something and I can do it but it's
just it's just so I can't do
it I mean yeah if I just get a slightly
better this I guess I can do
it I'm always so close every time I do
[Music]
this
hey
like not only when you take hit can no
no longer attack you also lose
time not
get proba really need to Shi more
often because some of these is can plus
light
shots like between
between
[Music]
one like I was thinking that could I use
like rapid fire or something but it
doesn't seem to be an option for
that cuz at least that
would
that would at
least help me a bit I
guess but it doesn't seem to be any
option for rapid fire
so
P I feel like you linger too much on
targets you shoot and keep shoot to the
Target changing I mean you're
right you are
[Music]
right
okay these is going Camp
them
[Music]
[Music]
oh don't like
those
[Music]
he
[Applause]
[Music]
is of course that Spyro shoots so slowly
I mean this is quick but compared
to he moves only shoot
the
there
my if you count all this
sh you need to inst a
few what I need is is there even a rapid
fire option why wouldn't it be a rapid
fire
is it shating I don't
know I just got find a second
point
and for some reason I find I find a lot
of I guess there
not not looking fast forward we looking
for Rapid Fire completely different
thing fast forward would not help me in
this
situation actually I think I've heard
that
[Music]
kind
cuz like I do want to move over the
targets
but problem with that is due to the low
fire rate I can pass over the whole
Target and not find
[Music]
[Music]
toward
yeah that was pretty
d
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
make sure I could not rabbit fire and
then shoot when I pass over Target to I
mean that could
work say three but it's more like
4 shoot
why am I so bad at the
boss even though I had more time I did
worse
can I
like I said I Set set set set it up to
be able to do
like
what how do that
work
on okay here we
go I
guess oh I see I
see I see what okay okay now I see what
I'm
doing okay let's uh
[Music]
start here be too creedy what creedy
oh that's not what I
wanted that's not what I
wanted
there we again does it work
now thank
[Music]
you
[Music]
come
[Music]
on you like to ret try this ret try and
ret try
I don't feel like going for the side is
a good idea at to
start can get any idea of how I should
do
[Music]
this all right see
[Music]
MO
[Music]
St
yes I'm still going to
fail I'm just going to
practice I mean I I don't like using
safe states and
[Music]
no moving completely
wrong
[Music]
I spot one game design man in this that
is kind of fail of design on the second
part they use same model for last one
they really should have given a slight
color varation different so it could the
more yes definitely
I mean I'd say this game has more than
that sign floor the game is the
same it's an nice symetric game where
you can of hand the how up
something an isometric game it can't
tell the height of something I'd say
that's
i' say that's
same going to
find
time from Boss
B why is there a boss batt in a speedway
any feel the longer time I have to
defeat the SC the longer it takes to
defeat
ni safe is the only only way I
can
think the game sign that same
stes nice old way of making games hard
enough that you show 100
supp
yep
I'll complete this game with sa States
and then I'll I'll just Mar
I use the same state
on
Final I not F doing this in a sing
run
so even even though start 54 seconds I
just found
de and that's a long
time appar save I didn't need sa
acent I guess I have just
start
are get tired
moment
on
only
head now I think I confirmed that before
sometimes it feels like I can move
e how how much that
like
it's hard to determine
dep even if the game wasn't 3 it would
be very hard
toer okay I did it with save
states and it took 50 seconds to defeat
the
boss y um
the
16 now let's just see if I can do
it yeah
know
do it without using save states
because just to prove that I can
be because now I got a lot of PR on the
boss I miss
[Music]
that
[Music]
you shoot it down
same wait don't move away when I shoot
it oh you didn't have to send that
one no I missed the first
one for
[Music]
spr
can stay
your yay I defeated the boss with help
of saes the throwing up
my you do know that
um guess like and the underwear is not
uh like an outfit like the rest it's
only
it it overrides the display of whatever
outfit is
currently doing so
bad so the regular outfit redeems aren
working as normal in the background it
just doesn't
show so you could
technically yeah this isn't going and
I'm not going to defeat it I mean I can
try
but
so yeah so if if Fon in the dress you
can redeem underwear and then you can
redeem an outfit that means that when
the underwear is over you come back in
at the close we come back
at
no I don't want to try
again I can't do it without safe States
I could do it with safe Stakes it's at
least
something it's at least
something now I need to find where the
portal in were
least it this okay let's do some more
well my my good looks are the only thing
more precious to me than gem so I'll
return them but I want you to you know

apparently he's is well I guess
Invincible six
times right before it becomes
Invincible with the right timing that
you can do it and I did it twice in a
