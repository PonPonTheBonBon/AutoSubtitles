let's go let's

welcome here another fun fun stream

please

[Music]

but a lot of

pump and abundant and

hello Robin

how are you today well

still had trouble sleeping but I got

more sleep I think

so that's good I think

let's um

adjust the size of the window because it

always resets because why not

because

look at this

[Music]

I still have I still need to find

something I need to come up with

something about the thing because I

don't like your lips but it's like

not terrible I guess but

yeah prefer over yeah

yeah I guess I guess that rugby would

just be a reference to being repeat

that doesn't like

yeah I prefer over Bonbon even though

Bonbon is still kinda

more specific to me anyway because it's

not funny

that kiss

it's a name accused

I'm

I'm just talking about random stuff here

that kind of kind of my stream

so that's it for today all right I'm

making licking Pizza okay I don't even

know how I would I would even do it

anymore like an eating emails that you

could put next to another image

anyway so today I will add the pattern

to this black suit like a couple hits

it's honest a few things so it's not

much much to do and then I was planning

on actually testing this power up in the

game I will not test out the powerapps

because you actually have to go and

unlock them yes so and this one I should

already have access to in the game

so that's why I'm going to test it

but yeah not the other outfits and I

will just assume they will be working

I guess that's that's the uh

he's going to be the trickiest part of

this this mod that

I I don't have my I have played through

the game before but I don't have to say

fun anymore

well it's on the other computer and I

could actually go and get it but

but it's

assume it will be working

what's the worst that can happen

and today I'm playing completely new

music and stream I think I said yeah

you can

um

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

foreign

suggested using

different source for music

I I really only want music that I can

include on the votes afterwards which is

the case for

the two the two sources I'm using at the

moment

anyway I still have

uh 1.4 meters of sausage life I've got

plenty to eat

yeah I ran out of Pancakes

that's the worst that could happen

there's a gonna be a nice voice I've

seen before we even and

hopefully there's not an end to you

so

you will leave it forever

you will never please take this

the whole wide

uh yeah I wish I had two screens and you

have two screens but if I plug in the

other screen screen it just doesn't work

properly

so I wish I had two skins so here's the

picture

here's my

baked texture from cocoa which is why it

looks so weird

[Music]

that's what I only covered at the moment

are these parts

[Music]

so let me quickly

gather the UV mapping

I don't have any system that

automatically switches between three I'm

using and as they realized I haven't

named will be here

uh Piggy

there you go now I can see what I'm

seeing all right and it's almost about

there we go

now I can see what do you see

that one here they are

so I would export this with export you

layout

or pop that doesn't show up on the

stream which might be when you know

privacy stuff and

perfect stuff

and then when is the switches that means

it done

it takes a bit for you to export again

that's it

I usually say say them before doing

anything dangerous so it's just a matter

of statistics

I guess

I'll text you so much to me I yeah I can

understand that I mean this

this is

this is something

so

if you're not you're not the only one

you find them where the key

anyway

because they are so dark yeah now they

respond

so here are the person I need to focus

on

so

I guess I'll

I don't know where I will start

okay

I'll use this

copy this off that

and only have this

as a picture like that

are now saying this as a shirt for the

body

on as a reference

and then if I go to

right click close on the stream and

visit usme before I close it so I could

and not close it

that would have been awkward

anyway

so now I've been uh in Europe here and

now I can look at this as my reference

yeah there's any picture of the other

part I consider if I shouldn't move this

but now it makes sense that they are

located in this position

this position

this position is where they are on Coco

it's fine

yeah but now I can look at this

like that and as a reference then I'll

switch to this and back to the texture

but that won't show up on screen because

I have to manually switch which used

shown on stream

because that's just how it worked

[Music]

it's not it's not oh yeah yeah

it's not like I'm planning on it yeah I

hope not looking electricity I see

yeah

good goodness watch where should I

enable the other outfit you know the

special one

because it's a art streaming yes

I have tested like

having it and not having it I don't know

special about you and

everything else because I started on the

way because the special outfit is

underway if that's to

to risque for

a stream

if I mean even pun pun in underwear is

still more covered than some

models on Twitch

and people

but yeah

so for this I will basically just give

it shapes I guess

it's so lovely

so this should be the front this is the

chest

whenever you get away with me nothing at

all right I mean technically and foreign

at the moment

the the clothes are just lay it on top

of Pom-Pom

so I could technically

just disable the clothes falling I won't

do that because that's not

nothing I am

interested in this okay

foreign

ers

[Music]

I recognize that

[Music]

so there you go that's a DOT

oh

hello what's up funny welcome

that's exactly the reference I was

seeking stuff

hi thank you well it's nice to see what

that bunny

oh

switch back here well it's nice to see

every one of you

[Music]

hello

how are you I'm feeling much better now

than what bunnies here

oh I'm listening here

[Music]

okay but yeah I was very busy yesterday

yeah you're very very busy making a lot

of stuff

Mr holdstream

[Music]

but it must be like

making these sounds for 10 years

we don't make this

and maybe I should make this as shapes

instead

[Music]

the benefits of the shapes

is that I can change the shape

afterwards oops like it was okay

now I want

oh my

like

I don't know I want to show something on

the string but this cursor is definitely

on top of this marking but haircut

movies

I can go quite far down this this is

like more than halfway down like

thing

but here I have to move it a strange

Mission scene

I need to make it like that

sometimes developers has changed ideas

can I

like that

I like that

when I was here for the first quarter of

the stream yeah yeah all right so so

long as I was doing for one that I was

doing for seven hours actually

six hours study still one hour and a

half an hour

one and a half hours

Franklin

we left early a bit maybe

[Music]

[Music]

but then I had to go to the store and

buy a bunch of pork in order to make

sausages

poor kid says that was hard to see

porkages

so if I make it like that

same

and now

taking a look so I'm back to planning

so this is the old one of the update

this is nearer

I mean it's a bit wobbly because of

their own

it's actually not being straight

but sadly this now

but for here

there's no smooth there's a proportional

editing but that's a different thing and

the original smooth suction for some

reason

foreign

spicy

[Music]

but only to a certain degree

laughs

my friend didn't died

your eyes a bit better now

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

looking this one is a bit wide now

that I can adjust

easily

what companies

near

[Music]

like that's my dude

[Music]

so let's see

[Music]

that wrong

I mean if you look at from a distance

it's fine

I can

make it

tomorrow there is one

you have that next

there

is your first shut corn

[Music]

ER of our fleship I do like spices

depends on what I'm eating

for extreme spice because it's too beer

but it's Chili Peppers if you want to

add some more spice while eating

retraining the flavor of the fruits

right here

I mean maybe you're right about that

[Music]

oops no just one step too much

same this and see how it like some

animal

that's better I think

I said this one is too much one

[Music]

so I can't see any slime I have to save

the file I'm going to make sense

take out as much shade

this one has a bit of a wrong shape got

too much about that I mean I can't try

to

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

yeah and

I normally use write it like that but

I mean

it can implies

then the Meat part

so

[Music]

anyway moving on to the next part which

I guess I'll do

the D standing

might be too tricky at home

that would make those stats and that

part and that part okay yes it's wrapped

around

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

like that

foreign

thank you for stopping by

I do appreciate that

yeah

a nice

it has been nice seeing you

around

I don't know I was sick

I mean

yeah it's been it's been fun and it made

me feel better too so that's

and this one goes on the other side

like that

changer and there's no add option

so sometimes there's no add option

I prefer not having a slave for

everything

hmm

grab it

rabbit rabbit

repeat repeat

foreign

but it does not work

because the fair rabbit does not amuse

foreign

thank you

foreign

[Music]

okay and then there's trying to make the

fair average react which is to Stubborn

I kiss

is the word

yeah I guess stubborn would be

it's it's almost like the fair rabbit is

just a pharaoh rabbit

all right

and it's not entertained by

an answer rabbit

in English

[Music]

there we go there's some smart parts

foreign

see how it goes

okay do you want to do it no

do you want noodles no

maybe maybe different rabbit once

she reminds me active someone picked her

up I had a rabbit when I was kid and

they would kick and scratch it would be

tread on them

a rabbit

but that we didn't

mind being picked up I guess as long as

game it's

okay thank you but

I wasn't always hiding

it was a very shy bunny

[Music]

[Music]

good

and now I'm adjusting each dot so now

they're a good thing

foreign

I think this start is not located in the

middle but I guess it doesn't do that I

can check

no it's not located in the middle

and then yes this is corrected

now you just need to adjust the

shape of it

and upside down

foreign

I guess

I guess it is

[Music]

but it's one thing missing

and that is the line okay

[Music]

moment

[Music]

so I don't can share it on screen

in just a moment

again I copied it over and let's see how

it looks now seeming

for my tattoo

with small adjustment but hopefully a

lot here we go no it works perfect

[Music]

it is

perfect

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

oh oh

I shall ask you time

let me first

that's

sing

sorry to join Let It Go

10 10 ways

yeah this sack is way too white

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

well

[Music]

foreign

do you think

we call it HF for horizontal of me I see

with via for vertical flip

[Music]

food okay

and I'm just messing around a little bit

so this one

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

something's coming down series

21 pixels

excuse me

that is very odds but

saying some sugar to your everything

heavy doesn't care

after it's interior

she may be reminded about them

no problem

that's an easy fix at least

do it very quickly here

and sometimes I just want to do a very

quick edit the texture I don't want to

switch back my voice back sometimes my

quick ends are it's monkey a bit

um

Maybe

snack anymore

[Music]

librarian hello hydration I can do that

nothing

[Music]

I'm deleting my app only use

[Music]

there we go

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

so let's attached that one let's see if

I can

attach this is probably another question

I'm here

[Music]

thank you

nowadays that I

[Music]

get very close

this is exclusive

so

[Music]

definitely

looks uneven that's

and that's just how it should be I guess

we're going to take the constructed here

oh

oh

didn't align that for me

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

wow cool you can turn into different

colors

I can't do that

such an amazing Community but certainly

will come in handy

[Music]

[Music]

thank you I need to find the

am I supposed to be impressed

okay

[Music]

and then I don't expect it to be

impressed I just want you to say

thank you

perfect

and then this will barely show up in the

game anime because it's a pumpkin

thank you

I mean then they start other spots there

is a bit too stretch out

and see if I can adjust that one

there you go

still a bit stretched out

feet

s

okay that's better that's definitely

very

I think it explains

he'll feature disagree

and that's yeah I'm doing you

send it to be stretched out

perfect

nice and spicy chips to eat you mean

like in real life or

as a joke

some spicy computer chips

near in real life

maybe they had some

chips with

not too long again

but just a small badge

and it's too quickly

typically me

[Music]

in this line might need to be a little

bit

in their way

[Music]

[Music]

I did not alert me about the overcoming

and it just

it's a plane now

[Music]

good luck everyone

okay let's see

but this starts looks a bit too large

so

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

if you're only that should look evenly

sized

most people wouldn't even care about

such details but but even if even if

someone can't really point out what

looks odds some of the certain age

that makes sense okay let's see

it's one of your strength is once you're

in large

thank you yes they did

I'd say this is much better

it is really nice

okay I'll say those are good and I

believe that

so let's move over to the next thing I

should end

so update back to this and what I would

do I also cook us things girls there and

these guys here but I think it's fine

I think it is fine okay so I would hide

this and see what's going on behind and

that'll be doing the game

but they are actually probably decent

just goes down here and then as far as I

know these parts cut out some okay but

I don't know what's going on here

or what like where I got that shape from

and what they've gotten from here

underneath the arms

what

maybe a bit of glitchy Graphics but

I said I don't know anyway I'm I was

watching beans since now

where are they they're up here okay but

that shouldn't be a problem

that should be no problem

let's see if I can do it he looks

exposed without the armor

which I guess makes sense

whenever you make this a new

I'm gonna refer back to

you you have a shape like this this

should appear

round-ish

oh I think that participle is just super

cool it doesn't exist on curriculum

like

the chicken cocoa

find on him and that anyway

yeah if we remove this part we just

behold it so that's exactly I think it's

reading from these

and map this there because it try to

find closest thing or something like

that thing

and just gets me in

since it's trying to project the

existing texture onto

or two

it'll be under the breastplate them

exactly I'm not gonna think like that

foreign

[Music]

I think that would be a good way of

doing it

since absolutely

I'm just going to take take a quick look

at

yeah definitely girlfriend because it is

located right now

foreign

but it's more like a face like that

[Music]

okay let's see here let's see how that

thing looks it's an antenna antennae

same

and then more things I will do then is

that it should be a slight shading here

before it goes into the dots and then

the whole scene should have a glow but

that's that's later

yeah that's definitely what it is

that's always different when I'm done

update

oh

no

it does not look I mean Darkly scared

this part is not good

yeah maybe I should just

follow the shape or accurately I'll

treat that

it's a strange shape but

it's strangely saved for everything

[Music]

maybe I can have you have a better

reference

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

and then

like that I guess

so that's step one

[Music]

another

and pumpkin should put on her dress for

a long time again

you like 10 minutes again

oh fun fun you need to put on your dress

sometimes you can't just

go around without your dress on

[Music]

no dress is back oh no

put on the race once again a secret

even though he did see material reminder

thanks and it's definitely not a secret

I should have a camera and then when he

redeemed outfits I'll change my real

life out of it

[Music]

well I well known Secrets oh blush blush

yeah I think otherwise should not be an

option in that case

the camera doesn't really show the full

body anyway so

foreign

so now it has these weird shape

it remained

but the switch shape should make it look

better on them all

I think it's very weird shape

hopefully it looks good enough

this is the old shape and this is new

shape it is

greens

someone better at the same time

foreign

could go through and like just step by

step

so in this case it goes too much in

and move it out slightly as a first step

to see

how much it moves

[Music]

update

yeah yeah yeah that's good

so I'm a little bit more

yeah that's

that's what I want

and then we have this part it feels kind

of like

it's nice in there and down too much

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

but I guess I could like show both teams

at the same thing

so that's very

[Music]

so

[Music]

uh

safer do you like

and let me test this

some

string anything on stream

[Music]

thanks

for the first magic display yeah I don't

like how it places the new

at the top

but oh well

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

this cute girl be quick here a bit

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

now I can edit here

and show the previews here

at the same time

I don't know if this is good or not

so

now it's this part

which is we should be dispatch let's see

if this didn't work

[Music]

which like

there's a bit too much in here so I can

move out slightly

[Music]

but here

instead it goes too much out

to start with that medication

and hopefully it doesn't look as

spiky

date yeah now it's moving here now let's

move back here

you're gonna be fine

so and then I need

to adjust that perch

[Music]

I was like that might do it

[Music]

but it's like

too much

[Music]

I think

[Music]

um

I do think

Maybe

maybe both a reaction

[Music]

but that's nice

no it's not splits 50 but

but yeah

it's it's

more even I guess

now

in this part that is way too high

to more even in the available space to

the left

and like logo blending but yeah

one side is text you got the same

[Music]

oh that was a big too much I think

[Music]

I think this one might need one

no it's not the same if you remember I

think

don't want that to show up

[Music]

now

trying to explain it that way

[Music]

it's definitely uh

[Music]

lying across like Beats

[Music]

so

as can be seen here it's smooth too far

down

you found it up

under the compensate point

some of this will be hidden behind

[Music]

there you go that's that's more like it

[Music]

once again I'm doing cute why not what

will it be hopefully nothing

that will make it awesome

this has been a topic for a phds now

hydrates yes I can also take a drink

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

up anyway but not everything so

they want it to be good

before coming up

so this part

we should be this part here

isn't perfect delivery

and a bit too much in him

[Music]

is back from Olympic range

or maybe there was no drink

[Music]

they're here that's more lucky

that's more like it

and then just a slight adjustment here

foreign

okay

never enough

foreign

[Music]

there we go

oh no

it is not perfectly aligned

oh that's a bit annoying

[Music]

let's switch back to normal enemy for

now

what's up

foreign

[Music]

just make sure that these are aligned

properly

stay tuned Lots

a lot of them do but not Amazon

since summer vacation this week I'm

taking a break from cooking while I'm

still have stuff to cook it's just sort

of labor intensive

there I mean

if I were to take a break from cooking I

wouldn't have anything to eat

I guess we live in different situations

which is the whole topic too which I

think of some weird like

because first off there's this

um

hair type that cooking is for women only

but that that really makes me wonder

and there are some men who didn't have

this attitude which is have an attitude

really makes me think when this man

go and live alone maybe they never do

that maybe that's the tricky uh who's

going to make food for them but again

going to restaurants and fast food

places every day

I also read a YouTube comment from some

one claimed to be a woman

I would assume that please and she said

that you're a woman her her mother

told her that she should learn to

cook to impress a man

and then she said that she knows how to

cook now

but she has not

gotten a founder even a boyfriend yet

so that was a waste of time but like

what no you can cook your own food

like

who is going to cook your food it's

still a good thing to know even if it's

not too impressed or not on a man

we've had like you're going to cook for

yourself right

and I found the whole

[Music]

normally the stuff I make requires you

to actually obtain the stove an entire

time starting in Philippines at this

studies this is a seat definition yeah

yeah kind of kind of

[Music]

and yeah it's it's just a singer I think

I noticed I'm keeping around there that

people just seem to think

cooking as some

skill that

most people don't know or something like

that

I don't know

[Music]

it's weird

taking cooking like it is

fixing a car or something

good thing to know but that means like

fixing cars a bit

different because you don't have to do

that every day most people don't believe

[Music]

so

maybe I know at work say they do not

know how to cook and are only surprised

that I do know how to yeah is that like

[Music]

that's so strange to me who's who's

again I mean maybe they have

living

with maybe they do

assuming they are all men and living

with women who cooks for them maybe I

don't know maybe that's how they get

around

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

what do you know how to cook yeah I also

know how to cook is the toilet

[Music]

and sleep in a bed

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

and brush my teeth

and strengthening it more everyday stuff

that

there we go there's on both sides and it

should be identical

by then tickle

there we go

Focus

do you know how to use a toilet I never

learned how I mean to be fair it is

probably people don't know how they just

they just give it to their paste

actually honestly there's probably a lot

of things you do every day like like

using the toilet and brushing your teeth

and taking a shower and stuff and there

are like

proper efficient ways of doing certain

steps in the in each of those that

aren't really thoughts you use years to

supposed to discourage yourself or

something

I mean who's going to teach you how to

like properly

I mean I guess I guess your parents

teach you how to use the toilet but

that's when you're very young and you

might not

remember all the details and stuff and

then you try and then base basically

self-discovery

okay

[Music]

sounds about right

that's

it's the easiest method

[Music]

so am I doing one of those that one I'm

not no sorry sorry

and back right here so I made all of

these

which I don't it's a bit hard to see but

yeah some ideas

that was bought in blue here this one is

covered by the armor and something's

supposed to be there

the the ones remaining are these now

so I guess I'll start with these because

these are

on the arm

annoyingly one of them is just right the

edge in a clip

instead but I could I could like move it

up slightly so it doesn't do that

move it up up

[Music]

it was and they said dates

yeah

the hand is supposed to be a bit

purplish but the ingredients and have

them

go over to the next right it's very

tricky

having solid colors Crossing two

different seams is much easier

but having radius does make it look

noisy

so

if that's uh the earrings it doesn't

look as like

solid and

boring I just

[Music]

so yeah it's every song that plays today

it's a completely new song I have not

played on stream before

in the next uh next week

was afternoon Sunday I'll go I will add

mix this song with all the previous

songs we get

old memorable songs and

because I've played it so many times

mix with

lesser songs

listen to these songs on your own

foreign

[Music]

yesterday

or or something like

I want yochi but that's weird

thank you

[Music]

oh and that's that

[Music]

kind of difference and now export this

to the mesh

and let's see how it is

okay how about

I put this moments split me

suit from

[Music]

you can't split this off like this I

call this one

suits iconic bodysuit so it's some group

with it

and then I can try to cry that maybe

showing another things and showing here

anyway now I can be here without the

ears getting in the way

so well it doesn't look that bad but

it's time for adjustments so let's go go

over to

foreign

the first off

these are the upper ones of this one

is so off

must be this one

[Music]

and then

okay let's see

how this looks

come on there we go

and

I certain state

I often indentative with The Apprentice

yeah this computer really gets hot

tomorrow

it is working

anyway and let's see that's it

there we go

thank you

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

is

I think this one is the normalized I

don't remember what if the other suits

have this as well

and if they do have I hope they were in

similar locations but you know at least

one of it does not fit

thank you

and you want to make it a bit smaller

spread apart because the

it's very short

yes it looks a bit nine seconds

[Music]

but

and let's see

if this is what I'm looking for

yes so much better number four

I like this because

the arms are mirrored so they would

be the same on both sides now let's see

if I can do it makes

something it's clipping here

but this one has to be

made narrower anyway so

[Music]

hope it's gonna look really cool

I'm happy since it is of course

based on the original artifices

from the games it's not an original

outfit paint might be

[Music]

but

I do appreciate that you still think

that I am able to

make it to look good

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

not much Nancy

[Music]

rotating this circle

[Music]

[Music]

yeah anyway

slowly getting there

thank you

yeah yeah

I think that's good

I think that's pretty good

maybe I'll squeeze it a bit a bit more

together

yeah yeah

that's good

[Music]

[Music]

so

with that done

[Music]

thank you

let's switch back and single me again

it's only the legs left and hopefully

those are quick to make

drop back to regular stuff

preview previously

and the legs are separate on this and

normally the legs are the same but since

the legs have different patterns on them

I need to separate them

now we'll be done for this outfit

making this outfit a bit more special

than me the other

I'm still here

well

[Music]

hello still here nice to see you

[Music]

so yeah so I'll just do this

dot line dot line dot line dot nine

nothing lines

[Music]

that's step one

step one dots the lights

I see

nice to see you too

[Music]

nice to see you three

[Music]

step one network on dots and now this

one is

um let me just I'll check on the mesh

my waist

oh

the other part is here

well we'll see if I need it after

squishing it together

[Music]

since this often needs to be changed

there shouldn't be an apartment

hopefully

oh oh

[Music]

this is whatever comes in here just

makes me

oh what the

eleven

oh oh

what if I can do your stream in this

Stone your suit

I'm going to start your name

okay still wait still waiting on that

routine

we'll lose the air so the idea what to

for me to expand the most outfit options

but there is the other idea of of

Affair you

creating

the outfits

by choosing which

tops and bottoms pumping everywhere

of course yeah so you can't like

research today a main stress it will

just replace hers

without my stress but then if you're

wearing like this wash brown skirt you

can replace the skirt with like

shorts if you want

when

we'll read The View SUNY new model

another model already wait when since

when did Potter

that was the

2D model I mean

3D model

depending on like different situations

sometimes next months

exciting

I will probably

miss it because it's too nice

but I

if you just let me know

when you start streaming you can only

send me a message about that

and I'll try to

show up maybe

but it depends on what it is

yeah a few Lessons Learned oh oh I see

it's a little bit over here

Okay so

I mean I guess that's kinda

I mean reason for like a whole model

design

yes

[Music]

[Music]

current model

the current model is too cute he wants

something

more

[Music]

what what is the way to adorable

because he wants to be a tough bunny

but everyone thinks he's a sweet sweet

thing soft bunny

people think you're hot dog uh yeah

um

that's

right yeah

I mean

I guess I guess what is a bit dark like

I don't know

[Music]

even with the name water bunny because

the name like what the bunny he's stuck

yeah what what kind of bunny this is a

dog

obviously

it's the nose yeah I think I think

analysis

I could see I need to look at what bunny

again

for that

oh there we go please

[Music]

do we have your model on Twitch like

about the pages though oh yeah we got

one picture

but not that it wasn't that bad page

that was new to me

and

now you don't have your

model on

but you have a low quality and increase

quantity

there we go

don't really distracted

me I'm almost distracted by something

okay

um

I want which

there you go

okay let's start taking

and then I will

save these guys

what the bunny

that's not how you spell water bunny

I spelled it with an agent bunny with

one in

that's how we spending with the bunny

right

so

I need to make sure

interior no I said what about this thing

oh this airplane

I think you are what good thing is

giving the wings oh absence do you see

the water teasing knees

is taking away

I mean I guess

yeah I guess I can't I guess I you could

say that thing else is dog-like because

that's not what a bunny nurse looks like

but I mean if you look at ponpon that's

not a funny nose anyway and there is

some similarities I guess between

I don't see it down when you know it's a

rabbit

I mean if you if you're coming to the

stream no idea who what that bunny is

and then you look at I think I think

maybe maybe it's like the nose and ears

together I'm trying to point the screen

I can't do that because I don't hear now

I had a point thing so again this you

got the nose and the way the ears are

kind of on the side of the head that's

more

more dog like

I want rabbits more behind but like it

would look at rabbits I surroundings I

think so yeah

I could I I guess those are still I

still think it looks like a bunny you're

a bunny it looks like a bunny people say

stop behind me and

not the kids it's the Earth but

because those attitude qualities that

could yeah it's not a private nose in it

yes yeah yeah

[Music]

I think it rtb The Institute

most people are

I used to banished up and

when I mean one point has them behind

but no one has said that I think no I I

don't think anyone has said that answer

is a dog but in here

the apparel on-pon made for spider

and people have said it's a dog

people also said that feral Pom-Pom

inspired in looks weird for having four

legs and that's a very weird statement

nights

with the what shape of the body but I

guess I guess the face actually is more

more closer closer to what water looks

like than font one

the ears looking almost like they're on

the side of the head

I didn't know I have the else to get in

here

but yeah I do think I do think having

the ears down is good for a model on

stream because otherwise the news will

take up so much of the screen space

[Music]

so now I added all of these two

oh yeah I need to bring out pretty much

anything

let's see what I'm looking at we'll see

about them yeah I can see what I'm

looking at this can't see what's shown

on screen

on

so this just ends here but that's just

because this just goes down to the hand

and this part is covered up

I'll say this for now and then I'll

check out the excitement

and then I'll move over to

to

blend it and look at how it looks then

it's blending

and this is the

um what I

baked from

cocoa cocoa and this is what I know

gender generated which I've drawn

so it's um adjustment like this one

really needs adjustment

the smok the new time

so let's go

and first off let's see what the road

I like you or it's just not seeing

someone's thought I was just a kick

you also gets some more

and you keep it showing up

I haven't had money need people to show

up

so I guess this that year I haven't

gotten as many opportunities for people

to think about donkey

my name is I'm a bunny because it's bon

bon that isn't

people think of

confectioners stuff action

sweets

the only reference to

you

it is combined

that's what it's meant to me

don't worry I'm not I never considered

it to be a dog what a doggy

[Music]

thank you

anyway

[Music]

[Music]

yeah

foreign

water is uh so it's more like a

not exactly scavada

[Music]

but that's the word

again I can show not

it's a Swedish Thing

I hope this one is with the key

anyway oh

download it anyway

and share with us on stream

and

[Music]

why is the picture so big don't fit

[Music]

okay here we go

here's the warning sign for us it is a

rabbit

and what is a very weird rabbit we have

the legs and

black feet

and in years but like

the face the head is very heavily shaped

I'm not sure why

yeah he's doing it yeah he's

our wings so

[Music]

um

but it's more like

it's uh it's a rabbit with bird wings

and a birthday

[Music]

as far as I know you don't have a bird

team

[Music]

I was thinking about making him like

jacking off one of these moments

I think it's

yeah I think

you can't have a

you can't you can have like fake horns

fake antlers on your

feet on your head

[Music]

[Music]

although I guess Pokemon could have it

too like

yeah yeah and

I I outfit for Pon Pond that is

with wings and antlers

maybe it's an outfit with one but that

is based on

Water Valley

wetsuits and wings fake wings of course

[Music]

and I should make the wings so they

actually look like fake treats really

so what the

would you be okay if I made

an outfit for this month it looked like

looking like what about me

not looking like water bunny it will be

it would of course still be

but it will be

The Outfits this suit and

seat suit

s sweet

potato

and so dirt and fake wings

and is there anything else I guess the

tops have hair on that they want the

pumpkin has can be turned black

yes

I guess so piercings too

do that for you

when I need to look at the

look at watermelon again so yeah there

you go

your suit

the whole outfit

then they're like fake Wings in black or

of course you do have a quite Light

Beige so I think it's like it's close

enough to watch I think it'll work fine

but then you have the black hair so if I

just make this part black is that

obviously the same star in the bed

they are real wings no I mean

poor

wore an outfit option for the Pom-Pom

mode

Deputy Point

Define the point was still me because

the

because pump one doesn't have wings so

it's all so it must be fake wings and

in this outfit option so and it should

be clean it will be fun that is clear

that it is fake Wings because it would

be an outfit

when she dies and of course the person

ever said that they have yeah

and then these dark spots and I guess

but probably I said large eyes so I

guess a little tricky to add anyway

it is makeup it can be added

really

good point across that is based on the

water if the outfit and everything

wasn't obvious enough

I think it will be fun but only if

you're okay with it

I didn't want to make an outfit based on

Lolly deal as well

I haven't asked for that yet

I haven't taken my opportunity

but I do want to show

more like

but all the other outfits would be like

uh you know so so

she knows for like

what what is it will be grouped together

[Music]

all right

I just want some movies

there's up

his team is out of me

one more

right

there you go

now that should get rid of

this Gap that is visible here

foreign

[Music]

I'm working on still working on that one

month

doing one of the power up textures like

uh outfits at the moment during the last

parts of it

and when I'm done with this I'm I do

want to test it in game

so now it goes on the way

so how is this start looking

it might need to be a

Tony

[Music]

and then do you see it on a mesh I need

to save it

saving

yes

and they loved it

yeah now the Gap is gone but

do you need that adjust it though

so

position myself

there we go

I'll be doing it panda

I do like pandas

and you have a

Panda plushie of my own

and the first thing I did

I got the panda

with a skirt on my pants

I'm

I'm seeing me

um thank you thanks for asking how about

you I'm I'm feeling better seeing all

this

dirty people

showing up here

but that's that's really nice

foreign

except you

you are really good but you're such a

good you're

you're such a good good bunny here I

have some headbands

it didn't feel about me

that one's pretty brownish

it is pretty and round

made us feel a bit small

measured and large Chestnut

and now let's see

there we go now it looks very

of course then there's this thing here

looks a bit near The Cross

with this line

nothing I

just

saw which direction should go in

towards

everyone

it is maybe two steps how much

does dash machines

I love heart

I I wish I could see more if you stream

smart now but

why is a bit hard

but such is life

there are many streamers I like to see

but they're streaming it

times when I can't watch them

there's a lot of steam I haven't seen in

a way it's also because I'm quite quite

busy busy with streaming myself as well

it's a shame and you you didn't want to

see them

can I show up and like hey they're fun

fun I haven't seen you in a while yeah

it's kind of

can I end something like that sometimes

there you go I think I'm waiting for a

step too much that's one step less

[Music]

[Music]

there you go that's nice

that's very nice

okay I should try to adjust this movie

[Music]

so if I

don't

foreign

[Music]

this works though let's see

oh no too much

five steps wasn't way too much

[Music]

thank you

maybe I should just removed in one step

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

was too much now

when I'm only two steps

and someone just one step now which is

two steps into

yeah it's not perfect but um

I can't move it in like that

oh my remediation no that's a that's a

Stephanie Rarity Nation

the fair pom-poms are coming you seek

shelter

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

will come and

cardinality

yeah I don't think I could be better

than that

[Music]

thank you

as

um

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

all right let's see

this works

[Music]

why is it not

[Music]

okay

what's the difference planning anything

[Music]

other than something

right the difference was very small but

I expect to see something on the

[Music]

yeah okay the difference is really

amazing

[Music]

a pink line and a purple line

my twist

[Music]

are you looking yeah yeah the left skin

is where I'm out of my texture dry skin

is where I look at the texture

and I guess you could call once I think

that's like that one

is based on the shading

ah

yeah I'm trying to do your nose

anointing

so

I would I would say that this thing when

it's not perfect it's a bit more plain

but

do you need perfection

verification

because I'm still standing

anything it

party fun fun in rgbing

oops infp

V texture on

shouldn't have done that

was gone

but it wants them more

and let's see

stretch twitch

back pain

yeah they like this much better

it isn't perfect but it's very good

[Music]

it should take someone easy like it

means

yeah there's more business here makes it

look nice so

[Music]

I assume this is one

American

where did they decide to do that but I

wanted to signature

[Music]

I love it

yeah it's coming

[Music]

but I ain't going to throw it all the

way down anyway because

and pumpkin

honestly

[Music]

and

working on links now I've been working

on this

the police work like the previous

daughter I was I wasn't amazed this is

the only legs yeah

still working on the legs and that

should be the last part

[Music]

maybe it's sideways like that to

compensate

[Music]

I thought you were doing the Pharmacy

Front oh yeah that was before that

yep

and then I'm gonna dab it to the Lakes

there we go so much to eat

since that looks a bit uneven

very sexual mind

[Music]

but I can release it by one step and see

how it looks

that's that's the

first

and it you see how much it affects it

that's good

I'm gonna small man

this Moon

[Music]

someone enlarge it in every direction

but shouldn't this link be an exact copy

of the other one so I shouldn't I be

able to use

the other one is looking the engine that

basically the exact same

[Music]

just watching the selection

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

so

I'm gonna just move this a minute

inverted or anything

thank you

foreign

things and

disable this and now

time to see how it looks

hopefully it's fine hopefully

yeah I need some sugar

give me some sugar

there we go

[Music]

so and

next part I guess I'll try this one

which should be

this one

[Music]

this one is modifying this one is way

too white

[Music]

so I'll scan it down first which does

cause the line to know no longer connect

but

that I can adjust afterwards

[Music]

it's a bit blocked by the chat thank you

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

it is still the

account

outside there shouldn't be any problem I

hope

uh because he's sleeping outside there

man should be able to

add the second one always meets up

yeah yeah that looks fine

it's really very

if there's nothing else anyway

I can just keeps stretching this

that's more likely

[Music]

yeah another show

[Music]

[Music]

like that

eating chicken eating popcorn eating

popcorn which you get on

dish

[Music]

yep

Asian has salt and popcorn but I haven't

had parkour for a long time this burger

looks very young over there

why

is

burn away

I think this Pokemon looks strange in

here

[Music]

those things that don't aren't match up

in

in

media and real life

basically

foreign

foreign

[Music]

I don't think I put any sugar in it

[Music]

I want to have popcorn with

I was going to say mushroom but salt

but what's the difference in mushroom

salted enemy

foreign

mushroom

oh yeah that one off

quite that beat

the mushroom and salt maybe mushroom and

salt will work together

about those mushrooms again so it's not

lots of

so I guess

so I could imagine mushroom and salt

making

it on on top

a coin I wish

I meant the sea salt but I accidentally

see mushroom but what's the difference

between salt and mushroom

everything you can have salt done you

can have mushrooms on

trust me I'm a culinary expert

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

again it lights there

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

did you have to lift that up or

did you know that

I thought it doesn't tell me how well

you need to pronunciation there

[Music]

I already knew that you are very clever

[Music]

I didn't know anymore

you have to learn so much Swedish even

though more than me

which would be

something

mushroom fluid thumb that's

the flying mushroom the the toadstone

whatever it is called

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

what do you do it means

in my mushroom

to have questions about

[Music]

here means ramp intake

thank you

there was too much skewing

you can't be skipping too much

um okay

um okay you're so fine laughs

I see pink icy or is white uh companies

white I see black yeah there's a lot of

blackheads I see a bunny he has

definitely

not a dog I see a stream I know it is

fun quality princess bonbon

it is indeed this is fun fun streaming

welcome Ike

you are

very oh

okay

he gives the dressing in

Mickey comes in Odin and steals

complementaries

[Music]

and it fits the reference better okay I

mean the dress was pretty

and there is back and you like that

right

I mean I could keep down the way I was

17 if you want to

I wanted to test it and see what if I'm

seeing what happened

like I got more rates by not having the

underground

I don't know

I could be wrong

what are you doing in my swamp

ah you want it swamped not swamp

and that's what you want to say Savannah

reminds me of swamp but I decided to

translate stretch lines in Swedish books

I didn't change

from the Swedish word or swamp of course

I don't know it

I would assume it is maybe I should

watch straight in Swedish

I think that's a good way to like learn

the language to watch like

language

foreign

films with large

you're familiar with and so

yeah anyway I think

I'm happy with this one

because obviously you're uh you're very

familiar with Shrek you're a short

expert

laughs

I am just swamping around I'm actually

getting interested in watching Shrek

again I did watch through the whole

quadrullity that's the totally the term

is it forfeit

and

yeah I guess it's entertaining

thank you

enter entertaining

okay now to move on to this part

which should be uh

[Music]

this part which looks very odd at the

moment

but that's what I'm going to adjust

to make it less hot

I don't know the lyrics to make a man of

the year from Mulan are a bit different

between English and polish

I mean yeah

and welcome to songs they tend to be

quite different because if you're going

to keep the syllable count as well as

rhyming you have to be quite creative

while in regular speech there's no

rhyming to keep track of yeah but you

should prefer this try to keep up like

buildable count

and set and then also they try to like

match up Mouse movements and stuff but

they're still there

we don't always

with our creative or lazy they are

so yeah so I didn't mean like oh you

should

be you should watch it because you know

all the lines therefore know what

they're saying

because yeah

translations might not actually reflect

what they're saying in

like

I think it's because I mean that's what

you're saying in the translation but I

went like

that's media you can watch and then you

can go through next

sentence by sentence

yes here here

your goal is to learn the language not

watch the film or kiss

your foxy

welcome

welcome

[Music]

you it's very nice to see you here

did you know if you do

if you do the redeem that highlights

your message you were mentioned would

have probably highlighted in green

it is a feature that's better than uses

so I guess this is good

this is Ninja

just this weirdness here

hey how are you this Sunday oh it's

Sunday

I am doing fine

being a lot of great people

sharing up the Stream

making me happy

that people can

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

but it is great seeing people show up

even if it's just a few something like

this

[Music]

oh yeah yeah this is getting bad

[Music]

still working on this mod

[Music]

making

um

freaky

yeah maybe I shouldn't move it all the

way like this

oh

attach a refreshold chat for that

message apparently

polish

very very cool

[Music]

but that's too much for me to read

I thought that about maybe it's too much

points for me to it

[Music]

hey good good I'm editing and uploading

the co-op stream of Donkey Kong Country

I did with cheese earlier this week oh

[Music]

nice I need a

uh

a co-op

and I wanted to

like edit

so it's yeah I upload the

my words to YouTube but I just cut down

the intro counter that's all that I

posted that's it but do you do any

do you do like a highlight dream

highlight video of the

one or possibly multiple streams I think

I've seen some people do that I wouldn't

mind having that

I just can't participating in myself

that seems like a lot of work

I mean I guess I should like try

one of the students only

translations

even if I were to read this message I

didn't even know what the original names

are so

it's only time to get to work to defeat

the enemy and see a bunch of old ladies

that remain around here no one would

fear

uh ads

normal via social groups to listen to

the sound of this one are like men

out of you myself

should I have a separate ad for manages

for artificial

oh you did

[Music]

I mean you did

foxy came in

I thought it was fun not help and our

hands like in

hands hu and

maybe because

the hands were like

I guess they're defeating the hands

let's go

I'm not guarantee

I did not see yesterday

what I do I think it would be like an

advertisement for both kids and myself

more or less more fish kind of yeah that

that's kinda where so every video I post

on YouTube

which

isn't it hey I just uploaded so I

downloaded the stream from twitch I use

ffmpeg

which is a tool that can losslessly

compare remove the intro

and then I upload the file as is to

YouTube which then will compress more

but that's on YouTube

and then

that's it

exactly

I need to make this yeah

[Music]

thank you

and that's

memory he did say hun but I don't recall

the Han empire ever been in China no but

they were invading China

[Music]

is Eclipse champ is a Microsoft twin I

think yeah I think like yeah there's

many tools for that but it is and the

reason why I have chosen to use ffmpeg

is a bus that we only

um

[Music]

it is in correct direction now we do not

and and that is because when you use

most video editing software that would

re-encode the video

and that's a loss of quality

obviously would it be much of a lot of

quality by exporting high quality and

but

and then YouTube is going to compress

its furniture

probably not going to be noticeable but

there is a second benefit

by just removing the intro of the video

it's it's a much faster process

[Music]

so much faster because it doesn't have

to encode this encoding if I mean this

version

so it does not it's very very fast

message

[Music]

but

I guess it's also

quite a nerdy message

of course it does not allow me to do any

form of editing though

[Music]

so no end screens nothing like that it's

Justified

the pure function itself

but I don't bother doing any form of

editing anyways

if I were to edit my clips and upload

them as like a a full gameplay but cut

down I will then upload it on my regular

channel that's it

because that's why I upload the edited

videos

[Music]

and I already did that let's play

offspire which was before I

started streaming

and I was so bad

not that the game but it's at the

individual and speaking and everything

oh licking you have Fox oh I'm getting

leaked

yes you're getting double it

[Music]

Force the health the no

that's not help

the variable but the deferral bunny is

indifference to the whole situation

she's looks on the like

you guys are weird

I know it was

it's a tongue touching

foreign

anyone want to touch tongues with me I

mean

no that would be weird

then clicking front punching get someone

embarrassed

a fun fun is it if one Pawn is trying to

leak away the blushing put the blush on

top

okay so I need to

see if I can adjust the slide

development is that part

I also want to especially we know the

most hair seriously

shopping between us

[Music]

anyway

time touching between two is that fun

fun looking it has

one point looking in the mirror

a nation went back to Spirit of two

steps

but there you go that's the mirror

oh they're both leaking uh

line

no point when you're doing it wrong

you're not supposed to lick the line

[Music]

in the mirror yeah all right

I mean that was the first thing you said

yeah I got I got I just wanted to

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

this one needs to be a bit windy

if I'm married

one step

and I guess what they're trying to show

is off of this game there we go

this part

okay let's

go

okay that's too much way too much

she ate Candy that's supposed to change

the color of your tongue and she's

sticking if it worked

yeah

what candy she eat something blue

yellow

yeah I believe in yellow candy

is there any candy in here

all right no no

but

as long as you should consider

uploading her

little tweet as an emote

if there's stuff

you might not have enough image Flats

available

is orange

thank you

okay let's see if this works

and growing up Jojo

yeah that's bad

it's a perfect place babe

we can't seek Perfection as I go and

edit more

I think that was even very

should we start beat Tony

this can enlarge them

let's let's make it so a bit smaller

is that all of them I think

primary flies I've been working on this

for a long time yeah I think that's one

of them

well

it is done

let's compare to coconut

yeah

don't you put one of them

so

[Music]

okay of course then there is this placed

on top of that so someone does that yes

ends nowhere they ends

yeah like this

yay

[Music]

not [ __ ]

yeah

[Music]

yeah because it's not done yet

done yet because there's one more thing

which can be seen

on something it's not all of these I

think it's clearest here there's shadow

[Music]

very very light shadow

so I will add that

oh I like this song I don't know what

song it is so

[Music]

but I'm glad you like it because it's

one of the new songs that I'm talking

about

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

that's that song

hope you enjoyed it

yeah the shadow should be Softly

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

yes just like this stuff there wanna

compare care which is bigger and more

tastier

and do you like carrots

I actually don't have a chance

but I guess I could go to the store and

buy a really big carrot

[Music]

okay the next thing here is that somehow

it feels like there's a globe at the

same time

yeah there's some kind of down here

okay let's see if I can do it again

to take these

put them in a group

under this shadow that might actually

effectively

thick carrots you got a lot of chance

but did you get all this from

is that why I don't have any carrots and

you hate chip them

Thief

yeah I just like a blue glow to it

[Music]

but not this strong but until the glow

strong first just to see if it appears

correctly on the mesh

and if so

I'll set it to its intended value

update there we go

yeah look at this

yeah it's like here anyway

why doesn't that one have a big Bell

oh

you can see we can do something about

that

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

connection there

and now update

yeah it's perfect

but

yeah that's good stuff joining that

recipe tricky

thank you

okay basically

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

so let's see how

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

so let's see how it looks now

and sorry for you know my comments again

sometimes I get

kindly missed it

I bought them I mean actually I got them

for free from the yard the eager carrots

are you going cats for me

I'm Gonna Catch before and they were

yellow

Stone

[Music]

carrots

it means the yellow wheat

because it's yellow and is there

a root fruit

yep

thank you

foreign

for each

if I just do that

now it's just just a hint of it though

that's it didn't work

but now

I need to add this stuff to

all of the other things

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

stuff it's

quite slow

okay

so here's the original thing on Cocoa

here

so on the emission there's nothing on

the all Dimension is nothing

but here you go this one

is the

SE yeah

[Music]

like in the united dose but this one is

the one

and also

came back like this and move it

as far as you can have there's no glue

showing that

I should also have it

this one has such share there

and I was gonna give it get bit weird

like that there but let me see what I

can do

let's go

[Music]

[Music]

I can't remember the clown like I said

in that hot tea

don't do it

production properly so that we mix this

now

next part is

and this one doesn't have the shadow

that's nice

so which color is it then

60.

[Music]

60

foreign

[Music]

and then the metallic the suit has to be

certain metallic effect but these does

not

so these should appear on the lip like

like that

[Music]

I tell this one I can preview in blender

I don't know how to set up the FW and FC

at night

[Music]

so I'm saying metallic

then we move on to

this one is interesting because

these are indented

something I can't do

[Music]

but let's look at roughness first

126.

[Music]

so copy all these roughness

[Music]

there you go

and roughness is another one I can

Premiere in blender so I'll save that

[Music]

so the only one left is the normal map

[Music]

thank you

so

[Music]

the way I will do this is by

meshing the values

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

that

so the other one will be adding

there we go that's that's one

[Music]

I see a dirty image what

it's very hard to see at the moment but

foreign

like that

thank you

but this one she needs to be green

so now it's starting to look like this

thing here

I also need to figure out how much it

suits

foreign

Ty

create more groups

okay

[Music]

and these rooms should be changed

further

but I said this would be a big forgive

the video wasn't so slow

uh

[Music]

of course I do think I need to make it

to

[Music]

[Music]

all right

the image I want one too wait what what

do you want for 30 minutes

foreign

[Music]

I guess I need something that

cools it down and it needs additional

Cooling

because it does perform better before it

gets so hot

this is a captain right there is a line

um

I'm trying to work out the

another American point

which is a

the process

[Music]

but um

[Music]

musician is separate

makes this

here we go

[Music]

because this looks like what they do

or cocoa

let's take a look

[Music]

does this look like this I guess this

one is much stronger

[Music]

um

thank you

I guess I can set it back

that should reflect it

on that no

[Music]

[Music]

come on yeah

[Music]

oh yeah

that that's the right thing

to me

I feel like I've said something else do

you know I've seen again

um

I'd like your banana please can't give

me a banana

let's talk with this computer

[Music]

[Music]

because that's not what I can expect it

to look like

then he said okay that's it's fine

that's me

the ISD that I'm gonna support today

and let's try that

[Music]

yeah it's not going to any quite effect

this is

this is a bit tricky and I thought

you guys ignore this

I'll do the

the old way

the old classic way

the reliable way

[Music]

the oldest reliable way

this is white

and the lines are my car

okay

and then I just send this in to that

website that's generated normal for me I

should have done it from the start I

shouldn't have tried

I shouldn't even about it

foreign

[Music]

default settings

copy

and paste

yeah this is what I'm looking for we

should paint a little bits

attack

exactly the same

but you can have close enough

[Music]

yeah I got a lot of

other stuff included

yeah let me

[Music]

is it okay she never spotted bully me

again

let me try again

[Music]

[Music]

now yeah this is more like it

[Music]

now I can just add this

like they are over there but yeah

this is not a map

all right

there we go

now

export this

and now I can rest and see how it works

[Music]

photography existence

yes that is Let's Be distract my death

and bodies don't eat bananas one is to

eat bananas but it's not the biggest

source Coffee Company

can

rabbits eat banana

should not be getting more than it says

two tablespoons but that doesn't really

tell me how much it is could you please

like these real units of banana okay

five pounds is the body weights what did

I say about using real units

33 times a week

as a generational narrative and regular

piece of banana with larger the size of

your thumb with my sump

has different size depending on who I am

but

rabbitcairtips.com

units in that website

anyway

my company is an answer that would say

it's okay

yeah if they

um

make them very hard at the elite

okay after

now it's a bit not botanic after eating

roughness

they go now that's shiny

and then after this might see an effect

now

there you go

okay something easy to tell see but

whoa

it's shiny I guess that's that

it's gonna ask this

what are you saying I should peel the

banana and not give give up a banana

with tea return rabbit okay yeah

yeah it's probably best to not give

banana I don't want to grab it then used

to be on the safe side

[Music]

[Music]

any joke for anyone here listening or

eating Swedish day is because unripe

Mugen is ripe uh

a bit unripe is this like ripened unripe

is the same term in Swedish as mature

and immature

[Music]

because if you give it an immature

banana the rabbit will be immature here

we go

[Music]

now I explain the joke so now we can all

laugh at it

laugh at my jokes

so

thank you for the

love heart is that for my explanation of

the jokes

I wasn't here for this year well let's

see our problem

sounds like a year problem

anyway

nah

but I'll explain jokes no you get it

anyway

it looks weird without the there's a gap

that would have to go and stick out with

a character

I guess you're cute but

the whole thing should still have

it's soft this part actually like these

parts

and this part might not actually be

properly

assigned follow the body propane

so let me

[Music]

that's the next step now

switch to solids

check the white paint

and then let's see

okay so these are made to

stop and I also these things as hard

things

yeah 22

how little like if you want something to

look solid on an animation you make sure

that the weight means is the same across

the whole thing

and better

than this needs that means that I should

copy the

prevent data transfer them used it

and because I realized butter species

anyway let's see your daughter transfer

and I can use this one to pick

vertex vertex groups

changed facing interpolated against

and generally

and I'm sorry

so now

this should basically the same but it

should be more accurative well because

in the parts are removed let's see

uh

wait clean remove on

on yeast

as many there's a lot of these groups

which one is those are decimal I could

probably remove them as one

and then we normalize all

don't look active

yeah here we go

is this is this outfit done should I

create a new connection for this outfit

yeah let's create a collection which no

no

let's create a collection in the Pom-Pom

connection which I call

outfits and in this one I will call this

one a quality what's supposed to be

calling game let me check that is it

because we called

cocoa face ships but every outfit is

called Corpus I just can't complacency

so what I mean

okay shift

and then I'll just

this other crown

that he has backup kind of

drop the everything here

I like it

I like it anyway

um

that was a reference to where

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

amateur amateur this one is insected

correct amateur

this one is

[Music]

good perfect

here we go

select all of these including Armature

export

as fbx and now I will export this as one

base shift

then select targets

export

and it's exporting

[Music]

[Music]

then it's done

so

I don't think I need blender anymore

or photoshop

because it's going to take a lot of

performance and it is running in the

background

so

probably close blender now since I

should be done with it

however I do still need to export these

textures

well done with that

because I'm going to open Android and

to take a bunch of performance

but it is closed plan I can start a

editor for now so it can launch in the

background

while I export these it extra textures

commission one emission two

[Music]

you are here

and I'm happy you're here and I'm going

to uh I'm exporting textures I've

exported the mod mesh I'm going to put

this stuff in Android editor now

it is currently launching in the

background

this computer is not the fastest

so

especially not when I'm running like

blender let's say

[Music]

I think you're exporting is already

I don't even remember if there is a t

texture for

export exported exporting t as well I

don't know which is a tea texture or

face but I guess I'll see

[Music]

foreign

foreign

[Music]

can I show it

up

not that one

apparently selecting the invalid on

selects are the first battle foreign

there was no privacy she's just

standing and launching it up

but yeah the computer's gotten quite

I probably need some some

cooling uh plate thing that I can place

so I can put the computer on

and basically like uh

fridge

which is taking the Heat and moving it

that way

I think you call it a heat sink

because it's like a cinch for heat

just like you have a water sink in the

kitchen

heatsink is a heat

Reservoir that can absorb an arbitrary

amount of heat without significantly

changing temperature

yeah it's probably not that specifically

it's a heat scene when I looked it up

there's a specifically the same but it

would act as I hate seeking it yeah

yeah maybe I hate Sage

yeah basically but uh fridge starts but

moving away anyway Android editor

might compensated

[Music]

so

let's see I should open X model

bye

okay

and stop playing for those who are not

subscribers more terrible users

so

I should have left yet

yes

there's a lot of files when it comes to

crash four

I don't know why they have so many files

which one is more

but compared to Spyro which has three

fights

nothing exactly sure why attached to be

fine so you would assume that these

three files would be one for each game

but that's not the case

Coco

so here's the content so

um so as you see here it's called skins

thank you

so uh so skins is straight in the

content folder which I can show but

anyways skins in the content folder

that's what I will create here

skins and then in skins we need to find

the one that's called face it's called

Coco finish it

so I will create that number

cocoa face shift I hope that's correctly

let's pass the account no

no cancel

yes thank you

uh there is no copy there is copy

director part which I could do

but then I get everything but then I can

copy that but I think basically

or something

is

under handle exception occurred RPF

reference not sets to an instance one of

it

okay

that was weird

it's receptors okay

that's fine

edit again

and

okay

all right that was an unexpected error

that's kind of what

it was unexpected

go to the

4.4.3.2 release of f modem these have a

fixed company with fortnite and a prop

sources

that's nice

yes

um

F model is the fortnite model viewer I

think it stands for but it works for a

lot of stuff and it's really

useful and there's one of the questions

of course

um

you know that's probably because I

accidentally pressed the wrong thing

before

and so what uh I'll be looking at now

I'm going to create the full instruction

that's what we're going to do now

so

so in the face shifts in here it's going

to be once called materials

one that's called a mesh and once that's

called

textures

so in the mesh folder the meshow

we can look at the packages so yeah so

this is what it's supposed to be called

so I'll put the machine here if you get

it

and

let me go to just bring It Forward there

also I should have put it I exported it

straight into the base folder I should

put in the spaceships only to keep my

everything

so I will import it

do the pop-up you can see

and

I'll do how to select the existence

skeleton because it will use the

existence I think

secret pop-up

and then

of disable search material because

by default it's kind of this it only

search locally anyway but I changed it

previously so now I change it back

so now it's importing no smoothing group

information was found yes that is great

so here it is

oh

since then I should give it these names

so this is the SK which you can

determine by this pop-up that doesn't

show up this pop-up which says skeleton

match SK stands for scaffold

and not super confused with the the

short and the term

s-t-e-l or scale which is the stands for

skeleton

assume scatteredness

SK could also stand for skeleton why

they didn't call it SM for skeletal mesh

shiny now

and then just s for skeleton used like

they have t for textures

it is twice for Bob who decided for

these names this is not the 100 is the

default

just for a second anyway back to naming

SK underscore CP for for character

player

3704 which is just a random number Coco

which is

face shift which is the

outfits

in the files could have check could

I could name it whatever they want but

they decided to follow this pattern to

keep organized

those too far

now

they are and they faint I guess Fame

doesn't show up on the string there

yeah

the error message

crashed

again quite a crash over sudden it was

more stable before

I need to live in making

[Music]

correct trash fine

at

the girl

again

it's an updated should I or close the

same the settings open it up again

you will keep my settings now

yes

um

acceptance

wait what does it say

update mode stable okay

yes

let's let's change the version

one two

I'm sorry sorry that okay that was all

the girls and I had to refresh

that's weird I mean certainly because

I'm streaming from my computer and if

the computer does something it might

affect the Stream

but at the same time it shouldn't

anyway back to where I was

basic shift

so let's check the pictures where are

the textures

and it almost changed the scene so

I do have two textures here but yeah I

can move things here

[Music]

saying this to a pop-ups doesn't show up

um

her hair is still pictures but I would

add

all of the pictures I'm gonna I'll

replace those as well because those came

from blender I want to make sure

[Music]

I get everything as they should be now

it's important yes

the import progress bar has shown up

and if there's anything you're curious

about what I'm doing is to ask

so it is still importing

the texture and how simple it doesn't

know that that is correct

yeah

and now

we have to check

say he

yeah his texture group character it's

not exactly important if it's left all

of things

and go to

and put anywhere from The Matrix

can I

bring that up yes

there you go

so as it's kind of hard to see here

because of me

the way it takes overlap is beautiful

uh here

this is very useful to to get so you

want the settings for all of the

textures are

we need to see which textures are so

[Music]

this one should be character

now I do know it says character yeah it

says texture

extra group

but every order

if it's saying that character specular

specular

this character

retrospective okay

[Music]

so for these

[Music]

and you can use this side panel here to

[Music]

it's easy to just type here make sure

you know

practice

this one character and I see this should

also eat

foreign

this one is of course normal map

character specular and I do see that

there is no uh deep in here

and also one more important thing

uh srgb which are constantly in this

list

hundreds I mean hydrated

quite much quite a lot trying to find

[Music]

but yeah it also says PF dxt1

and I guess that's what it says here too

there we go oh there's a lot of

[Music]

foreign

what I try to find which I didn't find

srgb mythology what's what's that

meaning code

[Music]

oh there we go there you go it's RGB

false

and

you have to set srgb to false

or

every spec Knight

and because otherwise it will read it in

practice

and now not that I had simple last one

but and now I can save these

this means that they are unsaint

the

that's disappear as soon as it's done

foreign close and now I need to just

there we go yeah and switch back

because I don't need the tea because tea

didn't exist

these are the ones that actually exist

so

this back here

somewhere

any materials

that too but that doesn't matter what

matters is that this one is expecting

what I think because if I go back in

here

foreign

[Music]

why is that

I think it's trying to

[Music]

seek his trying to download the

[Music]

free investment only periods

there we go

yeah plus it would be required to if the

computer was so slow but I'm doing my

best

everyone has left the stream now when I

think

I wonder if that's three freeze if it

throws Downstream and then

cheats everyone else kinda

unless you refresh which they did

but yeah yeah but you said you refreshed

can I open the mesh this time because I

need to open yeah now it says completed

instead of failed good good

so

yeah it must be something we'd really

try to do there

so there's a lot of stuff here which is

even buying it yet but

there's a bones and stuff

and there's the asset which is

in the same folder as

scene and here we go here's the

name of the material

which again is behind this set

but yeah

so

if we

go to materials no no here it is

it should remove the materials

and I assume it already got the correct

name

so uh what you don't have to do

is set up the textures however and you

don't have to do that but you can do

that if you want to see how it looks

in editor

thank you

and

I think that's for now

so you can set up

and

at least actually I know what to do it

which is

my tummy

[Music]

I'm just normal

it's what is

roughness

oh

okay and then they should be

beautiful thing

there should be one more way

which is the emission

yeah I probably doesn't matter what day

[Music]

all right here we go uh in the

if you bring up that again I should have

should I checked this before

[Music]

here we go here's here's FC and it says

bus color and then it is FW which is

what what's with

that's what it stands for and T stands

for translucency map

and the Apparently using the default

character transmission select

and then MSC map is number two so

like a big number it doesn't matter what

you said it's up to but

this is I just want to see what it

looks like

probably applied

it's insane

[Music]

and this isn't exactly how it's set up

in the original game but doesn't matter

I'm not going to use this material it's

going to use me for my hair

from the game itself

but you still need to name have a

material like a dummy material in the

end store

and this is for

the

for the mesh itself to know where it

should look for the files in the game

here we go

[Music]

and it's the

next

and here's the wish

in there this way

but there is like those parts are white

it shouldn't be this strong but

um they are glowing

in the game

so

you don't know additional settings I

need to do in here so let's see if I can

find those

in here

which I can't find for some reason

it's so weird it doesn't show up anymore

this makes sense to me

like

[Music]

that's weird

because as far as I know you're supposed

to call this one

in your body

and body body and because otherwise

because that's what it reads it reads

the slot name body

um

[Music]

let's share

for some reason yeah it doesn't show up

anymore on the list and I don't know why

so yeah

[Music]

but I think that's that's what I think

so I would cook it

and then I will copy all the files

um make equipped files to the mod Vines

do I have uh

[Music]

I do here

folder here with Pom-Pom mode

and here is where this stuff should go

[Music]

so I need to recreate the full

instruction here while

I could just copy it away from click

finds us

that's almost more convenient

my name is Dr King

and then I'll test it in game

[Music]

so it will be I will navigate it in the

secret folder in actions

it has been a test completed it's

cooking

here

there you go but there are things I

don't need in this folder I don't need

materials because it can use a different

material and I don't need the

th5 these are going it's going to use

the original pH part but it's going to

replace textures and it's going to

replace the image and that should be it

foreign

[Music]

so let's generate the pack

so many

Secrets candles yeah yeah

I don't know if it's

it's so much larger because I

wanted it so much louder but anyway

let's put it in here

and I guess uh

launchpad.net.exe

and

don't need unreal anymore

[Music]

and I don't need that but I'll enable

crash four

I can plug in a controller as well

convenience

testing

[Music]

and then

your login section expired oh come on

I don't know my password

you know because I don't

keep that around

and I need to go and get the password

that's

certainly can it be

minions

copy password

remember the password

if

I mean I find if it's like clear stick

cooking or something but

and

every second let me but you keep saying

the password on the client it's my own

computer

and then

um oh yes you close

F minus one

the only information given here crash

four nothing else

launching game

Which languages is it to by the way I

tested different languages before

um

answer to English no not that in

marriage but

it would be quite surprised if it

shouldn't languages

it is translated to polish

foreign

there we go

it is slowly learning

wherever they

oh yeah it is reality

yeah

we don't need the background music now

we got the game usage the game is

we don't need only from the game anymore

no

but the description has polishes

available it's weighted a lot of games

don't have because there's a lot of

Polish speakers

now it's loaded but that's not true

because that loading is just uh

a video playing

it's not actually loading uh a learning

bar so

when it's computer is so slow

an athletes for working like doing the

modeling and texturing personal it kind

of makes it warm and slow

there you go

let's see if I can start it without it

crashing

this is still part of the arting

yeah

this is also

uh the reason why I don't want to test

you know I did I never picked it

I didn't update the regular purple skin

I should probably done that

anyway

moving on

yeah I should be able to

test the

the mask

that one is at least updated

yeah yeah I should have taken

and I still got very much

yeah it's only been four and a half

hours I could I could also uh

I can just update it said it's ready for

future I guess

yeah

it's completely slow

it's really slow computer

time Wireless loading it's not loading

now we have to load more

coffee so this is the mask we can

so yeah

but now with the mask enabled look at

this Earth which has three cameras

something

computer yes

in game

then you can switch and it also switches

on quantum

[Music]

and if you stand inside it and switch

each dish destroying

that's fancy I guess

yeah where I said

I guess

yeah problem is that the mask is

clipping through the thing

and I see the position of the mass is

kind of we had this one I wish I could

get a closer view

this is the best es camera but the game

is running quite fine

because the camera pulls back when

you're facing the camera which makes

sense that's like good good design but

it does make it harder to get a good

look

it's the same thing when you're facing

to the student

right and left to octopus together back

that's not allows you to see more

more to the science when but when I'm

waiting for it it puts format

as that's irrelevant

looking in

15.

I guess there's nothing here to look at

that so

dude

I don't find a bit weird after this

thing

around the ears don't glow when

switching mode

that's not how it works in originally

the things about it around the ears

yeah shame I can't do it like it's full

size

that's

yeah it is working that's the important

thing

well

yeah and then I want them to say it is

working I wish there was like a free cam

or something I keep zooming

this one for Spyro but

there might be one for crashed as one

yeah this is totally how you destroy

this

so I guess that's that any comments

anyone else saying I want to say

something

there's a visible one here too

if you try to get close you can't

have you eat

yeah it starts in the alternate states

that in the two Tuesdays instead of the

one state which I do find interesting

so um

the death button and I'll change the

icons too

ta-da

so

time left

so let's

foreign

up

blender again

there you go

because this is the

base shaped

the I don't need that anymore but we

should have

oh yeah I didn't update the default

because the default isn't even done yet

I'm really interesting

does it blender doesn't remember how

wide it was before so that when I did

not online

but I

oh yeah for the face shift I didn't add

it well but I guess I don't need the

ball do I

it doesn't it doesn't really fit you

know anything

I mean I guess I could still have like

it instead of things

but I'm not looking like this though

I don't know and I love her

hey

hello hello

[Music]

yay I'm happy like it's your day should

I have the bow for this outfit or not it

is fine to just leave it without

it but it does substrate the earring

yeah exactly so maybe maybe for the

because I mean it but as it was I was

first going to say it is a bit weird if

the boat disappears when she gets a

power up but it's kind of odd how her

outfit changes too so

I guess no bows for a power ABS then

Maybe

because the powerapps do have different

heads headwear so I guess

so I guess this replace

the mouse but to show us up right

it's like I said they had where it

replaces the bus the bow right I guess

that's fine

so let's uh

I can make these

there we go

oh no not this one then yeah

this would be the I mean oh yeah I need

to fix the scale of them object so let's

look at the

desk on the way

this is

the wrong

there we go

let's say maybe something

this one and let's fix the one of the

outfits at least which would be

the underwear outfit

which I will replace the 360 no scope

I think

it would be a

foreign

also

oh this skeleton model even has power of

the way uh it's um it's raining around

actually at the moment

because I have replaced

I haven't fixed the

uh

okay so this is spaceships and done with

that

this this one are called default but

this isn't default this is

I said I would replace

let's go back here

so at the next extract this stuff

and

diet

playing Crash I don't care but flash but

I guess I need to include trash again so

the game doesn't crash

and again it doesn't replace anything so

I should be able to just uh

copy that was all day and put it into my

not

being

and but this means that now

it should in addition to the

face shift it now has the gain and

sideward speeds which are the two

skins that are supposed to come with

no scrub is a difference

yes it's the yeah

okay so I actually don't need to edit

hey

so um

I don't need that anymore

um

so let's check uh what's the basic

minoscope that should be at least open

that case

what could it be called in that case

yeah that's a problem the the actual

skin is called 360 no scope but they

they all have code names here

fake

future

could it be future

I don't know gone through these sections

but I can open it in

no that's the Future Past scheme

at least one that kind of matches the

name of it

gamer

yeah it is must be the game Skin three

signals cap that's game right

foreign

[Music]

there you go

here is the cat ear headset

and there's more expensive so this is

the the three signals game called King

oh

I will now create an outfit which are

called gamer gamer will be replaced with

the underwear version because as you

know when you're gaming you're in your

underwear

no it's just a bonus outfit for Pom-Pom

I could have a game or something like

this

would make sense

should I make

should I make a game a problem any

headset but I don't really have like a

gamer outfit

it's just a default dress in any case

let's just replace the game

so I will call this

come on gamer body

and accessible

but I guess I'll just duplicated

[Music]

bye

so what more is standing underwear of

course

again duplicate them

they will be using multiple outfits

and was there anything else but they are

dancing

now I think that's all

nothing else to add I think

against underwear and though that's what

you wear

that's a good question

so

going in here

what are the

let's see

this is the underwear

this is the bow so yeah oh yes this is

but

so this one now

I need to create a new folder in my base

folder which I call local gamer that's

the moment to replace

there's enough

yeah I can

give a moment

[ __ ]

you sure are

you about the gaming yeah

but it would became oh it doesn't

challenge me

and rename them from face ship to gamer

thank you and sing over that one

yes

no that's one that's right

FC which was a first color

but

FW which was pass away

some land stuff now

and for metallic nothing is metallic the

skin is completely clear

and for normal map flat

oh I did realize that I was I wanted to

add one more thing

over roughness

I could say that properties first and

then I can add it because

I don't think it's used

which I don't think is seriously yeah

that's that's budget

go back here now

this is specifically the gamer one

so I'll switch this to where

all the switches

phase shift duplicate it and then set it

to

gamer

and

and then

story machine

they're not just

open the games here see

there we go

um

or

what should be non-colored

non-color is

just means not srgb

and I can explain how to sing with srgb

if anyone is curious

and and phenomena

is something

but I'll change that now because now I

want to switch out the material

to gamer

he came here

on this one again

it is not pink it's a little heart

pretty happy without the underwear

actually turned on

this one thing I want to add

and

oh yeah yeah

and let me switch over to actually

those underwear that was actually used

in the

us

it's very

appropriate now thank you

no but what I wanted to do to point out

was that on Cocoa

[Music]

here

actually

foreign

I was thinking

should I add that

because I mean

it's kind of like folding that [ __ ]

makes sense

[Music]

question is yes can I add it here

[Music]

can I have to work properly

now so the previous skin the face shift

I replaced that I made to be like Focus

outfit that so there was a lot of

copying over texture wise and matches

but now I'm making my own original skin

before that I replace gamer so I don't

care about any of the gamer pictures

those are irrelevant

foreign

[Music]

so let me export

the

[Music]

Darkness like that

export

let's call it you'll be

Roku

underway

points

[Music]

come from amazing here there's so much

to stream

still exporting a very heavy evening

transported

foreign

import

s

anything

so

[Music]

moving

[Music]

on continue

resource here and then click run away

let's see

oh yeah

there we go that's how it makes it

and then I will switch here and check

out which means

um this one is completely

I really like this

there are different this one is various

questions

this one is not but that means I can

probably still got me

no separately if that makes sense

because I only need them yeah

Darkness

it's a copy that

and paste it here

very nice check which channel does

provide

Administration

you can

[Music]

I could also

oh

make my phone

the blue Channel as well

because I don't know it

makes those 50 50.

and then can I faces the resolution of

the

shaving or something

so

this is mostly going to be a test

so I want to see

almost like the edge there you go

it's nice

[Music]

um

strange 20 money

like that

let's do beginning as a back I think

King so meet your left back

[Music]

then I can

[Music]

remove everything and second Heat

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

you can warn me about the ants

[Music]

and then I said it is subtract okay now

now it acts like a shading

now I can put it here

as centered as I can do

it's very strong I could I could make it

softer

although it doesn't need to be

specific invert this again

[Music]

uh

it could provide

[Music]

I understand

and they write sport things now

and then check how it looks

and update it

and

that's the game

and refresh

so yeah now there's a bit more detail it

doesn't look very isn't it

but it's not like moving the flare

make the belly fluffy but it is Fluffy

if you look carefully

you can see it's very very it's very

easy to see in the dark in the night

that's the name of the names

foreign

foreign

basically now

and because

anyway

I should have maybe done this at the

same time

welcome back everyone who wasn't

subscribed to enter them terrible or

around his name

so

[Music]

well let's just

is doing the same thing again

right

that all becomes the gray skin Channel

now this is just one thing that slightly

annoys me in workshop and if someone

else picks this issue

I would be so happy

because it would actually send me some

time but this is quite the process as

you sure you don't see the pop-up I'm

working in but you can see that it takes

a bit time of adjusting the colors after

this

but I do have this panel so I can just

go here oh look it's the red shell I can

just select everything copy and then

paste now I have the red channel the

problem is

this is what Russia should look like

this is what the red jump becomes if I

copy it from channels it does some kind

of

gamma correction

for some sort and ruins everything I

just want to copy this red Channel

values as the grace cake

as seen copying the red Channel values

and paste it on the ingredients which is

what I do with this filter

but it's just so many steps and I just

want one simple step but that's not

that's not an option

hey

[Music]

can you sing again

remember everything that's been called

amused

or action

that I want to use and could result in

weird shading on other parts

so I'll remove it

I can't clean up that's me

foreign

can split these two because

that can be quite useful

and now let's

place this shading on her practice one

and I don't need this anymore

let's have a reference

but this is very really shaped here

is it shaped like that

I guess it's

this part

I'm gonna keep this in here I wonder if

that wanted to show

and yeah

it was mixed that part

so if I want it to be placed let's say

that

all right so select select everything

and now I have that section here it's

kind of there I want to put it

if I can do that

[Music]

wow POV came from inside pom-poms

underneath

yep and this is Insider anyway

[Music]

but there's not bloody inside the

underwear anyway

whatever

yeah inside the underwear

you wouldn't be able to see much

it would be very nice

install the camera inside your underwear

and if you don't mind

oh you didn't mind

a lot

nothing we can do about that then

I guess you'll just have in mind

hope you don't mind oh you didn't mind

upon mind then

but never mind some reasons I guess it

wasn't meant to make any sense

well there is some shading on the

underwear

I guess it kind of looks weird if

everything else is playing it

okay

that doesn't look as good though

on the front at at least clicked finding

is

this part there okay

I guess it's up up inside lady

okay so what I need to do is

that is back to normal

and then I

basically need to make sure that

everything that is a single color I

actually don't need

I don't need that distance

[Music]

right

I'm sure that's nice but

hmm

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

hmm here it is

because then I would have to have the

same here just turn that same color

[Music]

and let's add a slides outline

okay

then I can

learn it that's a bit too much

yeah that's that's left

so now

bye

if I look at it now

the shading should be even

okay let's see

refresh yeah now oh well not really

more even

yeah I just can't get it still working

nicely

[Music]

yeah I think

[Music]

I think I got back on the

right yeah

I have these

[Music]

where I really

see there's only one seam and a few more

insights

um

so yeah at least let's see my edits I

added PC which is because I can just see

there are seems already

things

[Music]

okay

hmm

oh okay

I like to be coming something

I guess I didn't show them

to be fair

[Music]

[Music]

um

okay let's see

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

I mean it's it's harder to see

like it's not a perfect transition but

getting enough

that's if I make it a bit softer

in tone

he's going to get even harder to see

so

I I didn't copyright

take other effects

[Music]

like the normal map is kind of important

[Music]

and there's no roughness difference

sometimes they do

like how they make a darker is less

rough

which I guess doesn't make sense

would they make them more rough

I should not remember

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

difference I need to make

[Music]

sorry sorry don't

change strongly

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

foreign

[Music]

imagine having that

anyway

now the color difference is softer so

it's easy to see

thanks that's great position

yeah okay

[Music]

kind of things

I guess it's probably self-straining

[Music]

I wish there was a piece that really

stood out from the rest

[Music]

I think that's it

yeah that's it just repeat

[Music]

so it's this part that I'm interested in

mostly I mean there's this thing there's

no problem I can just copy of the second

element is first

so

for the FC

[Music]

I just have this too but

I guess even softer

and then they should also business

this part

there's a lot of stuff going on here

already

[Music]

this thing should be placed on top of

everything

when

you know the drill

we need a dream and so do I

know

that wasn't properly

a surprise and then

thank you

tonight yeah

press the wrong button or something

anyway

foreign

[Music]

colors they were supposed to be

not spray stain

[Music]

that that's one that's the one I said

Jake

oh

[Music]

it's there again

[Music]

This Dance

and that's that

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

then try to remove

[Music]

[Music]

which can be a bit tricky

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

all right I'm getting left

[Music]

[Music]

this one was should be much easier to

clean up

which is very when it's easy

this underwear will be used on multiple

outfits I better why not put a bit of

extra effort into it

[Music]

oh my this is my direction

different

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

yeah

just assumed inside

should not assume I could just go to

see

and I don't lictify

are you crazy

probably the same as we've been on the

same

[Music]

most people don't say like yeah

maybe it's just nice you come

convenient when it existed them

[Music]

back in your big scenes Canada

I don't know maybe maybe the fox is

supposed to be generally neutral

in that case it should be listed

and

I went

[Music]

only two is here keeping hello I'm here

now for a little bit over this what work

is going okay now that's good and I'm

working

um I am working on

the way

exciting isn't it

[Music]

be generated

do you have

yeah there is

using the guide

it's getting very hard to see

yeah

it's mattifying she's controlling it she

she'll be okay that's good

I'm gonna be mad you got a very cute

surprise

but yeah

magic anyway

that's a story to write about fun fun is

wearing magic underwear

the magic anyway against special

abilities

nice

[Music]

oh my cute

which part yeah

maybe both

[Music]

and add

like that

that should be outside so you shouldn't

know

whoops yeah both both

let me turn

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

ones

attracting me I love you anyway

although I really realize that

connected

I should only add 80 together

and add these two together

and then I need to switch yes

forgot about that I said rotate it

as we look here

[Music]

you know

yeah so there's bright dark

green should be

bright

it's not gonna be good

and the red one

Community inverted

singing okay

yeah the other time is for a long time

again

um

okay

[Music]

and then we

[Music]

a lot of mixing

[Music]

these should be set to step subtract

and this is

next now many attempts lately yes this

is good

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

now finally I can test it

wow

update this one

there we go

oh there's no definition here

is it too strong maybe I think most of

the other ways can apply

probably

[Music]

let's reduce this strength a bit

oh look

wait wait that means what are you trying

to imply your immune

electrocuted the feral Bunny and the

feral bunny is dead and the pheromony is

quite indifference to the hallucination

but oh well okay some of that now

I guess that happens sometimes

[Music]

oh no those

areas are two unrelated images

do you know it's no don't be dead

don't be dead I love you

[Music]

I love you

little feral bunny

little feral pumpkin

so I think I'm done

is anything else you should do no

I think this is fine this is this is

pumped funny on the way which is one of

the costume options

first one is foreign

show that for some reason a very sick

lightning bolt

the second one she became a vulpantinger

who was parting here

you mean

no at least

if you get a kid

yeah very cute let's export this now

export

and this

this only export is foreign

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

under where

I exported that so I should go and

Export the textures as well

because I don't think there's anything

more to these textures

very very light outfit

cold weather outfit

[Music]

game game

I think that's as well

amen FC

gamer FW

[Music]

m

and

r r

test

I always have to say that

and then T which I think gives our knees

because it's plain white

so

now

that one is done

now I want to

try to delete some of these I don't

think anything anymore

but I can re-add them if I need them

like this one I'm done

[Music]

like that

and I have something over here

let's see

Bianca

both events need so that's from Nancy

as you clear up a bit a few materials

and stuff

I guess they

it was saying

the restaurant

no yeah so let's see a little bit unused

so if I say again

right very weird way of doing this but

now they're gone

but actually Mark a lot of detection

was it right after Texas

being really loud to find

anyway

oh no this one also has these things

black and this one has the

same here

showing that it's like a suit she's

wearing

hydrate yes

foreign

but this time

yeah

I guess I'll prepare

[Music]

not too much

oh

thanks a few parts far

East with bunny

[Music]

making it slightly harder to copy our

way

[Music]

another one

her hair bun

[Music]

which probably this one the other one

makes Indians but it sure the other one

is the other one shifts between two

different modes

it also made the bridge show up or not

and so some items are only in one face

and you can shift which faces for some

reason doesn't affect the whole world

only those items and this one is the

gravity

months let's go in here but I guess it

might be very small on your phone though

but yes this is reality it also says it

here

it says it here

it says it's here almost there and here

and here

I think that's all the places actually I

like to say there you go that's all the

places where it says security

three in three

I'm going to make

this outfit for a ponton because fun fun

is going to replace cocoa

so let's use this one

large and copy over

I was actually not done with the

face shift texture but I can be so

Mickey

I really just

still don't know I think this time it's

I will actually lift it up I think I'll

look it up before

but I don't think it was Shameless rude

bracing cheeky I get cheeky works

I can be so cheeky as to do those small

edits on the texture of string

so brain sent us to do it

although I do want to make a break

breaks in Cosplay for myself

I will be so Brazen as to wear it

everywhere

to your family gathering

and what we can offended

wearing a cosplay to have family

gathering

I mean dressed as a person

in the summer of the comments

I should take a look at it

cute

yeah that would that would be kind of

cute

I hope so I want to be cute

kitten can be dirty

but maybe maybe I don't know if you

should possibly it's a highlighted

it's fairly funny five cosplay

[Music]

Pokemon

and Digimon hair like

investors are so nice today one

another

[Music]

thing but with your husband with me to

uh family Catherine

[Music]

would you meet my family and cosplay at

the same time

the first impression of you coming

probably dressed as something

probably didn't even cosplayers in that

case

yes yes you would

okay but why would you cosplayers

[Music]

that would be really cute I guess it

would be cute

[Music]

good

apparently I have these Family Guy I

think during summer and summer it's not

a great time of the year to do cosplay

in what I think because I wanted to be

like a fairy animal like Greensburg and

wait for in summer it doesn't seem like

a good condition

and it would be Pittsburgh by the way

before someone asks what are my cleans

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

good thing

itself is you can undo

which is convenient

there are moments where

it would be good that my thoughts

shouldn't be a thing

[Music]

but it's not secure that you can

understand

[Music]

and then the case for example

now audacity which is an audio editing

software you can change the scale like

the size of elements in UI

which can be useful sometimes

and when you undo those changes or also

on on

which can be a bit weird what's also

weird is that those changes does not

count towards the undo

and so when you press undo it will both

change the size of whatever you are

seeing you change the size of and on the

Last Action at the same time

that's

tell me a bit unexpected

[Music]

but the question remains written what

would it cosplay as

this one is a bit tricky to

[Music]

um

foreign

with you cosplay

to and visit my family

dressed as an Umbreon

yes

um

everyone comes cosplaying

oh well I guess

I guess we're doing this though

[Music]

there's another polygons select

unless I don't have to select every

single individual one second day

I guess that was part of the Sun

I don't know which songs

I also don't know if it's the starter in

the design

at least that I should be able

anyway did I select everything now one

more not done yet uh

that's

that means that it's soon after four

o'clock again

starts when adds a plane and

you say that an EV or else

that sounds nice

you'll be a sprigatito and I'll be as

prietita

I still argue that

[Music]

I said that I said argue that Pokemon

should change name based on gender if

that's relevant to the name such as

brigators

[Music]

if that's the name

and

scarado miascarada

there you go

[Music]

[Music]

what's the wind is how

it being made is

yeah but that's already

[Music]

and yeah I mean I couldn't already did

that but they are causing that separate

Pokemon

they are they are they are different

species gender exclusives species but

they are different species

[Music]

but yeah it's very nice that it's still

stuck on the party let me see

there's a minute

there we go

is outfit

nice texture

this makes sense around

this does not make much sense

and also on this outfit the Coco has

these things on their ears

there are lots of arrows on this one

you're gravity based

[Music]

and

yeah I don't see anything

there you go I like some black

explaining it

so

let's duplicate bunny

this will be the bottom

gravity body

[Music]

and I should create a new outfit here

called

gravity

gravity gravity with titties

[Music]

and

name this thing outfit

there's an outfit is an infant

kitties

on that

this style sign of the Apex of one

point's ears can you speak English

words an option

very cute

yes

[Music]

oh it wasn't there

oh this is floating

yes they are

they are technically not connected

I guess that's

gravity-defying outfit

that will be hard to cosplay

I would I would I want cosplay the

gravity suit including the floating

panels

[Music]

not after me

sorry I don't know what happened to me

[Music]

um

and I'm not anatomically and chicken

I don't know that's not how it will be

faced

that's why I pressed it that way

so this one has been launched

so it

that's that's the air key

and that's the control there

so

this axis

the separate this smell

but yeah it's used for extensive unit

for now

[Music]

Rock him all close this down far Apex

top Etc

what I saw you saying

oh I saw that kids okay I got to go now

I hope you have fun with the rest of the

stream it was really fun watching

YouTube it's really morning you're very

amazing

bye kitten bye bye

something only loud to the phone

all right everyone is back by the way

[Music]

since the uh

the countries up to nine views now

so what do you say

put those on the far side of the top of

Ponto news was that hard to say

one by far side you mean

what do you mean by

doing outside

[Music]

foreign

but like um

because they're supposed to be this Arab

shape I want that right here

I guess I could do like

multiple arrows or something

but I could look with that huge over

here

yeah something like this one

yeah

and I actually I put this stuff from an

art

it was very habitat that would be at the

end

okay

[Music]

well I guess I guess

I guess there's a lot of cute too but

yeah I guess that's the tip of the ears

[Music]

it still makes sense I'll get to that

eventually

yo

[Music]

it's very jazzy music

[Music]

I hope you enjoyed some day

research I can say that it's worth Jazz

but I think the title of something else

on some other songs but

related to Jazz

that is black

Jazzy night

[Music]

foreign

hey

Rosie welcome welcome

I am working on this

quantum

still working

I've done like two more cheats

I guess you could ever landed one of the

things again so far

which is one of the powers the powerapps

again is most important for it to work

I don't want on to turn into cocoa as

soon as our part of his name

that would be weird

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

cheapness please

oh well do I do I have an offer for you

or only

[Music]

2500 Euro

you can get your own one meter tall one

plus that you can cuddle as much as you

want

[Music]

I don't know

a company might be willing to make

[Music]

that's it uneven

[Music]

you're just myself

[Music]

yeah

guns are nice

if the person is cuddly which I assume I

assume Mickey is very curly

[Music]

[Music]

now let's try

so this is the way it begins

I am

[Music]

it sounds like

sounds like someone has a screwed that

[Music]

let's cuddle

[Music]

you can

for the seventh year I'm not thinking

about it when I said 2500

[Music]

actually

[Music]

and that was for Flash by the way

that wasn't even to get together

oh it is

a parameter tall pump on flash which

which is

switchable

hey ready to

Eddie time my first posture is over and

now my my outfit disappeared how did

that happen so weird

[Music]

my underwear exposed

and someone's okay

and of all the 11 people watching at the

moment someone might be playing the

stream with audio and it just got to be

really awkward

Heaven bananas do the clothes change

when the timer is done there's nothing

that's the prescription

foreign

[Music]

but I don't know how

I do know someone who does have a time

to put outfits

maybe I could ask

[ __ ] that's been I haven't seen her

streaming for a long time

it's because I haven't been able to

catch um

which is because she hasn't been

streaming for a long time I would like

to read too though

because I've never done that I would

like to train everyone in once

maybe she said that she took uh yeah she

hasn't been streaming for two months now

please be it is possible that she said

that she would be gone for it

foreign

that's life sometimes

thank you

this black suit really makes her

breasts always knees

experience

maybe she just should maybe one of the

outfits should just be a black suit like

this black island with suit is the

correct term

but yeah just this as an outfit

and then I'm

streaming 621

6 hours 21 minutes 30 seconds

oh yeah we've asked the actual Talking

stream is 2014 so I don't know what

you're doing

but yeah I know I've been over six hours

and

but I'm still

I'm still

going I'm still going

[Music]

a man stop me

do it do

fives success

And subscribe give subscriptions or even

subscriptions okay here or your own

subscriptions anyway

can we spin the wheel

still haven't implemented them really

[Music]

so many things I want to do but

yeah

yes I'm not satisfied but it's

definitely been

like uh it's just that I want as much as

possible

that's my issue

[Music]

I guess I could just delete the other

one inside Maybe

and it depends on where it is could be

tricky to do

well I could almost do

a little bit more carefully your kid

probably

[Music]

man came out of the department what did

you do in there

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

that's nothing strange is going on

[Music]

sometimes it gets me

[Music]

yeah I guess I guess that'll do

nothing getting a drink okay

man

would like a black suit like this be

good as an outfit it would be like a

[Music]

spices right here

sneaking through night both of this can

is bulging so I can't put it down on it

and spill whatever if it can hit this

side there

and of course you might say it wasn't

signed that way

and

I mean uh probably not however

there are still companies that do design

stuff

with the intention of such things

maybe not tonight

I wouldn't be surprised that a company

would make make it

can not be able to set it down because

every people eventually need to hold it

so you have to consume it and if you do

want your both hands-free you have to

consume it quickly and because he

conceived it quickly he had to get

another one

that would totally be something

accompany with this

because every guy is crazy for a

sharpness but

yeah not a suit I mean like you know

body black bodies thing that's matte and

it shows off my curves

you mean you can have extra liquid for

you to drink oh yeah that's how it works

right

yeah it's a top reference okay

do they talk about sharp stressed

buttons

who knows and sends it up

[Music]

[Music]

there you go

[Music]

the next question is because everything

girls is crazy super sharpness man

[Music]

questions

did this guy in gender neutral sense or

uh main sense in your version

I don't know

let's not take that question series I

think

but you know I'm crazy for you everyone

is crazy for me

Mickey

I have to set up like five dates for

myself here

I can keep making my USB not interested

in that man I don't know I'm

just just just being friendly you know

[Music]

that doesn't mean just anything else

going on

anyway let me see if I can

get rid of as much inside as possible

inside

it's close in here

and okay

this is

a half an hour everything

so

yeah

and everything is left on me on the way

okay

we can have three minutes out no yeah

it's much because the computer is

getting very warm and slow at the moment

I really need some heat things I didn't

know where to get that

something to keep Computing because it's

very

performance having yeah everything

you run the blender

and

Photoshop and stuff

[Music]

decision breaking yeah

that's everything

yeah

um

it wasn't twitch breaking it was the

stream it was me streaming uh I just had

some it's just at that point in the

Stream and probably we can see computer

can't do more at this point

and kind of

definitely pushing it yeah

so what did he say

yeah

uh thank you for the nice coffee Supreme

later I learned it with the layer upon

fund

instead of refreshing yes you don't have

and you don't have to do that either you

can't wait to change the content but you

can pause and unpause that will also

refresh the Stream
