foreign

let's

what's going on here

two months of subscriptions

with

this the uh

because I thought I don't remember

I think she don't remember what it said

when you scared first time

so anyway there you have the

Chinese restaurant but yeah

this subscribe for multiple months right

that way or did I miss Maybe

or maybe it just was one month I don't I

don't remember

but if it's something you have to

activate each month or something

I subscribe for multiple so is this just

when the second month begin or so

website helping things

or did you add additional champions

it doesn't say that it's

added any

so I guess it was eating that

so

[Music]

does it does it show the I can see does

it have it yes second mouth is now okay

suggests

as you see the cursor

kids

and depending on the groceries we

second month is now

I could have something more interesting

but

okay that's a bunny

foreign

oh yeah and one more thing

I prepared in

my hands

I don't know if it seems to be too loud

or something

it's very quiet anyway yes

um

noise in the background

that's in music

yeah

that's t

I tried to find something that was

I could play on stream

yes twitch has

a library of music you can play on

stream but the problem is that you

cannot have it in your video after

this stream is over like in the

published video afterwards but I don't

want to mess with having like two

versions or something like that

foreign

way

that is too annoying

so I just want to play something that

then will be in the video afterwards

that I can't hire in the videos

so what are you drawing today you're

asking that like I've been drawing

we've been trying before

so

what I wanted to draw

now I should have my reference pictures

which I forgot to say but something

and partly made this debit

so let me handle that

[Music]

and I'm gonna listen to this music I

actually don't know what it sounds like

but presumably it's

safe

even though I listed as streamers

anyway so anyway anyway

yeah let's call this photo references

yeah

I'm saying these pictures

so I can access them

without having

the browser running taking up a lot of

networking stuff

so how are you

well I missed the original stream I was

going to do today that was a bit silly

of me

probably

set the music a little bit high

but this song is even nowaday come on

[Music]

the previous one

[Music]

thank you

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

that will do

so

I can create a folder which I called

references which I put this

now that open it is a separate image

that it wasn't exactly where I wanted

again not what I wanted

support

why is it doing this this is really good

if that's what I want to do

[Music]

and then I will add this one

in the file name

this character form

to do

basically like fan art

they probably recognize this strategy

[Music]

right nice one for news

and

it's our first early references I don't

wish I had like

sometimes I wish I had a second screen

but this is what I have to work

this is a large Secret

how how

that's the next question which I have

not

no answer oh slash on the compress it to

each other yes just hit slowly

and how and Bonnie

and how large are they compared to

pumpkin

like this seems like uh

maybe terminology

North I can do that

and fun fun I don't think fun fun is

that much larger I mean

that might be a little too large

[Music]

maybe like that

maybe editor

the poem foreign

how tall

but

that's about the size of Grandpa

I don't know

I cannot just decide this afterwards

there's no problem

but I think what I think I did was that

I put

again Bonnie on top of Lolly

and then I use that as the reference

where we thought how tall what one

should be

is that a good way of doing it

oh yeah it's a 28th today that was a

month ago you I'm a bit behind the

feeling

but I feel like I'm always a bit behind

said

[Music]

where's the

two and four

effective

this is short for that too

make a bit larger Maybe

yes I imagine lovely being

small

and cute

[Music]

don't worry you're okay

[Music]

that she should have clouds being clear

that they don't know

they create a folder that used to have

sketch

that's not how you spell sketch that's

how it's been sketching that one that's

each

okay now it's working what's working now

yeah problem

do you have a problem now they have like

network issues

so like on one heads is like that size

party is but like what posts you see her

like

I haven't posted it I'm like I have an

idea for what I should draw but

[Music]

um

[Music]

went to a lot of circus I'm like yeah

for the longest time I have studied

transmission has ended my transmission

what's going what

what is that

that's Mickey and now it's that Mick m

redmi game

Nick M what's your nickname what's your

nickname very cute Zona

thank you

[Music]

oh wait you Swedish

I am Swedish

do you happen to live close to Sweden

[Music]

oh

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

in that case we can have some secret

chatting here

yes I am a bunny

and then in case

hydrate

first hydrate for the day first hydrate

by you

the October in this one's guess yeah

[Music]

yeah

um

[Music]

no I know so so anyways

anyway

so yes this is my my which is obvious

because of the in the corner which

is fine

I'm going to draw a picture of her

I am not like an amazing artist

and I do a lot of circles to get an idea

of where I will put things

this is a

long idea which is

another person

she's a rabbit as well and she's an

amazing swimming

I love watching her videos

and

so

I currently seven I wanted to draw like

it would be like a fan art but

um

lonely together

where she could sing such moments

because this is like this is that this

is not just a sketch this is a

rough

yeah it is it's a it's a rough sketch

I usually talk more English than Swedish

as myself Jimmy oh I yeah I wouldn't be

surprised I mean I probably been

speaking English

since I've been streaming for

actually two almost two months now I I'm

flies

time share price

yeah

[Music]

even though I do think

[Music]

avoiding

split compounds uh does make certain

things more clear in Communications two

minds nice

no that's not oh oh oh no

I am proud of you thank you

foreign

I am a

doing something on stream

so uh

well well

if you're Swedish you're obviously

Riyadh Meek m

M that doesn't make sense

that's not what your name says

do you have like a what what's like your

preferred nickname

and did you find me by browsing like art

or something

this is my very first art stream

the

[Music]

see how it goes

doesn't feel right

[Music]

it feels very

darts and

okay

let me see

yeah I would need the sun Master now put

this

um should I translate this for people

there for other people whenever it's

finished would you which is perfectly

fine it's just a question

um

because I could translate it

Avia

[Music]

it's no English but

[Music]

and what I can do Swedish obviously uh

doing eating English is more

[Music]

Minds it's yeah if let's say Asana back

on track

record I was thinking about the nickname

that I would work with your username

here on Twitch so if I

because I mean it's fine if you don't

want that

and because in this

confusing when I watch other streams

when they use a different nickname that

has nothing to do with their username

me yeah sure Mickey that's kind of what

I

I thought I would say Mickey is safer

because

the likelihood of someone else having

the real name having a nickname red is

more likely than make it so

yeah I'm silly

and I I always afraid when I have a

topic

as I was going to say

if if people know English I would say

it's better to stick with English since

that makes it more

access accessible

or more people

and

which makes more people being able to

follow along

but in the case that someone doesn't

know

English and only Swedish which is

blackly never going to happen

I can't do Swedish for that person

that's no problem

but they're starting them going to

happen

easy for them to know what you and I and

other are saying yeah exactly

and if it's something private you always

even for today

and then

there are multi-language streams but

they usually end up being

I so far honestly what language streams

right

between English and another language

but it usually ends up being mostly the

other language

yeah I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing

at the moment

foreign

[Music]

as I don't know

[Music]

this is something

[Music]

look at the slice uh anyway

so I was thinking she would hold

so this one which I never mentioned

[Music]

well I think I think I think

yeah

it is but

which I should also say by the way

it

try it winter

create a new folder because it's my very

first stream which I called

streets bump on streams

and this is let's call it by today's

date just three or five with eight

and then

description name of it

first of all I thought you spoke pretty

amazing English so I didn't hear you I

speak Swedish but as soon as I saw the

tag I started listening class tonight

assistant

yeah it does Sweden if you go to the

about page it also says Sweden

so it's not a secret I mean I could I

wouldn't be able to see you especially

if I had a redeemed

to change

with Swedish friends

there I got

okay it doesn't have many redeems at the

moment

this stuff

all right I'm a silly I just saw the

timers yeah most people don't check that

back [ __ ] and

although your back page should be the

page that is open when you check it it

depends on where you are if you're on

mobile

hey

consider about page I think well it's

annoying to check them out which I think

[Music]

thank you

I was thinking pumpkin like

funny

[Music]

I mean I can't hide all this it's easy

to see what I'm doing but I also prefer

to

go to make a list wrap sketch

kitchen

[Music]

such a mess of nice at the moment

how long are these years if the head is

this big

a membership

if the head is this beach

the ear is like one and a half heads

something but the others bent

so maybe the total length is like a hit

[Music]

yeah

you're really good at the sketch space I

think that's what it's called now this

is a rough skit

that's what it is

[Music]

I guess you're right

I'm not really following every way right

I mean you should have a general deal

which way the character sleep

foreign

foreign

[Music]

every day

[Music]

you sound rather alright

wait I missed the message oh thanks I'm

kind of running Jason

you sound clear yeah yeah exactly I I

assumed I assume this would make me

clear

which uh which I usually do and I've

noticed that there is a difference in my

streams when I forgot to put this back

from like this it's a

it's basically a noise canceling setup

uh

a noise dampening

whatever it's called

[Music]

kittens

[Music]

yeah

noise canceling yes

it's um

there's probably a proper name for it

and it's dampening the noise it's inside

ah

container

and it's actually a cardboard box with

two large pillows inside it's it's very

primitive

so so that's my setup or noise canceling

[Music]

all right and

it doesn't really that sweaty

yeah so

I don't actually know how to try this

oh my kid said

it's um

yeah and also shoes

and Bunny shoes

I don't know I didn't want to do that

right with that and

thank you yeah this isn't a very high

resolution picture but

funny she's

[Music]

yeah yeah I'm still a bit confused about

how I would do the

[Music]

head posts

yeah

[Music]

but I'm

not of course I have no idea

[Music]

be fully from the side I think

[Music]

I have a separate layer but it doesn't

matter because no no

not that much

[Music]

this is just the rough parts of it

fits the bunny very very perfectly also

the colors look cute it's yeah the mint

pink scheme

scheme even

it's a great combination

[Music]

her whole channel has a very nice

clean

[Music]

okay

the difference

Mario

um

small legs

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

thank you

I mean yeah

I had an idea for what I wanted the

picture to be but then I could have

forgot what the picture one was going to

be

and then I got another idea

but that idea kind of is

I'm always confused that's I'm a

constant state of confusion

so many ideas you can do

it's I wish I had many ideas is that

well I guess I have any ideas it's just

that I keep forgetting what the ideas

are

and that's my problem

and I also don't have a proper table to

put the drawing it's actually

sitting in my lap it's slipping off

foreign

Ty to show up

oh no don't drop the drawing tablet

there I'm planning on not dropping it

you know

kind of

my bad idea to drop it

oh yeah now I remember what's supposed

to do let me put this in photoshopping

as now it's this one was Darkness

this is learning

this which is only two responsible thing

is

[Music]

governmental name is bonbon

but going with the nickname

money because

I can't do this

[Music]

now I remember the time was supposed to

do

come closer

is this the size difference between them

and I can I ask a bit of a

sweet spell Vibe at the moment

yeah

so

so what I want to do

is

something like

can she reach up

and maybe

um

[Music]

and what does her hands actually looks

like

uh and and then

I could have uh yeah I could basically

hide the hand behind

oh it's uh you sorry I missed a message

and what cat what type of drawing time

is it I don't know

it's just a basic Wacom Bamboo fan

I'm Just Landing it

and then and determined amount of time

character

oh I started to play half day

music track not about to restart it but

I haven't preparing more physique

well and yes I was going to

put did I close it I mean yeah up

closely let's open anyone

uh

let's just go to one of those videos

[Music]

oh nice well if you accidentally drop it

or it breaks I can just

wait sorry we just started playing sorry

uh I can just send you my spare one

that's all sealed oh bison bought an

extra because I thought I lost my pen

but I found

oh

well it's I guess good to have one in

research

is it cheaper to buy a whole new tablet

than just another pen

I wouldn't be surprised I mean that's

kind of like how

print is work

if you get like

depending on what

type of painting it

uh like ink based printers are really

expensive for the ink so it's better to

go with that place I don't know I don't

print I don't know

oh

I think pink could be cheaper but I

didn't find any storms been selling it

yeah in that case you have to order a

line and in that case it might even be

more expensive free shipping and

everything so I did not want to talk why

would shipping costs yeah and then

flipping costs import fees

it could end up more expensive than her

new time it is better at my time it's

very it is very kind of you offering to

do that and then

[Music]

but I will try to hit this one uh

working for as long as I can

now hopefully no worries

on that

you're eating you always write about New

York your drawing tablet sounds nice I

just got a new telephone it's a very

very base it works that's the most

important I don't know what resolution I

think it has

and but and there's probably not any

it's 60 million per million

um

it doesn't really

is made in China

it is specifically the CTE 650

right

[Music]

if animal is curious

and then it's like slash W for some

reason

okay

well uh yeah well this channel companies

sell tablets about a good price what's

800.

crowns eight years I should try to

yeah I mean that's that's not expensive

at all not so I guess it's it's a basic

one

like them and the basic

you know what

[Music]

is the I was going to say A4 paper it is

not an a for paper it's definitely this

morning but it's the proportion of the

that that paper standard I wait

foreign

it is 222 millimeters so it is actually

taller than me no wait no it's not on it

I'm stupid A4 is 297. this is 220 tip so

it is smarter than me right I started

the wrong direction and A4 is

297 times 210 and this is 222.

times

1038

which is not A4 right

[Music]

I mean it's not a full payment

it is not

um

because 297 / 210 is yeah that's that is

the uh

square root of two and then but this

proportion is

[Music]

a widescreen 16 16x9

that is not real either

it's a kind of a weird proportion

yeah making it make actually making it

A4 would be bad

because if you want it to track the

whole screen because an A4 is

more squared than a white screen on my

screen meaning that you get them either

you get parts of the screen not working

and another part of the tablet end up

being used

what you get

another other

in this because I'm doing white screen

on

since this

tablet

that doesn't make much damage whatever

her work um

into this S60 do you know what 69 is if

that's what you're asking if you what

this s69 standard white skin like

uh 1920 times 1080 full HD

and it would make sense for drone tablet

to be that because that's basically what

most computer screens are

like most people draw on like I think B4

is the common one to draw because like

between A4 and A3 exactly a4s B2

spawning so it's a bit too big

it's a compromise

ah

with making it that

aspect ratio would

it would just

not make it fit in yeah

screen

so anyway when I did

analyze this tablet I noticed that as I

move the cursor to the top and bottom of

this area on the tablet it goes to the

edge of the screen but if I do it on the

sides it hits the edge of the screen a

bit before I reach the edge of the

thumbs

okay

so let me get a

screenshot of that

of her hands

which she has this

uh

let me see

and this is I'm still doing looking for

references

let me watch this one

I didn't use that audio because it

no that's the same now let's tell you

that doesn't help me I got one reference

anyway let me put it in the

drawing

and then that was the copies and then

I'll get back to the chat

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

there's a stream

[Music]

that's her

I don't know I wrote in the chat anyway

so I didn't miss anything

nice oh

[Music]

it's uh what basically has seen is candy

and cloud-based

another that's me speaking about

makes my voice

I feel like I should have even gotten

used to speaking for like a few months

now but

foreign

[Music]

yeah

let's watch the stream while we're

streaming

so how about you

I am all okay it's happy ending it

without you

you're doing great fun a kitten is the

wrong viewer again

Cloud annoys me the most because it

covers turkey games like stupid Potter

information there

[Music]

let's move it up a bit

put it here put names here

anyway you know that that's not what I

wanted in this one here is no that was

invert that's not that's that was not

what I wanted

I wanted a picture of her

and it's

foreign

hands

which kind of makes sense

they look a bit freaky they sounded

because of due to the very large sweater

which

yeah I have to have them I can watch

this

and I get

even though I get get my words correct

yeah we understand it's just funny

English is a different language plus

you're typing it up for one which

is it always the easiest type on

yes if I like to do this fight like this

yes it's nice for you to increase

we like it when you're doing it

[Music]

then it should be like a hand here

that some would be there and then it's

one two three four

plus some

beautiful drawing

okay now it's getting really sick that

goes like

these fingers are very thin

it doesn't matter because most of the

things are going to be hidden anyway

I'm going to do

bear heads

and this this one basically this

so

[Music]

heat them basically

it should be

[Music]

something something

better to take the heads too large

that's not how much it they sounded very

much

like if that's the top of the head

yeah and it's too large

no problem this is

this is the hand

this is the hair

[Music]

it makes me

think on the head or anything

try to

be mindful

I don't know what I'm saying

something like that maybe

foreign

[Music]

I don't know if you

yes and because what this uh unscreen

keyboards on the phone what they like to

do is try to combine languages and a lot

of the keyboards try to do that and I

don't like it

[Music]

so uh

I just

I try to keep them separate and then I

switched language whenever I want to

write another language I usually don't

switch languages that often so that's

perfectly fine

so if you have like Spanish English

language

I could see that Crossing is just when

typing

[Music]

that's a nice stupid phone

but it is I'm always doing good even on

my birthdays I got a really good friend

who helps me out when I'm down

you have good friends

my phone is in Spanish but 460 ignition

it doesn't work what

I mean the keyboard has nothing to do

with the headphone itself

[Music]

I I have my

I have my okay wait

let me know my voice today is not good

[Music]

now I had my phone in Swedish

even though I understand English

perfectly fine and I usually like a

computer in Swedish and I

run most software in Swedish

like Steam for example and that's

usually because

of

the joke I like to make is basically I

don't live in the United States

therefore I speak Swedish which

obviously doesn't make sense unless you

have the context that is because a lot

of software only offers English that is

designed for United States

and

that can cause a lot of confusion

in certain cases like if you use steam a

steam of only office uh English for

United States and if you choose English

regardless when you while you are they

are going to assume you're in the United

States and offer for example if they

have an event upcoming event they will

keep it in the times well it's time

senior assist and Canada technically

and that's what they will give

and

but I don't want that I don't know what

those time cells are

and having to compare it every time it's

annoying so if I set steam to Swedish

I get the ads or like events and stuff

and they will give the date and times in

the Swedish time zone which is most of

Europe

and it would be nice if they could

do something about that but

moved out

steam is such a huge market like a store

on

a computer a Windows on computer

scientific including Mac and Phoenix

that

and similarly on the on the Discord does

offer like British English as an option

but I still use Swedish because then it

like

it just makes

like dates I prefer reading dates the

Swedish year months they order

it is

like today

to 33

5

to eight

this is not confusion of how to read

this I always write it here in four

digits and restituting

it's very annoying

because on Discord you get a day like

zero seven slash zero five

slash two three

this could be read in

especially if it's like an old date

if you like

if you change this one to cr9 actually

yesterday

that's your mind

it could be the seventh of May 2009

it could be

July the 5th 2009

and it can also be the 9th of May 2007.

so yeah

that's why I stick with this one

and that's why I use Swedish because

that's when I most often get but that's

some random fact it doesn't have a long

explanation for why it runs up with me

it is basically because some people find

it weird that I do that

I like like

Malaya do you understand it I mean so

let's go over to

sketch TV

positivity frames oh it's nice yeah I

like busy I want to stay positive

I mean I can

I can still like uh complain about stuff

but I try to be

like a criticism and my feedback stuff

like that

but I mean I'm still happy but since

it's not like

there are options I'll be selected

anyway uh happiness caring and being

there is always good yeah

[Music]

I hope this shows up well on stream okay

okay

let's see it's good enough

[Music]

oh that's not

witness that's

it make let's make it like that

I got a really good friend and we talked

for hours when we're not doing anything

but that really helps me out but yeah

that sense

that sounds really nice

let's keep having talks and conversation

can always be really fun and then that's

why this is the way I wanted to stream

even though it's

possibly speaking is one way

it does uh they're still having

conversations

and it also helps that

I guess the benefit of me speaking is

that I can still

again for example still draw I don't

have to stop drawing just to type or

something

[Music]

and getting to meet nice people

and that's not how it looks

[Music]

that must be too much

then we should add these details that is

this step or not

now they should be further out

after this I wanted this to be more

forward

maybe not too much out it's a bit

[Music]

it says four

subscription bits

now it counts the three subscriptions

which is yours which is and the two

gifts I assume that's myself 75 I don't

know how to it doesn't really make it or

it does it okay like four more than

making sense

[Music]

it is like you can add a message and

stuff I haven't really

created any of that

I can always say that your message not

me

maybe that other comments animes you

don't need to pay to have your messages

read

[Music]

they're like

yeah I think that's more of a

with the game at three minutes became BK

they can't really just out every message

because

the message there's just too many

messages

okay this message

it's now being read

[Music]

I find it fun and I liked it out

yeah that's it I forgot to check

but I can actually no I can't change

from this one that's bad

is this one after updated

um

okay no I didn't want to do that

[Music]

but I can't do it from this actually

[Music]

nothing minimize this again but it meant

oh it is this button

[Music]

I should be able to see it from this

menu

how do you do it

why not

what is this this

one maybe it wasn't this many

I'm looking around

[Music]

was it this menu no it's not this many

probably seen this

[Music]

because I can like play a random one

is not following which of course that's

my goodness

but um

yeah I thought I could replay one like

after the existing ones but

they didn't give me the option I don't

know why

I can't yeah

[Music]

anyway since you did the 100 again yeah

it doesn't change so it can't

I have 400 bits to be equal to one

subscription

okay

so there is one thing I wanted to do I

have still not completely done it so

while we're well it's on the topic I

created

a wheel

which

isn't it showing up

and then we

[Music]

my symptoms always showing that what

does the wheel hate me

it's weird

[Music]

I can hide things

that's not what's up it is really is

about this is weird why doesn't it show

up

[Music]

it's not like a and thank you now it

shows up

[Music]

I had another numbers that was just

sorting it I forgot to remove the

numbers

I think this should be a clip for what

I'm going to break the time down you can

I mean I can really like

marching it's very long moments I don't

think it can work as a clip but we can

try

oh

oh oh

that's weird so the idea here is that

because I saw another streamer do that

basically two streams to be fine and do

you

um

it's a bit hard to read the text when I

add this

yeah I didn't want to reset this chat

you wanted the team again

do you find the distance that the text

should be easier to read because it's

larger you don't see the whole wheel but

I think that's fine

oh my island is feeling well yeah I've

seen it here before

so basically

so one streamer that's like after five

subscription it technically five Subs

gifts

another one that's like diamond property

does gifts too but personally I don't

have is a gift or a knot if you said yes

the subscription in general I was

thinking like after five of them I would

do a spin or something

it's still not done because there are

still things on the screen that I

haven't I'm not

probably not good

[Music]

I miss Kids Corner I haven't seen

nothing yeah no one I think

baby

it's a

if you do want suggestions to it before

you before you give to someone

maybe no no they're not on this list

anymore

already because it's barely

let alone remember what his name is

[Music]

getting close

so yeah let's just show the real spin

this is not a real spin let's make that

clear

in that case I can make this wheel stop

as well

so it doesn't spin around yeah and the

numbers are not supposed to be there in

the end when it's done but I need more

ideas there maybe has some ideas

[Music]

try something oh yeah this must be like

good but I mean I mean it does show it

like this this shows up below it does

feel a bit weird when you don't see it

the whole thing

I don't know

[Music]

something good

yeah so

um

yeah let's close that

so here's the current ideas now that we

can see everything

So currently I do have redeems to change

outfits which is

I can show them very shortly it's a it's

a sports frame it's swingery

[Music]

is no clothes

this is an adult stream so it's

perfectly fine this is Now features

don't don't worry it's just creatures

just it's just for fun and very silly

handy

that that is basically is this I give

one for free basically you don't have

spent points but I was thinking either

for a much longer time or basically I

would use this as the default for the

rest of the Stream

but you can still change the outfit but

I will switch back to which I read

messages in here maybe that's a better

idea

and then I offering if something

specifically I give a gift

problem is

am

en

yeah I had damage to work and then we

have a exercise I've seen some

yeah when I remove the numbers when I'm

done it will even see it online so now

it's so blurry

even though it's supposed to be high

quality

um

yeah so

doing it safely exercise I don't have a

camera so you're not going to see me but

uh oh hydrate oh double hydrate sorry

about that everyone now

too much heat but you're crazy

oh

a lot of these users that you have uh

Coco dancing thank you very much for all

these gifts yeah you don't like

a set of stickers all alone

almost yeah yeah you have done you have

given four gifts and one to yourself

that is five that is our third

not amazing

oh yeah I'm just going to ask that's not

the name I recognize

maybe they can show up

rampion has

I think I shown up here yeah she has

shown up here and I watch her she's very

nice

she's Italian she's one of those who

does uh their own music stopped they had

to into your language

um

oh no the image is broken

did that happen

ah welcome

oh yeah and they've wait when did the

first time chat break the

wasn't supposed to override the that it

was a reply

they should work together oh man now I

know that

I guess another market for that

dude

I should have given it to me

and then a second marking

that yeah indeed yeah Miss kid Quest

been here before which whoever watched

and then there is

oh my God active

wait a minute

now it doesn't say

what

I am

the dinosaur says that you gave a

community gift

it doesn't say who got it

oh that's Shane hello welcome to the

drawing stream when I go into my wheel

at the moment

so

for because I was thinking after five

subscriptions for example if the gifts

or not or after I said My Little Bits I

will have like a County

yeah

that takes care of that so

and then I'll do a spin so draw

something is basically because I most

play games this is my very first drawing

stream the idea here is that people give

some so if this comes up people and my

idea is that people will give some ideas

in a chat I'll pick up some that I like

and then I will run a poll

so people can vote for their favorites

and then so there will be multiple I

wish I could do multi options

but because I can't see that my distance

I'll pick up the two most of the four

and then you get to vote again for those

two or something maybe that's a good

idea

and then after my gaming stream which is

probably what I'm going to do at the

muffin I will then draw that thing

[Music]

it does push the next intended ads

further along so I guess you get

something from it and also call

something someone might not something

called someone that would be an actual

voice chat during this dream I need to

find a way to actually do that in a

convenient way

because when I do stream I do close down

basically everything

but the stream seems to be quite stable

at moment

s but if you're playing a game on the

computer I do cluster and everything

it's me man I'll find a way that's no

problem uh

and the numbers will be removed and then

five minutes Swedish that's because

people have asked me to have a redeem

but I will speak Swedish I think it's a

terrible idea because no one will

understand me and having it as a redeem

seems

like a very bad idea so I add this to

the wheel is that that is so you'll get

it this way instead and then the last

one

is this is plus two spins so you will

use up this bin so you don't have any

spins left unless I mean if you give 10

Subs in that case you have two spins

so after using up your one of your spins

it will add two spins because

I have seen

uh some having like a Reese black spin

again but that's

that's like not even having this as an

option this is like if this option is

stand split further into all these other

options

but but that's why I make it this is

that so you actually get something from

it and then it's repeated just to make

the sizes smaller and the reason for

that is repeating three times because I

got one extra and strip if it lands on

this the stream here stands

foreign

almost immediately after landing on that

one

but I need more of this I feel like this

is too few I need

if you have any ideas

I'm open for ideas

so this is opportunity

that's what I wanted

as soon as someone

someone actually wants to change that do

you like that animation by the way

so I did one of the hydrates

so I can do the other hydrator

the other hybrids

it's nice thank you thank you

I don't know it's just hydrated

I do it again

and what's the timeout for the

highlights

two minutes

yeah don't use it

oh yeah and then I need to change that

sorry I don't I'm not trying much at the

moment

I have stuff to do

these if I change this will it change

the current timing

because it should be 50 minutes

30 minutes

[Music]

at that last one

[Music]

thank you

did it change the timer yes it did

[Music]

good

[Music]

now

a package drawing

and now how long are you getting

distracted by

Jean stuff

how do you add too many layers but it's

better to have a Day Too Much than

having a day

[Music]

right

problem because I want it to be like

more front facing

circuit Maybe

I don't know would it show up on the

other side

maybe maybe like that

not that part

[Music]

thick

maybe something like that could work

I can duplicate the ear as well

this is everyone is still a sketch

[Music]

other the whole pose companies doing

might not be the realistic as it is

[Music]

put on this in the folder

[Music]

so I hope this is a

cursive string

[Music]

how do

[Music]

you how do you enjoy this

[Music]

and not

never relaxes me let's do it

that's how I like it

been on the mainstream for one and a

half hours

that's

it feels like it's been lucky

yeah that's that's the difference

one pun is a very a lot of these

features are very thick

legs and thick toes

sick fingers

big face no that's a thick ears

my Lolly has very steam Legacy

in the fingers

no my face is roughed

and the ears are

proportionally they become seen because

due to an online

[Music]

and also uh

sick body and because of this that's

mostly mostly due to the sweater more

than me

more than the body itself she might be

she might be very seen

I'm back my dinner girl you didn't say

you went away

now we missed all the fun stuff

that's fine

when someone said I did say

yeah I said how

Bigfoot on this everything is faking

good and fingers while learning is very

thin everything

but even though ears might look sick and

in the ears I think pompan still have

seeking yes them lonely

but consider how long the ears are they

become thin

so I would say that's like

difference

I can kind of see the difference here in

the sketch as well

and I went back to

because this

bring this here

let me get an idea

it should be like

[Music]

tracing everybody on Earth which is not

like my own ass in I paid for it

I haven't not not drawn this

am I not trying I'm not

let's be clear

but I paid to use it so

that's the type thing you need

something looks nice

if you I'm very happy with how she

turned out I basically just give

the artist I contacted

Violet Echoes and infinity

and the game at least off

preferences basically

and

and this is there that's what I got so

I'm happy

it's other hand that doesn't seem good

this this seemed like a good hand

that's a terrible at hand

some awful hands

I don't like it

terrible

but how do I draw hands

[Music]

that's like strange

[Music]

yeah this is supposed to be a higher

looking

uh I just

I

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

now

[Music]

don't mind what this thumbnail looks

like that's

it it leaves a bit suspicious I would

say

all this work

would be like

something like that maybe

foreign

looks like she's

nice

that's actually

this makes me look terrible

couldn't it could have been worse

okay you're drawing a cute mess on the

highest level you want

but if you know it was wrong why why you

wrote the whole and yes I know I used

the wrong door and it's yours instead of

just correcting your story you hadn't

sent the message yet

foreign

yeah this whole thing is upset here

I need to correct that

that's what slips what is looking so we

don't know

that's it now I'm silly yes you are

silly

that's what we like we are silly around

these areas

oh yes

we are here to be silly

if you're not silly you're not allowed

to be here

okay

foreign

views on

the

sacred three separities on the Stream

coming together as one

where did I see

no no I didn't block it I didn't want to

selection

[Music]

foreign

a bit more forward like this

well question is

um

back

we said that's a good rule me and kitten

is very silly you are both very silly

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

oh

something something that I guess maybe

it really works

uh I should probably started duping

these into even

are they

definitely

[Music]

toilets

I'm just sure it's ever going to be done

they're going to be done with this

drawing

today

but I can continue

[Music]

maybe tomorrow

or Wednesday I don't have any steam

plans for Wednesday

[Music]

foreign

so I need

I need that but

[Music]

[Music]

very nice one

I assumed as much about my pronunciation

nothing but

but you probably

you probably find it but very nice too

to be honest

foreign

[Music]

oh my you know what I like

I knew I know what you like

I mean

canine

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

the dress over this

[Music]

and canine

relaxing happy face and mouth yeah it's

it's definitely a relaxed one but you

know the

[Music]

um

it's funny to pronounce them anyway

I only pronounce the ooVoo once so

[Music]

oh

[Music]

oh

[Music]

well in that case

[Music]

oh oh well

now you have a pink message

what I see on the stream icing

you see what's on stream is what you see

yes

multiple calendar bunnies

if McKay uses the

highlight my message

it should be purple on the chat see I

have more like a dust pink

uh

let me play with the background there

[Music]

because in the twitch chat it's purple

but yeah I can't control that

[Music]

button on screenshot see that no it's

purple

what's that oh oh

[Music]

that's it I never said any girl she

doesn't have any girl

what is the next goal anyway

um because I said that girl according to

a scene that I would get

yeah it was the

you can now give your

members VIPs wait couldn't I already do

that

[Music]

you said that was

[Music]

but yeah it must be an only message

because I'm pretty sure I already had

that

yeah

but racing um

yeah what is the next

that let me do a quick check

open open

I remember was it 15

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

so

this one is completed

[Music]

I can start a new one

what does it saying

which is the next step is 25.

which is 10 more

basically just tracking

yeah

yeah he sounds so silly thank you I try

to be silly I just want to be

relaxed and

doing weird stuff

yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum

kidneys trick too much

[Music]

sick

I'm meowing bunny I'm just reading the

messages here

and someone wrote meow 11 times so I had

to read it 11 times

[Music]

I know

so if you write something silly another

noise I don't know

okay but but tell me what noise does a

bunny make

[Music]

yeah what

what noise should I make

[Music]

one is

[Music]

yeah you're right

I I've seen a real life balance you can

hear them

[Music]

unless you find like prayers instead

they go

haha

[Music]

still stupid

[Music]

yes

[Music]

so I want to

right where's this Terrace

I said you can assume but

now

and then I want to

go I'm not I don't want this like

connected it's

wanted to be like related to that's

where it comes from or something I don't

know what I'm talking about

[Music]

[Music]

keep funny sounds fun fun

yes

I'm unsure how they really sound like so

I'd go with fat and said I was going to

put spooky cute but okay that's a bit

it's too loud

[Music]

I don't know how that sounds outside my

head

I don't want to hear what that sounded

like afterwards

not fun is a cute sound yeah it's it

much much nicer

it sounds cute well I have plate sounds

good

I was afraid they put some cringe

I just want to be happy and cute

that's my girl in life

it's okay to do it I guess

okay some small adjustments the feet and

foot

I want to see a purple message

yeah but

did you make sure I said it correct

number of times

your girl is 0.1 yeah

yeah

it's a fine girl

it's a thank you very much that would go

like that

these are good

nuts

I have succeeded

now

that's a satisfied face

now

I would

I am

[Music]

what would the face look like anyway

so it would be like

thumbnails which is round

and then the mouse

and it's kind of like

that and something like that right

or something I don't know

it doesn't look better before I did that

mixture

there we go

down she is the king that one

but then it should be like sounds like

that right

that doesn't work

I rechecked this one

I mean this is actually not preparing

for bunnies in Swedish I mean

I mean technically

China is

[Music]

and then you can see you have to say

something like

I can't I gave you points back but then

I'll do it

then when we select something like that

is

means it's

which is already a verb word word and a

verb which is basically be able to or

something

oh

that's cute

it's fine now let me find one thing to

redeem there is a few options I'm also

open for audience for redeems

and I'm still open for this for the

wheel as well

and I and when I introduced the wheel I

do want to go through previous uh So

currently we have 15 subscribers

Sub sub points so I I will when I

introduce the wheel I do want to do like

a spin

not not three spins immediately but like

I have like these pins torn up and then

I will do like a spin each day until I

run out of those extras

this will be the retroactive in seconds

[Music]

oh you really want to chase things up I

see that's a great one

it's the uh design for the fish game

I'm thinking about playing the fish game

so I can't change it back to what it was

like the default design

The Bunny Goes

something that could pass very

fastest

in English

with it how am I

how would I

what is even this something

[Music]

what what is to sump

[Music]

to hit someone and something so as to

make us up

[Music]

or pounds

it's only sensitive yeah

and do you and do you want like the

trans

stand and when you say can in English do

you mean like to do

but no you say can no that's

demon can

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

way of doing it

thank you

yeah [ __ ]

is that is that what you want me to say

also it should be tested us

[Music]

now I'm going to teach you Swedish this

is the singular because it's just one

rabbit

is plural

I was just confused by the heart

being delicious

I've been writing to me on Discord I'm

busy

um

someone asking me what my drawing ideas

[Music]

yeah I was never good on grammar in

Swedish I was a great person and it must

be

I

not

I didn't even have those grades when I

went to school

thank you

guys is kind of weird when you asked me

to say something sweet

because it was I intended someone to

like well yeah I think it's social guys

thank you

now ads are playing but we basically

don't have anyone here

these hats

[Music]

thank you thank you for

[Music]

after the drawing and being distracted

by myself

this side of the hike that I was

actually float towards the edge because

that's kind of how

she's supposed to be more four times I

said to myself

okay

to let me correct that

a bit more

and that's my opportunity like that

yeah I'm still learning Swedish I

wouldn't understand that one day uh

I'm not going to keep up

I'm free I'm able to teach you that's no

problem

and if I can learn English then I can

learn Swiss yeah

yeah uh since you said Spanish is your

first language

I would could sing English and Swedish

being a

I mean that's much different from

Spanish so

I don't think either's clips into

Spanish

You could argue English is close because

it has a lot of romance words

but English is such a budget language a

Swedish might be even

English spelling is definitely

[Music]

the only feature I'm missing I would

like to see in Swedish which other

languages have such as Finnish

Hungarian

Japanese in Latin writing but even in

Japanese

um is that they Mark long vows and

Swedish does not

and so

I just wish if Swedish was marking long

vowels

and had a spelling reform we had like a

spelling for me like

1906 and then that was the last formal

proper one and we haven't had one in

over a hundred years I think I think we

need one

foreign

because each vowel has two different

sounds a short and long sound and each

vowel has its own short and long sounds

all that makes sense except for one one

one vowel that has its own two sounds

but then it takes the two sounds from a

different bound and and that's I find

silly

switch isn't too difficult to learn it's

really temporary on your mindset when it

comes to learning languages but someone

who speaks Spanish I think in order to

have them

yeah I think you can break out

I'm not good at English but I'm good in

Spanish but English was hard to learn

even if I make mistakes and I you know

Swedish have a good friend help me out

um

when did you start learning English

by the way

[Music]

that's if you want to say it doesn't

have to

[Music]

you don't have to then I mean it doesn't

have to

but I guess this is Pom-Pom though

yes

there is this but it would be empty but

then it is that part but it won't be

kind of

maybe I could like that's something

I got something there open

don't mind me I'm not being lazy

okay

there we go

and then I will also

draw the action outline

oh and in one minute

so it will look different

English in August of 2004. I

there was a very specific time I I was

asking more like age

I was starting learning English

I don't know I was probably starting to

learn English when I was seven

Maybe

[Music]

that's over 20 years ago

[Music]

and I started speaking out in 2000 yeah

I started actually probably speak

English very late

I knew English I couldn't understand

English and I used English a lot it's

like online through text but her name is

spoke English

pronunciation stuff

[Music]

a representation might still be terrible

I don't know

[Music]

because said that he couldn't exactly

tell them a Swedish unless me he she

sorry you never specified that

but Mickey sounds like a male name too

now the commission from

Michaela so I could be female team

actually

yeah

I mean okay I guess I guess correctly

but I mean I shouldn't just

put that on me

okay he said that

I'm sorry

I mean that was correct this time but it

could be

like

in there see now I'm getting locked up

again as I that he couldn't

my body massage here exactly tell that I

was Swedish

until the year

so I guess

it's not like terribly obvious

but it's probably very obvious that I'm

not a native when we speak

thank you

I would imagine

button sometimes and I'm

foreign

[Music]

Swedish accent

[Music]

because that that would be like a thing

speak with them more obvious Swedish

acts Swedish accent

I don't I don't know

I don't know how when this sounds

it almost sounds it almost sounds more

Norwegian

I I'm speaking I'm speaking English with

a [ __ ] Norwegian accent

hey what are you writing well I heard

you English I thought first since I did

here it was not native yet as you said I

thought you were from like Germany

Vietnam or perhaps the lens

yeah I could see I could see that makes

sense

without that

so nice

[Music]

there's a kind of nice

during High School back in 2005

[Music]

Ireland

Vanishing

Secondary School

did if it's consistent in gymnasium as

it's called in Europe or some fishing

several European languages

and it comes from the meaning of what

English uses gymnasium for

but yeah the secondary school if you

want yeah

I could find because I don't know what

the equivalent equivalent is in

different countries and I also don't

want to but looking up what the

equivalent is in different countries

because

and then I have watches from all kinds

of places around the world so

that wouldn't even be useful I would

have to look up different countries

let's

[Music]

uh there we go

let's let's do some doxing and check

where people are watching from

that that's not taxing let's check the

last

uh 30 days

where are people from

um

right okay I have most watches from

United States that's just because my two

primary watches who watch basically are

either stream is from United States so

that has an effect on it and then I have

United Kingdom Australia Germany Hungary

Canada South Africa Italy

Latvia Portugal Sweden Brazil Poland

Philippines and last France

and I don't know if other countries

aren't listed because they have too few

views or if I've never gotten a view

from them

so yeah so so I wouldn't really be able

to confirm because I have to go through

so many countries but it's let's say I

started learning Spanish in the

so the first year of secondary school so

that would be the

10th year of Education

if that's that's

I could do that

since the first school which is the

compulsory school as it's officially

called in English in Sweden

I think it was competition I think I

lift them up

because I don't know what the

pronunciation is correct though but

um but yeah

okay I'm doing a bit of cleanup this is

into the lineup anyway so

try to hide

[Music]

um

[Music]

I want this seem like them

yeah I will connect there

to this thing but

English term for the Swedish secondary

school is after secondary school and I

lower secondary school this this these

nine years of compulsory school and then

you go over to three years of upper

Secondary School

gymnasium in Sweden you have like

High School University

if you translate this Swedish terms to

English basically

[Music]

[Music]

the choice is taking shape and and from

and form very cute very dormant thank

you thank you thank you

bucket very beautiful

I wonder how much is

it's nice I've been here for almost two

hours in that case you should have a lot

of points at the moment time for fun yes

so because you've been here for a while

now

let's let's have even more fun then

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

will I be able to name all

all 47 countries within the eight

minutes time limits or will I fail and

forget one of them

and obviously you can't help me someone

has already started to help me so

you predict with your channel points yes

or no

it will be loudly if

predicts because it's fun and Mickey can

I can join too

I believe oh no

yeah yeah it doesn't yeah because yeah

that doesn't work you can't do it with

Sweden

stupid

I can I can still start one but you

can't

can't protect part in it

[Music]

are we going to be quiet when it's no

you don't need to be quiet you can say

whatever you want me finish chat away as

you want and I can still speak to you

Jesus just can't list countries

obviously

[Music]

but we need

I'll be back

oh yeah do you want to win zero and you

can see her back and the wind will be

all points divided by the proportions of

what people

uh but

so yeah the same ads

I really wish they did something about

that especially when I put this as adult

Channel

I guess this won't be a prediction

because no one said no oh one person

said no it's going to be exciting

I wonder how easy it could do like a VPN

to take part of their predictions like

everything if you care like

have a

yeah this Chef's gonna beat him someone

someone should make like uh you see it

seem

that should work actually

okay

I guess I'll shall begin then

I will simply Press Start and then I

will type out in eight minutes are you

ready

I guess you're ready I'll be in now and

I

meow

start at the top

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

I had to talk to my English team

yeah I can't yeah I can't spell this one

this

then Stein no I can there you go that's

how I spell it

I did it

should accept our spelling too

much

yeah it doesn't benefit

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

macadamia

please

Cyprus turkey

and area and that is

Romania whoa

when they streak

I did it

I'm just gonna say the one that's not

bad

yourself on screen

[Music]

you can do any VPN even if you've got

Norton at right when you can miss that

you've been just really yeah something

easy to something you can quickly enable

due to the position that they said or

like have a second device or like have a

VPN through us a certain window

and then

open the stream and that and then

yesterday the prediction I did it

are you going to be at the different

Maps I I can't believe any other content

so

foreign

10 points split with a menu

nobody

basically got everything back what's 10

points right

now

it was five thousand

that went crazy

I miss that

one assassin 30 goes to olinian and

foreign

[Music]

what about Asia I mean I come to Asia

I mean it is not okay you know what

you know what let's bring up Asia

sorry sorry

[Music]

can I more info

two countries that's famous

that's spam boss kind of information

included yeah but it does exclude

Kazakhstan

uh Georgia

uh

Azerbaijan in Armenia I'm not sure of

appointments very good those are usually

considered part of Europe as well

like this tiny tiny bit of Kazakhstan so

if that's the rule then they should be

included and also I could

uh countries of Asia

not sure why it didn't work

let's okay let's do this then

uh

but then we need like a

like a different petition

yeah it is but that would be too from

that one as well

so

how how big should I start in this case

then it would like

uh steps or something

right

I said the music and

not many yeah how many countries can I

name yeah I guess that's the solution

um

let's

uh I'm going to djd

this song because it depended

and I will go back to drawing a bit

while you do the prediction let's see

I don't know how quickly can do like a

deep Learners of teach

[Music]

but yeah if yes had like

yeah that's that's what I wanted to say

if if like a web service

basically you would have to hand over

your past half password to them so it's

not like a it's quite a security issue

but there but

and certainly one

if we would attack

so they

but basically and they should have their

service located in

whatever country that you are allowed to

do prediction from

and then all you do is sign in to this

service

and on this service then you just type

whichever Channel it is doing a

prediction and then they give you the

option to predict in it because they

will do the predicting for you

it should it should in theory be

possible but yeah it is there is that

security issue

it's one of your state because I know at

15 yeah I mean you know all 50 states

you live in United States it would also

be a 51 by the way because

they would I actually don't know if they

would include mistake for Comfort I know

it's not it's not a stay but

maybe they maybe they don't include it

I think they usually that could be wrong

didn't work us out the Deep uh yeah I

mean if you already predicted I could

see it uh yeah

in that way in case he committed to it

already

too bad so sad

no I think yeah

all right twitch would do something

about that like

because Jesus is basically try to look

up those stuff and some countries say

like yeah if you predict which

the money or like win money or something

you need like a license or something but

that's not what twitch is doing

you're not predicting money you cannot

buy the okay to be fair you can actually

pay a subscription and they forget coins

points

you can actually pay to get more

[Music]

and technically you are able to cash out

the points for money

because

in Siri

because someone could have a redeem

where I didn't send you money if you

redeem it but no one would do that

we need at least one more person to

predict on a different of this option

otherwise there will not be any

prediction

I mean otherwise it will just be a loss

anyway I have too few people to do a

proper prediction anyway I mean not many

on this channel

not not many what she says at the moment

so

[Music]

no it's not

I should have done this on a separately

[Music]

can

[Music]

rescale it and stuff

[Music]

[Music]

I'll send you the map even if you don't

get another person predicting

[Music]

that's one

and four three two one that one I guess

we'll we'll see how it goes then

I guess I'm not going to dinner on my

map okay I'll start now

when it says don't support me

okay

a good idea oh no I did something bad

wow

sorry about that

I I did something bad

that's the wrong button

is it back oh yeah good

I will be back I wanted to press this

and then

oh yeah for some reason this this

doesn't work why

I can do it here

it just doesn't work specifically in the

twitch chat I have

there again

there's your mail rats okay I will start

now

10 minutes I got actually two extra

minutes it's so cute did I not coins

though sadly

and this is where I go

uh Georgia I said bye

and Armenia

and then we got these tiny ones which I

barely can't see

okay let's do iron Iraq

and then above that he likes Syria yeah

and then

Lebanon I mean

different language

does it count

Palestine okay

is red

I was

that's that one because

and then it is Bahrain

man

[Music]

yeah yeah man

uh

me

yeah yeah

and then there's a smaller one and

there's that one

I understand

that perspect Islam

um China

but not

an attack

the car is not a good time when

North Korea

North Korea South Korea Japan

and the pins which I can never type

[Music]

T more or less

Indonesia

Arts Tunisia take the rest of the one

India

[Music]

it's still like that

Nepal yes

I should know that you should know this

uh I learned

a Vietnam

the last

[Music]

moment

in your Porsche

balance here

[Music]

guess

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

this place is speak Khmer in

which is

this Cambodia so I know the languages

there's a long one

and it is a smaller one

what other countries born in India

it it looks like Mickey is correct

and there's that tiny one next to Israel

which country it does border Israel

Syria Iraq and Saudi Arabia what is

south of Syria

it is

when you just say the countries

now that's cheating

I mean

and then this is that one include that

now this one is in Africa

Africa isn't it crazy time

[Music]

I'm back yes yes

so this is I just can't stand

by a chance

spell check I mean I I know the country

name

I just don't like that like that

and then

now that's an African country night yeah

I spell it correctly

are you spell are you spell check anyway

and I did spell it correctly but it's an

African country apparently

[Music]

confused at the moment

we can use she can use one thing okay

but that doesn't help because I can't I

can't think of the names of this maybe

they come to my mind at some point

a packet

yeah East pack so it was India then it

split up to Pakistan West Pakistan East

Pakistan but Pakistan East Pakistan

became

[Music]

place

[Music]

um

I

[Music]

I I I'm

no it's not really coming to my mind

I really should know this

[Music]

I did the name Hong Kong and Macau does

that count how are things going

um

so there's five places

plus two more places

there's seven places

seven places there's a lot of places

let's do the accounts there's like

because Cyprus

thank you

one two three four five

six

oh no I can't even find this other place

and this is the seventh place I don't

know if transition something it's a

circle which I thought

is it like

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

that's pretty good but

yeah now I'm not getting that please

I'll give up

and so what are the missing places then

before I press give up so they don't

shop list the seven places and I'm a

press give up and we'll see if they show

up

[Music]

thank you

Jordan of course

Miss Bangladesh that's the name of East

Pakistan right uh Burma or Myanmar yeah

that's that's of course

yes that one Maldives what's the name of

the Ireland's uh

it does one two three four five six now

do you missing the one in Malaysia

it starts with b and eats

passing Borneo first but that's the

completed a different place and it's

Burma

basketball please that doesn't count

very nice that place I thought that was

my Myanmar it doesn't that doesn't count

subtract that one and now I need to

figure out what's called

I always want to point too many and

let's see it is

thank you

that should be right

when I accessories

see it started with B I got 42 points by

the way

because the only reason why

excited very much because it wrote it

yeah

yeah

let's check how bad my

instant yeah

so

so I got like the top most half obvious

things at least and Jordan was the most

obvious I forgot Bangladesh was quite

obvious Kuwait apparently too but I got

to do what I listed

it was the least known yeah

but I knew the first letter I didn't get

that much wait yeah Myanmar was asking

them all I didn't get

yep

except

but since we didn't have two options or

rather since zero points we had one

person but you're not gonna get any

points sadly because that's how it works

I'm going to delete this and give back

all of the points because otherwise all

the points will be deleted anyway so

that's it congratulations for being the

only one double script

say my country reward you in any way

you won

so when you have like a message to

predict thank you

collection

singers

carrots

it was like seven thousand I don't know

five seconds carrots

yeah I think we need more people

especially like fever options if you

guys ready

too many options

it works for being a channels

[Music]

no I don't know what to add this one

today I like a

shirt

detailing

you got the tail and you've got the head

flush

other the ears I've wearing let's see

[Music]

it's an interesting prepping hook out

there

[Music]

this is

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

ears

see if I can see them

but that was fine fun right

geography information

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

question

yay

but I did pretty well on that Asian map

I would say

in the more confidence if you want

wait how does this look

[Music]

yeah this one should probably

foreign

[Music]

I mean I wouldn't be able to like

now this looks wrong

to name

[Music]

like the subdivisions of Sweden I

wouldn't even be able to do that

so

there it is depends on which one you

want to join me a little bit more

familiar with than the landscape

so they got Stockholm that's been easy

that's a good one

[Music]

[Music]

it was quite a focus on this and let's

see if you get mine

what

Oh you mean the one usually fits

but I listed three so far and they are

the three

it's the biggest city so

isn't there like one called Esther

yataland

[Music]

calamari

anyone if I'm not from

Scotland that's one

um

[Music]

this is correct let me check this is

great oh it's such a tall lamp

and I'm doing a lot of

intermissions here

probably

let's make it a bit smaller

yeah like that I think

so let's see what did I say stop corn

ER

yes

no

it's not a place

and it's it's not the place

I said

isn't that like

a plant's land

it's over the place

[Music]

foreign and Saturday finance and I guess

those aren't

is that

see this is like

I don't like how they don't fill them

out that's kind of annoying

but this is kind of like this one is

coming I don't even know the places

uh

[Music]

missed my mom isn't that

yes

no

a nice reason this is the shape of

swimming I give you a no no I'm not

cheating are you cheating you shouldn't

get me all right that's not fun

I was supposed to figure out this on my

own

and

[Music]

candle no that's

not fun

[Music]

and

[Music]

foreign

hey

is it absala of course it is

it's

[Music]

[Music]

thank you assistant

[Music]

I mean

you mean landscope

[Music]

you didn't you didn't you said you were

giving me one you didn't say it was a

hint or something

John Chef I mean I recognize this name

and try to think of I couldn't come up

yet oh it is

where I made a mistake

that doesn't make any sense

is this yes

like like you got some places like uh

you have the body up solar Stockholm

AR young shopping

which are named after is it a city and

then you got

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

yeah

I might have written third land maybe

maybe I was trying to go for that at

least that's why and then we got like

another button that would actually be a

province

and that's what my thoughts be a

province

[Music]

but like best that's not my day that's

like it's a western part of the

uh

which is one of the but I can't do that

is it that

uh

[Music]

not that one

I want the uh

[Music]

there's no place for that

anyway

it was basically the three uh

lands of Sweden which is

[Music]

via land

I think those are the same

[Music]

if I'm not wrong

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

you did amazing thank you

I haven't I haven't really practiced

those unless you know them

what's the name they talked a hundred

largest

repeat like split in half

to add two

something like this

there you go and then

and then they're gonna look back at the

video and look at what I actually tried

to type when I try to where I saw them

and I might have everything stiff it

seems

um sorry I've completely forgot that

this one is too effective so that one is

done and now we can switch to this one

foreign

about my

knowledge about Sweden

did you know how Sweden looked like

maybe I should practice my

idea

the land

anyways now I did mess it up

foreign

[Music]

I see I see what's doing

that's why it's activated

of my signal that's what I'm doing

no it's great my expectations

yeah it must have been the wrong size

I don't know if I put it short size for

a reminder but that's the size it should

have

I want

yes I need that Sweden what's really

looks like we have a city here that's

transformed by Sweden and they teach

these two

there too it doesn't mean that you know

what street it looks like

that's neat

it's very neat

um

yeah this is this is

this is fun

this is spawn

and this is

okay

okay

[Music]

let's go

that looks like second bedroom eyes so

it's not for home screen

that's not exactly what's going for

every every day to Facebook

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

what animal are you we are all animals

here okay that's required you have to

pick an animal and you have you stick to

that animal

and you don't need to be another one

okay

bunny is done

time for the Twister

having a lot of strings

can I want just part of it not the whole

thing I might show any questions

just need to check I don't have two

screens so

I wish I had two screens

or like a drawing tablet we just made

out of that would be nice

but

like I would

look at that that's way too expensive

for me

[Music]

okay here's that one

let's scale It Up by 200.

and then I can just focus on that part

well I have three saunas oh a fourth

which is uh Fox wolf that would assume

awesome

and I'm finding

awesome

this one

Customs are awesome

what kind of person is it

oh my

look at this

I would probably have to edit the image

here that let me add the image to stream

uh picture

figure

look at this

awesome persons

we've got some boy

and that's so this one is

I can't I can't point on the stream

I can make it larger and I want to show

one of them look at this one this one is

cute

well more or less I'm a person's

subscribe

more specifically that one

oh yeah this is that's a specific one

I mean to be fair I have a dream specify

what kind of rabbit I have

so too yeah

lovely yes sir boring European rabbit

because I'm European I love it

[Music]

awesome but I guess that's what I can't

say why is it so large

which is so large

pretty fun one yeah

we keep here yeah

[Music]

you're not born you're very cool

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

maybe candy clouds

especially monarchy

I don't know I just called it English as

we say it in Swedish

they could be kind of soft squishy and

stuff

although they have to be so complicated

[Music]

[Music]

dispatch it like

I don't even know how she looks like

from this side

fully from the side

yeah like a lot from inside there

I'm sorry I was just seeing that's

missing

they are singing songs

I guess I could have like a karaoke

theme

memorize myself then I need to like

find a karaoke version of a song

this is a lot of

complicated stuff

where the chair makes the character

interesting to look at

oh

pretty

I mean you could just type Loop and I

say book

I can say I can say anything you write

okay

has to be some limitations

really okay yeah I mean I read that I am

reading comments if you write something

moving it out

which I know

it's

makes it more special message

I don't know when I'm watching streamers

it seems more fun when I do without the

comments when I'm playing I don't treat

that comments

at least I mean at least I still have a

few comments so it doubles the amount of

comments you know

so we are full of bunny and a kitten

here so far and a few more

yes you are correct

that we are so do you like your messages

and colors it actually kind of neat to

have a messaging colors instead of just

the name

hydrate

[Music]

very cute well you typed it so

I was just reading what you typed

okay let's see so it should be like

so this is a hoodie but I don't I don't

think I've ever seen what it looks like

from the side or the back I'm not sure

if it's here to draw that so

[Music]

what doesn't have like from the side

research time

a quick researching

[Music]

yeah

maybe some I could probably go with

foreign

[Music]

if I look at your expanded then

no it doesn't

it it gives a lot of messages but

and these messages does not contain

I don't think they continue so

now as far as I can see this yeah

badly not

yeah and my thumbs up for you then

everything

[Music]

but a very fantasy

keep on showing up

so I'm gonna

okay so yes okay Heidi

no I'm gonna be trying our food

experiment this week I'm gonna make

Italian meatballs filled with mozzarella

cheese I'm going to actually

hmm

I mean I've actually been seeing two and

a half hours

[Music]

the voice is giving up

so you're going to make your meatballs

yourself

by the sound of it

um

gave it to me

yeah you can see from the notification

that you got it

from him

can you imagine

Italian food

yeah yeah

might be in he might be familiar with

some Italian food

for some reason

[Music]

like

how does this one this is like no that's

a TV show that not guests are just

it's

it's like a body part I think

oh

once they cooked and also add some

Mariano sauce to the baking pan and top

it with a layer of mozzarella and

parmesan cheese

I was going to say that yeah after you

made the meatballs containing cheese

have cheese on top

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

so this is going to be

pressing round buttons again the outer

wing

and basically no slips cured by the body

but that's that's

ears

all right

routine

let's continue this one

because I wanted to draw the

stuff like that I think

[Music]

I did that

turning this up to stop by

[Music]

tilted

and then you have the full image in the

corner dirty

see why I'm working and if there's a

good addition or not it's kind of small

she probably make it larger

and then I have to resize stuff

I kind of need a second screen at that

point if I'm going to make since my

[Music]

oh

thanks this out like this or something

[Music]

or something

I don't know if that's that's good it

should probably though that's first

initial behind you I can catch that

is a kid

foreign

[Music]

oh yeah so yeah they meet

by itself is from recipe the rest time

yeah yeah

and everything else is your

I wanted to use a Swedish expression

there I can look after

[Music]

the thing is though I have to spell

Swedish expression

oh

uh

yeah I

repeat

oh there we go that's the English word

concoction

[Music]

and yeah because the Swedish time is

basically together cooking

[Music]

but I have made polish meatballs filled

with a sauerkraut in the past awesome so

sword

yeah

uh

it's called because in Swedish again

sauerkraut and that's just German

[Music]

Swedish time is Super common

but corn is

cabbage apparently so that's sour

cabbage that would be

English version of the Swedish

translation the English translation of

the switch to a word for yourself

I didn't experimenting with food

experience that's authentic

I mean that would be weird are people

doing that

like

I mean yeah

I had no experience people I'm

experimenting in them

are people doing that

the bonus part is

[Music]

I don't speak Polish

look at surprise I don't speak Polish

[Music]

this is a Swedish show about polish

spread it up but it's a pan so it

doesn't work in English

and it's a bad pan even so who knows

maybe I should say it because it's

because it's it's such a bad

[Music]

it's not meant to be good

to come and say that you're doing a joke

by explaining it it's such a bad prance

it's solid students

the right 16th

[Music]

thank you

cosmetic systems is everything Nation

it's it's already doing by existing okay

and there are people who think text Max

is authentic Tech Mexican food when it

isn't I like textbooks but it is Method

yeah but that's not really what you

mentioned before I mean

it's one thing to not know the origin of

something and it's and from the name I

would assume it's like a Texan Texan

Mexican combination

of stuff

and I wouldn't really associate with

neither Texas or Mexico

specifically

because

I mean

french fries and French

where Danish Pastry past pastries from

Danish Pastry Spanish pasties

process I said Danish because it stops

he speaks Spanish not Spanish

foreign

Copenhagen

I mean you mean curbing hands okay what

oh

and that is

pastry

something something just tarnish

especially in American Image it's a

model Aid a laminated sweet pastry

tradition

[Music]

because it was brought to Denmark by

Austin Bakers where the recipe was

partly changed and accommodated by the

Danes to the liking and has since

developed into a delicious person so it

is it still is a place storage in

Denmark Austria but so okay so it's a

Danish version of the of an Austrian

recipe so I could I can agree with

Danish Pastry that's a good time then

in Danish Norwegian and Swedish the time

for Danish Pastry is

mini viney spread the same etymology is

also the origin of the

finishai in Vienna the Danish Pastry is

called Copenhagen there

they're trying to

Copenhagen or Danish

that's the that's some etymology of

that thing

that's the random fact for today

[Music]

oh I got a lot of viewers do you want to

have more artifacts

[Music]

so so the finger is like

designs or something so if I would try

to straighten out

[Music]

something I don't know

thank you

lead

then I can take it here

[Music]

him

that's not how you're okay

[Music]

duplicating different games

and then I'm going to

size up then

[Music]

this is the moment whereas the kitten

would say yours is

welcome welcome nice to see you familiar

faces and unfamiliar faces as well

I am happy to see anyone coming here our

house you been doing

so haircut Here Comes The Challenge

ugly hands

I I really suck at hands

who is this

do you know Clyde

do you know do you know yeah do you know

this dream is on Twitch

[Music]

I had a challenge with BT on this deeply

strength the recovering from building a

desk and chair gifted to me by my little

that's very kind of them of him I'm

super awesome and

yeah that's great it's it's foreign

placing things on this

aside from the obvious of course

I

maybe bend the fingers maybe that

yeah maybe this maybe this becoming

yeah I mean you're not going to see the

head anyways

[Music]

it doesn't they did

I'm going to avoid trying it

just your delivery body

then you're from drawing the head for as

long as much fun

was it possible

so

another lips look like from the side

come very soon down there

let's

start with something like that

and now

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

maybe it might be something like that

other day when I close it should

probably be living

[Music]

and then there's this chips shoes

choose something she used to try

it's so much easier to just drop almost

let me just dropped juice

[Music]

I cannot

really beside this different

look

what is the sides

so I'm just going to the seam there like

[Music]

something happening

[Music]

something like that

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

that's nice

but

I need to try

yeah let's take my time

is it Tuesday

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

laughs

[Music]

I want to play this every day without

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I guess this should be this

thing

[Music]

when it suits her it's swimsuits like

[Music]

I like the designs it's very cute the

colors matched with it very nice and I I

mean she has washed her so

I wouldn't wouldn't any color match with

their phone but the eyes yeah I got

point there

like the purple and green and everything

in the rainbow rainbow nice colors

[Music]

yeah

just if you see anyone

[Music]

[Music]

now you see linked we're both silly

we can be silly together

I think all these details makes it more

clear that it is lovely well no I said

who it was

why they still haven't guessed yet

didn't give enough episodes but

Maybe

I think that's like a hand or something

holding me down

fine

yeah that's the compromise

[Music]

I know

[Music]

I mean it would be probably not because

you see down there

um

[Music]

okay

I've agreed to eat but only with a

slight time of change that you are a bit

more cute

I guess I could accept that

because I said

I want you to be my scene so it's fair

can I agree on that then

[Music]

yay double carrot

a lot of cats

[Music]

I was removing the late circuit at this

[Music]

okay I think

[Music]

this one might need

[Music]

after drying this image and starting to

question uh

[Music]

now it's online

about the proportions to be right like

this is not correct this is not great

this is not correct this is almost great

so

in the further adjustments

but no problem

and

[Music]

it's been complete

[Music]

is 16.

I didn't get

[Music]

all right it smells perfectly

[Music]

oh yeah it should definitely be secure

as well that's that's

awesome

like that

this one really needs the

Infinity camera again

yeah I should probably

complete basically Replay that would

sound like I only have one at the moment

I should get more

a bit more evaluation

something like that maybe and well I

just went and ordered a copy of The

Iliad

never read it however I have read The

Artisan

which language which Edition

you never know it when it comes to you

oh thank you for the following Hitachi

Johnson

welcome

to the

panic

I don't know I don't have a terms

well whichever version they make your

reading school I don't know which one

that is well I didn't make me read any

of those Instagram content

so that's

to you to figure out

but basically

the version you read in school or

something or that you should have it in

school I guess

your husband you haven't read it

oh

maybe I should distance

um

see images

what it is

foreign

foreign

It's Tricky

that's not the ease

foreign

[Music]

so that's why

I ask

I should find a link it at the end of my

stream or something and I

don't even think of it is

so

that's it

let me just have to I see this card I

will join smiles

let me see if a new person joins here

you're coming

[Music]

I hope

seven makes sense

[Music]

thank you

remember the defense

separately

[Music]

and then the eyes

[Music]

how do the eyes look

[Music]

um

[Music]

the server is at least for now but

no

activity but

activity probably will increase

it's more people show up

and of course I keep them

[Music]

I have

I keep posting updates in case there are

things against us on

[Music]

it will evolve every time yeah

it's still an amazing server oh do you

think so I think it's quite purpose

but I'm happy you see so

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

that kind of looks like normally

[Music]

um

[Music]

very much in a further along

and let's click these two

I'm in a bunch of groups that are muted

because they never shut up and they

still harass me for 15 minutes

yeah you have to add a muted shoot do it

I guess you need to donate

yeah this was a bit better you can right

click on a server or remote and hold

down and then you got

notification settings and then you got

these three basic options

all messages

only when you get a reply to which is

when the reply function was or

it does think it's uh Rose and stuff and

then you got nothing

I don't think that's

the same I guess that's the muted

setting but it is you can also then you

have additional settings like uh um

silence everyone in here because I think

that that's not part of the above

and then you can silence roles which I

think is part of this

maybe maybe this isn't part of the above

item and then you got other things like

highlights and new events

it's basically spots click on everything

[Music]

[Music]

unfair

let's have quite a thin niche

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

or that one

let's see if today is upside down and

sit down

that's exactly

that's often

[Music]

anyway anyway that's probably going

because you've been buying stuff in

I'm sure it's a bag of some kind one

time I did some of somehow myself

science is

it was so fast

I thought yeah yeah not exactly now it

seems to work for me though but

I have no idea

I know that I did join a new server and

it was set to send all notifications and

I bought a lot of messages and your

rights this swimsuit should have been

done already

and now for the great outfit and hydrate

fancy then

[Music]

I see like every other outfit change or

something

I really wanted the redeems to shop in

chat because I do get a message when I

get I got the good I do get a sound

alert when I get a message in chat

[Music]

and I want that to happen with your

teams too because currency redeems are

completely signed

oh yeah it's not really a great system

then if they shop in the chat in the on

screenshots which is the one I'm always

talking about when she said

um I get a notification I get that sound

and the this chat shows when people

follow

And subscribe

and stuff and you're probably seen it

during this stream

[Music]

so that

can't do that I'm using a stream

elements

yes

but apparently it cannot trigger on the

routines which I find stupid because

what if you haven't redeemed that you do

something on stream elements and it's

kind of streaming on it

for example

I have the Highlight message but what

yeah that's our style is one message

why can't I have a team that's basically

make all my messages or like a certain

amount of time highlighted

instead of having to hide every single

message

that would be a family

the purple takes this kind of hard to

get back here it's experiment dark

it's fine you can read still like your

dad like a white a hotline or something

like that

but when I highlight your message then

it's beautiful and purple

and I don't think oramian has tried to

highlight the images I don't remember it

when it makes it all I believe is it

it's using it using colors basically

like that

there is a base for the chat but

otherwise I coded a lot of it myself

a bit happy to return it

looks like lonesome

it's such a mess of lines

I don't think I missed anything

I guess

this does this image yes it does second

is its Point stuff

so I think I should add this lines

because that's something added to you

foreign

Conan three

there's a lot of carrots I think that's

good

[Music]

and then I'm going to take the other one

near it

[Music]

rotate it

this is a little higher and there you go

[Music]

I think

yeah it doesn't matter exactly how it

looks now it will improve it we did the

line art

[Music]

and I will try to try to

make data I actually don't but sorry

about that it's

not like a pump on that but I would yeah

this

this it is the

black outline

that color

expressions

[Music]

right

and foreign

but when it comes to

and bunnies I can add these white

details I'm not sure how well they show

up on stream but

[Music]

it's just a few of them say no problem I

need those

I will do the eyes like this completely

purple and

things like that

when these eyes looks like that

however the one part I'm curious about

should I do the colored outline or

should I do the outline completely black

and because

at the same here

look at these artifacts

and I I don't know the lyrics

look at these artifacts every time I do

it makes me laugh

[Music]

how did the picture get so compressed

and

and what the hell is

um

something something

it needs to be something yeah I think

that's a cloud

[Music]

and what the hell is on this shoe there

you go

[Music]

color now now this is what I'm working

on with yoga and maybe you can give me a

suggestion because I want people

shooting so basically I'm drawing these

three characters that I'm color

and so let me pick up two that actually

just there we go that's very obvious

marketing now oh yeah these two cards

are here

I mean yeah you're happy

she's not that stupid lucky even but

anyway

um

support is obviously charm with black

lines and black colored uh

but

well well

[Music]

in the middle of the conversation hello

North archives Noah and

Dynamite

welcome bye the nice of you today show

up

if you were doing uh Cold Stream is that

what you got it

playing together I mean you

know that's at the same time so it's

I've seen so that's the shout out to

work

let me see

nothing is

[Music]

slow something is wrong with the uh

playing party doesn't show up or

anything

but um

and then it's this one

[Music]

uh thank you for the following I know

so so since umness was unable to tell me

what you're playing

so what were you playing I think you

mentioned it but I don't remember

looking great with cheese thank you Tom

that's it

that's the first special message oh your

name is very dark on the chat

and um don't don't mind wants outfit

we're playing totally reliable delivery

service

hey

so you can describe the game and what

you were giving is a great opportunity

for that and I myself I'm drawing

yeah

the characters in the middle and the

rest of the references which I have not

drawn

this is my very first

drawing stream I do and

[Music]

Amazon

in the middle of a question actually if

when you when you

so kindly

read it

so

[Music]

one of you

me

so I'll still ask and finish my question

to you yoga if you're still here

if you're still listening I think

so because these characters are also

characters that run in different art

styles should I yeah I'm not going to

bother drawing these Shadows

I bet

should I do black outlines or should I

do them in colors

as close as possible there with the pink

but maybe that would look

weird if I'm doing black outlines I

don't know

[Music]

I don't know actually

and that's and that's why I lived out

times yeah

yeah I guess I can do that I mean if I

don't like it I can always turn them

black afterwards

yeah yeah

well thank you for your answer I

appreciate that

[Music]

yes so

foreign

[Music]

all right

first I did

I just smash it

[Music]

and then I did this

[Music]

as I could express it

that's when the lines different lines

are transparent

[Music]

you can see where the overlap

giving me a bit more information

I worked

we think

so

yeah as I said before the rate appeared

that I was going to finish the this uh

this

step and then I was actually going to

end the stream because I'm very tired

I'm about to sleep

if that's okay with you

am I allowed to sleep

pet them

this one

bunny needs a nice carrot sleep better

yeah it's bedtime it is 23 or five

[Music]

now our hydrate sorry though I didn't

see that for some reason I always miss

hydrates I don't

I really miss outfit changes I've

sometimes missed number two

did you already leave

[Music]

she of course perfectly fine too if you

don't want to stick around that's

probably fine

I am not used to it

[Music]

and I don't have any funny reads

sing showing up more than a simple

message

two messages even one in the chat on

screen and one in the corner

so I guess I don't treat an easy one in

the chat but I don't know

[Music]

so yeah

[Music]

you're back

it's just a silly that became it was fun

[Music]

and consume it is something with the

delivering something and with that

description I assume it's one one of

those kinds of

um

a physics based

[Music]

basically Goat Simulator I don't want to

use statistic go to example but

you didn't come up with anything back

so

Netflix

correct

so because I'm tired and I almost want

to get something sleep how about repair

visits to a streamer that

am I afraid it's

I don't think I have

so it would be my first rate

[Music]

in that case

so

let's see if that didn't copy as I

expected

it is at the 420 penny uh you

Australian Steel Man there we go

who is currently playing Fall Guys

and I S I don't remember if he was

playing with other streamers or not

well I enjoyed this game a lot and I

hope you have a wonderful night and

sleep and Bun sleep well and have a

great night tonight

you're not going to use the waving about

emoji

well thank you thank you so much Mickey

it means a lot to me and I I haven't

switched screen and the outfit change is

over I did the hydrate everything

I don't know when I will do the and that

was about this template by the way

I don't know when I will do the uh

another drawing stream

and

I will

must I will definitely do it on

Wednesday if I don't do it earlier uh so

I will probably just add a

notification in on my Discord server if

um

at the time is shouting out and that's

the times you have the times on the

about page and you can go to schedule

the schedule this ads on my Discord and

we're moving our two days another

Channel now when I don't have a great

message
